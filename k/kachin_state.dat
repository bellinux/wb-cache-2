The following month, {{he was forced to}} formally cease to be a monk after several monasteries refused him membership, which he said was due to their fear of government reprisals if they were to allow him to enter. He then returned to his birth name of Nyi Nyi Lwin.|$|E
25|$|Conflicts in <b>Kachin</b> <b>State</b> {{and other}} Kachin {{populated}} areas have occurred since Burmese {{independence from the}} United Kingdom. Kachin troops previously formed {{a significant part of}} the Burmese army. With the unilateral abrogation of the Union of Burma constitution by the Ne Win regime in 1962, Kachin forces withdrew and formed the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) under the Kachin Independence Organization (KIO). Aside from the major towns and railway corridor, <b>Kachin</b> <b>State</b> has been virtually independent from the mid-1960s through 1994, with an economy based on smuggling, jade trade with China, and narcotics.|$|E
25|$|The most {{powerful}} Shan states were Mohnyin and Mogaung in present-day <b>Kachin</b> <b>State,</b> followed by Hsenwi (Theinni) (split up in a northern and a southern state in 1988), THsipaw (Thibaw) and Momeik in present-day northern Shan State.|$|E

5000|$|Production {{is mainly}} {{concentrated}} in the Shan and <b>Kachin</b> <b>states.</b> Due to poverty, opium production is attractive to impoverished farmers as the financial return from poppy is 17 times more than that of rice. The yield during 2012 was 690 tons, valued at US $359 million.|$|R
25|$|Ceasefire {{agreements}} {{have been}} signed between the KIA {{and the government}} several times; most notably a ceasefire signed in 1994, that lasted for 17 years until June 2011, when government forces attacked KIA positions along the Taping River, east of Bhamo, <b>Kachin</b> <b>State.</b>|$|E

25|$|Renewed {{fighting}} {{broke out}} in April 2014 when the Burmese army attacked various KIA positions around Mansi Township, <b>Kachin</b> <b>State</b> and northern Shan State to eradicate timber smuggling and to control strategic routes around their strongholds.

5000|$|Burma is the world's {{second largest}} {{producer}} of opium after Afghanistan, producing some 25% of the world's opium. In the past, though, it was [...] "the world's unrivaled leader in opiate production".

50|$|The <b>Kachin</b> <b>States</b> vast {{quantity}} of wooded forests have attracted many Chinese businessmen {{who work with}} the KIA in producing, smuggling, and trading Burmese lumber in China. In the first ten months of 2013 alone, {{more than two million}} cubic meters of logs were shipped from Kachin through Ruili. This has contributed to deforestation in the region, as well as a large source of revenue for the rebel army.|$|R
50|$|Local {{communities}} {{pointed out}} other {{issues such as}} the dam's location on earthquake-prone zone. They opposed the dam site because it is less than 100 km from the major Sagaing fault line, posing a risk to basin inhabitants if an earthquake weakened the dam or caused landslides in the reservoir. If the Irrawaddy Myitsone Dam broke during an earthquake, it would endanger the lives of hundred of thousands of people downstream in <b>Kachin</b> <b>State’s</b> largest city, Myikyina.|$|R

25|$|Lan Xang was not {{the only}} remote, mountainous region the Burmese king had trouble controlling. Northernmost Shan states of Mohnyin and Mogaung (and their vassals in present-day <b>Kachin</b> <b>State</b> and Sagaing Region) collectively revolted in July 1571. He sent two 12,000-strong armies led by Nanda and Thado Dhamma Yaza II. The armies easily recaptured the states. But, like in Lan Xang, the troops spent five {{punishing}} months fruitlessly chasing after the renegade saophas in the snow-clad foothills of the Himalayas.|$|E
25|$|However, he {{and other}} vassal rulers were only {{nominally}} loyal to the high king. They used Nanda's preoccupation with Siam, which revolted in May 1584, to gain greater autonomy for themselves, only contributing nominally to the war effort. In all, Minye Thihathu {{went to the front}} only in the 1586–87 invasion of Siam, contributing just two regiments (2000 men). He sent a single regiment each in the 1590–91 and 1592–93 invasions. He provided no support in suppressing the 1590–92 rebellion in Mogaung (present-day <b>Kachin</b> <b>State).</b>|$|E

However, soon Aung San Suu Kyi's government did not manage with the ethnic conflicts in Shan and <b>Kachin</b> <b>states,</b> where thousands of refugees fled to China, and eventually the persecution of the Rohingya by the government forces escalated {{to the point that it}} is not uncommonly called a genocide. Aung San Suu Kyi, when interviewed, has denied the allegations of ethnic cleansing. She has also refused to grant citizenship to the Rohingya, instead taking steps to issue ID cards for residency but no guarantees of citizenship.|$|R
25|$|Today, it is {{estimated}} that Burma is the origin of upwards of 70 percent of the world's supply of high-quality jadeite. Most of the jadeite mined in Burma is not cut for use in Burma, instead being transported to other nations, primarily in Asia, for use in jewelry and other products. The jadeite deposits found in Kachinland, in Burma’s northern regions is the highest quality jadeite in the world, considered precious by sources in China going {{as far back as the}} 10th century. Jadeite in Burma is primarily found in the “Jade Tract” located in Lonkin Township in <b>Kachin</b> <b>State</b> in northern Burma which encompasses the alluvial region of the Uyu River between the 25th and 26th parallels. Present-day extraction of jade in this region occurs at the Phakant-gyi, Maw Se Za, Tin Tin, and Khansee mines. Khansee is also the only mine that produces Maw Sit Sit, a type of jade. Mines at Tawmao and Hweka are mostly exhausted. From to 1964 to 1981, mining was exclusively an enterprise of the Myanmar government. In 1981, 1985, and 1995, the Gemstone laws were modified to allow increasing private enterprise. In addition to this region, there are also notable mines in the neighboring Sagaing District, near the towns of Nasibon and Natmaw and Hkamti. Sagaing is a district in Myanmar proper, not a part of the ethic <b>Kachin</b> <b>State.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Irrawaddy River arises by the {{confluence}} of the N'mai(Nam Gio) and Mali Rivers in <b>Kachin</b> <b>State.</b> Both the N'mai and Mali Rivers find their sources in the Himalayan glaciers of Upper Burma near 28° N. The eastern branch of the two, N'mai, is the larger and rises in the Languela Glacier north of Putao. It is unnavigable because of the strong current whereas the smaller western branch, the Mali river, is navigable, despite a few rapids. Herefore, the Mali river is still called by the same name as the main river by locals. The controversial Myitsone Dam is currently under construction at the convergence of these rivers.|$|E
25|$|In 1752, a new dynasty called Konbaung rose to {{challenge}} Restored Hanthawaddy, {{and went on}} to reunite much of the kingdom by 1758. In 1758–59, King Alaungpaya, the founder of the dynasty, sent an expedition to the farther Shan States (present-day <b>Kachin</b> <b>State</b> and northern and eastern Shan State), which had been annexed by the Qing over two decades earlier, to reestablish Burmese authority. (Nearer Shan States had been reacquired since 1754). Three of the ten farther Shan state sawbwas (Mogaung, Bhamo, Hsenwi) and their militias reportedly ran away into Yunnan and tried to persuade Qing officials to invade Burma. The nephew of Kengtung sawbwa and his followers also fled.|$|E

50|$|Upper Burma {{has seen}} a {{demographic}} shift resulting from the recent immigration of many Mainland Chinese to Mandalay Region, Shan, and <b>Kachin</b> <b>States.</b> Ethnic Chinese now constitute an estimated 30 to 40% of Mandalay's population. Huge swaths of land in city centre left vacant by the fires were later purchased, mostly by the ethnic Chinese, {{many of whom were}} recent immigrants from Yunnan. The Chinese influx accelerated after the current military government came to power in 1988. With the Burmese government turning a blind eye, many Chinese immigrants from Yunnan (and also from Sichuan) poured into Upper Burma in the 1990s, settling in Mandalay. In the 1990s alone, about 250,000 to 300,000 Yunnanese were estimated to have migrated to Mandalay. Their arrival has been vital in the doubling of Mandalay's population from about 500,000 in 1980 to one million in 2008. Chinese festivals are now firmly embedded in the city's cultural calendar. The influx of Mainland Chinese into the city and the subsequent displacement of native Burmese to {{the outskirts of the city}} has created racial tensions.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Confirmation of artemisinin-delayed {{parasite}} clearance in Plasmodium falciparum {{along the}} Thai-Myanmar border has inspired a global response to contain and monitor drug resistance to avert the disastrous {{consequences of a}} potential spread to Africa. However, resistance data from Myanmar are sparse, particularly from high-risk areas where limited health services and decades of displacement create conditions for resistance to spread. Subclinical infections may represent an important reservoir for resistance genes that confer a fitness disadvantage relative to wild-type alleles. This study estimates the prevalence of resistance genotypes in three previously unstudied remote populations in Myanmar and tests the a priori hypothesis that resistance gene prevalence would be higher among isolates collected from subclinical infections than isolates collected from febrile clinical patients. A systematic review of resistance studies is provided for context. Methods Community health workers in Karen and <b>Kachin</b> <b>States</b> and an area spanning the Indo-Myanmar border collected dried blood spots from 988 febrile clinical patients and 4, 591 villagers with subclinical infection participating in routine prevalence surveys. Samples positive for P. falciparum 18 s ribosomal RNA by real-time PCR were genotyped for P. falciparum multidrug resistance protein (pfmdr 1) copy number and the pfcrt K 76 T polymorphism using multiplex real-time PCR. Results Pfmdr 1 copy number increase and the pfcrt K 76 polymorphism were determined for 173 and 269 isolates, respectively. Mean pfmdr 1 copy number was 1. 2 (range: 0. 7 to 3. 7). Pfmdr 1 copy number increase was present in 17. 5 %, 9. 6 % and 11. 1 % of isolates from Karen and <b>Kachin</b> <b>States</b> and the Indo-Myanmar border, respectively. Pfmdr 1 amplification was more prevalent in subclinical isolates (20. 3 %) than clinical isolates (6. 4 %, odds ratio 3. 7, 95 % confidence interval 1. 1 - 12. 5). P fcrt K 76 T prevalence ranged from 90 - 100 %. Conclusions Community health workers can contribute to molecular surveillance of drug resistance in remote areas of Myanmar. Marginal and displaced populations under-represented among previous resistance investigations {{can and should be}} included in resistance surveillance efforts, particularly once genetic markers of artemisinin-delayed parasite clearance are identified.

25|$|Burma's {{successful}} defense {{laid the}} foundation for the present-day boundary between the two countries. The border still was not demarcated, and the borderlands were still overlapping spheres of influence. After the war, Burma remained in possession of Koshanpye, the nine states above Bhamo. At least down to the eve of the First Anglo-Burmese War in 1824, the Burmese exerted authority over the southern Yunnan borderlands, as far as Kenghung (present-day Jinghong, Yunnan). Likewise, the Chinese exercised a degree of control over the borderlands, including present-day northeastern <b>Kachin</b> <b>State.</b> Overall, the Burmese were able to push back the line of control up to one that existed before the Qing consolidation drive of the 1730s.|$|E

25|$|Other {{consequences}} of the inundation include loss of farmland, loss of spawning habitat as fishes can not swim upstream anymore. The Kachin Development Networking Group, a network of civil society groups and development organisations in <b>Kachin</b> <b>State</b> warn this {{will lead to a}} loss of income for fishermen. They report locals are also worried about the flooding of cultural sites in the flood zone. As with other large dam projects, the Myitsone Dam construction will alter the hydrological characteristics of the river, e.g. preventing sediment from enriching riverbanks downstream, where it usually enriches the riverside foodproducing plains. This can affect fertility as far downstream as the Irrawaddy Delta, the major rice-producing area of Myanmar.|$|E

50|$|Singaling Hkamti {{was founded}} in 1820. It was a {{tributary}} state of the King of Burma until 1887, when the Shan states submitted to British rule {{after the fall of}} the Konbaung dynasty. Its inhabitants were mostly Shan people who were said to have come from Hkamti Long. Before the time of rule by the British the state was often raided by the <b>Kachin</b> people.The <b>state</b> was integrated into Burma after independence from the British in 1948.|$|R
50|$|The United Nations {{reported}} that Min Aung Hlaing’s {{soldiers have been}} deliberately targeting civilians in <b>Kachin</b> and Shan <b>State,</b> had raped Rohingya women, shot civilians and burned villages in Rakhine State.

25|$|The long {{border between}} Burma and China {{had long been}} vaguely defined. The Ming dynasty first conquered Yunnan borderlands between 1380 and 1388, and stamped out local {{resistance}} by the mid-1440s. The Burmese control of the Shan States (which covered the present-day <b>Kachin</b> <b>State,</b> Shan State and Kayah State) came in 1557 when King Bayinnaung of the Toungoo dynasty conquered all of the Shan States. The border was never demarcated in the modern sense, with local Shan sawbwas (chiefs) at the border regions paying tribute to both sides. The situation turned to China's favor in the 1730s when the Qing decided to impose a tighter control of Yunnan's border regions while the Burmese authority largely dissipated with the rapid decline of the Toungoo dynasty.|$|E
25|$|The Kachin {{people are}} a major ethnic {{minority}} in Myanmar who mainly inhabit the mountainous northern regions of the Kachin Hills in <b>Kachin</b> <b>State.</b> They have fought for the self-determination of their people since Myanmar gained independence, though less so than other ethnic minorities in Myanmar, such as the Karen people. Kachin regular soldiers previously formed {{a significant part of}} the Myanmar military; however, after General Ne Win's regime seized power in 1962, many Kachin soldiers defected from the military and reorganized with already active Kachin insurgents to form the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), under the Kachin Independence Organisation (KIO). Religious tensions have also been a source of conflict, as Kachin people have historically been predominantly Christian, while the majority Bamar people have been predominantly Buddhist.|$|E
25|$|Countries {{which have}} had major {{epidemics}} in the past, but which have controlled the disease primarily by vaccination, include China, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan and Thailand. Other countries that still have periodic epidemics include Vietnam, Cambodia, Myanmar, India, Nepal, and Malaysia.

There were reported cases in <b>Kachin</b> <b>State,</b> Myanmar in 2013. The spread of the virus in Australia is of particular concern to Australian health officials due to the unplanned introduction of Culex gelidus, a potential vector of the virus, from Asia. However, the current presence on mainland Australia is minimal. There had been 116 deaths reported in Odisha's backward Malkangiri district of India in 2016.|$|E

Despite appeals to higher authorities, the Church has not recovered its property.|$|R
50|$|The British {{promised to}} {{consider}} the case of the Karen after the war. While the situation of the Karen was discussed, nothing practical was done before the British left Myanmar. The 1947 Constitution, drawn without Karen participation due to their boycott of the elections to the Constituent Assembly, also failed to address the Karen question specifically and clearly, leaving it to be discussed only after independence. The Shan and Karenni states were given the right to secession after 10 years, the <b>Kachin</b> their own <b>state,</b> and the Chin a special division. The Mon and Arakanese of Ministerial Myanmar were not given any consideration.|$|R
50|$|Towards {{the end of}} the British {{colonial era}} (1945-1948), the Karen {{leadership}} insisted on a separate state covering today's Kayin State and much of Mon State and Taninthayi Region, within the British Empire. They refused to sign the Panglong Agreement of February 1947, which was the basis for the 1947 Constitution of Burma, and boycotted the pre-independence elections of April 1947. Nonetheless, the constitution granted the Karen a state, though with an area less than what the Karen leadership had asked for from the British. The constitution also guaranteed states with the right to secede from the Union after a period of 10 years. (The Panglong Agreement gave only the Shan and the <b>Kachin</b> a <b>state</b> each; the Chin who actually signed the agreement did not receive a state.) The Karen National Union, which dominated the Karen leadership, was not satisfied, and wanted outright independence. In 1949, the KNU raised a rebellion that continues up to today. The KNU celebrates January 31 as 'revolution day', marking the day they went underground at the battle of Insein.|$|R
