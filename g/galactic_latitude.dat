5|$|The field {{selected}} for the observations needed to fulfill several criteria. It {{had to be at}} a high <b>galactic</b> <b>latitude,</b> because dust and obscuring matter in the plane of the Milky Way's disc prevents observations of distant galaxies at low galactic latitudes. The target field had to avoid known bright sources of visible light (such as foreground stars), and infrared, ultraviolet and X-ray emissions, to facilitate later studies at many wavelengths of the objects in the deep field, and also needed to be in a region with a low background infrared 'cirrus', the diffuse, wispy infrared emission believed to be caused by warm dust grains in cool clouds of hydrogen gas (H I regions).|$|E
5|$|The Astronomical Society of Southern Africa in 2003 {{reported}} that observations {{of four of}} the Mira variables in Microscopium were very urgently needed as data on their light curves was incomplete.

Another red giant, T Microscopii, is a semiregular variable that ranges between magnitudes 7.7 and 9.6 over 344 days. Of apparent magnitude 11, DD Microscopii is a symbiotic star system composed of an orange giant of spectral type K2III and white dwarf in close orbit, with the smaller star ionizing the stellar wind of the larger star.

40|$|Abstract. We {{discuss the}} galactic {{distribution}} of 450 sources detected by the EUVE satellite that have reliable distance estimates. Late-type stars dominate the nearby EUV source distribution, whereas {{the majority of}} EUV source detections with distances> 100 pc are hot white dwarf stars. The galactic distribution of all these sources is non-uniform with number enhancements seen towards the Hyades cluster, in line-of-sight along the β CMa interstellar tunnel and towards high <b>galactic</b> <b>latitudes</b> in both hemispheres. A comparison {{of the distribution of}} these EUV sources with that of the neutral absorption boundary of the Local Bubble region derived from the interstellar NaI observations of Sfeir et al. (1999) reveals that vast majority of EUV sources are contained within this neutral boundary. However, at high <b>galactic</b> <b>latitudes</b> 20 extragalactic EUV sources have been detected along lines-of-sight with low neutral column density, and is consistent with the local interstellar cavity being “open-ended ” in the galactic halo. This “Local Chimney ” opens towards two regions of enhanced intensity of the 0. 25 keV soft X-ray background emission at high <b>galactic</b> <b>latitudes.</b> Although the hot Local Bubble gas is still contained within a cold, neutral interstellar gas boundary in the galactic plane, it has probably expanded into the halo to produce the Local Chimney feature...|$|R

50|$|A further {{revision}} by Laing, Riley and Longair in 1983, called 3CRR or 3CR², included galaxies {{which were}} not detected in the original catalogue due to shortcomings of the original observations, but which otherwise meet the flux and declination limits. This new catalogue, which includes all extragalactic radio sources on the Northern Hemisphere with 178-MHz flux density > 10.9 Jy (on the scale of Baars et al.), declination greater than 10 degrees, and <b>Galactic</b> <b>latitude</b> greater than 10 degrees or less than -10 degrees, is formally a complete sample of radio galaxies and radio loud quasars. It excludes a number of well-known 3C/3CR objects, including, of course, all the supernova remnants from 3C, but also some well-known radio galaxies that fall foul of the declination, flux density or <b>galactic</b> <b>latitude</b> constraints. Objects that had been discovered to consist of multiple components associated with different objects were given an alphabetical suffix (A, B...) {{to make it clear}} which component was part of the sample: e.g. the radio galaxy 3C 66B is part of the sample, but the BL Lac object 3C 66A is not.|$|E

40|$|For {{about two}} decades, a {{population}} of relative small and nearby molecular clouds {{has been known to}} exist at high <b>Galactic</b> <b>latitudes.</b> Lying more than 10 ^∘ from the Galactic plane, these clouds have typical distances of ∼ 150 pc, angular sizes of ∼ 1 ^∘, and masses of order tens of solar masses.
