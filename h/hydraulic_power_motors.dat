50|$|Hydraulic Excavators are {{somewhat}} {{different from other}} construction equipment in that all movement and functions of the machine are accomplished through the transfer of hydraulic fluid. The compact excavator's work group and blade are activated by hydraulic fluid acting upon hydraulic cylinders.

40|$|Anywhere liquid {{pressure}} is reduced across a throttling device, {{there is a}} potential application for a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> recovery <b>motor</b> (HPRM). Cost of power makes HPRM's attractive with recoveries as small as 25 hp on a continuous basis. When incorporated into new plants, expansions, or revamps, payback can occur in as little as six months. When adapted to existing installations, payback may require 12 to 18 months depending on the extent of new hardware necessary. Because it is a positive displacement device, the HPRM torque and speed are almost completely independent - unlike <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> recovery turbines (centrifugal motors). Three screw HPRM's have low moments of inertia, operate at low vibration and noise levels and extract power in the 70 - 85 % efficiency range. Output power levels to 600 hp and differential pressures to 2500 psi are possible. A primary application for the HPRM is driving process pumps. Where a full capacity process pump is used, an HPRM can through-drive it augmenting the primary driver and reducing power requirements by Higher speed special designs also are available 75 %...|$|R
50|$|Boulton Paul {{was one of}} the {{two main}} innovators of gun turret designs for British aircraft, along with Nash & Thomson; they {{supplied}} large numbers of installations for British aircraft. Boulton Paul's designs were largely based on originals licensed from the French company SAMM (Societe d'Application des Machines Motrices), while Nash & Thomson concentrated on the FN designs originated by the firm's co-founder, Archibald Frazer-Nash.Boulton Paul's turrets were electro-hydraulic in operation; electric motors located in the turret drove <b>hydraulic</b> pumps that <b>powered</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>motors</b> and rams. This was more effective than electric motors alone, and did not require power developed by the aircraft's engines as did the hydraulic system utilized by the Nash & Thomson design. Production was transferred to Joseph Lucas Ltd.|$|R
50|$|Oscillating devices do {{not have}} a {{rotating}} component, instead making use of aerofoil sections which are pushed sideways by the flow. Oscillating stream power extraction was proven with the omni- or bi-directional Wing'd Pump windmill. During 2003 a 150 kW oscillating hydroplane device, the Stingray, was tested off the Scottish coast. The Stingray uses hydrofoils to create oscillation, which allows it to create <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power.</b> This <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> is then used to <b>power</b> a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>motor,</b> which then turns a generator.|$|R
50|$|A <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> {{steering}} (HPS) uses {{hydraulic pressure}} supplied by an engine-driven pump {{to assist the}} motion of turning the steering wheel. Electric power steering (EPS) is more efficient than <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> steering, since the electric <b>power</b> steering <b>motor</b> only needs to provide assistance when the steering wheel is turned, whereas the hydraulic pump must run constantly. In EPS, the amount of assistance is easily tunable to the vehicle type, road speed, and even driver preference. An added benefit is the elimination of environmental hazard posed by leakage and disposal of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> steering fluid. In addition, electrical assistance is not lost when the engine fails or stalls, whereas hydraulic assistance stops working if the engine stops, making the steering doubly heavy as the driver must now turn not only the very heavy steering—without any help—but also the power-assistance system itself.|$|R

40|$|Coal is a {{soft and}} brittle material. Drilling {{rates in the}} Pittsburgh coalbed using a drag bit exceed 3 ft/min at 2, 500 -pound thrust. However, {{maintaining}} the bit on a horizontal trajectory or parallel to bedding planes to attain lengths of 1, 000 feet is difficult. This Bureau of Mines report presents a drill string configuration that can be guided through the coalbed. The angle of the borehole is measured periodically and by proper combinations of bit thrust and rotational speed (r/min), bit trajectory can be lifted or dropped to keep the bit in the coalbed. An example of a hole drilled to 2, 126 feet is presented to show levels of thrust and rotational speed used to lift or drop the bit, the seemingly unexplainable events that occur, and the strategy used during drilling. Thrust levels during drilling range from 600 to 2, 500 pounds. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>motors</b> <b>powered</b> by a 30 -hp, 440 -volt <b>motor</b> provide ample <b>power</b> for drilling horizontal holes 2, 000 feet long...|$|R

40|$|Pigs {{have been}} {{reported}} to present with a stronger pulmonary vascular reactivity than many other species, including dogs. We investigated the pulmonary vascular impedance response to autologous blood clot embolic pulmonary hypertension in anesthetized and ventilated minipigs (n = 6) and dogs (n = 6). Before embolization, minipigs, compared with dogs, presented with higher mean pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa; by an average of 9 mmHg), a steeper slope of Ppa-flow (Q) relationships, and higher 0 -Hz impedance (Z 0) and first-harmonic impedance (Z 1), without significant differences in characteristic impedance (Zc), and a lower ratio of pulsatile <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> to total <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power.</b> Embolic pulmonary hypertension (mean Ppa: 40 - 55 mmHg) was associated with increased Z 0 and Z 1 in both species, but the minipigs had a steeper slope of Ppa/Q plots and an increased Zc. At identical Q and Ppa, minipigs still presented with higher Z 1 and Zc and a lower ratio of pulsatile <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> to total <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power.</b> The energy transmission ratio, defined as the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> in the measured waves divided by the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> in the forward waves, was better preserved after embolism in minipigs. No differences in wave reflection indexes were found before and after embolism. We conclude that minipigs, compared with dogs, present with a higher pulmonary vascular resistance and reactivity and adapt to embolic pulmonary hypertension by an increased Zc without earlier wave reflection. These differences allow for a reduced pulsatile component of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> and, therefore, a better energy transfer from the right ventricle to the pulmonary circulation.
