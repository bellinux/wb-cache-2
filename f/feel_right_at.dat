500|$|Wasteland Angel {{received}} average reviews upon release, garnering {{a rating}} of 55% on the review aggregation website GameRankings. Gamers Daily News' Jeff Lindsey appreciated the perspective change accompanying the bonus level, stating, [...] "To be perfectly honest, I squealed with delight when I {{got to see the}} carnage first hand and create mayhem before your eyes." [...] Strategy Informer was not as appreciative of the jump in perspective, noting that the game's maps and engine {{did not appear to be}} designed for the first-person perspective and the mode instead presented itself as [...] "more than a little jarring." [...] While Travis Huinker of Gaming Nexus criticized the game for having poor driving physics, Shack News's Jeff Mattas enjoyed the controls, stating, [...] "Though there are certain liberties taken with the driving physics, they <b>feel</b> <b>right</b> <b>at</b> home with the frantic, arcade-style action."

2500|$|In 2007, Terpening {{published}} a contemporary international suspense thriller, Nine Days in October, “his most successful fictional {{foray into the}} murk of international crime.” Jonathan Pearce (California State University, Stanislaus-Stockton), writing in Library Journal, says that Terpening “gets his latest book off to a slam-bang start in Rome with a botched heist by terrorists. During the robbery, a visiting American professor is wounded and his daughter kidnapped, possibly for ransom.” Set in 1988, as competing government security organizations are preparing to welcome both the Soviet premier and the U.S. president to Italy, the novel’s complex plot, Pearce says, “revolves around a... professor's attempts to find his child while he is unknowingly trapped in an assassination scheme involving rogue CIA agents, venal U.S. executives, Soviet oligarchs, and corrupt Italian security officials.” He concludes that “The reader roots for a weary Italian security officer {{to do his job}} better than the villains do theirs. The author's research is evidently extensive, the writing competent, the suspense gripping, and the characterization of beastly adversaries and noble protagonists effective. The sense of place is bolstered with such an abundance of native vocabulary and street and building names that Italophiles will <b>feel</b> <b>right</b> <b>at</b> home.” ...|$|E

[...] Polygon's Chelsea Stark and Jeff Ramos also praised the revised core mechanics, saying that the new tag system opened more options for clever combo creation. Similarly, IGN's Darry Huskey was impressed by the game's willingness to [...] "completely [...] traditions fans have known since X-Men vs. Street Fighter in 1996" [...] by overhauling time-honored game mechanics, such as the assist system. Additionally, Huskey described the decision to replace each team's third character with an Infinity Stone as the [...] "crown jewel" [...] of Infinites design, claiming that it [...] "works so well, it makes the very idea of a three-character team now seem like old news."

500|$|The {{direction}} of the band is dominated by chief guitarist, lead vocalist, and principal songwriter Billy Corgan. Journalist Greg Kot wrote, [...] "The music [...] would not be what it is without his ambition and vision, and his famously fractured relationships with his family, friends, and bandmembers." [...] Melissa Auf der Maur commented upon news of the group's reunion, [...] "Everyone knows Billy doesn't need too many people to make a Pumpkins record, other than Jimmy —who he has on board." [...] In a 2015 interview Corgan himself referred to the current iteration of the band [...] "as sort of an open source collective" [...] noting that [...] "It's whoever <b>feels</b> <b>right</b> <b>at</b> the time.". Many of Corgan's lyrics for the Pumpkins are cathartic expressions of emotion, full of personal musings and strong indictments of himself and those close to him. Music critics were not often fans of Corgan's angst-filled lyrics. Jim DeRogatis wrote in a 1993 Chicago Sun-Times article that Corgan's lyrics [...] "too often sound like sophomoric poetry", although he viewed the lyrics of later albums Adore and Machina as an improvement. Corgan responded to DeRogatis' words with [...] "fuck the Sun-Times", at the band's 1993 show at the Metro Chicago.|$|R

40|$|This study investigates why non-representational {{photographs}} are accepted as abstract art {{even though they}} remain tight to reality. By analysing this acceptance, this thesis also examines the purpose of non-figurative photographs and asks why the genre has become more prevalent in our contemporary environment. The {{first part of this}} investigation analysed photography and abstraction conceptually. Neither term can be given an all-round ontological definition, as they are too diverse and change over time. In today’s surroundings, technological advances have great influence: photography has become an embedded tool that is over-used. The viewer is overwhelmed and needs to be motivated to engage with the work. In our Internet- driven, data-sharing environment, abstraction has also become part of everyday living. Therefore, abstract art as a model of reduction has lost its function. Today, abstract art is based on the paradigm of complexity. The second part of this thesis studies the work of photographers Wolfgang Tillmans, James Welling and Thomas Ruff. These artists show how non-figurative photographs can generate engagement from the audience. By offering unclear representations, the artists have underlined the inherently abstract nature of the medium. The result of my study suggests that contemporary abstract art is perceived from a new perspective. It is irrelevant to acknowledge abstraction and representation as paradoxical, as they have become the same. Ironically, photography thereby became an impeccable tool for producing abstract art. The results may never be fully disconnected from the world; nonetheless, the medium is located in an abstract position, which in our contemporary surroundings <b>feels</b> <b>right</b> <b>at</b> place...|$|R
30|$|For our BADAS Study, we {{developed}} and validated BD Sx to enable ecological momentary sampling [EMS (Wenze and Miller 2010)] of hypo/manic and depressive symptoms using the iOS app {{we developed}} for iPad and iPhone (King et al. 2016). It {{is essential that}} EMS measurement be rapid and reliable with low cognitive load (Choi and Lee 2012). In order to minimize missing data, EMS questionnaires must be brief with low cognitive demands. This {{is especially true for}} BD research when participants are acutely symptomatic. For the BD Sx, we adopted the format used for frequent measurement of mood and mood variability developed with non-clinical populations [e.g., POMS (Heuchert and McNair 2012), PANAS (Watson et al. 1998)]. In other words, we compiled a set of mood adjectives measuring both hypo/manic and depressive symptoms, asking respondents to specify how each describes how they <b>feel</b> <b>right</b> now, <b>at</b> this moment.|$|R
5000|$|After a {{stint as}} a {{mercenary}} quelling a revolt in Nemedia, Conan loses everything but his sword gambling with cronies. A man follows him from the tavern and hires the Cimmerian to obtain a mysterious but valuable item. Outfitting himself with the initial payment, Conan proceeds {{to the city of}} Sicas in Aquilonia. Once renowned for its silver mines but now a den of iniquity, more people are said to leave Sicas 'by the river, floating', than through the gates. On the way he rescues a woman in quest of her missing sister, said to have gone to the same place. Sicas turns out to be {{in the midst of a}} conflict between numerous contenders for control and loot, most notably the king's corrupt reeve, five different gangs and a religious cult. Conan <b>feels</b> <b>right</b> <b>at</b> home, and plunges into the struggle. Various intrigues and betrayals follow in rapid succession, centering on the object he has been commissioned to recover, which is revealed as a potent magical artifact. The rising tension in Sicas results in an all out major brawl in the middle of town between the gangs and various power players. In contrast to most of the players, Conan emerges from Sicas ahead of the game, passing by royal forces en route to the town to restore order. Questioned as to how he did it, he responds [...] "That was a town of rogues, my friend, and I am the greatest rogue of all." [...] At the end, with some new comrades, Conan heads toward Tarantia as he hears news of civil war brewing in Aquilonia.|$|R
