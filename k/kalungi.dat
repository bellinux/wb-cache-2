30|$|Among the {{watersheds}} of {{the study}} area the form factor values ranges from 0.17 (<b>Kalungi</b> watershed) to 0.53 (Sendarapatti watershed). Among the watersheds {{of the study}} area the estimated form factor value is low (≤  0.25) in <b>Kalungi,</b> Silaiyur, Belur, Kallar and Valaiyur watersheds, and high (>  0.40) in Sendarapatti, Thalugai, Nakkaselam and Shobanapuram watersheds. In rest of the other watersheds it is moderate (0.26 – 0.40). The form factor values estimated for the watersheds {{of the study area}} shows that it ranges from 0.17 (<b>Kalungi</b> watershed) to 0.53 (Sendarapatti watershed) which reflect the elongated shape of all the watersheds, and the variation in form factor values among the watersheds reflects only the degree of elongation of the watersheds.|$|E
30|$|The {{analysis}} of the estimated relief of the watersheds reveal that potential energy, denudation rate, the amount of sediment transported and discharge rate {{are likely to be}} higher in watersheds with higher relief such as Talugai, Shobanapuram, Kottarakunnu and <b>Kalungi</b> watersheds and are likely to be low in Nakkasalem, Thuraiyur Kalathur, Gangavalli and Pulambadi watersheds. The {{analysis of}} the relief ratio values of the watersheds reflects the steeper terrain condition, higher potential energy and intensity of erosion in watersheds with high relief ratio such as Solaimatti, Valaiyur and Thuraiyur Kalathur. However, the lower relief ratio values of Koneri, Gangavalli and Pulambadi watersheds reflect lesser steepness, and lesser potential energy and intensity of erosion. The higher relative relief values reflects higher denudation rates in Solaimatti, Valaiyur, Silaiyur and <b>Kalungi</b> watersheds whereas it is lower in Koneri, Gangavalli, Kottarakunnu, Belur and Pulambadi watersheds on account of lower relative relief values. The estimated higher ruggedness number values for Talugai, Shobanapuram, Sengattupatti and <b>Kalungi</b> watersheds reveal that the slopes are not only steep but also long, and further the peak discharge is relatively high these watersheds. In case of watersheds with lower ruggedness number such as Pulambadi, Nakkasalem, Valaiyur, Gangavalli and Thuraiyur Kalattur the slopes are less steep and lesser in length, and further the peak discharge is relatively low.|$|E
30|$|The {{infiltration}} {{number is}} the product of drainage density and stream frequency, and it reflects the infiltration potential of a watershed. Lower infiltration numbers indicate higher infiltration and lower run-off (Faniran 1968; Das and Mukherjee 2005; Joji et al. 2013; Elewa et al. 2016). Among the watersheds of the study area, the infiltration number ranges from 3.61 (Pulambadi) to 13.24 (Shobanapuram). Watersheds with lower infiltration number values (≤  6) include Pulambadi, Maruvattur, Silaiyur and Valaiyur watersheds and those with higher infiltration number (>  10) include Shobanapuram, Kallar, <b>Kalungi,</b> Sengattupatti, Periyakarruppu Odai and Thalugai watersheds. In rest of the watersheds it is moderate (7 – 10). This implies that in watersheds with lower infiltration values such as Pulambadi, Maruvattur, Silaiyur and Valaiyur watersheds infiltration potential is higher. In case of watersheds with higher infiltration number such as Shobanapuram, Kallar, <b>Kalungi,</b> Sengattupatti, Periyakarruppu Odai and Thalugai, infiltration potential is relatively lower.|$|E
30|$|Relative {{relief is}} {{considered}} to be the most reliable potential predictor of denudation rates (Ahnert 1970; Summerfield and Hulton 1994; Gunnel 1998). On account of the direct relationship between relative relief and denudation rates, it can be inferred that the denudation rates are likely to be higher in Solaimatti, Valaiyur, Silaiyur and <b>Kalungi</b> watersheds, lower in Koneri, Gangavalli, Kattarakunnu, Belur and Pulambadi watersheds, and moderate in rest of the other watersheds.|$|E
30|$|Apart {{from serving}} as an indices to infer the degree of {{branching}} of stream network within a watershed, it can also throw light upon {{the shape of the}} watersheds; high Rb values reflect elongated shape whereas low values reflect circular or rotund shape (Chow 1964). Assuming precipitation and other controls to be the same, elongate watersheds yield low but extended peak flow whereas rotund watersheds produce sharp peak (Chow 1964; Chorley 1969). In short, the lower the mean Rb of the watershed, the greater the probability of flash flood. In the study area the mean Rb is relatively lesser (≤  3.5) in Maruvattur, Thuraiyur Kalathur, Nakkasalem, Gangavalli, Koneri, Kanappadi and Sengattupatti watersheds, and relatively high (>  4.5) in Belur, Valaiyur, Kallar and <b>Kalungi</b> watersheds. In rest of the other watersheds it is moderate (3.5 – 4.5). This imples the relatively greater degree of branching, lesser elongation, and higher flash flood potential of Maruvattur, Thuraiyur Kalathur, Nakkasalem, Gangavalli, Koneri, Kanappadi and Sengattupatti watersheds, and lesser degree of branching, greater elongation and lesser flash flood potential of Belur, Valaiyur, Kallar and <b>Kalungi</b> watersheds.|$|E
30|$|The {{analysis}} of areal {{extent of the}} watersheds shows higher mean annual run off, higher mean discharge, lower sediment yield and lower flood discharge per unit area in larger watersheds such as Koneri, Thalugai and Kottarakkannu. Smaller watersheds such as Valaiyur, Thuraiyur Kalathur, Nakkasalem, Periyakaruppu Odai and Solaimati {{are likely to have}} lower mean annual run off, lower mean discharge, higher sediment yield and higher flood discharge per unit area. Among the watersheds Koneri, Kottarakunu, Talugai and Belur watersheds are longer whereas Nakkasalem, Thuraiyur Kalathur, Sendarapatti and Valaiyur are shorter. The low drainage density in the watersheds of Pulambadi, Valaiyur, Silaiyur and Maruvattur reflects the lower rainfall intensity, rock resistivity, mean annual run off and higher vegetation cover. In contrast, the high drainage density in the watersheds of Shobanapuram, Sengattuppatti, Thalugai, Kallar, Periyakaruppu Odai and <b>Kalungi</b> reflects the higher rainfall intensity, rock resistivity, mean annual run off and lower vegetation cover. The analysis the estimated stream frequency values reveals that Maruvattur, Pulambadi, Silaiyur and Valaiyur are likely to have higher mean annual rainfall and lower degree of dissection and lower run off. On the other hand watersheds with high stream frequency values such as Kallar, Shobanapuram, <b>Kalungi,</b> Belur and Sengattuppatti are likely to have lower mean annual rainfall and higher degree of dissection and higher run off. Shorter length of overland flow in Shobanapuram, Sengattupatti, Talugai, Kallar, Periyakarruppu Odai and <b>Kalungi</b> watersheds implies that rain water will enter the stream relatively quickly, and lesser rainfall is sufficient to contribute a significant volume of surface run off to stream discharge, and the lag time will be shorter making them flash flood prone. In case of watersheds with longer length of overland flow such as Pulambadi, Valaiyur, Silaiyur and Maruvattur watersheds rain water will take relatively more time to enter into the stream, and hence only in case of higher rainfall there would be significant volume of surface run off to stream discharge. Longer lag time in these watersheds implies easier flood management. The {{analysis of}} infiltration number reveals that infiltration potential is higher in Pulambadi, Maruvattur, Silaiyur and Valaiyur watersheds on account of lower infiltration number values. On the otherhand it is lower in Shobanapuram, Kallar, <b>Kalungi,</b> Sengattupatti, Periyakarruppu Odai and Thalugai watersheds in view of higher infiltration number.|$|E
30|$|Drainage density {{refers to}} the length of streams within a {{watershed}} per unit area (Horton 1932), and among the watersheds of the study area it ranges from 1.90 (Pulambadi watershed) to 3.40  km/sq. km (Shobanapuram watershed). It is low (<  2.30  km/sq. km) in Pulambadi, Valaiyur, Silaiyur and Maruvattur watersheds, high (>  2.90  km/sq. km) in Shobanapuram, Sengattuppatti, Thalugai, Kallar, Periyakaruppu Odai and <b>Kalungi</b> watersheds, and moderate (2.30 – 2.90  km/sq. km) in rest of the other watersheds.|$|E
30|$|Ruggedness number, {{the product}} of relief and {{drainage}} density is an index which reflects slope steepness and length. It was estimated using the relationship, Ruggedness Number = ((Drainage Density × Relief)/ 5280) as suggested by Hart (1986). The estimated ruggedness number value for the watersheds {{of the study area}} ranges from 0.17 (Pulambadi watershed) to 0.64 (Thalugai watershed). The ruggedness number is relatively high (>  0.45) in Talugai, Shobanapuram, Sengattupatti and <b>Kalungi</b> watersheds, low (≤  0.25) in Pulambadi, Nakkasalem, Valaiyur, Gangavalli and Thuraiyur Kalattur watersheds, and moderate (0.26 – 0.45) in rest of the watersheds.|$|E
30|$|Stream {{number of}} a {{watershed}} {{refers to the}} number of stream segments within a watershed. Estimations regarding order-wise stream number and total number of streams in each watershed were made and their analysis shows the existence of wide variation in the total number of streams among the watersheds of the study area ranging from 30 (in Valaiyur watershed) to 458 (Koneri watershed). The number of stream segments decreases with increasing stream order in all the watersheds of the study area. Among the various stream orders, the proportion of first-order streams, constitute bulk {{of the total number of}} streams in all the watersheds, ranging from 68.89 % (in Thuraiyur Kalathur watershed) to 82.05 % (<b>Kalungi</b> watershed). It is observed that the lower order streams, viz., both first and second-order streams constitute most of the streams in each watershed and their proportion ranges from 90.59 % (in Maruvattur watershed) to 96.67 % (Valaiyur watershed) of the total streams of the respective watersheds. In the study area, the lower order streams are relatively greater in proportion (>  95 %) in Valaiyur, Belur, <b>Kalungi,</b> Solaimatti and Kallar watersheds which reflects the steeper slopes and quicker water flow in these watersheds. The lower order streams are relatively lesser (≤  92 %) in Nakkasalem, Maruvattur, Thuraiyur Kalathur and Talugai watersheds, and this reflects the relatively lesser slope steepness and less quick stream flows.|$|E
30|$|Relative relief, {{introduced}} by Melton (1957) is the ratio between the relief and {{perimeter of the}} watershed. It has the advantage over relief ratio {{in that it is}} not dependent on the basin length which is questionable parameter in oddly shaped watersheds. For the watersheds of the study area, the estimated relative relief values vary from 11.94 (Koneri watershed) to 31.31 (Solaimatti watershed). The relative relief values are higher (>  25) for Solaimatti, Valaiyur, Silaiyur and <b>Kalungi</b> watersheds, lower (≤  19) for Koneri, Gangavalli, Kottarakunnu, Belur and Pulambadi watersheds, and moderate (20 – 25) {{for the rest of the}} other watersheds.|$|E
30|$|Stream {{frequency}} {{is directly}} related to the degree of dissection (Pankaj and Kumar 2009) and run off (Sujata Biswas and Sudhakar Desai 1999), and inversely related to mean annual rainfall (Morisawa 1962). This implies that watersheds with low stream frequency values such as Maruvattur, Pulambadi, Silaiyur and Valaiyur are likely to have higher mean annual rainfall and lower degree of dissection and lower run off. On the other hand watersheds with high stream frequency values such as Kallar, Shobanapuram, <b>Kalungi,</b> Belur and Sengattuppatti are likely to have lower mean annual rainfall and higher degree of dissection and higher run off.|$|E
30|$|Length of {{overland}} flow which {{is half the}} reciprocal of drainage density (Horton 1945) is {{used to describe the}} length of flow of water over the ground before it becomes concentrated in definite stream channels. Among the watersheds of the study area, it ranges from 0.59  km (Shobanapuram watershed) to 1.05  km (Pulambadi watershed). The length of {{overland flow}} is shorter (≤  0.70  km) in Shobanapuram, Sengattupatti, Talugai, Kallar, Periyakarruppu Odai and <b>Kalungi</b> watersheds, longer (>  0.90  km) in Pulambadi, Valaiyur, Silaiyur and Maruvattur watersheds, and is moderate in rest of the other watersheds (0.70 – 0.90  km).|$|E
30|$|Among the {{watersheds}} of {{the study}} area the mean length of first-order streams ranges from 0.52  km (for Belur watershed) to 0.84  km (Maruvattur watershed). It is shorter (<  0.60  km) in Belur and <b>Kalungi</b> watersheds, and longer (>  0.75  km) in Maruvattur and Solaimatti watersheds. In other watersheds it is moderate (0.60 – 0.75  km). In case of second-order streams the mean length ranges from 0.60  km (Solaimatti watershed) to 1.65  km (Silaiyur watershed). It is found to be shorter (<  0.75  km) in Solaimatti, Nakkaselam and Belur watersheds and longer (>  1.25  km) in Silaiyur, Pulambadi, Maruvattur and Thuraiyur Kalathur watersheds. In other watersheds it is moderate (>  0.75 – 1.25  km).|$|E
30|$|Most of the {{watersheds}} of {{the study}} area are either fourth or fifth order watersheds. The trunk stream of the watersheds is found to be medium stream with the exception of Valaiyur watershed where it is a headwater stream. The number of streams decreases with increasing stream order in all the watersheds {{of the study}} area. The lower order (first and second order) streams constitute very high proportion (ranging from about 91 to 97 %), of the streams of the watersheds, characteristic of hilly watersheds. The analysis of the proportion of lower order streams of the watersheds shows that Valaiyur, Belur, <b>Kalungi,</b> Solaimatti and Kallar watersheds are characteristic of steeper slopes and quicker water flow, whereas Nakkasalem, Maruvattur, Thuraiyur Kalathur and Talugai watersheds are less steeper with relatively lesser water flow velocity. The distinct variation of bifurcation ratio values among various orders in each watershed, reflects the variations in local physiography and geological conditions within each watershed. The analysis of mean bifurcation ration values of the watersheds shows that the drainage network in all the watersheds {{of the study area}} is well developed. It also shows the relatively greater degree of branching, lesser elongation, and higher flash flood potential of Maruvattur, Thuraiyur Kalathur, Nakkasalem, Gangavalli, Koneri, Kanappadi and Sengattupatti watersheds, and lesser degree of branching, greater elongation and lesser flash flood potential of Belur, Valaiyur, Kallar and <b>Kalungi</b> watersheds. The mean annual run off would be higher in Koneri, Thalugai, Shobanapuram and Kottarakkannu watersheds on account of their high total stream lengths, and relatively lower in Valaiyur, Nakkaselam, Thuraiyur Kalathur, Silaiyur, Solaimatti, Pulambadi and Periyakaruppu Odai watersheds on account of their low total stream lengths. In general, it is observed that the mean stream length increases with the stream order in almost all the watersheds.|$|E
30|$|The stream {{frequency}} is {{the ratio}} between {{the total number}} of stream segments of all orders in a watershed and the basin/watershed area (Horton 1945). It refers to the number of streams per unit area. Estimation of stream frequency value for the watersheds of the study area shows that it ranges from 1.89 (Maruvattur watershed) to 4.06 streams/sq. km (Kallar watershed). Based on the estimated stream frequency values, the watersheds were grouped as those with low (<  2.5 streams/sq. km), moderate (2.6 – 3.5 streams/sq. km) and high stream frequency (>  3.5 streams/sq. km). The analysis of stream frequency values of the watersheds of the study area shows that the stream frequency is low in Maruvattur, Pulambadi, Silaiyur and Valaiyur watersheds and is high in Kallar, Shobanapuram, <b>Kalungi,</b> Belur and Sengattuppatti watersheds.|$|E
30|$|It is {{the ratio}} of the mean length of streams of one order to that of the next higher order. It tends to be {{constant}} throughout the successive orders of a watershed (Horton 1945). Estimation of length ratio and the mean length ratio for the various stream orders of the watersheds and for each watershed were made. Variations in length ratio exist between successive stream orders in all the watersheds of the study area and such differences are commonly observed in several other studies (Horton 1945; Mesa 2006). These differences are attributed mainly due to differences in slope and topographic conditions within the watersheds. Among the watersheds of the study area, the mean length ratio is found to range from 0.41 (for Belur watershed) to 3.37 (Gangavalli watershed). The ratio is low (≤  0.50) in Belur, <b>Kalungi</b> and Valaiyur watersheds and high (>  0.90) in Gangavalli, Maruvattur and Koneri watersheds. In rest of the other watersheds it is moderate (0.51 – 0.90).|$|E
30|$|Extremely high {{values of}} the {{ruggedness}} number occur when both variables are large, i.e., when slopes are not only steep but long as well (Chow 1964). Further, it {{is found to be}} directly proportional to relative peak discharge (Patton 1988). From the relationship ruggedness number possesses with slope and relative peak discharge put forward by Chow (1964), {{it is likely that the}} slopes are steep and long, and also the peak discharge is relatively high in Talugai, Shobanapuram, Sengattupatti and <b>Kalungi</b> watersheds, where the estimated ruggedness number value is high, whereas slopes are less steep and lesser in length, and the peak discharge is relatively low in watersheds such as Pulambadi, Nakkasalem, Valaiyur, Gangavalli and Thuraiyur Kalattur where the estimated ruggedness number value is low. In other watersheds, the slope is likely to be moderately steep and of moderate length, and the peak discharge is relatively moderate on account of their moderate ruggedness number.|$|E
30|$|In {{watersheds}} with shorter {{length of}} overland flow values, rain water {{will enter the}} stream relatively quickly, and lesser rainfall is sufficient to contribute a significant volume of surface run off to stream discharge. Also this factor has an important control over lag time (Chorley 1969) {{due to the fact}} that the mean velocity of the unconcentrated overland flow is less than concentrated channel flow. Smaller values can cause flooding in days of heavy rain, due to the reduced possibility of water infiltration into the soil (Olszevski et al. 2011). From the above inferences, it is evident that in watersheds with shorter length of overland flow values such as Shobanapuram, Sengattupatti, Talugai, Kallar, Periyakarruppu Odai and <b>Kalungi,</b> rain water will enter the stream relatively quickly, and lesser rainfall is sufficient to contribute a significant volume of surface run off to stream discharge, and the lag time will be shorter making them flash flood prone. On the other hand, rain water will take relatively more time to enter into the stream, and hence only in case of higher rainfall there would be significant volume of surface run off to stream discharge in Pulambadi, Valaiyur, Silaiyur and Maruvattur watersheds where the length of overland flow is longer. This implies that the lag time is likely to be longer in these watersheds resulting in lesser flash flood risk in these four watersheds.|$|E
30|$|Stream ordering, {{the first}} step in morphometric {{analysis}} of drainage basin analysis, {{is a measure of the}} position of a stream in the hierarchy of tributaries (Strahler 1964). As mentioned earlier, for the present study the widely followed Strahler’s method of stream ordering has been adopted towards ordering the streams of the drainage network in all the watersheds of the study area. Such ordering of the streams is an essential input towards estimating several other drainage morphometric parameters considered for the present study. Besides this, it has been used to find out the maximum stream order (the stream segment of the highest order) within each watershed. This maximum stream order, viz., the trunk stream, through which all the discharge of a watershed finds its outlet, has been used to designate each watershed of the study area. Among the watersheds of the study area, the maximum stream order ranges from third order to sixth order. A majority of the watersheds (55 %) are fourth order watersheds and these include Sendarapatti, Kallar, Belur, Pulambadi, Periyakaruppu Odai, <b>Kalungi,</b> Solaimatti, Silaiyur, Chinnar, Nakkaselam and Turaiyur Kalathur watersheds, followed by fifth order watersheds (35 %) which includes Gangavalli, Kottarakkannu, Sengattuppatti, Maruvattur, Kannapadi, Shobanapuram and Thalugai watersheds. Koneri watershed and Valiyur watershed are the only sixth order and third order watershed, respectively, in the study area.|$|E
30|$|Drainage density {{has been}} used by a number of workers to {{describe}} wide ranging characters within a watershed/basin. Studies have shown that drainage density {{is one of the most}} sensitive and variable morphometric parameters and it has direct relationship with rainfall intensity (Chorley 1957 a, b; Chorley and Morgan 1962), rock resistivity (Zavoianu 1985; Gardiner 1996; Sangireddy et al. 2016), mean annual run off (Morisawa 1962), and an inverse relationship with the degree of development of a drainage net within a basin (Horton 1945), infiltration capacity (Horton 1945; Melton 1957), permeability (Strahler 1956; Zavoianu 1985), vegetation cover (Chorley 1957 a, b) and texture of landscape dissection and spacing of streams (Chorley 1969). Drainage density affects the run off pattern, in that a high drainage density removes surface run off rapidly, decreasing the lag time and increasing the peak of the hydrograph (Chorley 1969). From the above described relationship drainage density has with several drainage basin characteristics, it can be inferred that on account of low drainage density, Pulambadi, Valaiyur, Silaiyur and Maruvattur watersheds are likely to have lower rainfall intensity, lower rock resistivity, lower mean annual run off, higher infiltration capacity/permeability, higher vegetation cover and are well drained. On the other hand, in the watersheds of Shobanapuram, Sengattuppatti, Thalugai, Kallar, Periyakaruppu Odai and <b>Kalungi,</b> on account of their high drainage density, the rainfall intensity, rock resistivity and mean annual run off are likely to be high whereas the infiltration capacity/permeability and vegetation cover are likely to be lower, and further these watersheds are less well drained.|$|E
30|$|The {{shape of}} the {{watershed}} influences {{the way in which}} floods are formed and move. It is known that floods are formed and travel more rapidly in a circular watershed which implies that and floods are stronger and have a higher velocity (Zavoianu 1985) in such watersheds. This {{is due to the fact}} that in a circular basin run off from various parts of the basin reach the outlet at the same time resulting in a shorter lag time and a higher peak flow (Zavoianu 1985; Waugh 1995). In case of elongated basins, the tributaries flow into the main stream at greater intervals of time and space and this broader distribution of flow path lengths and, therefore, a wide range of travel time results in lower peak flow of longer duration. This implies that the flood flows are easier to manage in elongated basins whereas in case of circular basins it is difficult to manage. Though the form factor values clearly reflect the absence of a perfectly circular watershed and hence the absence of any highly flood prone watershed in the study area, it is possible to identify watersheds which are the least, and moderately prone for flash floods. The five watersheds viz., <b>Kalungi,</b> Silaiyur, Belur, Kallar and Valaiyur watersheds which are highly elongated as revealed from their low form factor values are the watersheds least prone for flash flood whereas the five watersheds, viz., Sendarapatti, Thalugai, Nakkaselam, Turaiyur Kalathur and Shobanapuram which are less elongated on account of their relatively higher form factor values are moderately prone for flash floods.|$|E
