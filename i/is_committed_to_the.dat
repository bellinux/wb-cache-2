25|$|The Ceramic Technology Laboratory was {{established}} in 1977 {{under the direction of}} Dr. Prudence Rice, then UF professor of Anthropology. Pottery analysis plays an integral role in archaeological research at the museum as it constitutes the predominant material remaining at most archaeological sites investigated by museum curators. In addition pottery constitutes a very significant proportion of the Anthropology collections. The Ceramic Technology Laboratory is equipped for basic paste characterization studies: binocular microscope for gross identification of temper or paste constituents; a petrographic microscope for precise mineral identification in thin section; an electric furnace used for refiring experiments and for comparative investigation of clay samples collected from the vicinity of archaeological sites. Analysis of physical and mineralogical properties of the pottery are undertaken to provide precise data to address research questions regarding chronology, provenience or manufacturing origins, processes of production, culture change, and the development of social and economic complexity in prehistoric Florida, the Southeastern US, and the Caribbean Basin. The department <b>is</b> <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> continuance of this research program as the capacity for in-house specialized analysis of pottery enhances the competitiveness for research grants.|$|E

500|$|In 2009 Mehldau also {{recorded}} Highway Rider, an album that combined his usual trio with guest musicians and a 28-piece orchestra. Again based compositionally {{on the theme}} of travel or a journey, the album was produced by Brion, and, in critic Mike Hobart's description, [...] "probes the confluence of the arbitrary and non-arbitrary in music, of balancing what <b>is</b> <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> page with improvisation." [...] This was pursued further in the winter of 2010–11, in public performances of pieces from the album in the US and Europe. Mehldau's trio returned to the studio {{for the first time in}} several years in 2008 and again in 2011, resulting in Ode, an album of the pianist's originals, and Where Do You Start, an album of covers. Down Beat reviewer Jim Macnie commented that, on the former album, [...] "More than ever, Mehldau uses his instrument as a drum, popping staccato notes into the maw of the rhythm section's formidable bustle." ...|$|E
500|$|In [...] "The Born-Again Identity", it's {{revealed}} that Castiel survived. After the Leviathans left him, {{he made his}} way out of the river, naked, and ran into his future wife Daphne. However, the experience renders Castiel amnesic, but with his angelic powers intact. Going by the name [...] "Emanuel", Castiel used his powers to heal people, though he didn't know where that ability and his power to see demon's true faces came from. After Sam is committed to a mental hospital as a result of the hallucinations of Lucifer he is suffering due to Castiel breaking his [...] "mental wall", Dean searches for [...] "Emanuel" [...] and kills a demon that is holding his wife hostage. Castiel agrees to help Dean who doesn't tell him who he really is, but mentions what [...] "Cas" [...] had done to Sam. The two are joined by Meg, but upon reaching the hospital, find demons surrounding the entrance. As Castiel is the only one who can take them all down, Dean is forced to tell him the truth about who he really is and insists he has the power to kill the demons. Castiel manages to summon his power to kill demons and kills all of them, but doing so restores his memories. Castiel shows remorse for his previous actions and initially wants to leave, but Dean is able to convince him to help by giving him back his trench coat. Castiel finds Sam in time to save him from a demon torturing him to death with electro-shock therapy and tries to restore his mental wall, but can't as it's completely gone. Feeling sorry for what he had done, Castiel transfers the problem to himself and is haunted by visions of Lucifer like Sam was. Castiel <b>is</b> <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mental hospital, but is safe from the demons as only Meg knows he's alive and she takes a job at the hospital, presumably to look after him. In [...] "Party On, Garth", Dean calls Meg and she reveals that Castiel's in the same condition, which Sam feels guilty about.|$|E
