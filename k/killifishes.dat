25|$|The {{beginning}} of the evolutionary process of livebearing starts with facultative (optional) internal bearing. The process occurs in several species of oviparous (egg-laying) <b>killifishes</b> which spawn in the normal way on the substrate, {{but in the process}} accidentally fertilize eggs which the female retains and does not spawn. These eggs are spawned later, usually without allowing much time for embryonic development.|$|E
500|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} {{exists in}} some species. Individuals of one sex, usually males develop {{secondary sexual characteristics}} that increase their chances of reproductive success. In dolphinfish, males have larger and blunter heads than females. In several minnow species, males develop swollen heads and small bumps known as breeding tubercles during the breeding season. The male green humphead parrotfish has a more well-developed forehead with an [...] "ossified ridge" [...] which {{plays a role in}} ritualised headbutting. Dimorphism can also take the form of differences in coloration. Again, it is usually the males that are brightly coloured; in <b>killifishes,</b> rainbowfishes and wrasses the colours are permanent while in species like minnows, sticklebacks, darters and sunfishes, the colour changes with seasons. Such coloration can be very conspicuous to predators, showing that the drive to reproduce can be stronger than that to avoid predation.|$|E

50|$|Banded <b>killifish</b> {{have been}} found to engage in {{heterospecific}} shoaling with other species of <b>killifish</b> as well as other fish. There are many situational factors that determine if the banded <b>killifish</b> individual would want to engage in heterospecific shoaling. If body size is similar, then banded <b>killifish</b> prefer conspecific shoals as opposed to heterospecific ones. Size is a sorting mechanism for conspecific as opposed to heterospecific shoaling.|$|R
5000|$|The banded <b>killifish</b> (Fundulus diaphanus) is a North American {{species of}} {{temperate}} freshwater <b>killifish</b> {{belonging to the}} Fundulus genus of the Fundulidae family. The natural geographic range extends from Newfoundland to South Carolina, and west to Minnesota. It includes the Great Lakes drainages. [...] The banded <b>killifish</b> is the only freshwater <b>killifish</b> found in the northeastern United States.

5000|$|A {{member of}} the family Fundulidae, the bayou <b>killifish</b> belongs {{to one of the most}} common orders of fish, Cyprinodontiformes, which {{includes}} most small aquarium topminnows and North American <b>killifish.</b> Discovered in 1892, the bayou <b>killifish</b> is one of over 1000 species of <b>killifish,</b> and remains a thriving species amongst many others in the oceans. Its scientific name derives from the Latin word [...] "fundus," [...] which literally means [...] "bottom," [...] and many view this as ironic since the fish is a type of topminnow. However, the name was coined for a bottom species of the Atlantic coast, being the least important of the fundulus mudfish. Bayou <b>killifish</b> are fairly small, and only grow to a maximum length of 7 cm. Given its size, the bayou <b>killifish</b> is fairly easy to spot in its natural environment. Living mostly in shallow waters, the male bayou <b>killifish</b> displays bright striped patterns of silver and olive-green, while the females are uniquely spotted.|$|R

50|$|The mummichog is {{very similar}} to the banded <b>killifish,</b> Fundulus diaphanus, and indeed the two species have been known to interbreed. The two species may overlap in their choice of habitat, but in general the banded <b>killifish</b> is more {{commonly}} found in freshwater, which is not the case for the mummichog. The banded <b>killifish</b> tends to have thin dark bars on a light side, whereas in the mummichog the bars are thin and light on a dark side. Internally, the banded <b>killifish</b> has 4-7 gill rakers, as opposed to 8-12 in the mummichog.|$|R

50|$|The blackspotted topminnow, Fundulus olivaceus, is {{a species}} of fish in the family Fundulidae: the topminnows and North American <b>killifishes.</b> It is native to the south-central United States, where it is known from the drainages of the Mississippi River from Illinois to the Gulf of Mexico and as far west as Galveston Bay.|$|E
5000|$|Although most <b>killifish</b> {{belonging}} to the Fundulidae family share similar characteristics, the Bayou <b>Killifish</b> displays {{its own set of}} definitive markings that contrast it from other closely related species of topminnows and <b>killifish.</b> F. pulvereus has a body shape resembling that of a minnow that one may see in a small tidal pool near an ocean, but it is usually easier to spot because of its size. Unlike many other minnows, the Bayou <b>Killifish</b> usually grows to a maximum length of 5 - 7 cm, enabling it to have the size it needs to defend itself, as well as the maneuverability of a much smaller fish. [...] All Bayou <b>Killifish,</b> both male and female, can be distinguished from other species of fish by their wide mouth.|$|R

40|$|Acute {{exposures}} to some individual {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs) and complex PAH mixtures are known to cause cardiac malformations and edema in the developing fish embryo. However, the heart {{is not the only}} organ impacted by developmental PAH exposure. The developing brain is also affected, resulting in lasting behavioral dysfunction. While acute {{exposures to}} some PAHs are teratogenically lethal in fish, {{little is known about the}} later life consequences of early life, lower dose subteratogenic PAH exposures. We sought to determine and characterize the long-term behavioral consequences of subteratogenic developmental PAH mixture exposure in both naive <b>killifish</b> and PAH-adapted <b>killifish</b> using sediment pore water derived from the Atlantic Wood Industries Superfund Site. <b>Killifish</b> offspring were embryonically treated with two low-level PAH mixture dilutions of Elizabeth River sediment extract (ERSE) (TPAH 5. 04 μg/L and 50. 4 μg/L) at 24 h post fertilization. Following exposure, <b>killifish</b> were raised to larval, juvenile, and adult life stages and subjected to a series of behavioral tests including: a locomotor activity test (4 days post-hatch), a sensorimotor response tap/habituation test (3 months post hatch), and a novel tank diving and exploration test (3 months post hatch). <b>Killifish</b> were also monitored for survival at 1, 2, and 5 months over 5 -month rearing period. Developmental PAH exposure caused short-term as well as persistent behavioral impairments in naive <b>killifish.</b> In contrast, the PAH-adapted <b>killifish</b> did not show behavioral alterations following PAH exposure. PAH mixture exposure caused increased mortality in reference <b>killifish</b> over time; yet, the PAH-adapted <b>killifish,</b> while demonstrating long-term rearing mortality, had no significant changes in mortality associated with ERSE exposure. This study demonstrated that early embryonic exposure to PAH-contaminated sediment pore water caused long-term locomotor and behavioral alterations in <b>killifish,</b> and that locomotor alterations could be observed in early larval stages. Additionally, our study highlights the resistance to behavioral alterations caused by low-level PAH mixture exposure in the adapted <b>killifish</b> population. Furthermore, this is the first longitudinal behavioral study to use <b>killifish,</b> an environmentally important estuarine teleost fish, and this testing framework can be used for future contaminant assessment...|$|R

50|$|Lucania is a genus of North American ray-finned <b>killifishes</b> in {{the family}} Fundulidae. It {{can be found in}} northeastern Mexico and the southeastern and eastern parts of the United States, with Lucania parva ranging as far north as Massachusetts. Adult {{specimens}} of this genus range from 2.9 to 6.0 cm in length. All species are oviparous and can live in fresh water, though L. parva - in spite of its name 'rainwater killifish' - is more typically a coastal fish found in salt or brackish water. L. goodei and L. parva are sometimes kept in aquariums, where they are considered hardy, adaptable aquarium residents.|$|E
50|$|When {{choosing}} which shoals to join, banded <b>killifish</b> often {{choose to}} join ones that consist of others with similar phenotypes. In {{order to achieve}} this, banded <b>killifish</b> have shown the ability to discriminate between individuals within the species. Banded <b>killifish</b> distinguish individuals by body coloration phenotype. Banded <b>killifish</b> are likely to enter shoals with those of similar body color {{in order to maximize}} predator avoidance. An individual of different color might present as a contrast. This contrast is likely to make the shoal stand out and gain the predator's attention. Banded killifishes' level of preference for similarly colored shoalmates differs in the presence and absence of a predatory stimulus.|$|R
40|$|Hydrogen {{sulphide}} is a toxicant naturally {{produced in}} hypoxic marine sediments, hydrocarbon and brine seeps and hydrothermal vents. The California <b>killifish,</b> a salt marsh resident, is remarkably tolerant of sulphide. The 50 % lethal concentration is 700 Î¼M total sulphide in 96 h, and 5 mM in 8 h (determined in flow-through, oxygenated sea water). <b>Killifish</b> exposed to sulphide produce thiosulphate which accumulates in the blood. The cytochrome c oxidase (a major site of toxicity) of the <b>killifish</b> is 50 % inhibited by < 1 Î¼M sulphide. <b>Killifish</b> liver mitochondria are poisoned by 50 â€“ 75 Î¼M sulphide but can oxidize 10 â€“ 20 Î¼M sulphide to thiosulphate. Sulphide causes sulphhaemoglobin formation (and impairment of oxygen transport) at 1 â€“ 5 mM in vitro {{and to a}} small extent at 2 mM in vivo. <b>Killifish</b> blood neither catalyses sulphide oxidation significantly nor binds sulphide at environmental (low) sulphide concentrations. Exposure to 200 Î¼M and 700 Î¼M sulphide over several days causes significant increases in lactate concentrations, indicating shift to anaerobic glycolysis. However, individuals with the most lactate die. In terms of diffusible H 2 S, the <b>killifish</b> can withstand concentrations two to three orders of magnitude greater than would poison cytochrome c oxidase. The high sulphide tolerance of the <b>killifish,</b> particularly of concentrations typical of salt marshes, can be explained chiefly by mitochondrial sulphide oxidation. Sulphide tolerance and mitochondrial sulphide oxidation in the <b>killifish</b> have a constitutive basis, i. e. do not diminish in fish held in the laboratory in sulphide-free water for 1 â€“ 2 months, and are improved by prior acclimation...|$|R
