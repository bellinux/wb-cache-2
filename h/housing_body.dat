50|$|The {{original}} ram BOPs of the 1920s {{were simple}} and rugged manual devices with minimal parts. The BOP <b>housing</b> (<b>body)</b> had a vertical well bore and horizontal ram cavity (ram guide chamber). Opposing rams (plungers) in the ram cavity translated horizontally, actuated by threaded ram shafts (piston rods) {{in the manner}} of a screw jack. Torque from turning the ram shafts by wrench or hand wheel was converted to linear motion and the rams, coupled to the inner ends of the ram shafts, opened and closed the well bore. Such screw jack type operation provided enough mechanical advantage for rams to overcome downhole pressures and seal the wellbore annulus.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Eggs {{from three}} strains of White Leghorn hens were stored up to 21 {{days prior to}} {{incubation}} in 1964 and 1965. Eggs stored longer than 7 days were packaged in Cryovac 2 bags with the air evacuated (1964) or flushed with nitrogen (1965) and held at about 12 C and 80 % relative humidity. Each year, all eggs were set together and incubated at 37. 5 C (29. 5 C wet bulb). At 18 days of incubation, eggs were candled, apparently infertile eggs removed, and incubation continued at 37. 0 C (32. 5 C wet bulb). Hens were housed at 147 days in floor pens in 1964 and in individual cages (20 x 41 cm) in 1965. Preincubation storage reduced hatchability of apparently fertile eggs. Preincubation storage affected only <b>housing</b> <b>body</b> weight (1964), egg weight (1964, 1965), Haugh units (1964, 1965), and blood spots (1965).

Pattern language has always been an attempt to integrate and unify patterns in the designing of a real project. Pattern language will only be useful after the completion of design work for analyses that are done on projects. But in fact, a set of interrelated patterns creates a framework by which it is possible to obtain any kind of design. Architectural plans that are consistent with a framework of Alexander’s patterns or foster and develop a framework of Alexander’s patterns will be felt more natural than other plans. In terms of objective, the present study is an applied research and it has been conducted by analytical-descriptive approach. In the present study, both quantitative and qualitative research techniques were applied for data collection. Also, data collection has been done by library research.

Please click on the {{hyperlink}} in Additional LinkBACKGROUND: Insomnia is a condition with a high prevalence and {{a great impact on}} quality of life. Little is known about the relation between and sleep disturbances and the home environment. AIM: To analyse the association between insomnia and building dampness. METHODS: In a cross-sectional, multicentre, population study, 16 190 subjects (mean age 40 years, 53 % women) were studied from Reykjavik in Iceland, Bergen in Norway, Umeå, Uppsala, and Göteborg in Sweden, Aarhus in Denmark, and Tartu in Estonia. Symptoms related to insomnia were assessed by questionnaire. RESULTS: Subjects living in houses with reported signs of building dampness (n = 2873) had a higher prevalence of insomnia (29. 4 v 23. 6 %; crude odds ratio 1. 35, 95 % CI 1. 23 to 1. 48). The association between insomnia and different indicators of building dampness was strongest for floor dampness: "bubbles or discoloration on plastic floor covering or discoloration of parquet floor" (crude odds ratio 1. 96, 95 % CI 1. 66 to 2. 32). The associations remained significant after adjusting for possible confounders such as sex, age, smoking history, <b>housing,</b> <b>body</b> mass index, and respiratory diseases. There {{was no significant difference between}} the centres in the association between insomnia and building dampness. CONCLUSION: Insomnia is more common in subjects living in damp buildings.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Regular {{physical}} activity has significant benefits for health. For instance, it {{can reduce the}} risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and osteoporosis, help control weight, and promote psychological well-being. There are many factors that can influence {{physical activity}}; socioeconomic status, family, size of place of residence, environmental conditions etc AIM: The aim {{of the study was to}} analyze physical activity and inactivity of adult population in the Olomouc region in terms of size of residence, type of <b>housing,</b> <b>body</b> weight status, smoking and participation in organized physical activity. METHODS: 1011 randomly selected residents of the Olomouc region (448 males and 563 females) aged 41. 14 &# 177; 8. 63 years participated in this study. To obtain selected indicators of physical activity, we used the ANEWS questionnaire which was distributed by university students in Spring and Fall periods from 2005 to 2009. For healthy adults aged 18 to 65 years, the goal recommended by the WHO is to achieve a minimum of 30 minutes of moderateintensity physical activity 5 days a week or at least 20 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity 3 days a week. RESULTS: The most physically active were males aged 36 - 45 years. From the selected correlates, those with the highest influence on total weekly PA were the size of residence and type of house. On the other hand, factors that did not affect total weekly PA were smoking, participation in organized PA and body mass index. The most commonly performed type of PA is cycling; followed in males with soccer and tennis and in women with aerobic dance and fitness walking. CONCLUSION: In the Olomouc region there is a need to preserve and develop the conditions to perform PA. Due to the landscape in the Olomouc region and due to the popularity of cycling, we recommend focus on this type of PA...|$|E
40|$|Population growth, {{increasing}} {{prosperity and}} urbanization are major {{challenges for the}} future that put pressure on land availability. Creating more high rise buildings is one option, but also the less explored subsurface construction could provide an increasing possibility. The question, however, is how subsurface construction compares environmentally to aboveground construction. In this research this is examined for a supermarket using the following research question: “How does a subsurface supermarket compare environmentally with an aboveground supermarket?” To give an {{answer to this question}} the LCA methodology was used. A subsurface supermarket in Brielle was used as a case study. An aboveground supermarket was designed based on the subsurface supermarket and used for comparison. The material use, energy use, transportation, and excavation were the elements of the life cycle that were examined within this research. Results were obtained using the software program SimaPro 8. The impact methodology chosen was the Hierarchist version of the ReCiPe midpoint methodology with the normalisation values of Europe. Results showed that the electricity use was the determining factor that caused the subsurface supermarket to come out worse. In practice, however, the parking space of the aboveground supermarket could also be placed on top or under the supermarket due to land availability. The elevators, which were the major cause of the electricity difference, would then also be needed for the aboveground building. The materials used in the <b>housing</b> <b>body</b> of the supermarket showed a more positive result for the subsurface supermarket, which was caused by the piles underneath the supermarket. The subsurface supermarket then still provides opportunities for the future. Uncertainties in the data and assumptions, like the lifetime, could in the end be an important factor in the chances of subsurface construction. Also missing information and impacts not taken into account by the LCA could change the result. Social and local impacts were not taken into account by the LCA. A social LCA or environmental impact assessment could give more insight in this. The depth and climate at which a subsurface building is located can be important factors to examine in the future. The technical feasibility of subsurface construction is also dependant on underground site characteristics and thus might not be an option for every location...|$|E
40|$|Pigs {{that are}} kept intensively and in groups may show {{excessive}} aggressive and/or manipulative behaviour. These behaviours may cause both welfare {{problems for the}} pigs and economic problems for the farmer. These problems may be solved by adjusting the environment the animals are kept in, and by (genetic) selection of animals. A social breeding value (SBV) has been designed {{that is used to}} estimate the heritable effect of an animal on the traits of its pen mates. Selecting for high social breeding values for the growth of pen mates might be an indirect way to reduce behavioural problems related to social interactions, but so far the effects of selecting for SBV for growth on behaviour and physiology of pigs are unknown. The main aim of the current {{study was to examine the}} relation between SBV, serotonin, Neutrophil to Lymphocyte (N/L) ratio, (abnormal) behaviour and aggression in animals with a high or low SBV, housed in an enriched or barren environment. The experiment was set up as a 2 x 2 arrangement, with SBV (high vs. low) and housing (barren or enriched) as factors. In total, 32 groups of pigs (192 animals) divided over two batches were used, the pigs were housed barren (partially slatted) or enriched (with sawdust and straw) in groups of six (1 : 1 sex ratio). Animals diverged in SBV, and half of the pigs were high SBV animals, with an average estimated genetic effect of + 2. 72 on average daily gain (ADG) of pen mates, and the other half were low SBV animals, with on average a negative effect of - 1. 5 g ADG on pen mates. To study both SBV and housing, behavioural observations in the home pen were conducted, a regrouping test (i. e. mixing of individuals from the same SBV) was performed, lesion and tail bite scores were recorded, and at three times some blood was taken from the pigs to determine N/L ratios and serotonin uptake velocity by platelets. Housing was found to have a greater impact on explorative, active and manipulative behaviour during this experiment than SBV, and no interactions were found between SBV and housing. Pigs in enriched pens were more active compared to barren housed animals, showed more explorative behaviour and less oral manipulation of pen mates. Furthermore, tail damage scores were lower in enriched <b>housing.</b> <b>Body</b> lesion scores after regrouping were not affected by housing, but under stable social conditions, pigs in enriched pens showed more lesions than barren housed pigs. SBV or its interaction with housing did not affect behaviour, body lesion scores or tail damage of pigs. SBV did affect platelet serotonin uptake velocity, with a higher uptake for the low SBV than for the high SBV pigs. Also N/L ratio was affected by SBV, with a higher N/L ratio in low SBV animals than in high SBV animals. Housing did not significantly influence serotonin (5 -HT) uptake or N/L ratio. In conclusion, SBV did not affect behaviour of pigs, but effects on physiological variables were found. It is possible that selection for a high SBV may genetically make the animals less prone to show damaging behaviours, but in the experimental environment or method of this study, this was not observed. Alternatively, as this study was part of a larger experiment, the sample size may have been too small to reveal potential effects of diverging SBVs on behaviour of pigs. Further research is needed to unravel which traits of pigs are changing when selecting for SBV for growth of pen mates. ...|$|E
