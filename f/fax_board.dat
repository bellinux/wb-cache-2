50|$|In 1985, Hank Magnuski, {{founder of}} GammaLink, {{produced}} the first computer <b>fax</b> <b>board,</b> called GammaFax. Such boards could provide voice telephony via Analog Expansion Bus.|$|E
50|$|Junk faxing {{came into}} {{widespread}} {{use in the}} late 1980s {{as a result of}} the development and proliferation of relatively inexpensive desktop fax machines which resulted in rapid growth in the number of fax machines in the U.S. The invention of the computer-based <b>fax</b> <b>board</b> in 1985 by Dr. Hank Magnuski, provided an efficient platform for reaching those fax machines with minimal cost and effort.|$|E
50|$|Its {{products}} include media servers, gateways and boards; load balancers, communications applications, softswitches, diameter signaling controller, session border controllers, signaling stacks and software, <b>fax</b> <b>boards</b> and FoIP software, and bandwidth optimization solutions. There {{are also}} products serving legacy markets like X.25 (Eiconcard).|$|R
5000|$|A {{fax modem}} enables a {{computer}} to transmit and receive documents as faxes on a telephone line. A fax modem is like a data modem but is designed to transmit and receive documents to and from a fax machine or another fax modem. Some, but not all, fax modems do double duty as data modems. As with other modems, fax modems can be internal or external. Internal fax modems are often called <b>fax</b> <b>boards.</b>|$|R
50|$|Alternatively {{the term}} fax server is {{sometimes}} {{used to describe}} a program that enables a computer to send and receive fax messages, set of software running on a server computer which is equipped {{with one or more}} fax-capable modems (or dedicated <b>fax</b> <b>boards)</b> attached to telephone lines or, more recently, software modem emulators which use T.38 ("Fax over IP") technology to transmit the signal over an IP network. Its function is to accept documents from users, convert them into faxes, and transmit them, as well as to receive fax calls and either store the incoming documents or pass them on to users. Users may communicate with the server in several ways, through either a local network or the Internet. In a big organization with heavy fax traffic, the computer hosting the fax server may be dedicated to that function, in which case the computer itself may also be known as a fax server.|$|R
40|$|By asking {{relevant}} {{questions and}} examining factors that typically exist in businesses planning {{to buy a}} fax server, such as how much existing and potentially new fax traffic will the fax server have to support, what are the peak hour requirements for faxing, what are the acceptable queuing delays when sending faxes, and others, this white paper presents cogent information for businesses {{to determine how many}} phone lines a fax server needs to suit their individual situations. This white paper also presents fax transmission rates and compression methods (MH, MR, MMR), as well fax speed and compression tables that can be useful for selecting a suitable <b>fax</b> <b>board.</b> Also, some special considerations are discussed, such as how many lines a fax server needs when sending and receiving faxes, and the consequences of installing too many or too few phones.

5000|$|In {{the early}} nineties, programmers {{increased}} {{the frequency of}} the top tier DES keys from monthly to near daily. Companies (such as Magna Systems) began offering services whereby users could continue to receive keys via <b>fax</b> electronic modifications/add-on <b>boards</b> such as [...] "VMS" [...] modems. These add-on modem modules would dial into a bulletin board system and automatically download the required keys to view all available programming.|$|R
50|$|Used {{to build}} call center {{equipment}} using regular PCs, MVIP provides a second communications bus within the computer that can multiplex up to 256 full-duplex voice channels from one voice card to another. Digital voice, fax and video is bussed over a ribbon cable connected {{at the top}} of each ISA or PCI card. MVIP products make a PC perform like a small-scale PBX. The protocol accommodated for a variety of expansion boards, including trunk interfaces (usually T1 or ISDN), voice processing boards equipment speech recognition or <b>fax</b> processing. Each <b>board</b> could optionally provide a switch that could interconnect voice channels on the bus, allowing for a flexible routing of calls within the MVIP bus.|$|R
40|$|The fax {{capabilities}} {{found on}} Dialogic ® Diva ® Media Boards make a powerful set of enhanced fax features available to Asterisk ® PBX integrators and users, including {{the ability to}} generate and receive faxes over TDM channels, generate and receive faxes over analog telephony channels, detect incoming fax tones, and handle T. 38 and clear channel (FoIP) faxes. The Diva Media Boards can also offload much of the media processing from Asterisk, resulting in increased efficiency and reliability. Some additional Asterisk configuration is needed to use the fax features enabled by Diva Media Boards. This application note examines these features, and explains how to configure and use them.
