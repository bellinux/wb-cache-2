How and why I do not {{describe}} my method of remaining under water, or <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>I</b> can stay without eating; and I do not publish nor divulge these by reason of the evil nature of men who would use them as means of destruction {{at the bottom of the}} sea, by sending ships to the bottom, and sinking them together with the men in them. And although I will impart others, there is no danger in them; because the mouth of the tube, by which you breathe, is above the water supported on bags of corks.|$|E

2500|$|At his {{arraignment}} at the District Court of Pittsburg County on June 4, 2002, Duty asked Judge Steven Taylor {{to enter}} a guilty plea to the murder and requested the death penalty, {{against the advice of}} his defense counsel. On October 28 of that year, Duty was deemed competent to enter the plea after court-ordered evaluations by the Carl Albert Community Mental Health Center and Eastern Oklahoma State Hospital. While testifying on his own behalf, Duty declined to present any mitigating evidence and said that he preferred death over spending a life sentence in lockdown 23 hours day. He also wrote to the prosecutor that he would kill again. Mary Wise pleaded to the court to sentence Duty to life in prison without the possibility of parole, stating: [...] "I don't believe he ought to have a choice. I think he ought to sit in that cell and face those four walls and think about what he did {{for the rest of his}} natural-born life. And I hope and pray to God that you live to be 110 years old, because that's <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>I</b> want you to think about what you did." [...] Judge Taylor denied her request, calling Duty a [...] "textbook case for the death penalty". Duty was initially scheduled to be executed on February 24, 2005.|$|E

40|$|Ageing and dejuvenization of {{the working}} {{population}} urge us to pay directed attention to sustainable employability policy as being part of Strategic HRM. In this shortened version of my inaugural lecture, a positive psychological approach is used {{to deal with the}} possibilities both employees and working organizations have to stimulate employees to develop healthy, prosperous, challenging, and productive careers until retirement age or even after that. The strength of seniority will explicitly be focused on. Moreover, this manuscript will deal with possible threats and shortcomings that ageing workers may encounter. Given the enormous diversity in perceptions people may have towards life and career success a non-normative framework has been used. In consideration of the more pluriform working population, this contribution is structured around four career-related questions: <b>how</b> <b>long</b> do <b>I</b> have to go on for; <b>how</b> <b>long</b> will <b>I</b> be able to; <b>how</b> <b>long</b> will <b>I</b> be allowed to; and <b>how</b> <b>long</b> do <b>I</b> want to go on for...|$|R
