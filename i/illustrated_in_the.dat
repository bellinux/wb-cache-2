5|$|Greek {{influence}}, {{which had}} {{made its way}} to Phoenicia during the Persian period, now became stronger. Figurines found in Kharayeb show Aegean influence on local craftsmen. This spreading Hellenization interacted with the local Semitic population substratum, which remained faithful to its gods and its language. It resulted in an artistic and architectural symbiosis best <b>illustrated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> artifacts of Umm el 'Amed and Bustan esh Sheikh.|$|E
5|$|Jain texts state that, after Mahavira was born, the god Indra {{came from}} the heavens, anointed him, and {{performed}} his abhisheka (consecration) on Mount Meru.

The Kalpa sutras describing Mahavira's birth legends are recited by the Svetambara Jains during annual festivals such as Paryushana, but the same festival is observed by the Digambaras without the recitation.|$|E

5|$|Clathrus ruber is {{a species}} of fungus in the stinkhorn family, and the type species of the genus Clathrus. It is {{commonly}} known as the latticed stinkhorn, the basket stinkhorn, or the red cage, alluding to the striking fruit bodies that are shaped somewhat like a round or oval hollow sphere with interlaced or latticed branches. The fungus is saprobic, feeding off decaying woody plant material, and is often found alone or in groups in leaf litter on garden soil, grassy places, or on woodchip garden mulches. Although considered primarily a European species, C.ruber has been introduced to other areas, and now has a wide distribution that includes northern Africa, Asia, Australia, and North and South America. The species was <b>illustrated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> scientific literature during the 16th century, but was not officially described until 1729.|$|E
5|$|In Australia, {{there was}} little {{interest}} in the cultivation of Australian plants until the mid-20th century, despite a long-standing appreciation of their beauty as wildflowers. For example, in 1933 and 1934 The Western Mail published a series of Edgar Dell paintings of Western Australian wildflowers, including a painting of B.sessilis. These were subsequently republished in Charles Gardner's 1935 West Australian Wild Flowers. One of the first published colour photographs of the species appeared in William Blackall's 1954 How to know Western Australian wildflowers, but this publication was restricted to plant identification. The species was discussed and <b>illustrated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1959 Wildflowers of Western Australia, and in the 1973 Flowers and plants of Western Australia, but these books did not provide cultivation advice either.|$|E
5|$|Pliny the Elder's (23–79 CE) encyclopaedic Naturalis Historia (c. 77–79 CE) is a {{synthesis}} of {{the information contained in}} about 2000 scrolls and it includes myths and folklore; there are about 200 extant copies of this work. It comprises 37 books of which sixteen (Books 12–27) are devoted to trees, plants and medicaments and, of these, seven describe medicinal plants. In medieval herbals, along with De Materia Medica it is Pliny's work that is the most frequently mentioned of the classical texts, even though the work De Simplicibus of Galen (131–201 CE) is more detailed and notable. Another Latin translation of Greek works that was widely copied in the Middle Ages, probably <b>illustrated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> original, was that attributed to Apuleius and this also contained the alternative names for particular plants given in several languages. It dates to about 400 CE and a surviving copy dates to about 600 CE.|$|E

5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} scientifically by French mycologist Roger Heim in 1958. It {{was one of}} several species described and <b>illustrated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> popular American weekly magazine Life ("Seeking the Magic Mushroom"), in which R. Gordon Wasson recounted the psychedelic visions that he experienced during the divinatory rituals of the Mixtec people, thereby introducing psilocybin mushrooms to Western popular culture; it was however, mislabeled as Psilocybe zaptecorum. Similarly, Psilocybe specialist Gastón Guzmán suggests that P.zapotecorum, as described by Rolf Singer in 1958, is misidentified as it agrees well with the type of P.hoogshagenii. The species Psilocybe caerulipes var. gastonii, described by Singer in 1958, is a synonym of P.hoogshagenii.|$|E
5|$|These {{excavations}} {{have yielded}} different varieties of ceramics such as {{black and red}} ware, rouletted ware and Russet coated ware, both locally made and imported kinds. Many of the pottery sherds contain Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions on them, which have provided additional evidence for the archaeologist to date them. Other artifacts such as brick walls, ring wells, pits, industrial items, remains of seeds and shells provide clues {{about the nature of}} the settlements and the other aspects of life during the Sangam age. Archaeologists agree that activities best <b>illustrated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> material records of Tamilakam are trade, hunting, agriculture and crafts.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1750s, even {{the roof of}} Ardincaple Castle, seat of the clan chief, had fallen in. The overall {{condition}} of the castle had deteriorated {{to such an extent}} that the next laird was forced to abandon it and live in nearby Laggarie. The bulk of the Ardincaple estate ultimately passed into the hands of John Campbell, 4th Duke of Argyll. The last chief of the MacAulays, Aulay MacAulay, died at High Laggarie (now encompassed by the tiny village of Rhu) landless and without an heir to succeed as chief in about 1767. In 1794, Lord Frederick Campbell (brother of John, 5th Duke of Argyll) supervised the draining of the marsh and bog-ridden former lands of the Lairds of Ardincaple. The poor state of the lands of Ardincaple before that year is <b>illustrated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> statement by George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll: that much of the land could not bear the weight of a cow, and local men of the time remembered when horses would be lost in the bogholes prevalent in the area.|$|E

5|$|Conversely, {{one might}} expect that {{inertial}} motions, once identified by observing the actual motions of bodies and making allowances for the external forces (such as electromagnetism or friction), {{can be used to}} define the geometry of space, as well as a time coordinate. However, there is an ambiguity once gravity comes into play. According to Newton's law of gravity, and independently verified by experiments such as that of Eötvös and its successors (see Eötvös experiment), there is a universality of free fall (also known as the weak equivalence principle, or the universal equality of inertial and passive-gravitational mass): the trajectory of a test body in free fall depends only on its position and initial speed, but not on any of its material properties. A simplified version of this is embodied in Einstein's elevator experiment, <b>illustrated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> figure on the right: for an observer in a small enclosed room, it is impossible to decide, by mapping the trajectory of bodies such as a dropped ball, whether the room is at rest in a gravitational field, or in free space aboard a rocket that is accelerating at a rate equal to that of the gravitational field.|$|E
