5|$|Because the {{aircraft}} was fully booked, a passenger {{was allowed to}} sit in the <b>jump</b> <b>seat</b> in the cockpit. The passenger had no connection with the airline, but was granted permission by the captain via acquaintance in the airline. Several of the other passengers were employees in Widerøe and shouldaccording to the airline's rulesinstead have been seated there. From Namsos to Brønnøysund there were available seats in the cabin, but the <b>jump</b> <b>seat</b> passenger continued {{to sit in the}} cockpit. The commission felt that the passenger's conversation with the captain drew his attention and concentration away from his duties at a critical point of the flight. This also disrupted communication between the two pilots, resulting in the mutual control being disrupted.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} made a stop-over at Namsos, where sixteen of {{the passengers}} disembarked. This {{reduced the number of}} passengers on board to thirty-three, but the passenger occupying the <b>jump</b> <b>seat</b> continued to sit there on the next leg. The captain was the flying pilot for the segment. The aircraft departed Namsos at 20:07 and contacted Trondheim Air Traffic Control Center (ATCC) at 20:13 to receive permission to ascend to flight level 90 (FL 90), which was received. During the flight, the passenger in the <b>jump</b> <b>seat</b> held a conversation with the captain and asked several questions regarding the operations. The first officer did not participate in this discussions, and it was he who conducted radio contact with air traffic control and the airline's operations' center.|$|E
5|$|An {{investigation}} found several shortcomings in the airline's operating procedures, in particular lack of proper cockpit communication and mutual {{control of the}} descent and approach plans. This was in part caused by the airline electing to not follow the Sterile Cockpit Rule and that a passenger {{was sitting in a}} cockpit <b>jump</b> <b>seat</b> during the flight. The investigating commission also found lack of proper pilot training in the airline. Flight 710 was the second of four Widerøe accidents between 1982 and 1993, all of which revealed shortcomings in the airline's operations and internal control.|$|E
50|$|In aircraft, jump seats—which are officially termed {{auxiliary}} crew stations—can {{be located}} in cockpits or passenger cabins. In cockpits, <b>jump</b> <b>seats</b> are provided for individuals who are not operating the aircraft. These might include trainee pilots, off-duty crew members in transition to another airport (see deadheading), government officials (such as Federal Aviation Administration staff), or airline staff. The passenger cabin <b>jump</b> <b>seats</b> are used by the cabin crew, especially during takeoff and landing. These <b>jump</b> <b>seats</b> are normally located near emergency exits so that flight attendants can quickly open the exit door for an emergency evacuation. The passenger cabin <b>jump</b> <b>seats</b> usually fold {{out of the way}} when not in use to keep aisles, workspaces, and emergency exits clear.|$|R

5|$|The captain {{asked for}} the descent {{checklist}} at 20:24:24. The fasten seat belt sign was switched on and the flight attendant started the process of preparing the cabin for landing. At 20:24:46 the captain, {{as part of the}} checklist, informed the first officer that they would go down to 1,500 ft at Torghatten and then down to 550ft. This was followed first by a partially unreadable conversation between the captain and the first officers, which included if they were to fill fuel, and then an unreadable conversation between the captain and the <b>jump</b> <b>seat</b> passenger. The direction of the VHF omnidirectional radio range (VOR) and distance measuring equipment (DME) at Brønnøysund was checked at 20:26:37.|$|E

500|$|The {{aircraft}} {{had been}} used during the morning of 6 May [...] on a multi-leg flight from Bodø Airport to Trondheim Airport, Værnes and back. It had then flown back to Trondheim where it changed crew. They had arrived at Trondheim with a flight at 18:50 on 5 May and left the hotel in Trondheim at 16:15 on 6 May. Flight 710 was scheduled to fly from Trondheim via Namsos Airport, Høknesøra; Brønnøysund Airport, Brønnøy; and Sandnessjøen Airport, Stokka. It departed Værnes at 19:23, {{one and a half}} hours after scheduled, because of technical problems with another different aircraft. Flight 710 had a crew of three: a captain, a first officer and a flight attendant. The aircraft was packed and therefore a <b>jump</b> <b>seat</b> in the cockpit was used by a passenger, bringing the number of people on board to 52.|$|E
50|$|The J40 Series also {{featured}} folding <b>jump</b> <b>seats</b> behind the passenger and drivers seats. These folding seats {{not only made}} carrying another 2 passengers possible, but also allowed for maximum cargo space, {{as opposed to the}} folding rear seat in the Jeep CJ series.|$|R

500|$|Fitch {{continued}} {{to control the}} aircraft's descent by adjusting engine thrust. With the loss of all hydraulics, the crew were unable to control airspeed independent from sink rate. On final descent, the aircraft was going 220 knots and sinking at 1,850 feet per minute (approximately 407km/h forward and 34km/h downward speed), while a safe landing would require 140 knots and 300 feet per minute (approximately 260km/h and 5km/h respectively). Fitch needed a seat for landing; Dvorak offered up his own, {{as it could be}} moved to a position behind the throttles. Dvorak sat in the cockpit's <b>jump</b> <b>seat</b> for landing. Fitch noticed the high sink rate and that the plane started to yaw right again, and pushed the throttles to full power in an attempt to mitigate the high sink rate and level the plane. There wasn't enough time for the flight crew [...] to react. The tip of the right wing hit the runway first, spilling fuel, which ignited immediately. The tail section broke off from the force of the impact, {{and the rest of the}} aircraft bounced several times, shedding the landing gear and engine nacelles and breaking the fuselage into several main pieces. On the final impact, the right wing was shorn off and the main part of the aircraft skidded sideways, rolled over onto its back, and slid to a stop upside-down in a corn field to the right of Runway 22. Witnesses reported that the aircraft [...] "cartwheeled" [...] end-over-end, but the investigation did not confirm this. The reports were due to misinterpretation of the video of the crash that showed the flaming right wing tumbling end-over-end and the intact left wing, still attached to the fuselage, rolling up and over as the fuselage flipped over.|$|E

The fixed tailwheel landing gear was strengthened and a more powerful Pratt & Whitney Wasp radial engine fitted. It first flew in New Zealand on 27 July 1969, then it was dismantled and shipped to Hawaii to obtain United States certification. After obtaining the type certificate (on 14 April 1970), ...|$|E
5000|$|There is {{disagreement}} {{about the use}} of the term [...] "three point" [...] position.

5000|$|The Executive Sedan was, simply, a {{stretched}} LeBaron {{that held}} a center console between the front seats. The console held duct {{work for the}} two rear seat air conditioning vents. The Executive Limousine (option code A-89) had a thick center divide behind the front seats that held a glass divider with power sliding center panel (controlled from the passenger-side switch panel), two upholstered <b>jump</b> <b>seats</b> (without seat belts), five air conditioning vents (with flow controlled by a switch on the rear passenger-side door), an illuminated storage compartment with a flip-down door, and an AM/FM stereo with cassette (separate from the driver's sound system) controlling the four rear speakers. Above the divider glass was a [...] "glamour module" [...] lighting unit - with overhead lights for the console, {{as well as individual}} reading lamps for the two <b>jump</b> <b>seats.</b> Once the rear doors were closed, the lamps located in this overhead console would slowly theatre-dim before turning off.
