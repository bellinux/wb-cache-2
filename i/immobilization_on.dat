50|$|A {{drawback}} {{with the}} use of enzymes is size; given the large size of enzymes, they yield a low current density per unit electrode area due to the limited space. Since {{it is not possible to}} reduce enzyme size, it has been argued that these types of cells will be lower in activity. One solution has been to use three-dimensional electrodes or <b>immobilization</b> <b>on</b> conducting carbon supports which provide high surface area. These electrodes are extended into three-dimensional space which greatly increases the surface area for enzymes to bind thus increasing the current.|$|E
5000|$|DTT {{is used as}} a {{reducing}} or [...] "deprotecting" [...] {{agent for}} thiolated DNA. The terminal sulfur atoms of thiolated DNA have a tendency to form dimers in solution, especially in the presence of oxygen. Dimerization greatly lowers the efficiency of subsequent coupling reactions such as DNA <b>immobilization</b> <b>on</b> gold in biosensors. Typically DTT is mixed with a DNA solution and allowed to react, and then is removed by filtration (for the solid catalyst) or by chromatography (for the liquid form). The DTT removal procedure is often called [...] "desalting." [...] Generally, DTT {{is used as a}} protecting agent that prevents oxidation of thiol groups.|$|E

30|$|Here, we have {{prepared}} functionalized {{gold and silver}} nanoparticles for the immobilizations of TbADH and its cofactor NADPH. The aim was to study the effect of different preparations (physical, covalent, and cross-linking <b>immobilizations)</b> <b>on</b> enzyme activity and structure. Size of the nanoparticles {{and structure of the}} enzyme before and after their interaction were characterized by TEM, circular dichroism, and fluorescence spectroscopies. Cofactor binding, activity measurements, storage stability, and ability of the nanoparticle-immobilized TbADH-NADPH bioconjugates to synthesize chiral alcohols with high enantioselectivity using 7 -hydroxy- 2 -tetralone as substrate were also studied.|$|R

50|$|Since initial publication, IRIS {{has been}} adapted to perform various functions. First, IRIS {{integrated}} a fluorescence imaging capability into the interferometric imaging instrument {{as a potential}} way to address fluorescence protein microarray variability. Briefly, the variation in fluorescence microarrays mainly derives from inconsistent protein <b>immobilization</b> <b>on</b> surfaces and may cause misdiagnoses in allergy microarrays. To correct from any variation in protein immobilization, data acquired in the fluorescence modality is then normalized by the data acquired in the label-free modality. IRIS has also been adapted to perform single nanoparticle counting by simply switching the low magnification objective used for label-free biomass quantification to a higher objective magnification. This modality enables size discrimination in complex human biological samples. Monroe et al.. used IRIS to quantify protein levels spiked into human whole blood and serum and determined allergen sensitization in characterized human blood samples using zero sample processing. Other practical uses of this device include virus and pathogen detection.|$|E
50|$|A {{legitimate}} {{concern in}} any fracture {{is whether the}} fracture will heal quickly and without complication. Failure of the fractured ends to unite is called non-union and its frequency varies with the fracture site, some fracture sites being notorious for non-union. An example of such would be a scaphoid (navicular) fracture of the wrist. Such a complication also involves fractures of the proximal end of the fifth metatarsal, such as the Jones fracture. This {{has been the subject}} of interest, and initially led to the description of three zones at the proximal end of the fifth metatarsal. Zones I and III have been associated with relatively guaranteed union and this union has taken place with only limited restriction of activity combined with early <b>immobilization.</b> <b>On</b> the other hand, zone II has been associated with either delayed or non-union and, consequently, it has been generally agreed that fractures in this area should be considered for some form of internal immobilization, such as internal screw fixation. These zones can be identified anatomically and on x-ray adding to the clinical usefulness of this classification.It should be emphasized that surgical intervention is not, by itself, a guarantee of cure and has its own complication rate. Other reviews of the literature have concluded that conservative, non-operative, treatment is an acceptable option for the non-athlete.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} control the process of {{oligonucleotide}} <b>immobilization</b> <b>on</b> the surface of citrate-stabilized gold nanoparticles, an experimental approach for evaluation {{of the amount of}} immobilized oligonucleotides was proposed. This approach is based on using thiolated oligonucleotides with covalently attached fluorophore Cy 3 and on comparison of the oligonucleotides concentration before and after immobilization procedure (initial concentration and concentration of unbound oligonucleotides). Their difference gives an unambiguous amount of immobilized oligonucleotides. Application of the proposed experimental approach showed that the efficiency of oligonucleotide <b>immobilization</b> <b>on</b> the surface of gold nanoparticles is strongly dependent on the ionic strength of the medium, oligonucleotide concentration and the temperature of immobilization. The proposed experimental approach for determination of the level of oligonucleotide <b>immobilization</b> <b>on</b> the surface of gold nanoparticles is simple, fast and does not use any toxic chemicals...|$|E

In this paper, we evaluated the potential of thermophilic bacterial pectin- and xylan-degrading recombinant enzymes for the degradation of the agro-industrial wastes: apple pomace, wheat straw, wheat bran and distillers grains. For the immobilization of pectate lyase and xylanase, three different supports were used. The effect of enzyme immobilization was analyzed in terms of enhanced thermostability and activity against these wastes. For xylanase, the highest thermostability was achieved by <b>immobilization</b> <b>on</b> Sepabeads EC-EP/M.

40|$|The {{enantioselectivity}} of a lipase from Geobacillus thermocatenulatus (BTL 2) {{has been}} altered by a site-directed <b>immobilization</b> <b>on</b> tailor-made disulfide supports. The enzyme was genetically modified introducing a unique cysteine into different {{positions of the}} protein surface. These new enzyme variants (Ï†-BTL 2) maintained the catalytic properties of the native enzyme. The Ï†-BTL 2 was immobilized by different orientation on disulfide support at pH 7 via disulfide-exchange and additionally rigidification was introduced by the <b>immobilization</b> <b>on</b> disulfide-aldehyde support through {{the interaction of the}} reactive amino groups on the protein near to the position of the introduced cysteine with aldehydes on the support. The oriented immobilization of the Ï†-BTL 2 -S 334 C variant on disulfide-aldehyde supports generated a fully enantioselective biocatalyst (ee > 99 %) in the kinetic resolution of rac- 2 -O-butyryl- 2 -phenylacetic acid and the asymmetric hydrolysis of phenylglutaric acid dimethyl diester. The simple orientation by the introduced cysteine on the lipase <b>immobilization</b> <b>on</b> disulfide supports was enough for good selectivity (ee > 99 %) in the asymmetric hydrolysis but not in the kinetic resolution (ee = 27 %). The rigidification of the oriented immobilized Q 40 C, T 94 C or S 334 C variants on disulfide-aldehyde support was key in the lipase selectivity improvement in the kinetic resolution process (ee from 27 - 50 to > 99 %). In this case, the oriented immobilization did not alter significantly the selectivity. A similar result was obtained for S 196 C variants in the asymmetric hydrolysis, which it selectivity was greatly altered depending on the immobilization method, no selectivity was observed after <b>immobilization</b> <b>on</b> disulfide support but a fully selective catalyst (ee > 99 %) was achieved after <b>immobilization</b> <b>on</b> heterofunctional disulfide-aldehyde support.

40|$|Cis-epoxysuccinic acid {{hydrolase}} (CESH) is {{an enzyme}} that catalyzes cis-epoxysuccinic acid to produce enantiomeric L(+) -tartaric acid. The production of tartaric acid by using CESH would be valuable in {{the chemical industry}} because of its high yield and selectivity, but the low stability of CESH hampers its application. To improve the stability of CESH, we fused five different carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) to CESH and immobilized the chimeric enzymes on cellulose.

Activity measurements demonstrated that the fusion with CBMs and the <b>immobilization</b> <b>on</b> cellulose increased the pH and temperature adaptability of CESH.
