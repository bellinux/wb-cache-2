40|$|Idiopathic normal {{pressure}} hydrocephalus (INPH) {{is characterized}} by the clinical triad of gait and cognitive dysfunction and urinary incontinence. Ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunting is often required for treatment. Review of literature shows few case reports discussing benign magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T 2 hyperintense changes in the corpus callosum of NPH patients after shunting due to mechanical compression of the middle and posterior regions of the body against falx cerebri leading to <b>ischemic</b> <b>demyelination.</b> These changes can be a delayed phenomenon and may interfere with clinical evaluation and may lead to unnecessary procedures and investigations. We present a patient with NPH who was admitted to the neurocritical care unit in coma with quetiapine and trazodone overdose. Diffuse changes {{in the body of the}} corpus callosum were seen on MRI suspicious for acute vasogenic edema due to drug overdose. However, it was later determined to be due to the VP shunting for the NPH. We report this case to raise the awareness of neuroimaging changes in patients with NPH who have VP shunting...|$|E
