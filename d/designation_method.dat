To avoid the problem of rising confusion, we propose to take advantage of established <b>designation</b> <b>methods</b> that indicate the types of amino acids transported and the co-substrate ion requirement of their transport. The economy obligated by the necessity to keep the number of symbols in a gene name to a minimum will rarely permit a listing of the full range of substrates, since amino acid transport systems have broad substrate specificities with co-substrate requirements that can differ in a substrate-specific manner. Hence, the use of established systems to codify groups of amino acid transport systems, which allow identification of the substrate range by using 1 – 3 letters, e. g. A, L or even ASC, could be integrated with a system used to indicate the ion-dependence of transport.

40|$|It {{has proved}} to be {{difficult}} to translate the lessons from the literature on universal service into the policy framework because of political interests and regulatory capture. Neither the USA or Europe has made {{a very good job of}} devising a clean framework and the WTO agreement is sparing in this area. A number of pressures in the European context have enabled a more systematic approach to emerge, that exploits the academic work. They include the need for the European regulatory framework to encompass E. European countries where network development and income levels are much lower, the desire to encompass Internet within the universal service regulatory framework, a willingness to design a framework that covers all communications networks and remove the telecommunications bias, thereby forcing issues of economic neutrality to the fore. The paper systematically goes through a number of key areas and principles of regulation and how they are being designed to deal with a range of national situations. They include, defining the scope of universal service and the principles by which it might be modified in the light of technological and economic developments; incorporating latitude for intervention outside this defined scope, defining incentive and <b>designation</b> <b>methods</b> to encourage the efficient supply of elements of universal service obligations, interpreting affordability in the context of price and income levels that diverge considerably, requiring both allocative efficiency and competitive neutrality, formulating alternative financing methods including general government financing and value added tax type methods which can co-exist and provide comparative policy yardsticks.

40|$|The {{notion that}} {{conservation}} areas are static geographical units for biodiversity conservation should be revised when planning for climate-change adaptation. Since species {{are expected to}} respond to climate change by shifting their distributions, conservation areas can lose the very same species that justified their <b>designation.</b> <b>Methods</b> exist {{to take into account}} the potential effects of climate on spatial priorities for conservation. One of such methods involves the identification of time-ordered linkages between conservation areas (hereafter termed climate-change corridors), thus enabling species tracking their suitable changing climates. We critically review and synthesise existing quantitative approaches for spatial conservation planning under climate change. We extend these approaches focusing on the identification of climate-change corridors, using three alternative models that vary on the objective function (minimum cost or maximum benefit sought) and on the nature of conservation targets (area-based or persistence probabilities). The three models for establishing climate-change corridors are illustrated with a case study involving two species distributed across the Iberian Peninsula. The species were modelled in relation to climate-change scenarios using ensembles of bioclimatic models and theoretical dispersal kernels. The corridors obtained are compared for their location, the temporal sequence of priorities, and the effectiveness with which solutions attain persistence and cost objectives. By clearly framing the climate-change corridors problem as three alternative models and providing the corresponding mathematical descriptions and solving tools, we offer planners a wide spectrum of models that can be easily adapted to a variety of conservation goals and constraints.

This paper summarizes published papers about target parking position designation up to now, and proposes four phase strategy based on the strong and weak points of each method. Generally, target parking position designation can be classified into four categories: GUI-based, parking slot marking-based, free space-based, and infrastructure-based.

40|$|Abstract — Automatic parking systems {{consist of}} three core technologies: target {{position}} designation, path planning, and path tracking. Target position designation methods {{can be divided}} into four categories: user interface-based, parking slot marking-based, free space-based, and infrastructure-based. Considering the fact that parking assist systems are expected to be used mainly in urban situations, recognition of parking slot markings could be the most economical and efficient solution for target position designation. This article proposes a semi-automatic parking slot marking-based target position <b>designation</b> <b>method.</b> The user can initiate parking slot marking recognition by placing a finger {{on each side of the}} entrance of the target parking slot. With such a user interface, these systems can reduce the search range to so small an area that computational loads and false recognition rates are significantly reduced. Furthermore, by identifying the junction patterns of parking slot markings around the designated point with a neural network-based classifier, the user can establish the target position with a uniform user interface. The proposed system showed a 91. 10 % recognition rate in 191 test cases consisting of five different types of parking slot markings...|$|E

Current treatment for non-syndromic spinal schwannomas is total resection of the tumor with preservation of neurovascular structures. This study aims to report neurologic and radiologic outcome following treatment of non-syndromic spinal schwannomas along with a novel tumor classification used in our clinic. A retrospective case series was carried out with a patient sample of 82 male and female patients with non-syndromic spinal schwannomas. All patient data were retrospectively collected from the hospital records. As a routine procedure, after admittance and primary evaluation, patients’ tumors were classified using CT or MRI in accordance with our proposed classification method, which employs a dual <b>designation</b> <b>method</b> with tree groups (A, B, and C) for tumor volume and four types (I, II, III, and IV) for tumor localization. Subsequent resection surgery was followed by neurological assessments and follow up at 45 th, 180 th, and 360 th postoperative day. Along with Karnofsky performance status scale, pain, sensory deficits, and motor weakness were scored to assess neurologic recovery. Our finding indicates that patients with different tumor types significantly differ in their neurological scores and show consistent but differential neurological recovery at early and late time points postsurgery. Complications during and postsurgery were minimal, occurring only in two patients. Our findings further reinforce the established safety of total resection operations and indicate that our proposed classification is a simple, effective tool that has proven helpful in preoperative planning and avoiding unnecessary surgical approaches...|$|E
30|$|The {{functions}} of concentration monitoring are as follows. (1) Concentration monitoring includes {{the provision of}} a methane concentration heat map. The original data collected by the mobile detectors and stationary detectors are merely a cluster of discrete locations that describe {{the relationship between the}} GPS information and methane concentration. Therefore, these data locations must be processed using a classic Gaussian plume diffusion model in order to obtain the concentration distribution of the entire monitored area. Then, these data are shown by means of distribution on a GIS map. (2) Concentration monitoring also includes mobile detectors. The real-time locations (latitude, longitude, and height) and methane concentrations are shown on the GIS map. In addition, every mobile detector is designated by a different color (red, orange, yellow, or green) according to the methane concentration. Red signifies the highest methane concentration and green the lowest. (3) Concentration monitoring includes stationary detectors. The real-time methane concentration and wind speed and direction obtained from each stationary detector are shown on the GIS map. The color <b>designation</b> <b>method</b> is similar to that for the mobile detectors. (4) The history data obtained from all the detectors can be queried via history methane concentration curves when the user clicks on a detector. The history data provide accuracy and reliability with regard to leakage warning. (5) Concentration monitoring includes the working state of the detectors. All the data for the citywide natural gas leakage monitoring system come from every detector, so the working state of the detectors determines whether the system is working normally. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor the working state of all the detectors. Each detector should periodically transfer a diagnostic report message to the control center. If the detector sends a faulty report or no report, then the detector is faulty and the maintenance staff must address such problems. (6) Concentration monitoring includes the level of warning. The real-time warning presents the security status of the monitored area. (7) Concentration monitoring includes a query detector. Users are able to query each detector according to the detector number and highlight it on the GIS map.|$|E
