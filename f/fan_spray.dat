50|$|The 2GR-FSE is a 3.5L engine {{used in the}} Lexus IS, GS 350, Mark X and Crown and {{incorporates}} Toyota's latest D-4S twin injection fuel system. This system combines {{direct injection}} (949cc/min injectors) with traditional port injection (298cc/min injectors). Direct injection lowers the tendency to knock (detonation) and increases performance by reducing the charge intake temperature. Traditionally, direct injection engines require an in-engine mechanism such as swirl ports or specific piston crown shapes to increase air turbulence in the engine. These are in place to help achieve a homogeneous air-fuel mixture inside the cylinder at low RPM and high load, but these mechanisms inhibit performance at higher engine speeds. In the 2GR-FSE, port injection is used considerably to achieve the correct mixture without having in-engine restrictions, meaning the engine achieves specific power {{near the top of}} all naturally aspirated production gasoline engines in the world (67 kW/L, 235 kW in the Mark X). Toyota also developed a new type of injector for this engine. The dual <b>fan</b> <b>spray</b> pattern of the direct injectors is perpendicular to the piston travel with wide dispersion in the cylinder, which aids air and fuel mixture and therefore increases power and efficiency.

40|$|Recent {{attempts}} to utilise solid particles {{in combination with}} high pressure water sprays has caused environmental and safety concern, in cleaning mineral and organic scale inside the Oil and Gas Production Tubing. To increase cleaning performance only high pressure aerated water sprays at high impact force instead should be used. Multi-nationals petroleum companies are facing immense challenges in removing the scale due to the decrease in cavitation bubbles along the production tubing when high pressure water sprays are applied. This has also resulted in high maintenance costs and low productivity of the ‘wells’ with multi billions pounds financial losses per annum. Currently scales are removed using either aggressive chemicals (acids), complete replacement of the tubing, or solid-liquid sprays which are both expensive and causes environmental concern. This research demonstrated that the application of air-water combination (aerated sprays) are the solution in complete removal of various scales in the production tubing {{without the use of}} solid particles and the cavitation bubbles.

The study was conducted using the Volume Of Fluid (VOF) approach. The static contact angle of water droplets on leaf surfaces of different plants (apple, pear, leek and cabbage) was measured and found to vary between 54. 9 and 138. 2 °. Impact experiments were conducted by monitoring the flow and impact characteristics of water droplets on leaves in still air with a high speed camera. Droplets were generated by an agricultural flat <b>fan</b> <b>spray</b> nozzle moving across the leaf at constant speed. The nozzle produced droplets with diameters ranging from 20. 6 up to 550. 8 μm, and droplet velocity values near the impact between 0. 03 and 13. 2 m s(- 1). The CFD model was capable of predicting the observed dynamic impact behaviour of droplets on the plant surfaces.

In this context, the study aimed to evaluate the effects of spray nozzles and spray volumes on spraying deposits, armyworm control and crop corn performance in narrow row sowing system. The experiment was carried out at experimental area of Sao Paulo State University, Campus of Botucatu/SP, Brazil, during the 2009 / 2010 agricultural season, in randomized blocks with factorial scheme (2 x 2 + 1) and four replications. It was tested two flat <b>fan</b> <b>spray</b> nozzles (with and without air induction) combined with two spray volumes (100 and 200 L ha- 1) plus a control treatment. There was no influence of spray nozzles (without air induction) in the spray deposits levels on plants. However, the flat fan nozzle with air induction was more effective on fall armyworm, with 100 % of control against 47. 84 % from other at 15 days after spraying. The increase in the spray volume promoted high spray deposits (415. 4 and 388. 6 μL g- 1 dry mass for flat fan nozzle with and without air induction, respectively at V 10 growth stage) and consequently, the highest spray volume (200 L- 1) was more efficient in the fall armyworm suppression, with 100 % of control.

Many studies were conducted in wind tunnel (Miller, 2011; Nuyttens, 2007; Herbst, 2003) mainly focusing on the definition of quantitative deposition on collectors at different distances or heights according to (ISO 22856, 2008). In most cases, only one nozzle posi-tioned frontally (wind direction perpendicular to the main axis of a Flat <b>Fan</b> <b>spray)</b> is tested. This study {{was carried out in}} IRSTEA wind tunnel that includes a 9 m distribution test bench. A short boom of 4 nozzles (50 cm spacing, 60 cm height) was oriented in either lateral or frontal position. The effect of wind speed (2, 4 and 7. 5 m. s- 1), nozzle type (including mix types) were studied. Nozzle types were FF 110 02 (Albuz AXI), air injection FF (Albuz CVI) 110 02, and air injection twin jets (Albuz CVI Twin) 110 02 and were used at 2. 5 bar. Differ-ent nozzle arrangements represented 18 tests in lateral position and 21 in frontal position. Deposition values every 5 cm are processed with an inverse cumulative calculation. Results are expressed in terms of (i) the cumulated amount of drift (ii) drift values at 5 m (minimum buffer zone width in France). Results logically showed that an increase of wind speed leads to an increase in lateral spray drift values for all modalities. Results confirmed that drift reduction classification of nozzles based on lateral or frontal measurements are not comparable (Douzals, 2012). In frontal position, the number of nozzles induced a cumulative effect on spray deposition without protective effect between collateral sprays. In lateral position, CVI and CVI Twin nozzles involved less drift amount compared to AXI nozzles. Drift values were reduced when replacing the first or the two first AXI nozzles -that are most exposed to the wind- by a CVI or CVI Twin. However, drift mitigation ratio was bet-ter for the CVI Twin compared to CVI nozzle. These results will contribute to a wider study on interactions between sprays types & position and their potential contribution to drift or drift mitigation...|$|E

Reburning is an in-furnace, combustion control technology for NOx reduction. Another environmental issue {{that needs to be addressed}} is the rapidly growing feedlot industry in the United States. The production of biomass from one or more animal species is in excess of what can safely be applied to farmland in accordance with nutrient management plans and stockpiled waste poses economic and environmental liabilities.

The heat flux data were then compared with the corresponding impingement pressure data to develop a pressure-based correlation for single-phase spray cooling heat transfer. Hollow cone and full cone PF- 5060 sprays at three subcooling levels were used for the two-phase heat transfer study. The conventional wisdom is that the temperature at which critical heat flux (CHF) is observed changes with the droplet impact velocity, droplet number density, and droplet size. However, the present measurements indicate that although the magnitude of CHF is strongly dependent on the spray characteristics, the temperature at which CHF occurs lies within a very narrow band (about ± 5 °C) for smooth flat surfaces. This was also observed from local measurements at various radial distances using hollow cone and full cone spray nozzles where the local mass flux varies dramatically. This observation along with liquid properties and subcooling were used to develop a correlation to predict local CHF for PF- 5060 sprays. The single-phase and CHF correlations were combined to predict local spray cooling curve within ± 25 % of the measured valued over the sprays impingement zones...|$|R

The aim of this experiment was to evaluate the airborne dust concentration range and effectiveness of cooling <b>fan</b> with <b>spraying</b> misting systems in the gestation houses in the management practices of China. The experiment was implemented in a gestation barn housed 239 gestation pigs in Hebei Province of China. The tests showed that the average airborne dust concentration was about 4. 70 ± 3. 24 mg/m 3 in cold weather and 2. 18 ± 1. 61 mg/m 3 in warm weather, respectively. The high dust concentration of 17. 55 ± 1. 18 mg/ m 3 in winter and 15. 25 ± 1. 77 mg/m 3 in summer happened in the feeding period. When the misting cooling system with droplet diameter of 20 - 50 µ m turned on, the average airborne dust concentration could be reduced by 75 %, from 7. 94 ± 4. 67 mg/m 3 to 1. 98 ± 1. 80 mg/m 3, during the feeding period...|$|R
40|$|In Asia, {{the recent}} {{rapid growth in}} {{production}} of higher value, more pesticide intensive, horticultural crops and inland aquatic foods in linked agri-aquatic systems poses numerous environmental, health and wider livelihood threats in these often multi-use aquatic systems. ‘Green Revolution’ technologies have enhanced food security and pesticides have been promoted, however, the sustainability of prolonged pesticide use from a functional, environmental and socio-economic perspective is increasingly questionable. Further, despite international pesticide trade agreements and country-specific legislation, illegal practices still prevail. In Thailand and Sri Lanka the influence of pesticide marketing and regulation on pesticide use and hazards was investigated. Community livelihood relationships with three very different agri-aquatic systems (in Central and Northeast Thailand and Northwest Sri Lanka), pesticide use and associated aquatic and health hazards were explored with respect to surface water use and well-being status. Quantitative and qualitative data collection methods utilised participatory community appraisals, household surveys, pesticide fate in surface waters and dietary risk assessment and modelling, key informant semi-structured interviews and stakeholder workshops, to assess these relationships. Enhanced environmental and human pesticide hazards were contributed by pesticide sales incentives and weak regulation allowing illegal practices to prevail. Preliminary risk assessments found greater aquatic and human dietary pesticide hazards within communities, with the poorest at greatest vulnerability from applying pesticide and higher dependency on threatened natural aquatic food resources. The poorest in communities {{were most likely to}} overuse pesticide in Sri Lanka and were most vulnerable to illegal practices in the pesticide industry that are often linked with unauthorised traders and credit arrangements. Most horticultural production is for fresh wholesale markets with no food safety controls, and despite growing demand for safer horticultural produce, most farmers perceive pesticides as necessary, the associated hazards low and have little knowledge of safe food production and markets. These circumstances help sustain pesticide use. Some unofficial certification and misleading labelling in the ‘safe’ fruit and vegetable sector in Thailand potentially misinforms consumers and undermines trust that may threaten pesticide reduction efforts. Good Agricultural Practice (GAP) and vegetable Integrated Pest Management (IPM) are evolving practices and techniques of producing horticultural crops with less or no pesticide, the latter sometimes through Farmer Field Schools (FFS), however, evidence of success varies. Teaching through lectures and more lengthy and costly participatory methods is evident, with the former more successful on GAP and higher educated farmers and the latter with IPM and worse-off farmers, particularly when addressed within livelihood issues as a whole. However, production scale, farmer enthusiasm, produce marketing and facilitator expertise all influence outcomes, particularly with IPM, whilst proper evaluation could improve progress. Growing rural consumer interest in organic produce offers further incentives for small to medium scale farmers to implement IPM and reduce pesticide use and hazards. As value of aquatic resources was an incentive to reducing pesticide use, particularly the most dangerous products, exploration of this component of agri-aquatic systems is another exciting prospect for empowering farming community livelihoods over established and failing fear based chemical practices. Such new practices may lead the way towards affordable and trustworthy agri-aquatic systems produce with ethical certification. Greater pesticide use savings on a wider scale come from use of efficient flat <b>fan</b> <b>spray</b> nozzles compared with conventional pesticide spray nozzles. Complementary policies and stakeholder co-operation could aid pesticide use and hazard reduction efforts. A number of recommendations arose from the research...|$|E
40|$|O presente trabalho teve por objetivo verificar a interferência de adjuvantes na quantidade de ar incluído em gotas geradas por pontas com indução de ar, bem como avaliar o espectro resultante destas condições de pulverização. Para o estudo foram utilizadas nove caldas, sendo uma composta apenas por água e oito soluções contendo adjuvantes (óleo mineral, óleo vegetal, mistura de lecitina e ácido propiônico, nonil fenoxi poli etanol, dois adjuvantes a base de nonil fenol etoxilado, copolímero de poliéster e silicone, e lauril éter sulfato de sódio) e três pontas de pulverização jato plano, sendo duas com indução de ar (Air Guardian e Ultra Lo-Drift – Hypro) e uma com pré-orifício (Drift Guard – Spray Systems). O estudo foi realizado em duas etapas, sendo elas a quantificação do ar incluído nas gotas de pulverização e a análise do espectro produzido. O ar incluído foi calculado através da diferença de volume da mistura pulverizada (ar mais líquido) e apenas do líquido, que foi feito por meio de coletas de amostras de pulverização em uma proveta graduada. A determinação do espectro de gotas foi realizada por um analisador de tamanho de partículas por difração de raios laser Mastersizer S (Malvern Instruments). Para análise estatística os valores das variáveis do espectro de gotas e % ar incluído para os diferentes adjuvantes e pontas foram comparados pelo Intervalo de Confiança para Diferenças entre as Médias a 5 % de probabilidade (IC 95 %). Também foram feitas as correlações entre as diferentes variáveis através do coeficiente de Pearson a 5 % de probabilidade. As análises do espectro de gotas demonstraram diferenças entre os adjuvantes, assim como diferenças de comportamento dos adjuvantes de acordo com o tipo de ponta.

This study {{aimed to}} verify the {{influence}} of adjuvants {{on the amount of}} air included in droplets generated by spray nozzles with air induction, as well as to evaluate the droplet spectrum generated in these conditions. For the study, it were used nine spray solutions, one including only water and eight containing adjuvants (mineral oil, vegetable oil, a mixture of lecithin and propionic acid, nonyl phenoxy poly ethanol, the two adjuvants based on nonyl phenol ethoxylate based, copolymer polyester and silicon, and sodium lauryl ether sulfate) and three flat <b>fan</b> <b>spray</b> nozzles, including two air induction (Air Guardian and Ultra Lo-Drift - Hypro) and a pre orifice (Drift Guardian - Spray Systems). The study was conducted in two steps: the quantification of air included in the spray droplets and the droplet spectrum produced. The amount of air included was calculated by the difference in volume of the solution after praying (liquid plus air) and only the solution (before spraying), which was done by collecting samples of the solutions in a graduated cylinder. The determination of the droplet spectrum was carried out by a particle size analyzer by laser device Mastersizer S (Malvern Instruments). Data collected for the variables of droplet spectrum and air included with different adjuvants and nozzles were subjected to statistical analysis by the calculation of the Confidence Interval at 95 % (CI 95 %). Correlations between different variables were calculated by Pearson's correlation at 5 % probability. The analysis of the droplet spectrum showed differences between the different adjuvants, as well as differences in the behavior of adjuvants according to the type of nozzle. All adjuvant caused an increase in the percentage of air included compared to the water, in which some different behaviors were observed for each nozzle.

40|$|This study, {{which is}} mainly of {{literary}} sources, has been performed to fulfil {{the requirements of}} the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences for the degree of Master of Science. Uniform spray distribution is of vital importance for successful results of a chemical control measure. Different studies show that spray distribution can be seriously affected by sprayerboom movements. The objectives of this study have been, firstly, to describe these movements and their influence on the results of a chemical control measure and, secondly, to describe technical methods to reduce these movements and to describe the performances of these methods. Boom movements are caused mainly by the rolling and yawing movements of the sprayer. This implies that the size of these movements increases at an increased distance from the mounting point of the boom. It also implies that the mechanical strains on the boom and its suspension increase progressively with increased boomlength. Likewise slender boomstructures and looseness in the boomsection joints can severely affect the positioning of the boom. Improved positioning of the boom can be achieved by designing the boomsuspension so that it allows a certain degree of freedom for the sprayer to move relative to the boom. Possibilities then exist for either isolation from, or compensation for, the disruptive movements of the sprayer. The method of isolation represents a passive suspension system, in which "internal" disruptive energy is absorbed by damping devices. The method of compensation represents an active suspension system, in which external restoring energy is supplied by e. g. a hydraulic cylinder. In order to obtain the optimal boom positioning with these methods the boom should be a self-supporting structure and as stiff as possible in both directions. When in operation the boomsection joints should either be locked tightly or be provided with damping devices. Up to now the horizontal boom movements have not received any well justified attention. These movements have shown themselves to affect spray distribution as much as, or even more than, the vertical movements, especially if the boom is equipped with <b>fan</b> <b>spray</b> nozzeles. Therefore it is essential that both the vertical and the horizontal boom movements are reduced. The ability of a passive suspension system to keep the boom in its correct spraying position is however restricted in some situations e. g. when spraying across a side slope (fig 27) or when spraying along furrows (fig 29). Then it has to be corrected, either manually or by means of an active system. The performance of a passive suspension that is effective only in the vertical plane will be disrupted by internal random frictional forces due to the horizontal movements of the sprayer. The performance of an ideal passive suspension that does not have this disruptive internal friction will very much depend on the physical properties of its mechanical components, which implies that this system has an optimal performance only under specific conditions. An active suspension does not have these disadvantages, {{but on the other hand}} it requires rather sensitive and expensive equipment. Independent research results show pronounced reduction of boom movements with passive suspension systems. Active suspension systems are not yet commonly used in commercial applications. Results from trials with these systems have not been available. From the fact that the boom movements increase at an increased distance from the mounting point of the boom and that downward movements affect spray distribution more than upward movements do, the conclusion can be drawn that the ends of the boom should be set somewhat higher than the centre section. Considering available standard deviation values of vertical boom displacement and also considering the risk of spray drift etc, the extended sections of the boom should be raised approximately 0, 5 —l, 0 cm per metre distance from the boom mounting point. According to various authors, a sprayer exceeding l 0 -l 2 m working width should be equipped with a boom suspension system designed to reduce boom movements. A conclusion can be drawn from this study is that an active suspension system probably would be justified for working widths exceeding 18 meters. Among other possibilities and advantages the following should be attained by applying corrective measures for improved boom positioning: - Reduced application rate. - Increased work rate. - Reduced potential for drift of spray. - Increased penetration of crop canopy. - Reduced mechanical strain on the boom and the boom suspension. The general awareness of these factors could be essentially increased if a test of sprayerboom movements were included in official sprayer tests. The test in question can probably be made on a stationary test rig which shakes the sprayer in all three directions...|$|E

The method is based on a multiple view camera setup and inline illumination provided by current pulsed LEDs. The quality of spray reconstruction was investigated using experimental data from multiple view shadowgraphs of hollow cone and flat <b>fan</b> water <b>sprays.</b> After calibration and determination of a 3 -D mapping function for each view a line-of-sight (LOS) intensity reconstruction was implemented. After sequential combination of back-projected images at each voxel plane of the volume the 3 -D droplet and ligament positions can be readily obtained. Further improvement of intensity reconstruction may be achieved by a iterative tomographic reconstruction, namely multiplicative algebraic reconstruction technique (SMART). These improvements are documented by comparing slices of the averaged 3 -D shadowgraph intensity of the hollow cone spray orthogonal to the flow. The investigations were further substantiated with simulations using synthetic data to estimate reconstruction quality at increasing droplet densities...|$|R

However, {{little is known}} about how those heat abatement strategies are provided in commercial conditions, nor their effectiveness. Ten dairies with drylots, a common housing system in California, were assessed for strategies provided, and the cows' responses to heat load were observed for 3 days in the afternoon. Dairies were diverse in all aspects. Shade varied in terms of placement (at corral and feed bunk or at corral only) and amount (28 to 74 square feet, or 2. 6 to 6. 9 square meters, per cow). The quantity of water used to spray cows ranged from 0 to 6. 8 gallons (0 to 25. 6 liters) per hour per cow. Across dairies, there was a range in the cows' shade use (47 % to 98 % of herd) and feeding activity (7 % to 33 % of herd). Respiration rates ranged from 65 (normal) to 95 breaths per minute (very hot) and were positively related to inactivity. Our results indicate that there are opportunities to improve cooling, and consequently dairy cattle welfare, in drylots...|$|R
40|$|Tomographic shadowgraphy is an {{image-based}} optical technique {{capable of}} reconstructing the three dimensional instantaneous spray distributions {{within a given}} volume. The method {{is based on a}} multiple view imaging setup with inline illumination provided by current-pulsed LEDs, which results in droplet shadows being projected onto multiple sensor planes. Each camera records image pairs with short inter-framing times that allow the trajectories of the individual droplets to be estimated using conventional threedimensional particle tracking approaches. The observed volume is calibrated with a traversed micro-target. A comparison is made between several photogrammetric and polynomial least-square camera calibration techniques regarding their accuracy in deep volume calibration at magnifications close to unity. A calibration method based on volume calibration from multiple planar homographies at equally spaced z-planes was found to produce the most reliable calibration. The combination of back-projected images at each voxel plane efficiently reproduces the droplet positions in three-dimensional space by line-of-sight (LOS) intensity reconstruction. Further improvement of the reconstruction can be achieved by iterative tomographic reconstruction, namely simultaneous multiplicative algebraic reconstruction technique (SMART).
