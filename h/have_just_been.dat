5|$|Some repairs {{were made}} in 1604 by Alessandro Stafrace, after cracks {{appeared}} in part of the Main Hall. The auberge had an entrance facing a square in South Street, but this was blocked in 1629 when the square was built up (the square was recreated in 2012 as Jean de Valette Square). Historian Giovanni Bonello suggests {{that this was the}} main entrance of the auberge, although it might <b>have</b> <b>just</b> <b>been</b> a side entrance. In 1649–50, a mezzanine was built beneath the Admiral's Room, and a large room {{at the rear of the}} building was converted into four shops in 1654. The archives were constructed in 1678.|$|E

25|$|Most years, natural pests keep weevil {{populations in}} check - parasites {{sometimes}} destroy {{more than half}} the pupae populations. It has been noted that parasite control may fail every several years. There are also chemical controls available {{that can be used to}} eliminate adults and larvae. One should apply contact or stomach insecticides as soon as the first adult feeding spots are noticed on host leaves. A rule of thumb is to apply the insecticide when feeding damage accumulates to 10% or more throughout foliage. Since the spring adults feed and move during April to early June, a second application may be needed. Systemics are used to combat larvae. It is best to apply systemics when the eggs <b>have</b> <b>just</b> <b>been</b> laid or while larval mines are green in color.|$|E

Mrs. Loftus becomes increasingly suspicious that Huck is a boy, finally proving it by a series of tests.

25|$|The {{practice}} of catch and release is criticised by some who consider it unethical to inflict pain upon a fish {{for purposes of}} sport. Some of those who object to releasing fish do not object to killing fish for food. Adherents of catch and release dispute this charge, pointing out that fish commonly feed on hard and spiky prey items, and as such {{can be expected to}} have tough mouths, and also that some fish will re-take a lure they <b>have</b> <b>just</b> <b>been</b> hooked on, a behaviour that is unlikely if hooking were painful. Opponents of catch and release fishing would find it preferable to ban or to severely restrict angling. On the other hand, proponents state that catch-and-release is necessary for many fisheries to remain sustainable, is a practice that generally has high survival rates, and consider the banning of angling as not reasonable or necessary.|$|E
25|$|The {{smallest}} jellyfish are {{the peculiar}} creeping jellyfish in the genera Staurocladia and Eleutheria, which have bell disks from 0.5mm {{to a few}} millimeters in diameter, with short tentacles that extend out beyond this, which these jellyfish use to move {{across the surface of}} seaweed or the bottoms of rocky pools. Many of these tiny creeping jellyfish cannot be seen in the field without a hand lens or microscope; they can reproduce asexually by splitting in half (called fission). Other very small jellyfish, which have bells about one millimeter, are the hydromedusae of many species that <b>have</b> <b>just</b> <b>been</b> released from their parent polyps; some of these live only a few minutes before shedding their gametes in the plankton and then dying, while others will grow in the plankton for weeks or months. The hydromedusae Cladonema radiatum and Cladonema californicum are also very small, living for months, yet never growing beyond a few mm in bell height and diameter. Another small species of jellyfish is the Australian Irukandji, which {{is about the size of}} a fingernail.|$|E

25|$|Let ABC be an {{isosceles}} triangle with AB and AC being the equal sides. Pick an arbitrary point D on side AB and construct E on AC so that AD=AE. Draw the lines BE, DC and DE. Consider the triangles BAE and CAD; BA=CA, AE=AD, and angle A {{is equal to}} itself, so by side-angle-side, the triangles are congruent and corresponding sides and angles are equal. Therefore angle ABE = angle ACD, angle ADC = angle AEB, and BE=CD. Since AB=AC and AD=AE, BD=CE by subtraction of equal parts. Now consider the triangles DBE and ECD; BD=CE, BE=CD, and angle DBE = angle ECD <b>have</b> <b>just</b> <b>been</b> shown, so applying side-angle-side again, the triangles are congruent. Therefore angle BDE = angle CED and angle BED = angle CDE. Since angle BDE = angle CED and angle CDE = angle BED, angle BDC = angle CEB by subtraction of equal parts. Consider a third pair of triangles, BDC and CEB; DB=EC, DC=EB, and angle BDC = angle CEB, so applying side-angle-side a third time, the triangles are congruent. In particular, angle CBD = BCE, {{which was to be}} proved.|$|E
