When a properly aligned dancer is viewed from the side, the line passes through the <b>knee,</b> <b>ankle</b> joint, and big toe joints. When viewed from the front, the line passes through the <b>knee,</b> <b>ankle</b> joint, and the joints of the second toe or middle toe or the area between those toe joints. In cases of unusually high instep or metatarsal joint flexibility, it is sometimes necessary to flex the toes to achieve proper alignment.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} compensatory biomechanical patterns in the lower extremity created by restricted <b>knee</b> flexion and <b>ankle</b> dorsiflexion when performing squats. Forty two healthy subjects (21 men, 21 women; 22. 5 (4. 5) years, 73. 8 (17. 8) kg, 167. 5 (12. 5) cm) participated in the study. Data were collected using a force plate and a 3 -d electromagnetic tracking device for bilateral lower extremity analyses. Three parallel squats were performed in non braced, right knee restricted and right ankle restricted conditions. Dependent measures were hip, <b>knee</b> and <b>ankle</b> total joint displacement and work done on the hip, <b>knee</b> and <b>ankle</b> during the eccentric portion of the squat. Three repeated measures ANOVAs compared lower extremity kinematics between conditions, while one repeated measure ANOVAs evaluated lower extremity kinetics. Mean hip, <b>knee</b> and <b>ankle</b> ROM was reported, as was sagittal plane work done on the hip, <b>knee</b> and <b>ankle</b> for each condition and limb. The primary findings of this study indicate hip and ankle flexion displacement significantly decreased in the contralateral (non-braced) limb during the ankle joint restricted condition.

40|$|OBJECTIVE Marked {{differences}} exist between human <b>knee</b> and <b>ankle</b> joints regarding risks and progression of osteoarthritis (OA). Pathomechanisms of degenerative joint disease may therefore differ in these joints, due {{to differences in}} tissue structure and function. Focussing on structural issues which are design goals for tissue engineering, we compared cell and matrix morphologies in different anatomical sites of adult human <b>knee</b> and <b>ankle</b> joints. METHODS Osteochondral explants were acquired from <b>knee</b> and <b>ankle</b> joints of deceased persons aged 20 to 40 years and analyzed for cell, matrix and tissue morphology using confocal and electron microscopy and unbiased stereological methods. Variations associated with joint (<b>knee</b> versus <b>ankle)</b> and biomechanical role (convex versus concave articular surfaces) were identified by 2 -way analysis of variance and post-hoc analysis. RESULTS Knee cartilage exhibited higher cell densities in the superficial zone than ankle cartilage. In the transitional zone, higher cell densities were observed in association with convex versus concave articular surfaces, without significant differences between <b>knee</b> and <b>ankle</b> cartilage. Highly uniform cell and matrix morphologies were evident throughout the radial zone in the <b>knee</b> and <b>ankle,</b> regardless of tissue biomechanical role. Throughout the <b>knee</b> and <b>ankle</b> cartilage sampled, chondron density was remarkably constant at approximately 4. 2 × 10 (6) chondrons/cm(3). CONCLUSION Variation of cartilage cell and matrix morphologies with changing joint and biomechanical environments suggests that tissue structural adaptations are performed primarily by the superficial and transitional zones. Data may aid the development of site-specific cartilage tissue engineering, and help identify conditions where OA is likely to occur...|$|R

40|$|In a {{study of}} degree of lower body {{symmetry}} in 73 elite Jamaican track and field athletes we show that both their <b>knees</b> and <b>ankles</b> (but not their feet) are-on average-significantly more symmetrical than those of 116 similarly aged controls from the rural Jamaican countryside. Within the elite athletes, events ranged from the 100 to the 800 m, and <b>knee</b> and <b>ankle</b> asymmetry was lower for those running the 100 m dashes than those running the longer events with turns. Nevertheless, across all events those with more symmetrical <b>knees</b> and <b>ankles</b> (but not feet) had better results compared to international standards. Regression models considering lower body symmetry combined with gender, age and weight explain 27 to 28 % {{of the variation in}} performance among athletes, with symmetry related to about 5 % of this variation. Within 100 m sprinters, the results suggest that those with more symmetrical <b>knees</b> and <b>ankles</b> ran faster.

40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{the need for}} quantitative research on the dance turnout by providing functional external rotation ranges of motion for the hip, <b>knee,</b> and <b>ankle</b> in the dance turnout. The subjects were thirty-two eclectically trained, beginning to professional dancers. Turnout was studied with a plumb line apparatus attached at the hip, <b>knee,</b> and <b>ankle.</b> Parallel position and ballet first and fifth positions were measured with straight legs and in demi-plie. In first position straight, the hip, <b>knee,</b> and <b>ankle</b> provided 51. 2 %, 21. 4 %, and 27. 5 %, respectively of total unilateral turnout. In first position, demi-plie, the hip, <b>knee,</b> and <b>ankle</b> contributed 76. 9 %, 7. 4 %, and 15. 7 %, respectively to total unilateral turnout. In fifth position right with legs straight, the right hip, <b>knee,</b> and <b>ankle</b> contributed 61. 6 %, 23. 0 %, and 15. 4 %, respectively, of total turnout on the right; the left hip, <b>knee,</b> and <b>ankle</b> contributed 51. 8 %, 17. 4 %, and 30. 8 %, respectively, to total turnout on the left. In fifth position right demi-plie, the right hip, <b>knee,</b> and <b>ankle</b> provided 78. 4 %, 7. 4 %, and 14. 7 %, respectively, of total turnout on the right; the left hip, <b>knee,</b> and <b>ankle</b> contributed 68. 3 %, 7. 3 %, and 23. 8 %, respectively, to total turnout on the left. There was {{a significant increase in}} hip rotation (first position p = 0. 0174; fifth position p = 0. 0609), and significant decrease in knee (first position p = 0. 7637; fifth position p = 0. 9179) and ankle rotation (first position p = 0. 0025; fifth position p = 0. 0001), when moving from straight to demi-plie. Dancers who began their training at an earlier age had greater total turnout in first position and in fifth right. The most frequently reported dance injuries were to the low back and knee, followed by foot injuries, and then ankle injuries. These results will help to provide a standard for safe biomechanical turnout in dancers...|$|R
30|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} whether the <b>knee</b> and <b>ankle</b> angles at contact during running were related to the elastic properties of tendon structures in knee extensors and plantar flexors and performance in trained long distance runners. Thirty-two highly trained male long distance runners participated in this study. Elongation of tendon structures in knee extensors and plantar flexors were measured using ultrasonography while subjects performed ramp isometric contractions up to the voluntary maximum. The relationship between estimated muscle force and tendon elongation was fit to a linear regression, the slope of which was defined as the stiffness of tendon structures. <b>Knee</b> and <b>ankle</b> angles at contact during running were determined at a speed of 18  km/h on a treadmill. <b>Knee</b> and <b>ankle</b> angles at contact were not correlated to the stiffness of tendon structures in knee extensors and plantar flexors. In addition, the best official record in a 5000 -m race was not significantly correlated to <b>knee</b> and <b>ankle</b> joint angles at contact. In conclusion, <b>knee</b> and <b>ankle</b> angles at contact were not related to the elastic properties of tendon structures in knee extensors and plantar flexor and the performance of long distance running.|$|R
