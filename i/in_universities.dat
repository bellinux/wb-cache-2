5|$|He {{drew from}} his medical {{training}} to discredit popular ideas about {{differences among the}} races. In 1843 he gave a lecture series, Comparative Anatomy and Physiology of the Races, to demonstrate the failings of phrenology, which was a so-called scientific practice {{of the time that}} was applied in a way to draw racist conclusions and attribute negative characteristics to ethnic Africans. He rejected the practice of homeopathy, an alternative to the scientific medicine being taught <b>in</b> <b>universities.</b> Although he had a successful medical career, he was not admitted to the American Medical Association or local associations because of racial discrimination.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} whether students engaged <b>in</b> <b>university</b> sport have different drinking outcome expectancies and normative beliefs than {{students who are}} not engaged <b>in</b> <b>university</b> sport. A cross-sectional survey of <b>university</b> students <b>in</b> England in 2008 – 2009 was undertaken. A questionnaire battery, including the Drinking Expectancies Questionnaire (DEQ) and a measure of normative beliefs, was completed by 770 students from seven universities across England. Responses from 638 students who were not abstaining from alcohol were analyzed. Students engaged <b>in</b> <b>university</b> sport have significantly higher drinking expectancies of assertion compared with students not engaged <b>in</b> <b>university</b> sport. Moreover, students engaged <b>in</b> <b>university</b> sport consistently report higher personal alcohol consumption and higher perceptions of consumption in those around them than students not engaged <b>in</b> <b>university</b> sport. Both assertion and the perception that students around them drink heavily provide only a partial explanation for why students engaged <b>in</b> <b>university</b> sport drink more than those not engaged <b>in</b> <b>university</b> sport. Further research is required to identify the reasons for heavy drinking among students involved <b>in</b> <b>university</b> sport <b>in</b> England...|$|R

5|$|In {{the film}} industry, more than 300 actors, authors and {{directors}} were denied {{work in the}} U.S. through the unofficial Hollywood blacklist. Blacklists were at work throughout the entertainment industry, <b>in</b> <b>universities</b> and schools at all levels, in the legal profession, and in many other fields. A port security program initiated by the Coast Guard shortly {{after the start of}} the Korean War required a review of every maritime worker who loaded or worked aboard any American ship, regardless of cargo or destination. As with other loyalty-security reviews of McCarthyism, the identities of any accusers and even the nature of any accusations were typically kept secret from the accused. Nearly 3,000 seamen and longshoremen lost their jobs due to this program alone.|$|E

5|$|Major {{intellectual}} {{figures in}} the Reformation included George Buchanan. He taught <b>in</b> <b>universities</b> in France and Portugal, translated texts from Greek into Latin, and was tutor to the young Mary, Queen of Scots for whom he wrote Latin courtly poetry and masques. After her deposition in 1567, his works De Jure Regni apud Scotos (1579) and Rerum Scoticarum Historia (1582) were among the major texts outlining the case for resistance to tyrants. Buchanan {{was one of the}} young James VI's tutors and although he helped in producing a highly educated Protestant prince, who would produce works on subjects including government, poetry and witchcraft, he failed to convince the king of his ideas about limited monarchy. James would debate with both Buchanan and Melville over the status of the crown and kirk.|$|E

5|$|Smoking {{legislation}} in North Korea has tightened in recent years, {{although it is}} still relatively lax and has not had any really meaningful effect on curtailing smoking rates.

However, smoking is not prohibited in either private or work vehicles or on-board trains, at bus stops, near entrances to buildings, <b>in</b> <b>universities,</b> government offices, workplaces, restaurants, cafes, bars, or nightclubs.|$|E
5|$|The {{very first}} {{computer}} games {{began to appear}} in the 1950s, starting with Bertie the Brain, a computer-based game of tic-tac-toe built by Dr. Josef Kates for the 1950 Canadian National Exhibition. While the status of these games as video games depends on the definition used, the games developed during this time period ran on the large antecedents of mainframe computers and were primarily developed for the purposes of academic research or to showcase the technological development of the computers on which they ran. Access to these computers, located almost exclusively <b>in</b> <b>universities</b> and research institutions, was restricted to academics and researchers, preventing any development of entertainment programs. Over the course of the decade, computer technology improved to include smaller, transistor-based computers on which programs could be created and run in real time, rather than operations run in batches, and computers themselves spread to more locations.|$|E
5|$|Animal testing, {{also known}} as animal experimentation, animal {{research}} and in vivo testing, {{is the use of}} non-human animals in experiments that seek to control the variables that affect the behavior or biological system under study. This approach can be contrasted with field studies in which animals are observed in their natural environments. Experimental research with animals is usually conducted <b>in</b> <b>universities,</b> medical schools, pharmaceutical companies, defense establishments and commercial facilities that provide animal-testing services to industry. The focus of animal testing varies on a continuum from pure research, focusing on developing fundamental knowledge of an organism, to applied research, which may focus on answering some question of great practical importance, such as finding a cure for a disease. Examples of applied research include testing disease treatments, breeding, defense research and toxicology, including cosmetics testing. In education, animal testing is sometimes a component of biology or psychology courses. The practice is regulated to varying degrees in different countries.|$|E

5|$|Historically {{four major}} {{industries}} shaped the Texas economy prior to World War II: cattle and bison, cotton, timber, and oil. Before {{and after the}} U.S. Civil War the cattle industry, which Texas came to dominate, was a major economic driver for the state, thus creating the traditional image of the Texas cowboy. In the later 19th century cotton and lumber grew to be major industries as the cattle industry became less lucrative. It was ultimately, though, the discovery of major petroleum deposits (Spindletop in particular) that initiated an economic boom which became {{the driving force behind}} the economy for much of the 20th century. With strong investments <b>in</b> <b>universities,</b> Texas developed a diversified economy and high tech industry in the mid-20th century. As of 2015, it is second on the list of the most Fortune 500 companies with 54. With a growing base of industry, the state leads in many industries, including agriculture, petrochemicals, energy, computers and electronics, aerospace, and biomedical sciences. Texas has led the nation in state export revenue since 2002, and has the second-highest gross state product. If it were a country, Texas would be the 10th largest economy in the world.|$|E
5|$|The {{first edition}} of this work, {{published}} in 1861, was received so favourably that the author has felt bound to bestow his utmost care upon a minute and thorough revision of his book, {{in the hope of}} bringing up the information it contains to the existing state of knowledge. In this endeavour he has been assisted as well by Canon Lightfoot, to whom he is indebted for that section of the third chapter which treats of Egyptian versions of the New Testament (pp. 319-357), as also by much unsought for and most welcome help, especially {{on the part of those}} scholars who are named in p. 164, note. Without wishing to speak harshly of writers who are not very scrupulous in such matters, he has always thought it became him to borrow from no quarter without making a full and frank avowal of the fact.
