5|$|The Gardens are {{believed}} to have opened just before the Restoration of 1660, on property formerly owned by Jane Fauxe, or Vaux, widow, in 1615. Whereas John Nichols in his History of Lambeth Parish conjectures that she was the widow of Guy Fawkes, executed in 1606, John Timbs in his 1867 Curiosities of London states <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> there was no such connection, and that the Vaux name derives from one Falkes de Breauté, a mercenary working for King John who acquired the land by marriage. Jane is stated to be the widow of John, a vintner. Perhaps the earliest record is Samuel Pepys' description of a visit he made to the New Spring Gardens on 29 May 1662. The then name distinguished the gardens from the Old Spring Gardens at Charing Cross; however Pepys implies that there were both Old and New Spring Gardens at Vauxhall; and indeed Spring Gardens {{appears to have been a}} longstanding appellation for a variety of entertainment enterprises.|$|E

500|$|Certain {{elements}} of the film were considered to bear a resemblance to a 1960s Japanese anime television series, Jungle Emperor (known as Kimba the White Lion in the United States), with characters having similar analogues, and various individual scenes being similar in composition to the show. Matthew Broderick believed initially that he was, in fact, working on an American version of Kimba since he {{was familiar with the}} Japanese original. However, The Lion King director, Roger Allers, claimed he was unfamiliar with the show: [...] Co-director Rob Minkoff also stated that he was unfamiliar with it: [...] "I know <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> [...] has never been discussed as long as I've been on the project... In my experience, if Disney becomes aware of anything like that, they say you will not do it. People are claiming copyright infringement all the time." [...] He also stated that whenever a story is based in Africa, it is [...] "not unusual to have characters like a baboon, a bird or hyenas." [...] Yoshihiro Shimizu, of Tezuka Productions, which created Kimba the White Lion, has refuted rumors that the studio was paid hush money by Disney but explains that they rejected urges from within the industry to sue because, [...] "we're a small, weak company. It wouldn't be worth it anyway... Disney's lawyers are among the top twenty in the world!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Inman {{played the}} camp Mr. Wilberforce Claybourne Humphries and his earlier {{career in the}} clothes retail {{business}} was good preparation for this role in a menswear department.
