25|$|Double {{differentials}} {{were first}} used in experiments in France starting in 1921, and found on many heavy tanks of World War II, including the German Tigers. The {{addition of a}} continuously variable output using a <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>transmission</b> was used on the Char B, providing smooth changes in turning radius that eliminated the system's main drawback. The low efficiency of this system meant it was not widely used, but rapid improvement in hydrodynamic fluid couplings made it common in the post-war era. Most Western tank designs since the 1960s have used a variation on this design, notably the M60 Patton and M1 Abrams.|$|E

50|$|<b>Hydrostatic</b> <b>transmissions</b> {{transmit}} {{all power}} hydraulically, using {{the components of}} hydraulic machinery. They are similar to electrical transmissions, but use hydraulic fluid as the power distribution system rather than electricity.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hydrostatic</b> <b>transmission</b> {{systems are}} also used in some rail applications, {{primarily}} low speed shunting and rail-maintenance vehicles.|$|E
5000|$|Both these {{examples}} are usually {{referred to as}} a hydraulic transmission or <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>transmission</b> involving a certain hydraulic [...] "gear ratio".|$|E
5000|$|The {{hydraulic}} (<b>hydrostatic)</b> <b>transmission</b> {{could be}} useful for recumbent bicycles because the hoses may be easier to route than a long chain.|$|E
50|$|Tracked loaders {{have become}} very {{sophisticated}} machines, using <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>transmissions</b> and electro-hydraulic controls to increase efficiency. Until the rise in popularity of excavators, tracked loaders had little competition digging and loading jobs.|$|R
25|$|Application of <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>transmissions</b> are {{generally}} limited to small shunting locomotives and rail maintenance equipment, {{as well as}} being used for non-tractive applications in diesel engines such as drives for traction motor fans.|$|R
50|$|Other {{applications}} include pneumatic and hydraulic motors, <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>transmissions</b> such as Honda's Hondamatic CVT, and {{air conditioner}} pumps. Also, some Stirling engines use a swashplate arrangement, e.g., Stirling Thermal Motors' STM 4-120 engine.|$|R
50|$|In 1986 FiatAgri {{transferred}} {{some of its}} tractor {{production from}} Modena to Jesi. In the same year, the company also launched the Fiatagri 180-55 crawler tractor, with a revolutionary <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>transmission</b> system.|$|E
50|$|Piston {{pumps are}} more {{expensive}} than gear or vane pumps, but provide longer life operating at higher pressure, with difficult fluids and longer continuous duty cycles. Piston pumps make up one half of a <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>transmission.</b>|$|E

50|$|Inch pedal is a {{standard}} pedal used in mobile machinery with a hydraulic pilot pressure output proportional to the pedal position, or an electronic pedal with a proportional electric signal output. The pedal is used in <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>transmissions</b> to temporarily affect the preset characteristics for hydrostatic gear ratio versus diesel engine rpm.|$|R
5000|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{attempts}} to replace <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>transmissions</b> with lower cost alternatives, but these attempts, which include variable belt types, e.g., MTD's [...] "Auto Drive", and toroidal, have various performance or perception problems that have caused their market life to be short or their market penetration to be limited.|$|R
50|$|Turbo-transmissions {{serve as}} a {{hydrodynamic}} link which converts a motor's mechanical energy into the kinetic energy of a fluid, via a torque-converter and fluid coupling, before producing the final rotary output. Here, the fluid is driven through rotor blade canals at high flow-rates and low pressure. This is where turbo-transmissions differ from similar <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>transmissions,</b> which operate using low flow-rates and high pressure according to the displacement principle.|$|R
50|$|International Harvester {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} manufacturers to provide a stepless transmission in a row crop tractor. Introduced first as an option on 656 and 544 tractors, the <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>transmission</b> would become a defining feature of the 70 Hydro and 100 Hydro models.|$|E

50|$|Closed {{loop systems}} in mobile {{equipment}} are generally {{used for the}} transmission {{as an alternative to}} mechanical and hydrodynamic (converter) transmissions. The advantage is a stepless gear ratio (continuously variable speed/torque) and a more flexible control of the gear ratio depending on the load and operating conditions. The <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>transmission</b> is generally limited to around 200 kW maximum power, as the total cost gets too high at higher power compared to a hydrodynamic transmission. Large wheel loaders for instance and heavy machines are therefore usually equipped with converter transmissions. Recent technical achievements for the converter transmissions have improved the efficiency and developments in the software have also improved the characteristics, for example selectable gear shifting programs during operation and more gear steps, giving them characteristics close to the <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>transmission.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Hydrostatic</b> <b>transmissions</b> {{have many}} benefits; however, {{they are not}} usually suited to {{machines}} that travel at higher speeds over longer distances. The hydrostatic drive {{may have been a}} contributing factor in abandoning the project. Changes in the way earthmoving is done, including the use of excavators and dumptrucks, has also eroded the market for scrapers. Therefore, this machine exhibited many revolutionary design concepts but was probably too costly to put into production in a declining market sector.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hydrostatic</b> <b>transmissions</b> for {{earth moving}} machines, such as for track loaders, are often {{equipped}} with a separate 'inch pedal' {{that is used to}} temporarily increase the diesel engine rpm while reducing the vehicle speed in order to increase the available hydraulic power output for the working hydraulics at low speeds and increase the tractive effort. The function is similar to stalling a converter gearbox at high engine rpm. The inch function affects the preset characteristics for the 'hydrostatic' gear ratio versus diesel engine rpm.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hydrostatic</b> <b>transmissions</b> use a {{variable}} displacement pump and a hydraulic motor. All power is transmitted by hydraulic fluid. These types can generally transmit more torque, but can be sensitive to contamination. Some designs are also very expensive. However, they have the advantage that the hydraulic motor can be mounted directly to the wheel hub, allowing a more flexible suspension system and eliminating efficiency losses from friction in the drive shaft and differential components. This type of transmission {{is relatively easy to}} use because all forward and reverse speeds can be accessed using a single lever.|$|R
50|$|These {{modifications}} {{meant that}} the tank's weight increased to 25 t. In spite of a new six-speed SSG 77 transmission adopted from the Panzer III, top speed dropped to as low as 10 mph on cross country terrain. An experimental version of the Ausf H was fitted with a <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>transmission</b> but was not put into production.|$|E
50|$|The next Cub Cadet {{models that}} International {{introduced}} were the models 72, 104, 124, 105, and 125. The model 72 {{was a direct}} replacement for the model 71 which used the seven-horsepower Kohler engine, three-speed direct drive transmission, and pan seat. The model 104 replaced the model 102 using the ten-horsepower Kohler engine and three-speed transmission. The model 124 replaced the model 122 using the twelve horsepower Kohler engine and three-speed direct drive transmission. The model 125 replaced the model 123 using the twelve-horsepower Kohler engine and a <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>transmission.</b> The model 105 was the first Cub Cadet to offer a ten-horsepower Kohler motor with a <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>transmission.</b> These Cub Cadet models retained the same square fenders as the previous models. The biggest difference in these Cub Cadets was their fiberglass dash which contained an ammeter. The production of the 72, 104, 124, 105, and 125 ran from 1967 to 1969.|$|E
50|$|The next design {{after the}} Cub Cadet 70 and 100 was the Cub Cadet 71, 102, and 122. The Cub Cadet 71 was the {{replacement}} for the Cub Cadet seventy and kept {{many of the same}} features as the 70 including the pan seat, optional round fenders, and seven horsepower Kohler engine. The model 102, which replaced the model 100, was fitted with a ten-horsepower Kohler engine. The Cub Cadet 122 was the first Cub Cadet Garden tractor to contain a twelve-horsepower Kohler engine. The Cub Cadet 102 and 122 retained the same frame as the models 70 and 100, but they were the first cub cadets to come standard with square fenders. Production of the 71, 102, and 122 ran from 1965 to 1967. During this production run, in 1966, International produced the Cub Cadet model 123. The model 123 was the same as the model 122, except the three speed gear driven transmission was replaced by a shaft driven <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>transmission.</b> The <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>transmission</b> allowed the operator to have complete control over their speed eliminating the requirement to clutch and choose gears. Because International thought people would be skeptical of the reliability of a <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>transmission,</b> they painted a few 123s as tigers and put them in circus acts in which operators would perform tricks on them jamming it in reverse and forward to prove the durability of the new transmission.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} common {{attachment}} for a CUT is the front-end loader or FEL. Like the larger agricultural tractors, a CUT will have an adjustable, hydraulically controlled three-point hitch. Typically, a CUT will have four-wheel drive, or more correctly four-wheel assist. Modern CUTs often feature <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>transmissions,</b> but many variants of gear-drive transmissions are also offered from low priced, simple gear transmissions to synchronized transmissions to advanced glide-shift transmissions. All modern CUTs feature government-mandated roll over protection structures just like agricultural tractors. The most well-known brands in North America include Kubota, John Deere Tractor, New Holland Ag, Case-Farmall and Massey-Ferguson. Although less common, compact backhoes are often attached to compact utility tractors.|$|R
50|$|AGCO Corporation has {{employed}} a <b>hydrostatic</b> CVT <b>transmission</b> in agricultural equipment. The transmission splits power between hydrostatic and mechanical {{transfer to the}} output shaft via a planetary gear in the forward direction of travel. In reverse the power transfer is fully hydrostatic.|$|R
50|$|Lubricants {{known as}} {{hydraulic}} fluid {{are used as}} the working fluid in <b>hydrostatic</b> power <b>transmission.</b> Hydraulic fluids comprise {{a large portion of}} all lubricants produced in the world. The automatic transmission's torque converter is another important application for power transmission with lubricants.|$|R
50|$|The ALn 772 {{units were}} the first to be {{equipped}} with an experimental Ljungström <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>transmission</b> (model OM-SRM-DF 1,15); the initial results were good. It was only years later, with age and the increased frequency of start-stop cycles required by the short-range services the units had been reassigned to, that the transmission gearing started to show heavy signs of wear and reliability problems.|$|E
50|$|The initial concept {{involved}} a giant flywheel (see Gyrobus) for storage {{connected to a}} <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>transmission.</b> The system is under development by Eaton and several other companies, primarily in heavy vehicles like buses, trucks and military vehicles. An example is the Ford F-350 Mighty Tonka concept truck shown in 2002. It features an Eaton system that can accelerate the truck to highway speeds.|$|E
50|$|The {{flywheel}} {{allows the}} direct capture of brake energy (when slowing down or descending gradients) and its re-use for acceleration (called regenerative braking). When the vehicle brakes, the <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>transmission</b> feeds the energy {{back into the}} flywheel. Since the short-term power demand for acceleration {{is provided by the}} energy stored in the flywheel, {{there is no need for}} a large engine. A variety of small engine types can be used including LPG, diesel or electric traction.|$|E
50|$|Closed-loop: Motor-return is {{connected}} {{directly to the}} pump-inlet. To keep up pressure on the low pressure side, the circuits have a charge pump (a small gearpump) that supplies cooled and filtered oil to the low pressure side. Closed-loop circuits are generally used for <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>transmissions</b> in mobile applications. Advantages: No directional valve and better response, the circuit can work with higher pressure. The pump swivel angle covers {{both positive and negative}} flow direction. Disadvantages: The pump cannot be utilized for any other hydraulic function in an easy way and cooling can be a problem due to limited exchange of oil flow. High power closed loop systems generally must have a 'flush-valve' assembled in the circuit in order to exchange much more flow than the basic leakage flow from the pump and the motor, for increased cooling and filtering. The flush valve is normally integrated in the motor housing to get a cooling effect for the oil that is rotating in the motor housing itself. The losses in the motor housing from rotating effects and losses in the ball bearings can be considerable as motor speeds will reach 4000-5000 rev/min or even more at maximum vehicle speed. The leakage flow as well as the extra flush flow must be supplied by the charge pump. A large charge pump is thus very important if the transmission is designed for high pressures and high motor speeds. High oil temperature is usually a major problem when using <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>transmissions</b> at high vehicle speeds for longer periods, for instance when transporting the machine from one work place to the other. High oil temperatures for long periods will drastically reduce the lifetime of the transmission. To keep down the oil temperature, the system pressure during transport must be lowered, meaning that the minimum displacement for the motor must be limited to a reasonable value. Circuit pressure during transport around 200-250 bar is recommended.|$|R

With Parker’s established bent-axis pump/motor technology for heavy duty mobile applications as a basis, it describes the main stages of further development and qualification for demanding automotive main drive transmissions.
