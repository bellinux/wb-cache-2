25|$|Atoms are the {{smallest}} neutral particles into which matter {{can be divided}} by chemical reactions. An atom consists of a small, <b>heavy</b> <b>nucleus</b> surrounded by a relatively large, light cloud of electrons. Each type of atom corresponds to a specific chemical element. To date, 118 elements have been discovered or created.|$|E
25|$|Fission {{reactions}} — a very <b>heavy</b> <b>nucleus,</b> after absorbing additional light particles (usually neutrons), splits {{into two}} or sometimes three pieces. This is an induced nuclear reaction. Spontaneous fission, which occurs without {{assistance of a}} neutron, is usually not considered a nuclear reaction. At most, {{it is not an}} induced nuclear reaction.|$|E
25|$|When a large fissile {{atomic nucleus}} such as {{uranium-235}} or plutonium-239 absorbs a neutron, it may undergo nuclear fission. The <b>heavy</b> <b>nucleus</b> splits into {{two or more}} lighter nuclei, (the fission products), releasing kinetic energy, gamma radiation, and free neutrons. A portion of these neutrons may later be absorbed by other fissile atoms and trigger further fission events, which release more neutrons, and so on. This {{is known as a}} nuclear chain reaction.|$|E

We use the Skyrme force model, Gogny force model, and relativistic mean field model to get the nucleon density profiles inside <b>heavy</b> <b>nuclei.</b> Once the nucleon density profiles are determined, the parameters of the nuclear α potential are fitted to the observed α decay half-lives of <b>heavy</b> <b>nuclei.</b> This approach is then applied to predict unknown α decay half-lives of <b>heavy</b> <b>nuclei.</b> To estimate the Q values of unobserved α decays, we make use of the liquid droplet model.

25|$|For positronium, {{the formula}} uses the reduced mass also, {{but in this}} case, it is exactly the {{electron}} mass divided by 2. For any value of the radius, the electron and the positron are each moving at half the speed around their common center of mass, and each has only one fourth the kinetic energy. The total kinetic energy is half {{what it would be}} for a single electron moving around a <b>heavy</b> <b>nucleus.</b>|$|E
25|$|Hoyle's work {{explained}} how the abundances {{of the elements}} increased with time as the galaxy aged. Subsequently, Hoyle's picture was expanded during the 1960s by contributions from William A. Fowler, Alastair G. W. Cameron, and Donald D. Clayton, followed by many others. The seminal 1957 review paper by E. M. Burbidge, G. R. Burbidge, Fowler and Hoyle is a well-known summary {{of the state of}} the field in 1957. That paper defined new processes for the transformation of one <b>heavy</b> <b>nucleus</b> into others within stars, processes that could be documented by astronomers.|$|E
25|$|About 6 MeV of the fission-input {{energy is}} {{supplied}} by the simple binding of an extra neutron to the <b>heavy</b> <b>nucleus</b> via the strong force; however, in many fissionable isotopes, this amount of energy {{is not enough for}} fission. Uranium-238, for example, has a near-zero fission cross section for neutrons of less than one MeV energy. If no additional energy is supplied by any other mechanism, the nucleus will not fission, but will merely absorb the neutron, as happens when U-238 absorbs slow and even some fraction of fast neutrons, to become U-239. The remaining energy to initiate fission can be supplied by two other mechanisms: one of these is more kinetic energy of the incoming neutron, which is increasingly able to fission a fissionable <b>heavy</b> <b>nucleus</b> as it exceeds a kinetic energy of one MeV or more (so-called fast neutrons). Such high energy neutrons are able to fission U-238 directly (see thermonuclear weapon for application, where the fast neutrons are supplied by nuclear fusion). However, this process cannot happen to a great extent in a nuclear reactor, as too small a fraction of the fission neutrons produced by any type of fission have enough energy to efficiently fission U-238 (fission neutrons have a mode energy of 2 MeV, but a median of only 0.75 MeV, meaning half of them have less than this insufficient energy).|$|E

25|$|The fission of a <b>heavy</b> <b>nucleus</b> {{requires}} a total input energy of about 7 to 8 million electron volts (MeV) to initially overcome the nuclear force which holds the nucleus into a spherical or nearly spherical shape, and from there, deform {{it into a}} two-lobed ("peanut") shape in which the lobes are {{able to continue to}} separate from each other, pushed by their mutual positive charge, in the most common process of binary fission (two positively charged fission products + neutrons). Once the nuclear lobes have been pushed to a critical distance, beyond which the short range strong force can no longer hold them together, the process of their separation proceeds from the energy of the (longer range) electromagnetic repulsion between the fragments. The result is two fission fragments moving away from each other, at high energy.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s Simpson Simpson and A. J. Tuzzolino {{developed}} the dust flux monitor instrument which involved a thin sheet of plastic which was polymerized {{in the presence}} of a strong electric field perpendicular to the plane of the plastic, and then electrically polarized carrying a positive electric charge on one of its surfaces and a negative charge on the other. The way it operated was such that a dust particle or <b>heavy</b> <b>nucleus</b> penetrating through the sheet first vaporizes in a small area releasing the charges, then the electrical signal indicates the location and size of the hole in the plastic which is then calibrated to give information on its speed and size. These calibrations took place from 1985 until 1989. Simpson's device was used on spacecraft Vega 1 and Vega 2 to Halley's comet in 1986, and earned him the Gagarin Medal for Space Exploration that year for his contribution towards the success of the Vega mission, as his instruments had been the only ones from the United States to encounter the comet.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the mass fractions and in-medium properties of <b>heavy</b> <b>nuclei</b> in stellar matter at characteristic densities and temperatures for supernova (SN) explosions. The individual nuclei are described within the compressible liquid-drop model {{taking into account}} modifications of bulk, surface and Coulomb energies. The equilibrium properties of nuclei and the full ensemble of <b>heavy</b> <b>nuclei</b> are calculated self-consistently. It is found that <b>heavy</b> <b>nuclei</b> in the ensemble are either compressed or decompressed depending on the isospin asymmetry of the system. The compression or decompression has a little influence on the binding energies, total mass fractions and average mass numbers of <b>heavy</b> <b>nuclei,</b> although the equilibrium densities of individual nuclei themselves are changed appreciably above one hundredth of normal nuclear density. We find that nuclear structure in single nucleus approximation deviates from the actual one obtained in the multi-nucleus description, since the density of free nucleons is different between these two descriptions. This study indicates that a multi-nucleus description is required to realistically account for in-medium effects on the nuclear structure in supernova matter.
