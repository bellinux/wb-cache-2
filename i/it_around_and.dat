25|$|Bicycles {{continued}} to evolve {{to suit the}} varied needs of riders. The derailleur developed in France between 1900 and 1910 among cyclotourists, and was improved over time. Only in the 1930s did European racing organizations allow racers to use gearing; until then {{they were forced to}} use a two-speed bicycle. The rear wheel had a sprocket {{on either side of the}} hub. To change gears, the rider had to stop, remove the wheel, flip <b>it</b> <b>around,</b> <b>and</b> remount the wheel. When racers were allowed to use derailleurs, racing times immediately dropped.|$|E
25|$|Sumatran orangutans use {{sticks to}} acquire seeds from a {{particular}} fruit. When {{the fruit of the}} Neesia tree ripens, its hard, ridged husk softens until it falls open. Inside are seeds that are highly desirable to the orangutans, but they are surrounded by fibreglass-like hairs that are painful if eaten. A Neesia-eating orangutan will select a 12cm stick, strip off the bark, and then carefully collect the hairs with it. Once the fruit is safe, the ape will eat the seeds using the stick or its fingers. Sumatran orangutans will use a stick to poke a bees' nest wall, move <b>it</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> catch the honey.|$|E

The German troops soon counterattacked and Kuznetsov reportedly repulsed it by throwing two grenades, reportedly killing six German soldiers. In the ensuing hand-to-hand fighting, he reportedly bayoneted another two soldiers but was wounded. In a later battle, he was severely wounded and discharged in late 1943.|$|E

500|$|The {{writing and}} {{formation}} of By the Way began {{immediately following the}} culmination of Californication's world tour, {{in the spring of}} 2001. As with Californication, much of the creation took place in the band members' homes and other practice locations, such as a recording studio stage. Kiedis recalled of the situation: [...] "We started finding some magic and some music and some riffs and some rhythms and some jams and some grooves, and we added to it and subtracted from it and pushed <b>it</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> put melodies to it." [...] Frusciante and Kiedis would collaborate for days straight, discussing guitar progressions and sharing lyrics. For Kiedis, [...] "writing By the Way...was a whole different experience from Californication. John was back to himself and brimming with confidence." [...] Prior to recording By the Way, the Chili Peppers decided that they would again have Rick Rubin produce the album. Rubin had, in the past, granted the Chili Peppers creative freedom on their recording material; this was something they thought essential for the album to be unique, and could only occur with his return.|$|E

500|$|Vaughn said he {{shot the}} film {{in a way it}} resembled the {{productions}} of the 1960s, with [...] "very traditional framing, and camera movement when it needs to move, not just throwing <b>it</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> whizz-bang", and using the anamorphic format [...] "to create a widescreen experience, which is emblematic of '60s movies, such as the James Bond films". The director had to hire five cinematographers - with sole credit being given to John Mathieson, who came halfway through the shoot and did [...] "forty-five percent, fifty-five percent" [...] of the film - and four assistant directors to successfully convey the look he wanted for the film. Visual effects supervisor Matt Johnson added that for the lighting of the digital interior of Cerebro, [...] "keeping with the '60s vibe, we put in some old school elements such as lens flare and chromatic aberration and edge fringing." [...] The aesthetics of the decade were also invoked by designers Simon Clowes and Kyle Cooper of Prologue Films, who were responsible for the end credits and tried to do something that [...] "could be done with traditional optical". The credits animation depicts DNA strands through simple geometric shapes, drawing inspiration from both Saul Bass and Maurice Binder's work in the Bond films.|$|E

500|$|A {{new set of}} the {{interior}} of the TARDIS was also designed, which Moffat estimated was three times bigger than the previous set. Moffat did not decide to create the new interior specifically for the new Doctor, but the brief to the set designer was to create a design that would suit Smith's Doctor. Though he loved the old set, Moffat thought {{it was time for a}} new one to [...] "surprise people", and believed that the spirit of a new era was to change everything. Piers Wenger said that it took [...] "quite a long time to get the design right" [...] and they were careful not to make it too futuristic-looking, as [...] "futuristic" [...] meant nothing to the Doctor. The set was designed by Edward Thomas. The previous TARDIS interior was shown at the beginning of [...] "The Eleventh Hour"; the Time Rotor on console had to be rebuilt due to the explosion special effects that were used in The End of Time. In [...] "The Eleventh Hour", the sonic screwdriver is destroyed, and a new version, featuring a green light and metal claws, was created. Smith liked to keep the prop with him at all times [...] "twirling <b>it</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> flicking it" [...] which resulted in him breaking four of them. The noise made by the screwdriver was added in post-production using a synthesizer. Moffat described the changes as starting with a [...] "clean slate" [...] which made sense after the previous cast and crew had left.|$|E
