25|$|The banded tunnelweb spider (Hexathele hochstetteri) {{is among}} New Zealand’s largest spiders, growing up to 20mm in body length, and is endemic to New Zealand. The {{easiest way to}} {{distinguish}} a banded tunnelweb spider {{is to look for}} the chevron design on its abdomen. The chevron pattern is described as being yellowish, whilst the rest of the abdomen is a darker brown colour. They also have an orange-brown carapace, and six spinnerets. It is these six spinnerets that ultimately distinguish Hexathele hochstetteri from other genera of Hexathelidae, such as Porrhothele, as they only have four spinnerets. Female banded tunnelweb spider eyes occupy around half their <b>head</b> <b>space,</b> whereas males differ, having slightly smaller lateral eyes.|$|E
25|$|White fuming {{nitric acid}}, pure nitric acid or WFNA, {{is very close}} to {{anhydrous}} nitric acid. It is available as 99.9% nitric acid by assay. One specification for white fuming nitric acid is that it has a maximum of 2% water and a maximum of 0.5% dissolved NO2. Anhydrous nitric acid has a density of 1.513g/cm3 and has the approximate concentration of 24 molar. Anhydrous nitric acid is a colorless mobile liquid with a density of 1.512g/cm3, which solidifies at −42°C to form white crystals. As it decomposes to NO2 and water, it obtains a yellow tint. It boils at 83°C. It is usually stored in a glass shatterproof amber bottle with twice the volume of <b>head</b> <b>space</b> to allow for pressure build up, but even with those precautions the bottle must be vented monthly to release pressure.|$|E

First, he got obsessed with Summer, and that caused the bullying storyline, and now he's dealing with his parents' problems and possible divorce. Fenmore's issues come from a place that makes sense.

2500|$|A mercury {{barometer}} has a glass tube closed {{at one end}} with an open mercury-filled reservoir at the base. [...] The weight of the mercury creates a vacuum {{in the top of}} the tube known as Torricellian vacuum. Mercury in the tube adjusts until the weight of the mercury column balances the atmospheric force exerted on the reservoir. [...] High atmospheric pressure places more force on the reservoir, forcing mercury higher in the column. [...] Low pressure allows the mercury to drop to a lower level in the column by lowering the force placed on the reservoir. Since higher temperature levels around the instrument will reduce the density of the mercury, the scale for reading the height of the mercury is adjusted to compensate for this effect. [...] The tube has to be at least as long as the amount dipping in the mercury + <b>head</b> <b>space</b> + the maximum length of the column.|$|E

2500|$|The Lee–Enfield rifle {{was derived}} from the earlier Lee–Metford, a {{mechanically}} similar black-powder rifle, which combined James Paris Lee's rear-locking bolt system with a barrel featuring rifling designed by William Ellis Metford. The Lee action cocked the striker on the closing stroke of the bolt, making the initial opening much faster and easier compared to the [...] "cock on opening" [...] (i.e., the firing pin cocks upon opening the bolt) of the Mauser Gewehr 98 design. The bolt has a relatively short bolt throw and features rear-mounted lugs and the bolt operating handle places the bolt knob just rearwards of the trigger at a favorable ergonomic position close to the operator's hand. The action features helical locking surfaces (the technical term is interrupted threading). This means that final <b>head</b> <b>space</b> is not achieved until the bolt handle is turned down all the way. The British probably used helical locking lugs to allow for chambering imperfect or dirty ammunition and that the closing cam action is distributed over the entire mating faces of both bolt and receiver lugs. This is one reason the bolt closure feels smooth. The rifle was also equipped with a detachable sheet-steel, 10-round, double-column magazine, a very modern development in its day. Originally, the concept of a detachable magazine was opposed in some British Army circles, as some feared that the private soldier might be likely to lose the magazine during field campaigns. Early models of the Lee–Metford and Lee–Enfield even used a short length of chain to secure the magazine to the rifle. To further facilitate rapid aimed fire the rifle can be cycled by most rifleman without loss of sight picture.|$|E
