50|$|Named after Cleveland's 49th mayor, United States Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare and Federal appeals judge Anthony J. Celebrezze, the Federal Building {{is typical}} of the modern, {{commercial}} office buildings of the 1960s. It displays strength in design through a purity and rich variety of materials. When construction began, protesters demonstrated against the lack of minority contractors. Problems with the foundation delayed construction. As the building was being built, a piece of the building's stainless-steel skin fell, hitting a parked car on Lakeside Avenue. As Federal agencies were moving in 1967-68, a fire hose on the 25th <b>floor</b> <b>burst</b> and water caused damage.|$|E

Suddenly, the <b>floor</b> <b>bursts</b> from under them as the leader pushes up and grabs Malachi. Malachi tells Will Henry to grab a grenade from Kearn's bag; Will Henry tosses it at Malachi and the matriarch, and they are both buried in dirt, mud and rock. The matriarch rises out of the dust, leaping towards Will Henry, who knows he only has one shot left in his gun. He aims for her groin and shoots: she dies.|$|R

Upon reaching the Marsdens' house, Mulder and Scully find the driver's charred body in the bathroom before the second <b>floor</b> <b>bursts</b> into flames. Mulder faces his phobia {{and is able to}} save the Marsden children. Scully holds L'Ively at gunpoint, but is forced to hold her fire when L'Ively informs her of the rocket fuel he has painted on the house. However, Green throws a can of rocket fuel in his face, causing him to lose control and set himself alight outside.|$|R

40|$|Microseismic {{activity}} {{observed in}} both the laboratory and underground indicates that a quiet period, associated with the closure of existing fractures and strongly influenced by coal seam microstructure, occurs prior to coal bumps. Field studies conclude that coal mine bumps occur {{against a background of}} this so-called microseismic calm. This Bureau of Mines report summarizes microseismic activity associated with face bumps and <b>floor</b> <b>bursts</b> in a deep, western U. S. coal mine. Results conclude that while bumps are often accompanied by panel-wide increases in microseismic activity, bumps are not only preceded by a localized decrease in activity, but occur within these quiet zones. The results of this study concluded that microseismic activity may be applicable to the global detection of potential bump-prone zones, but that future studies are necessary to confirm these findings and to improve the techniques for evaluating stress control effectiveness...|$|R

50|$|Fast radio bursts are bright, {{unresolved}} (pointsource-like), broadband (spanning a large {{range of}} radio frequencies), millisecond flashes found {{in parts of}} the sky outside the Milky Way. Unlike many radio sources the signal from a burst is detected {{in a short period of}} time with enough strength to stand out from the noise <b>floor.</b> The <b>burst</b> usually appears as a single spike of energy without any change in its strength over time. The bursts last for a period of several milliseconds (thousandths of a second). The bursts come from all over the sky, and are not concentrated on the plane of the Milky Way. Known FRB locations are biased by the parts of the sky that the observatories can image.|$|R

"I then {{proceeded}} to make a careful examination of the room, which confirmed me in my opinion as to the murderer's height, and furnished me with the additional details as to the Trichinopoly cigar {{and the length of}} his nails.

I could perceive that the track of blood coincided with the track of his feet. It is seldom that any man, unless he is very full-blooded, breaks out in this way through emotion, so I hazarded the opinion that the criminal was probably a robust and ruddy-faced man. Events proved that I had judged correctly.|$|R

40|$|AbstractAiming at the {{objective}} problems that {{great amount of}} precious coal resources are inhibited by water-conducting and bearing fault and become lost and wasted due to impossibility of safe extraction, the paper analyzed hydro-geological characteristics of different faults, put forward division of faults into four types with different hydro-geological properties, as follows: water-conducting fault, water ‚Äìbearing fault, water-isolating fault and water-conducting and bearing fault, summed up spatial constitutional relation among fault, coal seam and aquifer, types and formation mechanism of different water hazards caused by faults under different constitutional relation. Four types of water hazards caused by faults were given, i. e. transverse inrushing water hazard, vertical conducting water hazard, overflowing water hazard from <b>floor</b> and <b>bursting</b> water hazard from roof. Aiming at hydro-geological characteristics of faults and different types of water hazards, water control technologies and methods were proposed, including in advance pre-dewatering and drainage, directional guided inclination detection and transformation of key interval by grouting as well as remaining scientifically water-proof coal/rock pillars, which has important significance for reducing coal pillar left for fault and increasing recovery of coal resources...|$|R
5000|$|The Warao are, {{according}} to their own reports, descended from an adventurous heavenly figure [...] - [...] the primordial hunter. This man originally dwelt in a sky world which had men, but was completely devoid of all animals except birds. Hunting these heavenly birds, the founding man used his bow and arrow to strike a bird in mid-air. The bird fell from the sky and eventually hit the heavenly <b>floor.</b> The birds <b>burst</b> through the <b>floor</b> and proceeded through the clouds and towards terrestrial land (Earth) below. The hunter went to the hole in the floor made by the bird and looked through. He saw lush and fertile land (Earth) and resolved to descend to it to partake of its pleasures: beauty, abundant game, fruit, et cetera. The hunter took a long rope of heavenly cotton, tied it to a tree, and threw it through the hole and lowered himself through the clouds to what is now Earth, forsaking his sky world.|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Electrical & Computer EngineeringSteve WarrenHandgrip contractions are a {{standard}} exercise modality to evaluate muscular system performance. Most conventional ergometer systems that collect handgrip contraction data are manually controlled, placing {{a burden on}} the researcher to guide subject activity while recording the resultant data. Further, post-processing tools {{for this type of}} experiment are not standardized within the domain, which requires investigators to process their data with multiple tool sets and often create custom tool sets for that purpose. This can make experimental data difficult to compare and correlate, even within the same research group. This thesis presents updates to a hand-forearm ergometer system that automate the control and data-acquisition processes as well as provide a tool set to post process hand contraction data. The automated system utilizes a LabVIEW virtual instrument as the system centerpiece; it provides the subject/researcher interfaces and coordinates data acquisition from both traditional and new sensors. The tool set also incorporates a collection of MATLAB scripts that allow the investigator to post process these data in {{a standard}} way, such as automating the processes of noise <b>floor</b> removal, <b>burst</b> start/stop time identification, and mean/median frequency calculation in electromyograms (EMGs). The tool set {{has proven to be a}} viable support resource for experimental studies performed by the Kansas State University Human Exercise Physiology lab that target muscle fatigue in human forearms. Initial data acquired during these tests indicate the viability of the system to acquire consistent and physiologically meaningful data while providing a usable tool set for follow-on data analyses...|$|R
25|$|Sometime around 9:15 PM, police {{officers}} {{burst into the}} Lakeview Tavern and ordered the 10 staff and customers to lie on the <b>floor.</b> More police <b>burst</b> into the bar, and forced the seven men and three women into the basement. The officers fired repeatedly into the ceiling, and shot tear gas into the basement before locking the staff and customers in. Eyewitnesses said John Pegues, a tavern patron, {{was shot in the}} leg by police at this time, which an official chronology later said occurred at 9:30 PM. Patrolman Anthony Sherbinski, who rushed to the second floor to fire at snipers from the second floor window, was shot and wounded by return fire at the same time. The bar staff and patrons were not released from the basement until 10:15 PM. All the individuals were roughly handled by police, with most of the men being pistol-whipped. All ten were taken to the Fifth District Police station and locked up. Pegues was not given medical attention until 5:00 AM.|$|R
40|$|We {{have used}} the Hubble/STIS and FUSE {{archives}} of ultraviolet spectra of bright AGN to identify intergalactic Lya absorbers in nearby (z 10) spectra {{at the location of}} three diagnostic metal lines (O VI 1032, C IV 1548, Si III 1206), we detected no metal lines in any individual absorber, or in any group of absorbers using pixel co-addition techniques. The best limits on metal-line absorption in voids were set using four strong Lya absorbers with N(H I) > 10 ^{ 14 } cm^- 2, with 3 -sigma equivalent-width limits ranging from 8 mA (O VI), 7 - 15 mA (C IV), and 4 - 10 mA (Si III). Photoionization modeling yields metallicity limits Z < 10 ^{- 1. 8 +/- 0. 4 } Z_sun, from non-detections of C IV and O VI, some 6 times lower than those seen in Lya and OVI absorbers at z < 0. 1. Although the void Lya absorbers could be pristine material, considerably deeper spectra are required to rule out a universal metallicity <b>floor</b> produced by <b>bursts</b> of early star formation, with no subsequent star formation in the voids. The most consistent conclusion derived from these low-z results, and similar searches at z = 3 - 5, is that galaxy filaments have increased their mean IGM metallicity by factors of 30 - 100 since z = 3.

60|$|Throughout the ravaging {{course of}} the Christians over the temple, they had been {{followed}} with dogged perseverance, {{and at the same}} time with the most perfect impunity, by the only Pagan of all his brethren who had not sought safety by flight. This man, being acquainted with every private passage and staircase in the sacred building, was enabled to be secretly present at each fresh act of demolition, in whatever part of the edifice it might be perpetrated. From hall to hall, and from room to room, he tracked with noiseless step and glaring eye the movements of the Christian mob--now hiding himself behind a pillar, now passing into concealed cavities in the walls, now looking down from imperceptible fissures in the roof; but, whatever his situation, invariably watching from it, with the same industry of attention and the same silence of emotion, the minutest acts of spoliation committed by the most humble follower of the Christian ranks. It was only when he entered with the victorious ravagers into the vast apartment occupied by the idol Serapis that the man's countenance began to give evidence of the agony under which his heart was writhing within him. He mounted a private staircase cut in the hollow of the massive wall of the room, and gaining a passage that ran round the extremities of the ceiling, looked through a sort of lattice concealed in the ornaments of the cornice. As he gazed down and saw the soldier mounting, axe in hand, to the idol's head, great drops of perspiration trickled from his forehead. His hot, thick breath hissed through his closed teeth, and his hands strained at the strong metal supports of the lattice until they bent beneath his grasp. When the stroke descended on the image, he closed his eyes. When the fragment detached by the blow fell on the <b>floor,</b> a groan <b>burst</b> from his quivering lips. For one moment more he glared down with a gaze of horror upon the multitude at his feet, and then with frantic speed he descended the steep stairs by which he had mounted to the roof, and fled from the temple.|$|R
