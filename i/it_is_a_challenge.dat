25|$|All-fifths tuning {{has been}} {{approximated}} by the so-called “New Standard Tuning” (NST) of King Crimson’s Robert Fripp, which NST replaces all-fifths' high B {{with a high}} G. To build chords, Fripp uses “perfect intervals in fourths, fifths and octaves”, so avoiding minor thirds and especially major thirds, which are sharp in equal temperament tuning (in comparison to thirds in just intonation). <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> to adapt conventional guitar-chords to new standard tuning, {{which is based on}} all-fifths tuning. Some closely voiced jazz chords become impractical in NST and all-fifths tuning.|$|E
25|$|In 1979, M. E. Lamb {{suggested}} that the play may have borrowed {{an aspect of the}} ancient myth of Theseus: the Athenian's entry into the Labyrinth of the Minotaur. The woods of the play serve as a metaphorical labyrinth, and for Elizabethans the woods were often an allegory of sexual sin. The lovers in the woods conquer irrational passion and find their way back. Bottom with his animal head becomes a comical version of the Minotaur. Bottom also becomes Ariadne's thread which guides the lovers. In having the new Minotaur rescue rather than threaten the lovers, the classical myth is comically inverted. Theseus himself is the bridegroom of the play who has left the labyrinth and promiscuity behind, having conquered his passion. The artisans may stand in for the master craftsman of the myth, and builder of the Labyrinth, Daedalus. Even Theseus' best known speech in the play, which connects the poet with the lunatic and the lover may be another metaphor of the lover. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> for the poet to confront the irrationality he shares with lovers and lunatics, accepting the risks of entering the labyrinth.|$|E

2500|$|When he {{was asked}} whether tuning in fifths [...] {{facilitates}} [...] "new intervals or harmonies that aren't readily available in standard tuning", Robert Fripp responded, [...] "It's a more rational system, but it's also better sounding—better for chords, better for single notes." [...] To build chords, Fripp uses [...] "perfect intervals in fourths, fifths and octaves", so avoiding minor thirds and especially major thirds, which are sharp in equal temperament tuning (in comparison to thirds in just intonation). <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> to adapt conventional guitar-chords to new standard tuning, {{which is based on}} all-fifths tuning.

2500|$|In his 1965 book, Absurd Drama, Esslin wrote:The Theatre of the Absurd {{attacks the}} {{comfortable}} certainties of religious or political orthodoxy. It aims to shock its audience out of complacency, {{to bring it}} {{face to face with}} the harsh facts of the human situation as these writers see it. But the challenge behind this message is anything but one of despair. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> to accept the human condition as it is, in all its mystery and absurdity, and to bear it with dignity, nobly, responsibly; precisely [...] there are no easy solutions to the mysteries of existence, because ultimately man is alone in a meaningless world. The shedding of easy solutions, of comforting illusions, may be painful, but it leaves behind it a sense of freedom and relief. And that is why, in the last resort, the Theatre of the Absurd does not provoke tears of despair but the laughter of liberation.Playwrights commonly associated with the Theatre of the Absurd include Samuel Beckett, Eugène Ionesco, Jean Genet, Harold Pinter, Luigi Pirandello, Tom Stoppard, Friedrich Dürrenmatt, Miguel Mihura, Alejandro Jodorowsky, Fernando Arrabal, Václav Havel, Edward Albee, Malay Roy Choudhury, Tadeusz Różewicz, Sławomir Mrożek, N.F.

2500|$|On April 11, 2011, the Ninth Circuit panel {{upheld the}} {{district}} court's ban on {{parts of the}} law taking effect, thus ruling {{in favor of the}} Obama administration and against Arizona. Judge Richard Paez gave the majority opinion, in which Judge John T. Noonan, Jr. joined; Judge Carlos Bea dissented in part. [...] Paez agreed with the administration's view that the state had intruded upon federal prerogatives. Noonan wrote in his concurrence: [...] "The Arizona statute before us has become a symbol. For those sympathetic to immigrants to the United States, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> and a chilling foretaste of what other states might attempt." [...] On May 9, 2011, Governor Brewer announced that Arizona would appeal directly to the U.S. Supreme Court rather than request a hearing en banc before the Ninth Circuit; that appeal was filed on August 10, 2011. [...] In response, the Justice Department requested that the Supreme Court stay out of the case, saying that the lower courts' actions were appropriate. Observers thought it likely that the Supreme Court would take up the matter, but if it declined to step in, the case most likely would be returned to the trial judge in the District Court to review the case on its merits and determine whether the temporary injunction that blocked the law's most controversial provisions should become permanent. The Supreme Court announced in December 2011 that it granted a petition for writ of certiorari, and oral arguments took place on April 25, 2012.|$|E
