5|$|In 2015, Ben Serotta helped {{redesign}} {{the bicycle}} {{to include a}} new seat, a simpler gear shifting mechanism, fewer and brighter lights, and a European-style center <b>kickstand.</b> All of Citi Bike's bicycles were to be renovated to include this new design. However, in 2016, a thousand of the newly redesigned Citi Bikes were taken out of service due to {{a part in the}} front wheel degrading faster than expected. In early 2017, as part of a pilot program with a firm named Blaze, 250 bikes received anterior laser lights that project a teal silhouette on the ground to warn drivers and pedestrians in their path.|$|E
500|$|Kershaw's {{pitching}} style {{relies on}} deception, movement and changes of velocity. He keeps the ball hidden {{so that it}} is hard for the batter to pick up the ball and has a consistent overhand delivery on all of his pitches, he also consistently lands low on the strikezone below the catcher's knees, causing batters to chase the ball even when the ball is clearly going to hit the dirt. Out of the windup, Kershaw lowers his right foot vertically with a slight pause before moving it forward toward the plate. The motion was described during the 2015 National League Division Series as a [...] "kickstand move" [...] drawing comparison with one setting a <b>kickstand</b> on a bicycle. Out of the stretch, he uses a slide step as it makes it difficult for the base runner at first base to get a read on him. He has stated many times that he has modeled his pitching mechanics after his favorite pitcher growing up, Roger Clemens.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are three}} {{gameplay}} modes {{that can be}} used with the Switch; [...] "TV Mode" [...] with the Console docked within the Dock to support play on a large television, [...] "Tabletop Mode" [...] with the Console placed on a table or other surface using its <b>kickstand</b> for shared gaming away from a dedicated screen, or in [...] "Handheld Mode" [...] as a standard portable tablet device. Users can switch between these modes simply by placing or removing the Console from the Dock, extending or retracting the <b>kickstand,</b> and detaching or connecting the Joy-Con. Games may be designed to play only in specific modes; for example, Voez, which relies on touch-screen controls, initially could not be played in TV Mode.|$|E

2500|$|In 1976, Honda {{introduced}} the CB750A to the United States, with the A suffix designating [...] "automatic," [...] for its automatic transmission. Although the 2-speed transmission includes a torque converter typical of an automatic transmission, the transmission {{does not automatically}} change gears for the rider. Each gear is selected by a foot-controlled hydraulic valve/selector (similar in operation to a manual transmission motorcycle). The foot selector controls the application of high pressure oil to a single clutch pack (one clutch for each gear), causing the selected clutch (and gear) to engage. The selected gear remains selected until changed by the rider, or the <b>kickstand</b> is lowered (which shifts the transmission to neutral).|$|E
2500|$|The {{main unit}} of the Switch is the Console, a {{battery-powered}} tablet-like monitor that comprises an LCD screen measuring [...] on its diagonal, {{the same as the}} Wii U GamePad. The unit itself measures [...] and weighs [...] The screen supports ten-point multi-touch capacitive sensing and includes haptic technology from Immersion Corporation. The LCD screen supports resolutions up to 720p (1280Ã—720 px). The Console includes a 3.5mm audio jack, stereo speakers {{on the bottom of the}} unit, a USB-C port for charging while out of the Dock, and a <b>kickstand</b> on the back side. The unit also includes slots for a game card (cartridge-based media) and a microSD external storage card to be installed or removed. The Console has rails on the side, into which the Joy-Con controllers can be slid when removed from the base. An ambient light sensor on the front of the Console can be used to control the screen's brightness.|$|E

They were from the conglomerate of session musicians known as The Wrecking Crew, which had a rotating lineup of the same basic people. For instance, if Hal Blaine wasn't the drummer, then it was Earl Palmer. These fictional bands issued recordings as The Sunsets, The Four Speeds, Gary Usher and The Usherettes (aka: The Honeys), The Competitors, The Go-Go's, The Devons, The Ghouls, The Super Stocks, The Indigos, The Revells, The <b>Kickstands</b> and The Knights.

2500|$|At mid-century {{there were}} two {{predominant}} bicycle styles for recreational cyclists in North America. Heavyweight cruiser bicycles, preferred by the typical (hobby) cyclist, featuring balloon tires, pedal-driven [...] "coaster" [...] brakes and only one gear, were popular for their durability, comfort, streamlined appearance, and a significant array of accessories (lights, bells, springer forks, speedometers, etc..). Lighter cycles, with hand brakes, narrower tires, and a three-speed hub gearing system, often imported from England, first became popular in the United States in the late 1950s. These comfortable, practical bicycles usually offered generator-powered headlamps, safety reflectors, <b>kickstands,</b> and frame-mounted tire pumps. In the United Kingdom, {{like the rest of}} Europe, cycling was seen as less of a hobby, and lightweight but durable bikes had been preferred for decades.|$|R
2500|$|The {{interior}} of the Guggenheim's spiral ramp was covered in reflective stainless steel, a design by Frank Gehry, with a stylized pavement under the tires of the exhibits, and the bikes not leaned over on their <b>kickstands,</b> but rather standing up, as if in motion, held by thin wires and small clear plastic chocks under the wheels. [...] Early examples from the 19th century, steam cycles and three wheelers mostly, were in a single room near the entrance. [...] The first series produced motorcycle, and the first motorcycle included in the exhibition catalog proper, the 1894 Hildebrand & WolfmÃ¼ller stood outside the gallery.

5000|$|The {{earliest}} known <b>kickstand</b> {{was designed}} by Albert Berruyer in 1869, and since then kickstands have been independently reinvented many times. It was mounted below the handlebars, so was much longer than more recent designs. A shorter model was patented by Eldon Henderson in 1926. [...] In the 1930s, a [...] "smaller, more convenient" [...] <b>kickstand</b> was developed by Joseph Paul Treen.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{problem was}} Schwinn's failure {{to design and}} market its {{bicycles}} to specific, identifiable buyers, especially {{the growing number of}} cyclists interested in road racing or touring. Instead, most Schwinn derailleur bikes were marketed to the general leisure market, equipped with heavy [...] "old timer" [...] accessories such as <b>kickstands</b> that cycling aficionados had long since abandoned. More and more cyclists, especially younger buyers, began to insist on stronger steel alloys (which allowed for lighter frames), responsive frame geometry, aluminum components, advanced derailleur shifting, and multiple gears. When they failed to find what they wanted at Schwinn, they went elsewhere. While the Paramount still sold in limited numbers to this market, the model's customer base began to age, changing from primarily bike racers to older, wealthier riders looking for the ultimate bicycle. Schwinn sold an impressive 1.5 million bicycles in 1974, but would pay the price for failing to keep up with new developments in bicycle technology and buying trends.|$|R
40|$|The {{well-being}} of employees {{is currently a}} central matter of concern both {{in public and private}} companies. If employees do not feel well, in the last instance they might experience a burn out or fall ill from stress and thus add to the highly costly yet ever growing number filling up the statistics of this modern epidemic. In short, well-being is key to productivity. For sure {{this is not a new}} story, but at the core of organization and management theory: how to best organize the human resources of production balancing off the need for increased productivity and the preservation of physical and mental resources of the worker? In contrast to classic principles such as Taylorâ€™s scientific management, it seems today generally agreed that well-being thrives when work is organized by principles of â€˜flexibilityâ€™, â€˜learningâ€™, â€˜empowermentâ€™ and â€˜creativityâ€™. However, at the same time workplaces and organizations are under an enormous pressure towards standardization and optimization. This dissertation investigates empirically competing or intersecting ways of organizing well-being and productivity, with an analytic outset in the work task, departing from historically generated, however still prevalent, dichotomies and normativities of standardization and flexibility respectively. The empirical case of the dissertation is the organization of postal work in a big and formerly publicly run distribution company in Denmark. Based on an ethnographic field work and the employment of an auto-photographic method, the dissertation investigates how the current and simultaneous efforts of standardization and flexibility configure the well-being(s) and productivities of postal work. The theoretical framework is primarily informed by Actor Network Theory and the dissertation attend to a detailed investigation of how well-being and productivity are enacted in the daily work practices and the constant shifting/delegation going on between the inscribed postal worker of work tools, standard procedures and management programs on the one side and the routinized bodies of the postal workers on the other. Most of the time this results in â€˜working compatibilitiesâ€™ silently enacting bodies-with-standards that are both productive and well. At other times, however, controversy and conflicts arise, pointing to the fact that the presence of multiple modes of organizing are not always productive. The empirical chapters departs from selected auto-photographs that prompt different unfoldings of the way postal work is organized â€“ or sought organized â€“ and the way well-being and productivity arise as effects of these organizations. In this unfolding the analysis proceed on a tension between phenomenological and actor-network theoretical readings of empirical material creating a patchwork-like assemblage of postal work. This involves a stitching together of highly mundane, corporeal practices and material such as bicycles and <b>kickstands,</b> personal experiences, the researcherâ€™s interpretations, the technical scripts of electric bikes, the norms of postal workers, the discourse of management and the political-economic developments of European postal markets. Through the empirical chapters, the dissertation depicts postal work not as a story of standardization versus flexibility, but as a constant â€˜jugglingâ€™ and balancing act between them. This is not a story of humanization or the opposite, it is both at once. It is not a story of stabilization or perpetual change, it is both at once. It is a story of the hanging-togetherness of an organization that displays multiple versions of well-being and productivity as well as multiple controversies as a result of this. Depending on the stakes one has in this complex organizational set-up, whether one is the postal worker, the local manager, the HR consultant or perhaps the customer, preferences will differ, and indeed this is an important discussion. What is the better way to organize postal work? The analysis presented in the dissertation will not deliver the answer to this, but hopefully make the discussion a more qualified one, by displacing old truths. Having as point of departure and final emphasis a heuristics of the work task, the thesis aims to contribute to a specification of organization theory, HRM and work environment theorizing, which otherwise tend to have lost its primary object: work...|$|R

5000|$|The Surface and Surface Pro lines {{feature a}} <b>kickstand</b> which flips {{out from the}} back of the device to prop it up, {{allowing}} the device to be stood up at an angle hands-free. According to Microsoft, this is great for watching movies, video chatting, and typing documents. According to some reviewers, this <b>kickstand</b> is uncomfortable to use in one's lap and means the device won't fit on shallow desks. The first generation has a <b>kickstand</b> that can be set to a 22 degrees angle position. The second generation added a 55 degrees angle position which according to Microsoft makes the device more comfortable to type on the lap. The Surface 3 features three angle positions: 22, 44, and 60 degrees. The Surface Pro 3 is the first device to have a continuous <b>kickstand</b> that can be set at any angles between 22 and 150 degrees.
