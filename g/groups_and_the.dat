5|$|Abortion activist Henry Morgentaler's {{appointment}} to the order on 1 July 2008 not only {{marked the first time}} the Advisory Council had not been unanimous in its decision, but also proved {{to be one of the}} most controversial appointments in the order's history, drawing both praise from abortion rights <b>groups</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ire of Members of Parliament, groups opposing abortion, and religious leaders. The latter organized protests outside of Rideau Hall on 9 July, while compatriots did the same in front of Government House in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, the official residence of that province's lieutenant governor.|$|E

5|$|Babakotia is an extinct genus of {{medium-sized}} lemur, or strepsirrhine primate, from Madagascar {{that contains}} a single species, Babakotia radofilai. Together with Palaeopropithecus, Archaeoindris, and Mesopropithecus, it forms the family Palaeopropithecidae, {{commonly known as the}} sloth lemurs. The name Babakotia comes from the Malagasy name for the indri, babakoto, to which it and all other sloth lemurs are closely related. Due to its mix of morphological traits that show intermediate stages between the slow-moving smaller sloth lemurs and the suspensory large sloth lemurs, it has helped determine the relationship between both <b>groups</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> closely related and extinct monkey lemurs.|$|E
5|$|Feeding {{is usually}} in small <b>groups</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> bird takes mainly insects. Breeding usually starts in March, with the birds {{building}} their nest high in an acacia tree.

It is possible that {{more than just the}} breeding pair visit the nest and that the young of previous years help in rearing the young.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, British {{broadcaster}} Channel 4 commissioned shipwreck hunter David Mearns and his company, Blue Water Recoveries, {{to locate}} the wreck of Hood, and if possible, produce underwater footage of both the battlecruiser and her attacker, Bismarck.

Mearns had spent the previous six years privately researching the fate of Hood with the goal of finding the battlecruiser, and had acquired the support of the Royal Navy, the HMS Hood Association and other veterans <b>groups,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> last living survivor, Ted Briggs.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the effect of {{childbirth}} delivery method on vaginal pressure and abdominal thickness during the Valsalva maneuver (VAL). [Subjects] Thirty healthy female volunteers (26 – 39 years of age) were selected for this research. Their delivery histories were: nulliparous 10, vaginal delivery 10, and Cesarean delivery 10. None of the participants had a history of incontinence. [Methods] In the crook-lying position, a perineometer probe was inserted into <b>the</b> vagina <b>and</b> <b>the</b> transducer was placed transversely on the right side of the body during the Valsalva maneuver. [Results] There were significant differences in the thickness of the transverses abdominis (TrA) between in all <b>the</b> <b>groups</b> rest <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Valsalva maneuver, <b>and</b> there were significant differences in the internus oblique (IO) in the nulliparous group. During the Valsalva maneuver, there were sig-nificant differences in the TrA between <b>the</b> nulliparous <b>group</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> vaginal delivery <b>group,</b> <b>and</b> there were sig-nificant differences in the IO between <b>the</b> nulliparous delivery <b>group</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> vaginal delivery <b>group,</b> <b>and</b> between <b>the</b> nulliparous <b>group</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Cesarean section <b>group.</b> Delivery history changed vaginal pressure, and there were significant differences between <b>the</b> nulliparous <b>group</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> vaginal delivery <b>group,</b> <b>and</b> between <b>the</b> nulliparous <b>group</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Cesarean delivery <b>group.</b> [Conclusion] Pregnancy <b>and</b> delivery method may affect pelvic floor and abdominal muscles during the Valsalva maneuver...|$|R

5|$|One of {{the first}} modern {{histories}} of the Arab nation {{in contrast to a}} history of an individual Arab country was composed by Darwaza in the late 1920s under the title Lessons of Arab History: From Antiquity to Present Times.

The book was intended {{to be used as a}} textbook in primary and secondary schools throughout the British Mandates of Palestine and later Iraq, hence its simplified and direct language.

The Stord Bridge was conceived after the decision to combine the crossing with the Bømlafjord Tunnel.

Construction was undertaken by a joint venue between NCC and HBG Steel Structures. Construction started in 1999 {{and was the first}} bridge in Norway to have the cables spun on-site.

Ultimately the Clinton plan failed amid an unprecedented barrage of negative advertising funded by politically conservative <b>groups</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> health insurance industry and due to concerns that it was overly complex.
