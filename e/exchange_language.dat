In this respect, <b>language</b> <b>exchanges</b> have a similar role as study abroad programs and language immersion programs in creating an environment where the language student must use the foreign language for genuine communication outside of a classroom setting. Language Travelling has increased significantly over the last three years, with an increase of 67%.

5000|$|In modern contexts, [...] "language exchange" [...] {{most often}} {{refers to the}} mutual {{teaching}} of partners' first <b>languages.</b> <b>Language</b> <b>exchanges</b> are generally considered helpful for developing language proficiency, especially in speaking fluency and listening comprehension. <b>Language</b> <b>exchanges</b> that take place through writing or text chats also improve reading comprehension and writing ability.

40|$|In {{the context}} of {{distance}} language learning, speaking is frequently perceived as the most challenging skill; this paper reports on a 12 -week summer <b>language</b> <b>exchange</b> programme providing students with new ways of practising their oral abilities. Students who completed an undergraduate beginners’ language module took part in regular online, synchronous <b>language</b> <b>exchange</b> sessions with a partner. This paper analyses the impact of {{taking part in a}} <b>language</b> <b>exchange</b> task on the students’ motivation. The mixed methods research included an activity perception questionnaire (based on Deci, Eghrari, Patrick and Leone, 1994) to investigate the motivation of participants whilst undertaking a specific <b>language</b> <b>exchange</b> session, as well as qualitative data from both the questionnaire and the project discussion forum. The <b>language</b> <b>exchange</b> programme provides the opportunity for learners to take ownership of their learning and personalize it, and functions as a bridge between formal and informal learning. However, despite the enjoyment and interest provided by this type of experience, it is not without stress, and requires self-determination and autonomy to result in a positive and sustainable learning experience. ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the Emergency Data <b>Exchange</b> <b>Language</b> Resource Messaging (EDXL-RM) Specification is to provide a set of {{standard}} formats for XML emergency response messages. These Resource Messages are specifically designed as payloads of Emergency Data <b>Exchange</b> <b>Language</b> Distribution Element- (EDXL-DE)-routed messages. Together EDXL-DE and EDXL-RM are intended to expedite all activities associated with resources needed to respond and adapt to emergency incidents. The Distribution Element may {{be thought of as a}} [...] "container". It provides the information to route [...] "payload" [...] message sets (such as Alerts or Resource Messages), by including key routing information such as distribution type, geography, incident, and sender/recipient IDs.The Resource Message is constrained to the set of Resource Message Types contained in this specification. The Resource Message is intended to be the payload or one of the payloads of the Distribution Element which contains it.|$|E

Countries such as Belgium and Switzerland found the language exchange program very easy to run as there were many languages spoken in the one country. French and German youth picked up language exchange in 1968 which then spread to Turkey and Madrid.|$|E
50|$|A dialect of a {{programming}} language or a data <b>exchange</b> <b>language</b> is a (relatively small) variation or extension of the language that does not change its intrinsic nature. With languages such as Scheme and Forth, standards may be considered insufficient, inadequate or illegitimate by implementors, so often they will deviate from the standard, making a new dialect. In other cases, a dialect is created {{for use in a}} domain-specific language, often a subset. In the Lisp world, most languages that use basic S-expression syntax and Lisp-like semantics are considered Lisp dialects, although they vary wildly, as do, say, Racket and Clojure. As it is common for one language to have several dialects, it can become quite difficult for an inexperienced programmer to find the right documentation. The BASIC {{programming language}} has many dialects.|$|E
5000|$|The Disaster Management eGov Initiative of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) {{determined}} in 2004 {{to launch a}} project to develop interagency emergency data communications standards. It called together a group of national emergency response practitioner leaders and sought their guidance on requirements for such standards. In June, 2004 the first such meeting identified {{the need for a}} common distribution element for all emergency messages. Subsequent meetings of a Standards Working Group developed detailed requirements and a draft specification for such a distribution element (DE).During the same period the DM Initiative was forming a partnership with industry members of the Emergency Interoperability Consortium (EIC) to cooperate in the development of emergency standards. EIC had been a leading sponsor of the Common Alerting Protocol (CAP). Both organizations desired to develop an expanded family of data formats for exchanging operational information beyond warning.EIC members participated {{in the development of the}} DE, and in the broader design of the design of a process for the development of additional standards. This was named Emergency Data <b>Exchange</b> <b>Language</b> (EDXL).The goal of the EDXL project is to facilitate emergency information sharing and data exchange across the local, state, tribal, national and non-governmental organizations of different professions that provide emergency response and management services. EDXL will accomplish this goal by focusing on the standardization of specific messages (messaging interfaces) to facilitate emergency communication and coordination particularly when more than one profession is involved. It is not just an [...] "emergency management" [...] domain exercise.It is a national effort including a diverse and representative group of local, state and federal emergency response organizations and professionals, following a multi-step process. Just as a data-focused effort targets shared data elements, the EDXL process looks for shared message needs, which are common across a broad number of organizations. The objective is to rapidly deliver implementable standard messages, in an incremental fashion, directly to emergency response agencies in the trenches, providing seamless communication and coordination supporting each particular process. The effort first addresses the most urgent needs and proceeds to subsequent message sets in a prioritized fashion. The goal is to incrementally develop and deliver standards.EDXL is intended as a suite of emergency data message types including resource queries and requests, situation status, message routing instructions and the like, needed in the context of cross-disciplinary, cross-jurisdictional communications related to emergency response.The priorities and requirements are created by the DM EDXL Standards Working Group (SWG) which is a formalized group of emergency response practitioners, technical experts, and industry.The draft DE specification was trialed by a number of EIC members starting in October, 2004. In November, 2004, EIC formally submitted the draft to the OASIS Emergency Management Technical Committee for standardization.|$|E
