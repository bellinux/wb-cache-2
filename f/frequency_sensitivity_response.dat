The new function exposes the frequency-dependent <b>sensitivity</b> of the <b>frequency</b> <b>responses</b> used in the identification to perturbations of the model parameters. This information is employed to tailor the model identification process for increased identification efficiency. Improved formulations of the frequency response matching and the accuracy metrics determination using the <b>frequency</b> <b>response</b> <b>sensitivity</b> function are introduced that substantially reduce the computational cost of the solution. Simulated flight test data are used to validate a direct state space ma-trix identification process incorporating the <b>frequency</b> <b>response</b> <b>sensitivity</b> function.

In TKBa, stimuli generate graded, low- amplitude (2 - 15 mV) subliminal responses of variable long duration (up to 450 ms). A full all-or-none slow response is generated when a subliminal response depolarizes the membrane to about [...] 35 mV. Subliminal response amplitude and rate of rise augment with stimulus intensity-duration product. For a fixed stimulus, the subliminal response is larger and faster at higher frequencies. Sudden changes in stimulus frequency or time course induce changes in subliminal response tha take four to eight cycles to attain steady state. For a fixed stimulus, slow response latency shortens progressively {{during the first few}} cycles after a sudden increase in frequency or when a rested preparation is excited (latency adaptation phenomenon, LAP). Slow response threshold stimulus requirements decrease during LAP (excitability hysteresis). The degree of excitability hysteresis is dependent on stimulation frequency and is more pronounced at higher <b>frequencies.</b> <b>Frequency</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of subliminal <b>response</b> (which causes <b>frequency</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of slow <b>response</b> excitability) is explained in terms of a transient state of enhancement set up by each stimulus.

In this study, we investigated the impact of variation in 5 -HTT expression on subsecond fluctuations in extracellular 5 -HT concentrations ([5 -HT](o)). Stimulus-evoked [5 -HT](o) was detected using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry at carbon-fibre microelectrodes in the substantia nigra in brain slices from 5 -HTT knockout (KO) and 5 -HTT over-expressing (OE) mice. Compared with wild-type (WT) controls, evoked [5 -HT](o) was greater in KO and less in OE mice. In WT controls, evoked [5 -HT](o) was frequency-sensitive; however, in both KO and OE mice, evoked [5 -HT](o) showed a striking loss of <b>frequency</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> The latter was observed in WT mice after application of a 5 -HTT blocker.

40|$|The {{ability of}} the Lorentz force to link a {{mechanical}} displacement to an electrical current presents a strong interest for medical acoustics, and three applications were studied in this thesis. In {{the first part of}} this work, a hydrophone was developed for mapping the particle velocity of an acoustic field. This hydrophone was constructed using a thin copper wire and an external magnetic field. A model was elaborated to determine the relationship between the acoustic pressure and the measured electrical current, which is induced by Lorentz force when the wire vibrates in the acoustic field of an ultrasound transducer. The built prototype was characterized and its spatial resolution, <b>frequency</b> <b>response,</b> <b>sensitivity,</b> robustness and directivity response were investigated. An imaging method called Lorentz Force Electrical Impedance Tomography was also studied. In this method, a biological tissue is vibrated by ultrasound in a magnetic field, which induces an electrical current by Lorentz force. The electrical impedance of the tissue can be deduced from the measurement of the current. This technique was applied for imaging a gelatin phantom, a beef muscle sample, and a thermal lesion in a chicken breast sample. This showed the method may be useful for providing additional contrast to conventional ultrasound imaging. Finally, this thesis demonstrated that shear waves can be generated in soft tissues using Lorentz force. This work was performed by applying an electrical current with two electrodes in a soft solid placed in a magnetic field. Shear waves were observed in gelatin phantom and liver sample.

40|$|While {{originally}} developed to deploy air bags for the automotive industry, Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) based accelerometers {{have found their}} way into everything from video game controllers to cells phones. As prices drop and capabilities improve, it is expected that the use of accelerometers will further expand in the coming years. Accelerometers currently have the second highest MEMS sales volume, trailing only pressure sensors [1]. In this work several single and three-axis accelerometers are designed, fabricated, and tested under a variety of conditions. The designed accelerometers are all based off of the piezoresistive effect, where the value of a resistor changes with applied mechanical stress [2]. When accelerated, the inertia of a suspended proof mass causes stress on piezoresistors placed on support arms. The corresponding changes in these resistor values are then converted to an output voltage using a Wheatstone bridge. To sense acceleration independently in all three axes, structures with three distinct modes of vibration and three sets of Wheatstone bridges are used. Devices were fabricated at the Semiconductor and Microsystems Fabrication Laboratory (SMFL), located at RIT. A modified version of the RIT bulk MEMS process was used, consisting of 65 steps, 7 photolithography masks, bulk silicon diaphragm etch, and top hole release etch [3]. Unfortunately the finished chips show poor aluminum step coverage into contact vias and over polysilicon lines. This results in open circuits throughout the chip, prohibiting proper operation. Process corrections have been identified, and with proper fabrication the designs are still expected to yield working devices.

40|$|The spatial {{sensitivity}} of the human visual system depends on stimulus color: achromatic gratings can be resolved at relatively high spatial <b>frequencies</b> while <b>sensitivity</b> to isoluminant color contrast {{tends to be more}} low-pass. Models of early spatial vision often assume that the receptive field size of pattern-sensitive neurons is correlated with their spatial <b>frequency</b> <b>sensitivity</b> - larger receptive fields are typically associated with lower optimal spatial frequency. A strong prediction of this model is that neurons coding isoluminant chromatic patterns should have, on average, a larger receptive field size than neurons sensitive to achromatic patterns. Here, we test this assumption using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We show that while spatial <b>frequency</b> <b>sensitivity</b> depends on chromaticity in the manner predicted by behavioral measurements, population receptive field (pRF) size measurements show no such dependency. At any given eccentricity, the mean pRF size for neuronal populations driven by luminance, opponent red/green and S-cone isolating contrast, are identical. Changes in pRF size (for example, an increase with eccentricity and visual area hierarchy) are also identical across the three chromatic conditions. These results suggest that fMRI measurements of receptive field size and spatial resolution can be decoupled under some circumstances - potentially reflecting a fundamental dissociation between these parameters at the level of neuronal populations...|$|R
