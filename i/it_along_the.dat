5|$|The 5 o'clock wave is {{a fictional}} theory on {{the reasons for}} Wagga Wagga's {{sporting}} success. According to the local urban myth, at precisely 5 o'clock arrives a giant wave which flushes a secret nutrient into the Murrumbidgee River following the release {{of water from the}} Blowering and Burrinjuck Dams. The wave is said to continue down river at high speed, and indeed visitors are told it is so powerful that surfers can ride <b>it</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> meandering river until it reaches the town of Narrandera.|$|E
5|$|The Superliner I cars stored {{waste in}} onboard {{retention}} tanks, but then macerated and dumped <b>it</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> tracks once the train had attained a preset speed. This was an improvement on the Hi-Levels, which dumped {{directly to the}} tracks. Growing public concern about such dumping led {{to the adoption of}} a full-retention system in the Superliner IIs. They were the first long-distance cars with such a system. The Superliner I cars were retrofitted with a full-retention system in the early 1990s.|$|E
5|$|When a {{wave train}} strikes a wall at an oblique angle, the {{reflected}} wave train departs at the supplementary angle causing a cross-hatched wave interference pattern {{known as the}} clapotis gaufré ("waffled clapotis"). In this situation, the individual crests formed {{at the intersection of}} the incident and reflected wave train crests move parallel to the structure. This wave motion, when combined with the resultant vortices, can erode material from the seabed and transport <b>it</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> wall, undermining the structure until it fails.|$|E

5|$|A second road in California {{was built}} by Horace Gasquet, who {{acquired}} a stand of trees at the present site of Gasquet, California— where the North and Middle Forks of the Smith River converge— in 1857. In 1881, he began to build a corduroy road from what had become Gasquet Flats to the plank road at the state line near Oregon Mountain, shown as Old Gasquet Toll Road on USGS maps. Tolls were charged starting in 1882, and in 1887 the road was completed. Gasquet also built a free road from Gasquet Flats along the Smith River {{to the mouth of}} the South Fork, including a suspension bridge across that waterway, and Del Norte County extended <b>it</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> Smith River and Mill Creek and over Howland Summit to the Crescent City Plank Road just east of Crescent City.|$|E
5|$|Black can try {{the minor}} line 4...Nc6 that delays the {{development}} of its dark-square bishop, to develop <b>it</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> a1–h8 diagonal instead of the a3–f8 diagonal, depending on the circumstances. But the main line is 4...Bc5 to attack the f2-pawn, forcing 5.e3, blocking in White's bishop on c1, so that after 5...Nc6 White will not have enough pieces to protect his e5-pawn in the long run. Placing the bishop on the c5-square also has subtler points, as Tseitlin explains:At first sight the bishop on c5 lacks prospects, being held at bay by the pawn on e3, and is insecure {{in view of the}} threat to exchange it by Nc3–a4/e4. In reality, posting the bishop here has a deep strategic significance. It holds up the advance of the e- and the f-pawns (assuming the white bishop will go to b2), and thereby secures e5 as a future knight outpost, which in turn restricts the activity of both White's bishops. As to the exchanging threat, the bishop may conveniently retreat on a7 or f8, or even in some cases remain on c5 with support from a pawn on b6.|$|E
5|$|Danielle {{levelled}} off {{somewhat in}} intensity after that round of rapid intensification, only gradually strengthening afterward due to structural {{changes in the}} storm related to the small wind field relative {{to the size of}} the eye. Nonetheless, Danielle became a Category2 hurricane on the afternoon of August 15 as it approached the subtropical ridge which blocked the continued westward movement. Beginning late on August 15, at about 35°W, Danielle began to recurve to the northwest and eventually north while continuing to gradually strengthen. Early on August 16, the recurvature became more pronounced, and Danielle turned abruptly northward in the central Atlantic Ocean as an upper-level trough opened up a large break in the ridge. That movement took <b>it</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> eastern side of the subtropical ridge, preventing Danielle from moving any farther west and becoming any threat to North America or the Caribbean. While moving northwest, Danielle strengthened a bit more, reaching its peak intensity of 110mph (175km/h), just under Category3 intensity, on the afternoon of August 16.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the monsoon}} surge, Abe {{returned}} to its original west-northwestward track, further intensifying to become a Category2-equivalent typhoon at 12:00UTC on August29. A weakness appeared in the subtropical ridge in association with a short-wave trough, and Typhoon Abe recurved through this weakness, taking <b>it</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> coast of China. Prior to making landfall, Abe attained a minimum atmospheric pressure of 955millibars (hPa; 28.20inHg) on August29 at 18:00UTC {{as determined by the}} JMA. It was found by the JTWC that Abe's one-minute sustained winds peaked at 165km/h (105mph) at 00:00UTC August30, and the JMA determined that its ten-minute sustained winds peaked at 140km/h (85mph) at 18:00UTC on August29. As a direct result of this interaction with land, Abe weakened to a tropical storm at 12:00UTC on August31, entering the Yellow Sea and crossing South Korea in the 30hours that followed. It was determined at 18:00UTC on September1 that the storm had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. The JTWC ceased tracking the system at 06:00UTC September2, and the JMA followed suit 36hours later.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the comets}} seen {{close to the}} Sun seem to have reached their current {{positions}} through gravitational perturbation of the Oort cloud by the tidal force exerted by the Milky Way. Just as the Moon's tidal force deforms Earth's oceans, causing the tides to rise and fall, the galactic tide also distorts the orbits of bodies in the outer Solar System. In the charted regions of the Solar System, these effects are negligible compared to {{the gravity of the}} Sun, but in the outer reaches of the system, the Sun's gravity is weaker and the gradient of the Milky Way's gravitational field has substantial effects. Galactic tidal forces stretch the cloud along an axis directed toward the galactic centre and compress <b>it</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> other two axes; these small perturbations can shift orbits in the Oort cloud to bring objects close to the Sun. The point at which the Sun's gravity concedes its influence to the galactic tide is called the tidal truncation radius. It lies at a radius of 100,000 to 200,000 AU, and marks the outer boundary of the Oort cloud.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the opening}} of Kristiansund Airport, Kvernberget, Braathens SAFE applied for a {{concession}} to fly to <b>it</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> West Coast, as well as the direct route from Oslo. SAS applied to fly the Oslo-service. The ministry wanted Braathens SAFE to fly the route with a concession granted to SAS, but Braathens SAFE rejected this. Instead, they were granted both the routes on temporary basis. The new airport received three daily flights to Oslo, of which two went via Ålesund, and four services on the West Coast route. At the same time, there was a discussion about who was to operate the new STOL-airports on the West Coast. Braathens SAFE stated that they wanted a local airline to do the flying, and chose not to apply. The concession was granted to Widerøe, and Braathens SAFE subsequently bought part of the airline.|$|E

5|$|Travelling to East Germany, Bond infiltrates {{the circus}} and {{finds out that}} Orlov {{replaced}} the Soviet treasures with a nuclear warhead, primed to explode during the circus show at a US Air Force base in West Germany. The explosion would trigger Europe into seeking disarmament {{in the belief that}} the bomb was a US one that detonated by accident, leaving its borders open to a Soviet invasion. Bond takes Orlov's car, drives <b>it</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> train tracks and boards the moving circus train. Orlov gives chase, but is killed at the border by East German guards, after they mistake Orlov for a defector. Bond kills the twin knife-throwing assassins Mischka and Grischka to avenge the murder of 009, and, after falling from the train, commandeers a car to get to the airbase. Bond penetrates the base, and disguises himself as a clown to evade the West German police. He attempts to convince Octopussy that Khan has betrayed her by showing her one of the treasures found in Orlov's car, which she was to smuggle for him. Octopussy realizes that she has been tricked, and assists Bond in deactivating the warhead.|$|E

25|$|In 2008 Surrey County Cricket Club, tenants of The Oval, {{announced}} plans to redevelop <b>it</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> side nearest the gas holders. However, their redevelopment plans were objected to by the Health and Safety Executive because of the proximity to the gas holders and amid fears that they might explode despite not cracking or leaking since construction.

25|$|The {{main highway}} to France {{runs to the}} {{northeast}} through Tolosa. The town lies in the Oria River valley and is surrounded by high hills. Since the town was on a main communication route, the French had buttressed Tolosa's ancient walls with blockhouses and protected the town gates with palisades. Foy placed Deconchy's brigade in Tolosa. Michel Louis Joseph Bonté's brigade and the Italians held a position southeast of town behind a stream. Foy's second brigade defended the hill of Jagoz, closer to the town. Rouget's brigade held the high ground {{on the west bank}} of the Oria. Maucune's division was on the main highway behind the town, in reserve. Foy's position was strong against an enemy attacking <b>it</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> highway.

25|$|Strabo {{says that}} Ierne (Ireland) is under 5000 stadia (7.1°) north of this line. These figures place Celtica around {{the mouth of}} the Loire river, an emporium for the trading of British tin. The part of Ireland {{referenced}} is the vicinity of Belfast. Pytheas then would either have crossed the Bay of Biscay from the coast of Spain to {{the mouth of the}} Loire, or reached <b>it</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> coast, crossed the English channel from the vicinity of Brest, France to Cornwall, and traversed the Irish Sea to reach the Orkney Islands. A statement of Eratosthenes attributed by Strabo to Pytheas, that the north of the Iberian Peninsula was an easier passage to Celtica than across the Ocean, is somewhat ambiguous: apparently he knew or knew of both routes, but he does not say which he took.|$|E
25|$|And yet, for all that, Halbertsma's {{literary}} works {{did not take}} centerstage in his life: that place was reserved for his scientific non-fiction books. More than fifty years he laboured to complete his dictionary of Western Frisian titled Lexicon Frisicum, for which he chose Latin as the descriptive language, but it remained unfinished. He organised <b>it</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> lines of the German dictionary by the Brothers Grimm, but became enmeshed in the addition of insertions and in reworkings, and in writing long semantic etymologies, {{a part of the}} work for which he especially had a predilection. In the end, he never got past the letter F, and the dictionary remained a manuscript, which was published in its unfinished form after Halbertsma's death, in 1872. In the 20th century, the material Halbertsma gathered for his Lexicon Frisicum was used by de Frisian Academy to develop several Western Frisian dictionaries, notably the 25 part Wurdboek fan de Fryske Taal ("Dictionary of the Western Frisian Language"; published 1984–2011).|$|E
25|$|After a “hand” within thirty {{yards of}} the Wanderers’ lines, Weir got possession, and, {{successfully}} charging the English forwards, {{passed it on to}} Herriot, who in turn placed it to Campbell, who by a well judged kick dropped the ball just below the bar, thus securing another goal for the Scotsmen in sixteen minutes. No sooner had the English captain started the ball than Herriot, Weir and Lawrie, by neat passing sent it back, and after the backs and half backs had shown good play, the two M'Neills brought <b>it</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> left side, and passing it to Lawrie, the latter made a shot for goal, but the ball passed just outside the goal post. The play was now in the centre, the Queen’s Park men dribbling and passing, while their opponents indulged chiefly in heavy kicking. In 33 minutes from the commencement of operations H. M'Neill, obtaining possession, kicked the ball to Herriot, who unselfishly serving it to Lawrie, the latter again made a shot for goal, this time with more success, as the ball, passing above the goalkeeper’s head, went clean through thus obtaining the third goal.|$|E
