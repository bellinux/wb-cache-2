It all <b>feels</b> <b>very,</b> very surreal." [...] According to Peter Robinson of The Guardian, the cover has a [...] "plinky" [...] piano in its introduction. In regards to lyrics, Robinson interpreted, [...] "lines about 'uphill battles' and 'having to lose' do seem to talk of Joe's probable future." ...|$|E

They all get on and they're very good friends and have very {{different}} lives. When I met them {{some of them were}} still living with their parents! (Well, some of them.) They hang on {{to each other in the}} sense of that when they got huge across the world, there was already a sense of family between them." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with MistaJam, Tempah cites Dizzee Rascal and So Solid Crew as influences for the album, who've influenced him since his childhood. He also told Capital that Daft Punk influenced the album. Speaking about the album title Demonstration, Tinie {{said that it was}} about him compromising to make an album that was both true to where he came from and follows the trappings of mainstream hip hop: [...] "Anyone who wants to take inspiration from it can have a sort of example based on my experiences of how to do this. So basically, do something that still nods to where you've come from, still <b>feels</b> <b>very</b> London, still <b>feels</b> <b>very</b> British, but kind of meets the criteria of what a mainstream record needs." [...] He also commented oh how things change when signing with a record label and how the process of making albums: [...] "The first time around, you don't really know. All you do is you get this record deal and you're like whoa! Like, I'm signed! This is amazing! And you're just recording {{and before you know it}} the album's done. This time around, I had to think about so much more things, you know: edits, production things that I didn't like, going back and forth on mixing.... I was very hands-on this time." ...|$|E

500|$|In December 2009, Cyrus {{announced}} that she had begun planning her third studio album and intended to begin a musical hiatus after its completion. She expressed concerns that her newer material [...] "doesn't truly inspire me" [...] and worried that should would be [...] "blending in with everyone else", although she later commented that the final product was inspired by techno music qualities commonly used by recording artist Lady Gaga. Abby Konowitch from Cyrus' label Hollywood Records admitted that the record drew more inspiration from dance-pop music than she originally intended, but maintained that it [...] "feels very comfortable for her, and it <b>feels</b> <b>very</b> comfortable {{in terms of the}} state of contemporary music." ...|$|E
500|$|Originally, the game's protagonists Juno and Vela were {{designed}} as {{younger and more}} cartoon-like with large heads, but were ultimately changed to a more mature version at Nintendo's request. The game's controls {{were one of the}} main concerns during development. The idea was to retain a character-based game, where players could see the character they were playing, while keeping the tightness and accuracy of first-person shooters. Rare initially attempted to automate the change of view and targeting mode based on the context of the action, but this idea was eventually replaced with a manual system. According to Mountain, [...] "The solution we ended with is a beautiful thing. It <b>feels</b> <b>very</b> old-school to me; difficult, unforgiving, but ultimately precise." ...|$|E
500|$|Arctic Monkeys' first release without Nicholson, {{the single}} [...] "Leave Before the Lights Come On", came on 14 August 2006. Turner {{said that the}} song {{was one of the}} last songs he wrote before their rise to fame, and {{suggested}} that [...] "it <b>feels</b> <b>very</b> much like it could be on the album". Peaking at No.4 in the UK, the single became the band's first single not to reach No.1. The band was re-united at the Leeds Festival when Nicholson met up with his former bandmates and his replacement bassist, O'Malley. Only the original band members, minus Nicholson, were present at the award ceremony when Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not won the 2006 Mercury Prize two weeks later.|$|E

500|$|Waters {{was drawn}} to the Victorian era because of the (mis)understandings of what social norms existed during the period. As she stated, [...] "I find it a {{fascinating}} period because it <b>feels</b> <b>very</b> close to us, and yet in lots of ways it is utterly strange: many of the things we think we know about it are stereotypes, or simply wrong." [...] Considering herself part of gay and lesbian literary heritage, Waters was influenced by Oscar Wilde, and Chris Hunt, who wrote Street Lavender, an historical novel with gay male themes also set in the Victorian era. She has stated that Tipping the Velvet is a female version of Street Lavender, with a plot similar to My Secret Life by [...] "Walter".|$|E
500|$|Miyamoto {{introduced}} a playable demo {{at the next}} year's Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) on May 22–24, 2002. It debuted alongside another upcoming GameCube Zelda, eventually titled [...] Miyamoto's presentation experienced serious glitches while he attempted to demonstrate Link's new ability to use enemies' dropped weapons. Despite this setback, reception was more positive than the Space World demo. The game picked up the 2002 Game Critics Awards for Best Console Game at E3. IGN editor Fran Mirabella said the cartoon look [...] "works very nicely" [...] and that [...] "it <b>feels</b> <b>very</b> much like Zelda". The whimsical style was compared to [...] and promotional artwork from previous Zelda games. The E3 demo also introduced new features, {{such as the ability}} to connect to the Game Boy Advance and receive help from Tingle. However, divided response over the cel-shaded design followed the game through its release.|$|E
500|$|Critics also {{disagreed}} sharply regarding {{whether the}} game was a large step forward for the series. Parish said that less enemy variety was balanced by changes he considered the most experimental things Bungie had done for years. Edge and Bramwell praised {{the contrast between the}} Rookie's nighttime segments and the more fast-paced flashback vignettes. Edge added that while the narrative design was not groundbreaking, it served as a structure for exploring every possible weapon choice and strategy in the series. While Parish considered the ODST's abilities much {{different from those of the}} Chief, other critics such as Jackson wrote that the Halo feel was barely changed and that this was not detrimental. Brett Molina of USA Today felt that the game disappointed by not spending more time in the Rookie's open environment; [...] "instead," [...] Molina wrote, [...] "roughly two-thirds of ODSTs combat <b>feels</b> <b>very</b> much like a traditional Halo game" [...] instead of exploring new mechanics.|$|E

500|$|The action {{scenes were}} {{generally}} praised. RPGamer's Michael Beckett, while giving the film a 4 out of 5, lauded the film's fighting scenes, calling them [...] "mesmerizing" [...] {{and the primary}} focus of the movie. Anime News Network's Santos also heavily praised the action sequences, and Felperin of Variety felt they were the only point to the movie, which they felt focused entirely on the technical aspects of the action. The music received mixed reviews; Eriani of Mania Entertainment heavily praised it, as did Santos of Anime News Network, but 1UP.com's Mielke called it [...] "a bit sappy". Douglass Jr. from DVD Talk concluded that Advent Children [...] "is pretty much the film that fans all over the world have been waiting for", RPGamer's Beckett said that [...] "the film <b>feels</b> <b>very</b> much like a love letter to the fans of Final Fantasy VII", and IGN's Carle summed up the film as [...] "glorious, beautiful, well-executed fan service." ...|$|E
500|$|Bennet cut {{her hair}} for the season, {{in order to}} further her character's {{transformation}} to the Daisy Johnson / Quake of the comics, while not cutting her hair as short as her comic counterpart. Bennet stated, [...] "The comic book version of Daisy Johnson has very short, Miley Cyrus-esque hair. We wanted to stay true to the comic book character fans love; I wanted to please them but also make sure there was still some movement and length and sexiness in the hair." [...] Bennet also received a new costume for the season, along with Quake's signature gauntlets. On the costume, Foley said, [...] "It's about strength. She <b>feels</b> <b>very</b> empowered in it....I wanted to stay true to some of the designs I saw in the comics. In the style lines, I wanted to pay {{a little bit of a}} tribute to [...] tactical ability from last season, but we also incorporated the Quake symbol into her gauntlets and on the back of her suit." [...] Legacy Effects created the gauntlets and utility belt, [...] "out of flexible materials painted to look like metal" [...] so as not to injure anyone during stunts.|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to the news confirming the development of HeartGold and SoulSilver, fans posted their reactions and commentary on the Internet. In particular, IGN editor Jack DeVries reasoned that {{the primary reason for}} the updated games was to be compatible with Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, allowing players to collect old Pokémon species that were previously unobtainable in the new games. He also expressed skepticism that the new titles could match the quality of the originals; stating, [...] "For me, Gold/Silver were amazing because they introduced so many new features that have since become standards for the series. It was the first, and only, time the Pokémon games have made such a significant expansion. These days we're lucky if we get a new feature that invisibly changes the strategic elements of the game." [...] He reminisced over the qualities that made Gold and Silver truly unique, including the full color support, internal clock, Pokémon breeding, and PokéGear. Several months later, after DeVries had played through some of the game, he wrote, [...] "so far I like what I see, even if it all <b>feels</b> <b>very</b> familiar and formulaic at this point." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{cooperative}} puzzle solving aspect was highlighted as {{a valuable}} addition to the game. Welsh called the cooperative mode [...] "one of the most satisfying and genuinely collaborative gaming experiences you can have with a friend". Onyett wrote, [...] "Valve knows how a good co-operative mode requires a game design that doesn't simply encourage but requires you to work together. In Portal 2, communication is vital to success". Several reviewers praised the non-verbal cues that players could initiate to work with their partners. Portal 2 was praised {{for the amount of}} detail in its design, sound, and music. Nelson credited the [...] "sheer amount of detail" [...] put into the game's world, and wrote, [...] "it all <b>feels</b> <b>very</b> real and natural with brief moments where you're simply sucked into this world". Onyett was impressed with the amount of visual details and capabilities Valve achieved from their Source game engine and that the added details and animations of the levels [...] "consistently serv not only to entertain the eye but to expand our understanding of the game's characters". Hoggins wrote that the game's world reacted to the player-character Chell's presence [...] "in a startlingly organic way", and praised Valve's design as [...] "an achievement of world-building that compares favourably with BioShock underwater city of Rapture".|$|E
500|$|Other {{family members}} were also {{reportedly}} followed and harassed by government officials. Protestors converged outside the hospital where Feng was staying, carrying a banner that read [...] "severely beat the traitors and expel them." [...] Local media reported that the local government had organized the protest. [...] About a dozen guards patrolled outside Feng's hospital room for two weeks, following family members wherever they went. [...] "We feel like prisoners," [...] remarked Deng Jicai. [...] Supporters of the family allege that local officials were also engaged in an online smear campaign against the family. [...] "The whole family <b>feels</b> <b>very</b> depressed and pressured," [...] said Jicai. [...] On June 26, a visiting family member had their tires slashed. [...] A spokesperson for the Shaanxi provincial government called the allegations of harassment unfounded rumors. [...] However, Liang Zhongtang, an independent researcher, said it was common for people who seek outside help to be harassed by local governments. He speculated that the township government was trying to prevent further {{media coverage of the}} case. [...] On July 13, Jiyuan said that he remained concerned over his family's future safety, noting: [...] "There are rumors on the street that after this thing calms down, when people are not paying attention to us anymore, they [...] will kill my family." ...|$|E
500|$|Burton {{stated in}} an {{interview}} that he enjoyed the plot twist, and compared it to Jason Morgan being Monica Quartermaine's (Leslie Charleson) son on General Hospital. He said that he felt a connection while working with Scott, stating: [...] "There is vulnerability there between us, and it’s not on purpose. It’s just something that is there. It was actually kind of there before it happened that we were on-screen mother and son." [...] In a separate interview with Michael Logan of TV Guide, Scott stated: [...] "Nikki thinks she has come up with a good way of having everyone informed in the kindest way possible. If it were me, I would think, [...] "I can only go through this once. It's too emotional! Let's sit everybody down at the same time and get it over with." [...] Nikki had intended to reveal the news privately to Dylan but that opportunity never comes up." [...] Speaking of how the revelation would affect Nicholas, Scott added, [...] "She <b>feels</b> <b>very</b> badly about Nick losing Avery but not bad enough that she doesn't expect Nick to play nice and accept this man — not necessarily as a brother but still as a member of the family. She expects him to find a way to be civil. She wants everyone to be happy together." [...] Speculation also arose that Nikki's son could be Dylan's best friend Stitch Rayburn (Sean Carrigan), to which Scott teased, [...] "Maybe that's coming. Nikki had cult twins! You never know. I think Sean Carrigan could believably play my son. I think he looks a little like me, probably more like me than Steve Burton does." ...|$|E

500|$|Lynch as Sue {{received}} {{high praise}} for her acting. Canning wrote that she [...] "stole the episode" [...] and [...] "perfectly portrayed a woman [...] hard heart was trying terribly not to break, but {{not being able}} to stop it." [...] BuddyTV John Kubicek stated, [...] "it's impossible for me to say that Lynch wasn't exceptional, because her slow breakdown and attempt to cover-up her emotions was well done and fit perfectly with the character." [...] Respers France commented that [...] "we got to see the range and complexity of Sue Sylvester", and Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly said that Lynch did an [...] "outstanding job of delivering even the funniest quips with an underlying sense of sadness". Sue's characterization in the series was criticized by several reviewers, however. Amy Reiter of The Los Angeles Times stated that the [...] "consistent inconsistency of Sue's character is wearing thin", and that [...] "our sense of her fails to advance, wandering endlessly between pure evil and pure love for her sister." [...] Futterman called the episode a [...] "too-little-too late attempt at redemption for Sue's poor characterization this season." [...] VanDerWerff wrote that the episode [...] "feels very self-consciously like a way to just remove her character from the table for the season finale", that [...] "it <b>feels</b> <b>very</b> self-consciously like an attempt by the show to address the fact that the character doesn't make any sense", and criticized the death of Jean: [...] "killing her solely to right a wayward character arc is lazy writing, and no amount of actor commitment can wholly save it." [...] Fallon described the funeral plot line as [...] "pure, classic Glee: Egregiously random, emotionally manipulative, wholly unnecessary to plot development, and, in the end, deeply moving." ...|$|E
