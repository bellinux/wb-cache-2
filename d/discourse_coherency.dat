Firstly I consider sentences where quantificational determiners quantify-in to presuppositions. By considering texts containing such sentences, I show that intermediate accommodation cannot be triggered by presuppositions, contrary to the predictions of van der Sandt's recent model. However, a process I refer to as topical accommodation could justify the existence of the readings predicted by van der Sandt's model in some cases. I then show that similar problems occur in the treatment of presuppositions occurring in the consequents of conditionals, and once again conclude that current models err by not taking into account topic-focus articulation and issues of <b>discourse</b> <b>coherency...</b>|$|E
