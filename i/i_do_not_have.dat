500|$|This {{morning at}} 11 o'clock I have {{attacked}} the enemy.... All my troops have worked wonders, {{but at a}} cost of innumerable losses. Our men got into confusion. I assembled them three times. In the end I was in danger of getting captured and had to retreat. My coat is perforated by bullets, two horses of mine have been shot dead. My misfortune is that I am still living... Our defeat is very considerable: To me remains 3,000 men from an army of 48,000 men. At the moment in which I report all this, everyone is on the run; I am no more master of my troops. Thinking of the safety of anybody in Berlin is a good activity... It is a cruel failure that I will not survive. The consequences of the battle will be worse than the battle itself. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> any more resources, and—frankly confessed—I believe that everything is lost. I will not survive the doom of my fatherland. Farewell forever! ...|$|E
500|$|Under Georgia law, appeals {{of death}} penalty cases had {{to be based on}} errors of law, not a reevaluation of the {{evidence}} presented at trial. The appeals process began with a reconsideration by the original trial judge. The defense presented a written appeal alleging 115 procedural problems. These included claims of jury prejudice, intimidation of the jury by the crowds outside the courthouse, the admission of Conley's testimony concerning Frank's alleged sexual perversions and activities, and the return of a verdict based on an improper weighing of the evidence. Both sides called forth witnesses involving the charges of prejudice and intimidation; while the defense relied on non-involved witness testimony, the prosecution found support from the testimony of the jurors themselves. On October 31, 1913, Judge Roan denied the motion, adding, [...] "I have thought about this case more than any other I have ever tried. With all the thought I have put on this case, I am not thoroughly convinced that Frank is guilty or innocent. But <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> to be convinced. The jury was convinced. There is no room to doubt that." ...|$|E

A staff review from CDJournal discussed Utada's first greatest hits compilation Utada Hikaru Single Collection Vol. 1 and commended Utada's [...] "fine" [...] vocal delivery and composition." [...] Ian Martin from Allmusic also commended Jam and Lewis' collaboration, saying that [...] "providing {{stark contrast to the}} cheap, tinny sound that characterized much Japanese pop of the previous decade, with [...] "Wait & See" [...] and [...] "Addicted to You" [...] both featuring the production talents of Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis." [...] Miko Amaranthine from Yahoo! Music listed the song at number four on his Top Ten Hikaru Utada songs, stating [...] ""Addicted to you" [...] is one of my favorites for a slightly greedy purpose [...] When I listen to this song, I am reminded how much I love my marriage and am thankful <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> to play the [...] "dating game"."

2500|$|Despite Genie's grammar acquisition, {{her speech}} {{remained}} entirely devoid of pro-forms, modal verbs, modal particles, or auxiliary verbs. She memorized a few ritual phrases containing auxiliary structures but only used them in very specific ways, so linguists {{did not consider}} these grammar acquisition. In the spring of 1974 Curtiss thought Genie may have acquired use of the contractible auxiliary you, but wrote that she only used it in sentences that were mostly imitative. In January 1974 the scientists noted the first copulas in her spontaneous sentences, but she never used a contractible copula. By early 1975 Genie had started including do-support in some of her sentences, such as the utterance [...] "I {{do not have a}} red pail", but only in negative sentences with memorized phrases, almost exclusively the phrase <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have,</b> causing Curtiss to speculate that Genie had simply memorized the words [...] "I do" [...] as an independent phrase. Even then, Genie frequently omitted or incorrectly used it.|$|E

In the struggle with the evil that remains widespread and entrenched in the army, the tyranny of high-handedness, meanness, and hypocrisy, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> enough effective weapons, except the illusory belief that the truth, in and of itself, would win, and that justice would prevail.
