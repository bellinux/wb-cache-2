40|$|The rapid {{evolution}} of micorelectronics is placing greater {{demands on the}} packaging technology of integrated circuits (IC), the trend being towards higher lead counts, smaller lead width, finer lead pitch and thinner leadframes. These demands impose stringent requirements {{on the quality of}} dam-bar cutting, the latter being a mechanical trimming process in which the <b>dam</b> <b>bar</b> btween the leads of an IC package after post-molding process is pierced out. The leadframe thickness and the area of cutting are in the order of one tenth of a millimeter and cutting is performed at a much higher speed than that found in conventional blanking and piercing processes. In this work, a purposely built single-punch dam-bar cutting press was constructed. The effects of percentage punch-die clearance, punch shear and the plastic anisotropy of the leadframe materials on the cutting force and energy, {{and the quality of the}} sheared edge of the dam-bar, were studied. The optimum punch-die clearance for minimum cutting energy was established. The cutting force, energy and burr height were found to be affected by the plastic anisotropy of the virgin leadframe materials. These findings can be applied in the design of trimming tools used in the dam-bar cutting of IC packages. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of a river system for power and flood control produces sudden, enormous changes in the environment for anadromous fish: Great <b>dams</b> <b>bar</b> passage to the sea; huge lakes replace swift-flowing rivers; spawning gravels are inundated; water temperatures are modified; predator, competitor, and disease relationships are upset; food supplies are affected. The necessity for providing safe passage of fish over the physical obstruction of dams is an obvious reality. Of equal importance {{is the need to}} protect the fish where the changes made by dams in the basic environment are too severe. All of the factors that affect the survival of anadromous fish during migration must be considered if safe passage is to be provided. The need for information is particularly critical in four major areas; progress in research in these areas are outlined...|$|R
5000|$|The Nickajack Dam {{project was}} {{authorized}} January 9, 1964, and construction began April 1, 1964. Funding {{set aside for}} repair work on Hales Bar {{was transferred to the}} Nickajack project. The reservoir's construction - [...] which basically involved extending the Hales Bar Reservoir 6 mi downstream to Nickajack - [...] required the purchase of 8300 acre, 500 acre of which had to be cleared. 82 families and 8 mi of roads had to be relocated. Two generators and several switchyard parts were moved from Hales <b>Bar</b> <b>Dam</b> to the new dam. Construction was completed on December 14, 1967, at a cost of $73 million.

50|$|Haletown (also {{known as}} Guild) is an unincorporated {{community}} in Marion County, Tennessee, United States. It {{is probably best}} known as the former location of Hales <b>Bar</b> <b>Dam,</b> a major hydroelectric project of the former Tennessee Electric Power Company completed in 1913 which was later purchased by the Tennessee Valley Authority and operated by it until its replacement by Nickajack Dam, slightly downstream, in the 1960s, after which Hales <b>Bar</b> <b>Dam</b> was partially demolished; the remaining portion still exists near Haletown and is home to a marina.|$|R
50|$|The main {{geographic}} {{feature of}} Meigs County is the Tennessee River, which provides the county's western boundary. Watts <b>Bar</b> <b>Dam</b> is located {{along the river}} between Meigs and adjacent Rhea County, and forms Watts Bar Lake, which spans the river upstream to Fort Loudoun Dam just west of Knoxville. Watts <b>Bar</b> <b>Dam's</b> tailwaters are part of Chickamauga Lake, which stretches downstream to Chickamauga Dam in Chattanooga. The mouth of the Hiwassee River is located in southwestern Meigs County, near the point where Meigs, Rhea, and Hamilton counties meet.|$|R

50|$|The {{construction}} of Guntersville Dam and its reservoir required {{the purchase of}} 110145 acre of land, of which 24426 acre were forested {{and had to be}} cleared. 1,182 families, 14 cemeteries, and over 90 mi of roads had to be relocated. A large dike was built to protect the city of Guntersville from reservoir backwaters, and substantial dredging was necessary to extend the navigable 9 ft channel up to Hales <b>Bar</b> <b>Dam</b> (this dam has since been dismantled and replaced by Nickajack Dam, shortening Guntersville Lake). Widows <b>Bar</b> <b>Dam,</b> a small dam and lock approximately 58 mi upstream from Guntersville Dam, was partially dismantled and submerged under the lake waters.|$|R

5000|$|After gaining {{control of}} Hales <b>Bar</b> <b>Dam</b> in 1939, TVA carried out {{extensive}} repair {{work on the}} dam's foundation that by 1943 had succeeded in halting the dam's leakage. In 1949, TVA increased the dam's generating capacity and equipped the spillway with radial gates that helped extend the Hales Bar Reservoir's navigation channel {{all the way to}} the base of Chickamauga Dam. In the late 1950s, however, boils began to appear in the water below Hales <b>Bar</b> <b>Dam,</b> and an investigation showed the dam was again leaking, this time at an alarming [...] Dye tests carried out in 1960 suggested that many of the leakage channels had interconnected, increasing the possibility of a future dam failure.|$|R

5|$|Despite {{protests from}} TVA {{that it was}} unnecessary, the Manhattan District built a {{coal-fired}} power plant at K-25 with eight 25,000 KW generators. Steam generated from the K-25 power plant was subsequently used by S-50. Additional power lines were laid from the TVA hydroelectric plants at Norris <b>Dam</b> and Watts <b>Bar</b> <b>Dam,</b> and the Clinton Engineer Works was given its own electrical substations at K-25 and K-27. By 1945, power sources were capable of supplying Oak Ridge with up to 310,000 KW, of which 200,000 KW was earmarked for Y-12, 80,000 KW for K-25, 23,000 KW for the township, 6,000 KW for S-50 and 1,000 KW for X-10. Peak demand occurred in August 1945, when all the facilities were running. The peak load was 298,800 KW on 1 September.|$|R
50|$|In the 1960s, TVA began {{expanding}} {{the size of}} its dam locks to accommodate the increase in river traffic the Tennessee Valley had experienced since the end of World War II. A study in 1963 suggested that {{expanding the}} size of the Hales Bar lock would be extremely expensive, and considering the continued expenses involved with leak repair, TVA decided that would be more practical to replace the dam altogether. Nickajack Dam was authorized in January 1963 and construction was completed December 14, 1967. Operations were halted at Hales <b>Bar</b> <b>Dam</b> the following day, and by September 1968, Hales <b>Bar</b> <b>Dam</b> had been dismantled {{to the extent that it}} no longer threatened navigation on the new Nickajack Lake. Two of Hales Bar's generators and parts of Hales Bar's switchyard were installed at Nickajack.|$|R
