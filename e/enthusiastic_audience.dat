5|$|Pinafore {{opened on}} 25 May 1878 at the Opera Comique, before an <b>enthusiastic</b> <b>audience,</b> with Sullivan conducting. Soon, however, the piece {{suffered}} from weak ticket sales, generally ascribed to a heat wave {{that made the}} Opera Comique particularly uncomfortable. The historian Michael Ainger questions this explanation, at least in part, stating that the heat waves {{in the summer of}} 1878 were short and transient. By mid-August, Sullivan wrote to his mother that cooler weather had arrived, which was good for the show. In the meantime, the four partners of the Comedy Opera Company lost confidence in the opera's viability and posted closing notices. Carte publicised the piece by presenting a matinee concert performance on 6 July 1878 at the enormous Crystal Palace.|$|E
5|$|Just before junior prom, Jesse returns, having flunked out of UCLA, and Rachel invites him to {{the prom}} with her, Sam and Mercedes (Amber Riley). Jesse and Finn are {{kicked out of the}} prom when Finn picks a fight with Jesse over his attentions to Rachel on the dance floor, which {{effectively}} ends Finn and Quinn's campaign for prom king and queen. Finn ultimately breaks up with Quinn when he realizes he has a deeper connection with Rachel, {{despite the fact that she}} and Jesse seem to be a couple again. At Nationals, as the New Directions are about to go on stage, Finn begs Rachel to get back together with him, but though she professes her love, she refuses, still torn between her love for New York and Broadway and her love for him. At the end of their duet—"Pretending", written by Finn—an <b>enthusiastic</b> <b>audience</b> falls silent when Rachel and Finn share an overlong, unscripted kiss; the glee club comes in twelfth. Back in Ohio, Finn reminds Rachel that she has a year until graduation and any move to New York; he kisses her, and their relationship resumes.|$|E
5|$|Pre-{{production}} for U2 3D officially {{started in}} early 2004, {{and the production}} was handled by 3ality Digital, a company formed from Schklair's Colbalt Entertainment and his partnership with the Modells and the Shapiros. Midway through the year, Bono agreed to let the 3ality Digital crew record test footage, which was accomplished using a single 3D camera at one of U2's Vertigo Tour concerts in Anaheim, California in March 2005. U2 were dissatisfied with their 1988 rockumentary feature film, Rattle and Hum, which mixed backstage footage and interviews with concert performances. The filmmakers decided that U2 3D would only have concert footage. The producers originally wanted to shoot in Los Angeles where all the filming equipment was located, but Owens and the band decided they needed a more <b>enthusiastic</b> <b>audience.</b> U2 ultimately chose to film in five cities in Latin America from February to March 2006, believing their absence from the region for eight years would foster an energetic atmosphere. The {{only one of the}} eight Latin American shows that was not shot was the first in Monterrey, Mexico. The project enabled U2 to share the outdoor stadium concerts with audiences in the US, where the band only performed at indoor arenas on the Vertigo Tour.|$|E

The same episode was recorded twice {{on the same night}} in front of two different audiences. The taping with the better overall performance and more <b>enthusiastic</b> <b>audience</b> response was usually selected as the one to be aired.

25|$|Dean, who {{had been}} {{suffering}} with a severe bout of the flu for several days, attended a post-caucus rally for his volunteers at the Val-Air Ballroom in West Des Moines, Iowa and delivered his concession speech, aimed at cheering up those in attendance. Dean was shouting over the cheers of his <b>enthusiastic</b> <b>audience,</b> but the crowd noise was being filtered out by his unidirectional microphone, leaving only his full-throated exhortations audible to the television viewers. To those at home, he seemed to raise his voice out of sheer emotion.|$|E
25|$|American poetry, {{the poetry}} of the United States, arose first as efforts by colonists to add their voices to English poetry in the 17th century, well before the {{constitutional}} unification of the thirteen colonies (although before this unification, a strong oral tradition often likened to poetry existed among Native American societies). Unsurprisingly, most of the early colonists' work relied on contemporary British models of poetic form, diction, and theme. However, in the 19th century, a distinctive American idiom began to emerge. By the later part of that century, when Walt Whitman was winning an <b>enthusiastic</b> <b>audience</b> abroad, poets from the United States had begun {{to take their place}} {{at the forefront of the}} English-language avant-garde.|$|E

In 1926 Erb, Ivogün and their accompanist Michael Raucheisen were giving {{recitals}} in Bremen, and shortly before a Duetten-abend Erb tripped on the hotel steps and broke his right leg. Two painful months later in Berlin he resumed singing with Lieder-abends and a Matthew Passion. In 1927 he appeared in London, Covent Garden, as Belmonte, with Paul Bender as Osmin, and after this he sang in Berlin, in The Hague, in Halle, Düsseldorf and Mannheim, as Belmonte, Tamino, Loge, Bacchus, Ernesto and Florestan and in Der Corregidor.

The {{relationship between the}} two cities began when Pulitzer Prize-winning Italian composer Gian Carlo Menotti selected Charleston as the city to host the American version of Spoleto's annual Festival of Two Worlds. [...] "Looking for a city that would provide the charm of Spoleto, as well as its wealth of theaters, churches, and other performance spaces, they selected Charleston, South Carolina, as the ideal location. The historic city provided a perfect fit: intimate enough that the Festival would captivate the entire city, yet cosmopolitan enough to provide an <b>enthusiastic</b> <b>audience</b> and robust infrastructure." ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{reviewing}} the film for Monthly Film Bulletin, film historian Sir Christopher Frayling identified Django's attire, including [...] "his Sunday-best soldier’s trousers, worn-out boots and working man’s vest", {{as a major}} aspect of the film's success on the home market. According to Frayling, Django's appearance makes him appear [...] "less like an archetypal Western hero {{than one of the}} contadini (farmers) on his way back from the fields, with working tools on his back, dragging his belongings behind him, [...] direct [...] of contact with the Southern Italian audiences". Reactions to Nero's limited screenings of Django in Los Angeles, compared to the responses of Italian critics, were highly <b>enthusiastic.</b> <b>Audience</b> members, which included actors and filmmakers such as Paul Newman, Steve McQueen and Terence Young, were appreciative of the film's sense of humour and originality.|$|E

The band was quickly signed to a major-label deal. P.O.D. soon released The Warriors EP, a tribute EP to their loyal fans as a transitional album from Rescue Records to Atlantic Records.|$|E

2500|$|The state {{song was}} not {{composed}} until 21 years after statehood, when a musical troupe led by Joseph E. Howard stopped in Butte in September 1910.

Cohan, to help. The two men worked up a basic melody and lyrics in about a half-hour for the entertainment of party guests, then finished the song later that evening, with an arrangement worked up the following day. Upon arriving in Helena, Howard's troupe performed 12 encores of the new song to an <b>enthusiastic</b> <b>audience</b> and the governor proclaimed it the state song on the spot, though formal legislative recognition did not occur until 1945.
