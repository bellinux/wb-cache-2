To increase <b>elderly</b> <b>people’s</b> participation, a tool for documentation for implementation was made. In this study we ask ourselves: How does staff experience <b>elderly</b> <b>people’s</b> participation in nursing homes and which function does the documentation for implementation have on <b>elderly</b> <b>people’s</b> participation? On the basis of six interviews with staff in nursing homes the result shows that staff experience that <b>elderly</b> <b>people’s</b> participation is in progress and {{is very important in}} elderly care.

40|$|This {{research}} {{extends the}} study of social network analysis into the context of long-term care. Network density, reciprocity, and intensity were hypothesized to explain duration of the ties between frail elderly persons and their networks after they enter a residential care home (RCH), which {{is a type of}} long-term care facility. Using longitudinal data from interviews with 81 new, elderly RCH residents and 75 of their closest others, multiple regression analyses showed that the density of frail <b>elderly</b> <b>people's</b> networks has the strongest effect on tie duration. Secondary direct effects were also shown for reciprocity, mental status, being state-financed, White, and having returned home. The intensity of <b>elderly</b> <b>people's</b> ties does not explain tie duration. MAINTAINING <b>elderly</b> <b>people's</b> ties with their familyand friends after they enter long-term care facilities enhances their life satisfaction, morale, and sense of per-sonal control (Arling, Harkins, and Capitman, 1986; Greene and Monahan, 1982; Harel and Noelker, 1982), and hence adds to the quality of their life.

If ale succeeded in devouring the Sun, the world would end. To prevent that, men shot their guns toward the eclipse or rang bells, and women cast spells incessantly.

40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that social relationships confer mental health benefits. This paper aims to identify whether and how reciprocity in social relationships predicts or is associated with mental health benefits as well as with continuity in <b>elderly</b> <b>people’s</b> social relationships. The studies reviewed in this paper show that, among elders, being in a balanced or underbenefited reciprocal position predicts better mental health and life quality than being in an overbenefited position. Throughout the course of life, reciprocity evens out present and earlier reciprocal imbalances, securing continuity in close relationships—particularly between spouses and between elderly parents and adult children. In friendships, securing continuity seems {{to be based on the}} maintenance of independence based on balanced reciprocal relations, making these relationships more vulnerable. Due to the problems of conceptualization and measurement in the reviewed studies, one should be cautious in stating a final conclusion that the reciprocity norm has a universal positive effect on mental health and continuity in <b>elderly</b> <b>people’s</b> relationships...|$|R
5|$|These {{harmful effects}} {{may also be}} seen in non-smokers, as a recent {{meta-analysis}} including data from approximately 230,000 patients showed that β-carotene, vitamin A or vitamin E supplementation is associated with increased mortality but saw no significant effect from vitamin C. No health risk was seen when all the randomized controlled studies were examined together, but an increase in mortality was detected when only high-quality and low-bias risk trials were examined separately. As {{the majority of these}} low-bias trials dealt with either <b>elderly</b> <b>people,</b> or people with disease, these results may not apply to the general population. This meta-analysis was later repeated and extended by the same authors, with the new analysis published by the Cochrane Collaboration; this analysis confirmed the previous results. These two publications are consistent with some previous meta-analyzes that also suggested that Vitamin E supplementation increased mortality, and that antioxidant supplements increased the risk of colon cancer. Beta-carotene may also increase lung cancer. Overall, the large number of clinical trials carried out on antioxidant supplements suggest that either these products have no effect on health, or that they cause a small increase in mortality in elderly or vulnerable populations.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there was}} a {{consensus}} {{in the scientific community}} about how it was possible for the brain's neural circuitry to change through experience, the potential effect of web technologies on the brain's neural circuitry was unknown. On the topic of the Internet's effect on reading skills, Guinevere F. Eden, director of the Center for the Study of Learning at Georgetown University, remarked that the question was whether or not the Internet changed the brain {{in a way that was}} beneficial to an individual. Carr believed that the effect of the Internet on cognition was detrimental, weakening the ability to concentrate and contemplate. Olds cited the potential benefits of computer software that specifically targets learning disabilities, stating that among some neuroscientists {{there was a}} belief that neuroplasticity-based software was beneficial in improving receptive language disorders. Olds mentioned neuroscientist Michael Merzenich, who had formed several companies with his peers in which neuroplasticity-based computer programs had been developed to improve the cognitive functioning of kids, adults and the elderly. In 1996, Merzenich and his peers had started a company called Scientific Learning in which neuroplastic research had been used to develop a computer training program called Fast ForWord that offered seven brain exercises that improved language impairments and learning disabilities in children. Feedback on Fast ForWord showed that these brain exercises even had benefits for autistic children, an unexpected spillover effect that Merzenich has attempted to harness by developing a modification of Fast ForWord specifically designed for autism. At a subsequent company that Merzenich started called Posit Science, Fast ForWord-like brain exercises and other techniques were developed with the aim of sharpening the brains of <b>elderly</b> <b>people</b> by retaining the plasticity of their brains.|$|E

Contact is restored with Chuck Marshall and with the Russians in the form of Gurov (Brewster Mason).

Quatermass believes the force is a sphere of energy surrounding the Earth. The Russians and the Americans send a space shuttle, commanded by Marshall, to make contact with the force. Quatermass is sceptical; he believes they are dealing not with an intelligence but with a machine constructed to harvest human protein. The space shuttle is destroyed but not before Marshall reports a giant beam of light stretching in all directions. Meanwhile, the Planet People are gathering at Wembley Stadium in the tens of thousands. Annie and Quatermass travel to the stadium but are powerless to prevent the Planet People from gathering.
