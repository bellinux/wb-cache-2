In addition we have developed logical definitions for 46 % of all HPO classes using terms from ontologies for anatomy, cell types, function, embryology, pathology and other domains.

Here we describe the updated HPO database, which provides annotations of 7, 278 human hereditary syndromes listed in OMIM, Orphanet and <b>DECIPHER</b> <b>to</b> classes of the HPO. Various meta-attributes such as frequency, references and negations are associated with each annotation. Several large-scale projects worldwide utilize the HPO for describing phenotype information in their datasets. We have therefore generated equivalence mappings to other phenotype vocabularies such as LDDB, Orphanet, MedDRA, UMLS and phenoDB, allowing integration of existing datasets and interoperability with multiple biomedical resources.

40|$|One of {{the main}} goals of a {{cryptographic}} system is to provide authentication, which simply means providing assurance about the content and origin of communicated message. Historically, cryptography began with secret writing and this remained the main area of development until very recently. With the rapid progress in data communication, the need for providing message integrity and authenticity has escalated {{to the extent that}} currently authentication is seen as the more urgent goal of cryptographic systems. Traditionally, it was assumed that a secrecy system provides authentication by the virtue of the secret key being only known by the intended communicants; this would prevent an enemy from constructing a fraudulent message. It is a fairly recent realization that secrecy and authenticity are quite distinct goals. In classical or private cryptography these two concepts were closely intertwined. While secrecy depended on the message being unintelligible to any receiver who did not know the secret key, authenticity depended on the inability of anyone without knowledge of the secret key to produce a ciphertext that would <b>decipher</b> <b>to</b> an intelligible message. Simmons argued that the two goals of cryptography are independent. He shows that a system that provides perfect secrecy might not provide any protection against authentication threats. Similarly, a system can provide perfect authentication without concealing the message. This thesis will deal with authentication theory...|$|E
40|$|Fossil {{and living}} shells of {{terrestrial}} and freshwater molluscs collected from various {{sites in the}} Bonaerense and Patagonia regions of Argentina were analysed for their stable isotope content as a possible tool for palaeoclimatic and palaeoenvironmental reconstruction. The oxygen isotope composition of calcareous shell from fleshwater samples was interpreted {{in terms of a}} change in moisture condition and the related evaporative effect on surficial bodies of water, linked to a climatic shift. The carbon isotope composition mainly records changes in biological productivity. Interpretation of the isotopic composition of the land snail carbonate is more complex and worldwide data from living shells have been used to <b>decipher</b> <b>to</b> some extent the palaeoenvironmental record contained in their isotopic composition. Overall, the interpretations deduced from isotopic data of land snails as well as from nearby freshwater molluscs are quite comparable. The isotopic data suggest that arid conditions occurred between 35 and 15 ka B. P. and warmer conditions around 35 - 25 ka B. P. A shift toward a new phase comparable with the present meteorological and climatic situation probably began around 9 ka B. P. and it was linked to some short but severe climatic fluctuations, thus suggesting that high climatic stress characterised this period. Moreover, a trend toward slightly arid conditions is suggested by isotopic data, possibly sometimes after 5 ka. The differences arising from the geographical location and the short duration of each single series studied still hamper an extensive interpretation of the isotopic data...|$|E
