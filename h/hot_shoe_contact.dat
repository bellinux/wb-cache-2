50|$|The DSC-RX1 {{features}} a 35 mm f/2 Zeiss Sonnar lens with leaf shutter {{capable of a}} minimum shutter speed of 1/2000 s (for apertures 2.0 to 4.0), 1/3200 s (for apertures down to 5.6), and even 1/4000 s (for smaller apertures down to 22). The camera {{is equipped with a}} 24.3-megapixel full-frame CMOS sensor, and it includes a new Multi Interface Shoe that is physically compatible with the ISO 518 standard <b>hot</b> <b>shoe,</b> with electrical <b>contacts</b> for newer Sony shoe-mounted accessories as well as compatibility with the proprietary iISO flash shoe via the ADP-MAA adapter.|$|R
5000|$|The {{flash contact}} sits atop a small {{platform}} which resembles the Pentaprism found on an SLR. The camera {{is much larger}} than it needs to be, a lead weight was included to make it heavier, there is a plastic panel on top designed {{to look like an}} LCD readout and the two AA batteries serve no function except to power the [...] "light meter" [...] which merely indicates whether or not flash should be used. The [...] "use flash" [...] indicator is not coupled to the aperture lever and is thus valid only when f8 (cloudy/indoors) is selected and when ASA 100 film is used. Also, the <b>hot</b> <b>shoe</b> has three <b>contacts</b> (in addition to ground), but two simply sit on top of the plastic with no internal connection. The companion flash has only a single contact in addition to ground.|$|R

5000|$|... 1964: Kodak Retina Reflex IV (USA/West Germany): first SLR with {{standard}} ISO <b>hot</b> <b>shoe</b> atop the pentaprism housing for direct flash mounting and synchronization. Was a 35 mm, leaf shutter design. A flash {{is a necessary}} accessory for auxiliary or fill light in dim or high contrast conditions. The first camera {{with any kind of}} <b>hot</b> <b>shoe</b> connector was the Univex Mercury (USA) non-SLR half frame 35 mm in 1938 and many post World War 2 non-SLRs (such as the Bell & Howell Foton USA 35 mm rangefinder) had a Leica-type accessory shoe with added electrical contact (the present day ISO <b>hot</b> <b>shoe).</b> Although the Nikon F (see above) had a non-ISO <b>hot</b> <b>shoe</b> surrounding the film rewind crank in 1959, most 1960s 35 mm SLRs used screw-on accessory shoes attached to the eyepiece to mount flashes but a PC cable socket to sync them. The ISO <b>hot</b> <b>shoe</b> became a standard SLR feature in the early 1970s. However, in 1971, SLRs using [...] "dedicated" [...] electronic flashes with automatic flash exposure control began appearing with the Canon FTb (Japan). They used ISO-style shoes with extra electrical contacts. Each SLR brand used incompatible contact configurations and the time of use-any-flash-with-any-SLR passed by the late 1970s. Note, although the <b>hot</b> <b>shoe</b> had been de facto standardized in the 1950s, the International Organization for Standardization did not promulgate its ISO 518 <b>hot</b> <b>shoe</b> specification until 1977.|$|R
50|$|The camera will {{interpret}} {{the presence of}} a <b>hot</b> <b>shoe</b> protector as {{the presence of a}}n auxiliary flash attachment thereby disabling the built-in pop-up flash. Removing the <b>hot</b> <b>shoe</b> protector will re-enable the built-in flash. A micro-switch in the hot-shoe senses the presence of the flash.|$|R

5000|$|The flash {{connector}} {{was different}} from other 50s era stereo cameras; instead of the then-standard old style <b>hot</b> <b>shoe</b> (usually called an [...] "accessory clip") it featured a bayonet type connector, which was an emerging standard in the later 50s.
