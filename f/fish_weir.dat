5|$|Evidence {{has shown}} a number of fish traps exist around the island, which date from around the 7th century. The Anglo-Saxons {{established}} a large <b>fish</b> <b>weir</b> at Besom Fleet to the southwest of the island and built the church at West Mersea. It was damaged by Norse raiders in 894 and rebuilt afterwards. The west tower {{was added to the}} church around the 11th century, the south aisle in the 15th and various other rebuilds continued {{towards the end of the}} 18th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known {{record of}} {{improvements to the}} river is recorded in a document of 1325 from the Dean and Chapter of Wells Cathedral, where it was proposed to widen the river between Ham Mill and a new mill {{which was to be}} built at Knapp. The Dean and Chapter owned the river as far as Athelney weir, which was presumably a <b>fish</b> <b>weir,</b> as the river was an important source of fish for the local population. Records from 1494 record the intent to build a new mill at North Curry, which was operational in 1504, and caused flooding in 1505, resulting in the Bishop of Winchester having to complain to the Dean and Chapter of Wells. There is also mention of boats using the river at this time, as their use was restricted by the construction of the new mill at Ham.|$|E
25|$|Countess Wear, now {{a suburb}} of Exeter, {{takes its name from}} a <b>fish</b> <b>weir</b> on the River Exe about two miles below the city centre that Isabella de Forz is said to have built in the late 13th century. The details of the weir's {{construction}} are uncertain: a source of 1290 states that Isabella had it built in 1284 and thereby damaged the salmon fishing and prevented boats from reaching Exeter, but a later source of 1378 claims that she had had the weir built in 1272, leaving a thirty-foot gap in the centre through which boats could pass, until it was blocked between 1307 and 1327 by her cousin Hugh Courtenay.|$|E
40|$|Place, {{memory and}} {{identity}} among estuarine fishing communities: interpreting the archaeology of early medieval <b>fish</b> <b>weirs</b> Aidan O’Sullivan Recent coastal archaeological surveys in Britain and Ireland have produced {{an array of}} evidence for the construction and use of wooden and stone <b>fish</b> <b>weirs</b> throughout the Middle Ages. These <b>fish</b> <b>weirs,</b> with their wooden fences, basket traps and other features, vary in location, size, date and complexity. Regional and local traditions are discussed and {{it is suggested that}} <b>fish</b> <b>weirs</b> provide interesting insights into the labour and practices of medieval fishing communities, particularly in terms of cultural continuity and social identity...|$|R
50|$|The tides carry large {{quantities}} of fish, {{and the construction of}} <b>Fish</b> <b>weirs</b> on both banks and on several of the islands, helped make the Strait an important source of fish for many centuries.

25|$|Despite his {{reservations}} about the self-contradictory sources, Eyton concluded that the foundation date lay between 1130 and 1138 and that {{the founder of the}} abbey “in all respects was the first William Fitz-Alan.” However, William FitzAlan's grant of the Preston Boats <b>fish</b> <b>weir,</b> around 1135, was clearly not a foundation grant: there was already a small but growing community when it was made. The Victoria County History account tends to give more weight than Eyton to the possibility of an earlier origin. Augustinian communities often began as small gatherings around a noted hermit before growing into established monasteries, or even small religious orders: the Abbey of Arrouaise in northern France, which had a Shropshire community at nearby Lilleshall Abbey, is an example. At Haughmond, the remains of a very modest early church were discovered beneath the floor of the later, more ambitious building, during the 1907 excavations: this may date back to the time of Prior Fulk or earlier. Despite these reservations and qualifications, the most recent account of William Fitz-Alan, in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, simply treats him as the founder of the abbey, and it was certainly he who placed it on a secure basis, even if he was not the originator.|$|E
2500|$|Evidence {{of fishing}} along the Trent {{can be traced}} back to the Neolithic period, with the {{possible}} remnants of a <b>fish</b> <b>weir</b> discovered in the abandoned river channels at Hemington. More definitive finds from the medieval period were also found at this site and [...] near Colwick. These consisted of V shaped alignments of stakes; wattle panels and a large wicker trap and demonstrate that passive fishing techniques were in use on the river.|$|E
2500|$|Salmon {{was caught}} {{using a variety}} of methods, the most common being the fishing weir. These traps allowed skilled hunters to easily spear a good amount of fish with little effort.

[...] This translates into People of the <b>Fish</b> <b>Weir,</b> denoting the weir utilized in this area. This method of fishing required extensive cooperation between the men fishing and the women on the shore doing the cleaning.|$|E

50|$|<b>Fish</b> <b>weir</b> {{discovery}} {{continued in}} 1939, with archeological investigations led by Frederick Johnson during foundation excavation for the New England Mutual Life Building at 501 Boylston Street. Long sequences of wooden stakes, buried under tidal silt {{and an additional}} 15 to 20 ft of 19th-century Back Bay fill, were found passing through the site and continuing on under surrounding streets. Maps were drawn that described a <b>fish</b> <b>weir</b> covering more than 2 acre of the former marshland below Boston's Back Bay - suggesting the existence of one very large <b>fish</b> <b>weir</b> with over 65,000 wooden stakes. The imagined scale of this <b>fish</b> <b>weir</b> led scholars to speculate that it was built at one time by a community of appreciable size. This <b>fish</b> <b>weir</b> was described as the earliest known large-scale engineering effort in North America. Drawings and models were made {{based on the findings}} and show the <b>fish</b> <b>weir</b> built in deep water, maintained by men working from mishoons (log canoes). This interpretation may have been informed by the type of fish weirs known to be still in use in the 1940s by Native peoples in the Canadian Bay of Fundy.|$|E
