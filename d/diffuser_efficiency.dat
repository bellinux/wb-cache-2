40|$|Abstract—Due to adverse {{pressure}} gradient along the diverging walls of wide-angled diffusers, the attached flow separates from one wall and remains attached permanently {{to the other}} wall in a process called stalling. Stalled diffusers render the whole fluid flow system, {{in which they are}} part of, very inefficient. There is then an engineering need to try to understand the whole process of diffuser stall if any meaningful attempts to improve on <b>diffuser</b> <b>efficiency</b> are to be made. In this regard, this paper provides a data bank contribution for the mean flow-field in wide-angled diffusers where the complete velocity and static pressure fields, and pressure recovery data for diffusers in the fully stalled flow regime are experimentally measured. The measurements were carried out at Reynolds numbers between 1. 07 × 10 5 and 2. 14 × 10 5 based on inlet hydraulic diameter and centreline velocity for diffusers whose divergence angles were between 30 ◦ and 50 ◦. Variation of Reynolds number did not significantly affect the velocity and static pressure profiles. The wall static pressure recovery was found to be more sensitive to changes in the Reynolds number. By increasing the velocity from 10 m/s to 20 m/s, the wall static pressure recovery increased by 8. 31 %. However, as the divergence angle was increased, a similar increase in the Reynolds number resulted in a higher percentage increase in pressure recovery. Experimental results showed that regardless of the wall to which the flow was attached, both the velocity and pressure fields were replicated with discrepancies below 2 %.

40|$|Low {{solidity}} diffuser in {{centrifugal compressors}} can achieve both high efficiency and wide operating ranges {{which is of}} great importance for turbocharger compressor. Low solidity is achieved by using a low chord to pitch ratio. In this work, a CFD simulation is carried out to {{examine the effect of}} solidity on airflow field of a turbocharger centrifugal compressor which consists of a simple-splitter impeller and a vaned diffuser.

40|$|Centrifugal {{compressors}} {{are widely}} used for example in process industry, oil and gas industry, in small gas turbines and turbochargers. In order to achieve lower consumption of energy and operation costs {{the efficiency of the}} compressor needs to be improve. In the present work different pinches and low solidity vaned diffusers were utilized in order to improve the efficiency of a medium size centrifugal compressor. In this study, pinch means the decrement of the diffuser flow passage height. First different geometries were analyzed using computational fluid dynamics. The flow solver Finflo was used to solve the flow field. Finflo is a Navier-Stokes solver. The solver is capable to solve compressible, incompressible, steady and unsteady flow fields. Chien's k-e turbulence model was used. One of the numerically investigated pinched diffuser and one low solidity vaned diffuser were studied experimentally. The overall performance of the compressor and the static pressure distribution before and after the diffuser were measured. The flow entering and leaving the diffuser was measured using a three-hole Cobra-probe and Kiel-probes. The pinch and the low solidity vaned <b>diffuser</b> increased the <b>efficiency</b> of the compressor. Highest isentropic efficiency increment obtained was 3 % of the design isentropic efficiency of the original geometry. It was noticed in the numerical results that the pinch made to the hub and the shroud wall was most beneficial to the operation of the compressor. Also the pinch made to the hub was better than the pinchmade to the shroud. The pinch did not affect the operation range of the compressor, but the low solidity vaned diffuser slightly decreased the operation range. The unsteady phenomena in the vaneless diffuser were studied experimentally andnumerically. The unsteady static pressure was measured at the diffuser inlet and outlet, and time-accurate numerical simulation was conducted. The unsteady static pressure showed that most of the pressure variations lay at the passing frequency of every second blade. The pressure variations did not vanish in the diffuser and were visible at the diffuser outlet. However, the amplitude of the pressure variations decreased in the diffuser. The time-accurate calculations showed quite a good agreement with the measured data. Agreement was very good at the design operation point, even though the computational grid was not dense enough inthe volute and in the exit cone.

40|$|Centrifugal {{compressors}} {{are widely}} used for example in refrigeration processes, {{the oil and gas}} industry, superchargers, and waste water treatment. In this work, five different vaneless diffusers and six different vaned diffusers are investigated numerically. The vaneless diffusers vary only by their diffuser width, so that four of the geometries have pinch implemented to them. Pinch means a decrease in the diffuser width. Four of the vaned diffusers have the same vane turning angle and a different number of vanes, and two have different vane turning angles. The flow solver used to solve the flow fields is Finflo, which is a Navier-Stokes solver. All the cases are modeled with the Chien's k – έ- turbulence model, and selected cases are modeled also with the k – ώ-SST turbulence model. All five vaneless diffusers and three vaned diffusers are investigated also experimentally. For each construction, the compressor operating map is measured according to relevant standards. In addition to this, the flow fields before and after the diffuser are measured with static and total pressure, flow angle and total temperature measurements. When comparing the computational results to the measured results, it is evident that the k – ώ-SST turbulence model predicts the flow fields better. The simulation results indicate {{that it is possible to}} improve the efficiency with the pinch, and according to the numerical results, the two best geometries are the ones with most pinch at the shroud. These geometries have approximately 4 percentage points higher efficiency than the unpinched vaneless diffusers. The hub pinch does not seem to have any major benefits. In general, the pinches make the flow fields before and after the diffuser more uniform. The pinch also seems to improve the impeller efficiency. This is down to two reasons. The major reason is that the pinch decreases the size of slow flow and possible backflow region located near the shroud after the impeller. Secondly, the pinches decrease the flow velocity in the tip clearance, leading to a smaller tip leakage flow and therefore slightly better impeller efficiency. Also some of the vaned <b>diffusers</b> improve the <b>efficiency,</b> the increment being 1 [...] . 3 percentage points, when compared to the vaneless unpinched geometry. The measurement results confirm that the pinch is beneficial to the performance of the compressor. The flow fields are more uniform with the pinched cases, and the slow flow regions are smaller. The peak efficiency is approximately 2 percentage points and the design point efficiency approximately 4 percentage points higher with the pinched geometries than with the un- pinched geometry. According to the measurements, the two best geometries are the ones with the most pinch at the shroud, the case with the pinch only at the shroud being slightly better of the two. The vaned diffusers also have better efficiency than the vaneless unpinched geometries. However, the pinched cases have even better <b>efficiencies.</b> The vaned <b>diffusers</b> narrow the operating range considerably, whilst the pinch has no significant effect on the operating range...|$|R
40|$|Flow {{characteristics}} of low Reynolds number laminar flow through gradually expanding conical and planar diffusers were investigated. Such diffusers {{are used in}} valveless micropumps to effect flow rectification and thus lead to pumping action in one preferential direction. Four different types of diffuser flows are considered: fully developed and thin inlet boundary layer flows through conical and planar diffusers. The results from the numerical analysis have been quantified in terms of pressure loss coefficient. The variation of pressure loss coefficient with diffuser angle is presented for Reynolds numbers of 200, 500 and 1000. The pressure loss coefficients {{have been used to}} calculate the <b>diffuser</b> <b>efficiency</b> for two different types of nozzle-diffuser elements. The general trend of variation of pressure loss coefficient with diffuser angle was found to be similar to that for high Reynolds number turbulent flow. However, unlike at high Reynolds numbers, pressure loss coefficients at low Reynolds numbers vary significantly with Reynolds number. It was also observed that trends of variation in the pressure loss coefficient with Reynolds number are different for small and large diffuser angles. Also, at low Reynolds numbers, the pressure loss coefficients for a thin inlet boundary layer are not always smaller than those for fully developed inlet boundary layer, in contrast to the behavior for high Reynolds number flows. Contrary to past claims, flow rectification is shown to be indeed possible for laminar flows. The two different types of nozzle-diffuser elements considered led to pumping action in opposite directions. Further, it was observed that flow rectification properties of both kinds of nozzle-diffuser elements improved with increasing Reynolds number. © 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

Renewable tidal energy technology is undergoing a rapid development due to its advantages and new and creative designs of marine current turbines which are constantly being studied and improved. As a result, incorporating diffusers to accelerate the flow is a method used {{to increase the efficiency}} of the turbines.  However, this practice has to be evaluated and parameterised to ensure its viability.

The advantage of this strategy applied to a particular case is that the knowledge achieved can be used to benefit any diffuser design on many tidal turbines.  The diffuser that was used in the 2010 experiment exhibited a low increment in power extracted and the main objective of this thesis arises from the question of how it could be possible to extract much more power using such ducted turbine with the same rotor and diffuser because the interaction of device components and characteristics of water flow causes an impact on the flow field, and therefore in extraction of energy.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{two different}} configurations of horizontal axis Tidal Stream Turbines (TST) using a Blade Element Momentum Theory (BEMT) model. Initially, a 'conventional' 3 bladed and bare turbine is assessed, comparing predictions of turbine power and thrust forces against experimental measurements and existing literature. Excellent agreement is seen, increasing confidence {{in both the}} implementation of the theory into the code and the applicability of the method to represent the turbine physical behaviour. The focus of the paper lies on the analysis of a ducted and open centre turbine, where the BEMT model is adapted {{to take into account the}} increased mass flow through a duct (or augmenter). This is based on an analytical framework, where empirical expressions are devised based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) studies to approximate the inlet efficiency, <b>diffuser</b> <b>efficiency</b> and base pressure. This is applied to a bi-directional ducted case, where calibration of certain duct parameters is performed through modelling the OpenHydro device and comparing results with blade resolved CFD studies.

Both models align very closely for most Tip Speed Ratios, capturing the peak power at optimal conditions. Slight over predictions for thrust and power are seen at higher TSRs, where higher velocities are seen at localised elements around the hub. This is due to the model limitations in fully replicating the complex flow interactions in and around the hub and open centre.

40|$|The {{interactions}} of acoustic waves and thermoviscous fluids in closed cavities {{lead to some}} important physical phenomena such as, linear and nonlinear acoustic standing waves, and acoustic streaming which are very important {{in a wide range}} of engineering applications. The present dissertation is focused on the detailed investigation of standing wave dynamics in closed cavities. As a part of this research, novel numerical and experimental techniques are developed to analyze different phenomena caused by acoustic-fluid interaction. Using these techniques, the behavior of pressure, acoustic and streaming velocity fields inside the standing wave resonator, as well as the valveless acoustic pump and micropump are investigated. A new sixth-order accurate compact finite difference method for solving the Helmholtz equation with Neumann boundary conditions is developed. This scheme showed a better performance at higher wave numbers than the finite element method. A new fourth-order numerical scheme is also developed for solving highly nonlinear standing wave equations with no restriction on nonlinearity level and type of fluid. For highly nonlinear waves, the simulation results show the presence of a wavefront that travels along the resonator with very high pressure and velocity gradients. The slopes of the traveling velocity and pressure gradients, and the asymmetry in the pressure waveform are higher for CO 2 than those for air. The spatial and temporal variations of the nonlinear pressure and particle velocity fields inside a resonator are experimentally investigated at different frequencies and intensities. The effects of the excitation frequency and displacement on the streaming structure are also studied. It is found that, the classical streaming is not developed for Re s 1 50. Acoustic streaming patterns are also found to be significantly affected by transverse temperature gradient. A valveless acoustic standing wave pump is developed and the velocity fields inside this novel pump are analyzed.

Results of a computer simulation that models secondary choking in the converging part of the ejector and the effects of superheat conditions on the ejector performance are presented. In the present work further developed has been carried out to examine the optimum nozzle position when the ejectors operated at fully developed choked conditions. It has been confirmed that for the small ejectors the choking phenomenon {{plays an important role in}} ejector performance. It was also recognised that the nozzle position is a very important factor of the ejector geometry for small VJRS ejectors. In the secondary choking theory, ejector performance may be taken to be a function of the 2 ̆ 2 effective area 2 ̆ 2 available to the secondary fluid within the mixing chamber of the ejector. The present study involved experimental investigation of how this effective area is influenced by operating conditions such as evaporator temperature and nozzle position. In the present investigation the geometry of the converging part of the ejector has also been studied and the shock pressure recovery process examined in the constant area mixing tube. The present author has developed a CFD simulation of the ejector using the PHOENICS-BFC code based on the finite volumetric technique. Comparisons have been made between the predictions of the entrainment ratio using the one-dimensional, constant area analysis, CFD results and experimental results. In the present study analysis of two-fluid VJRS ejectors carried out based on the one-dimensional analysis, constant area method. It was found that using an appropriate fluid-pair, the entrainment ratio is likely to be substantially better than for the single fluid VJRS...|$|E
40|$|The ram jet is {{basically}} {{one of the}} most dimple types of aircraft engine. It consists only of an inlet diffuser, a combustion system, and an exit nozzle. A typical ram-jet configuration is shown in figure 128. The engine operates on the Brayton cycle, and ideal cycle efficiency depends only on the ratio of engine to ambient pressure. The increased, engine pressures are obtained by ram action alone, and for this reason the ram jet has zero thrust at zero speed. Therefore, ram-jet-powered aircraft must be boosted to flight speeds close to a Mach number of 1. 0 before appreciable thrust is generated by the engine. Since pressure increases are obtained by ram action alone, combustor-inlet pressures and temperatures are controlled by the flight speed, the ambient atmospheric condition, and by the efficiency of the inlet diffuser. These pressures and temperatures, as functions of flight speed and altitude, are shown in figure 129 for the NACA standard atmosphere and for practical values of <b>diffuser</b> <b>efficiency.</b> It can be seen that very wide ranges of combustor-inlet temperatures and pressures may be encountered over the ranges of flight velocity and altitude at which ram jets may be operated. Combustor-inlet temperatures from 500 degrees to 1500 degrees R and inlet pressures from 5 to 100 pounds per square inch absolute represent the approximate ranges of interest in current combustor development work. Since the ram jet has no moving parts in the combustor outlet, higher exhaust-gas temperatures than those used in current turbojets are permissible. Therefore, fuel-air ratios equivalent to maximum rates of air specific impulse or heat release can be used, and, for hydrocarbon fuels, this weight ratio is about 0. 070. Lower fuel-air ratios down to about 0. 015 may also be required to permit efficient cruise operation. This fuel-air-ratio range of 0. 015 to 0. 070 used in ram jets can be compared with the fuel-air ratios up to 0. 025 encountered in current turbojets. Ram-jet combustor-inlet velocities range from 150 to 400 feet per second. These high linear velocities combined with the relatively low pressure ratios obtainable in ram jets require that the pressure drop through the combustor be kept low to avoid excessive losses in cycle efficiency. It has been estimated that, for a long-range ram-jet engine, an increase in pressure loss of one dynamic head would require a compensating 1 -percent increase in combustion efficiency. Therefore, combustor pressure-loss coefficients (pressure drop/impact pressure) of the order of 1 to 4 are found in most current engines. The operating conditions described impose major problems in the design of stable and efficient ram-jet combustion systems. This chapter presents a survey of ram-jet combustor research and, where possible, points out criteria that may be useful in the design of ram-jet combustion systems...|$|E
40|$|Compressing {{equipment}} can {{be found}} in almost every area of our industrialized society. Compressors drive our fridges, air conditioning systems and enable turbine engines to propel the aircrafts we use when going for holidays or a business trip. Without compressors an operation of virtually any conventional power plant providing electricity to our houses would not be possible. The compressor technology can therefore be regarded as a mature area of engineering with a vast theoretical and operational experience. It may happen however that a traditional approach to certain new problems will not suffice, and alternative ways must be searched for. Such open-mindedness was required when the idea of introducing an oil-free compressor for a CO 2 commercial refrigeration system was born. Initially, hermetic radial turbomachinery was identified as a potential candidate for this task. However, it turned out that rather special properties of carbon dioxide, compared to other common refrigerants, will result in challenges uncommon in turbomachinery found in other applications. While the initial technology choice still seemed feasible, high density of the CO 2 at relevant operating conditions and significant rotational speeds required for a relatively small machine were indicating excessive levels of windage losses generated by the spinning rotor of the compressor. It was decided to build a 1 D tool for prediction of efficiencies {{for a wide range of}} machines based on a radial turbocompressor principle, but designed for CO 2 applications with different operating pressures and capacities. The predictions of the tool were compared against numerical and experimental data. Good match was found. The 1 D study revealed that high compression efficiencies, exceeding 70 %, are possible for the oil-free radial compressor concept in a relatively wide range of capacities provided that the inlet pressure is low, around 1 MPa, and that the pressure ratio is moderate, below 3. Potential for good efficiency is expected to deteriorate rapidly with increasing operational pressures due to windage losses. There is no obvious strategy for improvement of overall compressor efficiency when smaller capacities and close to supercritical pressures are in the focus. The major fraction of undesirable rotational losses is generated by the electrical motor. It can be reduced either by installing longer more slender motor or by reduction of rotational speeds. Efficiency improvement reached with application of a longer motor is shown to be of limited impact and is expected to be challenging from the rotordynamics point of view. Alternatively, multi-stage multi-shaft machine can be designed, but economic viability of such a strategy remains questionable. Reduction of the compressor speed is not straightforward either, especially at low volumetric flows when low speeds would be detrimental to the impeller and <b>diffuser</b> <b>efficiency.</b> A non-standard approach introducing partially admitted radial machine was therefore proposed. A numerical analysis of a partially admitted compressor stage with a 16 cm impeller rotating at 13000 rpm is carried out. Transient 2 D simulations indicate more than 80 % efficiency of the wheel at the total pressure ratio of around 1. 4. To estimate the final stage efficiency, 3 D effects such as the end-wall losses, the radial leakage, and the diffuser performance must be taken into account. A transient 3 D analysis of the complete stage of the novel compressor has not been completed due to its time consuming nature. 3 D simulations performed for various diffuser configurations indicate however that around 75 % overall stage efficiencies might be possible. It would require further optimization of both blade and diffuser shapes. Comparison of non-stage losses, for both centrifugal and partial admission concepts, allow presuming that the novel machine could be superior in terms of the overall performance provided that comparable systems are characterized by close to supercritical mean operating pressures and capacities typical for commercial scale applications. To verify the initial insights of the present work, further research, including laboratory testing, is needed. PhD i energi- og prosessteknikkPhD in Energy and Process Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|Many {{types of}} life {{threatening}} global health {{problems such as}} cardiovascular deceases, cancer, and diabetes have placed human life at high risk. These critical health problems may be eliminated and/or controlled with effective early diagnostic and/or targeted treatment methodologies. Conventional drug delivery methods such as oral tablets or injections consist of various limitations. Among them, the problem with variable absorption profiles and need of frequent dosing are yet to be successfully addressed. Therefore conventional methods are not effective for delivering the drug within their therapeutic range. The implementation of targeted micro drug delivery methods is recognised as a critical solution space for twenty first century healthcare. Micro Electromechanical Systems (MEMS) based typical micropump is a fundamental part of a drug delivery system which provides the actuation source to effectively transfer an accurate amount of fluid/drug to a targeted location. However, the lack of availability of accurate and easy to use, implantable and low-powered micropumps {{has been identified as}} a significant problem. Furthermore, the ease of control of implantable biological devices would be greatly improved by incorporation of wireless and secure actuator mechanism with no battery attached with the device. Therefore, in this thesis, several significant contributions to address the above highlighted issues are presented and discussed. In this thesis, various types of actuation and micropump mechanisms were reviewed; in addition to investigating how Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) devices can be used for secure, wireless and batteryless actuation. Consequently, SAW based novel transcutaneous interrogation mechanism was proposed for low–powered electrostatic actuations, without the need for active electronics to meet the biocompatibility requirements. A SAW correlator was used for the secure interrogation, where the device responds only to a uniquely coded RF signal, which has to be matched with the code implanted in the SAW correlator. The proposed micro actuation mechanism was demonstrated by utilising a Finite Element Model (FEM). This allowed the investigation of this device performance using a sophisticated computational numerical method. A new theoretical analysis was also developed to derive both electric potential and electrostatic force equations for SAW based microactuators. Then the Rayleigh-Ritz method based theoretical model was developed to validate the FEM results. Based on these results the SAW based low-powered actuator is able to achieve displacements up to 3 μm at low operating voltages. Once the proposed mechanism was verified both analytically and using FEM, the modelling was then extended to analyse the performance of SAW based microdiaphragms, as a critical performance dictator for the diaphragm part of the micropumps. Several new methods were developed and modelled to overcome the existing drawbacks in flat microdiaphragms, such as the incorporation of highly effective corrugated profiles, and effective use of flexible materials. As a result a number of these corrugation profiles were examined using FEA. As a result it is demonstrated that the proposed design approaches have substantially enhanced microdiaphragm performance, compared to a flat diaphragm. As much as the effectiveness of microdiaphragms, the flow rectification mechanism also dictates a critical role in micropumps. In this research, the proposed micropump was designed to be valveless for simplicity and ease of fabrication, and used diffuser elements for flow rectification. However, most of the existing computational analyses of diffusers are mainly based on 2 D or simplified 3 D models. Hence, the relationship between diffuser parameters, Reynolds number, and the diffuser performance at microscale, are not well established. Therefore, FEM based Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) was successfully utilised to analyse flat–walled diffuser elements. These analyses provide a qualitative and quantitative relationship between the <b>diffuser</b> <b>efficiency</b> and Reynolds numbers for laminar flow. Building on the developed actuation mechanism and various corrugated micro diaphragms, and diffuser models, an integrated device analysis are presented. This includes a full 3 D model of the SAW based electrostatically actuated, diffuser micropump, and complex microfluidic behaviour of the micropump was analysed. A strong emphasis was given in utilising CFD to analyse the Fluid–Solid Interaction (FSI) phenomena of the micropump and the overall pumping effect was successfully demonstrated. The knowledge and new contributions made in this thesis in modelling, simulation, and analysis of implantable drug delivery micropumps, will be able to effectively utilise in a range of fields such as advanced computational numerical modelling of Bio–MEMS, secure transcutaneous communication, and implantable drug delivery systems and other biomedical aplications.
