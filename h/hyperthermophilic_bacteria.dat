40|$|ABSTRACT: Based largely upon {{analysis}} of ribosomal RNA, a third domain of life, called archaea, had been proposed {{in addition to}} bacteria and eukaryotes. However, quantitative {{analysis of}} 73 whole genomes shows only a two-domain division of life: into eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Thousands of orthologous genes in archaea and bacteria show an essentially unimodal distribution of sequence identities. Thus, whole genome analyses indicate that archaea are a phylum of bacteria rather than a separate domain of life. In contrast, archaeal rRNA and that of <b>hyperthermophilic</b> <b>bacteria</b> differ from the rRNA of mesophilic bacteria. Thus, there is a bimodal distribution of rRNA sequence identities which differ by 12 %. This discrepancy in rRNA and gene content based analyses of whole genomes is likely due to a 15 % elevated C:G content of the rRNA of archaea and <b>hyperthermophilic</b> <b>bacteria.</b> The elevated C:G content is consistent with stabilization against thermal denaturation caused by additional hydrogen bonding (3 bonds) in C:G pairs compared to A:U pairs (2 bonds). Based upon this premise, there is no reliable way to correct rRNA for such differences in base composition {{and it is not}} possible to quantitatively compare hyperthermophiles with mesophiles by the rRNA method. Furthermore, quantitative study of whole genomes shows that the extent of change in both bacterial and archaeal genes, including rRNA, has reached a limit.

40|$|Background: Thermotoga maritima is a <b>hyperthermophilic</b> <b>bacterium</b> {{known to}} produce {{hydrogen}} {{from a large}} variety of substrates. The aim {{of the present study}} is to propose a mathematical model incorporating kinetics of growth, consumption of substrates, product formations, and inhibition by hydrogen in order to predict hydrogen production depending on defined culture conditions. Results: Our mathematical model, incorporating data concerning growth, substrates, and products, was developed to predict hydrogen production from batch fermentations of the <b>hyperthermophilic</b> <b>bacterium,</b> T. maritima. It includes the inhibition by hydrogen and the liquid-to-gas mass transfer of H- 2, CO 2, and H 2 S. Most kinetic parameters of the model were obtained from batch experiments without any fitting. The mathematical model is adequate for glucose, yeast extract, and thiosulfate concentrations ranging from 2. 5 to 20 mmol/L, 0. 2 - 0. 5 g/L, or 0. 01 - 0. 06 mmol/L, respectively, corresponding to one of these compounds being the growth-limiting factor of T. maritima. When glucose, yeast extract, and thiosulfate concentrations are all higher than these ranges, the model overestimates all the variables. In the window of the model validity, predictions of the model show that the combination of both variables (increase in limiting factor concentration and in inlet gas stream) leads up to a twofold increase of the maximum H- 2 -specific productivity with the lowest inhibition. Conclusions: A mathematical model predicting H- 2 production in T. maritima was successfully designed and confirmed in this study. However, it shows the limit of validity of such mathematical models. Their limit of applicability must take into account the range of validity in which the parameters were established...|$|R
