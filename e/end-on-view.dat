40|$|The {{excitation}} {{temperature and}} electron number density have been measured for <b>end-on-view</b> ICP discharge. In this work, <b>end-on-view</b> ICP-AES {{equipped with the}} newly developed “optical plasma interface (OPI) ” was used to eliminate or remove the negative effects caused by end-on-plasma source. The axial excitation temperature was measured using analyte (Fe I) emission line data obtained with <b>end-on-view</b> ICP-AES. The axial electron number density was calculated by Saha-Eggert ionization equilibrium theory. In the present study, the effects of forward power, nebulizer gas flow rate {{and the presence of}} Na on the excitation temperature and electron number density have been investigated. For sample introduction, two kinds of nebulizers (pneumatic and ultrasonic nebulizer) were utilized...|$|E
