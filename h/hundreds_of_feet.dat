5|$|Explosive andesitic {{volcanism}} {{dominated the}} area {{to the west of}} Zion during Oligocene and early Miocene time and probably inundated the region with <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>feet</b> of welded tuff that has since eroded away.

Debris flows carried boulders of this intrusion onto the Upper Kolob Plateau indicating that the Hurricane Cliffs could not have been present at the time.|$|E
5|$|In 2011 archaeologists from Italy, the United States, and Egypt {{excavating}} a dried-up lagoon {{known as}} Mersa Gawasis have unearthed traces {{of an ancient}} harbor that once launched early voyages like Hatshepsut's Punt expedition onto the open ocean.

5|$|Subsequent erosion lasting 300million years {{stripped}} much of {{the exposed}} sediments and the mountains away. This reduced the very high mountains to small hills a few tens to <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>feet</b> (tens of meters) high. Geologist John Wesley Powell called this major gap in the geologic record, which is also seen {{in other parts of}} the world, the Great Unconformity. Other sediments may have been added but, if they ever existed, were completely removed by erosion. Such gaps in the geologic record are called unconformities by geologists. The Great Unconformity is one of the best examples of an exposed nonconformity, which is a type of unconformity that has bedded rock units above igneous or metamorphic rocks.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with wind}} direction, cloud cover {{is one of}} the oldest {{atmospheric}} conditions to be coded on a station model. The circle in the middle of the station model represents cloud cover. In the United Kingdom, when the observation is taken from an automated weather observation site, the shape is a triangle. If the shape is completely filled in, it is overcast. If conditions are completely clear, the circle or triangle is empty. If conditions are partly cloudy, the circle or triangle is partially filled in. The cloud cover shape has different looks depending upon how many oktas (eighths of the sky) are covered by cloud. A sky half full of clouds would have a circle that was half white and half black. Below the shape indicating sky cover, the station model can indicate the coverage of low clouds, in oktas, and the ceiling height in <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>feet.</b> The ceiling height is the height at which more than half the sky is covered by clouds.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTemporal {{changes in}} {{rainfall}} erosivity {{can be expected}} to occur with changing climate, and because rainfall amounts are known to be in part of a function of elevation, erosivity {{can be expected to}} be influenced by elevation as well. This is particularly true in mountainous regions such as are found over much of the western United States. The objective {{of this study was to}} identify temporal and elevation trends in rainfall erosivity on a 149 km 2 (58 miles 2) watershed in a semi-arid region of southeastern Arizona. Data from 84 rain gages for the years 1960 – 2012 at elevations ranging from 1231 to 1644 m (4038 – 5394 ft) were used in the analyses. The average annual erosivity over the watershed as a whole was 1104 MJmmha− 1 h− 1 yr− 1 (65 <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>foot</b> ton inch acre− 1 h− 1 yr− 1), and ranged from approximately 950 to 1225 MJmmha− 1 h− 1 yr− 1 (56 – 72 <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>foot</b> ton inch acre− 1 h− 1 yr− 1), with a statistical trend showing greater erosivity at the higher elevations. No statistically significant temporal changes in annual or summer erosivities were found. This result stands in contrast to recent modeling studies of runoff and erosion in the area based on downscaled GCM information that project significant levels of erosivity changes over coming decades. These results are consistent with known orographic rainfall effects, but contrast with recent studies that presented projections of significant trends of increasing erosivity in the future based on downscaled GCM outputs for the area. The results illustrate the need for testing and developing improved techniques to evaluate future erosion scenarios for purposes of making targeted soil conservation decisions...|$|R
