5|$|Alexander swore {{the oath}} of loyalty to the Greek {{constitution}} {{on the afternoon of}} 11 June 1917 in the ballroom of the Royal Palace. Apart from the Archbishop of Athens, Theocletus I, who administered the oath, only King Constantine I, Crown Prince George and the king's prime minister, Alexandros Zaimis, attended. There were no festivities. The 23-year-old Alexander had a broken voice and tears in his <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> made the solemn declaration. He knew that the Entente and the Venizelists would hold real power and that neither his father nor his brother had renounced their claims to the throne. Constantine had informed his son that he should consider himself a regent, rather than a true monarch.|$|E
5|$|Yusef first appears when Afia {{introduces}} him to {{her boyfriend}} Tamwar Masood (Himesh Patel). Tamwar feels he {{is not good enough}} for Afia in Yusef's <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> is from a poor background, but Yusef says that does not matter and approves of Tamwar. After Tamwar mentions his mother Zainab Masood's name, Yusef visits the Masood home and finds the door open. When Zainab sees him, she screams and orders him out. It is revealed they were husband and wife from an arranged marriage when Yusef was 17, and Yusef's family had poured oil on her and set her on fire. Yusef says it was his family, not him, and he attempted to save her, revealing bad scarring on his body. Tamwar's father Masood Ahmed, Tamwar and Afia return home, and Masood attacks Yusef, punching him twice. After Yusef returns, Tamwar asks Masood to speak to Yusef, and when he visits, he finds out Tamwar and Afia are still seeing each other. He gives his blessing for them to be married.|$|E
25|$|Watching Shastri bat is like {{admiring the}} Qutub Minar; tall, timeless, solid. You admire {{it for the}} virtues, not for its style. For nine hours and 21 minutes, he chiselled away the England attack and the {{sculpture}} that he left behind represented perseverance and craft. There was the usual stoic, expressionless face under the helmet, but {{you could see the}} determination in his <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> planted himself at the wicket, struck root and bore fruit.|$|E

25|$|Edmund betrays Gloucester to Cornwall, Regan and Goneril. He reveals {{evidence}} {{that his father}} knows of an impending French invasion designed to reinstate Lear to the throne; and in fact a French army has landed in Britain. Once Edmund leaves with Goneril to warn Albany about the invasion, Gloucester is arrested, and Regan and Cornwall gouge out Gloucester's <b>eyes.</b> <b>As</b> <b>he</b> is doing so, a servant is overcome with rage by what he is witnessing and attacks Cornwall, mortally wounding him. Regan kills the servant, and tells Gloucester that Edmund betrayed him; then she turns him out to wander the heath too.|$|E
25|$|This version's major {{difference}} is Brainiac's role in Krypton's destruction. Brainiac {{is portrayed as}} the supercomputer that monitors Krypton and advises the planetary council on scientific matters. He senses the imminent destruction of the planet, but denies it so he can avoid the council's order to organize the planet's evacuation and instead focus on saving himself. Brainiac reasons {{that the loss of}} the planet itself and all its living inhabitants is part of the natural order, but his own survival would ensure the preservation of Krypton's history and achievements. Because he goes against Brainiac and the Kryptonian Council, Jor-El becomes an outlaw in their <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> works to save his son. After the destruction of Krypton and Kal-El's arrival on Earth, Brainiac eventually becomes an enemy of Superman.|$|E
25|$|Nicholas's life passes {{before his}} <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> falls. He smashes {{through a glass}} roof and lands on a giant air bag. Emergency medical {{technicians}} carefully remove him, and he finds himself in a ballroom full of his friends, family, and every figure involved in his Game; it had been just a game all along. Conrad is alive and well, and explains that he initiated the game to get his brother to embrace life and not to end up like their father. Nicholas bursts into tears, relaxes, and begins to enjoy the party once his shock has dissipated. When he sees that Christine has left the party, he follows her outside to her cab. He asks her to dinner, and she offers to share a coffee with him before her flight takes her to her next game assignment in Australia.|$|E

25|$|Kate and Sawyer {{travel to}} Hydra Island via Desmond's boat Elizabeth, {{to the site}} of the Ajira Airlines plane where Lapidus, Richard and Miles have been quickly trying to make it air-worthy. Kate convinces Claire she can help her raise Aaron and they head for the plane. After Kate, Sawyer and Claire board the plane, Lapidus {{successfully}} gets it off the island. Jack leads Hurley and Ben back to the heart of the Island, where Jack convinces an emotional Hurley to take over as the protector of the island, stating Hurley was always meant to be the leader. Hurley and Ben lower Jack to the dry pool where he rescues a barely conscious Desmond. Jack manages to restore the light by replacing the stone plug, and is enveloped in the light that surrounds him. Hurley, in his role as the new protector of the island, does not know what to do. Ben tells him he should help Desmond get home and suggests there may be a better way of protecting the island than how Jacob did. Hurley asks him for help, and Ben is honored. Jack reawakens outside by a river and walks toward the bamboo forest. After Jack collapses to the ground, Vincent approaches him and lies next to him. Jack gazes happily at the sky while watching the Ajira plane fly overhead away from the island. Jack slowly closes his <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> dies.|$|E
500|$|His father coached {{him until}} high school, and was {{especially}} tough. When Kinsler was 13 years old, {{and the best}} player on a PONY league team coached by his father that was playing for a championship, his dad caught Kinsler rolling his <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> gave the team orders. [...] "I benched him, without hesitation", said his father. With Kinsler on the bench, the team lost the game.|$|E
500|$|At {{approximately}} 12 {{midnight on}} 21 September 1986, Wood {{went to the}} playroom in the mansion and killed his mistress Danielle Ledez by shooting her once in the head. [...] Ledez was 10 weeks pregnant by Wood. [...] Wood then proceeded to play hide-and-seek with Ledez's daughter Stephanie (aged 3), after which he led her into Christopher's bedroom and shot her twice in the head, killing her instantly. He then took Ledez's son Christopher (aged 5) {{into the bathroom and}} told him to close his <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had a surprise for him, then shot him twice in the head. Wood then bludgeoned the boy with a large ruler four or five times {{in the back of the}} head.|$|E

6000|$|There was pity, {{blended with}} malignity, in Mr. Cymon’s <b>eye,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> replied, ‘Don’t matter, father! What would Captain Waters say, if he heard such vulgarity?’ ...|$|R
60|$|Lord Ormersfield {{had heard}} these few last words, {{and there was}} deep thought in his <b>eye</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> bade his cousins {{farewell}} at the hall door.|$|R
500|$|Everyone who was {{fortunate}} enough to be in the audience agreed that it was the musical event of their lives, and after the performance of the last number there was an ovation to the composer which I have never seen equalled anywhere, the entire audience rose to their feet and shouted with enthusiasm, and probably the calmest man in the whole hall was the composer himself; he bowed repeatedly with that distinction of manner which was so typical of him... As calm as Sibelius had appeared on the stage, after his part was over he came up stairs and sank into a chair in one of the dressing rooms and was very much overcome. Some people declared that he wept. Personally I do not think that he did, but there were tears in his <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> shook our hands and thanked us for what he was pleased to call the [...] "honor we had done him".|$|E
500|$|Ahalya's defence plea is {{also found}} in some of the Puranas. In the Brahma Purana, Ahalya is cursed to become a dried up stream, but pleads her innocence and {{produces}} servants, who were also deceived by Indra's disguise, as witnesses. Gautama reduces the curse on his [...] "faithful wife" [...] and she is redeemed when she joins the Gautami (Godavari) river as a stream. Indra is cursed to carry his shame {{in the form of a}} thousand vulvae on his body, but the vulvae turn into <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> bathes in the Gautami. The Brahma Purana is a rare exception where Rama is dropped from the narrative. Instead, the greatness of the Gautami river is illustrated. The Padma Purana tells that as Indra attempts to flee in the form of a cat, Gautama curses him to lose his genitals and to bear a thousand vulvae on his body. The beguiled Ahalya declares herself blameless, but Gautama considers her impure and curses her to be reduced to a mere skeleton of skin and bones. He decrees that she will regain her beautiful form when Rama laughs at seeing her so afflicted, dried out (a reminder of the dried stream motif), without a body (the Ramayana curse) and lying on the path (an attribute often used to describe a stone). When Rama comes, he proclaims her innocence and Indra's guilt, whereupon Ahalya returns to her heavenly abode and dwells with Gautama.|$|E

2500|$|According to Pissarro's son, Lucien, {{his father}} painted {{regularly}} with Cézanne beginning in 1872. He recalls that Cézanne walked {{a few miles}} to join Pissarro at various settings in Pontoise. While they shared ideas during their work, the younger Cézanne wanted to study the countryside through Pissarro's <b>eyes,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> admired Pissarro's landscapes from the 1860s. Cézanne, although only nine years younger than Pissarro, said that [...] "he was a father for me. A man to consult and {{a little like the}} good Lord." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to the {{memories}} of Svetlana Aliluyeva, Chiaureli approached her father with the idea to combine the fate of his son, Yakov Dzhugashvili, in the plot. Stalin promptly rejected this. Soviet actor Artyom Karapetian claimed Chiaureli's wife, actress Veriko Anjaparidze, told him Stalin was so outraged when he heard of this that Lavrentiy Beria – who was standing nearby – [...] reached into his trousers' pocket, [...] "presumably, for his gun." [...] The director's daughter, Sofiko Chiaureli, recounted that her father [...] "knew he was saved" [...] when Stalin wiped tears from his <b>eyes</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> watched Gelovani descend from the plane and muttered [...] "If only I had gone to Berlin." ...|$|E

60|$|To-night Mr. Ketchmaid, {{meeting his}} <b>eye</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> entered the bar, nodded curtly. The {{shoemaker}} had stayed away three {{days as a}} protest, and the landlord was naturally indignant at such contumacy.|$|R
