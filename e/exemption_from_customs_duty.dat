In discussions, Lord Mountbatten reinforced the statements of Patel and Menon by emphasising that the documents gave the princes all the [...] "practical independence" [...] they needed. Mountbatten, Patel and Menon also sought to give princes the impression that if they did not accept the terms put to them then, they might subsequently need to accede on substantially less favourable terms.

40|$|Sharp {{reductions}} in tariffs and quotas have propelled dramatic growth in global trade {{over the past}} several decades. Often overlooked, however, are the costs associated with trade logistics. In many countries logistics costs are greater deterrents to trade than remaining tariffs. Studies show that trade facilitation—i. e., the reduction of logistics costs—could increase annual global manufactured exports by as much as $ 400 billion. Hufbauer and Wong focus on two barriers that specifically hamper low-value shipments: (1) an unduly restrictive de minimis <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>customs</b> <b>duty</b> for low-value imports and (2) an unduly low "informal entry" threshold, the dividing line that determines whether the shipment requires just a little paperwork or a lot of paperwork to clear the entry process. The authors' estimates for the United States reveal that the payoff associated with raising thresholds and reducing "exceptions" could be significant. An increase in the de minimis threshold to $ 800 would generate net gains of around $ 17 million annually, taking into account the cost savings at each stage of the delivery chain and the revenue not collected by the customs authority. The saving of paperwork costs alone on de minimis entries might be $ 33 million a year. Raising the informal entry threshold to $ 2, 500, and slashing the number of "exceptions," could generate net gains of $ 81 million per year. For emerging-market economies, potential gains from higher de minimis and informal entry thresholds are very likely more substantial relative to the size of their economies. Improving logistics and raising thresholds for low-value shipments are powerful and relatively inexpensive means of enhancing the trading system. ...|$|E

The Empress decided to extend the <b>exemptions</b> <b>from</b> <b>customs</b> <b>duties</b> to the whole city, which attracted many people from different countries and all walks of life (Italians, Serbians, Slovenians, Croats, Jews and Greeks): for them a law was passed, the [...] "Editto di tolleranza", which provided for the freedom of worship, the possibility to negotiate freely and to own goods.|$|R

40|$|Sri Lanka 2 ̆ 7 s Termination of Employment of Workmen Act (TEWA) {{requires}} that firms with 15 or more employees justify layoffs and provide generous severance pay to displaced workers, with smaller firms being exempted. Although formally subject to TEWA, firms in Export Processing Zones (EPZs) {{may have been}} partially exempt from TEWA due to lax enforcement in that sector. A theoretical model shows that firms subject to TEWA will tend to mass at or below the threshold of 14 workers until they get an atypically large productivity shock that would propel them beyond the threshold. EPZ firms will be largely unaffected by the law. In addition, EPZ firms receive preferential tax treatment and <b>exemptions</b> <b>from</b> <b>customs</b> <b>duty.</b> Consequently, firms that anticipate rapid growth will {{have an incentive to}} locate in the EPZ sector. We test these predictions using 1995 - 2003 panel data on the universe of all private, formal sector firms in Sri Lanka. We find that at all sizes, EPZ firms are more likely to add employees than nonEPZ firms. Above the threshold, nonEPZ firms are more likely to shed workers while EPZ firms are more likely to add workers. Once passing the threshold, nonEPZ firms grow faster than nonEPZ firms below the threshold, consistent with a theoretical prediction that only atypically productive nonEPZ firms would cross the threshold. Finally, evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that TEWA restrictions retard the growth of nonEPZ firms below the threshold, but only some of the evidence passes tests of statistical significance. The combined impacts of retarded growth below the threshold, the need for a large productivity shock to cross the threshold, and slower employment growth above the threshold suggest that the TEWA failed to lower unemployment. Instead, it slowed employment growth of nonEPZ firms and induced other firms to seek the EPZ sector in order to evade the law...|$|R

(Dem. De Coron. p. 256.) In many instances a partial ateleia, or an <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>custom</b> <b>duties,</b> was granted {{for the purpose of}} encouraging commerce. (Theophr. Char. 23 Schol. ad Aristoph. Plut. 905, with Bockh's remarks, Publ. Earn. p. 87.) With regard to the inhabitants of a state, we must, {{as in the case of}} Athens, again distinguish between two classes, the resident aliens (metics) and real citizens. At Athens all resident aliens had to pay a tax (metoikion or xenikon telos) which we may term protection-tax, because it was the price for the protection they enjoyed at Athens; but as it was the interest of the state to increase commerce, and for that purpose to attract strangers to settle at Athens, many of them were exempted from this tax, i. e. enjoyed the ateleia metoikiou, (isoteleia equal rights) (Dem. c.Aristae): p. 691), and some were even exempted <b>from</b> <b>custom</b> <b>duties,</b> and the property tax or eisphora from which an Athenian citizen could never be exempted. The ateleia enjoyed by Athenian citizens was either a general immunity (ateleia apanton), such as was granted to persons who had done some great service to their country, and even to their descendants, as in the case of Harmodius and Aristogeiton; or it was a partial one exempting a person from all or certain liturgies, <b>from</b> certain <b>custom</b> <b>duties,</b> or <b>from</b> service in the army. The last of these immunities was legally enjoyed by all members of the [...] council of the Five Hundred (Lycurg. c. Leocr. 11), and the archons for the time being, by the farmers of the <b>custom</b> <b>duties</b> (Dem. c. Neaer. 1353), and by those who traded by sea, although with them the exemption must have been limited. (Schol. ad Arist. Plut. 905, Acham. 39i); Suid. s. v. emporos eimi) Most information respecting the ateleia is derived from Demosthenes' speech against Leptines. But compare also Wolf's Prolegom. ad Lept. p.
