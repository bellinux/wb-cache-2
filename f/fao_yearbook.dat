The <b>FAO</b> <b>Yearbook</b> of Forest Products is {{a compilation of}} statistical data on basic forest products for all countries and territories of the world. It contains series of annual data on the volume of production and the volume and value of trade in forest products. It includes tables showing direction of trade and average unit values of trade for certain products. Statistical information in the yearbook is based primarily on data provided to the FAO Forestry Department by the countries through questionnaires or official publications. In the absence of official data, FAO makes an estimate based on the best information available.|$|E

5000|$|The further {{mechanization}} {{of agriculture}} in the 20th century {{made possible by the}} agricultural machinery industry had a huge impact of the economic structure of society. In the developed countries the total labour force engaged in agriculture dropped from about 75% in 1800 to less than 5% late 20th century. In developing countries, in late 20th century still 75% of all land [...] "was farmed with only hand-tools and draught-animal technology." [...] In Turkey still 48% and in India 66.5% of the labor were working in agriculture, according to the <b>FAO</b> Production <b>Yearbook</b> 1990.|$|R
40|$|Output {{routines}} involving illustrations (“floating bodies ” in the LATEX lingo) are {{the most}} complex part of TEX. For most algorithms used in TEX, LATEX and ConTEXt the basic concept is a flow of text, oc-casionally interrupted by illustrations which can be placed anywhere close to the point they are men-tioned. The story is told mainly by the text, and illustrations have a secondary role. Here we discuss the different case of an illus-trated book, where the main story is told by the illus-trations and their interaction. The simplest examples of such books are art albums. Another (surprising) example is the <b>FAO</b> Statistical <b>Yearbook,</b> where {{the story is told}} primarily by maps, charts and tables, while the text has a secondary role. We describe a concept of a relatively simple output routine for such books and its implementation in LATEX. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{completed by}} Hayami and Ruttan in 1985 pioneered induced innovation research using available data to analyze relative endowments and accumulation {{of land and}} labor as critical elements in understanding patterns of agricultural change. Hayami and Ruttan’s analysis was based on 43 countries and 20 years, 1960 through 1980. My research extends their analysis to incorporate information from 129 more countries and a longer time frame of 50 years. The data on agricultural inputs and outputs are compiled from the Food and Agriculture Organization (<b>FAO)</b> and <b>FAO</b> <b>yearbooks.</b> I supplement the FAO data with wage information from the International Labour Organization wage series and Oostendorp’s (2012) harmonized wage series based on household datasets across many countries. The production process of the 172 countries is explained well by a Cobb-Douglas form. This is convenient because marginal and average products are proportional, which lend themselves to a graphical presentation of Neoclassical production theory. Following the original Cobb-Douglas (1928) strategy, I can illustrate: the tradeoffs between labor and capital in agricultural production in an empirical isoquant, how relative wages affect capital labor ratios across countries, and how labor demand responds to wages. In addition, two-dimension scatter plots of inputs including labor, land, draft animals, tractors, and fertilizer indicate whether these inputs are complements or substitutes in production. Finally, because I cannot reject constant returns to scale, the data lend themselves to estimation of scale and substitution effects using the fundamental law of derived demand. Since I am analyzing the data over an extended time frame, I can measure productivity gains in world agriculture over the last 50 years. I {{will be able to}} test if technical change conserves or uses more labor, land, or capital. I will also be able to test whether the pace of technical change in agriculture is influenced by the country’s trade protection policies. My findings on productivity growth will be compared to the results in recent papers by Ball, Schimmelpfennig, and Wang (2013), Gollin, Lagakos, and Waugh (2012), Herrendorf and Schoellman (2011), and Pardey, Alston, and Kang (2012) ...|$|R

40|$|The production, {{consumption}} and foreign trade of pesticides are important {{sectors of the}} chemical industry in particular, and of the national economy as a whole. The pesticides sector has {{a positive impact on}} increasing crop yields and a negative effect on the environment as a pollutant hazardous to plants, humans, etc. To analyze the place and role of pesticides in the national economy, we gathered a large amount of data from sources including national and international statistical <b>yearbooks</b> (UN, <b>FAO,</b> OECD, Eurostat, National Statistical Yearbooks and Foreign Trade Statistical Yearbooks). The following pesticides data were compiled, handled and keyboarded into a PC: pesticides production 1966 - 1988, including production by types of pesticides (according to available data); pesticides consumption; and foreign trade (exports and imports of pesticides in value and volume). The following data on territory, population and agricultural production were compiled, handled and used for suitable calculations and comparative analysis for the eight major producers and/or exporters of pesticides: Austria, Czechoslovakia, the FRG, the GDR, the Netherlands, Poland, the USA and the USSR (from 1966 - 1986) : total territory; arable territory; total population; agricultural population; total cereal production; rye production; potato production; vegetable production; fruit production; total cereal yield; wheat yield; rye yield; and potato yield. The validity of this information is determined by the data reliability taken from suitable sources. For instance, the population data in the <b>FAO</b> Production <b>Yearbook</b> were taken from the UN Demographic Yearbooks which give time series of estimates from national statistics. The data on pesticides production and consumption were compiled from National Statistics Yearbooks and National Foreign Trade Yearbooks which ensure their validity and reliability. Usually, pesticides volumes are very aggregated (in total or by large groups like herbicides, insecticides, fungicides and others), including the same components and, as a rule, are measured in identical units (thousand tons of active ingredients according to international classification), and are comparable for different countries. With the compiled data for the period 1966 - 1986, the following analytical calculations were made along with a comparative analysis of eight East and West countries: share of main pesticide producers in the World and Europe; pesticides production per hectare of total and arable land; pesticides production per capita (of total and agricultural population); pesticides production per unit of agricultural production for the main agricultural products mentioned above; structure of pesticides production for the period 1966 - 1986 in the main pesticide-producing countries; pesticides consumption per hectare of total and arable land; pesticides consumption per capita of total and agricultural population; and pesticides consumption per unit of agricultural production for the main agricultural products mentioned above. The following data on world foreign trade for over eighty countries over the period 1972 - 1986 were compiled, handled and keyboarded into a PC for analytical calculations: exports in value and volume; imports in value and volume; volumes of total exports by country; and volumes of total imports by country. Data on world pesticides foreign trade used for calculations and comparative analysis over the period 1972 - 1986 : share of pesticides exports in the total exports for each country; share of pesticides imports in total imports for each country; and dynamics of the pesticides export and import prices. The {{results of this study suggest}} the following future research directions: increase in the number of countries studied in a comparative analysis; analysis of more detailed information on pesticides production and consumption (differentiated by types of pesticides, territories, plants, environmental impact, etc.); more relevant information on pesticides application efficiency based on a correlated analysis of crop yields with pesticides application by types, plants, territories, etc.; and pesticides hazard assessment, requiring more differentiated information on pesticides application norms for different plants, areas for plants, toxicity of specific pesticides in use, soil and water conditions, accumulation in plants, etc...|$|R
