5|$|Trollope has {{described}} {{again and again}} the ravages of love... <b>His</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> always primarily a love-story, and a love-story constructed on an inveterate system. There is a young lady who has two lovers, or {{a young man who}} has two sweethearts; we are treated to the innumerable forms in which this predicament may present itself and the consequences, sometimes pathetic, sometimes grotesque, which spring from such false situations.|$|E

When a young man goes missing at a Boer farm and is feared enslaved, Nxumalo decides to investigate undercover.

5|$|The story {{switches}} {{again to}} Mamoru Takamura. <b>His</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> the most {{similar to the}} manga in {{that he is the}} only character in the series to have never lost a fight. It begins with Takamura as the Japanese Middleweight Champion, defending his title against the Class A Tournament winner. After winning, Takamura and the others go to a lodge in the mountains to train. While there he encounters a mountain bear that he knocks out.

5|$|Cox falsified {{documents}} {{to make it}} appear that he owned properties, and then fraudulently obtained several mortgages on them for five to six times their actual worth. He acquired millions of dollars this way; estimates report the amount at between US$5 and $25 million. Cox's first conviction occurred in 2002 when he was sentenced to probation for mortgage fraud. He was then fired from the mortgage broker position he held in a Tampa, Florida area firm. He began his life as a dedicated criminal in central Florida after that offense, before fleeing the area when his activities were discovered. His crime spree continued across the southern US, eventually landing him on the United States Secret Service's Most Wanted list. He was aided by several female accomplices, some of whom are in prison or have served time there for their participation in his fraudulent mortgage practices. Cox was arrested on November 16, 2006. Indicted on 42 counts, and facing prison sentences of up to 400 years, he plea bargained his sentence down to a maximum of 54 years on April 11, 2007 and was sentenced to 26 years on November 17, 2006. He is currently housed in a low-security prison in Florida. <b>His</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> well chronicled and has been featured on Dateline NBC, CNBC's American Greed, in Fortune magazine, Bloomberg Businessweek, Playboy magazine, and other media outlets.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Jack {{wants to}} spend time with his girlfriend, Elisa (Salma Hayek), but her job as a nurse does not allow it. While taking care of an elderly man named Mr. Templeton (George Bartenieff), who suffers from dementia, Jack persuades her {{to spend time with}} him, to which Elisa gives in to, and results in the two {{bringing}} Mr. Templeton along on their dates. One day, as they prepare to go out again, Jack and Elisa are shocked when Mr. Templeton's son, Michael (Scott Bryce), visits unexpectedly. The elderly man tells his son about the late night escapades, though Elisa tells the son that <b>his</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> not true. As Elisa distracts the son, Jack tries to leave the apartment, until Mr. Templeton sees him. Jack explains his situation with Elisa to Mr. Templeton, which he understands, and promises Jack he will not tell his son anything more of the late nights.|$|E
5|$|The story then {{shifts to}} one of Ippo's senpai, Masaru Aoki, who has been boxing {{for a number of}} years before Ippo. He enters the Class A Tournament, but loses. Afterward, he begins his {{comeback}} and rises through the Lightweight division to win the Lightweight Championship against Katsutaka Imae. Aoki's story differs from the manga in that Aoki lost several of the fights, and achieved a draw in the Title bout. After Aoki's story arc, the game shifts again to another of Ippo's senpai, Tatsuya Kimura, who began boxing with Aoki. <b>His</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> very similar to Aoki's in that he also enters the Class A Tournament and loses. Afterward, he begins his comeback that eventually leads to winning the Junior Lightweight Championship fight against Ryo Mashiba. Kimura's story is also different than the manga in that he lost several of the fights and did not become the Junior Lightweight Champion.|$|E

25|$|Chapters {{formed from}} Helen's diary {{strictly}} follow its style and differ from Gilbert's narrative. It {{should be noted}} that <b>his</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> also taken from his own diary. Such adherence to the diaries may be considered as a 'testimony of experience'. Since the Renaissance writing a diary had been a popular form of documenting and expressing personal opinions.|$|E
25|$|A {{native of}} San Antonio, Juan Seguín is {{probably}} the most famous Tejano {{to be involved in the}} War of Texas Independence. <b>His</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> complex because he joined the Anglo rebels and helped defeat the Mexican forces of Santa Anna. But later on, as Mayor of San Antonio, he and other Tejanos felt the hostile encroachments of the growing Anglo power against them. After receiving a series of death threats, Seguín relocated his family in Mexico, where he was coerced into military service and fought against the US in 1846–1848 Mexican–American War.|$|E

25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, though, it is {{most likely}} that the Homeric tradition contains elements of historical fact and elements of fiction interwoven. Homer describes a location, presumably in the Bronze Age, with a city. This city was near Mount Ida in northwest Turkey. Such a city did exist, at the mound of Hisarlık. Homer describes the location as very windy, which Hisarlık almost always is, and several other geographical features also match; so it appears, therefore, that Homer describes an actual place, although this fact does not in itself prove that <b>his</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> true.|$|E
25|$|The Lady Chapel {{not only}} {{contains}} the Saxon Cross {{but also an}} ancient broken marble slab engraved with a Bishop's pastoral staff and a Greek cross believed {{to have come from}} a reliquary containing the relics of St. Richard of Chichester, a 13th century bishop who often visited West Wittering. Part of <b>his</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> shown in the beautiful red, white and gold altar frontal presented by Yvonne Rusbridge in 1976. On the left St Richard is shown feeding the hungry in Cakeham and on the right leading his followers from the church, his candle miraculously alight despite the gust of wind which blew out all the other candles.|$|E
25|$|The {{short story}} “Chac Mool” by Mexican novelist Carlos Fuentes {{is found in}} his book Los días enmascarados, {{published}} in 1954. A man named Filiberto buys a chacmool for his art collection, and discovers that the stone is slowly becoming flesh. The idol eventually becomes fully human, dominating his life, causing flooding and other disasters. Filiberto dies by drowning. <b>His</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> found in a diary describing the terrors {{brought on by the}} idol, and his plans to escape. According to the author, this short story was inspired by news reports from 1952 when the lending of a representation of the Maya rain deity to a Mexican exhibition in Europe had coincided with wet weather there.|$|E

25|$|Geoffrey of Monmouth, in his History of the Kings of Britain, has Caesar invading Britain, and has Cassibelanus (i.e. Cassivellaunus) as Caesar's primary opponent, but {{otherwise}} {{differs from the}} historical record. As in the Historia Britonum, Caesar invades three times, not twice, landing at the Thames Estuary. <b>His</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> also largely based on Bede and the Historia Britonum, but is greatly expanded. Historical elements are modified – the stakes placed in the Thames by the Britons become anti-ship rather than anti-infantry and anti-cavalry devices – and other elements, such as Cassibelanus's brother Nennius engaging in hand-to-hand combat with Caesar and stealing his sword, called Crocea Mors, are not known from any earlier source. Adaptations such as Wace's Roman de Brut, Layamon's Brut and the Welsh Bruts largely follow Geoffrey's story.|$|E
25|$|Cyril {{was once}} again banished from Jerusalem by the Arian Emperor Valens in 367. St. Cyril was able to return again at the {{accession}} of Emperor Gratian in 378, after which he remained undisturbed {{until his death in}} 386. In 380, St. Gregory of Nyssa came to Jerusalem on the recommendation of a council held at Antioch in the preceding year. He found the faith in accord with the truth, but the city a prey to parties and corrupt in morals. Cyril's jurisdiction over Jerusalem was expressly confirmed by the First Council of Constantinople (381), at which he was present. At that council he voted for acceptance of the term homoousios, having been finally convinced that there was no better alternative. <b>His</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> perhaps best representative of those Eastern bishops (perhaps a majority), initially mistrustful of Nicaea, who came to accept the creed of that council, and the doctrine of the homoousion.|$|E
25|$|Tender Branson : The protagonist. By {{the end of}} the novel, he is {{the last}} {{surviving}} member of the Creedish Church/cult. At the beginning of the story, he works as a servant for a rich couple. He has been trained by the Creedish to be a menial laborer (i.e. a missionary of the Church), but he is bored with his existence and disillusioned with his faith. As the novel progresses, he becomes a religious celebrity and is credited for ideas and predictions that aren't really his. By {{the end of the}} story, he is wrongly believed to be a mass murderer. <b>His</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> recounted as an autobiography spoken into the black box of a plane he has hijacked and which is due to crash in just a few hours. Palahniuk has stated that he survives {{at the end of the}} novel by recording the last few minutes before the plane goes down and placing the recording beside the black box, all the while parachuting to safety, thus faking his own death.|$|E
