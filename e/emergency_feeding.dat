Across federal fiscal years (FFY) 1992 - 1996, the USDA paid out an annual average of $ 73. 2 million in feed subsidies. This research examined the market and welfare effects of livestock feed subsidies using welfare analysis in southeastern New Mexico. 1 Introduction The potential for input subsidies to increase production (and also encourage excess input use and damage the environment) is well known (Knutson et al. 1995). Unlike many other federal agricultural subsidies, livestock feed programs {{have not been}} the subject of previous economic research. In federal fiscal years (FFY) 1992 - 1996, the USDA paid an annual average of $ 73. 2 million in feed subsidies. The objective of this research was to examine the market and welfare effects of feed subsidies. This research addresses a politically sensitive research topic at a time when very little other analysis or information is available.

Pure broiler litter (i. e. excreta plus wood shavings), and litter mixed with 7. 5 or 15 % molasses were fed for 83 days to 2 -year-old wethers. The addition of molasses to the litter caused a significant increase (p &lt; 0. 01) in feed intake and final body mass. Various parameters such as plasma enzyme activity, plasma metabolite concentrations and urine mineral and purine excretion did not differ among treatments. Histological evaluation revealed no liver or kidney pathology. Mild myocardial pathology was observed in all 3 treatment groups. This seems {{to be related to the}} presence of the ionophore-based coccidiostat, narasin, which was present in the litter at a concentration of 10 mg/kg.

40|$|The {{decade of}} the fifties will long be {{associated}} with rapid technological progress in agriculture and a period of increasingly burdensome surpluses. In 1961, an <b>emergency</b> <b>feed</b> grain program was established to reduce production. The outcome was greatly increased output per acre, resulting in almost as much feed grain production as in 1960 {{in spite of a}} 17 percent reduction in acreage from 1960 to 1961. Most observers attributed the increase in yield per acre to land selection and application of more fertilizer per acre. These were important factors, but there is evidence that weather was even more important in the increase in yield of corn per acre from 1960 to 1961. A statistical study of the Corn Belt states showed that weather in 1961 was more favorable for corn production than any year during the period from 1935 to 1961. The difference in weather was enough to account for two thirds or more of the increase in corn yields in the Corn Belt states from 1960 to 1961. This information was published as Technical Bulletin 12 T by the Center for Agricultural and Economic Adjustment in 1962. [URL]...|$|R

30|$|To provide aid and {{facilities}} to pastoralists, permanent or semi-permanent places were constructed (such as schools, Public Distribution Stores - from where sugar, flour and other essential grocery items are provided at subsidised prices - health and veterinary care centres, warehouses for <b>emergency</b> <b>feed,</b> etc.). This has favoured a more sedentary {{way of life}} for the nomads. Three such sites have been developed in the Tso Kar basin (sites 1, 2 and 3 in Figure  2 c) along with one medical and one sheep husbandry facility for pastoralists and their livestock at site 1 (Hagalia 2004). The government provides a subsidy for permanent houses to the pastoralists near public distribution centres. Almost all nomadic pastoral groups in Changthang now have a fixed village space, generally a primary winter camp site with stone houses, where they store their belongings and return to periodically. In parts of Changthang, herders have started cultivating barley, which is increasingly becoming an important avocation for them and beginning to influence their choice of movement so that help is available for work in fields during critical periods such as ploughing and harvesting. The hay also provides important emergency fodder for winter. This pattern itself is interesting to observe as it had been formulated by herders so as to accommodate the refugees, not degrade the pastures, as well as keep emergency pastures in case of extreme winters or summer droughts. Nevertheless, how long the realigned pastures in the intensive study area can sustain the increasing grazing pressure is to be seen, and may require accurate monitoring of pasture quality and productivity.|$|R
