I come here green {{with only a}} desire to make our great country even greater. We have much work to do. In that spirit, I pledge to each of you that any disagreements we may have are just that and no more. Walking in each other's shoes takes effort and pause; however, it is my sincere hope that I never lose the patience to view each of you as human beings first, God's creatures, and foremost. I deeply appreciate this opportunity to serve with each of you. <b>I</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> look forward to getting to know you better.|$|E

500|$|In {{many respects}} (to Kennan's consternation) the {{priorities}} of the administration emphasized creating alliances against the Soviets more than negotiating differences with them. In his memoirs, Kennan recalled, [...] "So far as I could see, we were expecting {{to be able to}} gain our objectives... without making any concessions though, only 'if we were really all-powerful, and could hope to get away with it.' <b>I</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> doubted that this was the case." ...|$|E

500|$|Italian {{newspaper}} Corriere della Sera {{mentioned that}} Madonna would play in Italy {{as part of}} a world tour to promote Bedtime Stories in spring or fall 1995. However, Madonna and her manager Freddy DeMann cancelled all plans after she was offered the role of Eva Perón on the film Evita, directed by Alan Parker. Her spokesperson Liz Rosenberg considered a [...] "shorter tour" [...] because of filming, however, Madonna commented, [...] "I've waited years for this role, and I have to put every ounce of concentration into it. I love touring, and <b>I</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> want to go out with this album. But I can't—I'd be going straight from months on the road right into filming; I'd be exhausted and strained. It wouldn't be {{in the best interests of}} the movie for me to be at any less than my peak of energy".|$|E
500|$|Rose {{suggested}} that Murray's {{books on the}} witch-cult [...] "contain an incredible number of minor errors of fact or of calculation and several inconsistencies of reasoning". He accepted that her case [...] "could, perhaps, still be proved by somebody else, though <b>I</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> doubt it". Highlighting {{that there is a}} gap of about a thousand years between the Christianisation of Britain and the start of the witch trials there, he argues that there is no evidence for the existence of the witch-cult anywhere in the intervening period. He further criticises Murray for treating pre-Christian Britain as a socially and culturally monolithic entity, whereas in reality, it contained a diverse array of societies and religious beliefs. He also challenges Murray's claim that the majority of Britons in the Middle Ages remained pagan as [...] "a view grounded on ignorance alone".|$|E
500|$|Nimoy said Meyer {{gave the}} script [...] "the kind {{of humor and}} social comment, gadfly {{attitude}} <b>I</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> wanted". He added that his vision was for [...] "no dying, no fighting, no shooting, no photon torpedoes, no phaser blasts, no stereotypical bad guy. I wanted people to really {{have a great time}} watching this film [...] if somewhere in the mix we lobbed a couple of big ideas at them, well, then that would be even better." [...] One of Meyer's earlier films, Time After Time, was largely based in San Francisco; when he was told by the producers that The Voyage Home had to be set in the same city, he took the opportunity to comment upon cultural aspects not covered by his earlier film, such as punk rock—The Voyage Homes scene where Kirk and Spock meet an annoying punk rocker was based on a similar scene cut from Time After Time.|$|E

500|$|On 4 January 2010, Rosický {{signed a}} new {{contract}} with Arsenal, saying, [...] "It's felt like home since I arrived here {{four years ago and}} I believe we're on the verge of achieving something special together." [...] Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger commented on the new deal with Rosický, saying, [...] "I have spoken many times of Tomáš' class and contribution, not only on the pitch but off it as well, and <b>I</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> feel that this new contract reflects that." [...] Following his contract announcement, Rosický scored an injury time equaliser in a 2–2 draw at Emirates Stadium against Everton. His third goal of the season came against Bolton, Rosický scoring Arsenal's first goal {{at the end of the}} first half after Bolton had taken an early two-goal lead. Arsenal went on to score three goals in the second half, winning the match 4–2. On 10 February, Rosický provided a cross for teammate Abou Diaby, who resultantly scored the solitary goal of their league match against Liverpool. Rosický finished the season with a total of three goals in 33 appearances in all club competitions.|$|E

So that ability, <b>I</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> had that from the start and I used to enjoy that at school so actually to write a script—it suddenly felt like I was just making up a big story.|$|E
2500|$|While Denis O'Brien {{is often}} newsworthy, the Sunday Independent has paid {{particular}} attention to him when his business activities conflicted with Independent News Media. Denis O'Brien has perceived bias in the Independent Group's coverage and in a 2003 letter to Gavin O'Reilly wrote [...] "As far as I am concerned, Independent News and Media {{have spent the last}} seven years trying to destroy my reputation. Some of the coverage of my affairs, both business and personal, in the Sunday Tribune, Sunday Independent, Irish Independent and Evening Herald have caused hurt and enormous damage to my reputation, not to mention the emotional distress suffered by my wife, Catherine and my family. <b>I</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> doubt whether you or your family could have survived a similar onslaught." ...|$|E

2500|$|Josephine wrote {{much later}} that [...] "The {{fear and the}} excitement, the weeks of {{exhausting}} travel, chagrin over my own foolishness, all together proved too much for my strength. I developed St. Vitus Dance {{and was unable to}} attend school very much again. After a time however <b>I</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> improved in health so that within two years after my experience I was once more a normal healthy girl." [...] If Josephine, as she said, left San Francisco at age 18, it's unclear why she would still be attending school upon her return two years later. Like cerebral meningitis, St. Vitus Dance is a form of a streptococcus infection. The symptoms of St. Vitus Dance and meningitis are somewhat different, but both can be contracted from the same strain of bacteria through saliva. Both of Behan's children, Henrietta and Albert, were ill with meningitis around 1877, and in July of that year, Henrietta died from the disease.|$|E
2500|$|Lowell was a {{conscientious}} objector during World War II and served several {{months at the}} federal prison in Danbury, Connecticut. He explained his decision not to serve in World War II in a letter addressed to President Franklin Roosevelt on September 7, 1943, stating, [...] "Dear Mr President: <b>I</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> regret that I must refuse the opportunity you offer me in your communication of August 6, 1943 for service in the Armed Force." [...] He explained that after the bombing at Pearl Harbor, {{he was prepared to}} fight in the war until he read about the American terms of unconditional surrender that he feared would lead to the [...] "permanent destruction of Germany and Japan." [...] Before Lowell was transferred to the prison in Connecticut, he was held in a prison in New York City that he later wrote about in the poem [...] "Memories of West Street and Lepke" [...] from his book Life Studies.|$|E
2500|$|William Diaper (1685–1717) was an English poet of the Augustan era. Little {{is known}} about his life. He was born in Bridgwater, Somerset and {{attended}} Balliol College, Oxford as a pauper, where he took his BA in 1702. In 1709 he was ordained a deacon at Wells and became a curate in the parish of Brent, which he describes in disparaging terms in a poem of the same name, calling it [...] "nature's gaol". By 1712, he had made contacts in the London literary world and become a protégé of Jonathan Swift, who refers to the poet several times in his Journal to Stella. In March 1712, Swift writes:Here is a young fellow has writ some Sea Eclogues, poems of Mermen, resembling pastorals of shepherds, {{and they are very}} pretty, and the thought is new. Mermen are he-mermaids; Tritons, natives of the sea. Do you understand me? I think to recommend him to our Society to-morrow. His name is Diaper. P— on him, I must do something for him, and {{get him out of the}} way. I hate to have any new wits rise, but when they do rise I would encourage them; but they tread on our heels and thrust us off the stage.In December 1712, he continued his account of Diaper's progress:This morning I presented one Diaper, a poet, to Lord Bolingbroke, with a new poem, which is a very good one; and I am to give him a sum of money from my lord; and I have contrived to make a parson of him, for he is half one already, being in deacon’s orders, and serves a small cure in the country; but has a sword at his a—— here in town. ’Tis a poor little short wretch, but will do best in a gown, and we will make Lord Keeper give him a living.In another letter, Swift refers to Diaper's being ill:I was to see a poor poet, one Mr. Diaper, in a nasty garret, very sick. I gave him twenty guineas from Lord Bolingbroke, and disposed the other sixty to two other authors, and desired a friend to receive the hundred pounds for poor Harrison, and will carry it to him to-morrow morning. I sent to see how he did, and he is extremely ill; and <b>I</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> afflicted for him, for he is my own creature, and in a very honourable post, and very worthy of it. I dined in the City. I am in much concern for this poor lad. His mother and sister attend him, and he wants nothing.|$|E
