5|$|Book XI covers {{human beings}}, portents and transformations. Isidore derives human beings (homo) from the Latin for soil (humus), as in Genesis 2:7 {{it says that}} man is made from the soil. Urine (urina) gets its name either <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> can burn (urere) the skin or, Isidore hedges, that {{it is from the}} kidneys (renes). Femina, meaning woman, comes from femora/femina meaning thighs, as this part of the body shows she is not a man. The Latin for {{buttocks}} is clunis as they are near the large intestine or colon (colum).|$|E
5|$|In Taw Cheng Kong v. Public Prosecutor (1998), the High Court {{suggested}} on an obiter {{basis that}} voting {{is a privilege}} rather than a right. It has been suggested by law academic Thio Li-ann that, if called upon to decide the issue, the court might infer {{the existence of the}} right to vote in the Constitution from its text and structure, and <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is an adaptation of the Westminster system of democracy. If the right to vote were to be found to be implicit in the Constitution, the judiciary would be better able to protect the right when issues arise before the courts.|$|E
5|$|It also {{provides}} a powerful toolkit for studying strongly coupled quantum field theories. Much of {{the usefulness of the}} duality results <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is a strong-weak duality: when the fields of the quantum field theory are strongly interacting, the ones in the gravitational theory are weakly interacting and thus more mathematically tractable. This fact has been used to study many aspects of nuclear and condensed matter physics by translating problems in those subjects into more mathematically tractable problems in string theory.|$|E

5|$|The first {{scientific}} {{description of}} the night shark was published by Cuban zoologist Felipe Poey in 1868, {{as part of a}} series of papers entitled Repertorio fisico-natural de la isla de Cuba. He based his description on a single set of jaws and gave it the name Hypoprion signatus. In 1973, Leonard Compagno synonymized the genus Hypoprion with Carcharhinus. No type specimen has been designated for this species. Its common name comes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is mostly captured at night.|$|E
5|$|The various nicknames {{associated}} with prepatellar bursitis arise <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> commonly occurs among those individuals whose professions require frequent kneeling, such as carpenters, carpet layers, gardeners, housemaids, mechanics, miners, plumbers, and roofers. The exact incidence {{of the condition}} is not known; {{it is difficult to}} estimate because only severe septic cases require hospital admission, and mild non-septic cases generally go unreported. Prepatellar bursitis is more common among males than females. It affects all age groups, but {{is more likely to be}} septic when it occurs in children.|$|E
5|$|Project Gemini {{followed}} on from Project Mercury, {{taking its}} name <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> carried two men {{instead of just}} one. After the Mercury-Atlas 10 mission was cancelled, Shepard was designated as {{the commander of the}} first manned Gemini mission, with Thomas P. Stafford chosen as his pilot. In late 1963, Shepard began to experience episodes of extreme dizziness and nausea, accompanied by a loud, clanging noise in the left ear. He tried to keep it secret, fearing that he would lose his flight status, but was aware that if an episode occurred in the air or in space it could be fatal. Following an episode during a lecture in Houston, where he had recently moved from Virginia Beach, Virginia, Shepard was forced to confess his ailment to Slayton, who was now Director Flight Operations, and seek help from NASA's doctors.|$|E

5|$|The Plateau Mount Royal borough was {{a working}} class francophone area. The largest {{neighbourhood}} is the Plateau (not {{to be confused}} with the whole borough), which is undergoing considerable gentrification, and a 2001 study deemed it as Canada's most creative neighbourhood because artists comprise 8% of its labour force. The neighbourhood of Mile End in the northwestern part of the borough, has been a very multicultural area of the city, and features two of Montreal's well-known bagel establishments, St-Viateur Bagel and Fairmount Bagel. The McGill Ghetto is in the extreme southwestern portion of the borough, its name being derived <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is home to thousands of McGill University students and faculty members.|$|E
5|$|With the {{increase}} of tea's use in Chinese herbology, production methods changed, where the processed green tea leaves were not immediately dried after steaming. Rather the steamed tea leaves were first pulverized into a paste form, with the paste then formed in moulds and slowly dried into brick tea, a technique well described by Lu Yu in his work The Classic of Tea. Tender leaves and leaf buds were generally not used, as older mature tea leaves were preferred for tea production. Some tea bricks were also produced from mature whole leaves, which typically required {{the use of a}} cooked rice slurry (米湯) to bind the tea brick together. The preference of producing tea in brick form possibly stems <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> can be more easily transported and stored.|$|E
5|$|Barry Lyndon (1975) is an {{adaptation}} of William Makepeace Thackeray's The Luck of Barry Lyndon (also known as Barry Lyndon), a picaresque novel about the adventures of an 18th-century Irish rogue and social climber. John Calley of Warner Bros. agreed in 1972 to invest $2.5 million into the film, on condition that Kubrick approach major Hollywood stars, to ensure it of success. Like previous films, Kubrick and his art department conducted {{an enormous amount of}} research, and he went from knowing very little about the 18th century {{at the start of the}} production to becoming an expert on it. Extensive photographs were taken of locations and artwork in particular, and paintings were meticulously replicated from works of the great masters of the period in the film. The film was shot on location in Ardmore, County Waterford, Ireland, beginning in the autumn of 1973, at a cost of $11 million with a cast and crew of 170. The decision to shoot in Ireland stemmed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> still retained many buildings from the 18th century period which England lacked. The production was problematic from the start, plagued with heavy rain and political strife involving Northern Ireland at the time. After Kubrick received death threats from the IRA in the New Year of 1974 due to the shooting scenes with English soldiers, he fled Ireland with his family on a ferry from Dún Laoghaire under an assumed identity, and filming resumed in England.|$|E

5|$|The Andean condor is {{considered}} near {{threatened by the}} IUCN. It was first placed on the United States Endangered Species list in 1970, a status which is assigned to an animal that {{is in danger of}} extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range. Threats to its population include loss of habitat needed for foraging, secondary poisoning from animals killed by hunters and persecution. It is threatened mainly in the northern area of its range, and is extremely rare in Venezuela and Colombia, where it has undergone considerable declines in recent years. Because it is adapted to very low mortality and has correspondingly low reproductive rates, it is extremely vulnerable to human persecution, most of which stems <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is perceived as a threat by farmers due to alleged attacks on livestock. Education programs have been implemented by conservationists to dispel this misconception. Reintroduction programs using captive-bred Andean condors, which release birds hatched in North American zoos into the wild to bolster populations, have been introduced in Argentina, Venezuela, and Colombia. The first captive-bred Andean condors were released into the wild in 1989. When raising condors, human contact is minimal; chicks are fed with glove puppets which resemble adult Andean condors in order to prevent the chicks from imprinting on humans, which would endanger them upon release as they would not be wary of humans. The condors are kept in aviaries for three months prior to release, where they acclimatize to an environment similar to that which they will be released in. Released condors are tracked by satellite in order to observe their movements and to monitor whether they are still alive.|$|E
