40|$|In {{order to}} enhance their {{resistance}} to polar solvents and their film forming ability compared to these of neat polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), water soluble copolymers which combined rather large PVP sequences with ammonium groups were obtained. Free radical copolymerization of 1 -Vinyl- 2 -Pyrrolidone (NVP) with 3 -(dimethylamino) propyl-methacrylamide (DMA) and 3 -(methacrylamido) propyltrimethyl-ammonium, methylsulfate (TMA) was investigated in water at 68 °C using a water soluble initiator (4, 4 ′-azobis(4 -cyanovaleric acid ACVA)). The copolymer samples obtained at low conversion levels (< 10 %) could not be recovered quantitatively for these particular copolymers. Therefore, a numerical integration modeling, accounting for change in copolymer composition with conversion, was preferred to determine the optimal reactivity ratios from experimental data obtained at <b>moderate</b> <b>conversions.</b> The reactivity ratios (system TMA–NVP: rTMA 4. 47, rNVP 0. 038, system DMA–NVP: rDMA 5. 67, rNVP 0. 37) proved a strong preferential incorporation of the methacrylamide monomers. The reactivity ratios were then used to estimate the copolymer sequence distributions. It is shown that rather large NVP sequences can be obtained with low TMA or DMA initial contents at <b>moderate</b> <b>conversion.</b> Moreover, these copolymers easily formed films which withstood polar solvents and could be readily cross-linked by thermal curing, opening interesting prospects for membrane separation systems...|$|R

40|$|Southwestern Uganda {{has high}} malaria {{heterogeneity}} <b>despite</b> <b>moderate</b> vector control and other interventions. Moreover, the early biting transmission and increased resistance to insecticides might compromise strategies relying on vector control.

On 1 March 1945 the Wehrmacht possessed 145 Pak 97/38 and FK 231(f) guns, although only 14 were employed by frontline units.|$|R

30|$|Fructose based {{surfactants}} possess good {{interfacial tension}} values {{when compared with}} commercial sucrose esters [5]. Despite all importance related to this class of molecules, the synthesis of fructose esters is still a challenging task. Most of the chemical process used to the synthesis of these molecules uses mineral or heterogeneous solid acids, under mild conditions {{in order to preserve}} the sugar moiety, leading to <b>moderate</b> <b>conversions</b> and colored products; often a mixture of mono-, di-ester is produced, after long reaction times [6]. Lipase-catalyzed protocols have already been used to overcome the drawbacks of chemical synthesis of sugar esters with good conversions/selectivity and reaction time ranging from 24 to 72  hours [7 - 11].|$|R

30|$|Importantly, {{the scope}} of the {{reaction}} was also extended to the valorization of crude glycerol (GlyBio) from a biodiesel company [27]. The biocatalyst selectively converted crude glycerol into monoacetin with <b>moderate</b> <b>conversion</b> at low flow rate (0.5  mL.min- 1, 4.8  min of residence time) in the presence of ethyl acetate at 60 °C. Promisingly, the use of vinyl acetate promoted triacetin production (84 %) at low flow rate (0.5  mL.min- 1, 4.8  min of residence time), with only small quantities of diacetins observed under the investigated conditions. Diacetin production increased to 70 % and 60 % (1.5  mL.min- 1 and 3.0  mL.min- 1, respectively) at higher residence times (14.4 and 28.8  min for 1.5  mL.min- 1 and 3.0  mL.min- 1, respectively).|$|R
