40|$|ABSTRACT It {{has been}} {{research}} on light intensity sensors based on plastic optical fiber. The light <b>intensity</b> <b>sensor</b> {{is made with}} 3 configurations ie straight configuration, U configuration and gamma configuration that is placed perpendicular to the light source. The U-configuration sensor is made by varying {{the length of the}} jacket peel, the sheath peel and the variation in the bending diameter. Light source used is white high power LED and fluorescents lamp. Light sources that illuminate optical fibers will be cause some of the beam of light to enter into the optical fiber and increase the intensity of light that the fiber optic core originally was constant. The greater the intensity of the measured light source the higher the sensor output voltage. The best measurements were obtained on U-configuration sensors with 3 cm long sheath peel and 0. 5 cm diameter of bending, where the sensitivity value was 0. 0307 volts / klux and the resolution was 0. 0326 klux. Light <b>intensity</b> <b>sensor</b> is also applied as a proximity sensor. The more distance the sensor with the light source the smaller the sensor output voltage.

30|$|In silicon based {{solid-state}} sensor image acquisition, when a photo-diode receives too much radiant energy, {{the maximum number}} of electrons per pixel is reached [20]. This refers to saturation, and extra information is lost. In addition, the overloaded photo-site distributes charges into adjacent pixels, generating blooming (especially for CCD technology) [21, 22]. On the other hand, if a photo-diode does not receive sufficient photons, the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the electrical signal generated is too low compared to the global noise level [23]. Thus, when integration time is fixed, the sensor performance is optimal only within a given range of intensities according to its sensitivity. In a gray-level <b>intensity</b> <b>sensor,</b> pixels have a similar sensitivity and it is relatively easy to set an optimal integration time [24, 25].|$|E

The main advantage of fiber optic sensors lies in their dielectric construction, providing electrical isolation, immunity from electromagnetic fields, small dimensions, and compatibility with optical fibre technology. A large number of fiber sensors in production are based on intensity modulation of the light either outside the fiber or within it. In the case of <b>intensity</b> <b>sensors</b> the physical perturbation to be measured interacts with the fibre or some device attached to the fibre to modulate the intensity of the light as it travels through the fiber. <b>Intensity</b> modulated fiber <b>sensors</b> have been demonstrated to be efficient for different applications.
