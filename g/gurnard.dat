5|$|Bouillabaisse is a {{substantial}} dish from the French port of Marseille, capital of Provence. It is a stew for at least eight people, because it should contain many kinds of fish such as crayfish, <b>gurnard,</b> weever, John Dory, monkfish, conger eel, whiting, sea bass, and crab. These are cooked with Mediterranean vegetables and herbs, namely onions, garlic, tomatoes, thyme, fennel, parsley, bay, and orange peel.|$|E
5|$|Aberdaron hosts {{numerous}} sailing regattas featuring clinker built boats {{unique to}} the area; there is a popular regatta every August where the races are open to everyone. Sea angling trips are operated from Porth Meudwy, fishing for pollock, coley and mackerel; wrasse, bass, mullet and <b>gurnard</b> are also possible. Bass and coley can be caught from the rocks at Porth Iago; and wrasse, pollock and mackerel are plentiful. Access is difficult at Uwchmynydd, but pollock, mackerel, wrasse and conger are caught; huss are plentiful; and ling are found occasionally.|$|E
50|$|The flying <b>gurnards</b> are a family, Dactylopteridae, {{of marine}} fish notable for their greatly {{enlarged}} pectoral fins. As they cannot literally fly or glide {{in the air}} (like flying fish), an alternative name preferred by some authors is helmet <b>gurnards.</b> They are the only family in the suborder Dactylopteroidei.|$|R

5|$|<b>Gurnard</b> rose to periscope depth {{two hours}} later and found that a major effort to rescue troops and {{equipment}} from the torpedoed transports was under way. That night, the submarine torpedoed one of the crippled transports which was still afloat. Gurnards attack sank transports Aden Maru (5,825 tons) and Taijima Maru (6,995 tons) {{as well as the}} cargo ship Tenshinzan Marau (6,886 tons). While the rescue effort was relatively successful, 1,290 troops were killed and much of their equipment was lost.|$|E
25|$|The two <b>Gurnard</b> prototypes had {{different}} engines. The <b>Gurnard</b> II, {{the first to}} be completed, had a 525hp (392kW) Rolls-Royce Kestrel IIS supercharged water-cooled inline and the <b>Gurnard</b> I a 525hp Bristol Jupiter X supercharged radial engine. Accordingly, the <b>Gurnard</b> II had a smooth and pointed cowling, with a drum-shaped radiator between the undercarriage legs, whilst the radial engine had a narrow chord Townend ring, with the rear part of its cylinders visible from the side.|$|E
25|$|In New Zealand, snapper or <b>gurnard</b> was {{originally}} the preferred species for battered fillets in the North Island. As catches of this fish declined, it {{was replaced by}} hoki, shark (particularly rig) – marketed as lemon fish – and tarakihi. Bluefin <b>gurnard</b> and blue cod predominate in South Island fish and chips.|$|E

Shellfish include mussels, cockles, periwinkles, clams, and oysters.|$|E
25|$|Inimicus is not {{the only}} fish that {{demonstrate}} this type of ambulation; it has been extensively described in other related benthic Scorpaeniformes fish such as the Sea robin, Flying gurnards, and the Tub <b>Gurnard,</b> Chelidonichthys lucerna. This type of locomotion, based on voluntary and coordinated movements of paired pectoral fins, is believed by some to be a precursor to the later development of similar ambulation in terrestrial vertebrates.|$|E
25|$|The {{marine and}} estuarine {{areas in the}} Kaipara Harbour breed snapper, mullet, flounder, sole, kahawai, white trevally, <b>gurnard,</b> yellow‑eyed mullet and skates, rays and sharks.

25|$|The company designation, 2F.1, {{meant that}} the Nautilus was Blackburn's first two-seat fighter, though it was really {{intended}} as a carrier-based fleet spotter with interception capability. It was designed to Air Ministry Specification O.22/26. Though issued in June 1926, this specification did not reach a decision on the final engine to be used until October 1927; prototype contracts were only placed in January 1928, and the four chosen manufacturers did not produce prototypes for trial until 1929. These were the eventual winners, the navalised Hawker Hart first prototype later produced as the Hawker Osprey plus the Fairey Fleetwing, the Short <b>Gurnard</b> and the Blackburn Nautilus. All these were powered by the V-12 water-cooled Rolls-Royce F.XIIMS - later known as the Kestrel IIMS - which produced 525hp (391kW) and had a small cross-sectional area.|$|E
25|$|The duralumin-framed Short Sturgeon {{had never}} been {{expected}} to achieve production status, but the Air Ministry were sufficiently impressed with its behaviour on water and {{in the air to}} invite Shorts to tender for Air Ministry specification O.22/26, a two-seat fleet fighter. The specification sought a Fairey Flycatcher replacement, an aircraft that would spend much time in fleet spotter and reconnaissance roles, though without the third crew member the navy usually thought necessary for the latter task; but it also was to have the speed and rate of climb to catch bombers. It was required to be able to perform as a deck lander or a seaplane, and to be strong enough in either configuration to be launched by catapult. Shorts were advised that their duralumin monocoque fuselage was not suitable for below deck maintenance. Their tender was rewarded with an order for two prototypes of the S.10 <b>Gurnard.</b>|$|E
25|$|Yellow jack are predatory fish, moving both {{individually}} {{or in small}} groups, with their main prey being small fish, although observational records also show smaller benthic prey is taken. Yellow jack have been observed in a 'following role', moving around with larger species {{to take advantage of}} the commotion caused by the bigger fish, allowing the jack to opportunistically forage or take scraps left by the larger fish. As well as other teleosts, yellow jack have also been recorded following eels, stingrays and nurse sharks. In one case, they were observed following a flying <b>gurnard,</b> itself smaller than the jack, that disturbed the substrate, causing various organisms to be displaced and become available for predation. As well as being 'followers', larger specimens have also been observed as the 'followed' species. The species has also been observed living in close relationships with spinner dolphins, feeding off the dolphin's waste products. This behavior has also been observed in a number of other jacks living in the region.|$|E

500|$|The Take Ichi convoy {{suffered}} a devastating submarine attack on 6 May. On that day, [...] intercepted the Japanese {{ships in the}} Celebes Sea near the northeastern tip of Celebes. Gurnards captain—Commander Herb Andrews—submerged his boat and made a cautious approach to avoid detection by aircraft. He reached a firing position four hours later and fired six torpedoes at two transports. Only one of these torpedoes struck its mark, and a second salvo missed its intended targets but hit another transport. Andrews then turned his boat and fired further torpedoes from Gurnards stern torpedo tubes which hit a third transport. One of the Japanese destroyers counterattacked <b>Gurnard</b> and forced Andrews to break off his attack. The destroyer was traveling at too great a speed for its detection gear to function, however, and did not damage the submarine, despite dropping approximately 100 depth charges.|$|E
