Also, a different patient could become equally sick in <b>the</b> future. <b>Favoring</b> <b>the</b> youngest saves the most years of life, but a twenty-year-old has a more developed personality than an infant.|$|R

Caracalla made Palmyra a colonia between 213 and 216, replacing many Greek institutions with Roman constitutional ones. Severus Alexander, emperor from 222 to 235, visited Palmyra in 229.|$|E
5|$|A design {{competition}} {{was announced in}} July 1911, but there were not many contenders. The Naval Ministry <b>favored</b> <b>the</b> design from the Russud Works and gave preliminary orders for three ships on 2 September, even before the competition was concluded in November. Russud's design was unsurprisingly selected and the government transferred designers from the government-owned Baltic Works {{as well as a}} complete set of drawings for the Gangut-class to speed up the detailed design process.|$|E
5|$|A {{road from}} the town of Potrero to Tecate existed by 1917. The Tecate border {{crossing}} originally opened in 1932. In 1938, the San Diego County board of supervisors proposed moving rerouting the road to be shorter and on more level ground, although there was opposition from local residents and businesses who <b>favored</b> <b>the</b> old road. However, the route of the road to Tecate has remained the same since then.|$|E

5|$|Australia became {{directly}} involved when the Confederate navy visited {{in order to}} repair one of their warships. This led to protests from the Union representative at Melbourne, while the citizenry of nearby Williamstown entertained the Confederates and some Australians joined the crew. Accounts disagree as to whether Australians generally <b>favored</b> <b>the</b> Union or the Confederacy, as sorrowful demonstrations were held in Sydney when news arrived of Abraham Lincoln's assassination.|$|E
5|$|Born in Vermont in 1841, McMahon {{began his}} {{professional}} wrestling career in Port Henry, New York in June 1861. He won the match, which began an undefeated streak that lasted until 1878. Although he <b>favored</b> <b>the</b> collar-and-elbow wrestling practiced in Ireland, {{the country of}} his ancestry, he also competed in matches that involved catch wrestling and Greco-Roman wrestling. McMahon served in the Union army during the American Civil War, during which he gained notoriety as a wrestler.|$|E

50|$|The court {{looked at}} two approaches: an {{objective}} test ("what would a reasonable person do?") and a subjective ("what would this plaintiff have done?").

5|$|During the Eastern Han, peasants {{could avoid}} {{the month of}} annual conscripted labor by paying a tax in {{commutation}} (gengfu 更賦). This development went {{hand in hand with}} the increasing use of hired labor by the government. In a similar manner, because the Eastern-Han government <b>favored</b> <b>the</b> military recruitment of volunteers, the mandatory military draft for peasants aged twenty-three could be avoided by paying a tax in substitution.|$|E

5|$|In 1926, {{when the}} U.S. Highway system was first announced, {{there was a}} gap in US-50 between Ely and Thistle. At the time the states of Utah and Nevada were feuding about which of the old auto trails would be paved and used for the new U.S. Highway System. Nevada <b>favored</b> <b>the</b> Lincoln Highway, which the modern US-50 closely follows in that state. Utah refused to {{consider}} the Lincoln Highway west of Salt Lake City. Officials perceived that route would carry all California bound traffic directly to Nevada while passing through very few communities in Utah. Utah instead <b>favored</b> <b>the</b> Victory Highway (modern Interstate 80 west of Salt Lake) and the Arrowhead Trail (modern Interstate 15). By favoring these routes Utah could force travelers destined for southern California to use a different route than those destined for northern California, with both of these traversing through more cities in Utah than the Lincoln Highway. The Arrowhead trail was especially beneficial to Utah as it passed through many communities in the state, but only Las Vegas in Nevada.|$|E
