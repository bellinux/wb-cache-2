40|$|Purpose: The authors discuss deform {{mechanism}} of lateral extrusion process with a lost core for cross fittings. Outline of the is as follows: At first, cavity of pipe, or channel material, is filled up by liquid of low temperaturemelting material, for instances, {{low temperature melting}} alloy, ice (or water) and wax. Then low temperaturemelting material is solidified to be a soluble core of pipe. Authors call this soluble core the ‘lost core [1 - 4]. ’ Thethird, the material is compressed longitudinally as a composite billet, and extruded for lateral direction. Afterdeformation, low temperature melting material is melted and removed. The authors think the process is suitablefor production of cross-fittings because such the product has constant sections for lateral direction. Design/methodology/approach: The authors have examined the process with experiments [1] and numericalanalysis with ANSYS 9. 0. Findings: The feature of the process is revealed. Extrusion defect is caused {{at the center of}} the cross on the innerwall of the pipe because of volume constancy when the branch diameter close to the initial pipe diameter. Insuch the case, contact between pipe and die surface is unstable and the branch part is not stretched enough, thenit causes wrinkles. In such the case, it is better to provide more pressure against the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>branch</b> projection. Research limitations/implications: In future work, the effect of the relationship amongst mechanical propertiesof the pipe and lost core is to be examined. In addition, the authors will seek better material for the lost core thatis cheaper, easier to remove, clean and safer for the man and environment. Practical implications: Throughout the above research, authors conclude the suggested process is useful formaking cross fittings, and the process can be useful on the other hollow products. Originality/value: The above result helps design of the economical process for fittings. The process requiresonly simple equipments...|$|E
40|$|This {{project is}} {{developed}} to recommend {{the health insurance}} package that might suitable to the client regarding the client preferences by implementing Fuzzy Logic Technique. Allianz Insurance Berhad (AMB) is chosen as stakeholder for this project. Allianz provides several types of insurance which are General Insurance, Business Insurance and Life Insurance. There are three (3) different user for this system which are the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>branch</b> which has the role as admin in the system, the insurance agent and the potential client that might use the system to view which health insurance package recommended. Currently, the insurance agent are having a problem to recommend the best package to their customer due to every customer has their different preferences {{that will lead to}} different type of packages. Therefore, several objectives had been identified in order to minimize the problem. This insurance recommendation system helps the insurance agent and potential customer to check their suitable package by providing the benefit and the percentage of recommendation on the insurance package according to the client uncertainty client preferences such as age, monthly payment and other risks. Fuzzy expert system is implemented in this project because it is more suitable {{in order to determine the}} percentage of suitable insurance package based on customer preferences. By using this technique, it is easier to identify and explicit the knowledge to determine suitable insurance package that involved which imprecise and vague data. Sugeno-style inferences are used in the fuzzy expert system because it is well suited for mathematical analysis. As the fuzzy expert system prototype have been developed, the combination of health insurance processed data which is the benefits and package characteristic and rules would produce results based on user’s input which are the client preferences. The result of this project depends on the variety of inputs by the user to recommend the suitable insurance package and which is the most recommended. In the future, the system should be improve a lot more widen scope by add other types of insurance package such as properties, travel and transportation package. With the improvement, the system will have much more features that are not limited and can be used in wider perspective...|$|E

40|$|This study {{discusses}} the pronounced importance of corporate entrepreneurial behavior, CEB, facilitation and enablement {{as a key}} dimension in the rapidly changing business environment within companies. The research target is a large finance company in Finland, where regulations, compliance and processes restrict and refine extensively business approach. The {{purpose of this study}} is to foster the understanding of corporate entrepreneurial behavior and requirements and identify the supporters and inhibitors of facilitation of it. Furthermore, this study examines who should be driving the implementation and offer concrete outcome for the company to get the facilitation started and berth it as part of the organizational culture and values. The theoretical background is constructed from literature related to concept of corporate entrepreneurial behavior, factors supporting and hindering the facilitation based on previous studies and innovation management. Furthermore theoretical framework of middle managers entrepreneurial behavior in facilitation process was researched. Additionally top down and bottom up approach of conversational space building within the organization in order to foster innovation and involving mindset and behavior was in the core literature.

Behavior should be involved with organizational culture, values, structures and processes. The companies´ willingness to take risks and encourage employees at all levels to participate and be involved by taking ownership and responsibility is in the core. CEB is found to be a key dimension in increasing employee satisfaction and engagement, competitive advantages and economic growth of companies. There is increased interest towards CEB in the case company but there is lack in the mutual consensus of it. CEB is not in the strategy although the mindset and support from management is in place. There is no concrete enablement and space for innovation and CEB although the platform would be receptive.
