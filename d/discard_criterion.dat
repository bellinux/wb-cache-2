40|$|ABSTRACT: Normally, {{it is not}} {{recommended}} the conditioning of gladiolus stems in water during storage or transport. Hydration of petals may accelerate flower opening, even at a low temperature, which compromises quality at marketing moment. However, for this species, neither the effect of prolonged dry cold storage nor its behavior when transferred to water at room temperature has been evaluated. The present study aimed to evaluate the vase life and the rehydration capacity of gladiolus flowers (Gladiolus grandiflora Hort.) after dry storage at low temperature. Flower stems of cultivars Blue Frost, Gold Field, Traderhorn, and Jester were dry-stored at a temperature of 5 ± 1 ºC and relative humidity of 85 % for 12, 24, 36, and 48 h. Control stems remained always in deionized water. After storage, they were returned to the water at room temperature and evaluated for vase life (adopting the <b>discard</b> <b>criterion</b> when 50 % of the basal flowers displayed loss of color and wilting), fresh weight change (%), water uptake rate and transpiration rate, as well as relative water content of the petals (%). In dry cold storage conditions, for up to 36 h, the vase life was not affected although incomplete rehydration of the flowers.

The obvious consequences include high packet loss rate, huge amounts of wasted energy and obsolete data {{that may lead to}} inaccurate information. Since WSN suffers from scarce resources such as energy, data transmission which is the main cause of energy depletion should be kept to the very minimum. Various studies have used packet discarding as a means to reduce high traffic volumes. However, none of these methods have ever been applied in WSN which possesses different characteristics. This study proposes a new technique for mitigating congestion by selectively discarding some of the least important packets to give sufficient room for more important ones to get through. The proposed discarding policy is integrated with multiobjective optimisation (MOO) which can optimise several objectives at once. The proposed selective packet discarding policy discards the unimportant packets based on some <b>discarding</b> <b>criteria</b> which will be optimised by the MOO.

Clusters of overlapping bubbles are <b>discarded</b> using the <b>criteria</b> of a shape factor, thus leaving only solitary bubbles within an image. When the void fraction is low, the amount of discarded bubble data is very small compared with the obtained solitary bubble data.

40|$|In modern {{linguistics}} since American Structuralism onwards {{and especially}} in the contributions of generative morphologists, the notion of ‘head’ as “the most important constituent” has been the main target of the analysis devoted to compounds. Once <b>discarded</b> the <b>criterion</b> of the position of the head, inasmuch as it is a parameter depending on the single languages, several other criteria have been used for its identification as a constituent whose properties are transmitted to the whole compound, by means of the so-called “percolation” either a) of the grammatical category (cf. Lieber 1981) - e. g. the nominal category trasmitted from the head utpalam ‘Nymphaea’ to the compound nīlotpalam ‘blu Nymphaea’ or b) of the morphological features (cf. Booij 2007), such as the gender - e. g. nīlotpalam is a neuter noun because utpalam is neuter; or c) of the semantic type (cf. Allen 1978), i. e. of the kind of objects that the compound denotes - e. g. the nīlotpalam is an utpalam. Nevertheless, such classifications often imply a clearcut notion of ‘adjective’ and ‘noun’, which - as semantics studies (e. g. Kamp 1975; Dixon 1982) have parallelously shown - are categories far from granted and relying on a subordinate-principal opposition, whose shortcomings had already been pointed out by the first Pāṇini's commentators. Moreover, in some well-known occurrences of karmadhārayas such as rājarṣi and nīlalohita, or the supposed comparison-based compounds of the kind śastrīśyāma- and puruṣavyāghra-, it is compulsory to combine more than one test and to postulate some additional rule to arrive at a clear identification of the 'head'. Similar difficulties arise in the analysis of (‘headless’) bahuvrīhis. Analogously, the extension of the notion of head to the derivational suffixes raises several doubts about the classical parameters adopted for identifying the head of a syntactic structure. Among these (which are listed e. g. by Bauer 1990 : 2 f. - cf. Scalise-Vogel 2010 : 8), perhaps the most evidently misleading could be “the head is an obligatory constituent in the phrase”. In point of fact, if we consider for instance a taddhita-formation such as vāstraḥ in the sense of vastrena parivṛtaḥ rathaḥ “a chariot covered by a cloth” in accordance with Pāṇini’s rule A 4. 2. 10, undoubtedly the suffixal head is always an obligatory constituent but the most visible unit in the derivative word (i. e. the lexical material which is actually involved - cf. A 4. 1. 82) is not the head, but the nominal stem vastra- “cloth”, modified according to the specific affixation rule (vástra- + áṆ > vāstráḥ). In the proposed communication we will try to face some of the linguistic problems here mentioned, by interpreting them in the light of Pāṇini’s marked choice of concentrating on the ‘non-head’ constituent of these complex words - precisely on their upasarjana. Both in compounds and in secondary derivatives, indeed, the upasarjana loses its original independence of meaning but determines the meaning of another linguistic form to which it is subordinated. Thus even a upamāna-word such as śas̄trī- can be considered {{as a part of the}} list of the subordinate lexemes which can modify the sāmānyavacanas which are lexically headed by śyāma (A 2. 1. 55), or a upamita-word such as puruṣa- in the list of the 'kind of' vyāghras (A 2. 1. 56). This joint paper is crucially based on the problems tackled in Kātyāyana and Patañjali’s commentaries on A 2. 1. 55 - 56 (particularly about the co-reference of the two constituents of these compounds) in the attempt of putting them in closer relation with the other rules involving the upasarjana-category. The aim is that of spelling out the core features of Pāṇini's upasarjana-based account of morphological subordination, highligting the morphological, semantic and lexical implications of his choice...|$|R
40|$|This work (i) {{proposes a}} {{probabilistic}} treatment planning framework, termed coverage optimized planning (COP), based on dose coverage histogram (DCH) criteria; (ii) describes a concrete proof-of-concept implementation of COP within the PINNACLE treatment planning system; and (iii) {{for a set}} of 28 prostate anatomies, compares COP plans generated with this implementation to traditional PTV-based plans generated with planning criteria approximating those in the high dose arm of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0126 protocol. Let Dv denote the dose delivered to fractional volume v of a structure. In conventional intensity modulated radiation therapy planning, Dv has a unique value derived from the static (planned) dose distribution. In the presence of geometric uncertainties (e. g., setup errors) Dv assumes a range of values. The DCH is the complementary cumulative distribution function of Dv. DCHs are similar to dose volume histograms (DVHs). Whereas a DVH plots volume v versus dose D, a DCH plots coverage probability Q versus D. For a given patient, Q is the probability (i. e., percentage of geometric uncertainties) for which the realized value of Dv exceeds D. PTV-based treatment plans can be converted to COP plans by replacing DVH optimization criteria with corresponding DCH criteria. In this approach, PTVs and planning organ at risk volumes are <b>discarded,</b> and DCH <b>criteria</b> are instead applied directly to clinical target volumes (CTVs) or organs at risk (OARs). Plans are optimized using a similar strategy as for DVH criteria. The specific implementation is described. COP was found to produce better plans than standard PTV-based plans, in the following sense. While target OAR dose tradeoff curves were equivalent to those for PTV-based plans, COP plans were able to exploit slack in OAR doses, i. e., cases where OAR doses were below their optimization limits, to increase target coverage. Specifically, because COP plans were not constrained by a predefined PTV, they were able to provide wider dosimetric margins around the CTV, by pushing OAR doses up to, but not beyond, their optimization limits. COP plans demonstrated improved target coverage when averaged over all 28 prostate anatomies, indicating that the COP approach can provide benefits for many patients. However, the degree to which slack OAR doses can be exploited to increase target coverage will vary according to the individual patient anatomy. The proof-of-concept COP implementation investigated here utilized a probabilistic DCH criteria only for the CTV minimum dose criterion. All other optimization criteria were conventional DVH criteria. In a mature COP implementation, all optimization criteria will be DCH criteria, enabling direct planning control over probabilistic dose distributions. Further research is necessary to determine the benefits of COP planning, in terms of tumor control probability and∕or normal tissue complication probabilities...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with an investigation of some factors influencing the use of coarse colliery discards as a fill material for reinforced earth construction. The work carried out {{in this study is}} primarily a laboratory study, investigating the properties of the fill materials, reinforcements and the soil-reinforcement interaction coefficients. Test were carried out on Cardown colliery discards to establish the geotecnical properties and to establish weather the <b>discards</b> satisfied the <b>criteria</b> set out by BE 3 / 78 (revised) and the DTp specification for Highway works(1986). Instruments ranging fro free field strain coils were used to measure strains in the soils. All methods utilised are reported. But, the success of the methods considered varied {{due to the nature of}} the fill materials. A through investigation was carried out to establish the shear strength envelope. The shear strength envelopes were established, they are as follows: i 0 Particle sizes pertaining to the whole grading curve; ii) Specific particles size ranges; These tests indicate that the envelope can e segregated into two sections, one for the low stress region and another for the high stress region. The results of the former indicate tht the shear strength is stress dependent and can be accurately fitted by curvilinear regression analyses. The interaction tests carried out in this study and the data reviewed fro the other sources when represented non-dimentionally indicates that the RMS strips and the Tenser SR 2 grinds yield the highest alpha values and hence the coefficients of friction. The result of shales tested with RMS strips yeild the highest coefficients of interaction. Envelopes have been formulated, subsequent to the collection of data for all the materials considered in this study. The results indicates that the alpha values as presented in BE 3 / 78 (re viced) are conservative, in the case of the RMS strips. The pull-out tests carried out in this study indicates that the RMS strips are the most efficient of all the conventional strips. The grid tests yielded the highest pull-out forces and they were most efficient of all the reinforcements tested. The field pull-out test data as reported by we indicated that the friction coefficients were lower with respect to the laboratory Data. This can be attributed to the difference in compaction. Comparison of the coefficient of friction indicates that the skin friction tests as measured in the shearbox are lower with respect to the pull-out test data. An equation was formulated using the results of the established Mohr envelopes with respect to particle size, skin friction tests and the spacing of the ribs in a RMS strip. The predicted values are accurate to within 10 % of the measured values. The assessments of the cost benefits of using collier discards as the fill materials indicate that the benefit of colliery discard utilization is dependent on the cost of the fill and the haulage costs. With the benefits being over 30 % with respect to conventional structures. The results of this study indicate that colliery discards when carefully selected and tested can be used as a fill material in reinforced earth constructions...|$|R

40|$|Dados de dois grupos genéticos foram avaliados pela técnica de componentes principais, o primeiro composto por 629 animais provenientes do grupo genético UFV 1 e o segundo, por 707 animais do grupo genético UFV 2. As seguintes características para análise: Peso da ave (P 1, P 2, P 3 e P 4), peso médio do ovo (POM 1, POM 2, POM 3 e POM 4), peso médio da casca (PCM 1, PCM 2, PCM 3 e PCM 4), peso médio da gema (PGM 1, PGM 2, PGM 3 e PGM 4), gravidade específica média do ovo (DM 1, DM 2, DM 3 e DM 4), largura média do ovo (LOM 1, LOM 2, LOM 3 e LOM 4), comprimento médio do ovo (COM 1, COM 2, COM 3 e COM 4), número de ovos (N 1, N 2, N 3 e N 4) e idade ao primeiro ovo (IDPO). A análise de multicolinearidade entre as características do grupo genético UFV 1, foram eliminadas as variáveis POM 2, N 1, POM 1 por provocarem severa multicolinearidade nas características analisadas. Dos 30 componentes principais do grupo genético UFV 1, 19 (63, 3 %) apresentaram autovalor menor do que 0, 7 e foram descartados seguindo critério proposto por JOLLIFFE (1972, 1973). A análise dos componentes principais indicou as características COM 1, PGM 1, PCM 1, P 1, LOM 2, PGM 2, LOM 3, PCM 3, PGM 4, DM 4 e IDPO para serem usadas seus desdobramentos nos estudos de componentes principais. Para o grupo genético UFV 2 foram identificadas e eliminadas as variáveis POM 3, POM 4, POM 2 E LOM 3 que provocaram severa multicolinearidade nas características analisadas. Dos 29 componentes principais do grupo genético UFV 2, 19 (65, 5 %) apresentaram autovalor menor do que 0, 7 e foram descartadas. As características recomendadas para análise dos componentes principais são: PCM 1, P 1, LOM 2, P 2, N 2, COM 3, DM 3, LOM 4, PCM 4 e IDPO. As estimativas de herdabilidade das características selecionadas no grupo genético UFV 1 foram COM 1 (0, 24), PGM 1 (0, 24), PCM 1 (0, 54), P 1 (0, 34), LOM 2 (0, 38), PGM 2 (0, 33), LOM 3 (0, 49), PCM 3 (0, 49), PGM 4 (0, 32), DM 4 (0, 44), IDPO(0, 10) e TXT(0, 09). As estimativas de herdabilidade das características selecionadas no grupo genético UFV 2 foram PCM 1 (0, 27), P 1 (0, 21), LOM 2 (0, 43), P 2 (0, 22), N 2 (0, 03), COM 3 (0, 27), DM 3 (0, 51), LOM 4 (0, 49), PCM 4 (0, 57), IDPO(0, 09) e TXT(0, 07). Existe grande variabilidade para as características qualitativas dos ovos em ambas linhagens de codorna corte e as correlações genéticas mostram a possibilidade de ganhos correlacionados nas características qualitativas dos ovos quando a seleção for praticada no peso corporal. Espera-se pequena resposta a seleção para produção de ovos em ambos os grupos genéticos. Data {{from two}} genetic groups were {{evaluated}} by main component technique, the first group made up of 629 animals proceeding from the UFV 1 genetic group and the second made up by 707 from the genetic group UFV 2. The following characteristics for analyses: bird weight (P 1, P 2, P 3 and P 4), egg average weight (POM 1, POM 2, POM 3 and POM 4), shell average weight(PCM 1, PCM 2, PCM 3 and PCM 4), yolk average weight (PGM 1, PGM 2, PGM 3 and PGM 4), egg average specific gravity (DM 1, DM 2, DM 3 and DM 4), egg average width (LOM 1, LOM 2, LOM 3 and LOM 4), egg average length (COM 1, COM 2, COM 3 and COM 4), number of eggs (N 1, N 2, N 3 and N 4) and age at the first egg (IDPO). The analysis of multicolinearity among {{the characteristics of the}} UFV 1 genetic group, the variables POM 2, N 1, POM 1 were eliminated because they provoked severe multicolinearity in the analyzed characteristics. 19 (63. 3 %) out of 30 main components of the UFV 1 genetic group, showed self-value lower than 0. 7 and they were <b>discarded</b> following the <b>criteria</b> proposed by JOLLIFFE (1972, 1973). The analyses of the main components indicated the characteristics COM 1, PGM 1, PCM 1, P 1, LOM 2, PGM 2, LOM 3, PCM 3, PGM 4, DM 4 and IDPO to be used in their decomposition {{in the study of the}} main components. For the genetic group UFV 2 the variables POM 3, POM 4, POM 2 and LOM 3 were identified and eliminated because of causing severe multicolinearity in the analyzed characteristics. 19 (65. 5 %) out of 29 main components in the UFV 2 genetic group, showed self-value lower than 0. 7 and they were discarded. The suggested characteristics for analyses of the main components are the following: PCM 1, P 1, LOM 2, P 2, N 2, COM 3, DM 3, LOM 4, PCM 4 and IDPO. The estimate of inherit capacity of the selected characteristics in UFV 1 genetic group were: COM 1 (0, 24), PGM 1 (0, 24), PCM 1 (0, 54), P 1 (0, 34), LOM 2 (0, 38), PGM 2 (0, 33), LOM 3 (0, 49), PCM 3 (0, 49), PGM 4 (0, 32), DM 4 (0, 44), IDPO(0, 10) and TXT(0, 09). The estimate of inherit capacity of the selected characteristics in the UFV 2 genetic group were PCM 1 (0, 27), P 1 (0, 21), LOM 2 (0, 43), P 2 (0, 22), N 2 (0, 03), COM 3 (0, 27), DM 3 (0, 51), LOM 4 (0, 49), PCM 4 (0, 57), IDPO(0, 09) and TXT(0, 07). There is a high variability for the egg qualitative charactherisistscs in both quail lineage and the genetic correlation show the possibility of gains correlated in the egg qualitative characteristic when the selection is practiced in the body weight. It is expected small answer for the selection for egg production in both genetic groups...|$|R
