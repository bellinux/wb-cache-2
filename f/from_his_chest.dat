5|$|This three-part finale to the Venom {{series was}} {{published}} between November 1997 and January 1998. The Overreach Committee (the organization {{in charge of}} Brock's clandestine agency) decides to terminate {{him because of his}} brutal methods. Brock cuts the bomb <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest,</b> and uses it to escape. His escape brings him into a confrontation with Spider-Man. After a fight with Spider-Man and an injection of dopamine blockers by Agent Smith, Brock is separated from the symbiote (which is apparently killed when Brock is re-arrested). The final issue sees Brock recover some memory of his history with Spider-Man; he had lost his knowledge of the hero's secret identity in the Spider-Man/Venom single issue (December 1997).|$|E
5|$|Dr. Mason Wren (J. E. Freeman) {{is one of}} five {{scientists}} {{employed by}} the USM to clone the Alien Queen. After the Queen is extracted from Ripley, Wren conducts social experiments on Number 8 (whom he considers a predator). He discovers Call infiltrating Number 8's cell, and orders the mercenaries rounded up for execution. They overpower the infantry and take Wren hostage, forcing him to lead them to the Betty. During an Alien attack, Wren shoots Call and escapes from his captors. He confronts the crew of the Betty aboard the ship as Larry Purvis' Alien begins to emerge <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest.</b> Wren shoots Purvis, who overpowers him and pulls Wren's head to Purvis' chest. The chestburster erupts through Purvis' rib cage and Wren's skull, killing them both.|$|E
5|$|Private William Hudson (Bill Paxton) is the Colonial Marines' comedian and comtech expert. Arrogant and overconfident, he soon cracks {{under the}} stress of the failed {{incursion}} into the Alien hive. Hudson despairs and panics until Ripley and Newt reassure him, enabling him to regain his composure. He fights to the end in the colony's operation room, where the survivors of the party make their final stand, and is pulled through a floor grate by an Alien while providing cover fire. In Aliens: Colonial Marines, Hudson's corpse was discovered in the sewers with a large hole in his chest, revealing that Hudson was impregnated by a Facehugger after he was dragged beneath the grates and later died when a chestburster erupted <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest.</b>|$|E
60|$|The ape-man {{raised his}} face to Kudu, the sun, and <b>from</b> <b>his</b> mighty <b>chest</b> rose the savage victory cry of the bull ape.|$|R
60|$|The boy spoke jestingly, but it {{was clear}} <b>from</b> <b>his</b> heaving <b>chest,</b> partially-open mouth, and {{glittering}} eyes, that his little heart was stirred to an unwonted depth of emotion.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is true," [...] Uiliami boomed <b>from</b> <b>his</b> deep <b>chest.</b> [...] "Have you {{any more}} silk shirts like Willie Smee's? Tui Tulifau would like such a shirt. He has heard of it." ...|$|R
5|$|Sergeant Lope (Demi√°n Bichir) is {{the ranking}} {{military}} officer aboard the Covenant {{who is married}} to Sergeant Hallett. Lope leads the excursion on the planet's surface to the crashed Engineer ship. On the journey back to the lander, Lope notices Hallett's condition deteriorating, which alarms him. Upon reaching the lander, the ship explodes and a Neomorph attacks while another bursts from his husband's throat. A Neomorph attacks Lope when David intervenes and leads the survivors to his base, where Lope discovers Shaw's corpse. He is attacked by a Facehugger, but he is quickly and seemingly saved by Cole, who manages to cut it off him, though his face is severely burned by acid in the process. As Cole is killed by a now mature Alien, Lope escapes with the other survivors to the cargo lander. Aboard Covenant, Lope receives medical treatment, but dies when an Alien erupts <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest,</b> revealing that despite the short time that the Facehugger was on him, it succeeded in impregnating him.|$|E
5|$|Christopher Oram (Billy Crudup) is {{the chief}} mate aboard the colony ship Covenant and the husband of Kariine Oram. With Branson's death {{as a result of}} the {{neutrino}} flair from the nearby star, Christopher becomes the captain of Covenant, though he perceives his command as being questioned by Daniels and the other crew members. When Shaw's transmission is received from the habitable Engineer home world, Christopher orders Covenant to divert to the planet, though his judgment is met with protests from Daniels. After leading a ground expedition to the crashed Engineer ship, Christopher returns to the lander to see it explode. Christopher accepts David's aid on behalf of the survivors and accompanies David back to his base. He searches for Rosenthal, who he finds decapitated, along with David communicating with the Neomorph that killed her. Christopher kills the Neomorph and holds David at gunpoint, demanding an explanation for his activities. David leads him to his makeshift laboratory, as well as a hatchery, where he keeps a number of Alien eggs. David goads Christopher into approaching an egg, which results in a Facehugger attacking and impregnating him. Christopher is awoken a short time later by David, only to have the first Alien chestburster erupt <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest,</b> killing him.|$|E
5|$|Ripley deciphers {{part of the}} transmission, {{determining}} it's not a distress signal, but {{a warning}} of some kind. In the spacecraft, Kane discovers a chamber containing hundreds of large egg-like objects. When he touches one, it opens and a creature springs out and attaches to his face through the facemask of his spacesuit. Dallas and Lambert carry the unconscious Kane back to the Nostromo. As acting senior officer, Ripley refuses to let them aboard, citing quarantine regulations, but Ash ignores Ripley and lets them in. The crew unsuccessfully attempt to remove the creature from Kane's face, discovering that its blood is an extremely corrosive acid. It later detaches on its own and is found dead. The ship is partly repaired, and the crew lifts off. Kane awakens with some memory loss but otherwise unharmed. During a final crew meal before returning to stasis, he chokes and convulses in pain then dies as a small alien creature bursts <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> and escapes into the ship. The crew attempts to locate it with a tracking device and capture or kill it with nets, electric prods and flamethrowers.|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{would kill}} me," [...] he cried hoarsely, [...] "kill me!" ... And a demoniacal laugh broke <b>from</b> <b>his</b> swollen throat. He tore the {{garments}} <b>from</b> off <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> and buried <b>his</b> nails {{in his own}} flesh, whilst roar upon roar of his mad laughter woke the echoes of his stately palace.|$|R
6000|$|He stopped, {{the colour}} fled <b>from</b> <b>his</b> cheeks, <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> heaved. He almost gasped for breath. Could he believe his eyes, for there stood {{a girl with}} the features, the hair, the eyes of Cormac, but {{infinitely}} more beautiful! ...|$|R
60|$|Miss MACPHERSON of Cluny kindly {{gave me a}} copy of {{a privately}} printed Memorial of her celebrated ancestor, and, by CLUNY'S kind permission, I have been allowed to see some letters <b>from</b> <b>his</b> charter <b>chest.</b> Apparently, the more {{important}} secret papers have perished in the years of turmoil and exile.|$|R
5|$|The {{following}} year, on September 19, 1827, Bowie and Wright {{attended a}} duel on a sandbar outside of Natchez, Mississippi. Bowie supported duellist Samuel Levi Wells III, while Wright supported Wells's opponent, Dr. Thomas Harris Maddox. The duellists each fired two shots and, as neither {{man had been}} injured, resolved their duel with a handshake. Other members of the groups, who had various reasons for disliking each other, began fighting. Bowie {{was shot in the}} hip; after regaining his feet he drew a knife, described as a butcher knife, and charged his attacker, who hit Bowie over the head with his empty pistol, breaking the pistol and knocking Bowie to the ground. Wright shot at and missed the prone Bowie, who returned fire and possibly hit Wright. Wright then drew his sword cane and impaled Bowie. When Wright attempted to retrieve his blade by placing his foot on Bowie's chest and tugging, Bowie pulled him down and disemboweled Wright with his large knife. Wright died instantly, and Bowie, with Wright's sword still protruding <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest,</b> was shot again and stabbed by another member of the group. The doctors who had been present for the duel removed the bullets and patched Bowie's other wounds.|$|E
25|$|Red Alert {{was armed}} with the blaster {{installed}} {{in his left hand}} and with the power lasso. Also he could eject a power ring <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest.</b> His Mini-Con partner's name was Longarm.|$|E
25|$|Caruso's health {{deteriorated}} further {{during the}} new year. He experienced episodes of intense pain {{because of the}} infection and underwent seven surgical procedures to drain fluid <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> and lungs. He returned to Naples to recuperate from the most serious of the operations, during which part of a rib had been removed. According to Dorothy Caruso, {{he seemed to be}} recovering, but allowed himself to be examined by an unhygienic local doctor and his condition worsened dramatically after that. The Bastianelli brothers, eminent medical practitioners with a clinic in Rome, recommended that his left kidney be removed. He {{was on his way to}} Rome to see them but, while staying overnight in the Vesuvio Hotel in Naples, he took an alarming turn for the worse and was given morphine to help him sleep.|$|E
5000|$|Chamber (Jonothon [...] "Jono" [...] Starsmore), a British mutant who {{produced}} huge blasts of energy <b>from</b> <b>his</b> upper <b>chest.</b> When <b>his</b> powers first manifested, they destroyed {{the lower half}} of <b>his</b> face and <b>chest,</b> leaving him with only his limited telepathic powers with which to communicate, and releasing him from any necessity to eat, drink, or breathe. Because of this, he is characteristically sullen and bitter.|$|R
60|$|Then Owen {{remembered the}} superstition, and {{snatching}} blue-stone and spirits of wine <b>from</b> <b>his</b> medicine <b>chest,</b> he rushed to John's hut. As it happened, he was fortunately {{in time with}} his remedies and succeeded in saving the woman's life, whereby {{his reputation as a}} doctor and a magician, already great, was considerably enlarged.|$|R
6000|$|... "Whoop!" [...] The yell leaped past my lips. Quiet Jim was yelling; and Emett, silent {{man of the}} desert, let <b>from</b> <b>his</b> wide {{cavernous}} <b>chest</b> {{a booming}} roar that drowned ours.|$|R
25|$|While {{staying in}} Bangalore {{in the first}} half of 1898, Churchill {{explored}} the possibility of joining Herbert Kitchener's military campaign in the Sudan. Kitchener was initially reticent, claiming that Churchill was simply seeking publicity and medals. After spending time in Calcutta, Meerut, and Peshawar, Churchill sailed back to England from Bombay in June. There, he used his contacts‚Äîincluding a visit to the Prime Minister Lord Salisbury at 10 Downing Street‚Äîto get himself assigned to Kitchener's campaign. He agreed that he would write a column describing the events for The Morning Post. He sailed for Egypt, where he joined the 21st Lancers at Cairo before they headed south along the River Nile to take part in the Battle of Omdurman against the army of Sudanese leader Abdallahi ibn Muhammad. Churchill was critical of Kitchener's actions during the war, particularly the latter's treatment of enemy wounded and his desecration of Muhammad Ahmad's tomb in Omdurman. Following the battle, Churchill gave skin <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> for a graft for an injured officer. Back in England by October, Churchill wrote an account of the operation, published as The River War in November 1899.|$|E
25|$|Starman is {{sent into}} space {{to search for}} Alan, and finds that Alan has {{constructed}} a massive fortress {{on the surface of}} the moon. Before Starman can warn the others, Alan appears in front of him and tears his gem, the source of his abilities, <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest,</b> thus rendering him powerless. The Starheart uses its influence to corrupt various metahumans with magical or elemental abilities, which creates chaos across the globe. Realizing that the heroes must defeat Alan in order to end the chaos, Batman recruits Miss Martian to get a mental lock on Starman, which, in turn, provides the Justice League with Alan's location. Batman then assembles a small strikeforce consisting of himself, Jade, Hourman, Donna Troy, Jesse Quick, and Mr. America, all of whom have a low chance of being possessed by the Starheart. Mister Miracle arrives and informs the team that Alan has most likely installed Fourth World defenses in his base and offers to use his knowledge of such technology to guide them through the fortress. When they finally find him, Jade uses her powers to restore Alan to normal. With his sanity restored, Alan chooses to allow the Emerald City he created on the moon to stay, and the city becomes populated by various magical creatures from throughout the DCU.|$|E
25|$|Jimmy {{travels to}} Apokolips {{and decides to}} confront Darkseid to {{determine}} his involvement with {{what is going on}} with his manifesting powers. Solomon tells him that he had been turned into a spirit collector by Darkseid, who plans to drain him of all his powers when the time comes. He is then sent back to Earth along with everyone else. Jimmy is later captured by Mary Marvel who intends to deliver him to Darkseid. Darkseid turns Jimmy's powers off and prepares to absorb them, but is attacked by Superman. As they battle, Mary Marvel fights and defeats Donna, Kyle, Forager, Black Canary, and Vixen. Darkseid reactivates Jimmy's power to cause him to emit kryptonite radiation to kill Superman. However, Ray Palmer sneaks inside Jimmy and destroys the circuitry that controls his powers before being overcome by its defenses. Jimmy transforms into a scaled giant and prepares to fight Darkseid. Darkseid fights Jimmy across Metropolis and is about to kill him when Ray Palmer emerges from Jimmy's head, having shut down the device inside Jimmy that was storing the essences of the New Gods. A Boom Tube then opens up and Orion, Darkseid's son, emerges. Orion clashes with Darkseid and kills him after ripping Darkseid's heart <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest.</b> Soon afterwards Jimmy returns home, where his relationship with Forager deteriorates.|$|E

5000|$|Campaign finances. The councilman {{was accused}} by {{auditors}} of the California Franchise Tax Board of [...] "personally receiving more than $12,000 in interest <b>from</b> <b>his</b> campaign war <b>chest</b> in 1979 without publicly disclosing it." ...|$|R
50|$|During {{the postwar}} times the poet wrote a {{collection}} of poems called ‚ÄúTwo shores‚Äù, dedicated to hard life of Azerbaijani paupers in Iran and postwar flourishing of the Soviet Azerbaijan. Image of hero Qafur Mammadov, who shielded <b>his</b> commander <b>from</b> enemies by <b>his</b> <b>chest,</b> was created in ‚ÄúQafur‚Äôs heart‚Äù poem.|$|R
25|$|That night, {{the people}} of Storybrooke are all celebrating at Granny's diner. Lily tells Emma {{that she wants to}} find the {{identity}} of her father and plans on staying in Storybrooke during her search. Belle shows up to tell everyone that the last bit of humanity in Gold's heart is about to be consumed by the Darkness, and the group finds Gold unconscious in his shop. The Apprentice then removes Gold's nearly-black heart <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest,</b> and uses his power to pull the Darkness out of Gold's heart and transfer it into the Sorcerer‚Äôs Hat, which severs Gold's link to the Dagger of Kris in the process. He then puts a pure white heart back into Gold, and casts a preservation spell on Gold, to keep him alive while they figure out how to help him recover. However, the hat is unable to contain the Darkness, and it breaks out, before attacking and entering the Apprentice. Emma uses her light magic to force the Darkness back out of the Apprentice, and the Darkness exits the shop. As the Apprentice lies dying, he tells Emma and Hook that, long ago, centuries before their births, the Sorcerer battled the Darkness and tethered it to a human soul with the Dark One's Dagger, and now that it's free, the only person who can prevent the Darkness from destroying all the realms is the Sorcerer himself: Merlin.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the victims}} had been {{rendered}} unconscious prior to their murder, although some had {{died as a result}} of having acid or boiling water injected into their brain. (As he had no memory of the murder of Tuomi, he was unsure whether he was unconscious when beaten to death, although he did concede it was possible that his viewing the exposed chest of Steven Tuomi while in a drunken stupor may have led him to unsuccessfully attempt to tear Tuomi's heart <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest.)</b> Almost all the murders Dahmer committed after moving into the Oxford Apartments had involved a ritual of posing the victims' bodies in suggestive positions‚Äîtypically with the chest thrust outwards‚Äîprior to dismemberment. He readily admitted to performing necrophilia with several of his victims' bodies, including performing sexual acts with their viscera as he dismembered their bodies in his bathtub. Having noted that much of the blood pooled inside his victims' chest after death, Dahmer would first remove the internal organs, then suspend the torso so the blood would drain into his bathtub, before dicing any organs he did not wish to retain and paring the flesh from the body. The bones he wished to dispose of would be pulverized or acidified, with Soilex and bleach solutions used to aid in the preservation of the skeletons and skulls he wished to keep. In addition, he confessed to having consumed the hearts, livers, biceps, and portions of thighs of several victims killed within the previous year.|$|E
500|$|Kennedy {{had been}} shot three times. One bullet, fired at a range of about , entered behind his right ear, {{dispersing}} fragments throughout his brain. The other two entered {{at the rear of}} his right armpit; one exited <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> and the other lodged {{in the back of his}} neck. [...] Despite extensive neurosurgery at the Good Samaritan Hospital to remove the bullet and bone fragments from his brain, Kennedy was pronounced dead at 1:44 a.m. (PDT) on June 6, nearly 26 hours after the shooting.|$|E
50|$|Sandor puts silver crucifixes {{in the two}} coffins {{to prevent}} the vampires from coming back. He then captures Helen and drives a stake through her heart, killing her. Ludwig then lures Diana into Dracula‚Äôs presence, where the Count hypnotizes her into {{removing}} her crucifix. Dracula coerces her to drink <b>his</b> blood <b>from</b> <b>his</b> bare <b>chest,</b> but Charles returns in time to prevent it, forcing Dracula to flee with the unconscious Diana.|$|R
5000|$|A simple {{innovation}} {{that would later}} change the whole retail tea industry had been introduced in 1826 by John Horniman, who hit {{on the idea of}} packaging tea so that customers could buy a reliable and known brand with confidence and not have to rely on what the grocer selected <b>from</b> <b>his</b> tea <b>chests.</b> A simple machine was soon devised to carry out the process more speedily and efficiently.|$|R
60|$|As he came {{his upper}} lip curled into a snarl, exposing his {{fighting}} fangs, and a deep growl rumbled <b>from</b> <b>his</b> cavernous <b>chest.</b> Taug looked up, batting his blood-shot eyes.

At any rate, she was feminine, and so she reached up and scratched Taug behind one of his small, flat ears.|$|R
500|$|Mahmoud Makki Abutaki was a 22-year-old {{college student}} majoring in engineering, {{when he died}} on 17February after being {{shot in the back}} by police. Medics pulled about 200 pellets of birdshot <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> and arms. Abutaki's elder brother, Ahmed, who was in the morgue while holding his brothers' hands, {{recalled}} the last conversation they had the previous night for the media present: [...] "He said, 'This is my chance, to have a say, so that maybe our country will do something for us.' My country did do something; it killed him." ...|$|E
500|$|The 29-year-old Stalin {{was living}} in Tiflis with his wife Ekaterina and newborn son Yakov. Stalin was {{experienced}} at organizing robberies, and these exploits had helped him gain a reputation as the Centre's principal financier. Kamo, four years younger than Stalin, {{had a reputation for}} ruthlessness; later in his life he cut a man's heart <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest.</b> At the time of the conspiracy, Kamo ran a criminal organization called [...] "the Outfit". Stalin said that Kamo was [...] "a master of disguise", and Lenin called Kamo his [...] "Caucasian bandit". [...] Stalin and Kamo had grown up together, and Stalin had converted Kamo to Marxism.|$|E
500|$|Stane's {{scientists}} cannot duplicate Stark's miniaturized arc reactor, so Stane ambushes Stark at {{his home}} and takes the one <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest.</b> Stark manages {{to get to his}} original reactor to replace it. Potts and several S.H.I.E.L.D. agents attempt to arrest Stane, but he dons his suit and attacks them. Stark fights Stane, but is outmatched without his new reactor to run his suit at full capacity. The fight carries Stark and Stane {{to the top of the}} Stark Industries building, and Stark instructs Potts to overload the large arc reactor powering the building. This unleashes a massive electrical surge that causes Stane and his armor to fall into the exploding reactor, killing him. The next day, at a press conference, Stark defies suggestions from S.H.I.E.L.D. and publicly admits to being the superhero the press has dubbed [...] "Iron Man".|$|E
50|$|Mims {{took over}} the Showboat hosting duties {{following}} runs by Cap'n Ken Wagner, Cap'n Verne Gielow and Cap'n Don Warren. The show featured cartoons intercut with segments on his riverboat the Dixie Belle, where Cap'n Ernie would chat with his puppet friend Sidney (voiced and animated by Craig Frogley), would give away prizes <b>from</b> <b>his</b> treasure <b>chest,</b> or interact with {{the children in the}} audience. The show ran until August 1974. None of the 2,600 live episodes were archived.|$|R
25|$|Another type of pass is the bounce pass. Here, the passer bounces {{the ball}} crisply {{about two-thirds of}} the way <b>from</b> <b>his</b> own <b>chest</b> to the receiver. The ball strikes the court and bounces up toward the receiver. The bounce pass takes longer to {{complete}} than the chest pass, but it is also harder for the opposing team to intercept (kicking the ball deliberately is a violation). Thus, players often use the bounce pass in crowded moments, or to pass around a defender.|$|R

Even thee, {{the king}} of men, he does not spare, (The monkey author) but thy greatness pageants, And makes of it rehearsals: like a player, Bellowing his passion till he break the spring, And his racked voice jar to his audience; So {{represents}} he thee, though more unlike Than Vulcan is to Venus. And at this fulsome stuff,--the wit of apes,-- The large Achilles, on his prest bed lolling, <b>From</b> <b>his</b> deep <b>chest</b> roars out a loud applause, Tickling his spleen, and laughing till he wheeze.|$|R
