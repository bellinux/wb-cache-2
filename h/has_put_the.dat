5|$|The literary, {{as well as}} the historical, {{value of}} the Historia Augusta has {{suffered}} greatly {{as a result of the}} method of its composition. In the arrangement in categories of the historical material, the authors did but follow the accepted principles of the art of biography as practised in antiquity, but their narratives, consisting often of mere excerpts arranged without regard to connexion or transition, lack grace and even cohesion. The over-emphasis of personal details and the introduction of anecdotal material destroy the proportion of many sections, and the insertion of forged documents interrupts the course of the narrative, without adding anything of historical value or even of general interest. Finally, the later addition of lengthy passages and brief notes, frequently in paragraphs with the general content of which they have no connexion, <b>has</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> crowning touch to the awkwardness and incoherence of the whole, with the result that the oft-repeated charge seems almost justified, that these biographies are little more than literary monstrosities.|$|E
5|$|Meyer {{originally}} planned {{to write a}} companion book to Twilight called Midnight Sun, {{which would be the}} story of Twilight told from Edward Cullen's point-of-view. She stated that Twilight was the only book that she planned to rewrite from Edward's perspective. However, a rough draft of Midnight Sun's first twelve chapters was leaked on the internet. Meyer has since put these twelve chapters on her website so that her fans could read them for free, but <b>has</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> project on hold indefinitely due to her feelings about the situation. She stated, If I tried to write Midnight Sun now, in my current frame of mind, James would probably win and all the Cullens would die, which wouldn't dovetail too well with the original story. In any case, I feel too sad about what has happened to continue working on Midnight Sun, and so it is on hold indefinitely. Though she has no current plans to do so, Meyer has also stated that if she were to continue writing in the same universe she would write from the perspective of either Leah Clearwater or Bella and Edward's daughter, Renesmee Cullen.|$|E

5|$|Sibley and Ahlquist's {{molecular}} {{study of}} the evolution of the bird families <b>has</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> radiation of the Procellariiformes in the Oligocene period (35â€“30 million years ago), though this group probably originated earlier, with a fossil sometimes attributed to the order, a seabird known as Tytthostonyx, being found in late Cretaceous rocks (70 mya). The molecular evidence suggests that the storm petrels were the first to diverge from the ancestral stock, and the albatrosses next, with the procellarids and diving petrels separating later. The earliest fossil albatrosses were found in Eocene to Oligocene rocks, although some of these are only tentatively assigned to the family and none appear to be particularly close to the living forms. They are Murunkus (Middle Eocene of Uzbekistan), Manu (early Oligocene of New Zealand), and an undescribed form from the Late Oligocene of South Carolina. Similar to the last was Plotornis, formerly often considered a petrel but now accepted as an albatross. It is from the Middle Miocene of France, a time when the split between the four modern genera was already underway as evidenced by Phoebastria californica and Diomedea milleri, both being mid-Miocene species from Sharktooth Hill, California. These show that the split between the great albatrosses and the North Pacific albatrosses occurred by 15 mya. Similar fossil finds in the Southern Hemisphere put the split between the sooties and mollymawks at 10 mya.|$|E

25|$|Since then, {{the park}} has managed to survive and be self-sustaining. However, serious {{environmental}} problems continue to plague that park {{and the rest of}} chinampa lands in Xochimilco. Pollution of the waters in the lakes and canals continue to be serious, as sewage and household garbage finds its way into the water. However, the most pressing problem is invasions of chinampa land by illegal settlements. In 2004 and 2007, families who had been swindled into illegally buying lands in the park lost their homes as they were evicted. Many people living illegally on the land have organized to put political pressure on authorities to let them remain, with mixed success. The fact that there are still illegal settlements in the park, which is land designated as a World Heritage Site, <b>has</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> borough at odds with UNESCO. UNESCO wants all illegal settlements out in order to preserve the site's status, but borough officials claim this would not be feasible.|$|E
25|$|About 99% of the Iranians are Muslims; 90% {{belong to}} the Shi'a branch of Islam, the {{official}} state religion, and about 9% {{belong to the}} Sunni branch, which predominates in neighboring Muslim countries. Less than 1% non-Muslim minorities include Christians, Zoroastrians, Jews, BahÃ¡'Ã­s, Mandeans, and Yarsan. By far {{the largest group of}} Christians in Iran are Armenians under the Armenian Apostolic Church which has between 110,000, 250,000, and 300,000, adherents. There are hundreds of Christian churches in Iran. The BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith, Iran's largest non-Muslim religious minority with a population around 300,000, is not officially recognized (and therefore not included in the census results), and has been persecuted during its existence in Iran. Since the 1979 revolution the persecution of BahÃ¡'Ã­s has increased with executions, the denial of civil rights and liberties, and the denial of access to higher education and employment. Unofficial estimates for the Assyrian Christian population range between 20,000, and 70,000. The number of Iranian Mandaeans is a matter of dispute. In 2009, there were an estimated 5,000 and 10,000 Mandaeans in Iran, according to the Associated Press. Whereas Alarabiya <b>has</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> number of Iranian Mandaeans as high as 60,000 in 2011.|$|E
500|$|Lost Horizons {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics, although several critics critiqued the album's near-constant mellowness. Stuart Mason of AllMusic called the album [...] "a delightful but slightly faceless blend of lounge pop, subtle beats, found sound, with mellow jazz influences." [...] A reviewer for Entertainment.ie praised the band for approaching electronica {{from a new}} angle, writing, [...] "this London-based duo employ Playschool pianos, acoustic guitars and sprightly beats to create laid-back instrumentals guaranteed to soothe even the most restless of souls. [...] What really marks Lemon Jelly as exciting new talents is their quirky sense of humour, which they use to brighten up their sound with skilful use of nursery rhymes, brass bands and offbeat samples. Pascal Wyse of The Guardian wrote, [...] "Everything is approachable and purely crafted, but Lost Horizons cheats banality with some choice quirks: Magnificent Seven strings, astronauts chatting, panoramic sound effects." [...] Chris Dahlen of Pitchfork felt that the album {{was a little too}} saccharine at times, but that it is [...] "the perfect disc to throw on after your four-disc Ultrachill Dub Groove Mix <b>has</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> whole party to sleep.
