5|$|After its {{defeat in}} World War I, Germany was banned from {{operating}} an air <b>force</b> <b>by</b> the Treaty of Versailles. German re-armament began earnestly in the 1930s and was initially kept secret because it violated the treaty.

40|$|Although {{airborne}} mineral aerosols {{are traditionally}} considered a natural {{component of the}} earth-atmosphere climate system, an examination of dust production mechanisms and dust source regions reveals that a significant fraction of the dust loading {{could be due to}} human activities. We find that the global mean direct solar radiative <b>forcing</b> <b>by</b> anthropogenically generated mineral aerosols may be comparable to the direct solar radiative <b>forcing</b> <b>by</b> other anthropogenic aerosols. The net regional <b>forcing</b> <b>by</b> mineral aerosols can greatly exceed the regional <b>forcing</b> <b>by</b> sulfate aerosol and can even be comparable to the net <b>forcing</b> <b>by</b> clouds. An improved understanding of the radiative forcing due to mineral aerosols requires better knowledge of the regional patterns of dust production rates and dust optical depths, more comprehensive measurements of dust microphysical and optical characteristics, as well as a comprehensive assessment of the role of dust aerosols on infrared radiative forcing...|$|R

5|$|As CGS, Duigan {{proved to}} be an undistinguished {{appointment}} and was not particularly well regarded by the politicians of the day. He implemented several organisational changes, one of which was the disestablishment of the GOC position and its replacement with an army board to control the military. When the board was established in November 1937, it included Fred Jones, the Minister of Defence, and Duigan as first military member. Duigan offered little counter to the favouring of the fledgling Royal New Zealand Air <b>Force</b> <b>by</b> the New Zealand Government of the time, and this affected morale within the army.|$|E

A contingent was allocated further south, {{in order to}} secure the safety of the main <b>force</b> <b>by</b> flanking Sha'ar HaGolan and Masada from the west.

5|$|In early 1643, Parliament placed Newark under siege, and the {{garrison}} at Ashby {{was sent to}} relieve it.

King Charles passed through the castle in May 1645 on his way to besiege Leicester, but the following month his forces were defeated at the Battle of Naseby; the King briefly stayed at the castle once again as he retreated west. By now, the Royalist cause was largely lost.|$|E

Originally established for the Royal Flying Corps, it has the longest history of continuous use of any RAF airfield. Before the outbreak of the Second World War, the station was the first to take delivery of the Hawker Hurricane. The station played a key role during the Battle of Britain, when fighters from several of its units, including No. 303 Polish Fighter Squadron, engaged enemy aircraft as part of the defence of London. It became the first base to have squadrons operating Supermarine Spitfire aircraft within German airspace.|$|E
