However, there are about 80 nouns {{representing}} inanimate entities which are nonetheless animate in gender: heavenly objects (moon, rainbow), metal objects (<b>hammer,</b> <b>ring),</b> edible plants (sweet potato, pea), and non-metallic objects (whistle, ball).

50|$|After leaving WCW, Hildreth took a brief hiatus from wrestling. On March 16, 2001, {{under his}} Van <b>Hammer</b> <b>ring</b> name and rock star gimmick, he lost to Thrasher in {{a match for}} Maryland Championship Wrestling. He {{returned}} to MCW on June 9, and defeated Dino Devine. On December 16, he teamed with Cowboy to defeat Devine and Chad Bowman. On February 16, 2002, Hammer teamed with Cowboy in a rematch against Devine and Bowman, which he and Cowboy lost. After a year long hiatus, Van Hammer returned to MCW on July 16, 2003 at MCW's annual Shane Shamrock Memorial Cup, where he won an eight-man tag team match alongside Gillberg, Thrasher and Kelly Bell against Brock Singleton, Genesis and The Holy Rollers (Earl the Pearl and Rich Meyes).|$|E

5000|$|... "Take This Hammer" [...] {{was issued}} as on {{commercial}} 78-rpm single by Lead Belly in 1940 {{and again in}} 1942. In his performance on this record, Lead Belly added a [...] "haah" [...] {{at the end of}} each line, explaining in his spoken introduction, [...] "Every time the men say 'haah', the hammer falls. The <b>hammer</b> <b>rings,</b> and we swing, and we sing." [...] In saying [...] "we", Lead Belly was undoubtedly referring to his many years an inmate of the notorious prison farm in Angola, Louisiana. Lead Belly's powerful version subsequently became a staple of the urban folk revival.|$|R
5000|$|In {{some of the}} {{recordings}} in which Lead Belly accompanied himself, he would make an unusual type of grunt between his verses, best described as [...] "Haah!"; [...] "Looky Looky Yonder," [...] "Take This Hammer," [...] "Linin' Track" [...] and [...] "Julie Ann Johnson" [...] feature this unusual vocalization. In [...] "Take This Hammer," [...] Lead Belly explained, [...] "Every time the men say, 'Haah,' the hammer falls. The <b>hammer</b> <b>rings,</b> and we swing, and we sing." [...] The [...] "haah" [...] sound {{can be heard in}} work chants sung by Southern railroad section workers, [...] "gandy dancers," [...] in which it was used to coordinate work crews as they laid and maintained tracks.|$|R
60|$|Early were <b>hammers</b> <b>ringing</b> on anvils in the Dragon Court, and all was activity. Master Headley {{was giving}} his orders to Kit Smallbones before setting forth {{to take the}} Duke of Buckingham's commands; Giles Headley, very much disgusted, was being {{invested}} with a leathern apron, and entrusted to Edmund Burgess to learn those primary arts of furbishing which, but for his mother's vanity and his father's weakness, he would have practised four years sooner. Tibble Steelman was superintending the arrangement {{of half a dozen}} corslets, which were to be carried by three stout porters, under his guidance, to what is now Whitehall, then the residence of the Archbishop of York, the king's prime adviser, Thomas Wolsey.|$|R

As she sat there listening to the voices of the men who were drawing this fragile shelter around her, a great awe fell upon her. It seemed as if she had drawn a little nearer to the Almighty Creator of the universe. Here, where no white man had ever set foot, she was watching the founding of her own house. Was it a home? Could it ever be a home? ...|$|R

60|$|After {{the roar}} of {{activity}} at the bridge, where the <b>hammers</b> <b>rang</b> all day and often far into the night, he found his new surroundings strangely pleasant. In Canada, {{he had lived in}} the wilds; on the vast bare plains, and among snowy mountains where man grappled with Nature in her sternest mood. Thundering snowslides swept away one's work, icy rocks must be cut through, and savage green floods threatened the half-built track when the glaciers began to melt. Every day had brought a fresh anxiety, and now he welcomed the slackening of the strain. The struggle had left its mark on him; one saw it in his lean, muscular symmetry, his quiet alertness, and self-confidence. But he could relax, and found the English countryside had a soothing charm.|$|R

60|$|The {{question}} of who was to go had not been hitherto decided, and Giles and Stephen were both so excited at being chosen that all low spirits and moodiness were dispelled, and the work which went on almost all night was merrily got through. The Dragon court was in a perpetual commotion with knights, squires, and grooms, coming in with orders for new armour, or for old to be furbished, and the tent-makers, lorimers, mercers, and tailors had their hands equally full. These lengthening mornings heard the <b>hammer</b> <b>ringing</b> at sunrise, and in the final rush, Smallbones never went to bed at all. He said he should make {{it up in the}} waggon on the way to Dover. Some hinted that he preferred the clang of his hammer to the good advice his Bet lavished on him at every leisure moment to forewarn him against French wine-pots.|$|R
60|$|Before {{the frost}} grew Arctic, the {{building}} stood firm and the <b>hammers</b> <b>rang</b> inside it {{night and day}} until when the ice had bound the dam and lead the fires were lighted and the trials under steam again. It cost more than water, but buyers with orders from the East were clamouring for flour just then. For a fortnight Witham snatched his food in mouthfuls, and scarcely closed his eyes, when Graham found him pale and almost haggard when he came down with several men from the cities {{in response to a}} telegram. For an hour they moved up and down, watching whirring belt and humming roller, and then, whitened with the dust, stood very intent and quiet while one of them dipped up a little flour from the delivery hopper. His opinions on, and dealings in that product were famous in the land. He said nothing for several minutes, and then, brushing the white dust from his hands, turned with a little smile to Graham.|$|R

It was glorious to hear the <b>hammers</b> <b>ringing,</b> and see the new pine buildings going up--and the tent and shanties. It was rough here then, but I {{had little to do}} with that. I staked out my claim and went to digging. I knew very little about mining, but they were striking it all around me, and so I kept on. Besides"--here he looked at her in a curiously shy way--"I've always had a superstition that just when things were worst with me they were soonest to turn to the best, so I dug away. My tunnel went into the hill on a slight upraise, and I could do the work alone. You see I had so little money I didn't want to waste a cent.|$|R

60|$|Sable Lake {{shone like}} a mirror among the ragged pines, as it ran back between the rocks, smooth as oil except where {{a puff of}} wind {{streaked}} its flashing surface with faint blue wrinkles. Behind it the lonely woods rolled on, south to Lake Superior and north to Hudson Bay. At one place a new transcontinental railroad cut {{its way through the}} forest; <b>hammers</b> <b>rang</b> and noisy gravel plows emptied the ballast cars along the half-graded track; but these sounds of human activity were quickly lost and in a mile or two only the splash of water and the elfin sighing in the pine-tops broke the deep silence of the woods. This belt of tangled forest, where the trees are stunted and the soil is sterile, offers no attraction to homesteader or lumberman. In consequence, it has lain desolate since the half-breed voyageurs, who crossed it with canoe and dog-team, abandoned the northwest trail when the Canadian Pacific locomotives began to pant through the rock-cuts by Lake Superior.|$|R
60|$|The Knight {{immediately}} walked forth {{into the}} court, where {{all had been}} activity and eagerness ever since {{the arrival of the}} summons, the smith hammering ceaselessly in his forge, yet without fulfilling half the order continually shouted in his ears; Gaston d'Aubricour and Ralph Penrose directing from morning to night, in contradiction of each other, the one always laughing, the other always grumbling; the men-at-arms and retainers some obeying orders, others being scolded, the steel clanging, <b>hammers</b> <b>ringing</b> without intermission. Most of the party, such at least as could leave their employment without a sharp reprimand from {{one or the other of}} the contending authorities, the Seneschal and the Squire, were gathered round the steps, where the armourer was displaying, with many an encomium, his bundles of lances, his real Toledo blades, and his helmets of the choicest fashion. Gaston d'Aubricour and Ralph were disputing respecting a certain suit of armour, which the latter disapproved, because it had no guards for the knees, while the former contended that the only use for such protections was to disable a man from walking, and nearly from standing when once unhorsed.|$|R
5000|$|The hammer {{represented}} {{the workers in}} the factories. The compass {{represented the}} intelligentsia, and the ring of rye the farmers. The first designs included only the <b>hammer</b> and <b>ring</b> of rye, {{as an expression of}} the GDR as a communist [...] "Workers' and Farmers' state" [...] (Arbeiter- und Bauernstaat). Surrounded by a wreath, the national emblem also acted as the emblem for the East German National People's Army, and when surrounded by a twelve pointed white star, for the People's Police.|$|R
60|$|And yet withal {{has there}} not been {{realised}} somewhat? Consider (to go no further) these strong Stone-edifices, {{and what they}} hold! Mud-Town of the Borderers (Lutetia Parisiorum or Barisiorum) has paved itself, has spread over all the Seine Islands, and far and wide on each bank, and become City of Paris, sometimes boasting to be 'Athens of Europe,' and even 'Capital of the Universe.' Stone towers frown aloft; long-lasting, grim with a thousand years. Cathedrals are there, and a Creed (or memory of a Creed) in them; Palaces, and a State and Law. Thou seest the Smoke-vapour; unextinguished Breath as of a thing living. Labour's thousand <b>hammers</b> <b>ring</b> on her anvils: also a more miraculous Labour works noiselessly, not with the Hand but with the Thought. How have cunning workmen in all crafts, with their cunning head and right-hand, tamed the Four Elements to be their ministers; yoking the winds to their Sea-chariot, making the very Stars their Nautical Timepiece;--and written and collected a Bibliotheque du Roi; among whose Books is the Hebrew Book! A wondrous race of creatures: these have been realised, and what of Skill is in these: call not the Past Time, with all its confused wretchednesses, a lost one.|$|R

Marshal François Achille Bazaine married on June 26, 1865, and Maximilian provided a dowry of two farms in Apaseo. The new government had seized and redistributed {{more than half}} of the old part of Apaseo: most properties had belonged to Liberals but the Mayorazgo Hacienda had belonged to Muñoz Ledo, a Conservative.|$|R

5000|$|Edward Henty was {{determined}} to continue with his settlement; his brother, Francis, had joined him in December 1834, and during {{the next five years}} other members of the family joined him, and gradually all of their horses, cattle and sheep were transferred from Tasmania. On 29 August 1836 the exploring party headed by Major Thomas Livingstone Mitchell reached Portland Bay and were amazed to find the country already colonised. In later years Edward Henty was fond of telling the story of Major Mitchell when he came to a hut, from which blows of a <b>hammer</b> <b>rang,</b> saying, [...] "Where is Mr Henty, my man," [...] and the reply of the burly blacksmith, [...] "Here he is at your service." [...] From Major Mitchell Henty learned the character of the land to the north, and gradually he was able to acquire more land. In 1845 he had over 70,000 acres (280 km²). Sometimes the price of wool and sheep fell very low and it was impossible to sell either to advantage; but over the years the stations prospered. In 1855 Edward Henty was elected a member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly for Normanby and was re-elected in 1859. He was defeated in 1861 and did not sit again in parliament. Henty's last years were spent in retirement at his Melbourne mansion 'Offington' and he died on 14 August 1878. In October 1840 he married Annie Maria Gallie who survived him. They had no children.|$|R
60|$|For instance, {{there was}} a bell found {{in one of the}} houses; but instead of being hollow, and having a clapper inside, as is the custom at the present day, it {{consisted}} simply of a large, flat ring, like a plate, with a hole through the centre of it. This ring was hung up by means of a short chain, and by the side of it there was hung a sort of <b>hammer.</b> To <b>ring</b> the bell it was necessary to strike it with this hammer. An attendant in the room did this while Mrs. Gray and Rollo were there, to let them hear how the bell sounded.|$|R
6000|$|With eyes {{singling}} out each familiar object I loitered along the walk. There stood the grimy wagon shop {{from which a}} <b>hammer</b> was <b>ringing</b> cheerily, like the chirp of a cricket,--just as aforetime. Orrin Blakey {{stood at the door}} of his lumber yard surveying me with curious eyes but I passed him in silence. I wished to spend an hour or two in going about in guise of a stranger. There was something instructive as well as deliciously exciting in thus seeing old acquaintances as from behind a mask. They were at once familiar and mysterious--mysterious with my new question, [...] "Is this life worth living?" ...|$|R
50|$|Striking train - This is a {{gear train}} (G,H) that scales down {{the force of the}} power source and transmits it to the <b>hammer</b> {{mechanism}} which <b>rings</b> the gong.
