5|$|The 1926 coup was a {{major event}} in interwar Lithuania; the {{dictatorship}} would go on for 14years. In 1935, the Smetona government outlawed the activities of all other political parties. The coup {{continues to be a}} <b>difficult</b> <b>issue</b> for Lithuanians, since the Soviet Union would go on to describe its subsequent occupation of Lithuania as a liberation from fascism. Encyclopædia Britannica, however, describes the regime as authoritarian and nationalistic rather than fascist. The coup's apologists have described it as a corrective to an extreme form of parliamentarianism, justifiable in light of Lithuania's political immaturity.|$|E

25|$|Infanticide in India, and {{elsewhere}} in the world, is a <b>difficult</b> <b>issue</b> to objectively access because reliable data is unavailable. Scrimshaw states that not only accurate frequency of female infanticide is unknown, differential care between male and female infants is even more elusive data. Reliable data for female infanticide is unavailable. Its frequency, and that of sex-selective abortion, is indirectly estimated from the observed high birth sex ratio; that is, the ratio of boys to girls at birth or 0–1 age group infants, or 0–6 age group child sex ratio. The natural ratio is assumed to be 106, or somewhere between 103 and 107, and any number above or below this range is considered as suggestive of female or male foeticide respectively.|$|E

25|$|During 1955 and 1956 UMNO, the MCA and the British {{hammered}} out a constitutional settlement for {{a principle of}} equal citizenship for all races. In exchange, the MCA agreed that Malaya’s head of state would {{be drawn from the}} ranks of the Malay Sultans, that Malay would be the official language, and that Malay education and economic development would be promoted and subsidised. In effect this meant that Malaya would be run by the Malays, particularly since they continued to dominate the civil service, the army and the police, but that the Chinese and Indians would have proportionate representation in the Cabinet and the parliament, would run those states where they were the majority, and would have their economic position protected. The <b>difficult</b> <b>issue</b> of who would control the education system was deferred until after independence. This came on 31 August 1957, when Tunku Abdul Rahman became the first Prime Minister of independent Malaya.|$|E
25|$|In all {{most any}} of the methods in {{simulation}} of ion channels, the major computational cost comes from the calculation of electrostatic forces acting on the ions. In continuum models, for instance, where ionic density exist rather than explicit ions, the electrostatic potential is calculated in a self-consistent manner by solving the Poisson equation. In MD simulations, on the other hand, the electrostatic forces acting on the particles are calculated by explicit evaluation of the Coulombic force term, often splitting the short-range and long-range electrostatic forces {{so they could be}} computed with different methods. In our model as a reduced particle method, the longrange electrostatic forces are evaluated by solving the Poisson equation and augmenting the forces so obtained with a short-range component. By solving the Poisson equation it is possible to self-consistently include the forces arising from the bias to the system, while this is a <b>difficult</b> <b>issue</b> to be addressed in MD simulations.|$|E
500|$|Instead {{of using}} the human {{characters}} in the show's cast, the writers and producers decided to use Muppets to present their narrative {{about the effects of}} divorce on young children. They chose to use the family of Mr. Snuffleupagus ("Snuffy"), a large Muppet that had been on the show since 1971. Long-time cast member Bob McGrath stated, [...] "They knew they couldn't do it with either of our married couples—Gordon and Susan or Maria and Luis—so they tried it with Snuffleupagus, writing a show about his parents getting divorced". According to Simon, [...] "With puppets, it's slightly less frightening... The kids have somebody to identify with. They see the puppet characters have feelings and work through a <b>difficult</b> <b>issue</b> many of them will have to face".|$|E

500|$|... "The F Word" [...] was {{especially}} controversial, even by South Park standards. In the episode, the South Park boys {{attempt to change}} the official definition of the word [...] "fag" [...] from an anti-homosexual slur to a term describing loud and obnoxious Harley bikers. The uncensored word is voiced casually and very frequently throughout the episode. A.V. Club critic Genevieve Koski argued that [...] "The F Word" [...] advocates a philosophy that language is ever-changing and that taboo words receive their stigma purely due to social circumstance. Although some LGBT activists accepted that the episode had noble intentions, the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation nevertheless objected to it, claiming that it still used [...] "fag" [...] {{as a means of}} insulting others and could be unintentionally harmful to the gay community. Some critics praised the episode and said it addressed an important and <b>difficult</b> <b>issue,</b> whereas others felt the satire was ineffective and unfunny.|$|E
500|$|... "The F Word" [...] was {{considered}} particularly controversial, even by South Park standards {{due to the}} excessive {{use of the word}} [...] "fag". The episode received generally mixed reviews. Carlos Delgado of iF magazine said [...] "The F Word" [...] marks a return of South Parks tradition of tackling sensitive social issues with intelligent and politically incorrect writing, which Delgado said had been lacking in recent episodes. Delgado said [...] "The F Word" [...] served as a reminder that society is always changing and that although the thoughts or intentions behind words are harmful, the word itself is not. Ramsey Isler of IGN compared [...] "The F Word" [...] to [...] "With Apologies to Jesse Jackson", an eleventh season episode that contained frequent use of the racial slur [...] "nigger". However, Isler said [...] "The F Word" [...] was not as skillfully crafted as the [...] "Jesse Jackson" [...] episode and, although some moments were entertaining, the episode [...] "had a habit of running some gags into the ground". James Hibberd, of The Live Feed, said he found the episode [...] "well-intended and funny", and that it forced viewers to face a <b>difficult</b> <b>issue</b> and reexamine their beliefs about it. Hibberd wrote, [...] "This is also, by the way, precisely what great art does". Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club said the word [...] "fag" [...] has not lost its associations with homosexuals, so she did not believe in the episode's statements about the changing use of the word. Koski also called the episode [...] "preachy", and said, [...] "It took too long to get going, seemed confused about what its point was, and, most egregiously, had very few laughs." ...|$|E

The treaty he negotiated was perceived by the public as too conciliatory to the Western powers, and created considerable controversy.

2500|$|Despite its flaws - legal {{historian}} Paul Finkelman describes Tucker's plan as [...] "simultaneously visionary, philanthropic, racist, vicious, utterly impractical, internally inconsistent, and hopelessly complex" [...] - modern scholars {{recognize the}} Dissertations significance {{as the first}} genuine effort by a Southerner to effect emancipation in his state. Finkelman notes that [...] "Tucker had the strength of character to explore the problem at least. He was a true academic intellectual who used his skills as a thinker and writer in an attempt, however futile, to stimulate a serious discussion {{about the problem of}} slavery in Virginia." [...] Historian Clyde N. Wilson says that [...] "(p)erhaps the most important things about Tucker's essay for later times are the following: it shows the potential in the South for constructively addressing the most <b>difficult</b> <b>issue</b> in American society before the time when it became necessary to defend against outside control; and, it demonstrates that Tucker's state rights understanding of the Constitution is not merely a rationalization in defense of slavery." ...|$|E
2500|$|A <b>difficult</b> <b>issue</b> {{that has}} arisen {{recently}} {{is the case}} where the defendant neither factually causes the harm, nor {{increases the risk of}} its occurrence. [...] In Chester v Afshar , a doctor negligently failed to warn a patient of risks inherent in an operation, specifically cauda equina syndrome. [...] The patient had the operation and a risk materialized causing injury. [...] It was found that even if the patient had been warned, the patient would still have undergone the operation, simply at a different time. [...] The risk of the injury would be the same at both times. [...] Accordingly, the doctor neither caused the injury (because but for the failure to warn, the patient would still have gone ahead with the operation), nor increased the risk of its occurrence (because the risk was the same either way). [...] Yet the House of Lords, embracing a more normative approach to causation, still held the doctor liable. [...] Lawyers and philosophers continue to debate whether and how this changes the state of the law.|$|E
