5|$|After George Jones died in 1891, Charles Ransom Miller raised $1million {{dollars to}} buy the Times, along with other fellow <b>editors</b> <b>at</b> the newspaper, {{printing}} it under the New York Times Publishing Company. However, the newspaper was financially crippled by the Panic of 1893. By 1896, The New York Times had a circulation of less than 9,000, and was losing $1,000 a day when controlling interest in it was gained by Adolph Ochs, publisher of the Chattanooga Times for $75,000.|$|E
5|$|Further details, {{including}} {{the matter of}} Sinar Harapan share of stock and the publisher, were decided at a meeting at Wanandi's office in March 1983. The next month, on 25 April, the first edition— totalling eight pages— was published. The first newsroom of the new paper were located in Kompas former laundry room, a one story warehouse; the first employees {{had to do the}} layout by hand, using pica poles as straight edges. During the first few months, the writers translated and recycled previously published stories from Indonesian media, which were later picked up by foreign wire services. Original reporting was rare as the <b>editors</b> <b>at</b> first did not want to deal with the censorship of Suharto's New Order government.|$|E

5|$|In October 1971, the {{journalist}} Numa Sadoul conducted a wide-ranging interview with Hergé, {{in which the}} latter opened up about {{many of the problems}} he had experienced in his personal life. Sadoul planned to publish the interview as a book, but Hergé made many alterations to the transcript, both to improve its prose and to remove sections which cast him in a negative light. <b>Editors</b> <b>at</b> Casterman then removed even further sections, particularly those in which Hergé expressed a negative view of Catholicism. The interview was published as Tintin et moi ("Tintin and I") in 1975. Hergé followed this by agreeing to be the subject of a documentary film produced by Henri Roane, Moi, Tintin ("I, Tintin"), which premiered in 1975.|$|E
5|$|In late 2008, Aamer Ahmed Khan of the BBC Urdu {{website and}} his colleagues {{came up with a}} novel way of {{covering}} the Taliban's growing influence in Swat. They decided to ask a schoolgirl to blog anonymously about her life there. Their correspondent in Peshawar, Abdul Hai Kakar, had been in touch with a local school teacher, Ziauddin Yousafzai, but could not find any students willing to do so, as it was considered too dangerous by their families. Finally, Yousafzai suggested his own daughter, 11-year-old Malala. At the time, Taliban militants led by Maulana Fazlullah were taking over the Swat Valley, banning television, music, girls' education, and women from going shopping. Bodies of beheaded policemen were being displayed in town squares. At first, a girl named Aisha from her father's school agreed to write a diary, but then the girl's parents stopped her from doing it because they feared Taliban reprisals. The only alternative was Yousafzai, four years younger than the original volunteer, and in seventh grade at the time. <b>Editors</b> <b>at</b> the BBC unanimously agreed.|$|E

Responding to {{the allegations}} of possible wrongdoing, in front of 400 Associated Press managing <b>editors</b> <b>at</b> Disney's Contemporary Resort on November 17, 1973, Nixon stated emphatically, “I’m not a crook.” He needed to allow Bork to appoint a new special prosecutor; Bork chose Leon Jaworski to continue the investigation.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, <b>editors</b> <b>at</b> DC Comics {{felt that}} its {{characters}} and their history had become convoluted and confusing to casual readers.

25|$|Hearst {{promoted}} {{writers and}} cartoonists {{despite the lack}} of any apparent demand for them by his readers. The press critic A. J. Liebling reminds us how many of Hearst's stars would not have been deemed employable elsewhere. One Hearst favorite, George Herriman, was the inventor of the dizzy comic strip Krazy Kat; not especially popular with either readers or <b>editors</b> <b>at</b> the time of its initial publication, it is now {{considered by many to be}} a classic, a belief once held only by Hearst himself.|$|E
25|$|Heinlein got {{the idea}} for the novel {{when he and his wife}} Virginia were {{brainstorming}} one evening in 1948. She suggested a new version of Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book (1894), but with a child raised by Martians instead of wolves. He decided to go further with the idea and worked on the story on and off for more than a decade. His <b>editors</b> <b>at</b> Putnam then required him to cut its 220,000-word length down to 160,067 words before publication. In 1962, it received the Hugo Award for Best Novel.|$|E
25|$|Less than a {{week before}} the 2006 elections, the Green Party shifted their stance on {{copyright}} reform. Additionally, both the Moderate Party and the Left Party changed their stances on internet downloads, and both prime ministerial candidates stated publicly that it shouldn't be illegal for young people to share files. Several influential analysts have credited the Pirate Party and its rising popularity for this shift in the political climate; these include a panel of senior <b>editors</b> <b>at</b> International Data Group and political analysts at the largest morning newspaper, Dagens Nyheter.|$|E

25|$|From 1900, Philippide {{joined the}} 26-man team of <b>editors</b> <b>at</b> Convorbiri Literare (a step in its ongoing {{transition}} from literary polemics to scientific publishing). In 1902, at Constantin Stere's urging, Philippide joined the anti-Junimist National Liberal Party, but retained amiable or even friendly ties to Junimea figures, particularly Maiorescu. In {{line with the}} latter's pronouncements, he was a critic of modern, bourgeois-created Romanian society. Although nearly as vehement in this regard as Eminescu, he approached the matter not from a political angle but based on the classical morality espoused in the Nicomachean Ethics.|$|E

It meant covering close to 100,000km across India using 16 forms of transportation, including walking 5,000km on foot. He credits two sympathetic <b>editors</b> <b>at</b> the Times with much of his success in getting the articles published in their present form, since it is one among the very newspapers that {{has been accused of}} shifting the onus from page one to page three. The paper ran 84 reports by Sainath across 18 months, many of them subsequently reprinted in his book, Everybody Loves A Good Drought.|$|E

25|$|Engadget Distro was {{a tablet}} {{magazine}} from the <b>editors</b> <b>at</b> Engadget {{that has been}} published {{on a weekly basis}} since its inception, although Special Issues have appeared at times and multiple issues per week are published during the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES). The magazine was born from Tim Stevens' desire to provide a different, distilled look at a week's worth of Engadget news, and to enable readers to enjoy that coverage without the frantic nature of the online experience being necessarily attached. The magazine was announced on September 20, 2011 and teased on that night's episode of The Engadget Show in New York City. It became available to the public on October 12, 2011, with the initial issues being available for Apple's iPad.

25|$|Hersh {{was born}} on April 8, 1937 in Chicago to Yiddish-speaking Lithuanian Jewish parents who emigrated to the US from Lithuania and Poland and ran a dry-cleaning shop in Chicago's Austin neighborhood. After graduating from the University of Chicago with a history degree, Hersh found himself {{struggling}} to find a job. He began working at Walgreens before being accepted into University of Chicago Law School but was soon expelled for poor grades. After returning {{for a short time}} to Walgreens, Hersh began his career in journalism as a police reporter for the City News Bureau in 1959. He later became a correspondent for United Press International in South Dakota. In 1963, he {{went on to become a}} Chicago and Washington correspondent for the Associated Press. While working in Washington Hersh first met and befriended I. F. Stone, whose I. F. Stone's Weekly would serve as an initial inspiration for Hersh's later work. It was during this time that Hersh began to form his investigative style, often walking out of regimented press briefings at the Pentagon and seeking out one-on-one interviews with high-ranking officers. After a falling out with the <b>editors</b> <b>at</b> the AP when they insisted on watering down a story about the US government's work on biological and chemical weapons, Hersh left the AP and sold his story to The New Republic. During the 1968 presidential election, he served as press secretary for the campaign of Senator Eugene McCarthy.|$|E
