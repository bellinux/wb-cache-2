5|$|Fossil Springs, {{the source}} of about 80percent {{of the water in}} Fossil Creek, issues from several vents in close {{proximity}} to one another {{at the base of the}} Mogollon Rim. The rim is the southern edge of the Colorado Plateau. Water percolating through limestone layers in the rim becomes laden with <b>dissolved</b> <b>carbon</b> dioxide and calcium carbonate. When the water emerges at the springs, it begins to release carbon dioxide as a gas and calcium carbonate as travertine, a porous form of calcite often found around hot springs such as Mammoth Hot Springs in Yellowstone National Park. The release, affected by stream turbulence and other factors, does not occur all at once but continues downstream.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{lead for}} water pipes is {{problematic}} {{in areas with}} soft or acidic water. Hard water forms insoluble layers in the pipes whereas soft and acidic water dissolves the lead pipes. <b>Dissolved</b> <b>carbon</b> dioxide in the carried water may result {{in the formation of}} soluble lead bicarbonate; oxygenated water may similarly dissolve lead as lead(II) hydroxide. Drinking such water, over time, can cause health problems due to the toxicity of the dissolved lead. The harder the water the more calcium bicarbonate and sulfate it will contain, and the more the inside of the pipes will be coated with a protective layer of lead carbonate or lead sulfate.|$|E
5|$|The oceans {{are home}} to a diverse {{collection}} of life forms that {{use it as a}} habitat. Since sunlight illuminates only the upper layers, the major part of the ocean exists in permanent darkness. As the different depth and temperature zones each provide habitat for a unique set of species, the marine environment as a whole encompasses an immense diversity of life. Marine habitats range from surface water to the deepest oceanic trenches, including coral reefs, kelp forests, seagrass meadows, tidepools, muddy, sandy and rocky seabeds, and the open pelagic zone. The organisms living in the sea range from whales 30 meters (100ft) long to microscopic phytoplankton and zooplankton, fungi, bacteria and viruses, including recently discovered marine bacteriophages which live parasitically inside bacteria. Marine life plays an important part in the carbon cycle as photosynthetic organisms convert <b>dissolved</b> <b>carbon</b> dioxide into organic carbon and it is economically important to humans for providing fish for use as food.|$|E

An everyday example is given by one's experience with carbonated soft drinks, which contain <b>dissolved</b> <b>carbon</b> dioxide. Before opening, the gas above the drink in its container is almost pure carbon dioxide, at a pressure higher than atmospheric pressure. After the bottle is opened, this gas escapes, moving the partial pressure of carbon dioxide above the liquid to be much lower, resulting in degassing as the <b>dissolved</b> <b>carbon</b> dioxide comes out of solution.|$|E

40|$|The {{transport}} of <b>dissolved</b> organic <b>carbon</b> from land to ocean {{is a large}} dynamic component of the global carbon cycle. Inland waters are hotspots for organic matter turnover, via both biological and photochemical processes, and mediate carbon transfer between land, oceans and atmosphere. However, predicting <b>dissolved</b> organic <b>carbon</b> reactivity remains problematic. Here we present in situ <b>dissolved</b> organic <b>carbon</b> budget data from 82 predominantly European and North American water bodies with varying nutrient concentrations and water residence times ranging from one week to 700 years. We find that trophic status strongly regulates whether water bodies act as net <b>dissolved</b> organic <b>carbon</b> sources or sinks, and that rates of both <b>dissolved</b> organic <b>carbon</b> production and consumption can be predicted from water residence time. Our results suggest a dominant role of rapid light-driven removal in water bodies with a short water residence time, whereas in water bodies with longer residence times, slower biotic production and consumption processes are dominant and counterbalance one another. Eutrophication caused lakes to transition from sinks to sources of <b>dissolved</b> organic <b>carbon.</b> We conclude that rates and locations of <b>dissolved</b> organic <b>carbon</b> processing and associated CO 2 emissions in inland waters may be misrepresented in global carbon budgets if temporal and spatial reactivity gradients are not accounted for...|$|R
25|$|Iron {{fertilization}} of {{the ocean}} could stimulate photosynthesis in phytoplankton (see Iron hypothesis). The phytoplankton would convert the ocean's <b>dissolved</b> <b>carbon</b> dioxide into carbohydrate and oxygen gas, some of which would sink into the deeper ocean before oxidizing. More than a dozen open-sea experiments confirmed that adding iron to the ocean increases photosynthesis in phytoplankton by up to 30 times. While this approach has been proposed as a potential solution to the ocean acidification problem, mitigation of surface ocean acidification might increase acidification in the less-inhabited deep ocean.|$|E
25|$|Together, the Subantarctic Mode Water (SAMW) and Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) act as {{a carbon}} sink, {{absorbing}} atmospheric carbon dioxide and storing it in solution. If the SAMW temperature increases {{as a result of}} climate change, the SAMW will have less capacity to store <b>dissolved</b> <b>carbon</b> dioxide. Research using a computerized climate system model suggests that if atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration were to increase to 860 ppm by the year 2100 (roughly double today's concentration), the SAMW will decrease in density and salinity. The resulting reductions in the subduction and transport capacity of SAMW and AAIW water masses could potentially decrease the absorption and storage of CO2 in the Southern Ocean.|$|E
25|$|Coke {{is a solid}} {{carbonaceous}} residue derived from coking coal (a low-ash, low-sulfur bituminous coal, also known as metallurgical coal), which is used in manufacturing steel and other iron products. Coke is made from coking coal by baking in an oven without oxygen at temperatures as high as 1,000°C (1,832°F), driving off the volatile constituents and fusing together the fixed carbon and residual ash. Metallurgical coke {{is used as a}} fuel and as a reducing agent in smelting iron ore in a blast furnace. The result is pig iron, and is too rich in <b>dissolved</b> <b>carbon,</b> so it must be treated further to make steel.|$|E
40|$|The {{increase}} in the penetration of ultraviolet radiation that has been reported lately for freshwater ecosystems in southern South America would allegedly generate alterations in ecological processes. In this respect the mortality of Parabroteas sarsi, a calanoid copepod distributed in South American lakes and ponds, was studied.

At high <b>dissolved</b> organic <b>carbon</b> concentration the mortality of P. sarsi increased at 24 h and stabilized at 48 and 72 h, whereas at low <b>dissolved</b> organic <b>carbon</b> concentration mortality increased linearly during the studied period. The results support both the description of a screen effect of <b>dissolved</b> organic <b>carbon</b> against ultraviolet radiation, and the potential photorepairing role of visible radiation that explains the increase of mortality in conditions of low <b>dissolved</b> organic <b>carbon</b> concentration...|$|R

25|$|The {{problem of}} mass-producing cheap steel was solved in 1855 by Henry Bessemer, with the {{introduction}} of the Bessemer converter at his steelworks in Sheffield, England. (An early converter can still be seen at the city's Kelham Island Museum). In the Bessemer process, molten pig iron from the blast furnace was charged into a large crucible, and then air was blown through the molten iron from below, igniting the <b>dissolved</b> <b>carbon</b> from the coke. As the carbon burned off, the melting point of the mixture increased, but the heat from the burning carbon provided the extra energy needed to keep the mixture molten. After the carbon content in the melt had dropped to the desired level, the air draft was cut off: a typical Bessemer converter could convert a 25-ton batch of pig iron to steel in half an hour.|$|E

Most hydrothermal circulation occurs on ridge flanks 1, 2, where low-temperature fluids flow through porous basalts.

Here, we report Δ 14 C and δ 13 C measurements of <b>dissolved</b> organic <b>carbon</b> in ridge-flank and on-axis hydrothermal fluids sampled from the Juan de Fuca Ridge. <b>Dissolved</b> organic <b>carbon</b> from two independent ridge-flank sites was characterized by low δ 13 C and Δ 14 C values.
