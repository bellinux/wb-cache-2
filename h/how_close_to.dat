5|$|Paterson's worms are {{an attempt}} to {{simulate}} the behaviour of prehistoric worms. These creatures fed upon sediment {{at the bottom of}} ponds and avoided retracing paths they had already travelled because food would be scarce there but, because food occurred in patches, it was in the worm's interest to stay near previous trails. Different species of worm had different innate rules regarding <b>how</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> travelled paths to stay, when to turn, and how sharp a turn to make. In 1969 Raup and Seilacher created computer simulations of the fossilized worm trails, and these simulations inspired Paterson and Conway to develop a simple set of rules to study idealized worms on regular grids.|$|E
5|$|The most {{familiar}} uses of diamonds today are as gemstones used for adornment, a use which dates back into antiquity, and as industrial abrasives for cutting hard materials. The dispersion of white light into spectral colors {{is the primary}} gemological characteristic of gem diamonds. In the 20th century, experts in gemology developed methods of grading diamonds and other gemstones based on the characteristics most important to their value as a gem. Four characteristics, known informally as the four Cs, are now commonly used as the basic descriptors of diamonds: these are carat (its weight), cut (quality of the cut is graded according to proportions, symmetry and polish), color (<b>how</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> white or colorless; for fancy diamonds how intense is its hue), and clarity (how free is it from inclusions). A large, flawless diamond {{is known as a}} paragon.|$|E

5|$|Why the Swedish fleet {{deviated}} {{from the original}} plan of engaging the allied force in home waters north of Öland has never been satisfactorily explained. According to Rosenberg and Gyllenspak on Kronan, Creutz made a turn because Uggla had signaled {{that he was going}} about. Rosenberg also believed that Bär on Nyckeln, admiral of the first squadron, was first to make a turn, and that Uggla considered it necessary to follow this unplanned maneuver to keep the fleet together. Officers Anders Homman and Olof Norman, who both survived Svärdet, claimed that only Creutz as fleet commander could have made such a decision and that Uggla was only following Kronans lead. Witnesses who testified before the commission claimed that conflict between the officers was the reason that necessary precautions were not taken before Kronan came about. Rosenberg testified that Lieutenant Admiral Arvid Björnram and Major Klas Ankarfjäll had openly disagreed on how much sail should be set and <b>how</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> land the ship should sail. According to Gyllenspak, senior fleet pilot Per Gabrielsson had voiced his concerns against turning in the rough weather, but no one had heeded his advice.|$|E
5|$|Whitney discovers she is {{pregnant}} by Lee, but all her hints {{and attempts to}} tell him fail. Linda realises and is ecstatic when Whitney confirms it. Linda tells Mick, and when Whitney tells Lee, Mick and Linda rush into the room to celebrate before {{he has a chance}} to let the news sink in. Whitney and Lee are both diagnosed with chlamydia and Whitney blames herself due to Rob. Abi admits to Whitney she had a one-night stand and gave Lee chlamydia. Whitney initially ends their relationship and considers leaving Walford, but later decides to give him another chance. Whitney is pleased when Ryan is released from prison and he tells her he is moving to Wakefield. He offers Whitney and Lee to move in with him and she accepts, but later declines when Linda strongly disapproves of them moving so far away. Whitney and Ryan share an emotional farewell. Whitney suffers spotting and is taken to hospital with Lee, Linda and Mick, where the bleeeding gets heavier. A scan shows Whitney has miscarried her baby, devastating her and Lee. Lauren encourages Whitney to find out whether she lost their baby due to him giving her chlamydia and she confides in Johnny (now Ted Reilly) that chlamydia might have caused it but tells Lee that the doctors said it could not have. Whitney decides to go Milton Keynes to stay with Bianca but returns the next day with Bianca's wedding dress and intends to get married. She reassures everyone she is fine and is thrown another hen party. Whitney marries Lee with Stacey acting as maid of honour in place of an ill Lauren and Tiffany and Lily as bridesmaids. Whitney is disappointed to learn that Lee was behind the robbery at The Vic but is unaware <b>how</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> suicide he was. She argues with Lee over money and Danny Mitchell (Liam Bergin) who tries to kiss her. Whitney then turns to Mick for support, and sleeps at The Vic. The next day she is reconciled with an apologetic Lee but finds his wage slip showing how little he earns. Following another argument with Lee, Whitney confides in Mick, telling him she is going to buy Ryan an engagement present. Later, a bus crashes into the market and Whitney is trapped underneath it. Whitney is rescued and in hospital, she talks to Mick about her marriage. He comforts her and she kisses him, which is seen by Denise Fox (Diane Parish). Whitney decides to organise a night out and pawns her wedding ring for cash. Lee discovers what she has done and they start arguing. When Whitney says he doesn't deserve her, Lee slaps her in the face. Shortly after the incident Whitney lays on the bed in silence, with Lee begging for forgiveness. Whitney confides in Lauren who strongly advises her to leave Lee.|$|E

25|$|In 1965, in {{response}} to stepped up military activity by the Viet Cong in South Vietnam and their North Vietnamese allies, the U.S. began bombing North Vietnam, deployed large military forces and entered into combat in South Vietnam. McNamara's plan, supported by requests from top U.S. military commanders in Vietnam, led to the commitment of 485,000 troops {{by the end of}} 1967 and almost 535,000 by June 30, 1968. The casualty lists mounted as the number of troops and the intensity of fighting escalated. McNamara put in place a statistical strategy for victory in Vietnam. He concluded that there were a limited number of Viet Cong fighters in Vietnam and that a war of attrition would destroy them. He applied metrics (body counts) to determine <b>how</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> success his plan was.|$|E
25|$|In {{the months}} to come he was {{reported}} to be on the wish lists of many top European clubs; his former All Black's teammate Andrew Mehrtens was forced to publicly deny rumours that Umaga was a target of his club at the time – Harlequins. Umaga eventually signed for French club Toulon that had been recently relegated from the Top 14 to Pro D2. His contract allowed him to play the entire 2006 Air New Zealand Cup (ANZ Cup) season for Wellington before travelling to France. He ended up playing only seven matches for Toulon as Wellington made the ANZ Cup final. He nonetheless made roughly €350,000 (US$438,000/GBP 250,000) that Toulon's co-presidents reportedly paid out of their own pockets. The day before playing his first match for Toulon he was awarded the medal of honour of the city of Toulon (médaille d'or de la ville) by Mayor Hubert Falco. On 29 October 2006, Umaga started in his first game three days after arriving in Toulon scoring his team's only try in a 22–16 victory against Lyon. He was surprised to see <b>how</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the players the fans were and how noisy the atmosphere was.|$|E
25|$|Male Banggai {{cardinalfish}} also exhibit preference by size, as larger females tend to lay larger eggs, and egg size positively affects traits such as offspring size, survival, growth, {{time until}} maturation, and swimming performance. However, {{it also takes}} into account information conveyed by females’ courting movement. The ‘side by side trembling’ described {{in the previous section}} can be subcategorized into two different movements: ‘rush’ and ‘twitch’. ‘Rush’ refers to {{the first part of the}} movement when the females approaches the male, folding the pelvic, dorsal and anal fins together and quickly swimming past the male for a distance of 10-40 centimeters. Then it performs the ‘twitch’, where it twitches, or trembles her body close to the male. Studies have shown that the intensity of the ‘rush’ behavior is important for the male in predicting the female’s potential reproductive effort, as the intensity of the behavior correlates positively with clutch weight. On the other hand, the number of twitches performed per day strongly associates with <b>how</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> spawning the female is. By forming a pair with a female with more mature eggs, or closer to spawning, a male can increase his reproductive rate. Furthermore, it can match his readiness to spawn to females’ by observing its ‘twitch’ behavior.|$|E

25|$|Although Angie {{tries to}} stop drinking, her {{attempts}} always fail dismally {{and by the}} end of the year she is arrested for drink-driving when she crashes Den's car on the way home from a darts match. In episodes broadcast in 1986, Den's mistress, Jan, starts to frequent The Queen Vic. The physical arrival of Jan sends Angie's marriage into further decline as she is unable to contain her jealousy and anger. Angie becomes so depressed that she takes a near lethal cocktail of booze and pills in an attempted suicide. By chance, Den returns home early following an argument with Jan, discovers Angie and rushes her to the hospital where she has her stomach pumped. Angie recovers, but is left shaken when she discovers <b>how</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> death she actually came. Upon recovering, Angie decides to play Den at his own game and so she begins another affair with Andy O'Brien (Ross Davidson). Den is furious when he discovers them in bed together, but his rage is short-lived as he has more pressing things on his mind, such as the birth of his illegitimate daughter, Vicki Fowler (Emma Herry). Angie's affair with Andy only lasts a month, ending when Andy reunites with his ex-girlfriend Debbie Wilkins (Shirley Cheriton). Andy dies in a road accident shortly afterwards.|$|E

Under the Twelve Tables, death or flogging could be expected for a manifest thief, later changed to damages of four times the thing. The penalty for non-manifest theft was two times. There were complementary actions against the occupier of the property where the stolen goods were found, if the defendant did not bring the thing to court or refused a search. Vindicatio or condictio could also be undertaken by the owner of the thing, in addition to an action under furtum.|$|E

500|$|Beginning in Gather Together, {{motherhood}} and family issues are important themes throughout Angelou's autobiographies.

Vivian Baxter cares for Rita's young son as Rita attempts to make a living. Critic Mary Jane Lupton states that [...] "one gets a strong sense throughout Gather Together of [...] dependence on her mother". Critic Lyman B. Hagen remarks that Angelou's relationship with her mother becomes more important in Gather Together, and that Vivian is now more influential in the development of Angelou's attitudes. Lupton calls Clyde's kidnapping a [...] "powerful sequence of mother-loss" [...] and connects it to the kidnapping of Clyde's son in the 1980s. Angelou has compared the production of this book to giving birth, an apt metaphor given the birth of her son at the end of Caged Bird. Like many authors, Angelou views the creative writing process and its results as her children.|$|E

2500|$|As {{an example}} of the {{physical}} meaning of RG in particle physics, [...] consider an overview of charge renormalization in quantum electrodynamics (QED). Suppose we have a point positive charge of a certain true (or bare) magnitude. The electromagnetic field around it has a certain energy, and thus may produce some pairs of (e.g.) electrons-positrons, which will be annihilated very quickly. But, in their short life, the electron will be attracted by the charge, and the positron will be repelled. Since this happens continuously, these pairs are effectively screening the charge from abroad. Thus, the measured strength of the charge will depend on <b>how</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> our probes it may enter. Hence a dependence of a certain coupling constant (here, the electric charge) with distance scale.|$|E
2500|$|Earthquakes in California {{are common}} occurrences since {{the state is}} traversed by six major strike-slip fault systems with {{hundreds}} of related faults, {{many of which are}} [...] "sister faults" [...] of the infamous San Andreas Fault that runs nearly the full length of California at the juncture of the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate. The fault systems include the Hayward Fault Zone, Calaveras Fault, Clayton-Marsh Creek-Greenville Fault, and the San Gregorio Fault. Significant blind thrust faults (faults with near vertical motion and no surface ruptures) are associated with portions of the Santa Cruz Mountains and the northern reaches of the Diablo Range and Mount Diablo. The California earthquake forecast gives a rough estimate of where the main earthquake zones in California are. Earthquake damage depends on what area is hit, <b>how</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the surface the center of the earthquake is located, and its magnitude. Earthquake damage, for a given magnitude earthquake, to human structures depends on how well the buildings are built and what the structures are located on. Buildings on soft or filled-in soil suffer the most because they feel shock waves most strongly. Buildings on bedrock suffer less damage because the ground is firmer. Sometimes the ensuing fires, floods or tsunamis caused by the earthquake are often where the greatest damage occurs.|$|E
