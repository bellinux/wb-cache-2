5|$|Ian Chappell … always sweated on my blunders and {{reported}} {{them with an}} 'I told you so' mentality... To say Chappell's criticism irked me would be an understatement, though I knew that, like anyone, he was entitled to an opinion. I don't mind the fact he criticised me — in <b>fact,</b> <b>I</b> would much rather someone make a judgement than not, but I have always felt that a critic must be either constructive or base his comments on fact... It was something I had to live with, and when I realised he {{was never going to}} cut me much slack, I decided anything he said that was positive would be a bonus and the rest just cast aside.|$|E
5|$|I don't {{see much}} {{difference}} between a communist regime and a fascist regime. In <b>fact,</b> <b>I</b> {{think one of the}} greatest intellectual confusions that many have had over these decades is the whole right and left thing -- fascists are on the right, communists are on the left. Nonsense! They come together and overlap, and we're seeing this in Russia today where the allies are the nationalistic chauvinists and the communists. They are natural allies because they are authoritarians by nature. And more than authoritarians, they tend to be totalitarians, which means that they tend to destroy all of the elements of the civil society. To me that's much more important than whether you're philosophically right or left. You know, are you willing to create and live in a civil society, in an open society, or not? That to me is the basic issue.|$|E

25|$|The {{statement}} “I’m {{a believer}} in social Darwinism,” {{did not come from}} me. In <b>fact,</b> <b>I</b> had to look up the expression to learn what was being referred to. This attack appears to be calling me a Nazi, nothing less. I demand that Mr. Storr refer me to the original sources to which we assume he has referred. Until then, I’ll only say that he has carefully selected phrases and statements out of context, not the sort of referencing that I would have expected from him.|$|E
25|$|In August 2009, after {{spending}} some time presenting on RTÉ Radio 1, {{it was announced that}} Fanning would be returning to RTÉ 2fm to present his evening weekday show in his old 19:00 slot. The return followed the failure by RTÉ 2fm in its attempts to target teenagers. Fanning claimed: In <b>fact</b> <b>I</b> so never moved that instead I brought the four people who were working with me for Radio One and their desks into 2FM! I never went over to Radio One, I did all my programmes from 2FM, I never moved. I was also doing 2FM every Sunday so I never left at all so I'm just back to my spiritual home Monday to Friday.|$|E
25|$|The {{dropping}} of McCosker angered Ian Chappell and {{his teammates}} and I copped the brunt of it. I {{may have been an}} unassuming guy at the time, but I was rudely awakened to the facts of life at test level – thanks, or rather no thanks to Chappell {{and the rest of the}} team. I was not exactly welcomed with open arms into the team. In <b>fact,</b> <b>I</b> was lucky to discover my locker in the Australian dressing rooms. To top it off, Chappell figured that if I was selected to replace McCosker, that's exactly what I would do... at Number 3. I suppose you could say it was an honour to bat ahead of Ian and Greg Chappell in a test. But I have no doubts that certain members of that team wanted me to fail and therefore prove that the selectors had erred. Normally, a new batsman could expect to be cradled into the side and be 'hidden' down the order until he gets the feel of the test atmosphere. There was no such deal for me. I was thrown into the deep end, to sink or swim, and that will live in my memory forever. While I am captain of a team, no batsman will be given the shoddy treatment I received on my test debut.|$|E

"This is {{not very}} {{encouraging}} to a new beginner in the occupation of a landlord," [...] I answered; [...] "and, when I look into the <b>facts,</b> <b>I</b> confess, I am surprised that so many gentlemen in the colony are willing to invest the sums they annually do in wild lands." ...|$|R

[...] In a 1998 interview, Ivey stated [...] "I'm kind of wary of the Church. I know there's this whole Christian music market, but I don't think, theology-wise, I'm in agreement with {{a whole lot of}} Christians. [...] In <b>fact,</b> <b>I</b> don't know whether I like even being called a Christian." ...|$|E

In <b>fact,</b> <b>I</b> hate anyone that ever had a pony when they were growing up.MANYA: (angry) I had a pony.(The room goes dead quiet.)JERRY: Well, I didn't, uh, really mean a pony, per se...MANYA: When I {{was a little girl}} in Poland, we all had ponies.

500|$|In mid-2007, Hornish drove Penske's No. 27 Dodge Charger in an ARCA Re/Max Series race at Michigan International Speedway. Starting in {{the pole}} position, {{he led the}} first 29 laps of the race before being passed by {{eventual}} winner Erik Darnell and finishing second. After the race, he called the transition to stock cars a [...] "challenge": [...] "I'm a student at this, still trying {{to learn as much}} as I can. A lot of people have asked me what the toughest transition is, coming over here from the IndyCars and doing these stock car races, and really it's the <b>fact</b> <b>I</b> don't get much practice time." ...|$|E

500|$|The Waugh family {{connection}} with Midsomer Norton began when Dr Alexander Waugh, father of Arthur Waugh and grandfather of Evelyn Waugh and Alec Waugh moved to Island House, {{which had been}} built in the early 18th century, in The Island in the centre of the town in 1865. The family later moved to a house in Silver Street. As a boy, Evelyn Waugh spent his summer holidays in Midsomer Norton with his maiden aunts. He later described his visits there: “I suppose that in <b>fact</b> <b>I</b> never spent longer than two months there in any year, but the place captivated my imagination as my true home never did.” ...|$|E
500|$|Writing in 1986, Danny Peary noted, [...] "It's hard {{to believe}} that in 1967 we {{actually}} waited in anticipation for this so-called James Bond spoof. It was a disappointment then; it's a curio today, but just as hard to get through." [...] Peary described the film as being [...] "disjointed and stylistically erratic" [...] and [...] "a testament to wastefulness in the bigger-is-better cinema," [...] before adding, [...] "It would have been a good idea to cut the picture drastically, perhaps down to the scenes featuring Peter Sellers and Woody Allen. In <b>fact,</b> <b>I</b> recommend you see it on television when it's in a two-hour (including commercials) slot. Then you won't expect it to make any sense." ...|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert {{began his}} review of Election by noting, [...] "I {{remember}} students like Tracy Flick, the know-it-all who always has {{her hand in the}} air, while the teacher desperately looks for someone else to call on. In <b>fact,</b> <b>I</b> was a student like Tracy Flick." [...] He goes on to compare Tracy to Elizabeth Dole: [...] "a person who always seems to be presenting you with a logical puzzle for which she is the answer... She is always perfectly dressed and groomed, and is usually able to conceal her hot temper behind a facade of maddening cheerfulness. But she is ruthless. She reminds me of a saying attributed to David Merrick: 'It is not enough for me to win. My enemies must lose.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Such are the <b>facts,</b> <b>I</b> believe. Do you {{not think}} it creditable to him, Mr. Littlepage, that one so situated, should come so far to serve his king and country, in a rude war like this of our colonies?" ...|$|R
60|$|These are {{the chief}} facts, this the {{immediate}} conclusion from them to which I adverted in {{the commencement of}} this Essay. The <b>facts,</b> <b>I</b> believe, cannot be disputed; and if so, the conclusion appears {{to me to be}} inevitable.|$|R

500|$|Until now, Cardinale's {{own voice}} {{had not been}} used in her Italian films, as it was {{considered}} too hoarse, and owing to [...] her French accent, insufficiently Italian. Not until 8½ was she allowed to use her own voice. Cardinale explained: [...] "When I arrived for my first movie, I couldn't speak a word. I thought I was on the moon. I couldn't understand {{what they were talking}} about. And I was speaking in French; in <b>fact</b> <b>I</b> was dubbed. And Federico Fellini was the first one who used my voice. I think I had a very strange voice." [...] With her portrayal of Angelica in The Leopard and her brief appearance as herself in 8½, Cardinale achieved the definitive status of a top-ranking star.|$|E
500|$|... was {{in trouble}} at that time {{because she had a}} couple of engagements that she didn't keep up. But what people didn't realise at that time, that she really knew, and in <b>fact</b> <b>I</b> didn't even know it when we were making the record, and now looking at the whole thing; she knew that she was in a lot of trouble; that she wasn't going to live. And it wasn't drugs. It was alcohol toward the end... It was such a sad thing because... she was the only singer that really sang what I call the 'right way' because she was a great jazz-pop singer... She was really a great jazz singer. A true jazz singer. And I regret that because that's the 'right way' to sing.|$|E
500|$|In 2000 Apple Records {{released}} a thirtieth anniversary {{edition of the}} album and Harrison actively participated in its promotion, giving an interview during which he reflected on the work: [...] "It's just something that was like my continuation from the Beatles, really. It was me sort {{of getting out of}} the Beatles and just going my own way... it was a very happy occasion." [...] He commented on the production: [...] "Well, in those days it was like the reverb was kind of used a bit more than what I would do now. In <b>fact,</b> <b>I</b> don't use reverb at all. I can't stand it... You know, it's hard to go back to anything thirty years later and expect it to be how you would want it now." ...|$|E
