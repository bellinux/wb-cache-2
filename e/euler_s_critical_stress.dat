40|$|Sulfide stress {{cracking}} (SSC) behavior of three microstructures, i. e., ferritic-pearlitic microstructure, ultrafine ferrite microstructure, and acicular ferrite dominated microstructure, was investigated using the bent-beam test in aqueous hydrogen sulfide (H 2 <b>S)</b> environments. The <b>critical</b> <b>stress</b> (Sc) values {{of these three}} microstructures were determined experimentally to be 1008, 1190, and more than 1260 MPa, respectively. As a result, the acicular ferrite-dominated microstructure possessed the best SSC resistance, the ultrafine ferrite microstructure was in a second position, and the ferritic-pearlitic microstructure was relatively the worst. It was analyzed that hydrogen embrittlement (HE) was the main failure mechanism in SSC cracking for high-strength pipeline steels, and preferential hydrogen accumulation within the plastic zone of the main crack tip accounted for the exhibited embrittlement. It was remarkable that the strength values of pipeline steels {{were not the only}} factor to determine their SSC susceptibilities. Microstructure {{played an important role in}} the SSC initiation and propagation of pipeline steels. In particular, both the fine dispersed precipitations of carbonitrides and the high-density tangled dislocations in acicular ferrite, which behaved as the hydrogen traps, should be attributed to the optimal SSC resistance of pipeline steels...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{resistance}} of plate girders stiffened with one sided rectangular longitudinal stiffeners under compression and bending, determined {{according to the rules}} given in EN 1993 - 1 - 5. It presents the rules for determination of plate buckling effects due to direct stresses. Compression and bending resistance was calculated {{for a wide range of}} cross sections, using the computer program EXCEL, and the effects of different parameters were studied. The parameters investigated were: the location of the stiffener, the slenderness of the plate, the plate aspect ratio, the stiffener to plate area ratio, the flange to web area ratio, the steel grade and the web height. Separate calculations were made for three different cases: I-girder stiffened with one or two longitudinal stiffeners under bending and plate stiffened with n longitudinal stiffeners under compression. In EN 1993 - 1 - 5 the effects of plate buckling are taken into account by effective cross sectional areas, determined by reduction factors which depend on elastic <b>critical</b> buckling <b>stresses.</b> Calculation of <b>critical</b> <b>stresses</b> is based on simplified models which may have limited applicability.

40|$|Pseudoelastic {{behaviour}} {{of three}} types of Ti–Ni shape memory alloys in a pseudoelastic state has been studied under conditions of maximum strain- and maximum stress-controlled cycling. Experimental results proved that residual deformation after unloading increases {{with the number of}} cycles; however, <b>critical</b> <b>stress</b> for the induction of martensite and the energy dissipated in one cycle decline during cycling. A higher <b>critical</b> <b>stress</b> for slip, and more intense cyclic dislocation hardening promoted by greater maximum deformation and greater maximum applied stresses, generally reduce the rate at which residual elongation grows with the number of cycles, and tend to stabilise the cyclic stress-elongation diagrams. The small magnitude of <b>critical</b> <b>stress</b> for slip in lownickel alloys, and also cyclic strain hardening, induce greater internal stresses and a more marked decrease in <b>critical</b> <b>stress</b> for the induction of martensite as cycling progresses. Detailed analysis of plastic deformation propagation in cyclically loaded specimen helped develop a model of dependence of residual elongation on the number of cycles. This model enables identification of three main factors that govern the magnitude of residual elongation: one residual plastic elongation caused by dislocation hardening after the alloy is heat treated, and two cyclic strain hardening parameters describing how residual elongation grows with number of cycles, and how this residual elongation is reduced, as cycles increase, by the rising <b>critical</b> <b>stress</b> level for slip.
