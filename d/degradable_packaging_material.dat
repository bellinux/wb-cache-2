The effects of precipitated silica loading {{and the specific}} surface area (SBET) on the apparent density and the static compressive strength of cushioning <b>packaging</b> <b>materials</b> were investigated. Meanwhile, the microstructure and morphology {{of different types of}} silica fillers were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy(SEM). Static compressive strength of BPCPMs was improved significantly with the addition of 0. 5 %(w/w) silica. However, the compressive stress of BPCPMs increased at first and then decreased with increasing loading of silica. Increasing silica dosage increased cushion efficiency of BPCPMs at higher stress levels. The compressive stress increased with increasing SBET value, and under high strain conditions, the increase scale in compressive stress also improved...|$|R

40|$|Active {{nanocomposite}} films {{based on}} poly(lactic acid) (PLA), thymol and silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) were prepared and characterized. PLA films containing 6 and 8 wt% thymol and 1 wt% Ag-NPs were processed by extrusion to obtain binary and ternary formulations. The addition of thymol and Ag-NPs modified the PLA thermal, optical and barrier properties; in particular water vapour permeability (WVP), maintaining oxygen transmission rate (OTR) values unchanged. Homogeneous surfaces in all films were obtained as proved by FESEM micrographs. The {{presence of the}} active additives enhanced the disintegration rate of PLA under composting conditions, which was completed in 14 days. Results suggest that these nanocomposite films could be considered promising <b>degradable</b> active <b>packaging</b> <b>materials</b> with low environmental impact.

40|$|Consumer {{awareness}} of the environment and preference for more environmentally benign products appears to be growing steadily around the developed world and also some developing countries.  The Malaysian government too has responded very positively to this challenge. In 1996 Standards and Industrial Research Institute of Malaysia (SIRIM) lunched the national eco-labeling program verifying products according to environmental criteria such as Environmentally <b>Degradable,</b> Non-toxic Plastic <b>Packaging</b> <b>Material,</b> Hazardous Metal-Free Electrical and Electronic Equipment, Biodegradable Cleaning Agents and Recycled Paper. Federal Agriculture Marketing Authority (FAMA) has the Malaysia Best logo for environment friendly agriculture product and the Malaysian Energy Commission for energy efficient electrical products. But is the Malaysia consumer ready for the eco-label? Taking into consideration the infancy stage of the Malaysia green marketing initiative, traditional approach to evaluating local consumer receptiveness to the eco-label might not be suitable. This paper approaches the introduction of eco-label with two perspectives in mind. Firstly, while earlier studies from the western scholars use eco-label {{as a part of the}} augmented product, this study introduces eco-label as a separate moderating variable. Secondly, the choice of employees working in ISO 14001 certified organization as the study population explore a potentially conducive place to initiate a systematic effort in developing a green consumer community. The result is very encouraging. This study has clearly shown that, with some exposure to environmental related experiences (such as those who were working with organization implementing the EMS) Malaysian consumer would indeed react positively to the eco-label. In fact, for situation that requires them to consider environmental aspects of a product that they wish to purchase, the eco-label will definitely be the crucial factor that will push them to make the right purchase choice...|$|R

40|$|Packaging waste forms a {{significant}} part of municipal solid waste and as such has caused increasing environmental concerns, resulting in strengthening of EU Regulations in order to reduce amounts of packaging waste. Among other materials, a huge range of oil-based polymers is currently used in packaging applications. They are largely non-biodegradable and particularly difficult to recycle or reuse due to mixed levels of contamination and complex composites. In recent years, the development of biodegradable <b>packaging</b> <b>materials</b> from renewable natural resources (e. g. crops) has received increasing attention, particularly in EU countries. Significant progress has been made to produce biodegradable materials with similar functionality to that of the oil-based synthetic polymers. It is anticipated that, as the materials are from renewable resources and biodegradable, they would contribute to sustainable development and if properly managed would reduce their environmental impact upon disposal. This paper discusses the potential impact of biodegradable <b>packaging</b> <b>materials</b> on waste management in terms of landfill, incineration, recycle/reuse and composting. A comparison is also drawn to the oil-based polymer <b>packaging</b> <b>materials.</b> It is the view of the authors that biodegradable <b>packaging</b> <b>materials</b> are most suitable for single use disposable packaging applications where the post-consumer use packaging can be locally composted as a means of recycling the materials.
