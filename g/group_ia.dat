40|$|Abstract Background Polydrug {{abuse is}} a known problem among opioid-dependent {{patients}} receiving opioid maintenance treatment (OMT). However, improved laboratory diagnostics {{is required to}} reveal polydrug abuse in its current scope. Furthermore, there are few studies focusing {{on the relationship between}} polydrug abuse and adequacy of the dose of OMT medicine. This study aimed to evaluate the polydrug abuse among opioid-dependent patients receiving OMT with inadequate (<b>Group</b> <b>IA)</b> and adequate (Group A) doses of OMT medicine as experienced by the patients. Craving for opioids and withdrawal symptoms were evaluated as indicators of the adequacy rating. Methods This is a retrospective register-based study of 60 OMT patients on either methadone or sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone medication, whose polydrug abuse was studied from urine samples by means of a comprehensive high-resolution mass spectrometry method. Results Inadequate doses of the OMT medicines were associated with higher subjective withdrawal scores and craving for opioids. Six groups of abused substances (benzodiazepines, amphetamines, opioids, cannabis, new psychoactive substances, and non-prescribed psychotropic medicines) were found among OMT patients. <b>Group</b> <b>IA</b> patients showed significantly more abuse of benzodiazepines and amphetamines than the Group A patients. All the new psychoactive substances and most of the non-prescribed psychotropic medicines were detected from the <b>Group</b> <b>IA</b> patients.

40|$|Summary: Carica papaya bark has {{contraceptive}} benefits {{when given}} {{at a high}} dose in male rats the mechanism at which it achieves this {{is yet to be}} fully understood. Forty male Wistar rats were used for the study. They were randomized into 8 <b>groups</b> <b>Ia,</b> IIa, IIIa, Ib, IIb, IIIb, IV and V respectively (n= 5). Groups Ia-IIIa and Ib-IIIb were treated for 4 and 8 weeks with Carica papaya bark extract at doses 50 and 100 mg ml - 1 day - 1 comparing to 2 - 5 ml distilled water baseline control. Group IV rats were observed for reversibility treated with alternating bark extract and distilled water for 16 weeks (8 weeks each). They were compared to Group V treated with distilled water alone for similar duration. The rats were sacrificed under chloroform anesthesia. The estimated parameters were testes volumes biochemical activities of testicular antioxidant enzymes and non-enzymes [superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), reduced glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) ] as well as total protein (TP). The extract treated <b>groups</b> (<b>Groups</b> <b>Ia,</b> IIa, Ib & IIb) showed a decrease in TP and testicular volume. Also in these groups were significant increases in testicular MDA levels compared to control (Groups IIIa & IIIb). At both durations for the two doses, the extract resulted in a significant decrease in antioxidant enzymes. Animals in the reversibility study group showed values similar to baseline control. In conclusion, Carica papaya leaf extract essentially perturbed the testicular oxidative system this may be responsible for the contraceptive effect seen. Industrial relevance: T he contraceptive benefits of aqueous extract of Carica papaya bark in orally treated male rats had been confirmed. This present study was tailored at reviewing variations in the gonadal proteins and stressors index in male rats administered established contraceptive doses of the extract. This would be helpful to industries intending to develop this herbal preparation as a contraceptive adjunct because it provides base line biochemical information on the testes that explains the likely possible mechanism of action of the herb. </p...|$|R
40|$|Purpose of the studyto {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} the mechanism of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) on the incidence of spontaneous atrial fibrillation (AF). The relation between SVT and AF is well-known but its frequency could depend on the mechanism of SVT. Methods 1559 patients, mean age 49 ± 19 years, with SVT and without anterograde conduction over an accessory pathway (AP) were referred for electrophysiological study (EPS), performed in control state and after isoproterenol. ResultsSVT was related to atrioventricular nodal re-entrant tachycardia (AVNRT) in 1262 patients (group I), either typical (n= 1180) (<b>group</b> <b>IA)</b> or atypical (n= 183) (group IB). In 297 patients SVT was related to atrioventric-ular re-entrant tachycardia (AVRT) due to a concealed AP (group II). At the initial evaluation 47 group I patients (4 %) (44 of <b>group</b> <b>IA,</b> 4 %, 3 of group IB, 2 %), 6 of group II (2 %) had presented at least one episode of sustained AF (NS). During follow-up (mean 3 ± 2 years), 97 patients developed AF, 86 of group I (7 %) (71 of <b>group</b> <b>IA,</b> 6 %, 15 of group IB, 8 %), 11 of group II (4 %). AF risk was higher in group I than in group II (p< 0. 045); differences remain significant for group IA/IB. When patients with AF at first study were excluded AF risk was similar in all groups: 5 % of group I) (4 % of group IA; 6. 5 % of group IB) (0. 06) and 3 % of group II. Ablation of slow pathway/AP was performed in 1099 patients, 67 % of group I (69 % of <b>group</b> <b>IA,</b> 51 % of group IB), 64 % of group II (NS). AF risk was paradoxically higher in patients in whom ablation was performed in group I (6. 7 % in group I, 7 % in <b>group</b> <b>IA,</b> 13 % in group IB), compared to patients without ablation (4 % in group I, 4 % in <b>group</b> <b>IA,</b> 3 % in group IB) (p< 0. 022) and was unchanged in group II (4 % after ablation and 3 % in patients without ablation). ConclusionsAF-related SVT was rare (3 %), independent on the mechanism of SVT. The risk of subsequent AF after a follow-up of 3 years increased to 6 % and was near 5 % in patients without AF at initial evaluation; it was only higher in patients with atypical AVNRT than in patients with AVRT.

This study was undertaken in severe asthma patients underwent omalizumab treatment, in order to investigate the relationship between biomarker expression and disease characteristics related to the immune system. Methods: Consecutive patients with severe asthma disease (n= 15; <b>Group</b> <b>IA,</b> pretreatment and Group IB, post-treatment) underwent omalizumab treatment. Control group was age- and sex-matched including 25 healthy in Group II. Blood samples from both the groups were taken during their first visit (<b>Group</b> <b>IA</b> and II) and then after 12 months of treatment in asthmatic patients (Group IB). Serum levels of homocysteine (Hcy), eosinophil cationic peptide (ECP), 25 -hydroxyvitamin D (25 (OH) D), interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β), soluble OX 2 (sCD 200) and clinical follow-up tests including fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), asthma control test (ACT), and pulmonary function tests were evaluated. Results: After the treatment, 25 (OH) D levels and pulmonary function tests, including forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) levels, were significantly increased. Furthermore, total immunoglobulin E (IgE), Hcy, ECP, FeNO, and sCD 200 levels were dramatically diminished. Regression analysis revealed positive correlations between ACT-FEV 1 and ACT- FVC and between FeNO-age and FeNO-ECP for <b>Group</b> <b>IA</b> patients.

We found a cation-binding area that influences the enzyme activity if occupied, so that the catalytic reaction may be altered by some physiologically relevant cations, such as Ca 2 + and K+. This binding area appears to be localized inside the enzyme active site, because some of these cations act as competitive inhibitors when highly charged amines, such as spermine and spermidine, are used as substrates. In particular, dissociation constant values (Kd) of 23 and 27 mM were measured for Cs+ and Ca 2 +, respectively, using, as substrate, spermine, a polyamine of plasma.

Induced hyperglycemia during SE in P 9 protected the hippocampal neurons from death and both groups IC and ID presented increased GLUT 3 expression, showing high glucose consumption by the hippocampus...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that reendothelialized regions of injured rabbit aortas are more susceptible to diet-induced atherosclerosis than persistently deendothelialized regions or uninjured aortas. However, the mechanism responsible for this selective lipid deposition is not understood. One possibility is that these regions differ with respect to the quantity and type of glycosaminoglycan-containing proteoglycans which are known to interact with lipoproteins. To determine whether these regions differed with respect to their glycosaminoglycan composition, the authors divided 53 rabbits into four <b>groups.</b> <b>Groups</b> <b>IA</b> and IB were fed a regular diet beginning 5 weeks prior to aortic deendothelialization; Groups IIA and IIB were fed the same diet supplemented with 0. 5 % cholesterol. The rabbits were continued on these diets following aortic deendothelialization with a balloon catheter. Those in <b>Groups</b> <b>IA</b> and IIA were sacrificed either at 2 - 5 weeks or 6 - 8 weeks following deendothelialization; proteoglycans were assessed morphometrically following staining with alcian blue. Groups IB and IIB were sacrificed at 10 weeks following injury; glycosaminoglycans were extracted from deendothelialized and reendothelialized aortas, separated by electrophoresis, and quantitated by scanning densitometry. Morphometric analysis of stained aortic sections revealed significantly increased quantities of alcianophilic material in the neointima of reendothelialized aortas as compared with deendothelialized aortas in both diet groups. Chemical analysis revealed significantly more of each glycosaminoglycan in reendothelialized aortas when compared with deendothelialized or uninjured aortas. The major glycosaminoglycans present in all regions were heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate; and although absolute quantities of these particular glycosaminoglycans increased in the reendothelialized region, their relative percentages remained the same for each area analyzed. Cholesterol feeding did not appear to influence glycosaminoglycan concentration and composition in reendothelialized and deendothelialized regions when compared with normal diets, but cholesterol feeding alone did increase aortic glycosaminoglycans in uninjured aortas. The results suggest that the presence of endothelium influences the quantity and type of glycosaminoglycans accumulating in the neointima, and that the differences in proteoglycans in the reendothelialized artery may account at least in part for the propensity of this area to accumulate lipid and evolve as atherosclerosis...|$|R
40|$|Background: Arthroscopic {{shoulder}} operations (ASS) {{are often}} associated with severe postoperative pain. Nerve blocks have been studied for pain in shoulder surgeries. Interscalene brachial plexus blocks (ISB) and an intra-articular injection (IA) {{have been reported in}} many studies. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effect of ISB, a continuous cervical epidural block (CCE) and IA as a means of postoperative pain control and to study the influence of these procedures on postoperative analgesic consumption and after ASS. Methods: Fifty seven patients who underwent ASS under general anesthesia were {{randomly assigned to one of}} three groups: the ISB group (n = 19), the CCE group (n = 19), and the <b>IA</b> <b>group</b> (n = 19). Patients in each group were evaluated on a postoperative numerical rating scale (NRS), their rescue opioid dosage (ROD), and side effects. Results: Postoperative NRSs were found to be higher in the <b>IA</b> <b>group</b> than in the ISB and CCE groups both at rest and on movement. The ROD were 1. 6 ± 2. 3, 3. 0 ± 4. 9 and 7. 1 ± 7. 9 mg morphine equivalent dose in groups CCE, ISB, and <b>IA</b> <b>groups</b> (P = 0. 001), respectively, and statistically significant differences were noted between the CCE and <b>IA</b> <b>groups</b> (P = 0. 01) but not in between the ISB and CCE groups. Conclusions: This prospective, randomized study demonstrated that ISB is as effective analgesic techniqu...|$|R
