The exhibit includes views of the plumbing <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>vantage</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> those residing or working at the prison, including that of the prisoners, prison guards, and the manufacturers of the plumbing.

[...] (17) Others, such as Denise Chavez (Face of an Angel,1994) support Olmos' position.

[...] In general, Amy Barrias' analyses of representative coming-of-age Chicano and American Indian texts, including Bless Me, Ultima allows her to conclude that because American Indian and Chicano(a) writers find very little in dominant culture on which to build an identity, they have turned inward to create their own texts of rediscovery.
