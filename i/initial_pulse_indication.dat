40|$|Nonlinear plane {{acoustic}} waves propagating {{through a}} fluid are studied using Burgers' equation with finite viscosity. The {{evolution of a}} simple N-pulse with regular and random initial amplitude and of pulses with monochromatic and noise carrier is considered. In the latter case the <b>initial</b> <b>pulses</b> are characterized by two length scales. The length scale of the modulation function {{is much greater than}} the period or the length scale of the carrier. With increasing time the <b>initial</b> <b>pulses</b> are deformed and shocks appear. The finite viscosity leads to a finite shock width, which does not depend on the fine structure of the <b>initial</b> <b>pulse</b> and is fully determined by the shock position in the zero viscosity limit. The other effect of nonzero viscosity is the shift of the shock position from the position at zero viscosity. This shift, as well as the linear time, at which the nonlinear stage of evolution changes to the linear stage, depends on the fine structure of the <b>initial</b> <b>pulse.</b> It is also shown that the nonlinearity of the medium leads to generation of a nonzero mean field from an initial random field with zero mean value. The relative fluctuation of the field is investigated both at the nonlinear and the linear stage. Comment: LaTeX file 37 pages, 2 EPS figures. accepted to print by Acustica-Acta Acustic...|$|R

TRANQL was used to investigate the sensitivity of cadmium transport {{to a range of}} initial condition, pH, complexing ligand concentrations, and concentrations of a simultaneously sorbing solute. Aqueous-phase complexation, dissociation of water, and sorption were the processes considered. First, the transport of an <b>initial</b> <b>pulse</b> of cadmium with a constant concentration of EDTA was examined.

When the <b>initial</b> <b>pulse</b> amplitude is smaller than and/or the <b>initial</b> <b>pulse</b> width is greater than the equilibrium value, the pulse decays. When the reverse is the case, the pulse is converted to an infinitesimal intermediate-mode solitary wave having greater pulse amplitude and speed.

40|$|It has {{recently}} been demonstrated that nano scale zero-valent iron (nZVI) oxidizes the herbicide molinate when it {{is used in the}} presence of oxygen. Further batch and column experiments were conducted to investigate the potential application of nZVI for the treatment of contaminants. Results of batch studies reveal a rapid initial degradation of molinate followed by slower degradation over more than a day. Additional insight into the nZVI-mediated process has been obtained from studies of the formation of para-hydroxybenzoic acid ((p) -HBA) from the oxidative degradation of benzoic acid with slow ongoing production of (p) -HBA over 24 h observed after an <b>initial</b> <b>pulse</b> of byproduct production. Addition of EDTA enhances the <b>initial</b> <b>pulse</b> by 50 % but does not appear to reduce surface passivation over a longer time frame. Oxygen availability during the <b>initial</b> <b>pulse</b> appears to be a limiting factor. Results of column studies reveal that the arrangement of the nZVI, sand and gravel within the column strongly affect the degradation performance despite each column having the identical nZVI loading. Under the optimal column configuration, > 90 % removal of 100 ppb molinate was observed over a 3 h period. These promising results suggest that nZVI, despite initial rapid oxidation of the particle surface, has sufficient residual oxidizing power to enable it to be incorporated into a continuous treatment process.

The flare is similar in appearance to the two known flares in SGR 0526 - 66 and SGR 1900 + 14 while exceeding them significantly in intensity. The enormous X-ray and gamma-ray flux in the narrow <b>initial</b> <b>pulse</b> of the flare leads to almost instantaneous deep saturation of the gamma-ray detectors, ruling {{out the possibility of}} directly measuring the intensity, time profile, and energy spectrum of the <b>initial</b> <b>pulse.</b> In this situation, the detection of an attenuated signal of Compton back-scattering of the <b>initial</b> <b>pulse</b> emission by the Moon with the Helicon gamma-ray spectrometer onboard the Coronas-F satellite was an extremely favorable circumstance.

40|$|This work {{explores the}} effect of propagation-path {{characteristics}} (electrical conductivity of the soil (σ) and propagation distance (d)) on cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning waveform parameters (rise-time and peak amplitude). The ground wave electromagnetic field propagates long distances (100 ’s of km) over finitely-conductivity soil and can be detected by remote ground-based lightning sensors which respond to the vertical electric field (horizontal magnetic field) component of the resulting waveform. This work has lead to a key insight regarding ground-wave propagation of electromagnetic waves produced by CG lightning. The behavior of waveform parameters (rise-time and amplitude attenuation) {{as a function of}} propagation distance (or equivalently, changes in electrical conductivity) is primarily determined by the duration (width) of the <b>initial</b> waveform <b>pulse.</b> This has lead to the inference that the first strokes in CG lightning (which have the widest <b>initial</b> <b>pulse)</b> exhibit the greatest variation in rise-time as a function of distance or conductivity.

40|$|We {{investigate}} analytically {{the propagation}} of linear waves in a three-dimensional, nonmagnetic, isothermal atmosphere stratified in plane-parallel layers. The motivation is to study oscillations in the non-magnetic chromosphere and to assess the limitations of one-dimensional simulations of the Kv bright point phenomenon. We consider an impulsively excited acoustic disturbance, emanating from a point source, and propagating outward as a spherical acoustic wave accompanied by an internal gravity wave. The waves amplify exponentially in the upward direction. A significant wave amplitude is therefore found only in a relatively narrow cone about the vertical. The amplitude of the wave decreases with time. Because of the lateral spread, the wave amplitude decays faster in 2 D and 3 D simulations than in 1 D. The <b>initial</b> <b>pulse,</b> which travels at the sound speed, carries most of the energy injected into the medium.
