40|$|The global {{aircraft}} industry and its regulatory agencies are currently involved in three major icing efforts: ground icing; advanced technologies for in-flight icing; and tailplane icing.

40|$|The {{goals of}} the {{tactical}} utility flight test are to verify the basic tactical lessons learned in simulation and determine the situational awareness implications of post-stall maneuvering. Tactics and lessons learned from post-stall engagements will supplement current fighter tactics and complement future fighter tactics development.

5000|$|Aircraft are {{becoming}} increasingly automated, often resulting <b>in</b> the <b>flight</b> crew becoming complacent because of less direct involvement especially during the cruise phases of a long haul <b>flight.</b> Long legs <b>in</b> cruise may cause pilots to become bored, thus incrementing the prevalence of risk because {{it will take a}} pilot a longer time to resume full alertness in case of emergency. Airlines schedule two crews or a junior first officer as a strategy to combat boredom during the cruise phases of flight. [...] "Keep Awake" [...] routines are another countermeasure. They consist of small events <b>in</b> <b>flight</b> designed to <b>start</b> a false problem that has previously been inputted by a flight engineer.

At lower resolutions the amount of data that had to move over the bus was limited in any case, so the [...] "brute force" [...] approach of drawing every frame to the buffer would work fine, and did for contemporary games like Red Baron.
