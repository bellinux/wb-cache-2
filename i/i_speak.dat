In fact, how can they, if virtue has only one eternal standard? I must therefore, if I reason consequentially, as strenuously maintain that they have the same simple direction, as that there is a God.|$|E

25|$|Peter was a well-connected controversialist and propagandist for Henry II. He {{wrote in}} praise of him to {{continental}} contacts, like Walter of the Mill, now Archbishop of Palermo, defending him against the charge that he had deliberately instigated the murder of Thomas Becket. In introducing the subject of Becket's death, Peter mentioned in passing his own clerical order: in verbo Domini et in ordine diaconi vobis dico – “in the Word of God and the order of deacon <b>I</b> <b>speak</b> to you.” At some stage in his education, he had been ordained a deacon {{and he seems to}} have avoided ordination to the priesthood.|$|E

I look at them as being treated like lab rats that are test vehicles for the doctors. The doctors, the management, the officials, they're the ones that have corrupted riders. The riders are the only ones that pay the price." ...|$|E

However, his peers believed that it was very distinct from the lead single, [...] "Don't Wanna Go Home" [...] and that response motivated him to pick it as the second single. He believed that showing the difference in the new album was important in picking the single. He did not want to put another dance song so that his fans do not assume that the entire album consisted of uptempo songs. He concluded that [...] "growing up has definitely taken place. My music has always been a representation of who I am and I guess <b>I</b> <b>speak</b> differently, my demeanour is different." ...|$|E

'Devil's Advocate' is a very dark movie, but at the same time, visually, it's beautiful.

After realizing the power of his voice he then decided to make important and unique songs, focusing on the message, rather than just creating inane music. He said his mode of operation at that time [...] "was just, 'Hey, I'm making these cool sounding songs and I have little messages in them'", but still had himself in it. Although Cudi had a message in every track, he chose to avoid using dense lyrics, explaining {{that he did not want}} to write material that he would not actually say or use in real life, adding that being true to yourself entirely was meaningful to him.

For the survivors, {{it was as if they}} were reborn, having experienced death around them. The earthquake had happened at four or five in the morning, so in a sense everybody could have been dead and it was almost accidental that they hadn't died. So I didn't just see myself as a film director here, but also as an observer of people who had been condemned to death. So this was a very big influence on me, and the issue of life and death from then on does recur in my films[...]|$|E

This is the base of the Russian culture. I never forget it, especially since I have Russian roots". When asked if she still feels Russian, after having left Russia at a young age, Milla replied, [...] "Definitely. I still speak Russian. <b>I</b> <b>speak</b> it with my daughter.
