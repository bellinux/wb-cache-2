25|$|The {{degaussing}} circuit {{is often}} built of a thermo-electric (not electronic) device containing a small ceramic <b>heating</b> <b>element</b> {{and a positive}} thermal coefficient (PTC) resistor, connected directly to the switched AC power line with the resistor in series with the degaussing coil. When the power is switched on, the <b>heating</b> <b>element</b> heats the PTC resistor, increasing its resistance {{to a point where}} degaussing current is minimal, but not actually zero. In older CRT displays, this low-level current (which produces no significant degaussing field) is sustained along with the action of the <b>heating</b> <b>element</b> as long as the display remains switched on. To repeat a degaussing cycle, the CRT display must be switched off and left off for at least several seconds to reset the degaussing circuit by allowing the PTC resistor to cool to the ambient temperature; switching the display-off and immediately back on will result in a weak degaussing cycle or effectively no degaussing cycle.|$|E

40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 10 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Florida, 14 - 16 July 2014. Natural convective heat transfer from a square horizontal flat isothermal <b>heated</b> <b>element</b> imbedded in a larger flat square adiabatic surface with a square flat horizontal adiabatic surface mounted parallel to the heated surface at a relatively short distance from it has been numerically studied. The surface of the <b>heated</b> <b>element</b> {{is in the same}} plane as the surface of the surrounding adiabatic material. The square <b>heated</b> <b>element</b> considered in this study is at a higher temperature than that of the surrounding fluid. Both the case where the square <b>heated</b> <b>element</b> is facing upwards and the surrounding adiabatic covering surface is above the <b>heated</b> <b>element</b> (upward facing case) and the case where the square <b>heated</b> <b>element</b> is facing downwards and the surrounding adiabatic covering surface is below the <b>heated</b> <b>element</b> (downward facing case) have been considered. The situation considered is a simplified model of some situations that arise in engineering practice examples occurring in some electrical and electronic component cooling problems. In this study, the range of conditions considered is such that laminar, transitional, and turbulent flows occur. The {{purpose of this study was}} to numerically determine how the heat transfer rate from the square <b>heated</b> <b>element</b> varies with the distance of the adiabatic covering surface from the <b>heated</b> <b>element.</b> The solution was obtained by numerically solving the governing equations subject to the boundary conditions using the commercial CFD solver ANSYS FLUENT© using the kepsilon turbulence model with full account being taken of buoyancy force effects. Because of the applications that motivated this study, results have been obtained for a Prandtl number of 0. 74, i. e., effectively the value for air. The effect of the dimensionless distance between the <b>heated</b> <b>element</b> and the cover on the variation of the Nusselt number with Rayleigh number has been studied in detail for both the upward and the downward facing cases. dc 201...|$|R
25|$|A {{block heater}} warms {{the engine of}} an {{automobile}} in order to ease and speed starting and vehicle warm-up in cold weather. The most common type is an electric <b>heating</b> <b>element</b> connected through a power cord often routed through the vehicle's grille. The block heater may replace one of the engine's core plugs, or may be installed in line {{with one of the}} radiator or heater hoses. The block heater, first known as a head bolt heater, was invented in 1945 by Andrew Freeman in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Freeman used some scrap hoses and copper tubing onto the <b>heating</b> <b>element</b> of an old flat-iron and produced the first headbolt heater, which warmed the engine's water jacket and the oil film between cylinder heads and pistons. U.S. patent #2,487,326 was filed on November 4, 1946 and issued to Freeman on November 8, 1949.|$|E
25|$|The {{event-driven}} SOA software could {{shut off}} the <b>heating</b> <b>element</b> of water heaters to the pre-set response limits established by individual homeowners. For example, if the market price of electricity for a given hour exceeded the home owner's limit, the home owner could plan to go without recharging the water's hot temperature for that hour, when prices were high, and opt to delay the hot water temperature recharge to the next hour when electricity market prices might be lower.|$|E
25|$|When flow {{starts from}} the {{uppermost}} outlet, cold water enters the tank at the bottom. This drop in temperature causes the thermostat {{to switch on}} the electric <b>heating</b> <b>element</b> {{at the bottom of}} the tank. When the water at the top of the tank is drawn off the hot water at the top is displaced by relatively cooler water, the top thermostat turns the top element on. When the flow stops, the elements stay on until their settings are met.|$|E

25|$|Another problem {{faced with}} PID {{controllers}} {{is that they}} are linear, and in particular symmetric. Thus, performance of PID controllers in non-linear systems (such as HVAC systems) is variable. For example, in temperature control, a common use case is active heating (via a <b>heating</b> <b>element)</b> but passive cooling (heating off, but no cooling), so overshoot can only be corrected slowly – it cannot be forced downward. In this case the PID should be tuned to be overdamped, to prevent or reduce overshoot, though this reduces performance (it increases settling time).|$|E
25|$|Like vacuum {{distillation}}, {{steam distillation}} {{is a method}} for distilling compounds which are heat-sensitive. The temperature of the steam is easier to control than {{the surface of a}} <b>heating</b> <b>element,</b> and allows a high rate of heat transfer without heating at a very high temperature. This process involves bubbling steam through a heated mixture of the raw material. By Raoult's law, some of the target compound will vaporize (in accordance with its partial pressure). The vapor mixture is cooled and condensed, usually yielding a layer of oil and a layer of water.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} type is an {{electric}} <b>heating</b> <b>element</b> in the cylinder block, connected through a power cord often routed through the vehicle's grille. The block heater may replace one of the engine's core plugs. In this fashion, the heater element is immersed in the engine's coolant, which then keeps most of the engine warm. This type of heater does not come with a pump. They may also be installed in line {{with one of the}} radiator or heater hoses. Some heaters pump and circulate the engine coolant while heating, others only heat the still coolant in the reservoir.|$|E

25|$|Aquarium heaters {{combine a}} <b>heating</b> <b>element</b> with a thermostat, {{allowing}} the aquarist to regulate water temperature {{at a level}} above that of the surrounding air, whereas coolers and chillers (refrigeration devices) are for use anywhere, such as cold water aquaria, where the ambient room temperature is above the desired tank temperature. Thermometers used include glass alcohol thermometers, adhesive external plastic strip thermometers, and battery-powered LCD thermometers. In addition, some aquarists use air pumps attached to airstones or water pumps to increase water circulation and supply adequate gas exchange at the water surface. Wave-making devices have also been constructed to provide wave action.|$|E
25|$|In a {{convection}} heater, the <b>heating</b> <b>element</b> heats the air {{in contact}} with it by thermal conduction. Hot air is less dense than cool air, so it rises due to buoyancy, allowing more cool air to flow in to take its place. This sets up a convection current of hot air that rises from the heater, heats up the surrounding space, cools and then repeats the cycle. These heaters are sometimes filled with oil. They are ideally suited for heating a closed space. They operate silently and have a lower risk of ignition hazard if they make unintended contact with furnishings compared to radiant electric heaters.|$|E
25|$|Andrew Freeman of Grand Forks, North Dakota, {{invented the}} head bolt heater around 1940 and {{received}} a patent for it on November 8, 1949. In 1951, Freeman received another patent on an improved head bolt heater. These early heaters replaced one of the engine's cylinder head bolts with a hollow, threaded shank containing a resistive <b>heating</b> <b>element.</b> Before the block heater was introduced, people {{used a variety of}} methods to warm engines before starting them, such as pouring hot water on the engine block or draining the engine's oil for storage inside overnight.

25|$|Electrical {{immersion}} heaters may heat water immediately {{adjacent to the}} <b>heating</b> <b>element</b> high enough to promote the formation of scale, commonly calcium carbonate, in hard water areas. This accumulates on the element, and over time, as the element expands and contracts through its heating cycle, the scale cracks off and drops {{to the bottom of}} the tank, progressively filling up the tank. This reduces the tank's capacity and, where the immersion heater is secondary to the heating of the water by a coil fed from a gas or oil-fired boiler, can reduce the efficiency of the primary heating source by covering that other coil and in turn reducing its efficiency. Regular flushing-out of accumulated sediment can reduce this problem.|$|E
25|$|One may {{reasonably}} {{maintain an}} average and acceptable temperature for the snake {{by the use}} of a <b>heating</b> <b>element</b> or infrared light bulbs. A gradient must be offered within the enclosure to allow the snake to bask in the heat or go to cooler areas in the tank. Optimum humidity can be difficult to maintain and research must be done on the snake to determine the correct level. More than 80% humidity must be maintained for caging an anaconda species from the tropical region, while a slightly less than 30% humidity must be maintained for a species of a desert region. Photoperiods are often used with most species of snake; natural light is best for this, but low UV percentage bulbs can also be used. Captive anacondas have a reputation for unpredictability and aggression due to the temperaments of wild-caught specimens first collected for captive breeding, but with proper care, green anacondas can and do make for calm, relatively sedate pets. Due to their immense size and power however, proper respect and caution should always be maintained, and they are best left to experienced adult owners who can provide them with the proper requirements.|$|E

500|$|For {{the next}} century, {{molybdenum}} had no industrial use. [...] It was relatively scarce, the pure metal {{was difficult to}} extract, and the necessary techniques of metallurgy were immature. Early molybdenum steel alloys showed great promise of increased hardness, but efforts to manufacture the alloys {{on a large scale}} were hampered with inconsistent results, a tendency toward brittleness, and recrystallization. In 1906, William D. Coolidge filed a patent for rendering molybdenum ductile, leading to applications as a <b>heating</b> <b>element</b> for high-temperature furnaces and as a support for tungsten-filament light bulbs; oxide formation and degradation require that molybdenum be physically sealed or held in an inert gas. In 1913, Frank E. Elmore developed a froth flotation process to recover molybdenite from ores; flotation remains the primary isolation process.|$|E
500|$|A blocked {{pitot tube}} is a pitot-static problem {{that will only}} affect {{airspeed}} indicators. [...] A blocked pitot tube will cause the airspeed indicator to register an increase in airspeed when the aircraft climbs, even though actual airspeed is constant.(As long as the drain hole is also blocked, as the air pressure would otherwise leak out to the atmosphere) [...] This {{is caused by the}} pressure in the pitot system remaining constant when the atmospheric pressure (and static pressure) are decreasing. [...] In reverse, the airspeed indicator will show a decrease in airspeed when the aircraft descends. [...] The pitot tube is susceptible to becoming clogged by ice, water, insects or some other obstruction. [...] For this reason, aviation regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) recommend that the pitot tube be checked for obstructions prior to any flight. [...] To prevent icing, many pitot tubes are equipped with a <b>heating</b> <b>element.</b> [...] A heated pitot tube is required in all aircraft certificated for instrument flight except aircraft certificated as Experimental Amateur-Built.|$|E
