5|$|Suffering {{withdrawal}} syndrome from {{the lack of}} cable, Peter straps a television-sized cardboard cutout to himself, making it appear as though his whole world is actually a television programme. When Meg can no longer deal with the public scorn, she reveals that her father is really responsible for Quahog's loss of television, causing the town to turn against him. In an attempt to save Peter from further scorn and verbal attacks, Lois gives a heartfelt speech to the community about how television has kept them all from enjoying one another. Inspired by the speech, Peter drags the family to one outdoor activity after another, which quickly exhausts them. Once the family can no longer <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>him,</b> Peter decides to go off with William Shatner, who has appeared on the Griffin family doorstep after experiencing a flat tire, to a nearby festival. Meanwhile, Stewie's weather machine creates a huge rainstorm. The storm's lightning strike destroys Stewie's weather machine and blows Stewie off the roof and on the ground. While Meg is practicing driving with Lois, the storm causes her to accidentally hit Shatner and Peter, killing Shatner and hospitalizing Peter. As her father recovers, in a full-body cast, he is forced to watch television, causing him to become addicted once again, much to his family's relief.|$|E
25|$|For the 1905–06 season, Taylor {{played a}} handful of games for Portage la Prairie in Manitoba. Several teams in the new International Professional Hockey League tried to get Taylor to join them, {{including}} Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario and Calumet, Michigan, which even got Taylor to sign a contract. But in February 1906 he ended up reuniting with Forrester on the Portage Lake team, based in Houghton, Michigan. The team won the league championship with Taylor playing point. He had started as a forward, but was too fast for his linemates to <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> Player salaries outpaced revenue {{in the league and}} the IPHL went out of business in 1907.|$|E
25|$|Hamilton {{was able}} {{to open up a}} 4-second lead over Alonso, with Vettel being {{initially}} held up by the Spaniard, but unable to <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> as the Ferrari driver found the grip in his tyres. As the stint wore on, Alonso {{was able to}} pull clear of Vettel and close down Hamilton's lead to just over 2 seconds, and Hamilton decided to make a second stop for new tyres. He rejoined in third, 9.5 seconds behind Vettel and 13 behind Alonso, and just ahead of Webber and Grosjean who were fighting for 4th. Both Alonso and Vettel realized {{that they do not have}} enough of a gap to make another stop and rejoin ahead of Hamilton, so they stayed out and attempted to complete the race without stopping again in an attempt to win.|$|E

5000|$|Contemporary reviews were positive. [...] "Even {{though it}} is not the best of (Astaire and Rogers') series it still is good enough to take the head of this year's class in song and dance entertainment", wrote Frank S. Nugent in The New York Times. [...] "They tap as gayly, waltz as beautifully and {{disagree}} as merrily as ever." [...] "With Ginger Rogers once again opposite, and the Irving Berlin music to dance to and sing, Astaire once more legs himself and his picture into the big time entertainment class", Variety wrote in a positive review, although it found the 110 minute running time [...] "way overboard" [...] and suggested it could have benefited from being cut by 20 minutes. [...] "Well loaded with entertainment for mass satisfaction", reported Film Daily. John Mosher of The New Yorker wrote that [...] "Fred Astaire bobs at his best ... I don't think he's done any better stepping anywhere then he does in this picture, and trim little Ginger Rogers <b>keeps</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> all the time." [...] They were enough, Mosher wrote, to overcome the film's excessive length and a plot that lacked [...] "any of the lightness of the Astaire feet." ...|$|R

500|$|Early breaker Denifl {{was alone}} in front and had about two minutes of an {{advantage}} with [...] to go. Behind, Domenico Pozzovivo placed an acceleration that put the lead group in difficulty, but he was brought back. The time gap rapidly decreased, due to dubious time monitoring again. Pinot launched an attack from the group, but Špilak had the resources to <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> for a while but was ultimately dropped. Pinot passed the passive Denifl before the arch signaling the last kilometer (flamme rouge) and took a solo victory. Pozzovivo finished second while Špilak settled for third. However, it became soon apparent that Dumoulin would not lose {{much more than the}} minute and a half that was his objective. He passed the line 1' 37" [...] down on Pinot. [...] "I'm very happy, it was important for me and the team. We came here to win a stage, and I had good legs today. I've got a lot of confidence now, that’s important for the Tour de France. And it's true, racing in Switzerland seems to suit me," [...] said Pinot. [...] "The objective is to win overall here, but the rouleurs like [...] Thomas and [...] Dumoulin aren't far back," [...] he added. [...] "It'll be a long and difficult time trial [...] We'll see what happens on the day." ...|$|E
500|$|Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is a 2D, side-scrolling {{platform}} game. The game stars Sonic the Hedgehog and his sidekick, Miles [...] "Tails" [...] Prower, who {{is described}} as having idolized Sonic {{as a child and}} wanting to <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> At the game's start, the player can select to either play as Sonic, Tails, or both. The difference between the two is purely cosmetic; the two both have identical abilities. In the latter mode, players control Sonic while Tails runs along beside him. A second player can join in at any time and control Tails separately. The game takes place over a series of levels, each divided into one, two, or three acts with a boss fight with Robotnik {{at the end of the}} last act. Certain levels have features that are unique to them; for example, Emerald Hill has corkscrew-like loops, and Chemical Plant has boost pads that instantly put Sonic at his top speed. The character can jump on enemies to defeat them; the game also introduces a new move, the [...] "spin dash" [...] or [...] "Super Dash Attack", by which the player curls in a ball and spins while stationary, resulting in a speed boost. When the player is attacked by an enemy without rings, is crushed, falls off-screen, or exceeds the act's ten-minute limit, they lose a life and return to the most recently passed checkpoint. Dying with zero lives gives the player a game over.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2007, Voigt won {{the third}} stage of the Tour of California, which had {{numerous}} climbs. After the bunch caught 17 escapees, Levi Leipheimer of [...] attacked, and only Chris Horner (...) and Voigt could <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> Voigt ultimately prevailed in the sprint over the two men and approached to only 3 seconds behind Leipheimer for the General Classification thanks to time bonuses. He managed {{to hold on to}} his second place over the next 4 stages, finishing 21 seconds behind the winner of the Tour, Leipheimer. In April, he met another success at the Critérium International, winning the overall classification and stage 2, a short, undulating stage of 98.5 kilometers finishing in Monthermé. Voigt attacked near the Côte du Mont Malgré Tout, with almost 25 kilometers to go, and crossed the finish line solo, 48 seconds in front of the chasers. The last stage of the race was a short individual time trial of 8.3 kilometers which was raced in the afternoon of the same day, and Voigt stated he gave everything he had but was very careful while negotiating the turns. He finished seventh, keeping his leader's jersey and winning the 3-stage race, while the Swede Thomas Lövkvist of [...] took second place. Another major win of the 2007 season came for him in the Deutschland Tour, which he won {{for the second year in}} a row, with Levi Leipheimer taking second place at 1'57" [...] and David Lopez of [...] completing the overall classification podium. Voigt stated that his victory was harder to accomplish than the preceding year, when it was somewhat of a surprise. He was a marked man.|$|E
60|$|The {{march to}} Madrid was {{accomplished}} without adventure, {{and the boys}} improved the occasion by endeavoring to pick up as many French phrases as they could, as they marched along {{by the side of}} the sergeant who had specially taken them under his charge.

At Madrid they took up their quarters in the barracks with the regiment; they had already explained their plan of disguise to Madame Reynier, and she had promised to provide all that was necessary and to obtain the military pass for them.|$|R
