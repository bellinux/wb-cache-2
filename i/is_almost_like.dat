500|$|Popular cultivars in Malaysia and Singapore (Singapore imports {{most of its}} durians from Malaysia {{hence the}} {{varieties}} are similar although there may be slight variation in the names) include [...] "D24" [...] which is a popular variety known for its bitter sweet taste; [...] "XO" [...] which has a pale color, thick flesh with a tinge of alcoholic fermentation; [...] "Chook Kiok" [...] (Cantonese meaning: bamboo leg) which has a distinctive yellowish core in the inner stem and [...] "Musang King" [...] ('musang' is the Malay word for civet cat) which is usually the priciest of all cultivars. Musang King {{is known for its}} bright yellow flesh and <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>like</b> a more potent or enhanced version of the D24. This particular variety should be consumed last since it tends to make other durians taste bland in comparison.|$|E
500|$|After {{writing his}} 2010 album Airtight's Revenge with themes {{intended}} for male listeners, Bilal wrote A Love Surreal for female listeners with lyrics about love. He described writing the album as a surrealistic exploration of love. He {{was inspired by}} the surrealism of Spanish painter Salvador Dalí, after viewing a 2005 Salvador Dalí exhibit at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. He also drew on the shelving of his unreleased album Love for Sale, which inspired A Love Surreals title. [...] "For the longest I was supposed to sign with [...] and actually put Love for Sale out, but you know, things happen", Bilal told Okayplayer. [...] "It's surreal that I'm right back at the same spot about to put out a record with them. Also, surreal – the word surrealism – my inspiration for this record, I got a lot of concepts from Salvador Dali and the way he made his art pieces, it almost looks three-dimensional, and I wanted to do that with the sound of this album. So this record <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>like</b> a sonic art piece." [...] Bilal had wanted to sign with eOne because of the artistic freedom the label had given fellow recording artist Dwele. The album's title was also inspired by John Coltrane's 1965 album A Love Supreme.|$|E
500|$|Clarkson co-wrote {{the seventh}} track, [...] "Where Is Your Heart", with DioGuardi and Chantal Kreviazuk. She {{revealed}} {{that it was}} also about her boyfriend, Hodges, whom she described as [...] "wanting to get really into our relationship, and I just thought, 'Where are you in our relationship?'" [...] "Walk Away", the eight track, was also written by the three, with additional writing by Raine Maida. Clarkson described it as [...] "one of the brighter songs" [...] on Breakaway, and said that [...] "It's very blunt and to the point. 'I'm done with you, you're upsetting me.'" [...] DioGuardi and Shanks co-wrote the ninth track, [...] "You Found Me". Clarkson revealed, [...] "When I recorded this one, I was actually in a good place with a guy. It was very fitting {{at the time that}} I recorded it." [...] DioGuardi had also co-written the tenth track, [...] "I Hate Myself for Losing You", with Jimmy Harry and Shep Solomon. Clarkson described the song as [...] "depressing", but felt it {{could be used as a}} foreshadowing device. She explained [...] "I read something that Sting said in an interview, he talked about how the great thing about writing is that it is an emotional and therapeutic thing and you can get it out." [...] The eleventh track, [...] "Hear Me", was written by Clarkson, DioGuardi, and Clif Magness. Clarkson explained the song, [...] "It's <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>like</b> a prayer to God. I haven't met the person whom I will spend the rest of my life with, but the song is a prayer to God about that. That's what the song is. 'God, I'm ready for 'the one!'" [...] The twelfth and closing track is a live recording of [...] "Beautiful Disaster", originally from Thankful. Clarkson admitted that she hated Thankfuls version of the song, and thought the production was distracting from the lyrics. So she decided to record a piano ballad version instead.|$|E

2500|$|The album name plays off of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, {{using his}} first and middle name and {{replacing}} his last with the band's name [...] "Phoenix". Of the name, Phoenix, Thomas Mars says, [...] "The album title <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>like</b> a childish thing, like you're unleashing a child into the museum and he draws a mustache on the Mona Lisa or something ... It's kind of bratty, especially with me, my mom is German and Mozart is Austrian and in Germany it's like messing with the Pope or something." ...|$|E

He is further described as [...] "small and skinny for his age" [...] with [...] "a thin face" [...] and [...] "knobbly knees", and he wears round eyeglasses. In the first book, his scar {{is described}} as [...] "the only thing Harry liked about his own appearance". When asked about the meaning behind Harry's lightning bolt scar, Rowling said, [...] "I {{wanted him to be}} physically marked by what he has been through. It was an outward expression of what he has been through inside... It <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>like</b> being the chosen one or the cursed one, in a sense." ...|$|E
2500|$|Translation of sung texts is {{generally}} much more restrictive than translation of poetry, {{because in the}} former {{there is little or}} no freedom to choose between a versified translation and a translation that dispenses with verse structure. One might modify or omit rhyme in a singing translation, but the assignment of syllables to specific notes in the original musical setting places great challenges on the translator. [...] There is the option in prose sung texts, less so in verse, of adding or deleting a syllable here and there by subdividing or combining notes, respectively, but even with prose the process <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>like</b> strict verse translation because of the need to stick as closely as possible to the original prosody of the sung melodic line.|$|E
2500|$|Mohanlal {{had acted}} in several amateur plays before {{entering}} into films. In 2001, he debuted in professional drama playing Karna (a character from the Indian epic Mahabharata) in Karnabharam, a Sanskrit-language play directed by Kavalam Narayana Panicker. It premiered at the Siri Fort Auditorium in New Delhi on 29 March 2001 {{as part of}} the National Theatre Festival of National School of Drama. The play depicts Karna's mental agony a day before the Kurukshetra War, as he thinks about his past and his faith. Mohanlal said, [...] "You cannot compare Kavalam's play with the amateur plays I did. Though there are other characters in the play, the theme revolves around Karna. It <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>like</b> a solo performance. Some of the scenes are really touching and challenging". He acted without payment, saying [...] "I performed for the joy of it ... for my love of our history".|$|E

Hassan said that the pair have a [...] "kind of prickly friendship" [...] {{and that they have}} a lot of things in common although they are very different people. She felt that it <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>like</b> the characters should not be friends, but acknowledged that opposites attracted in this instance. Lynsey is attracted to Mercedes as she sees qualities in Mercedes that she wishes she had herself, such as Mercedes being straight-talking, ballsy and someone who [...] "calls a spade a spade, and sometimes Lynsey wishes she had a bit of that gusto". When Mercedes begins working at the hospital as a cleaner and becomes involved with Doctor Browning (Joe Thompson), Metcalfe explained that the pair gp through everything which is a [...] "real ride of emotions".|$|E
2500|$|For Sir Malcolm Sargent, he {{recorded}} the following Gilbert and Sullivan roles: {{the title role}} in The Mikado (1957), Don Alhambra in The Gondoliers (1957), Wilfred Shadbolt in The Yeomen of the Guard (1958), Dick Deadeye in H.M.S. Pinafore (1958), Private Willis in Iolanthe (1959), the Sergeant of Police in The Pirates of Penzance (1961), the Usher in Trial by Jury (1961) and Sir Despard in Ruddigore (1963). [...] He also sang Willis in the BBC recording of Iolanthe in 1966. His interpretation of the Sergeant of Police in The Pirates of Penzance was so admired that {{he was invited to}} make a second recording of it, for the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, in 1968. The Penguin Guide to Opera said, [...] "perhaps the greatest joy of this recording is Owen Brannigan's Sergeant of Police, a part this artist was surely born to play ... it <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>like</b> hearing it for the first time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{characteristic}} of El Greco's mature style {{is the use}} of light. As Brown notes, [...] "each figure seems to carry its own light within or reflects the light that emanates from an unseen source". Fernando Marias and Agustín Bustamante García, the scholars who transcribed El Greco's handwritten notes, connect the power that the painter gives to light with the ideas underlying Christian Neo-Platonism. The later works of the painter turn this use of light into glowing colors. In The Vision of Saint John and the Fifth Seal of the Apocalypse the scenes owe their power to this otherworldly stormy light, which reveals their mystic character. The renowned View of Toledo (c. 1600) also acquires its visionary character because of this stormy light. The grey-blue clouds are split by lightning bolts, which vividly highlight the noble buildings of the city. His last landscape, View and Plan of Toledo, <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>like</b> a vision, all of the buildings painted glistening white. According to Wethey, in his surviving landscapes, [...] "El Greco demonstrated his characteristic tendency to dramatize rather than to describe". Professor Nicos Hadjinicolaou notes the manner in which El Greco could adjust his style in accordance with his surroundings and stresses the importance of Toledo for the complete development of El Greco's mature style.|$|E

2500|$|The Nintendo 3DS XL {{was very}} well {{received}} at launch. Reviewers generally recommended the console to new buyers of the Nintendo 3DS family, although {{not so much to}} current owners of a Nintendo 3DS. Kotaku mentioned it as [...] "possibly the best portable gaming device ever... a well-designed machine..." [...] and that [...] "it plays great games" [...] while The Verge called it [...] "the best portable gaming buy around right now." [...] The Nintendo 3DS XL improves upon the battery life of the original 3DS. Kotaku claimed that the Nintendo 3DS XL's battery [...] "lasts a cross-country flight.". Sam Byford of The Verge noted that the larger top screen makes more obvious problems with aliasing and low-resolution textures. He did, however, say that the 3D felt more immersive: [...] "Where the 3DS felt like peering through a peephole into another world, the XL <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>like</b> stepping through a door." [...] On the other hand, Destructoid said the 3D effect on the XL was more subtle than on its predecessor. The Verge spoke positively of the build quality and design choices, saying the console improved on the original. A Destructoid reviewer said the 3DS XL was easier to use than the regular Nintendo 3DS, mainly due to his large hands. The Verge noted lowered sound quality from the original, the result of smaller speakers. Both The Verge and Gizmodo complained of low-quality cameras.|$|E
