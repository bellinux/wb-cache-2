5|$|A towering {{figure in}} the Republican party of his day, Blaine fell into obscurity fairly soon after his death. A 1905 {{biography}} by his wife’s cousin, Edward Stanwood, was written when the question was still in doubt, {{but by the time}} David Saville Muzzey published his biography of Blaine in 1934, the subtitle “A Political Idol of Other Days” already spoke to its subject’s fading place in the popular mind, perhaps because of the nine men the Republican Party nominated for the Presidency from 1860 to 1912, Blaine <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> never became President. Although several authors studied Blaine’s foreign policy career, including Edward P. Crapol’s 2000 work, Muzzey’s was the last full-scale biography of the man until Neil Rolde’s 2006 book. Historian R. Hal Williams was working on a new biography of Blaine, tentatively titled James G. Blaine: A Life in Politics, until his death in 2016.|$|E

The next day, Lydia allays her fears to Sarah over {{relationships}} and the girls seal it with a kiss, which Michaela sees. Sarah and Lydia then begin a full relationship. It is revealed that out of her family, Persephone <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> knows of Lydia's sexuality. Lydia replaces Rhys Ashworth (Andrew Moss) as the drummer of Josh's band 'The Somethings' as he kicked him out because he was against having wheelchair user Hayley Ramsey (Kelly Marie Stewart) as the lead singer because of their bad breakup. Lydia is later kicked out of the band due to unreliability.|$|E

5|$|Rose Tyler mysteriously {{appears to}} Donna to warn her of these events, but never reveals her {{identity}} to Donna. Rose's advice saves Donna {{and her family}} from the destruction of London. Sometime later, Rose appears again and tells her that she needs Donna to come with her, but that doing so will result in Donna dying. Donna refuses, and Rose tells her {{that she will be}} back in three weeks. Three weeks later, Donna and Wilfred are using his telescope when they realise that the stars are disappearing from the sky. Rose appears and Donna is now convinced to go with her. Rose takes her to UNIT and explains that the stars are going out in every universe, and the fabric of reality is collapsing, allowing Rose to travel between universes. Rose implores to Donna that the Doctor <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> can stop it.|$|E
5|$|Hogarth {{replicates}} all {{the features}} of the pastoral scene in an urban landscape. The shepherds and shepherdesses become the beggars and whores, the sun overhead is replaced by the clock on the church, the snow-capped mountains become the snowy rooftops. Even the setting of Covent Garden with piles of fruit and vegetables echoes the country scene. In the centre of the picture the icy goddess of the dawn {{in the form of the}} prim churchgoer is followed by her shivering red-nosed pageboy, mirroring Hesperus, the dawn bearer. The woman <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> seems unaffected by the cold, suggesting it may be her element. Although outwardly shocked, the dress of the woman, which is too fashionable for a woman of her age and in the painting is shown to be a striking acid yellow, may suggest she has other thoughts on her mind. She is commonly described as a spinster, and considered to be a hypocrite, ostentatiously attending church and carrying a fashionable ermine muff while displaying no charity to her freezing footboy or the half-seen beggar before her. The figure of the spinster is said to be based on a relative of Hogarth, who, recognising herself in the picture, cut him out of her will. Fielding later used the woman as the model for his character of Bridget Allworthy in Tom Jones.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Aya {{sees the}} orange {{mass of people}} from the park enter the city water supply. She goes to Dr. Klamp one more time, and discovers that Dr. Klamp has {{engineered}} special sperm for Eve so that she can create the Ultimate Being. He then spontaneously combusts. Aya finds Eve {{in another part of the}} museum, where the orange mass has surrounded her, forming an impermeable shield to protect her while the Ultimate Being gestates within her. After several failed attempts to attack Eve, the military asks Aya to attack her from a chopper, as she <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> can get close without combusting. The plan works, but Aya has to personally finish the fight on a now-wrecked Statue of Liberty, where Eve finally succumbs to necrosis due to her unstable cells. As Aya rests on a naval vessel, the Ultimate Being is born and attacks the surrounding ships. Aya does battle with the Ultimate Being, but its mitochondria causes it to evolve at an alarming rate. Aya sets the vessel's boiler pressure dangerously high, so as to destroy it with the Ultimate Being on board.|$|E

5|$|In Final Fantasy XIII-2, Serah <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> remembers Lightning {{being on}} Gran Pulse after she {{is taken to}} Valhalla, with all the others believing she sacrificed herself to save Cocoon. She {{eventually}} becomes a teacher {{in the village of}} New Bodhum, the town she and Snow help build on Gran Pulse, before it is invaded by monsters three years after the fall of Cocoon. Serah is aided by Noel Kreiss, who tells her of Lightning's fate and his own mission. After Serah accepts Noel's offer to be brought to Lightning, the two embark on a journey across time to find her sister. In the process, Serah encounters Caius Ballad, while learning from Paddra Nsu-Yeul that she possesses the same detrimental ability as her to see the future. Despite learning that she would die herself if she continues seeing visions of the future, Serah resolves to change the future for everyone's sake. However, after Caius's defeat and returning to Gran Pulse five hundred years in her future, Serah has another vision and dies moments before Gran Pulse is infected by Valhalla's chaos. Serah appears to Lightning in Valhalla as a spirit, telling her she knew that she could have died from her visions but still took the risk regardless. Serah promises Lightning that they will see each other again as long as Lightning promises to remember her. In Lightning Returns, Serah's soul, which has been kept safe within Lightning, is removed and cast away by Bhunivelze. Lumina acts as a shelter for Serah's soul, resulting in the two being similar in appearance. Bhunivelze also creates a false version of Serah to keep Lightning in line. This false Serah, who develops feelings for her 'sister' arrives when Lightning intends to become the protector of the new world and persuades her to accept her vulnerabilities and call for aid. The real Serah reunites with Lightning and her allies, and travels with them to the new world.|$|E

25|$|Lincoln had an {{attraction}} to machinelike accessories all his life, which some say was hereditary and handed {{down to him}} from his father's interest in labor-saving equipment.

30|$|The {{definition}} of riming pairs in poetry {{depends on the}} notion of the syllable rime, which does not include the pre-nuclear glide G. Of the four proposals, <b>the</b> CV analysis <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> that has no segmentation boundary between G and the nuclear vowel, and so it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> that cannot properly define the syllable rime.|$|R

The {{illusion}} not only “suggests the past, but also presents the lost pastoral life.” Willy has dreamed of success {{his whole life}} and makes up lies about his and Biff’s success. The more he indulges in the illusion, {{the harder it is}} for him to face reality.

Syndra is allowed to descend to Earth at an inappropriate time (faeries can descend and ascend at the full moon) with the King to find Oran {{at the price of}} being forced to be reborn as a spirit force of gold and then confined for all eternity, as Gabija, Nyrckes, and Neptune once were.|$|E

Saya learns that she <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> can defeat them, as her blood causes their bodies to crystallize and shatter. Armed with her special katana, Saya embarks on a journey with her family, allies, and her chevalier Haji, to rid the world of the Chiropteran threat and recover her identity.

25|$|Walsh {{is one of}} {{only four}} bowlers to have bowled over 5000 overs in Test cricket, the other three being spinners: Muttiah Muralitharan of Sri Lanka and Shane Warne of Australia, and Anil Kumble of India. These four, in {{addition}} to Glenn McGrath are also the only bowlers to have taken 500 or more Test wickets. Among the five, Walsh <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> has not taken 8 or more wickets in an innings. In ODIs, Walsh was not as successful although he will be remembered for his best performance, 5 wickets for just 1 run against Sri Lanka in 1986. In first-class cricket, he took 5 wickets in an innings more than 100 times and 10 wickets in a match 20 times.|$|E
25|$|The {{match is}} {{controlled}} by the referee, who enforces the Laws of the Game, and the first referee <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> can legally abandon the match because of interference from outside the field.

The decisions made by the referees are final and can only be changed if the referees think it is necessary and play has not restarted. There is also a third referee and a timekeeper who are provided with equipment to keep a record of fouls in the match. In the event of injury to the second referee, the third referee will replace the second referee.|$|E
