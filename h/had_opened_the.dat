5|$|Charles III {{was also}} {{responsible}} for another palace in Monte Carlo, one which would fund his restorations, and turn around his country's faltering economy. This new palace was Charles Garnier's Second Empire casino, completed in 1878 (Illustration 16). The first Monaco casino <b>had</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> previous decade.

5|$|In 1985, the FAW did {{not have}} the use of a large {{national}} stadium.

The FAW instead took the national team to one of the stadia of Cardiff City, Swansea City or Wrexham, three of the four clubs who then played in the English football league system.|$|E
5|$|Karthik {{was given}} more {{opportunities}} at international level in late-2006 during the ODI tour of South Africa, after Yuvraj Singh was sidelined {{with a knee}} injury, and Karthik was given a spot purely as a batsman following the poor form of Suresh Raina and Mohammad Kaif. Karthik <b>had</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> batting for Tamil Nadu in the previous season in the Ranji Trophy, {{as well as for}} South Zone in the Duleep Trophy. Playing in three of the ODIs, Karthik himself struggled, with 42 runs at an average of 14.00, and a top score of 17 as South Africa took a 50 whitewash.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, another front <b>had</b> <b>opened.</b> <b>The</b> Exarchate of Africa under Heraclius the Elder had revolted against Phocas. The {{situation}} in 609–610 was quickly becoming dire for Domentziolus and all Phocas loyalists. Their {{defense against the}} Sassanids had failed. There were Persian forces in Mesopotamia, Armenia, Syria and the Anatolian provinces. Rebel Byzantine forces held Africa and Egypt. Slavs were occupying northern Illyricum. In Thessalonica and various towns of Anatolia and Syria, the Blues and Greens were settling their differences with open conflict. In areas of Syria, the Jews were revolting and lynching Christians. Even in Constantinople, the crowds taunted Phocas for his love of liquor, implying alcoholism.|$|E

Metrovision, the area's economic development chamber, stated that they had secured guarantees for purchasing suites, season tickets and club seating from businesses to the extent that there was a waiting list for suites. Also a relocation to St. Louis, under the same conditions as with Laurie, was considered.|$|E
5|$|On {{its return}} to England the {{expedition}} was coolly received by London's geographical establishment which was resentful of the pre-emption {{of a role}} they envisaged for their own National Antarctic (Discovery) Expedition. There were also questions about Borchgrevink's leadership qualities, and criticism of the limited amounts of scientific information which the expedition provided. Despite the groundbreaking achievements in Antarctic survival and travel, Borchgrevink was never accorded the heroic status of Scott or Shackleton, and his expedition was soon forgotten in the dramas which surrounded these and other Heroic Age explorers. However, Roald Amundsen, conqueror of the South Pole in 1911, acknowledged that Borchgrevink's expedition had removed the greatest obstacles to Antarctic travel, and <b>had</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> way for all the expeditions that followed.|$|E
5|$|One {{important}} reason for BCal's interest in Concorde was that the British Government's 1976 aviation policy review <b>had</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> possibility of BA setting up supersonic services in competition with BCal's established sphere of influence. To counteract this potential threat, BCal considered their own independent Concorde plans, {{as well as a}} partnership with BA. BCal were considered most likely to have set up a Concorde service on the Gatwick–Lagos route, a major source of revenue and profits within BCal's scheduled route network; BCal's Concorde task force did assess the viability of a daily supersonic service complementing the existing subsonic widebody service on this route.|$|E

5|$|The 256,300 man strong U.S. First Army, {{commanded}} by General Courtney Hodges, {{was ordered to}} break through the Siegfried Line around the area of Aachen, in order to reach the Rur river. Although the First Army began to encircle the area around Aachen in early September, the Battle of Aachen did not end until 21 October. The city cost the Americans roughly 3,000 casualties, but <b>had</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> path to the Rur (river) river. Despite the casualties taken the ground gained was comparatively worthless, and the fighting for Aachen had not necessarily brought German defeat any closer.|$|E
5|$|The Liverpool and Manchester Railway <b>had</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> {{previous}} year, {{and proved}} a remarkable success in abstracting traffic from the parallel canal, {{and indicated that}} longer distances, not merely feeders to a harbour or from a colliery, could be dealt with, and everywhere business people were considering where a railway might advantageously be built next.

5|$|Arriving to Olot, most of Juigné's force took {{positions}} {{inside the}} convent of El Carme, while 90 Swiss {{soldiers of the}} rear entrenched themselves inside the hospital of the village. While the Swiss troops promptly surrendered, {{the bulk of the}} French column, with Juigné himself, still held for two hours. The miquelets and peasants encircled the building and managed to open a gap in its walls, only to be repelled in the hand-to-hand fight, losing two men killed and one wounded. Sala's men then breached the wall of a chapel and stormed the convent again, but as the French were well clustered within, the assault was as well repelled. Sala ordered to set on fire the gates of the building, but the French walled the gap using stones and bricks. The Catalans managed to enter the building by setting on fire large amounts of pitch and sulfur on the two breaches they <b>had</b> <b>opened.</b> <b>The</b> fire and the smoke blinded and choked the French soldiers, which retreated to the convent's cloister. After that, Juigné, seriously wounded during the fight, requested terms and surrendered.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1927 season, Yorkshire secretary Frederick Toone approached Wilfred Rhodes to suggest that he should resign from his position as senior professional. Rhodes declined, prompted by his wife's suspicion of a plot against him. This may have been an attempt by Yorkshire to clear the way for a new captain. Lord Hawke was in favour of appointing Herbert Sutcliffe, a professional who <b>had</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> batting for Yorkshire since 1919. In addition to Rhodes, other professionals on the side had debuted for Yorkshire earlier than Sutcliffe. However, Sutcliffe was unusual among professionals: he had received a commission in the British Army in the First World War, his appearance was always immaculate and when speaking he altered his accent to fit what he considered a better class of society. Such characteristics were more common among amateur cricketers, and Sutcliffe in many ways behaved like one. While not particularly popular with his teammates, he was respected.|$|E
5|$|Dortmund {{were drawn}} against Copenhagen of Denmark {{in the third}} round and won the first leg 1–0 away from home with Heiko Herrlich scoring in injury time. The second leg {{produced}} the same result, this time, Jan-Derek Sørensen scored in the 89th minute to secure Dortmund a place in the fourth round. In the fourth round, Dortmund were drawn against Lille of France, who had also joined the UEFA Cup, after finishing third in their Champions League group. Dortmund played the first leg away from home and got an away goal, after a 1–1 draw. Dortmund <b>had</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> scoring in the 67th minute when Ewerthon scored after a rebound, though the lead only lasted five minutes as Salaheddine Bassir scored a half-volley on 72 minutes to tie the game 1–1, going into the second leg in Dortmund. In a rain-soaked second leg at the Westfalenstadion, the match finished in a 0–0 draw, meaning Borussia went through to the quarter–finals on the away goals rule.|$|E
5|$|In {{the midst}} of the upheaval, the new Palladium <b>had</b> <b>opened.</b> <b>The</b> Senators, still coached by Allison, lost their opening game in the arena 3–0 to Montreal on January 17, 1996. The event was much more subdued than their franchise's first game. The Cup banners were raised, but the winches jammed, {{blocking}} the view of many fans. There were no entertainment big names, and only Firestone and Bryden participated in the ceremonial face-off. The club would lose its first four games at the Palladium, winning none for Allison, who was later fired on January 24 after the team lost 22 of 25 games. While Ottawa finished last in the League for the fourth year in a row, the 1995–96 season ended with renewed optimism, partly from the debut of new star Daniel Alfredsson, who won the Calder Trophy, the NHL rookie of the year award, the first Senator to do so. Alfredsson, selected 133rd overall in 1994, was also selected to play in the 1996 NHL All-Star Game.|$|E

5|$|Tom Dollery {{was called}} into the team after a run of heavy scoring for Warwickshire on {{difficult}} pitches at Edgbaston. He had made two centuries and seven fifties in 12 first-class matches for the season. Batsman Charlie Barnett was dropped after scoring only eight and six in the First Test. Joe Hardstaff junior was also left out; he had scored a duck and 43 in the First Test, and had a toe infection, so the selectors were spared the predicament of deciding whether to drop him on performance grounds. With Wright in for Young, and Coxon selected {{in place of a}} specialist batsman, England had a more attacking bowling line-up, something the retired Australian Test leg spinner Bill O'Reilly praised. He also thought the selection of Coxon was beneficial, as his swing bowling would ease the workload of batsman Bill Edrich, who <b>had</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> bowling in the previous Test. O'Reilly regarded Edrich as a mediocre bowler and thought the extra burden with the ball was detracting from his main duty, batting.|$|E
5|$|Finucane {{continued}} to the pedestrian gate where he stabbed the officer controlling the gate, and two officers {{who had just}} entered the prison. This incident was seen by a soldier on duty in a watch tower, who reported to the British Army operations room {{that he had seen}} prison officers fighting. The operations room telephoned the prison's Emergency Control Room (ECR), which replied that everything was all right and that an alarm had been accidentally triggered earlier. At 4:12 pm the alarm was raised when an officer in the gatehouse pushed the prisoner holding him hostage {{out of the room and}} telephoned the ECR. However, this was not done soon enough to prevent the escape. After several attempts the prisoners <b>had</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> main gate, and were waiting for the prisoners still in the gatehouse to rejoin them in the lorry. At this time two prison officers blocked the exit with their cars, forcing the prisoners to abandon the lorry and make their way to the outer fence which was 25 yards away. Four prisoners attacked one of the officers and hijacked his car, which they drove towards the external gate. They crashed into a car near the gate and abandoned the car. Two escaped through the gate, one was captured exiting the car, and another was captured after being chased by a soldier. At the main gate, a prison officer was shot in the leg while chasing the only two prisoners who had not yet reached the outer fence. The prisoner who fired the shot was captured after being shot and wounded by a soldier in a watch tower, and the other prisoner was captured after falling. The other prisoners escaped over the fence, and by 4:18 pm the main gate was closed and the prison secured, after 35 prisoners had breached the prison perimeter. The escape was the biggest in both British and Irish history, and the biggest in Europe since World War II.|$|E
5|$|In June 2008, Rhodes {{returned}} to League Two, {{when he signed}} a one-year deal with Rotherham United, after their manager Mark Robins was impressed by Rhodes' performance against them the previous season. Rotherham were deducted 17points {{at the start of}} the 2008–09 season because of improperly exiting administration. They started the season with a 1–0 against Lincoln City, in which Rhodes made his debut before he was substituted in the second half. He scored his first goal for Rotherham in a League Cup first round tie against local rivals Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough on 12 August 2008. Rhodes' goal game only seconds after Wednesday <b>had</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> scoring, before the game finished 2–2. Rotherham eventually won through to the second round on penalties. His first league goal for the club came less than two weeks later as Rotherham beat Chester City 3–1 to maintain their winning start to the season. Rhodes was a regular in the Rotherham side {{at the start of the}} season as the team overhauled their point deduction to go above Grimsby Town in the league, but he was dropped for a game against his former side Bradford City in November 2008. He briefly {{returned to}} the side the following month for a Football League Trophy area semi-final with Darlington, which Rotherham won on penalties, but did not play again until the two sides met once more in a league game at the end of January 2009.|$|E
