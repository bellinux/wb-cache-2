5|$|Following the urgings of Superintendent George {{and various}} {{official}} enquiries, new workshops were built to provide increased useful employment for prisoners. The western workshops, located between the entry complex and the Female Division, were built from 1900–1901 of squared limestone rubble with openings dressed in brick. An open saw-tooth roof with southern skylights covered the five spaces {{designed for the}} five traditional workshops: tailors, bookbinders, shoemakers, mat makers and painters. The two northern shops were later amalgamated by removing the <b>dividing</b> <b>wall.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{tower was}} {{constructed}} sometime between the Dissolution and the Union of the Crowns but the exact date is not known. It was probably constructed {{as a strong}} room to store munitions or provide a secure location if the city walls were breached. This turned the ground floor room into a lock up where troublesome citizens would be thrown until they came before the law to be punished. Much about the tower has changed. The wall {{to the right of}} the door is 13th-century, while the <b>dividing</b> <b>wall</b> including the door is 18th-century.|$|E
5|$|There are prehistoric fort sites at promontories near Kilmory, Papadil and Glen Shellesder of {{uncertain}} date. These primarily {{consist of}} a wall dividing the promontory {{from the rest of}} the island, but at Kilmory, there is also a rampart with a hollow containing the traces of an interior structure. At Shellesder, the promontory contains the remains of three round stone-walled huts, one of which integrates with the <b>dividing</b> <b>wall.</b> A small number of cairns, again of uncertain date, are also located along the coast.|$|E
40|$|<b>Divided</b> <b>wall</b> {{column and}} {{reactive}} distillation have many advantages. If a <b>divided</b> <b>wall</b> column and a reactive distillation are integrated, they {{leads to a}} higher integrated process is a reactive <b>divided</b> <b>wall</b> column. However reactive <b>divided</b> <b>wall</b> column has still a new research area. First of all, the thesis proposed a procedure for design of <b>divided</b> <b>wall</b> column, which based on the FUGK model. Both technological and hydrodynamic aspects in the <b>divided</b> <b>wall</b> column are considered in the procedure. Design parameters are then provided to the rigorous simulation and optimization in the ProSimplus software. In order to test this procedure, both ideal and non-ideal ternary mixtures are chosen to be separated in a <b>divided</b> <b>wall</b> column. The {{results show that the}} procedure can determine parameters quickly in the case studies and can give a good initialization for rigorous simulation. Secondly, a pilot plant has been design, built and operated in our laboratory (LGC, Toulouse, France, 2013). The pilot plant will provide necessary experimental evidence to validate the previous procedure. Ternary mixture and four-component mixture of alcohols have been used in our pilot plant in steady state conditions. The results show that the composition of products, composition and temperature profile along the column are in very good agreement with simulation results. Finally, a conceptual design method for reactive <b>divided</b> <b>wall</b> column is presented. The pre-design method of R. Thery et al., (2005) and a modified shortcut method for reactive <b>divided</b> <b>wall</b> column that is based on the classical shortcut adapted to a non-reactive <b>divided</b> <b>wall</b> column by C. Triantafyllou and R. Smith (1992) are applied. To verify, simulation and experiment are considered. The methodology has been illustrated for the synthesis of Methyl Acetate from Methanol and Acetic Acid...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{describes}} {{about the}} simulation and design study of <b>divided</b> <b>wall</b> distillation columns using various mathematical models. Since {{all of us}} are aware, that distillation is the fundamental aspect of separation processes in the Chemical industries. In the current thesis, simulation studies of the <b>divided</b> <b>wall</b> distillation column using various mathematical models are presented. Steady state simulations are being performed using Thomas mathematical model supported by rigorous programming using combination of MATLAB which is the fundamental programming language In the steady state simulation we have tried to see the effect of changing the number of plates on the component mole fraction, vapor flow rate, liquid flow rate, Temperature etc., which gives an idea about the optimum number of plates in the <b>divided</b> <b>wall</b> distillation column. The basic input variables used are tear variables i. e. temperature and vapor flow rate. Firstly, MESH equations has been written for an equilibrium stage in a multi-component vapor liquid cascade. Those equilibrium stages can be combined to form a counter-current cascade of N equilibrium stages {{that can be used to}} model <b>divided</b> <b>wall</b> distillation column. Then the mathematical model of tri-diagonal matrix algorithm has been applied to solve the MESH equations. And then rigorously solving countercurrent-flow, multi-equilibrium stage, multi-component separation system with the help of Thomas algorithm and with the help of a process simulator. And thereby by rigorous programming and continuous simulation it predicts optimum number of plates alongside implementation of controllability factors could be implemented for feasible operation of <b>divided</b> <b>wall</b> distillation column. Thus, designing of <b>divided</b> <b>wall</b> distillation column must be encouraged in chemical industries reducing two important parameters cost and energy to a great extent thereby enhancing profitability of the industries to a great extent...|$|R
5|$|The 17th-century room, S2, {{used the}} south {{wall of the}} {{existing}} structure as its own north wall, and was largely built using materials salvaged from S1, although the standard of the work was poorer. The new room had a double fireplace, {{but there was no}} evidence of a <b>dividing</b> <b>wall</b> between the two hearths. Limestone blocks, identical to the quoins in S1, were used as structural and decorative features in the fireplace. In addition to the pantiles taken from S1, there were Cornish slate roof tiles. Whether they formed part of the roof of S2 or were associated with the possible wooden extension is unclear.|$|E

25|$|In 1959 during Dr. Theodore G. Lilley’s pastorate, {{the church}} merged with First United Presbyterian Church. With this church, which {{stood on the}} {{north-east}} corner of Summer St. and Richmond Ave. additional gifts for expansion became available; this was realized in 1968, during the pastorate of Dr. Arthur W. Mielke, D.D. The sanctuary underwent additional modifications, this time, the chancel was extended, the communion table enlarged by the same craftsmen that carved the original table, the pulpit and lectern were also redesigned, and the <b>dividing</b> <b>wall</b> in the chancel was removed to reduce congestion.|$|E
25|$|Atrial septal defect (ASD) is a {{congenital}} heart {{defect in}} which blood flows between the atria (upper chambers) of the heart. Normally, the atria {{are separated by}} a <b>dividing</b> <b>wall,</b> the interatrial septum. If this septum is defective or absent, then oxygen-rich blood can flow directly {{from the left side}} of the heart to mix with the oxygen-poor blood in the right side of the heart, or vice versa. This can lead to lower-than-normal oxygen levels in the arterial blood that supplies the brain, organs, and tissues. However, an ASD may not produce noticeable signs or symptoms, especially if the defect is small.|$|E
25|$|Later, {{the public}} bars {{gradually}} improved until sometimes almost {{the only difference}} was in the prices, so that customers could choose between economy and exclusivity (or youth and age, or a jukebox or dartboard). With the blurring of class divisions in the 1960s and 1970s, {{the distinction between the}} saloon and the public bar was often seen as archaic, and was frequently abolished, usually by the removal of the <b>dividing</b> <b>wall</b> or partition. While the names of saloon and public bar may still be seen on the doors of pubs, the prices (and often the standard of furnishings and decoration) are the same throughout the premises, and many pubs now comprise one large room. However the modern importance of dining in pubs encourages some establishments to maintain distinct rooms or areas.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: As a {{combination}} of <b>divided</b> <b>wall</b> column (DWC) and reactive-distillation column, the reactive <b>divided</b> <b>wall</b> distillation column is a highly complex technology that reaction and separation can occur simultaneously, which can reduce the energy consumption and decrease the costs of captial and operation. This new process was simulated with PRO software and mini plant experiments were implemented. In addition, we investigated the influences of reflux ratio, liquid distribution ratio and molar ratio of ester in water on the conversion rate of methyl acetate and {{the purity of the}} product respectively. It could be seen that the trend from experiments was suitable with simulation results...|$|R

25|$|Between 1956 and 1960 St Peter's {{underwent}} further restoration {{in which}} the tower and nave were re-roofed. St Catherine's Chapel and the nave were refurbished and a large mural of the Ascension by Burrows which covered the wall over the tower arch was painted over. The church was also substantially re-ordered, and the high altar and sanctuary area brought forward under the tower crossing. The wooden 15th-Century rood screen which separated the nave from the crossing was painted and gilded in a medieval style, {{and a set of}} twelve carved figures which had been added in the early 19th century were also painted and mounted higher up the screen. The screen was backed with oak and re-mounted {{on the back of the}} new sanctuary area to form a reredos behind the altar, also serving as a <b>dividing</b> <b>wall</b> with the old chancel area which was converted into a vestry area.|$|E
25|$|At {{the site}} of the church, prior to its construction, there was a three-nave early Christian basilica. There are {{references}} to its creation as a monastery church, which Friedrich Hiller von Gaertringen already pursued in 1900. Due to frequent rebuilding activities, however, no archaeological evidence remains of the monastery. Walls and other elements of the preexisting buildings were used in the church, among others the four strong pillars which carry the central dome, as well as part of the eastern wall, left and right of the apse. The current <b>dividing</b> <b>wall</b> between the nave and the narthex was in fact the original western wall of the basilica. The entrance to the nave, with marble doorposts, was the entrance of the original building. The larger entrance on the northern side was probably reused as spolia. Various parts of the building show evidence of the use of spolia from ancient Thera, a city on the Mesa Vouno, a foothill of the Profitis Ilias. Among these are the Doric pillars with capitals and bases, a number of architraves, round altars and carved bull heads.|$|E
500|$|The <b>dividing</b> <b>wall</b> {{was removed}} by parish members on 7March 1995, while others started {{clearing}} the truss. The institute called the police, OMON, for help. The following day, more {{conflict with the}} police occurred and several parish members, among them a nun, were injured. Others were arrested, including a priest and a seminarian, but were released the next day. After these events, the Apostolic Administrator, Tadeusz Kondrusiewicz, wrote {{an open letter to}} the Russian President, Boris Yeltsin, on 9March 1995, requesting his intervention: [...] "It seems that persecution of the church was history. Is that the case? I can't remember seeing a priest arrested, and I can't remember seeing a nun beaten up." ...|$|E

500|$|Jerusalem was {{captured}} by the Crusaders in 1099, during the First Crusade. They named the mosque [...] "Solomon's Temple", distinguishing it from the Dome of the Rock, which they named Templum Domini (Temple of God). While the Dome of the Rock {{was turned into a}} Christian church under the care of the Augustinians, the al-Aqsa Mosque was used as a royal palace and also as a stable for horses. In 1119, it was transformed into the headquarters of the Templar Knights. During this period, the mosque underwent some structural changes, including the expansion of its northern porch, and the addition of an apse and a <b>dividing</b> <b>wall.</b> A new cloister and church were also built at the site, along with various other structures. The Templars constructed vaulted western and eastern annexes to the building; the western currently serves as the women's mosque and the eastern as the Islamic Museum.|$|E
500|$|At {{the same}} time that S2 was built, a <b>dividing</b> <b>wall,</b> again of {{inferior}} quality, was built across S1 to create a western room. There were no molehills within the smaller building, which had suggested that, unlike its neighbour, it has a buried solid floor, and this was confirmed by excavation. This had a floor originally made of mortar, relaid at least once, but then covered with a layer of flint cobbles, suggesting that it was a working area. The old hearth was not covered, so it may have still been used. A new fireplace was also added, apparently of a domestic design, although the context makes that function improbable. A well-marked track led southwest down the slope from S1, and a large midden was close to the path. It has been suggested that a [...] "clean" [...] pit north of S1 was a well, with fresh water floating above the saltwater below, a phenomenon known from Blakeney Point and elsewhere on the Norfolk coast.|$|E
