According to AllMusic's Cyril Cordor, {{she was one}} of the UK's premier singers during the 2000s; [...] "fans and critics alike <b>embraced</b> <b>her</b> rugged charm, brash sense of humor, and distinctively soulful and jazzy vocals". In The Guardian, Caroline Sullivan later wrote that [...] "her idolisation of Dinah Washington and the Ronettes distinguished her from almost all newly minted pop singers of the early 2000s; her exceptionally-susceptible-to-heartbreak voice did the rest".|$|E

The singer noted the game's visual aesthetics and storyline as a major influence towards the songwriting, and felt the finished versions would lead up to the ending version of the track—which appears during the credits of the video. Utada <b>embraced</b> <b>her</b> second appearance with Kingdom Hearts II as she felt the experience was better than [...] "Hikari", which she believed was uneasy to accomplish because of the [...] "soulless" [...] vibe the game has portrayed; though she believed the visual appearance was [...] "crucial", the singer based her thinking process on the characters personalities instead. In a special interview with Oricon Style in December 2005, the singer explained the process: ...|$|E
500|$|In {{tandem with}} her studies under Moriarty, in 1919 Fortune had been {{initiated}} into the London Temple of the Alpha et Omega, an occult {{group that had}} developed from the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. Here, her primary teacher was Maiya Curtis-Webb, a longstanding friend of the Firth family. Fortune later claimed that in the period after the First World War, the Order had been [...] "manned mainly by widows and grey-bearded ancients". She was not enamoured with the ceremonial magic system that had been developed by the Golden Dawn, however it did provide her with the grounding {{in the study of}} the Hermetic Qabalah which would exert a great influence over her esoteric world-view. It was also through her involvement in the group that she <b>embraced</b> <b>her</b> family's [...] "Deo, non Fortuna" [...] as her personal magical motto. In January and March 1921 Fortune and Curtis-Webb embarked on a series of experiments in trance mediumship. This culminated in an act of trance mediumship that Fortune conducted in the Somerset town of Glastonbury with her mother and Frederick Bligh Bond. She claimed that in doing so, she had contacted spirit-entities known as [...] "the Watchers of Avalon" [...] who informed her that Glastonbury had once been the site of an ancient druidic college. Bond subsequently commissioned Fortune to write an article, [...] "Psychology and Occultism", which was published in the transactions of the College of Psychic Science in 1922.|$|E
500|$|R {{singer and}} friend Brandy {{said about the}} late singer [...] "She came out before Monica and I did, she was our inspiration. At the time, record {{companies}} {{did not believe in}} kid acts and it was just inspiring to see someone that was winning and winning being themselves. When I met her I <b>embraced</b> <b>her,</b> I was so happy to meet her." [...] Rapper Drake said that the singer has had the biggest influence on his career. He also has a tattoo of the singer on his back. Solange Knowles remarked on the tenth anniversary of her death that she idolized Aaliyah and proclaimed that she would never be forgotten. Adam Levine, the lead vocalist of the pop rock group Maroon 5, remembers that listening to [...] "Are You That Somebody?" [...] convinced him to pursue a more soulful sound than that of his then-band Kara's Flowers. Erika Ramirez, associate editor of Billboard.com, said at the time of Aaliyah's career [...] "there weren't many artists using the kind of soft vocals the ways she was using it, and now {{you see a lot of}} artists doing that and finding success," [...] her reasoning for Aaliyah's continued influence on current artists. She argued that Aaliyah's second album One in a Million was [...] "very much ahead of its time, with the bass and electro kind of R sounds that they produced", referring to collaborators Timbaland and Missy Elliott and that the sound, which [...] "really stood out" [...] at its time, was being replicated.|$|E

500|$|Several critics {{praised the}} {{development}} of Santana. Hankinson wrote, [...] "My goodness, Santana. It's {{as if all the}} writers sat around a room, identified the best lines of tonight's episode and then decided to give them all to Santana. Fantastic." [...] VanDerWerff called Santana the highlight of the episode: [...] "The best thing about this episode is Naya Rivera's work as Santana and the story the three writers have cooked up for her. Rivera's really come into her own this season, going from just a generic bitchy cheerleader to an actual character who has motivations and might be a better villain for the show than Sue." [...] He added, [...] "the storyline of Santana realizing {{she was in love with}} Brittany and, thus, is probably a lesbian has been nicely plotted and surprisingly deep. The reveal about Santana hasn't washed away her less savory qualities; indeed, it's heightened them, to a degree, as she struggles to be true to herself and still maintain her status as the hottest girl in school." [...] Jenna Mullins of E! Online wrote of Santana, [...] "This episode just cemented my love for her. The insult spew in the beginning of the episode was awesomely mean." [...] She also said that Santana's [...] "inner monologue is often more entertaining than other characters' outer monologues". CNN Lisa Respers France considered Santana the episode's highlight, and went on to write, [...] "She <b>embraced</b> <b>her</b> inner lesbian (sort of) and rattled off the best [...] like 'the only straight I am is straight-up [...]' You gotta love that." ...|$|E

2500|$|Two {{early twentieth-century}} novels shaped {{much of the}} public {{perception}} of Sacagawea.

The National American Woman Suffrage Association <b>embraced</b> <b>her</b> as a female hero, and numerous stories and essays about her appeared in ladies' journals. A few decades later, Grace Raymond Hebard published Sacajawea: Guide and Interpreter of Lewis and Clark (1933) to even greater success.|$|E

2500|$|Creator Darren Star has {{commented on}} the character's progression. In his DVD {{commentary}} of the episode [...] "Spring Dance", Star notes Kelly's first attempt to romance Brandon Walsh, in which she'd <b>embraced</b> <b>her</b> role as Spring Princess and used a largely forward and aggressive approach. He goes on to state that in the fourth season, when Kelly was prone to expressing her affections in a more gentle and compassionate manner, she made a greater impression on Brandon. While pursuing Jake on Melrose Place, a confused Kelly eventually asks, [...] "Don't you think I'm pretty?" [...] This contrasts with her attitude one year later, when she becomes more interested in having others appreciate her for what lies beneath the surface. This development is standardized one additional year later, via her aforementioned second pursuit of Brandon Walsh, which ends in success.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1960s and 1970s a new {{generation}} of pacifists, feminists, and civil rights advocates found inspiration in Rankin, and <b>embraced</b> <b>her</b> efforts in ways that her own generation had not. [...] The Vietnam War mobilized her once again. In January 1968, the Jeannette Rankin Brigade, a coalition of women's peace groups, organized an anti-war march in Washington, D.C.—the largest march by women since the Woman Suffrage Parade of 1913. [...] Rankin led five thousand participants from Union Station to the steps of the Capitol Building, where they presented a peace petition to House Speaker John McCormack. [...] Simultaneously, a splinter group of activists from the women's liberation movement created a protest within the Brigade's protest by staging a [...] "Burial of True Womanhood" [...] at Arlington National Cemetery {{to draw attention to the}} passive role allotted to women as wives and mothers. In 1972, Rankin—by then in her nineties—considered mounting a third House campaign to gain a wider audience for her opposition to the Vietnam War, but longstanding throat and heart ailments forced abandonment of that final project.|$|E

[...] and wagered $4,401 of her $10,000, giving her a $1 lead over Jennings with his response still to be revealed. Jennings incorrectly responded with [...] "What is FedEx?", and lost {{the game with a}} final score of $8,799 after his $5,601 wager was deducted from his score. After his response was revealed to be incorrect, the audience audibly gasped. [...] He was awarded $2,000 for his second-place finish, which gave him a final total of $2,522,700 for his run on Jeopardy!. Zerg, whom Jennings called a [...] "formidable opponent", finished in third place on the next show.

As Lü Bu flees, Dong Zhuo chases him and hurls a spear at him, but misses. On the way, Dong Zhuo meets his advisor, Li Ru, who suggests to him to let Lü Bu have Diaochan, so as to win Lü's trust. Dong Zhuo goes back to Diaochan later and accuses her of betraying his love, saying that he intends to present her to Lü Bu.

2500|$|Williams hired {{producer}} Keith Crouch and R group Somethin' for the People to {{work with}} Norwood, and within eight months the team crafted Brandy. A collection of street-oriented rhythm-and-blues with a hip hop edge, whose lyrical content <b>embraced</b> <b>her</b> youthful and innocent image in public, Norwood later summed up the songs on the album as young and vulnerable, stating, [...] "I didn’t really know a lot—all I {{wanted to do was}} basically sing. You can just tell that it’s a person singing from a genuine place, and also a place of basically no experience. I was singing about being attracted to the opposite sex, but I had no experience behind it." [...] Released in September 1994, the album peaked at number twenty on the U.S. Billboard 200. Critical reaction to Brandy was generally positive, with AllMusic writer Eddie Huffman declaring Brandy [...] "a lower-key Janet Jackson or a more stripped-down Mary J. Blige [...] with good songs and crisp production." [...] Anderson Jones of Entertainment Weekly asserted, [...] "Teen actress Norwood acts her age. A premature effort at best, that seems based on the philosophy 'If Aaliyah can do it, why can't I?'." ...|$|E

Jean made on March 8, 2007, her first visit to Canadian troops taking part in the offensive in Afghanistan; she had earlier expressed her desire to go, but Harper advised against such a trip on the grounds of security concerns, the relevance of which were demonstrated when two attacks were made against Canadian soldiers on the same day the Governor General landed in Kabul. Jean had the arrival timed specifically for International Women's Day, stating: [...] "the women of Afghanistan may face the most unbearable conditions, but they never stop fighting for survival. Of course, we, the rest of the women around the world, took too long to hear the cries of our Afghan sisters, but I am here to tell them that they are no longer alone. And neither are the people of Afghanistan." [...] Part of the Governor General's itinerary included meeting with Afghan women, Canadian soldiers, Royal Canadian Mounted Police teams, humanitarian workers, and diplomats.|$|E
