5|$|There {{were three}} schools in Middlewich in the mid-19th century: the British School in Newton Bank; the National School in Cow Lane (Brooks Lane); and the Grammar School, {{close to the}} site of the largest tesco store. A Church of England school was erected in Lewin Street in 1854 and {{extended}} in 1871. It soon became known as the National School, with the result that the earlier school was demolished. The later National School was itself demolished in the 1980s and is the site of the Salinae <b>Day</b> <b>Care</b> <b>Centre,</b> opened in 1995. At the turn of the 20th century two new schools were built: St Mary's Catholic school, whose keystone was laid in 1899 by Col. France-Hayhurst, and the secondary school, opened by France-Hayhurst in 1906. At the start of the 21st century there were seven schools in Middlewich: one infant, one junior, four primary schools and one secondary school. Cledford Primary School tends to accept students from the South of the town. It has now amalgamated With Cledford Infant And Nursery School. Middlewich Primary School caters for children from the older, northern, part of the town, whilst St Mary's Catholic Primary School receives Catholic children from the town. Work began on the original buildings for the secondary school, Middlewich High School, in 1906, with later additions improving the teaching areas and providing a sports hall which could also be used by the wider community. The school opened on 1 November 1906. In 2007 it was ranked 34 out of 50 by GCSE results for schools in Cheshire in the 2007 league tables. Byley Primary School and Wimboldsley Community Primary School serve children from outside the immediate bounds of the town.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This essay investigates what {{knowledge}} {{members of}} staff in <b>day</b> <b>care</b> <b>centres</b> for grown up people with disabilities have about Alternative and Augmentative Communication, AAC (in Swedish, Alterantiv och Kompletterande Kommunikation, AKK). <b>Day</b> <b>care</b> <b>centres</b> are working places {{for people with disabilities}} who do not have the possibility, caused of their disability, to work in ordinary works in the open market. To communicate with other people is a human right for all people even if you have a disability, even if you don’t have a spoken language or if you, because of your disability, have difficulties to understand a spoken language. When you don’t have a spoken language you need different ways to be able to communicate, make choices and take part in activities in the community. People with disability are supported, in their communication with other people, if they meet people, teachers and professionals in their grown up lives, who have knowledge of, and know how to use, AAC. To be able to understand others and {{be able to have a}} communication with other people, you can use specific AAC. These consist of pictures, computers, sign language or other equipment that support or replace the spoken language in contact with family, friends or staff in the daily working centre. In my essay I wanted to find out if and which AAC were used in the <b>day</b> <b>care</b> <b>centres</b> in a medium sized community in Sweden. For my investigation I used a questionnaire send to all 60 persons working in 20 <b>day</b> <b>care</b> <b>centres.</b> The main questions concerned if the staff were familiar with AAC, and in that case - what kinds of AAC were used in the <b>day</b> <b>care</b> <b>centres</b> and for what purpose. This essay is based on 44 answers. The AAC that were most known and used together with the disabled persons in the groups in the <b>day</b> <b>care</b> <b>centres</b> were Pictogram and supportive sign language...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} the physical activity-related policies and practices of childcare services; and to determine if service size, socioeconomic or remoteness characteristics predict such policies and practices. Methods: Authorized supervisors of 216 licensed pre-schools and long <b>day</b> <b>care</b> <b>centres</b> participated in a brief telephone survey. Results: Few services had a written physical activity policy, programmed time each day for fundamental movement skill development, or had staff trained in physical activity. Twenty-eight percent of pre-schools and 30 % of long <b>day</b> <b>care</b> <b>centres</b> provided daily opportunities for children 3 – 5 years to participate in sedentary screen activities. Rural pre-schools and long <b>day</b> <b>care</b> <b>centres</b> were more likely to program time for fundamental movement skills development, as were pre-schools from higher socioeconomic areas. Conclusions: There is substantial scope for childcare services to modify their policies and practices to be more supportive of child physical activity...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{community-based}} Meeting Centres Support Programme {{for people}} with dementia and their carers has been proven more effective in influencing behaviour and mood problems of people with dementia and improving sense of competence of carers compared to nursing home-based <b>day</b> <b>care</b> <b>centres</b> {{for people with}} dementia. Six Dutch nursing home-based <b>day</b> <b>care</b> <b>centres</b> were transformed into Community-based <b>day</b> <b>care</b> <b>centres</b> with carer support, according to this Meeting Centres model. Objectives: To determine which factors facilitate or impede the transition to Community-based <b>day</b> <b>care.</b> Design: A process evaluation was conducted with a qualitative study design. Settings: Six nursing home-based <b>day</b> <b>care</b> <b>centres</b> transformed into Community-based <b>day</b> <b>care</b> <b>centres</b> for people with dementia and their carers. Study participants: Stakeholders (n = 40) that were involved during the transition. Methods: Factors that facilitated or impeded the transition were traced by means of (audiotaped and transcribed) interviews with stakeholders and document analysis. All data were coded by two independent researchers and analyzed using thematic analysis based on the Theoretical framework of adaptive implementation. Results: Six nursing home-based <b>day</b> <b>care</b> <b>centres</b> successfully made the transition to Community-based <b>day</b> <b>care</b> with carer support. Success factors {{for the start of}} the project were: the innovation being in line with the current trend towards more outpatient care and having motivated pioneers responsible for the execution of the transition. Barriers were difficulties reaching/recruiting the target group (people with dementia and carers), inflexible staff and little or no experience with collaboration with community-based care and welfare organizations. Facilitating factors during the implementation phase were: finding a suitable location in the community, positive changes in staff attitude and adoption of the new vision, and good cooperation with care and welfare organizations. Barriers were insufficient involvement of, and support from the managers of the responsible organizations, and communication problems with referrers of other organizations, including the GPs and case managers. Conclusions: The transition from nursing home-based psychogeriatric <b>day</b> <b>care</b> support to a community-based combined support programme for people with dementia and their informal carer is shown to be feasible. Successful implementation of this community-based combined support programme requires - besides motivated pioneers, a change in staff attitude and working style, a suitable pleasant location and collaboration with other care and welfare organizations - special attention for effective communication with the target user group and the referrers, and also how the management of the pioneer organizations can facilitate the staff during the transition process...|$|R
