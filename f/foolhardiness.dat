500|$|Readers {{and critics}} have {{described}} Tintin as a well-rounded yet open-ended, intelligent and creative character, noting that his rather neutral personality—sometimes labelled as bland—permits a balanced {{reflection of the}} evil, folly, and <b>foolhardiness,</b> which surrounds him. [...] The character never compromises his Boy Scout ideals, which represent Hergé's own, and his status allows the reader to assume his position within the story, rather than merely following the adventures of a strong protagonist. Tintin's iconic representation enhances this aspect, with Scott McCloud noting that it [...] "allows readers to mask themselves in a character and safely enter a sensually stimulating world." ...|$|E
2500|$|Season 2 {{opened with}} the 5-episode mini-series Arise, Serpentor, Arise! in which {{elements}} of Cobra, disillusioned by Cobra Commander, decide to literally {{create a new}} leader to replace him. Acting as an operation to create a super-soldier, Cobra agents are sent {{around the world to}} collect DNA samples retrieved from the tombs of history's most notorious despots to genetically craft Cobra Commander's successor, Serpentor, who immediately assumes charge of Cobra and deposes the erstwhile Commander to the status of [...] "lackey." [...] Fortunately for the Commander, G.I. Joe managed to interfere with the gene collection to deny Serpentor the critical inclusion of Sun Tzu's DNA, and it is instead replaced with Sgt. Slaughter's. The absence of that influence and the addition of Sgt. Slaughter's DNA makes Serpentor prone to impulsive <b>foolhardiness,</b> which shows during a full-scale attack on Washington, D.C. Cobra Commander is able to rescue the high command from certain disaster, and slyly saves himself by convincing Serpentor that he truly needs him as a scapegoat.|$|E
6000|$|... "Courage," [...] he continued--George {{had quite}} a gift for maxims--"courage is the wisdom of manhood; <b>foolhardiness,</b> the folly of youth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, {{you will}} not have the <b>foolhardiness</b> to decline, now that the {{question}} has actually been popped, I should hope,' said Louis, when he had done reading.|$|E
6000|$|What {{a strange}} notion Ben must have formed of a determined, remorseless, all-daring, <b>foolhardiness,</b> to have {{represented}} {{it in such}} a mouthing Tamburlane, and bombastic tonguebully as this Cethegus of his! ...|$|E
6000|$|At {{the end of}} {{the half}} hour we {{discussed}} the advisability of [...] "chancing it," [...] but decided not to. [...] "We should never," [...] George said, [...] "confound <b>foolhardiness</b> with courage." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well." [...] Withers's gray glance was kind, {{if it did}} {{express the}} <b>foolhardiness</b> of Shefford's act. [...] "Come into the house.... Never mind the horse. My wife will sure be glad to see you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't {{explain it}} to you," [...] I replied, which was true, [...] "but to set sail in this wind would be the height of <b>foolhardiness,</b> and I care for you too much, dear, to expose you to {{unnecessary}} risks." ...|$|E
60|$|Coming {{from within}} as I did, I found myself behind the blacks, and, without waiting to even {{calculate}} their numbers or the <b>foolhardiness</b> of my venture, I charged swiftly across the chamber and fell upon {{them from the}} rear with my keen long-sword.|$|E
60|$|Everybody urges {{him not to}} be reckless, but he {{persists}} in his <b>foolhardiness,</b> and goes up to the Yellow Chamber (or whatever colour the haunted room may be) with a light heart and a candle, and wishes them all good-night, and shuts the door.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not altogether, my friend. My faith! 'twas on only <b>foolhardiness</b> {{caused me}} to grant that devilish {{prosecutor}} another sight of my scarlet device. I knew what you maniacs would be after, so I came across in the Daydream,just to see if I couldn't get my share of the fun." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Rashness and rebellion!" [...] muttered Myndert: [...] "but this <b>foolhardiness</b> {{will one}} day bring as pretty a {{brigantine}} as ever sailed in the narrow seas, to condemnation; and then will there be rumors abroad, and characters cracked, till every lover of gossip in the Americas shall be tired of defamation." ...|$|E
60|$|Mose wore a set {{and serious}} look as he {{approached}} the frenzied beast. There was danger in this trick--a broken leg or collar bone might make his <b>foolhardiness</b> costly. In his mind's eye he could foresee the broncho's action. He had escaped down the track once, and would do the same again after a few desperate bounds--nevertheless Mose dreaded the terrible concussion of those stiff-legged leapings.|$|E
60|$|To {{return to}} our unwelcome visitors. On this {{occasion}} my father's perfectly cool smiling demeanour, resulting from his <b>foolhardiness,</b> served him and the house well: it deceived them, for they {{could not believe that}} he would have acted in that way if they had not been watched by men with rifles in their hands from the interior who would open fire on the least hostile movement on their part.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{that is the}} point. Now I {{say nothing}} about your pursuits. I am very glad you should have them, and be an {{intelligent}} lad; but they must not be taken up exclusively, so as to drive out all heed to anything else. Remember, {{there is a great}} difference between courage and <b>foolhardiness,</b> and that you are especially warned to be careful if your venturesomeness endangers other people's lives." ...|$|E
60|$|Of course I said I {{would go}} with my mother, {{and of course they}} all cried out at our <b>foolhardiness,</b> but even then not a man would go along with us. All they would do was to give me a loaded pistol lest we were attacked, and to promise to have horses ready saddled in case we were pursued on our return, while one lad was to ride forward to the doctor's in search of armed assistance.|$|E
6000|$|... "This is idle {{and romantic}} talk, Pathfinder, and ye'll no {{maintain}} it yourself when ye come to meditate on the realities. I hope ye'll no' gainsay the loyalty or {{the courage of}} the 55th, and I feel convinced that a council of war would decide on the propriety of a surrender forthwith. Na, na, Pathfinder, <b>foolhardiness</b> is na mair like the bravery o' Wallace or Bruce than Albany on the Hudson is like the old town of Edinbro'." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's rather {{better than}} I hoped from you," [...] nodded the Easterner, approvingly. [...] "The other meaning is that Buckley never {{goes into a}} fight without giving away weight. He seems to dread taking the {{slightest}} advantage. That's quite close to <b>foolhardiness</b> when {{you are dealing with}} horse-thieves and fence-cutters who would ambush you any night, and shoot you in the back if they could. Buckley's too full of sand. He'll play Horatius and hold the bridge once too often some day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My Lord of Pembroke will allow, however, that I {{did come}} in time," [...] said Sir John. [...] "It {{was his own}} {{presumption}} and <b>foolhardiness</b> that got him into the scrape, and he was none the worse for the lesson he received. But this young fellow seems to have met with this mischance by no fault of his own; and I am willing to see him righted; for {{he is a good}} lad as well as a brave, as far as I have known him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Tis not amiss. [...] To {{keep the}} new year up they run away! [...] [He soliloquizes as he begins tearing open the dispatches.] [...] Nor Pitt nor Fox {{displayed}} such blundering [...] As glares in this campaign! It is, indeed, [...] Enlarging Folly to <b>Foolhardiness</b> [...] To combat France by land! But how expect [...] Aught that can claim the name of government [...] From Canning, Castlereagh, and Perceval, [...] Caballers all--poor sorry politicians-- [...] To whom has fallen the luck of reaping in [...] The harvestings of Pitt's bold husbandry.|$|E
60|$|Perceiving the <b>foolhardiness</b> of {{the little}} vessel, the Spanish {{commander}} determined {{to give it a}} lesson which would teach its captain to understand better the relative power of great vessels and little ones, so, as soon as the pirates' vessel was near enough, he ordered a broadside fired upon it. The Spanish ship had a great many people on board. It had a crew of seventy men, and besides these there were some passengers, and regular marines, and knowing that the captain had determined to fire upon the approaching vessel, everybody had gathered on deck to see the little pirate ship go down.|$|E
60|$|Colonel Egerton entered on {{the duties}} of his {{dangerous}} undertaking with the indifference of <b>foolhardiness.</b> The game was played with tolerable ability by both parties; but no emotions, no absence of mind could be discovered {{on the part of}} the gentleman. Feet and hands were in motion; still the colonel played as well as usual; he had answers for all Jane's questions, and smiles for his partner; but no check-mate could she obtain, until wilfully throwing away an advantage he suffered the lady to win the game. The dowager was satisfied nothing could be done with the colonel.|$|E
60|$|I {{caught his}} idea. He thought I had fallen {{deliberately}} {{in order to}} spill my water and go back for more. This rivalry between us was a serious matter--so serious, indeed, that I immediately took advantage {{of what he had}} imputed and raced back to the spring. And Jed Dunham, scornful of the bullets that were puffing dust all around him, stood there upright in the open and waited for me. We came in side by side, with honours even in our boys' <b>foolhardiness.</b> But when we delivered the water Jed had only one pailful. A bullet had gone through the other pail close to the bottom.|$|E
60|$|Mindful of which, {{and also}} that his {{repetition}} in America was that of headlong <b>foolhardiness</b> rather, and want of brain not of heart, Charles Lameth does, on the eleventh day of November, with little emotion, decline attending some hot young Gentleman from Artois, come expressly to challenge him: nay indeed he first coldly engages to attend; then coldly permits two Friends to attend instead of him, and shame the young Gentleman out of it, which they successfully do. A cold procedure; satisfactory to the two Friends, to Lameth and the hot young Gentleman; whereby, one might have fancied, the whole matter was cooled down.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wonder whether}} he sleeps at night, {{when he thinks}} such a man as I am after his life. And I allow him, to boot, all his walks and hiding-places." [...] Then Ada began to implore him {{not to be too}} rash. She endeavoured to teach him that no good could come from such <b>foolhardiness.</b> If his life was of no value to himself, it was of great value to others;--to his mother, for instance, and to his sister. [...] "A man's life is of no real value," [...] said the Captain, [...] "until he has got a wife and family--or at any rate, a wife." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, you'll no' harm a friend, Pathfinder, I'm certain; and that's my security. You're {{a man of}} judgment, {{and have}} gained too great a name on this {{frontier}} for bravery to feel the necessity of <b>foolhardiness</b> to obtain a character. You'll very well understand, my good friend, there is as much credit {{to be gained by}} submitting gracefully, when resistance becomes impossible, as by obstinately holding out contrary to the rules of war. The enemy is too strong for us, my brave comrade, and I come to counsel you to give up the block, on condition of being treated as a prisoner of war." ...|$|E
60|$|There {{were but}} few lights in sight at sea, {{for even the}} {{coasting}} steamers, which usually hug the shore so closely, kept well to seaward, and but few fishing boats were in sight. The only sail noticeable was a foreign schooner with all sails set, which was seemingly going westwards. The <b>foolhardiness</b> or ignorance of her officers was a prolific theme for comment whilst she remained in sight, and {{efforts were made to}} signal her to reduce sail in the face of her danger. Before the night shut down she was seen with sails idly flapping as she gently rolled on the undulating swell of the sea.|$|E
60|$|So far he {{had been}} wonderfully lucky. The <b>foolhardiness</b> with which he had exposed his life {{and that of his}} friends by {{wandering}} about the streets of Paris at this hour without any attempt at disguise, though carrying one under his arm, had not met with the untoward fate which it undoubtedly deserved. The darkness of the night and the thin sheet of rain as it fell had effectually wrapped his progress through the lonely streets in their beneficent mantle of gloom; the soft mud below had drowned the echo of his footsteps. If spies were on his track, as Jeanne had feared and Blakeney prophesied, he had certainly succeeded in evading them.|$|E
60|$|By {{the middle}} of December I had {{mastered}} all the greater stars in my region, and with my spyglass a few even of the Gammas and Deltas. But much of the zenith and all the north was closed to me, and--such is human greed--I began to pine beyond measure for a sight of Deneb, Vega, and the Chair. This desire grew unendurable, and led me into a piece of genuine <b>foolhardiness.</b> I determined to await the first clear still night and then to sally out and make my way, by hook or crook, up to my beech-roots, from which I {{should be able to}} command a fair stretch of the northern heavens. A quiet spell favoured me.|$|E
60|$|Suppose he were boldly {{to enter}} the room on {{the left of the}} passage. Would the mere fact of his having been {{admitted}} to the house be sufficient? Perhaps a further password would be required, or, at any rate, some proof of identity. The doorkeeper clearly did not know {{all the members of the}} gang by sight, but it might be different upstairs. On the whole it seemed to him that luck had served him very well so far, but that there was such a thing as trusting it too far. To enter that room was a colossal risk. He could not hope to sustain his part indefinitely; sooner or later he was almost bound to betray himself, and then he would have thrown away a vital chance in mere <b>foolhardiness.</b>|$|E
60|$|All {{this time}} Alan {{would not leave}} me though I often pressed him, and indeed his <b>foolhardiness</b> in staying was a common subject of outcry with {{the two or three}} friends that were let into the secret. He hid by day in a hole of the braes under a little wood; and at night, when the coast was clear, would come into the house to visit me. I need not say if I was pleased to see him; Mrs. Maclaren, our hostess, thought nothing good enough for such a guest; and as Duncan Dhu (which was the name of our host) had a pair of pipes in his house, and was much of a lover of music, this time of my {{recovery}} was quite a festival, and we commonly turned night into day.|$|E
6000|$|The squire {{was far too}} {{beaten and}} bruised by the rocks to make a second attempt against those resistless breakers. Indeed, Le Neve brought him ashore more dead than alive, {{bleeding}} from a dozen wounds on the face and hands, and with the breath almost failing in his battered body. They laid {{him down on the}} beach, while the fishermen crowded round him, admiring his pluck, though they deprecated his <b>foolhardiness,</b> for they [...] "knowed the squire couldn't never live ag'in it." [...] But Le Neve, still full of the reckless courage of youth, and health, and strength, and manhood, keenly alive now to the peril of Cleer's lonely situation, never heeded their forebodings. He dashed in once more, just as he stood, clothes and all, in the wild and desperate attempt to stem that fierce flood and swim across to the island.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{sat down}} on a bank of grass," [...] Marlow went on. [...] "She had given me a turn. The hem of her skirt seemed to float over that awful sheer drop, she was so close to the edge. An absurd thing to do. A {{perfectly}} mad trick--for no conceivable object! I was reflecting on the <b>foolhardiness</b> of the average girl and remembering some other instances of the kind, when she came into view walking down the steep curve of the road. She had Mrs Fyne's walking-stick and was escorted by the Fyne dog. Her dead-white face struck me with astonishment, so that I forgot to raise my hat. I just sat and stared. The dog, a vivacious and amiable animal which for some inscrutable reason had bestowed his friendship on my unworthy self, rushed up the bank demonstratively and insinuated himself under my arm.|$|E
60|$|This was {{certainly}} the end for both of us, I thought. How I cursed the cowardice of the neighbours; how I blamed my poor mother for her honesty and her greed, for her past <b>foolhardiness</b> and present weakness! We were just at the little bridge, by good fortune; and I helped her, tottering as she was, {{to the edge of}} the bank, where, sure enough, she gave a sigh and fell on my shoulder. I do not know how I found the strength to do it at all, and I am afraid it was roughly done, but I managed to drag her down the bank and a little way under the arch. Farther I could not move her, for the bridge was too low to let me do more than crawl below it. So there we had to stay--my mother almost entirely exposed and both of us within earshot of the inn.|$|E
60|$|Helen settled {{herself back}} upon the stone, leaned a very little against his shoulder, {{and tried to}} think over her adventure. But her mind refused to {{entertain}} any ideas, except those of the present. Mingled with the dreamy lassitude that grew stronger every moment, was a sense of delight in her situation. She was alone on a wild mountain, in the night, with this borderman, the one she loved. By chance and her own <b>foolhardiness</b> this had come about, yet she was fortunate to have it tend to some good beyond her own happiness. All she would suffer from her perilous climb would be aching bones, and, perhaps, a scolding from her father. What she might gain was more than she had dared hope. The breaking up of the horse-thief gang would be a boon to the harassed settlement. How proudly Colonel Zane would smile! Her name would go on that long roll of border honor and heroism. That was not, however, one thousandth part so pleasing, as to be alone with her borderman.|$|E
60|$|The {{instructions}} {{given to}} Major Grant were merely to reconnoitre {{the country in}} the neighborhood of Fort Duquesne, and ascertain the strength and position of the enemy. He conducted the enterprise with the <b>foolhardiness</b> of a man eager for personal notoriety. His whole object seems to have been by open bravado to provoke an action. The enemy were apprised, through their scouts, of his approach, but suffered him to advance unmolested. Arriving at night in the neighborhood of the fort, he posted his men on a hill, and sent out a party of observation, who set fire to a log house near the walls and returned to the encampment. As if this were not sufficient to put the enemy on the alert, he ordered the reveille to be beaten in the morning in several places; then, posting Major Lewis with his provincial troops at a distance in the rear to protect the baggage, he marshalled his regulars in battle array, and sent an engineer, with a covering party, to take a plan of the works {{in full view of the}} garrison.|$|E
