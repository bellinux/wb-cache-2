50|$|The {{common name}} comes from the <b>gum</b> <b>veins</b> in the wood.|$|R
30|$|In the {{intensity}} range 350 kW m− 1 to 1700 kW m− 1 some slight physical damage to eucalypt and coniferous species occurs. Some ultimate branchlets on more fire sensitive eucalypts may be killed and occasional log degrade {{in the form}} of <b>gum</b> <b>veins</b> may occur.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} Australian hardwoods, E. obliqua is often sold with E. regnans (Mountain Ash) as [...] "Vic Ash" [...] or [...] "Tasmanian oak". It is slightly denser that E. regnans - estimates of density range from 720 kg/m3 to 830 kg/m3 - and harder too. The sapwood is pale brown, the heartwood light brown. It has an even texture, with straight grains sometimes interlocked, and well-defined rings. <b>Gum</b> <b>veins</b> are common.|$|R
40|$|Processing Australian {{hardwood}} plantations into rotary veneer {{can produce}} more acceptable marketable product recoveries compared to traditional processing techniques (e. g. sawmilling). Veneers resulting from processing trials from six commercially important Australian hardwood species {{were dominated by}} D-grade veneer. Defects such as encased knots, <b>gum</b> pockets, <b>gum</b> <b>veins,</b> surface roughness, splits, bark pockets, and decay impacted the final assigned grade. Four grading scenarios were adopted. The first included a change to the grade limitations for gum pockets and <b>gum</b> <b>veins,</b> while the second investigated {{the potential impact of}} effective pruning on grade recovery. Although both scenarios individually had a positive impact on achieving higher face grade veneer qualities, the third and fourth scenarios, which combined both, had a substantial impact, with relative veneer values increasing up to 18. 2 % using conservative calculations (scenario three) or up to 22. 6 % (scenario four) where some of the upgraded veneers were further upgraded to A-grade, which attracts superior value. The total change in veneer value was found to depend on the average billet diameter unless defects other than those relating to the scenarios (gum or knots) restricted the benefit of pruning and gum upgrading. This was the case for species prone to high levels of growth stress and related defects...|$|R
50|$|A {{significant}} commercial species, blackbutt is well {{regarded by}} foresters {{for the high}} quality of timber, easy regeneration and quick growth. Uses include making poles, railway sleepers, flooring, building framework, cladding, joinery, lining boards, furniture, woodchipping and decking. Wood density is about 900 kg per cubic metre. The sapwood is resistant to attack by lyctus borers, the heartwood is yellowish brown to light brown. Coarse textured, fairly straight grained, common small <b>gum</b> <b>veins.</b> Hard, strong, tough but not particularly difficult to work. Slow drying of mid to good levels of durability. Blackbutt timber {{is used in the}} flooring of Parliament House, Canberra.|$|R
50|$|It is {{a medium}} weight timber (about 680 kg/m³) and rather coarse (stringy) in texture. <b>Gum</b> <b>veins</b> are common. The wood {{is easy to}} work and the grain is {{straight}} with long, clear sections without knots. The wood works reasonably well for steam-bending.Primary uses for sawn wood are furniture, flooring (where its very pale blonde colour is highly prized), panelling, veneer, plywood, window frames, general construction. The wood has sometimes been used for wood wool and cooperage. However, the wood needs steam reconditioning for high value applications, due to a tendency to collapse on drying. This wood is highly regarded by builders, furniture makers and architects.|$|R
25|$|Movement {{of water}} {{takes place in}} these passageways in any direction, {{longitudinally}} in the cells, as well as laterally from cell to cell until it reaches the lateral drying surfaces of the wood. The higher longitudinal permeability of sapwood of hardwood is generally caused {{by the presence of}} vessels. The lateral permeability and transverse flow is often very low in hardwoods. The vessels in hardwoods are sometimes blocked by the presence of tyloses and/or by secreting gums and resins in some other species, as mentioned earlier. The presence of <b>gum</b> <b>veins,</b> the formation of which is often a result of natural protective response of trees to injury, is commonly observed on the surface of sawn boards of most eucalypts. Despite the generally higher volume fraction of rays in hardwoods (typically 15% of wood volume), the rays are not particularly effective in radial flow, nor are the pits on the radial surfaces of fibres effective in tangential flow (Langrish and Walker, 1993).|$|R
40|$|The {{anatomy of}} 56 wood samples {{representing}} 11 native species of Eugenia s. str. was studied. Wood structure {{is described in}} detail with emphasis on the taxonomic value of qualitative and quantitative characteristics. Features observed in most samples include: wood diffuseporous; pores solitary; perforation plates simple; vestured pits in vessel elements of Van Vliet’s type B; vascular and vasicentric tracheids; fibre tracheids with vestured pits; axial parenchyma apotracheal; rays heterogeneous type I and II; ray-vessel pitting small and rounded; chambered axial parenchyma cells with prismatic crystals enclosed by a thick lignified sheath; intracellular deposits of tanniniferous substances; starch grains hollow; no visual distinction between heartwood and sapwood. Pith flecks were occasionally present and limited gummosis of pith fleck parenchyma resulted {{in the formation of}} <b>gum</b> <b>veins.</b> Crystalliferous chains in pith flecks resemble those of the secondary phloem. The wood anatomy of the species studied largely resembles that of Eugenia {{in other parts of the}} world and is quite distinct from that of Syzygium. No single characteristic or combination of characteristics could be found to be diagnostic at species level. Features that might be useful to distinguish between some species are average pore diameter and lack of tannin in ray cells...|$|R
