The parties' interests may always be better protected by applying a law conceived with international realities in mind. The Hague Conference on Private International Law is a treaty organization that oversees conventions designed to develop a uniform system. [...] The deliberations of the conference have recently {{been the subject of}} controversy over the extent of cross-border jurisdiction on electronic commerce and defamation issues. There is a general recognition {{that there is a need}} for an international law of contracts: for example, many nations have ratified the Vienna Convention on the International Sale of Goods, the Rome Convention on the Law Applicable to Contractual Obligations offers less specialized uniformity, and there is support for the UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts, a private restatement, all of which represent continuing efforts to produce international standards as the internet and other technologies encourage ever more interstate commerce. But other branches of the law are less well served and the dominant trend remains the role of the forum law rather than a supranational system for Conflict purposes. Even the EU, which has institutions capable of creating uniform rules with direct effect, has failed to produce a universal system for the common market.

40|$|This study {{addresses}} the taxation issues arising from a cross-border pipeline. The first element that is addressed is the different possible classifications of a pipeline for tax purposes. The {{fact that the}} Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) {{does not provide a}} universal classification for a cross-border pipeline, leaves tax authorities in the various <b>jurisdictions</b> <b>to</b> <b>interpret</b> and classify the pipeline as they see fit. This lack of consistent classification may give rise to double taxation or even double non-taxation. The study explores the definition of a permanent establishment (“PE”) and analyses the elements of the definition in terms of the OECD Model Tax Convention (“MTC”) and the OECD Commentary on Article 5. In this study the assumption is made that the classification of a cross-border pipeline is that it falls within the ambit of Article 5 and should therefore be treated as a PE. If the cross-border pipeline is classified as a PE for taxation purposes the attribution of profits arising from the PE will be attributed in terms of Article 7 of the OECD MTC. In the study the attribution of profits relating to the PE created by the presence of a cross-border pipeline in various jurisdictions is analysed. The attribution of such profits can result in difficulties in determining the exact amount attributable to each of the jurisdictions which the pipeline spans. The author considers the OECD Reports (2008 and 2010 Reports) on the Attribution of Profits to Permanent Establishments to comment on whether the reports provide adequate guidance for attributing profits to such a unique situation as that of a cross-border pipeline. It is also addressed whether the attribution of profits to a cross-border pipeline can be dealt with under the general principles of attribution. Case law is also considered, in particular, the German Pipeline Decision which determined whether an underground pipeline can constitute a PE under German domestic law and under the DTA between the Netherlands and Germany. In the conclusion research indicates that there is room for development and further guidance from the OECD in its MTC and Commentary as this is a unique and potentially complex situation that cannot be placed under general provisions or left unaddressed. The current lack of guidance can result in different classifications of the cross-border pipeline which effectively results in adverse tax consequences in different <b>jurisdictions</b> and uncertainty <b>to</b> the taxpayer.

40|$|One of {{the legal}} {{mechanisms}} that {{have contributed to the}} strengthening of EU law in relation to national legal systems is the reference for preliminary rulings. Essentially, in this proceeding, the national court refers a question and the Court of Justice of the European Union, in a preliminary ruling, answer on the interpretation of EU law. Through these binding decisions with a jurisdictional nature, the European judge not only ensures an official interpretation of EU law but an uniformity of application. Unlike ordinary law court activity, where the object of judgment is a fact that is related to a rule of law, in a preliminary judgment, the object of judgment is the interpretation of EU law provision. Similarly, a national constitutional court acts, it being the only competent authority to interpret the Constitution of a State; from this perspective, the Court of Justice of the European Union is a true “European constitutional court” because it has the exclusive <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>to</b> <b>interpret</b> Community law.

40|$|From the Introduction. The {{principle}} of conferral of powers occupies a prominent place in the Lisbon Treaty. Not only is it stated as a fundamental and horizontal principle in the common provisions of the Treaty on the European Union (Art. 5 TEU). 2 For the first time utmost care {{has been given to}} lay down, in a Treaty text, also the modalities and the consequences of the application of this principle. 3 As such, a catalogue of competence is introduced in Articles 2 - 6 TFEU which lists the “categories and areas of union competence” (Title I TFEU) whilst spelling out the nature of the competences conferred to the Union in those fields, for instance exclusive, shared or complementary. Moreover, it is recurrently and firmly stated that powers which are not conferred to the Union by the Treaties are to remain with the Member States (a. o. Arts. 4 (1) & 5 (2) TEU). Especially those new additions in the Treaties are revealing of the currently prevailing political context whereby the Member States seek to get a renewed grasp on the formulation, interpretation and application of the Treaty {{principle of}} conferral. This can hardly be considered in isolation from the development of case law of the CJEU, who deftly asserts exclusive <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>to</b> <b>interpret</b> this key structural principle of EU law...|$|E
40|$|In case C- 533 / 08 TNT Express, the Court of Justice {{interpreted}} Article 71 of Regulation 44 / 2001 (the Brussels Regulation) {{which provides}} that the Regulation ‘shall not affect any conventions {{to which the}} Member States are parties and which in relation to particular matters, govern jurisdiction or the recognition or enforcement of judgments’. The Court held that the provision must be interpreted as including the implied condition that the specialised conventions referred to can only apply {{to the extent to}} which they do not undermine the ‘underlying principles’ of the Brussels Regulation, including the principles of mutual trust and free movement of judgments. The Court also found that it had no <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>to</b> <b>interpret</b> the specialised convention at issue in this case. The judgment is important for the development of private international law in the EU and for the EU as a locus for the development of private international law, regionally and globally. The Court has effectively decided that certain principles which underlie the policy field are constitutional in nature and non-derogable even where the legislature has chosen to limit the scope of harmonisation and thus the degree of uniformity in the Union system and to leave space to an international regime. Thus certain choices in the creation of the area of freedom, security and justice are removed from the political agenda.

40|$|This {{sequel to}} the authors 2 ̆ 7 2007 article, Fugacious 1, follows the same outline and {{considers}} the same topics as the original article while considering the major developments since Fugacious 1 was published. Whereas Fugacious 1 was a basic primer on Arkansas oil and gas law, this article supplements the development of Arkansas oil and gas law {{over the last five}} years through an overview of the litigation concerning the Fayetteville Shale Play. Specifically, the article expands on those topics covered by Fugacious 1 needing revision or supplementation, while simply noting as such the sections where no revision or supplementation is necessary. The authors begin their supplementation by considering the ownership of natural gas found within coal formations and conclude that a coal owner may vent coal-bed methane away from its operations pursuant to safe mining practices while owing nothing to the gas owner for the gas lost as a result thereof. However, the coal owner may not capture and sell the coal-bed methane without the gas owner 2 ̆ 7 s permission. Next, the article discusses two recent Arkansas Court of Appeals cases considering reservation language in reservation deeds. The article then discusses the evolution of the Strohacker doctrine in Arkansas, concluding that the area where evidence of knowledge of oil and gas as mineral is relevant is not precisely limited to the county containing the lands. The authors then consider problems with severing minerals, and Arkansas 2 ̆ 7 Duhig doctrine, a bright line rule of property regarding mineral interests which applies to warranty deeds but not to quit-claim deeds. The authors examine a recent case where their opinion from Fugacious 1, that every purported tax forfeiture of a severed mineral interest for a tax year prior to 1986 was void for failure of the tax assessors in Arkansas 2 ̆ 7 s various counties to properly subjoin mineral assessments to surface assessments of the same lands prior to 1985 legislation, which removed the subjoinder requirement, was proven correct. The authors discuss ingress and egress, and a recent Arkansas Supreme Court holding where the Court found that Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission 2 ̆ 7 s General Rule B- 42 requires express permission to conduct seismic testing despite the tester 2 ̆ 7 s ingress and egress right. Regarding oil and gas leases, the authors provide a thorough analysis of the revised Ark. Code Ann. § 15 - 73 - 701 and its implications to the oil and gas business. The authors finish their supplementation with a discussion of implied covenants in leases and the prudent operator standard codified in Ark. Code Ann. § 15 - 73 - 701, the Rule of Capture, and the Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission 2 ̆ 7 s <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>to</b> <b>interpret</b> contracts. In conclusion, the article notes that as this area of the law continues to develop and generate complex litigation, more issues are sure to sure to arise in the years to come...|$|E
40|$|It {{was assumed}} {{in the mid}} 1990 s that 60 % of all global trade took place within a group of enterprises. With {{increased}} globalisation leading {{to an increase in}} mergers and acquisitions this figure is most likely higher. Thus intra-company and intra-group transactions form a major part of business. These transactions, due to the association between the enterprises, may not always reflect the conditions that a market with independent actors would dictate. There are various reasons for this, which include not only tax considerations but also difficulties in establishing conditions that reflect those that inde-pendent companies would apply, in other words conditions in accordance with the arm’s length principle. In cases where these conditions are not in accordance with what the state considers as an arm’s length price, the profits of the enterprise located in that state may be adjusted for taxation purposes under transfer pricing provisions. The complexity of transfer pricing rules and the various methods for establishing an arm’s length price result in different interpretations and increased uncertainty for multinational enterprises that often face different rules for determining a correct transfer price. Therefore, enterprises may often face transfer pricing adjustments of their profits due to the complexity and differences in transfer pricing legislation. Transfer pricing adjustments potentially lead to unresolved double taxation, in fact business reports have indicated that 42 % of the transfer pricing adjustments lead to double taxation. Therefore it is imperative to have legal mechanisms that resolve potential double taxation. The Convention on the Elimination of Double Taxation in Connection with the Adjustment of Profits of Associated Enterprises (Arbitration Convention) was adopted to give the multinational enterprises, facing double taxation due to adjustments of their profits, a remedy that obliged the states to resolve the double taxation. This was the first, and is still the only, EC-wide mechanism that technically guarantees that transfer pricing double taxation is resolved and thus holds a great improvement over other existing mechanisms to resolve double taxation. The Arbitration Convention was originally a proposed EC Directive but was transformed into a intergovernmental convention. This has resulted in that the European Court of Justice (ECJ) has no <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>to</b> <b>interpret</b> the Arbitration Convention or its application. Furthermore there is no supranational or international organ that could take action against states that interpret or apply the Conven-tion in an unintended manner. The chosen legal form has also resulted in different interpretations as to what status the Arbitration Convention has compared to bilateral tax conventions, and thus whether it precedes them. This could prove troublesome when future bilateral treaties are concluded or where there already exist tax treaties that have different solutions to transfer pricing related double taxation. The risk of the Convention being interpreted differently is greatly increased by the various undefined terms and lack of precise provisions in the Convention. Therefore, the Convention has been subject to an inconsistent application and interpretation from the date it came into effect in 1995. The Convention was only given a five year life span, after which it was destined to be renewed if the contracting states so expressed, involving the same ratification process as at the initial acceptation of the Convention. However, as this was inefficient, a Prolongation Protocol was signed to amend the Convention with an automatic extension of its life. As it took till 2004 for this Protocol to be ratified and finally enter into force on 1 November 2004 it created one of the main interpretation and application differences {{in the life of the}} Convention. The function of the Convention’s procedures and thus its efficiency in resolving double taxation is impeded by the numerous interpretation differences and lack of precise pro-visions in the Convention. The fact that there is no way to guarantee that the provisions of the Convention are precisely followed, partly since there are uncertainties regarding the precise interpretation but also partly since there is no organ that could enforce a uniform application of the Convention, further impedes the efficiency of the Convention, which is clearly seen in practice. Another question of interpretation and application raised is that, although the Convention was originally intended as a means for resolving transfer pricing related double taxation, there have been arguments that the Convention could apply to double taxation due to provisions concerning thin capitalisation as well. These provisions bring about similar conditions as those the Convention requires for its applicability and, although a different area of law, the connections in the conditions are many and undeniable...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{three areas}} in which there have been important developments concerning the automatic stay of the U. S. Bankruptcy law, provided by 11 U. S. C. § 362.

The second topic is whether a state court has <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>to</b> impose sanctions for an alleged violation of the stay.
