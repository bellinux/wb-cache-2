40|$|Anthropogenic {{alterations}} to Iowa’s landscape {{have greatly}} altered lotic systems with consequent {{effects on the}} biodiversity <b>of</b> freshwater fauna. <b>Ictalurids</b> are {{a diverse group of}} fishes and play an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems. However, little is known about their distribution and status in lotic systems throughout Iowa. The {{purpose of this study was}} to describe the distribution <b>of</b> <b>ictalurids</b> in Iowa and examine their relationship with ecological integrity of streams and rivers. Historical data (i. e., 1884 – 2002) compiled for the Iowa Aquatic Gap Analysis Project (IAGAP) were used to detect declines in the distribution <b>of</b> <b>ictalurids</b> in Iowa streams and rivers at stream segment and watershed scales. Eight variables characterizing ictalurid assemblages were used to evaluate relationships with index of biotic integrity (IBI) ratings. Comparisons of recent and historic data from the IAGAP database indicated that 9 <b>of</b> Iowa’s 10 <b>ictalurid</b> species experienced distribution declines at one or more spatial scales. Analysis of variance indicated that ictalurid assemblages differed among samples with different IBI ratings. Specifically, total ictalurid, sensitive ictalurid, and Noturus spp. richness increased as IBI ratings increased. Results indicate declining ictalurid species distributions and biotic integrity are related, and management strategies aimed to improve habitat and increase biotic integrity will benefit ictalurid species...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. —Ictalurids {{compose a}} {{substantial}} portion of the commercial harvest in the up-per Mississippi River (UMR). The purpose of this investigation was to examine spatial and temporal trends in commercial harvest <b>of</b> <b>ictalurids</b> in the UMR. The study focused on four species: channel catfi sh Ictalurus punctatus, fl athead catfi sh Pylodictis olivaris, blue catfi sh I. furcatus, and black bullhead Ameiurus melas. We described trends in yield and market value and evaluated the infl uence of numerous factors on commercial catfi sh harvest in Pools 3 – 26 of the UMR between 1953 and 2001. Spatial and temporal variations in commercial harvest of catfi sh appeared to be driven by different factors through time. Early factors included habitat loss and overexploitation, and later factors included loss of the market share and increased market competition with aquaculture. Ictalurids have maintained a consistent proportion of the total commercial harvest in the UMR, and decreases in catfi sh harvest may indicate larger declines in commercial fi shing...|$|R
40|$|The {{intestinal}} microbiome (IM) or {{the community of}} commensal and pathogenic microbes that inhabit the intestinal tract of fish has long been of interest in aquaculture because of its hypothesized role in nutrient digestion and fish immunity. Artificial improvement to the IM of fish with pre- and probiotics {{has been shown to}} have benefits in some studies; however, the mechanisms behind these supplements are poorly understood {{because of a lack of}} knowledge on the basic structure of the IM of fish. The research described here aims to characterize the IM of the highly studied and commercially important Icatlurid catfish, channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus and blue catfish I. furcatus. In this study we evaluated differences between the homeostatic IM, across genotype (Objective 1) and developmental ontogeny (Objective 2), using high-throughput sequencing of 16 S rRNA gene amplicons. We compared the IM of four selected strains of blue catfish and three selected strains of channel catfish at 193 days post-hatch (DPH) in Objective 1 (n = 40); while the influence of developmental ontogeny was evaluated by observing the IM of a single family of channel catfish at 3, 65, 125, and 193 DPH Objective 2 (n = 20). The bacterial phyla Fusobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria were detected in all fish strains and developmental time points; however, at the genus level the abundances of different bacteria varied among experimental units, as well as being rather variable between individuals. At 3 DPH (n = 5) the IM of channel catfish sac-fry larvae showed the most variation between individuals; with bacteria from the genus Bradyrhizobium dominating the IM of two sac-fry (84 % and 88 %), and Flavobacterium, Lactobacillus, Comamonadaceae dominating the IM of the remaining three sac-fry analyzed (86 %, 99 %, and 97 % respectively). The dominant bacteria in the gut of all other fish analyzed (n = 55), was Cetobacterium somerae (mean ± SD, 41. 4 % ± 36 %), a commensal microbe that is known to produce vitamin B 12. Statistical differences in the abundance of three different bacteria within the order Clostridiales (P ≤ 0. 039) were detected in Objective 1, with more of these OTUs inhabiting the gut of channel catfish than that of blue catfish. Statistical differences in the abundance of Edwardsiella, a genus of bacteria known to cause disease in catfish, were detected across the two species <b>of</b> <b>Ictalurid</b> catfish in Objective 1 (P = 0. 038), and across developmental ontogeny in Objective 2 (P = 0. 021); however, these bacteria were detected at low abundance (0. 002 % - 0. 004 %). Comparisons of beta diversity showed significant differences between many strains <b>of</b> <b>Ictalurids,</b> with a highly significant difference between channel catfish and blue catfish (P = 0. 001); however, few differences were detected when comparing beta diversity across the four time points over the first 193 DPH in Objective 2, with only 3 DPH and 125 DPH showing significant differences (P = 0. 022). Overall these data suggest host-genotype, and to a lesser extent developmental ontogeny, influence the structure of the IM <b>of</b> <b>Ictalurid</b> catfish. As the first study to be conducted on the IM of these fish species, these results have performance implications on the culture of these commercially important catfish, while also enhancing our basic knowledge on the dynamics of the fish microbiome...|$|R
40|$|Species {{introductions}} {{have been}} linked to the decline of native taxa, and in many cases have resulted in the elimination of native species in both terrestrial and aquatic systems throughout the United States. In aquatic systems, a particular threat is the introduction of large piscivorous fish that may alter the native fish community structure. For example, introductions <b>of</b> large <b>ictalurids</b> such as blue catfish, (lctalurus furcatus), and flathead catfish, (Pylodictus olivaris), into coastal Virginia rivers, including the James River twenty years ago have resulted in the establishment of these large, predatory fishes. This study described the trophic ecology <b>of</b> four <b>ictalurid</b> catfishes in the tidal James River, Virginia including the native white catfish (Ameiurus catus), the possibly introduced channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), and the recently introduced blue catfish and flathead catfish. The objectives of this study were to determine the trophic ecology of these four catfishes in a coastal Virginia river, and to assess the potential predatory effects of large, recently introduced piscivorous ictalurids on the native fish assemblage, and especially anadromous clupeid fishes. A stratified sample of 4, 164 catfish was taken throughout the tidal freshwater reach of the James River during the summer and fall, 1996 and spring, 1997. Stomach content analysis revealed that blue catfish and flathead catfish are highly piscivorous, feeding on several families of native fishes. Flathead catfish consumed over 90...|$|R

40|$|The venom glands of fishes {{represent}} a widespread, putatively adaptive antipredatory trait, which have received little attention relative {{to those of}} other venomous organisms. I review the literature for ecologically and evolutionarily relevant information regarding venomous fishes and find poor support for an adaptive hypothesis, {{due to the lack of}} empirical evidence for an antipredatory function of venom glands in most groups of venomous fishes. Additional information, including phylogenies for venomous groups, the phylogenetic distribution of venom glands within these groups, intra- and interpopulational variation in the presence and/or structure of venom glands, and the functional design of venom constituents is also found to be lacking. Using histological and toxicological assays, I demonstrate that 1250 - 1625 catfish species should be presumed to be venomous, nearly doubling estimates of venomous fish species diversity. Interfamilial comparisons of venom toxicity and composition indicate that a broad range of venom activities and constituents exist in catfish venoms, which character optimization analyses suggest has resulted from a limited number of independent evolutionary origins of venom glands in the order Siluriformes. Behavioral experiments demonstrate that the venom glands of the tadpole madtom (Noturus gyrinus) provide a significant antipredatory advantage relative to individuals lacking venom glands, supporting an adaptive hypothesis for venom glands in catfishes. The broader examination of venom toxicity and composition in 22 ictalurid species reveals significant variation in levels of venom toxicity, which appears to demonstrate correlated evolution with several aspects <b>of</b> <b>ictalurid</b> life history. Additional experiments demonstrate that the presence of venom glands can also influence the evolution of other aspects of a catfish species’ biology. A model predatory species (Micropterus salmoides) quickly became conditioned to avoid attacking catfishes possessing the distinctive color pattern displayed by Lake Tanganyikan Synodontis species, and were unable to distinguish between different Tanganyikan Synodontis species, supporting a hypothesis of Müllerian mimicry in this group. Statistical examinations of Synodontis phylogenetic history and modern species’ color patterns indicate that the color pattern conservatism seen in Lake Tanganyikan Synodontis is likely due to the protection provided by this color pattern, which is predicated on the defensive capabilities afforded by these species’ venoms...|$|R

Stomachs from the N. lachneri specimens were removed and the contents were identified to order. Frequency of occurrence of each taxon was compared between stomach contents and kick-net samples.

40|$|Abstract. — We applied Bayesian phylogenetics, {{divergence}} time estimation, diversification pattern analysis, and parsi-mony-based {{methods of}} ancestral state reconstruction {{to a combination}} of nucleotide sequences, maximum body sizes, fossils, and paleoclimate data to explore the influence of an extrinsic (climate change) and an intrinsic (maximum body size) factor on diversification rates in a North American clade of catfishes (Ictaluridae). We found diversification rate to have been significantly variable over time, with significant (or nearly significant) rate increases in the early history of Noturus. Though the latter coincided closely with a period of dramatic climate change at the Eocene-Oligocene boundary, we did not detect evidence for a general association between climate change and diversification rate during the entire history of Ictaluridae. Within Ictaluridae, small body size was found to be a near significant predictor of species richness. Morphological stasis of several species appears to be a consequence of a homoplastic increase in body size. We estimated the maximum stan-dard length <b>of</b> the <b>ictalurid</b> ancestor to be approximately 50 cm, comparable to Eocene ictalurids (Astephus) and similar to modern sizes of Ameiurus and their Asian sister-taxon Cranoglanis. During the late Paleocene and early Eocene, the ictalurid ancestor diversified into the lineages represented by the modern epigean genera. The majority of modern species originated in the Oligocene and Miocene, most likely according to a peripheral isolates model of speciation. We discuss the difficul-ties of detecting macroevolutionary patterns within a lineage history and encourage the scrutiny of the terminal Eocene climatic event as a direct promoter of diversification.

40|$|Phylogenetic {{relationships}} among herpesviruses (HVs) of mammals, birds, and reptiles {{have been studied}} extensively, whereas those among other HVs are relatively unexplored. We have reconstructed the phylogenetic {{relationships among}} 13 fish and amphibian HVs using maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses of amino acid sequences predicted from parts of the DNA polymerase and terminase genes. The relationships among 6 of these viruses were confirmed using the partial DNA polymerase data plus the complete sequences of the terminase, helicase, and triplex protein genes; the position of these viruses among all other sequenced HVs was also investigated using the complete terminase gene. The results established the monophyly of the fish and amphibian HVs (Alloherpesviridae) separate from the HVs of mammals, birds, and reptiles (Herpesviridae) and the single recognized HV of bivalve mollusks (Malacoherpesviridae) in the order Herpesvirales. Two major clades in the family Alloherpesviridae were recognized: one consisting of viruses from cyprinid and anguillid hosts and the other <b>of</b> viruses from <b>ictalurid,</b> salmonid, acipenserid, and ranid hosts.

40|$|A new myxosporean species, Henneguya eirasi n. sp., is {{described}} parasitizing the gill filaments of Pseudoplatystoma corruscans and Pseudoplatystoma fasciatum (Siluriformes: Pimelodidae) {{caught in the}} Patanal Wetland {{of the state of}} Mato Grosso, Brazil. The parasite formed white, elongated plasmodia measuring up to 3 mm. Mature spores were ellipsoidal in the frontal view, measuring 37. 1 +/- 1. 8 mu m in total length, 12. 9 +/- 0. 8 mu m in body length, 3. 4 +/- 0. 3 mu m in width, 3. 1 +/- 0. 1 mu m in thickness and 24. 6 +/- 2. 2 mu m in the caudal process. Polar capsules were elongated and equal in size, measuring 5. 4 +/- 0. 5 mu m in length and 0. 7 +/- 0. 1 mu m in width. Polar filaments had 12 - 13 coils. Histopathological analysis revealed that the parasite developed in the sub-epithelial connective tissue of the gill filaments and the plasmodia were surrounded by a capsule of host connective tissue. The plasmodia caused slight compression of the adjacent tissues, but no inflammatory response was observed in the infection site. Ultrastructure analysis revealed a single plasmodial wall connected to the ectoplasmic zone through numerous pinocytotic canals. The plasmodial wall exhibited numerous projections and slightly electron-dense material was found in the ectoplasm next to the plasmodial wall, forming a line just below the wall. Partial sequencing of the 18 S rDNA gene of H. eirasi n. sp. obtained from P. fasciatum resulted in a total of 1066 bp and this sequence did not match any of the Myxozoa available in the GenBank. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the Henneguya species clustering into clades following the order and family of the host fishes. H. eirasi n. sp. clustered alone in one clade, which was the basal unit for the clade composed of Henneguya species parasites <b>of</b> siluriform <b>ictalurids.</b> The prevalence <b>of</b> the parasite was 17. 1 % in both fish species examined.

40|$|From 1984 to 1986, the Arkansas Highway and Transportation Department reconstructed and {{upgraded}} {{a portion}} of St. Hwy. 123 west of St. Hwy. 7 at Pelsor, Arkansas. As {{a result of the}} construction, portions of Haw Creek, Johnson County, Arkansas, a third order stream in the Boston Mountains Ecoregion, were straightened and channelized. In reconstructing specific stream reaches, stream banks were riprapped and vegetated, gabions constructed and positioned, stream substrates and pool-riffle ratios altered. Instream and riparian habitat and fish biomass and diversity in altered reaches were radically altered. Channelized reaches became wide and shallow, lacking overstory cover and pools. Substrate particle size changed from boulder/rubble to rubble/gravel/sand and velocity increased. Fish communities in channeled reaches simple; Campostoma anomalum, Notropis boops, and Etheostoma spectabile accounted for more than 80 percent of all fish captured. This represented a shift from piscivore and insectivorepiscivore to herbivore and insectivore dominated feeding guilds. Natural channel reaches had more complex fish communities and greater abundance <b>of</b> centrarchids and <b>ictalurids,</b> primarily deeper water groups. Immediately after channelization, altered reaches had a larger biomass than natural reaches (0. 43 - 0. 26 g/m^ 2). The summer following alteration, channeled segments were basically dewatered, and biomass decreased dramatically (0. 06 - 0. 1 1 g/m^ 2).

40|$|Over {{the last}} 3 decades, {{freshwater}} aquaculture {{has become one}} of the most important food industries. However the constant introduction of a reduced number of very successful species for aquaculture has been identified as one of the main activities related to the alarming decline of fish biodiversity worldwide. This issue has raised awareness amongst the scientific community, governmental authorities and the general public towards freshwater fish biodiversity. This new awareness has promoted the development of “green” markets and environmentally friendly strategies, aiming for a reliable production of protein sources. The development of native species aquaculture has been presented as a strong alternative for sustainable aquaculture and the protection of biodiversity. However, it seems clear that unplanned native species aquaculture developments can be as detrimental on local biodiversity as the introduction of exotic fish, if not more dangerous. Therefore, the advantages and disadvantages of native species aquaculture have to be clearly analysed before any aquaculture development. This study aimed to establish a philosophical background regarding the use of native fish species in aquaculture in contrast to the introduction of exotic species that may compete for a similar niche as food in local markets. The main ecological impacts that exotic fish species may have on natives, such as competition, predation, and hybridization were discussed. In addition, a well planned native species Aquaculture Strategy for the Protection of Biodiversity was produced, at catchment level, within a Geographic Information System (GIS). For the development of the native species aquaculture strategy in central Mexico, four species of Atherinids (Chirostoma estor, C. Jordani, C. promelas and Atherinella balsana) and two species <b>of</b> native <b>Ictalurids</b> (Ictalurus balsanus and Ictalurus dugesii) were included in this study. These six species are relatively new to aquaculture and they were selected on the basis of their importance in local fisheries and markets in their native basins of the Lerma-Santiago and Balsas rivers. Both of these basins are of great importance in central Mexico, not only because of their biodiversity but also because of their high human population densities and socio-economic status. The use of Geographic Information Systems was a fundamental factor in the development of the native species aquaculture strategy at catchment level, consisting of site suitability models (SSM) for each species in their corresponding native catchments. Overall, SSM identified 13, 916 km 2 and 11, 178 km 2 highly suitable for aquaculture of the studied Atherinids and Ictalurids respectively, based on Water, Soil and Terrain, Infrastructure and Risk sub-models. A set of predictive species distribution models (PSDM), which related ecological characteristics for each studied species with relevant environmental and topographic parameters into a GIS, were also produced. Such models were developed for the establishment of potential natural ranges of distribution for each species, as well as their potential to become exotic in new environments, as a potential for invasion model (PI). Based on a partial verification, both PSDM and PI models produced results that were satisfactorily consistent with the known distribution of each modelled species. The combination of SSM and PSDM produced an Aquaculture Strategy for the Protection of Biodiversity model (ASPB) which identified the most environmentally friendly suitable areas for aquaculture sites. In contrast, the combination of the SSM with PI models into an ASPB model identified the site suitability potential for non-native species that are genetically close to native ones, in an attempt to reduce the known impacts that exotic species have on local biodiversity. In this way the ASPB model identified 7, 651 km 2 suitable for aquaculture of I. balsanus in its native Balsas basin and 15, 633 km¬ 2 suitable for aquaculture of the non-native I. dugesii. ASPB models were produced for all the studied species. The final results were used to produce a set of guidelines for the development of sustainable aquaculture of native species at catchment level that cover genetic and ecological implications, as well as a well planned decision making tool produced in a GIS...|$|R
