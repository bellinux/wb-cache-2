40|$|This paper investigates whether {{monetary}} policy and banking supervision should be separated, or not. It starts with {{an account of}} the historical evolution of the Central Banks micro-function (banking supervision). The role of the lender of last resort and the introduction of deposit insurance is discussed. There is currently a diversity of institutional arrangements, but the differences are found to be greater in appearance than in reality. The main argument of divorcing the monetary from the regulatory authority is that the combination of functions might lead to a conflict of interest. This conflict can arise in different ways. The most important instance is that interest rates are held down because of concern with the ¶health¶ of the banking system, when purely monetary considerations suggest higher rates. It is argued that this conflict between ¶regulatory¶ and ¶monetary¶ objectives depends to some extent on the structure of the banking and financial systems (i. e. whether banks are dependent on wholesale or retail markets for short term funding). A First argument against separation {{is the role of the}} Central Bank in the payment system, in particular with respect to preventing systemic risk. The massive intra-day credit exposures in large value payment systems could give rise to settlement failure(s), which in turn could generate a systemic crisis. Settlement risk is therefore increasingly an area of supervisory concern for Central Banks. In so far as the Central Bank as lender of last resort is likely to support a <b>failing</b> <b>participant,</b> it is assuming the risks and effectively becoming the implicit guarantor of the system. Although Central Banks implement risk reduction policies, some risks originate beyond the settlement system, e. g. in foreign exchange trading, securities transactions and interbank transactions. It is argued that Central Banks should have a regulatory and oversight role in the payment system, although it does not follow that they should also operate them. Turning to the broader concern of the Central Bank of systemic stability, it is claimed that the Central Bank usually has to use its lender of last resort function not only in cases of liquidity difficulties, but also where the solvency of banks is uncertain. A cross-country survey of 104 bank failures is assembled in an appendix. We focus on the provision of funding for rescues: central bank, deposit insurance, government or other banking system should lie with the agency which pays if, and when, banks are to be rescued. So long as rescue and insurance is undertaken on an implicit Central Bank basis, then the Central Bank would naturally want to undertake regulation and supervision. However, there is a trend towards using tax-payer money for bank rescues which strengthens the case for separation of the monetary and supervisory functions and establishment of a government agency for the latter. It would, however, be difficult to have a complete division, since the Central Bank would generally remain the only source of immediate funding. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to examine a unique attempt at community education where a grassroots community based organization collaborated with a local public school system {{in order to help}} low-income families leave poverty. It explores the relationship between a private organization dedicated to eliminating the structural barriers low-income families face, called Circles of Support and a public school system dedicated to helping low-income students meet the proficiency mandates of No Child Left Behind.;Using interview and observational data, this critical institutional ethnography describes the 4 -year collaboration between Circles of Support and a public school system, which ultimately ended in the public school assuming fiscal and operational management of the partnership. The foundation of the collaboration rested on pairing middle and upper-class volunteers, or allies, with low-income families in order to foster the creation of authentic cross-class relationships.;During weekly meetings, low-income families, volunteers, community organizers, and school representatives came together to build community and advocate for social change. Interactions between low-income participant families and their allies, both during and outside of these meetings, served the educational purpose of helping the families acquire dominant cultural and social capital. Simultaneously, the participant families 2 ̆ 7 allies learned about the structural barriers the families faced in their struggle to leave poverty in addition to the non-dominant forms of cultural capital they possessed. I contend that within this negotiation, between acquiring dominant social and cultural capital and simultaneously recognizing structural barriers and validating non-dominant cultural capital, a Third Space exists where new forms of capital were created, what I refer to as liberatory capital. By teaching low-income families how to navigate middle-class society, allies and community organizers sought to liberate participants from poverty. Teaching allies to validate their non-dominant cultural capital and recognize institutional <b>failings,</b> <b>participants</b> sought to liberate allies and community organizers from their support of the dominant poverty discourse.

40|$|Survivors {{of severe}} {{acquired}} brain injury (ABI) often have unmet communication needs requiring augmentative and alternative communication (AAC). Survivors {{may have difficulty}} with AAC systems requiring extensive new learning. Specifically, navigation challenges occur in survivors who display cognitive inflexibility and other executive function impairments because of: (a) problems interpreting different image types used to represent concepts within AAC systems, and (b) mismatches between conversations and AAC system organization. This study 2 ̆ 7 s purpose {{was to examine the}} effect of cognitive flexibility, image contextualization, and prompt type on AAC navigation accuracy and speed by ABI survivors. Subsequently, inaccurate navigation attempts by people failing a cognitive flexibility measure were examined. ^ Eighteen ABI survivors formed two participant groups: 10 survivors passing and 8 survivors failing a cognitive flexibility measure. Participants located 60 words on three, 3 -level AAC systems given either matching context or no-context prompts. Each system used a different image type to represent content: high-context, low-context, or no-context photographs. The researcher computed mixed ANOVAs, appropriate follow-up statistics, and error analyses. Results showed that <b>participants</b> <b>failing</b> the cognitive flexibility measure navigated the system less accurately than participants passing the measure; no group difference occurred regarding accurate response navigation speed. For image contextualization, a trend for greater accuracy occurred in the high-context and low-context conditions than in the no-context condition; however, speed of accurate response navigation was slower with high-context photographs than low-context and no-context photographs. Regarding prompt type, both participant groups were more accurate given matching context than no-context prompts, and navigation speed to accurate responses was faster given matching context than no-context prompts. Error analysis using responses from <b>participants</b> <b>failing</b> the cognitive flexibility measure indicated variability regarding error types. Overall, findings suggest that performance on a cognitive flexibility measure may help clinicians distinguish survivors likely and not likely to struggle with AAC navigation. Also, variability among survivors highlights the importance of performing individualized evaluations when making decisions about image contextualization within a system. ...|$|R

We tested perceived subjective equality by increasing or decreasing the force. The illusion was significantly stronger when the perturbation was applied during active movement. We conclude that the unusual context of moving against lateral spring forces results in <b>participants</b> <b>failing</b> to predict steady lateral forces {{at the end of the}}ir movement, and causes an illusion of increasing forces even after movement termination.

CKD awareness was a “yes ” answer to “Have you ever been told you have weak or <b>failing</b> kidneys?” <b>Participants</b> were grouped by distribution of the following abnormal markers of CKD: hyperkalemia, acido-sis, hyperphosphatemia, elevated blood urea nitrogen, anemia, albuminuria, and uncontrolled hypertension. Odds of CKD awareness associated with each abnormal marker and groupings of markers were estimated by multivariable logistic regression. Results Among individuals with kidney disease, only those with albuminuria had greater odds of CKD awareness (adjusted odds ratio, 4. 0, P 0. 01) than those without. Odds of CKD awareness increased with each additional manifested clinical marker of CKD (adjusted odds ratio, 1. 3, P 0. 05). Nonetheless, 90 % of individuals with two to four markers of CKD and 84 % of individuals with 5 markers of CKD were un-aware of their disease.

This phenomenological study sought to explore the experience of clinical assessment and why assessors fail to award “failing” nursing students a fail grade. Fourteen clinical nurse educators, employed within three New Zealand polytechnics were interviewed about their experiences of educating and assessing nursing students’ clinical practice. All participants used a preceptorship model of clinical teaching. The interviews were analysed for key themes using Heideggerian Interpretive Phenomenology. The study revealed tensions for participants between being-in the world-of-nursing as well as being-in the world-of-education. Less than half the participants had not failed a nursing student in clinical practice, despite having concerns about their safety to practice. Participants felt ill prepared for their role as educators and assessors. The phenomenon of care was revealed when assessing <b>failing</b> students. <b>Participants</b> acknowledged that some students are thrown into the world-of-nursing; they wanted to care for students by not failing them and questioned whether assessment should occur in the first year. As students progressed through the programme, participants used the phenomenon of care for the health consumer to make a judgement about a students’ competence. The responsibility to fail nursing students was frequently disburdened to others. The ambiguity of clinical assessment tools, especially the use of competencies, and the lack of progression created challenges for assessors. The threat of students appealing the fail grade inhibited less experienced <b>participants</b> from <b>failing</b> students. Clinical nurse educators lack adequate preparation to educate and assess nursing students. The limitations of this study are its small sample size and lack of generalisability.

An analysis of the findings revealed subjects were most often not able to vote with Helios because they did not log in after encrypting their ballot but before casting it. For both Prêt à Voter and Scantegrity II, failing to vote was most frequently attributed to not scanning the completed ballot. Across all three systems, the most common reason participants did not verify their vote was due to not casting a ballot in the first place.

40|$|PhD (Molecular Medicine and Haematology), Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the WitwatersrandBackground: The {{availability}} of highly active antiretroviral (ARV) {{treatment in the}} South African government sector has reduced the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV- 1 infection. However, ARV drug resistance and toxicity are major obstacles to achieving and maintaining virus suppression, {{but there is no}} provision for ARV drug resistance testing in the public sector. To date, most studies of ARV drug resistance in HIV- 1 reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease (PR), are based on sequence data from HIV- 1 subtype B, whereas subtype C is the predominant circulating subtype in South Africa. Moreover, host genetic polymorphisms associated with ARV drug toxicity have not been investigated in South African populations. This study evaluated viral and host genetic factors associated with ARV treatment outcome in 812 ARV drug-naive South African AIDS participants enrolled on the CIPRA-SA study from Johannesburg and Cape Town.

To further test a laboratory model of MCS based on symptom learning, we used a stronger respiratory challenge in this study than in previous studies to induce symptoms (20 % CO 2 -enriched air, unconditioned stimulus). Additionally, extinction of learned symptoms was investigated. Methods | Diluted ammonia (AM) and butyric acid (BA) served as conditioned (odor) stimuli (CSs). In a learning phase, healthy participants received three breathing trials of BA mixed with CO 2 and three trials of AM mixed with regular air, or the reversed combination. In a test phase, the same trials were administered without CO 2. Immediately after odor onset, participants rated their anxiety and expectancy to experience symptoms during that trial. Self-reported symptoms were assessed after each trial; respiratory behavior was measured throughout the experiment. Results | Only participants who learned to correctly anticipate symptoms (learning phase) reported elevated symptoms in response to the CS+ odor (test phase). Anticipation was more likely correct and learned symptoms were more elevated when BA had been previously associated with CO 2. Across test trials, anticipatory anxiety diminished, but learned symptoms did not. <b>Participants</b> <b>failing</b> to learn the prearranged contingencies reported overall more symptoms and anxiety. Conclusions | Strong respiratory challenges impede extinction of learned symptoms. Conscious expectancy, which may be modulated by odor quality, determines whether learned symptoms develop in response to a specific odor or to the general context.

40|$|This study {{assessed}} whether {{young adults}} demonstrate the phonetic context effect {{under conditions of}} normal hearing, and simulated low-frequency and high-frequency hearing loss. Twenty normal hearing participants, aged 18 to 25, listened to 600 disyllables that included a natural /ar/ or /al/ followed by a synthesized consonant-vowel (CV) syllable from the /ga/-/da/ acoustic continuum. Ten different CV syllables were constructed so that {{the onset of the}} third formant (F 3) ranged from 1800 to 2700 Hz in 100 Hz steps. Each disyllable was processed to reflect normal hearing, a low-frequency hearing loss and a high-frequency hearing loss. The disyllables were presented in random order, and after each presentation, participants were asked to indicate if the last syllable was a ga or a da. Using Probit regression and Poisson analyses, the results showed that in the normal hearing condition the participants demonstrated the context effect as reflected by hearing more ga syllables in the context of /al/ than /ar/. In the low-frequency condition the average identification function was shallow with half of the <b>participants</b> <b>failing</b> to show clear categorical boundaries, but of those that did, 9 of 10 demonstrated a context effect. In the high-frequency hearing loss condition the participants failed to show any distinct categories or clear sensitivities to the /ar/ and /al/ contexts. These results have implications for people with hearing loss and how their hearing losses are treated. The results suggested that even a moderate high-frequency loss can interfere with categorical perception and use of contextual cues. Moreover, a moderate low-frequency hearing loss, which often is overlooked for treatment, may interfere with speech processing in some people...|$|R
40|$|Background: Didactic lectures are {{frequently}} {{used to improve}} compliance with practice guidelines. This study assessed the knowledge of health-care providers (HCPs) at a tertiary-care hospital of its evidence-based thromboprophylaxis guidelines {{and the impact of}} didactic lectures on their knowledge. Methods: The hospital launched a multifaceted approach to improve thromboprophylaxis practices, which included posters, a pocket-size guidelines summary and didactic lectures during the annual thromboprophylaxis awareness days. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to HCPs before and after lectures on thromboprophylaxis guidelines (June 2010). The questionnaire, formulated and validated by two physicians, two nurses and a clinical pharmacist, covered various subjects such as risk stratification, anticoagulant dosing and the choice of anticoagulants in specific clinical situations. Results: Seventy-two and 63 HCPs submitted the pre- and post-test, respectively (62 % physicians, 28 % nurses, from different clinical disciplines). The mean scores were 7. 8 ± 2. 1 (median = 8. 0, range = 2 - 12, maximum possible score = 15) for the pre-test and 8. 4 ± 1. 8 for the post-test, P = 0. 053. There {{was no significant difference in}} the pre-test scores of nurses and physicians (7. 9 ± 1. 7 and 8. 2 ± 2. 4, respectively, P = 0. 67). For the 35 HCPs who completed the pre- and post-tests, their scores were 7. 7 ± 1. 7 and 8. 8 ± 1. 6, respectively, P = 0. 003. Knowledge of appropriate anticoagulant administration in specific clinical situations was frequently inadequate, with approximately two-thirds of <b>participants</b> <b>failing</b> to adjust low-molecular-weight heparin doses in patients with renal failure. Conclusions: Education via didactic lectures resulted in a modest improvement of HCPs′ knowledge of thromboprophylaxis guidelines. This supports the need for a multifaceted approach to improve the awareness and implementation of thromboprophylaxis guidelines...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: We {{aimed to}} test, at pilot level, a {{structured}} group educational intervention to improve self-management of {{blood pressure in}} people with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The current paper explores patient acceptability of the intervention. Design: This was an open randomised pilot trial. Participants {{were randomly assigned to}} either: ● A control group (n= 41) receiving standard clinical management of hypertension. ● An intervention group (n= 40) receiving standard clinical care plus the educational intervention. Setting: Renal outpatient clinics at a single study centre. Participants: Patients with early CKD and hypertension were identified and approached for recruitment. Intervention: An evidence-based structured group educational intervention (CHEERS) using the principles of social cognitive theory to improve knowledge and self-management skills. Outcomes: Recruitment, uptake of the intervention and patient satisfaction were evaluated to explore patient acceptability of the intervention and to determine any differences between patients regarding recruitment and retention. Measures: Data on age, sex and ethnicity were collected for all patients approached to take part. For recruited patients, data were also collected on self-efficacy (ability to self-manage). Reasons given by patients declining to take part were recorded. Patients attending the educational session also completed an evaluation form to assess satisfaction. Results: A total of 267 patients were approached, and 30 % were randomly assigned. Lack of time (48 %) and lack of interest (44 %) were the main reasons cited for non-participation in the study. Men {{were significantly more likely to}} be recruited (p= 0. 048). The intervention was rated enjoyable and useful by 100 % of participants. However, 37. 5 % of the intervention group failed to attend the educational session after recruitment. <b>Participants</b> <b>failing</b> to attend were significantly more likely to be older (p= 0. 039) and have lower self-efficacy (p= 0. 034). Conclusion: The findings suggest that delivering and evaluating an effective structured group educational intervention to promote better blood pressure control in patients with CKD would be challenging in the current context of kidney care.

40|$|Background Bone demineralization, {{which leads}} to {{osteoporosis}} and increased fracture risk, is a common metabolic disorder in HIV-infected individuals. In this study, we aimed to assess the change in bone quality using quantitative ultrasound (QUS) over 96 weeks of follow-up after initiation of second-line treatment, and to identify factors associated with change in bone quality. Methods and findings In a randomized trial (ANRS 12169), TDF and PI-na ve <b>participants</b> <b>failing</b> standard first-line treatment, from Burkina Faso, Cameroon, and Senegal were randomized to receive either TDF/FTC/LPVr, ABC/ddl/LPVr or TDF/FTC/DRVr. Their bone quality was assessed using calcaneal QUS at baseline and every 24 weeks until week 96. Stiffness index (SI) {{was used to measure}} bone quality. Out of 228 participants, 168 (74 %) were women. At baseline, median age was 37 years (IQR: 33 - 46 years) and median T-CD 4 count was 199 cells/mu l (IQR: 113 - 319 cells/mu l). The median duration of first-line antiretroviral treatment (ART) was 52 months (IQR: 36 - 72 months) and the median baseline SI was 101 (IQR: 87 - 116). In multivariable analysis, factors associated with baseline SI were sex ([beta = - 10. 8 [- 18. 1,- 3. 5] for women), age ([beta = - 8. 7 [- 12. 4,- 5. 1] per 10 years), body mass index (BMI) ((beta = + 0. 8 [0. 1, 1. 5] per unit of BMI), and study site ((beta = + 12. 8 [6. 5, 19. 1] for Cameroon). After 96 weeks of second-line therapy, a reduction of 7. 1 % in mean SI was observed, as compared with baseline. Factors associated with SI during the follow-up were similar to those found at baseline. Exposure to TDF was not associated with a greater loss of bone quality over time. Conclusion Bone quality decreased after second-line ART initiation in African patients independently of TDF exposure. Factors associated with bone quality include age, sex, baseline BMI, study site, and duration of follow-up...|$|R

40|$|The debate {{concerning}} {{the legitimacy of}} artistic research {{that has taken place}} {{over the last two decades}} is notable for the way in which it has drawn attention to rival 'representational' and 'performative' images of thought. Early critics of practice-led research such as Durling, Friedman, Elkins and Biggs employed broadly representational arguments in a quasi-legal context of judgment to suggest that processes of artistic research were in some sense unrecognisable when an attempt was made to see them through the conceptual lens of 'research'. In contrast to this, advocates of artistic research, such as Haseman, Bolt, Sullivan, Borgdorff and Slager have proposed that research arising out of artistic practice possesses distinctive qualities - conjoining interests in the experimental, the experiential, and the non-representational, with a set of predominantly transformative aims. For Deleuze (2001), any act of thinking is guided by a pre-conceptual, aesthetic/stylistic ‘image’ that in some sense precedes it. Deleuze suggests that a particularly ‘dogmatic’ image of thought pervasively permeates the history of philosophy, and likewise serves to structure received notions of ‘common’ and ‘good’ sense. As such, it conditions the conceptual distribution into which things may fall, as well as the processes of practical reasoning which are typically employed in the judgment or disciplining of phenomena (resemblance, opposition, analogy and identity). Significantly, Deleuze positions taxomomic construction, scientific method, and legal adjudicative procedures as products of this image (Lefebvre, 2008) - all of which have figured prominently in the broadly positivistic criticism/contestation of artistic research. Perhaps because of the refractive, asymmetrical relationship between representational and performative images of thought, an interesting, and long running feature of the legitimacy debate has been the <b>failing</b> of <b>participants</b> on both sides of the discussion to critically engage with their opposition. In an attempt to address the lack of sustained critical confrontation between oppositional voices, this paper seeks to engage closely with a prominent sceptical position. To this end, the work of Michael Biggs and Daniela Büchler is interrogated from a conceptual, aesthetic and relational perspective, revealing its Wittgensteinian and Kantian roots, and subjecting them to critical scrutiny from the perspective of Deleuzian thought. The critique of Biggs and Büchler’s project is presented here in the spirit of Masummi’s (2002) conception of the example as an ‘odd beast’ – as that which enables an incisive and direct confrontation with a singular position, whilst functioning emblematically to address a much wider terrain. Thus Biggs and Büchler are positioned as avatars of a more generalised sceptical position, and their project as a prominent expression of the dogmatic image of thought. It is argued here that Biggs and Büchler’s resistance to the affective and the performative is pervasive, colouring their approach to philosophy, art and aesthetics and placing them at odds with the largely material-experiential, and transdisciplinary interests of many artistic researchers. With Deleuze’s (1995) stylistic and operatic conception of philosophy in mind a series of performative, aesthetico-conceptual strategies are developed in order to problematise Biggs and Büchler’s project - confronting a linguistic-pragmatism of the right with a Deleuzian process-pragmatism of the left.

40|$|A common {{assumption}} in {{the study}} of conversation is that participants fully cooperate in order to maximise the effectiveness of the exchange and ensure communication flow. This assumption persists even in situations in which the private goals of the participants are at odds: they may act strategically pursuing their agendas, but will still adhere to a number of linguistic norms or conventions which are implicitly accepted by a community of language users. However, in naturally occurring dialogue participants often depart from such norms, for instance, by asking inappropriate questions, by avoiding to provide adequate answers or by volunteering information that is not relevant to the conversation. These are examples of what we call linguistic non-cooperation. This thesis presents a systematic investigation of linguistic non-cooperation in dialogue. Given a specific activity, in a specific cultural context and time, the method proceeds by making explicit which linguistic behaviours are appropriate. This results in a set of rules: the global dialogue game. Non-cooperation is then measured as instances in which the actions of the participants are not in accordance with these rules. The dialogue game is formally defined in terms of discourse obligations. These are actions that participants are expected to perform at a given point in the dialogue based on the dialogue history. In this context, non-cooperation amounts to <b>participants</b> <b>failing</b> to act according to their obligations. We propose a general definition of linguistic non-cooperation and give a specific instance for political interview dialogues. Based on the latter, we present an empirical method which involves a coding scheme for the manual annotation of interview transcripts. The degree to which each participant cooperates is automatically determined by contrasting the annotated transcripts with the rules in the dialogue game for political interviews. The approach is evaluated on a corpus of broadcast political interviews and tested for correlation with human judgement on the same corpus. Further, we describe a model of conversational agents that incorporates the concepts and mechanisms above as part of their dialogue manager. This allows for the generation of conversations in which the agents exhibit varying degrees of cooperation by controlling how often they favour their private goals instead of discharging their discourse obligations...|$|R
40|$|Background: Despite {{the success}} of {{antiretroviral}} treatment (ART) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the associated toxicities are complex to manage and compromise treatment benefits. Prevention and treatment of chronic toxicities such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), metabolic disorders, lipodystrophy, and osteoporosis are essential to ensure patient well being. This thesis aimed to provide more information on these toxicities in two clinical trial settings. Methods: Three sub-studies of the STEAL clinical trial examined the toxicities associated with ABC/ 3 TC and TDF/FTC. The first study compared cardiovascular safety profiles of the two ART by examining CVD biomarkers. The second identified baseline predictors of limb fat recovery. A final study identified specific HLA genotypes associated with body composition changes. The final chapters of the thesis examined ART toxicities in HIV <b>participants</b> <b>failing</b> their first-line therapy in the SECONDLINE study. Lipodystrophy, metabolic disturbances, cardiovascular risk and bone mineral density were examined in participants randomised to either 2 - 3 nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (N(t) RTIs) plus lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) or to raltegravir plus LPV/r. Results: The primary STEAL study was the first randomised controlled trial to support the finding that ABC was associated with adverse cardiovascular affects. We found there were no consistent differences in biomarker levels of immune activation, coagulopathic disorders or endothelial dysfunction as a biological explanation for this adverse effect. Limb fat gain was similar with both ABC/ 3 TC and TDF/FTC treatment and the baseline predictors of greater limb fat gain were thymidine N(t) RTI use, high glucose, high interleukin 6 and low limb fat. The HLA analysis demonstrated that participants carrying {{one or more of}} the HLA supertypes A 01, B 08 and DQ 2 may be resistant to thymidine analogue-induced lipoatrophy. SECONDLINE study participants switching to LPV/r plus raltegravir improved limb fat similar to the N(t) RTI plus LPV/r regimen, but worsened total:HDL cholesterol ratio over 48 weeks. In addition, LPV/r plus raltegravir was associated with less bone loss that the LPV/r plus 2 - 3 N(t) RTI. Thereby demonstrating that raltegravir may be a safe alternative to standard second-line therapy. Conclusion: Endeavours to understand treatment-related toxicities are important initiatives to assist with long-term, effective use of ART in HIV infected individuals...|$|R
