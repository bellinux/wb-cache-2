5000|$|The Tanum Tunnel is 3590 m {{long and}} has a cross section varying between 105 and 115 m2. The tunnel {{consists}} of a 2718 m blasted section and a 800 m, cut-and-cover section—the latter the easternmost part of the tunnel. It carries the double-tracked Asker Line between Jong and Åstad. The tunnel runs mostly through Cambrian-Silurian sedimentary slate, nodular limestone and shale, with local occurrences of Permian igneous rock. There is also a 400 m section of less stable sedimentary rock in the Asker Group. The tunnel had a cover {{most of the way}} of between 50 and 100 m; however at Billingstad there was a much lower margin, laying for the most at 10 to 15 m and at the least at 1.5 m. At Åstad, the line runs 600 m in the open before entering the Skaugum Tunnel. The line is electrified at [...] and allows a maximum speed of 160 km/h.

40|$|Abstract. The {{rational}} database {{including the}} distribution, changes and testing facilities status of temperature & humidity in tea garden is created using the MapInfo 9. 5. A {{set of the}} tea garden wireless utilities is established using the ZigBee module. The temperature & humidity real-time monitoring system and early warning system for Frost Prevention is established using Mapbasic. This system can get real-time information of temperature & humidity of nodes in different locations and give frost warning early. The <b>frost</b> prevention <b>fans</b> can be timely started, once temperature inversion happens. At the same time, the manager of tea garden can realize real-time monitor of the work status and quick location of facilities {{with the help of}} GPS...|$|R
