[...] "There are many who wish to advance themselves, and who bide their turn, for I refuse no man who comes on such an errand. At present it may not be, for mine arm is stiff from this small touch, and I would fain do you full honor when we cross swords again.

What I wish to do in your case is what I have done in others, and some memorable ones. Dress {{does not make a}} man, but it often makes a successful one. The most precious stone, you know, must be cut and polished. I shall <b>enter</b> <b>your</b> <b>name</b> in my books for an unlimited credit, and no account to be settled till you are a privy councillor. I do not limit the credit, because you are a man of sense and a gentleman, and will not abuse it. But be quite as careful not to stint yourself as not to be needlessly extravagant. In the first instance, you would be interfering with my experiment, and that would not be fair." ...|$|E
60|$|There {{are four}} {{specialties}} attainable {{in the way}} of social pleasure. If you <b>enter</b> <b>your</b> <b>name</b> on the Visitor's Book at Government House you will receive an invitation to the next ball that takes place there, if nothing can be proven against you. And it will be very pleasant; for you will see everybody except the Governor, and add a number of acquaintances and several friends to your list. The Governor will be in England. He always is. The continent has four or five governors, and I do not know how many it takes to govern the outlying archipelago; but anyway you will not see them. When they are appointed they come out from England and get inaugurated, and give a ball, and help pray for rain, and get aboard ship and go back home. And so the Lieutenant-Governor has to do all the work. I was in Australasia three months and a half, and saw only one Governor. The others were at home.|$|E
60|$|Why {{should not}} you {{yourself}} {{be one of}} those to <b>enter</b> <b>your</b> <b>name</b> in such a list as I speak of? You are young; you have great talents; you have a clear head; you have a natural, fluent, and unforced elocution; your ideas are just, your sentiments benevolent, open, and enlarged;--but this is too big for your modesty. Oh! this modesty, in time and place, is a charming virtue, and the grace of all other virtues. But it is sometimes the worst enemy they have. Let him whose print I gave you the other day be engraved in your memory! Had it pleased Providence to have spared him for the trying situations that seem to be coming on, notwithstanding that he was sometimes a little dispirited by the disposition which we thought shown to depress him and set him aside, yet he was always buoyed up again; and on one or two occasions he discovered what might be expected from the vigor and elevation of his mind, from his unconquerable fortitude, and from the extent of his resources for every purpose of speculation and of action. Remember him, my friend, who in the highest degree honored and respected you; and remember that great parts are a great trust. Remember, too, that mistaken or misapplied virtues, if they are not as pernicious as vice, frustrate at least their own natural tendencies, and disappoint the purposes of the Great Giver.|$|E

During the execution, she was offered $50,000 ($49,992 in a suitcase, and the eight one dollar bills with the rankings) to leave the game immediately. After consideration, she accepted the bribe, and withdrew, thus eliminating the need for an execution.

If so, {{the most important thing you}} should do *NOW * is start maintaining an “AboutMe” document that is nothing but a giant list of your qualifications (or a reminder of the gaps in your qualifications that need attention). This is not a resume. An “AboutMe” document is for your own record keeping, so don’t worry about fancy formatting. Simply enter information (with dates) as you proceed through your education and career. When you need to write a resume, you can refer to your “AboutMe ” document to make sure that you don’t forget anything that is important to your prospective employer. If you start collecting this information only a month or two before you need a job, it will be too late. Frequently update your “AboutMe ” document, and take corrective action if you’re weak in any category. Your “AboutMe ” document should cover the areas listed below (adapted from the 2009 National Defense Fellowship Application as well as numerous employment application forms). When you add items in each section, you should list them in reverse chronological order (i. e., most recent first) since that’s the way that they should be listed in a résumé.
