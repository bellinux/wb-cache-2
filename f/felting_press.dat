50|$|Presses can be {{single or}} double felted. A single <b>felted</b> <b>press</b> has a <b>felt</b> {{on one side}} and a smooth roll on the other. A double <b>felted</b> <b>press</b> has both sides of the sheet in contact with a <b>press</b> <b>felt.</b> Single felted nips are useful when mated against a smooth roll (usually in the top position), which adds a two-sidedness—making the top side appear {{smoother}} than the bottom. Double felted nips impart roughness on both sides of the sheet. Double <b>felted</b> <b>presses</b> are desirable for the first press section of heavy paperboard.|$|R

50|$|A felt-covered board {{can be used}} in {{storytelling}} {{to small}} children. Small felt cutouts or figures of animals, people, or other objects will adhere to a felt board, and in the process of telling the story, the storyteller also acts it out on the board with the animals or people. Puppets can also be made with <b>felt.</b> <b>Felt</b> <b>pressed</b> dolls, such as Lenci dolls, were very popular in the nineteenth century and just after the first world war.|$|R

The felts run through the nips of the press rolls and continues around a felt run, normally consisting of several felt rolls. During the dwell time in the nip, the moisture from the sheet is transferred to the <b>press</b> <b>felt.</b> When the <b>press</b> <b>felt</b> exits the nip and continues around, a vacuum box known as an Uhle Box applies vacuum (normally -60 kPa) to the <b>press</b> <b>felt</b> to remove the moisture so that when the felt returns to the nip on the next cycle, it does not add moisture to the sheet.|$|R

Meanwhile, General Harney returned to St. Louis after having been captured by rebel forces in Virginia; he was released after refusing to align with them, then persuaded the War Department that he would hold Missouri in the Union. Upon his return to Missouri he retroactively approved Lyon's capture of Camp Jackson, then secured warrants to search and seize illegal weapons in the area. He also sent forces to nearby Potosi to secure its supply of lead and the railroad line connecting it to St. Louis.|$|R

25|$|The Socialist Party of America was in {{the throes}} of a {{membership}} decline throughout the decade of the 1920s, the communist left wing of the organization having been suspended, expelled, or split from the organization beginning with the seminal 1919 Emergency National Convention of the party. Dues-paying membership fell during this period from more than 100,000 to less than 10,000. The party's finances were similarly deeply affected and the organization <b>felt</b> <b>pressed</b> to explore new means of reaching an increasingly apathetic public. At its December 1926 quarterly meeting the governing National Executive Committee of the Socialist Party decided to erect a radio broadcasting station as a memorial to its recently deceased co-founder, Eugene V. Debs, who had died in October of the previous year.|$|R

50|$|After Geoffroy's initial {{inflammatory}} report, {{some other}} {{scientists in the}} Academy <b>felt</b> <b>pressed</b> to choose a side. In an effort to protect his reputation, the co-author on the report, Latrielle, wrote to Cuvier to deny his participation in the report presented to the Academy, {{as well as to}} disassociate himself from Geoffroy's unity of composition theory. This was likely a strategical move as Cuvier had just the year before helped Latrielle, a rather old man of sixty-seven, replace Lamarck as a professor in the Museum. Both authors of the original cephalopod paper wrote to Cuvier as well to apologize for the trouble their paper had caused. However, the damage on Meyranx and Laurencet's careers may already have been done, as no future works by the authors have been recorded, nor is their cephalopod paper to be found.|$|R

30|$|Overall, {{students}} seem to {{have enjoyed}} the gamified learning experience, with all student types reporting higher levels of interest and motivation with our course, as compared to other regular courses. There were a few changes in the second year, where we added five new achievements, with moderate success. While the Talkative badge encouraged students to participate, adding value to the learning experience, some students <b>felt</b> <b>pressed</b> to talk in class against their will, which made them feel penalized. We believe that providing alternative achievements to this one would mitigate its harmful effect. We already had a few achievements that provided bonus XP, which could be completed in alternative to mandatory achievements. The notion that students do have alternatives should be further emphasized throughout the term. On the other hand, the cooperative achievements proved a mild success. We believe that a new achievement requiring students to collaborate towards a common goal should be added {{instead of trying to}} get them to help each other completing lab work, as this turned out to be an unappealing task.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} {{challenges}} of introducing learning goals in Participatory Design (PD) activities in a school context. In order to increase the transparency of mutual learning in accordance with traditional PD values, we argue that learning through design approaches can inspire us to actively formulate learning goals, stage activities and include reflection {{as an integral part}} in the PD activity in order to meet those learning goals. We tested this approach in several master student projects, where the students were required to involve children in schools in the design of a technology. Our data analysis is based on their written reports as well as a specific exam question. We found that defining good learning goals was hard, but useful, especially when designing and discussing informed consent forms with teachers. Staging activities {{in order to meet the}} learning goals was possible, although learning goals were sometimes derived from the activities. Finally, incorporating moments of reflection for children was still difficult for our students because they <b>felt</b> <b>pressed</b> for time. We present some of the advantages and problems so that practitioners can consider the added value of this approach...|$|R
50|$|The first European {{base was}} {{established}} in 1680 in El Paso, Texas with the exiled Spaniards and Native Americans from the Isleta Pueblo during the Pueblo Revolt, also known as Popé's Rebellion, from northern New Mexico. In 1682, René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle established a French colony, Fort Saint Louis, near Matagorda Bay. The colony was killed off by Native Americans after three years, but Spanish authorities <b>felt</b> <b>pressed</b> to establish settlements to keep their claim to the land. Several missions were established in East Texas; they were abandoned in 1691. Twenty years later, concerned with the French presence in neighboring Louisiana, Spanish authorities again tried to colonize Texas. Over the next 110 years, Spain established numerous villages, presidios, and missions in the province. A small number of Spanish settlers arrived, in addition to missionaries and soldiers. Spain signed agreements with colonizers from the United States. When Mexico won its independence from Spain in 1821, Mexican Texas {{was part of the}} new nation. To encourage settlement, Mexican authorities allowed organized immigration from the United States, and by 1834, over 30,000 Anglos lived in Texas, compared to 7,800 Mexicans.|$|R
5000|$|The {{bodies and}} the {{clothing}} of Lenci {{boy and girl}} dolls are made of <b>pressed</b> woolen <b>felt.</b> The bodies were machine stitched up the back and across the shoulders then hand stitched between the legs.

40|$|When {{the paper}} web and <b>press</b> <b>felt</b> enter a nip {{in the press}} section of a paper machine, both the paper web and felt are compressed. Water is forced from the paper sheet into the <b>press</b> <b>felt</b> due to a {{hydrodynamic}} pressure gradient between the sheet and felt. Water not only flows through the felt in the transversal z-direction, but also flows through the felt in the machine and cross-machine directions. On the exit side of the nip, the pressure imposed on the sheet-felt system by the rolls begins to decrease. Both the paper web and <b>press</b> <b>felt</b> begin to expand, and a vacuum is created in the web and felt. The vacuum in the web is stronger than that in the felt, and thus water and air tend to flow from the felt back into the sheet, causing rewet. Three mechanisms that contribute to rewet have been proposed: 1) film splitting between the paper web and <b>press</b> <b>felt,</b> 2) capillary forces in the web drawing water from the felt into the web, and 3) the pressure differential between the web and felt during expansion. The objective of this project was to design and test under flow conditions {{similar to those in}} a press nip a smart water receiver {{to be used in the}} press section of a paper machine. In this manner, the feasibility of such a water receiver was to be determined. The purpose of this water receiver is to accept water that is pressed from the paper web in a nip and prevent the return of this water to the paper web upon exit from the nip. Thus, the smart water receiver allows flow through the felt in the positive z-direction of the felt (away from the paper web) and not in the negative z-direction (towards the paper web). The smart water receiver concept utilizes a layer of micro-check valves incorporated into the <b>press</b> <b>felt</b> to perform in the desired manner. A mathematical model and lab-scale prototype were created in order to predict the behavior of such a design in the press nip. M. S.

40|$|Dewatering of pulp in a {{paper machine}} is a well {{established}} process. Nevertheless, {{it is far from}} being fully understood. One of the major steps in this process is the mechanical dewatering within the press section. It is achieved by applying large mechanical loads on the wet paper web {{while at the same time}} providing an escape route for the excess water. The quality of this process is influenced by many parameters. Besides the press nip parameters like pressure, roll diameters and press type (roll or shoe press), also other factors contribute to the mechanical dewatering performance. Among these factors the <b>press</b> <b>felts,</b> that transport the paper web through the press nip, are a major influence. Besides dewatering pulp, <b>press</b> <b>felts</b> govern also the papers smoothness and printability...|$|R
