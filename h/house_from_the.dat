5|$|According to {{the mission}} plan, the first {{helicopter}} would hover over the compound's yard while its full team of SEALs fast-roped to the ground. At the same time, the second helicopter would fly to {{the northeast corner of}} the compound and deploy the interpreter, the dog and handler, and four SEALs to secure the perimeter. The team in the courtyard was to enter the <b>house</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ground floor.|$|E
5|$|Dominating the {{appearance}} of the <b>house</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> street is a large verandah-style porch, supported by large stone columns, on the southern-facing front of the house; an enclosed porch, smaller but two stories high and supported by wooden pillars, is located on the rear portion of the house's east side. Projecting {{from the front of the}} house, above the porch, is a small wing with a gable, semicircular window, and elaborate cornice. The house is built in a combination of styles; it includes many Italianate details, but its design appears to have been influenced by the architecture of the Sears Modern Homes.|$|E

5|$|Imported Dutch brick {{was often}} used in {{buildings}} in England in the 17th and 18th centuries. In Dartmouth, a house built in 1664 for mariner Robert Plumleigh had traditional timber-framed architecture but included elaborate star-shaped chimney stacks made from imported Dutch brick. Houses in Topsham, Devon, also used Dutch brick for chimneys, window heads and dressing. One <b>house</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> late 17th century in Dutch Court in Topsham is built entirely of Dutch brick. The ports of Exeter and Topsham both shipped wool to the Netherlands, and the returning ships brought bricks as ballast from Amsterdam or Rotterdam.|$|E
5|$|In April 1885, the Cosmos Club {{considered}} {{purchasing the}} <b>house</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Tayloe family. The influential club already owned {{most of the}} block north of the Tayloe House, and was expanding rapidly. It valued the home at $60,000 and the furnishings at an additional $5,000. The Cosmos Club declined to buy the home after an investigation found {{that the cost of}} upgrading the Tayloe property for its use would be too costly.|$|E

5|$|Media {{accounts}} {{had reported}} that the plan had been to fast rope to the inner courtyard and to clear the main <b>house</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ground floor up. The helicopter crashed in the outer courtyard with the SEAL team still on board. The SEAL team exited and needed to breach two walls {{and then into the}} house. As a result, Osama bin Laden was killed several minutes into the operation. Pfarrer's account differs in that he wrote that a SEAL team was inserted onto the roof of the main house, that Osama bin Laden was killed seconds into the operation, and that the main house was cleared from the top down.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{visitors}} typically {{enter the}} <b>house</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> High Street to the south, {{passing through the}} gatehouse, across the lower courtyard into the hall of the main building. Plas Mawr's gatehouse was only the third such entrance building {{to be built in}} North Wales, despite gatehouses being an important part of English Elizabethan architecture, designed to show off the house and provide a suitably dignified entry for visitors. Few houses in towns had the physical space for a gatehouse like Plas Mawr's. Originally, the gatehouse would have contained a suite of rooms for the steward of the house, Richard Wynn.|$|E
5|$|On 17 July 1917, George appeased British {{nationalist}} feelings {{by issuing}} a royal proclamation {{that changed the}} name of the British royal <b>house</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> German-sounding House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to the House of Windsor. He and all his British relatives relinquished their German titles and styles, and adopted British-sounding surnames. George compensated his male relatives by creating them British peers. His cousin, Prince Louis of Battenberg, who earlier in the war had been forced to resign as First Sea Lord through anti-German feeling, became Louis Mountbatten, 1st Marquess of Milford Haven, while Queen Mary's brothers became Adolphus Cambridge, 1st Marquess of Cambridge, and Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone.|$|E

His widow subsequently sold Highgrove at auction.|$|E

5|$|The {{prosecution}} {{case was}} that Bamber, motivated by hatred and greed, had left White House Farm around 10pm on 6 August 1985, after dining with his family, {{to drive to}} his home in Head Street, Goldhanger. Later, perhaps {{in the early hours of}} the morning of 7 August, he had returned to the farm on his mother's bicycle—which he had borrowed a few days earlier—cycling along a route that avoided the main roads and approaching the <b>house</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> back. He had entered the house through a downstairs bathroom window, taken the rifle with the silencer attached, and gone upstairs.|$|E

The adjacent American Gothic House Center, completed in 2007, contains exhibits about the painting, artist Grant Wood, and the community around the house.

5|$|Most of what {{is known}} about John Endecott's origins is the result of {{research}} conducted since the 1990s. Biographers of the 19th century believed he was from the Dorset town of Dorchester because of his significant later association with people from that place. In the early 20th century, historian Roper Lethbridge proposed that Endecott was born circa 1588 in or near Chagford in Devon. Interestingly, in the 16th century the prominent Endecott family, together with the Whiddons, Knapmans and Lethbridges, owned most of the mines around the stannary town of Chagford, which might—if he is indeed from this family—explain the Governor's interest in developing copper mining. (Based on this evidence, Chagford now has a <b>house</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> period named in Endecott's honour.) However, more recent research by the New England Historic Genealogical Society has identified problems with Lethbridge's claims, which they dispute. Endecott has more recently been definitively determined to have been born in 1588 in Chagford, to Thomas Endecott and an unnamed mother, who died shortly after his birth.|$|E
5|$|Paoli kept busy {{performing}} in Italy, South America and the United States. He returned to Puerto Rico in 1923. At the time, Amalia Paoli was residing in San Juan (in the ward of Santurce) {{where she was}} running a singing school (Academia Paoli). Antonio conducted a few performances around the island and then departed to sing at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the Manhattan Opera House and the Metropolitan Opera House in Philadelphia. He had wanted to sing in the Metropolitan Opera House in New York, but apparently his competitor Enrico Caruso opposed this. Some attribute this {{to the fact that}} Caruso was a shareholder of the renowned opera <b>house.</b> <b>From</b> <b>the</b> U.S., the tenor would visit Curaçao, Cuba, Colombia, Haiti and Ecuador.|$|E

5|$|Production on The Orphanage {{began on}} May 15, 2006 in Llanes, Asturias. This {{location}} was chosen {{due to the}} area's diverse natural settings that include beaches, caves, cliffs, forests, a small village, and the Partarríu Manor where the orphanage scenes take place. The orphanage was an old colonial <b>house</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{end of the nineteenth}} century. Bayona wanted to use certain cinematographic techniques that were impossible to achieve in the house, so several parts of the house were reconstructed in sound stages. After four weeks in Llanes, the team moved to Barcelona to finish up the last ten weeks of filming in sound stages, making over 80% of the film there. Bayona showed the films La residencia and The Innocents to his director of photography on the film, to make special notice of the Scope lensing used in both films.|$|E
5|$|Remembered {{above all}} for his fairy tales, Hans Christian Andersen {{was born in}} Odense in 1805. It is thought his birthplace is the small yellow house {{on the corner of}} Hans Jensens Stræde and Bangs Boder in the old town. In 1908 the house was opened as the Hans Christian Andersen Museum. It {{documents}} his life from his childhood years as the son of a struggling shoemaker, to his schooling, career as an author, and later life, with artefacts providing an insight into his acquaintances and adventures. Andersen's childhood home is on Munkemøllestræde not far from the cathedral. He lived in the little half-timbered <b>house</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> age of two until he was 14. Opened as a museum in 1930, the house contains an exhibition of the cobbling tools used by his father and other items based on Andersen's own descriptions.|$|E
5|$|The Dream Lord keeps Amy {{awake in}} the TARDIS reality while the Doctor and Rory fall asleep {{and return to the}} Leadworth reality. The Dream Lord {{questions}} Amy as to whom she would choose between Rory and the Doctor. He states that she must choose between the worlds; one leads to a peaceful married life with Rory while the other leads to adventure and excitement with the Doctor. Amy returns to Leadworth and rejoins Rory in defending her <b>house</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Eknodine whilst the Doctor is trying to rescue people from Leadworth in a motor-caravan. As Amy believes she is going into labour, Rory is sprayed by the Eknodine and turns to dust. Amy decides that she is willing to risk her own life for the chance of seeing Rory again and concludes the Leadworth reality is false. Amy and the Doctor drive the motor-caravan into the house, leading to their assumed deaths. The three wake up again on the TARDIS where they are congratulated by the Dream Lord, who then reactivates the TARDIS. After the Dream Lord's departure Amy and Rory are surprised by the Doctor when he directs the TARDIS to self-destruct, apparently killing them all.|$|E
