50|$|Being a {{development}} class, the Moth {{has evolved from}} a hull in the 1930s that could {{best be described as}} a heavy, narrow scow or a blunt nosed skiff, (weighing about 50 kg) to today’s remarkable <b>foilers</b> with hull weights of under 10 kg. Designs have run the gamut from wide skiffs without wings, to lightweight scows, to wedge-shaped hulls characterized with narrow waterlines and hiking wings out to the maximum permitted beam. Likewise, the sail plan has evolved from cotton sails on wooden spars, through the fully battened Dacron sails on aluminum spars, to the windsurfer inspired sleeved film sails on carbon masts seen today.|$|R
50|$|The 2011 International Moth World Championships was in Belmont, Australia on 8-14 January 2011. This {{event was}} the biggest Moth Worlds in a long time, with 109 boats mostly <b>foilers</b> but {{including}} several scow and skiff Moths. The winner was Nathan Outteridge of Australia in a Mach 2. A solid wing sail although not strictly allowed by the class rules was allowed to sail by virtue of a vote of the class membership. The wing was not sailed by its developers Bora Gulari and George Peet as {{it was clear to}} them that it was not yet developed enough to take the championship. Charlie McKee sailed with the wing and came 23rd despite a number of breakages.|$|R

In the first example, the destruction of The control of wakes is a subject of paramount importance in aircraft and automobile industry. in 3 D wakes. The first example is the destruction of trailing vortices shed by airplane wings. The second example is the drag reduction behind a bluff body. Both examples {{illustrate the}} need of active control. In the first case, there is little hope that any reasonable passive device could prevent Computers & Fluids 33 (2004) 697 – 713 * Corresponding author. Depending on the particular application, wake control can have various goals and can be achieved either by passive or active strategies. Passive control mostly operates through shape optimization and often results in the addition of appendices like <b>foilers</b> or ribblets {{to the surface of}} the obstacle. Active control implies that one is ready to impart energy on the flow by means of actuators on the surface of the obstacle, keeping in mind that this energy must be included in the global energy budget to conclude on the efficiency of the particular control strategy. We focus here on two examples, each of them emphasizing a specific challenge of active controltrailing vortices, we show that stochastic optimization is a flexible tool to identify vortex systems enhancing natural instabilities. In the second example, the problem of drag reduction in a cylinder wake, a priori information on the flow dynamics is highly desirable and we give some preliminary results which should be useful to select the most efficient parameters in an optimization strategy based on differential rotation of th...|$|R

50|$|VPLP’s initial {{project was}} to design a racing {{trimaran}} commissioned by skipper Vincent Levy for the 1984 OSTAR, (otherwise known as the English Transat). This 50 ft <b>foiler</b> baptized Gerard Lambert {{was the first in}} a long line of racing trimarans that created a name for the firm and established the young designers as innovators in the field of naval architecture.VPLP designed their first cruising catamaran in 1984 for Lagoon, which was then a division of Jeanneau Techniques Avancées. The Lagoon 55 was the first in more than 240 cruising catamarans designed by VPLP. Lagoon is now part of the CNB division of Groupe Bénéteau and has produced more than 2000 catamarans with worldwide distribution. VPLP are the principal designers for the Lagoon fleet of sailing catamarans.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to the {{numerical}} study of a 1 : 20 th model-scale wingsail typical of America’s Cup yachts like AC 72, AC 62, AC 45 or any C class catamaran to gain insight in its complex aerodynamic behavior and to prepare a wind-tunnel campain. This rigging has still not been much studied and needs more knowledge. This study is based on CFD simulations of the flow around the wingsail by resolving Navier-Stokes equations. Two modeling issues are investigated: the Unsteady Reynolds Average Navier-Stokes (URANS) and the Large Eddy Simulation (LES). These numerical approaches are used to characterize the wingsail aerodynamic behavior and variations with some key design and trim parameters (camber, slot width, angle of attack, flap thickness). Unsteady modeling are used to characterize the stall behavior and improve our understanding of the flow physics that may occur in such configurations. The analysis of the results shows transition phenomena due to a laminar separation bubble and strong interaction of boundary layers of main and flap in the slot region. LES results give flow physics understanding and qualitative elements of validation of the URANS simulations. Both URANS and LES results emphasized the central role of the slot geometry and its associated leakage flow in the onset of stall. Some key parameters of the wingsail are identified. The stall behavior for low and high camber (through flap deflection) is characterized showing differences in both configurations. These differences are related to the leakage flow in the slot where a non-linear coupling between flap deflection, slot width and flap thickness takes place. These results illustrate the complex aerodynamic of multi-element wingsail and that a better knowledge of its behavior is necessary to open roads for better design and enhanced performances for future multihull yachts and <b>foilers...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{deals with}} the {{application}} of activitybased management (ABM) in a small company. The project took place in G. E. Mustill, a company that produces machines for the photo framing industry. This project aims to develop an ABM system for the company which leads to appropriate improvement actions based on a make or buy decision about di � erent parts of the machine, `four-head foiler’. Firstly, a theoretical framework {{for the design of}} an ABM system is developed. Then, secondly it is used to improve the business performance of four-head <b>foiler</b> manufacturing. The activities required to manufacture this machine are identi ® ed and then quanti ® ed by their consumption of resources. The factors causing or driving the cost (cost driver) of an activity in question have been identi ® ed and used to identify the value-adding and non-valueadding activities. Also, some suggestions are o � ered to improve the performance of the company using the ABM system. 1...|$|E
