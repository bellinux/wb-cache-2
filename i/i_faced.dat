His daughter Elizabeth <b>I</b> <b>faced</b> another Catholic rebellion, the Rising of the North. The region {{would become the}} centre of recusancy as prominent Catholic families in Cumbria, Lancashire and Yorkshire refused to convert to Protestantism. Royal power over the region was exercised through the Council of the North at King's Manor, York, {{which was founded in}} 1484 by Richard III. The Council existed intermittently for the next two centuries – its final incarnation was created {{in the aftermath of the}} Pilgrimage of Grace and was chiefly an institution for providing order and dispensing justice.|$|E
25|$|Both {{countries}} were {{exhausted by the}} huge military efforts that had taken a heavy toll on the population and economy. Simeon's successor Peter I (r.927–969) negotiated a favourable peace treaty. The Byzantines agreed to recognize him as Emperor of Bulgaria and the Bulgarian Orthodox Church as an independent Patriarchate, {{as well as to}} pay an annual tribute. The peace was reinforced with a marriage between Peter and Romanos's granddaughter Irene Lekapene. This agreement ushered in a period of 40 years of peaceful relations between the two powers. During the first years of his reign, Peter <b>I</b> <b>faced</b> revolts by two of his three brothers, John in 928 and Michael in 930, but both were quelled. During most of his subsequent rule until 965, PeterI presided over a Golden Age of the Bulgarian state in a period of political consolidation, economic expansion and cultural activity.|$|E

No ships had been begun since the Admiral class, and of those only [...] had been completed. A June 1919 Admiralty plan outlined a post-war fleet with 33 battleships and eight battlecruisers, which could be built and sustained for £171 million a year (approximately £ today); only £84 million was available. The Admiralty then demanded, as an absolute minimum, a further eight battleships. These {{would have been the}} G3 battlecruisers, with 16-inch guns and high speed, and the s, with [...] guns. Its navy severely limited by the Treaty of Versailles, Germany did not participate in this three-way naval building competition. Most of the German dreadnought fleet was scuttled at Scapa Flow by its crews in 1919; the remainder were handed over as war prizes.|$|E

To quote McKinstry, Ipswich had neither [...] "glittering {{pedigree}} or status" [...] nor [...] "strong footballing tradition"—the club had joined the Football League only in 1938, and its home ground at Portman Road was small and basic. One of the team's advantages was the patronage of the aristocratic Cobbold brewing family, to which the chairman and much of the club hierarchy belonged. [...] "I had no plan for Ipswich when I went there," [...] Ramsey later said. [...] "In fact the first thing I had to do was to forget my set ideas on how football ought to be played.

Other NFL greats such as Hall of Fame tackles Bob Brown and Rayfield Wright, rank Jack among the top players they faced. Opposing quarterbacks ranked Youngblood highly, with two of them, Fran Tarkenton and Roger Staubach, stating that Jack was the top defensive lineman they faced in their careers.

[...] Running backs also entered the chorus, [...] "I remember bouncing off Jack Youngblood {{and it was just}} like a pillar of strength over there on the defense," [...] Rocky Bleier recalled. [...] "Jack played hurt, he played tough, and he was a great opponent." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{disastrous}} secession of Greece was by {{no means}} the end of the Sultan's tribulations. Ironically, the gravest threat to the Ottoman Empire's integrity that emerged was not from Russia, but from Egypt. Having lost his fleet and the hereditary fiefdom promised to his son, Muhammad Ali now demanded as compensation that Ibrahim be appointed wali (viceroy) of the Ottoman province of Syria (which included modern Syria, Lebanon and Palestine). When the Sultan refused, Muhammad Ali sent an army under Ibrahim into Syria in 1831. Swiftly defeating the local Ottoman forces and overrunning the province, Ibrahim crushed an Ottoman army in Anatolia and prepared to march on Constantinople. He was forced to stop by the intervention of Britain and France, which, however, obliged the Porte to grant Ibrahim control of not only Syria, but also the island of Crete and of the Hijaz region of Arabia. His rule was characteristically oppressive and sparked a series of indigenous revolts, notably the Palestinian Arab revolt of 1834. In 1839, the Sultan launched a military attempt to oust him, but the Ottoman army was again routed by Ibrahim, who again invaded Anatolia. At this critical juncture, the exhausted Mahmud II died and was succeeded by his teenage son, Abdulmecid <b>I.</b> <b>Faced</b> with the spectre of the [...] disintegration of the Ottoman Empire, the British and Austrian navies intervened directly in the Levant by blockading the Nile Delta coast and forced Ali to withdraw his forces from Syria (1840). In return, the Allies obliged the young Sultan to grant Ali an unprecedented hereditary vice-regency over Egypt. The dynasty that Ali founded ruled Egypt until the nationalist/military coup of 1952. But de facto independence from the Ottomans was soon replaced by de facto rule from Whitehall. After the construction of the Suez Canal in 1869, which instantly became the main shipping-route to British India, successive British governments decided that Egypt was simply too strategic to be left to its own devices and imposed a military protectorate over the country. British troops were stationed in Egypt from 1875 {{to the end of the}} Second World War in 1945 and Ali's successors were reduced to being puppets of British imperial policy.|$|E
