60|$|I {{signed to}} her to go on. If I had {{answered}} in words, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> her to leave the room.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, or <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> {{you when}} I read the program this evening. The young villain pretended {{that his name}} was Marmaduke Sharp." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You mustn't think, Dad, that I {{meant to}} deceive you. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> {{you at the}} beginning--you know I would--if it hadn't all {{happened}} so suddenly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know. She is {{in trouble}} about the shop-—the cigars. Oh! <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> <b>told!</b> You won't-—you won't—-Mrs. Henderson?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And what <b>I</b> <b>should</b> never <b>have</b> <b>told</b> you, {{were it not}} my {{only chance}} of curing you of this foolish passion. I am an American slave!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because," [...] replied my father, with a laugh, [...] "I didn't {{want you}} to know. If I could have done without you, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> <b>told</b> you now." ...|$|R
6000|$|Lady Mason {{herself was}} the first to speak. [...] "I did not know {{yesterday}} that Lucius would come," [...] she said, [...] "or <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If you {{had allowed}} me, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> you all, Miss Mackenzie. Mr Maguire is not married, {{and never has}} been married, as far as I know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should have}} waited," [...] she confessed, [...] "until you cared {{for me a}} great deal, and then <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> you. That, I admit, was my intention." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} it is truthfulness," [...] he told her. [...] "That is no virtue on my part. It is sheer necessity. I am quite sure that if I had not been obliged <b>I</b> <b>should</b> never <b>have</b> <b>told</b> you that it was I who stared at you from the Common there, one of a hideous little band of trippers. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not even <b>have</b> <b>told</b> you about my wife. It is all so humiliating." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My dear,' said Mrs. Weston, 'I {{know you}} may be trusted; but <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> <b>told</b> you, as you may find such a secret {{embarrassing}} when you are with your young friends.' ...|$|R
60|$|HE. Yes: I'm {{capable of}} {{anything}} now. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> <b>told</b> {{him the truth}} by halves; and now I will not lie by halves. I'll wallow in the honor of a gentleman.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing very much; mamma {{asked me}} a {{question}} or two this morning, and I said I was coming here. Had she asked me why, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, sir, {{we agreed}} {{that there was no}} danger of my getting the prize. If I had got it, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> you everything. Reynolds will tell you that, sir.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For my father, I cannot help it. Had he not {{threatened}} me <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> him also. As he {{has done}} so, you must tell him. But give him my kindest love." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She merely smiled, {{and went}} on: 'And <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> <b>told</b> you of my {{engagement}} if I {{had not thought}} it would be safer to do so, considering the story you are going to tell your husband.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly not. If you <b>had</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> <b>told</b> you. But as I named a sum, it {{is right}} that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> explain to you that that man succeeded in {{lessening}} it by six or seven thousand pounds." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{think she}} asked me. But had she done so, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> <b>told</b> her. <b>I</b> don't think it {{nice to be}} asked about one's letters. If one wishes to show them, one does so without being asked." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{though he}} had such a bad cold. He said he could not be spared; and he was out all {{yesterday}} till bedtime, or <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> him grandmamma was not well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I {{had meant}} to give you away <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> Mrs. Fitzgerald at once that I had seen you take her bracelet, instead of {{following}} you out on to the roof." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is very wonderful," [...] {{she said}} at last. [...] "Wonderful ... that you can care for me.... Oh, if I had known how noble you were, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> you all at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No. I think {{everything}} was given up. If this thing had been of value <b>I</b> <b>should,</b> perhaps, <b>have</b> <b>told</b> the sheik; {{but as it}} was only written papers, and of no use to anyone, I did not trouble to do so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never! We must {{prevent that}} at all costs. I had rather see him dead before me, than the husband of such a woman. Why is she {{permitted}} to visit homes like mine? <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been <b>told</b> this sooner," [...] exclaimed my lady angrily.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's {{something}} <b>I</b> <b>should</b> perhaps <b>have</b> <b>told</b> you, sir, though I don't {{know whether}} it will interest you. Anyway, not long ago Frank and I were up at the Chinese colony behind the settlement near our ranch. Perhaps you have been there?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is yours}} already, lovely Princess!" [...] he cried, taking {{her hand in}} his; [...] "but for the horrible enchantment which kept me silent <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> you long ago how dearly I love you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> you not. Good gracious! has {{it come to}} this, {{that you}} {{correspond}} with a young gentleman without my leave, and when you know that I would not have given it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not if it be a refusal, Bell. Think well of {{it before}} you do that. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> you that our uncle wishes this match, {{and that he will}} remove any {{difficulty}} there might be about money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I {{had thought}} you would take this matter to heart, Puntojee, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> <b>told</b> you about it. I did so because I thought you could {{scarcely}} be stained, much longer, without demanding the reason for what must have seemed so strange a thing.|$|R
6000|$|... "You know, Jeanne," [...] Harry said, {{putting his}} hands on the girl's shoulders, [...] "that I love you; <b>I</b> <b>should</b> never <b>have</b> <b>told</b> you so until I got you home if it hadn't been for this; but though I have never said it, you know I love you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am glad it is safe; it was John's charge, and {{he ought}} to restore it: but you will dream of it, like poor little Johnnie, {{if you take it}} so much to heart. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> <b>told</b> you at night. Put it out of your head, and let us sleep in peace.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'They are the signal. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> you {{all this}} in the village, but I dared not be seen {{speaking}} with you. I galloped through the woods to cut you off, and concealed both my horse and myself.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'As for me,' I said, 'I {{never doubted}} you, knowing {{you to be}} a man, honest, sober, and diligent. If in {{anything}} you had given offence <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> you of it, so great is my frankness towards all men.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You see, dear, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> {{you before}} now,' said Peggotty, 'but I hadn't an opportunity. I {{ought to have}} made it, perhaps, but I couldn't azackly'--that was always the {{substitute}} for exactly, in Peggotty's militia of words--'bring my mind to it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There was a {{question}} about some money which he had paid to her, and which, under existing circumstances, he thought it as well {{that he should not}} pay. Matters of that kind are often necessarily told to lawyers. But <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> <b>told</b> it to you, Will, if I had not thought that it was good news." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your right? What {{could you}} have done? Acknowledge him? And then? Ha!" [...] It was a queer, desperate note of laughter. [...] "There was Plougastel; there was my family. And there was you... you, yourself, who had ceased to care, in whom the fear of {{discovery}} had stifled love. Why <b>should</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> you, then? Why? <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> <b>told</b> you now <b>had</b> there been any other way to... to save you both. Once before I suffered just such dreadful apprehensions when you and he fought in the Bois. I {{was on my way}} to prevent it when you met me. I would have divulged the truth, as a last resource, to avert that horror. But mercifully God spared me the necessity then." ...|$|R
6000|$|LORD GORING. Everything is dangerous, my dear fellow. If it wasn’t so, life wouldn’t {{be worth}} living. [...] . Well, I am bound {{to say that}} <b>I</b> think you <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> her years ago.|$|R
