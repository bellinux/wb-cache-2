30|$|<b>Home-based</b> child <b>care</b> is {{a widely}} used form of non-parental early care and {{education}} both within the U.S. and abroad. The National Study of Early Care and Education estimates over one million paid <b>home-based</b> child <b>care</b> providers or family child care (FCC) providers and close to three million unpaid home-based caregivers or family, friend, and neighbor (FFN) caregivers care for children ages zero to five in the U.S. (NSECE 2015). <b>Home-based</b> child <b>care</b> is also {{an essential component of}} early childhood systems abroad as documented in a recent review of ten countries’ family child care systems (Davis et al. 2012). For example, in Canada a third of children under age four in early care and education arrangements are cared for in FCC homes (Sinha 2014) and nearly a fifth of children in Australia are <b>cared</b> for in <b>home-based</b> child <b>care</b> (Blaxland et al. 2016).|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Home-based</b> primary <b>care</b> for homebound seniors is complex, and {{practice}} constraints are unique. No quality-of-care standards exist. Objective: To identify process quality indicators {{that are essential}} to high-quality, <b>home-based</b> primary <b>care.</b> Design: An expert development panel reviewed established and new quality indicators for applicability to <b>home-based</b> primary <b>care.</b> A separate national evaluation panel used a modified Delphi pro-cess to rate the validity and importance of the potential quality indicators. Participants: Two national panels whose members varied in prac-tice type, location, and setting. Results: The panels considered 260 quality indicators and endorsed 200 quality indicators that cover 23 geriatric conditions. Twenty-one (10. 5 %) quality indicators were newly created, 52 (26 %) were modified, and 127 (63. 5 %) were unchanged. The quality indicators have decreased emphasis on interventions and have placed greater emphasis on quality of life. Limitations: The quality indicator set may not apply to all home-bound seniors and might be difficult to implement for a typical <b>home-based</b> primary <b>care</b> program. Conclusions: The quality indicator set provides a comprehensive <b>home-based</b> primary <b>care</b> quality framework and will allow for future comparative research.

40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at www. springerlink. comObjective To compare the health-related quality of life (HRQL) of 326 children and adolescents aged 6 – 17 years living in <b>home-based</b> foster <b>care</b> in metropolitan Adelaide, South Australia with the HRQL of {{a random sample of}} 3, 582 children aged 6 – 17 years living in the community in Australia. Method In both groups, HRQL was assessed using the 50 -item version of the Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ-PF 50) completed by caregivers/parents, and the 87 -item self-report version of the Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ-CF 87) completed by 13 – 17 year olds. Results Young people in <b>home-based</b> foster <b>care</b> had significantly poorer HRQL {{in a wide range of}} different domains than those in the general community. Furthermore, among children in <b>home-based</b> foster <b>care,</b> those with mental health problems had significantly poorer HRQL in many domains than those without mental health problems. Demographic and placement characteristics of the children in <b>home-based</b> foster <b>care</b> were not significantly associated with differences in HRQL.

40|$|Background: There {{is limited}} {{evidence}} regarding {{the provision of}} <b>home-based</b> postnatal <b>care,</b> resulting in a weak evidence-base for policy formulation and the further development of <b>home-based</b> postnatal <b>care</b> services. Aim: To explore the structure and organisation of public hospital <b>home-based</b> postnatal <b>care</b> in Victoria, Australia. Methods: An online survey including mostly closed-ended questions was sent to representatives of all public maternity providers in July 2011. Findings: The response rate of 87 % (67 / 77) included rural (70 %; n = 47), regional (15 %; n = 10) and metropolitan (15 %; n = 10) services. The majority (96 %, 64 / 67) provided <b>home-based</b> postnatal <b>care.</b> The median number of visits for primiparous women was two and for multiparous women, one. The main reason for no visit was the woman declining. Two-thirds of services attempted to provide some continuity of carer for <b>home-based</b> postnatal <b>care.</b> Routine maternal and infant observations were broadly consistent across the services, and various systems were in place to protect the safety of staff members during home visits. Few services had a dedicated <b>home-based</b> postnatal <b>care</b> coordinator. Discussion and conclusion: This study demonstrates {{that the majority of}} women receive at least one home-based postnatal visit, and that service provision on the whole is similar across the state. Further work should explore the optimum number and timing of visits, what components of care are most valued by women, and what model best ensures the timely detection and prevention of postpartum complications, be they psychological or physiological...|$|R

40|$|This thesis aims {{to uncover}} the dynamics, causes and {{outcomes}} of women's reliance on unregulated <b>home-based</b> child <b>care</b> in Ontario, Canada, and the implications ofthis form of care for women's equality. Drawing on a longitudinal qualitative study, I examine the diverse experience of 14 women using <b>home-based</b> child <b>care</b> and engaged in both paid work/training and care work for {{children under the age}} of six, and draw comparisons with users of other forms of child care. I argue that <b>home-based</b> child <b>care</b> involves high levels of instability for continuity of care and is chosen largely as a default position based on economic considerations. It represents a compromise between the demands of social reproduction and paid work/training that entangles mothers in relations of exploitation with care providers.

Family caregiving in <b>home-based</b> end-of-life <b>care</b> was portrayed in this study as 3 dialectical relational care experiences: (1) prioritizing care recipient needs–ignoring own needs, (2) feeling connected–feeling isolated, and (3) juggling to manage– struggling to survive.

However, the cost trimming effect of <b>home-based</b> hospice <b>care</b> in hospital has yet not been explored. This study evaluates {{the impact of}} <b>home-based</b> hospice <b>care</b> on end-of-life expenditure in hospitals with different spending intensity. This is a population-based retrospective study in Taiwan. Cancer decedents were identified in the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) from 2009 to 2011.

40|$|Background: <b>Home-based</b> {{specialist}} palliative <b>care</b> {{services are}} developed {{to meet the}} needs of the patients in advanced stage of cancer at home with physical symptoms and distress. Specialist home care services are intended to improve symptom control and quality of life, enable patients to stay at home, and avoid unnecessary hospital admission. Materials and Methods: Total 690 new cases registered under <b>home-based</b> palliative <b>care</b> service in the year 2012 were prospectively studied to assess the impact of specialist home-based services using Edmonton symptom assessment scale (ESAS) and other parameters. Results: Out of the 690 registered cases, 506 patients received <b>home-based</b> palliative <b>care.</b> 50. 98 % patients were cared for at home, 28. 85 % patients needed hospice referral and 20. 15 % patients needed brief period of hospitalization. All patients receiving specialist home care had good relief of physical symptoms (P < 0. 005). 83. 2 % patients received out of hours care (OOH) through liaising with local general practitioners; 42. 68 % received home based bereavement care and 91. 66 % had good bereavement outcomes.
