25|$|Serbian vulkodlaks {{traditionally}} had {{the habit}} of congregating annually in the winter months, when they would strip off their wolf skins and <b>hang</b> <b>them</b> from trees.

25|$|In 1985, {{it emerged}} that young ex-inmates of the school, sentenced to jail terms for crimes {{committed}} while there, had subsequently been {{the victims of}} torture at the Jackson County jail.

25|$|Information: It {{originated}} from a Chinese folk legend concerning two stars-the Weaver Star (Vega) and the Cowherd Star (Altair)-who {{were said to}} be lovers who could meet only once a year on the 7th night of the 7th month provided it didn't rain and flood the Milky Way. It was named Tanabata after a weaving maiden from a Japanese legend, named Orihime who was believed to make clothes for the gods. People often write wishes and romantic aspirations on long, narrow strips of coloured paper and <b>hang</b> <b>them</b> on bamboo branches along with other small ornaments.|$|E
25|$|Lehi prisoners {{captured}} by the British generally refused to present a defence when brought to trial. They would only read out statements in which they declared that the court, representing an occupying force, had no jurisdiction over them and therefore was illegal. For the same reason, Lehi prisoners refused to plead for amnesty, {{even when it was}} clear that this would have spared them the death penalty. In one case Moshe Barazani, a Lehi member, and Meir Feinstein, an Irgun member, committed suicide in prison with a grenade smuggled inside an orange so the British could not <b>hang</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
25|$|The game cuts to {{two years}} previously, 1864, with Ray and Thomas {{fighting}} for the Confederacy in the American Civil War. Near the Chattahoochee River, the brothers help to repulse an attack by the Union Army. However, rather than go on the offensive, Colonel Barnsby orders a retreat to Jonesboro to reinforce supply lines. The McCalls refuse to comply, and instead desert {{to try to save}} their nearby home. When they arrive, they find the house partially destroyed, their mother dead, and William by her bedside. Vowing to return and rebuild the house, they leave, knowing they are fugitives. A short while later, Barnsby arrives, vowing to track them down and <b>hang</b> <b>them</b> for their desertion.|$|E

25|$|When news began leaking {{that the}} three men were to be {{executed}} and a country-wide curfew would be imposed at 11:00 PM, Paglin was at a movie. After being called out and told the news, he hurried to Begin's safe house, where he was meeting with members of his high command, where doubts were being raised over the feasibility of hanging the sergeants with the British and Haganah on high alert. Paglin, {{who had not been}} allowed to venture into British-controlled areas by the high command for the previous six months, asked to take personal charge of the operation. He was convinced that the sergeants could be hanged inside the plant, and the bodies could be moved to an orange grove and hung there, since attempting to move the two alive would be too great a risk. Since the hangings were meant as a 'lesson for all to see', Irgun wanted the bodies hung up in public. That was so clear that the mayor of Tel Aviv, Yisrael Rokah, feared Irgun would <b>hang</b> <b>them</b> in the city's main square, while in Netanya it was feared that they would be hanged on local lamp posts. Begin approved Paglin's plan. Paglin then slipped {{out of the house and}} drove to Netanya in his car, where he collected four Irgun men; Benjamin Kaplan, Yoel Kimchi, Avraham Rubin, and Yosef Meller. They arrived at the diamond plant in the afternoon.|$|E
500|$|According {{to reports}} in the 1870s, intense rain, malaria, {{pneumonia}} and dysentery caused many deaths. During this time the authorities also embarked on testing of pharmaceutical drugs like quinine (cinchona alkaloid) by forcibly feeding it to 10,000 prisoners which resulted in severe side effects such as nausea, diarrhea and depression; as result the prisoners started injuring each other so that authorities would <b>hang</b> <b>them.</b> Instead, {{a new system of}} [...] "flogging and a reduced diet" [...] was introduced and they were made to sleep in a kind of [...] "trellis-work cage". The prisoners also faced hardships from the indigenous tribes, some of whom were cannibals, who tortured and killed them while working in the field, and also attacked the colony.|$|E
500|$|Skinner {{tries to}} keep the {{children}} under control, forcing them to stay together in the cafeteria and eat apples, relish and (only if they behave well enough) mayonnaise and will not let them go home until the snow melts. After Nelson tries to escape, Skinner unearths his U.S. Army memorabilia and is reminded of {{the days when he}} commanded respect from his troops. Skinner tries to command respect from the students, and briefly succeeds after threatening to <b>hang</b> <b>them</b> in their clothes on hooks on the wall if they rebel. Bart tries to tunnel his way out, but Skinner stops him, and after Willie refuses to destroy the tunnel, Skinner does so himself, but is stuck in the resulting cave-in. The students rebel and eventually tie Skinner up in a dodge ball bag. They then set about [...] "going nuts" [...] such as racing trolleys in the school hallway, even burning numerous books in the school's library.|$|E
5000|$|After The F-Ups {{break up}} in 2006, Travis Allen, Chris DeWerd and Andy Collett {{reformed}} with Bill Martin and Alex Allen (Travis' brother) as <b>Hang</b> <b>'Em</b> High. <b>Hang</b> <b>'Em</b> High released their debut album (called [...] "Hang 'Em High") {{which is only}} available on <b>Hang</b> <b>'Em</b> High's Myspace page. After the recording of their first album, Mario Ortiz replaced Chris DeWerd on rhythm guitar. With newly recruited member, they performed at various venues and also an online venue called [...] "Deep Rock Drive". <b>Hang</b> <b>'Em</b> High released several YouTube videos {{under the name of}} [...] "Doctornoise". Polls on their official website show that the fans' favourite song is [...] "Old School Fight Song" [...] and the fans' second favourite song is [...] "Not For Me".

500|$|During {{the first}} season, the writing staff used {{most of the}} story ideas that were in Hillenburg's series bible and they had {{problems}} on how to generate new ideas. At one point, the writing staff went to the beach for inspiration for a possible episode. However, the day [...] "was overcast and cold, so we [...] {{had to stay in}} the car." [...] Drymon said [...] "We didn't come up with too many ideas that day." [...] Story editor Peter Burns left, and the crew had Merriwether Williams to overtake. Hillenburg said to Williams that [...] "it was her responsibility to get us [...] to come up with new ideas." [...] Drymon said [...] " [...] is a tall order." [...] Williams gave Drymon a book called Zen in the Art of Writing, written by Ray Bradbury, that catalogs a collection of essays about writing processes. One of the ways in the book to inspire plots was [...] "to write nouns that interested him [...] on a note card and <b>hang</b> <b>them</b> in his office. He felt just having the word in his eyesight would get his mind working." [...] Williams took this scheme and made it into [...] "a writing exercise." [...] In writing meetings, the staff would all enumerate 10 nouns on strips of paper and place them in a hat. The hat would be passed throughout and a writer would have a limited time to spawn an idea based on the noun he wrote. Drymon said [...] "It would almost always start a discussion, and we wound up getting a lot of episodes out of it." [...] Furthermore, Drymon said that Williams [...] "really came up with a great addition to the process." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{symbolism}} of the flag now serves {{a wide variety of}} purposes. [...] It is commonly reproduced in [...] dimensions, and car flag versions are also sold. [...] The flag is also available in [...] dimension versions. [...] The flag has become a celebratory symbol for Chicago Cubs fans who purchase reproductions and take them to games at home and on the road to show support. The fans wave them after victories at Wrigley Field, and they <b>hang</b> <b>them</b> in the stands during playoff series. [...] Some fans fly a win flag in place of or in addition to the Flag of the United States on days when the Cubs win. Since 1998, the flags have become ever more popular, with demand reaching a level where they are sold at Wrigley Field. In 2007, with the Cubs in playoff contention {{for the first time in}} 3 years, the Cubs' victory tune, Go Cubs Go! became more popular among the fans. Due to the song's growing popularity, after wins at home, Cubs TV broadcasters Len Kasper and Bob Brenly would have their microphones shut off, while the camera pans around the stadium to view the jubilant fans as Go Cubs Go! plays in the background. After fans discovered this, they started purchasing [...] "W" [...] flags and waving them after wins at home as an attempt to get on TV. However, in seasons when the Cubs are performing poorly the tradition has led to parody and satire, such as stories of the Cubs retiring the win flag due to signs of neglect. While not having the popularity of the Win Flag, the Loss Flag has become increasingly popular with clubs who traditionally have rivalries with the Cubs, such as the St. Louis Cardinals, Milwaukee Brewers, or Chicago White Sox. Fans of those teams wave the blue flag after their team defeats the Cubs at Busch Stadium or Guaranteed Rate Field. However, because of the enormous fan base that the Cubs hold, it isn't uncommon to see fans at games on the road waving their [...] "W" [...] flags during Cubs wins on the road.|$|E

2500|$|In London, the Worshipful Company of Pattenmakers {{remains the}} Livery Company, {{formerly}} guild of the Patten-makers, or Patteners, and their adopted church remains St Margaret Pattens.

2500|$|In total, it is {{estimated}} that over 2,000 Greeks of Cyprus were slaughtered as an act of revenge for participating in the revolution. This was a very significant proportion of the total population of the island at the time.
