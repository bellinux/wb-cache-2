5|$|When Nicholas {{returned}} to Scotland, and the <b>exact</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> his activities {{over the next}} few years, remain unclear matters. His episcopal rank makes it likely that he attended the parliaments and took part in the affairs of the kingdom {{during the early years of}} his episcopate, but direct proof is lacking.|$|E
5|$|Alexander {{presided over}} the {{organisation}} of his diocese into prebends to support the cathedral clergy; he established at least one new prebend and augmented two others. He also attended the church councils in 1127 and 1129 that were convened by William de Corbeil, the Archbishop of Canterbury. Later, during 1133 and 1134, he and the archbishop quarrelled, but the <b>exact</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> their dispute is unknown. William and Alexander travelled to Normandy in 1134 to seek out King Henry to settle their dispute.|$|E
5|$|Although many Anahim volcanoes are {{surrounded}} by Chilcotin Group basalt flows, the <b>exact</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> their relationship is unknown. It {{is unlikely that the}} Anahim volcanoes ever were a source area for the Chilcotin basalts as they have distinct transitional geochemistries. The Chilcotin Group is interpreted to be related to back-arc extension behind the Cascadia subduction zone.|$|E
50|$|He {{resigned}} to resume professional practice and give that attention to business affairs that the <b>exacting</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> judicial duties precluded. Bradley was chosen Bussey Professor of Law at Harvard Law School {{and filled the}} chair until 1879.|$|R
50|$|Like the {{black-and-white}} film process, the C-41 {{process can be}} used to push process films. Due to the complexity of the film and <b>exacting</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the process, the results vary widely; as with black-and-white negatives, the process generally results in a negative that is higher in contrast and sometimes higher in grain.|$|R

5|$|Christy has {{received}} mixed commentary from critics—much of it relating to her storyline with Billie, which {{was compared to}} those from previous seasons. Her role as a villain received positive attention, while Patterson's acting was cited as over-exaggerated. The <b>exact</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> Christy's morality and her status as the season's antagonist {{have been the subject}} of debate among television critics and the series' fans.|$|E
5|$|The Osiris myth {{reached its}} basic form in or before the 24th century BCE. Many of its {{elements}} originated in religious ideas, but {{the struggle between}} Horus and Set may have been partly inspired by a regional conflict in Egypt's early history or prehistory. Scholars have tried to discern the <b>exact</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the events {{that gave rise to}} the story, but they have reached no definitive conclusions.|$|E
5|$|There is {{debate about}} the <b>exact</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> phreatomagmatic eruptions, and some {{scientists}} believe that fuel-coolant reactions may be more critical to the explosive nature than thermal contraction. Fuel coolant reactions may fragment the volcanic material by propagating stress waves, widening cracks and increasing surface area that ultimately leads to rapid cooling and explosive contraction-driven eruptions.|$|E
50|$|Shackleton {{was forced}} to stop {{painting}} in 1907 as her sight deteriorated, affecting her ability to execute the fine detail in her work. Her medical condition may {{have been caused by}} the <b>exacting</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> her work. She died completely blind, and a spinster, on 10 November 1914 at her home in Rathgar, Dublin. She was buried at the Friends Burial Ground, Blackrock, Dublin.|$|R
50|$|Due to the <b>exacting</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> legal {{forms and}} {{the time and effort}} {{required}} to prepare legal documents, form books were created as an aid in the drafting process. These books conserve time and serve as a reference to attorneys and law students seeking to use them in their practice. The importance of these books is not to be underestimated, as a form lacking proper language or information may jeopardize court proceedings.|$|R
25|$|The details <b>of</b> the <b>exact</b> {{chemical}} <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> {{liquid water}} {{are not well}} understood; some theories suggest that water's unusual behaviour is {{as a result of}} it having 2 liquid states.|$|R
5|$|After being {{assigned}} to cover Roosevelt during her husband's first presidential campaign, Hickok {{struck up a}} close relationship with the soon-to-be First Lady. For several years, the two corresponded almost every day, traveled together, and professed emotional and physical affection for one another. The <b>exact</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> this relationship has been widely discussed by historians; some have argued that the relationship was clearly romantic or erotic, while others have argued that historians have been misled by Roosevelt's exuberant letters. It is known, and was known in the White House press corps at the time, that Hickok was a lesbian. More than 3,000 letters from the pair's correspondence are preserved at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum.|$|E
5|$|Although {{little is}} known about the <b>exact</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> Tréhot's {{relationship}} with Renoir while she was modeling; she is said to have given birth to a baby boy named Pierre on 14 December 1868, but it is unclear what became of him and he may have died as an infant. On 21 July 1870, Tréhot gave birth to a baby girl named Jeanne (d. 1934) who was given to a wet nurse to raise as her own. Renoir continued to secretly support Jeanne financially until he died (and after his death with the help of Ambroise Vollard), but never publicly or legally acknowledged that she was his daughter during his lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Around 877, Æthelred {{wrote to}} Pope John VIII to {{complain}} about King Alfred's conduct towards Canterbury. The <b>exact</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the dispute is not clear, but the reply from the pope to the archbishop still exists. The pope told the archbishop that Canterbury had papal support and that the pope had written to the king urging the king to respect {{the rights of the}} archbishop. The writer Justin Pollard sees this letter as evidence of papal support for the deposition of Alfred, which Pollard alleges occurred at Christmas 878 and that the deposition was supported by Æthelred. Other historians, however, do not agree that there was a deposition of the king supported by the archbishop at this time.|$|E
5000|$|A {{fair number}} of higher polycycles {{containing}} the biphenylene nucleus have also been prepared, some having considerable antiaromatic character. [...] In general, additional 6-membered rings add further aromatic character, and additional 4-membered and 8-membered rings add antiaromatic character. However, the <b>exact</b> <b>natures</b> <b>of</b> the additions and fusions greatly affect the perturbations of the biphenylene system, with many fusions resulting in counter-intuitive stabilization by 4n rings, or destabilization by 6-membered rings. This has led to significant interest in the systems by theoretical chemists and graph theoreticians.|$|R
5|$|In Bertrand's {{persistent}} carbenes, the unsaturated carbon is {{bonded to}} a phosphorus and a silicon. However, these compounds seem to exhibit some alkynic properties, and when published the <b>exact</b> carbenic <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> these red oils was in debate.|$|R
40|$|Host-cell {{invasion}} by Cryptosporidium {{is a complex}} process that requires many different factors derived from both the parasite and the host cell. However, the <b>exact</b> <b>natures</b> <b>of</b> the processes {{have yet to be}} resolved. Here, research on different components of the invasion process is put in context, and the sequence of events and pathways associated with the establishment of Cryptosporidium in its unique niche is clarified. In addition, initial parasite–host contact, host-cellinvasion and host-cell responses are described. The roles of parasite and host-cell-derived components in the invasion process are examined, as is the question of whether Cryptosporidium actively invades cells and to what extent host-cell responses are involved...|$|R
5|$|As stated above, the exosome complex {{contains}} many proteins with ribonuclease domains. The <b>exact</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> these ribonuclease domains has changed across evolution from bacterial to archaeal to eukaryotic complexes as various activities have been gained and lost. The exosome {{is primarily a}} 3'-5' exoribonuclease, meaning that it degrades RNA molecules from their 3' end. Exoribonucleases contained in exosome complexes are either phosphorolytic (the RNase PH-like proteins) or, in eukaryotes, hydrolytic (the RNase R and RNase D domain proteins). The phosphorolytic enzymes use inorganic phosphate to cleave the phosphodiester bonds - releasing nucleotide diphosphates. The hydrolytic enzymes use water to hydrolyse these bonds - releasing nucleotide monophosphates.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{response}} to Chad was mixed; some reviewers praised the sensationalism of the incest storyline with Whitney, while others criticized {{his relationship with}} Vincent as an irresponsible and problematic representation of racial and sexual identity. The character marks a notable step in daytime television and soap opera history; {{it was the first}} depiction in a soap opera of two men having sex. Chad has also been cited as expanding the representation of LGBT characters of color on daytime television. Divins discussed the storyline with his gay friends and researched LGBT culture to better shape his performance. Media outlets expressed varying opinions of the <b>exact</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> Chad's sexual orientation.|$|E
5|$|Governance of the Jerseys {{also created}} {{problems}} for Andros. James had awarded the territory {{west of the}} Hudson River to proprietors John Berkeley and George Carteret, and Berkeley had then deeded the western portion (which became known as West Jersey) to a partnership of Quakers. Berkeley had not transferred his proprietary rights to this group, and the <b>exact</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the rights James had given both Berkeley and Carteret was disputed, in part because James believed that the second patent granted to him in 1674 overrode the earlier grants he had made to Berkeley and Carteret.|$|E
50|$|Although the <b>exact</b> {{biochemical}} <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the symbiosis remains unclear, {{the bacteria}} likely assist {{the fish in}} breaking down algal nutrients.

5|$|Mass {{transfer}} diffusion {{takes place}} in the case where adparticle sources and traps such as kinks, steps, and vacancies are present. Instead of being dependent only on the jump potential barrier Ediff, diffusion in this regime is now also dependent on the formation energy of mobile adparticles. The <b>exact</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the diffusion environment therefore plays a role in dictating the diffusion rate, since the formation energy of an adparticle is different for each type of surface feature as is described in the Terrace Ledge Kink model.|$|E
5|$|Rowan {{was known}} {{throughout}} his life as an avid gamester. On January 29, 1801, Rowan joined Dr. James Chambers and three other men for a game of cards at Duncan McLean's Tavern in Bardstown. After several beers and games of whist, Chambers suggested playing Vingt-et-un for money instead. Rowan had determined not to gamble during this session of gaming, but impaired by the alcohol, he agreed. After a few hands, an argument broke out between Chambers and Rowan. The <b>exact</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the argument is not known. Some accounts claim it was over who was better able to speak Latin and Greek; others suggest that general insults were exchanged between the two men. A brief scuffle followed the disagreement.|$|E
5|$|Two {{thirds of}} people with Guillain–Barré {{syndrome}} have experienced an infection {{before the onset of}} the condition. Most commonly these are episodes of gastroenteritis or a respiratory tract infection. In many cases, the <b>exact</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the infection can be confirmed. Approximately 30% of cases are provoked by Campylobacter jejuni bacteria, which cause diarrhea. A further 10% are attributable to cytomegalovirus (CMV, HHV-5). Despite this, only very few people with Campylobacter or CMV infections develop Guillain–Barré syndrome (0.25–0.65 per 1000 and 0.6–2.2 per 1000 episodes, respectively). The strain of Campylobacter involved may determine the risk of GBS; different forms of the bacteria have different lipopolysaccharides on their surface, and some may induce illness (see below) while others will not.|$|E

When Parker {{returns to his}} home universe, he uses a Google search to see if his universe has a version of Miles Morales, and is shocked by what he finds, but the <b>exact</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> what he finds is left unrevealed to the reader. This is followed up in the 2017 sequel miniseries Spider-Men II, in which the Earth-616 version of Miles Morales makes his first appearance, and is revealed to be a fully-grown adult with a face covered by several thin scars, who is allied with Taskmaster, and later revealed to have become close friends with the crime boss Kingpin when the two served time together prison.|$|E
5|$|In the 6th century, the Turkic-speaking nomadic Avars {{moved into}} the middle Danube area. Twice (in 562 and 566–567), the Avars {{undertook}} military expeditions against the Franks, and their routes went through the Polish lands. The Avar envoys bribed Slavic chiefs from the lands they did not control, including Pomerania, to secure their participation in Avar raids, but other than that, the <b>exact</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> their relations with the Slavs in Poland is not known. The Avars had some presence or contacts in Poland also in the 7th and 8th centuries, when they left artifacts in the Kraków-Nowa Huta region and elsewhere, including a bronze belt decoration found in the Krakus Mound. This last item, {{from the turn of}} the 8th century, is used to date the mound itself.|$|E
5|$|One {{of the key}} {{aspects of}} Royal Mail's {{modernisation}} drive involved {{the introduction of the}} walk sequencing machine that organises mail into the order the postman will deliver them on his round. The union feared that a national introduction of this equipment would lead to thousands of full-time workers being made redundant and {{a significant increase in the}} number of part-time staff. The Communication Workers Union argued that although it had signed up to this part of the agreement in 2007 and that the plans would make it necessary for some jobs to be lost, it had not understood the <b>exact</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> Royal Mail's plan. Furthermore, the union said that when Royal Mail stopped talking to staff about the long-term effects of job security, there had been no choice other than to threaten a strike to restart discussions. Royal Mail, on the other hand, said that it had not stopped talking to the union and continued to involve it in its modernisation strategy.|$|E
