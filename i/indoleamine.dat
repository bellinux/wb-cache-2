25|$|Serotonin is a monoamine {{neurotransmitter}} {{which has}} been associated with schizophrenia. The psychedelic drug classes indoleamines and phenethylamines can affect serotoninergic 5-HT2A receptors. LSD, an <b>indoleamine,</b> affects startle habituation and prepulse inhibition of startle, which are indicators of human schizophrenia.|$|E
25|$|Microglia and macrophages {{produce the}} vast {{majority}} of quinolinic acid present in the body. This production is increased during an immune response. It is suspected that this is a result of activation of <b>indoleamine</b> dioxygenases (to be specific, IDO-1 and IDO-2) as well as tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) stimulation by inflammatory cytokines (mainly IFN-gamma, but also IFN-beta and IFN-alpha).|$|E
25|$|Normally, a {{low level}} of these glycoproteins is {{detected}} in the maternal serum during the early stages of pregnancy. It appears that the effects of these eu-FEDS associated glycoproteins are manifested only during implantation and the very early development of the embryo. In humans, the expression of such glycoproteins greatly decreases {{toward the end of the}} first trimester. Therefore, more highly targeted mechanisms of immune suppression (such as the expression of the enzyme <b>indoleamine</b> dioxygenase (IDO)) are likely employed by the fetus during the subsequent stages of development. One potential reason for early inactivation of the system is that the immunosuppressive effect of these glycoproteins may be so complete that their continued leakage into the circulatory system could lead to a global suppression of the maternal immune response, compromising the mother's ability to carry the fetus to term.|$|E

2500|$|Several {{other models}} have been {{developed}} that seek to address this hypothetical system for immune tolerance, including the depletion of tryptophan via the enzyme <b>indoleamine</b> dioxygenase (IDO) and {{the expression of the}} nonclassical MHC class I molecule designated HLA-G. However, genetic deletion of IDO in female mice does not lead to the rejection of their foreign fetal offspring, indicating that a redundant system for the suppression of the mother's immune response exists in the uterus during pregnancy. In addition, HLA-G expresses oligosaccharides that are very different from those linked to other HLA class I molecules, so the possibility [...] exists that HLA-G at the fetomaternal interface is itself employing its unusual carbohydrate sequences as functional groups to suppress the mother's immune response.|$|E

50|$|<b>Indoleamine</b> 2,3-dioxygenase is {{the first}} and rate-limiting enzyme of {{tryptophan}} catabolism through the kynurenine pathway, thus causing depletion of tryptophan which can cause halted growth of microbes as well as T cells.

40|$|A {{purification}} {{procedure for}} rat and mouse brain histamine N -methyltransferase (HMT, EC 2. 1. 1. 8) is described which achieves {{the preparation of}} 87 -fold purified rat brain and 166 -fold purified mouse brain enzyme. The purified HMT (MW 29, 000) is inhibited {{by a number of}} physiologically and pharmacologically active amines, among them several methylated <b>indoleamines,</b> at concentrations above 5 ± 10 - 6 M. At concentrations below 1 ± 10 - 7 M, most of the methylated <b>indoleamines</b> stimulate HMT, provided histamine is maintained at, or close to, its optimal concentration as an HMT substrate, namely 1 ± 10 - 5 M. A study {{of the nature of the}} inhibitory process revealed a non-competitive inhibition of HMT by dopamine as against a competitive inhibition of the enzyme by most methylated <b>indoleamines.</b> Increasing the concentration of histamine beyond the optimal value, i. e. to inhibitory levels, resulted in less stimulation. The findings support the notion that MSO elicits the formation in selected brain cells of supranormal amounts of several methylated <b>indoleamines</b> which are able to stimulate HMT (and possibly other methyltransferases, see Salas et al., 1977), thereby causing the depletion of the cerebral levels of S-adenosyl-L-methionine, reported previously (Schatz & Sellinger, 1975 b) ...|$|R
40|$|Copper amine oxidase from lentil {{seedlings}} {{was shown}} {{to be able to}} catalyze the oxidative deamination of the <b>indoleamines</b> tryptamine, 5 -hydroxytryptamine, and 5 -methoxytryptamine. These compounds showed saturation kinetics with K-m values as normal substrates, but their oxidation led to irreversible loss of enzyme activity suggesting a covalent interaction with the enzyme, most probably through its cofactor 6 -hydroxydopa (2, 4, 5 -trihydroxyphenylalanine). These <b>indoleamines</b> acted as irreversible inhibitors of the enzyme only in the absence of oxygen but they brought about changes in the electronic spectra of the enzyme both in aerobiosis and in anaerobiosis. This study reports an the mechanism by which these compounds inhibit lentil amine oxidase which involves first the oxidation of <b>indoleamines</b> bound to 6 -hydroxydopa followed by the formation of an irreversible covalent derivative.

40|$|This thesis aims to {{elucidate}} the molecular mechanism of indoleamine-induced encystment in dinoflagellates. <b>Indoleamines</b> such as melatonin and 5 -methoxytryptamine (5 MT) dose- and time-dependently induced encystment in {{many species of}} dinoflagellates. Such responses are reversible and liand-selective. Together, partial sequence homologous to the third intracellular loop of a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) was cloned, suggesting the presence of GPCRs in dinoflagellates. The involvement of G protein activation in encystment {{is suggested by the}} observation that mastoparan induced transient encystment. Immunodetection of Gα-like proteins and cloning of Gα-like partial sequences implicate the presence of novel G proteins in dinoflagellates. Depletion of extracellular Ca 2 + significantly diminished the indoleamine-induced encystment. Ca 2 + ionophores and Ca 2 +-ATPase inhibitors can mimick the indoleamine-induced encystment. Inactive <b>indoleamines</b> can antagonise 5 MT-induced Ca 2 + influx. Together, these results suggest that Ca 2 + acts as a second messenger for encystment. <b>Indoleamines</b> were shown to stimulate a phospholipase C pathway in dinoflagellates, leading to the formation of inositol phosphates (IF). The indoleamine-stimulated IP formation was demonstrated to be associated with encystment by a profile of <b>indoleamines</b> tested. Moreover, CGP 52608 -induced encystment suggests that nuclear receptor is also involved in indoleamine-induced encystment. In conclusion, this thesis demonstrated the involvement of receptor and G protein signaling in indoleamine-induced encystment in dinoflagellates...|$|R
30|$|In the pineal gland, {{melatonin}} {{is produced}} from serotonin during the dark phase by {{the action of}} the enzymes NAT and HIOMT (Underwood, 1989 Gaudet et al. 1993). These enzymes are inhibited, on exposure to light, with the accumulation of serotonin (Armstrong, 1989). Melanocytes have all the components for active tryptophan metabolism, including tryptphan hydroxylase, tyraminoxidase, NAT and HIOMT. Marginal zone melanocytes are negative for <b>indoleamines</b> and enzymes in vitiligo, but can be activated on UV exposure when synchronized in G 2 phase (Iyengar, 1994, 1998 a, b) Since the photoresponsive melanocytes are positive for both serotonin and melatonin, a similar photo inhibitor activity is possible within them, if <b>indoleamines</b> are being metabolised by them.|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{applying}} the <b>indoleamines</b> serotonin (5 -hydroxytryptamine) and 5 -methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (MDT) ionophoretically onto cat retinal ganglion cells were {{studied in the}} optically intact eye of the cat. Serotonin suppressed both the spontaneous activity and light-evoked discharge of on-centre ganglion cells, regardless of the visual stimulus used; on the other hand, it enhanced the activity of off-centre ganglion cells. MDT produced the opposite effects, i. e. it enhanced the activity of on-centre ganglion cells but suppressed that of off-centre ganglion cells. Much {{of the effect of}} serotonin on light-evoked discharge can be attributed to an alteration of maintained discharge. There was no major difference in the way brisk-sustained (X) and brisk-transient (Y) cells responded to the application of serotonin and MDT, although the effects of the <b>indoleamines</b> on brisk-transient (Y) cells were generally weaker than on brisk-sustained (X) cells.

40|$|To {{examine a}} {{possible}} role of <b>indoleamines</b> {{in the regulation}} of epithelial sodium absorption, the effect of serotonin (5 -hydroxytryptamine) and several derivatives on electrolyte transport was measured in vitro in the baboon bronchus and in the trachea and colon of sodium-deficient rats. Serotonin, melatonin (N-acetyl- 5 -hydroxytryptamine), and harmaline (1 -methyl- 7 -methoxy- 3, 4 -dihydro-beta-carboline) inhibited sodium transport in all three preparations {{in a similar manner}} to the natriuretic agent amiloride. In all three epithelia, sodium absorption via the amiloride-sensitive pathway constitutes a substantial portion of total electrolyte transport, measured as the amiloride-sensitive short-circuit current. Thus 25 microM amiloride inhibited the short-circuit current 21 % in the rat trachea, 63 % in the baboon bronchus, and 90 % in the rat colon. Serotonin, melatonin, and harmaline inhibited the amiloride-sensitive portion of the short-circuit current from the luminal side of the epithelium. The inhibition was rapid, requiring only seconds, and maximal inhibition by serotonin was identical to that by amiloride. When sodium was omitted from the luminal solution, the short-circuit current was reduced a similar amount, suggesting that sodium absorption was being inhibited by both amiloride and the indoles. The IC 50 value for amiloride was 50 nM in the baboon bronchus and 500 nM in the rat colon. In contrast, the IC 50 value for serotonin was 0. 4 mM in the baboon bronchus and 8 mM in the rat colon. These results, together with the wide distribution of amine-precursor-uptake-and-decarboxylation (APUD) cells in the respiratory and intestinal tract, suggest that certain <b>indoleamines</b> could play a role as local regulators of fluid and electrolyte transport. For example, in the airways, <b>indoleamines</b> {{may be one of the}} factors involved in regulation of the depth of the periciliary fluid layer...|$|R
40|$|Neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques express {{acetylcholinesterase}} and butyrylcholinesterase {{activity in}} Alzheimer disease. We previously reported that traditional acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as BW 284 C 51, tacrine, and physostigmine were more potent inhibitors of the acetylcholinesterase in normal axons and cell bodies {{than of the}} acetylcholinesterase in plaques and tangles. We now report that the reverse pattern is seen with <b>indoleamines</b> (such as serotonin and its precursor 5 -hydroxytryptophan), carboxypeptidase inhibitor, and the nonspecific protease inhibitor bacitracin. These substances are more potent inhibitors of the cholinesterases in plaques and tangles than of those in normal axons and cell bodies. These {{results show that the}} enzymatic properties of plaque and tangle-associated cholinesterases diverge from those of normal axons and cell bodies. The selective susceptibility to bacitracin and carboxypeptidase inhibitor indicates that the catalytic sites of plaque and tangle-bound cholinesterases are more closely associated with peptidase or protease-like properties than the catalytic sites of cholinesterases in normal axons and cell bodies. This shift in enzymatic affinity may lead to the abnormal protein processing that is thought {{to play a major role}} in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease.
