5|$|Soon {{after his}} marriage, Woodruff decided {{to travel to}} England {{in order to take}} {{the second half of the}} FRCS Exam. Woodruff took his new wife over with no {{guarantee}} of employment, and declined a two-year travelling fellowship to Oxford University offered by the Australian Red Cross because it required him to return <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>work.</b> Before departing, he applied for a position as a Tutor of Surgery at the University of Sheffield, and learned en route that they had accepted his application. He took the FRCS exam in 1947 and passed—a result that, in Woodruff's view, was certainly not hindered by the fact that one of his examiners, Colonel Julian Taylor, had been with him at Changi.|$|E

25|$|General {{awareness}} of homosexuality remained low among the Korean public until recently, with increased awareness and debate {{coming to the}} issue, as well as gay-themed entertainment in mass media and recognizable figures and celebrities, such as Hong Seok-cheon, coming out in public. But gay and lesbian Koreans still face difficulties at <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>work,</b> and many prefer not to reveal their identities to their family, friends or co-workers.|$|E
25|$|Banas said he {{was aware}} of the {{national}} outrage against the Drews, which originated on the Internet in response to the Steve Pokin article in the O'Fallon Journal. The Drews have had their <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>work</b> addresses, phone and cell phone numbers, and aerial photos of their home posted on the Internet. The Drews' property had also been vandalized. Banas said some of these actions against the Drews could constitute Internet stalking.|$|E

Although he reportedly resented the low wages, {{he was given a}} car and lived rent-free in a cottage his father owned at 9 Head Street, Goldhanger, 3½ miles from his family's farmhouse at White House Farm. He also owned eight percent of his family's caravan site, Osea Road Camp Sites Ltd., in Maldon, Essex.|$|E
25|$|Ordinary {{income is}} a net income concept, {{meaning that it}} will be {{deduction}} for costs incurred to acquire income. There is therefore a deduction for expenses related to acquisition of income if these are higher than the basic allowance. There is also several other deductions from ordinary income; special allowance for disability, special tax allowance for pensioners, the tax limitation rule for the disabled, seamen’s allowance, fishermen’s allowance, special allowance for self-employed within agriculture, special allowance for high expenses linked to illness, allowance for payments to individual pension schemes, allowance for travel between <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>work,</b> allowance for donations to voluntary organisations, allowance for paid union fees, allowance for home investment savings scheme for people under 34 years, parental allowance for documented expenses for childminding and childcare, etc.|$|E
25|$|The {{producers}} {{wanted to}} have a gathering place outside of <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>work</b> where the characters could meet. After a trip to Seattle, and seeing the many burgeoning coffee shops, the production designer suggested to producers that they use a coffee shop. Unlike many of the relatively modern coffee shop designs prevalent in Seattle, the production designer opted for a more warm and inviting style which would appear more established and traditional. Stools were specifically omitted to avoid any similarity to the bar on Cheers. Several Los Angeles coffee shops were used for reference. A bookcase was added on the back wall, suggesting patrons could grab a book and read while they enjoyed their coffee. The show used three versions of the interior set depending on how much space other sets for each episode required. If there was not space for the full set, a smaller version that omitted the tables closest to the audience could be used. If there wasn't space for that set, a small back section {{of the back of the}} cafe at the top of the steps could be set up under the audience bleachers. A set was also used on occasion for the exterior patio.|$|E

On November 1, 1975, Kent {{defeated}} Mark Lewin to win the Detroit version of the NWA United States Heavyweight Championship. Lewin regained the title in December. On October 16, 1976, Kent regained the title in a bloody brawl against Pampero Firpo and held on to it until January 8, 1977, when he lost it to Gino Hernandez. Kent developed into a long running enemy of the Sheik, who {{was the most popular}} man in the promotion, with the two clashing many times in wild and bloody brawls.|$|E
500|$|When the Great Patriotic War {{broke out}} in 1941, the Efimovs refused to leave Moscow, though the winter of 1941–1942 was bitterly cold. Simonovich-Efimova worked in the Lefortovo District at the First Mobile Hospital tending to wounded {{soldiers}} and writing letters for them to their families and comrades. In a series of drawings called [...] "The Wounded", she drew portraits of the soldiers trying to capture their courage, noting their injuries and their addresses {{on the backs of}} the drawings. Some of the drawings she would work up in oil or watercolor, spending most of the daylight hours at the hospital. In the evenings, the couple worked on puppetry, preparing concerts and puppet shows for the troops based on historic and patriotic themes. They also allowed artists to take refuge at their <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>work</b> the small garden to supplement their food. They trained and rehearsed their actors daily, though finding male actors was difficult, compounded by gas and electrical shortages. Simonovich-Efimova also compiled a memoir of her cousin and teacher Valentin Serov, though her book, Memories of V. A. Serov (...) was not published until 1964.|$|E
500|$|Because of women's {{expanded}} {{roles in}} the workforce have generally not been accompanied by any relaxation of expectations for their family and domestic activities, many women today face the [...] "double burden" [...] of <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>work</b> responsibilities. Women take on the largest portion of the domestic obligations of the home, {{even when they are}} working full-time jobs. This breeds anger and frustration, as women know they do the majority of the housework on top of their careers. There have been said to be more reasons, other than gender roles, as to why there is a difference in the housework performed by men and women. Some theories have suggested that women's expectations for household cleanliness are higher than men's. Women feel like they must be responsible for the condition of the home in a way that men do not. Men do invest most of their time in their careers, but women spend double that time caring for the children, state of the home and taking care of the domestic responsibilities. In a graph from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2004, that compare the workload of married men and {{women between the ages of}} 25-54, women are displayed as performing one hundred percent more housework than men, and men are displayed as having more leisure time than women. As the double burden increased in 1980, women became more critical of their marriages than men and wanted the men to do more around the house to ease the burden of a second shift. The double burden of women who have jobs and still shoulder the majority of the housework at home leads to women filing or initiating divorce.|$|E

Ian Mactaggart, Field Organiser 1955-1960, further parish missions were encouraged. In addition Rev. Colin Day was appointed to lead a series of national [...] "Kirk Week" [...] events, large-scale conferences to encourage the laity to think through the implications of their faith for the worlds of <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Harris {{preferred}} to write at the Wren's Nest. He published prodigiously throughout the 1880s and 1890s, trying {{his hand at}} novels, children's literature, and a translation of French folklore. Yet he rarely strayed from <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>work</b> during this time. He chose {{to stay close to}} his family and his gardening. [...] Harris and his wife Essie had seven more children in Atlanta, with a total of six (out of nine) surviving past childhood.|$|E
2500|$|Glenn Danzig {{has served}} as the sole {{songwriter}} for every band he has fronted, and described his writing process: [...] "Sometimes I get the guitar lines, sometimes I write on the piano, sometimes I’ll write the lyrics first and then figure out the chord patterns on guitar, and sometimes I write the drum pattern first. It's all different". Danzig also records basic song ideas when away from his home: [...] "I usually hum it into a microcassette recorder and then I transpose it when I get <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>work</b> it out on guitar or piano".|$|E

2500|$|The {{messages}} of Church leaders regarding working women were {{reflected in the}} Relief Society's housework curriculum. Throughout the 1950s, Relief Society lessons were written by career women who balanced <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>work</b> life. Each lesson was listed with the author's name, allowing readers to match a name to the curriculum. However, by the 1970s, the Church discontinued the lessons written by specific individuals {{and the use of}} an author's byline. Relief Society lessons were then created to be messages from the Church as a whole, [...] "providing no individual model of a professional woman for others to know and follow".|$|E
2500|$|In early October 2007, Watson {{was about}} to embark on a UK book tour to promote the memoir. He was interviewed by Charlotte Hunt-Grubbe at CSHL.

2500|$|Part One is {{entitled}} [...] "Taking Charge of Your Thoughts." [...] It consists of 4 chapters. Thinking in Freedom (ch. 1) uses {{the mastery of}} a skilled surfer or ballet dancer as an analogy {{for the type of}} mastery that Easwaran believes all people would like in the art of living. Such mastery is attainable by training the mind, he says, but it requires great practice. Living Skills (ch. 2) describes Easwaran's method of meditating on a passage, its benefits for being present-focused, and for reacting to other people freely, rather than compulsively. Training the Mind (ch. 3) urges readers to think of the various parts of their week, such as <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>work,</b> as exercise stations that each provide a special opportunity to train the mind, and reduce egoism.|$|E
