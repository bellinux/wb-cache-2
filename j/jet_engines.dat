40|$|Abstractâ€”A {{scattered}} {{radar signal}} by a <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> inlet involves engine information of the target. The <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> RCS {{due to the}} engine inlet is therefore significant in radar target recognition. Accordingly, several accurate analyses of the <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> RCS have been reported. Reduction of the <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> RCS is also required for stealth technology. We suggest a new approach for <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> RCS reduction that involves the insertion of many small corrugations into the <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> inlet. The proposed <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> structure {{is assumed to be}} a circular waveguide cavity with many corrugations. The structure is analyzed by combining a mode matching technique with a scattering matrix analysis. The proposed closed-form RCS solutions of the corrugated engine structure are validated with a MoM simulation using FEKO. The proposed closed-form solution has numerical efficiency and rapid convergence. Using the characteristics of the solution, we simply apply a genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize the structure of the corrugations in terms of minimizing the RCS. 1...|$|R

50|$|Initially the General Electric plant {{specialized}} in arc lights, electric motors, and meters.

5|$|By the Korean War, <b>jet</b> <b>engines</b> had {{replaced}} propellers on aircraft, which severely limited {{the ability of}} the 20 mm and 40 mm AA batteries and their gun systems to track and shoot down enemy planes. Consequently, the AA guns and their associated fire-control systems were removed when reactivated. New Jersey received this treatment in 1967, and the others followed in their 1980s modernizations. In the 1980s, each ship also received a quartet of Phalanx Close in Weapon System (CIWS) mounts which made use of a radar system to locate incoming enemy projectiles and destroy them with a 20mm Gatling gun before they could strike the ship.|$|E
5|$|Design of the FR-1 {{began in}} 1943 to a {{proposal}} instigated by Admiral John S. McCain, Sr. for a mixed-powered fighter because early <b>jet</b> <b>engines</b> had sluggish acceleration {{that was considered}} unsafe and unsuitable for carrier operations. Ryan received a contract for three XFR-1 prototypes and one static test airframe on 11 February 1943 with the first two prototypes delivered in 14 months. Another contract was placed for 100 aircraft on 2 December 1943 and a later contract on 31 January 1945 increased the total of FR-1s on order to 700.|$|E

5|$|Placing {{the engines}} within the wings had the {{advantage}} of a reduction in the risk of foreign object damage, which could seriously damage <b>jet</b> <b>engines.</b> The low-mounted engines and good placement of service panels also made aircraft maintenance easier to perform. However, the Comet's buried engine configuration increased its structural weight and complexity. Armour had to be placed around the engine cells to contain debris from any serious engine failures; also, placing the engines inside the wing required a more complicated wing structure.|$|E
5|$|Pretending {{their client}} was the {{government}} of Pakistan, the Zoio brothers contacted a licensed arms dealer from England, Major WRL Turp MBE of Bexley, Kent, who quickly agreed in principle, requesting a letter of credit from a Geneva bank and appropriate end-user certificates for the weapons. Meanwhile, Reedman's military attachÃ©, Wing Commander John Mussell, travelled to Belgium to buy starter cartridges for the Rolls-Royce Avon 109 <b>jet</b> <b>engines</b> used by the Royal Rhodesian Air Force's English Electric Canberra bombers, as well as engines for Rhodesia's Hawker Hunter jet fighters, which were produced in Belgium under licence from Britain.|$|E
5|$|Stalin {{convened a}} meeting on 29 November 1946 to settle the future policy on jet fighters for the VVS and PVO. The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-9 was {{selected}} as the primary fighter with the Yakovlev Yak-15 relegated to conversion training and familiarization. The imminent availability of British <b>jet</b> <b>engines</b> and access to German jet technology and engineers meant that there was no longer any need for mixed-power aircraft, but Stalin insisted that the I-250 finish its trials and that the tooling and drawings should be retained along with unassembled parts even though the program was cancelled.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} features of the Skylon design is the engine, called SABRE. The engines are designed to operate much like a conventional <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> to around Mach 5.5 (1,700 m/s), 26 km altitude, beyond which the air inlet closes and the engine operates as a highly efficient rocket to orbital speed. The proposed SABRE engine is not a scramjet, but a <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> running combined cycles of a precooled <b>jet</b> <b>engine,</b> rocket engine and ramjet. Originally the key technology for this type of precooled <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> did not exist, as it required a heat exchanger that was ten times lighter than the state of the art. Research conducted since then has achieved the necessary performance.|$|R

5|$|The BAE Systems Nimrod MRA4 was {{a planned}} {{maritime}} patrol and attack aircraft intended {{to replace the}} Hawker Siddeley Nimrod MR2.

The conversion of the flight deck to a digital glass cockpit would have simplified control operations and reduced crew requirements. New detection systems were to be installed, as well as additional weapons for anti-submarine warfare.|$|E
5|$|The Tupolev Tu-73 jet-engined bomber {{project was}} {{suffering}} delays in early 1947 and Tupolev suggested re-engining the Tu-2 medium bomber with imported British Rolls-Royce Nene <b>jet</b> <b>engines</b> {{to produce a}} jet bomber as quickly as possible. Design work began well before official approval was received on 31 May 1947 for one Tu-2S to be converted in the OKB's workshop and another five to be converted at Zavod (Factory) Nr. 23, but construction of the prototype had already begun in early May under the bureau designation Tu-77.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of the first practical <b>jet</b> <b>engines</b> in the late-World War II period led to calls for new jet-powered versions of practically every aircraft then flying. Among these was {{the design of a}} replacement for the de Havilland Mosquito, at that time among the world's leading light bombers. The Mosquito had been designed with the express intent of lightening the aircraft in order to improve its speed as much as possible, a process that led to the removal of all defensive armament, improving performance {{to the point where it}} was unnecessary anyway. This high-speed approach was extremely successful, and a jet-powered version would be even more difficult to intercept.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a fault {{detection}} and isolation (FDI) scheme for an aircraft <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> is developed. The proposed FDI system {{is based on}} the multiple model approach and utilizes dynamic neural networks (DNNs) to accomplish this goal. Towards this end, multiple DNNs are constructed to learn the nonlinear dynamics of the aircraft <b>jet</b> <b>engine.</b> Each DNN corresponds to a specific operating mode of the healthy engine or the faulty condition of the <b>jet</b> <b>engine.</b> Using residuals obtained by comparing each network output with the measured <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> output and by invoking a properly selected threshold for each network, reliable criteria are established for detecting and isolating faults in the <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> components. The fault diagnosis task consists of determining the time as well as the location of a fault occurrence subject to presence of unmodeled dynamics, disturbances, and measurement noise. Simulation results presented demonstrate and illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed dynamic neural network-based FDI strategy.
