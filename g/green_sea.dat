5|$|The {{gull-billed tern}} is an opportunist predator, taking {{a wide variety}} of prey from marine, {{freshwater}} and terrestrial habitats. Depending on what is available it will eat small crabs, fish, crayfish, grasshoppers and other large insects, lizards and amphibians. Warm-blooded prey includes mice and the eggs and chicks of other beach-breeding birds; least terns, little terns and members of its own species may be victims. The greater crested tern will also occasionally catch unusual vertebrate species such as agamid lizards and <b>green</b> <b>sea</b> turtle hatchlings, and follows trawlers for discards.|$|E

The species of the latter was uncertain, but it was thought to be a gecko, possibly either an oceanic gecko (Gehyra oceanica) or a mourning gecko (Lepidodactylus lugubris). The 1991–92 Pitcairn Islands Scientific Expedition found specimens of both the mourning gecko and the white-bellied skink. The only mammal known to inhabit Ducie is the Polynesian rat; In 1997 there was a successful project to eradicate these by Brian Bell (WMIL) and Graham Wragg (S/V Te Manu), to aid the conservation of bird species threatened by the rat population. <b>Green</b> <b>sea</b> turtles feed on Ducie, but have not been seen to breed there.|$|E
40|$|This paper aims {{to present}} {{and explain the}} work {{undertaken}} at the SSRC on the Safety of Bulk Carriers in extreme weather conditions over the past 3 years, to draw conclusions deriving there from, concerning key influencing design, operational and environmental parameters and to offer recommendations regarding the rule development process {{and on the way}} forward considering research, development and implementation to ship design and operation with the view to improving the safety of these ships cost-effectively. In severe storms, hatch covers of low freeboard vessels such as bulk carriers are the first-line of protection against flooding. Present methods of hatch covers design are still empirical because impact loads due to <b>green</b> <b>seas</b> and structural behaviour due to this type of loads have not been examined, hence not known accurately. The loading due to <b>green</b> <b>seas</b> is implicitly non-linear and, as model test results demonstrated, bulk carriers in extreme conditions are exposed to significant loads, which in some cases exceed current design standards. Since the consequences of hatch cover failure are potentially catastrophic, the risk of this happening should be quantified in probabilistic terms as required by modern safety standards. To this end, the paper aims to propose and implement a methodology for estimating probabilities of deck wetness and impact loads due to <b>green</b> <b>seas</b> as a function of key design and operational parameters...|$|R

5|$|The {{tiger shark}} is an apex {{predator}} {{and has a}} reputation for eating anything. These predators swim close inland to eat at night, and during the day swim out into deeper waters. Young tiger sharks are found to feed largely on small fish, as well as various small jellyfish, cephalopods, and other mollusks. Around the time they attain , or near sexual maturity, their selection expands considerably, and much larger animals become regular prey. Numerous fish, crustaceans, sea birds, sea snakes, marine mammals (e.g. bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops), common dolphins (Delphinus), spotted dolphins (Stenella), dugongs (Dugong dugon), seals and sea lions, and sea turtles (including the three largest species: the leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea), the loggerhead (Caretta caretta) and the <b>green</b> <b>sea</b> turtles (Chelonia mydas),) are regularly eaten by adult tiger sharks. In fact, adult sea turtles have been found in up to 20.8% of studied tiger shark stomachs, indicating somewhat of a dietary preference for sea turtles where they are commonly encountered. They also eat other sharks (including adult sandbar sharks (Carcharhinus plumbeus)), as well as rays, and sometimes even other tiger sharks.|$|E
25|$|The {{range of}} the <b>green</b> <b>sea</b> turtle extends {{throughout}} tropical and subtropical oceans worldwide. The two major subpopulations are the Atlantic and the eastern Pacific subpopulations. Each population is genetically distinct, with {{its own set of}} nesting and feeding grounds within the population's known range. Their native range includes tropical to subtropical waters along continental coasts and islands between 30°N and 30°S. Since <b>green</b> <b>sea</b> turtles are a migrating species, their global distribution spans into the open ocean. The <b>green</b> <b>sea</b> turtle is estimated to inhabit coastal areas of more than 140 countries, with nesting sites in over 80 countries worldwide throughout the year. In the United States Atlantic coast, <b>green</b> <b>sea</b> turtles can be found from Texas and north to Massachusetts. In the United States Pacific coast, they have been found from southern California north to the southernmost tip of Alaska. The largest populations of <b>green</b> <b>sea</b> turtles within the United States coastline are in the Hawaiian Islands and Florida. Globally, the largest populations of sea turtles are in the Great Barrier Reef in Australia and the Caribbean islands.|$|E
25|$|<b>Green</b> <b>sea</b> turtles {{move across}} three habitat types, {{depending}} on their life stage. They lay eggs on beaches. Mature turtles {{spend most of their}} time in shallow, coastal waters with lush seagrass beds. Adults frequent inshore bays, lagoons and shoals with lush seagrass meadows. Entire generations often migrate between one pair of feeding and nesting areas. <b>Green</b> <b>sea</b> turtles, Chelonia mydas, are classified as an aquatic species and are distributed around the globe in warm tropical to subtropical waters. The environmental parameter that limits the distribution of the turtles is ocean temperatures below 7 to 10 degrees Celsius. Within their geographical range, the <b>green</b> <b>sea</b> turtles generally stay near continental and island coastlines. Near the coastlines, the <b>green</b> <b>sea</b> turtles live within shallow bays and protected shores. In these protected shores and bays, the <b>green</b> <b>sea</b> turtle habitats include coral reefs, salt marshes, and nearshore seagrass beds. The coral reefs provide red, brown, and green algae for their diet and gives protection from predators and rough storms within the ocean. The salt marshes and seagrass beds contain seaweed and grass vegetation, allowing ample habitat for the sea turtles.|$|E

25|$|Like other sea turtles, <b>green</b> <b>sea</b> turtles migrate long {{distances}} between feeding grounds and hatching beaches. Many islands worldwide {{are known as}} Turtle Island due to <b>green</b> <b>sea</b> turtles nesting on their beaches. Females crawl out on beaches, dig nests and lay eggs during the night.

25|$|<b>Green</b> <b>sea</b> turtles play an {{essential}} role within the ecosystem in which they live. In the seagrass beds, the turtles feed on the seagrass by trimming only the top and leaving {{the roots of the}} plant. Through their feeding technique, the turtles help to improve the health and growth of the seagrass beds. The healthy seagrass beds that the turtles provide give habitat and feeding grounds for many species of fish and crustaceans. On the nesting beaches, the <b>green</b> <b>sea</b> turtles provide key nutrients for the ecosystem through their hatched egg shells. In their coral reef habitat, the <b>green</b> <b>sea</b> turtles have a symbiotic interaction with reef fish, including the yellow tang. The yellow tang fish swims along with the turtle and feeds on the algae, barnacles, and parasites on its shell and flippers. This species interaction provides food for the yellow tang and provides a necessary cleaning and smoothing of the turtle’s shell. This cleaning helps the turtle swim by reducing the amount of drag and improves their health.|$|E

25|$|Numbers {{of mature}} adult Galápagos green turtle are {{much lower than}} those of other <b>green</b> <b>sea</b> turtle populations; this may be why they are more genetically {{isolated}} than other populations. The carapace is dark in color, usually black to dark olive-brown, is oval in shape, and tapers toward the tail. The carapace has a distinctive formation that is more sloped or domed than individuals of other populations. The five vertebral scutes are all alike in size with a hexagonal shape and flat edges. The lateral scutes are similar in size, but only four occur along each side. The carapace is tougher than the plastron, or the underside of the shell, and is also darker in pigmentation. They have been recorded up to 84cm in length, while other <b>green</b> <b>sea</b> turtles have been recorded up to 99cm in length. Their legs are shaped like flippers to aide in swimming; they are broad and generally flattened. The head is rounded and lizard-like with no teeth and does not have the predominantly hooked beak like many other <b>green</b> <b>sea</b> turtles. The sexes are similar in most aspects except size; the females are slightly larger, and the males have a longer tail.|$|E
