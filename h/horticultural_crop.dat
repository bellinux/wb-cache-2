40|$|Indonesia, {{like many}} {{developing}} countries in Southeast Asia, is experiencing an agri-food transformation with rapidly growing demand for high value agricultural products, including horticultural products such as fruits and vegetables. Therefore, there may be opportunities for policy makers to support smallholder farmers to expand their adoption of horticultural crops for their own benefit and {{for the benefit of}} Indonesia as a whole. At the same time, however, the Indonesian government needs to maintain intensive support for smallholder farmers to produce adequate supplies of vital staple food crops, such as rice, maize and soybeans, in order to achieve national food self-sufficiency. This study investigated the opportunities and challenges of expanding <b>horticultural</b> <b>crop</b> production in Indonesia, particularly to improve the participation of Indonesian smallholder farmers in horticultural value chains. The main objectives of this study were two-fold: (1) to examine Indonesian farmer preferences for crop attributes which influence <b>horticultural</b> <b>crop</b> adoption decisions, and (2) to examine how and in what ways small farm household diversification into horticultural production significantly affects farm household livelihoods, namely food supply and income. Four phases of analysis were conducted using unique data from a 2013 survey of 960 Indonesian farmers on Java Island, which has the largest production zone for both horticultural crops and staple food crops in Indonesia. The first analysis examined the current status of <b>horticultural</b> <b>crop</b> adoption in Indonesia and highlighted the characteristics of farmers who adopted {{and those who did not}} adopt a new <b>horticultural</b> <b>crop</b> with respect to the farm household, farm and institutional characteristics. Results showed that <b>horticultural</b> <b>crop</b> adopters were motivated mainly by higher profit, higher yield and greater income opportunities. This study also found that current low rates of <b>horticultural</b> <b>crop</b> adoption are associated with a variety of factors, such as lower levels of education among farmers, resource constraints, lack of information on <b>horticultural</b> <b>crop</b> production and low participation in farmer groups. The second analysis focused on Indonesian farmer preferences for specific crop attributes when considering adopting a new crop. This study addresses farmer heterogeneity in preferences for crop attributes at the aggregate as well as group (segment) level. Best-worst scaling analysis showed that the three most important crop attributes for Indonesian farmers at the aggregate level are related to the perceived relative advantage and risks of the new crop, and access to inputs required to grow the crop, such as high quality seeds. Latent class (LC) cluster analysis identified four distinct clusters of farmer segments each with unique socio-demographic characteristics and preferences for crop attributes. The third analysis examined determinant factors in <b>horticultural</b> <b>crop</b> adoption, particularly the effects of farmer preferences for specific crop attributes on the decision to adopt horticultural crops. After controlling for other factors, multinomial endogenous treatment regressions showed that preference cluster effect varied across models. Product-preference cluster had no significant effect on adoption when measured as a binary variable, that is, to adopt or not adopt. The product-preference cluster had a significant effect on the intensity of adoption and timing of adoption. The effects of farmer crop preference clusters, however, differed across the models. The fourth analysis explored the impact of farmer adoption of horticultural crops on farm household food supply and income. This novel analysis addressed the trade-offs between <b>horticultural</b> <b>crop</b> diversification and staple food crops. Simultaneous equation regressions showed evidence that <b>horticultural</b> <b>crop</b> diversification decreases the value of non-horticultural crop production and wage income, particularly in lowland areas of Indonesia, but the net effect was positive. While the net effect on total value of food production was higher in highland areas, this study found the income effect to be small. Thesis (Ph. D.)

A field study was carried out to assess the effects of poor application of soil information and the present level of soil information and utilization among small scale <b>horticultural</b> <b>crop</b> farmers in Ibadan, Oyo state. Six candidate citrus trees each were selected from two citrus orchards planted on suitable and marginally suitable soils based on available soil survey information which was monitored over two seasons, while structured questionnaires were administered to get empirical data on land use by the farmers. There was over 35 % yield difference and this was significantly different (P < 0. 05) with loss of some trees after 15 years of establishment of the orchard on marginally suitable soils. Mean yield per tree was 50. 43 kg and 30. 12 kg for suitable and marginally suitable plots respectively. None of the respondents sought professional advice on land use or have knowledge of previous land use type while the farms were not surveyed before use. 56. 27 % of the farmers do not carry out soil test while less than 10 % of the farmers apply fertilizers suggesting nutrient mining with an average land use period of 14 years.
