2500|$|Electro{{communication}} is {{the communication}} method used by weakly <b>electric</b> <b>fishes.</b> Weakly <b>electric</b> <b>fishes</b> are {{a group of}} animals that utilize a communicating channel that is [...] "invisible" [...] to most other animals: <b>electric</b> signaling. <b>Electric</b> <b>fishes</b> communicate electrically by one <b>fish</b> generating an <b>electric</b> field and a second individual receiving that electric field with its electroreceptors.

While weakly <b>electric</b> <b>fish</b> are the only group that have been identified to carry out both generation and reception of electric fields, other species either generate signals or receive them, but not both. Animals that either generate or receive electric fields are found only in aquatic (or at least moist) environments due to large resistance of all other media (e.g. air).

40|$|Abstract Burbot, Lota lota (L.), {{populations are}} declining {{throughout}} much of their native distribution. Although numerous aspects of burbot ecology are well understood, less is known about effective sampling techniques for burbot in lotic systems. Occupancy models were used to estimate the probability of detection (p̂) for three gears (6. 4 - and 19 -mm bar mesh hoop nets, night <b>electric</b> <b>fishing),</b> {{within the context of}} various habitat characteristics. During the summer, night <b>electric</b> <b>fishing</b> had the highest estimated detection probability for both juvenile (p̂, 95 % C. I.; 0. 35, 0. 26 – 0. 46) and adult (0. 30, 0. 20 – 0. 41) burbot. However, small-mesh hoop nets (6. 4 -mm bar mesh) had similar detection probabilities to night <b>electric</b> <b>fishing</b> for both juvenile (0. 26, 0. 17 – 0. 36) and adult (0. 27, 0. 18 – 0. 39) burbot during the summer. In autumn, a similar overlap between detection probabilities was observed for juvenile and adult burbot. Small-mesh hoop nets had the highest estimated probability of detection for both juvenile and adult burbot (0. 46, 0. 33 – 0. 59), whereas night <b>electric</b> <b>fishing</b> had a detection probability of 0. 39 (0. 28 – 0. 52) for juvenile and adult burbot. By using detection probabilities to compare gears, the most effective sampling technique can be identified, leading to increased species detections and more effective management of burbot.

40|$|Life history trait {{analyses}} of non-native fishes help identify how novel populations respond to different habitat typologies. Here, using <b>electric</b> <b>fishing</b> and anglers as citizen scientists, scales {{were collected from}} the invasive barbel Barbus barbus population from four reaches of the River Severn and Teme, western England. Angler samples were biased towards larger fish, with the smallest fish captured being 410 [*]mm, whereas <b>electric</b> <b>fishing</b> sampled fish down to 60 [*]mm. Scale ageing revealed fish present to over 20 years old in both rivers. Juvenile growth rates were similar across all reaches. Lengths at the last annulus and Linfinity of the von Bertalanffy growth model revealed, however, that fish grew to significantly larger body sizes in a relatively deep and highly impounded reach of the River Severn.

40|$|Removal {{sampling}} by <b>electric</b> <b>fishing</b> {{is widely}} used for assessing fish population size. As it is manpower consuming, less-demanding techniques have been proposed {{to increase the number}} of sites covered with the same human resources. These techniques essentially provide relative abundance measures. To be used for absolute abundance estimation, they need to be inter-calibrated with another method such as removal sampling. Here, hierarchical Bayesian modelling framework is used for this inter-calibration because it allows an estimate of absolute abundance from abundance index data alone while accounting for the main sources of uncertainty. It is applied to a 0 + juvenile Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L. data set from 21 sites on the River Faughan, Northern Ireland. A positive relationship was found between the abundance index (number of fish caught in 5 min of actual <b>electric</b> <b>fishing)</b> and the density.

40|$|The {{abundance}} of banded kokopu (Galaxias fasciatus Gray) in small streams has usually been {{determined by the}} labour intensive and invasive method of <b>electric</b> <b>fishing.</b> Recently, nocturnal counts under spotlight illumination {{have been used to}} determine presence or absence and relative {{abundance of}} banded kokopu, but the proportion of the population seen was unknown. We compared 20 spotlight counts of banded kokopu in approximately 20 m reaches in streams in the North Island, New Zealand, to population estimates determined by removal <b>electric</b> <b>fishing</b> in the same reaches. Spotlight counts were related to population estimates over a range of densities, and on average, spotlight counts were 64 % of the population estimates. Though we tried to separate age- 0 fish from older fish visually in the spotlight counts, the size frequency distribution of the fish caught by <b>electric</b> <b>fishing</b> showed that the visual separation was not reliable. In addition, visual counts were generally inefficient for age- 0 fish (40 - 70 mm total length), as only about 40 % were observed. Banded kokopu were also recorded in streams using time-lapse video recordings with a camera sensitive to low light levels. Diel activity showed two major peaks, one in the early morning from 0400 h to 0900 h, and the other in the afternoon and evening from 1300 h to 1900 h. Fish were less disturbed by the observer. s approach after dark than during the day, so we suggest that from dusk to about 2200 h is the best time for visual counts of banded kokopu by spotlight in summer months...|$|E

25|$|As <b>electric</b> <b>fish</b> mature, some taxa develop {{differences}} in EOD {{between males and}} females (i.e. sexual dimorphism). Typically, male <b>electric</b> <b>fish</b> have lower EOD frequency and longer EOD duration than females; among males, the dominant and largest fish generally possesses the lowest frequency. For example, measurements made in Sternopygus marucus (Hagedorn, 1986) showed that males usually generate EOD at about 80Hz, while females generate EOD at around 150Hz. Such {{differences in}} EOD between the sexes {{can be traced back to}} changes in the action potential in electrocytes. As <b>electric</b> <b>fish</b> mature from the juvenile stage, male fish grow larger with longer and thicker tails, which might result in larger electric organs that generate lower frequency EODs. One of the physiological factors that have been proven to contribute to the sexual dimorphism of EODs is the level of teleost hormone- androgen 11-keto-testosterone (11-KT) and estrogen. Experiments shown that by injecting 11-KT into female <b>electric</b> <b>fishes,</b> not only did their EOD waveforms and frequencies become closer to that of the males, but their tuberous electroreceptors were also modified to be able to detect signals according to the newly transformed EOD properties.

40|$|In {{managing}} non-native species, {{surveillance programmes}} aim to minimise {{the opportunity for}} invasions to develop from initial introductions through early detection. However, this is dependent on surveillance methods being able to detect species at low levels of abundance to avoid false-negative recordings through imperfect detection. We investigated through field experimentation the ability to detect Pseudorasbora parva, a highly invasive pest fish in Europe, {{in relation to their}} known density and sampling method. Secure pond mesocosms of area 100 m 2 contained P. parva densities from 0. 02 to 5. 0 m" 122; each density was in triplicate. These were searched using point sampling <b>electric</b> <b>fishing</b> and deployment of fish traps (non-baited and baited). No fish were captured at densities 0. 5 m" 122, whereas for <b>electric</b> <b>fishing</b> it only exceeded 0. 95 at 5. 0 m" 122 using high searching effort. These data reveal that small pest fishes such as P. parva may be prone to imperfect detection when at low densities and this is consistent with a number of other invasive species. This indicates the importance of designing surveillance programmes using methods of known statistical power to optimise conservation resource expenditure and enhance management outcomes...|$|E
