40|$|Background: In Sub-Saharan Africa, {{policy changes}} {{have begun to}} pave the way for {{community}} distribution of <b>injectable</b> <b>contraceptives</b> but sustaining such efforts remains challenging. Combining social marketing with community-based distribution provides an opportunity to recover some program costs and compensate workers with proceeds from contraceptive sales. This paper proposes a model for increasing access to <b>injectable</b> <b>contraceptives</b> in rural settings by using community-based distributers as social marketing agents and incorporating financing systems to improve sustainability. Methods: This intervention was implemented in three districts of the Central Zone of Tigray, Ethiopia and program data has been collected from November 2011 through October 2012. A total of 137 Community Based Reproductive Health Agents (CBRHAs) were trained to provide <b>injectable</b> <b>contraceptives</b> and were provided with a loan of 25 <b>injectable</b> <b>contraceptives</b> from a drug revolving fund, created with project funds. The price of a single dose credited to a CBRHA was 3 birr ($ 0. 17) and they provide injections to women for 5 birr ($ 0. 29), determined with willingness-to-pay data. Social marketing was used to create awareness and generate demand. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used to examine important feasibility aspects of the intervention. Results: Forty-four percent of CBRHAs were providing family planning methods at the time of the training and 96 % believed providing <b>injectable</b> <b>contraceptives</b> would improve their services.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{factors associated}} with a woman’s willingness to pay (WTP) for <b>injectable</b> <b>contraceptives</b> in Tigray, Ethiopia. Methods: We used a multistage random sampling design to generate {{a representative sample of}} reproductive age women from the Central Zone of Tigray, Ethiopia to participate in a survey (N = 1490). Respondents who had ever used <b>injectable</b> <b>contraceptives</b> or who were interested in using them were asked whether {{they would be willing to}} pay, and if so, how much. Logistic regression odds ratios (ORs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) and p-values were used to assess which factors were associated with WTP in our final model. Findings: On average, respondents were willing to pay 11 birr ($ 0. 65 USD) per injection. Being married, completing any amount of education, having given birth, and having visited a health facility in the last 12 months (whether received family planning information or not) were associated with statistically significantly increased odds of WTP. Having initiated sexual activity and having 1 – 2 children (compared to 0 children) were associated with statistically significantly decreased odds of WTP. We also detected two significant interactions. Among women who prefer <b>injectable</b> <b>contraceptives,</b> their odds of WTP for <b>injectable</b> <b>contraceptives</b> vary across length of time they have used them.

40|$|Background: Oral {{contraceptives}} {{are known}} to influence the risk of cancers of the female reproductive system. Evidence regarding the relationship between <b>injectable</b> <b>contraceptives</b> and these cancers is limited, especially in black South Africans, among whom <b>injectable</b> <b>contraceptives</b> are used more commonly than oral contraceptives. Methods and Findings: We analysed data from a South African hospital-based case–control study of black females aged 18 – 79 y, comparing self-reported contraceptive use in patients with breast (n = 1, 664), cervical (n = 2, 182), ovarian (n = 182), and endometrial (n = 182) cancer, with self-reported contraceptive use in 1, 492 control patients diagnosed with cancers with no known relationship to hormonal contraceptive use. We adjusted for potential confounding factors, including age, calendar year of diagnosis, education, smoking, alcohol, parity/age at first birth, and number of sexual partners. Among controls, 26 % had used injectable and 20 % had used oral contraceptives. For current and more recent users versus never users of oral or <b>injectable</b> <b>contraceptives,</b> the odds ratios (ORs) for breast cancer were significantly increased in users of oral and/or <b>injectable</b> <b>contraceptives</b> (OR 1. 66, 95 % CI 1. 28 – 2. 16, p, 0. 001) and separately among those exclusively using oral (1. 57, 1. 03 – 2. 40, p = 0. 04) and exclusively using injectable (OR 1. 83, 1. 31 – 2. 55, p, 0. 001) contraceptives; corresponding OR...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE To {{analyze the}} {{prevalence}} of current use of oral and <b>injectable</b> <b>contraceptives</b> by Brazilian women, according to demographic and socioeconomic variables and issues related to access to those medicines. METHODS A cross-sectional, population-based analytical study with probability sampling {{based on data from}} the Pesquisa Nacional sobre Acesso, Utilização e Promoção do Uso Racional de Medicamentos (PNAUM – National Survey on Access, Use and Promotion of Rational Use of Medicines), carried out between September 2013 and February 2014 in 20, 404 Brazilian urban households. Prevalence was calculated based on reports from non-pregnant women aged 15 - 49 on the use of oral or <b>injectable</b> <b>contraceptives.</b> The independent variables were gender, age, level of education, socioeconomic class, Brazilian region and marital status. Also analyzed were access, means of payment, sources, and reported medicines. Statistical analyses considered 95 % confidence intervals (95 %CI) and Pearson Chi-square test to evaluate the statistical significance of differences between groups, considering a 5 % significance level. RESULTS Prevalence of use was 28. 2 % for oral contraceptives (OC) and 4. 5 % for <b>injectable</b> <b>contraceptives</b> (IC). The highest prevalence of oral contraceptives was in the South region (37. 5 %) and the lowest in the North region (15. 7 %). For <b>injectable</b> <b>contraceptives</b> {{there was no difference between}} regions. Access was higher for oral contraceptive users (90. 7 %) than <b>injectable</b> <b>contraceptives</b> users (81. 2 %), as was direct payment (OC 78. 1 %, IC 58. 0 %). Users who paid for contraceptives acquired them at retail pharmacies (OC 95. 0 % and IC 86. 6 %) and at Farmácia Popular (Popular Pharmacy Program) (OC 4. 8 % and IC 12. 7 %). Free of charge contraceptives were mostly obtained from the Brazilian Unified Health System – SUS (OC 86. 7 %; IC 96. 0 %). Free samples were reported by 10. 4 % of users who did not pay for oral contraceptives. Most of paying users did not try to obtain contraceptives from SUS. Monophasic combined oral contraceptives were the most frequently reported (71. 6 %) and low-level levonorgestrel + ethinylestradiol combination accounted for 38. 7 % of them. The most frequently reported medicines are included in the Relação Nacional de Medicamentos Essenciais (RENAME – National List of Essential Medicines. CONCLUSIONS Most women aged 15 to 49 who reported using contraceptives had access to the medicine and use monophasic combined oral contraceptives of appropriate efficiency and safety purchased by direct payment, mainly from retail pharmacies...|$|R
50|$|In most African countries, {{only a few}} {{types of}} birth control are offered, which makes finding a method that fits a couple's {{reproductive}} needs difficult. Many African countries had low access scores on almost every method. In the 1999 ratings for 88 countries, 73% of countries offered condoms to at least half their population, 65% of countries offered the pill, 54% offered IUDs, 42% offered female sterilization, and 26% offered male sterilization. Low levels of condom use are cause for concern, particularly {{in the context of}} generalized epidemics in Sub-Saharan Africa. The use rate for <b>injectable</b> <b>contraceptives</b> increased from 2% to 8%, and from 8% to 26% in Sub-Saharan Africa, while the rate for condoms was 5%-7%. The least used method of contraception is male sterilization, with a rate of less than 3%. 6%-20% of women in Sub-Saharan Africa used <b>injectable</b> <b>contraceptives</b> covertly, a practice more common in areas where contraceptive prevalence was low, particularly rural areas.|$|R

40|$|Background: Black South African {{women are}} known to have a high usage rate of <b>injectable</b> <b>contraceptives.</b> Breast cancer is the second leading cancer after {{malignant}} cervical neoplasms in black South African women. There is evidence that sex hormones are associated with an increased risk of developing breast cancer. In the Western Cape, investigators suggested that <b>injectable</b> <b>contraceptives,</b> more specifically DMPA, may increase breast cancer risk. In another study conducted in the same province, a weak association between breast cancer and women taking combined oestrogen/progesterone oral contraceptives was found, though no risk associated with <b>injectable</b> progestogen <b>contraceptives</b> (DMPA) was confirmed. Study Objective: This study aimed to determine whether there is an association between hormonal contraceptive use and an increased risk of cancer of the breast. Methods: Data was obtained from an ongoing case control study set up by MRC/Wits/NHLS Cancer Epidemiology Research Group (CERG) in 1995 to investigate risk factors associated with cancer among the black population in Johannesburg. Data was processed using STATA, version 8 and analysed using univariate, bivariate and multivariate unmatched logistic regression models.

40|$|Background and AimsThe continual use of {{hormonal}} contraceptives {{among women}} within reproductive age {{has been on}} the increase. The effects of these contraceptives on lipid metabolism vary {{depending on the type of}} hormonal contraceptive. This study was carried out among Nigerian women, to compare theeffects of <b>injectable</b> hormonal <b>contraceptives</b> to that of combined oral contraceptives on lipid profile (triglyceride, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol and low density lipo-protein-cholesterol). MethodsThe lipid profile of a total of 83 women (50 of whom were non-users of contraceptives while the remaining 33 used different hormonal contraceptives; 26 of them used the injectable hormonalcontraceptives while 7 used oral contraceptives) were estimated using enzymatic methods except low density lipoprotein- cholesterol (LDL-C) which was by calculation. ResultsThere was a significant change (p 0. 05) in total cholesterol (TC) and high density lipoprotein- cholesterol (HDL-C) levels in women on oral <b>contraceptives,</b> while in <b>injectable</b> hormonal <b>contraceptive</b> users, there was significant change (p < 0. 05) in HDL-C and LDL-C, and no significant change in TG and TC levels. The Castelli risk index I and II (TC/HDL-C and LDL-C/HDL-C) were more reduced in women using <b>injectable</b> <b>contraceptives</b> (1. 65 and 0. 45, respectively) than in oral contraceptive users (1. 80 and 0. 56,respectively).
