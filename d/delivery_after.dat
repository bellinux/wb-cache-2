After a local preacher called him a [...] "Sodomite", Whitman was allegedly tarred and feathered. Biographer Justin Kaplan notes that the story is likely untrue, because Whitman regularly vacationed in the town thereafter. Biographer Jerome Loving calls the incident a [...] "myth". During this time, Whitman published a series of ten editorials, called [...] "Sun-Down Papers—From the Desk of a Schoolmaster", in three newspapers between the winter of 1840 and July 1841.

40|$|AIM: To compare {{oxidative}} stress {{in patients with}} preeclampsia (PE) or intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) vs. normal pregnancy (controls) during 48 h <b>after</b> <b>delivery.</b> STUDY DESIGN: Women with singleton pregnancies were recruited immediately <b>after</b> <b>delivery</b> (gestational age > 26. 0 weeks). Women with PE or IUGR were matched with healthy controls by age, BMI, gestational age and delivery mode. Venous blood samples and urine samples were tested for {{oxidative stress}} products 24 h and 48 h <b>after</b> <b>delivery.</b> RESULTS: Plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration 24 h <b>after</b> <b>delivery</b> was significantly higher in subjects with PE or IUGR (3. 41 +/- 1. 14 micromol/L, n= 20) than in controls (2. 91 +/- 0. 82 micromol/L, n= 38) (P= 0. 04).
