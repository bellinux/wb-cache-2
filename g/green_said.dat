C. <b>Green</b> <b>said</b> that Johnson should not play, and several NBA players, including Utah Jazz forward Karl Malone, argued {{that they would be}} at risk of contamination if Johnson suffered an open wound while on court. Johnson led the West to a 153–113win and was crowned All-Star MVP after recording 25points, 9assists, and 5rebounds.

25|$|Green began 2003 {{by winning}} the pole for the Daytona 500 and had a 7th-place finish at Texas Motor Speedway, but {{otherwise}} failed to finish higher than 20th and crashed twice. After an incident with teammate Harvick at Richmond, Richard Childress Racing fired Green on May 5. Two days later, he {{was picked up by}} DEI to drive the No. 1 Pennzoil-sponsored Chevrolet, replacing Steve Park, who was hired by Childress to drive the No. 30. Green fared no better than 16th in 12 races and was replaced by John Andretti. He was also replaced in the road-course races by Ron Fellows. In reaction, <b>Green</b> <b>said</b> he was not given the opportunity to improve the situation. After missing three events, Green drove the No. 43 Cheerios/Betty Crocker-sponsored Dodge Intrepid for Petty Enterprises in the Dover 400 after the original driver, Christian Fittipaldi, had a commitment to drive the No. 44 in four races. After driving the Dodge again in the EA Sports 500 the next week, he became the driver {{for the rest of the}} season on a race-to-race basis. Green's best finish with the team was 16th at Dover International Speedway; team owner Richard Petty expressed anticipation that the team could work well together after a few months.

After the New York premiere, Evangeline Earl, a student, announced that Green's book, from which the film was adapted, had been inspired by her sister Esther Earl, who had also been an author. Esther suffered from thyroid cancer and died in 2010. Evangeline said Esther had met Green at LeakyCon, a Harry Potter convention held in Boston in 2009. <b>Green</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I could never have written The Fault in Our Stars without knowing Esther. Every word on that book depends on her." [...] <b>Green</b> <b>said</b> {{he used the word}} [...] "okay" [...] in the book and the film because Hazel and Augustus used it to express their love for each other; it becomes a special word between them. The original novel was inspired by the late author Esther Earl, who used the word [...] "okay" [...] with her sister Abigail.|$|E
500|$|Tim <b>Green</b> <b>said</b> of the {{building}} that the exterior of {{the building}} was designed to be in keeping with the existing Wales Millennium Centre, while the interior had a theme all its own. [...] "The concept behind the design of the interior of Hoddinott Hall was that of a traditional Welsh chapel." [...] "The timber treatment at low level is very reminiscent of Victorian chapels and the masonry above. The stonework you would normally get in a stone chapel has been replaced by concrete." ...|$|E

And that's what they did. It's unfair." [...] However, <b>Green</b> <b>said</b> {{he would not have}} done it again if he had to: [...] "It just wasn't worth it... The trauma, the battling we all got caught up in. I don't want to ever go back to that." ...|$|E

At the time, however, ODOT director Bobby <b>Green</b> <b>said</b> that his agency could not buy the turnpike {{due to a lack of}} funds. The Chickasaw cost nearly $44million to build (equivalent to $ in [...] ). Its first section opened on September 1, 1991.

500|$|Carte {{was deeply}} {{affected}} {{by the death of}} his son Michael in 1932, discussed below. [...] The actor Martyn <b>Green</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "The heart dropped right out of him. [...] His interest in both the operas and the hotel seemed to fade away." [...] Nevertheless, in 1934 the company made a highly successful eight-month North American tour with Green as its new principal comedian, replacing Henry Lytton. [...] Carte gave approval for, and was closely consulted about, a 1938 film version of The Mikado produced and conducted by Geoffrey Toye, starring Green and released by Universal Pictures, but his only new stage production after 1932 was of The Yeomen of the Guard designed in 1939 by Peter Goffin. The re-staging was regarded as radical, but when Goffin took fright at the storm of controversy, Carte told him, [...] "I don't care what they say about the production. I should care if they said nothing." ...|$|E
500|$|In her {{review for}} TrekNation, Michelle Erica <b>Green</b> <b>said</b> {{that she was}} pleased with the {{continuity}} seen in [...] "Rajiin" [...] but felt that the female sexuality seen in this episode was the [...] "most gratuitous... I can remember on Trek". She thought that the Rajiin character was a cliché, calling her a [...] "trained slut who comes on to everyone around her". Green described the overall plot as [...] "feeble", but praised the alien bazaar set. Jamahl Epsicokhan, on his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews", said that [...] "Rajiin" [...] demonstrated that there was an intention for the Xindi story-arc to be a fully fledged space opera. He thought that the episode was average for the third season, and wasn't as good as [...] "". However, he felt that the scenes were reminiscent of comic books, saying that [...] "There's nothing really wrong with that. Nothing great about it either." [...] He gave it a score of 2.5/4.|$|E
500|$|In her {{review for}} the website TrekNation, Michelle Erica <b>Green</b> <b>said</b> that the episode entertained, but was an [...] "ultimately {{pointless}} time-travel episode that redeems its existence primarily by not requiring a reset button." [...] But {{she thought that}} Orser was [...] "superb" [...] as the [...] "repugnant" [...] Loomis, and the episode was [...] "entertaining fluff" [...] but was [...] "warm and witty and well-done." [...] Jamahl Epsicokhan on his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews", called the episode a [...] "turkey" [...] and {{said that it was}} [...] "a mediocre time-travel bore with barely enough plot for me to accuse of not making sense." [...] He criticized the lack of explanation given to the Xindi's involvement in the Temporal Cold War, and said that the plot itself was akin to [...] "swiss cheese" [...] due to the number of plot holes. He gave the episode a score of one and a half out of four.|$|E
