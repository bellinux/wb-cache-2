5|$|Hańska {{wrote to}} Balzac {{several times during}} 1832. On 7 November she posted a seven-page letter filled with praise and flattery:Your soul embraces centuries, Monsieur; its {{philosophical}} concepts {{appear to be the}} fruit of long study matured by time; yet I am told that you are still young. I would like to know you, but feel that I have no need to do so. I know you through my own spiritual instinct; <b>I</b> <b>picture</b> you in my own way and feel that were I to set eyes upon you I should exclaim, 'That is he!' Your outward semblance probably does not reveal your brilliant imagination; you have to be moved, the sacred fire of genius has to be lit, if you are to show yourself as you really are, and you are what I feel you to be—a man superior in his knowledge of the human heart.|$|E
500|$|With {{no return}} address, Balzac {{was left to}} reply in the Gazette de France, {{with the hope that}} she would see the notice. She did not, but wrote again in November: [...] "Your soul embraces centuries, monsieur; its {{philosophical}} concepts appear to be the fruit of long study matured by time; yet I am told you are still young. I would like to know you, but feel I have no need to do so. I know you through my own spiritual instinct; <b>I</b> <b>picture</b> you in my own way, and feel that if I were to actually set eyes upon you, I should instantly exclaim, 'That is he!'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Waters said, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>picture</b> {{myself as}} a child, I see myself {{constructing}} something, out of plasticine or papier-mâché or Meccano; I used to enjoy writing poems and stories, too." [...] She wrote stories and poems that she describes as [...] "dreadful gothic pastiches", but had not planned her career. Despite her obvious enjoyment of writing, she did not feel any special calling or preference for becoming a novelist in her youth.|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>picture</b> {{my small}} self in the dimly-lighted rooms, sitting {{with my head}} upon my hand, {{listening}} to the doleful performance of Mr. Mell, and conning tomorrow's lessons. <b>I</b> <b>picture</b> myself with my books shut up, still listening to the doleful performance of Mr. Mell, and listening through it to {{what used to be}} at home, and to the blowing of the wind on Yarmouth flats, and feeling very sad and solitary. <b>I</b> <b>picture</b> myself going up to bed, among the unused rooms, and sitting on my bed-side crying for a comfortable word from Peggotty. <b>I</b> <b>picture</b> myself coming downstairs in the morning, and looking through a long ghastly gash of a staircase window at the school-bell hanging on the top of an out-house with a weathercock above it; and dreading the time when it shall ring J. Steerforth and the rest to work: which is only second, in my foreboding apprehensions, to the time when the man with the wooden leg shall unlock the rusty gate to give admission to the awful Mr. Creakle. I cannot think I was a very dangerous character in any of these aspects, but in all of them I carried the same warning on my back.|$|E
60|$|Generally, but not always. Sometimes {{brighter}} visions rise before me. When I dress (the {{occupation of}} two hours), {{for a great}} ball given at the Larkins's (the anticipation of three weeks), I indulge my fancy with pleasing images. <b>I</b> <b>picture</b> myself taking courage to make a declaration to Miss Larkins. <b>I</b> <b>picture</b> Miss Larkins sinking her head upon my shoulder, and saying, 'Oh, Mr. Copperfield, can I believe my ears!' <b>I</b> <b>picture</b> Mr. Larkins waiting on me next morning, and saying, 'My dear Copperfield, my daughter has told me all. Youth is no objection. Here are twenty thousand pounds. Be happy!' <b>I</b> <b>picture</b> my aunt relenting, and blessing us; and Mr. Dick and Doctor Strong being present at the marriage ceremony. I am a sensible fellow, I believe--I believe, on looking back, I mean--and modest I am sure; but all this goes on notwithstanding. I repair to the enchanted house, where there are lights, chattering, music, flowers, officers (I am sorry to see), and the eldest Miss Larkins, a blaze of beauty. She is dressed in blue, with blue flowers in her hair--forget-me-nots--as if SHE had any need to wear forget-me-nots. It is the first really grown-up party that I have ever been invited to, and I am a little uncomfortable; for I appear not to belong to anybody, and nobody appears {{to have anything to}} say to me, except Mr. Larkins, who asks me how my schoolfellows are, which he needn't do, as I have not come there to be insulted.|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>picture</b> to myself, with {{a painful}} sympathy, Rowena {{undergoing}} this disagreeable sentence. All her virtues, her resolution, her chaste energy and perseverance, shine with redoubled lustre, and, {{for the first}} time since the commencement of the history, I feel that I am partially reconciled to her. The weary year passes--she grows weaker and more languid, thinner and thinner! At length Ivanhoe, in the disguise of a barrister of the Northern Circuit, is introduced to her cell, and finds his lady in the last stage of exhaustion, on the straw of her dungeon, with her little boy in her arms. She has preserved his life at the expense of her own, giving him the whole of the pittance which her gaolers allowed her, and perishing herself of inanition.|$|E
60|$|He {{was a man}} {{who made}} no noise in the world: though the world, it seems, made a little noise at him in his time, as it does often bark and yell at those who will not go its way; as it barked at poor Christian, when he went through Vanity Fair, and would not buy its wares, or join in its frivolities. Such a man was this Psalmist; for whom the world had nothing but scorn first, and then forgetfulness. We do not know his name, or where he lived. We do not even know, within a few hundred years, when he lived. <b>I</b> <b>picture</b> him to myself always as a poor, shrivelled, stooping, mean-looking old man; his visage marred more than any man, and his figure more than the sons of men; no form nor comeliness in him, nor beauty that men should desire him; despised and {{rejected}} of men: a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief, even as his Master was after him.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose an {{algorithm}} that automatically detects clear scene cut locations from an MPEG- 1 video bit streams coded with a GOP structure of M= 1, without B pictures.

A "Type Matching Parameter" (TMP) is developed to estimate the matching degree between the macroblock types of two P pictures.

60|$|At {{all points}} where I {{attacked}} myself, my wife defended me, excused me, and yet I could not clear myself--could not rest. In imagination <b>I</b> <b>pictured</b> that dear, sweet face {{turned toward the}} door, and heard that faint voice asking for me.|$|R
60|$|In {{answer to}} this, I can only state that I am acting under orders, {{and that those}} orders {{have been given to}} me (as I understand) in the {{interests}} of truth. I am forbidden to tell more in this narrative than I knew myself at the time. Or, to put it plainer, I am to keep strictly within the limits of my own experience, and am not to inform you of what other persons told me--for the very sufficient reason that you are to have the information from those other persons themselves, at first hand. In this matter of the Moonstone the plan is, not to present reports, but to produce witnesses. <b>I</b> <b>picture</b> to myself {{a member of the family}} reading these pages fifty years hence. Lord! what a compliment he will feel it, to be asked to take nothing on hear-say, and to be treated in all respects like a Judge on the bench.|$|E
60|$|But that wasn't all the Picture. The murderer {{was there}} {{as well as the}} victim. Besides the table, and the box, and the wounded man, and the pistol, I saw another figure behind, getting out of the window. It was the figure of a man, I should say about twenty-five or thirty: he had just raised himself to the ledge, and was poising to leap; for the room, as I {{afterwards}} learned, though on the ground floor, stood raised on a basement above the garden behind. I couldn't see the man's face, or any part of him, indeed, except his stooping back, and his feet, and his neck, and his elbows. But what little I saw was printed indelibly on the very fibre of my nature. I could have recognised that man anywhere if I saw him in the same attitude. I could have sworn to him in any court of justice on the strength of his back alone, so vividly did <b>I</b> <b>picture</b> it.|$|E
6000|$|It was so with Machiavelli. <b>I</b> <b>picture</b> him at San Casciano as {{he lived}} in {{retirement}} upon his property {{after the fall of}} the Republic, perhaps with a twinge of the torture that punished his conspiracy still lurking in his limbs. Such twinges could not stop his dreaming. Then it was [...] "The Prince" [...] was written. All day he went about his personal affairs, saw homely neighbours, dealt with his family, gave vent to everyday passions. He would sit in the shop of Donato del Corno gossiping curiously among vicious company, or pace the lonely woods of his estate, book in hand, full of bitter meditations. In the evening he returned home and went to his study. At the entrance, he says, he pulled off his peasant clothes covered with the dust and dirt of that immediate life, washed himself, put on his [...] "noble court dress," [...] closed the door on the world of toiling and getting, private loving, private hating and personal regrets, sat down with a sigh of contentment to those wider dreams.|$|E
60|$|There {{was little}} chance {{he would give}} us an {{opportunity}} of slipping into old Mary's cabin unobserved, and <b>I</b> <b>pictured</b> to myself the alarm and distress of Uncle 'Rasmus as the hours went by and we failed to put in an appearance.|$|R
50|$|Ancona creates {{books for}} {{children}} ages 8 to 12. The photographs tell the story, he explained to students for Scholastic Corporation (scholastic.com).Do you have a story in mind before you take the pictures, or do you take the pictures and then write the story?Before <b>I</b> start taking <b>pictures</b> <b>I</b> create a sequence that will fit in a 48-page book. Then <b>I</b> start taking <b>pictures</b> and assign the pictures to the squares I drew. Once <b>I</b> have <b>pictures</b> telling the story I start writing in sequence, which is dictated by the <b>pictures.</b> <b>I</b> let the <b>pictures</b> tell me the story. I find that I do better if I know nothing about a subject before I start the book. The discovery of a subject {{is what makes it}} fun and that makes the book fun. I like to end up with a life experience that will enrich my life.How many pictures do you have to take to make a book?Usually for every <b>picture,</b> <b>I</b> use one roll of film. There are usually 50 pictures in a book, so there are 50 rolls and each roll is 36 exposures. So, for a book with 50 <b>pictures</b> <b>I</b> will take 1,800 photographs.|$|R
