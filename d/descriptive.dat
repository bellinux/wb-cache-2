40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{structural}} elements of route-descriptions in Japanese direction-giving discourse. The {{aim is to}} shed light on the characteristics of contact and native situations. The results show that in native situations the amount of <b>descriptives</b> is only slightly lower than directives and is signiﬁcantly higher than the amount of <b>descriptives</b> in contact situation. Furthermore, most of the directives and <b>descriptives</b> contain environmental features and modifiers, which provide additional information about them. The direction giver in the native situation tries to provide more information in order to increase the eﬃciency of the route-description. On the other hand, in contact situations the amount of directives was double the amount of <b>descriptives.</b> Other characteristics include using signiﬁcantly fewer environmental features and modiﬁers than in contact situation. Here the direction giver focuses on providing only directives with direction designations, while using fewer structural elements such as <b>descriptives,</b> environmental features and modiﬁers {{in order to reduce the}} amount of information for the non-native direction seeker...|$|R

The name Herfjötur has been theorised as pointing to the ability of the valkyries to place fetters.

5|$|The Old Norse poems Völuspá, Grímnismál, Darraðarljóð and the Nafnaþulur {{section of}} the Prose Edda book Skáldskaparmál, provide lists of valkyrie names. In addition, some valkyrie names appear solely outside of these lists, such as Sigrún (who is attested in the poems Helgakviða Hundingsbana I and Helgakviða Hundingsbana II). Many valkyrie names {{emphasize}} associations with battle and, in many cases, on the spear—a weapon heavily associated with the god Odin. Some scholars propose that {{the names of the}} valkyries themselves contain no individuality, but are rather <b>descriptive</b> of the traits and nature of war-goddesses, and are possibly the <b>descriptive</b> creations of skalds.|$|E

5|$|A Vision of the Last Judgement is a {{painting}} by William Blake that was designed in 1808 before becoming a lost artwork. The painting was to be shown in an 1810 exhibition with a detailed analysis added to a second edition of his <b>Descriptive</b> Catalogue. This plan was dropped after the exhibition was cancelled, and the painting disappeared. Blake's notes for the <b>Descriptive</b> Catalogue describe {{various aspects of the}} work in a detailed manner, which allow the aspects of the painting to be known. Additionally, earlier designs that reveal similar Blake depiction of the Last Judgement have survived, and these date back to an 1805 precursor design created for Robert Blair's The Grave. In addition to Blake's notes on the painting, a letter written to Ozias Humphrey provides a description of the various images within an earlier design of the Last Judgement.|$|E
