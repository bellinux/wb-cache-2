40|$|<b>Private</b> <b>international</b> <b>law</b> {{presents}} a dilemma for {{legal and political}} philosophy. Legal and political philosophers have ignored <b>private</b> <b>international</b> <b>law,</b> {{with only a few}} scattered attempts to evaluate its claims. <b>Private</b> <b>international</b> <b>law</b> offers a powerful set of counterexamples that put into serious doubt attempts to link law’s authority only or primarily to relationships between states and citizens. No society, state, or other practice-mediated relationship can serve as grounds for the authority of <b>private</b> <b>international</b> <b>law</b> to persons to whom it applies but who are outside of such relationships. <b>Private</b> <b>international</b> <b>law</b> affects the normative situations of persons entirely outside these relationships. This article examines these issues from the standpoint of contractualist moral and political philosophy. How can <b>private</b> <b>international</b> <b>law</b> be justified from a moral point of view? The aim {{of this article is to}} show that the moral justification of <b>private</b> <b>international</b> <b>law,</b> in particular the law on jurisdiction and recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments, requires an evaluation of the coercive qualities of <b>private</b> <b>international</b> <b>law.</b> Suitably constructed moral principles, which permit reasonable restrictions on liberty, are developed...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} one of the most significant concepts of contemporary <b>private</b> <b>international</b> <b>law</b> - the concept of habitual residence. The concept of habitual residence was introduced into the field of <b>private</b> <b>international</b> <b>law</b> within the context of the unification work of the Hague Conference of <b>Private</b> <b>International</b> <b>Law</b> in the interest of finding a compromise between the traditional connecting factors of domicile, dominant in the sphere of common law, and nationality, that is historically closely bound to continental legal systems. Thanks to the long and systematic unification work of the Hague Conference of <b>Private</b> <b>International</b> <b>Law,</b> the connecting factor of habitual residence has gained a permanent indisputable position in <b>private</b> <b>international</b> <b>law.</b> The concept of habitual residence has also forcefully made its way through into the rapidly developing sphere of European <b>private</b> <b>international</b> <b>law.</b> The European Union has followed in the footsteps of the Hague Conference of <b>Private</b> <b>International</b> Law: habitual residence is today the central, most frequently adopted connecting factor in the unified conflict-of-laws rules, that determine the applicable law, as well as in the rules that determine the jurisdiction of the forum.

40|$|Many {{agree that}} <b>private</b> <b>international</b> <b>law</b> does {{a poor job}} of leading to good and {{predictable}} results. Can law and economics bring more scientific, objective foundations to the discipline? Economics, one may hope, can bring the conclusiveness to the field that doctrine could not. But even a fleeting review of existing studies reveals a discrepancy of views or economic approaches that mirrors the discrepancy in the traditional <b>private</b> <b>international</b> <b>law</b> doctrine. This article sets out to test whether different models lead to different outcomes. It makes arguments in three economic models - a <b>private</b> <b>law</b> model, an <b>international</b> law model, and a model combining the two. The subject area for this analysis is <b>private</b> <b>international</b> <b>law</b> of torts, more specifically the question of the law applicable to cross-border torts. The result is that the debate whether <b>private</b> <b>international</b> <b>law</b> is 2 ̆ 2 <b>private</b> <b>law</b> 2 ̆ 2 or (public) 2 ̆ 2 international law 2 ̆ 2 is replicated in the economic analysis of <b>private</b> <b>international</b> <b>law.</b> Rather than resolve problems of <b>private</b> <b>international</b> <b>law,</b> economic analysis reformulates them. This does not make economic analysis useless at all, but it puts into question its promise of objective neutral solutions...|$|R
40|$|<b>Private</b> <b>International</b> <b>Law</b> {{scholars}} have traditionally enjoyed a broad interpretative freedom. This reflected the recurrent attempt, typical of this area, to build self-sufficient systems of law, resting on autonomous principles. In contemporary <b>Private</b> <b>International</b> <b>Law,</b> such broad margins of discretion has reduced {{primarily as a}} result of the more analytical process triggered by the codified national rules and {{as a result of}} the - often impressive - development of uniform rules, notably within the European Union. Furthermore, in such fields as the law of personal status, the interpreter is required to accommodate the operation of <b>private</b> <b>international</b> <b>law</b> rules with the human concerns conveyed by constitutional and international law. Interpretative discretion in the field of <b>Private</b> <b>International</b> <b>Law</b> should therefore be reconsidered, bearing in mind both the mult-level system of sources and the material policies that affect the functioning of <b>private</b> <b>international</b> <b>law</b> rules...|$|R
