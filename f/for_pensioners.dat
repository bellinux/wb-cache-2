25|$|In 1966 the Taoiseach Seán Lemass retired. Haughey {{declared}} his candidature to succeed Lemass in the consequent leadership election, and George Colley and Neil Blaney did likewise. As {{this meant that}} there were three strong candidates who held strong and divisive views {{on the future of}} the party, the party elders sought to find a compromise candidate. Lemass himself encouraged his Minister for Finance, Jack Lynch, to contest the party leadership, and encouraged Colley, Haughey and Blaney to withdraw in favour of Lynch, arguing that they would not win a contest against him. However, Colley refused the Taoiseach's request and insisted on remaining in the race, but he was defeated by Lynch. Upon Lynch's election as Taoiseach, Haughey was appointed Minister for Finance by Lynch in a Cabinet reshuffle, which indicated that Haughey's withdrawal was a gain at the expense of Colley. The inexpensive and socially inclusive initiatives that Haughey made caught the public imagination; these included popular decisions to introduce free travel on public transport <b>for</b> <b>pensioners,</b> subsidise electricity <b>for</b> <b>pensioners,</b> the granting of special tax concessions for the disabled and tax exemptions for artists. They increased Haughey's populist appeal and his support from certain elements in the media and artistic community.|$|E

25|$|A law of 9 June 1975 {{increased}} the number of eligible occupational diseases and extended the duration of benefits. A law of 3 June 1975 introduced various benefit improvements <b>for</b> <b>pensioners.</b> The multiplying coefficient was raised to 2% and applied to average earnings of the best 3 years in the last 10 years of work, and automatic annual adjustment of minimum pensions to increase of the minimum contractual wage in the industrial sector (with a smaller adjustment made for pensions higher than the minima). A law of 27 December 1975 introduced ad hoc upgrading of cash benefits for certain diseases and of all flat-rate allowances. A law of 14 July 1967 extended family allowances to self-employed farmers, sharecroppers, and tenant farmers. On 29 April 1976, pension linkage to the industrial wage was extended to civil servants.|$|E
25|$|According to A.B. Atkinson, social {{security}} received much more {{attention from the}} first Wilson government than it did during the previous thirteen years of Conservative government. Following its victory in the 1964 general election, Wilson's government began to increase social benefits. Prescription charges for medicines were abolished immediately, while pensions were raised to a record 21% of average male industrial wages. In 1966, the system of National Assistance (a social assistance scheme for the poor) was overhauled and renamed Supplementary Benefit. The means test was replaced with a statement of income, and benefit rates <b>for</b> <b>pensioners</b> (the great majority of claimants) were increased, granting them a real gain in income. Before the 1966 election, the widow's pension was tripled. Due to austerity measures following an economic crisis, prescription charges were re-introduced in 1968 {{as an alternative to}} cutting the hospital building programme, although those sections of the population who were most in need (including supplementary benefit claimants, the long-term sick, children, and pensioners) were exempted from charges.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to Bourne's tradition {{of agriculture and}} Lincolnshire's horticulture, and to its site and environment as detailed below, the school has its own gardening clubs and grows its own vegetables. It has organised voluntary maintenance of public flower beds in Bourne by pupils since 2009. An orchard has been donated to the school, {{and this has been}} maintained by the pupils with the aim of provision of some fruit to the school. Besides the Food for Life Partnership award and the cookery club as mentioned above, the pupils cook pancakes for the Pancake Day celebrations. The school has a choir which also sings in Bourne Methodist Church. The choir has performed at local public events, such as the turning on of the Christmas lights in Bourne in 2007, and charity events such as the Bourne Round Table dinner <b>for</b> <b>pensioners</b> in 2008. As Lincolnshire champions and as representative of the East Midlands, the school's rugby team reached the finals of the Tag 2 Twickenham rugby tournament and competed at Rugby School in Warwickshire in 2009. Cycling has been supported by the school, with a six-week Go-Ride cycling skills programme taking place in 2008. Some pupils from the school take part in other sports such as motocross and skateboarding; a pupil asked the council for a local skatepark in 2002, and the idea was being resurrected by the council as of 2010. One pupil won three gold medals in the Cambridgeshire Gymnastics floor and vault competition in 2008.|$|E

2500|$|Under the SDP-FDP coalition, social {{policies}} in West Germany {{took on a}} more egalitarian character {{and a number of}} important reforms were carried out to improve the prospects of previously neglected and underprivileged groups. Greater emphasis was placed on policies favouring single parents, larger families, and the lower paid, and further improvements were made in social benefits <b>for</b> <b>pensioners</b> and disabled persons. Rates of social assistance (excluding rent) as a percentage of average gross earnings of men in manufacturing industries rose during the Social-Liberal coalition’s time in office, while social welfare provision was greatly extended, with pensions and health care opened up to large sections of the population. This in turn substantially increased the size and cost of the social budget, as social program costs grew by over 10% a year during much of the Seventies. Government spending as a percentage of GDP rose significantly under the SPD-FDP coalition, from 39% in 1969 to around 50% by 1982. Between 1970 and 1981, social spending as a proportion of GNP rose by 21.4%, and in terms of percentage of GNP went up from 25,7% in 1970 to 31.2% in 1981. Much was accomplished in the way of social reform during the SDP-FDP coalition's first five years on office, with one study noting that [...] "“the years 1969 to 1974 represent a phase of social policy in which the state introduced new minimum benefits and extended existing ones.” ...|$|E

The deal would extend the current contract {{for an additional}} year to September 2012, and preserves the current average assembly-worker base pay of about $34 an hour. It would eliminate a $1,700 annual [...] "special bonus," [...] and reduce special paid absences or [...] "SPA days" [...] from two weeks to one week a year, while maintaining vacation entitlements which range up to six weeks a year for high-seniority workers. The deal also introduce payments by members toward their health benefits - $30 monthly per family for workers and $15 a month <b>for</b> <b>pensioners.</b> Lewenza said it also would trim by 35 per cent company contributions to union-provided programs such as child care and wellness programs. Lewenza called the package a [...] "major sacrifice." [...] However, observers noted that the deal did not go far enough; Dominion Bond Rating Service analyst Kam Hon described it as [...] "not material." [...] Automotive industry consultant Dennis DesRosiers said that General Motors had missed the chance to slash labour costs, pointing out that bankruptcy was a looming threat, Ottawa and Queen's Park demanded cuts to the labour bill {{as a condition of}} the bailout, and that the deficit to the pension fund would prevent the CAW from striking. He estimated the total hourly cost of a GM Canada worker, including benefits, is $75 to $78, and saying that [...] "they [...] got six or seven." [...] when it should have been cut by $20. DesRosiers also said giving up cost-of-living increases is not significant when inflation is nearly non-existent and added that the 40-hour reduction in paid time off merely means [...] "five fewer spa days." [...] University of Toronto professor Joe D'Cruz calculated that it would save $148 million a year, though GM is seeking $6 billion in Canadian government support.|$|E

She wept much, and the Bishop said, [...] "Bring them both to me; who knows whether they may live to wish for it again?" [...] The native Christians, poor people employed on the beach, remnants of the old Portuguese Missions, had built a church at their own expense, and, being unable to obtain regular ministrations from their own clergy, begged the Bishop to consecrate their building, and give them a clergyman, and this he hoped to do on his return.|$|E
