50|$|The {{approach}} can be further expanded to model the response of a 3D <b>geological</b> <b>model.</b> This is used to reduce the uncertainty in interpretation by modelling {{the response of the}} 3D model to a synthetic seismic acquisition that matches as closely as possible to that actually used in acquiring the data that has been interpreted. The synthetic seismic data is then processed using the same sequence as that used for the original data. This method can be used to model both 2D and 3D seismic data that has been acquired over the area of the <b>geological</b> <b>model.</b> During the planning of a seismic survey, 3D modelling can be used to test the effect of variation in seismic acquisition parameters, such as the shooting direction or the maximum offset between source and receiver, on the imaging of a particular geological structure.|$|E

A real study case at Haut-Barr, France is presented to demonstrate our solution.
