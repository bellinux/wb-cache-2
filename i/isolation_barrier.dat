Although the commons of each channel are isolated from power ground by the input-to-output <b>isolation</b> <b>barrier,</b> they are not isolated from each other. Therefore a common mode voltage on one will attempt to float all the others, sometimes with disastrous results.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which species are formed is a central question in evolutionary biology. The Biological Species Concept has provided a framework for quantifying, via reproductive isolation, the extent of divergence between populations. The relative strengths and importance of individual reproductive <b>isolation</b> <b>barriers</b> is unclear. This study estimated the strength of ecogeographic (prezygotic) isolation and intrinsic (postzygotic) <b>isolation</b> <b>barriers</b> (genetic incompatibilities between hybrids) between the closely related annual monkeyflowers, Mimulus glaucescens and M. guttatus. Georeferenced herbarium records and environmental data were used to model each species ecological niche and to measure their habitat overlap. Reciprocal crosses between species were performed to measure hybrid seed set, germination success of the resulting seeds, biomass of F 1 adult plants, total number of days to first flower (developmental rate), total flower production, ovule numbers, and pollen viability, as intrinsic postzygotic isolation. The species exhibited both ecogeographical isolation and non-reciprocal intrinsic isolation (observed in seed set, developmental rate, and ovule production). These results suggest that isolation {{was a result of}} geologic history causing divergent ecological selection, where ecogeographical isolation acted before and limited a minimum of 45...|$|R

Pre-mating (behavior tactics, habitat or food divergence, phenotypic divergence and assortative mating) and post-mating, post-zygotic <b>isolation</b> <b>barriers</b> (selection against unfit hybrids) are well studied in numerous species, but little is known about what is happening between insemination and fertilization (post-mating, pre-zygotic <b>isolation</b> <b>barriers).</b> In this study, we chose the well-studied population of pied and collared flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca and F. albicollis) of the hybrid zone of Öland, Sweden, to investigate possible patterns of gamete divergence between these two closely related species. We compared sperm morphology between the two species and their hybrids, analyzing traits that are thought to play an important role in the fertilization success of the males.

50|$|One of {{the most}} common methods for {{protection}} is to limit electric current by using multiple series resistors (assuming that resistors always fail open); and limit the voltage with multiple zener devices to ground (assuming diodes always fail shorted). Sometimes an alternative type of barrier known as a galvanic <b>isolation</b> <b>barrier</b> may be used. Certification standards for intrinsic safety designs, which vary by device type, generally require that the barrier not exceed approved levels of voltage and current with specified damage to limiting components.|$|E
50|$|The {{frequency}} of the common mode voltage can adversely affect performance. Higher frequency common mode voltages create difficulty for many isolation amplifiers due to the parasitic capacitance of the <b>isolation</b> <b>barrier.</b> This capacitance appears as a low impedance to higher frequency signals, and allows the common mode voltage to essentially blow past the barrier and interfere with measurements, or even damage the amplifier. However, most common mode voltages are a composite of line voltages, so frequencies generally remain in the 50 to 60 Hz region with some harmonic content, well within the rejection range of most isolation amplifiers.|$|E
50|$|Isolation {{amplifiers}} are a form {{of differential}} amplifier that allow measurement of small signals {{in the presence of}} a high common mode voltage by providing electrical isolation and an electrical safety barrier. They protect data acquisition components from common mode voltages, which are potential differences between instrument ground and signal ground. Instruments that are applied {{in the presence of a}} common mode voltage without an <b>isolation</b> <b>barrier</b> allow ground currents to circulate, leading in the best case to a noisy representation of the signal under investigation. In the worst case, assuming that the magnitude of common mode voltage or current is sufficient, instrument destruction is likely. Isolation amplifiers are used in medical instruments to ensure isolation of a patient from power supply leakage current.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{drawbacks}} of single-photon avalanche diode arrays is optical crosstalk between adjacent detectors.

Accordingly, deep trenches coated with metal were introduced as optical <b>isolation</b> <b>barriers</b> between pixels. This solution, however, was unable to completely prevent the crosstalk. In this letter, we demonstrate that a strong contribution to optical crosstalk comes from photons reflected {{at the bottom of}} the chip.

40|$|Background: The Mediterranean {{fruit fly}} Ceratitis Capitata (DIPTERA: Tephritidae) {{is a major}} {{agricultural}} pest in Argentina. One main cause {{for the success of}} non-contaminant control programs based on genetic strategies is compatibility between natural and laboratory germplasms. A comprehensive characterization of the fruit fly based on genetic studies and compatibility analysis was undertaken on two founder populations from the provinces of Buenos Aires and Mendoza, used in pioneering sterile male technique control programmes in our country. The locations are 1, 000 km apart from each other. Methodology/Principal Findings: We compared the genetic composition of both populations based on cytological, physiological and morphological characterization. Compatibility studies were performed {{in order to determine the}} presence of <b>isolation</b> <b>barriers.</b> Results indicate that the Buenos Aires germplasm described previously is partially different from that of the Mendoza population. Both laboratory colonies are a reservoir of mutational and cytological polymorphisms. Some sexual chromosome variants such as the XL and the YL resulting from attachment of a B-chromosome to the X-chromosome or Y-chromosome behave as a lethal sex-linked factor. Our results also show incompatibility between both germplasms and pre-zygotic <b>isolation</b> <b>barriers</b> between them. Our evidence is consistent with the fact that polymorphisms are responsible for the lack of compatibility. Conclusions: The genetic control mechanism should be directly produced in the germplasm of the target population i...|$|R
40|$|Background: The trees Prunus armeniaca (apricot), P. mume (mei or Chinese plum), and Armeniaca mume (xingmei) are {{all members}} of the Armeniaca section of the genus Prunus. The three trees are {{cultivated}} widely in China. Hypotheses: Geographical distribution and divergent flowering phenologies constitute pre-zygotic, reproductive <b>isolation</b> <b>barriers</b> that promoted the speciation of P. armeniaca and P. mume. Xingmei is an artificial hybrid of the other two species. Methods: We studied the geographic distribution and flowering phenologies of P. armeniaca and P. mume cultivars from different regions of China. We analysed the copious data of the China Fruit Records (mei and apricot). To examine the origin of xingmei, we analysed the F 2 progenies of P. armeniaca × P. mume using a species-specific molecular marker. Finally, we researched the genotypes of P. mume, P. armeniaca, and xingmei to determine whether the three are post-zygotically isolated. Results: Isolation due to geographical location and flowering phenology are strong pre-zygotic <b>isolation</b> <b>barriers</b> that maintain the separation of P. armeniaca and P. mume. That separation limits the opportunity for natural hybridization between these two species, and probably prevented the natural appearance of xingmei. Furthermore, no post-zygotic repro-ductive isolation exists between P. armeniaca and P. mume. Conclusions: Pre-zygotic isolation {{played an important role in}} the evolution of P. armeniaca and P. mume. It prevented their natural hybridization. Xingmei is likely to be an artificial hybrid...|$|R

50|$|The main {{function}} of an opto-isolator is to block such high voltages and voltage transients, {{so that a}} surge {{in one part of}} the system will not disrupt or destroy the other parts.
