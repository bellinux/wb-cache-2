A full-waveform laser scanners generate informations such as amplitude, backscatter cross section and <b>echo</b> <b>width.</b> The latter is the main subject of the thesis. Automatic and simple classification of laser points is still a major challenge, especially in specific tasks such as buildings modelling. Many procedures for buildings modelling are still very dependent on human judgement. This problem encourages us to analyse <b>echo</b> <b>width</b> as a possibility for the extraction of the buildings outline. Practical work presented in the thesis was accomplished in Vienna, at the Institute of Photogrametry and Remote Sensing. All required data, professional help and all final results were gained during my research at this Institution. Analysis includes two parts: the first one presents a research on the <b>echo</b> <b>width</b> and the selection of the points adequate for further process, the second one process of segmentation. A slope adaptive neighbourhood system was used and the segments acquired which represent buildings outlines of two selected houses. Main motivation for the work was a quest for more simple and automatic procedures; yet, this analysis is still based on personal judgement and not automatic work. Nevertheless, the main goal has been achieved: the extraction of the buildings outline. The thesis presents and describes an <b>echo</b> <b>width</b> in great detail.

The accuracy of the final results, correctness and completeness measures, were assessed by comparison of the classified output to a knowledge-based labelling of the points. Completeness and correctness between 90 % and 97 % was reached, depending on the class. While such results and methods were presented before, we are investigating additionally the transferability of the classification method (features, thresholds …) to another urban FWF lidar point cloud.

40|$|The {{extraction}} of land cover information from remote sensing data {{is a complex}} process. Spectral information has been widely utilized in classifying remote sensing images. However, shadows limit the use of multispectral images because they result in loss of spectral radiometric information. In addition, true reflectance may be underestimated in shaded areas. In land cover classification, shaded areas are often left unclassified or simply assigned as a shadow class. Vegetation indices from remote sensing measurement are radiation-based measurements computed through spectral combination. They indicate vegetation properties and {{play an important role}} in remote sensing of forests. Airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technology is an active remote sensing technique that produces a true orthophoto at a single wavelength. This study investigated three types of geometric lidar features where NDVI values fail to represent meaningful forest information. The three features include <b>echo</b> <b>width,</b> normalized eigenvalue, and standard deviation of the unit weight observation of the plane adjustment, and they can be derived from waveform data and discrete point clouds. Various feature combinations were carried out to evaluate the compensation of the three lidar features to vegetation detection in shaded areas. <b>Echo</b> <b>width</b> was found to outperform the other two features. Furthermore, surface characteristics estimated by <b>echo</b> <b>width</b> were similar to that by normalized eigenvalues.

40|$|In this work, the {{electromagnetic}} interaction of plane waves with infinitely long metamaterial-coated conducting cylinders is considered. Different from "conjugate" pairing of double-positive (DPS) and double-negative (DNG) or epsilon-negative (ENG) and mu-negative (MNG) concentric cylinders, achieving transparency and maximizing scattering are separately achieved by covering perfect electric conductor (PEC) cylinders with simple (i. e., homogeneous, isotropic, and linear) metamaterial coatings. The appropriate constitutive parameters of such metamaterials are investigated for Transverse Magnetic (TM) {{and in particular}} for Transverse Electric (TE) polarizations. For TE polarization it is {{found out that the}} metamaterial-coating permittivity has to be in the 0 < εc < ε 0 interval to achieve transparency, and in the - ε 0 < εc < 0 interval to achieve scattering maximization. However, unlike the "conjugate" pairing of DPS-DNG or ENG-MNG cases, when the transparency for metamaterial-coated PEC cylinders are considered, the analytically found relation between εc and the ratio of core-coating radii, γ, should be modified in a sense that scattering from the PEC core is canceled by the coating. Furthermore, replacing ε by μ (and vice versa) does not lead to the same conclusions for TM polarization unless the PEC cylinder is replaced by a perfect magnetic conductor (PMC) cylinder. On the other hand, scattering maximization can also be achieved in the TM polarization case when coating permeability μc < 0, whereas transparency requires large | μc | for this polarization.

40|$|Airborne laser {{scanning}} (ALS) is a {{remote sensing technique}} well-suited for 3 D vegetation mapping and structure characterization because the emitted laser pulses are able to penetrate small gaps in the vegetation canopy. The backscattered echoes from the foliage, woody vegetation, the terrain, and other objects are detected, leading to a cloud of points. Higher echo densities (> 20 echoes/m 2) and additional classification variables from full-waveform (FWF) ALS data, namely echo amplitude, <b>echo</b> <b>width</b> and information on multiple echoes from one shot, offer new possibilities in classifying the ALS point cloud. Currently FWF sensor information is hardly used for classification purposes. This contribution presents an object-based point cloud analysis (OBPA) approach, combining segmentation and classification of the 3 D FWF ALS points designed to detect tall vegetation in urban environments. The definition tall vegetation includes trees and shrubs, but excludes grassland and herbage. In the applied procedure FWF ALS echoes are segmented by a seeded region growing procedure. All echoes sorted descending by their surface roughness are used as seed points. Segments are grown based on <b>echo</b> <b>width</b> homogeneity. Next, segment statistics (mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation) are calculated by aggregating echo features such as amplitude and surface roughness. For classification a rule base is derived automatically from a training area using a statistical classification tree. To demonstrate our method we present data of three sites with around 500, 000 echoes each. The accuracy of the classified vegetation segments is evaluated for two independent validation sites. In a point-wise error assessment, where the classification is compared with manually classified 3 D points, completeness and correctness better than 90 % are reached for the validation sites. In comparison to many other algorithms the proposed 3 D point classification works on the original measurements directly, i. e. the acquired points.

Seeing roughness as a multi-scale level concept (i. e., ranging from fine-scale soil characteristics to description of understory and lower tree layer) various roughness raster products were derived from the original full-waveform airborne laser scanning (FWF-ALS) point cloud using {{two different types of}} roughness parameters, the surface roughness (SR) and the terrain roughness (TR). For the calculation of the SR, ALS terrain points within a defined height range to the terrain surface are considered. For the parameterization of the SR, two approaches are investigated. In the first approach, a geometric description by calculating the standard deviation of plane fitting residuals of terrain points is used.

As it provides more information than the conventional multi echo lidar, the waveform lidar {{plays an important role}} in land cover classification as well as object reconstruction. Nowadays, object-based image analysis (OBIA) has been widely applied in multispectral images. The idea of OBIA has been extended to object-based lidar points analysis. The objective of this research is to develop a procedure for object-based lidar points classification using waveform lidar data in a complex scene. There are two main steps in the proposed scheme: (1) point-based segmentation, and (2) object-based classification. Point-based segmentation uses a Euclidean clustering technique and points ’ attributes to merge the neighboring points with similar attributes. After segmentation, an object-based classification rather than point-based classification is performed. Each separated regions after segmentation is a candidate object for classification.

However, the amplitude of an echo is dependent on various factors such as the range and incidence angle, which makes it difficult to develop a classification method which can be applied to full-waveform ALS data from different sites, scanning geometries and sensors. Additional information available from full-waveform ALS data, such as range and <b>echo</b> <b>width,</b> can be used for radiometric calibration, and to derive backscatter cross section.

Traditionally, the received waveform was analyzed individually to obtain physical features by waveform decomposition technique. The relationship between neighboring waveforms is usually ignored in waveform analysis. However, the integration of adjacency waveforms may produce 3 -D backscattered energy rather than 1 -D backscattered energy. The objective {{of this study is}} to explore the feasibility of waveform stacking technique from airborne waveform lidar data. This study employs several waveform features in land cover identification, for example, <b>echo</b> <b>width,</b> amplitude, intensity, normalized digital surface model, echo ratio, backscattering coefficient and the features analyzed from waveform stacking. The benefit of waveform stacking in land cover identification is also discussed. The proposed scheme contains three major works. First, all the adjacency 1 -D waveforms are stacked into 3 -D grids based on pulse coordinates (X, Y, Z). The results of waveform stacking represent the return energy of objects for each cell. The principal components analysis (PCA) is applied to 3 -D grids to reduce data volume, and the entropy is used to describe the space texture. Second, we use cross-correlation to validate the relevance of different features. Finally, we combine the results of waveform stacking and other waveform features in object-oriented classification. After image segmentation, a nearest neighbor configuration (NN) classifier is selected in classification. The test data was located at Miao-li City, Taiwan. These multi-strip lidars were acquired by Riegl Q 680 i. The experimental results indicated that the waveform stacking technique is able to combine multiple waveforms into 3 -D voxels for object identification...|$|E
40|$|The {{electromagnetic}} scattering {{problem of}} normal incident waves on an elliptic chiral cylinder is considered. The cylinder {{is assumed to}} be homogeneous and isotropic and extends infinitely long in the z direction. An exact boundary value solution for the scattering problem of the TM wave by the elliptic chiral cylinder is analyzed and presented. The solution is based on the separation of variable technique in the elliptic cylinder coordinates system, and expressed in terms of Mathieu and modified Mathieu functions. The incident, transmitted and scattered electromagnetic waves are expressed in terms of an infinite series of wave functions. The matrix forms of the expansion coefficients are found by applying the boundary conditions and orthogonality of the Mathieu functions. The expression of the radar cross section (RCS) per unit length or <b>echo</b> <b>width</b> of electromagnetic wave scattering by elliptic chiral cylinder for co- and cross-polarized waves are derived by using the asymptotic expansions for modified Mathieu functions. Validation of the developed formulation and computer program are investigated by considering many limiting cases such as circular dielectric, circular perfect conducting, and circular chiral cylinders, as well as elliptic dielectric and elliptic perfect conducting cylinders. Numerical results of the forward and back scattered echo widths for both co- and cross-polarized waves for various cases are presented and discussed. The numerical results show the co- and cross-polarized bistatic and monostatic echo widths depend on the frequency and incidence angle of the incident wave, constitutive parameters and geometry of the elliptic chiral cylinder. In general, the echo widths decrease by increasing the chirality admittance, and increase by increasing the axes of the elliptic chiral cylinder...|$|E
40|$|Airborne laser {{scanning}} (ALS) {{has become a}} commercially available and therefore widely used technique for obtaining the geometric structure of the earth’s surface. For many ALS applications it is beneficial or even essential to classify the 3 D point cloud into different categories (e. g. ground, vegetation, building). So far, most classification techniques use the geometry of the 3 D point cloud or parameters which can be gained from analyzing the geometry {{or the number of}} echoes per emitted laser shot. Decomposing the echo waveform of full-waveform laser scanners provides in addition to the 3 D position of each echo its amplitude and width. These physical observables are influenced by many different factors (e. g. range, angle of incidence, surface characteristics, atmosphere, etc.). Therefore, these attributes can hardly be used without radiometric calibration. In this paper the theory of the radar equation will be used to transform amplitude and <b>echo</b> <b>width</b> into radiometric calibration values, such as backscatter cross section, backscattering coefficients or incidence angle corrected versions of those. For this aim, external reference targets with known backscatter characteristics are necessary for the absolute radiometric calibration. In contrast to other approaches, this paper presents the usage of natural surfaces for this calibration task. These surfaces are observed in order to determine their backscatter characteristics independently from the ALS flight mission by a RIEGL reflectometer. Based on these observations the data of the ALS flight can be calibrated. Calibration results of data acquired by a RIEGL LMS-Q 560 sensor are presented and discussed. Next to a strip-wise analysis, the radiometric calibration results of different strips in the overlapping region are studied. In this way, the accuracy of the calibration is analyzed (1) based o...|$|E
40|$|Full-waveform LiDAR is {{an active}} remote sensing {{technique}} that provides the scattering properties of the targets i. e. amplitude and <b>echo</b> <b>width</b> (EW) in addition to 3 D point clouds. The amplitude provides information on the target's reflectance and the EW is a measure for the range variation of scatterers within the laser footprint contributing to a single echo and is, therefore, an indicator for surface roughness. For the delineation of high vegetation (i. e. trees and bushes) and buildings the normalized digital surface model provides the main input. Based on a height threshold, areas covered with elevated objects can be classified. For the differentiation between buildings and high vegetation the surface roughness is used, where roofs {{are assumed to be}} smooth and vegetation rough. The surface roughness can be described with the standard deviation (SD) of detrended LiDAR points. However, for low LiDAR point densities and for very dense deciduous forests or building parts overgrown with tree crowns the separability is limited if only the SD is used. Within the presented approach additionally the EW, featuring small values for smooth roof areas, and the echo ratio (ER), a measure for the penetrability of a surface, are used. For the final delineation of high vegetation and building areas morphologic operations are applied. The classified areas are vectorized and a minimum mapping unit is applied. The presented workflow is implemented into the scientific software package OPALS (Orientation and Processing of Airborne Laser Scanning data). The results show that the EW, the SD and the ER are useful quantities to delineate high vegetation and building polygons based on full-waveform LiDAR point clouds with high accuracy. The high degree of automation and the scripting capability OPALS promise a high potential for operational large area LiDAR data processing. Examples from different test sites in Austria are shown and discussed. 1...|$|E
40|$|Roughness is an {{important}} input parameter for modeling of natural hazards such as floods, rock falls and avalanches, where it is basically assumed that flow velocities decrease with increasing roughness. Seeing roughness as a multi-scale level concept (i. e., ranging from fine-scale soil characteristics to description of understory and lower tree layer) various roughness raster products were derived from the original full-waveform airborne laser scanning (FWF-ALS) point cloud using {{two different types of}} roughness parameters, the surface roughness (SR) and the terrain roughness (TR). For the calculation of the SR, ALS terrain points within a defined height range to the terrain surface are considered. For the parameterization of the SR, two approaches are investigated. In the first approach, a geometric description by calculating the standard deviation of plane fitting residuals of terrain points is used. In the second one, the potential of the derived echo widths are analyzed for the parameterization of SR. The <b>echo</b> <b>width</b> is an indicator for roughness and the slope of the target. To achieve a comparable spatial resolution of both SR layers, the calculation of the standard deviation of detrended terrain points requires a higher terrain point density than the SR parameterization using the echo widths. The TR describes objects (i. e., point clusters) close but explicitly above the terrain surface, with 20  cm defined as threshold height value for delineation of the surface layer (i. e., forest floor layer). Two different empirically defined vegetation layers below the canopy layer were analyzed (TR I: 0. 2  m to 1. 0  m; TR II: 0. 2  m to 3. 0  m). A 1  m output grid cell size was chosen for all roughness parameters in order to provide consistency for further integration of high-resolution optical imagery. The derived roughness parameters were then jointly classified, together with a normalized Digital Surface Model (nDSM) showing the height of objects (i. e., trees) above ground. The presented approach enables the classification of forested areas in patches of different vegetation structure (e. g., varying soil roughness, understory, density of natural cover). For validation purposes in situ reference data were collected and cross-checked with the classification results, positively confirming the general feasibility of the proposed vertical concept of integrated roughness mapping on various vertical levels. Results can provide valuable input for forest mapping and monitoring, in particular with regard to natural hazard modeling...|$|E
