5|$|Daniel Knauf {{conceived}} the initial script {{for the show}} between 1990 and 1992 when he was unsatisfied with {{his job as a}} Californian health insurance broker and hoped to become a screenwriter. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> been interested in carnivals and noted that this subject had rarely been dramatized on film. Knauf's experiences of growing up with a disabled father who was not commonly accepted as a normal human strongly informed the story and its treatment of freaks.|$|E

5|$|Following his {{retirement}} from the NWMP, Primrose {{was offered the}} position of a police magistrate in Edmonton. Primrose accepted, as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> wanted to retire in the city. In 1917, he was chairman of the three-person Alberta Provincial Police board of commissioners, where he was tasked with supervising the new force. Before {{his retirement}} as magistrate in July 1935, it had been estimated that he had dealt with over 40,000 cases.|$|E
5|$|<b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> been a heavy drinker, {{and there}} were times in those seasons of discontent when he drank more than ever. But he was not always drunk. He went on the wagon (for him this meant beer instead of whiskey) for days and weeks at a time. The {{difficulty}} toward the end was that he couldn't hold the stuff. He went to pieces on his second or third drink. And he did not snap back quickly.|$|E

5|$|A {{few months}} later, a highly {{unstable}} Osborn has partially regained his sanity {{with the help}} of anti-psychotic drugs. He comes to see Parker as the son <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> wanted and attempts to have Parker take on the Green Goblin mantle using physiological torture but ultimately fails. Osborn's next plan involves using a drunken Flash Thompson to drive a truck into Midtown High School, resulting in an accident that causes Thompson brain damage. This successfully enrages Parker into what Osborn anticipates will be a climactic battle. During this confrontation, an emotionally weary Parker tells Osborn he is tired of their constant battle, and declares a truce.|$|E
5|$|After being released, JJ terminates his {{contract}} with Dhingra's company, embarks on a country-wide tour for his concerts and finally morphs fully into 'Jordan' - the true rockstar, which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> wanted to be. He turns into a bitter, arrogant, and lonely man after finding that the fame does not fill the void in his life. Khatana is now his manager, but fails to control him, and Jordan is constantly involved in fights with the media and fans. Inspite of all this, he remains a highly popular artist.|$|E

5|$|In 1903â€“04 Vaughan Williams started {{collecting}} folk-songs. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> {{been interested}} in them, and now followed {{the example of a}} recent generation of enthusiasts such as Cecil Sharp and Lucy Broadwood in going into the English countryside noting down and transcribing songs traditionally sung in various locations. Collections of the songs were published, preserving many that could otherwise have vanished as oral traditions died out. Vaughan Williams incorporated some into his own compositions, and more generally was influenced by their prevailing modal forms. This, together with his love of Tudor and Stuart music, helped shape his compositional style {{for the rest of his}} career.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Quisling's charges {{related to}} the coup, {{including}} his revocation of the mobilisation order, to his time as Nasjonal Samling leader and to his actions as Minister President, such as assisting the enemy and illegally attempting to alter the constitution. Finally, {{he was accused of}} Gunnar Eilifsen's murder. Whilst not contesting the key facts, he denied all charges on the grounds that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> worked for a free and prosperous Norway, and submitted a sixty-page response. On 11 July, a further indictment was brought, adding a raft of new charges, including more murders, theft, embezzlement and, most worrying of all for Quisling, the charge of conspiring with Hitler over the 9 April occupation of Norway.|$|E

After signing to do the film, Chopra was very excited, but a few days later, she became nervous, wondering if {{she would be able to}} do justice to the character. Having seen the original film as a teenager, Chopra avoided watching the film again as she did not wanted to imitate Zeenat Aman's portrayal of Roma. She made a conscious effort to give her own look and style to the character.|$|E

5|$|Stossel grew {{continuously}} more {{frustrated with}} having {{to follow the}} assignment editor's vision of what was news. Perhaps because of his stuttering, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> avoided covering what others covered, feeling he could not succeed if {{he was forced to}} compete with other reporters by shouting out questions at news conferences. However, this led to the unexpected realization for Stossel that more important events were those that occurred slowly, such as the women's movement, the growth of computer technology, and advancements in contraception, rather than daily events like government pronouncements, elections, fires or crime. One day, Stossel bypassed the assignment editor to give Ed Joyce a list of story ideas the assignment editor had rejected. Joyce agreed that Stossel's ideas were better, and approved them.|$|E
5|$|Stunned, the {{remaining}} Chili Peppers, {{who had no}} suitable replacement for Frusciante, hired Arik Marshall to play {{the remaining}} dates after being forced to reschedule. Upon returning to Hollywood, the band placed {{an ad in the}} L.A. Weekly for open guitar auditions, which Kiedis considered to be a waste of time. After several months of unsuccessfully looking for a suitable guitarist, drummer Chad Smith suggested Dave Navarro. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> been the band's first choice, but had been too busy following the 1991 breakup of Jane's Addiction. Navarro eventually accepted the position after productive jam sessions.|$|E
