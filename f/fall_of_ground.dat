Field investigations at 45 underground stone mines suggest that excessive beam sag or deflection {{is the principal}} unstable roof behavior characteristics associated with miner injuries. Laminated roof structures, common in most underground stone mines, allow the immediate roof to separate into distinct beams. The timely determination of roof beam deflection could provide stone miners with advanced knowledge of potentially hazardous roof. Existing methods to assess roof conditions consist of observational and monitoring techniques. Observational techniques include open drillholes, sounding, wedging, and borescopes. Monitoring techniques include scratch tools, extensometers, telltales, Miners Helpers, and Guardian Angels'. Miners have difficulty utilizing these techniques because roof beams are located an average of 8 m (26. 5 ft) above the miner's head in environments that are dark, dusty and noisy and these deflections are measured in millimeters of movement. To help mitigate the potential for <b>falls</b> <b>of</b> <b>ground</b> injuries to underground stone miners, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has developed the Roof Monitoring Safety System (RMSS) to aid in monitoring dangerous levels of roof beam deflection. If enough site-specific information is collected and placed on highly visible maps, individual mining operations could establish general guidelines for responding to specific roof beam deflection occurrences.

40|$|AbstractOn {{the basis}} of the four factors of {{spontaneous}} combustion of coal, the causes of such combustion in the tunnel <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>ground</b> were comprehensively analyzed. The causes include the generation of float coal, influence of hot wind pressure on the laneway, and airflow dynamic pressure caused by sloping roadways.

The foam was injected into the fire zone through boreholes on the tunnel roof. Given the precise scheme and reliability of the technology, the fire was successfully extinguished.

40|$|For {{coal mines}} the term bump should {{refer to a}} seismic event that is {{generated}} at {{some distance from the}} excavation and a burst should refer to a sudden uncontrolled <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>ground.</b> There may be additional seismic noise generated at the excavation boundary directly associated with the <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>ground.</b> The seismic sources for bumps {{are most likely to be}} the immediate or delayed failure of thick rock units in the overburden. For Australian coal mines, the sudden collapse of ribs should be considered to be either a strain burst in the context of the hard rock mining knowledge base or a gravity–driven kinematic failure (slump). As the depth of cover increases there is a greater thickness of failed coal at the excavation boundary and hence more material is available to be dislodged as a strain burst if the installed ground support is inadequate.

40|$|The {{rockfall}} hazard is {{the major}} contributing agency to fatal accidents in South African platinum mining operations. The majority of these accidents occur {{in close proximity to}} the working stope face. The collapse of fractured or blocky ground between individual temporary support units or the closest permanent support line to the stope face has not yet been adequately addressed. A large-scale stope support system testing facility funded by the Safety in Mines Research Advisory Committee (SIMRAC), has been designed and constructed to test support systems and stimulate innovative thinking by mining personnel, support manufacturers and suppliers by providing a facility where the interaction of stope support systems, a rigid stope face and a discontinuous hangingwall beam can be observed during quasi-static and dynamic conditions. Tests have been carried out on various types of stope support systems, focusing on the temporary support systems used in the immediate stope face area. The interlinking of the temporary support units with mesh or safety netting has been explored in the prevention of falls of ground between support units during gravity driven falls of ground.

The Particle Flow Code in Two Dimensions (PFC 2 D) computer program was used to look at the effects of far-field shear in generating fractures around an underground opening, but these models are preliminary until boundary conditions, strengths, and stiffnesses are matched to the FLAC models. Results showed that shear zones propagated from the opposite corners of openings in directions that appeared to be determined by opening shape and far-field stress. Tensile failures also formed and extended away from these shear zones. The consistent direction of shear deformation with respect to far-field shear provides a plausible explanation for preferred directions of shear as seen in geologic environments...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine the {{ergonomic}} hazards associated with small scale mining in Southern Africa. A number of ergonomic health hazards affect the workers involved in the small scale mining. Many people in Southern Africa are working in the informal mining sector without any guarantee of occupational health and safety. Actual work places in deep level mines present unique challenges to ergonomic interventions. Due to the nature of the ore deposits, narrow gold-bearing reefs, geological constraints and the depth at which mining takes place (as much as over 3 000 m below ground level), mining layouts are primarily aimed at reducing the major cause of fatalities in the mining industry, namely <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>ground.</b> The result is that mining takes place in very restricted places with low ceiling heights and high thermal heat loads and involves a large component of physical work. Ergonomics studies the complex relationship between people, physical and psychological aspects of the work environment and aims at optimizing the comfort, health, safety and efficiency of the miner yet this has not been the case in the mining enterprises of Southern Africa. A number of ergonomic hazards are associated with the mining ventures and these include musculoskeletal disorders and the risk factors involve awkward body posture, manual material handling, repetitive motions, force and vibration. Typical ergonomics-related hazards associated with trackless mining equipment underground include restricted vision, and exposure to whole body vibration, noise and dust. The advantages of applying sound ergonomics principles in small scale mining include enhancing efficiency and eliminating significant occupational safety and health risks...|$|E

40|$|Historically, {{the highest}} rates of fatal and nonfatal injury have {{occurred}} in the mining industry. During the 85 -year period from 1911 to 1995, more than 103, 000 workers were fatally injured in mining. From 1911 through 1915 alone, 16, 646 fatalities occurred, and the annual average fatality rate exceeded 300 per 100, 000 workers. By the early 1950 s, annual fatality rates in coal mining had declined to 150 per 100, 000 workers, but rates increased prior to passage of the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969. Similarly, fatality rates in metal and nonmetal mining fell to 66 per 100, 000 workers in the early 1960 s, but rose before the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 was enacted. After passage of the two Federal mine acts, mining fatality rates decreased substantially. During the 10 -year period 1988 - 1997, 993 mine workers were fatally injured. The average annual mine operator fatality rate was 28. 5 per 100, 000 miners. Fatality rates in underground mines were higher than those in surface mines. A trend toward decreasing fatality rates with increasing mine size was observed. The types of incidents associated with the highest fatality rates were powered haulage, <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>ground</b> from in place, and machinery. The mining industry experienced 170, 635 lost-workday injury cases and 6, 840, 987 lost workdays (including restricted workdays) during 1988 - 1997. The average annual rate was 5. 5 cases per 100 full-time workers. The average number of workdays lost per case was 40. Underground mines were associated with the highest injury rates. For example, the underground areas of coal mines accounted for 65, 668 cases and an average annual rate of 11. 9 cases per 100 full-time workers. The leading types of incidents associated with lost-workday cases were handling materials, slip or fall of person, powered haulage, machinery, and hand tools. Leading types of injuries associated with lost workdays included sprains to the back region, sprains to the lower extremities (primarily the knee), amputations of the arms or hands (primarily the fingers), and fractures to the lower extremities.

40|$|Though the {{significance}} of investing in safety spending is appreciated, it is generally viewed as an expensive overhead cost. In lean economic times particularly, this mind-set places productivity first before safety. However, because of compromised safety conditions, there may be rockfalls. The consequences of rockfalls are numerous, some direct and others indirect. While these losses can be significant, {{there appear to be}} no records of evaluation of such losses on the mines. The financial evaluation of risk mitigation systems is therefore currently based only on the cost of implementing a support system and {{does not take into account}} the losses resulting from accidents or failure of the system. When a <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>ground</b> occurs in a stope the method of remediation depends largely on the size of the rockfall. Very small rockfalls will be simply cleaned up and the area made safe, larger rockfalls will require the installation of additional support, or the panel may need to be re-established in the case of the largest rockfalls. Losses are incurred as a result of dilution, re-supporting, reduced productivity and loss of sweepings. Pillars and remnants may also be left behind, which reduces the available reserves. The findings of this research suggest that the full distribution of rockfall sizes should be considered.

The research was conducted on two case study operations, AngloGold Ashanti (Mponeng Mine) and Implats (Impala Platinum 12 Shaft). On each operation the probability of occurrence of rockfalls was determined from the mine’s rockfall database and where joint data was available; a key block generating software, JBlock, was used. Extensive studies were then carried out to determine the consequences and costs of rockfall damage and as a result, a generic methodology of calculating these was developed. This methodology is presented in this dissertation. This methodology enables the calculation of risk in monetary terms, a language well understood by management.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of the geological and mining environments leads {{to a variety of}} forms of rock mass behaviour, including seismicity and <b>falls</b> <b>of</b> <b>ground.</b> A precise understanding, however, of the role of geology in rock mass behaviour experienced by Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara Aktiebolag’s (LKAB) Kiirunavaara Mine remains unknown. Since late 2008, the sublevel caving mine regularly experiences induced seismicity (Dahnér et al., 2012). Seismic events occur in the footwall, orebody, and hangingwall. Instabilities, sometimes related to specific seismic events, are unevenly distributed throughout the rock mass. Failure mechanisms of these instabilities include structurally controlled failure (sometimes as shake down), strainbursting and spalling, which are typically a result of local stress changes. Occasionally, these <b>falls</b> <b>of</b> <b>ground</b> are rockbursts; violent ejections of rock causing damage to infrastructure and/or personnel that are caused by remote seismic events. Some previous work has been done at the Kiirunavaara Mine for both specific events and specific volumes to better understand the rock mass behaviour (see e. g., Sjöberg et al., 2011, 2012). However, the causes of the uneven distribution of both seismicity and instabilities at the mine are not understood, particularly at the mine-scale. As part of a larger Ph. D. project, this study explores the role of geology in the mine-scale behaviour at the Kiirunavaara Mine. This is done through two approaches: 1) exploratory numerical stress modelling, and 2) development of a geomechanical model of the rock mass. The exploratory numerical modelling of the mine evaluated common assumptions made by researchers and consultants when completing numerical stress modelling of this orebody. A previously estimated virgin in situ stress state was applied in a 3 -D model developed of the nearly 5 km long orebody and surrounding host rock. The model had definition between footwall, ore and hangingwall materials. Run as a continuum for this analysis, the stresses from the elastic and perfectly plastic models corresponded to stresses recently measured in situ at two sites using overcoring, indicating that the estimated virgin stress state is consistent at depth. Alternating two commonly used perfectly plastic material properties for the footwall significantly influenced the location of plastic failure throughout the rock mass, including in the hangingwall. A physical alignment of plastic failure from the models and mine seismicity for the entire rock mass was not found for the individual cases. Large magnitude shear events tended to be external to plastic failure. The difficulties relating plastic failure to seismicity can be associated with a number of causes, including that the rock mass characteristics were too simplified (for example, no discontinuities were included, the only geological units included were the footwall, hangingwall and orebody, etc.) to represent the rock mass behaviour. A geomechanical model of the rock mass is needed to better understand characteristics of the rock mass, in addition to those included in the stress models, which may be of importance to behaviour. Due to a complex, heterogeneous and clay-altered rock mass, a new methodology was developed to create a geomechanical model. The methodology is based upon standard statistics, geostatistics, and an extension of previous quantitative domaining work. Clay volumes (represented by a model based on borehole data calibrated to underground mapping) correlated to the geomechanical characteristics and behaviour of the rock mass. The rock mass in the immediate vicinity of the volumes of clay alteration had lower RQD values, more random jointing, and a higher concentration <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> <b>of</b> <b>ground</b> than the surrounding rock mass. The correlation between the geomechanical model and the <b>falls</b> <b>of</b> <b>ground</b> lead {{to the development of a}} new conceptual model of some of the mine-scale rock mass behaviour, in which the clay volumes play a significant role in stress redistribution. The understanding developed through this study has laid the framework for future analysis of a more advanced and complex nature. Numerical stress analysis will be used to test the conceptual model developed and further analyze the relationship between geology and mining, with the intention of improving the understanding of the causes of rock mass behaviour. This improved understanding has the potential to aid with selection of production planning alternatives for risk mitigation, not only for the Kiirunavaara Mine, but for other highly stressed, hard rock environments.

5000|$|The {{debate over}} public {{sociology}} is having far reaching consequences {{for how many}} sociology departments teach and do sociology, with several reorienting their programs to encompass elements of public sociology. For example, the sociology department at the University of Minnesota has begun advocating for sociology to claim {{a larger role in}} public life, providing [...] "useful, accurate, and scientifically rigorous information to policy makers and community leaders". Similarly, the Department of Sociology and Anthropology at George Mason University began offering a doctoral degree in sociology in the <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> 2008, <b>grounding</b> its two specializations in Institutions and Inequalities and the Sociology of Globalization within a context of public sociological praxis.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} century coal miner safety and health has seen {{tremendous}} improvements, the fatality and injury rates continue to decrease while productivity continues to increase. Many of the hazards that plagued miners in the past, such as coal bumps, methane and coal dust explosions, ground fall accidents and health issues have been significantly reduced. The contribution of NIOSH research includes products for prevention and survival of mine fires, methane control measures, design procedure for underground coal mines, methods for excavation surface controls, methods and procedures for blasting, laser usage in underground mines and prevention of electrocution from overhead power lines that have reduced accidents and injuries in underground coal mines. Health research has produced products such as the personal dust monitor, noise abating technologies and ergonomic solutions for equipment operators. Research priorities at NIOSH are set by considering surveillance statistics, stakeholder inputs and loss control principles. Future research in coal mining is directed towards respiratory diseases, noise induced hearing loss, repetitive musculoskeletal injuries, traumatic injuries, <b>falls</b> <b>of</b> <b>ground</b> and mine disasters. The recent spate of accidents in coal mines resulted in the Miner Act of 2006 which includes a specific role for NIOSH in future mine safety research and development. The mine safety achievements in the USA reflect the commitment of industry, labour, government and research organizations to improving {{the safety of the}} mine worker...|$|R

40|$|In 2001, a {{total of}} 2, 144 coal mining {{operations}} reported employment to the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA). Coal mines comprised 14. 7 % of all mining operations. Bituminous mines comprised 92. 0 % (n= 1, 972) and anthracite mines 8. 0 % (n= 172) of coal mining operations. More than 71 % of coal mines were located in three states: Kentucky (29. 5 %), West Virginia (21. 3 %), and Pennsylvania (20. 6 %). A total of 75, 845 employees, corresponding to 80, 858 full-time equivalent (FTE) employees, were reported by coal mine operators to MSHA. This represents a 7. 2 % increase in FTE employees from 2000. Coal operators comprised 28. 8 % of all employee hours reported to MSHA. This was {{the highest percentage of}} employee hours reported among all mining sectors. Coal operator employees worked in underground operations (46. 1 %), surface production operations (42. 6 %), and preparation plants (11. 3 %). Thirty-six work-related fatalities occurred among coal operator employees in 2001, compared to 28 in 2000. Fatalities among coal operator employees accounted for 50 % of all mining fatalities in 2001. The coal operator fatality rate was 44. 5 fatalities per 100, 000 FTE employees. The underground fatality rate, where the majority of fatalities occurred (n= 31), was 83. 2 fatalities per 100, 000 FTEs. This compares to 11. 5 per 100, 000 FTEs (n= 5) for surface employees. An explosion in an underground coal mine in Alabama claimed the lives of 13 miners in 2001. There were 3, 907 nonfatal lost-time injuries among coal employees occurring at a rate of 4. 8 injuries per 100 FTE employees. These injuries resulted in 236, 451 days lost from work. The mean and median days lost from work among coal operator employees with nonfatal lost-time injuries were 60. 5 and 23. 0 days, respectively. The highest injury rate was found in underground work locations (7. 6 injuries per 100 FTE operator employees), compared to injury rates of 2. 8 and 2. 3 per 100 FTE operator employees for preparation plant and surface production locations, respectively. The most frequent type of accident for coal operator employees involved handling of materials (33. 3 %), followed by slips or falls (19. 4 %) and <b>falls</b> <b>of</b> <b>ground</b> (12. 7 %). The most severe (as measured by the median number of days lost) were associated with powered haulage (median= 29. 5), slips or falls (median= 27. 5), <b>falls</b> <b>of</b> <b>ground</b> (median= 24), machinery (median= 22), and handling of materials (median= 21). Sprains and strains were the most frequently reported nature of injury (43. 4 %). The back was the most frequently reported part of the body injured (22. 8). Roof/rock bolter occupations accounted for the greatest number and percentage of nonfatal lost-time injuries (n= 632; 22 %) in coal operator employees injured underground. In 2001, 424 cases of occupational illness were reported to MSHA for coal operator employees. The most frequently reported illness was joint, muscle, or tendon irritation or inflammation (39. 4 %). Ninety (21. 2 %) illnesses were reported as hearing loss or impairment. Seventy-five (17. 7 %) cases of coal workers' pneumoconiosis were reported in 2001...|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} few years, the Pittsburgh Research Laboratory of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) {{examined}} and characterized conditions at {{a majority of the}} underground stone mines in the United States. Observations at these mines revealed a limited degree of roof monitoring beyond visual inspection and sounding. When monitors are used, they typically require the miner to measure movement at the roof. If conditions are unstable, the mine rmay be in a hazardous situation while recording data. Based on this scenario, researchers surmised that a simple, inexpensive monitor with the capability of recording data at a distance from the mine roof would be a safer way to gain the information. Additionally, more widespread use of monitors could potentially lead to better understanding of roof movement in general. A monitor to meet this need was designed, tested, and subsequently improved as experience was gained in its 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 use at a number of underground stone mines. The Roof Monitoring Safety System (RMSS) can provide an initial indication of movement in roof beams. By understanding and measuring roof movement in underground mines, the potential for injuries and fatalities to mine workers from <b>falls</b> <b>of</b> <b>ground</b> can be reduced. Also, officials at a mine with a history of data are better prepared to make a decision on remedial actions in the event <b>of</b> <b>ground</b> <b>falls.</b> This paper will outline the evolution of the RMSS and how it {{can be used in a}} comprehensive proactive ground control safety program. Also included is a case history describing how the RMSS was used in an evaluation of the effectiveness of a mechanical impact scaling machine at an operating limestone mine...|$|R
