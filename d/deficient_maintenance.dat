40|$|Abstract. The trefoil peptide family, {{consisting}} in mammals {{of three}} members namely TFF 1, 2 and 3, plays a cytoprotective role in epithelial cells of various tissues, {{mainly in the}} digestive tract. Tff 1, Tff 2 or Tff 3 knock-out mouse models developed various kinds of gastrointestinal impairment. microRNAs {{are known to be}} novel gene regulators. We aimed to investigate the physi-ological role of such miRNAs in Tff 2 knock-out mice. Whole miRNome profiling and in silico analysis were performed for Tff 2 -KO and WT mice. Our latest data explored the role of miRNAs in the regulatory cascades and molecular processes of Tff 2 -/- mice. As much as 6 % of the Tff 2 -KO mice miRNome was significantly dys-regulated. Further in silico analysis suggests that the respective dys-regulated part of the miRNome is involved in human pathological processes, including pancreatic, colorectal and basal cell cancer. Additionally, the dys-regulated miRNome targets pathways involved in carbohy-drate metabolism and adipocytokine signaling. The latter links <b>deficient</b> caloric <b>maintenance</b> in Tff 2 and previous observation in Tff 3 -KO mice with miRNAs. In summary, our proof-of-concept study indicates that miRNAs may {{play an important role in}} the regulatory processes of the trefoil peptide family, especially in the regulation of cancer-related cascades...|$|R

On 14 February 2010 a previously healthy 49 -year-old woman presented to an emergency room with signs and symptoms of pneumonia, 2  days after returning from a spa holiday in a wellness hotel. Blood cultures and respiratory specimens grew P. aeruginosa. Despite adequate antimicrobial therapy, the patient died of septic multiorgan failure on day nine of hospitalization. On February 26, nine water samples were taken from the hotel facilities used by the patient: In the hot tub sample 37, 000 colony-forming units of P. aeruginosa/ 100  ml were detected. Two of five individual colonies from the primary plate used for this hot tub water sample were found to be genetically closely related to the patients’ isolates. Results from PFGE, AFLP and MLST analysis allowed the two lung isolates gained at autopsy and the whirlpool bathtub isolates to be allocated into one cluster. The patient most likely acquired P. aeruginosa from the contaminated water in the hotel’s hot tub. The detection of P. aeruginosa in high numbers in a hot tub indicates massive biofilm formation in the bath circulation and severe deficiencies in hygienic maintenance.

25|$|Prior to the 1990s reform, the Dominican {{power sector}} {{was in the}} hands of the state-owned, vertically-integrated Corporación Dominicana de Electricidad (CDE). The {{operation}} of the company was characterized by large energy losses, poor bill collection and <b>deficient</b> operation and <b>maintenance.</b> During the 1990s, the rapid growth in the power sector mirrored the high economic growth experienced by the country. Total electricity demand increased at an annual rate of 7.5% in the years 1992-2001, while annual GDP growth was 5.9%. Generation capacity was not enough to meet peak demand, which translated into continuous supply constrains and widespread blackouts lasting up to 20 hours. In the mid-1990s, in order to address generation capacity shortages, several Independent Power Producers (IPPs) where encouraged by the government to sign Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with the CDE. The result of these deals, often nontransparent and negotiated, was high electricity prices.|$|R

Besides, only the large-size farms are prepared for performing a detailed analysis of working capacity, product quality and losses; data of great value when trying to quantitatively address the incorporation of machinery. The fact that grape harvest in South America (and South Africa) be complementary in season compared to Europe, or North America, makes this potential market of Brazil an interesting option for European manufacturers. In this work, we have supervised a whole grape harvest season, in a 552 ha farm, where both, mechanical (trailed) and manual harvest, are performed. Harvest performance is assessed by means of digital field notebooks and using georeferenced data (DGPS). A large variety of incidences have been found for the mechanized procedure due mainly to a <b>deficient</b> <b>maintenance</b> of the equipment, being reflected in a clearly reduction of the work capacity.

40|$|Cooling towers, {{because of}} their seeming simplicity, are usually orphans of the {{facilities}} operation. We are all aware that cooling towers are the step-children of the chemical process plant, electric power generating station, and refrigeration system. While engineers are pretty well convinced {{of the importance of}} their sophisticated equipment, and rightly so, they take the cooling towers and the cold water returning from them for granted. Design Conditions are specified for the particular requirements before a cooling tower is purchased. This relates to the volume of circulating water, hot water temperature on the tower, cold water discharge, and wet bulb temperature (consisting of ambient temperature and relative humidity). After the tower is put on the line and the cold water temperature or volume becomes inadequate, engineers look to solutions other than the obvious. While all cooling towers are purchased to function at 100 % of capability in accordance with the required Design Conditions, in actual on-stream employment, the level of operation many times is lower, downwards to as much as 50 % due to a variety of reasons: 1. The present service needed is now greater than the original requirements which the tower was purchased for. 2. ?Slippage? due to usage and perhaps <b>deficient</b> <b>maintenance</b> has reduced the performance of the tower over years of operation. 3.

To investigate the molecular mechanisms of centrosome-dependent cell cycle progress, we performed RNA silencing experiments of two centrosome-associated proteins, pericentriolar material 1 (PCM- 1) and pericentrin, in primary human fibroblasts.

Also, the percentage of cells undergoing DNA replication was reduced by > 50 %. At the same time, levels of p 53 and p 21 increased in these cells, and cells were predisposed to undergo senescence.

Configuration management database (CMDB) is the core of whole ITSM system by providing information to support all ITSM processes. Therefore, sound ITSM depends on a well-built CMDB.

Understanding the benefits and cost factors of CMDB can help in not only reaching cost justifications but can also provide helpful guidance for CMDB design. However, there is no research, which systematically examines these factors. This paper presents the results of a comprehensive literature review of cost and benefit factors for implementing CMDBs. Moreover, case studies on three organizations were performed to find how enterprises realize these factors. The outcome of this study is expected to provide a good reference for enterprises to plan a CMDB.

40|$|The murine hsp 70 {{gene family}} {{includes}} the evolutionarily conserved hsp 70. 1 and hsp 70. 3 genes, {{which are the}} major proteins induced by heat and other stress stimuli. hsp 70. 1 and hsp 70. 3 encode identical proteins which protect cells and facilitate their recovery from stress-induced damage. While the hsp 70 gene family has been widely studied and {{the roles of the}} proteins it encodes as molecular chaperones in a range of human pathologies are appreciated, {{little is known about the}} developmental regulation of hsp 70. 1 and hsp 70. 3 expression and the in vivo biological function of their products. To directly study the physiological role of these proteins in vivo, we have generated mice deficient in heat shock protein 70 (hsp 70) by replacing the hsp 70. 1 or hsp 70. 3 gene with an in-frame β-galactosidase sequence. We report here that the expression of hsp 70. 1 and hsp 70. 3 is developmentally regulated at the transcriptional level, and an overlapping expression pattern for both genes is observed during embryo development and in the tissues of adult mice. hsp 70. 1 −/− or hsp 70. 3 −/− mice are viable and fertile, with no obvious morphological abnormalities. In late embryonic stage and adult mice, both genes are expressed constitutively in tissues exposed directly to the environment (the epidermis and cornea) and in certain internal organs (the epithelium of the tongue, esophagus, and forestomach, and the kidney, bladder, and hippocampus). Exposure of mice to thermal stress results in the rapid induction and expression of hsp 70, especially in organs not constitutively expressing hsp 70 (the liver, pancreas, heart, lung, adrenal cortex, and intestine). Despite functional compensation in the single-gene-deficient mice by the intact homologous gene (i. e., hsp 70. 3 in hsp 70. 1 −/− mice and vice versa), a marked reduction in hsp 70 protein expression was observed in tissues under both normal and heat stress conditions. At the cellular level, inactivation of hsp 70. 1 or hsp 70. 3 resulted in <b>deficient</b> <b>maintenance</b> of acquired thermotolerance and increased sensitivity to heat stress-induced apoptosis.

40|$|Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated {{herpesvirus}} (KSHV) latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) is a 1, 162 -amino-acid {{protein that}} mediates {{the maintenance of}} episomal viral genomes in latently infected cells. The two central components of episome persis-tence are DNA replication with each cell division and the segregation of DNA to progeny nuclei. LANA self-associates to bind KSHV terminal-repeat (TR) DNA and to mediate its replication. LANA also simultaneously binds to TR DNA and mitotic chro-mosomes to mediate the segregation of episomes to daughter nuclei. The N-terminal region of LANA binds histones H 2 A and H 2 B to attach to mitotic chromosomes, while the C-terminal region binds TR DNA and also associates with chromosomes. Both the N- and C-terminal regions of LANA are essential for episome persistence. We recently showed that deletion of all internal LANA sequences results in highly <b>deficient</b> episome <b>maintenance.</b> Here we assess independent internal LANA regions for effects on episome persistence. We generated a panel of LANA mutants that included deletions in the large internal repeat region and in the unique internal sequence. All mutants contained the essential N- and C-terminal regions, and as expected, all maintained the ability to associate with mitotic chromosomes in a wild-type fashion and to bind TR DNA, as assessed by electrophoretic mobil-ity shift assays (EMSA). Deletion of the internal regions did not reduce the half-life of LANA. Notably, deletions within either the repeat elements or the unique sequence resulted in deficiencies in DNA replication. However, only the unique internal sequence exerted effects {{on the ability of}} LANA to retain green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression from TR-containing episomes defi-cient in DNA replication, consistent with a role in episome segregation; this region did not independently associate with mitoti...|$|R
40|$|B cells express {{complement}} receptors (CRs) {{that bind}} activated fragments of C 3 and C 4. Immunized CR knockout (KO) mice have lower antibody titers and smaller germinal centers (GCs), demonstrating {{the importance of}} CR signals for the humoral immune response. CR ligands {{were thought to be}} generated via complement fixation mediated by preexisting “natural” IgM or early Ab from inefficiently activated B cells. This concept was recently challenged by a transgenic (Tg) mouse model that lacks circulating antibody but still retains membrane IgM (mIgM) and mounts normal immune responses. To test whether CR ligands could be generated by the B cell receptor (BCR) itself, we generated similar mice carrying a mutated mIgM that was defective in C 1 q binding. We found that B cells from such mutant mice do not deposit C 3 on B cells upon BCR ligation, in contrast to B cells from mIgM mice. This has implications for the immune response: the mutant mice have smaller GCs than mIgM mice, and they are particularly <b>deficient</b> in the <b>maintenance</b> of the GC response. These results demonstrate a new BCR-dependent pathway that is sufficient and perhaps necessary to provide a CR 1 / 2 ligand that promotes efficient B cell activation.

We show that at semipermissive temperatures, a yeast strain with a cdc 28 - 1 N allele was uniquely <b>deficient</b> in plasmid <b>maintenance</b> in comparison with strains harboring other cdc 28 thermolabile alleles. Quantitative analysis of plasmid loss rates in cdc 28 - 1 N strains carrying plasmids with multiple replication origins suggests that a defect in initiating DNA replication probably causes this plasmid loss phenotype. The ZDS 1 gene was isolated as a multicopy suppressor of the cdc 28 - 1 N plasmid loss defect. A zds 1 deletion exhibits genetic interactions with cdc 28 - 1 N but not with other cdc 28 alleles. SIN 4 encodes a protein {{which is part of}} the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme-mediator complex, and a sin 4 null mutation has pleiotropic effects suggesting roles in transcriptional regulation and chromatin structure. The ZDS 2 gene was isolated as a multicopy suppressor of the temperature-sensitive growth defect caused by the sin 4 null mutation. Disruption of either ZDS 1 or ZDS 2 causes only modest phenotypes.

A reduction in visual short-term memory (vSTM) storage capacity was recently suggested as a potential neuro-cognitive endophenotype, i. e., a testable marker of an individual's liability for developing ADHD. This study aimed at identifying markers of the brain abnormalities underlying vSTM reductions in adult ADHD. We combined behavioral parameter-based assessment with electrophysiology in groups of adult ADHD patients and healthy age-matched controls. Amplitudes of ERP markers of vSTM storage capacity, the contralateral delay activity (CDA) and the P 3 b, were analyzed according to (i) differences between individuals with higher vs. lower storage capacity K and (ii) differences between ADHD patients and control participants. We replicated the finding of reduced storage capacity in adult ADHD. Across groups, individuals with higher relative to lower storage capacity showed a larger CDA and P 3 b. We further found differences between the patient and control groups in the ERPs: The CDA amplitude was attenuated in an early time window for ADHD patients compared to control participants, and was negatively correlated with ADHD patients' symptom severity ratings. Furthermore, the P 3 b was larger in ADHD patients relative to control participants. These electrophysiological findings indicate altered brain mechanisms underlying visual storage capacity in ADHD, which are characterized by <b>deficient</b> encoding and <b>maintenance,</b> and increased recruitment of control processes. Accordingly, (quantifiable) ERP markers of vSTM in adult ADHD bear candidacy as neuro-cognitive endophenotypes of the disease...|$|R
40|$|DNA {{methylation}} marks regulate {{gene expression}} and genome structure. Stability and dynamics of DNA methylation patterns {{are influenced by}} four major factors including de novo methylation, maintenance methylation, passive loss of methylation and active demethylation. Maintenance methylation functions are still well conserved among plants and animals, which separated more than 1. 5 billion years ago. In contrast, demethylation mechanisms differ considerably among plants and mammals. Interfering with DNA methylation and demethylation systems could {{be a source of}} heritable epigenetic variation if DNA methylation changes are introduced that transcend into stable heritable gene expression changes. The high tolerance of plants to DNA methylation changes makes them an ideal experimental system to exploit DNA methylation and demethylation systems. In this study, four strategies have been developed and tested for their capacity to induce heritable epigenetic variation by interfering with DNA methylation and demethylation systems. These strategies included a chemical treatment with a DNA methylation inhibitor, genetic demethylation using a mutant <b>deficient</b> in the <b>maintenance</b> methyltransferase MET 1 and transgenic approaches to over-express MET 1 and to express the human TET 3 demethylase. While chemical demethylation only generated non-heritable changes, inactivating MET 1 induced stable DNA methylation and expression changes at specific loci. Expression of the human TET 3 protein also induced locus-specific loss of methylation but the efficiency of demethylation varied in individual transformants independent of TET 3 level, which suggests that demethylation is locus-specific but stochastic...|$|R
40|$|Cancer of {{the breast}} {{is the most common}} form of {{malignant}} disease occurring among women of the western world and environmental substances seem to be involved in the etiology of this disease. Many studies have found an association between human cancer and exposure to agricultural pesticides and among them parathion, the organophosphorous pesticide used in agriculture to control mosquito plagues. The association between breast cancer and prolonged exposure to estrogens suggests that this hormone also may have a role in such process. However, the causative factors for breast carcinogenesis remain an enigma. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of 17 β-estradiol (E 2) and parathion on cell transformation of human breast epithelial cells in vitro. The results of this study showed that parathion alone and in combination with E 2 induced malignant transformation of an immortalized human breast epithelial cell line, MCF- 10 F, and the malignant feature was confirmed by anchorage independency and invasive capabilities. Parathion alone efficiently elevated the expression of EGFR, c-Kit, Trio, Rac 3, Rho-A, and mutant p 53 proteins. Analysis of gene expression using commercially available human cell cycle array revealed transcriptional alterations in 22 out of a total of 96 genes.

One of the indispensable components in any irrigation exercise in order to improve the irrigation systems is evaluation activity. In the present study, nine different sprinkler irrigation systems i. e., the solid set system and wheel move systems in the Arak agricultural area, Iran were selected, tested and evaluated. Values of Coefficient Uniformity (CU), Distribution Uniformity (DU), Potential Efficiency of Water Application (PELQ), Actual Potential Efficiency of Water Application (AELQ) and maximum pressure difference (ΔPmax) in solid set systems are 76. 16, 64. 53, 55. 56, 51. 48 and 45. 23 %, respectively and for wheel move systems are 82. 86, 76. 02, 67, 67 and 29 %, respectively. Average losses due to wind and deep percolation values were determined as 12. 78 and 32. 83 %, respectively for solid set systems and 12. 22 and 2. 53 %, respectively for wheel move systems. In solid set systems all of parameters failed to meet the expected values, however wheel move systems showed a better performance with mild wind. In general, it can be claimed that the main problems of sprinkler irrigation systems are deficient design and implementation, low distribution uniformity, low water pressure, deficient distribution of pressure, insufficient lengths of lateral pipelines in addition to poor quality equipment utilized and <b>deficient</b> management and <b>maintenance</b> processes...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} {{dissertation}} we addressed neuronal changes in PTSD using an activationbasedand a resting state-based approach {{with a special}} focus on brain areas involved in abnormal activation in PTSD such as amygdala, hippocampus, ventromedial prefrontalcortex (vmPFC), dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and insula. Our attention was directed to the mechanisms mediating increased return of fear and the association of PTSD symptoms with aberrant brain activity as well as aberrant resting state connectivity. In both studies we compared PTSD patients with trauma-exposed but unaffected controls (non-PTSD) and trauma-naïve healthy controls (HC). In the first study, subjects underwent an ABC fear conditioning and extinction procedure, where two CSs were presented in front of virtual reality scenes. One of them (CS+) was paired with a slightly painful electrical stimulation (US) during acquisition, whereas {{the other one was}} never paired with the US (CS-). During extinction, there were no CS-US pairings. After acquisition (context A) and extinction (context B), the participants were brought to a novel context C and again confronted with the CSs. Selfreports, skin conductance responses (SCR) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) were measured simultaneously. We found elevated return of fear in the PTSD patients indicated by larger differential SCR compared to non-PTSD and HC and larger differential amygdala and hippocampus activity compared to HC. Increased amygdala activation was positively correlated with numbing and vmPFC activity was positively correlated with behavioral avoidance even though there were no functional group differences in this region of interest. Additionally, PTSD patients failed to appropriately reduce subjective arousal to the CS- {{over the course of the}} experiment and to the CS+ during extinction. Taken together, the results of study 1 support the hypothesis that PTSD is characterized by aberrant activity within regions of the neurocircuitry model, which leads to <b>deficient</b> extinction <b>maintenance.</b> Furthermore, our data confirm a general inability of PTSD patients to correctly identify safety signals and modulate fear responses based on this information. Such dysfunctional mechanisms seem to contribute to PTSD symptoms and represent a probable cause for relapse, whereas resilient subjects appear to benefit from protective mechanisms. In the second study, subjects underwent a resting state scan and functional connectivity was analyzed using an amygdala seed and independent component analysis (ICA) as well as correlations with symptom severity. The seed-based approach revealed increased left amygdala – the left insula coupling in PTSD versus nonPTSD, which positively correlated with re-experiencing intensity. Compared to HC, both trauma experienced groups showed higher positive correlations of the left amygdala and the right putamen as well as the right insula. The ICA did not reveal any group differences, i. e. in DMN connectivity. In summary, study 2 indicates that altered amygdala-insula coupling and decreased amygdala-putamen coupling, but not DMN connectivity, contribute to the pathophysiology of PTSD. Hyperconnectivity between the left amygdala and the left insula differentiated patients from resilient subjects and was linked to re-experiencing intensity. This result suggests that a stronger functional link between somatic sensations and emotional appraisal might lead to increased anticipation of negative events in PTSD, which potentially explains characteristic symptoms such as hyperarousal and negative alterations in mood and cognition...|$|R

Thirty steers (229 kg and 2. 6 years) were randomly assigned to a complete block design of 3 treatments (0,. 5 and 1. 0 kg of CSM per steer per day). After hand-feeding CSM to individual steers in the mornings, all were allowed to free grazing a pasture dominated by Andropogon spp. Every month, 2 steers per treatment were brought into digestion crates and ad lib. fed hand-clipped forage of similar botanical composition as that grazed by the remaining steers. Feeding CSM increased crude protein absorbed (CPA), rumen turn over rate (k[subscript] 2) and ADG. Forage intake was increased only with. 5 kg CSM. Forage and cell wall digestibility tended to be decreased with 1. 0 kg of CSM compared with. 5 kg or none. Dry season supplementation increased FDMI and k[subscript] 2, but had no effect on cell wall digestibility, FDMD, CPA and ADG during the rainy season. Data from this study suggest that. 5 kg of CSM can increase FDMI, k 2, and ADG of cattle during the dry season and that improvement can be maintained during the rainy season;These data and information from the literature were developed into a simulation model to estimate the energy and protein requirements for maintenance and to predict when feeding supplements to steers was economically beneficial. The simulation indicated that energy from FDMI seemed adequate for maintenance or moderate weight gain, while protein was <b>deficient</b> to meet <b>maintenance</b> requirement of grazing steers during the dry season. Consequently, protein or nitrogen supplementation was required to prevent weight loss. The model also indicated that cattle could respond to modest amounts of urea (50 to 60 g of urea daily) whenever forage CP was below 10 %. The use of the lowest estimates of ADG by the metabolizable protein or the net energy system predicted when weight loss or gain of steers occurred...|$|R
40|$|The {{discovery}} of epigenetic mechanisms has ignited speculation into {{their role in}} ecological and evolutionary processes. In particular, the contribution of epigenetic variation to adaptation or phenotypic plasticity that is distinct from genetic variation would be an important addition to existing evolutionary mechanisms. Although the research of epigenetic mechanisms from an ecological and evolutionary (or eco-evolutionary) perspective has been growing, it is still unclear how epigenetic variation might function in natural populations and settings {{and to what extent}} it might serve to mediate population response to changing environmental conditions over time. Over the course of my dissertation, I explored the importance of DNA methylation in population response to a variety of environmental conditions. In the first chapter of my dissertation, I reviewed existing literature on the relationship between DNA methylation and environmental response. I argued that given the weight of current evidence, DNA methylation, in addition to other epigenetic mechanisms, needs to be included the evolutionary synthesis. Additionally, I identified a number of outstanding questions and outlined research directions that would help elucidate the role of epigenetic mechanisms in evolution. In my second chapter, I studied the genetic and epigenetic composition of populations of Spartina alterniflora that were impacted by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010. Current evolutionary theory predicts that following a severe environmental stressor, populations may experience a bottleneck effect, in which one or only a few genotypes survive to reproduce in subsequent generations. However, it is unclear whether these patterns are reflected in epigenetic variation as well, because novel environmental perturbations may serve to induce epigenetic variation rather than diminish it. We found a significant genetic signature of oil exposure in exposed populations, but did not see a similar effect in the epigenetic composition of exposed populations. These data suggest that epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, may not always increase in number during stressful episodes, but may instead follow genetic variation. These results provide valuable information for the development of nascent population epigenetic theory, and may help parameterize expectations about conditions that provoke epigenetic variation, particularly when genetic variation may be limited. In addition to strong, unpredictable stressors, populations also respond via phenotypic changes over time through developmental stages and life histories that coincide with seasonal, regular environmental cues. Epigenetic mechanisms influence these regulatory and developmental changes that occur within an individual over time. In my third chapter, I examined the epigenetic response to seasonality in multiple coastal plant species. We found a weak signature of single methylation polymorphisms that was associated with seasonal environmental change within the studied species, as well as global patterns of methylation that were consistent across species. The results of this study indicate the possibility of conservation of methylation patterns across phylogenetic histories. In my fourth chapter, I explored in detail how the ability to maintain methylation might affect stress response. We compared individuals of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana that were <b>deficient</b> in <b>maintenance</b> methylation machinery to control genotypes under both abiotic and biotic stresses, and then studied the growth of their offspring in the absence of stress. We found inherited phenotypic signatures of parental stress in the offspring generation and interactive effects of parental stress and genotype. This study not only reinforces the correlations that we observed in our field studies, but adds to the growing body of literature highlighting the importance of DNA methylation both in immediate environmental response and as a mechanism for heritability. Overall, this dissertation demonstrates that DNA methylation is highly abundant in natural populations and may be part of the response to various stressors at a number of time scales. The integration of DNA methylation in the evolutionary synthesis will aid in the explanation of phenomena such as phenotypic plasticity or adaptation, and will be an important contribution to the existing body of evolutionary mechanisms...|$|R
