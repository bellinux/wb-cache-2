500|$|The {{fighting}} {{was focused on}} Munster; Máel Sechnaill sought to increase his influence over the kings there. He took hostages from the province in 854, 856 and 858, {{and the power of}} the over-kings had been weakened in 856 by a Viking raid on the royal centre at Lough Cend, when Gormán son of Lonán, a relative of Munster's over-king, was killed alongside a great many others. This weakness likely drew the gaze of both Máel Sechnaill and the Vikings, and their competition for Munster's resources may have been the cause of the war. Early battles seem to have <b>gone</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> of the Vikings: Amlaíb and Ímar [...] "inflicted a rout on Caitill the Fair and his Norse-Irish in the lands of Munster". Although there is no certain evidence to suggest that this Caitill is the same person as the Ketill Flatnose of later sagas, Anderson and Crawford have suggested that they are the same person.|$|E

[...] The Simpsons showrunner Mike Scully also noted that future Bart is {{the kind of person who}} is [...] "always waiting for some big sort of cash payoff that he feels he's owed whether it be an insurance settlement, an inheritance, or something that's gonna come sooner or later."

If you used the word 'Palestinian' in any public place when I first arrived in New York in the early 1970s you risked being punched in the face."

He {{went as far as}} taking a critical stance on hate speech legislation and wrote in 2009 [...] "America is {{well on its way to}} making it illegal to say anything nasty about gays, Jews, blacks and women. “Hate speech,” far short of any direct incitement to violence, is on the edge of being criminalized, with the First Amendment <b>gone</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> of the dodo." ...|$|E

[...] O'Donnell previously had remarked, [...] "I don't personally own a gun, but if you are qualified, licensed and registered, I have no problem." [...] In May 1999, a month after the Columbine shootings, O'Donnell interviewed Tom Selleck, who was promoting The Love Letter. O'Donnell confronted him about his recent commercial for the National Rifle Association (NRA) and challenged him about the NRA's position on the use of [...] "assault weapons." [...] She said {{at the end of the}} segment the conversation had [...] "not <b>gone</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> I had hoped" [...] and added [...] "if you feel insulted by my questions, I apologize because it was not a personal attack. It was meant to bring up the subject as it is in the consciousness of so many today." [...] Around the same time, the cast from Annie Get Your Gun was to appear on the show but refused O'Donnell's request to remove the line [...] "I can shoot a partridge with a single cartridge" [...] from the song [...] "Anything You Can Do" [...] and agreed to perform [...] "My Defenses Are Down" [...] instead.|$|E
2500|$|There was a {{large number}} of benefactions from lay landowners and these often came with {{requests}} to be buried or prayed for at Lilleshall or for membership of the fraternity of the abbey. Late in the 12th century, for example, John Lestrange, a local baron with holdings further afield, got into a dispute with Ramsey Abbey over the church at [...] Holme-next-the-Sea in Norfolk. In a settlement acceptable to all, he gave the church to Lilleshall Abbey, for the health of his own and his wife's souls. Shortly afterwards he added the church at Shangton in Leicestershire, adding specifically “the body of his wife Amicia when she shall have <b>gone</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> of all flesh.” Similarly, Robert de Kayley gave the abbey two thirds of his land at Freasley, in Dordon, Warwickshire, on condition that it accept his body for burial. This suggests that its monastic life quickly built up a reputation for holiness that could be acquired by proximity, and one that clearly persisted into the later Middle Ages. John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, spent two days at the abbey, together with his wife Katherine Swynford and a large retinue. He had fallen ill after the 24th parliament of Richard II's reign was held at Shrewsbury, dissolving on 31 January 1398. Gaunt himself, his wife, and his squire, William Chetwynd, were received into the fraternity, and Gaunt made a gift of twenty pounds of gold.|$|E

2500|$|Even {{before the}} ITF had {{announced}} their bonus, the Grand Slam controversy {{had taken on}} a life of its own. [...] Writing in 1982, Neil Amdur claimed, [...] "Now the sport spins nervously under the influence of big dollars and even bigger egos, and tradition has almost <b>gone</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> of white balls and long flannels [...] If the four major tournaments want to offer a $1 million incentive for any player in the future who can sweep their titles—and such talks have been rumored—that bonus would be a welcome addition. But changing what the Grand Slam is all about is like a baseball player believing that he 'hit for the cycle' after slugging a single, double and triple in the first game of a doubleheader and a home run in his first time at bat in the second game." [...] Despite seeming clarity from the ITF, some journalists suggested that the sport's organizing body had turned its back on history and changed the [...] "rules" [...] of tennis by redefining a Grand Slam. [...] Such confusion continued for years. [...] For instance, when Steffi Graf completed the Grand Slam in 1988, George Vecsey wrote, [...] "Even the International Tennis Federation, which should have more respect for history, ruled in 1982 that winning any four straight majors constituted a Grand Slam—and offered a $1 million bonus for it [...] But many tennis people, and most writers, and probably most fans, too, did not accept the new rules, and the I.T.F. has dropped the gimmick." [...] Vecsey was only half right: the ITF dropped the [...] "gimmick" [...] of the cash bonus, but it had never changed any rules.|$|E
2500|$|The {{crossword puzzle}} fad {{received}} extensive attention, {{not all of}} it positive: In 1924, The New York Times complained of the [...] "sinful waste in the utterly futile finding of words the letters of which will fit into a prearranged pattern, more or less complex. This is not a game at all, and it hardly can be called a sport... get nothing out of it except a primitive form of mental exercise, and success or failure in any given attempt is equally irrelevant to mental development." [...] A clergyman called the working of crossword puzzles [...] "the mark of a childish mentality" [...] and said, [...] "There is no use for persons to pretend that working one of the puzzles carries any intellectual value with it.". However, another wrote a complete [...] "Bible Cross-Word Puzzle Book". Also in 1925, Time Magazine noted that nine Manhattan dailies and fourteen other big newspapers were carrying crosswords, and quoted opposing views as to whether [...] "This crossword craze will positively end by June!" [...] or [...] "The crossword puzzle is here to stay!" [...] In 1925, The New York Times noted, with approval, a scathing critique of crosswords by The New Republic; but concluded that [...] "Fortunately, {{the question of whether the}} puzzles are beneficial or harmful is in no urgent need of an answer. The craze evidently is dying out fast and in a few months it will be forgotten." [...] and in 1929 declared, [...] "The cross-word puzzle, it seems, has <b>gone</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> of all fads...." [...] In 1930, a correspondent noted that [...] "Together with The Times of London, yours is the only journal of prominence that has never succumbed to the lure of the cross-word puzzle" [...] and said that [...] "The craze—the fad—stage has passed, but there are still people numbering it to the millions who look for their daily cross-word puzzle as regularly as for the weather predictions." [...] The New York Times, however, was not to publish a crossword puzzle until 1942; today, the Times puzzle is one of the most popular in the country.|$|E
