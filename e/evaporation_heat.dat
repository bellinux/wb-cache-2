2500|$|In {{addition}} to its use in photosynthesis, a vine's water supply is also depleted by the processes of evaporation and transpiration. In <b>evaporation,</b> <b>heat</b> (aided by wind and sunlight) causes water in the soil to evaporate and escape as vapor molecules. This process is inversely related to humidity with evaporation taking place at faster rates in areas with low relative humidity. In transpiration, this evaporation of water occurs directly in the vine, as water is released from the plant through the stomata that are located on the undersides of the leaves. This loss {{of water from the}} leaves is one of the driving factors that results in water being drawn up from the roots, and it also helps the vine combat against the effects of heat stress which can severely damage the physiological functions of the vine (somewhat similar to how perspiration works with humans and animals). The presence of adequate water in the vines can help keep the internal temperature of the leaf only a few degrees above the temperature of the surrounding air. However, if water is severely lacking then that internal temperature could jump nearly 18°F (10°C) warmer than the surrounding air which leads the vine to develop heat stress. The dual effects of evaporation and transpiration are called evapotranspiration. A typical vineyard in a hot, dry climate can lose as much as [...] of water per vine through evapotranspiration during the growing season.|$|E

50|$|Latent heat loss, {{also known}} as {{evaporative}} heat loss, accounts for a large fraction of heat loss from the body. When the core temperature of the body increases, the body triggers sweat glands in the skin to bring additional moisture {{to the surface of}} the skin. The liquid is then transformed into vapor which removes heat from the surface of the body. The rate of <b>evaporation</b> <b>heat</b> loss is directly related to the vapor pressure at the skin surface and the amount of moisture present on the skin. Therefore, the maximum of heat transfer will occur when the skin is completely wet. The body continuously loses water by evaporation but the most significant amount of heat loss occurs during periods of increased physical activity.|$|E

50|$|The {{human body}} dissipates heat through {{perspiration}} and its <b>evaporation.</b> <b>Heat</b> convection, {{to the surrounding}} air, and thermal radiation are the primary modes of heat transport from the body. Under conditions of high humidity, {{the rate of evaporation}} of sweat from the skin decreases. Also, if the atmosphere is as warm as or warmer than the skin during times of high humidity, blood brought to the body surface cannot dissipate heat by conduction to the air, and a condition called hyperthermia results. With so much blood going to the external surface of the body, less goes to the active muscles, the brain, and other internal organs. Physical strength declines, and fatigue occurs sooner than it would otherwise. Alertness and mental capacity also may be affected, resulting in heat stroke or hyperthermia.|$|E
50|$|Steam {{turbines}} for cogeneration {{are designed}} for extraction of steam at lower pressures after it has passed {{through a number of}} turbine stages, or they may be designed for final exhaust at back pressure (non-condensing), or both. A typical power generation turbine in a paper mill may have extraction pressures of 160 psig (1.103 MPa) and 60 psig (0.41 MPa). A typical back pressure may be 60 psig (0.41 MPa). In practice these pressures are custom designed for each facility. The extracted or exhaust steam is used for process heating, such as drying paper, <b>evaporation,</b> <b>heat</b> for chemical reactions or distillation. Steam at ordinary process heating conditions still has a considerable amount of enthalpy {{that could be used for}} power generation, so cogeneration has an opportunity cost. Conversely, simply generating steam at process pressure instead of high enough pressure to generate power at the top end also has an opportunity cost. (See: Steam turbine#Steam supply and exhaust conditions) The capital and operating cost of high pressure boilers, turbines and generators are substantial, and this equipment is normally operated continuously, which usually limits self-generated power to large-scale operations.|$|E
