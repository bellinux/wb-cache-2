All crew members have individual access to management computers and tactical information.|$|E
5|$|Madgwick officially {{took office}} on 1 July 1967. As chairman, Madgwick took a {{somewhat}} <b>hands-off</b> approach to directing the organisation, preferring to provide his opinion {{as to how}} things should operate, then deferring to his administrators {{to decide what to}} do. Madgwick considered his position as similar to a university president, with managers and producers equivalent to professors and researchers. He bought a home in Mosman to be closer to the ABC's main Broadcast House in Sydney. Madgwick tried to make himself available by walking around the offices and facilities and amiably conversing with all ABC employees. He was subsequently described as the most popular chairman {{in the history of the}} organisation. Madgwick was given a second term as chairman in 1970.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{was less}} {{involved}} with the legislative process than previous governors. For example, he {{did not attempt to}} influence the choice of legislative leadership, while most previous governors had practically hand-selected the presiding officers in each house. During one of the two legislative sessions of his term, he went on vacation. Consequently, many of his legislative recommendations were not enacted. Among his failed proposals were a multi-county banking law, a flat rate income tax, professional negotiations for teachers, and a constitutional amendment to allow a governor to be elected to successive terms. In all, Brown was out of the state – leaving Lieutenant Governor Martha Layne Collins as acting governor – for more than five hundred days during his four-year term. As noted by Kentucky historian Lowell H. Harrison, Brown's <b>hands-off</b> approach allowed the legislature to gain power relative to the governor {{for the first time in}} Kentucky history, a trend which continued into the terms of his successors.|$|E
5|$|Donen briefly {{returned}} to the musical genre in 1958 with Damn Yankees!, based on George Abbott's Broadway hit. He again co-directed with Abbott in the same <b>hands-off</b> collaboration as their first film. Like The Pajama Game the film includes music by Adler and Ross and choreography by Fosse. It starred Tab Hunter, Gwen Verdon, and Ray Walston. Damn Yankees! is an adaptation of the Faust legend about {{a fan of the}} baseball team the Washington Senators who mentions that he would sell his soul to give the losing team a good hitter. Walston plays the Brooks Brothers-attired Devil who grants the fan his wish and transforms him into the muscular young hitter Joe Hardy (Hunter). Donen was able to shoot three real Senator-Yankee games on location with as many as seven hidden cameras. The low-budget film was a moderate financial success and received good reviews. It was also Donen's last musical film for many years.|$|E
5|$|These films {{took many}} liberties {{from the book}} series casting-wise. Red-haired Granville's {{portrayal}} of the then-blonde Nancy was portrayed to be ditzy, absent-minded, and more meddling that that of the ongoing book series. While the Carson Drew of the books was portrayed as older, feeble, {{and more of a}} <b>hands-off</b> parent, John Litel's Carson was young and handsome, much more athletically fit, and tried his best to restrain Nancy from getting into danger. Ned/Ted was even more drastically altered: instead of being Nancy's boyfriend in college who lives in a different town, he was now her next-door neighbor, who was a year older than her and their romance was very ambiguous and tumultuous. The recurring character of the older Hannah Gruen was replaced with Effie Schneider, a minor character in the books who was Hannah's teenage niece. Effie and Hannah's characteristics were merged, although Effie's fidgety, frightful nature retained prominence for comedic effect. In addition to these four, a new character Captain Tweedy was added, to portray the stereotypical bumbling, clueless cop that mirrored Steve McBride in the Torchy Blane series. Nancy's friends Bess and George did not appear in the film series, and never mentioned or referred to.|$|E
5|$|James {{has been}} the {{recipient}} of numerous endorsement contracts; some of the companies he does business with are Audemars Piguet, Coca-Cola, Dunkin' Brands, McDonald's, Nike, State Farm, and Samsung. Coming out of high school, he {{was the target of}} a three-way bidding war among Nike, Reebok, and Adidas, eventually signing with Nike for approximately $90 million. His signature shoes have performed well for Nike. In 2011, Fenway Sports Group became the sole global marketer of his rights, and as part of the deal, he was granted a minority stake in the English Premier League football club Liverpool FC, who he has claimed his support for. As a result of James' endorsement money and NBA salary, he has been listed as one of the world's highest-paid athletes. In 2013, he surpassed Kobe Bryant as the highest paid basketball player in the world, with earnings of $56.5 million. In 2014, James realized a profit of more than $30 million as part of Apple's acquisition of Beats Electronics; he had originally struck a deal to get a small stake in the company at its inception in exchange for promoting its headphones. In 2015, he was ranked the sixth highest earning sportsperson, and third highest in 2016 (after Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi). James has stated that we would like to own an NBA team in the future, albeit in a <b>hands-off</b> capacity.|$|E

25|$|His {{style of}} {{leadership}} has given him {{the image of a}} seemingly aloof, withdrawn technocrat or intellectual and has made him seem {{out of touch with the}} street, and his seemingly <b>hands-off</b> leadership-by-delegation style made his governments, especially at cabinet level, seem dysfunctional.|$|E
25|$|Producer Sammo Hung {{visited the}} set less {{frequently}} {{to promote a}} relaxed atmosphere as {{he was aware that}} his presence may make the cast and crew nervous. Hung took a <b>hands-off</b> role on the film and entrusted Mr Vampire to protégé director Ricky Lau.|$|E
25|$|During {{his short}} {{appointment}} as Minister of Finance, Sarkozy {{was responsible for}} introducing a number of policies. The degree to which this reflected libéralisme (a <b>hands-off</b> approach to running the economy) or more traditional French state dirigisme (intervention) is controversial. He resigned the day following his election {{as president of the}} UMP.|$|E
25|$|The Economist {{noted that}} Confucius Institutes {{are used to}} project China's soft power and win the support of an {{external}} audience, and Confucius was specifically chosen to cast an image of peace and harmony. Such centers are partially sponsored by the Chinese government, with a <b>hands-off</b> approach to management, its directors being directly appointed by their attached universities.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} boardroom, Ruth, Ansell and Samuel {{were given a}} clear warning to stop their {{complimentary}} attitude, as {{none of them were}} willing to criticise Michelle for her <b>hands-off</b> management, and Sir Alan wanted them to defend themselves. Of the three, Ruth was most unwilling to criticise Michelle, instead stating that Samuel should be fired for failing to contribute towards decision-making, yet conceded under pressure that she was torn between the two.|$|E
25|$|The Triplane {{began as}} a private venture by the Sopwith Aviation Company. The {{fuselage}} and empennage closely mirrored those of the earlier Pup, but chief engineer Herbert Smith gave the new aircraft three narrow-chord wings to provide the pilot with an improved field of view. Ailerons were fitted to all three wings. By using the variable incidence tailplane, the aircraft could be trimmed to fly <b>hands-off.</b> The introduction of a smaller 8ft span tailplane in February 1917 improved elevator response.|$|E
25|$|With {{pitch control}} {{provided}} by all four elevons, roll by the split ailerons (operating together), speed / approach control by split ailerons / airbrakes and yaw {{controlled by the}} rudder. In this configuration the aircraft proved to be stable in pitch, {{being able to be}} flown <b>hands-off</b> during aero-tow, and pitch could be controlled simply by the pilot leaning forwards or backwards to adjust the centre of gravity. Lateral stability was noted to be poor to fair but acceptable and the aircraft was safe and capable of flying simple aerobatics.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the administration's <b>hands-off</b> {{attitude}} and the predominantly male, transient, and uneducated nature of the population, the society of Singapore was rather lawless and chaotic. Prostitution, gambling, and drug abuse (particularly of opium) were widespread. Chinese criminal secret societies (analogous to modern-day triads) were extremely powerful; some had tens of thousands of members, and turf wars between rival societies occasionally led to death tolls numbering in the hundreds. Attempts to suppress these secret societies had limited success, and they continued to be a problem well into the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|The Chinese Government {{shares the}} burden of funding Confucius Institutes with host universities, and takes a <b>hands-off</b> {{approach}} to management. The Institutes function independently within the guidelines established by Hanban and the Confucius Institute Headquarters. Each Institute is responsible for drawing up and managing their own budget, which is subject to approval by the headquarters. The Confucius Institute Headquarters provides various restrictions on how their funds may be used, including earmarking funds for specific purposes. Institutes in the United States are generally provided with $100,000 annually from Hanban, with the local university required to match funding.|$|E
25|$|For {{the next}} three years the Nationalist movement's earlier largely <b>hands-off</b> {{approach}} to the dirty grind of daily politics was replaced by dedicated effort to achieve practical results through immediate political action. The logic of the situation made the upstart reform movement around the Nationalist Clubs the natural ally of the upstart movement emerging around the People's Party, and the two organizations intermingled. Nationalist Club members joined their local People's Party organizations en masse while Bellamy attempted to consolidate this alliance by molding his new publication {{into one of the most}} important voices of the Populist movement in the Eastern United States.|$|E
25|$|Frankfurter was <b>hands-off</b> in {{the area}} of business. In the 1956 {{government}} case against DuPont, started because DuPont seemed to have maneuvered its way into a preferential relationship with GM, Frankfurter refused to find a conspiracy, and said the Court had no right to interfere with the progress of business. Here again, Frankfurter opposed - and lost out to - the views of the court majority made up of Justices Warren, Black, Douglas and Brennan. Later in his career, Frankfurter's judicial restraint philosophy frequently put him on the dissenting side of ground-breaking decisions taken by the Warren Court to end discrimination.|$|E
25|$|This {{partnership}} with the community was in line with Sir Stamford Raffles' vision of a thriving colony largely self-regulated by local social structures, with the British masters administrating it via indirect rule. The large influx of migrants from China, however, began to test this system when the <b>hands-off</b> approach by the British allowed secret societies in Singapore to thrive. Although originally formed with legal intentions of community bonding {{and the provision of}} assistance to fellow migrants, these societies gradually became influential, competitive, and increasingly engaged in illegal activity including monetary extortion from the masses, the operation of gambling dens, and the smuggling of illegal goods on top of more legal commercial operations to meet their financial needs.|$|E
25|$|Initially {{there were}} hopes that post-occupation Iran {{could become a}} {{constitutional}} monarchy. The new, young Shah Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi initially took a very <b>hands-off</b> role in government, and allowed parliament to hold a lot of power. Some elections were held in the first shaky years, although they remained mired in corruption. Parliament became chronically unstable, and from the 1947 to 1951 period Iran saw {{the rise and fall}} of six different prime ministers. Pahlavi increased his political power by convening the Iran Constituent Assembly, 1949, which finally formed the Senate of Iran—a legislative upper house allowed for in the 1906 constitution but never brought into being. The new senators were largely supportive of Pahlavi, as he had intended.|$|E
25|$|On May 20, 1861, Kentucky {{declared}} its neutrality. An important state geographically, Kentucky had the Ohio River {{as a natural}} barrier. Kentucky's natural resources, manpower, and the L Railroad made both the North and South respect Kentucky's neutrality. President Lincoln and Confederate President Jefferson Davis both maintained <b>hands-off</b> policies when dealing with Kentucky, hoping not to push the state into one camp or the other. From the L depot on Ninth and Broadway in Louisville and the steamboats at Louisville wharfs, supporters of the Confederacy sent uniforms, lead, bacon, coffee and war material south. Although Lincoln {{did not want to}} upset Kentucky's neutrality, on July 10, 1861, a federal judge in Louisville ruled that the United States government had the right to stop shipments of goods from going south over the L railroad.|$|E
25|$|The Confederacy had no plan to expand, protect or {{encourage}} its railroads. Southerners' {{refusal to}} export the cotton crop in 1861 left railroads bereft of their {{main source of}} income. Many lines had to lay off employees; many critical skilled technicians and engineers were permanently lost to military service. In {{the early years of}} the war the Confederate government had a <b>hands-off</b> approach to the railroads. Only in mid-1863 did the Confederate government initiate a national policy, and it was confined solely to aiding the war effort. Railroads came under the de facto control of the military. In contrast, the U.S. Congress had authorized military administration of Union-controlled railroad and telegraph systems in January 1862, imposed a standard gauge, and built railroads into the South using that gauge. Confederate armies successfully reoccupying territory could not be resupplied directly by rail as they advanced. The C.S. Congress formally authorized military administration of railroads in February 1865.|$|E
25|$|Hamid Karzai's {{election}} {{campaign manager for}} the south, and half-brother, Ahmed Wali Karzai – himself a candidate for re-election {{as the head of}} the Kandahar provincial council – has also long been alleged to have prominent drug trafficking ties, and was thought to control a significant proportion of Afghan heroin production. Numerous reports link him to the Afghan drug trade, according to officials from the White House, the State Department and the United States Embassy in Afghanistan. Officials at the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence have alleged that the White House favored a <b>hands-off</b> approach with Ahmed Wali Karzai because of his political position. Only a week before the election he denied a report from German news magazine Stern that said that British special forces had found several tons of opium on his land. He claimed that this was being done just before the election to hurt Hamid Karzai's chance of re-election.|$|E
25|$|On 11 July 1882, Gladstone {{ordered the}} {{bombardment}} of Alexandria, starting the Anglo-Egyptian War, {{which resulted in}} the occupation of Egypt. Gladstone's role in the decision to invade was described as relatively <b>hands-off,</b> and the ultimate responsibility was borne by certain members of his cabinet such as Lord Hartington, Secretary of State for India, Thomas Baring, 1st Earl of Northbrook, First Lord of the Admiralty, Hugh Childers, Secretary of State for War, and Granville Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville, the Foreign Secretary. The reasons for this war are the subject of a historiographical debate. Some historians argue that the invasion was to protect the Suez Canal and to prevent anarchy {{in the wake of the}} Urabi Revolt and the riots in Alexandria in June 1882. Other historians argue that the invasion occurred to protect the interests of British investors with assets in Egypt and also to boost the political popularity of the Liberal Party.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of Lost Odyssey was first proposed to Microsoft Game Studios by Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi. The first discussions began in 2003. It was {{a collaboration between}} Mistwalker, an independent game studio set up by Sakaguchi in 2004, and Microsoft. It was initially an internal project by Microsoft with Sakaguchi, but development ran into difficulties. Faced with critical problems, Microsoft decided to found a dedicated studio to help with development: this became Feelplus, which formed one part of AQ Interactive. The staff of feelplus included {{a large number of}} developers from the defunct Nautilus, which had helped develop The Legend of Dragoon, Phantom Dust and the Shadow Hearts series. Among the shared staff were art director Takamasa Ohsawa. They also included developers from Microsoft and Sega. Further freelance staff were also brought in. Development started in 2004 and lasted three and a half years. Mistwalker handled the story and character design, Feelplus developed the actual product, while Microsoft provided funding, project management and testing. While development started with ten people, at development's peak it was at 150. The game's respective director and technical director, Daisuke Fukugawa and Katsuhisa Higuchi, had previously worked at Square Enix. Sakaguchi was fairly closely involved during the initial development, but during later phases he took a more <b>hands-off</b> supervisory approach.|$|E

500|$|The 48-page {{prestige}} format one-shot comic took {{a considerable}} amount of time to produce. Both Moore and Bolland are well known for their meticulous and time-consuming work; both creators' then-recently finished 12-issue maxiseries titles—Moore's Watchmen and Bolland's Camelot 3000—had seen delays. He was aided by the laid back attitude taken by DC, who he says [...] "seemed prepared to let me do it at my own pace." [...] The original editor, Len Wein, left the company, and was replaced by Dennis O'Neil, a [...] "very <b>hands-off</b> sort of guy," [...] with whom Bolland only recalls having one conversation about the book.|$|E
500|$|Fairbanks {{described}} Kingsley as [...] "an unusually permissive slave owner" [...] {{who wrote}} about the physical superiority of Africans to Europeans, armed his slaves for protection, and gave them padlocks for their cabins. Historian Daniel Stowell suggests that the cabins and Kingsley's <b>hands-off</b> approach to slave management was intended to prevent the slaves from running away. Kingsley himself wrote about not interfering in his slaves' family lives and [...] "encouraged {{as much as possible}} dancing, merriment and dress, for which Saturday afternoon and night, and Sunday morning were dedicated ... they were perfectly honest and obedient, and appeared quite happy, having no fear but that of offending me; and I hardly ever had occasion to apply other correction than shaming them." ...|$|E
500|$|Ray Charles was 28years old in 1958, {{with ten}} years of {{experience}} recording primarily rhythm and blues music for the Downbeat and Swingtime record labels, in a style {{similar to that of}} Nat King Cole and Charles Brown. Charles signed with Atlantic Records in 1954 where producers Ahmet Ertegun and Jerry Wexler encouraged him to broaden his repertoire. Wexler would later remember that Atlantic Records' success came not from the artists' experience, but the enthusiasm for the music: [...] "We didn't know shit about making records, but we were having fun". Ertegun and Wexler found that a <b>hands-off</b> approach was the best way of encouraging Charles. Wexler later said, [...] "I realized the best thing I could do with Ray was leave him alone".|$|E

500|$|Giants {{executives}} {{were impressed with}} his talent and on September 1, 1964 Murakami was promoted, thus becoming the first Japanese player to play in MLB. After Murakami put up good pitching statistics as a reliever, Giants executives sought to exercise a clause in their contract with the Hawks that, they claimed, [...] allowed them to buy up an exchange prospect's contract. NPB officials objected, stating {{that they had no}} intention of selling Murakami's contract to the Giants and telling them that Murakami was merely on loan for the 1964 season. After a two-month stalemate the Giants eventually agreed to send Murakami back to the Hawks after the 1965 season. Thus, after pitching one more season for the Giants, Murakami returned to Japan to play for the Hawks. This affair led to the 1967 United States [...] Japanese Player Contract Agreement, also known as the [...] "working agreement", between MLB and NPB, which was basically a <b>hands-off</b> policy.|$|E
500|$|Though the {{committee}} made most decisions involving the Leafs, Smythe {{was not a}} <b>hands-off</b> owner and was constantly fighting with his son. Stafford commented: [...] "My father has always given me lots of rope. When I was thirty, I was ten years ahead of everybody. But at forty, I'm ten years behind everybody." [...] Finally, in 1961, Stafford resigned from the Silver Seven and this spurred Conn. After four years of fighting, he offered to sell his shares to Stafford and in November 1961, Smythe sold 45,000 of his 50,000 shares in Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. to a partnership of his son, Ballard, and Bassett for $2.3million—a handsome return on his investment of 34 years earlier. At first, Smythe thought the sale was only to his son, and {{when he learned that}} it was to the threesome, he was furious with Stafford. He had hoped that Stafford would eventually keep the Gardens for his son Tommy. Despite his misgivings, Smythe did not cancel the deal.|$|E
500|$|In {{his role}} as producer, Iwakami took a mostly <b>hands-off</b> approach.

[...] After helping to recruit the staff, he allowed them mostly free rein in developing the actual content of the story, providing minimal guidance from himself. After viewing the character designs that Aoki created, he became fully assured that he could trust the creative talent of the team. In an interview with Anime News Network after the series finished airing in Japan, Iwakami summed up his philosophy as [...] "I don't matter much; it's up to those talents to do their work.

500|$|... 20th Century Fox Television and Imagine TV {{were the}} {{production}} companies {{for the show}} that eventually became The Playboy Club. They had previously attempted to produce the concept during the 2010–11 television season but the project never came to fruition. After that initial attempt, the companies approached screenwriter Chad Hodge, who became the show's creator and an executive producer. Imagine co-founder Brian Grazer and president Francie Calfo also served as executive producers, as did Richard Rosenzweig, a longtime executive and consultant with Playboy Enterprises. Alta Loma Entertainment, Playboy's entertainment production arm, received copies of all the story outlines and scripts for review but, according to Hodge, took a very <b>hands-off</b> approach and did not get heavily involved in the creative process. Likewise, Playboy Enterprises founder Hugh Hefner reviewed each of the scripts personally, but did not provide much direct input or request major changes. The original title of the series was Bunny Tales, then Playboy, before the final title The Playboy Club was chosen. The show's pilot script was the first new drama series ordered by NBC for the 2011–12 television season.|$|E
500|$|Hancock governed Massachusetts {{through the}} end of the Revolutionary War and into an {{economically}} troubled postwar period, repeatedly winning reelection by wide margins. Hancock took a <b>hands-off</b> approach to governing, avoiding controversial issues as much as possible. According to William Fowler, Hancock [...] "never really led" [...] and [...] "never used his strength to deal with the critical issues confronting the commonwealth." [...] Hancock governed until his surprise resignation on January 29, 1785. Hancock cited his failing health as the reason, but he may have become aware of growing unrest in the countryside and wanted to get out of office before the trouble came. Hancock's critics sometimes believed that he used claims of illness to avoid difficult political situations. Historian James Truslow Adams wrote that Hancock's [...] "two chief resources were his money and his gout, the first always used to gain popularity, and the second to prevent his losing it". The turmoil that Hancock avoided ultimately blossomed as Shays's Rebellion, which Hancock's successor James Bowdoin had to deal with. After the uprising, Hancock was reelected in 1787, and he promptly pardoned all the rebels. Hancock was reelected to annual terms as governor for the remainder of his life.|$|E
