40|$|Experimental {{economics}} {{has brought}} about the most extraordinary changes to economics. Not so long ago the economics profession simply {{could not see the}} purpose or relevance of laboratory experiments, but over the past thirty years their number has grown continuously and experimental economics {{has become one of the}} most exciting fields of economics. As is often the case with new areas of research, methodological reflection has lagged behind the rapid growth in, and the various applications of, experimental tools and results. Methodological debate may have been further restrained by the strong scepticism toward laboratory experimentation in economics: experimental economists may have felt they had to wait for more <b>favourable</b> <b>timing</b> to openly address legitimate critiques and acknowledge the limitations of the experimental method. Now that experimental economics is firmly established, the time i...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} the selectivity and timing performance of 218 UK investment trusts {{over the period}} July 1981 to June 2009. We estimate the Treynor and Mazuy (1966) and Henriksson and Merton (1981) models augmented with the size, value, and momentum factors, either under the OLS method adjusted with the Newey-West procedure or under the GARCH(1, 1) -in-mean method following the specification of Glosten et al. (1993; hereafter GJR-GARCH-M). We find that the OLS method provides little evidence in favour of the selectivity and timing ability, consistent with previous studies. Interestingly, the GJR-GARCH-M method reverses this result, showing some relatively strong evidence on favourable selectivity ability, particularly for international funds, as well as <b>favourable</b> <b>timing</b> ability, particularly for domestic funds. We conclude that the GJR-GARCH-M method performs better in evaluating fund performance compared with the OLS method and the non-parametric approach, as it essentially accounts for the time-varying characteristics of factor loadings and hence obtains more reliable results, in particular, when the high frequency data, such as the daily returns, {{are used in the}} analysis. Our results are robust to various in-sample and out-of-sample tests and have valuable implications for practitioners in making their asset allocation decisions across different fund styles...|$|E
40|$|Three {{dimensional}} echocardiography is {{a recent}} and advanced technique analysing the structures of the heart starting from bidimensional images obtained in three different planes (sagittal, frontal and transversal). Images are then processed by special to reproduce the real three dimensional structures of the heart. This technique by its two methods (transthoracic and transesophageal three dimensional echocardiography) allows an accurate view of the cardiac structures and helps to identify the most <b>favourable</b> type and <b>timing</b> of surgical treatment. Intravenous contrast is now available to improve image quality in those patients whose ultrasonographic evaluation was previously suboptimal. The use of contrast is indicated for left ventricular opacification and endocardial border delineation especially in obese patients and those with lung disease. Improvements in image quality with intravenous contrast agents can facilitate image acquisition and enhance delineation of regional wall abnormalities at the peak level of exercise during stress echocardiography. In addition, substantial research efforts are underway to use ultrasound contrast for assessment of myocardial perfusion...|$|R
40|$|The {{combustion}} {{and emissions}} performance of fuel blends in modern combustion systems {{has been investigated}} {{with the intention of}} reducing emissions, improving efficiency and assessing the suitability of future automotive fuels. The combustion systems used in this study include Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) and Direct Injection Spark Ignition (DISI). By adding a small quantity (10 %) of diesel to gasoline, the HCCI combustion of this ‗Dieseline‘ mixture shows a 4 % increase in the maximum and a 16 % reduction in the minimum loads (IMEP) achievable. The NOX emissions are reduced, with greater than 30 % savings seen for high engine loads. The addition of bio-fuels (ethanol and 2, 5 di-methylfuran) to gasoline in HCCI combustion resulted in reduced ignitability giving rise to a 0. 25 bar IMEP reduction of the maximum load. A 70 % increase in NOX emissions is seen at an engine load of 3. 5 bar IMEP. The addition of ethanol {{and to a lesser extent}} 2, 5 di-methylfuran (DMF) to gasoline in DISI combustion shows increased combustion efficiency. The NOX emissions are reduced with ethanol, but are increased with the addition of DMF. At wide open throttle the bio-fuels show up to a 3 percentage point increase in efficiency through the use of more <b>favourable</b> spark <b>timings</b> brought about by the increased octane ratings and enthalpies of vaporisation. The PM emissions from DISI combustion can be reduced by up to 58 % (mass) with the addition of ethanol. The soluble organic fraction forms a significant part of the total PM, particularly for the higher ethanol blends at wide open throttle. The addition of DMF however increases the total PM by up to 70 % (mass) through the incomplete combustion of the ring structure. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Species {{living in}} {{unpredictable}} habitats cannot {{prepare for a}} regular reproductive year, and must reproduce when conditions are <b>favourable.</b> The <b>timing</b> of reproduction of the seed predators involves anticipating an abundant food supply by tracking cues or triggers which initiate reproduction. These cues are poorly understood. The most supported theory is that a cue or cues is the size or abundance of the developing fruit crop, and possibly involves nutritional compounds in the crop. The rimu (Dacrydium cupressinum) is a masting podocarp tree strongly linked to reproduction in kakapo (Strigops habroptilus). On Codfish Island kakapo only breed in rimu mast years and nesting is timed so chicks hatch when the rimu fruit crop (the sole food source for chicks) is due to ripen. This thesis investigates the theory that some component in unripe rimu fruit is involved in timing of nesting in kakapo. I characterised seasonal changes (over one year) in nutritional components (gross nutrients), polyphenolic compounds and other potential target polyphenolic substances with possible hormonal activity, including isoflavones and antioxidants, during rimu fruit development. A number of the compounds found in rimu fruit are known to affect reproduction in other species and could be potential triggers for reproduction in kakapo. In non-mast years insufficient fruit is available to trigger reproduction {{and there is no}} breeding, supporting the idea that the abundance of the fruit crop is also involved in the timing of reproduction. The trigger for breeding in these birds could be ingestion of a threshold level of a trigger substance or substances, or, as in the antbird, it could be entirely visual. The most likely contenders for the trigger in green rimu fruit include increasing levels of crude protein, crude fat, individual fatty acids, dietary fibre (changing the digestibility of other nutrients), calcium, phosphorus, calcium, total polyphenolic content and antioxidant levels, some flavenoids or a combination of these. It is possible that the physiological changes necessary for reproduction are triggered by the abundance of the unripe fruit crop but that nesting itself is triggered by changes in the green, undeveloped fruit associated with ripening...|$|R
