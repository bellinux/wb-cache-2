2500|$|... 1977 changes {{included}} redesigned {{sheet metal}} {{for the first}} time in the Gremlin's now 8-year history: revised hood, shorter front fenders, new bumpers, taller <b>glass</b> <b>tailgate,</b> enlarged taillights, and rear license plate now covering the fuel filler. The front end was shortened by four inches (102mm) with all new sheet metal and a crosshatch grille insert. Parking lights reverted to rectangular, and headlights were recessed into square bezels with rounded corners. The new hood had a small [...] "power bulge" [...] at the front. The base model now included carpeting, as well as rocker panel and wheel lip moldings. The [...] "Custom" [...] model was available with a list price of $2,998. The X package returned as a $189 option, with a new striping pattern that ran straight back from the front fenders and crested upward over the rear wheels. Front disc brakes became standard.|$|E
50|$|New models also {{appeared}} in Phase 2 trim. Sold only in the UK, the Rallye was launched in 1998 using the mechanicals from the GTI-6, but with less standard equipment (manual windows and mirrors, no air-con, Rallye-specific cloth instead of leather and alcantara, front spot lights removed), making it 65 kg lighter than the GTI-6. Sold at a discounted price of £15,995 (over £2000 less than a GTI-6), it only came in four colours - black, Cherry Red and Bianca White and one only in Dragoon Blue - and there were only 501 produced. The only drawback is the insurance costs as the Rallye is in group 16. As {{the production of the}} Rallye straddled the Phase 2 and 3 models, some Rallyes had superficial Phase 3 features such as the flush <b>glass</b> <b>tailgate</b> and slightly different bonnet, but remained fundamentally a Phase 2 model in such characteristics as the fuse box and electrical layout. The UK Rallye is different from the 2001 Australian market N5 Rallye, which was based on the 5-door XT model.|$|E
5000|$|The {{traditional}} [...] "T" [...] {{instead of}} the, CD player with AM / FM tuner, automatic air conditioning, privacy <b>glass</b> (rear <b>tailgate),</b> and equipped with electric remote door mirror body same color door handles, full performance and comfortable [...] "L [...] "was added.|$|R
5000|$|... "G", {{based on}} privacy <b>glass</b> (rear <b>{{tailgate}})</b> door mirrors door handles tailgate handles outer body same color, remote control electric door mirrors, CD player etc. equipped & AM / FM tuner, and a cloth seat covers only special edition models employing {{the side door}} linings clad [...] "Minuet" [...] was released.|$|R
5000|$|Cosmetically, the {{facelift}} {{brings the}} Focus {{in line with}} the Kinetic Design language seen on the 2007 Ford Mondeo, and 2006 Ford S-MAX & Ford Galaxy, whilst keeping with the general shape of the pre-facelift model. Every exterior panel (except the roof) underwent a reworking with the following key detail changes: trapezoidal grilles, swept back headlamps, bold wheel arches, newly shaped rear <b>glass,</b> a contoured <b>tailgate</b> and new tail lamps ...|$|R
50|$|The second {{generation}} K5 models incorporated the rear hatch <b>glass</b> and <b>tailgate</b> {{into a single}} unit, which allowed the glass panel to retract inside of the tailgate by use of a manual crank mounted on the tailgate or an electric motor activated by a key-operated switch on the tailgate and a dash-mounted switch. The weight of the large glass panel was rumored to be a liability as the manual crank gears wore prematurely and the electric motor was prone to frequent overheating and subsequent failure. This also included the electric motor drive cable which goes to the window regulator to the motor (similar in design to a speedometer cable), which usually would fail under heavy abuse. Another feature of the K5 Blazer tailgate was the safety switch connected to the electric motor which prevented the rear window from being raised if the tailgate was unlatched.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} the third-generation Discovery was previewed by the Discovery Vision Concept at the 2014 New York Auto Show, and the {{production}} design stays very true on the exterior. In profile, the exterior design is also {{very similar to the}} small Discovery Sport model. In contrast to previous Discovery models, the third-generation has a much more rounded shape, eschewing the traditional angular design. The tail lights have changed from a vertical orientation to horizontal, and the third-row side glass no longer blends into the roof <b>glass.</b> The <b>tailgate</b> is no longer horizontally split and has been replaced with a conventional top hinged tailgate made from composite. The roof is still stepped over the third row, though it is now largely cosmetic in comparison to the previous models and the roof now has a strong taper to the back. The interior closely follows that from other contemporary Land Rover models, while continuing the 3-row tradition of the Discovery.|$|R
50|$|The five-passenger Envoy XUV, {{introduced}} for 2004, was {{an attempt}} to create a combination of pickup truck and SUV. It featured a retractable rear roof section that slid forward, giving an open-topped load area like the 1960s car Studebaker Wagonaire. A 'MidGate' could be raised to partition the load area off from the passenger compartment; this was a solid, waist-height plastic-lined panel and with a retractable glass partition for the top half. The two-way tailgate could either hinge sideways or drop down; the <b>tailgate</b> <b>glass</b> retracted into the solid tailgate. The cargo area was waterproofed and fitted with a drainage system, allowing it to be easily hosed down for cleaning.|$|R
2500|$|The {{redesigned}} WJ 1999 Grand Cherokee shared just 127parts {{with its}} predecessor (mostly fasteners). The European model was coded WG. The spare tire was relocated {{from the side}} of the cargo compartment to under the floor. (Like the 1998 ZJ, the rear <b>tailgate</b> <b>glass</b> opened separately.) The two heavy pushrod V8 engines were replaced by Chrysler's then-new PowerTech. The new V8 engine produced less torque than the old pushrods, but was lighter, offered better fuel economy, and provided similar on road performance figures (the 23-gallon fuel tank was replaced with one of a 20.5-gallon capacity). The straight-six engine was also updated in 1999. A redesign of the intake manifold added [...] While other Jeep vehicles used the Mopar 5 x 4.5 bolt circle, this was the first Jeep following the 1987 Chrysler buyout to receive a wider bolt pattern:– 5 x 5.|$|R
5000|$|Dual and tri-operating gates: Ford's {{full-size}} wagons for 1966 {{introduced a}} system marketed as [...] "Magic Doorgate" [...] — a conventional tailgate with retracting rear <b>glass,</b> where the <b>tailgate</b> could either fold down or pivot open {{on a side}} hinge — with the rear window retracted in either case. Competitors marketed their versions as a Drop and Swing or Dual Action Tailgate. [...] For 1969, Ford incorporated a design that allowed the rear glass to remain up or down when the door pivoted open on its side hinge, marketing the system, which had been engineered by Donald N. Frey as the [...] "Three-Way Magic Doorgate". Similar configurations became the standard on full-size and intermediate wagons from GM, Ford, and Chrysler. GM added a notch in the rear bumper that acted as a step plate; to fill the gap, {{a small portion of}} bumper was attached to the doorgate. When opened as a swinging door, this part of the bumper moved away, allowing the depression in the bumper to provide a [...] "step" [...] to ease entry; when the gate was opened by being lowered or raised to a closed position, the chrome section remained in place making the bumper [...] "whole".|$|R
5000|$|Clamshell: Full-size General Motors 1971-1976 wagons [...] - [...] the Chevrolet Kingswood, Belair and Caprice Estates; Pontiac Safari and Grand Safari; Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser, and the Buick Estate models [...] - [...] {{featured}} a 'clamshell' design marketed as the Glide-away tailgate, also called a [...] "disappearing" [...] tailgate because when open, the tailgate was {{completely out of}} view. On the clamshell design, the rear power-operated glass slid up into the roof and the lower tailgate (with either manual or optional power operation), lowered completely below the load floor. The manual lower tailgate was counterbalanced by a torque rod similar to the torque rods used in holding a trunk lid open, requiring a 35 lb push to fully lower the gate. Raising the manual gate required a 5 lb pull via a handhold integral to {{the top edge of}} the retractable gate. [...] The power operation of both upper <b>glass</b> and lower <b>tailgate</b> became standard equipment in later model years. Wagons with the design {{featured a}}n optional third row of forward-facing seats accessed by the rear side doors and a folding second-row seat [...] - [...] and could accommodate a 4 x 8' sheet of plywood with rear seats folded. The clamshell design required no increased footprint or operational area to open, allowing a user to stand at the cargo opening without impediment of a door [...] - [...] for example, in a closed garage. Subsequent GM full-size wagons reverted to the doorgate style for its full-size wagons.|$|R
