40|$|Scaling up {{microbial}} {{fuel cells}} (MFCs) {{will require more}} compact reactor designs. Spacers {{can be used to}} minimize the reactor size without adversely affecting performance. A single 1. 5 mm <b>expanded</b> <b>plastic</b> spacer (S 1. 5) produced a maximum power density (973 ± 26 mWm - 2) that was similar to that of an MFC with the cathode exposed directly to air (no spacer). However, a very thin spacer (1. 3 mm) reduced power by 33 %. Completely covering the air cathode with a solid plate did not eliminate power generation, indicating oxygen leakage into the reactor. The S 1. 5 spacer slightly increased columbic efficiencies (from 20 % to 24 %) as a result of reduced oxygen transfer into the system. Based on operating conditions (1000 ς, CE= 20 %), it was estimated that 0. 9 Lh - 1 of air would be needed for 1 m 2 of cathode area suggesting active air flow may be needed for larger scale MFCs. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} project looks for to innovate {{in the management}} of <b>expanded</b> <b>plastic</b> materials wastes and to propose techniques that take advantage of the properties that those plastics still have at the time they are discarded to the urban wastes flow, such is the case of the expanded polystyrene wastes (EPS) which after being transformed in small particles and mixed with pastes made of standard gypsum and water in diverse proportions allows the production of different construction products. At the end of this paper two specific mixtures are described; the first useful for gypsum wallboard production, and the second one to manufacture a flat board for thermal isolation material. The EPS is a stiff cell plastic material produced from the molding of little spheres or pearls of expansible polystyrene that shows a closed structure made of this thermoplastic which contains trapped air in a 96 - 98 % proportion of the volume of the pearls. Packaging {{is one of the main}} applications for this material hence EPS is a plenty waste in our society, it is also very popular in building construction where it is installed in air wall cameras and indoors covers; finally in a small proportion the plastic has other kind of applications like sport protections and commercial display. Se ha logrado ofrecer un grupo de 8 propuestas concretas para reciclaje de poliestireno expandido (EPS) que consiste en mezclar yeso o escayola y agua para constituir pastas que contienen residuos de EPS que se moldean como placas y paneles para la construcci&# 243;n. Se ha ensayado con muestras de pastas que van desde aquellas que contienen proporciones extremas de residuos hasta otras donde la presencia de agua para la preparaci&# 243;n de las mezclas es inusualmente rica, tambi&# 233;n se han ensayado mezclas compuestas por proporciones intermedias de sus ingredientes. De las pastas con los mejores comportamientos en ensayos previos se han aplicado sus f&# 243;rmulas en la fabricaci&# 243;n de muestras de placas y paneles similares a los usados en la construcci&# 243;n.

40|$|Self {{expanding}} metal stents (SEMS) play {{an important}} role in the management of malignant obstructing lesions in the gastrointestinal tract. Traditionally, they have been used for palliation in malignant gastric outlet and colonic obstruction and esophageal malignancy. The development of the polyflex stent, which is a removable self <b>expanding</b> <b>plastic</b> stent, allows temporary stent insertion for benign esophageal disease and possibly for patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to esophagectomy. Potential complications of SEMS insertion include perforation, tumour overgrowth or ingrowth, and stent migration. Newer stents are being developed with the aim of increasing technical and clinical success rates, while reducing complication rates. Other areas of development include biodegradable stents for benign disease and radioactive or drug-eluting stents for malignant disease. It is hoped that, in the future, newer stents will improve our management of these difficult conditions and, possibly, provide prognostic as well as symptomatic benefit in the setting of malignant obstruction...|$|R

Current hydrodynamics experiments on the OMEGA Laser use a three-dimensional sinusoidal pattern as a seed perturbation {{for the study of}} instabilities. The structure of this perturbation makes it highly desirable to obtain two simultaneous orthogonal backlighting views. We accomplished this using two backlit pinholes each mounted 12  mm 12 mm from the target. The pinholes, of varying size and shape, were centered on 5  mm 5 mm square foils of 50  μm 50 μm thick Ta. The backlighting is by KK-alpha emission from a 500  μm 500 μm square Ti or Sc foil mounted 500  μm 500 μm from the Ta on a plastic substrate.

The present global ecology drives researchers to find environmentally friendly alternatives to commonly used materials such <b>expanded</b> <b>plastics</b> and concrete. The project examined {{the possibilities of}} implementing mycelium materials in systematic product development processes. The eligibility of the material was tested by developing products for electric cargo bikes and, by doing so, reduce their ecological footprint. Mycelium materials relevant to Industrial Design Engineering mainly because of their ecological qualities {{but also because of}} their performance and the wide range of applicable fields. This study presents six different products developed for the cargo bike in which mycelium materials was considered eligible. The study also presents the material in general showcasing the applicability for other types of products. It was found most applicable for lightweight products used in friendly environments and with low demands on tolerances. These types of product don’t need additional coating, are self-compostable, are possible to create with no manufacturing costs and its production close-to carbon neutral. Conclusively, any product developer in need of a material with an elastic modulus of 15 MPa for densities 100 kg/m 3 (These are the properties of untreated mycelium materials grown without pressure) should consider using mycelium materials. Designers have the option to design a product with a manufacturing process that need no supplementary energy and without any ecological footprint (should you assume availability of local feedstock).
