500|$|Despite his {{problems}} off the field, Cannon was recruited by many college teams {{to play football}} as he left high school. His leading options included Florida and Ole Miss, but he chose LSU, who offered a job between semesters at a local car dealership; other colleges did not guarantee a job. Additionally, Cannon's mother believed he should remain close to home. [...] "Mommy was older and wiser, and <b>I</b> <b>followed</b> <b>her</b> advice," [...] said Cannon.|$|E
2500|$|The {{beautiful}} grisette looked {{sometimes at}} the gloves, then sideways to the window, {{then at the}} gloves, and then at me. [...] I was not disposed to break silence. <b>I</b> <b>followed</b> <b>her</b> example: [...] so, I looked at the gloves, then to the window, then at the gloves, and then at her, and so on alternately. I found I lost considerably in every attack: she had a quick black eye, and shot through two such long and silken eyelashes with such penetration, that she look'd into my very heart and reins. It may seem strange, but I could actually feel she did." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>followed</b> <b>her</b> at once. In {{another moment}} I {{was inside the}} Count's house.|$|E
6000|$|... "I know it," [...] {{answered}} Steinar, {{and there}} was something strange in his voice. [...] "Believe me, I do not slight fortune; <b>I</b> <b>follow</b> <b>her</b> in my own fashion." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Rogue, {{you have}} cheated me as you cheat all men and now <b>I</b> <b>follow</b> <b>her</b> who has gone. Be sure, however, that you shall reap your reward in due season, de Noyon." ...|$|R
60|$|Gons. With what Variety my fate torments me still! Never was man so dragged {{along by}} virtue; But <b>I</b> must <b>follow</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|She {{was waiting}} for me at the door, when <b>I</b> <b>followed</b> <b>her</b> to the house.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>followed</b> <b>her</b> up the unflinching, wagon-wide {{staircase}} {{to the gallery}} whence opened the thin fluted Elizabethan doors.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>followed</b> <b>her</b> lead, and I saw her {{glance back}} over her {{shoulder}} at the young man, who seemed unaware, even, of her departure.|$|E
60|$|She led {{me across}} the lawn, along the same path by which <b>I</b> had <b>followed</b> <b>her</b> {{on the day after}} my arrival at Limmeridge.|$|R
6000|$|Where I {{find her}} not, beauties vanish; [...] Whither <b>I</b> <b>follow</b> <b>her,</b> beauties flee; [...] Is there no method {{to tell her}} in Spanish [...] June's twice June since she breathed it with me? [...] Come, bud, show me the least of her traces, [...] 45 [...] Treasure my lady's lightest footfall! [...] --Ah, you may flout and turn up your faces-- [...] Roses, you are not so fair after all! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Follow her!" [...] he said; [...] "why should <b>I</b> <b>follow</b> <b>her?</b> If <b>I</b> met her I {{might kill}} her or him, {{or both of}} them, because of the disgrace they have brought upon my child's name. No, I never want to look upon her face again. I trusted her, I tell you, and she has betrayed me. Let her go and find her fate. But I am going too. I am weary of my life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'This is my lady,' I said {{to myself}} and, keeping some {{distance}} behind and {{on the opposite side}} of the road, <b>I</b> <b>followed</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
60|$|She looked away, past me, in the {{direction}} of the drive. <b>I</b> <b>followed</b> <b>her</b> gaze. A stout figure, carrying a suit-case, was moving slowly down it.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>followed</b> <b>her,</b> and {{she closed}} the door behind her. She was dressed in a {{magnificent}} costume, her hair sparkling with diamonds, and I looked my questions.|$|E
40|$|This article {{concerns}} {{words of}} high and low density, ie a large sum with respect to the number of letters. A recent effort by Susan Thorpe (Lighter and Heavier, Word Ways, August 2003), also details previous work. She (deliberately, one supposes) omitted words, variously sanctioned by the OED and the Palindromicon, of length 5 or more, consisting solely of a repeated letter: <b>I</b> <b>follow</b> <b>her</b> in not using about 24 examples of repeated letters A, X, and Z...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{but the one}} way out. <b>I</b> must <b>follow</b> <b>her</b> plan. But with a variation--I {{will not}} ask for the money and ruin myself; I will ROB the old skinflint." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> {{rose and}} <b>followed</b> <b>her.</b> She {{pointed to a}} {{miniature}} portrait, hanging above the mantelpiece.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>followed</b> <b>her</b> into {{a little}} boudoir. Lady Delahaye, in a blue dressing-gown, was lying upon a sofa. She eyed me as I entered with a curious smile.|$|E
60|$|I {{looked at}} her. She was {{gazing at the}} Ghost. <b>I</b> <b>followed</b> <b>her</b> gaze, but could see nothing unusual. She looked at me, and I looked inquiry back.|$|E
60|$|Gladly <b>I</b> <b>followed</b> <b>her</b> to {{the little}} chamber, where she opened reverently a huge chest, from which she drew, one by one, the {{beautiful}} relics of her prosperity.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Of my lost angel, who perished miserably in New Zealand. Twice {{her spirit}} has {{appeared}} to me. I shall see {{her for the}} third time, tonight; <b>I</b> shall <b>follow</b> <b>her</b> to the better world.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know, I am sure. <b>I</b> can't <b>follow</b> <b>her.</b> <b>I</b> don't {{understand}} her. She {{has something}} in her head; I don't know what {{she is trying to}} do. She is too deep for me." ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Bundercombe {{rose to her}} feet. <b>I</b> {{hastened to}} <b>follow</b> <b>her</b> example. We stood confronting one another.|$|R
6000|$|She {{attempted}} to escape into the cottage; <b>I</b> <b>followed</b> <b>her</b> to {{the threshold of}} the door. [...] "Surely it's not time to go to bed yet," [...] I ventured to say.|$|E
60|$|I had {{not heard}} the sound of voices, but Mrs. Temple turned, startled, and looked towards the house. <b>I</b> <b>followed</b> <b>her</b> glance, and {{suddenly}} I knew that my heart was beating.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think we}} should feel better in the shade, Mr. Ritchie," [...] she said in English, and, leaping lightly down from the bank, crossed the road again. <b>I</b> <b>followed</b> <b>her,</b> perforce.|$|E
60|$|She got up abruptly, {{and left}} me. <b>I</b> did not <b>follow</b> <b>her.</b> In my heart I {{understood}} why....|$|R
60|$|Those {{were her}} {{farewell}} words. I called after <b>her.</b> <b>I</b> tried to <b>follow</b> <b>her.</b> She {{was lost to}} me in the darkness.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said Herr Paul. [...] "He {{is fond of}} her. He is a chap of resolution, he {{will get}} her back. He told me: 'Well, you know, <b>I</b> shall <b>follow</b> <b>her</b> {{wherever}} she goes till she comes back.' He will do it, he is a determined chap; he will <b>follow</b> <b>her</b> wherever she goes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{left the}} office and <b>I</b> <b>followed</b> <b>her.</b> She walked up the Kennington Road, and I kept behind her. Presently she went into a shop. Mr. Holmes, it was an undertaker's." ...|$|E
60|$|Then, {{just to see}} how far {{she would}} go, perhaps desperately hoping she would make me hate her, <b>I</b> <b>followed</b> <b>her</b> shamelessly from patio to parlor, porch to court, even to the waltz.|$|E
6000|$|With glowing cheek, with gleaming eye, [...] She met {{me on the}} way: [...] My spirit {{owned the}} witchery [...] Within her smile that lay: [...] <b>I</b> <b>followed</b> <b>her,</b> I knew not why.|$|E
60|$|Fatigued {{with the}} {{somewhat}} exhausting and unusual {{character of the}} day's performances, and out of training as I was, <b>I</b> could not <b>follow</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
50|$|Beatrice Whitney Straight {{was born}} in Old Westbury, New York, the {{daughter}} of Dorothy Payne Whitney, of the Whitney family, and Willard Dickerman Straight, an investment banker, diplomat, and career U.S. Army officer. Her maternal grandfather was political leader and financier William Collins Whitney. In 1918, when Straight was four years old, her father died in France of influenza during the great epidemic while serving with the US Army during World War <b>I.</b> <b>Following</b> <b>her</b> mother's remarriage to British agronomist Leonard K. Elmhirst in 1925, {{the family moved to}} Devon England. It was there that Straight was educated at Dartington Hall and began acting in amateur theater productions.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Mr. Jarndyce"--Mr. Bucket {{has read}} {{his face with}} the {{greatest}} attention all along--"I speak {{to you as a}} gentleman of a humane heart, and under such pressing circumstances as don't often happen. If ever delay was dangerous, it's dangerous now; and if ever you couldn't afterwards forgive yourself for causing it, this is the time. Eight or ten hours, worth, as I tell you, a hundred pound apiece at least, have been lost since Lady Dedlock disappeared. I am charged to find her. I am Inspector Bucket. Besides all the rest that's heavy on her, she has upon her, as she believes, suspicion of murder. If <b>I</b> <b>follow</b> <b>her</b> alone, she, being in ignorance of what Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, has communicated to me, may be driven to desperation. But if <b>I</b> <b>follow</b> <b>her</b> in company with a young lady, answering to the description of a young lady that she has a tenderness for--I ask no question, and I say no more than that--she will give me credit for being friendly. Let me come up with her and be able to have the hold upon her of putting that young lady for'ard, and I'll save her and prevail with her if she is alive. Let me come up with her alone--a hard matter--and I'll do my best, but I don't answer for what the best may be. Time flies; it's getting on for one o'clock. When one strikes, there's another hour gone, and it's worth a thousand pound now instead of a hundred." ...|$|R
