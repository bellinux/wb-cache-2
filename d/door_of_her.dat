5|$|Wollstonecraft {{was born}} on 27 April 1759 in Spitalfields, London. She was {{the second of the}} seven {{children}} of Elizabeth Dixon and Edward John Wollstonecraft. Although her family had a comfortable income when she was a child, her father gradually squandered it on speculative projects. Consequently, the family became financially unstable and they were frequently forced to move during Wollstonecraft's youth. The family's financial situation eventually became so dire that Wollstonecraft's father compelled her to turn over money that she would have inherited at her maturity. Moreover, he was apparently a violent man who would beat his wife in drunken rages. As a teenager, Wollstonecraft used to lie outside the <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mother's bedroom to protect her. Wollstonecraft played a similar maternal role for her sisters, Everina and Eliza, throughout her life. For example, in a defining moment in 1784, she convinced Eliza, who was suffering from what was probably postpartum depression, to leave her husband and infant; Wollstonecraft made all of the arrangements for Eliza to flee, demonstrating her willingness to challenge social norms. The human costs, however, were severe: her sister suffered social condemnation and, because she could not remarry, was doomed to a life of poverty and hard work.|$|E

She was satisfied, at peace, innocent round the <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own paradise.|$|R
25|$|Police officer Robert Riske was {{the first}} officer at the crime scene. He testified that he found a barefoot woman in a black dress lying face down in a puddle {{of blood on the}} walkway that led to the front <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> house. He next saw Goldman's body a short {{distance}} away, lying on its side beside a tree and off the walkway. Riske said he saw a white envelope, which was later found to contain the glasses left at the restaurant by Brown's mother. He also saw Goldman's beeper, a black leather glove, and a dark blue knit ski cap on the ground near the bodies. The front door of Brown's house was wide open, but there were no signs of forced entry nor any evidence that anyone had entered the premises. Nothing inside was out of the ordinary.|$|E
500|$|Near a hillock in Moula-Ali, Hyderabad, Mah Laqa {{constructed}} a walled compound where she frequently held mushairas. Inside this compound, she built a tomb for her biological mother in 1792. After her death, Mah Laqa was buried {{next to her}} mother. The tomb was constructed in the Mughal and Rajasthani architectures style in the Char Bagh pattern. Along with mausoleum, the complex contains a pavilion in centre that is decorated intricately with stucco work, the caravanserai, a mosque and two stepwells.

Before settling to this work, I observed that she softly closed the two <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> chamber; she even shut and fastened the casement, {{though it was a}} hot day, and free circulation of air was usually regarded by her as indispensable. Why this precaution? A keen suspicion, an almost fierce distrust, suggested such question. Did she want to exclude sound? what sound? ...|$|R

Death called her in the midst <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mercies, {{and she went to}} join those she tried to save.

The authorities immediately suppressed a students protest that followed and arrested 12 of them. Xinna was taken into custody and investigated for [...] "inciting students to cause a disturbance". Although not charged, Xinna was released 4 months later, on April 12, 1996. The Public Security Bureau closed the bookstore in Hohhot, even though the family had no other source of income.|$|E
2500|$|McGee {{appeared}} on the show's seventh season, , in 1998, during which she was described by The Seattle Times as [...] "the cynical girl from New York state". During filming, she appeared sick and was suffering from headaches, and during the 14th episode, she told the others that she had Lyme disease, then left during the next episode. As she was leaving, a heated exchange with another housemate, Stephen Williams, ended with him opening the passenger <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> car and slapping her.

2500|$|On the [...] {{morning of}} May 9, 1853, while Hannah Rosa and the {{children}} were assembled at their desks, two police officers stationed themselves at the front and back <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> house. [...] They informed Margaret and Hannah Rosa that teaching free black children was illegal under Virginia law, then took the two women and the twenty-five terrified children on foot to the mayor's office. This 1849 law, like similar ones throughout the South, was the result of Southern white panic following Nat Turner's Rebellion in 1831. Under this law, it was an 'unlawful assembly' [...] for black people to gather together to learn to read and write, punishable by whipping, and for any white person to instruct them, punishable by up to 100 dollars and six months in jail.|$|E

500|$|The queen {{probably}} {{spent most}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> reign in Antioch, Syria's administrative capital. Before the monarchy, Palmyra had {{the institutions of}} a Greek city (polis) and was ruled by a senate which was responsible for most civil affairs. Odaenathus maintained Palmyra's institutions, as did Zenobia; a Palmyrene inscription after her fall records the name of Septimius Haddudan, a Palmyrene senator. However, the queen apparently ruled autocratically; Septimius Worod, Odaenathus' viceroy and one of Palmyra's most important officials, disappeared from the record after Zenobia's ascent. The queen opened the <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> government to Eastern nobility. Zenobia's most important courtier and advisers were her generals, Septemius Zabdas and Septimius Zabbai; {{both of whom were}} generals under Odaenathus and received the gentilicium (surname) [...] "Septimius" [...] from him.|$|R

She brought the person a candle, and noticed that he wore a large cloak. The moment she had handed him the candle, however, he threw off the cloak and [...] "presented a most hideous and frightful appearance", vomiting blue and white flame from his mouth while his eyes resembled [...] "red balls of fire". Miss Alsop {{reported that}} he wore a large helmet and that his clothing, which appeared to be very tight-fitting, resembled white oilskin. Without saying a word he caught hold of her and began tearing her gown with his claws which she was certain were [...] "of some metallic substance". She screamed for help, and managed to get away from him and ran towards the house. He caught her on the steps and tore her neck and arms with his claws. She was rescued by one of her sisters, after which her assailant fled.|$|E
2500|$|Dayna Klein, a Federation {{employee}} who was five months pregnant, heard the shots being fired {{and as she}} went to the <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> office, Haq fired at her abdomen, but the bullet hit her raised arm. According to Klein, Haq then moved to another section of the building and Klein, bleeding profusely, crawled to her desk and dialed 911, despite Haq's threats to kill anyone who called the police. Haq eventually returned to Klein's office and discovered her on the phone, at which point he reportedly shouted [...] "Now since you don't know how to ... listen, now you're the hostage, and I don't give a [...] if I kill you or your baby." [...] Klein told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer that Haq [...] "...stated that he was a Muslim, [...] this was his personal statement against Jews and the Bush administration for giving money to Jews, and for us Jews for giving money to Israel, about Hezbollah, the war in Iraq, and he wanted to talk to CNN." [...] Klein then offered Haq the phone and suggested that he tell the dispatcher what he had just told her.|$|E
2500|$|The {{prosecution}} {{believed it}} had a strong case {{despite the lack of}} known witnesses to the crime and the failure to recover the murder weapon. Clark's case was supported by DNA evidence, and she expected a conviction. From the physical evidence that was collected, the prosecution claimed that Simpson drove to Nicole Brown's house on the evening of June 12 with the intention of killing her. They maintained that Brown had put their two children to bed and was {{getting ready to go to}} bed herself when she opened the front <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> house after either responding to a knock on the front door or hearing a noise outside. Simpson allegedly grabbed her before she could scream and attacked her with a knife. Forensic evidence from the Los Angeles County coroner alleged that Ron Goldman arrived at the front gate to the townhouse sometime during the assault, and the assailant apparently attacked him and stabbed him repeatedly in the neck and chest with one hand while restraining him with an arm choke-hold. Brown was found lying face down when authorities arrived at the crime scene. According to the prosecution's account, after Simpson had finished with Goldman, he pulled Brown's head back using her hair, put his foot on her back, and slit her throat with the knife, severing her carotid artery. They argued further that Simpson left a [...] "trail of blood" [...] from the condo to the alley behind it; there was also testimony that three drops of Simpson's blood were found on the driveway near the gate to his house on Rockingham Drive.|$|E
5000|$|In stark {{contrast}} with her extravagant stage persona, {{in real life}} Vyaltseva was a modest, economical woman, known to repair her old dresses. Despised by opera prima donnas, Vyaltseva was admired by choirgirls whom she was on friendly terms. [...] "While our France-touring divas were departing in personal carriages from rehearsals, Vyaltseva went home on foot or hired a street cabman," [...] colleague Vladimir Krieger remembered. [...] "Unlike many <b>of</b> <b>her</b> peers Vyaltseva proved herself eager to make personal sacrifices. <b>Doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> home were always open to those in need of help, she received hundreds of people every year," [...] biographer Kizimova wrote. Pianist A.V.Taskin, who accompanied Vyaltseva {{for the last eight}} years <b>of</b> <b>her</b> career, remembered how nerve-wrecking for her was every performance, but still spoke <b>of</b> <b>her</b> as <b>of</b> a very pleasant person to work with. The singer's tactfulness and restraint were a matter of legends.|$|R

50|$|Past the war, {{she earned}} a good {{reputation}} as salonnière. For years to come literary celebrities - e.g. Goethe, Wieland, the Schlegel brothers August and Friedrich, and Tieck — twice a week gathered in her house. As proven by letters she exchanged with her son, her plan to host Germany's greatest minds in salon reunions had been made before she moved out of Hamburg. Goethe's endorsement was a major factor behind Johanna's quick social success: Johanna was the first upper-class woman in Weimar society to willingly open the <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> house to Goethe's wife, Christiane Vulpius, who was of lower-class background and a mistress of Goethe's before legally marrying him during the French invasion. And in gratitude, Goethe {{became one of the}} first and most commonly seen figures in Johanna's reunions, which alone ensured the popularity <b>of</b> <b>her</b> parties.|$|R
2500|$|... “Although she {{was well}} over forty, she had lost none of her high spirits; she was kind and affectionate, but her {{eccentric}} and despotic nature made her rather formidable. When she heard that I {{was going to marry}} her niece, she took me in hand. From that day my life was no longer my own. She was an early riser and she used to telephone me at eight in the morning. Sometimes she came to the Hotel du Rhin, where I was staying, and sat reading the papers in my room while I dressed. If I happened to be out, she sent her servants all over Paris to look for me and sometimes took part in the search herself. I never had a moment's peace. I had to lunch, dine, go to the theater and supper with her almost every day. She usually slept through the first act of a play, and then woke up with a start to declare that the performance was stupid and that she wished to go somewhere else. We often changed theaters two or three times in one evening. As she felt the cold, she made her footman sit on a chair at the <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> box, holding a small traveling bag filled with shawls, scarves and furs. All these objects were numbered. If by chance, she was awake and felt a draft, she would ask me to bring her such or such a number. I could have put up with all this but unfortunately she had a passion for dancing. At midnight, now wide awake, she would drag me to a night club where she danced till dawn.”The diplomat Maurice Paléologue wrote on 14 October 1913, [...] "Although she is fifty-three, she lives openly with an Argentinian blackguard, dances at Magic City with all comers till two in the morning and associates with the scum of the aerodromes." ...|$|E

[...] "Children, see how beautiful it is!" [...] The children stared away at it, but Rose looked into the teacher's eager face. Then her flowers dropped to the ground, the sunlight fell upon her with a richer glow, the dandelions shone like stars in a heaven of green, the birds and the wind sang a wild clear song in the <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> ears, and her heart swelled with unutterable emotion. She was overpowered by the beauty of the world, as she had been by its immensity that day on the hill top with her father.|$|R

[...] But, for some reason, he does not remember when he did first kiss her, though he had looked forward to that miracle for weeks. He does not understand the reason; but there is the fact. Her kisses were big things to him, yet possibly there were larger psychological changes which occulted everything else, at first. But {{it must have}} been on that night that he first kissed her. For certainly it was when he called on her a week later that he kissed her for the second time.|$|R
