40|$|This essay {{considers}} the inverse to an Anthropocene characterized as {{an era of}} human-induced loss of species and life forms on earth. The global practice of burying increasing amounts and kinds of waste in landfills precipitates the mixing of wildly heterogeneous materials, which diverse kinds of bacteria avidly metabolize. As they relentlessly feed on our detritus, bacteria both proliferate and, we suggest, diversify. However, {{this is not a}} numbers game, nor is it one which is solely or even primarily about interconnectivity, networking, and entanglement. The ontological provocation of the human waste-bacterial conjunction is the fact of our total dependence on life forms whose life-worlds and trajectories are likely to remain overwhelmingly unknown to us. If this offers a cautionary note about our own increasingly hyperbolic perturbations of the Earth’s constitutive strata, perhaps its more profound prompting is about the force of the stratifications and <b>destratifications</b> proper to the planet itself...|$|R
5000|$|Apart {{from a few}} {{stratified}} cave sites—and {{those rare}} open-air sites where archaeological materials were deposited so rapidly that bioturbation and resultant <b>destratifications</b> failed {{to keep pace with}} deposition, most prehistoric cultural materials of the world reside in the soil biomantle. Such materials are thus mixed, and technically and theoretically out of its original context. Since many cultural materials (cleavers, choppers' core-stones, metates, manos, pestles, etc.) are invariably larger than burrow diameters of most key bioturbators at such sites (small rodents, ants, termites, worms), they settle downward and form a stonelayer, and thus become part of a two-layered biomantle. [...] Smaller artifacts (flakes, debitage) often are homogenized throughout the upper biomantle, and commonly observed in recent bioturbational spoil heaps, like those produced by pocket gophers, moles, and mole-rats.

50|$|The soil biomantle can be {{described}} and defined in several ways. Most simply, the soil biomantle is the organic-rich bioturbated {{upper part of the}} soil, including the topsoil where most biota live, reproduce, die, and become assimilated. The biomantle is thus the upper zone of soil that is predominantly a product of organic activity and the area where bioturbation is a dominant process. Soil bioturbation consists predominantly of three subsets: faunalturbation (animal burrowings), floralturbation (root growth, tree-uprootings), and fungiturbation (mycelia growth). All three processes promote soil parent material <b>destratification,</b> mixing, and often particle size sorting, leading with other processes to the formation of soil and its horizons. While the general term bioturbation refers mainly to these three mixing processes, unless otherwise specified it is commonly used as a synonym to faunalturbation (animal burrowings).|$|E

40|$|Most lower {{elevation}} California lakes experience one {{yearly cycle}} of stratification. Thermal stratification generally starts about March and extends through November, greatly influencing {{chemical and biological}} stratification. The metalimnion and hypolimnion of eutrophic lakes often are devoid of oxygen. Concomitant with the oxygen deficit is the build-up of anaerobic decomposition products and the exclusion of biota from the oxygen deficient zones. Artificial <b>destratification</b> by aeration reduces or eliminates thermal stratification. Oxygen is distributed to all depths and products of anaerobic decomposition are oxidized. Barriers to biotic distribution are minimal. The diffuse aeration system {{is probably the most}} effective for destratifying large lakes. Other methods are discussed. Artificial lake <b>destratification</b> increases the lakes's heat budget. The winter temperature regime is not affected by <b>destratification.</b> Summer surface temperatures during stratified and destratified periods are about equal. Bottom temperatures are greatly increased by <b>destratification</b> and may equal the surface temperatures. The coldest water temperature in a destratified lake may approach those found at the lake's surface during stratified periods. This increased heat content should benefit the fishery by increasing invertebrate forage production and decomposition of organic sediments. However, increased bottom temperatures may eliminate or preclude the establishment of a coldwater fishery. Two hypolimnion aeration systems are discussed. These systems aerate the bottom waters without causing thermal <b>destratification</b> and enhance coldwater fisheries. Lake aeration is economically feasible. Evaporation and chemical treatment savings alone may more than pay for the aeration system. Improved drinking water quality and fishery habitats results from aeration.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{concerns}} regarding water storage in Australia, and other semi-arid countries, is {{the high rate of}} evaporation that inevitably leads to significant water loss. In this paper, the use of air-bubble plume systems to reduce evaporation from large reservoirs is assessed. A <b>destratification</b> system was designed for a large dam based on its depth and stratification strength with the intention of destratifying the reservoir in a short time period. The model DYRESM was then used to simulate the water dynamics under <b>destratification</b> conditions. Different strategies for the operation of the aeration system were assessed, from 10 -days operation periods at times of high evaporation rates to continuous operation over longer time spans. The modelled water column temperatures and evaporation rates were analysed and it was found that artificial <b>destratification</b> was only effective in reducing evaporation in spring. In summer, heat is added to the water at a rapid rate, and artificial <b>destratification</b> only helps reduce evaporation in the initial days of operation. The effect of artificial <b>destratification</b> in reducing evaporation in autumn depends on the operation of the system during summer. If operated in summer, the rates of evaporation in autumn will increase due to the additional heat added to the water during the summer. In winter, overturn takes place and artificial <b>destratification</b> has no influence on water temperatures and evaporation. It was concluded that aeration by air-bubble plumes would only be effective in reducing evaporation if the hypolimnetic water does not become warm when mixing takes place.

The up-bay-ward along-channel component of straining by the southerly or easterly wind induces greater <b>destratification</b> than the down-bay-ward straining by the opposite wind direction, i. e., northerly or westerly winds.

Data taken from the experiments included density profiles as a function of time. The data obtained were analyzed determining the progression of the stability index with time. Adequate simulation of the prototype <b>destratification</b> experi-ments of Steichen (10) was achieved with the present model.
