The question people have to ask themselves is, who are the other 35 000 odd people who bought the Hilltop Hoods album? It’s such a small insular and at times disturbingly ignorant little slice of Australia that I think we’d just be banging our heads against the wall {{trying to get through}} to those 15-year-old kids. Yeah, I don’t know. There’s always that responsibility of just trying to keep it true, even though we don’t focus on that as much as a lot of acts do, I think it’s always in the back of everyone’s mind - probably whatever art form it is - that if they really love the art form that they’re attempting or drawing influences from then, you know, everyone is always really quite sensitive about other people’s perceptions in that culture or community. I think that’s the only responsibility, and obviously not to sell out is the other one. But that is pretty unlikely. And I’d say to hopefully bring more people in and that’ll change the culture of it, or it’ll make that more ignorant style of the culture a bit more isolated. I don’t know, to tell you the truth, sometimes I don’t feel like we’re part of the community that’s there at all. And neither are a lot of the artists we know, and even the artists that are respected in that community just throw their hands up and go ‘Look, I stopped trying to deal on that level with those fans a long time’.|$|E

40|$|I {{would like}} to begin by thanking the Melbourne Business School for organising this conference. For far too long, discussions about payment systems {{typically}} took place behind closed doors and were largely the preserve of specialists in fi nancial institutions. As this conference shows us, {{this is no longer}} the case, with payment systems posing challenging issues not just for the specialists, but also for academics and those involved in public policy. This more open discussion is surely {{in the interests of the}} community at large. Today, I {{would like to}} address the issue of how the payments system evolves over time. As we all know, the system in 2006 looks quite different from that in 1996 and, no doubt, will look quite different again in 2016. But how well do we understand these changes and the forces driving them? And what role is there for regulation in shaping how things evolve? The Big and Small Pictures <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> picture is clear to everybody – that is, the shift from cash and cheque payments to electronic payments (Graph 1). While we do not have data on the number, or value, of cash transactions, we do know that the average number of cheques written per person in Australia has halved since the mid 1990 s. Conversely, the average number of credit and debit card payments per person has more than doubled, as has the number of direct debits and credits. Similar trends are also evident in other countries, although Australia stands out in a number of dimensions (Table 1). First, Australia is in a relatively small group of countries in which cheques are still used frequently, although amongst these countries, the decline in cheque writing in Australia has bee...|$|E
40|$|James Fallows has a {{piece in}} the February, 2008 Atlantic on what he calls “The $ 1. 4 Trillion Question” – why China {{continues}} to accumulate $ 1 billion a day in relatively low-return American assets (mostly Treasury bills), why this can’t go on forever, and what it could mean if this pattern of investment ends abruptly rather than slowly. On the whole, it’s a good introduction, with some useful background on the people responsible for making the central government’s investment decisions. (The point {{that one of the}} two key figures, unlike his counterparts almost anywhere else, has never invested for himself, or even bought a house, is a nice touch.) I think the article overdoes its emphasis on a lack of transparency in China – the way in which sub-prime mortgages were re-packaged as “AAA” securities has made clear that the American financial markets China has been investing in aren’t always that transparent, either – but that’s a matter of tone and emphasis. What the article is missing, I think, are two important pieces of demographic and historical perspective, which help illustrate the pressures on the government. Fallows spends a fair amount of time on changes in China’s mood that may be real but are hard {{to get a handle on}} — e. g. greater awareness among the population that their investments in the US are not earning much money (and some high profile ones have been outright losers, like the widely-publicized investment in the Blackstone Group) and that this is money that could be used to better things at home – and speculations about how much the government wants to, or can, continue resisting those popular desires in the interests of keeping inflation low, etc. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> story is more structural than that. First the demography. Here the key point is one of the great under-played China stories : the rapid aging of the Chinese population. For roughly 30 years now, China has had compulsory birth control of various sorts, and (as most people reading this probably know) its birth rates declined at a rate that has very few historical parallels. So while the number of young people entering the work force every year has remained quite high until recently (China had so many births in the 1950 s and 1960 s that even with them having relatively few children per couple when they grew up, birth rates per 1, 000 population stayed high into the late 1980 s), the percentage of children in the population became quite low. Meanwhile, because Chinese death rates were very high before the Revolution, and stayed pretty high into the mid- 1960 s, there were also relatively few old people. So what economists call the “dependency ratio” – the ratio of people in the labor force to people whom workers need to support – has been extremely favorable for China over the last couple of decades:it’s now at about 2 workers per non-worker, versus about 1 : 1 for the U. S. But that is now changing pretty quickly (thanks mostly to public health improvements under Mao) and China will soon have a fairly old population; by 2030, it will have as high a percentage of old people as countries like Italy and Germany today, whose pension problems, etc., you read about periodically. [Some of the best work on this is by my UC Irvine colleague Wang Feng and Andrew Mason at the University of Hawaii – their paper in a newly published Cambridge Press book – China’s Great Economic Transformation, edited by Loren Brandt and Thomas Rawski, is well worth a look, though the book won’t be available for a couple more months. ] China’s dependency ratio will probably reach today’s global average by 2020, and the current U. S. level of 1 : 1 by 2030...|$|E
