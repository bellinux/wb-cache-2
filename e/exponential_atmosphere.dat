Recent work by Ochsendorf et al. has {{extended}} the accepted boundary of the superbubble. We fit Kompaneets models of superbubbles expanding in <b>exponential</b> <b>atmospheres</b> to the new, larger shape of the Orion-Eridanus superbubble. We find that this larger morphology of the superbubble {{is consistent with the}} evolution of the superbubble being primarily controlled by expansion into the exponential Galactic disk ISM if the superbubble is oriented with the Eridanus side farther from the Sun than the Orion side. Unlike previous Kompaneets model fits that required abnormally small scale heights for the Galactic disk (< 40 pc), we find morphologically consistent models with scale heights of 80 pc, similar to that expected for the Galactic disk.

40|$|State {{estimation}} techniques serve {{effectively to}} provide mean state estimates. However, the state error covariance matrices provided {{as part of}} these techniques suffer from some degree of {{lack of confidence in}} their ability to adequately describe the uncertainty in the estimated states. A specific problem with the traditional form of state error covariance matrices is that they represent only a mapping of the assumed observation error characteristics into the state space. Any errors that arise from other sources (environment modeling, precision, etc.) are not directly represented in a traditional, theoretical state error covariance matrix. First, consider that an actual observation contains only measurement error and that an estimated observation contains all other errors, known and unknown. Then it follows that a measurement residual (the difference between expected and observed measurements) contains all errors for that measurement. Therefore, a direct and appropriate inclusion of the actual measurement residuals in the state error covariance matrix of the estimate will result in an empirical state error covariance matrix. This empirical state error covariance matrix will fully include all of the errors in the state estimate. The empirical error covariance matrix is determined from a literal reinterpretation of the equations involved in the weighted least squares estimation algorithm. It is a formally correct, empirical state error covariance matrix obtained through use of the average form of the weighted measurement residual variance performance index rather than the usual total weighted residual form. Based on its formulation, this matrix will contain the total uncertainty in the state estimate, regardless as to the source of the uncertainty and whether the source is anticipated or not. It is expected that the empirical error covariance matrix will give a better, statistical representation of the state error in poorly modeled systems or when sensor performance is suspect. In its most straight forward form, the technique only requires supplemental calculations to be added to existing batch estimation algorithms. In the current problem being studied a truth model making use of gravity with spherical, J 2 and J 4 terms plus a standard <b>exponential</b> type <b>atmosphere</b> with simple diurnal and random walk components is used. The ability of the empirical state error covariance matrix to account for errors is investigated under four scenarios during orbit estimation. These scenarios are: exact modeling under known measurement errors, exact modeling under corrupted measurement errors, inexact modeling under known measurement errors, and inexact modeling under corrupted measurement errors. For this problem a simple analog of a distributed space surveillance network is used. The sensors in this network make only range measurements and with simple normally distributed measurement errors. The sensors are assumed to have full horizon to horizon viewing at any azimuth. For definiteness, an orbit at the approximate altitude and inclination of the International Space Station is used for the study. The comparison analyses of the data involve only total vectors. No investigation of specific orbital elements is undertaken. The total vector analyses will look at the chisquare values of the error in the difference between the estimated state and the true modeled state using both the empirical and theoretical error covariance matrices for each of scenario...|$|R

The spatial-temporal distribution of released particles in the initial regime is described on the basis of self-similar solutions of Euler's equations. In the case of transition to the diffusion regime an approximate solution of the kinetic equation with the collision integral in the form of BGK is performed. Gravitation and the atmospheric inhomogeneity are taken into account, The diffusion regime is described by an analytic solution of the diffusion equation in an <b>exponential</b> <b>atmosphere</b> taking account of possible losses of the gas due to chemical reactions. Some peculiarities of the expansion of various gases as well as the possibility of applying the model for describing ionospheric 'holes' are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Multiple {{observations}} of Blue Jets (BJ)) show that BJ emits {{a fan of}} streamers similar to a laboratory leader. Moreover,in the <b>exponential</b> <b>atmosphere</b> those long streamers grow preferentially upward, producing a narrow coneconfined by the aperture angle. It was also noticed that BJ {{are similar to the}} streamer zone of a leader (streamer corona) and the modeling studies based on the streamers fractal structure were conducted. Objective {{of this paper is to}} study the fractal dimension of the bunch of streamer channels emitted by BJ, at different altitude and under the varying reduced electric field. This similarity analysis has been done in three steps: First we described the dendritic structure of streamers in corona discharge applying the fractal theory. Then using this model and the data from existing laboratory experiments we obtained the fractal dimension of the branching streamer channels. Finally the model was validated by the {{observations of}} BJ available from the literature...|$|E
40|$|The gravity {{field of}} Venus has been modeled by a spherical {{harmonic}} {{expansion of the}} potential to degree and order seven. The estimates of these coeficients were obtained by combining information from 43 short arcs (4 hr) of line-of-sight Doppler data centered at periapsis. The data arcs were distributed in longitude and time over more than two circulations of Venus by the Pioneer Venus Orbiter subperiapsis point which was confined to the band of latitudes from 14 deg N to 17 deg N. Convergence of the solution has been assured by iterating upon the initial estimate. All estimates were performed with zero a priori information on the gravity coefficients. Since the altitude of periapsis {{for most of the}} orbits was within the sensible Venusian atmosphere, drag effects on the estimated harmonics have been removed using an <b>exponential</b> <b>atmosphere</b> density model. Estimates of the mass parameter (GM) of Venus using this dataset are also evaluated...|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} {{has been made}} of atmosphere entries for which the vehicle lift-drag ratio was modulated to maintain specified maximum decelerations and/or maximum deceleration rates. The part of the vehicle drag polar used during modulation was from maximum lift coefficient to minimum drag coefficient. The entries were at parabolic velocity and the vehicle maximum lift-drag ratio was 0. 5. Two-dimensional trajectory calculations were made for a nonrotating, spherical earth with an <b>exponential</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> The results of the analysis indicate that for a given initial flight-path angle, modulation generally resulted in a reduction of the maximum deceleration to 60 percent of the unmodulated value or a reduction of maximum deceleration rate to less than 50 percent of the unmodulated rate. These results were equivalent, for a maximum deceleration of 10 g, to lowering the undershoot boundary 24 miles with a resulting decrease in total convective heating to the stagnation point of 22 percent. However, the maximum convective heating rate was increased 18 percent; the maximum radiative heating rate and total radiative heating were each increased about 10 percent...|$|E
40|$|A three-impulse, aero-assisted {{maneuver}} is used {{to change}} the plane of a circular orbit. The guidance law used during the atmospheric phase {{is based on the}} repetitive use of an approximate optimal control law. The approximations include Loh's term being constant, an <b>exponential</b> <b>atmosphere,</b> and a constant-coefficient drag polar. Whereas the true optimal trajectory is flown at maximum lift-to-drag ratio, simulation results for a parabolic drag polar show the angle of attack becoming large {{near the end of the}} trajectory. Here, the approximate optimal control rule is developed for an elliptic polar which has maximum lift coefficient and higher values of the drag coefficient at high values of the lift coefficient than the parabolic polar. Simulation results show that the angle of attack still increases to high values near the end of the trajectory and that, overall, the parabolic drag polar produces better results. Finally, it is shown that Loh's term is not constant over the ascent portion of the atmospheric turn and is the probable cause of high angles of attack. However, the guidance laws developed by assuming Loh's term to be constant work well...|$|E
40|$|At optical wavelengths, Titan's {{brightness}} {{for large}} Sun-Titan-observer phase angles significantly exceeds its dayside brightness. The brightening that occurs near back-illumination {{is due to}} moderately large haze particles in the moon's extended atmosphere that forward-scatter the incident sunlight. Motivated by this phenomenon, here we investigate the forward scattering from currently known exoplanets, its diagnostics possibilities, the observational requirements to resolve it, and potential implications. An analytical expression is derived {{for the amount of}} starlight forward-scattered by an <b>exponential</b> <b>atmosphere</b> that takes into account the finite angular size of the star. We use this expression to tentatively estimate how prevalent this phenomenon may be. Based on numerical calculations that consider exoplanet visibility, we identify numerous planets with predicted out-of-transit forward scattering signals of up to tens of parts-per-million provided that aerosols of $>$ 1 micron size form over an extended vertical region near the optical radius level. We propose that the interpretation of available optical phase curves should be revised to constrain the strength of this phenomenon that might provide insight into aerosol scale heights and particle sizes. For the relatively general atmospheres considered here, forward scattering reduces the transmission-only transit depth by typically less than the equivalent to a scale height. For short-period exoplanets the finite angular size of the star severely affects the amount of radiation scattered towards the observer at mid-transit. Comment: 20 pages; In press, MNRAS.

40|$|In {{order to}} test the {{hypothesized}} existence of a powerful, thermal wind in active galactic nuclei, the hydrodynamic effects of such a wind on a model galactic interstellar medium (ISM) are investigated. The properties of several model ISMs are derived from observations of the Milky Way's ISM and those of nearby spiral and elliptical galaxies. The wind {{is assumed to be}} highly supersonic with spherical symmetry and constant mechanical luminosity, L(W). The propagation of the wind into the low density gas component of the ISM is studied using the Kompaneets approximation of a strong explosion in an <b>exponential</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> Flattened gas distributions are shown to experience "blow-out" of wind gas along the symmetry axis. The results show that for typical ISM gas pressures (10 ⁷ yrs.). The physical structure and motion of the clouds are calculated, showing that large clouds (10 ³ solar masses) can be accelerated to velocities in excess of the galactic escape velocity. Finally, it is proposed that the Narrow Emission Line Regions (NELR) of active galaxies are the result of the interaction of active nuclei photons and a thermal wind on large, interstellar clouds. The physical state of the NELR is re-examined and shown to be compatible with this hypothesis. Arguments are presented to show that the NELR clouds must be massive and unable to be accelerated to NELR velocities by photon momentum alone. A Monte Carlo-type calculation is made to determine Narrow Emission Line profiles from an ensemble of photoionized interstellar clouds in the wind. These theoretical line profiles are shown to agree reasonably well with observed line profiles...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the stability of}} a planar accelerating shock front in an <b>exponential</b> <b>atmosphere,</b> a situation that can be described by a self-similar solution. A previous linear instability analysis showed {{that there are three}} regimes, depending on the wavelength of the perturbation along the direction of the shock front: at long wavelengths the shock is unstable, at intermediate wavelengths it is overstable, and at short wavelenghts it is stable, where the characteristic length is set by the initial density scale height. We have carried out numerical simulations of such an accelerating shock front and have confirmed the results of the semianalytic linear analysis in the linear regime. In the nonlinear regime, the evolution again depends on the three wavelength domains. At long wavelengths, the instability continuously grows but the flow remains smooth, and at short wavelengths, the flow is stable. The intermediate wavelength, overstable regime shows more complex evolution. The growing linear oscillations saturate soon after entering the nonlinear regime and the oscillations continue with the same approximate period. The shock front develops moving points of intersection, which generate weak shock fronts and density and pressure structure in the immediate postshock flow. The density fluctuations, with a contrast of a factor of 2 - 3, become frozen into the downstream flow. The growth of the instability is slow, so substantial initial perturbations are needed; thesemay be present in Type II supernovae with red supergiant progenitor stars which have outer convective regions. The clumping in the outer supernova atmosphere may affect spectral line formation and {{may play a role in}} the formation of fast knots...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{considers}} the numerical solution of minimax problems of optimal control (also called Chebyshev problems) arising in the reentry {{of a space}} glider. First, a transformation technique is employed in order to convert minimax problems of optimal control into the Mayer-Bolza problem of the calculus of variations. The transformation requires the proper augmentation of the state vector x(t), the control vector u(t), and the parameter vector (pi), {{as well as the}} proper augmentation of the constraining relations. As a result of the transformation, the unknown minimax value of the performance index becomes a component of the vector parameter being optimized. The transformation technique is then applied to the following Chebyshev problems of interest in the reentry of a space glider: (Q 1) minimization of the peak dynamic pressure; and (Q 2) minimization of the peak heating rate. A new way of studying the problem of reentry is presented which decomposes the problem into two subproblems: Problem (R) and Problem (S). Problem (R) consists of optimizing the subsystem which defines the longitudinal motion and includes the relations due to the transformation of the Chebyshev problem. This problem, also called the primary problem, is solved as a Mayer-Bolza problem and yields the solution for the performance index and the controls determining the trajectory. Problem (S), also called the secondary problem, reduces to the determination of the switching times for the bank angle, so as to meet the remaining boundary conditions. Numerical results are obtained by means of the sequential gradient-restoration algorithm for solving optimal control problems on a digital computer. Reference is made to the hypervelocity regime, an <b>exponential</b> <b>atmosphere,</b> and a space glider whose trajectory is controlled by means of the angle of attack and the angle of bank...|$|E
40|$|We have {{performed}} {{a series of}} two-dimensional and three-dimensional simulations of asteroid impacts into an ocean using the SAGE code from Los Alamos National Laboratory and Science Applications International Corporation. The SAGE code is a compressible Eulerian hydrodynamics code using continuous adaptive mesh refinement for following discontinuities with a fine grid while treating {{the bulk of the}} simulation more coarsely. We have used realistic equations of state for the atmosphere, sea water, the oceanic crust, and the mantle. In two dimensions, we simulated asteroid impactors moving at 20 km/s vertically through an <b>exponential</b> <b>atmosphere</b> into a 5 km deep ocean. The impactors were composed of mantle material (3. 32 g/cc) or iron (7. 8 g/cc) with diameters from 250 m to 10 km. In our three-dimensional runs we simulated asteroids of 1 km diameter composed of iron moving at 20 km/s at angles of 45 and 60 degrees from the vertical. All impacts, including the oblique ones, produce a large underwater cavities with nearly vertical walls followed by a collapse starting from the bottom and subsequent vertical jetting. Substantial amounts of water are vaporized and lofted high into the atmosphere. In the larger impacts, significant amounts of crustal and even mantle material are lofted as well. Tsunamis up to a kilometer in initial height are generated by the collapse of the vertical jet. These waves are initially complex in form, and interact strongly with shocks propagating through the water and the crust. The tsunami waves are followed out to 100 km from the point of impact. Their periods and wavelengths show them to be intermediate type waves, and not (in general) shallow-water waves. At great distances, the waves decay as the inverse of the distance from the impact point, ignoring sea-floor topography. For all impactors smaller than about 2 km diameter, the impacting body is highly fragmented and its remains lofted into the stratosphere with the water vapor and crustal material, hence very little trace of the impacting body should be found for most oceanic impacts. In the oblique impacts, the initial asymmetry of the transient crater and crown does not persist beyond a tsunami propagation length of 50 km...|$|E

At {{issue is whether}} the mass extinctions, and this horizon has an impact versus volcanic origin. A critical feature of the Alvarez hypothesis is {{the suggestion that the}} bolide or possibly a shower of objects delivered to the earth approx. 0. 6 x 10 to the 18 th power g of material which resulted in aerosol-sized ejecta such that global insolation was drastically reduced for significant periods. Such an event would lower temperatures on continents and halt photosynthesis in the upper 200 m of th eocean. The latter would strangle the marine food chain and thus produce the major marine faunal extinctions which mark the C-T boundary. Crucial issues examined include: What are the dynamics of atmospheric flow occurring upon impact of a large bolide with the earth; What is the size distributions of the very fine impact ejecta and how do these compare to the models of ejecta which are used to model the earth's radiative thermal balance. The flow field due to passage of a 10 km diameter bolide through an <b>exponential</b> <b>atmosphere</b> and the interaction of the gas flow and bolide with the solid ear was calculated. The CO 2 released upon impact onto shallow marine carbonate sections was modeled and found that the mass of CO 2 released exceeds the present 10 to the 18 th power g CO 2 budget of the earth's atmosphere by several times. Using the calculations of Kasting and Toon it was found that to compute the temperature rise of the earth's surface as a function of CO 2 content, it was found that sudden and prolonged global increases are induced from impact of 20 to 50 km radius projectiles and propose that sudden terrestrial greenhouse-induced heating, not cooling, produced the highly variable extinctions seen at the C-T boundary...|$|E
