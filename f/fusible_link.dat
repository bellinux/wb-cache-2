25|$|Large power fuses use fusible {{elements}} made of silver, copper or tin {{to provide}} stable and predictable performance. High voltage expulsion fuses surround the <b>fusible</b> <b>link</b> with gas-evolving substances, such as boric acid. When the fuse blows, {{heat from the}} arc causes the boric acid to evolve large volumes of gases. The associated high pressure (often greater than 100 atmospheres) and cooling gases rapidly quench the resulting arc. The hot gases are then explosively expelled out of the end(s) of the fuse. Such fuses can only be used outdoors.|$|E
2500|$|This {{technology}} is not new, however. [...] In the 1800s, glass fire grenades filled with suppressant liquids were popular. [...] These glass fire grenade bottles are sought by collectors. [...] Some later brands, such as Red Comet, {{were designed for}} passive operation, and included a special holder with a spring-loaded trigger that would break the glass ball when a <b>fusible</b> <b>link</b> melted. [...] As was typical of this era, some glass extinguishers contained the toxic carbon tetrachloride.|$|E
5000|$|An {{electrical}} <b>fusible</b> <b>link</b> {{is a type}} {{of electrical}} fuse that is constructed simply with a short piece of wire typically four American wire gauge sizes smaller than the wire that is being protected. For example, an AWG 16 <b>fusible</b> <b>link</b> might be used to protect AWG 12 wiring. Electrical fusible links are common in high-current automotive applications. The wire in an electrical <b>fusible</b> <b>link</b> is encased in high-temperature fire-resistant insulation to reduce hazards when the wire melts.|$|E
5000|$|There exists an {{extremely}} thick basaltic reinforced concrete pad under the RPV that will both catch and hold any heated core melt that might fall on that pad in extraordinarily contingent situations. In addition, {{there are several}} <b>fusible</b> <b>links</b> within the wall separating the wetwell from the lower drywell that flood the pad using the wetwell's water supply, ensuring cooling of that area even with the failure of standard mitigation systems.|$|R
50|$|In the {{possible}} {{event of a}} fire, an operating attic fan could, in theory, spread the flames because of the air movement. To reduce the danger, louvered vents that allow air to pass through can incorporate <b>fusible</b> <b>links</b> so that fire will melt the links {{in which case the}} vent will automatically close. In addition, an automatic cutoff switch can be set up to turn off power to the fan if it detects a temperature above a preset limit.|$|R
5000|$|The matrix {{layout of}} a {{crossbar}} switch {{is also used}} in some semiconductor memory devices. Here the [...] "bars" [...] are extremely thin metal [...] "wires", and the [...] "switches" [...] are <b>fusible</b> <b>links.</b> The fuses are blown or opened using high voltage and read using low voltage. Such devices are called programmable read-only memory. At the 2008 NSTI Nanotechnology Conference a paper was presented which discussed a nanoscale crossbar implementation of an adding circuit used {{as an alternative to}} logic gates for computation.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{extension}} cords also incorporate safety {{features such as}} a polarized plug and receptacle, grounded terminals, a [...] "power-on" [...] indicator, a <b>fusible</b> <b>link,</b> or even a residual-current device (also known as a ground-fault circuit interrupter or GFCI).|$|E
50|$|Designed as {{a defense}} against torch attacks, these are simply relocking devices {{equipped}} with a <b>fusible</b> <b>link</b> designed to melt and release the relocking device if the temperature inside the door exceeds a certain temperature (usually 65 °C), as would happen in a torch attack.|$|E

50|$|Fire dampers are fitted where {{ductwork}} {{passes through}} fire compartment walls / fire curtains {{as part of}} a fire control strategy. In normal circumstances, these dampers are held open by means of <b>fusible</b> <b>links.</b> When subjected to heat, these links fracture and allow the damper to close {{under the influence of the}} integral closing spring. The links are attached to the damper such that the dampers can be released manually for testing purposes. The damper is provided with an access door in the adjacent ductworks for the purpose of inspection and resetting in the event of closure.|$|R
50|$|The WCAM-1 {{does not}} use a {{variable}} ratio auto-transformer in AC mode like the others; it uses a fixed-ratio transformer and rectifier bank to convert the OHE supply to 1500VDC. The design of the transformers and notches makes this a hard machine to operate, with the <b>fusible</b> <b>links</b> tending to blow often. Of the 28 notches, notches 4, 14, 21, and 28 {{can be used for}} continuous operation, although notch 4 was intended for low-speed shunting and is very ineffective. Notches 14, 21, and 28 are the terminal notches of the series, series-parallel, and parallel circuit notch sequences. In DC mode, the WCAM-1 uses resistor banks for speed control.|$|R
40|$|Rotary release {{mechanism}} includes <b>fusible</b> rotary <b>link</b> made of alloy that melts at relatively low temperature of 60 degrees C. When solid, link couples driving shaft to driven shaft. When necessary, link melted to temporarily decouple two shafts. Upon cooling below melting temperature link hardens, so it once again couples two shafts. Release mechanism extremely compact alternative to pyrotechnic release device. Basic concept applied to such other mechanisms as pin pullers, pin pushers, electrical-disconnection mechanisms, and clutches...|$|R
5000|$|A {{thermal fuse}} is a cutoff {{which uses a}} {{one-time}} <b>fusible</b> <b>link.</b> Unlike a thermal switch which may automatically reset itself when the temperature drops, the thermal fuse is more like an electrical fuse: a single-use device that cannot be reset and must be replaced when it fails or is triggered. A thermal fuse is used when the overheating {{is a result of}} a rare occurrence, such as failure requiring repair (which would also replace the fuse) or replacement at the end of service life.|$|E
50|$|A {{mechanical}} <b>fusible</b> <b>link</b> is {{a device}} {{consisting of two}} strips of metal soldered together with a fusible alloy {{that is designed to}} melt at a specific temperature, thus allowing the two pieces to separate. Mechanical fusible links are utilized as the triggering device in fire sprinkler systems and mechanical automatic door release mechanisms that close fire doors in warehouses, etc. Some high-security safes also utilize fusible link-based relockers as a defense against torches and heat-producing tools. Mechanical fusible links {{come in a variety of}} designs and different temperature ratings.|$|E

50|$|The defrost {{mechanism}} in a refrigerator heats the cooling element (evaporator coil) {{for a short}} period of time and melts the frost that has formed on it. The resulting water drains through a duct at the back of the unit. Defrosting is controlled by an electric or electronic timer: For every 6, 8, 10, 12 or 24 hours of compressor operation it turns on a defrost heater for 15 minutes to half an hour. The defrost heater, having a typical power rating of 350 W to 600 W, is mounted just below the evaporator in top- and bottom-freezer models and below and sometimes also in the middle of the evaporator in side-by-side models. It may be protected from short circuits by means of <b>fusible</b> <b>links.</b> In older refrigerators the timer ran continuously. In newer designs the timer only runs while the compressor runs, so the more the refrigerator door is closed, the less the heater will be on and the more energy will be saved. A defrost thermostat opens the heater circuit when the evaporator temperature rises above a preset temperature, 40°F (5°C) or more, thereby preventing excessive heating of the freezer compartment. The defrost timer is such that either the compressor or the defrost heater is on, but not both at the same time.|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} project was to develop capacitive and piezoresistive silicon pressure sensors with on-chip signal processing. The technological basis was a 3 #mu#m standard CMOS process to which the processes required for the fabrication of the sensor structures were adapted. The signal electronics for both sensor variants {{are based on the}} same circuit concept: it consists of a band-gap reference-voltage source and an SC circuit (switched capacitor circuit) that amplifies the voltage {{in the case of the}} piezoresistive sensors and converts the change in capacity to a change in voltage in the case of the capacitive sensors. The source of excitation and the SC circuit are electronically programmable so that the output signal, offset voltage and temperature-dependence of these parameters can be selectively adjusted. The calibration coefficients can be stored in a shift register or in non-volatile fashion using <b>fusible</b> <b>links.</b> The output signal of the sensors ranges from 1. 2 V (zero pressure) to 5 V (FSO), the operating temperature from - 25 C to 125 C. The temperature-related change in the output signal in this temperature range amounts to less than 2 % FSO in the case of piezoresistive sensor. The operating voltage of the sensors ranges from 8 V to 12 V. The chip area of the sensors is about 52 mm" 2 (capacitive sensor) and 28 mm" 2 (piezoresistive sensor). In addition, a capacitive pressure sensor made of Al_ 2 O_ 3 ceramics has been developed. On the inside the sensor has a measuring capacitor, a reference capacitor and an additional capacitor for linearization that is wired into the feedback branch of an SC differential path amplifier developed for this application. The electrode structures are made with thick-film technology. The linearity error of the sensor amounts to #+-# 0. 12 % at 2 bars, the output-signal deviation of the evaluation circuitry to 4 VSIGLEAvailable from TIB Hannover: F 93 B 1277 +a / FIZ - Fachinformationszzentrum Karlsruhe / TIB - Technische InformationsbibliothekBundesministerium fuer Forschung und Technologie (BMFT), Bonn (Germany) DEGerman...|$|R
50|$|Roller-shutter {{fire doors}} - that are {{activated}} by building alarm systems or local smoke detectors must close automatically when signaled regardless of power. In case of power outage the coiling fire door {{does not need}} to close, but must be capable of automatic closing when given a signal from the building alarm systems or smoke detectors. A temperature sensitive <b>fusible</b> <b>link</b> may be employed to hold the fire doors open against gravity or a closing spring. In case of fire, the link melts and releases the doors, and they close.|$|E

The heat from a fire pops the link and water suppresses the fire. There is also an alarm that works without a battery & intended to suppress (not fully extinguish) a Christmas tree fire and sound an alarm to get people out of the house alive. (Winner) ...|$|E
5000|$|The general {{function}} of a release mechanism {{is shown in figure}} 2, using the example of a <b>fusible</b> <b>link</b> release, a patented mechanism. [...] Prior to release, the lever (A) is held in the closed position by a fusible wire (B). To trigger the release, a jolt of electricity of approx. 14 kW is passed through the fusible wire, causing it to melt or evaporate in {{a matter of a few}} milliseconds. The lever is now free to open (by the force of the instrument flotation), releasing the anchor or other release line (C).|$|E
5000|$|Originally, {{mixtures}} of oil distillates such as gasoline, diesel fuel, lacquer thinner or kerosene {{were used in}} solvent-based manually operated parts washers, but these are highly volatile and can ignite easily, potentially leading to an explosion and severe burns to the workers. For this reason, the solvent-based [...] "tub" [...] washer typically has a large cover that is propped open by a lead <b>fusible</b> <b>link.</b> In {{the event of a}} fire, the lead will melt and the cover will slam shut to snuff out the fire before it can cause further damage to the building...|$|E
50|$|Fire dampers can {{be found}} in the same places as smoke dampers, {{depending}} on the application of the area after the firewall. Unlike smoke dampers, they are not triggered by any electrical system (which is an advantage in case of an electrical failure where the smoke dampers would fail to close). Vertically mounted fire dampers are gravity operated, while horizontal fire dampers are spring powered. A fire damper's most important feature is a mechanical <b>fusible</b> <b>link</b> which is a piece of metal that will melt or break at a specified temperature. This allows the damper to close (either from gravity or spring power), effectively sealing the duct, containing the fire, and blocking the necessary air to burn.|$|E
50|$|Some high-security safes {{use what}} is called a glass relocker. It is a piece of {{tempered}} glass mounted between the safe door and the combination lock. It has wires attached to the edges. These wires lead to randomly located, spring-loaded bolts. If an attempt is made to penetrate the safe, the penetrating drill or torch breaks the glass and releases the bolts. These bolts block the retraction of the main locking bolts. To drill a safe with a glass relocker, side, top, or rear drilling may be necessary. Many modern high-security safes also incorporate thermal relockers in conjunction with glass-based relockers (usually a <b>fusible</b> <b>link</b> as part of the relocker cabling), which also activate when the temperature of a safe exceeds a certain level as a defense against torches and thermal lances.|$|E

A sample of 150 fusible links {{were tested in}} a hot air wind tunnel with procedure following international testing standards. The <b>fusible</b> <b>link</b> samples were loaded under 0. 4 kgf. The working section of the tunnel was set at air temperature of 135 °C and air speed of 2. 54 ms- 1. Response time index was deduced.

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{predictability}} of sprinkler response time for a confined ceiling, thermal properties of sprinkler and environment of sprinklers below a confined ceiling during fire are discussed. Significance of the heat loss from the <b>fusible</b> <b>link</b> of a sprinkler by conduction and a method of estimating {{the response of the}} link to external radiation are shown. Measurements of temperature, velocity, radiation, and sprinkler response time below a ceiling are made in a confined enclosure. The measured temperature and velocity are found to be close to previous theory for an unconfined ceiling if a correction for the existence of smoke layer is applied. Finally measured sprinkler response time is compared with calculation based on measured temperature, velocity and radiation history. The result shows the significance of radiation from the fire source in the determination of sprinkler response time. key words: sprinkler, response time, heat loss, ceiling jets, radiation...|$|E

To extinguish the fire in the forest-fire spot quickly and effectively, a self-triggering fire-extinguishing bomb fuze sensor is designed, and which properties are simulation and analysis.

Therefore, it has good application value to protect the safety of life and property indeed. ...|$|E
40|$|An {{automatic}} {{sprinkler system}} {{is one of}} the most effective methods of controlling or suppressing the fire. Sprinklers are generally located at the ceiling level of the level of a• building. They are equipped with a <b>fusible</b> <b>link</b> that melts when the heat given off by a fire heats the sprinkler. Currently there is no sprinklers system that installed in UMP (Universiti Malaysia Pahang) lecture room. In this project by using CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) a simulation of fire occurred is created to prove the effect of sprinkler in one of the lecture room (Block Y-BK 8). For this simulation, assume that the fire happen due to shock circuit at personal computer. Now from CFD, simulation required finding out boundary condition in that room like power output of lamp and PC. Also air flow rate by air conditioner and sprinkler. From the result of simulation, the sprinkler system is effective if the fire occurred in the lecture room. As a conclusion, a sprinkler system can be installed as a precaution at the lecture room...|$|E
