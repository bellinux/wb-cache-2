The rope by which this machinery was wrought was generally carried within the bedchamber, it being Foster's object to provide against invasion from without; but now that it was intended to secure the prisoner within, the cord had been brought over to the landing-place, and was there made fast, when Foster with much complacency had dropped the unsuspected trap-door.|$|E
50|$|Even if {{the demands}} for low {{tolerances}} of the wire and the winding space had to be observed with correspondingly high technical effort, there would still remain the problem that the wire guiding on the machine side has to follow the previously described winding design also at <b>high</b> <b>winding</b> speeds. In practice, this is hardly possible at <b>high</b> <b>winding</b> speeds since, e.g., at 18.000 windings per minute, the wire guide for a wire with a thickness of 0.3 mm would need to perform a winding pitch in only 0.7 ms. The problem is amplified {{by the fact that}} in practice the ideal wire is never absolutely straight. These unevennesses and bends resulting from the winding of the wire on delivery rolls have the effect that the wires are never completely close together according to their actual diameter but at a distance according to their unevenness.|$|E

50|$|Segmented {{stator coils}} are used, for example, if a <b>high</b> <b>winding</b> number is {{required}} {{in addition to the}} demanded high fill factor and the corresponding orthocyclic winding. They are preferably processed with the flyer-winding technique {{as well as with the}} linear-winding technique. For this type of stator construction, it is particularly beneficial to produce accurately layered windings with extremely high fill factors because of the freely accessible winding space. However, the design of the segmented stator coils has negative repercussions on the material and production costs. Often, complex processes need to be applied in order to form the single teeth to a round stator. Another disadvantage constitutes in the large number of contact points, except when the pole-chain winding technique is used.|$|E

When the fundamental quark density is comparable to the adjoint quark density, the phase transition becomes a third order one.

40|$|Abstract- The {{fractional}} slots tooth concentrated windings {{are characterized}} with high space MMF harmonics which results to undesirable effects on electric machine, such as localised core saturation, {{eddy current loss}} in the rotor and noise and vibration. A new and high efficiency method is {{presented in this paper}} to reduce simultaneously the sub- and high MMF harmonics of these winding types. The method is based on doubling the number of stator slots, using two identical winding systems connected in series and shifted to each other for a specific angle, using stator core with different tooth width and using different turns per coil for the neighbouring phase coils. With the proposed technique the unwanted sub- and <b>high</b> <b>winding</b> MMF harmonics can be reduced or completely canceled...|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that multipartite entanglement {{is able to}} characterize one-dimensional topological order, which is witnessed by the scaling behavior of the quantum Fisher information of the ground state {{with respect to the}} spin operators defined in the original and dual lattices. We investigate an exactly-solvable long-range extended spin- 1 / 2 Ising model with nontrivial Z-symmetry topological order identified equivalently by winding numbers and paired Majorana zero modes at each end. For topologically ordered phases with <b>high</b> <b>winding</b> numbers, we can define a Z topological invariant by the scaling coefficient of the dual quantum Fisher information density. Containing richer properties and more complex structures than bipartite entanglement, the dual multipartite entanglement of the topologically ordered state has promising applications in robust quantum computation and quantum metrology, and could be generalized to higher-dimensional systems.

However, because of small modulations caused by faults and high noise contamination, {{it is difficult to}} quantify the modulation in measured signals which is dominated by the supply frequency, higher order harmonics and noise. In this paper a modulation signal bispectrum (MSB) is investigated to detect stator winding faults. This type of fault can cause <b>high</b> <b>winding</b> temperatures which may effect on current signal so motor temperature will be considered in this paper. The results show that MSB has the capability to accurately estimate modulation degrees and suppress the random and non-modulation components. The test results show that MSB has a better performance in differentiating spectrum amplitudes due to stator faults, and hence produces better diagnosis performance, compared with that of conventional power spectrum analysis...|$|E

40|$|We study {{straight}} vortices {{with global}} longitudinal currents in the Bogomolny {{limit of the}} Abelian Higgs model with two charged scalar fields. The model possesses global SU(2) and local electromagnetic U(1) symmetries spontaneously broken to a global U(1) group, and corresponds to a semilocal limit of the standard electroweak model. We show that {{the contribution of the}} global SU(2) current to the vortex energy is proportional to the total current squared. Locally, these vortices carry also longitudinal electromagnetic currents, while the total electromagnetic current flowing through a transverse section of the vortex is always zero. The vortices with <b>high</b> <b>winding</b> numbers have, in general, a nested pipelike structure.

40|$|A {{new type}} of particle-loaded {{membrane}} adsorber module was prepared by coiling adsorptive fibers. In order to characterize the material and predict the module performance, the protein accessibility and mass flux of single fibers were tested in incubation experiments. The coil's layout spacing and winding tension are useful parameters for tailoring the module for stabilization, polishing, or pharmaceutical applications. Decreasing the distance between two adjacent fibers during the coiling process affects the flow resistance and the dynamic adsorption capacity of the module. Higher flow resistance creates a higher convective flow through the fibers resulting in faster adsorption processes. Exerting a <b>high</b> <b>winding</b> tension causes fiber deformation, resulting in modules with high packing density. The feed flow is then forced through the fibers to a greater extent, thereby reducing the diffusive distance to the active sites located {{in the interior of}} the fiber, which results in steeper breakthrough curves and better ligand utilization...|$|E

This paper describes a more accurate approach of demagnetization assessment based on 2 -D transient finite-element analysis. It is shown that due {{to the presence of}} low-order space harmonics in the fractional-slot IPM machine, the demagnetization risks across all pole pairs are different. Compared with the distributed wound machine, the fraction-slot machine is less vulnerable to demagnetization due to relatively <b>high</b> <b>winding</b> inductance, although its demagnetized regions are not uniform in each pole. It is also shown that although the demagnetizing current of one 3 -phase short-circuit (SC) is greater than that of 6 -phase SC, the resultant demagnetization risk is lower than that of 6 -phase SC in the fractional-slotmachine...|$|E
