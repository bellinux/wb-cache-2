25|$|Other {{work has}} focused on {{predicting}} the gene expression levels in a gene regulatory network. The approaches used to model gene regulatory networks have been constrained to be interpretable and, as a result, are generally simplified versions of the network. For example, Boolean networks have been used due to their simplicity and ability to handle noisy data but lose data information by having a binary representation of the genes. Also, artificial neural networks omit using a <b>hidden</b> <b>layer</b> {{so that they can}} be interpreted, losing the ability to model higher order correlations in the data. Using a model that is not constrained to be interpretable, a more accurate model can be produced. Being able to predict gene expressions more accurately provides a way to explore how drugs affect a system of genes as well as for finding which genes are interrelated in a process. This has been encouraged by the DREAM competition which promotes a competition for the best prediction algorithms. Some other recent work has used artificial neural networks with a <b>hidden</b> <b>layer.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{need for}} deep {{learning}} with real-valued inputs, as in Gaussian restricted Boltzmann machines, {{led to the}} spike-and-slab RBM (ssRBM), which models continuous-valued inputs with strictly binary latent variables. Similar to basic RBMs and its variants, a spike-and-slab RBM is a bipartite graph, while like GRBMs, the visible units (input) are real-valued. The difference is in the <b>hidden</b> <b>layer,</b> where each hidden unit has a binary spike variable and a real-valued slab variable. A spike is a discrete probability mass at zero, while a slab is a density over continuous domain; their mixture forms a prior.|$|E

Boz also drew a comparison between Urmuz and the morose poems of George Bacovia, arguing that they both send the reader on [...] "tragic explorations" [...] and [...] "journeys to the underworld".

The theoretical proto-Surrealism of such works, which places less importance on their topical humor, has generated a long debate between scholars later in the 20th century: some have denied Urmuzian Surrealism, whereas others have continued to identify him as the earliest Romanian Surrealist.|$|E

5000|$|French (1991) [...] {{proposed}} that catastrophic interference arises in feedforward backpropagation networks {{due to the}} interaction of node activations, or activation overlap, that occur in distributed representations at the <b>hidden</b> <b>layer.</b> Specifically, he defined this activation overlap as the average shared activation over all units in the <b>hidden</b> <b>layer,</b> calculated by summing the lowest activation of the nodes at the <b>hidden</b> <b>layer</b> and averaging this sum. For example, if the activations at the <b>hidden</b> <b>layer</b> from one input are (0.3, 0.1, 0.9, 1.0) and the activations from the next input are (0.0, 0.9, 0.1, 0.9) the activation overlap would be (0.0 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.9 [...] ) / 4 = 0.275. When using number|binary representation of input vector|vectors, activation values will be 0 through 1, where 0 indicates no activation overlap and 1 indicates full activation overlap. French noted that neural networks which employ very localized representations do not show catastrophic interference {{because of the lack}} of overlap at the <b>hidden</b> <b>layer.</b> That is to say, each input pattern will create a <b>hidden</b> <b>layer</b> representation that involves the activation of only one node, so differed inputs will have an activation overlap of 0. Thus, he suggested that reducing the value of activation overlap at the <b>hidden</b> <b>layer</b> would reduce catastrophic interference in distributed networks. Specifically he {{proposed that}} this could be done through changing the distributed representations at the <b>hidden</b> <b>layer</b> to 'semi-distributed' representations. A 'semi-distributed' representation has fewer hidden nodes that are active, and/or a lower activation value for these nodes, for each representation, which will make the representations of the different inputs overlap less at the <b>hidden</b> <b>layer.</b> French recommended that this could be done through 'activation sharpening', a technique which slightly increases the activation of a certain number of the most active nodes in the <b>hidden</b> <b>layer,</b> slightly reduces the activation of all the other units and then changes the input-to-hidden layer weights to reflect these activation changes (similar to error backpropgation). Overall the guidelines for the process of 'activation sharpening' are as follows: ...|$|E

We demonstrate that the SHL-MDNN can reduce errors by 3 - 5 %, relatively, for all the languages decodable with the SHL-MDNN, over the monolingual DNNs trained using only the language specific data. Further, we show that the learned <b>hidden</b> <b>layers</b> sharing across languages can be transferred to improve recognition accuracy of new languages, with relative error reductions ranging from 6 % to 28 % against DNNs trained without exploiting the transferred <b>hidden</b> <b>layers.</b> It is particularly interesting that the error reduction can be achieved for the target language that is in different families of the languages used to learn the <b>hidden</b> <b>layers.</b> Index Terms — {{deep neural network}}, CD-DNN-HMM, multilingual speech recognition, multitask learning, transfer learning 1...|$|R

What these mean is that due to the random initialization of weights and backpropagating errors one layer at a time, the weights learn at different speeds.

30|$|To apply ANN, a {{multi-layer}} perceptron is {{chosen for the}} network {{as it has been}} highly successful in forecasting models. The architecture of the neural network involves the number of input and output neurons, the number of layers, the number of neurons in each layer, the connectivity of layers, and the transfer function in each layer.

A classification problem occurs when an object needs to be assigned in predefined classes based on a number of observed attributes related to that object.

Designing an efficient FNN structure with optimum number of <b>hidden</b> <b>layers</b> and minimum number of layer's neurons, given a specific application or dataset, is an open research problem.
