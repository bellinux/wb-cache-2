Mary Jane Blanchard, daughter of murder victim Josephine Ross, {{was one of the}} first dissenters, being quoted in 1946 as saying:I cannot believe that young Heirens murdered my mother. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>does</b> not fit into the picture of my mother's death... I have looked at all the things Heirens stole and there was nothing of my mother's things among them.|$|E

As Locke goes to the beach to get shovels, Sayid follows him and asks what really killed Eko. Locke says that the {{survivors}} call it [...] "The Monster", and further speculates that The Monster may be what brought them there and that Eko died for a reason, <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>does</b> {{not know what it}} is yet. After the burial, Locke sees a message on Eko's stick: [...] "Lift up your eyes and look north, John 3:05".|$|E
500|$|Vernon was sampled {{on another}} {{song from the}} album, [...] "Lost in the World" [...] and appears on vocals on [...] "Monster". While there during {{recording}} sessions, he had reportedly recorded 10 tracks. He watched Minaj record her verse, and he too, expressed admiration for Minaj's performance on the song, however he noted that initially {{he had no idea}} who she was. Vernon described the process as highly artistic, stating that the fourteen-hour day recording schedule allowed for a lot of fun and creativity. West, talking about recording the song with Vernon, stated that he was [...] "similar to me, where <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>does</b> shit just so people would be like, 'Oh shit, how did you do that? How did that happen?' He's just a really cool guy to be around." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sullivan {{hosted a}} second {{appearance}} by Presley on October 28, 1956. Elvis performed [...] "Don't Be Cruel", then [...] "Love Me Tender". Sullivan then addressed {{the audience as}} he stood beside Elvis, who began shaking his legs, eliciting screams from the audience. By the time Sullivan turned his head, Elvis was standing motionless. After Presley left the stage, Sullivan stated, [...] "I can’t figure this darn thing out. You know. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>does</b> this [...] and everybody yells." [...] Elvis appeared a second time in the show and sang [...] "Love Me". Later on, he sang a nearly four-minute-long version of [...] "Hound Dog" [...] and was shown in full the entire song.|$|E
2500|$|Simons noted height was {{a factor}} in the length Sharma bowled, saying [...] "For Ishant to hit the stumps, he has to pitch it fuller, and that means the batsman has more chance of keeping it out". Former West Indies fast bowler Courtney Walsh {{identified}} two problems with Sharma's bowling action: his head drops when the ball is delivered and the position of his wrist varies. The first takes some of the speed out of the delivery, while the second reduces the chance of the ball seaming and swinging. The former India batsman Sanjay Manjrekar suggested that the lack of movement in Sharma's bowling discouraged him from pitching the ball up so instead he tends to bowl short. The slower pace of his bowling when he pitches the ball up may explain why the yorker is not an effective delivery for him. Manjrekar went further, saying that [...] "for all his talent and commitment <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>does</b> not take enough wickets"; when the remark was made in January 2012, Sharma had a bowling average of nearly 37 from 43 Tests.|$|E

He's gone to Maria Port's, {{and he may}} bring her back with him, married tight and fast, for all you or me knows. It would be just like his sailor fashion. When the captain's got {{anything}} to do <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>does</b> it sharp and quick." ...|$|E

5000|$|Temple Brooks Gault - The {{killer of}} the victims in the book. Uses the alias Hilton Sullivan. Being {{described}} by Benton Wesley as being [...] "off the charts.

2500|$|Bassist Jerry Scheff, who backed Orbison in his [...] concert, {{wrote about}} him, [...] "Roy Orbison {{was like an}} opera singer.

50|$|Safdar is {{the most}} active and Imran's most trusted field partner. The best thing Imran likes about Safdar is that he never {{questions}} his authority, he, actually, {{is a man of}} action rather than words. This {{does not necessarily mean that}} he is not intelligent, <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>does</b> not like to get into unnecessary arguments and gives his 110% towards the completion of the task assigned to him.|$|E

Fred does not believe him, so Spike admits that <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>does</b> not want anyone else to know what he is going through. Fred assures him that they will figure things out.|$|E
5000|$|Lowery has a lisp, {{which gives}} him a {{distinctive}} delivery. According to Lowery, [...] "A lot of fans will say, 'Oh, <b>he's</b> <b>just</b> <b>doing</b> that to make it up.'

50|$|This {{last point}} of view is very much {{resembling}} Hanslick's opinion. It is therefore not surprising that Liszt and Hanslick were not enemies. Whenever they met they did it with nearly friendly manners. In fact, Hanslick never denied that he considered Liszt as composer of genius. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>did</b> not like some of Liszt's works as music.|$|R

Daly confronts Torres about Grogan, and he confesses to his involvement in the scheme, explaining that <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>does</b> not care anymore about right and wrong.|$|E
5000|$|The British {{television}} network Channel 4 {{called it the}} [...] "least satisfying screen adaptation of Hecht and MacArthur's play," [...] saying it [...] "adds little to the mix other than a bit of choice language. The direction is depressingly flat and stagy, Wilder running on empty. While {{it is easy to}} see why he was attracted to this material [...] [...] [...] <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>does</b> not seem to have the energy here to do it justice. Matthau and Lemmon put in their usual faultless turns, but cannot lift a pervading air of pointlessness." ...|$|E
5000|$|After the race, Zayat commented: [...] "I said it {{once and}} more than once that this race was only about American Pharoah - we wanted him to go out as a winner just for the horse. He had run so hard and brilliantly {{for such a long}} time. I doubt we will ever see a horse who is able to take what he has done in terms of {{shipping}} in and out and going to seven or eight different tracks. He doesn't care about the surface or where he is sitting, <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>does</b> it all." ...|$|E
5000|$|Later that night, {{the fighters}} engage in {{drinking}} again, and Taylor gets very drunk and deliberately urinates his pants {{inside of the}} house.

5000|$|Hill {{acknowledges}} {{the influence of}} his idol former Australian football coach Tom Hafey: “Tommy Hafey was exceptional … He was definitely a disciplined person. He doesn't have to be told what to do. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>does</b> it because he believes in it. I remember {{some of the things}} he organised that were virtually unheard of elsewhere”.Hill also cited the influence of former Sydney Swans coach Paul Kelly, saying [...] "What he was able to achieve at the Swans was exceptional ... and it seems to be an ongoing legacy. He wasn't one of those coaches who gets in, does what's best for him at the time and then leaves - and leaves nothing." ...|$|E

50|$|It is also {{important}} to understand that the processes of the SMA and PMC are done unconsciously. The SMA and PMC consider the many alternative actions many milliseconds before the chosen action takes place. The person is never consciously aware of these alternative possibilities the brain has juggled with before he picks it up with the right hand; <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>does</b> it. The action of picking up the glass with the right hand is also performed unconsciously. It may be preferable to use his right hand because he is right handed and doing so is therefore more comfortable or perhaps the glass is placed on his right side and the possibility that expends the least amount of energy is using the right hand to pick it up.|$|E
5000|$|Screenwriter Mike White {{regards the}} novel as [...] "part of a {{literary}} trend {{that goes back to}} Goethe's The Sorrows of Werther (1774) ... I don't think Salinger discovered it. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>did</b> the quintessential American version." [...] He thought the influence of the novel may rise in Hollywood, and two of his 2002 films reflect this. In Orange County, protagonist Shaun searches for the professor who wrote the book that changed his life.|$|R
