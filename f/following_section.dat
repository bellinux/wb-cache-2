5|$|The {{original}} Lincoln Highway in Omaha {{was designated}} through Omaha in 1913. Crossing the Missouri River into Omaha {{on the old}} Douglas Street Bridge, it traveled west on Dodge Street, then meandered across the state <b>following</b> <b>section</b> lines. Some of these sections were built exclusively to accommodate the highway. Important buildings on the Lincoln Highway in Omaha included the Hupmobile Building, the Nash Building at 902-912 Farnam and 901-911 Douglas streets, and the Blackstone Hotel at Farnum Street and 36th Street.

5|$|By 1932, US-36 {{headed west}} from Norton toward Oberlin instead of {{southwest}} toward Selden, {{and all of}} what is K-383 became part of US-83. The entire route from Selden to Nebraska had been straightened, mostly paralleling the railroad instead of <b>following</b> <b>section</b> lines, except for through Oronoque and Jennings. US-83 was a gravel road from Selden to the NortonPhillips county line, east of which the highway remained a dirt road until it was graveled in 1937. The highway was relocated straight through Jennings and to a path with fewer turns through Oronoque in 1938; that same year, the highway was paved with a bituminous surface along the US-36 concurrency. US-83 was paved from the US-36 split to the Nebraska state line in 1940. The highway was paved from Selden to Dresden by 1945 and from Dresden to US-36 west of Norton in 1948. US-383 {{was assigned to the}} entire length of the K-383 corridor and beyond in both directions by 1945.|$|E

5|$|On February 26, 1927, the New York City Board of Estimate awarded and {{approved}} a $10,481,550 contract to the Patrick McGovern Company. Ground was broken at Vernon Boulevard and 44th Drive in Long Island City on April 2, 1927. The first contract for work entirely within Queens {{was given to}} the Atwell-Gustin-Morris Company by the New York City Board of Transportation on December 14, 1927. The contract covered the section of the line under Jackson Avenue between the junction with the under-construction Crosstown Line near Queen Street and 44th Drive. The section between Arch Street and Steinway Avenue was awarded to the W.G.T. Construction Company, which required moving the support pillars for the elevated IRT Flushing Line to the sides of the street. Triest Construction Company was awarded the next segment, which was between Queen Street and the intersection of Northern Boulevard and 37th Street. The <b>following</b> <b>section</b> was awarded to J.F. Cogan Company, which was required to build the section between the intersection of Steinway Street and Broadway and the intersection of 53rd Street and Northern Boulevard. The remainder of the line was called Route 108, and it was divided into six sections. The first section, between 53rd Street and Pettit Place via Broadway went to Atwell-Gustin-Morris Company, while the section between along Broadway and Queens Boulevard from Pettit Place and 55th Avenue went to George H. Flynn Company. The sections between 55th Avenue and 64th Road and from 64th Road to 71st Road went to Arthur A. Johnson. The final two sections were from 71st Road to Union Turnpike, and from 137th Street to Hillside Avenue.|$|E
