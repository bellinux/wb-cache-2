5|$|In 1678 the Manche Ch'ol {{population}} was devastated by disease; {{in the area}} around the town of San Lucas Tzalac it killed every child under six years old and almost all of those under the age of ten. Total deaths, including adults, numbered over 400 and the epidemic prompted all the Manche Ch'ol in the affected region to abandon the mission towns and flee <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest.</b> The Spanish made a number of further attempts to pacify the Manche Ch'ol, but these were ultimately unsuccessful, and the Manche Ch'ol rebelled in 1689. In that year many Manche Ch'ol were forcibly relocated to the Urrán Valley in the highlands, resulting in the abandonment of many of the Manche orchards; this eventually led to the collapse of the regional trade network that by then had been fully linked with colonial Guatemala and supplied it with unknown quantities of cacao.|$|E
