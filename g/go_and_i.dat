I waited a bit and then I attacked and I caught him and the break. Then I went off by myself. I {{was going to win}} Paris–Roubaix. At the entrance to the vélodrome, there were crowds everywhere, blocking the way. I looked around for where to <b>go</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was directed round the outside wall of the track, to where the team cars had to park. It wasn't like nowadays, when there's television and everything. Then it was more chaotic and the whole road was blocked. People said I should have known the way into the track. But how do you know a thing like {{that at the end of}} Paris–Roubaix, when you've raced all day over roads like that? A gendarme signalled the way to go and that's the way I went.|$|E

500|$|The casting of Bonneville, McInnerny, McKee, Chambers, and Ifans as Will's {{friends was}} [...] "rather like {{assembling}} a family". Michell explained that [...] "When you are casting a cabal of friends, {{you have to}} cast a balance of qualities, of types and of sensibilities. They were the jigsaw {{that had to be}} put together all in one <b>go,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think we've got a very good variety of people who can realistically still live in the same world." ...|$|E

500|$|Five full {{companies}} of Minutemen and five more of militia from Acton, Concord, Bedford and Lincoln occupied this hill as more groups of men streamed in, totaling at least 400 against [...] Captain Laurie's light infantry companies, a force totaling 90–95 men. Barrett ordered the Massachusetts men to form one long line two abreast {{on the highway}} leading down to the bridge, and then he called for another consultation. While overlooking North Bridge {{from the top of}} the hill, Barrett, Lt. Col. John Robinson of Westford and the other Captains discussed possible courses of action. [...] Captain Isaac Davis of Acton, whose troops had arrived late, declared his willingness to defend a town not their own by saying, [...] "I'm not afraid to <b>go,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> haven't a man that's afraid to go." ...|$|E
500|$|This {{was quickly}} {{followed}} by [...] "Third Day of a Seven Day Binge". Manson {{said that the}} recording of the album [...] "just became a rhythm. This was something I was excited to do." [...] This is {{in stark contrast to}} the recording of The High End of Low (2009) and Born Villain, when he was frequently [...] "dragged into the studio" [...] late at night to record vocals. He credited this enthusiasm to the collaborative process between him and Bates, saying that he realized after the first performance of [...] "Birds of Hell Awaiting" [...] that [...] " [...] just sang it. I didn't even know where the music was going to <b>go</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> just went with it and it was very organic. And then it opened up a whole different part of my mind." ...|$|E
500|$|Urey {{speculated that}} the early {{terrestrial}} atmosphere was probably composed of ammonia, methane, and hydrogen. One [...] of his Chicago graduate students was Stanley L. Miller, who showed in the Miller–Urey experiment that, if such a mixture be exposed to electric sparks and water, it can interact to produce amino acids, commonly considered {{the building blocks of}} life. Work with isotopes of oxygen led to pioneering the new field of paleoclimatic research. In 1958, he accepted a post as a professor at large at the new University of California, San Diego (UCSD), where he helped create the science faculty. He was one of the founding members of UCSD's school of chemistry, which was created in 1960. He became increasingly interested in space science, and when Apollo 11 returned moon rock samples from the moon, Urey examined them at the Lunar Receiving Laboratory. [...] Lunar astronaut Harrison Schmitt said that Urey approached him as a volunteer for a one-way mission to the Moon, stating [...] "I will <b>go,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't care if I don't come back." ...|$|E

500|$|McEntire {{has often}} been {{regarded}} as one of country music's most influential female vocalists and most beloved entertainers. She is highly credited for remaining one of country's most popular female artists for nearly four decades, maintaining her success by continually incorporating contemporary musical sounds without changing her traditional vocal style. For many new artists, she has been credited as the inspiration to their careers in country music, including Faith Hill, Martina McBride, Trisha Yearwood, and LeAnn Rimes. She has also been credited as an inspiration to other performers such as Sara Evans, Kelly Clarkson, Lee Ann Womack, Terri Clark, Taylor Swift, and Carrie Underwood, The Net Music Countdown second-handedly reported, [...] "That influence has manifested itself in many ways. As a role model, she's shown others how to handle fame with grace and good humor while never backing down from her values or goals. Just as importantly, she's shown others to refuse to accept limitations on what she can do or how much she can achieve." [...] McEntire also explained to the online website, [...] "Whatever I'm doing, I feel like I'm representing country music". [...] "It's always been my main career, and it's where my loyalties lie. I feel like I'm waving the flag of country music wherever I <b>go,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> couldn't be prouder to do it." ...|$|E
500|$|However, in January 2012, Heigl {{stated in}} an {{interview}} that she has asked the producers if she could return to the show to give closure to Izzie's storyline: [...] "I've told them I want to ," [...] she said. [...] "I really, really, really want to see where [...] is. I just {{want to know what happened}} to her and where she went and what she's doing now. My idea is that she actually like figures it out, and finds some success and does really well in a different hospital. She was always floundering you know, and so she was always one step behind the eight ball and I want to see that girl take some power back." [...] She later went on to say that she regrets leaving the show, [...] "Oh yeah, sometimes, yeah. You miss it. I miss my friends. It was a great work environment ... and it becomes a family. I spent six years together with these people every day ... you grow up together, in a way," [...] and again commented on Izzie possibly returning to the show, [...] "I always felt that if they wanted me to come back and sort of wrap up that storyline ... I want them to know that I'm down with it if they want me to, but I completely understand if it doesn't necessarily work ... They've got a lot of story lines going on there." [...] But in March 2012, Shonda Rhimes said that there are no plans at the moment for the character to return, [...] "I think it was really nice to hear her appreciating the show. At the same time we are on a track we have been planning. The idea of changing that track is not something we are interested in right now." [...] Three years later, Rhimes said she has completely moved on from the idea of Izzie coming back, “I’m done with that story. I’ve turned that idea over in my mind a thousand times and thought about how it would <b>go.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> don’t think so.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Mel {{has been}} dubbed as a chameleon, and Outhwaite has {{suggested}} that she liked to bring variation to Mel's characterisation: [...] "When I arrived I liked the idea Mel was feisty and strong. I didn't want her turning into a wimpy character like so many women in soaps. You know, they're either bitches or they're slags or they're victims. I wanted to give Mel a bit of everything. Every woman has all those elements to their character. It's just working out where they come and <b>go,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't think that's lack of continuity; I think that's a three-dimensional character." ...|$|E

Darnell said, [...] "I actually had compassion for the guy. I thought, wow, what a way to <b>go.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> could understand why he did it. He sold out for the money and the comfort, I guess the very things that had brought him into the underworld."

2500|$|In {{regards to}} his {{contract}} issues with Liverpool, Gerrard {{told the press}} after the final, [...] "How can I leave after a night like this?" [...] but negotiations soon stalled and on 5 July 2005, after Liverpool turned down another lucrative offer from Chelsea, Gerrard's agent Struan Marshall informed Liverpool chief executive Rick Parry that Gerrard was rejecting a club-record £100,000-a-week offer. Parry conceded the club had lost Gerrard, saying, [...] "Now {{we have to move}} on. We have done our best, but he has made it clear he wants to <b>go</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think it looks pretty final." [...] The next day, Gerrard signed a new four-year deal as Parry blamed the earlier breakdown of talks on miscommunication between the two sides. Gerrard stated upon signing the contract that he would rather win one premier league medal than win multiple titles at Chelsea as it would mean more to him.|$|E

2500|$|I am Mesha, son of Chemosh-gad, king of Moab, the Dibonite. My father reigned over Moab thirty years, and I have reigned {{after my}} father. And I have built this {{sanctuary}} for Chemosh in Karchah, a sanctuary of salvation, for he saved me from all aggressors, {{and made me}} look upon all mine enemies with contempt. Omri was king of Israel, and oppressed Moab during many days, and Chemosh was angry with his aggressions. His son succeeded him, and he also said, I will oppress Moab. In my days he said, Let us <b>go,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will see my desire upon him and his house, and Israel said, I shall destroy it for ever. Now Omri took the land of Madeba, and occupied it in his day, and {{in the days of}} his son, forty years. And Chemosh had mercy on it in my time. And I built Baal-meon and made therein the ditch, and I built Kiriathaim. And the men of Gad dwelled in the country of Ataroth from ancient times, and the king of Israel fortified Ataroth. I assaulted the wall and captured it, and killed all the warriors of the city for the well-pleasing of Chemosh and Moab, and I removed from it all the spoil, and offered it before Chemosh in Kirjath; and I placed therein the men of Siran, and the men of Mochrath. And Chemosh said to me, Go take Nebo against Israel, and I went in the night and I fought against it from the break of day till noon, and I took it: and I killed in all seven thousand men, but I did not kill the women and maidens, for I devoted them to Ashtar-Chemosh; and I took from it the vessels of Jehovah, and offered them before Chemosh. And the king of Israel fortified Jahaz, and occupied it, when he made war against me, and Chemosh drove him out before me, and I took from Moab two hundred men in all, and placed them in Jahaz, and took it to annex it to Dibon. I built Karchah the wall of the forest, and the wall of the Hill. I have built its gates and I have built its towers. I have built the palace of the king, and I made the prisons for the criminals within the wall. And there were no wells in the interior of the wall in Karchah. And I said to all the people, ‘Make you every man a well in his house.’ And I dug the ditch for Karchah with the chosen men of Israel. I built Aroer, and I made the road across the Arnon. I took Beth-Bamoth for it was destroyed. I built Bezer for it was cut down by the armed men of Daybon, for all Daybon was now loyal; and I reigned from Bikran, which I added to my land. And I built Beth-Gamul, and Beth-Diblathaim, and Beth Baal-Meon, and I placed there the poor people of the land. And as to Horonaim, the men of Edom dwelt therein, on the descent from old. And Chemosh said to me, Go down, make war against Horonaim, and take it. And I assaulted it, And I took it, for Chemosh restored it in my days. Wherefore I made......year...and I....|$|E
