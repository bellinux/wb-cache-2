5|$|Cooper {{was born}} on January 5, 1975, in Philadelphia, {{and grew up in}} the nearby {{communities}} of Jenkintown and Rydal. His mother, Gloria (née Campano), worked for the local NBC affiliate. His father, Charles Cooper, who died in January 2011, worked as a stockbroker for Merrill Lynch. Charles Cooper was of Irish descent, while Gloria Cooper is of Italian ancestry (from Abruzzo and Naples). Cooper has an older sister, Holly. He was raised as a Roman Catholic. He had cholesteatoma <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>ear</b> soon after his birth, and punctured his eardrum when he started diving at an early age.|$|E
5|$|Their mission completed, Gabe and Lian {{call in the}} U.S. Army Chemical and Biological Defense Command (CBDC) {{to secure}} the area. They {{do not know how}} far Markinson was {{cooperating}} with Rhoemer and Phagan, but Gabe believes they may never know. In a post-credits scene, Aramov approaches a mysterious man inside the Agency headquarters and whispers something <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>ear.</b> He congratulates her while the camera pulls back to show PharCom boxes in the office.|$|E
5|$|In June 1560, Michel de l'Hôpital was {{appointed}} Chancellor of France. He sought {{the support of}} France's constitutional bodies and worked closely with Catherine to defend {{the law in the}} face of the growing anarchy. Neither saw the need to punish Protestants who worshipped in private and did not take up arms. On 20 August 1560, Catherine and the chancellor advocated this policy to an assembly of notables at Fontainebleau. Historians regard the occasion as an early example of Catherine's statesmanship. Meanwhile, Condé raised an army and in autumn 1560 began attacking towns in the south. Catherine ordered him to court and had him imprisoned as soon as he arrived. He was tried in November, found guilty of offences against the crown, and sentenced to death. His life was saved by the illness and death of the king, as a result of an infection or an abscess <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>ear.</b>|$|E

25|$|Baldr was ceremonially burnt {{upon his}} ship, Hringhorni, {{the largest of}} all ships. As he was carried to the ship, Odin whispered <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>ear.</b> This {{was to be a}} key riddle asked by Odin (in disguise) of the giant Vafthrudnir (and which was, of course, unanswerable) in the poem Vafthrudnismal. The riddle also appears in the riddles of Gestumblindi in Hervarar saga.|$|E
25|$|In September 1997, an Israeli Mossad team {{tried to}} assassinate Hamas {{political}} chief Khaled Mashal by drizzling poison <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>ear.</b> The attempt failed, {{and two of}} the agents were captured while others took refuge in the Israeli embassy in Amman. Nasrallah's second-in-command Imad Mughniyah was assassinated in February 2008 in a Damascus bomb blast. Hezbollah accused Israel of responsibility for the explosion, although Israel denied responsibility for the act. Nasrallah's predecessor Abbas al-Musawi was killed in an Israeli airstrike in southern Lebanon in 1992.|$|E
25|$|After the {{operation}} MGR's voice changed. Since {{he had been}} shot <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>ear</b> MGR lost hearing in his left ear and had ringing in the ear problems. These further surfaced in 1983 when he had kidney problems. When Sinnappa Devar paid his first visit to see MGR at the hospital after the shooting incident he paid MGR an advance for the next MGR's movie. After getting released from the hospital and finishing Arasakattalai MGR acted in Devar's movie Vivasaayee against doctors' advice. Due to {{the operation}}, MGR's speaking parts in the movie Kaavalkaaran were reduced. This was the only movie MGR spoke with old and new voices between scenes: MGR was acting in the film Kaavalkaran in 1967 opposite J. Jayalalithaa when the shooting occurred.|$|E

25|$|When the {{national}} capital was moved inland to Chongqing, Zou continued his attacks on Chiang, then moved to the relative safety of Hong Kong, which {{he was forced to}} leave when the Japanese took the city in December 1941. Since he would not be welcomed in Chongqing, he first stayed in a village on the Guangdong-Guanxi border, then for a time with the New Fourth Army in northern Jiangsu. Although he suffered from a painful infection <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>ear,</b> he lectured widely and continued his activities in the communist held areas. By the end of 1942, however, while keeping an upbeat tone in his publications, Zou realized that the initial stages of optimistic unity had ended, that the Nationalist government was using terrorist repression, and that the common people were not necessarily well-informed or enthusiastic about fighting Japan.|$|E
25|$|The Preaching of the Antichrist {{was painted}} {{shortly after the}} {{execution}} of Savonarola in Florence on 23 May 1498. This friar had been judged guilty of heresy, and the Antichrist, preaching slander and calumny, is causing an uproar such as Savonarola did. The Antichrist is depicted resembling Christ, but is embraced by the Devil whispering <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>ear.</b> Among the crowd listening to the Antichrist Signorelli has painted some remarkable figures: a young Raphael in a striking pose, Dante, possibly Christopher Columbus, Boccaccio, Petrarch and Cesare Borgia. Remarkably, in the left corner of the fresco, he has painted himself, dressed in noble garments, and Fra Angelico in habit. In the left background the Antichrist is being chased from heavens by the archangel Michael, and his acolytes being killed by a rain of fire. In the right background he depicts a large Classical temple topped by a dome in Renaissance style. More likely is that the scenes reflect scripture readings {{called for in the}} liturgies for the Feast of All Saints and the four Sundays of Advent.|$|E
500|$|Cooper retires {{to bed at}} {{his hotel}} room, and {{experiences}} a strange dream featuring the one-armed man, who identifies himself as MIKE, and BOB, who vows to [...] "kill again". Cooper then dreams {{he is in a}} room hung with red curtains. The Man from Another Place (Michael J. Anderson) and Laura Palmer speak to him in a jarring and disjointed manner, before Laura leans over to whisper <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>ear.</b> Cooper wakes up, telephones Harry, and declares that he knows who the murderer is.|$|E

500|$|At Stoke, Matthews {{found himself}} playing Second Division {{football}} {{for the first}} time in 28 years. Despite Stoke being strapped for cash, Tony Waddington gave him a two-year contract at £50 a week – this was double the wages he received at Blackpool. The signing was broadcast live on Sportsweek, as Waddington whispered <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>ear</b> [...] "Welcome home, Stan. For years this club has been going nowhere. Now we're on our way". Waddington delayed his return debut until 24 October 1961, when Stoke played Huddersfield Town at the Victoria Ground, the attendance was 35,974 – more than treble the previous home game – and Matthews set up one of City's goals in a 3–0 win. He went on to score three goals in 21 games in the rest of the 1961–62 campaign.|$|E
500|$|The common starling's {{gift for}} mimicry {{has long been}} recognised. In the medieval Welsh Mabinogion, Branwen tamed a common starling, [...] "taught it words", and sent it across the Irish Sea with a message to her brothers, Bran and Manawydan, who then sailed from Wales to Ireland to rescue her. Pliny the Elder claimed that these birds could be taught to speak whole {{sentences}} in Latin and Greek, and in Henry IV, William Shakespeare had Hotspur declare [...] "The king forbade my tongue to speak of Mortimer. But I will find him when he is asleep, and <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>ear</b> I'll holler 'Mortimer!' Nay I'll have a starling shall be taught to speak nothing but Mortimer, {{and give it to}} him to keep his anger still in motion." ...|$|E
500|$|Polonius forces Ophelia {{to return}} Hamlet's love letters and tokens of affection to the prince {{while he and}} Claudius watch from afar to {{evaluate}} Hamlet's reaction. Hamlet is walking alone in the hall as the King and Polonius await Ophelia's entrance, musing whether [...] "to be or not to be". When Ophelia enters and tries to return Hamlet's things, Hamlet accuses her of immodesty and cries [...] "get thee to a nunnery," [...] though {{it is unclear whether}} this, too, is a show of madness or genuine distress. His reaction convinces Claudius that Hamlet is not mad for love. Shortly thereafter, the court assembles to watch the play Hamlet has commissioned. After seeing the Player King murdered by his rival pouring poison <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>ear,</b> Claudius abruptly rises and runs from the room: proof positive for Hamlet of his uncle's guilt.|$|E

500|$|In {{his last}} months, Fauré {{struggled}} {{to complete a}} string quartet. Twenty years earlier {{he had been the}} dedicatee of Ravel's String Quartet. Ravel and others urged Fauré to compose one of his own. He refused for many years, {{on the grounds that it}} was too difficult. When he finally decided to write it, he did so in trepidation, telling his wife, [...] "I've started a Quartet for strings, without piano. This is a genre which Beethoven in particular made famous, and causes all those who are not Beethoven to be terrified of it." [...] He worked on the piece for a year, finishing it on 11 September 1924, less than two months before he died, working long hours towards the end to complete it. The quartet was premiered after his death; he declined an offer to have it performed privately for him in his last days, as his hearing had deteriorated to the point where musical sounds were horribly distorted <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>ear.</b>|$|E
500|$|On {{the evening}} of 21 July 2013 – when Jones was 16 – he dressed in female {{clothing}} and attended a dance party with Keke and Khloe called Henessey Sundays, held at a bar in the Irwin area. They arrived by taxi at around 2am. Jones passed as a girl at the party, and several males danced with him. Although he initially kept his biological sex a secret from others at the party, fearing homophobic persecution, he revealed his identity to a girl {{with whom he had}} previously been to church. The girl informed her male friends, who accosted him outside the venue, demanding to know, [...] "Are you a woman or a man?" [...] One of the men used a lantern to examine Jones' feet, claiming that they were too large to be those of a biological woman. Discovering his sex, they started calling him [...] "batty boy" [...] and other homophobic epithets. Khloe {{tried to get him to}} avoid confrontation, whispering <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>ear,</b> [...] "Walk with me, walk with me", but Jones refused, instead insisting to those assembled that he was female.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Don't Bother" [...] {{was directed by}} Jaume de Laiguana, who had previously collaborated with Shakira on the video for [...] "No", and was released on 15 November 2005. The video begins with a man parking his sports {{car in front of}} a house and proceeding to enter it. Shakira is seen lying on a bed {{in the house and the}} man comes up and lies beside her, indicating that they are a couple. As soon as the man falls asleep, Shakira wakes up and lies atop the man and begins to caress him and bite and whisper <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>ear</b> a few times, although he does not wake up. Shakira takes the keys of the man's car and drives it to a wrecking yard. The video then interludes to scenes of Shakira sexually romancing the man in a shower. The scene then changes back to the wrecking yard, where Shakira begins playing a pink guitar. After the spoken bridge of the song, Shakira places her partner's car in a car crusher, which soon commences demolishing it. The man reacts in a similar manner to the car being crushed and begins experiencing continuous body jerks and spasms, indicating a connection between his car and his body. After the car is fully destroyed, Shakira leaves the man unconscious on the bed, exits the house, and begins walking on the street triumphantly. Shakira explained the usage of the car symbolism in the video, saying that [...] "A man's car is like an extension of their ego and their manhood. I thought this would be a video that would make women say, 'Yeah, yeah!' and it would make men feel".|$|E

2500|$|In 1988, {{when talking}} {{about the effects of}} {{coaching}} fast bowlers, Geoffrey Boycott commented, [...] "Remember what happened to Graham Dilley, who started out as a genuinely quick bowler.

2500|$|In October 1997, Benjamin Netanyahu, then in {{his first}} term as Prime Minister of Israel, came to visit Kaduri at his synagogue and was {{recorded}} as whispering <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>ear</b> [...] "the left has forgotten {{what it is to be}} a Jew". This was considered as a divisive action and resonated in the press.|$|E
2500|$|On September 11, 2001, it was Card who famously {{approached}} Bush as he {{was visiting}} Emma E.

Card later recounted his story, saying that he whispered [...] "A second plane has hit the second tower. America is under attack." ...|$|E
