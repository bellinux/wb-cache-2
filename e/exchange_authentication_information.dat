40|$|The {{development}} of mobile devices (CPU, memory, and storage) {{and the introduction}} of mobile networks (Ad-Hoc, Wi-Fi, WiMAX, and 3. 5 G) have opened new opportunities for next generation of mobile services. It becomes more convenience and desirable for mobile internet users to be connected everywhere. However, ubiquitous mobile access connectivity faces interoperation issues between wireless network providers and wireless network technologies. Although mobile users would like to get as many services as possible while they travel, {{there is a lack of}} technology to identify visited users in current foreign network authentication systems. This challenge lies in the fact that a foreign network provider does not initially have the authentication credentials of a mobile user. Existing approaches use roaming agreement to <b>exchange</b> <b>authentication</b> <b>information</b> between home network and foreign network. This paper proposes a roaming agreement-less approach designed based on our ubiquitous mobile access model. Our approach consist of two tokens, Passport (identification token) and Visa (authorisation token) to provide the mobile user with a flexible authentication method to access foreign network services. The security analysis indicates that our proposal is more suitable for ubiquitous mobile communication especially in roaming agreement-less environment...|$|E
50|$|PEAP {{is similar}} in design to EAP-TTLS, {{requiring}} only a server-side PKI certificate to create a secure TLS tunnel to protect user authentication, and uses server-side public key certificates to authenticate the server. It then creates an encrypted TLS tunnel between the client and the authentication server. In most configurations, the keys for this encryption are transported using the server's public key. The ensuing <b>exchange</b> of <b>authentication</b> <b>information</b> inside the tunnel to authenticate the client is then encrypted and user credentials are safe from eavesdropping.|$|R
40|$|Identity federations enable users, service providers, and {{identity}} providers from different organizations to <b>exchange</b> <b>authentication</b> and authorization <b>information</b> in a secure way. In this paper, {{we present a}} novel identity federation architecture for cloud services based on the integration of a cloud identity management service with an authentication, authorization, and accounting infrastructure. Specifically, we analyse how this type of authentication, authorization, and accounting–based federation can be smoothly integrated into OpenStack, the leading open source cloud software solution, using the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Application Bridging for Federated Access Beyond web specification for authentication and authorization. We provide details of the implementation undertaken in GÉANT's CLASSe project and show its validation in a real testbed...|$|R

50|$|Because of the {{important}} to take measures against covert observation {{in order to prevent}} <b>authentication</b> <b>information</b> from being stolen, Secret tap method proposes a technique that do not expose the <b>authentication</b> <b>information</b> during entry, even if other individuals try to view the input process. Additionally, {{it should be noted that}} the risk of covert observation is not restricted to direct observation by other individuals, camera recordings also pose a threat. Therefore, it is necessary to make the authentication process more complex in order to prevent <b>authentication</b> <b>information</b> from being stolen even if cameras and/or other individuals observe the information input process numerous times. There are two types of shoulder-surfing attack: direct observation attacks, in which <b>authentication</b> <b>information</b> is obtained by a person who is directly monitoring the authentication sequence, and recording attacks, in which the <b>authentication</b> <b>information</b> is obtained by recording the authentication sequence for later analysis.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we present}} the design, implementation, and {{software}} testing of USBSec, a secure {{extension of the}} vanilla USB protocol that incorporates host authentication to defend against software threats.

The peripheral validates the <b>authentication</b> <b>information</b> against its own list of authorized host keys. If both sides can validate each other, standard USB enumeration continues otherwise the connection is terminated. We have implemented a fully working prototype of USBSec based on USB implementation in Linux kernel and our experimental results demonstrate its practicality and effectiveness. I...|$|R
