30|$|For {{combination}} products containing <b>fenpropidin</b> or fenpropimorph (FRAC group G 2) {{together with}} DMI fungicides (FRAC group G 1) all determined MDR values fell clearly above 1 {{with regard to}} algal growth inhibition, but not with regard to acute toxicity towards Daphnia or fish. Fungicides from both groups (G 1 and G 2) belong to the larger group of sterol biosynthesis inhibitors (SBI fungicides) but they inhibit different key enzymes in the ergosterol biosynthesis of fungi. G 2 fungicides inhibit to various degrees Δ 14 -reductase and Δ 8 -Δ 7 -isomerase, while G 1 fungicides inhibit C 14 -demethylase. The exact molecular site of action of SBI fungicides, particularly <b>fenpropidin</b> and fenpropimorph, in algae is not known currently.|$|E
30|$|The algal {{toxicity}} of the fungicidal combination products {{in question was}} rather high (EC 50 below 1 mg ∑ a.s./L in many cases), which underlines the potential environmental relevance of this finding. It {{is interesting to note}} that algae were the most sensitive organisms not only for the combination products but mostly also for the individual a.s. present in these products. In contrast to the finding for the previously discussed herbicidal products, the {{toxicity of}} these individual fungicidal a.s. was very high for the same organisms that were most sensitive for the products (i.e., algae). This means, that formulation additives would need to be highly toxic to algae to notably contribute to the overall mixture toxicity to algae. Taking all this evidence together, it appears unlikely that formulation additives were the reason for the underestimation of the algal toxicity of products containing <b>fenpropidin</b> or fenpropimorph. In agreement with this is the observation that the algal toxicity of the mono-formulation (expressed in content a.s.) and the technical a.s. differed by less than factor 3 for fenpropimorph (no information for such a comparison is available for <b>fenpropidin).</b> This leaves as possible explanation a synergistic interaction between some members of subgroups of SBI fungicides, particularly those from the subgroups G 2 and G 1, in algae. Yet, this evidence of synergism between the G 1 and G 2 subgroups of SBI fungicides is based on a database analysis only and would certainly need experimental verification and further elucidation of the modes of actions of these fungicides in algae. Likewise, the lack of evidence for synergism between the G 2 fungicide spiroxamine and DMI fungicides remains to be explained by further investigations. Based on the extensive review of Belden et al. [15] and own literature research, neither <b>fenpropidin,</b> fenpropimorph, or spiroxamine together with DMI fungicides have so far been explicitly tested for their mixture toxicity.|$|E
40|$|Few {{data sets}} of {{pesticide}} volatilization from plants {{at the field}} scale are available. In this work, we report measurements of <b>fenpropidin</b> and chlorothalonil volatilization on a wheat field using the aerodynamic gradient (AG) method and an inverse dispersion modeling approach (using the FIDES model). Other data necessary to run volatilization models are also reported: measured application dose, crop interception, plant foliage residue, upwind concentrations, and meteorological conditions. The comparison of the AG and inverse modeling methods proved the latter to be reliable and hence suitable for estimating volatilization rates with minimized costs. Different diurnal/nocturnalvolatilizationpatternswereobserved:fenpropidin volatilization peaked on the application day and then decreased dramatically, while chlorothalonil volatilization remained fairly stable over a week-long period. Cumulated emissions after 31 h reached 3. 5 g ha- 1 and 5 g ha- 1, respectively (0. 8 % and 0. 6 % of the theoretical application dose). A larger difference in volatilization rates was expected given differences in vapor pressure, and for <b>fenpropidin,</b> volatilization should have continued given that 80 % of the initial amount remained on plant foliage for 6 days. We thus ask if vapor pressure alone can accurately estimate volatilization just after application and then question the state of foliar residue. We identified adsorption, formulation, and extraction techniques as relevant explanations...|$|E

Ambient air samples were collected using a cascade impactor distributed into four size fractions in a rural site of Centre Region (France). Most pesticides were accumulated in the fine (0. 1 – 1 μm) particle size fraction such as cyprodinil, pendimethalin, <b>fenpropidin,</b> fenpropimorph and spiroxamine. Other pesticides such as acetochlor and metolachlor presented a bimodal distribution with maximum concentrations in the ultrafine (0. 03 – 0. 1 μm) –coarse (1 – 10 μm) and in the ultrafine–fine size ranges, respectively.

Moreover, the monitoring of pesticide fate on the leave surface after application is still difficult due to thecontribution of several competitive processes at the leave scale. Our main objective is to study the fate of three fungicides <b>fenpropidin,</b> epoxyconazole and chlorothalonil on/in wheat leaves. More specifically, our approach is based on the understanding of processes occurring at the leaf surface such as volatilization and leaf penetration. We aimed also to study the impact of the formulation on these processes. Our work is based on the quantification of the different fractions of 14 Clabelled compounds in controlled conditions : the volatilized fraction, the available fraction on the leaf surface and the fraction penetrated into the plant in the order to refine the description of the several processes. We compared experiments realized with pure and formulated compounds. For different time periods after fungicides application on the leaves 1 h, 3 h, 6 h and 24 h, the quantification of fungicides fractions have shown: -The influence of the fungicide contact time on the leaf surface on the penetration into the leaves -The effect of formulation which increases the foliar uptake of <b>fenpropidin</b> and epoxyconazole However, the analysis of these results requires the consideration of other factors which can modify the behavior and the physicochemical characteristics of pesticides...|$|E
40|$|Volatilization {{from plants}} {{is known to}} greatly {{contribute}} to pesticide emission into the atmosphere. Modeling would allow estimating this contribution, but few models are actually available because of our poor understanding of processes occurring at the leaf surface, competing with volatilization, and also because available datasets for validating models are lacking. The SURFATM-Pesticides model was developed to predict pesticide volatilization from plants. It {{is based on the}} concept of resistances and takes into account two processes competing with volatilization (leaf penetration and photodegradation). Model is here presented and simulated results are compared with the experimental dataset obtained at the field scale for two fungicides applied on wheat, <b>fenpropidin</b> and chlorothalonil. These fungicides were chosen because they are largely used, as well as because of their differentiated vapor pressures. The model simulates the energy balance and surface temperature which are in good agreement with the experimental data, using the climatic variables as inputs. The model also satisfactorily simulates the volatilization fluxes of chlorothalonil. In fact, by integrating estimated rate coefficients of leaf penetration and photodegradation for chlorothalonil giving in the literature, the volatilization fluxes were estimated to be 24. 8 ng m− 2 s− 1 compared to 23. 6 ng m− 2 s− 1 measured by the aerodynamic profile method during the first hours after application. At six days, the cumulated volatilization fluxes were estimated by the model to be 19 g ha− 1 compared to 17. 5 g ha− 1 measured by the inverse modeling approach. However, {{due to the lack of}} data to estimate processes competing with volatilization for <b>fenpropidin,</b> the volatilization of this compound is still not well modeled yet. Thus the model confirms that processes competing with volatilization represent an important factor affecting pesticide volatilization from plants...|$|E
40|$|In {{the years}} 2003 and 2004, {{the effect of}} {{different}} SBI and QoI fungicides, used alone, in mixture or in alternation, on the sensibility level of Cercospora beticola populations was studied. Sensibility was studied in laboratory using fungal isoltes collected in the experimental fields {{before the beginning of}} fungicide sprays and after three fungicide applications. A decrease of fungal populations’ sensibility was registered for tetraconazole, when it was used alone or in mixture with azoxystrobin at reduced rates. On the contrary, the use of tetraconazole and azoxystrobin at full rates, as well as the use of difenoconazole and <b>fenpropidin,</b> significantly reduced the proportion of isolates showing reduced sensibility to tetraconazole. No reduced sensibility was observed for azoxystrobin. Some isolates were less sensitive to difenoconazole in one experimental site that had been shown reduced sensibility to IBS fungicides...|$|E
30|$|Some {{evidence}} for a synergistic interaction was found for a combination of fungicides that has {{so far not been}} systematically tested for joint algal toxicity, namely the G 2 -fungicides <b>fenpropidin</b> and fenpropimorph in combination with DMI fungicides. Apart from this specific case, deviations between prediction and observation appeared to be due to the heterogeneity of input data or caused by the influence of the formulation additives that have been disregarded in the mixture toxicity predictions. Formulation additives are suspected to be the reason for unexpected high product toxicity particularly in the case of products where the tested organisms are rather insensitive for the a.s contained in the product such as for example fish in the case of specifically acting herbicides. For some clearly defined endpoints, the compliance between prediction and observation was found to be unbiased and sufficiently reliable to base regulatory decisions for combination products on CA predictions, eventually applying an additional safety factor of up to 10. These endpoints were acute Daphnia and fish toxicity in the case of fungicidal combination products as well as growth inhibition of aquatic primary producers in the case of herbicidal combination products.|$|E
40|$|Fenpropimorph-resistant mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were {{isolated}} by a gradient selection procedure. The mutants were cross-resistant to other morpholines (<b>fenpropidin,</b> dodemorph, tridemorph) and 15 -azasterol, but were susceptible to azoles (miconazole, clotrimazole, ketoconazole) and nystatin. In {{the absence of}} fenpropimorph, the major sterol produced by the mutants and the parental strain was ergosterol. In the presence of fenpropimorph, ignosterol (ergosta- 8, 14 -dien- 3 beta-ol) was the major sterol produced by the mutants and the parental strain. The resistance to fenpropimorph involves two recessive genes, each of which allows a semiresistance, when they are isolated apart from one another. Strain JR 4 (erg 3 erg 11), which produces 14 -methylfecosterol [14 alpha-methyl-ergosta- 8, 24 (28) -dien- 3 -beta-ol) as the major sterol in {{the presence or absence}} of fenpropimorph, was also found to be resistant to the drug. The growth inhibitory effect of fenpropimorph on wild-type cells appears to be linked to the production of ignosterol. The uptake of exogenous sterol by wild-type cells was greatly enhanced in the presence of fenpropimorph. The growth inhibition caused by fenpropimorph could only be overcome with bulk levels of exogenous C- 5, 6 -unsaturated sterols...|$|E
40|$|Volatilization from plant foliage {{is known}} to have a great {{contribution}} to pesticide emission to the atmosphere. However, its estimation is still difficult because of our poor understanding of processes occurring at the leaf surface. A compartmental approach for dissipation processes of pesticides applied on the leaf surface was developed on the base of experimental study performed under controlled conditions using laboratory volatilization chamber. This approach was combined with physicochemical properties of pesticides and was implemented in SURFATM-Pesticides model in order to predict pesticide volatilization from plants in a more mechanistic way. The new version of SURFATM-Pesticide model takes into account the effect of formulation on volatilization and leaf penetration. The model was evaluated in terms of 3 pesticides applied on plants at the field scale (chlorothalonil, <b>fenpropidin</b> and parathion) which display a wide range of volatilization rates. The comparison of modeled volatilization fluxes with measured ones shows an overall good agreement for the three tested compounds. Furthermore the model confirms the considerable effect of the formulation on the rate of the decline in volatilization fluxes especially for systemic products. However, {{due to the lack of}} published information on the substances in the formulations, factors accounting for the effect of formulation are described empirically. A sensitivity analysis shows that in addition to vapor pressure, the octanol-water partition coefficient represents important physicochemical properties of pesticides affecting pesticide volatilization from plants. Finally the new version of SURFATM-Pesticides is a prospecting tool for key processes involved in the description of pesticide volatilization from plants. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{antagonistic}} {{activities of}} six selected fungal isolates against Armilloria mellea were studied {{on two different}} concentrations of three media, on fungicides-amended malt extract agar (MEA) medium, and in glasshouse pots filled with John Innes No. 2 compost and natural field soil. Trichoderma hamatum isolate Tham 1 was found the most effective in reducing Armillaria growths on both the low and high concentrations of malt extract, potato dextrose and V- 8 juice in MEA, potato dextrose agar (PDA) and V- 8 juice agar (VJA), respectively, followed by T. harzianum isolate Th 2 and T. viride isolate Tv 3. Neither dose rate (200 or 2000 mg l(- 1)) of <b>fenpropidin</b> allowed any growth of Armillaria on MEA, while that of the antagonists was also completely inhibited or greatly restricted. However, both dose rates of fosetyl-A 1 allowed the growth of Armillaria and almost all the antagonists. Data on colony diameters of Armillaria showed Tham 1 as the most effective antagonist along with Th 2, Th 23 and Tv 3. Tham 1 was also found the most effective in protecting hazel billets from colonization by Armillaria, followed by Th 2 and Th 23. Compared with 7. 1 colonized billets in the inoculated controls, only 1. 3, 2. 6 and 2. 7 billets (out of ten) were colonized, respectively, when protected with these antagonists. The {{results indicate that the}} Trichoderma isolates are able to maintain their antagonistic effects on A. mellea under a variety of nutritional, chemical and edaphic regimes.
