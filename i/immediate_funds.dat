5|$|Following the storm, South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun {{declared}} the entire {{of the country}} excluding Seoul and Incheon as special disaster areas, after touring the storm damage in Busan. The government provided tax breaks and allocated ₩1.4trillion (KRW, $1.2billion) in assistance to the affected residents, after an additional budget was passed in late September 2003. This included ₩100billion (KRW, $90million USD) in <b>immediate</b> <b>funds</b> for search and rescue missions. After the storm, residents complained they did not receive adequate warning and not enough coastal areas were evacuated, {{which led to the}} high death toll. Widespread damage and continued flooding caused traffic jams in the days following the storm. A damaged rail line prompted operators to provide alternate bus service. Landslides throughout the country forced travelers to use alternate routes. By three days after the storm, most damaged roads and highways were reopened. About 33,000members of the South Korean Army were deployed to assist in relief efforts, such as clearing roads and delivering aid to storm victims. Workers quickly restored power to 95% of customers within 24hours. The government installed four new cranes for the Busan port, and assisted operators to ensure exports would not be delayed. Heavy crop damage caused fruit and vegetable prices to rise, and fish and crop exports rose 9.2% on average. The rice harvest was the lowest in 23years, due to the storm and a government effort to limit production. To assist farmers, the government increased purchases in federal contracts. Three government-run banks provided low-rate loans for businesses damaged by the storm. Residual flooding from Maemi contributed to an outbreak of conjunctivitis in the southern portion of the country. To prevent additional outbreaks, the Korean National Institute of Health sent 1,000workers to storm-damaged areas. The Korea Stock Exchange fell 1.8% due to fears that storm damage would disrupt exports.|$|E
500|$|In {{the wake}} of Cyclone Dina's devastation on January 23, then French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin ordered a relief team of 200 {{personnel}} to be dispatched to the island. He also expressed [...] "deep personal sympathy" [...] to the residents of Réunion. The following day, the Catholic Relief Services released <b>immediate</b> <b>funds</b> of €16,000 (US$14,000). An estimated 50,000 tonnes of debris was cleaned up across the island, the majority of {{which was in the}} Northwest Department, and cost waste management crews approximately €4.5 million (US$4 million) to process. Initially, the national disaster program was slow to react, with funding first being available on February 5. The first payments were made starting a month later. In the five months following the storm, the Government of France provided about €10.6 million (US$12 million) in aid to farmers, accounting for an overestimation of about 20 percent in needs. Based on meteorological statistics regarding wind speed and rainfall, Cyclone Dina was regarded as a 1-in-30 – 50 year event in Réunion.|$|E

An argument against is that separation is inconsistent with the central bank's concern for the systemic stability of the financial system. In a cross-country survey of 104 bank failures, we observe a trend towards using taxpayers' money for bank rescues which strengthens the case for hiving off the supervisory function to a government agency.

GEC won a contract for ten locomotives and sub-contracted the mechanical design and construction to NBL: Class AL4 E3036-E3045 (later Class 84 84001-84010) entered traffic in 1960-61. As with its diesel locomotives, the class suffered poor reliability and spent long periods out of service. A partial reprieve came when money was made available to extend the electrification of the WCML north to Glasgow but no <b>immediate</b> <b>funds</b> were available for more electric locomotives.

By July 15, the nation's government requested international assistance to handle the aftermath of Hurricane Dennis.

This coincided with a disaster declaration by U.S. chargé d'affaires Douglas Griffiths, which also prompted release of US$50,000 in funds from the United States Agency for International Development.

40|$|This study {{developed}} the Role of Banks Index (RBX) {{to characterize the}} role of banks in delivering its services in an uncertain interest rate and <b>immediate</b> <b>fund</b> requirement environment. We extend the model developed by Ramlee (2001) and Deshmukh, Greenbaum, and Kanatas (1983) by incorporating an element of immediacy costs. The basis of the immediacy cost is in the manner a bank stock up funds as inventory to cater for a loan commitment made to its customer. The strategy adopted in the pooling of funds acts as a penalty cost for borrowing in the last minute. RBX characterizes a banking firm with two possible roles: being a broker when the RBX moved towards 1 and an asset transformer when the RBX moved towards 0. The study successfully operationalized the developed RBX by using a monthly three months KLIBOR rate as a proxy of the uncertain interest rates environment and λ, as the proxy for immediacy costs {{for the period of}} 1982 to 2005. We showed that banks act as an asset transformer in an uncertain interest rate and high immediacy costs environment but more as a broker in a stable environment...|$|R

The U.S. program required the U.S. government to take an equity interest in financial organisations selling their securities into the TARP but did not address the fundamental solvency problem faced by the banking sector; rather was aimed at tackling the <b>immediate</b> <b>funding</b> shortfall. The UK package tackled both solvency, through the £50bn recapitalisation plan, and funding, through the government guarantee for banks' debt issuances and the expansion of the Bank of England's Special Liquidity Scheme.
