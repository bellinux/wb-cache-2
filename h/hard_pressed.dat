5|$|In November, Silahdar Yusuf Pasha {{left behind}} a strong {{garrison}} and returned to Constantinople for the winter. There however, he fell foul of the Sultan and was executed. Nevertheless, Ottoman preparations continued in order to renew and expand the war, while the Venetians were frantically trying to raise money and men, and attempting to induce other European powers to join them against the Ottomans. However, as most of Europe was locked into the fierce antagonisms of the Thirty Years' War, their pleas fell mostly on deaf ears. The Venetians were <b>hard</b> <b>pressed</b> by the financial demands of the war: besides placing taxes on the Italian mainland possessions (the Terraferma), they resorted to the sale of nobility titles and state offices to fill their war coffer. To lead the effort against the Ottomans, the Senate initially appointed the 80-year-old doge Francesco Erizzo, but {{after his death in}} early 1646, he was replaced by the 73-year old Giovanni Cappello as Captain General of the Sea.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the landing, the battalion's {{training}} intensity was stepped up, {{including more}} practice landings, and on 27 October, at 6:25 am, the 34th Battalion landed on Stirling Island at two beaches, designated Purple 2 and Purple 3. As expected, the landing was unopposed. The initial landing involved two companies, one at each beach. These secured {{the perimeter of}} landing zones before a third company landed and moved into {{the interior of the}} island to confirm the absence of Japanese. With the island secure, a platoon moved over to nearby Mono Island to assist 36th Battalion in manning the perimeter it had established on that island. In the meantime, while the Japanese were not physically on the island, they still carried out bombing raids at the landing zones. On 29 October, the battalion detached another company to assist 29th Battalion and two days later a further company was sent to Mono Island to replace one of the <b>hard</b> <b>pressed</b> 36th Battalion's which in turn took over that company's positions on Stirling Island for a rest.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of the battle, Jourdan's forces were {{supposed}} to engage in simultaneous attacks on the left, center and right of the Austrian line. On the French right, Soulham's and Ferino's Corps met with strong resistance and were stopped; on the French left, Lefebvre's troops charged with such force that the Austrians were pushed back. Having stopped Soulham's and Ferino's assault, Charles had troops available to counter Lefebvre's force. At that point, Vandamme's men moved into action. Because Soulham's assault at the center had been stalled, Charles still had enough men to turn part of his force to fight this new threat, but the Austrians were <b>hard</b> <b>pressed</b> and the action furious. At one point, Charles attempted to lead his eight battalions of Hungarian grenadiers into action, to the dismay of the old soldiers. Fürstenberg reportedly said that while he lived, he would not leave this post (at the head of the grenadiers) and the Archduke should not dismount and fight. As Fürstenberg led the Hungarian grenadiers into the battle, he was cut down by a canister and case shot employed by the French. Although he was carried alive off the field, he died almost immediately. Charles ultimately did lead his grenadiers into battle, and reportedly his personal bravery rallied his troops to push back the French. After the battle, someone removed Fürstenberg's wedding ring and returned it to his wife in Prague, with news of his death; Fürstenberg was buried at the battlefield cemetery in Stockach, and his cousin erected a small monument there, but in 1857, his body was moved to the family cemetery, Maria Hof at Neudingen, near Donaueschingen.|$|E

25|$|After {{the initial}} Ethiopian attacks were repulsed, Menelik sent his guard to outflank {{the left side}} of Arimondi's forces. The colonial {{battalion}} of Galliano, the only unit Ellena could detach to guard Arimondi's right flank, was overwhelmed. With his brigade <b>hard</b> <b>pressed</b> on the front and outflanked on both sides, General Arimondi was mortally wounded after two hours of fighting. With his death and the defeat of his brigade, the battle was lost.|$|E

In 1644 he was sent with reinforcements into Germany to the assistance of Turenne, who was <b>hard</b> <b>pressed,</b> and took command of the whole army.|$|E

25|$|When the consuls of 78 BC {{declined}} {{the opportunity to}} join Metellus Pius as proconsuls in Spain once their terms ended, the Senate in late 77 BC, hearing of Pius’ ongoing reverses {{at the hands of}} Sertorius, decided to send Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus together with another army to give Pius what assistance he could, while Pius’ governorship was prorogued. Both men worked well together, but were <b>hard</b> <b>pressed</b> to win any encounter with Sertorius. With Pompey’s arrival in 76 BC, Sertorius turned his attention to him, freeing Metellus Pius to campaign against Sertorius’ subordinates.|$|E
25|$|After the Battle of Chaldiran {{eliminated}} Safavid {{influence in}} Anatolia, {{during the war}} of 1532–55 the Ottomans conquered Arab Iraq, taking Baghdad in 1534 and securing recognition of their gains by the Treaty of Amasya in 1555. Peace lasted for two decades before another war began in 1578. The Persians were <b>hard</b> <b>pressed,</b> as the Ottoman advances were combined with an attack by the Shaybanids into Persian Khorasan. The war ended with the Treaty of Constantinople in 1590, with a clear Ottoman victory: the Ottomans occupied Georgia, Revan, and even the former Safavid capital, Tabriz.|$|E

When Lowe returned to Washington, he was <b>hard</b> <b>pressed</b> to be put back into service. Eventually he was called to Sharpsburg and Fredericksburg, where his services were used.|$|E
