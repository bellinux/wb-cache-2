The novelty lies in the production technique and <b>distribution</b> <b>apparatus</b> both operating {{in the setting of}} an urbanized society which enjoys an exceedingly high level of literacy. Production is based on high-speed rotary presses, rubber printing mats, improved adhesives for binding, and low cost lacquered or plasticized cover stock. Distribution is accomplished by a network of news and magazine wholesalers and jobbers who deliver their wares {{to tens of thousands of}} point-of-sale outlets. These factors which make possible printings of hundreds of thousands of copies of a single title at the rate of 20, 000 copies an hour have brought into being a distinctively different “book of relatively low cost, notably convenient in weight, size, and shape. ’ The designed impermanence challenges the traditional attitudes toward the utilization of books, These ubiquitous paperbacks are usually reprints of classics or popular best-sellers.

40|$|Steady-state {{analysis}} of electrical power systems is {{largely based on}} linear and sinusoidal AC circuits which allow the concept of impedance, phasors and well-defined power quantities (i. e., real, reactive and apparent powers). In reality, however, the electric load which was once composed of linear elements (e. g., induction motors, incandescent lighting, etc …) {{is becoming more and}} more nonlinear due to the wide-spread use of electronic components such as fluorescent lighting and variable-frequency drives that power the majority of electric motors. As a consequence, the current drawn by such devices is often distorted, thus containing a number of high frequency harmonics that are superimposed on the fundamental 60 Hz component. As these high-frequency harmonic currents flow through the power <b>distribution</b> <b>apparatus,</b> they in turn cause distortion in the voltage. The distorted voltage can in turn affect other loads that share a transformer or branch circuit with the original harmonic loads. It has been shown that classical definitions of electric power; namely, active, reactive and apparent powers, do not fulfill the conditions caused by harmonics. Consequently, various power definitions and calculation methods have been proposed in the literature. It is hypothesized that existing definitions of power other than the active part in non-sinusoidal circuits are based on a non-real (i. e., frequency) domain and rate theoretical in nature. Therefore, these are not only hard (often impossible) to interpret their physical meaning and make use of them, but also hard to implement in measuring devices. On the other hand, power definitions that are based on a real time domain are expected to have simpler physical interpretations and easier to measure. A simple definition of non-active power will be of great value to the power industry. It is also hypothesized that a typical electrical power distribution system can handle significantly more non-linear loads than previously thought as modern electrical loads are less sensitive to distortion in the voltage supply. The motivation that led to the proposed works stems from the fast moving events that are taking place in the electric utility industry. more specifically, many utilities are considering additional customer charges (such as charging the residential sector for peak demand, reactive power consumption, and renewable power generation) in order to ring more profits. The recently installed smart meters that primarily record energy consumption every 5 minutes and communicate wirelessly the local utility, do have the ability to measure other electrical quantities.

40|$|The {{problem of}} an {{adequate}} sampling from slurry handling equipment {{is present in}} many branches of the chemical and related industries. It is often very important to know the solid concentration and the particle size <b>distribution</b> in the <b>apparatus</b> of this kind, {{in order to control}} and operate them.

Up to now, some authors have thoroughly studied the problem of isokinetic and anisokinetic sampling from slurry pipelines, both theoretically and experimentally. However, little work was dedicated to the withdrawal of solid suspensions from stirred vessels. The main sources of sampling errors occur because of particle inertia, particle bouncing effects and flow structure ahead of the sampling device.

In {{the present study}} {{we focus on the}} A-kinase-anchoring protein (AKAP) WAVE 1, a member of the Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome (WASP) family of adaptor proteins, to study its localization throughout mammalian spermatogenesis. METHODS: Using transmission electron microscopy, immunocytochemistry and western blotting, we examined the distribution of WAVE 1 and putative partners during mammalian spermatogenesis. The localization and association of PKA RII, the regulatory subunit II of protein kinase A, tyrosine kinase Abl, and small GTPase RAC 1 were also explored. RESULTS: WAVE 1 localization in spermatocytes and round spermatids coincided with Golgi <b>apparatus</b> <b>distribution,</b> whereas in elongated spermatids and testicular sperm WAVE 1 localized to the mitochondrial sheath.

The measurements were carried out in Stockholm, Sweden, under varying physical conditions (varying the activity, the residence time, the collector voltage or applying the diffusion charger for unipolar charging of particles). All experiments gave very similar results. The activity curves A(r) of positive and negative particles as a function of radius show a similar profile with a maximum in the region of radius r = 3 - 6 x 10 - 6 cm corresponding to Junge's model of aerosol particle distribution. The calculated relative particle size distribution curves N(r) are not always characterized by a peak as expected from Junge's model but are increasing below radii r < 10 - 6 em, so that no peak is evident. 1...|$|R
