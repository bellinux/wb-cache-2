40|$|Abstract. In {{most of the}} {{companies}} heavy loads were moved either with help of cranes or conveyors. The conveyors are cheaper and it is suitable for small scale industries. These conveyors are constrained and can move the load in only one direction. In this project an effort has been put forth to design a multidirectional conveyor with help of ball bearings which can handle the load at different directions. <b>Floor</b> <b>conveyor</b> consists of ball bearings & shaft that makes the load to move at any directions. In olden days logs were used to move heavy loads {{from one place to}} another we developed those concept further and found conveyors, further improvement leads to the <b>floor</b> <b>conveyor</b> with multidirectional movement. Multidirectional is achieved by amalgamation of two ball bearings which is connected by a small shaft...|$|E

40|$|The average {{production}} of slurry per animal per day lies {{between 3 and 7}} kg {{during a period}} of swine fattening. Spain is the world’s fourth largest producer of pork. The size of farms and their density are growing faster and faster. Therefore, slurry management is becoming an environmental problem due to air and soil pollution. Separating faeces and urine improves waste management and reduces the levels of environmental pollution. Since 1999 different systems aimed at this separation have been developed. In 2001, Vazquez et al. designed and patented a new integrated system for waste management in pig housing, based on a special, adjustable <b>floor</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt under a partial slat, to avoid slurry production. A fullsize system has been built and installed at the Pig Welfare Laboratory, a pig fattening facility for a maximum of 240 animals located in Madrid, Spain. The separation system is based on the direct harvest of faeces and urine by means of a belt placed under the partial slats of the pen. Two types of belt were made for two types of handling. One of them is a flat belt of 0. 6 m x 14 m with the possibility of up to 8 ° slope side to side and up to 2 ° lengthways. The other is a conventional belt with longitudinal inclination from 0 º to 8 º. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze the performance of both belts comparing the characteristics of solids collected during a fattening period. Every fortnight samples of 250 cm 3 were taken and the percentage of dry matter was measured. This assessment took into account the interior and exterior temperatures registered in the laboratory. This study shows the technical feasibility of the patented system. Keywords. Environmental, Swine, Manure, Separation system, Belt...|$|E
25|$|In the hangline approach, wood items being {{finished}} are hung by carriers or hangers {{that are}} attached to a conveyor system that moves the items overhead or above the <b>floor</b> space. The <b>conveyor</b> itself can be ceiling mounted, wall mounted or supported by floor mounts. A simple overhead conveyor system can be designed to move wood products through several wood finishing processes in a continuous loop. The hangline approach to automated wood finishing also allows the option of moving items up to warmer air at the ceiling level to speed up drying process.|$|R
50|$|A {{conveyor}} {{system is a}} common piece of mechanical handling equipment that moves materials from one location to another. Conveyors are especially useful in applications involving the transportation of heavy or bulky materials. Conveyor systems allow quick and efficient transportation {{for a wide variety}} of materials, which make them very popular in the material handling and packaging industries. Many kinds of conveying systems are available and are used according to the various needs of different industries. There are chain <b>conveyors</b> (<b>floor</b> and overhead) as well. Chain conveyors consist of enclosed tracks, I-Beam, towline, power & free, and hand pushed trolleys.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the wheat}} is weighed, it is {{dumped into the}} {{receiving}} [...] There is a small opening at the bottom, which is controlled by a lever. It allows the miller to control the amount of wheat that enters the system. This begins the automated milling process. From this point on, the grain and grist do not {{come into contact with}} human hands until the flour is ready to be bagged. Once poured through the hopper, the grain is conveyed to the second <b>floor,</b> via the <b>conveyor</b> elevator, and stored in a large storage bin called the garner bin.|$|R
50|$|When it {{was still}} in use, the seven floors and the {{basement}} of the mill all had specific purposes. The basement held a transformer vault, water inlets, and an electrical room. On the first floor there was a small floor-mounted sifter, a larger ceiling-hung sifter, and a pressure tank. On the second <b>floor</b> there were <b>conveyor</b> belts and a staff lunchroom. The third floor contained more belts and bins and the fourth floor held a dust collector, centrifugal machine, gyration shifter, grinder, scale, and a packing bin. The fifth floor held a sifter, separator, and a centrifugal machine. The sixth floor held flour bins and the seventh floor was an electrical room.|$|R
25|$|Seattle Mayor George Cotterill, an engineer, was not {{in favor}} of some of the farmer's plans and the idea of such a large {{municipal}} bond. Cotterill appointed a committee to study the various requests and complaints of the farmers, and the committee {{came to the conclusion that}} the planned <b>floor</b> expansion and <b>conveyor</b> system the farmers wanted would be unsanitary, difficult to maintain, and far more expensive than they had projected. In response, Cotterill drafted an alternate ballot initiative, for a $25,000 municipal bond. Cotterill's initiative would result in Pike Place becoming a paved road rather than the wood road it currently was, would expand the sidewalks along the arcades by , and would improve all the Market roadsides for wagon stalls and tables, placing them all under roofing. On March 13, 1913, Seattle voters rejected the farmer initiative, and passed the mayor's initiative. The first major expansion work on the Market began immediately.|$|R

40|$|In {{the cheese}} industry, most {{contamination}} {{is caused by}} microbial biofilms. Bacteria can be present on wet surfaces and in other difficult-to-clean environments, such as <b>floors,</b> steps, drains, <b>conveyor</b> belts, walls, the regenerative sections of pasteurisers, ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis membranes, wood, milking systems and refrigerated tanks. Wood, which is often used in utensils, packaging or the ripening support used {{in the production of}} cheeses, has been shown to support microbial biofilm growth in some cases. The main concern related to environmental biofilms in cheese plants is the presence of Listeria monocytogenes. Other microbial risks include thermoduric bacteria (e. g., Streptococcus thermophilus and Bacillus cereus) and gram-negative bacteria. The use of chemicals and enzymes is the most common approach toward removing and killing an established biofilm. Biological strategies, {{such as the use of}} bacteriocins, bacteriophages and their enzymes, can also be used to eliminate biofilms. Other approaches are based on physical treatments (e. g., power ultrasound), which appear to be promising strategies for the inactivation of surface microbial biofilms in the cheese industry...|$|R
40|$|The {{farmed salmon}} {{industry}} is important economically for several countries with Norway {{as the main}} producer constituting 53 % of the world total. Bacterial contamination of salmon products may occur during processing, constituting potential life-threatening health hazards (e. g. listeriosis). The L. monocytogenes threat and thus strict legislation on ready-to-eat salmon products (i. e. smoked salmon) makes plant cleaning and hygiene important issues in the salmon industry. The present situation regards measured hygienic quality (i. e. cleanliness as means of total bacterial counts {{and the presence of}} L. monocytogenes), and hygiene standards and procedures in Norwegian salmon processing plants were investigated through visits and interviews at plants. The aim {{of the study was to}} identify potential sources of cross-contamination through the processing line and critical points for cleaning. Four salmon processing plants were visited during the autumn of 2015. A total of 91 samples were collected. Sampling was performed during full operation from: gutting machines and drains, water tanks, <b>conveyor</b> belts, <b>floors,</b> and from round fish (skin and gills) using Sodi-box cloths, FloqSwabs and water samples. Total aerobic bacteria and Listeria spp. were enumerated by plate counting and the presence of L. monocytogenes confirmed. From 91 samples, 6 were positive of L. monocytogenes. L. monocytogenes was found in one gutting machine at 2 out of the 4 plants, occasionally on <b>floor,</b> drains, and <b>conveyor</b> belts, once in a water tank, but not on ungutted fish. There was not found any correlation between the level of Listeria spp. and the total bacteria count (R 2 = 0, 026, n = 30). Even though the levels were low, the findings of L. monocytogenes in processing equipment may potentially pose a threat to food safety. L. monocytogenes is a ubiquitous bacterium that is easily introduced from different sources. The main challenge is to hinder plant colonization through improved hygienic practice and hygienic design...|$|R
