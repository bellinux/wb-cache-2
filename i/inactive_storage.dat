These independent observations have {{led to the development of}} a {{model for the}} direct induction by insulin, at the level of the nucleus, of mRNA efflux (figure 1. 1). However, the specific intracellular insulin binding has been inf erred from kinetic or morphological studies which have not identified a discrete membrane - bound polypeptide(s) as an insulin docking molecule in situ (Goldfine, 1981). Also, the stimulation of NTPase activity has only been established by monitoring the level of general ATP hydrolysis of nuclear envelope fractions in the presence and absence of insulin (Purrello et al., 1983). The scope of this thesis has been to further the understanding of this mechanism by attempting to a) unequivocally identify a specific nuclear envelope - associated insulin docking polypeptide in situ and b) to demonstrate that insulin directly affects the ATP - binding of nuclear envelope ATP - binding proteins.

40|$|Introduction. Extracellular sodium (Na+) {{concentration}} is maintained within a tight physiological range due to hormonal control, that mainly modulates thirst, Na+ and water renal excretion. Extra-renal regulation of Na+ and water homeostasis is only partially understood. Recently {{it has been}} debated whether the osmotically inactive Na+ storage is fixed or variable. Methods. In the present study, fourteen End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) patients treated by chronic hemodialysis underwent by accident to {{a sharp increase in}} plasmatic calcium (Ca+ 2) levels due to the failure of the water control system, leading to the so-called hard water syndrome. The levels of plasmatic Ca+ 2 after 1 hr of hemodialysis were correlated with urea, Na+, potassium (K+) and creatinine levels. Eleven ESRD patients treated with hemodialysis under similar conditions were used as controls. Results. The hard water syndrome resulted in hypercalcemia, while mean plasma levels of Na+, K+ and urea were not different compared to controls. Plasma creatinine levels were slightly but significantly higher that control. A correlation analysis on the measured variables has showed a positive correlation between plasma Ca+ 2 and Na+ levels (Pearson= 0. 428, p= 0. 032), and the absence of any correlation with K+, creatinine and urea concentration. Conclusions. Our study suggests that acute changes in plasmatic Ca+ 2 levels may affect Na+ concentration in the absence of renal function; it is possible that hypercalcemia may trigger Na+ release from the osmotically <b>inactive</b> <b>storage.</b> These data further support previous observations on the interplay of sodium and calcium at extrarenal sites...|$|E
30|$|In {{the present}} work, {{we found that}} Sdo 1 p could induce the {{formation}} of 60 S- 60 S dimers in vitro through crosslinking H 69 and H 38 from the two participating 60 S subunits. In bacterial and mammalian cells, it was shown that higher-order organization of ribosomes is employed by the cells {{as a means to}} regulate the translation capacity by limiting the number of active ribosomes. In E. coli, upon transition to stationary phase, cells start to accumulate 100 S particles (Yoshida and Wada, 2014), composed of 70 S dimers induced by protein factors called ribosome modulation factor (RMF) (Wada et al., 1995) and hibernation promoting factor (HPF) (Ueta et al., 2005). When mammalian (rat) cells were challenged by amino acid starvation, a form of 110 S particles, including 80 S dimers and 80 S- 60 S heterodimers, were also detected (Krokowski et al., 2011). These previous data indicate a conserved mechanism of translation modulation by organizing ribosomes into resting higher-order assemblies. Previous work also suggested SBDS has a second role in multiple cellular stress response pathways, independent of its primary role in ribosome biogenesis (Ball et al., 2009). HEK 293 cells with the deletion of SBDS are hypersensitive to DNA damage and endoplasmic reticulum stress (Ball et al., 2009). HeLa cells with SBDS-knockdown, as well as SDS patient cells are hypersensitive to Fas-mediated apoptosis (Watanabe et al., 2009; Watanabe and Dror, 2005). In yeast, Sdo 1 p physically interacts with Btn 1 p (CLN 3 in human) and was suggested to involved in cellular responses to pH and nutrient changes (Vitiello et al., 2010). Therefore, {{it is possible that the}} 60 S dimers induced by Sdo 1 p, if not an in vitro artifact, might represent a form of <b>inactive</b> <b>storage</b> of ribosomal subunits upon a certain stress (Fig.  6 G). This attractive hypothesis merits further investigation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Water-free Na storage may buffer {{extracellular}} {{volume and}} {{mean arterial pressure}} (MAP) in spite of Na retention. We studied the relationship among internal Na, K, water balance, and MAP in Sprague-Dawley rats, with or without deoxycorticosterone-acetate (DOCA) salt, with or without ovariectomy (OVX). The rats were fed a low-salt (0. 1 % NaCl) or high-salt (8 % NaCl) diet for 5 weeks. DOCA salt increased MAP (16114 versus 1234 mm Hg; P 0. 05), and DOCA-OVX salt increased MAP further (18122 mm Hg; P 0. 05). DOCA salt increased the total body Na by 40 % to 45 %; however, water-free Na retention by osmotically <b>inactive</b> Na <b>storage</b> and by osmotically neutral Na/K exchange allowed the rats to maintain the extracellular volume close to normal. DOCA-OVX salt rats showed similar Na retention. However, their osmotically <b>inactive</b> Na <b>storage</b> capacity was greatly reduced and only partially compensated by neutral Na/K exchange, resulting in greater volume retention despite similar Na retention. For every 1 % wet weight total body water gain, MAP increased by 2. 30. 2 mm Hg in DOCA salt rats and 2. 50. 3 mm Hg in DOCA-OVX salt rats. Because water-free Na retention buffered total body water content by 8 % to 11 % wet weight, we conclude that this internal Na escape buffered MAP.

40|$|The maize (Zea mays) β-glucosidase Zm-p 60. 1 {{has been}} implicated in {{regulation}} of plant development by the targeted release of free cytokinins from cytokinin-O-glucosides, their <b>inactive</b> <b>storage</b> forms. The crystal structure of the wild-type enzyme was solved at 2. 05 -Å resolution, allowing molecular docking analysis to be conducted. This indicated that the enzyme specificity toward substrates with aryl aglycones is determined by aglycone aromatic system stacking with W 373, and interactions with edges of F 193, F 200, and F 461 located opposite W 373 in a slot-like aglycone-binding site. These aglycone-active site interactions recently were hypothesized to determine substrate specificity in inactive enzyme substrate complexes of ZM-Glu 1, an allozyme of Zm-p 60. 1. Here, we test this hypothesis by kinetic analysis of F 193 I/Y/W mutants. The decreased Km of all mutants confirmed the involvement of F 193 in determining enzyme affinity toward substrates with an aromatic aglycone. It was unexpected that a 30 -fold decrease in kcat was found in F 193 I mutant compared with the wild type. Kinetic analysis and computer modeling demonstrated that the F 193 -aglycone-W 373 interaction not only contributes to aglycone recognition as hypothesized previously but also codetermines catalytic rate by fixing the glucosidic bond in an orientation favorable for attack by the catalytic pair, E 186 and E 401. The catalytic pair, assigned initially by their location in the structure, was confirmed by kinetic analysis of E 186 D/Q and E 401 D/Q mutants. It was unexpected that the E 401 D as well as C 205 S and C 211 S mutations dramatically impaired the assembly of a catalysis-competent homodimer, suggesting novel links between the active site structure and dimer formation...|$|E
40|$|Studies in our {{laboratory}} as well {{as others}} strongly suggest that salicylic acid (SA) plays an important signaling role in plant defense against pathogens. We have found that increases in endogenous SA levels correlates with both resistance of tobacco to infection with tobacco mosaic virus and induction of defense-related genes such as that encoding pathogenesis-related protein 1 (PR- 1). Some of this newly synthesized SA was conjugated to glucose to form SA beta-glucoside. A cell wall-associated beta-glucosidase activity that releases SA from this glucoside has been identified, suggesting that SA beta-glucoside serves as an <b>inactive</b> <b>storage</b> form of SA. By purifying a soluble SA-binding protein and isolating its encoding cDNA from tobacco, {{we have been able to}} further characterize the mechanism of SA signaling. This protein is a catalase, and binding of SA and its biologically active analogues inhibited catalase's ability to convert H 2 O 2 to O 2 and H 2 O. The resulting elevated levels of cellular H 2 O 2 appeared to induce PR- 1 gene expression, perhaps by acting as a second messenger. Additionally, transgenic tobacco expressing an antisense copy of the catalase gene and exhibiting depressed levels of catalase also showed constitutive expression of PR- 1 genes. To further dissect the SA signaling pathway, we have tested several abiotic inducers of PR gene expression and disease resistance for their ability to stimulate SA production. Levels of SA and its glucoside rose following application of all of the inducers except 2, 6 -dichloroisonicotinic acid. 2, 6 -Dichloroisonicotinic acid was found to bind catalase directly and inhibit its enzymatic activity. Thus, it appears that many compounds that induce PR gene expression and disease resistance in plants inactivate catalases directly or indirectly...|$|E
40|$|Suspension {{cultured cells}} of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. cv VFNT Cherry) adapted to water stress induced with {{polyethylene}} glycol 6000 (PEG), exhibit marked alterations in {{free amino acid}} pools (Handa et al. 1983 Plant Physiol 73 : 834 - 843). Using computer simulation models the in vivo rates of synthesis and utilization and compartmentation of free amino acid pools were determined from 15 N labeling kinetics after substituting [15 N]ammonium and [15 N]nitrate for the 14 N salts in the culture medium of cell lines adapted to 0 % and 25 % PEG. The 300 -fold elevated proline pool in 25 % PEG adapted cells is primarily the consequence of a 10 -fold elevated rate of proline synthesis via the glutamate pathway. Ornithine was insufficiently labeled {{to serve as a}} major precursor for proline. Our calculations suggest that the rate of proline synthesis only slightly exceeds the rate required to sustain both protein synthesis and proline pool maintenance with growth. Mechanisms must operate to restrict proline oxidation in adapted cells. The kinetics of labeling of proline in 25 % PEG adapted cells are consistent with a single, greatly enlarged metabolic pool of proline. The depletion of glutamine in adapted cells appears to be a consequence of a selective depletion of a large, metabolically <b>inactive</b> <b>storage</b> pool present in unadapted cultures. The labeling kinetics of the amino nitrogen groups of glutamine and glutamate are consistent with the operation of the glutamine synthetase-glutamate synthase cycle in both cell lines. However, we could not conclusively discriminate between the exclusive operation of the glutamine synthetase-glutamate synthase cycle and a 10 to 20 % contribution of the glutamate dehydrogenase pathway of ammonia assimilation. Adaptation to water stress leads to increased nitrogen flux from glutamate into alanine and γ-aminobutyrate, suggesting increased pyruvate availability and increased rates of glutamate decarboxylation. Both alanine and γ-aminobutyrate are synthesized at rates greatly in excess of those simply required to maintain the free pools with growth, indicating that these amino acids are rapidly turned over. Thus, both synthesis and utilization rates for alanine and γ-aminobutyrate are increased in adapted cells. Adaptation to stress leads to increased rates of synthesis of valine and leucine apparently at the expense of isoleucine. Remarkably low 15 N flux via the aspartate family amino acids was observed in these experiments. The rate of synthesis of threonine appeared too low to account for threonine utilization in protein synthesis, pool maintenance, and isoleucine biosynthesis. It is possible that isoleucine may be deriving carbon skeletons from sources other than threonine. Tentative models of the nitrogen flux of these two contrasting cell lines are discussed in relation to carbon metabolism, osmoregulation, and nitrogenous solute compartmentation...|$|E
