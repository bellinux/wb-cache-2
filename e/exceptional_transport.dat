The transport covered {{a distance of about}} 200 km and represented one of the largest exceptional transports in Slovenia ever. Finding the best route represented one of the major issues, because the steamers had to cross more than 50 problematic sections and bridges, most of which have not been designed for such heavy loads. It was necessary to load-test almost all bridges on the route to determine whether those bridges need any extra supports or not. Consequently, a logistic operator has an important and indispensable role and becomes a co-modeller of logistic service.

40|$|Organic {{semiconductors}} are {{in general}} {{known to have}} an inherently lower charge carrier mobility compared to their inorganic counterparts. Bimolecular recombination of holes and electrons is an important loss mechanism and can often be described by the Langevin recombination model. Here, the device physics of bulk heterojunction solar cells based on a nonfullerene acceptor (IDTBR) in combination with poly(3 -hexylthiophene) (P 3 HT) are elucidated, showing an unprecedentedly low bimolecular recombination rate. The high fill factor observed (above 65 %) is attributed to non-Langevin behavior with a Langevin prefactor (β/βL) of 1. 9 × 10 − 4. The absence of parasitic recombination and high charge carrier lifetimes in P 3 HT:IDTBR solar cells inform an almost ideal bimolecular recombination behavior.

Photoluminescence (PL) measurements on ensembles of such complexes evidenced a soft enough functionalization so to preserve the intrinsic properties of NTs, and yet an e cient energy transfer from the TPP to the NT [2]. In the view of overcoming the inhomogeneous e ects of ensembles studies, we report here on preliminary investigations of PL properties of such molecular assemblies at the scale of a single object lying on a quartz substrate. We run confocal spectroscopy with a HeNe laser (633 nm) excitation corresponding to the S 22 transition energy of (6, 4) NTs and observe spatially localized and linearly polarized light emissions. PL spectra show single peaks corresponding to the S 11 transition of the minority chirality (6, 4) of the sample. This brings evidence for single NTs as emitters. Further investigations are in progress, introducing the variation of the temperature, the wavelength and polarization of the excitation light, coupled with AFM imaging.

We present a complete atomic dynamic picture consisting of phonons, rotational modes of protons and molecular vibrational modes, which is constructed by carrying out high-resolution time-of-flight inelastic neutron scattering measurements in a wide energy window ranging from 0. 0036 to 54 meV on a large single crystal sample. A three-fold rotational mode of protons activated around 80 K reduces the lifetimes of acoustic and optical phonons down to about 4. 5 ps and below 1 ps at 150 K, respectively. The orthorhombic to tetragonal phase transition takes place with a slower four-fold rotational mode of the C-N axis concomitantly setting in at ~ 165 K, above which the optical phonons are too broadened to be distinguished whereas the acoustic ones are still robust. The significantly reduced lifetimes of optical phonons {{are linked to the}} smaller mobility of charge carriers while the ultralow lattice thermal conductivity is attributed to nanoscale mean free paths of acoustic phonons.

The delocalized P-electronic system of carbon nanotubes allows them to link non-covalently to a large range of organic molecules. In contrast to covalent functionnalization, this mild interaction preserves most of the intrinsic properties (luminescence for instance) but still leads to a strong enough coupling so to give stable compounds and so to induce new functionnalities. Here we focus on porphyrin molecules that can be attached to single-wall carbon nanotubes by means of the micelle swelling method [1]. An energy transfer [2] from the molecule to the nanotube was recently evidenced by photoluminescence excitation experiments. We report on the quantum efficiency and on the dynamics of this transfer [3]. We first performed a quantitative evaluation of the transfer quantum yield in the case of (6, 5) nanotubes through three independent methods: quantitative photoluminescence excitation measurements, evaluation of the luminescence quenching of the donor and ultrafast transient absorption measurements. The latter shows a tremendous increase in the porphyrin recovery rate upon incorporation in the compound. All these measurements consistently lead to a quantum yield very close to one (10 － 5 < 1 － < 10 － 3). Time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy also allowed us to track the population of the electronic levels of the compounds subunits and to build an effective transfer scenario.

The dust deposition during the October event took place during 13 ? 16 October 2000. Mobilisation areas of dust were mainly identified in the Algerian and Libyan deserts. A combination of an upper-level potential vorticity streamer and a midlevel jet across Algeria first brought moist Atlantic air and later mixed air from the tropics and Saharan desert across the Mediterranean towards the Alps.

In order to link the dust record in the ice core to the meteorological situation {{that led to the}} dust events, a novel methodology based on back-trajectory analysis was developed. It allowed the detailed analysis of the specific meteorologic flow evolution that was associated with Saharan dust transport into the Alps, and the identification of dust sources, atmospheric transport paths, and wet deposition periods for both dust events. Differences in the chemical signature of the two dust events were interpreted with respect to contributions from the dust sources and aerosol scavenging during the transport. For the October event, the trajectory analysis indicated that dust deposition took place during 13 – 15 October 2000. Mobilisation areas of dust were mainly identified in the Algerian and Libyan deserts. A combination of an upper-level potential vorticity streamer and a midlevel jet across Algeria first brought moist Atlantic air and later mixed air from the tropics and Saharan desert across the Mediterranean towards the Alps. The March event consisted of two different deposition phases which took place during 17 – 19 and 23 – 25 March 2000. The first phase was associated with an <b>exceptional</b> <b>transport</b> pathway past Iceland and towards the Alps from northerly directions. The second phase was similar to the October event. A significant peak of methanesulphonic acid associated with the March dust event was most likely caused by incorporation of biogenic aerosol while passing through the marine boundary layer of the western Mediterranean during a local phytoplankton bloom. From this study, we conclude that for a detailed understanding of the chemical signal recorded in dust events at Piz Zup&# 243;, it is essential to consider the whole transport sequence of mineral aerosol, consisting of dust mobilisation, transport, and deposition at the glacier...|$|E

The specific needs of wireless communication systems in 5 G and beyond, as well as devices for the future deployment of Internet of Things has caused that the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors, which is the strategic planning document of the semiconductor industry, considered since 2011, graphene and related materials (GRMs) as promising candidates {{for the future of}} electronics. Graphene, a one-atom-thick of carbon, is a promising material for high-frequency applications due to its intrinsic superior carrier mobility and very high saturation velocity. These <b>exceptional</b> carrier <b>transport</b> properties suggest that GRM-based field-effect transistors could potentially outperform other technologies. This thesis presents a body of work on the modelling, performance prediction and simulation of GRM-based field-effect transistors and circuits. The main goal of this work is to provide models and tools to ease the following issues: (i) gaining technological control of single layer and bilayer graphene devices and, more generally, devices based on 2 D materials, (ii) assessment of radio-frequency (RF) performance and microwave stability, (iii) benchmarking against other existing technologies, (iv) providing guidance for device and circuit design, (v) simulation of circuits formed by GRM-based transistors.

40|$|Graphene is a {{material}} with remarkable electronic properties and <b>exceptional</b> thermal <b>transport</b> properties near room temperature, {{which have been}} well examined and understood. However at very low temperatures the thermodynamic and thermal transport properties are much less well explored and somewhat surprisingly, is expected to exhibit extreme thermal isolation. Here we demonstrate an ultra-sensitive, wide-bandwidth measurement scheme to probe the thermal transport and thermodynamic properties of the electron gas of graphene. We employ Johnson noise thermometry at microwave frequency to sensitively measure {{the temperature of the}} electron gas with resolution of 4 mK/√(Hz) and a bandwidth of 80 MHz. We have measured the electron-phonon coupling from 2 - 30 K at a charge density of 2 · 10 ^ 11 cm^- 2. Utilizing bolometric mixing, we have sensed temperature oscillations with period of 430 ps and have determined the heat capacity of the electron gas to be 2 · 10 ^- 21 J/(K·μ m^ 2) at 5 K which is consistent with that of a two dimensional, Dirac electron gas. These measurements suggest that graphene-based devices together with wide bandwidth noise thermometry can generate substantial advances in the areas of ultra-sensitive bolometry, calorimetry, microwave and terahertz photo-detection, and bolometric mixing for applications in areas such as observational astronomy and quantum information and measurement.
