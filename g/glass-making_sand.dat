Suitable <b>glass-making</b> <b>sand</b> raw materials are analysed for their trace elemental composition and compared to glass from known production centres. It is shown that the combined use of Nd isotopic and trace element analysis can be efficient for the provenancing of Roman glass. Trace elements associated with (de) colourants of glass are only present in small concentrations in glass-making sands. Background levels introduced to the glass by the sand raw material are defined and a lower threshold for the concentrations influenced by recycling is determined. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} make rapid {{measurements}} on small samples using laser fluorination enhances the potential of oxygen isotopes {{in the investigation of}} early inorganic materials and technologies. delta O- 18 and Sr- 87 /Sr- 86 values are presented for glass from two primary production sites, four secondary production sites and a consumer site in the Near East, dating from Late Antiquity to the medieval period. delta O- 18 is in general slightly less effective than Sr- 87 /Sr- 86 in discriminating between sources, as the spread of measured values from a single source is somewhat broader relative to the available range. However, while Sr- 87 /Sr- 86 is derived predominantly from either the lime-bearing fraction of the <b>glass-making</b> <b>sand</b> or the plant ash used as a source of alkali, delta O- 18 derives mainly from the silica. Thus the two measurements can provide complementary information. A comparison of delta O- 18 for late Roman - Islamic glasses made on the coast of Syria-Palestine with those of previously analysed glasses from Roman Europe suggests that the European glasses are relatively enriched in O- 18. This appears to contradict the view that most Roman glass was made using Levantine sand and possible interpretations are discussed...|$|E
50|$|Martin Mere {{was formed}} {{at the end}} of the last Ice Age, when water filled a {{depression}} in the glacial drift. Since then its size has varied as water levels have risen and fallen. The original giant lake can be seen on Christopher Saxton's map from 1579 and stretched from Rufford in the east, to Churchtown (then known as North Meols) in the west. To the north of the lake were the villages of Mere Brow and Holmeswood, the site of Holmeswood Hall, built by the Heskeths as a hunting lodge. South of the lake was the Scarisbrick Hall estate, Martin Hall and Tarlefarwood, now known as Tarlscough. The mere originally drained out in two places; at the western end the arm of the mere known as the Wyke drained into the Pool (or Old Pool) at what is now Crowland Street, Blowick, while at its eastern end it flowed into the river Douglas at Rufford.Active management of the mere began in 1692 when Thomas Fleetwood of Bank Hall cut a channel in an attempt to drain it. Further attempts to drain it were made in the 1780s, but effective drainage was only achieved in the mid-19th century with the introduction of steam pumping. Farms and market gardens were established on the rich soils of the reclaimed land. Between 1974 and 1982 sand from the former lake bed was quarried for use in <b>glass-making</b> at Mere <b>Sands</b> Wood which is now a nature reserve.An ancient canoe has been excavated from Martin Mere and is the oldest item on display in the Botanic Gardens Museum.|$|R
