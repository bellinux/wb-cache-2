5|$|The Sirenia, {{commonly}} referred to as sea cows or sirenians, are an order of fully aquatic, herbivorous mammals that inhabit swamps, rivers, estuaries, marine wetlands, and coastal marine waters. The Sirenia currently comprise the families <b>Dugongidae</b> (the dugong) and Trichechidae (manatees) with a total of four species. The Protosirenidae (Eocene sirenians) and Prorastomidae (terrestrial sirenians) families are extinct.

40|$|Extract] The <b>Dugongidae</b> {{is one of}} four {{families}} {{within the}} Sirenia, a mammalian order with a long evolutionary history extending back more than 50 million years. The sirenians are ancestrally related to a superficially dissimilar grouping of other mammals known as the Afrotheria. The afrotherians contain some modern families such as Proboscidea (elephants), Afrosoricida (golden moles and tenrecs), Tubulidentata (aardvarks), Hyracoidea (hyraxes), and Macroscelidea (elephant shrews). The closest contemporary relatives of sirenians are the elephants and hyraxes, and the three groups have been linked together as the clade Paenungulata. At least 35 named species of sirenians have existed through time, ranging in mass from small sea cows weighing an estimated 150 kg to the extinct Steller's Sea Cow (Hydrodamalis gigas) estimated to have weighed more than 10, 000 kg. Some early sirenians walked on land with sturdy hindlimbs but fed on aquatic vegetation. Later forms evolved a variety of foraging strategies, adapting to changing climatic, geologic, oceanographic, a n d biological conditions within the bounds of aquatic megaherbivory. Today only two sirenian families remain: the Trichechidae, containing the three species of manatees that occur {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic, and the <b>Dugongidae,</b> with one species, tl 1 e Dugong, which occurs in the Indo-West Pacific. The ancestors of these families diverged 25 - 40 million years ago. The dugongids were by far the most diverse group of sirenians. The family <b>Dugongidae</b> is divided into three subfamilies: the Halitheriinae, the Dugonginae, and the Hydrodamalinae. The extinct Halitheriinae was the basal group of the dugongids. The Dugonginae arose from them and diversified in the Caribbean and western Atlantic in the Oligocene. They dispersed to other tropical waters of the world in the late Oligocene and early Miocene. A partial postcranial skeleton (vertebrae and ribs) of an indeterminate sirenian has recently been described from a cave in the Hindenburg Range, Western Province of Papua New Guinea. These fossils represent the earliest evidence (c. 11 · 8 million years ago) of Sirenia in Australasian coastal marine ecosystems...|$|E

The Chilean record extends the already wide geographical distribution of fossil sirenians along the Eastern Pacific coast. The presence of a sirenian during the Miocene on the Chilean coast is related to a globally warmer climatic condition and a still limited northern extension of the cold Humboldt Current...|$|E
40|$|Fossil {{remains of}} {{sirenians}} (Mammalia; <b>Dugongidae)</b> are reported {{from the late}} early Miocene (Burdigalian) Qom Formation {{near the town of}} Shirin Su, northwest Kabudar Ahang region, west of Tehran, Iran. The fossils consist of partial postcranial skeletons preserved mostly as natural molds in limestone. In the absence of skulls or other diagnostic elements, it is not evident which dugongid subfamily these specimens represent: Halitheriinae or Dugonginae. Both subfamilies were present in contemporaneous Western Tethys (Mediterranean) deposits, but so far only dugongines have been found in Neogene rocks of Eastern Tethys. Since the Iranian deposits are located between these two parts of the former Tethys Seaway, {{it will be interesting to}} see which group(s) the Iranian sirenians prove to represent, once their taxonomic identity has been determined through future discoveries...|$|E
40|$|The order Sirenia {{is closely}} {{associated}} with {{a large group of}} hoofed mammals known as Tethytheria, which includes the extinct orders Desmostylia (hippopotamus-like marine mammals) and Embrithopoda (rhinoceros-like mammals). Sirenians probably split off from these relatives in the Palaeocene (65 - 54 mya) and quickly took to the water, dispersing to the New World. This outline attempts to order all the species described from the fossil record in chronological order within each of the recognized families of Prorastomidae, Protosirenidae, <b>Dugongidae,</b> and Trichechidae. This outline began as an exercise in preparation for my Ph. D. preliminary exams and is primarily based on decades of research and peer-reviewed literature by Dr. Daryl P. Domning, to whom I am eternally grateful. It has been recently updated with the help of Dr. Jorge Velez-Juarbe. However, this document continues to be a work-in-progress and not a peer reviewed publication...|$|E
40|$|Postcranial {{remains of}} Sirenia {{from the early}} Middle Eocene (late Lutetian) Urbasa-Andia Formation of Navarre (Western Pyrenees) are described. The {{material}} consists of two partial atlas vertebrae, one humerus and several dorsal ribs (from Arrasate, Urbasa plateau), and partial dorsal ribs (from Lezaun, Andia plateau). The morphology of the fossils is consistent with referral to <b>Dugongidae,</b> the only sirenian clade known {{so far in the}} Middle Eocene of Europe. Moreover, the histological study of the ribs shows that the pachyosteosclerosis of extant Sirenia was definitively present by the early Middle Eocene. The oldest sirenian remains reported to date in the Pyrenean Realm were assigned to the Biarritzian, a regional stage that is currently ascribed either to the middle or to the lower-middle Bartonian. Therefore, the sirenian remains of Lezaun, reliably dated as late Lutetian (SBZ 16 zone) in age, are definitively the earliest sirenian fossils known in Western Europe and are among the oldest sea cow records of Europe...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the diet of dugongs (Dugong dugon- Fam. <b>Dugongidae)</b> and green turtles (Chelonia mydas- Fam. Cheloniidqe) on the Orman Reefs in Torres Strait, between Australia and Papua New Guinea, where large numbers of these animals live sympatrically. The stomach contents of dugongs and green turtles caught in an Indigenous fishery were examined. Dugongs fed exclusively on seagrasses (mainly Thalassia hemprichii, Cymodocea spp. and Syringodium isoetifolium) whereas turtles consumed both seagrasses (especially Thalassia hemprichii and Enhalus acoroides) and algae (mainly Hypnea spp., Laurencia spp. and Caulerpa spp.). The two herbivores did not show overlap in resource use except for the seagrass Thalassia hemprichii which was abundant in the feeding area. Both species appeared to feed selectively and did not just consume the most available food items. These results are suggestive of partitioning of food resources between dugongs and green turtles but a full explanation requires more detailed, and concurrent, study of the food resources and the animals’ movements...|$|E
40|$|Manatees {{belong to}} the Order Sirenia with two known families. Family <b>Dugongidae</b> is {{represented}} by the extant genera Dugong that is found in the Indo-Pacific region and the extinct genera Hydromalis {{the only member of the}} order adapted to cold water. Family Trichechidae is represented by one genus Trichechus and three species: T. senegalensis, the West African manatee, T. inunguis, the Amazonian manatee, and T. manatus, the West Indian manatee. The West Indian manatee is distributed in Caribbean coastal areas and river systems from Virginia, USA to Espiritu Santo, Brazil (Shoshani 2005). Hatt (1934) recognized two T. manatus subspecies: the Antillean manatee (Trichechus manatus manatus) and the Florida manatee (Trichechus manatus latirostris). Domning and Hayek (1986) tentatively divided the West Indian manatee into the Florida manatee T. m. latirostris and the Antillean manatee T. m. manatus based on cranial characters. They suggested that such subspeciation may reflect reproductive isolation brought on by the intemperate northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico and characteristically strong currents found in the Straits of Florida. García-Rodríguez et al. (1998) compared mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from eight locations of T. manatus and found that despite the sharing of sixteen haplotypes (a segment of DN...|$|E
40|$|Extant {{sirenians}} show allopatric distributions {{throughout most}} of their range. However, their fossil record shows evidence of multispecies communities {{throughout most of}} the past ∼ 26 million years, in different oceanic basins. Morphological differences among co-occurring sirenian taxa suggest that resource partitioning played a role in structuring these communities. We examined body size and ecomorphological differences (e. g., rostral deflection and tusk morphology) among sirenian assemblages from the late Oligocene of Florida, early Miocene of India and early Pliocene of Mexico; each with three species of the family <b>Dugongidae.</b> Although overlapping in several ecomorphological traits, each assemblage showed at least one dominant trait in which coexisting species differed. Fossil sirenian occurrences occasionally are monotypic, but the assemblages analyzed herein show iterative evolution of multispecies communities, a phenomenon unparalleled in extant sirenian ecology. As primary consumers of seagrasses, these communities likely had a strong impact on past seagrass ecology and diversity, although the sparse fossil record of seagrasses limits direct comparisons. Nonetheless, our results provide robust support for previous suggestions that some sirenians in these extinct assemblages served as keystone species, controlling the dominance of climax seagrass species, permitting more taxonomically diverse seagrass beds (and sirenian communities) than many of those observed today...|$|E
40|$|In 1811, Illiger {{published}} {{a number of}} new genera, proposing among others, Rytina for the sea cow of Bering Island and Halicore for the dugong of the Indian Ocean. Nearly all recent writers on mammals have adopted these genera, apparently overlook ing the fact that both animals had been named before 1811. As early as 1794 Retzius described the sea cow in the 2 ̆ 7 Handlingar 2 ̆ 7 of the Stockholm Academy of Science, placing it in a new genus which he called Hydrodamalis, and the species, based on the Vacca marina of Steller, Hydrodamalis stelleri. The generic description is sufficient to identify the animal even if the species and the vernacular name used by Steller had not been given. As Hydrodamalis has 17 years priority over Rytina it should be adopted as the generic name of the northern sea cow. The earliest specific name is that given by Zimmermann in 1780, and the species should stand Hydrodamalis gigas (Zimm.). The abandonment of Rytina necessitates a change {{in the name of the}} family (Rytinidæ), which may be called Hydrodamalidæ, there being no other genus in the group. Lacépède, in 1801, used Dugong as a generic name for the sirenian afterwards called Halicore by Illiger, but not being a classical word it did not come into general use. As it is the first name for the genus there seems to be no good reason for not adopting it. The specific name was first proposed by Müller in 1776, who spelled it dugon [...] without the final g. This was evidently not a misprint, as the same spelling occurs twice. The name for the dugong will, therefore, be Dugong dugon (Müller), while the unfortunate compound <b>Dugongidæ</b> becomes necessary for the family, instead of the more euphonious Halicoridæ...|$|E
40|$|Protosiren, Eotheroides, and Eosiren are {{all known}} from the Fayum Basin, and all are {{represented}} by exceptionally complete skulls and axial skeletons with pectoral and pelvic girdles. The skeletal remain of Protosiren and Eotheroides of the Birket Qarun Formation in Wadi Al Hitan are of special interest because they represent an intermediate stage of evolution and an intermediate stage of secondary adaptation to life in water. 	Eotheroides (<b>Dugongidae,</b> Halitheriinae) is described {{for the first time}} from the Priabonian of the Wadi Al Hitan. The two Wadi Al Hitan species Eotheroides clavigerum sp. nov. and Eotheroides sandersi sp. nov. are most similar to Eotheroides aegyptiacum (Owen, 1875) from the Lutetian nummulitic limestone beds of Cairo. They share the following derived characteristics: prominent falx cerebri and bony tentorium in the roof of the braincase; nasals long and in contact along the midline; palate broad with its posterior border posterior to the toothrow; and anterior ribs pachyosteosclerotic. Wadi Al Hitan Eotheroides were medium to large dugongs, ranging in length from 1. 5 to 2. 5 m; the skull is robust and heavy; the rostrum is deflected and bears medium to diminutive tusks; the trunk is widest between the ninth and eleventh thoracics; the end of the tail was fluked; the pelvis is greatly reduced with a shallow acetabulum, but retains an expanded club-like ilium; and the femur is short and slender. There cannot have been any substantial lower leg or foot. 	Protosiren, Eotheroides, and Eosiren all exhibit secondary sexual dimorphism of the bony pelvis. As in modern dugongs, males of the Eocene species consistently have the distal thickness of the ischium about twice as that of the ramus, where females ischia and rami have approximately equal thickness. The coexistence of Protosiren smithae, Eotheroides clavigerum, and Eotheroides sandersi in the same biotope reflects the diversity of this group in early Priabonian Tethys. The observed morphological diversity reflects dietary and environmental specialization and niche partitioning. Seagrass preserved as leaf impressions in Priabonian marine mammal beds is a direct indicator of the shallowness of Tethyan waters in the Fayum Basin...|$|E
40|$|The {{recently}} extinct (ca. 1768) Steller’s sea cow (Hydrodamalis gigas) was a large, edentulous North Pacific sirenian. The phylogenetic affinities of this taxon {{to other}} members of this clade, living and extinct, are uncertain based on previous morphological and molecular studies. We employed hybridization capture methods and second generation sequencing technology to obtain > 30  kb of exon sequences from 26 nuclear genes for both H. gigas and Dugong dugon. We also obtained complete coding sequences for the tooth-related enamelin (ENAM) gene. Hybridization probes designed using dugong and manatee sequences were both highly effective in retrieving sequences from H. gigas (mean =  98. 8 % coverage), as were more divergent probes for regions of ENAM (99. 0 % coverage) that were designed exclusively from a proboscidean (African elephant) and a hyracoid (Cape hyrax). New sequences were combined with available sequences for representatives of all other afrotherian orders. We also expanded a previously published morphological matrix for living and fossil Sirenia by adding both new taxa and nine new postcranial characters. Maximum likelihood and parsimony analyses of the molecular data provide robust support for an association of H. gigas and D. dugon {{to the exclusion of}} living trichechids (manatees). Parsimony analyses of the morphological data also support the inclusion of H. gigas in <b>Dugongidae</b> with D. dugon and fossil dugongids. Timetree analyses based on calibration density approaches with hard- and soft-bounded constraints suggest that H. gigas and D. dugon diverged in the Oligocene and that crown sirenians last shared a common ancestor in the Eocene. The coding sequence for the ENAM gene in H. gigas does not contain frameshift mutations or stop codons, but there is a transversion mutation (AG to CG) in the acceptor splice site of intron 2. This disruption in the edentulous Steller’s sea cow is consistent with previous studies that have documented inactivating mutations in tooth-specific loci of a variety of edentulous and enamelless vertebrates including birds, turtles, aardvarks, pangolins, xenarthrans, and baleen whales. Further, branch-site dN/dS analyses provide evidence for positive selection in ENAM on the stem dugongid branch where extensive tooth reduction occurred, followed by neutral evolution on the Hydrodamalis branch. Finally, we present a synthetic evolutionary tree for living and fossil sirenians showing several key innovations {{in the history of this}} clade including character state changes that parallel those that occurred in the evolutionary history of cetaceans.

40|$|The dugong (Dugong dugon) is {{the only}} {{strictly}} marine herbivorous mammal and {{the only member of}} the family <b>Dugongidae.</b> Dugongs and the three species of manatee are the only living species in the order Sirenia; one of three orders of mammals considered at significant risk of extinction at the ordinal level (Purvis et al. 2000). Dugongs can live for about 70 years, and reach a maximum size of between 2 – 3 m. Female dugongs have a minimum pre-reproductive period of between 6 – 17 yr (Marsh et al. 1984; Boyd et al. 1999; Kwan 2002) and a mean calving interval of between 2. 4 – 7 yr. The age at first breeding and the time interval between calves is apparently dependent on the status of food supply (Boyd et al. 1999; Marsh and Kwan 2008). Dugongs are bottom feeders, and seagrasses are the most important component of their diet. Dugongs graze predominantly on intertidal and subtidal tropical and subtropical seagrass meadows, but are also known to feed on macro-invertebrates and algae. They feed on nine of the ten seagrass genera and on most of the species of seagrass that occur within their range (Green and Short 2003). Dugongs typically feed on several species of seagrass in mixed species seagrass meadows (Johnstone and Hudson 1981). The selection of seagrasses as food by dugongs is influenced by multiple factors including fibre, nitrogen and starch content and biomass (Lanyon and Sanson 2006); but as pointed out by Aragones et al. (2006), the nutritional basis for food selection by dugongs is poorly understood. Dugongs are found in the shallow, protected coastal waters of about 40 countries and territories in the tropical and subtropical Indian and Pacific Oceans. At a global scale, their distribution is characterised by relict populations separated by large areas where dugongs are believed to be close to extinction or extinct locally (Marsh et al. 2002). A recent synthesis suggests that dugongs are declining or locally extinct in at least a third of its range; of unknown status in nearly half; and possibly stable in the remainder (Marsh 2008). Dugongs are listed under the: IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as ‘Vulnerable’ to extinction; Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora 1973; and Appendix II of the Convention for Migratory Species of Wild Animals 1979...|$|E
40|$|The {{evolution}} of the Neogene sirenians along the Euro-North African coasts (southern North Sea, northeastern Atlantic, Mediterranean and Paratethys) has been investigated in correlation with the palaeogeographic and palaeoclimatic {{evolution of}} the region. A better chronostratigraphic setting and a systematic review of the main specimens (listed in a database) have been provided and nine valid Neogene Euro – North African sirenian species have been recognized: Miosiren kocki, Prohalicore dubaleni, Rytiodus capgrandi, Rytiodus sp. from Libya, Metaxytherium krahuletzi, M. medium, M. petersi, M. serresii and M. subapenninum; while “Halitherium” bellunense, previously referred to the Early Miocene, has been determined to be Late Oligocene in age and confirmed to be a dugongine close to Rytiodus spp [...] These species, except Prohalicore dubaleni known only from an incomplete mandible and M. petersi under study by Domning and Pervesler, {{have been included in}} a cladistic analysis. This analysis has been carried out with the PAUP version 40 b 10 program; developed for 31 species of sirenians and the primitive Proboscidea Phosphatherium escuilliei as outgroup, and based on 57 characters of cranium, mandible and dentition. The results confirm the anatomical observations and show a close correspondence between palaeobiogeographic and chronostratigraphic distribution of the taxa and their positions on the tree. A reconstruction of Euro-North African sirenian palaeoecology and palaeobiogeography during the Neogene has been proposed in relation to the long-term trend of climatic cooling and to the decreasing of marine influence, which characterized the {{evolution of the}} region. The sirenian palaeoecology has been reconstructed by combining data from seagrass evolution and ecology, sirenian distribution and morphology, stable isotope (C and O) analyses of sirenian tooth enamel. On the whole, the Neogene Euro-North African sirenians appear to be fully aquatic herbivorous mammals strictly linked to coastal environments. During the Early Miocene, which was a period of global warming, at least three different sirenian lines lived along the Euro-North African coasts: the euryhaline mixed-feeder Miosiren kocki (Trichechidae, Miosireninae), living in isolation on the southernmost margin of the North Sea; the generalist small-tusked Metaxytherium krahuletzi (<b>Dugongidae,</b> Halitheriinae), which appears to have been widespread along the Euro-North African coasts; and the specialized large-tusked genus Rytiodus (<b>Dugongidae,</b> Dugonginae), recorded with confidence just in the Aquitaine Basin (SW France) and in the Sirte Basin (Libya), where it most probably lived sympatrically with Metaxytherium krahuletzi. From the Middle Miocene onward, however, the only sirenians surviving in the Euro-North African region belonged to the generalist cosmopolitan halitheriine genus Metaxytherium. The only exception is the miosirenine trichechid Prohalicore dubaleni, suggesting that Trichechidae survived until the Serravallian, probably living together with the generalist Metaxytherium. During the Late Miocene the genus Metaxytherium became extinct throughout the world except along the Euro-North African coasts, {{and by the end of}} the Miocene it appears to have been survived just in the Mediterranean Basin with the relictual dwarfed species M. serresii. M. serresii specimens are recorded before and after the Messinian Salinity Crisis: at about 7. 24 Ma from southern Italian deposits; at about 6. 8 Ma from Libyan deposits; at 5. 25 - 4. 98 Ma from Spanish deposits; and at 4 – 5. 3 Ma from French deposits. The M. serresii record is considered continuous from the uppermost Tortonian to the early Pliocene in the Mediterranean; according to recent data suggesting that normal marine conditions were present in the Mediterranean during the Messinian Salinity Crisis. The dwarfism in M. serresii is interpreted as a method to increase the fitness of a relictual species, permitted by geographic restriction and reduction in the genetic pool. Moreover, the increase in tusk size observed in M. serresii, in comparison with its supposed ancestors M. krahuletzi and M. medium, could denote a shift in behaviour, with tendencies to territoriality and competition for females and space. The subsequent, and latest, Metaxytherium species M. subapenninum was larger and also with larger and, probably, sexually dimorphic tusks. The sexually dimorphic tusks of M. subapenninum could be interpreted as a successive step in change in behaviour, an indication of competition for females and space that favoured the development of a sexual dimorphism similar to that observed in the living Dugong dugon. On the contrary, the rapid increase in body size could be interpreted as a response to the long-term climatic cooling, as the hydrodamaline sirenians did in the North Pacific; which survived into historic times, eating algae in cold waters. The anatomical feeding adaptations and the stable isotope analyses of M. subapenninum do not indicate a clear change in diet and habitat in comparison with the Miocene species. M. subapenninum did not respond to climatic cooling by changing its diet and habitat as the Hydrodamalinae did, and therefore it became extinct during the Middle Pliocene, most probably during the acceleration of climatic cooling record after 3. 1 Ma. But the history of Euro-North African sirenians does not appear to be concluded; in fact, the remains coming from the Pliocene deposits of the Atlantic coast of Morocco referred to Zanclean and assigned to Metaxytherium serresii, have been demostred to be Piacenzian in age and to bear more resemblances to the Pliocene caribbean dugongine Corystosiren varguezi...|$|E
40|$|Sirenians, {{the only}} aquatic herbivorous mammals, include 2 families; <b>Dugongidae</b> as dugong (Dugong dugon) and Trichechidae as West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus), Amazonian manatee (T. inunguis) and West African manatee (T. senegalensis). The {{previous}} works {{have concentrated on}} the digestive functions in sirenians that have been supposed to be specific and different from marine carnivorous mammals and terrestrial herbivores. This paper reviews previous works and gives a perspective for further studies on digestive functions in sirenians {{by focusing on the}} following three topics: (1) The anatomy of the digestive tract, (2) Species and their nutritive values of aquatic plants on which the sirenians feed (3) Researches regarding to digestion. (1) The sirenians are non-ruminant herbivores. Their stomach is simple sac-like and is characterized by a unique “cardiac gland” which contains the digestive enzymes and acid secreting cells. No one cannot explain the difference that the cardiac gland forms like a ball in dugongs and a finger in manatees. The intestine reaches to 9 to 16 times as long as the body length when sirenians becomes adult. The length of large intestine in adult dugong becomes twice as long as small intestine, whereas that of large intenstine in adult manatees becomes to be same length as small intestine. There is a large cecum with a single diverticulum in the dugongs and paired diverticula in manatees. Based on anatomy and morphology of the digestive tract, sirenians belong to the hindgut digesters such as Perissodactyla, proboscidean, Hyracoidea, Rodentia and the green sea turtle in Cryptodira. (2) The dugong feeds exclusively on marine phanerogams of 18 species, belonging to 4 families: Cymodoceae, Hydrocharitaceae, Potamogetonaceae and Zosteraceae. Except for the Amazonian manatee which only lives in fresh water, manatees feed on many aquatic plants in marine to freshwater environments. It has been reported that the West Indian manatees feed on over 60 species of aquatic plants. The seagrasses on which the dugong preferably feeds have relatively lower crude protein, higher crude fiber and lower calorific content than those of the major plants on which terrestrial herbivores primarily feed. On the other hand, the aquatic plants on which the manatees feed have similar crude protein, higher crude fiber and lower calorific content as the above terrestrial plants. Deducing from that the aquatic plants contain 85 - 95 % water in comparison to 75 - 80 % in terrestrial plants, the sirenians must feed abundantly on seagrass and aquatic plants to maintain their body. (3) Although fed diets are different depending on each study, the digestibility in the sirenians is 80 - 90 % and is the highest among terrestrial non-ruminants and ruminants. The digestive capacity in the sirenians seems to be remarkably superior among other herbivorous mammals. Based on researches on volatile fatty acid concentration in the content of digestive tracts, the cecum and large intestine are the principal areas to breakdown and digest the fiber in the diet. Moreover, food retention times in the sirenians are much longer (120 - 216 hrs.) than for other hindgut digesters such as horses (23 - 45 hrs.), elephants (17 - 26 hrs.) and white-tailed deer (20 - 40 hrs.) and ruminants such as cattle (48 - 65 hrs.). The sirenians adapted their digestive tracts and digestive functions to their herbivorous feeding character as having at least two digestive functions to achieve sufficient nutrient absorption. First, food retention time has been lengthened due to the long intestine. Second, the sirenians may have a rich microflora within their digestive tracts, especially in the cecum and large intestine, to elevate the capacity of the fiber fraction and also energy absorption. But research on the microflora within their digestive tract has not yet been carried out. Therefore, {{little is known about the}} digestive physiology and functions in sirenians. We need to have more information about their digestive functions using the living animals in captivity and dead specimens. 海産哺乳類の中で唯一の草食動物である海牛類は，ジュゴン科のジュゴンとマナティ科のアメリカマナティ，ア マゾンマナティ，アフリカマナティの 2 科から成る。海牛頬の消化機構は他の肉食性海産哺乳類と比べて異なっ ていることから，注目を集めていた。本稿では海牛類の消化機構について，（ 1 ）消化管の解剖学的特性，（ 2 ）餌料 植物の栄養学的特性，（ 3 ）消化機能に関連した栄養生態学的研究の 3 点を中心として，消化機構に関する既知の 知見を概説し，今後の研究方向について展望する。 （ 1 ）海牛類は非反芻動物である。胃は単胃であり，「噴門腺」と呼ばれる海牛類に特有の腺塊がある。噴門腺は消 化酵素を分泌する細胞と酸を分泌する細胞の 2 種の細胞から成っている。ジュゴンの噴門腺は球状に近いが，マ ナティ科のそれは指のような形をしている。ジュゴン科とマナティ科で形が違う理由は分かっていない。成体で は腸は体長の 9 ～ 16 倍になる。ジュゴンの成獣では大腸は小腸の約 2 倍の長さになるのに対して，マナティでは 大腸と小腸は同じ長さである。ジュゴンの盲腸は単一であるが，マナティの盲腸は先端が 2 つの角状に分岐して いる。解剖や形態の面から，海牛類は奇蹄目，長鼻目，ハイラックス目，齧歯目やカメ目のアオウミガメが属す る後腸動物に属する。 （ 2 ）ジュゴンは 4 科 18 種の海産顕花植物を摂餌する。淡水種であるアマゾンマナティを除いて，マナティは海域 から淡水域までに生息する多種多様な水生植物を摂餌する。アメリカマナティは 60 種以上の水生植物を摂餌す ることが報告されている。ジュゴンが好んで食べる海草は陸生の草食動物が主に食べる植物と比べて，粗タンパ ク質含有量が少なく，粗繊維含有量が多く，カロリーが低い。一方，マナティ科が食べる水生植物を同じ陸上植 物と比べると，粗タンパク質含有量が同等で，粗繊維含有量が少なく，カロリーが低い。陸生植物では水分が 7 5 ～ 80 ％であるのに比べて，水生植物では 85 ～ 95 ％が水分であるので，海牛類は自身の体を維持するために，大 量の植物を食べなければならない。 （ 3 ）それぞれの研究で餌料植物は異なるが，海牛類の消化率は 80 ～ 90 ％であり，陸上の非反芻動物はおろか， 反芻動物よりも高いことが知られている。海牛類の消化機能は他の草食動物と比べてかなり優れている。消化管 内容物の揮発性脂肪酸濃度の研究から，盲腸と大腸は餌料植物の繊維の分解と分解生成物の消化が行われる主な場所であることが考えられた。さらに，海牛類における餌料植物の体内滞留時間（ 120 ～ 216 時間）は，後腸動物であるウマ（ 23 ～ 45 時間）やゾウ（ 17 ～ 26 時間），オジロジカ（ 20 ～ 40 時間）といった他の後腸動物やウシ （ 48 ～ 65 時間）のような反芻動物と比べてとても長い。海牛類は消化管や消化機能を草食性という自身の摂餌 特性に適応させ，十分な栄養を体内に吸収するために少なくとも消化機能を 2 つの面で特化させた。 1 つは餌料 植物が長い大腸内をよりゆっくり通過させて，餌料植物の体内滞留時間を長くしたことである。 2 つ目は繊維の 分解とエネルギー吸収能力を高めるために，消化管内，特に盲腸や大腸に豊富な微生物を有するようになったこ とである。しかし，消化管内微生物に関する研究はいまだ行われていない。さらに，海牛頬の消化生理や消化機 能に関する知見はわずかである。今後，飼育環境下にある生存個体や，死亡個体を用いて，海牛類の消化機能に 関する知見をさらに増やしていく必要がある...|$|E
