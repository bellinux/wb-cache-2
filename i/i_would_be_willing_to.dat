2500|$|It was a {{formidable}} array of run-getters who on past efforts appears to tower above {{everything we could}} put in the field, {{and in the absence}} of O'Reilly the position seemed bleak and without hope. I asked Kippax what he thought...He said [...] "If Hutton, Compton and Hammond are anywhere near their pre-war form <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> concede them 250 runs an innings and ask them not to bat".|$|E
2500|$|The {{unemployment}} rate was about 25% and higher in major industrial and mining centers. Farm income had fallen by over 50% since 1929. An estimated 844,000 non-farm mortgages had been foreclosed between 1930â€“33, {{out of five}} million in all. Political and business leaders feared revolution and anarchy. Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr., who remained wealthy during the Depression, stated years later that, [...] "in those days I felt and said <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> part with half of what I had if I could be sure of keeping, under law and order, the other half".|$|E
2500|$|In June 2012, Romney said [...] "I {{can assure}} you, if I'm President, the Iranians {{will have no}} {{question}} but that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> take military action if necessary {{to prevent them from}} becoming a nuclear threat to the world." [...] In his July 2012 trip to Israel he said that preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear [...] "capability" [...] should be America's [...] "highest national security priority." [...] Romney has said of using military force against Iran, [...] "I don't believe at this stage, therefore, if I'm President, {{that we need to have}} war powers approval or a special authorization for military force." [...] He has refused to state if he would be open to using direct diplomacy to settle the issue with the Iranians.|$|E

[...] "Well, now," [...] she said, [...] "I have seen the woman <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> my son should marry." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{am certain}} {{there was some}} one here," [...] said Newcombe, {{speaking}} less decidedly than before, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> bet everything I own that it was Bob Hubbard." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I had {{rather be}} in heaven; though, only for my friends' sake, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> live. There {{are a great}} many things here that make me sad, that seem dreadful to me; I had rather be there; but I don't want to leave you,--it almost breaks my heart!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You mistake me, friend smith, I am not endeavoring to {{purchase}} your silence. I hold certain {{information relating to}} your parentage. This <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> impart to a friend, yet loath to do so to an enemy. A man doth not like to see his enemy in possession of fifteen thousand pounds a year.

6000|$|... "There {{are many}} ways. While <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> {{to take my}} oath to it, several of these ten-cent pieces look very much like those I lost night before last." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't {{say that}} I {{want to be}} arrested," [...] said Ralph, dubiously, [...] "for father and mother <b>would</b> think <b>I</b> had <b>been</b> doing {{something}} terrible; but <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> perfectly <b>willing</b> to stand it if it would do you any good." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell me, for Heaven's sake," [...] I exclaimed, [...] "the method--if method there is--by {{which you}} have been enabled to fathom my soul in this matter." [...] In fact I was even more startled than <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>willing</b> to express.|$|R

6000|$|... "Supposing," [...] I whispered, [...] "I have {{discovered}} something {{that seems to}} me better worth living for than anything else I have yet found in the world I know of--if that something belongs to a world in which I have not yet lived--do you blame me if for the sake of it <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> climb down even into----" ...|$|E

"An unworthy {{graduate}} of the Gay Science, my lord," [...] said the musician; [...] "yet let me say for myself, that I will not yield to the king of minstrels, Geoffrey Rudel, though the King of England hath given him four manors for one song. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> contend with him in romance, lay, or fable, were the judge to be King Henry himself." ...|$|E
60|$|There {{was nothing}} {{for me to do}} but to follow her. I greatly disliked going away without saying what I wanted to say, and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>willing</b> to speak even at the front door, but she gave me no chance.|$|R
6000|$|... "But I don't believe you, Alma. You're merely {{laughing}} at me. And, besides, with me you needn't give up art. We could work together. You {{know how much}} I admire your talent.

6000|$|... "If you fancy <b>I</b> <b>would</b> ever <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> to {{lose sight}} of either of you you are doing me a wrong. Haven't I been living on your bounty--on what you made by baking with your own little hands? Would we have found the gold if it hadn't been for you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{would not}} cost so much, Captain,' Jacob said confidently. 'I calls it just {{chucking}} money away {{as it is}} now. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> live on dry bread if you would take me. Three pennyworth a day would do me fine, and I could take my old clothes with me {{and put them on}} at nights and sleep anywhere. As to the trains, Captain, I could walk first-rate, and I expect I could get a lift in a waggon sometimes.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'She {{shall never}} have him!' I said to myself. 'I {{will make it}} the object {{of my life to}} live longer than he does. My {{grandfather}} lived to be much older than ordinary men, and why should not I have as long a life? Perhaps it was the things he ate and drank, and his jovial disposition, that gave him such longevity. If I were sure of this <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> take hot drinks at night, and wine at dinner. No; Bernard must not be left behind.' It was while making up my mind very firmly about this that I fell asleep.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{dare say}} {{you would feel}} lonesome. I should have felt lonesome myself if I did not light upon some mate going the same way. We got on very well together, Tom. When Pete Hoskings first put it to me whether <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> take you with me as far as this, I thought that though I liked you well enough, {{it would not be}} in my way to be playing a sort of {{schoolmaster}} business to a young tenderfoot; but I had got to like the notion before we left Denver, and now {{it seems to me that}} we have had a rare good time of it together." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then, if I {{were to be}} {{personally}} {{responsible for}} such sums as Mr. Carvel may need, <b>I</b> suppose you <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> to advance them to him." ...|$|R
60|$|But to {{continue}} our walk. We entered another Dutch apartment, embellished with works by Dietrich, prettily colored, and laboriously minute; then into a corridor devoted chiefly to the works of Rembrandt and scholars. In this also {{were a number of}} those minute culinary paintings, in which cabbages, brass kettles, onions, potatoes, &c., are reproduced with praiseworthy industry. Many people are enraptured with these; but for my part I have but a very little more pleasure in a turnip, onion, or potato in a picture than out, and always wish that the industry and richness of color had been bestowed upon things in themselves beautiful. The great Master, it is true, gives these models, but he gives them not to be looked at, but eaten. If painters could only contrive to paint vegetables (cheaply) so that they could <b>be</b> eaten, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Caesar said [...] "Why shouldn't I remember, even if I was exhausted? Because I {{was unable}} to walk I couldn't go to the nearby spring, and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>willing</b> to crawl there on hands and knees, {{if it were not}} for a good soldier, a brave industrious chap, hadn't brought me water in his helmet?" [...] to which the man replied, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} useless to search, {{and we are}} now in too much danger to waste any time," [...] Cummings said sternly. [...] "Our one chance of escape was to give the enemy the idea that we had succeeded in getting out of the country, and he has {{destroyed}} it. Now this portion of the forest will be filled with Indians, and in twenty-four hours from the moment he or his trail is seen, we shall be discovered. We cannot aid him, and I doubt whether <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> do so if it was possible, for a man of average common sense who will act as he has done deserves punishment." ...|$|E
60|$|While I {{was walking}} here, comes {{up one of}} my Comrades, and one who I always took for my {{particular}} Friend: I {{know what you are}} employ'd in, said he, while you seem only to be musing, and refreshing yourself with the cool Breeze. Why, said I, what am I musing about? Why, said he, you are studying how you should get away from us; but, muse upon it as long as you will, says he, you shall never go without me, for I am resolv'd to go with you which Way soever you take. 'Tis true, says I, I was musing which Way I should go, but not which Way I should go without you; for tho' <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> part Company, yet you cannot think I would go alone; and you know I have chosen you out from all the Company to be the Partner of all my Adventures.|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{is more in}} one {{of those}} eggs than in a whole nestful of Welcome Robin's eggs. It is a very long time since I have been lucky enough to taste a hen's egg, and now is my chance. I don't like having to go inside that henhouse, even though it is barely inside the door. I'm {{suspicious}} of doors. They have a way of closing most unexpectedly. I might see if I cannot get Unc' Billy Possum to bring one of those eggs out for me. But that plan won't do, come to think of it, because I can't trust Unc' Billy. The old sinner is too fond of eggs himself. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> divide with him, but he would be sure to eat his first, and I fear that it would taste so good that he would eat the other. No. I've got to get one of those eggs myself. It is the only way I can be sure of it.|$|E
5000|$|First, to sum {{the demand}} {{functions}} without other strong assumptions {{it must be}} assumed that they are independent; that is that one consumer's demand decisions are not influenced by the decisions of another consumer. For example, A is asked how many pairs of shoes he would buy at a certain price. A says at that price <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> and able to buy two pairs of shoes. B is {{asked the same question}} and says four pairs. Questioner goes back to A and says B <b>is</b> <b>willing</b> to buy four pairs of shoes, {{what do you think about}} that? A says if B has any interest in those shoes then I have none. Or A, not to be outdone by B, says [...] "then I'll buy five pairs". And on and on. This problem can be eliminated by assuming that the consumers' tastes are fixed in the short run. This assumption can be expressed as assuming that each consumer is an independent idiosyncratic decision maker.|$|R

6000|$|... 265. And now I am {{speaking}} my experience, I will in {{this place}} thrust in {{a word or two}} concerning my preaching the Word, and of God's dealing with me in that particular also. For after I had been about five or six years awakened, and helped 'myself' to see both the want and worth of Jesus Christ our Lord, and 'also' enabled to venture my soul upon him, some of the most able among the saints with us, I say the most able for judgment and holiness of life, as they conceived, did perceive that God had counted me worthy to understand something of his will in his holy and blessed Word, and had given me utterance, in some measure, to express what I saw to others for edification; 'therefore' they desired me, and that with much earnestness, that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing,</b> at sometimes, to take in hand, in one of the meetings, to speak a word of exhortation unto them.[58] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For {{years my}} hopes were fulfilled, {{and then at}} last he {{discovered}} me. Some Liverpool man who visited Buenos Ayres put him upon my track. He had lost all his money, and he thought that he would come over and share mine. Knowing my horror of him, he rightly thought that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> buy him off. I {{received a letter from}} him saying that he was coming. It was at a crisis in my own affairs, and his arrival might conceivably bring trouble, and even disgrace, upon some whom I was especially bound to shield from anything of the kind. I took steps to insure that any evil which might come should fall on me only, and that"--here he turned and looked at the prisoner--"was the cause of conduct upon my part which has been too harshly judged. My only motive was to screen those who were dear to me from any possible connection with scandal or disgrace. That scandal and disgrace would come with my brother was only to say that what had been would be again.|$|E
60|$|But, as I have said, poetry, {{was what}} his ardent spirit mainly meditated in that hour when I first knew him in Cambridge, {{before we had}} either of us grown old and sad, if not wise. He overflowed with it, and he talked as little as he dreamed of {{anything}} else in the vast half-summer we spent together. He was constantly at my house, where in an absence of my family I was living bachelor, and where we sat indoors and talked, or sauntered outdoors and talked, with our heads in a cloud of fancies, not unmixed with the mosquitoes of Cambridge: if I could have back the fancies, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> have the mosquitoes with them. He looked the poetry he lived: his eyes were the blue of sunlit fjords; his brown silken hair was thick on the crown which it later abandoned to a scholarly baldness; his soft, red lips half hid a boyish pout in the youthful beard and mustache. He was short of stature, but of a stalwart breadth of frame, and his voice was of a peculiar and endearing quality, indescribably mellow and tender when he read his verse.|$|E
60|$|A {{revival of}} shipbuilding, and {{particularly}} of iron steamship building, is of vast importance {{to our national}} prosperity. The United States is now paying over $100,000,000 per annum for freights and passage on foreign ships--to be carried abroad and expended in the employment and support of other peoples--beyond a fair percentage of what should go to foreign vessels, estimating on the tonnage and travel of each respectively. It is to be regretted that this disparity in the carrying trade exists, and to correct it <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> see a great departure from the usual course of Government in supporting what might usually be termed private enterprise. I would not suggest as a remedy direct subsidy to American steamship lines, but I would suggest the direct offer of ample compensation for carrying the mails between Atlantic Seaboard cities and the Continent on American-owned and American-built steamers, and would extend this liberality to vessels carrying the mails to South American States and to Central America and Mexico, and would pursue the same policy from our Pacific seaports to foreign seaports on the Pacific. It might be demanded that vessels built for this service should come up to a standard fixed by legislation in tonnage, speed, and all other qualities, looking {{to the possibility of}} Government requiring them at some time for war purposes. The right also of taking possession of them in such emergency should be guarded.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] replied Tommy. [...] "I {{expected}} you <b>would.</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> {{around for}} you at the same time. You're not afraid any more to go up there, are you?" ...|$|R
60|$|Had I {{looked upon}} {{myself as a}} wife, you cannot suppose <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>willing</b> to have let my husband lie with my maid, much less before my face, for I stood by all the while; but as I thought myself a whore, I cannot say {{but that it was}} {{something}} designed in my thoughts that my maid should be a whore too, and should not reproach me with it.|$|R
5000|$|In October 2009, the Sunday Telegraph {{claimed that}} Hind {{had said that}} he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> happy to be reordained as a priest in the Roman Catholic Church and that {{divisions}} in Anglicanism could {{make it impossible for}} him to stay in the Church of England.
