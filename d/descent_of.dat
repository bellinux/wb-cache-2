5|$|Among scientists, he {{is perhaps}} best known for his work on the {{ligament}} which bears his name.

5|$|It {{would be}} more than 40years before the first {{crossing}} of Antarctica was achieved, by the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition, 1955–58. This expedition set out from Vahsel Bay, following a route which avoided the Beardmore Glacier altogether, and bypassed much of the Ross Ice Shelf, reaching McMurdo Sound via a <b>descent</b> <b>of</b> the Skelton Glacier. The entire journey took 98days.|$|E
5|$|The most {{prominent}} festival held at Badrinath Temple is Mata Murti Ka Mela, which commemorates the <b>descent</b> <b>of</b> the river Ganges on mother earth.

The place where the river flowed became the holy land of Badrinath.|$|E

5|$|As it {{approaches}} {{the southern end}} of the Bruce Peninsula, the route bisects Port Elgin, then curves abruptly towards Lake Huron and passes through Southampton before curving to the east towards Owen Sound. Between those two places, the highway is generally straight, except at the boundary between Bruce and Grey Counties as well as the <b>descent</b> <b>of</b> the Niagara Escarpment at Springmount. Several communities line this inland stretch of highway, including Chippewa Hill, Kelly's Corners, Elsinore, Allenford, Alvanley and Jackson. At Springmount, the route encounters Highway 6, which joins Highway21 to form Ontario's only wrong-way concurrency east to Owen Sound.|$|E
5|$|Fragments 2 and 3, giving {{accounts}} of Jesus' baptism and temptation or transfiguration, {{spring from the}} widespread Greco-Roman myth of the <b>descent</b> <b>of</b> divine Wisdom; this underlies the parallel passages in the gospels of Matthew(11.25–30), Luke(7.18–35 and 11.49–51) and John(1.1–18), {{as well as the}} Gospel of Thomas. The differences between fragment 3 and the orthodox canonical gospels are considerable: their third-person narrative has become an account by Jesus himself, Satan is replaced by the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit is identified as Jesus' mother.|$|E
5|$|In 1842, Johannes Theodor Reinhardt {{proposed}} {{they were}} ground doves, based on studies of a dodo skull he had rediscovered {{in the royal}} Danish collection of Copenhagen. This view was met with ridicule, but later supported by Strickland and Melville, who suggested the common <b>descent</b> <b>of</b> the Rodrigues solitaire and the dodo in 1848, after dissecting the only known dodo specimen with soft tissue and comparing it with the few solitaire remains then available. Strickland stated that although not identical, these birds shared many distinguishing features in the leg bones, features which were otherwise known only in pigeons.|$|E

5|$|In many {{accounts}} {{of the development of}} evolutionary theory, Wallace is mentioned only in passing as simply being the stimulus to the publication of Darwin's own theory. In reality, Wallace developed his own distinct evolutionary views which diverged from Darwin's, and was considered by many (especially Darwin) to be a leading thinker on evolution in his day, whose ideas could not be ignored. One historian of science has pointed out that, through both private correspondence and published works, Darwin and Wallace exchanged knowledge and stimulated each other's ideas and theories over an extended period. Wallace is the most-cited naturalist in Darwin's <b>Descent</b> <b>of</b> Man, occasionally in strong disagreement.|$|E

5|$|Missouri Fox Trotters {{are used}} {{extensively}} by trail riders, who appreciate their gaits, stamina and weight-carrying abilities. They {{are also used}} in handicapped riding programs, and their smooth gait has proven useful for riders with minor physical disabilities. Crosses between Fox Trotter mares and donkey jacks are often made, creating mules with the fox trot gait {{that are used to}} carry hunters and trail riders, especially in the western United States. The US Forest Service also employs Fox Trotters for their speed, stamina and gait, and members of the breed were used to make the first horse-back <b>descent</b> <b>of</b> the north rim of the Grand Canyon.|$|E
