Lamptey was the beating heart of a very good side. His fast feet, speed of thought, and clever interplay with captain Alex Opoku and fellow midfielders Mohammed Gargo and Emmanuel Duah were on display for all to see. His willingness to get into the box was critical too, and his four goals made him joint top-goalscorer.|$|E

In 1823, 43,465 actions were brought in the King's Bench, 13,009 in the Common Pleas and 6,778 in the Exchequer of Pleas. Not surprisingly, the King's Bench judges were [...] "immoderately over burdened", the Common Pleas judges were [...] "fully occupied in term, and much engaged in vacation also" [...] and the Barons of the Exchequer were [...] "comparatively little occupied either in term or vacation".|$|E
500|$|Safran {{called the}} second season more cohesive, {{mirroring}} the first season and [...] "... keep the two-storyline structure". In an interview, he confirmed that the structure would be [...] "a little bit of flash-forward, but the majority will be what I like to call the present". According to Safran, the producers aimed at a more-mature, darker second season which would be [...] "less confusing" [...] to viewers. Safran had plotted an upcoming plot point as the first season ended, which saw Alex clearing her name, getting fired by the FBI and receiving a job offer by the CIA director. He revealed that the season-two storyline would focus on the contrasting work ethics of the FBI and the CIA. Safran elaborated {{about the differences between}} the FBI and CIA, saying: [...] "We're very interested {{in the fact that the}} FBI's so much about being honest, truthful and living up to your badge. And the CIA is the opposite. You succeed if you can deceive. So it's going to be interesting to see. It's like a funhouse mirror of what we've seen". He announced that the series would switch to a single timeline after the fourteenth episode. Safran said that {{the second season}} always intended to adopt a single timeline after the resolved storyline and the aftermath of the hostage crisis, adding [...] "When we broke Season 2, we knew we were going to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> timeline, because it’s about the [...] event, and then it’s about what happens after the event. And you can’t flashback to the Farm after the crisis is over". He said that the change was also due to viewer complaints that the first season's dual timeline was confusing.|$|E

500|$|She {{differed}} from her sister ships mainly in her main armament. She had six [...] Model 1886 35-caliber guns mounted in twin barbette mounts, two forward, side by side, and one aft. Each of the forward mounts could traverse 30° across {{the bow and}} 35° abaft the beam, or a total of 155°. The rear mount could traverse 202°. They had a range of elevation from −2° to +15°. Chesmas guns were mounted on unbalanced turntables and they caused her to list when the guns were trained to one side. Traversing all the guns {{as far as they}} could <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> side produced a list of 7.6° and made it very difficult for the turntable machinery to rotate the guns back to the fore-and-aft position. This problem had been anticipated and water tanks had been added to counteract the list, but they proved to be virtually useless because they took up to two hours to fill. The problem was partially cured in 1892 when the equipment was rearranged on the turntable to improve their balance, but more thorough solutions to the problem were either deemed too expensive or inadequate. Their rate of fire was reportedly one round every fifteen to seventeen minutes, including training time. Sixty rounds per gun were carried. The main guns were mounted very low, (only [...] ) above the main deck, and caused extensive damage to the deck when fired over the bow or stern. They fired a 'light' shell that weighed [...] or a 'heavy' shell that weighed [...] The 'light' shell had a muzzle velocity of [...] while the 'heavy' shell could only be propelled at a velocity of [...] The 'light' shell had a maximum range of [...] when fired at an elevation of 15°.|$|E
500|$|The main {{armament}} of the Ekaterina II-class ships {{consisted of}} three pairs of [...] guns mounted in twin-gun barbettes. In an arrangement very unusual for such large guns, two barbettes were placed forward side-by-side, while the third barbette was aft of the superstructure. Each of the forward mounts could traverse 30° across the bow and 35° abaft the beam, or a total of 155°. The rear mount could traverse 202°. The main guns were mounted very low, (only [...] ) above the main deck, and caused extensive damage to the deck when fired over the bow or stern. Two different guns were used; Ekaterina II and Sinop had 30-caliber Pattern 1877 guns while Chesma and Georgii Pobedonosets had 35-caliber Obukhov Pattern 1886 guns. Both guns had elevation limits of −2° to +15°. Their rate of fire was about one round every four to five minutes, including training time, and 60 rounds per gun were carried. Each ship had {{a different type of}} mount inside the barbette; Ekaterina II used bulky, hydraulically powered Moncrieff disappearing gun mounts which proved to be larger than estimated and the outer edges of the armored redoubt had to be carried out over the ships' sides on sponsons on the first two ships completed, Ekaterina II and Chesma, although Chesmas guns were not disappearing. By the time that Sinop and Georgii Pobedonosets were finished the gun mount had been reduced in size enough that the sponsons could be eliminated. But the new and smaller redoubt proved to be too small for the 12-inch 35-caliber gun and Sinop had to use the older 30-caliber weapon. In contrast the Georgii Pobedonosetss redoubt was designed to use the newer gun. Chesmas guns were mounted on unbalanced turntables and they caused her to list when the guns were trained to one side. Traversing all the guns as far as they could <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> side produced a list of 7.6° and made it very difficult for the turntable machinery to rotate the guns back to the fore-and-aft position.
