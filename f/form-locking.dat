40|$|The {{recently}} developed Zeppelin NT {{which is the}} first modern semi-rigid airship, contains a lightweight truss structure, where the transverse trusses are made of innovative carbonfiber struts with extremely high specific stiffness and strength. The superior mechanical properties of such struts can only be utilized with appropriate load transfer elements. A design of a special <b>form-locking</b> load transfer element for high tensile and compressive loads as well as two different strut connections are described. The most advanced option is an active strut which contains an embedded piezo actuator by means of which the active variation of the strut length becomes possible, even for high frequencies. Once integrated into a truss structure, vibrations can thus be very effectively suppressed. Experimental results obtained with a demonstrator are discussed. Flight comfort in the new generation airships could well be improved by such kind of active truss structures...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} improve the quality of mail piece stacking, an {{engineering}} model of an output module has been developed and tested by DETECON and FHG-IML under the master agreement between DETECON and the United States Postal Service in an R and D - project. The origin of the technical approach for this output module was a concept for an Advanced Letter Sorter with a multilevel transporter, that required a horizontal output stacker. One output module has to reach up to four different levels of the transporter so that the vertical space required by the output stacker had to be minimized. Considering the heterogeneous composition of manual letter mail and its differing physical characteristics, a nearly <b>form-locking</b> transfer of mail pieces between transporter carriers and stack was favoured. As a consequence, the transmission had to be effected with minimal friction influences. This paper describes the functional principle, the main components of the output module, and the results and parame ters of several tests...|$|E
40|$|The {{final design}} of the {{structural}} system for the ITER EC H&CD upper launcher is in progress. Many design features of the preliminary design are under revision with the aim to achieve the built-to-print-status. This paper deals with design and analysis of a bolted joint for the Blanket Shield Module with special perspective on Remote Handling capability. The BSM of the ECH Launcher {{is attached to the}} Launcher Main Frame by a bolted joint conceived so that in the Hot Cell Facility, RH maintenance can be performed on internal components. The joint must be capable to resist very high Electro-Magnetic loads from disruptions, while it has to sustain substantial thermal cycling during operation. Thus the need for a rigid and reliable design is essential. Beside the set of pre-stressed bolts the flanges were therefore equipped with additional shear keys to divert radial moments away from the bolts. Main focus of the work performed was the mechanical {{design of the}} joint and the assessment of the structural integrity with respect to the loads applied and its capability for maintenance by RH procedures. To fulfill a major aspect of the RH requirements, the bolts were designed as captive in order to avoid their accidental removal from the joint. The captive bolt design is based on a concept that uses a dedicated spring ring, a standard spiral spring and a tensioning screw with two threads to secure the bolts in a <b>form-locking</b> stop. The final approval phase of the RH compatibility foresees simulations in Virtual Reality and physical tests on prototypes...|$|E
