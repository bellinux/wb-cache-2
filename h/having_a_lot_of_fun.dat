He brought along his girlfriend, then unknown aspiring singer Madonna. Gagosian recalls, “Everything was going along fine. Jean-Michel was making paintings, I was selling them, and we were <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun.</b> But then one day Jean-Michel said, ‘My girlfriend is coming to stay with me.’ I was a little concerned-one too many eggs can spoil an omelet, you know? So I said, ‘Well, what’s she like?’ And he said, He said, ‘Her name is Madonna and she’s going to be huge.’ I’ll never forget that he said that. So Madonna came out and stayed {{for a few months}} and we all got along like one big, happy family.” During this time he took considerable interest in the work that Robert Rauschenberg was producing at Gemini G.E.L. in West Hollywood, visiting him on several occasions and finding inspiration in the accomplishments of the painter. In 1982, Basquiat worked briefly with musician and artist David Bowie.|$|E

500|$|Cranston's {{performance}} {{was a frequent}} topic in the critiques. Even prior to the airing of the episode, James Hibberd of Entertainment Weekly suggested that the actor's voice would be perfect for an animated television series. VanDerWerff and Carp were amongst the journalists who issued favorable assessments of Cranston's acting. Carp noted that [...] "Cranston's work is even more impressive {{when you consider that}} he not only plays the hero and villain but manages to be funny as both." [...] In addressing [...] "Part II", Carp concluded that [...] "as early as the stunning end of the world sequence, the actor plants the hint of suppressed craziness in Spaceman Drake and it was soon obvious that the just crew would not only be manning a mission to help him combat the mutineers but probably get wrapped up in this nut's dream to terra form Mars." [...] For VanDerWerff, [...] "Cranston is the very best kind of guest voice, fully inhabiting his character but also <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> with the jokes.

[...] His first relationship developed when he attracted the attention of ward sisters Chrissie Williams and Daisha Anderson. Daisha showed less interest in him than Chrissie, of whose attentiveness Anderson said, [...] "I think any hot-blooded male would find that attractive". Oliver appeared to ruin his chances with Daisha when he encouraged a patient to complain about her diagnosis – though Anderson noted, [...] "he does apologise to Daisha, and sweetly gives her a cupcake".

Lyrically, the song's theme is death. [...] "Erase This", formerly titled [...] "Vanilla", was noted by Mary Ouellette of Loudwire as an [...] "uptempo rocker" [...] similar to [...] "What You Want" [...] which would sound better played live {{rather than through}} earphones. [...] "Lost in Paradise" [...] is a symphonic rock ballad which begins with piano, strings and Lee's unlayered vocals before adding the band for the song's climax; its lyrics reflect Lee's past struggles, apologizing to her fans for the band's five-year absence. The song's musical structure was compared to [...] "Jóga", by the Icelandic recording artist Björk. [...] "Sick" [...] has a loose, lazy melody and a chanted chorus; {{one of the first}} songs written for the album, it [...] "set a heavy direction {{for the rest of the}} record." [...] "End of the Dream" [...] begins [...] "full bore with chunky guitar, then falls into a brooding grove with piano underpinning Lee's unmistakable vocals." [...] In the chorus, Lee sings [...] "Follow your heart 'til it bleeds," [...] evincing the track's [...] "seize the day" [...] message. Lee said about the song, [...] "It's about understanding that this life isn't forever, and how you have to live it, embrace even the pain, before it's all over. As much as it hurts, it just means you're alive. So don't be so afraid to get hurt that you miss out on living." [...] "Oceans" [...] begins with a big, low synth and a vocal before the band joins in. According to Lee, [...] "It's big and lush. We've been <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> playing that one especially." [...] "Never Go Back" [...] (originally called [...] "Orange") examines [...] "loss from the perspective of someone losing someone in a tragedy". Lee said that the song, with the lyrics [...] "It's all gone, the only world I've ever known", was inspired by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. [...] "Swimming Home" [...] is an electro-pop song with grinding guitars and a [...] "weeping" [...] piano.|$|E

[...] It was then they realized that the initials proposed different explanations of the name, one of them being the DNA of Madonna. When discussing the album on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Madonna explained that the title is a triple entendre, representing both her name and her DNA, as well as a reference to the drug MDMA, commonly known as ecstasy. The name MDNA as album title was condemned by Lucy Dawe, a spokesperson for the anti-drugs campaign group Cannabis Skunk Sense, who felt that Madonna's choice of the title was [...] "an ill advised decision".|$|E
