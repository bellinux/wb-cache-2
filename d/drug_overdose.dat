2500|$|The word [...] "overdose" [...] {{implies that}} there is a common safe dosage and usage for the drug; therefore, the term is {{commonly}} only applied to drugs, not poisons, though even poisons are harmless at a low enough dosage. <b>Drug</b> <b>overdoses</b> are sometimes caused intentionally to commit suicide, parasuicide or as self-harm, but many <b>drug</b> <b>overdoses</b> are accidental, the result of intentional or unintentional misuse of medication. Intentional misuse leading to overdose can include using prescribed or unprescribed drugs in excessive quantities in an attempt to produce euphoria.|$|R

5|$|<b>Drug</b> <b>overdose</b> and {{intoxication}} {{are significant}} causes of accidental death, {{and can also}} be used as a form of suicide. Death can occur from overdosing on a single or multiple drugs, or from combined drug intoxication (CDI) due to poly drug use. Poly drug use often carries more risk than use of a single drug, due to an increase in side effects, and drug synergy. For example, the chance of death from overdosing on opiates is greatly increased when they are consumed in conjunction with alcohol. While they are two distinct phenomena, deaths from CDI are often misreported as overdoses. Drug overdoses and intoxication can also cause indirect deaths. For example, while marijuana does not cause fatal overdoses, being intoxicated by it can increase the chance of fatal traffic collisions.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Long-term {{complications}} of sympathomimetic <b>drug</b> <b>overdosing</b> {{have not been}} adequately investigated in infants and young children. Despite reports discouraging their use in children, these formulations are frequently administered for “cold-like symptoms”. Their frequent adverse events are different forms of arrhythmias, including multifocal atrial tachycardia. Case presentation A 3 -year-old toddler developed multifocal atrial tachycardia following an iatrogenic overdose of epinephrine accidentally administered intravenously. His ECG showed wandering atrial pacemaker (p-waves with different origins and configurations) that persisted {{for at least one}} year. This event demonstrated the sensitivity of young children to the sympathomimetic <b>drugs,</b> especially <b>overdosing.</b> Conclusions Health care providers and parents should be warned of toxicities associated with sympathomimetic <b>drug</b> <b>overdosing.</b> Future studies are needed to determine whether wandering atrial pacemaker is a potential long-term complication of high-dose sympathomimetics. </p...|$|R

According to initial reports, Sunanda was suspected to have committed suicide. Later reports stated that {{the cause of death was}} unnatural; the doctors at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences gave a preliminary autopsy report that revealed injury marks on her body. They said that these injuries may or may not be the cause of death. The autopsy indicated that she died of <b>drug</b> <b>overdose,</b> most likely a combination of sedatives, other strong medicines and probably alcohol.

5|$|Parker {{was listed}} as a Communist by the {{publication}} Red Channels in 1950. The FBI compiled a 1,000-page dossier on her because of her suspected involvement in Communism during the McCarthy era. As a result, she {{was placed on the}} Hollywood blacklist by the movie studio bosses. Her final screenplay was The Fan, a 1949 adaptation of Oscar Wilde's Lady Windermere's Fan, directed by Otto Preminger. Her marriage to Campbell was tempestuous, with tensions exacerbated by Parker's increasing alcohol consumption and Campbell's long-term affair with a married woman in Europe during World War II. They divorced in 1947, remarried in 1950, then separated in 1952 when Parker moved back to New York. From 1957 to 1962, she lived at the Volney Residential Hotel on Manhattan's Upper East Side and wrote book reviews for Esquire magazine. Her writing became increasingly erratic due to her continued abuse of alcohol. She returned to Hollywood in 1961, reconciled with Campbell, and collaborated with him on a number of unproduced projects until Campbell died from a <b>drug</b> <b>overdose</b> in 1963.|$|E
