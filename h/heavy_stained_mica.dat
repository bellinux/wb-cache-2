40|$|Abstract Background Results of {{previous}} autopsy {{studies indicate that}} increased hepatic iron stores or hepatic iron overload is common in African Americans dying in hospitals, {{but there are no}} reports of hepatic iron content in other cohorts of African Americans. Methods We investigated the prevalence of heavy liver iron deposition in African American adults. Using established histochemical criteria, we graded Perls' acid ferrocyanide-reactive iron in the hepatocytes and Kupffer cells of 341 consecutive African American adults who were autopsied in the coroner/medical examiner office. <b>Heavy</b> <b>staining</b> was defined as grade 3 or 4 hepatocyte iron or grade 3 Kupffer cell iron. Results There were 254 men and 85 women (mean age ± 1 SD: 44 ± 13 y vs. 48 ± 14 y, respectively; p = 0. 0255); gender was unstated or unknown in two subjects. Approximately one-third of subjects died of natural causes. <b>Heavy</b> <b>staining</b> was observed in 10. 2 % of men and 4. 7 % of women. 23 subjects had <b>heavy</b> hepatocyte <b>staining</b> only, six had <b>heavy</b> Kupffer cell <b>staining</b> only, and one had a mixed pattern of <b>heavy</b> <b>staining.</b> 15 subjects had histories of chronic alcoholism; three had <b>heavy</b> <b>staining</b> confined to hepatocytes. We analyzed the relationships of three continuous variables (age at death in years, hepatocyte iron grade, Kupffer cell iron grade) and two categorical variables (sex, cause of death (natural and non-natural causes)) in all 341 subjects using a correlation matrix with Bonferroni correction. This revealed two positive correlations: hepatocyte with Kupffer cell iron grades (p Conclusions The present results confirm and extend previous observations that <b>heavy</b> liver iron <b>staining</b> is relatively common in African Americans. The pertinence of these observations to genetic and acquired causes of iron overload in African Americans is discussed. </p...|$|R

After electrophoresis of a rat microsomal liver sample followed by blotting, an incubation was performed of a primary antibody against a purified cytochrome P- 450 fraction. Enzyme-labelled second antibodies with horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase and xanthine oxidase were used for detection. Both colorimetric and chemiluminescent methods were investigated. It appeared that chemiluminescence detection of horseradish peroxidase was the most sensitive method. followed by chemiluminescence detection of xanthine oxidase. Horseradish peroxidase with colorimetric detection was also fairly sensitive {{and easier to use}} than chemiluminescence detection. Alkaline phosphatase gave the least sensitive method with both colorimetric and chemiluminescence detection. Both horseradish peroxidase and especially alkaline phosphatase showed <b>heavy</b> background <b>staining,</b> in contrast to xanthine oxidase, where no background was observed even after overnight exposure. A number of blot experiments on nylonmembrane, for a more sensitive detection of alkaline phosphatase, did not give better results in sensitivity. Both colorimetric and chemiluminescence detection showed <b>heavy</b> background <b>staining</b> on nylonmembrane. The <b>heavy</b> background <b>staining</b> after chemiluminescence detection of horseradish peroxidase was less by using the second antibody in smaller concentration.

40|$|AbstractIn the {{presence}} of Ca 2 + bound to calmodulin, Ca 2 +/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMK II) exhibits an intramolecular autophosphorylation and modulates many cell functions. In this study, the role of CaMK II in pepsinogen secretion was investigated in cultured guinea pig chief cells by using a specific CaMK II inhibitor, 1 -[N,O-Bis(5 -isoquinolinesulfonyl) -N-methyl-l-tyrosyl]- 4 -phenyl-piperazine (KN- 62), and an antibody for the Thr- 286 -autophosphorylated α subunit of CaMK II which specifically recognized the autophosphorylated form of CaMK II. KN- 62 inhibited the pepsinogen secretion stimulated by carbamylcholine chloride, cholecystokinin octapeptide, and ionomycin in a dose-dependent manner without affecting intracellular Ca 2 + concentrations, but {{had no effect on}} the secretion by 12 -O-tetradecanoyl phorbol- 13 -acetate (TPA) and forskolin. <b>Heavy</b> <b>staining</b> with the antibody for autophosphorylated CaMK II was observed in the cytoplasm of chief cells treated with carbamylcholine chloride or ionomycin, but only light staining was seen in cells treated with TPA or forskolin.

In the central nervous system, cells that stain positively for dynorphin {{are found in the}} supraoptic nucleus, with less-well-stained cells in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. Few positive fibers were detected in brain, suggesting problems with fixation and preservation of antigenicity. In pituitary no staining was seen in the anterior and intermediate lobes but <b>heavy</b> <b>staining</b> was detected in the posterior lobe. In the guinea pig, adrenal chromaffin cells stained with dynorphin antisera. Staining of these cells could be blocked with excess of dynorphin-(1 - 13) or either enkephalin. Radioimmunoassays revealed a great excess of the enkephalins in the adrenal, suggesting cross competition between dynorphin antiserum and adrenal medullary enkephalin. Finally, the dynorphin antiserum stained a complex of fibers in guinea pig ileum. Staining of these fibers could be blocked by moderate amounts of enkephalin as well as by smaller amounts of dynorphin-(1 - 13). We conclude that in some places (brain and pituitary) dynorphin exists separately from leucine-enkephalin. In other parts of brain and in the periphery the relationship between dynorphin and the enkephalins is very complex and requires further study and improved antisera...|$|R

Saturable binding of STX was significantly higher in homogenized Schwann cells (410 +/- 37 fmol/mg of protein) than in intact Schwann cells (214 +/- 21 fmol/mg of protein). Moreover, the equilibrium dissociation constant was higher for homogenized preparations (1. 77 +/- 0. 37 nM) than for intact Schwann cells (1. 06 +/- 0. 29 nM).

Macrophages positive for NADPH-d were observed in all uterine sections but appeared to migrate out of the implantation site and cluster in the mesometrium and interimplantation zones beginning on Day 4. NADPH-d activity was seen in the luminal and glandular epithelium and in several isolated fibers coursing through the myometrium. Many branches of the uterine artery also expressed activity, with the most intense staining in the vessels of the mesometrium. However, the most remarkable staining began on Day 6 within the primary decidual zone. When the stromal cells underwent decidualization, they began to show NADPH-d activity, with the pattern of activity matching the expanding area of decidualization. By Day 9 most of the decidual cell reaction had occurred and the mesometrial decidual staining began to decrease. However, the blood vessels and the cells surrounding the developing blood spaces continued to express activity, and <b>heavy</b> <b>staining</b> was evident within the antimesometrial decidua. No NADPH-d activity was seen in any of the trophoblast cells at any time, or in embryonic tissue, except on Day 8. NADPH-d has been used to identify nitric oxide (NO) synthase.

These adrenergic hormones have profound effects on cardiovascular development and function, yet relatively little {{information is available}} about the specific tissue distribution of adrenergic cells within the adult heart. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to define the anatomical localization of cells derived from an adrenergic lineage within the adult heart. To accomplish this, we performed genetic fate-mapping experiments where mice with the cre-recombinase (Cre) gene inserted into the phenylethanolamine-n-methyltransferase (Pnmt) locus were cross-mated with homozygous Rosa 26 reporter (R 26 R) mice. Because Pnmt serves as a marker gene for adrenergic cells, offspring from these matings express the b-galactosidase (bGAL) reporter gene in cells of an adrenergic lineage. bGAL expression was found throughout the adult mouse heart, but was predominantly (89 %) located in the left atrium (LA) and ventricle (LV) (p, 0. 001 compared to RA and RV), where many of these cells appeared to have cardiomyocyte-like morphological and structural characteristics.

MethodsAtherosclerotic plaques of 217 patients who underwent a common femoral artery endarterectomy (CFAE; n = 124) or remote superficial femoral artery endarterectomy (RSFAE; n = 93) were examined and scored microscopically for the presence of collagen, macrophages, smooth muscle cells, lipid core, intraplaque hemorrhage, and calcifications. The 12 -month restenosis rate was assessed using duplex ultrasound imaging (peak systolic velocity [PSV] ratio ≥ 2. 5). ResultsThe 1 -year restenosis rate was 66 % (61 of 93) after RSFAE compared to 21 % (26 of 124) after CFAE. Plaque with characteristics of high collagen and smooth muscle cell content were positively associated with the occurrence of restenosis, with odds ratios (ORs) of 2. 90 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 82 - 4. 68) and 2. 20 (1. 50 - 3. 20) for superficial femoral artery (SFA) and common femoral artery (CFA), respectively. SFA plaques showed significantly <b>heavier</b> <b>staining</b> for collagen (69 % vs 31 % for CFA; P <. 001) and smooth muscle cells (64 % vs 36 % for CFA; P <. 001). After multivariate analysis, the operation type (CFAE or RSFAE), gender, and the presence of collagen were independent predictive variables for restenosis after endarterectomy of the CFA and SFA. ConclusionPlaque composition of the CFA and SFA differs. Furthermore, the dissection of a fibrous collagen-rich plaque is an independent predictive variable for restenosis after endarterectomy of the CFA and SFA...|$|R
