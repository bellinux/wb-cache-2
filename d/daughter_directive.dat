It described the approach as to how air quality would be assessed and managed in the EU member states. It lists the pollutants for which air quality standards and objectives would be developed and specified in legislation (EU, 1996).

40|$|A {{study of}} the {{equivalence}} to the reference methods of the Radiello samplers for ozone (O 3) and benzene {{as well as the}} membrane-closed Palmes tube (MCPT) for nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) is presented. These samplers benefit from new model equations capable of estimating their uptake rate. For O 3, the aim here was to demonstrate the equivalence for the reference period of 8 hours and 120 µg m-³, the target value stated in the 3 rd <b>Daughter</b> <b>Directive.</b> For benzene, the demonstration of equivalence to the annual limit value of 5 µg. m- 3 as stated in the 2 nd <b>Daughter</b> <b>Directive</b> was examined. In the case of NO 2, the equivalence to the annual limit value as stated in the 1 st <b>Daughter</b> <b>Directive</b> (40 µg m-³) was considered. Results show that the radial sampler for O 3 fails to meet the Data Quality Objective (DQO) for continuous monitoring. However, with an expanded uncertainty of less than 30 %, the O 3 diffusive sampler fulfils the DQO for indicative measurements. For benzene, the Radiello sampler exposed for 7 days gave satisfying results showing the ability of the sampler to meet the DQO of the reference method. Nevertheless, the field tests should be complemented by measurements for a wider range of benzene concentrations. In the case of NO 2, all the results of the laboratory and field experiments respected the requirements of the demonstration of equivalence. Overall, these findings thus show that the Radiello sampler and the MCPT are equivalent to the reference methods only for assessment of benzene and NO 2 respectively. JRC.

30|$|The {{main focus}} of the work {{presented}} here is on chemical pollution of aquatic ecosystems and topics relevant for the future development of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) of the European Union. The WFD {{is dedicated to the}} protection and restoration of a good ecological and chemical status of European surface waters. In the WFD <b>daughter</b> <b>Directive</b> 2013 / 39 /EU, priority substances are identified and environmental quality standards (EQS) for them are defined. For priority hazardous substances, phasing out and cessation of emissions are required within a set time frame. Prioritisation is, therefore, a central operational concept in the management of polluting chemicals in the water environment in line with the WFD. Several different approaches for prioritisation are available, with different combinations of methods for risk assessment and ranking [11]. Risk assessment and prioritisation in the WFD currently are a site-specific- and retrospective approach and are, thus, based on concentrations of chemicals already present in the environment. For future development of the WFD, {{there is a need to}} develop more comprehensive methods to evaluate hazards and risks of chemicals and their mixtures as well as options to reduce and manage these risks.|$|E
40|$|With the {{implementation}} of the Water Framework Directive and the <b>daughter</b> <b>directive</b> on Environmental Quality Standards (EQS), the development of EQS values for biota has become an important issue. However, for certain hydrophobic compounds, bioaccumulation and biomagnification in the food chain may occur. In this case, it is important to analyze, if depending on the food web and diet preferences, bioaccumulation values could be different for the same species in different ecosystems. To analyze this effect, we have studied four terrestrial and aquatic trophic network models generated previously for three similar lakes and a costal lagoon. In addition a simple ecological plus bioaccumulation model has been developed for analyzing diet preferences which could not be assessed using the developed trophic food webs. The objective was to assess if the similarities and differences between calculated trophic level could have consequences on the bioaccumulation and biomagnification potential of contaminants. The results indicate that differences of around two orders of magnitude can be expected for similar ecosystems. These results are important since they indicate that the ecosystem structure should be first assessed for the development of EQS for biota and that without this information intercomparison exercises between EU ecosystems are not possible.

40|$|Water {{is a vital}} {{resource}} for natural ecosystems and human life, and assuring a high quality of water and protecting it from chemical contamination is a major societal goal in the European Union. The Water Framework Directive (WFD) and its <b>daughter</b> <b>directives</b> are the major body of legislation for the protection and sustainable use of European freshwater resources. The practical implementation of the WFD with regard to chemical pollution has faced some challenges. In support of the upcoming WFD review in 2019 the research project SOLUTIONS and the European monitoring network NORMAN has analyzed these challenges, evaluated the state-of-the-art of the science and suggested possible solutions. We give 10 recommendations to improve monitoring and to strengthen comprehensive prioritization, to foster consistent assessment and to support solution-oriented management of surface waters. The integration of effect-based tools, the application of passive sampling for bioaccumulative chemicals and an integrated strategy for prioritization of contaminants, accounting for knowledge gaps, are seen as important approaches to advance monitoring. Including all relevant chemical contaminants in more holistic "chemical status" assessment, using effect-based trigger values to address priority mixtures of chemicals, to better consider historical burdens accumulated in sediments and to use models to fill data gaps are recommended for a consistent assessment of contamination. Solution-oriented management should apply a tiered approach in investigative monitoring, to identify toxicity drivers, strengthen consistent legislative frameworks and apply solutions-oriented approaches that explore risk reduction scenarios before and along with risk assessment.

40|$|As is well known, {{anthropogenic}} {{activities have}} altered the chemical composition of the atmosphere resulting {{not only in the}} loss of its natural protection against harmful UV radiation, but in the addition/increase of hazardous chemical constituents to the atmosphere near the surface. It is this fact that has lead to the funding of numerous EU, ESA, and global and national studies (e. g., APHEIS, CAFE) and to treaties and directives (e. g., CLRTAP, EU 96 / 62 and <b>daughter</b> <b>directives)</b> aimed at understanding and mitigating these hazards. The studies and directives have prompted many research efforts into the modelling (for both monitoring and forecast) of ambient air quality and chemical weather. But because of the extent and constantly changing nature of the atmosphere, the use of earth observation (EO) data derived from satellites to study and monitor the atmosphere is a critical component of an integrated modelling system which also includes in-situ data. This presentation will highlight the progress made in implementing such an integrated system for forecast and modelling of several ambient atmospheric constituents at the German Remote Sensing Data Center of the German Aerospace Center (DFD-DLR).

40|$|The European Community {{ambient air}} quality {{legislation}} has the objective of mitigating human health and ecological damage due to air pollution in the EU. To achieve this objective, an EU-wide air quality assessment (monitoring, modelling as well as objective estimation) is required that enables comparisons of pollutant concentration levels against the defined European Union limit or target values within and between the Member states. The Ambient Air "Framework" Directive was published in 1996, and since then four "Daughter" Directives have been published. More recently the EC has prepared, through the Clean Air for Europe Programme, {{a proposal for a}} new Directive entitled "Directive of the European Parliament and Council on Ambient Air quality and Cleaner Air for Europe". The main novelty is the introduction of new fine particle PM 2. 5 objectives and the corresponding monitoring requirements. The proposal also merges and updates the original Framework and the first 3 <b>Daughter</b> <b>Directives.</b> These Directives require EU Member States to nominate "competent bodies" to carry out a number of tasks at a national level including: a) 	Assessment of {{ambient air quality}}; b) 	Approval of measurement systems (methods, equipment, networks and laboratories); c) 	Ensuring the accuracy of measurements; d) 	Analysis of assessment methods; e) 	Coordination on their territory if Community-wide quality assurance programmes are being organised by the Commission. Formally, the responsibility for these tasks usually lies with the corresponding environmental ministries at the national, regional or even local level. The technical implementation at the national level however, in particular when coordinating the nation-wide quality assurance programmes and participation in the Community-wide QA/QC programmes, is left to one or several bodies within the Member State known as the ¿National Reference Laboratories¿ (NRLs). AQUILA as the formal network of these laboratories has been established in 2001 {{with the support of the}} two European Commission services that are involved in the development and implementation of the Community ambient air quality legislation: Joint Research Centre ¿ Institute for Environment and Sustainability, and DG Environment.

40|$|When {{the first}} <b>Daughter</b> <b>Directive</b> (1999 / 30 /EC) {{relating}} to limit values for NOx, SO 2, Pb and PM 10 in ambient air came into force in July 1999, {{this was the}} result of a careful examination of all available evidence.

As a result monitoring of PM 10 was intensified in Flanders, Belgium. Gradually it was realized that PM 10 more complex, because of the large transboundary contribution, and because of the many constituents of PM 10 varying in time and space. This has led to years of research and studies, both for policy support and for industry, to develop a clear understanding of the PM problem and to generate possible solutions to attain the limit values. In general the key question that has driven policy oriented research was “Do we know where PM 10 comes from, and to which extent local or regional measures will have effect on the PM 10 levels in Flanders? ” The secondary questions that have been addressed were: • Is it possible to estimate the contribution of different (industrial) sectors to PM 10...|$|E
40|$|A {{review of}} {{experimental}} data has been performed {{to study the}} relationships between EQS defined for surface waters in the <b>Daughter</b> <b>Directive</b> (COM (2006) 397) and possible EQS defined for sediments. The analysis of experimental data {{showed that even though}} in some specific cases there is a coupling between water column and sediments, this coupling is rather the exception. Therefore it is not recommendable to use water column data to assess the chemical quality status of sediments. At the moment EQS have been defined for the water column and therefore these EQS will assess only the compliance with good chemical status of surface waters. It is clear that the good chemical quality of a water body will depend on having good chemical quality of surface water and sediments and that to assess both it is necessary to measure in both media. The EQS developed for water could be applied to pore water (interstitial water); hence, there would be no need of developing another set of EQS. However, the measurement of pore water concentrations faces several technical problems. Therefore, the partitioning approach has been proposed as a solution to calculate sediment EQS from water EQS. Unfortunately, in this case an uncertainty between 2 - 3 orders of magnitude is added to the procedure and this is not adequate for setting sediment EQS. It is expected that analytical developments will improve the actual situation. JRC. H. 5 -Rural, water and ecosystem resource...|$|E
40|$|The Natural Sources of pollutants, such as Sahara desert dust {{outbreaks}} or ashes from vulcanoes, in many cases, {{could grow}} the bad air quality forecast and PM limits values measured could exeed the European Law recomendations, {{in that case}} the country {{have to pay to}} the Community if an evidence of that is a Natural Pollutant is not brought to the European Court. The goal to control air quality could be reached studying the pollution sources, the dispersion with atmospheric model, the chemical reactions occurring and also the study of air depositions. Exeedences of air quality limit value represent breaches of Community law which can have significant legal consequences for the European Member States. For some existing limit values, such as those in the directive 1999 / 30 /EC (first <b>daughter</b> <b>Directive),</b> an exeedence which is caused by particular natural sources can be ignored for the purpose of ensuring compliance with Community law; article 2. 15 of the first <b>daughter</b> <b>directive</b> defines “natural events” as volcanic eruptions, seismic activities, geothermal activities, wild-land fires, high wind events or the atmospheric resuspension or transport of natural particles from dry regions. The next air quality directive will likely extend this principle to natural (i. e. Non anthropogenic) sources of pollution generally so long as the “natural contribution” can be quantified and documented. Particle Matters (PM) emissions sources are sea-spray, soil moved by wind, biogenic aerosols, volcanic emissions, forest fires, and anthropogenic sources. The EU legislation give limits for mobile emission, there are many like the Euro X limitation for private cars (gasoline and diesel). To control the road transport emissions there is a common trend of modification of the engines technology, the reduction of traffic in big city centre, the use of Pb and S free fuel, the promotion of the use of renewable energy and the use of alternative fuel. A cure strategy is post combustion treatment. The aim of this PhD work is to present a new way to approach radiative tranfer on air when dust episodes occurs, and to start a study/work group able to inform, with quality and quantity data, on natural sources of air pollution, capable to discuss with other governative and regional organizations such as ARPAS (with monitoring in site stations or mobile devices), and POLARIS 's entrerprises, which main topic is dealing with Environmental Science and Air quality. It is globally achieved that dust is part of natural aerosols quantity in air, with dimension from 1 to 10 microns, and could affect both human health, for breath disease, and local climate system, or global as well. Dust could reach Mediterranean and South European countries because of the local meteorology, the source points are often in the Sahara desert. Using Satellites Spectroradiometry we could detect and visualise dust over land and oceans. We used three Modis combination bands into the multispectral data analysis toolkit HYDRA (HYperspectral data viewer for Development if Research Application) : a simple algorithm is showed with the help of HYDRA software, that help scientists to see dust easly without any other processed data.

40|$|The UK and the EC have {{recognized}} that the application of national and EC policies alone may not be cost effective in improving air quality in some areas, especially in traffic-congested urban centres and along major road transport corridors. Consequently both have introduced new strategic frameworksfor air quality management. This paper outlines and compares the UK National Air Quality Strategy (NAQS) and the EC approach, {{set out in the}} Air Quality Framework and <b>Daughter</b> <b>Directives.</b> Both frameworks shift responsibility for reviewing, assessing and managing air quality on to local authorities. The UK considers the NAQS will provide the principal means of carrying out its commitments under the new EC framework. Local authorities in the UK have begun the review and assessment phase of the NAQS. This paper examines the support that central government has had to provide to local authorities to ensure the NAQS will be effective. It offers insights into what other Member States are likely to face when implementing their interpretation of the EC air quality management framework. The paper highlights that many UK local authorities lacked even basic air quality management capabilities when the NAQS was being formulated. Consequently the UK Government has had to expand the national pollution monitoring networks (this was achieved primarily by affiliating the growing number of local authority funded sites), commission new detailed urban emissions inventories, and develop and validate a suite of air quality dispersion models. Training events in air quality assessment techniques have had to be offered and many detailed guidance notes issued to ensure an appropriate and consistent interpretation of the NAQS. Some government initiatives to support the implementation of the NAQS suffered delays which initially caused some unnecessary uncertainties and inconsistencies amongst local authorities conducting their review and assessment of air quality. This points to the importance of the Governmentensuring that the support for the management phase of the NAQS will be in place in time. This includes providing additional pollution-control powers and reformulating transport and planning policies in order to integrate air quality management more fully. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{management}} {{of water resources}} and waste water varies between the countries of the EU. For many years, {{a large part of the}} water in Europe has been contaminated by, among other things, insufficiently treated waste water and emissions from agriculture. The EU Water Framework Directive 2000 / 60 /EC and the Urban Waste Water Directive 91 / 271 /EEC are intended to harmonize fresh-water management and waste water management within the whole EU, aiming at safeguarding drinking water of good quality and a high quality of all water within the EU today and in the future. There are however some problems concerning the waste-water directive. One problem is the huge investment needed in Slovakia to fulfil the demands of the waste-water directive for waste-water management in larger communities (with more than 2000 inhabitants). Many waste-water treatment plants need to be upgraded or built, and in addition a large part of the households in eastern Slovakia are not yet connected to a municipal water-supply and waste-water collecting system (including waste-water treatment). Subsidies from the EU’s structural funds are needed for Slovakia to fulfil the requirements of the waste-water directive. Because this directive only applies to larger communities, smaller communities and private sewage are not affected by the directive and therefore, in general, not eligible for financial funding from EU. Financial funding, however, is needed for addressing inadequate sewage in small communities with poor socioeconomic and municipal financial resources. For water protection to be effective, it is important to take also private sewage emissions into consideration, even though they might appear insignificant. Point emissions from insufficient private sewage (private sewage systems with insufficient waste-water treatment or emission of untreated waste water), primarily in small, tightly clustered communities in Slovakia or for example in Sweden in areas where weekend houses are being converted into permanent dwellings, are potential sources of pollution that can cause health or/and environmental problems. Inadequate private sewage can thus reduce the quality of both surface and ground water and have a negative impact on aquatic ecosystems, which in turn makes it more difficult to reach the quality standards of the Water Framework <b>Directive</b> and its <b>daughter</b> <b>directives.</b> This applies to both Slovakia and Sweden. The private sewage solutions that are recommended today are often satisfactory but not without problems. To give an example, miniature waste water treatment plants are expensive to put in place, require technological knowledge on the part of the property owner and they also require a daily flow of waste water to function properly. Improper handling of the miniature water treatment plant may cause inefficient or no water treatment at all, in some cases the bacterial content of the waste water may increase instead of being reduced. To address the problem concerning private sewage it is important that (1) waste-water solutions are adapted to local circumstances and financial funding are given to economically week municipalities (2) the property owner (owner of the private sewage) regularly controls the quality of the out-going treated wastewater (if it is possible) and (3) that efficient inspections with injunctions (from authorities) are carried out to discover faulty private sewage. Unfortunately financial funding, in general, is not given to small municipalities and/or inappropriate private sewage and inspections, both in Slovakia and Sweden, are generally slow...|$|R
40|$|The Joint Research Centre (JRC) {{has carried}} out an Intercomparison Exercise (IE) for the {{determination}} of heavy metals in particulate matter (PM 10). The IE focussed on Lead (Pb), Arsenic (As), Nickel (Ni) and Cadmium (Cd), the heavy metals regulated by the 1 st and 4 th <b>Daughter</b> <b>Directives</b> for Air Pollution. Copper (Cu), Chromium (Cr) and Zinc (Zn), the elements included in the EMEP programme together with Aluminium (Al), Cobalt (Co), Iron (Fe), Manganese (Mn) and Vanadium (V) were also tested. Fourteen Laboratories, generally members of the Network of Air Quality Reference Laboratories (AQUILA), participated in the IE. The participants mainly used microwave digestion with nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide and Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) or Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (GF-AAS) for analysis as recommended in the reference method (EN 14902). However, a few participants used other methods: Energy Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence (EDXRF), Atomic Emission Spectrometry (ICP-AES) and Voltammetry for analysis and vaporisation on hot plate before microwave digestion, Soxhlet extraction, high pressure or cold Hydrogen Fluoride methods for digestion. Each participant received 5 samples to be analysed: a liquid sample prepared by dilution of a Certified Reference Material (CRM), a solution of a dust CRM sample digested by the JRC 13 F, a sub-sample of a dust CRM that each participating laboratory had to digest and analyse, a solution prepared by JRC after digestion of an exposed filter {{and a pair of}} filters (one blank filter and one exposed filter) to be digested and analysed by each participant. For 89 % of all types of samples, the DQOs of the 1 st and 4 th European Directives (uncertainty of 25 % for Pb and 40 % for As, Cd and Ni) were met. All together, {{this is a very good}} score. The best results were obtained for the liquid CRM, dust CRM digested by JRC, dust CRM and filter digested by JRC with 92, 90, 96 and 93 % of DQOs being met, respectively. It was found that the DQOs were not met if the difference of acidity between test samples and participant calibration standards was high. Conversely, only 76 % of DQOs were met for the filter to be digested by each participant with (about 85 % for Cd and Ni, 73 / 64 % for Pb and As, the most difficult element to determine). The worst results were associated with special events: explosion in microwave oven during digestion for two participants, a wrong dilution factor used by one participant and a huge contamination in the blank filter for another participant. Among the two explosions, one of them was probably the effect of a lack of temperature control in the digestion vessel. For the other explosion, the microwave digestion and the digestion program advised by EN 14902 is to be questioned. Moreover, satisfactory results were obtained using Soxhlet extraction, high pressure method and cold Hydrogen Fluoride digestion methods which are not presented in EN 14902. The DQOs of As and Cd could not be met with EDXRF whose limit of detection was too high for these two elements and for Cd using Voltammetry which suffered a strong interference for this element. Regarding the methods of analysis, apart the points mentioned just before about EDXRF and Voltammetry, good results were observed using ICP-OES for Cd, Ni and Pb. A few discrepancies were also registered for GF-AAS and ICP-MS but they were created by the special events or acidity problem mentioned before. This shows that even though GF-AAS and ICP-MS are found suitable, the implementation by each participant may be responsible for important mistakes. JRC. H. 4 -Transport and air qualit...|$|R
