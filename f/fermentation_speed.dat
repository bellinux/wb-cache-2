40|$|Methane {{production}} rate (MPR) in {{waste activated sludge}} (WAS) digestion processes is typically limited by the initial steps of complex organic matter degradation, leading to a limited MPR due to sludge <b>fermentation</b> <b>speed</b> of solid particles. In this study, a novel microbial electrolysis AD reactor (ME-AD) was used to accelerate methane production for energy recovery from WAS. Carbon bioconversion was accelerated by ME producing H- 2 at the cathode. MPR was enhanced to 91. 8 gCH(4) /m(3) reactor/d in the microbial electrolysis ME-AD reactor, thus improving the rate by 3 times compared to control conditions (30. 6 gCH(4) /m(3) reactor/d in AD). The methane production yield reached 116. 2 mg/g VSS in the ME-AD reactor. According to balance calculation on electron transfer and methane yield, the increased methane production was mostly dependent on electron contribution through the ME system. Thus, {{the use of the}} novel ME-AD reactor allowed to significantly enhance carbon degradation and methane production from WAS. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

Using Rotary Discs Reactor (RDR) is one of the alternatives to produce higher yield of microbial cellulose. This study has been done to compare production of microbial cellulose using RDR with the traditional static fermentation method. A series of fermentation in static culture and RDR were run at room temperature with pH ranging from 4 to 6. Results showed that fermentation carried out using RDR gave 86. 78 % higher production of microbial cellulose than that from static fermentation. In this study, RDR <b>fermentation</b> with <b>speed</b> rotation of 7 rpm gave the highest resultant wet weight which was 139. 78 grams.

Este trabalho objetivou produzir colorantes naturais de Penicillium purpurogenum DPUA 1275 por cultivo submerso (em frascos agitados e em biorreator) e estudar a extração dos colorantes vermelhos. Para a produção, os estudos iniciais mostraram que 5 discos de micélio, sacarose e extrato de levedura como fontes de carbono e nitrogênio, respectivamente, e 336 horas de cultivo eram condições adequadas para a produção dos colorantes. Visando à otimização da produção, realizaram-se planejamentos fatoriais, com as variáveis independentes: tempo de cultivo; velocidade de agitação; pH; temperatura; concentração de sacarose e de extrato de levedura. As variáveis-respostas foram produção de colorantes amarelos, laranjas e vermelhos. Dos resultados obtidos, as variáveis mais significativas ao processo foram concentrações de extrato de levedura e de sacarose. A produção dos colorantes vermelhos foi otimizada, alcançando a produção de 2, 97 UA 490 nm, nas condições 48, 90 e 11, 80 g/L de sacarose e extrato de levedura, respectivamente, 30 °C, pH 4, 5 150 rpm e 336 horas de cultivo. Nos experimentos em biorreator, o melhor resultado foi obtido na frequência de agitação de 500 rpm e na mudança do pH do meio para 8, 0, após 96 horas de bioprocesso. Ademais, avaliou-se a estabilidade dos colorantes vermelhos presentes no meio fermentado em diferentes condições (pH, temperatura, sais, polímeros e tensoativos). Referente a pH e temperatura, os colorantes vermelhos mostraram-se mais estáveis nas condições alcalinas e a 70 °C. Tanto os sais (NaCl e Na 2 SO 4) quanto os polímeros (PEG 1. 000, 6. 000 e 10. 000 g/mol e NaPA 8. 000 g/mol a 5 e 15 %) e os tensoativos (Tween 20, CTAB e SDS) não causaram perda da cor nas condições avaliadas. Estudos de solubilidade e de coeficiente de partição octanol-água mostraram que os colorantes vermelhos apresentam solubilidade superior em solventes polares e característica mais hidrofílica. Nos estudos de extração, as técnicas avaliadas foram Sistemas Poliméricos de Duas Fases Aquosas (SPDFA) formados pelo sistema PEG/NaPA e Colloidal Gas Aphrons (CGA). Pela primeira técnica, os colorantes vermelhos migraram preferencialmente para a fase PEG. Os polímeros PEG 6. 000 g/mol, na presença de NaCl 0, 1 e 0, 5 M, e PEG 10. 000 g/mol, com Na 2 SO 4 0, 5 M, se destacaram dentre as condições analisadas com coeficiente de partição (K) próximo a 13, em ambos os casos, e seletividade de proteínas (SeP) próximas a 3.

There is worldwide {{interest in}} developing research projects involving the production and extraction of natural colorants due to serious safety problems associated with industrial use of synthetic ones. The aim of this work {{was to investigate the}} production of natural colorants from Penicillium purpurogenum DPUA 1275 by submerged culture (rotatory shaker and bioreactor) besides studying the red colorants extraction. To the production step, initial studies showed that 5 agar mycelial discs, sucrose and yeast extract as carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively, and 336 hours of bioprocess promoted the best results. To optimize the colorants production a serie of factorial designs were performed. The independent variables studied were: <b>fermentation</b> time, agitation <b>speed,</b> pH, temperature, sucrose and yeast extract concentration under the responses production of yellow, orange and red colorants. From these results, the most significant variables for the process were sucrose and yeast extract concentration. The red colorants production was optimized achieving 2. 97 UA 490 nm, in the following conditions: 48. 90 and 11. 80 g/L of sucrose and yeast extract, respectively, 30 °C, 4. 5 pH, 150 rev min- 1 and 336 hours of culture. In the experiments performed in bioreactor, the condition that promoted the best results was 500 rpm and pH adjusted for 8. 0 after 96 hours of bioprocess. Furthermore, we evaluated the red colorants stability at different conditions (pH, temperature, salts, polymers and surfactants). Concerning to pH and temperature, the red colorants were more stable under basic conditions and 70 °C; not only the salts (NaCl and Na 2 SO 4) but also the polymers (PEG 1000, 6000 and 10000 g/mol and NaPA 8000 g/mol) and the surfactants (Tween 20, CTAB and SDS) not promoted loss of color upon the conditions evaluated. Studies of red colorants solubility and octanol water coefficient showed that these compounds exhibit a higher solubility in polar solvents and present hydrophilic characteristics. Subsequently, the extraction of red colorant was evaluated through two extraction methods: Polymeric Systems Aqueous Two Phase (ATPS) composed by PEG and NaPA and Colloidal Gas Aphrons (CGA). For the first technique, the red colorant preferentially migrated to the PEG phase. The best results were obtained with PEG 6000 g/mol in the presence of 0. 1 to 0. 5 M NaCl and with PEG 10000 g/mol with 0. 5 M Na 2 SO 4. To both cases the partition coefficient (K) was close to 13 and the Selectivity in terms of proteins (SeP) was close to 3. For the CGA technique, CTAB gave the best results followed by Tween 20. However, the K values were lower than the ones obtained with ATPS with a maximum of 5 in the following condition: CTAB 2 mM/pH 9. 0. For the SeP, the values obtained for both techniques were close. The results above show a new producer of natural colorants which have potential application in various industries. Moreover, the results show the efficiency of the techniques used to extract the red colorants, especially to ATPS that presented higher K values...|$|R
