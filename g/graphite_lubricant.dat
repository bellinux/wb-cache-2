A solid lubricant traction model was incorporated into an advanced bearing analysis code (SHABERTH). For comparison purposes, preliminary heat generation calculations were made for both oil and solid lubricated bearing operation.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{incorporating}} microscopic reservoirs within a hard coating {{for the purpose}} of solid lubricant storage and supply during wear of interacting surfaces has been investigated in this study. A novel method was devised using ceramic beads (1. 5 - 10 mu m diameter) as placeholders during the deposition of a TiN coating by reactive sputter deposition. A pin-on-disk wear test was used to test these coatings using graphite and sputter-deposited carbon as the solid lubricant, and an alumina counterface. When tested without any lubricant, the presence of the microreservoirs in the TiN coating appeared to degrade the mechanical integrity of the coating leading to rapid failure. With the <b>graphite</b> <b>lubricant</b> present, the frictional behavior ranged from levels similar to the TiN coating alone, to that of graphite alone. Tests of the TiN coating made using 10 mu m beads running against an aluminum counterface showed substantial improvement when the microreservoirs were present.

With a sufficient density and appropriate distribution of the microreservoirs significant improvements in tribological performance can be realized. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Forging of {{components}} for gas turbine application from nickel-based superalloys remains a challenge, {{due to the}} exceptional high temperature properties of these alloys. In order to enhance formability and prevent oxidation at high temperature forging, a glass coating is applied to protect the alloy. However, the contribution and significance of glass coating to the material flow during forging is not fully understood. In addition, increased competitive pressure requires {{a better understanding of}} the root cause for geometrical part variability in the forging of aerospace components. Particularly, reduction of manual rework is highly desirable, as it increases the manufacturing costs of these components significantly. The aim of this work was to identify the Key Process Variables (KPVs) of the forging of aerofoils. Therefore, numerical modelling of a full factorial design of experiment was conducted to study the significance of various process parameters. The contribution of glass coating as a process variable has been studied experimentally. The double cup extrusion test has been employed to study the influence of glass coating thickness and chemistry in hot forging condition. Ring compression tests have been conducted to investigate the contribution of <b>graphite</b> <b>lubricant.</b> It was found, that in the presence of <b>graphite</b> <b>lubricant</b> friction reduces markedly. However, in order to establish a stable lubrication system the fusion behaviour of glass coating becomes crucial. In the absence of <b>graphite</b> <b>lubricant,</b> friction increases with increased glass coating thickness. Numerical modelling revealed that the interfacial heat transfer coefficient increases with a reduction of glass coating thickness. A good agreement between experimentally and numerically derived interfacial heat transfer coefficient has been found. In contrast, in a rapid deformation process such as blade forging, the effect of heat loss becomes less important compared to the contribution of friction. The initial variability of glass coating thickness has been characterised in the industrial forging of Inconel 718 aerofoils. Glass coating thickness varies considerably across the workpiece and the batch. This variability, alongside the variability of manual process parameters such as transfer and resting time, have a notable effect on the forming temperature and thus on the resulting aerofoil geometry...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} the lubrication conditions in hot forging of aluminium. The most common lubricants to apply in hot forging of aluminium are oil-based and water-based, both containing graphite. Oil-based graphite lubricants give certain {{health and safety}} challenges and are not environmental-friendly. Water-based graphite lubricants tend to not give optimal lubrication at high temperatures. Therefore alternative lubricants were discussed and tested in this thesis. The possibility of coating the tools was also investigated as this process can improve the mechanical properties of the tools. A literature study and the commercial availability of the coatings and lubricants were used to select which coatings and lubricants to test. The combination of recommended lubricants and coatings were tested in a TE 88 multi-station friction and wear test machine, with a reciprocating pin on plate configuration. The pin represented the forging tool and was made of steel. The plate was made of aluminium and represented the workpiece. The coatings that were selected to test were an aluminium chromium nitride coating, and an aluminium titanium nitride coating, which were applied to the pins. Uncoated pins were also tested to represent the tool steel Raufoss Technology uses today. Some pins were polished without applying a coating. Two new types of lubricant were tested, {{in addition to the}} current water-based <b>graphite</b> <b>lubricant,</b> Lubrodal F 33 Al, used by Raufoss Technology today. The new types of lubricants were produced by Klüber lubrication. Wolfraco WF 51 W is a water-based graphite free lubricant, and Klüberplus S 08 - 107 is a solid <b>graphite</b> <b>lubricant.</b> The friction coefficient was lower at the tests with the coated and polished pins compared to the untreated pins. There {{was no significant difference between}} the performances of the surface treatments, the surface roughness had a much larger impact. No aluminium transfer was found at any of tests when the lubricant worked well. The lowest friction coefficient was with an AlTiN coated pin tested together with Lubrodal F 33 Al. There was some trouble with the water-based lubricants not sticking to the hot surface at temperatures above 200 C. Klüberplus S 08 - 107, which is a solid lubricant, worked well also at 300 C. The tests done with Klüberplus S 08 - 107 had the highest coefficient of friction but it was significantly reduced after the pin was coated. Klüberplus S 08 - 107 is applied to the workpiece before it enters the forging press, so the forging time will be reduced. This enables the machine to produce more parts, and the costs per part will be reduced. Klüberplus S 08 - 107 combined with coating or polishing of the tools was recommended as the best combination for further testing...|$|E

In the present paper the WHUST (Warm and Hot Upsetting Sliding Test) dedicated to the tribology of metal forming processes at high temperature is presented. The friction test is able to operate according to a large range of plastic strains, contact pressures and temperatures. The methodology to use the friction test to respect contact conditions encountered at the tool/workpiece interface of various industrial forming processes is discussed. Then three designs of experiments are achieved. The first set of experiments is performed to {{study the effects of}} the composition of graphite based lubricants on friction of hot forging tool. A particular attention is paid on the volume of lubricant used, the size of graphite particles and the amount of binding agents. The second set of experiments is performed to quantify the ability of two white lubricants to reduce friction and protect tool surface. The first lubricant is a mineral salt; the second one is an organic salt. Tests are performed at 1200 °C on AISI 4820 steel specimens, with AISI H 11 nitrided steel contactors. Results show the tested white lubricants lead to coefficient {{of friction}} in the same range of the <b>graphite</b> <b>lubricant</b> one, but white lubricants lose their ability to reduce friction as soon as the sliding lengths becomes greater to 10 mm, where graphite lubricants can undergo sliding length greater than 30 mm.

This knowledge of the dependence of surface characteristics on process conditions and alloy composition is of special interest since {{it can be used}} to assist construction of emissivity compensation algorithms, which provide accurate and reliable non-contact (radiometric) temperature measurements during manufacturing. ^ Angle Resolved XPS (ARXPS) was used for surface analysis of freshly-processed Al-alloys. For full quantitative ARXPS data analysis we have improved an existing model in the literature to account for the changes of the emission angle of photoelectrons (take-off angle) across the surface associated with roughness geometry. This model, based on an assumption of a sinusoidal surface roughness predicts with accuracy the oxide layer thickness and gives a very good fit to the angular dependent XPS intensity ratios. Oxide layer thicknesses of 40 - 70 A are typical of freshly processed surfaces of a variety of alloys. ^ A combination of Ar+ sputtering with XPS was used to measure the concentration depth profiles of the thick oxide layers formed after long heating times. At heating temperatures higher than 670 K, XPS results showed a non-uniformly thick, top Mg-oxide layer overlying a mixed-phase Mg-Al-oxide layer, which is very rich in MgO and contains Al inclusions. The 6061 forged alloy, however, does not form a thick top Mg-oxide layer while its oxidation is strongly influenced by the presence of the <b>graphite</b> <b>lubricant</b> and the forging process itself. Relatively thin, mixed-phase Mg-Al-oxide layers which are free from Al inclusions are formed even after heating the alloys for long times at temperatures below 670 K.

For comparison, similar experiments on PI-bonded MoS 2 and burnished films of MoS 2 or (CF sub 1. 1) sub n were conducted. The best results were obtained with the PI-bonded (CF sub 1. 1) sub n films. The polyimide thin films (with no solid lubricant additives) did not lubricate well at 25 C; however, when heated to 100 C, low {{friction and}} long wear lives were obtained...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Solid phase {{method was}} adopted {{to prepare the}} <b>graphite</b> {{fluoride}} solid <b>lubricant.</b> The friction and wear properties of graphite fluoride were tested with MMW- 1 vertical universal friction and wear testing machine. The phase of graphite fluoride was analyzed with infrared spectrometer. The morphology of friction surface was analyzed with the scanning electron microscope. The results show that graphite fluoride has an excellent antifriction wear-resisting property, to compare with molybdenum sulfide, the anti-friction property increased by 35 %, wear resistance increased by 49 %. The main wear mechanism of the test specimens are fatigue wear and adhesive wear. The solid lubrication film for graphite fluoride was formed in the friction surface...|$|R
40|$|Research of regularities in {{formation}} of the structure and complex properties of new composite antifriction materials based on copper for use in high-speed friction units has been carried out. The presence of calcium fluoride or <b>graphite</b> (as solid <b>lubricants)</b> in materials provides the transfer of solid lubricant on the counterpart working surface. This {{is evidenced by the}} formation of antifriction dividing films (so called secondary structures). These facts can ensure the stable operation of friction units at a sudden termination of the oil supply or other emergencies. The new bearing materials for tribological characteristics are superior to cast counterparts and can operate in self-lubrication conditions at high sliding speeds and high loads. The research results allow us to recommend powder materials ?? 5 ?? 9 and ??? 10 for the manufacture of plain bearings and use such parts in rotating equipment as an alternative to Babbitt alloys. ????????? ???????????? ??????????????? ???????????? ????????? ? ????????? ??????? ????? ?????????????? ??????????????? ?????????? ?? ?????? ???? ??? ?????? ? ???????????????? ????? ??????. ????? ????????????? ????????? ?? ???????????????? ??????????????? ??????????? ????? ??????? ? ????? ???????? ? ?????? ?????????????? ??? ??????? ????????? ?????????? ? ?????????? ?????????...|$|R
