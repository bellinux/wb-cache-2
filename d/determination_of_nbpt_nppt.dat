However, the decreasing degree of the net nitrification rate varied with soil pH (Table  1), indicating that NBPT could inhibit the hydrolysis of urea and the inhibition efficiency was affected by soil pH. Hendrickson and Douglass (1993) revealed that pH was a key factor for NBPT to control the urea hydrolysis and both NBPT and BNPO (an oxon analog <b>of</b> <b>NBPT)</b> could inhibit the hydrolysis of urea more effectively in neutral soils than in acidic soils. However, Beyrouty et al. (1988) found that the effect <b>of</b> <b>NBPT</b> was rarely influenced by soil pH and NBPT {{could be applied to}} both acidic and neutral soils. Our results indicated that NBPT was a much more effective urease inhibitor at pH 3.97 than at other pHs. Therefore, the inhibition efficiency <b>of</b> <b>NBPT</b> might be also influenced by other environmental factors. Further study is essential to definite the transformation <b>of</b> <b>NBPT</b> under different environmental conditions. NBPT exhibited no significant effects on the abundance and community structure of ammonia oxidizers. The effects <b>of</b> <b>NBPT</b> on bacteria, fungi and actinomycetes have been well studied. For example, Zhao et al. (2007) found that high concentrations <b>of</b> <b>NBPT</b> could inhibit the growths of bacteria and actinomycete. Song and Sun (2006) reported that NBPT could promote the growth of soil bacteria, actinomycetes and fungi. However, NBPT has shown no effects on growth of ammonia oxidizers, consistent with our results.|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{widespread}} use of urease inhibitors in agriculture, little information is available on their effect on nitrogen (N) uptake and assimilation. Aim of this work was to study, at physiological and transcriptional level, the effects of N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT) on urea nutrition in hydroponically grown maize plants. Presence <b>of</b> <b>NBPT</b> in the nutrient solution limited the capacity of plants to utilize urea as a N-source; this was shown by a decrease in urea uptake rate and 15 N accumulation. Noteworthy, these negative effects were evident only when plants were fed with urea, as NBPT did not alter 15 N accumulation in nitrate-fed plants. NBPT also impaired the growth of Arabidopsis plants when urea was used as N-source, while having no effect on plants grown with nitrate or ammonium. This response was related, at least in part, to a direct effect <b>of</b> <b>NBPT</b> on the high affinity urea transport system. Impact <b>of</b> <b>NBPT</b> on urea uptake was further evaluated using lines of Arabidopsis overexpressing ZmDUR 3 and dur 3 -knockout; results suggest that not only transport but also urea assimilation could be compromised by the inhibitor. This hypothesis was reinforced by an over-accumulation of urea and a decrease in ammonium concentration in NBPT-treated plants. Furthermore, transcriptional analyses showed that in maize roots NBPT treatment severely impaired the expression of genes involved in the cytosolic pathway of ureic-N assimilation and ammonium transport. NBPT also limited the expression of a gene coding for a transcription factor highly induced by urea and possibly playing {{a crucial role in the}} regulation of its acquisition. This work provides evidence that NBPT can heavily interfere with urea nutrition in maize plants, limiting influx as well as the following assimilation pathway. © 2015 Zanin, Tomasi, Zamboni, Varanini and Pinton...|$|R
40|$|International audienceN-Butyl-phosphorotriamide (NBPT) is a {{fertilizer}} {{widely used}} for its urease inhibiting properties.

In this context, and in order to simplify formulations of this bioactive compound, a panel of natural polysaccharides was studied, including starch, β-(1, 3) -glucans, carraghenans and alginates.

40|$|To limit {{nitrogen}} (N) {{losses from}} the soil, {{it has been}} suggested to provide urea to crops in conjunction with the urease inhibitor N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT). However, recent studies reported that NBPT affects urea uptake and urease activity in plants. To shed light on these latter aspects, the effects <b>of</b> <b>NBPT</b> were studied analysing transcriptomic and metabolic changes occurring in urea-fed maize seedlings after a short-term exposure to the inhibitor. We provide evidence that NBPT treatment led to a wide reprogramming <b>of</b> plant metabolism. <b>NBPT</b> inhibited the activity of endogenous urease limiting the release and assimilation of ureic-ammonium, with a simultaneous accumulation of urea in plant tissues. Furthermore, NBPT determined changes in the glutamine, glutamate, and asparagine contents. Microarray data indicate that NBPT affects ureic-N assimilation and primary metabolism, such as glycolysis, TCA cycle, and electron transport chain, while activates the phenylalanine/tyrosine-derivative pathway. Moreover, the expression of genes relating to the transport and complexation of divalent metals was strongly modulated by NBPT. Data here presented suggest that when NBPT is provided in conjunction with urea an imbalance between C and N compounds might occur in plant cells. Under this condition, root cells also seem to activate a response to maintain the homeostasis of some micronutrients...|$|R

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of adding different concentrations of the urease inhibitor N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT) and aluminium chloride (AlCl 3), alone or combined with the nitriﬁcation inhibitor 3, 4 -dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP), on gaseous N losses and N transformations in soil amended with cattle-urine. Using laboratory incubations soil was amended with cattle-urine (200 kg total N ha! 1) containing NBPT (0. 1 or 1. 0 %) or AlCl 3 (0. 5 or 1. 0 %) either as a single additive or combined with 0. 5 % DMPP. Three additional treatments were included: soil only (Control), soil amended only with cattle-urine and soil amended with cattle-urine and DMPP. The addition <b>of</b> <b>NBPT</b> at 1 % signiﬁcantly delayed urea hydrolysis during the ﬁrst 4 - d after urine application comparatively to treatments receiving AlCl 3. Nitriﬁcation was inhibited by addition of DMPP, with no further effect (P > 0. 05) when DMPP was combined with NBPT or AlCl 3. The AlCl 3 treatment had no effect on urea hydrolysis or nitriﬁcation. The combination <b>of</b> DMPP with <b>NBPT</b> or AlCl 3 increased (P < 0. 05) NH 3 emissions and reduced (P < 0. 05) NO and N 2 O emissions compared with urine alone.
