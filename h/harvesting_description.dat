30|$|In recent decades, many {{researchers}} have found that the occurrence of some biological phenomena and the optimal control of some life phenomena were not continuous processes, but the transient behavior of an impulse, so we should use impulsive differential equations to describe these phenomena. The theory of impulsive differential equations is proposed on the basis of continuous differential equation theory, which is difficult but valuable. It is widely applied in the <b>harvest</b> <b>description</b> [13 – 16], ecological resources [17 – 26], pest control [27 – 31] and epidemiologic control [32 – 36]. Many scholars investigated state-dependent pulse differential equations in predator–prey model to simulate the pest management including the periodic release of natural enemies [37 – 39] and the periodic release of natural enemies combined with periodic spraying of pesticides [40 – 46]. On the other hand, the bifurcation theory has been widely applied in the continuous dynamic system [47 – 49]. However, its application in impulsive dynamical system was little.|$|R
40|$|The {{recreational}} fishery in Australia {{is an important}} part of the country's economy and culture. However, broad spatial and temporal monitoring schemes that are currently used to estimate effort and catch of the recreational fishing sector are insufficient for sustainable management. Often species-specific information is unavailable due to identification problems, as well as area and time specific fisheries (pulse fisheries) which are not identified. This dissertation aims to evaluate current monitoring and management schemes for the fishing industry by (1) developing a profile of a community experiencing seasonal fluctuations in fishing effort, (2) identifying the harvest and life history characteristics of a primary target species, the barred javelin (Pomadasys kaakan) as they apply to the commercial and recreational fishing sectors, and (3) use this information in a Biological Reference Point model to predict the productivity of P. kaakan and assess the effectiveness of recent management changes. Currently, communities which experience fluctuations in fishing effort due to the seasonal movements of anglers are unrecorded. Lucinda, a community in northeast Queensland, experiences fluctuations of tourist visitation which coincides with changes in fishing catch and effort within the local region. The demographic characteristics and motivations of the tourists visiting Lucinda, as well as a <b>harvest</b> <b>description</b> of the recreational sector, are described in this dissertation. This will demonstrate the importance of identifying communities affected by fishing pressures and the possible impact anglers are having on coastal ecosystems. A biological description of catch characteristics for the commercial and recreational sector is also required for key species. Updated life history characteristics, including growth parameters and reproductive behaviours, are necessary for use in management plans which keep the collective industry sustainable. For this dissertation, key life history characteristics were defined for Pomadasys kaakan. These data were used in the Spawning Potential Ratio model, with catch characteristics for each sector, to evaluate historical and current minimum size limit laws, as well as the gear selectivity influences of both fishing sectors. Demographic and motivational profile data was collected using on-site, access point surveys at the main boat ramp in Lucinda and face-to-face surveys of tourists in the local caravan park – Wanderer's Holiday Village. This data were also used to create a <b>harvest</b> <b>description</b> for recreational anglers in Lucinda. Biological samples of P. kaakan were collected from fishery dependent sources, including recreational and commercial fishers. These samples were used to define age and growth parameters, as well as reproductive characteristics. A definable, seasonal {{recreational fishery}} was identified in Lucinda with a 500...|$|R

Registries that contain high-level descriptions of resources such as archives and services are essential for making data discovery efficient in a distributed environment. We review a framework architecture for VO registries currently under development within a International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA) working group. We present an overview of a prototype implementation of the framework developed {{as part of the}} National Virtual Observatory (NVO) project. We illustrate how in-stitutions can publish descriptions of their resources within their own registries. Other registries specialize in <b>harvesting</b> these <b>descriptions</b> to centralized locations where users may search them. We show how our prototype registry supports the NVO’s first publicly released service, a Data Inventory Service. 1. A Common, Global Approach to Resource Discovery Registries are an important linchpin for the Virtual Observatory (VO) : they provide the mechanism for discovering the resources available to applications. By resources, we primarily mean data and services, but we can view other thing...|$|R

There are two options for harvesting, continuous and discrete harvesting. In case of continuous harvesting we have two ways how to harvest,with constant yield and constant effort. With simplifying assumptions {{it is possible to}} combine continuous and discrete model in the form of profit function for the harvesting and also gives us ability to implement harvesting costs. For profit-seeking function is best solved using numerical methods with model examples with help of the Maple solver. The last chapter is devoted to the introduction of interest to the harvesting models...|$|R

In this paper we outline the WEAVE ® system which automates the structuring and collating of unstructured data from multiple on-line Websites. WEAVE ® {{is presented in the}} context of the maintenance, repair, and operations supply chain. The underlying knowledge representation for WEAVE ® is an MRO product ontology. This ontology drives classification of product <b>descriptions</b> <b>harvested</b> from Websites and attribute value extraction from the descriptions. The system uses logic programming to manage the ontology driven classification and extraction and the Java 2 Enterprise Edition platform and Open Business Engine workflow engine to continuously harvest and collate data from multiple MRO catalog Websites. It uses this coherent view of MRO data to allow a user to quickly locate and compare MRO products...|$|R

Given a video shot from a tennis match, we intend to generate a textual commentary similar to what a human expert would write on a sports website. Unlike many recent works that focus on generating short captions, {{we are interested in}} generating semanti-cally richer descriptions. This demands a detailed low-level analysis of the video content, specially the actions and interactions among subjects. We address this by limiting our domain to the game of lawn tennis. Rich descriptions are generated by leveraging a large corpus of human created <b>descriptions</b> <b>harvested</b> from Internet. We evaluate our method on a newly created tennis video data set. Extensive analysis demonstrate that our ap-proach addresses both semantic correctness as well as readability aspects involved in the task. ...|$|R
