5|$|Collins and his {{partners}} brought in slaves from Africa to dig a canal from Lake Phelps to the Scuppernong River. The canal served two purposes: first, {{as a means of}} transporting goods and people to and from the plantation; and second, it served as a massive <b>drainage</b> <b>ditch</b> as the slaves of Somerset Place worked to drain the surrounding swamps. Later, the canal system was expanded to provide irrigation for the rice and corn fields of the plantation.|$|E
5|$|The Royalists {{occupied}} the low-lying moor, behind a <b>drainage</b> <b>ditch</b> that Rupert noted {{as an effective}} obstacle to a cavalry charge. There is some dispute {{over the course of}} the ditch at the time of the battle. Some contemporary accounts support the contention by later historians that it was non-existent on the Royalists' right wing. On the other hand, a near-contemporary plan of the Royalist dispositions by Rupert's chief engineer, Bernard de Gomme, shows the ditch in its present-day alignment. It is generally accepted that the ditch was at least less of an obstacle on the Royalist right.|$|E

40|$|The {{combination}} of runoff-generating areas (saturated soils) and overland flow concentration in {{features such as}} <b>drainage</b> <b>ditches</b> makes sloping farmland vulnerable to soil erosion. The establishment of <b>drainage</b> <b>ditches</b> aims at draining the excess {{of water from the}} farmland, particularly in areas where soils are saturated in the rainy season. The hydrogeomorphic impacts on the farmland itself and on downstream areas need however also to be studied. Off site, downstream problems comprise higher peak discharges, leading to gully initiation, an increase in sediment load, and flooding problems. On-site problems such as the development of the <b>drainage</b> <b>ditches</b> into (ephemeral) gullies are less documented, although they may be important, as illustrated in the Lake Tana Basin (Ethiopia). The similarities and interactions between ephemeral gully channels and <b>drainage</b> <b>ditches</b> have to be considered to better understand all effects of <b>drainage.</b> <b>Drainage</b> <b>ditches</b> are a potential source of conflict between farmers with different interests and power, as well as between upstream and downstream users.

5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 19th century the Glastonbury Canal {{drainage}} problems and competition from the new railways caused a decline in trade, and the town's economy became depressed. The canal was closed on 1 July 1854, and the lock and aqueducts on the upper section were dismantled. The railway opened on 17 August 1854. The lower sections of the canal were given to the Commissioners for Sewers, for use as a <b>drainage</b> <b>ditch.</b> The final section was retained to provide a wharf for the railway company, which was used until 1936, when it passed to the Commissioners of Sewers and was filled in.

5|$|In Clear Lake City, heavy {{rainfall}} collapsed {{a portion of}} a grocery store roof, killing two workers. The precipitation caused moderate flooding across eastern portions of Harris County; over 400homes and 40businesses were flooded. Flooding across the Greater Houston area briefly halted the METRORail and closed several state roads. One person drowned after driving into a retention pond. Several people required rescue assistance, and in Comal County a car accident caused three fatalities. The passage of the storm temporarily left about 20,000electrical customers without power, though most outages were quickly restored. In San Antonio, one body was recovered from a creek and another died after driving into a flooded road and was swept into a <b>drainage</b> <b>ditch</b> in which four others survived. In Sisterdale, two people were killed when they were swept away stalled over Sister Creek. In Taylor County, near Abilene, flooding killed one person and forced the evacuation of about 2,000people.

5|$|September 15, 1999– Hurricane Floyd {{parallels}} {{the shore of}} the Delmarva Peninsula as a tropical storm. Chestertown, reports a maximum rainfall total of 14inches (350mm), with other locales reporting similar values. Extreme river flooding causes moderate damage to bridges and roads, resulting in a damage toll of $7.9million (1999USD, $10million 2008USD) throughout the state. In addition, over 250,000 residents are without electricity because of high winds blowing down power lines. More than 28people are forced to be rescued by boat as a result of severe flooding. Nine other people were from an apartment building near Great Mills. Two people are injured and one person is killed by carbon monoxide after losing power and running a generator inside their home. Also, a 12‑year-old boy is caught in flood waters and is swept a half mile (800m) down a <b>drainage</b> <b>ditch</b> before being rescued and treated for hypothermia.|$|E

40|$|<b>Drainage</b> <b>ditches</b> {{are widely}} used for {{agricultural}} water management to help remove excess water from fields, which mitigates the effects of water logging and salinization. These ditches act as a direct hydraulic link between the agricultural field and streams and rivers. As such, there is an increasing concern that <b>drainage</b> <b>ditches</b> can act as conduits for nutrient transport and, {{in conjunction with other}} point and nonpoint sources, can contribute to eutrophication and decreased dissolved oxygen levels in receiving water bodies. Studies have linked <b>drainage</b> <b>ditches</b> to hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico and eutrophication of the Great Lakes (Dagg and Breed, 2003; Moore et al., 2010). However, there is also evidence suggesting that <b>drainage</b> <b>ditches</b> can help attenuate the loadings of phosphorus and suspended sediments (R. Kr?ger et al., 2008) and thus foster water quality improvements at a watershed scale. There is a growing interest in understanding the nutrient behavior in <b>drainage</b> <b>ditches</b> both in the United States (Bhattarai et al. 2009; Moore, et al. 2010; Ahiablame et al. 2011) as well as {{other parts of the world}} (Nguyen and Sukias 2002; Leone et al. 2008; Bonaiti and Borin 2010) ...|$|R

5|$|Most of the storm's {{effects were}} felt in Florida where it made {{landfall}} {{on the morning}} of June 18, causing gales, heavy rains, flooding, beach erosion and tornadoes. The highest winds were recorded at 41mph (66km/h) and up to 48mph (77km/h) during a thunderstorm at Macdill Air Force Base in Tampa on June 18. Rainfall peaked at 10.72inches (272.28mm) in Desoto City, while {{much of the rest of}} the state reported between 15inches (25125inches) of precipitation. High tides and waves caused flooding and beach erosion from Naples to the Tampa Bay area. Some waterfront buildings suffered damage from undermining including widespread damage of marinas and some boats. Several bulkheads and rock revetments experienced minor damage in Naples and Marco Island. Several man‑made dune structures seaward of the Coastal Construction Control Line in Collier County received minor damage at Vanderbilt Beach and Marco Island. Three people were killed in Florida in association with the subtropical storm with a further thirteen people injured. A Brevard County woman died when a canoe overturned and an Orange County child was killed when he was swept into a <b>drainage</b> <b>ditch.</b> 130 families were evacuated a few days after the storm from the Arcadia River area because the Peace River crested above flood stage.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of floristic studies conducted in the years 2003 - 2005 within the area of the Polesie National Park. The aim of the research was to compare the flora of initial succession stages in <b>drainage</b> <b>ditches</b> with the flora of neighbouring forest areas undergoing transformation as a result of drainage. Floristic lists were made in four designated study areas as well as in forest phytocoenoses.
