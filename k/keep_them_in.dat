5|$|The {{process of}} {{integrating}} is easiest with two rats of young age, generally {{less than six}} months old. The process of integrating is most difficult with two or more adult male rats, as adult males are the least likely to accept new cage mates, especially after an alpha has been established. Unless there is an issue integrating rats together, owners should always <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> a group of at least three, as rats live in packs and a pack starts with three animals.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Ruter {{decided to}} scrap {{all of the}} T2000 wagons, after only 16 years in operation, and ten of the wagons were sold for NOK100,000 a piece to the {{recycling}} company Hellik Teigen at Hokksund. The two remaining wagons will be preserved and displayed at the Oslo Tramway Museum. Ruter stated that it would cost about NOK50 million to <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> operation. Nevertheless, Ruter was in 2011 forced by the owner Oslo Vognselskap to keep renting the wagons for 22 million NOK each year, {{even though they were}} not in operation. Oslo Vognselskap stated the reason behind this was the contract which lasted for 30 years.|$|E

5|$|Insectivorous insects, or {{insects that}} feed on other insects, are {{beneficial}} to humans if they eat insects {{that could cause}} damage to agriculture and human structures. For example, aphids feed on crops and cause problems for farmers, but ladybugs feed on aphids, {{and can be used}} as a means to get significantly reduce pest aphid populations. While birds are perhaps more visible predators of insects, insects themselves account for the vast majority of insect consumption. Ants also help control animal populations by consuming small vertebrates. Without predators to <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> check, insects can undergo almost unstoppable population explosions.|$|E
5|$|Stanley's murals were {{discussed}} in the British Parliament in October 1968. Charles Morris, minister of parliament for Openshaw, asked the Defence Ministry, Denis Healy, to consider moving the murals to England. His proposal was unsuccessful when the Singapore Ministry of Defence decided to take responsibility of the murals and to <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> good condition for display in 1969. (Singapore gained independence from Britain in August 1965). In addition, a copy {{of one of the}} murals painted by Stanley had been brought to England and installed in the Garrison Church at Larkhill in Wiltshire.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Fr√©teval, {{which took}} place on 3 July 1194, was a medieval battle, part of the ongoing {{fighting}} between Richard the Lionheart and Philip II of France that lasted from 1194 to Richard's death in April 1199. During the battle, the English and Norman forces ambushed the French army, which was defeated. Philip managed to flee but lost his archives which were captured by Richard. After the battle, Philip decided to <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> Paris, {{which led to the}} creation of the French national library, the Archives Nationales.|$|E

5|$|Trollope leapt {{into the}} fray {{somewhat}} belatedly, {{in the pages of}} Saint Paul's in October 1869, with an article on the Formosa controversy that can be read as a defence of and an advertisement for The Vicar. He took exception to several of the arguments in The Times: young women of the 1860s, he wrote, were not unaware of the existence of prostitution; and attempting to <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> ignorance would not conduce to virtue. Rather than promoting vice, an accurate depiction of the squalid and miserable life of a woman of the streets would arm young people to resist temptation.|$|E
5|$|Breeders {{would choose}} {{potential}} exhibition ducks from among newly hatched ducklings in March and April, {{and they would}} be given a great deal of extra attention. They would be fed a carefully controlled diet to get them to the maximum weight, and would be allowed out for a few hours each day to <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> as good a physical condition as possible. Before the show, their legs and feet would be washed, their bills trimmed with a knife and sandpapered smooth, and their feathers brushed with linseed oil. While most breeders would give the ducks a healthy meal before the show to calm them, some breeders would force-feed the ducks with sausage or worms, to get them to as heavy a weight as possible. Exhibition standards judged an Aylesbury duck primarily on size, shape and colour. This encouraged the breeding of larger ducks, with pronounced exaggerated keels, and loose baggy skin. By the beginning of the 20thcentury the Aylesbury duck had diverged into two separate strains, one bred for appearance and one for meat.|$|E
5|$|Soviet {{equipment}} losses {{during the}} German offensive came to 1,614tanks and self-propelled guns destroyed or damaged of the 3,925 vehicles {{committed to the}} battle. The Soviet losses were roughly three {{times larger than the}} German losses. During Operation Kutuzov, 2,349tanks and self-propelled guns were lost out of an initial strength of 2,308; a loss of over 100percent. During Polkovodets Rumyantsev 1,864tanks and self-propelled guns were lost out of the 2,439 employed. The loss ratio suffered by the Soviets was roughly 5:1 in favour of the German military. However, large Soviet reserves of equipment and their high rate of tank production enabled the Soviet tank armies to soon replace lost equipment and maintain their fighting strength. The Red Army repaired many of its damaged tanks; many Soviet tanks were rebuilt up to four times to <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> the fight. Soviet tank strength went back up to 2,750 tanks by 3 August due to the repair of damaged vehicles.|$|E

5|$|Allen {{served as}} {{chairman}} from 1955 to 1961; under him were three other selectors, who varied throughout his period as chairman, and the serving England captain. Among Allen's priorities were to promote attacking batsmanship, good fielding, and for the team to bowl overs more quickly. While looking for new batting talent, Allen often promoted young amateur batsmen; several emerged in this period, including Ted Dexter and Colin Cowdrey, who had successful careers and {{were part of a}} strong English batting line-up. At least one member of the England team, Jim Laker, resented the preference of amateurs, whom he believed were paid more for playing than the professionals. Many professional cricketers thought that Allen was a snob who preferred to <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> their place; critics believed that he deliberately restricted the career of Les Jackson for reasons of class. Allen also played the role of disciplinarian. Several of the England players enjoyed a hectic social life; it was often left to Allen to issue warnings when they transgressed. He played an active role in home Test matches, generally attending at least three of the five days of every game, discussing tactics with the captain, and speaking to the press. In his first season, Allen was involved in the appointment of a new captain; Len Hutton, the serving captain, retired from the team with injury. In his place, the selectors appointed May, who served until 1959 and again in 1961; he and Allen established a good working relationship. When May was absent from the team with illness during parts of 1960 and 1961, Cowdrey replaced him.|$|E
