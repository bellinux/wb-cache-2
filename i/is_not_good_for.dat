5|$|Mervyn Cowie {{oversaw the}} {{development}} of several of Kenya's national parks and designed them with human visitors in mind. This emphasis helped to make tourism Kenya's primary industry. However, it exacerbated problems between the human population and wildlife. Farmers living next to the parks did not have input into {{the establishment of the}} parks. Locals received very little benefit from the game animals. Livestock is threatened by lions, and some landowners think that Kenya's wildlife <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> them. In 1948 188,976 people lived in Nairobi, and by 1997 the city's population had grown to 1.5 million. The park is under pressure from the city's growing population and need for farmland. People live right next to the park's boundaries, which creates human-animal conflicts. The human population also creates pollution and garbage. Effluent and industrial waste from factories located along the park's northern boundary contaminate the park's surface and ground water systems.|$|E

25|$|While the BLM rates horses by {{animal unit}} (AUM) {{to eat the}} same amount of forage as a cow-calf pair, 1.0, {{multiple}} studies of horse grazing patterns indicate that horses probably consume forage at a rate closer to 1.5 AUM. Modern rangeland management also recommends removing all livestock during the growing season to maximize recovery of the forage. Allowing livestock to graze year-round <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> the range, and so mismanagement of feral herds can also degrade the range for the wildlife that shares the same area.|$|E
25|$|After God created Adam, who was alone, He said, 'It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> {{man to be}} alone.' He then {{created a}} woman for Adam, from the earth, as He had created Adam himself, and called her Lilith. Adam and Lilith {{immediately}} began to fight. She said, 'I will not lie below,' and he said, 'I will not lie beneath you, but only on top. For you are fit only {{to be in the}} bottom position, while I am to be the superior one.' Lilith responded, 'We are equal to each other inasmuch as we were both created from the earth.' But they would not listen to one another. When Lilith saw this, she pronounced the Ineffable Name and flew away into the air.|$|E

The composition of [...] "Oh My Goodness" [...] is composed of an organ and horns, while the title track, [...] "Heart Skips a Beat" [...] and [...] "Tell the World" [...] draw influence from reggae. [...] "Dance with Me Tonight" [...] is a 1950s saxophone style record with elements of Doo-wop, while the track [...] "Just Smile" [...] {{is reminiscent of the}} work of Burt Bacharach. The disco-pop themed Right Place Right Time, Murs' third studio album, {{was released}} on 26 November 2012. Murs co-wrote the majority of the album with songwriters Steve Robson, Wayne Hector and Ed Drewett. [...] "Troublemaker" [...] was released as the lead single from the album, and it features Flo Rida. Lyrically, it documents Murs' obsession for a woman who he knows <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> him but he cannot resist her, while Flo Rida delivers a rap verse explaining why he finds alluring women attractive. The BBC's critic John Aizlewood described album tracks [...] "Head to Toe" [...] as adult-themed and [...] "Dear Darlin as solemn in its composition.|$|E
500|$|Worsley captained {{for just}} two seasons. He {{struggled}} {{with the demands of}} fielding, while his batting was disappointing. However, he was widely respected by the team. He was slightly more effective in his second season as leader, after which he retired. The next skipper, Alan Barber, although regarded as successful, captained for just one season. He was a more accomplished batsman and a great disciplinarian. However, he chose a career in teaching, limiting his availability, and resigned. The captain after that, Frank Greenwood, also did not hold the post long, resigning due to business commitments. Lord Hawke, writing in 1932, noted there had been eight captains since he retired in 1910. While six of them won the County Championship in their first season in charge, he stated that [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> a side to be always changing its captain". Only when Brian Sellers was appointed in 1933 did Yorkshire gain the leader they wanted. After skippering most games in 1932 during Greenwood's frequent absences, he remained in the role until 1947 and was considered the best county captain of his time.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s in the USA, third-wave {{feminism}} {{began as a}} response to perceived failures of the second wave and to the backlash against initiatives and movements created by the second wave. Third-wave feminism distinguished itself from the second wave around issues of sexuality, challenging female heterosexuality and celebrating sexuality as a means of female empowerment. Third-wave feminism also seeks to challenge or avoid what it deems the second wave's essentialist definitions of femininity, which, they argue, over-emphasize the experiences of upper middle-class white women. Third-wave feminists often focus on [...] "" [...] and challenge the second wave's paradigm as to what is, or <b>is</b> <b>not,</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> women, and tend to use a post-structuralist interpretation of gender and sexuality. Feminist leaders rooted in the second wave, such as Gloria Anzaldúa, bell hooks, Chela Sandoval, Cherríe Moraga, Audre Lorde, Maxine Hong Kingston, and many other non-white feminists, sought to negotiate a space within feminist thought for consideration of race-related subjectivities. Third-wave feminism also contains internal debates between difference feminists, who believe that there are important differences between the sexes, and those who believe that there are no inherent differences between the sexes and contend that gender roles are due to social conditioning.|$|E
500|$|Arsenal's first fixture of November {{was against}} Derby County at the newly built Pride Park Stadium. They were awarded a penalty {{kick in the}} first half after Patrick Vieira was fouled by Lee Carsley; Wright hit the penalty, which ricocheted off the goal crossbar. Two goals by Paulo Wanchope and a late strike by Dean Sturridge {{condemned}} Arsenal to their first defeat of the league season. Arsenal played Manchester United on 9 November 1997 and needed a win to stay one point behind the league leaders. Wenger admitted in his pre-match comments that a second successive defeat would make it [...] "difficult" [...] for them to catch Manchester United, but not [...] "impossible". Striker Nicolas Anelka, standing in for Bergkamp, scored his first goal for Arsenal and Vieira added a second, leaving goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel rattled. Although Teddy Sheringham scored twice for Manchester United to level the score, midfielder David Platt headed into the far corner with seven minutes left of the match to score the winner for Arsenal. Wenger said of the win: [...] "This result is good for the English game because it will stimulate interest in the Premier League" [...] and opposing manager Alex Ferguson half agreed: [...] "A one-horse race <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> the game." [...] Arsenal failed to capitalise on the result, losing to Sheffield Wednesday and Liverpool, in a period where the team were depleted due to injuries.|$|E
500|$|Ralph Waldo Emerson never {{joined the}} Brook Farm community, despite several invitations. He wrote to Ripley on December 15, 1840, of his [...] "conviction that the Community <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> me". He also {{questioned}} the idealism of the community, particularly its optimism that all members would equally share responsibility and workload. As he wrote, [...] "The country members naturally {{were surprised to}} observe that one man ploughed all day and one looked out of a window all day... and both received at night the same wages". Twenty years later, Emerson publicly denounced the experiment in his collection of essays titled The Conduct of Life. Charles Lane, {{one of the founders}} of another community called Fruitlands, thought the Brook Farmers lived a lifestyle that did not sacrifice enough. As he said, they were [...] "playing away their youth and day-time in a miserably joyous frivolous manner". Like other communities, Brook Farm was criticized for its potential to break up the nuclear family because of its focus on working as a larger community. After its conversion to Fourierism, the Transcendentalists showed less support for the experiment. Henry David Thoreau questioned the community members' idealism and wrote in his journal, [...] "As for these communities, I think I had rather keep bachelor's hall in hell than go to board in heaven". Even Sophia Ripley later questioned their original optimism, referring to it as [...] "childish, empty, & sad".|$|E

2500|$|Midrash Rabbah Genesis VIII:1 interprets [...] "male {{and female}} He created them" [...] {{to mean that}} God {{originally}} created Adam as a hermaphrodite. In this way, adam was bodily and spiritually male and female.

2500|$|The idea in {{the text}} that Adam had a wife prior to Eve may have {{developed}} from {{an interpretation of the}} Book of Genesis and its dual creation accounts; while Genesis 2:22 describes God's creation of Eve from Adam's rib, an earlier passage, 1:27, already indicates that a woman had been made: [...] "So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them." [...] The Alphabet text places Lilith's creation after God's words in Genesis 2:18 that [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> man to be alone"; in this text God forms Lilith out of the clay from which he made Adam but she and Adam bicker.

2500|$|In 1890, Indians named [...] "No Neck" [...] and [...] "Black Heart" [...] {{testified in}} an inquiry before the Office of Indian Affairs. [...] The hearing weighed the {{morality}} of Indian employment in show business. [...] "You are engaged in the exhibition or show business," [...] observed the acting commissioner, A.C. Belt. [...] "It is not considered among white people a very helpful or elevating business. [...] I believe that which <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> the white people <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> the Indians, and what is bad for the white people is bad for the Indians." [...] The Indians defended their work as adamantly as any white performer, and they turned the inquiry into a pointed denunciation of the Indian policy by comparing conditions in the show {{with those of the}} Pine Ridge Agency. [...] The contrast reflected poorly on the Office of Indian Affairs. Rocky Bear began by pointing out that he long had served the interests of the federal government (Great White Father) by encouraging the development of Indian reservations. [...] He worked in a show that fed him well; [...] "that is why I am getting so fat," [...] he said, stroking his cheeks. [...] It was only in returning to the reservation that [...] "I am getting poor." [...] If the Great [...] Father wanted him to stop appearing in the show, he would stop. [...] But until then, [...] "that is the way I get money." [...] When he showed his inquisitors a purse filled with $300 in gold coins, saying [...] "I saved this money to buy some clothes for my children," [...] they were silenced. [...] Black Heart, too, denounced the allegations of mistreatment. [...] "We were raised on horseback; that is the way we had to work."
