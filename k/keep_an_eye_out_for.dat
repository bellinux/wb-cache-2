Environmental officials for these states have attempted to slow {{the spread of the}} snail by advising the public to <b>keep</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> the snails, and bleach or heat any gear which may contain mudsnails. Rivers have also been temporarily closed to fishing to avoid anglers spreading the snails.|$|E
25|$|Jefferson's ground sloth has {{a special}} place in modern paleontology, for Thomas Jefferson's letter on Megalonyx, read before the American Philosophical Society of Philadelphia in August 1796, marked the {{beginning}} of vertebrate paleontology in North America. When Lewis and Clark set out, Jefferson instructed Meriwether Lewis to <b>keep</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> ground sloths. He was hoping they would find some living in the Western range. Megalonyx jeffersonii was appropriately named after Thomas Jefferson.|$|E

Scott tried to get a naval vessel to go out and retrieve Countess of Harcourt, but none was available. Some did send out boats, as did some private individuals. Thinking that she might drift towards Bermuda, Scott advised the signal post to <b>keep</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> her and to let him know if they spotted her. Next morning a man from the signal post notified him that they had sighted a vessel answering the description of Countess of Harcourt.|$|E

500|$|Although Joseph Jackson {{initially}} {{demanded that}} his daughter's new album be recorded in Los Angeles {{so that he}} could <b>keep</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> her, Jam and Lewis refused. They required the entire production of the album to be done at their own studio in Minneapolis, Minnesota, [...] "far from the glitter and distractions of Hollywood and the interference of manager-fathers." [...] Jam stated, [...] "We required that they put her in our hands. We had to do it on our turf, with no bodyguards, no star trips and none of Joe Jackson's people hanging around making suggestions." [...] Control was recorded at Flyte Tyme Studios, the site for Flyte Tyme Records, founded by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis in Minneapolis. [...] "There's a little radiator I used to sit on when we did the Control album," [...] Jackson recalled in 1993. John McClain served as the executive producer.|$|E
500|$|While animal {{products}} {{were to be}} avoided during times of penance, pragmatic compromises often prevailed. The definition of [...] "fish" [...] was often extended to marine and semi-aquatic animals such as whales, barnacle geese, puffins and even beavers. The choice of ingredients may have been limited, {{but that did not}} mean that meals were smaller. Neither were there any restrictions against (moderate) drinking or eating sweets. Banquets held on fish days could be splendid, and were popular occasions for serving illusion food that imitated meat, cheese and eggs in various ingenious ways; fish could be moulded to look like venison and fake eggs could be made by stuffing empty egg shells with fish roe and almond milk and cooking them in coals. While Byzantine church officials took a hard-line approach, and discouraged any culinary refinement for the clergy, their Western counterparts were far more lenient. There was also no lack of grumbling about the rigours of fasting among the laity. During Lent, kings and schoolboys, commoners and nobility, all complained about being deprived of meat for the long, hard weeks of solemn contemplation of their sins. At Lent, owners of livestock were even warned to <b>keep</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> hungry dogs frustrated by a [...] "hard siege by Lent and fish bones".|$|E

Collector William T. Robey was one of those; he had written to a friend on May 10 mentioning that [...] "it would pay {{to be on the lookout}} for inverts". On May 14, Robey went to the post office to buy the new stamps, and as he wrote later, when the clerk brought out a sheet of inverts, [...] "my heart stood still". He paid for the sheet, and asked to see more, but the remainder of the sheets were normal.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to gentrification, Williamsburg often saw {{tension between}} its Hasidic {{population}} and its black and Hispanic groups. In response to decades of rising {{crime in the}} area, the Hasidim created a volunteer patrol organization called [...] "Shomrim" [...] ("guardians" [...] in Hebrew) to perform citizens' arrests and to <b>keep</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> crime. Over the years, the Shomrim {{have been accused of}} racism and brutality against blacks and Hispanics. In 2009, Yakov Horowitz, a member of Shomrim, was charged with assault for striking a Latino adolescent on the nose with his Walkie Talkie. In 2014, five members of the Hasidic community, at least two of whom were Shomrim members, were arrested in connection with the December 2013 [...] "gang assault" [...] of a black gay man.|$|E
2500|$|While {{there are}} no hidden {{messages}} in the architecture, {{there have been numerous}} occurrences and reports of alleged ghostly phenomena. The Egyptian has been widely rumored to be the home of two ghosts. One is said to be that of Irv Kummerfeldt, co-founder of PET; Kummerfeldt had a heart attack and died at the top of [...] "Aisle One" [...] in the Egyptian Theatre's auditorium. His ghost has been reported in that area of the theatre ever since. The second ghost, [...] "Bob," [...] as theatre workers and preservationists have dubbed it, is much more free roaming. Bob has been seen throughout the building; objects have moved on their own, doors have opened on their own, and people have felt a tap on their shoulder when no one else is around. Occasionally, footsteps have been heard echoing across the auditorium.
