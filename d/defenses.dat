5|$|Plant <b>defenses</b> can be {{classified}} generally as constitutive or induced. Constitutive <b>defenses</b> are always present in the plant, while induced <b>defenses</b> are produced or mobilized to the site where a plant is injured. There is wide variation in the composition and concentration of constitutive <b>defenses</b> and these range from mechanical <b>defenses</b> to digestibility reducers and toxins. Many external mechanical <b>defenses</b> and large quantitative <b>defenses</b> are constitutive, as they require large amounts of resources to produce and are difficult to mobilize. A variety of molecular and biochemical approaches are {{used to determine the}} mechanism of constitutive and induced plant <b>defenses</b> responses against herbivory.|$|E

5|$|Historically, insects {{have been}} the most {{significant}} herbivores, and the evolution of land plants is closely associated with the evolution of insects.

5|$|Induced <b>defenses</b> include {{secondary}} metabolic products, {{as well as}} morphological {{and physiological}} changes. An advantage of inducible, as opposed to constitutive <b>defenses,</b> {{is that they are}} only produced when needed, and are therefore potentially less costly, especially when herbivory is variable.|$|E
5|$|Like other animals, fish {{suffer from}} {{diseases}} and parasites. To prevent disease {{they have a}} variety of <b>defenses.</b> Non-specific <b>defenses</b> include the skin and scales, as well as the mucus layer secreted by the epidermis that traps and inhibits the growth of microorganisms. If pathogens breach these <b>defenses,</b> fish can develop an inflammatory response that increases blood flow to the infected region and delivers white blood cells that attempt to destroy pathogens. Specific <b>defenses</b> respond to particular pathogens recognised by the fish's body, i.e., an immune response. In recent years, vaccines have become widely used in aquaculture and also with ornamental fish, for example furunculosis vaccines in farmed salmon and koi herpes virus in koi.|$|E
5|$|Sharon ordered Matt to push northward to Serabaeum again, where paratroopers of the 81st Battalion were occupying <b>defenses.</b> The attack failed once more, and Sharon now sent Reshef on Matt's left flank. Using a {{battalion}} of some thirty tanks with mechanized infantry, Reshef used his superior maneuverability to flank the Egyptian position. There was heavy, close-quarter fighting in the trenches, and extra units were brought up against the Orcha position. The paratroopers reported their <b>defenses</b> to have been penetrated during the afternoon, and they later withdrew after detonating the bridges over the Sweetwater Canal at Serabaeum. The Israelis captured Egyptian positions in the area, and discovered that Orcha Hill contained a major Egyptian radio intercept station. The capture of Orcha caused the collapse of Egyptian <b>defenses</b> in the area; the paratroopers pulled back {{to the village of}} Ain Ghasin five kilometres north, and Azmy ordered the 89th Battalion to withdraw to the adjacent Touscan strong point, abandoning the ramparts at Serabaeum. These were occupied by the Israelis, which they used to fire on Egyptian positions across the canal. The Egyptians hastily organised <b>defenses</b> at Touscan.

5|$|The carbon:nutrient balance hypothesis, {{also known}} as the {{environmental}} constraint hypothesis or Carbon Nutrient Balance Model (CNBM), states that the various types of plant <b>defenses</b> are responses to variations in the levels of nutrients in the environment. This hypothesis predicts the Carbon/Nitrogen ratio in plants determines which secondary metabolites will be synthesized. For example, plants growing in nitrogen-poor soils will use carbon-based <b>defenses</b> (mostly digestibility reducers), while those growing in low-carbon environments (such as shady conditions) are more likely to produce nitrogen-based toxins. The hypothesis further predicts that plants can change their <b>defenses</b> in response to changes in nutrients. For example, if plants are grown in low-nitrogen conditions, then these plants will implement a defensive strategy composed of constitutive carbon-based <b>defenses.</b> If nutrient levels subsequently increase, by for example the addition of fertilizers, these carbon-based <b>defenses</b> will decrease.|$|E

40|$|All {{countries}} {{strive for}} a capable national <b>defense</b> {{supported by a}} strong national <b>defense</b> industry. Supporting national <b>defense</b> with imported <b>defense</b> systems has many limitations and risks because the terms of arms trade agreements between countries may easily {{be influenced by the}} political climate of the signatories. As a result, establishing an independent national <b>defense</b> requires a strong national <b>defense</b> industry. Furthermore, exporting <b>defense</b> systems may be an important source of national income. National <b>defense</b> industries mostly consist of large-scale <b>defense</b> firms that have the resources required for big <b>defense</b> contracts. However, small to medium enterprises (SMEs) do not have the necessary resources, therefore they are at a disadvantage. To overcome this handicap and be part of the business, <b>defense</b> industry clusters mostly consisting of SMEs are being established.
