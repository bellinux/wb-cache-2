25|$|In 1790, William Kelly of Glasgow used a {{new method}} {{to assist the}} draw stroke. First animals, and then water, {{was used as the}} prime mover. Wright of Manchester moved the <b>head</b> <b>stock</b> to the centre of the machine, {{allowing}} twice as many spindles; a squaring band was added to ensure the spindles came out in a straight line. He was in conversation with John Kennedy {{about the possibility of a}} self-acting mule. Kennedy, a partner in McConnell & Kennedy machine makers in Ancoats, was concerned with building ever larger mules. McConnell & Kennedy ventured into spinning when they were left with two unpaid-for mules; their firm prospered and eventually merged into the Fine Spinners & Doublers Association. In 1793, John Kennedy was addressing the problem of fine counts. With these counts, the spindles on the return traverse needed to rotate faster than on the outward traverse. He attached gears and a clutch to implement this motion.|$|E
500|$|Before {{construction}} of the various private stockyards, tavern owners provided pastures and care for cattle herds waiting to be sold. [...] With the spreading service of railroads, several small stockyards were created {{in and around the}} City of Chicago. In 1848, a stockyard called the Bulls Head Market was opened to the public. [...] The Bulls <b>Head</b> <b>Stock</b> Yards were located at Madison Street and Ogden Avenue. [...] In the years that followed, several small stockyards were scattered throughout the city. [...] Between 1852 and 1865, five (5) railroads were constructed to Chicago. [...] The stockyards that sprang up were usually built along various rail lines of these new railroad companies. Some railroads built their own stockyards in Chicago. [...] The Illinois Central and the Michigan Central railroads combined to build the largest set of pens on the lake shore east of Cottage Grove Avenue from 29th Street to 35th Street. [...] In 1878, the New York Central Railroad managed to buy a controlling interest in the Michigan Central Railroad. [...] In this way, Cornelius Vanderbilt, owner of the New York Central Railroad, got his start in the stockyard business in Chicago.|$|E

50|$|A wet {{horizontal}} MPI {{machine is}} {{the most commonly used}} mass-production inspection machine. The machine has a head and tail stock where the part is placed to magnetize it.

5000|$|In 2010 the Fender Custom Shop {{released}} a limited issue of 30 '72 Telecaster Custom relics. While they {{used some of}} the original '72 design features such as the three bolt neck and the classic look, these guitars had many more differences from the originals. The body is made of ash, and features a belly cut. The neck is one piece maple with a flatter 9.5 inch radius and larger 6105 frets. The <b>head</b> <b>stock</b> has the original design [...] "Custom" [...] logo. The neck pickup is a custom wound wide range humbucker. Alnico 2 magnets were used which more closely resemble {{the sound of the}} CuNiFe magets used the original Seth Lover pickup (I have only been able to verify this with a phone call to Fenders customer service). The bridge pickup is a [...] "hot nocaster". The overwound pickup has more output which better matches the output of the neck pickup. These guitars are distinguished from production reissues by a [...] "Custom Shop Limited Edition" [...] logo {{on the back of the}} <b>head</b> <b>stock</b> and also on the neck plate.|$|E

Stub (short) versions, the same taper angle but a little over half the usual length, are occasionally encountered for the whole number sizes from 1 through 5.

If it has a pickguard it is a V1. If it has a back-routed control cavity and a bolt-on 24 fret neck it is a V2. If it has back-routed control cavity and a bolt-on 22 fret neck it is a V3. If it is a neck-through guitar it is V4.|$|E
5000|$|An underbone is a {{motorcycle}} {{built on a}} chassis consisting mostly of a single large diameter tube. An underbone differs from a conventional motorcycle mainly by not having a structural member connecting the <b>head</b> <b>stock</b> to the structure under {{the front of the}} seat and by not having a fuel tank or similarly styled appendage in the space between the riders knees.

50|$|The first commercially {{successful}} solid-body {{electric guitar}} was the Fender Broadcaster in 1950. A trademark {{dispute with the}} Gretsch Corporation who marketed a line of Broadcaster drums led to a name change to the current designation, Fender Telecaster in 1951 (Transition instruments produced between the two model names had no model name on the <b>head</b> <b>stock</b> and are now referred to as 'No Casters"). Fender also produced a one pickup version called the Fender Esquire starting in 1950. These were followed by the Gibson Les Paul in 1952.|$|E
5000|$|Some Squier IIs {{were made}} in India around 1989-1990. The <b>head</b> <b>stock</b> is marked [...] "MADE IN INDIA". Made in India Squier IIs seem to follow the made in USA serial {{numbering}} scheme. For example, a 1990 made in India Squier II serial number would start with N0 plus 5 digits. The serial number is printed on a sticker located {{on the back of}} the neck, close to where the neck attaches to the body. Because the number was placed on a sticker it is fairly common for the serial number to be missing.|$|E
5000|$|The Dean Edge is {{a series}} of similar bass guitars {{produced}} by Dean Guitars.

A very distinguishing feature of the Edge is the asymmetrical <b>head</b> <b>stock</b> design and the lack of a pickguard. The number of strings varies from four to ten.

50|$|In woodworking, {{wide belt}} sanders use platens {{to press the}} sanding paper {{into contact with the}} wood being sanded. The platen sits between two steel rolls which deliver the moving force to the sanding belt. Sanding heads with a platen are used on finish sanding with papers of finer grits, when the coarser ones are {{typically}} used with contact drum type sanding <b>heads.</b> <b>Stock</b> is fed {{into and out of the}} machine on a conveyor belt. Since the abrasive belt creates a substantial pressure on the stock that tends to push the stock toward the infeed, the hold down shoes and rollers hold the workpiece down against the belt while it is moving through the machine in order to ensure uniform contact with the abrasive and continuous movement.|$|R

5000|$|By 1825/30, the {{instruments}} usually had a headstock in a figure eight shape (similar in shape to the guitar's body). In 1825 Stauffer invented the machine heads named after him: a metal plate with an asymmetrical [...] "scroll" [...] headstock, machine heads with worm gears {{mounted on the}} plate, arranged in a single line on the upper side of the <b>head</b> <b>stock</b> (six-in-line). This [...] "Stauffer" [...] headstock and design was reproduced by his son Anton, and copied by many luthiers in the 19th century. The asymmetrical headstock is variously referred to as being shaped like a [...] "scroll" [...] (a violin scroll in profile), a [...] "snail", and a [...] "Persian slipper". As of 2014 such [...] "Stauffer style" [...] machine heads are still made by the UK company Rodgers Tuning Machines. The Stauffer-style scroll headstock and tuning machines have been in use since the 19th century {{and continue to be}} used on guitar-related instruments in Central Europe such as larger tamburica.|$|E
5000|$|The typical Starcaster Strat Pack solid-body {{electric}} is {{fitted with}} 3 single coil pickups, a five way selector switch and a floating tremolo bridge. The neck on models up to 2011 features the large CBS <b>head</b> <b>stock</b> {{and may have}} 21 or 22 frets depending on the model. Some models have the headstock painted to match the guitar body. Recent Starcaster models feature the smaller Fender headstock. The body may be basswood or agathis depending on model and year of manufacture. Other minor changes such as a lower grade tremolo have also been made {{to bring down the}} cost, as well as the Starcaster being manufactured in Far Eastern countries such as China or Indonesia. The pickup cavity is routed to allow an H-S-H pickup configuration, which allows for flexibility in pickup arrangement. Although most models feature the classic Stratocaster configuration of 3 single-coil pickups, at least one uses the S-S-H pickup configuration with a humbucker in the bridge position. It is not considered a Strat copy because the Stratocaster design is owned by Fender [...]|$|E
50|$|This {{aftermarket}} racing GM Pro <b>Stock</b> <b>head</b> {{was capable}} of 1300 horsepower@9500 rpm with a BMEP of 238 psi.

In fact a BMEP of 238 puts it {{near the top of}} the racing engine world. It is close to the limit for a naturally aspirated gas-burning engine.
