30|$|Field {{devices are}} {{designed}} to be reliable, often incorporating backup power and redundancy in the form of backup I/O cards. If a device is connected to an I/O card that fails, the device automatically gets connected to the redundant I/O. In the absence of this feature, if an <b>input</b> <b>card</b> fails, signals would be lost until the card is replaced. Through the use of SCADA and Field Devices, it becomes possible to monitor and control large scale systems (such as gas pipelines, which cover very large distances) cheaply and efficiently.|$|R
40|$|The {{computer}} program PEDIC is described for {{estimation of the}} effect of evacuation on population exposure. The program uses joint frequency, annual average meteorological data and a simple population evacuation model to estimate exposure reduction due to movement of people away from radioactive plumes following an acute release of activity. Atmospheric dispersion is based on a sector averaged Gaussian model with consideration of plume rise and building wake effects. Appendices to the report provide details of the {{computer program}} design, a program listing, <b>input</b> <b>card</b> preparation instructions and sample problems...|$|R
50|$|PLC {{software}} {{would be}} tested by sequencing the toggle switches to input the electrical {{signals to the}} <b>input</b> <b>cards</b> on the PLC, and then observing the response by software on the indicator lights and operator consoles. For small simple systems, this type of testing was manageable, and resulted in some degree of confidence that the control software would work once it was installed. However, {{the amount of time}} spent performing the test was relatively high, and a real time test could not be achieved.|$|E
5000|$|... "ADAT" [...] is also {{currently}} {{used as an}} abbreviation for the ADAT Lightpipe protocol, which transfers 8 tracks in a single fiber optic cable. The ADAT cable standard is no longer strictly tied to ADAT tape machines, and is now utilized by analog-to-digital converters, <b>input</b> <b>cards</b> for digital audio workstations, effects machines, etc. One of the original benefits of utilizing ADAT versus S/PDIF or AES3 was that a single cable could carry up to eight channels of audio. (AES10 (MADI) can now carry up to 64 channels.) ...|$|E
50|$|An {{activity}} in many unit record shops was sorting card decks into the order {{necessary for the}} next processing step. Sorters, like the IBM 80 series Card Sorters, sorted <b>input</b> <b>cards</b> into one of 13 pockets depending on the holes punched in a selected column and the sorter's settings. The 13th pocket was for blanks and rejects. Sorting an input card deck into ascending sequence on a multiple column field, such as an employee number, was done by a radix sort, bucket sort, {{or a combination of}} the two methods.|$|E
5000|$|The TAM {{featured}} a 250 MHz PowerPC 603e processor and 12.1" [...] active matrix LCD powered by an ATI 3D Rage II video chipset with 2MB of VRAM capable of displaying up to 16bit color at either 800x600 or 640x480 pixels. It had a vertically mounted 4x SCSI CD-ROM and an Apple floppy Superdrive, a 2GB ATA hard drive, a TV/FM tuner, an S-Video <b>input</b> <b>card,</b> and a custom-made Bose sound system including two [...] "Jewel" [...] speakers and a subwoofer {{built into the}} externally located power supply [...] "base unit".|$|R
50|$|One of the {{earliest}} text entry interfaces was the punched <b>card</b> <b>input.</b> A punched <b>card</b> <b>input</b> is a computer input device used to read executable computer programs, source code, and data from punched cards. Most early computers used punched cards as their main input device. Along with a card punch, punched card readers were an earlier method of entering data and running programs before {{the current generation of}} input devices existed. A card punch is an output device that punches holes in cards under computer control. Sometimes card readers were combined with card punches and, later, other devices to form multifunction machines.|$|R
5000|$|The Program Development Facility (PDF) and XEDIT editors for MVS and VM/SP (ISPF/PDF was {{available}} for VM, but little used) respectively make extensive use of 3270 features. [...] The modified data tag is well suited to converting formatted, structured punched <b>card</b> <b>input</b> onto the 3270 display device. With the appropriate programming, any batch program that uses formatted, structured <b>card</b> <b>input</b> can be layered onto a 3270 terminal.|$|R
50|$|An IBM {{card sorter}} is a machine for sorting decks of punched {{cards in the}} format popularized by the International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), which {{dominated}} the punched card data processing industry {{for much of the}} twentieth century. Sorting was a major activity in most facilities that processed data on punched cards using unit record equipment. The work flow of many processes required decks of cards to be put into some specific order as determined by the data punched in the cards. The same deck might be sorted differently for different processing steps. The IBM 80 series sorters sorted <b>input</b> <b>cards</b> into one of 13 pockets depending on the holes punched in a selected column and the sorter's settings.|$|E
50|$|Software-based PC & video-card {{controllers}} is {{a computer}} running an operating system (e.g., Windows, Linux, Mac) in a PC or server equipped with special multiple-output graphic cards and optionally with video capture <b>input</b> <b>cards.</b> These video wall controllers are often built on industrial-grade chassis due to the reliability requirements of control rooms and situational centers. Though this approach is typically more expensive, {{the advantage of a}} software-based video wall controller vs the hardware splitter is that it can launch applications like maps, VoIP client (to display IP cameras), SCADA clients, Digital Signage software that can directly utilize the full resolution of the video wall. That is why software-based controllers are widely used in control rooms and high-end Digital Signage. The performance of the software controller depends on both the quality of graphic cards and management software. There are a number of multi-head (multiple output) graphic cards commercially available. Most of general purpose multi-output cards manufactured by AMD (Eyefinity technology), NVidia (Mosaic technology) support up to 6-12 genlocked outputs. General purpose cards also do not have optimizations for displaying multiple video streams from capture cards. To achieve larger number of displays or high video input performance one needs to use specialized graphic cards (e.g. Datapath Limited, Matrox Graphics, Jupiter Systems).Video wall controllers typically support bezel correction (outside frame of monitor) to correct for any bezel with LED displays or overlap the images to blend edges with projectors.|$|E
5000|$|In February 2005 the {{television}} show MythBusters used twelve Meyer Sound 700-HP subwoofers—a model and quantity that has been employed for major rock concerts. Normal operating frequency range of the selected subwoofer model was 28 Hz to 150 Hz but the 12 enclosures at MythBusters had been specially modified for deeper bass extension. Roger Schwenke and John Meyer directed the Meyer Sound team in devising a special test rig that would produce very high sound levels at infrasonic frequencies. The subwoofers' tuning ports were blocked and their <b>input</b> <b>cards</b> were altered. The modified cabinets were positioned in an open ring configuration: four stacks of three subwoofers each. Test signals were generated by a SIM 3 audio analyzer, with its software modified to produce infrasonic tones. A Brüel & Kjær sound level analyzer, fed with an attenuated signal from a model 4189 measurement microphone, displayed and recorded sound pressure levels. The experimenters on the show tried a series of frequencies as low as 5 Hz, attaining a level of 120 decibels of sound pressure at 9 Hz and up to 153 dB at frequencies above 20 Hz, but the rumored physiological effects did not materialize. The test subjects all reported some physical anxiety and shortness of breath, even {{a small amount of}} nausea, but this was dismissed by the experimenters, noting that sound at that frequency and intensity moves air rapidly in and out of one's lungs. The show declared the brown note myth [...] "busted." ...|$|E
50|$|Each <b>input</b> <b>card</b> {{was read}} at two {{successive}} reading stations. Thus, for example, fields in a card {{could be compared}} with the following card and, should a change be detected, say in invoice number, totals could be printed. Unlike earlier IBM tabulating machines, which had 80 read brushes at each read station, one for each column, the 407 had 960 brushes at each station, one for each possible hole in a punched card. Cards were held in position during each read cycle and the per digit pulses needed were generated using commutators, one for each column. This allowed the card to be read more than once at each station, for greater flexibility.|$|R
40|$|The <b>Input</b> Mezzanine <b>Card</b> for the ATLAS Fast TracKer (FTK) System In {{this paper}} the <b>Input</b> Mezzanine <b>card</b> of the ATLAS Fast TracKer (FTK) system is presented. FTK is an {{approved}} ATLAS upgrade {{that has the}} goal to provide {{a complete list of}} tracks to the ATLAS HLT (High Level Triggers) for each level- 1 accepted event, up to 100 kHz event rate, with a very small latency, of the order of 100 μsec. The FTK will receive data from the pixel and microstrip detectors to reconstruct data from the whole silicon tracking detector to provide high-quality reconstructed track parameters for all tracks with transverse momentum above 1 GeV/c to the HLT. The FTK <b>Input</b> Mezzanine <b>card</b> is the <b>input</b> stage of the FTK system. Its role is to perform real time clustering of microstrip and pixel data, thus reducing the amount of data propagated to the subsequent processing levels with minimal information loss. To achieve this, 1 D-clustering is executed on the microstrip data. A more advanced and demanding 2 D-clustering algorithm is implemented on the pixel data, which uses a moving-window technique. We report on the design of the card, the firmware used, the testing results of the integrated hardware as well as comparisons with the simulation...|$|R
