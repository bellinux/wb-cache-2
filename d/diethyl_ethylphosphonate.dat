40|$|Di-isopropyl methylphosphonate (DIMP) and {{dimethyl}} methylphosphonate (DMMP) are byproducts and surrogates for Sarin (GB) and VX; they are readily quantitated at {mu}g/L concentrations in groundwaters. Liter aqueous samples are fortified with triethylphosphate, then {{passed through a}} sandwich of 3 preconditioned extraction disks: glass fiber filter to remove particulates, C{sub 18 }-based extraction disk to collect DIMP, and carbon-based extraction disk to collect DMMP. The two extraction disks are dried and extracted with MeOH. After the extract is fortified with with <b>diethyl</b> <b>ethylphosphonate</b> internal standard, it is analyzed using a gas chromatograph with a nitrogen- phosphorus detector. When the pump and treat criterion is used, detection limits for DMMP and DIMP are 2 {mu}g/L. Method recovery is 40 - 50 %, based on synthetic groundwaters containing 0. 2 - 50 {mu}g/L of each analyte. DIMP and DMMP are cleanly resolved...|$|E
40|$|Dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP) is {{a widely}} used chemical. <b>Diethyl</b> <b>ethylphosphonate</b> (DEEP) has been {{proposed}} {{as a replacement for}} DMMP in several applications. A long-term carcinogenesis study with DMMP in rats and mice showed {{a significant increase in the}} incidence of kidney tumors after 2 years of exposure in male but not in female rats and both sexes of mice. DMMP is not genotoxic. Due to these findings, a role of � 2 uglobulin accumulation in organ-specific tumorigenicity may be possible. � 2 u-Globulin is a low-molecular-weight protein synthesized in male rats under androgen control. Several male rat specific renal carcinogens have been shown to bind to � 2 u-globulin and to impair the renal degradation of this protein. This impairment results in � 2 u-globulin accumulation in the kidney, lysosomal overload, cell death, cell proliferation, and finally, renal tumor induction. To further characterize the toxicology of DMMP an...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the relative-rate {{technique}} {{has been used}} to obtain rate coefficients for the reaction of two organophosphorus compounds: Triethyl phosphate (TEP) and <b>Diethyl</b> <b>ethylphosphonate</b> (DEEP) with OH radicals and Cl atoms at atmospheric pressure and at different temperatures. The calculated rate constants were fitted to the Arrhenius expression over the temperature range 298 – 352 K. The following expressions (in cm 3 molecule- 1 s- 1) were obtained for the reactions of OH and CL with DEEP and TEP: kOH+DEEP= (7. 84 ± 0. 65) x 10 - 14 exp((1866 ± 824) /T), kOH+TEP = (6. 54 ± 0. 42) x 10 - 14 exp((1897 ± 626) /T), kCl+DEEP = (5. 27 ± 0. 80) x 10 − 11 exp(765 ± 140 /T) and kCl+TEP = (5. 23 ± 0. 80) x 10 − 11 exp(736 ± 110 /T). These results show that the reaction of the studied compounds with Cl atoms proceeds more rapidly than that with OH radicals. The related tropospheric lifetimes suggest that once emitted into the atmosphere, TEP and DEEP can be removed within a few hours in areas close to their emission sources. TEP and DEEP are principally removed by OH radicals. However, in coastal areas where the Cl atoms’ concentration is higher, TEP and DEEP removal by reaction with Cl atoms could be a competitive process...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe present {{contribution}} {{deals with}} the ease of controlling the thermosensitivity of statistical copolymers prepared by free radical polymerization playing on the reactivity ratios of both monomers used for the synthesis. The copolymers were prepared using N-n-propylacrylamide (NnPAAm) monomer to achieve the thermoresponsive properties. The second monomer was either (dimethoxyphosphoryl) methyl 2 -methylacrylate (MAPC 1) or <b>diethyl</b> 2 -(acrylamido) <b>ethylphosphonate</b> (DAAmEP) in order to incorporate phosphonic acid moieties after hydrolysis. The architecture of these original statistical copolymers was determined by measuring the reactivity ratios of both (NnPAAm/MAPC 1) and (NnPAAm/DAAmEP) monomer couples. By varying the chemical nature of the phosphonated-based monomer (methacrylate or acrylamide), {{it was possible to}} get different reactivity ratios, and as a consequence to significantly affect the thermosensitive behavior of the statistical copolymers for a constant proportion of phosphonic acid groups. Additionally, all copolymers showed similar sorption rates toward nickel cations (Ni 2 +) ...|$|R
40|$|Future NASA {{missions}} {{aimed at}} exploring Mars, the Moon, {{and the outer}} planets require rechargeable batteries that can operate over a wide temperature range (- 60 to + 60 C) {{to satisfy the requirements}} of various applications. In addition, many of these applications will require improved safety, due to their use by humans. Currently, the state-of-the-art lithium-ion (Li-ion) system has been demonstrated to operate over a wide range of temperatures (- 40 to + 40 C); however, abuse conditions can often lead to cell rupture and fire. The nature of the electrolyte can greatly affect the propensity of the cell/battery to catch fire, given the flammability of the organic solvents used within. Li-ion electrolytes have been developed that contain a flame-retardant additive in conjunction with fluorinated co-solvents to provide a safe system with a wide operating temperature range. Previous work incorporated fluorinated esters into multi-component electrolyte formulations, which were demonstrated to cover a temperature range from 60 to + 60 C. This work was described in Fluoroester Co-Solvents for Low-Temperature Li+ Cells (NPO- 44626), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 33, No. 9 (September 2009), p. 37; and Optimized Li-Ion Electrolytes Con tain ing Fluorinated Ester Co-Solvents (NPO- 45824), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 34, No. 3 (March 2010), p. 48. Other previous work improved the safety characteristics of the electrolytes by adding flame-retardant additives such as triphenyl phosphate (TPhPh), tri-butyl phosphate (TBuPh), triethyl phosphate (TEtPh), and bis(2, 2, 2 -trifluoroethyl) methyl phosphonate (TFMPo). The current work involves further investigation of other types of flame-retardant additives, including tris(2, 2, 2 -trifluoroethyl) phosphate, tris(2, 2, 2 -trifluoroethyl) phosphite, triphenylphosphite, <b>diethyl</b> <b>ethylphosphonate,</b> and diethyl phenylphosphonate added to an electrolyte composition intended for wide operating temperatures. In general, many of the formulations investigated in this study displayed good performance over a wide temperature range, good cycle life characteristics, and are expected to have improved safety characteristics, such as low flammability. Of the electrolytes studied, 1. 0 M LiPF 6 in EC+EMC+DEP (20 : 75 : 5 v/v %) and 1. 0 M LiPF 6 in EC+EMC+DPP (20 : 75 : 5 v/v %) displayed the best operation at low temperatures, whereas the electrolyte containing triphenylphosphite displayed the best cycle life performance compared to the baseline solution. It is anticipated that further improvements can be made to the life characteristics with the incorporation of a SET promoters (such as VC, vinylene carbonate), which will likely inhibit the decomposition of the flame-retardant additives...|$|E
