5|$|Burnet's work on graft-versus-host was in {{collaboration}} with Lone Simonsen between 1960 and 1962. Simonsen had shown in 1957 that when a chick embryo was inoculated intravenously with adult-fowl blood, a graft-versus-host reaction occurred; this {{was known as the}} Simonsen phenomenon. Their work in this system would later help to explain passenger leukocytes in transplantation. The last project he worked on at the Institute was a study with assistant Margaret Holmes of autoimmune disease in the New Zealand black mouse model; this mouse has a high incidence of spontaneous autoimmune hemolytic anemia. They looked at the inheritance of autoimmune disease, and their use of <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>drug</b> cyclophosphamide to treat the disease influenced the use of immunosuppressive drugs in human autoimmune disease.|$|E

40|$|Mesenchymal {{stem cells}} (MSC) {{represent}} a heterogenous population of nonhematopoietic stem cells with multipotent differential potential. MSC can be isolated from various tissues of organism, {{the most common}} tissue are bone marrow or adipose tissue. MSC are good candidates for treatment of autoimmune diseases and possess the ability to prevent graft rejection or graft versus host disease. The <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>drugs</b> are currently used for inhibition of unwanted immune reaction but they exhibit serious side effects. The use of MSC in therapy can reduce doses of <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>drugs</b> and eliminate side effects. The study of MSC and immunosuppressant interactions should be detected before MSC {{can be used for}} clinical application. We aimed to analyze the interaction between MSC and <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>drugs</b> and their effect on immune cells. Cyclosporine A and mycophenolate mofetil were used in our research. We demonstrated changes in the expression of surface molecules, production of interleukin 6 and in metabolic activity of MSC after treatment with <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>drugs.</b> MSC are in organism, in cooperation with the number of other cells.

50|$|Immunophilins are the {{receptor}} molecules for the <b>Immunosuppressive</b> <b>drugs.</b> Immunophilins {{are targeted}} by <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>drugs</b> such as sirolimus, cyclosporin, and tacrolimus. For these drugs in particular, known immunophilins such as cyclophilin catalyze the cis-trans isomerization of peptide bonds, particularly X-Pro peptide bonds. This prolyl isomerase activity can be inhibited by <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>drugs.</b> Immunophilin complexes bind to calceneurin which inhibits the phosphate activity and engenders immunosuppresive effects. Immunophilins forms protein complex with ryanodine and inositol triphosphate (IP3) which impacts {{the release of}} calcium.|$|R
500|$|Human Revolution {{takes place}} in the year 2027, 25 years prior to the {{original}} Deus Ex. The Deus Ex series is set in a cyberpunk future rife with secret organizations and conspiracies: among these forces is the Illuminati. Leading up to Human Revolution, there have been marked improvements in human society, with people actively combating global warming, finding cures for a large variety of diseases, and improving green energy. Alongside this, global megacorporations have come to eclipse government authority in power and influence, while private military forces dwarf the sanctioned armies of First World countries. Advances in biotechnology and cybernetics have {{led to the development of}} [...] "augmentations", advanced artificial organs capable of greatly improving and enhancing the human body's performance. The development of augmentation technology has triggered the creation of a new social divide: those with augmentations become the world's new upper class citizenry and are touted as the future of humanity, while normal humans form the majority of the lower-class population. Augmentations also come with the necessity of taking Neuropozyne, a limited and expensive <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>drug</b> that stops the body rejecting the technology. By the events of Human Revolution, society is being divided between [...] "augs", humans who have accepted augmentation technology; and normal humans who are either morally opposed to it, too poor to afford it, or whose bodies actively reject it. The tensions between the two factions begin generating open conflict.|$|E
2500|$|Orlistat {{may reduce}} plasma levels of {{ciclosporin}} (also known as [...] "cyclosporin" [...] or [...] "cyclosporine", trade names Sandimmune, Gengraf, Neoral, etc.), an <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>drug</b> frequently {{used to prevent}} transplant rejection; the two drugs should therefore not be administered concomitantly. Orlistat can also impair absorption of the antiarrhythmic amiodarone. The MHRA has recently suggested that Orlistat could theoretically reduce the absorption of antiretroviral HIV medications.|$|E

40|$|<b>Immunosuppressive</b> <b>drugs</b> are agents {{capable of}} {{modulating}} {{at least one}} type of immune response in vivo at doses with tolerable side-effects. Classical <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>drugs</b> include corticosteroids, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and cyclosporine. In {{the past two years}} tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil were registered as <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>drugs.</b> Tacrolimus interferes with the calcium-dependent signal transduction of T-lymphocytes. Mycophenolate mofetil is an inhibitor of purine synthesis by inhibition of the enzyme inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase. Both tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil have proven efficacy in both prevention and treatment of acute allograft rejection. The new drugs are stronger than the classical ones but do not cause more adverse reactions.

As with corticosteroids, we try to modulate <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>drugs</b> according to the degree of intraocular inflammation and the possible occurrence of complications and/or recurrences and/or disease extension in the same eye or bilaterally. In case of improvement/remission, corticosteroids are gradually tapered until their withdrawal, with a subsequent reduction in the use of <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>drugs.</b>|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Whether the {{addition}} of <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>drugs</b> to standard antithyroid drugs reduces the relapse risk in Graves' disease remains uncertain. PURPOSE: The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effects of <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>drugs</b> on the relapse rate after a first episode of hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease. METHODS: Based on a pre-specified protocol, PubMed (1946 -July 2015), EMBASE (1947 -July 2015), and Cochrane (1992 -July 2015) databases were searched. The search was for (randomized) controlled trials comparing <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>drugs</b> with a control group. PRISMA and SIGN statements were used for assessing data quality. Two reviewers extracted data, with any disagreement being resolved by consensus. Data were pooled using a random-effects model. RESULTS: The primary endpoint was relapse of disease until follow-up. Secondary endpoints included reduction of thyroid volume and decrease in thyrotropin-receptor antibody (TRAb) levels. Seven trials with 862 participants were included. Most trials were small with a moderate to high risk of bias. There were 113 relapses in 481 (23. 5 %) patients receiving <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>drugs</b> compared with 225 relapses in 381 (59. 1 %) control patients (risk ratio for recurrence 0. 55; [confidence interval (CI) 0. 41 - 0. 75]). Subgroup analyses showed similar effects for randomized trials and controlled trials (I 2 0 %), and for trials using corticosteroid and non-corticosteroid <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>drugs</b> (I 2 0 %). Use of <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>drugs</b> also resulted in significant reductions in thyroid volume (- 10. 72 mL [CI - 15. 59 to - 5. 85]) and TRAb levels (- 17. 01 IU/L [CI - 33. 31 to - 0. 72]). Immunosuppressive drug-related adverse effects were not systematically reported, and thus were not included in the quantitative analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence suggests a possible relevant reduction in relapse risk when <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>drugs</b> are added to standard treatment of Graves' disease. The small number of trials with high heterogeneity in regard to treatment modalities and the lack of systematic reporting of adverse effects calls for larger, conclusive trials...|$|R

Observations by others have indicated a higher incidence of neoplasias in immunosuppressed patients, presenting Chagas' disease reactivation, submitted to treatment with benznidazole. In the present study, we investigated whether there is a potentiation in the generation of lymphomas in chronically infected mice, treated with <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>drugs</b> and benznidazole. For this, 142 Swiss mice chronically infected with the 21 SF strain of T. cruzi and 72 normal Swiss mice were used.
