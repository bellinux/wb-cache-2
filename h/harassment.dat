40|$|Sexual <b>harassments</b> {{in schools}} have been {{identified}} as one of the factors preventing girls from attending education. Moreover, both female and male students who attend education and witness male teachers harassing female students may perpetuate this behaviour. In Mozambique, research addressing sexual abuse and <b>harassments</b> in school focus on the fact that decrees and policies on zero-tolerance against sexual abuse are not followed up properly. There is little research addressing how students perceive the issue, and even less on male students’ understanding of the phenomenon in relations to female students’ understanding. This study took place at two schools in Maputo, Mozambique, and examines what approach students in secondary school and university, as well as adults working around these students have upon sexual <b>harassments</b> and abuse in school. Furthermore, officials and informants at NGOs addressing gender issues and sexual <b>harassments</b> in schools were interviewed. The purpose was to find out how the informants described the phenomenon, what they believed were the reasons behind it and how they thought it could be prevented. The result has been analysed through a gender and power analysis. The study uses the social constructionist theory of gender, recognising that gender is constructed through interaction and expectations of people (Francis & Skelton 2005 : 28), and Collen’s (1996) theory of hegemonic masculinity, which explains how the patriarchy is legitimised. Further, in order to analyse the result, Allen’s (1998) theories of power-over, power-to and power-with as well as Lukes’ (2005) theories of different dimensions of power have been used. The informants described sexual <b>harassments</b> as occurring between male teachers and female students at the schools. However, there was a discrepancy between the male and the female students’ perception of whether it is the male teacher or the female student who is the harasser. Despite this, the informants agreed on sexual <b>harassments</b> occurring between female teachers and male students being rare. The explanations to why it occurs range from the patriarchal structures, myths claiming that an older man is given good luck if having sex with a virgin, the female students’ fear of failing in school if not saying yes to the teacher, her interest in getting material benefits and her lack of interest in studying, to the male teacher’s lack of ability to control himself sexually. The different explanations were given depending on how the informant described the phenomenon. This also led to different conclusions to what should be done {{to come to an end}} to sexual <b>harassments.</b> An issue brought up was the difficulties to report <b>harassments</b> and the lack of punishment towards the teachers. Further, some believed that the female students should be subjected to awareness raising in order to dress properly and focus on the studies. While the risk of the male students perpetuating the behaviour of male teachers harassing female students is prevalent, the female students interviewed have the power to say no to the teachers, but not the power-to report. There are a number of organisations addressing the issue in different ways and there are regulations on how to report. However, in order to work holistically with the issue, the male students have to be included in the work and the organisations have to co-ordinate their measures in order to find a solution to the problem. ...|$|R

40|$|Sweden {{has been}} criticized from the United Nations {{as well as from}} the European Union for not putting enough effort into {{discouraging}} ethnic discrimination on the labour market. At the same time discrimination can be problematic while it’s a personal experience that is to be judged by criterions of the law. This seems to be a particular problem in cases of <b>harassments.</b> The purpose of this study is therefore to examine the national labour law of ethnic discrimination in terms of <b>harassments</b> due to ethnicity. Aiming at creating a more interesting study, the Critical race theory is used to analyze legal judgements from the labour court. By using the legal dogmatic method relevant laws, prepatory works and legal judgements are carefully analyzed in order to answer the research questions of the essay. The results of the study points out a special problem when work places are influenced by a rough jargon. This while the consequences are that harassed workers seems to get problems explaining their feelings of being insulted. A rough jargon also makes it harder for both employers and employees who insults others to get awareness and insight about occurrence of eventual <b>harassments.</b> The Swedish labour court tend to judge cases of <b>harassments</b> due to ethnicity restrictive, which results in an inability to respect the exposed employee’s experience. The way of using the burden of proof in these cases is also shown to be handled in a classic way by the labour court. The restrictive judgements and the way of using the burden of proof can be criticized, especially from a critical race point of view, since the consequence is a difficulty for ethnic discriminated employees to win approval in the labour court. Taken together it appears as the Swedish labour court is a part of the structural ethnic discrimination in the working life of Sweden...|$|R
