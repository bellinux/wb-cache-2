Growth is assessed from project start to launch, {{from the time of the}} preliminary design review (PDR) to launch and from the time of the critical design review (CDR) to launch. Data is also assessed not just at the spacecraft bus level, but also at the subsystem level wherever possible, to help obtain further insight into possible drivers of growth. Potential recommendations to minimize spacecraft mass, power, cost, and schedule growth for future missions are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|A uranium deposit {{discovered}} in 1977 in western Alaska, {{by means of}} airborne radiomet-ric data, is the largest known in Alaska {{on the basis of}} <b>industry</b> <b>reserve</b> estimates. At about latitude 65 ø N, it is the most northerly known sandstone-type uranium deposit in the world. The deposit lies in Eocene continental sandstone near the eastern end of the Seward Penin-sula, in the southern end of a graben that extends northward into the Death Valley deposi-tional basin. The deposit is apparently of epigenetic and supergene origin. The uranium was derived from the Cretaceous granite of the Darby pluton that forms part of the western side of Death Valley. Uranium from primary mineralization is in the subsurface in a marginal facies of the Tertiary sedimentary basin where nearshore coarse clastic rocks are interbedded with coal and lacustrine clay. Primary mineralization occurred when uranium-bearing oxidizing ground water moved downdip from the pluton eastward through transmissive clastic beds or on the surface. Uranium was deposited where the coal or other carbonaceous material produced a reducing environment in arkosic host rocks. The supergene enrichment is related to a soil horizon at the present ground surface. The most common uranium mineral is meta-autunite, but cofflnite has been identified in the primary deposits. The host rocks for the primary deposits were partly covered by basalt flows that issued from nearby vents. Some of the basalt is highly altered, and some basalt float from the supergene zone has alteration rinds that are enriched in uranium. Extensive exploratory drilling took place from 1979 to 1981. The average grade of the potential ore is 0. 27 percent U 308 and the average thickness is 3 m. The calculated reserves are 1, 000, 000 lbs U 3 Os; additional drilling would probably add to this figure...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{applies the}} partial {{adjustment}} model {{to examine the}} structural change {{for the impact of}} the tax imputation in 1998 on the changes in capital structure of the listed firms in the electronic industries over the last four business cycles in Taiwan. Same as prior studies, this paper found some common determinants of capital structure such as firm size, profitability, non-debt tax shields and asset structure at the firm level. This paper also found structural changes between the periods before and after the tax imputation for the effects of firm size, growth opportunities and asset structure on the determination of capital structure. In addition, the speed of the actual changes in capital structure is slower and the gap between actual and optimal capital structure is greater during the sample years after tax imputation than those before tax imputation. This implies that firms in the electronic <b>industries</b> <b>reserve</b> more debt borrowing capacity due to the tax imputation. Moreover, macroeconomic conditions do not {{have an impact on the}} determination of capital structure. Besides, there is no structural change between the periods before and after the tax imputation for the impact of macroeconomic condition...|$|R

40|$|Abstract It is {{well-known}} that the carried reserve {{adequacy of the}} property & casualty {{industry as a whole}} varies across the market cycle. We examine the extent to which this variation results from actuarial methods themselves, concluding that about half of the industry’s historical deficiencies and redundancies have resulted from actuarial methods. The deficiencies and redundancies that result from actuarial methods appear to be highly correlated with the economic cycle. At the same time, there is also a strong relationship between the underwriting cycle and carried reserve adequacy. Implications for uncertainty in the <b>industry’s</b> aggregate <b>reserve</b> adequacy as well as for individual companies are considered...|$|R
