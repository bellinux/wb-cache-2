40|$|Abstract- An atomic force {{microscope}} (AFM) {{has been}} utilized to implement various manipulations with nanometer precision. Unfortunately, an AFM-based nanomanipulation sys tem often meets the problem of low reliability and low efficiency, mainly due {{to the difficulty of}} positioning the AFM tip near the sample. In this study, a positioning control strategy is designed to accurately drive the probe to implement nanomanipulation tasks. Specifically, for an AFM piezo-scanner, a novel con trol strategy consisting of the following three algorithms are proposed to alleviate positioning error caused by such factors as piezo-hysteresis, cross-coupling and other uncertainties: (a) an image-based hysteresis compensation algorithm, which first obtains the voltage-displacement relationship of the hysteresis for the AFM piezo-scanner by analyzing some collected images for a calibration grating, and then utilizes this relationship to compute suitable control inputs to compensate for the position ing error caused by hysteresis nonlinearity; (b) a landmark based positioning algorithm addressing cross-coupling effect, which <b>first</b> <b>indents</b> the sample to make regular landmarks by a series of control voltages, based on which a polynomial curve fitting method is then utilized to calculate proper inputs so that cross-coupling effect can be compensated efficiently; (c) a local scannning-based compensator, which addresses the positioning error caused by thermal drift or other uncertainties within the nanomanipulation system successfully.

40|$|Finally {{this work}} studied {{the effect of}} surface {{adhesion}} on the mechanical behavior of two soft materials (two kinds of biological cells) subjected to atomic force microscope (AFM) indentation, i. e. pancreatic MIN 6 cell and hepatocellular carcinoma which were treated by calcimimetic R 568 and fullerenol respectively. They were also indented by different AFM probes: MIN 6 cell by spherical indenter, and cancer cell by Vickers <b>indenter.</b> <b>First</b> of all, surface adhesion was manifested by the negative value of indentation force. For MIN 6 cells，both JKR and finite element method are used to fit the force-displacement curve obtained by AFM indentation. For hepatocellular carcinoma, the JKR model is adapted for the Vickers indenter, and the “adapted” JKR model is used to fit the force-displacement curve. The results showed that JKR model can best describe the unloading force-displacement behaviors of the indentation curves, where a new parameter, termed work of adhesion in addition to Young’s modulus was extracted. Moreover, the difference between two biological cells and their treated counterparts were detected {{in terms of the}} magnitudes of the extracted parameters, i. e. Young’s modulus and work of adhesion. This implies that the study on the surface adhesion has potential significance in terms of medical diagnostics. The main contributions from the present research could be summarized as follows: i. 	For hard materials, this study presents a systematic investigation on the effect of surface adhesion on the shakedown behavior of two hardening materials, i. e. isotropic and kinematic hardening. The simulative results show that surface adhesion alone can initiate plastic deformation. In non-adhesive repeated contact, only elastic shakedown can occur while in adhesive repeated contact, plastic shakedown can occur, which indicate that surface adhesion force can alter the mechanical response of substrate material subjected to repetitive indentation. ii. 	For soft materials, this work uses JKR model to fit the force-displacement curve, yielding a new parameter, i. e. work of adhesion, in addition to Young’s modulus. In comparison to the Hertzian contact model, the JKR model provides obviously better fitting to the experimental results, indicating that the adhesion is significant in the cell interaction. Moreover, the difference between various biological cells could be characterized by the magnitude of work of adhesion, which implies that this parameter may also serve medical diagnostics. ...|$|R
40|$|This work compiles {{the results}} of the {{analysis}} of hydrographical data collected in January 2008 over the western sector of the South Scotia Ridge (SSR). The cruise was carried out on board R/V Hespérides in the framework of the Synoptic Antarctic Shelf-Slope Interaction (SASSI) study, one of the core projects endorsed by the International Polar Year. SASSI focused on shelf-slope processes taking place all along the Antarctic continental slope, paying particular attention to the Antarctic Slope Front (ASF) and its associated westward Antarctic Slope Current (ASC). The Spanish contribution to SASSI (framed by the E-SASSI project) focused on the SSR region between the South Shetland Islands and the South Orkney Islands, bounded to the north by the Scotia Sea and to the south by the Weddell Sea. The main objectives of E-SASSI were (1) to quantify the outflow of Weddell Sea waters into the Scotia Sea and to determine how these waters contribute to the modification of the Southern Boundary (SB) of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC); (2) to determine the role of the Antarctic Slope Front in these processes; and (3) to track the path of the Antarctic Slope Current before diluting into the Scotia Sea. This thesis aims to answer these questions. The sector of the SSR located between the South Shetland Islands and the South Orkney Islands is a region of especial interest. First because the gaps indenting the ridge constitute the first gate for the outflow of relatively shallow, recently ventilated waters from the northwestern Weddell Sea into the Scotia Sea. Second, because of the complexity of the bathymetry: a deep trough (the Hesperides Trough) separates the northern and southern flanks of the ridge and the location and depth of the different gaps indenting the ridge constrain the pathway of the Antarctic Slope Current. A key feature of the E-SASSI cruise with respect to previous studies conducted in the region is the unprecedented high spatial resolution of the hydrographic survey, particularly over the continental slopes. Also the coverage of all the gaps of the northern flank of the ridge was a novelty of E-SASSI. Both features have allowed a better quantification of the water mass transports in the region. The E-SASSI physical data consist mainly of Conductivity-Temperature-Depth (CTD) and ship-mounted Acoustic Doppler Currentmeter Profiler (ADCP) measurements. The presence of narrow jets, the rough topography, the strong tidal currents observed in theregion, and the fact that velocity measurements were available only for the upper 500 meters of the water column, they all handicapped the determination of the barotropic component of the flow. Inverse modeling based on the conservation of volume, heat, and salt over an enclosed region was used to refine the barotropic component of the velocity pattern initially estimated from the adjustment of the baroclinic component of velocity profiles to the ADCP measurements. The regional circulation, including the pathway of the Antarctic Slope Current, was inferred from the joint analysis of CTD profiles and the velocity field inferred from the inverse model. Results from a cross-slope section located in the Weddell Sea side show the well-defined structure of the Antarctic Slope Front before reaching the SSR. At the <b>firsts</b> gaps <b>indenting</b> the southern flank of the SSR the ASC has been observed to break into two branches: an inshore branch following the upper levels of the slope (700 m) and an offshore branch extending over the 1600 m isobath. At the northern flank the sampling covered all the gaps of the ridge and several cross-slope sections into the Scotia Sea. The inshore branch of the ASC was detected crossing a relatively shallow gap that prevents the outflow of the offshore, deeper branch and acts as a barrier for Weddell Sea Deep Water (WSDW). In spite of the higher velocities of the outflow, this shallow gap is less important in terms of Warm Deep Water (WDW) transport than the deeper Hesperides Passage hosting the outflow of the deeper branch of the ASC. This passage accounts for most of the outflow of Weddell Sea waters into the Scotia Sea and is the only gate of WSDW through the western sector of the SSR. The transports inferred from the inverse model give a net outflow of 7 ± 5 Sv, 2 Sv corresponding to WSDW and most of the other 5 Sv being WDW. In addition to the determination of the circulation pattern we have also analyzed inflow/outflow θS diagrams. They show an overall homogenization of the outflowing waters with respect to the more variable incoming Weddell Sea waters. In the last part of this thesis we show that isopycnal mixing between inshore and offshore water masses taking place within the Hesperides Trough is the main process for the modification of subsurface and intermediate layers. We also describe the role of the ASF {{in the formation of the}} most modified WDW observed before reaching the SSR and study the contribution of this water to the modification of the Southern Boundary of the ACC, in the southwestern sector of the Scotia Sea. Aquest treball reuneix els resultats de l’anàlisi de dades hidrogràfiques preses el gener de 2008 durant una campanya oceanogràfica a la Dorsal d’Escòcia del Sud (Antàrtida). La campanya es va dur a terme a bord del R/V Hespérides en el marc del projecte SASSI (Synoptic Antarctic Shelf-Slope Interaction study), un dels projectes clau de l’Any Polar International. Aquest projecte va tenir com a objectiu l’estudi de processos entre la plataforma i el talús continental antàrtics, amb una especial atenció al Front de Talús Antártic i al seu corrent associat que flueix en sentit oest, el Corrent de Talús Antàrtic. La contribució espanyola a SASSI (el projecte E-SASSI) es va centrar en el sector oest de la Dorsal d’Escòcia del Sud, entre les illes Shetland del Sud i Orcades del Sud, flanquejat al nord pel Mar d’Escòcia i al sud pel Mar de Weddell. Els objectius principals d’E-SASSI eren: (1) quantificar l’exportació d’aigües del Mar de Weddell cap al Mar d’Escòcia i determinar com aquestes aigües contribueixen a la modificació de la Frontera Sud del Corrent Circumpolar Antàrtic; (2) determinar el paper que juga el Front de Talús en tots aquests processos; i (3) traçar el camí que recorr el Corrent de Talús abans de diluir-se en el Mar d’Escòcia. Aquesta tesi tracta de respondre totes aquestes qüestions. El sector oest de la dorsal és d’especial interés. Primer perquè els passos que s’obren al llarg de la dorsal constitueixen la primera porta de sortida cap al Mar d’Escòcia d’aigües relativament poc fondes i recentment ventilades que flueixen al llarg del marge nordoest del Mar de Weddell. Segon, degut a la complexitat de la batimetria: la localització i fondària d’aquests passos, a més de l’existència d’una fossa submarina que separa aquesta banda de la dorsal en un flanc nord i un flanc sud (la Fossa d’Hespèrides), són tots factors que afecten al pas del Corrent de Talús per sobre de la dorsal. Els punts claus de la campanya E-SASSI respecte d’estudis precedents duïts a terme en aquesta regió són, d’una banda, l’elevada resolució espacial del mostreig hidrogràfic, sobretot al talús continental, i d’altra, la cobertura del mostreig, que abastà tots els passos del flanc nord de la dorsal. Ambdós aspectes han estat una aportació fonamental per part d’E-SASSI, per quan han permès una millor quantificació dels transports d’aigües en aquesta regió. El conjunt de dades físiques d’E-SASSI són majoritàriament dades de conductivitat, temperatura i pressió (Conductivity-Temperature-Depth, CTD) i de velocitat (Acoustic Doppler Currentmeter Profiler, ADCP). La presència de corrents prims, lo abrupt de la batimetria, els forts corrents de marea observats a la regió, i el fet de disposar de mesures directes de la velocitat només en els primers 500 metres de la columna d’aigua, tot plegat fa que la determinació del component baròtrop del fluxe sigui complicada. La modelització inversa és una tècnica que es basa en la conservació de volum, calor i sal a una regió de perímetre tancat. Aquest tècnica s’ha emprat per refinar el component baròtrop del patró inicial de velocitat obtingut a partir de l’ajust del component baroclí a dades d’ADCP. La circulació regional, i en particular el traçat del Corrent de Talús, s’ha obtingut a partir de l’anàlisi conjunt de les dades de CTD i del camp de velocitats donat pel model. Quan als resultats, una secció hidrogràfica d’E-SASSI mostra el Front de Talús perfectament estructurat just abans d’arribar al flanc sud de la dorsal. És al primer pas d’aquest flanc on el Corrent de Talús se separa en dues branques: una interior que flueix a la part alta del talús (700 m) i una de més externa que segueix la isobata de 1600 m. Al flanc nord el mostreig va cobrir tots els passos i diverses seccions que travessen el talús cap a dintre del Mar d’Escòcia. La branca interna del Corrent de Talús es va detectar creuant un pas relativament poc profund, que per altra banda no només evita la sortida de la branca més externa sinó també la de Weddell Sea Deep Water (WSDW). Tot i les intenses velocitats del fluxe de sortida, aquest pas no és tan important com el Pas d’Hespèrides pel que fa a exportació de Warm Deep Water (WDW). Aquest pas no només permet la sortida de la branca externa del Corrent de Talús, sinó que és l’única porta de sortida de WSDW a la banda oest de la Dorsal d’Escòcia del Sud. Els transports obtinguts pel model invers han donat un fluxe net de sortida de 7 ± 5 Sv, dels quals 2 Sv són WSDW i gran part dels 5 Sv restants corresponen a WDW. A més de la determinació de la circulació regional hem comparat les característiques d’entrada i sortida de les aigües a sobre de diagrames θS. L’anàlisi ha mostrat una homogeneïtzació de les aigües del Mar de Weddell quan travessen la dorsal. Hem mostrat que això és degut a processos de mescla isopicna a la Fossa d’Hespèrides pel que fa a la modificació de les capes subsuperficial i intermèdia. També hem descrit al darrer punt de la tesi el paper que juga el Front de Talús en la formació de la forma més modificada de WDW observada abans d’entrar a la dorsal i la seva contribució en la modificació de la Frontera Sud del ACC al sudoest del Mar d’Escòcia...|$|R
