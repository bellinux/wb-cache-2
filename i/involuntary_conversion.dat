50|$|In addition, section 1231(a)(4)(C) {{contains}} a special rule {{for the purposes}} of determining whether a § 1231 gain or § 1231 loss enters the hotchpot. This subsection states that if recognized losses from an <b>involuntary</b> <b>conversion</b> as a result of casualty or from theft, of any property used in the trade or business or of any capital asset held for more than one year, exceed the recognized gains from an <b>involuntary</b> <b>conversion</b> of any such property as a result of casualty or from theft, such losses and gains do not enter the hotchpot. Thus, section 1231 does not apply to gains and losses resulting from casualties and thefts if the losses exceed the gains. The practical effect of this subsection is that net losses from such involuntary conversions will be treated as ordinary income (abolished by s1(2) Law Reform (Succession) Act 1995 in intestacy cases from 1 January 1996).|$|E

40|$|Recent {{reviews of}} two fact situations, {{hundreds}} of miles apart and both the products of planning a half century or more ago, illustrate the hazards of using a deceptively simple estate plan – basing the plan on successive life estates. 1 The strategy often involves unexpected federal estate tax consequences, 2 federal gift tax problems, 3 income tax basis complications 4 and assorted problems relating to like-kind exchanges, <b>involuntary</b> <b>conversions</b> and easements, to mention {{just a few of}} the more likely events occurring during the term of the life estates. Although often viewed as more complex (and costly to set up), a carefully drafted trust generally provides a more satisfactory platform for intergenerational transfers than successive life estates...|$|R
40|$|Almost {{from the}} {{beginning}} of the federal income tax, the law has contained two nonrecognition provisions that have undergone relatively little change: the like kind rule and the <b>involuntary</b> <b>conversion</b> rule. Commentators have questioned the policy grounds for the like kind rule in general, and for some of its particular features, such as the exchange requirement. Congress and its staffers have also noted the complexity caused by certain aspects of the rule and have enacted or proposed remedial changes in this regard. The <b>involuntary</b> <b>conversion</b> rule also contributes to the complexity of the tax system given the fact-intensive analysis that it requires. Perhaps more fundamentally, the two nonrecognition rules generally use different standards for determining eligible replacement property, an apparent inconsistency that occasionally catches the attention of both Congress and commentators. This article seeks to improve the like kind and <b>involuntary</b> <b>conversion</b> rules, that is, make the provisions more rational and less complex, by analyzing them in light of the fundamental tax policies of efficiency, equity, and administrability. The product of this effort is a simpler, more rational and more unified approach for granting nonrecognition treatment to voluntary and involuntary dispositions of property. The article 2 ̆ 7 s recommendations include (i) the use of the like kind standard to determine eligible replacement property under both the like kind and <b>involuntary</b> <b>conversion</b> rules, along with narrowing the like kind standard for real property by employing a categorization approach modeled on the real property classifications used for depreciation purposes; (ii) the use of an express rollover mechanism under the like kind rule; and (iii) the use of a single, rather than bifurcated, period for replacing assets under the like kind rule...|$|E
40|$|The {{basics of}} <b>involuntary</b> <b>conversion</b> {{are well known}} – if {{eligible}} property is involuntarily converted (e. g., by fire or other casualty, theft or condemnation), to the extent the converted property is replaced with property “similar or related in service or use” 1 within the designated period 2 no gain is recognized. 3 For real property taken by condemnation or threat or imminence of condemnation, the property only needs to be of a “like-kind” to the converted property if held for productive use in a trade or business or for investment. 4 If those conditions are met, like-kind property is treated as property similar or related in service or use. ...|$|E
40|$|Conversion " or "Repudiation '': Modalities of Christians ' Ambiguous Affiliation with Islam in the 16 th and 17 th Centuries. In the 16 th and 17 th centuries, tens of {{thousands}} of Europeans (and perhaps even more), converted to Islam after being captured on land or at sea, or because of a volontary decision, in short, either willingly or under duress. They became what Christians called "renegades". Extensive archival research on the Spanish, Portugese and Venitian Inquisitions (virtually exhaustive except in the case of Portugal), provided us with a sample of 1, 534 individuals, the majority of whom were children or adolescents. "Repudiation" or "conversion" could be documented in 905, i. e. 59 % of the cases. This article analyzes the words and gestures which manifested Islamic affiliation, as seen in the confessions made to inquisitors by renegades returning from theirstay in the Islamic world—whether willingly of under duress—after escaping or being captured by Christians, circumstances which require criticalprecautions. The richness of the documentation, however, allows one to decipher the meaning the renegades bestowed upon the words they pronounced, to distinguish between volontary and <b>involuntary</b> <b>conversion</b> (as the ceremony was carried out in different ways in the different cases), and to pose but also resolve the following paradox: many of those who involuntarily repudiated Islam later became tried and true fervent Muslims, while many others voluntarily returned to the creed of their fathers at the risk of their lives.

40|$|Professor Hansen {{reviews the}} {{development}} of copyright from its traditional domestic orientation to the modern emphasis on globalization and harmonization. His commentary analogizes modem trends in international copyright to religious equivalents. He notes that the current players include a 2 ̆ 2 secular priesthood 2 ̆ 2 (the traditional copyright bar and academics), 2 ̆ 2 agnostics and atheists 2 ̆ 2 (newer academics and lawyers, particularly those concerned with technology {{and the culture of}} the public domain) and 2 ̆ 2 missionaries 2 ̆ 2 (whose task it is to increase copyright protection around the world and who are primarily driven by trade considerations). The copyright 2 ̆ 2 crusade 2 ̆ 2 has been driven by this last group. The author compares the task of Increasing copyright protection In newly industrialized and developing countries to the conversion of any group to a new religion. The missionaries, primarily from the United States and the European Union, have the choice of seeking voluntary or <b>involuntary</b> <b>conversions.</b> He augurs that the prospects for voluntary conversion are slim and that coercion will continue to be used against newly industrialized and developing nations when copyright protection is at stake...|$|R
40|$|The motives {{behind an}} individual's {{conversion}} to another religion {{are complex and}} frequently contested. The moment of conversion for the convert symbolizes {{the beginning of a}} new life and new opportunities; yet for the community he or she leaves, it is often interpreted as an act of religious and political betrayal, therefore prompting different, and often opposing, narratives of conversion. A number of tropes predominant in early modern English narratives dealing with conversion to Islam are of interest in this regard: the immoral deviant “renegade” motivated by excessive lust or greed who is worse than the “natural Turks,” and the practice of violent, <b>involuntary,</b> forced <b>conversion.</b> These tropes, through their rhetorical construction of the renegade, attempt to fashion both individual and communal selves that act to relieve the psychological threat to the collective identity of the English community presented by the renegade's translocation of political, cultural and religious loyalties. It is therefore problematic to uncritically read these narratives as accurate depictions of the reality of conversion in North Africa as some previous studies have done: other contextual evidence and the use of alternative narrative frames portray converts and conversion from a significantly different perspective. In this article, primarily through the study of captivity narratives, I explore how and why these tropes of conversion were employed, the functions they fulfilled, and the contexts in which they were produced and consumed.
