40|$|Objectives: To {{assess the}} {{acceptability}} {{and quality of}} web-based videoconferencing telemedicine consultation platform {{in the treatment of}} opioid use disorder at TrueNorth Medical Centre. Methods: We conducted an interview based quality improvement initiative using an investigator-designed questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of 17 Agree/Disagree questions, measured on a 7 -point Likert scale and 2 questions where patients had the ability to elaborate qualitatively on their perceptions and experiences with their telemedicine service. Content-style analysis was performed on qualitative responses. Results: The majority of patients (n= 14; 47 %) preferred face-to-face over telemedicine consultations. The number of patients that preferred telemedicine consultations over <b>face-to-face</b> <b>consultations</b> was lower (n= 6; 20 %). A notable number of patients (n= 10; 33 %) indicated no specific preference for either telemedicine or <b>face-to-face</b> <b>consultations.</b> Patients preferring <b>face-to-face</b> <b>consultations</b> rated their clinical outcome and patient-physician relationship following telemedicine consultations similarly as those who preferred telemedicine consultations. Patients preferring telemedicine rated their experience and overall perceptions of the service significantly higher than those preferring <b>face-to-face</b> <b>consultations.</b> Patients who preferred telemedicine consultations identified the efficient and timesaving nature of telemedicine consultations as primary advantages whereas those preferring <b>face-to-face</b> <b>consultations</b> reported lower levels of empathy from their physician during telemedicine consultations as a major disadvantage. Conclusions: The majority of patients at TrueNorth Medical Centre viewed telemedicine consultations as an acceptable treatment modality.

40|$|Introduction Telephone {{consulting}} {{is increasingly}} {{used to improve}} access to care and optimise resources for day-time work. However, there remains a debate about how such consultations differ from <b>face-to-face</b> <b>consultations</b> in terms of content quality and/or safety. To investigate this, a comparison of family doctors' telephone and <b>face-to-face</b> <b>consultations</b> was conducted. Methods 106 audio-recordings (from 19 doctors in nine practices) of telephone and <b>face-to-face</b> <b>consultations,</b> stratified at doctor level, were compared using the Roter Interaction Analysis Scale (RIAS) (content measure), the OPTION (observing patient involvement in decision making scale) and a modified scale based on the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) consultation assessment instrument (measuring quality and safety). Patient satisfaction and enablement were measured using validated instruments. The Roter Interaction Analysis Scale scores were compared by multiple linear regression adjusting for covariates; other continuous measures by χ 2 and Student t tests and binary measures as odds ratios. Results Telephone consultations were shorter (4. 6 vs 9. 7  min, p< 0. 001), presented fewer problems (1. 2 vs 1. 8, p< 0. 001) and included less data gathering, counselling/advice and rapport building (all p< 0. 001) than <b>face-to-face</b> <b>consultations.</b> These differences remained significant when consultation length and number of problems were taken into account. Telephone consultations were judged less likely to include sufficient information to exclude important serious illnesses. Patient involvement and satisfaction outcomes were similar in both consultation types. Conclusion Although telephone consultations are convenient and judged satisfactory by patients and doctors, they may compromise patient safety more than <b>face-to-face</b> <b>consultations</b> and further research is required to elucidate this. Telephone consultations may be more suited to follow-up and management of long-term conditions than for in-hours acute management...|$|E

The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the preoperative evaluation (POE) through questionnaire responses with preanesthetic evaluation by the anesthesiologist. MethodPrior to their preoperative evaluation, patients answered a questionnaire with information regarding age, weight, height, scheduled surgery, past medical and surgical history, allergies, medications and doses used, social history (illicit drugs, alcohol, smoking), functional capacity and exercise tolerance. Preoperative evaluation was performed by an anesthesiologist who had no access to the questionnaire data or knowledge about the research. The questionnaire data were compared with the preoperative evaluation by two independent investigators, in order to answer the questions: 1) Was the questionnaire evaluation effective - could the patient undergo surgery without the need for <b>face-to-face</b> <b>consultation?</b> 2) Has been there any relevant information - ability to change the anesthetic approach - not assessed by the questionnaire, but assessed by the <b>face-to-face</b> <b>consultation?</b> 3) Has been there any information added by the health questionnaire that was missed by <b>face-to-face</b> <b>consultation?</b> For statistical analysis, the paired Student's t-test was used for parametric data and chi-square test for categorical data, with p 30, low functional capacity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, asthma, renal failure, hepatitis, and ischemic heart disease.

A cost-minimization analysis was undertaken to compare the actual costs of videoconference consultations with the potential costs of <b>face-to-face</b> <b>consultations</b> with the same specialists in Brisbane (i. e. patient travel) and the potential costs of <b>face-to-face</b> <b>consultations</b> in the regions (i. e. visiting psychiatrist).

The first option allows for personal attention, whereas a telephone consultation does not require travelling. We hypothesised that a telephone consultation would lead to higher response and participation in CRC screening compared with a <b>face-to-face</b> <b>consultation.</b> METHODS: A total of 6600 persons (50 – 75 years) were 1 : 1 randomised for primary colonoscopy screening with a pre-colonoscopy <b>consultation</b> either <b>face-to-face</b> or by telephone. In both arms, we counted the number of invitees who attended a pre-colonoscopy consultation (response) {{and the number of}} those who subsequently attended colonoscopy (participation), relative to the number invited for screening.

40|$|AIM To {{develop and}} {{validate}} {{a method of}} measuring elements ofthe process of telephone consultations in primary care. BACKGROUND There is an unrecognised confusion about telephone consultations in healthcare. There is virtually no research that has considered the difference between consulting on the telephone and consulting face-to-face. Work on <b>face-to-face</b> <b>consultations</b> points the way forward, suggesting {{the need to develop}} a tool to measure process in telephone consultations. METHODS Qualitative approaches were used: a narrative analysis ofextant instruments for <b>face-to-face</b> <b>consultations</b> and Discourse Analysis for the telephone consultations. Using this combined knowledge, a new instrument was designed. Brief reliability testing was undertaken. RESULTS There were no instruments for face-to-face consulting that were sufficient for use with telephone consultations. Several important features were identified that informed design of a new instrument. Discourse Analysis of the 43 telephone consultations from primary care, revealed newly described elements of linguistic structure: 'Advise' and 'Request' exchanges and highlighting structure in narrative passages. From this the Instrument for Measurement of Telephone Process (IMoTeP) was developed. Argument was made for its construct and face validity. Reliability testing was limited to two people with eight consultations. This highlighted promising perfonnance, though there is need for further testing. CONCLUSION It has proved possible to develop an instrument to measure process in telephone consultations based on sound theory and real life observations. Further work should consolidate the reliability and validity while also looking for attributes oftelephone consultations that lead to positive outcomes.
