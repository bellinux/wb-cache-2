5|$|Leonard's Bakery is a Portuguese bakery in Honolulu, Hawaii, {{known for}} popularizing the malasada.

Leonard's is a household name in Hawaii and is well known <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>continental</b> <b>United</b> States and internationally. A franchise location opened in Japan in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{there being}} 20 named systems, five above the average, only four storms {{directly}} affected land. Hurricane Eugene {{was the first}} Pacific hurricane to make landfall in Mexico in July since the 1954 season and caused all of the season's three deaths and $142.12 million damage. Tropical Storm Pilar and Hurricane Norma also came close to land, with the former producing record rain in Baja California Sur. The remnants of Hurricanes Ramon and Norma caused rain <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Continental</b> <b>United</b> States. Elsewhere, Peke was a central north Pacific hurricane that crossed the International Dateline and became a typhoon of the 1987 Pacific typhoon season.|$|E
5|$|The 1939 California {{tropical}} storm, {{also called}} the 1939 Long Beach tropical storm, El Cordonazo, The Lash of St. Francis was a tropical cyclone that hit Southern California in September, 1939.

The only other known tropical cyclone to directly affect California is the 1858 San Diego hurricane, and only three other eastern Pacific tropical cyclones have caused gale-force winds <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>continental</b> <b>United</b> States. The tropical storm caused heavy flooding, leaving many dead, mostly at sea.|$|E

5|$|Historical records {{indicate}} river otters were once populous throughout most major drainages <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>continental</b> <b>United</b> States and Canada prior to European settlement. North America’s largest otter populations {{were found in}} areas with an abundance and diversity of aquatic habitats, such as coastal marshes, the Great Lakes region, and glaciated areas of New England. In addition, riverine habitats in interior regions supported smaller, but practical, otter populations. The otter existed on {{all parts of the}} Pacific Coast, including the seashore and inland streams and lakes. However, large populations never occurred in areas of Southern California such as the chaparral and oak woodlands and Mojave Desert seasonal waterway regions, or in the xeric shrubland regions in New Mexico, Texas, Nevada, and Colorado. In Mexico, the otters lived in the Rio Grande and Colorado River Deltas.|$|E
5|$|The SPARS were {{assigned}} to every USCG district except Puerto Rico, and served in Hawaii and Alaska as well. Most officers held general duty billets, which included administrative and supervisory assignments. Other officers served as communication officers, supply officers, barracks, and recruiting officers. The bulk of the enlisted women performed clerical and stenographic duties. In smaller numbers, the enlisted personnel were found in practically every other billet, from baking pies to rigging parachutes and driving jeeps. A select group of SPAR officers and enlisted personnel were also assigned {{to work with the}} Long Range Aid to Navigation at monitoring stations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Continental</b> <b>United</b> States. Better known under the acronym LORAN, it was a top-secret radio navigation system developed for ships at sea and long-range aircraft. The first monitoring station staffed by SPARS was at Chatham, Massachusetts. Chatham {{is believed to have been}} (at the time) the only all female-staffed station of its kind in the world. The SPARS peak strength was approximately 11,000 officers and enlisted personnel. Commodore J. A. Hirschfield, USCG, said the SPARS volunteered for duty when their country needed them, and they did their jobs with enthusiasm, efficiency, and with a minimum of fanfare. To honor the SPARS, two USCG cutters were given their name.|$|E

40|$|Downscaled {{rainfall}} projections from 21 {{climate models}} from the CMIP 5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5) archive {{are used to}} estimate future changes in rainfall erosivity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>continental</b> <b>Unites</b> States. To estimate erosivity from rainfall <b>in</b> <b>the</b> absence of sub-hourly data, we have used both daily rainfall values and the modified Fournier index – {{which is based on}} monthly rainfall accumulation – and derived the scaling relationship between rainfall and erosivity from observational estimates of both. The expectation of overall increase in erosivity is confirmed by these calculations, but a quantitative assessment is marred by large uncertainties. Specifically, <b>the</b> uncertainty <b>in</b> <b>the</b> method of estimation of erosivity is more consequential than that deriving from <b>the</b> spread <b>in</b> climate simulations and leads to changes of uncertain sign <b>in</b> parts of <b>the</b> southwest and Texas. We suggest that progress can be made by establishing a more reliable functional relationship between daily rainfall and erosivity...|$|R
