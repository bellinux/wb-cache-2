When he joined Equity he used Jonathan Pryce as his stage name because Equity will only have one actor with any particular name on <b>its</b> <b>books.</b> While at RADA Pryce worked as a door-to-door salesman of velvet paintings. Pryce {{was part of a}} 'new wave' of actors to emerge from the Academy. Others included Bruce Payne, Juliet Stevenson, Alan Rickman, Anton Lesser, Kenneth Branagh and Fiona Shaw.|$|E
5|$|The {{credibility}} of Miami-Dade Transit and the County as a whole, including {{the validity of}} their ridership estimates and revenue forecasts, {{has been a significant}} impediment to their qualifications for funding under the Federal Transit Administration's (FTA) approval. In 2011, Miami-Dade Transit underwent a serious federal investigation and takeover by the FTA in which it was forced to open <b>its</b> <b>books</b> over suspicions of money mismanagement. The Agency threatened to cease its funding used to cover operational costs, which would have meant significant cuts in service; however, they took the funding under their strict control to prevent this from happening.|$|E
5|$|At the Fiscal Court's January 1910 meeting, Barkley {{laid out}} an agenda {{to reduce the}} county's debt, improve its roads, and audit <b>its</b> <b>books</b> annually. Despite the Republican {{majority}} on the Court, most of the measures he proposed during his term were adopted. He appointed a purchasing agent and an inspector of weights and measures for the county and allocated a salary for the county's almshouse keeper instead of relying on fees to fund the position. He replaced the corvée system – wherein residents either paid a tax or donated labor to build and repair county roads – with private contracts. The widening and gravelling of county roads provided rural residents access to Paducah's amenities but reduced funds for programs like free textbooks for indigents and prevented Barkley from reducing the county's debt as planned. When he named his father as the county's juvenile court probation officer, opponents charged him with nepotism.|$|E
