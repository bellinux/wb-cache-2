40|$|The design {{equation}} for {{an auger}} to provide uniform unloading of particulate material from a container with a rectangular cross-section (Jones and Kocher, 1995) was revised {{to account for}} the minimum <b>flighting</b> <b>height</b> that could effectively unload particles with a known average smallest diameter. A minimum <b>flighting</b> <b>height</b> that was about 64 % of the average smallest diameter of the particles was experimentally determined to obtain mean slopes of the top surface of the material not significantly different from zero for screened soybeans. A linear taper that best fit the square root curve for the inside diameter of the auger was determined by minimizing the integral of the squared area differences between the linear taper and the square root curve. The maximum difference between the auger radii as determined with the square root curve and linear taper functions was less than 0. 3 mm, significantly less than the 4. 7 mm average smallest particle diameter for the screened soybeans used. An auger constructed following this design (linear tapered inside diameter with a minimum <b>flighting</b> <b>height)</b> provided uniform unloading of particulate material from a container with a rectangular cross-section, as evidenced by mean slopes of the top surface of the material being maintained not significantly different from zero, until the top surface dropped to within 30 cm of the top of the auger flighting...|$|R

50|$|Surveying {{instruments}} have {{characteristics that}} make them suitable for certain uses. Theodolites and levels are often used by constructors rather than surveyors in first world countries. The constructor can perform simple survey tasks using a relatively cheap instrument. Total stations are workhorses for many professional surveyors because they are versatile and reliable in all conditions. The productivity improvements from a GPS on large scale surveys makes them popular for major infrastructure or data gathering projects. One-person robotic-guided total stations allow surveyors to measure without extra workers to aim the telescope or record data. A fast but expensive way to measure large areas is with a helicopter, using a GPS to record {{the location of the}} helicopter and a laser scanner to measure the ground. To increase precision, surveyors place beacons on the ground (about 20 km apart). This method reaches precisions between 5-40 cm (depending on <b>flight</b> <b>height).</b>|$|E

The risk of seabirds colliding with offshore wind turbines {{is influenced by}} <b>flight</b> <b>height,</b> and <b>flight</b> <b>height</b> data usually come from observers on boats, making estimates in daylight in fine weather. GPS tracking provides an alternative and generates <b>flight</b> <b>height</b> information {{in a range of}} conditions, but the raw data have associated error. * Here, we present a novel analytical solution for accommodating GPS error. We use Bayesian state-space models to describe the <b>flight</b> <b>height</b> distributions and the error in altitude measured by GPS for lesser black-backed gulls and great skuas, tracked throughout the breeding season. We also examine how location and light levels influence <b>flight</b> <b>height.</b> * Lesser black-backed gulls flew lower by night than by day, indicating that this species {{would be less likely to}} encounter turbine blades at night, when birds’ ability to detect and avoid them might be reduced. Gulls flew highest over land and lowest near the coast. For great skuas, no significant relationships were found between <b>flight</b> <b>height,</b> time of day and location. * We consider four ‘collision risk windows’, corresponding to the airspace swept by rotor blades for different offshore wind turbine designs. We found the highest proportion of birds at risk for a 22 – 250 m turbine (up to 9 % for great skuas and 34 % for lesser black-backed gulls) and the lowest for a 30 – 258 m turbine. Our results suggest lesser black-backed gulls are at greater risk of collision than great skuas, especially by day. * Synthesis and applications. Our novel modelling approach is an effective way of resolving the error associated with GPS tracking data. We demonstrate its use on GPS measurements of altitude, generating important information on how breeding seabirds use their environment. This approach and the associated data also provide information to improve avian collision risk assessments for offshore wind farms. Our modelling approach could be applied to other GPS data sets to help manage the ecological needs of seabirds and other species at a time when the pressures on the marine environment are growing...|$|E

Wind energy is leaving a significant negative impact on wildlife through collision of birds and bats with operating wind turbines. Raptors are one of the many species exposed to this threat. Golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) is a long-lived raptor with slow reproduction rate. The species is listed as Near Threatened in Sweden and faces several threats, such as illegal persecution and collisions with trains and wind turbines. Knowledge of movement ecology and flight behaviour of Golden eagles is therefore essential for a successful management and conservation of the species, if we are to identify the causes of collisions and the spatio-temporal distribution of threats. Topography, wind, habitats and elevation have been suggested to impact on flight behavior for Golden eagles. I studied the movement ecology of Golden eagles by using data from 31 GPS transmitter equipped Golden eagles. Topographic and life history variables were used to explain the patterns of <b>flight</b> <b>height</b> using Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs).
