50|$|The {{distinction}} between supervening and <b>initial</b> <b>impossibility</b> (which does not terminate the contract) {{is an important}} one and often confused: The performance must have become objectively impossible, even if at first it was perfectly doable.|$|E
50|$|Parties cannot create {{contractual}} obligations that {{are impossible to}} perform. The impossibility of performance must be objective or absolute: that is, for all practical intents and purposes, nobody {{should be able to}} render the performance. In the case of <b>initial</b> <b>impossibility,</b> the contractual obligation is void; in the case of supervening impossibility, performance becomes impossible after conclusion of the contract. The obligation then terminates. Where a party makes performance impossible, however, the obligation does not terminate: Such a party commits breach of contract.|$|E
40|$|Introduction {{grotesque}} " Real {{and apparent}} contradictions abound {{in discussions of}} the grotesque; it is an extremely flexible category ", as Geoffrey Galt Harpham reminds us (Harpham article 464). Whoever reads into the bulk of criticism attached to the grotesque will see instability as the first striking characteristic of a concept that Baudelaire called " this indefinable element of beauty […] that obscure and mysterious element " (Baudelaire 132). The purpose of this brief introduction is not to provide an exhaustive survey of the many nuances found in the exegesis of the grotesque, which would necessitate to foray deep into historical, architectural, aesthetic and literary approaches, but to sketch in the theories deemed essential to a correct assessment of the prominence and meaning of the grotesque in the European fiction of the 19 th century. The works of 20 th-century literary critics like Kayser, Bakhtin and Harpham (taken together perhaps) provide a reasonably clear insight into the fundamentally ambivalent concept. The grotesque was theorized in the 19 th century notably by Hugo, Ruskin and Baudelaire, who {{shed light on the}} significance of grotesque within Romanticism and Victorian realism. The grotesque famously borrows its name from the accident of the discovery around 1480 of the remains of Nero's Domus Aurea and its elaborate ornaments. Its meaning then gradually expanded from the designation of the decorative grotesque of the Renaissance to what may appear as a vague or all-inclusive category. Critics generally agree, however, on the central idea that the grotesque realizes the either harmonious or hair-raising, but always impossible, fusion of heterogeneous elements. The word has come more prosaically to designate an unexpected mixture of comic and horror or of comic and disgust. Laughter is central-distortion, even carried out to extremities, is not grotesque without laughter. " For an object to be grotesque, it must arouse three responses. Laughter and astonishment are two; either disgust or horror is the third " (Harpham article 463). Harpham's 1976 definition puts to the fore the essential idea that the grotesque originates in the subject of the gaze, that it isn't inherent in the grotesque object. This, Baudelaire had underlined as early as 1855 : " Indian and Chinese idols are unaware that they are ridiculous; it is in us, Christians, that their comicality resides. " (Baudelaire 142). And to grasp the impact of the viewer's feeling of estrangement, his (at least <b>initial)</b> <b>impossibility</b> {{to make sense of the}} grotesque image, one must also remember that the grotesque emerges in a realistic context: " [The grotesque] threat depends for its effectiveness on the efficacy of the everyday, the partial fulfilment of our usual expectations. We must be believers whose faith has been profoundly shaken but not destroyed; otherwise we lose that fear of life and become resigned to absurdity, fantasy, or death " (Harpham 462).

40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{the standards that}} determine the validity of contracts that are governed by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods of 1980 (CISG). While Article 4 (a) of the—CISG � the so-called ‘validity exception’—generally excludes {{the validity of the}} contract from the Convention's material scope, it does so incompletely by adding a ‘except as otherwise expressly provided in this Convention’ caveat. Against this background, the article sets out to develop a novel validity definition. According to this definition, provisions concerned with the ‘validity of the contract’ in the sense of Article 4 (a) of the CISG are legal limits to party autonomy. The article continues by applying this definition to various potential validity issues as discussed in case law and legal writings. In doing so, it distinguishes between validity issues clearly not covered by the CISG (as legal limits on what to sell, legal limits on who to sell to or to purchase from, and legal limits on how to sell) and validity issues clearly covered by the CISG, as the formal validity of contracts, the validity of open-price contracts and the effect of an <b>initial</b> objective <b>impossibility</b> of the agreed performance on the contract. Finally, the article discusses a more complicated group of borderline issues {{that may or may not}} be governed by the Sales Convention, as mistakes or misrepresentations by a contracting party, the effect of contract clauses limiting a party's rights under the contract, surprising contract clauses and the effect of legal prohibitions of interest...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Consider {{a system}} of {{multiple}} mobile robots in which each robot, at infinitely many unpredictable time instants, observes the positions of all the robots and moves to a new position determined by the given algorithm. The robots are anonymous {{in the sense that}} they all execute the same algorithm and they cannot be distinguished by their appearances. Initially they do not have a common x-y coordinate system. Such a system can be viewed as a distributed system of anonymous mobile processes in which the processes (i. e., robots) can “communicate ” with each other only by means of their moves. In this paper we investigate a number of formation problems of geometric patterns in the plane by the robots. Specifically, we present algorithms for converging the robots to a single point and moving the robots to a single point in finite steps. We also characterize the class of geometric patterns that the robots can form in terms of their <b>initial</b> configuration. Some <b>impossibility</b> results are also presented...|$|R
