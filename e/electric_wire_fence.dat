40|$|Conventional <b>fencing</b> methods V-mesh <b>wire,</b> {{square mesh}} wire and wood panels are {{compared}} to experimental methods - 15 wire hightensile <b>wire</b> fences; <b>electric</b> high-tensile <b>wire</b> <b>fences</b> of three designs; baited electric fences; hog panel fences; plastic mesh fences and visqueen wrapped haystacks. Total cost of materials, cost per ft. /yr. and comments concerning estimates of efficacy are discussed. The V-mesh wire, hog panel and plastic mesh fences {{all have a}} very high cost per ft. and cost per ft. /yr. rating and should probably not be used. High-tensile and square mesh <b>wire</b> <b>fences</b> are effective and cheaper alternatives. Modern high-tensile <b>wire</b> <b>electric</b> <b>fences</b> can be an effective alternatives in some situations. Results from tests using visqueen wrapped haystacks and baited electric fences are encouraging and more experimentation is needed.

40|$|The {{development}} of exclusion fencing has been extensive in Australia {{in attempts to}} reduce losses of crops and livestock to rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), dingos (Canis familiaris Var. dingo) and other species. Restrictions on other damage control methods have led to increased efforts in the United States to utilize such fences for protection of crops and livestock from dogs (Canis familiaris), coyotes (Canis latrans) and other species. Electric fences have occasionally been used to protect apiaries from black bears (Ursus americanus) and to protect some wildlife species from carnivores. Varied fence types include conventional net-wire or combinations of net and barbed <b>wire,</b> high voltage <b>electric</b> <b>wires</b> and conventional <b>fences</b> modified by addition of <b>electric</b> <b>wires.</b> <b>Fences</b> appear to be most useful and cost-effective on small open pastures with intensive production and appear to be least successful on large pastures with low production and high vegetative cover, which restricts removal of predators. Fences may be helpful in directing predator travel to areas where other control methods can be applied. Limitations {{on the use of}} exclusion fences include construction costs and the inability to exclude some predators or to remove them from fenced areas. Regulations related to protection of wild species such as pronghorn antelope (Antilocapra americana) may prohibit construction of effective exclusion fences, particularly on public lands. Difficulties and costs of fence maintenance are related to terrain, soil types, dense vegetation, fence damage by livestock and other animals, heavy snows, floodwaters and other causes. Predators gain access through damaged fences, malfunctioning electric fences, or by jumping over or digging under. Data indicate that where predators tend to be contained within such enclosures, fences may serve to increase losses to predation rather than to reduce them...|$|R

He befriends a boy his own age named Shmuel (Jack Scanlon). The pair's lack of knowledge on {{the true nature of}} the camp is revealed: Bruno thinks that the striped uniforms that Shmuel, Pavel, and the other prisoners wear are pyjamas and Shmuel believes his grandparents died from an illness during their journey to the camp. Bruno starts meeting Shmuel regularly, sneaking him food and playing board games with him. He eventually learns that Shmuel is a Jew and was brought to the camp with his father.|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of a new design of <b>electric</b> strained <b>wire</b> <b>fence</b> (CSL fence) for managing rabbits is currently being assessed in a two year trial. It is being compared with a commercially available electric netting fence (Flexinet fence) and also with farmers 2 ̆ 7 normal control methods. The study is taking place on commercial farms in Cornwall, England, where the fences are being erected to protect fields of cauliflower. The amount of rabbit damage to individual plants in each field is being assessed and the numbers of rabbits feeding in these fields are being counted. Plant yields at harvest will {{also be used to}} determine effectiveness. Observations of rabbit behavior at the CSL fence are being conducted to identify potential design problems and to assess solutions to these problems.

5000|$|Such {{brutality}} was not accidental. The SS guards {{would often}} force prisoners - exhausted from hours of hard labour without sufficient {{food and water}} - to race up the stairs carrying blocks of stone. Those who survived the ordeal would often {{be placed in a}} line-up {{at the edge of a}} cliff known as [...] "The Parachutists Wall" [...] (Fallschirmspringerwand). At gun-point each prisoner would have the option of being shot or pushing the prisoner in front of him off the cliff. Other common methods of extermination of prisoners who were either sick, unfit for further labour or as a means of collective responsibility or after escape attempts included beating the prisoners to death by the SS guards and Kapos, starving to death in bunkers, hangings and mass shootings. At times the guards or Kapos would either deliberately throw the prisoners on the 380 volt <b>electric</b> barbed <b>wire</b> <b>fence,</b> or force them outside the boundaries of the camp and then shoot them on the pretence that they were attempting to escape. Another method of extermination were icy showers - some 3,000 inmates died of hypothermia after having been forced to take an icy cold shower and then left outside in cold weather. A large number of inmates were drowned in barrels of water at Gusen II.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the design of}} an Electric Fence Monitoring System (EFMS) which detects and announciates fence malfunctions indicating operational ineffectiveness. The EFMS consists of a master unit and up to sixteen slave units. Each slave unit monitors a single remote point on the fence. Slave units gain their power from the electric fence pulse itself. They use a unique transmission algorithm to transmit the peak electric fence voltage, to the master unit. The <b>electric</b> <b>fence</b> <b>wire</b> is used to convey this transmission. The master unit uses a non-linear switched capacitor filter with variable gain control, to detect the slave unit transmissions. This unit displays the peak voltage at each monitored point and allows the setting of alarm trigger points. This thesis includes modelling of the electric fence energiser and typical electric fence line, and the detailed design of the two units that makeup the EFMS...|$|R
50|$|Operation Kiebitz, {{a plan to}} have Otto Kretschmer, Horst Elfe, Hans Ey and Hans Joachim Knebel-Döberitz {{escape and}} {{be picked up by}} a U-boat, was {{developed}} in 1942 and was to be executed in September 1943. Knebel-Döberitz was the former adjutant of Admiral Karl Dönitz. The successful escape of Kretschmer, a top U-boat ace, would be a major propaganda coup for the Germans. However, their escape plan was foiled, but Heyda made an escape via <b>electric</b> <b>wires</b> over a barbed <b>wire</b> <b>fence.</b> He then traveled 1400 km to Pointe de Maisonnette, New Brunswick on Chaleur Bay where he was to be picked up by a U-boat.|$|R

50|$|The {{technique}} {{consists of}} stitching together plywood panels {{with some sort}} of wire or other suitable device, such as cable ties or duct tape and staples. All these methods of stitching or suturing the plywood panels of the hull are simple methods of clamping the hull parts together before they are permanently welded or fused by epoxy and fiberglass tape joints. Once the epoxy sets solid in most cases the stitches or other clamping structures are removed leaving only the fused plywood panels behind. Copper wire is popular because the wires can be twisted tighter or looser to precisely adjust fit, and because it is easy to sand after gluing, and it is suitable in a marine environment if left in place, but mild steel <b>electric</b> <b>fencing</b> <b>wire</b> can be used just as easily and then can be removed completely from the hull structure. To join, the cut panels are drilled with small holes along the joining edges and stitched. Once together, the joint is glued, usually with thickened epoxy and fiberglass {{on the inside of the}} hull.|$|R
