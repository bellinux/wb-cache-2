[...] He praised its graphics, flight physics, and detailed <b>flight</b> <b>environment.</b> However, he complained of [...] "unflyably slow frame rates" [...] and warned that the game could not be played on older computers. Tony Lopez of GameSpot called the game's environmental modeling [...] "simply breathtaking" [...] and noted that elevations were rendered more smoothly than in Fly! or Microsoft Flight Simulator. He wrote that the game's flight physics and weather simulation were superior to those of any other flight simulator, and that the [...] "powerful, easy-to-use" [...] FLED editing tool could popularize the game. IGN writer Marc Saltzman commented that the game features [...] "absolutely stunning terrain at all altitudes, realistic weather and lighting effects, and highly-detailed planes". Saltzman praised the accuracy of Flight Unlimited IIIs physics but remarked that the game's frame rate was [...] "noticeably slower" [...] than that of its rivals.|$|E
