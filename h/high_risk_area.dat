5|$|On February 5 at 6:39am CST (1239 UTC), the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) {{issued a}} high risk of severe storms for most of Arkansas, the first in February since 1998. At 10:16 am CST (1616 UTC), the <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>area</b> was {{extended}} farther northeast to include western Kentucky, northwestern Mississippi, the Missouri Bootheel, West Tennessee, and Southern Illinois. A moderate risk of severe weather was issued for northwestern Alabama, the rest of Arkansas, the rest of southern Illinois, southern Indiana, {{most of the rest of}} Kentucky, northern Louisiana, central Mississippi, parts of southeastern Missouri, southwestern Ohio, eastern Oklahoma, middle Tennessee and northeastern Texas. A total of fifteen watches were issued by the SPC during the outbreak, including thirteen tornado watches (two of which were PDS watches) and two severe thunderstorm watches.|$|E
5|$|A strong {{jet stream}} moved {{northeast}} across the Great Plains region {{and a strong}} surface low in western Kansas strengthened as it moved to the Nebraska-South Dakota border. Ahead of the low, very warm and moist air spread throughout the South Central United States into Nebraska, eastern sections of South Dakota and the upper Mississippi Valley. The combination of strong winds and warm and moist air created conditions favorable for strong thunderstorms. On June 5, {{a high risk of}} severe weather was issued for six different states in the Midwestern United States, with a moderate risk area surrounding the <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>area.</b> Forecasters had warned of a potentially historic outbreak, as computer forecasting models for June 5resembled those on June 8, 1974, when 39tornadoes struck the southern Great Plains and killed 22people. Wichita State University canceled evening classes because of the weather predictions. Severe weather began developing across eastern Colorado and northwestern Kansas during the morning and into the early afternoon, producing several weak tornadoes in the process. An EF1tornado impacted a campground near Kellogg, Iowa and injured two people. Despite extremely favorable conditions, severe weather for the day was limited and the tornadoes generally caused minimal damage.|$|E

40|$|Heavy human {{activities}} in mountainous areas make avalanches a big threat to tourists and natives {{at the same}} time. Therefore many tourist activities as well as businesses look for reliable risk assessment tools. According to complex mathematical models <b>risk</b> <b>areas</b> are defined based on simulation and visualisation with Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Resulting maps are used to support decisions of local officials. This study is aiming at two aspects of assessing avalanche risk areas: (1) impact of fuzzy set based classification on visualization of avalanche <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>areas</b> and (2) comparison of resulting GIS based risk maps using different logical operators. The main goals {{in this study are}} to explore and evaluate possibilities and impacts of fuzzy set modelling to linguistic terms representing spatial categories related to mapping avalanche <b>risk</b> <b>areas.</b> Quite recently local experts were quoted with “avalanche <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>areas</b> can be found at predominantly steep slopes with lots of shadow”. A numerical evaluation of the amount of <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>areas</b> was performed and was compared with the results of similar linguistic classes modelled by crisp sets. Clearly, a much more detailed account on <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>areas</b> can be obtained from the DEM, even if you use only two linguistic classes. The differences in the amount of <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>areas</b> were evaluated primarily with visual interpretation from a cartographic point of view.

25|$|The {{activity}} quickly redeveloped late in {{the morning}} of April 24. Later in the afternoon, the risk that day was upgraded to a high risk over parts of East Texas. Tornadoes, along with large hail and damaging winds, occurred in the afternoon and evening hours across the Plains. 22 tornadoes were reported. One large tornadic supercell also moved through Piedras Negras, Coahuila in Mexico, and moved into Eagle Pass, Texas, with reports of significant damage on the U.S. side of the border and at least seven deaths and 74 injuries from that EF3 tornado, plus at least three deaths and at least 40 injuries across the river in Piedras Negras. There was virtually no activity in the <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>area,</b> however, and that busted.|$|E
500|$|Early on {{the morning}} of February 5, a squall line {{developed}} across eastern Texas northward into Missouri and moved east towards the <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>area.</b> Ahead of the squall line, the cap took longer than expected to break, but when it finally did in the late afternoon hours, numerous supercell thunderstorms quickly formed across Arkansas and southern Missouri. The first tornadoes touched down around 3:30 pm CST (2130 UTC). A cap is a layer of relatively warm air aloft (usually several thousand feet above the ground) which suppresses or delays the development of thunderstorms; the cap often prevents or delays thunderstorm development even in the presence of extreme instability. However, if the cap is removed or weakened, then explosive thunderstorm development can occur. Some of the most powerful tornado-producing supercells were situated across the Memphis and Jackson areas, as well as central Arkansas (one producing a tornado that tracked 122 miles (196km) and lasted about two hours) between 5:00 and 7:30 pm CST (2300 to 0130 UTC) while numerous other tornadoes were reported across northern Mississippi northwest of Tupelo, Mississippi, early in the evening. As the evening progressed, one of these supercells traveled across Middle Tennessee including the Nashville metropolitan area and south-central Kentucky, where several deadly tornadoes were reported during the evening hours between 7:30 pm and 11:00 pm CST (0130 to 0500 UTC) ...|$|E

2500|$|Flooding is {{the most}} {{prominent}} natural hazard in Argentina, and along with the littoral provinces, Buenos Aires is a very <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>area.</b> Across the country, an according to 1998 statistics from Swiss-Re, Argentina ranks 18th {{in the world in}} potential flood losses, in excess of US$3 billion in 1998. [...] Argentina is also one of 14 countries whose potential losses from floods are greater than 1 percent of GDP. Specifically in Buenos Aires, flooding occurs on average about twice per year. These floods are due to two causes: the condition of the drainage network, and strong winds from the southeast, (sudestadas), which produce a rise of the Rio de la Plata high above its average. Its waters then spill over the land, flooding the coastal areas inhabited by the poor. From the topographical standpoint, the City of Buenos Aires and its suburbs are located in a periphery of rolling grasslands, characterized by its limited slope toward the Rio de la Plata. The area was originally carved by small watercourses that either drain into the Rio de la Plata or in the two most important bodies of water in the area: the Reconquista and Matanza-Riachuelo. All of the watercourses have the special characteristics of a plain region: short water courses with little permanent flow, irregular routes, and broad flood valleys. The layout of the watercourses defines flood-prone areas, where flooding of the following tributary areas often occurs. The Maldonado (covering 5,050 hectares in Buenos Aires), Medrano, (covering 2,050 ha in Buenos Aires and 4,600 in total); White-Vega (covering 1,777 ha); and Cildáñez are important basins covering Buneos Aires.|$|E

40|$|Background: Despite {{advancement}} of our knowledge, cholera remains {{a public health}} concern. During March-April 2010, a large cholera outbreak afflicted {{the eastern part of}} Kolkata, India. The quantification of importance of socio-environmental factors in the risk of cholera, and the calculation of the risk is fundamental for deploying vaccination strategies. Here we investigate socio-environmental characteristics between <b>high</b> and low <b>risk</b> <b>areas</b> as well as the potential impact of vaccination on the spatial occurrence of the disease. Methods and Findings: The study area comprised three wards of Kolkata Municipal Corporation. A mass cholera vaccination campaign was conducted in mid- 2006 as the part of a clinical trial. Cholera cases and data of the trial to identify <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>areas</b> for cholera were analyzed. We used a generalized additive model (GAM) to detect <b>risk</b> <b>areas,</b> and to evaluate the importance of socio-environmental characteristics between <b>high</b> and low <b>risk</b> <b>areas.</b> During the one-year pre-vaccination and two-year post-vaccination periods, 95 and 183 cholera cases were detected in 111, 882 and 121, 827 study participants, respectively.

40|$|Occupational {{exposure}} to blood and body fluids (BBF) {{is a major}} concern in healthcare, because of the risk of occupationally-associated infections (OAIs). In 2000, the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act (NSPA) required OSHA to incorporate additional requirements to protect healthcare workers (HCWs) from {{exposure to}} BBF. As a nation, we saw needlesticks or percutaneous sharps injuries (PCSIs) decline, but it is uncertain if the decline also represented declines in other BBF exposures, specifically mucotaneous splash and splatter incidents (MSSIs). ^ This study measures the implications of the NSPA and its incorporation into the OSHA BPS by determining whether the ratio of MSSIs to PCSIs (MSSI:PCSI) varied over three study periods: 1995 - 1999 (prior to NSPA), 2000 - 2002 (NSPA and OSHA promulgation), and afterwards, in 2003 - 2007; these comparisons were also made between <b>high</b> and low <b>risk</b> hospital <b>areas.</b> ^ Over 30, 000 exposure incidents from nearly 70 U. S. hospitals reporting into the Exposure Prevention Information Network (EPINet™*) were analyzed. Preliminary analysis of MSSI:PCSI indicated no difference by time period. Ratios were <b>higher</b> in low <b>risk</b> (e. g., patient rooms, radiology) compared to <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> hospital <b>areas</b> (e. g., operating room, obstetrics). ^ Because personal protective equipment (PPE) protects workers from MSSI exposures, PPE use was also analyzed for all MSSIs across the study period. Counts and percentages were calculated for <b>high</b> versus low <b>risk</b> <b>areas.</b> For MSSIs, there was more frequent (75 %) and a higher odds of PPE use (OR = 1. 58, CI 1. 35, 1. 72) in <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>areas,</b> as compared to low <b>risk</b> hospital <b>areas</b> (25 %). The majority of MSSIs involved the eyes (79 %) as compared to the nose (6 %) and mouth (15 %). Sixty-six percent of those incidents occurred in <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>areas.</b> ^ Additionally, appropriate incident-specific PPE use was analyzed and compared, meaning when eye incidents were identified, so was use of eye-appropriate PPE (e. g., eyeglasses, side shields, faceshields or goggles). Masks (31 %) and eyeglasses with sideshields (26 %) were most frequently worn appropriately in <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>areas,</b> as compared to low risk (12 % and 8 % respectively). The odds of appropriately wearing masks (OR= 1. 41, CI 1. 63 - 1. 82) and eyeglasses (OR= 1. 97, CI 1. 78, 2. 57) were also greater in high as compared to low <b>risk</b> hospital <b>areas.</b> Eye-appropriate PPE was worn most frequently (65 %) in <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>areas</b> than other types of PPE type (nose or mouth) (5 %). ^ The {{results of this study suggest}} that, despite passage of a national policy and a decline in sharps injuries, there has been little change in the overall ratio of MSSIs to PCSIs. There are, however, differences between MSSI and PCSI in low compared to <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> hospital <b>areas.</b> HCWs working in low <b>risk</b> <b>areas</b> are not wearing PPE as frequently and appropriately as those in <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>areas,</b> despite experiencing an MSSI. This study suggests that, whereas additional policy may not be necessary, perhaps a greater focus on preventing exposure incidents in low <b>risk</b> hospital <b>areas</b> is needed. ...|$|R
