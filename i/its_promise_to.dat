5|$|Prior to the 1994 FIFA World Cup, the United States Soccer Federation {{fulfilled}} <b>its</b> <b>promise</b> <b>to</b> FIFA by aiding in {{the foundation}} of a new professional league. On June 15, 1994, Major League Soccer selected Washington, D.C. out of twenty-two applicants to host one of the first seven teams, with three more added before the league's launch. The team's name was chosen as a reflection of the names of European clubs, such as Manchester United or Leeds United.|$|E
5|$|Livingstone's {{administration}} {{founded the}} Greater London Enterprise Board (GLEB) to create employment {{by investing in}} the industrial regeneration of London, with the funds provided by the council, its workers' pension fund and the financial markets. Livingstone later claimed that GLC bureaucrats obstructed much of what GLEB tried to achieve. Other policies implemented by the Labour Left also foundered. Attempts to prevent the sale-off of GLC council housing largely failed, {{in part due to}} the strong opposition from the Conservative government. ILEA attempted to carry through with <b>its</b> <b>promise</b> <b>to</b> cut the price of school meals in the capital from 35p to 25p, but was forced to abandon its plans following legal advice that the councillors could be made to pay the surcharge and disqualified from public office.|$|E

25|$|By January 2012, the Government had backtracked on <b>its</b> <b>promise</b> <b>to</b> {{implement}} a strong Jan Lokpal, resulting in another series of protests from Kejriwal {{and his fellow}} activists. These protests attracted lower participation compared to the 2011 protests. By mid-2012, Kejriwal had replaced Anna Hazare as {{the face of the}} remaining protestors.|$|E
25|$|On August 2017, Uber {{accepted}} a settlement from the Federal Trade Commission admitting to claiming falsely that internal access to consumers’ personal information was closely monitored {{on an ongoing}} basis, and also stating that Uber had {{failed to live up}} to <b>its</b> <b>promise</b> <b>to</b> provide reasonable security for consumer data.|$|E
25|$|After the war, the British {{government}} {{transported to}} New Brunswick and settled about 400 of 3000 former slaves from the United States whom they freed {{during and after}} the war. It had fulfilled <b>its</b> <b>promise</b> <b>to</b> them of freedom if they left slaveholders and fought with the British. Enslaved African Americans risked considerable danger by crossing to British lines to achieve freedom.|$|E

5000|$|Hadi al-Amiri criticized {{those who}} were [...] "kissing {{the hands of the}} Americans", saying that the US failed to live up <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>promises</b> <b>to</b> help Iraq fight ISIL, unlike the [...] "unconditional" [...] {{assistance}} being given by Iran.|$|R
25|$|The 1935 Constitution {{was written}} in 1934, {{approved}} and adopted by the Commonwealth of the Philippines (1935–1946) and later used by the Third Republic (1946–1972). It was written {{with an eye to}} meeting the approval of the United States Government as well, so as to ensure that the U.S. would live up to <b>its</b> <b>promise</b> <b>to</b> grant the Philippines independence and not have a premise to hold onto its possession {{on the grounds that it}} was too politically immature and hence unready for full, real independence.|$|E
25|$|By January 1863, the Central Pacific Railroad (CPRR) {{had begun}} laying tracks east from Sacramento, California, {{eventually}} connecting with the Union Pacific Railroad at Promontory, Utah, {{to form the}} First Transcontinental Railroad. Lake deeded land to the CPRR in exchange for <b>its</b> <b>promise</b> <b>to</b> build a depot at Lake's Crossing. Once the railroad station was established, the town of Reno officially came into being on May 9, 1868. CPRR construction superintendent Charles Crocker named the community after Major General Jesse Lee Reno, a Union officer killed in the American Civil War at the Battle of South Mountain.|$|E
25|$|Notably, Cartier had {{intended}} to support an amnesty for Riel {{for his role in}} setting up a Provisional government in the Northwest, but that the Conservative government reneged on <b>its</b> <b>promise</b> <b>to</b> secure amnesty for the Métis leader, who was Cartier's maternal fifth cousin, twice removed, both having descended from Canadian pioneer Zacharie Cloutier and Xainte Dupont (c. 1596 - 1680) who had, in 1634, immigrated to New France in the first wave of the Percheron Immigration from the former province of Perche, to an area that, today, is part of Quebec, Canada. He settled in Beauport and founded one of the foremost families of Quebec.|$|E
25|$|In a statement, Rovers accused Sainsbury's of {{breaking}} <b>its</b> <b>promises.</b> It described {{the decision as}} a 'kick in the teeth' {{for the people of}} Bristol. The club claimed that it was abundantly clear throughout the case that Sainsbury's reneged on <b>its</b> <b>promises</b> <b>to</b> the local community to invest in the region and showed a flagrant disregard for the terms of the contract.|$|R
25|$|At {{the end of}} {{the year}} the notorious Moloto road claimed another sixteen lives when a PUTCO bus driver overtook a minibus taxi and {{collided}} with another PUTCO bus in rainy conditions.

25|$|As a Roosevelt {{supporter}} and {{a delegate}} from the District of Columbia, {{he served as}} one of nine members on the Platform Committee of the 1932 Democratic National Convention and authored the original draft of the platform. Time magazine later credited him with the platform's opposition to forgiving the debts of America's allies in World War I and <b>its</b> <b>promise</b> <b>to</b> reduce government expenditures by 25%. Palmer said that the savings could be devoted to programs to relieve unemployment. With the repeal of prohibition a major campaign issue, Palmer used his expertise as the Attorney General who first enforced Prohibition to promote a plan to expedite its repeal through state conventions rather than the state legislatures.|$|E
25|$|He briefly {{left the}} Foreign Office (FO) in 1981 {{and joined the}} Independence Movement to step in the {{national}} politics. He was quickly elevated as the Secretary-General of the Tehrik-e-Istiqlal (lit. Independence Movement). He was subsequently arrested on innumerable occasions during his long struggle for the democracy. After the military government of Zia-ul-Haq went back on <b>its</b> <b>promise</b> <b>to</b> hold general elections in the country, leading political parties got together {{under the banner of}} the Movement for Restoration of Democracy (MRD) for the purpose of holding general elections, restoration of fundamental rights of the citizens, removal of restrictions placed on the free functioning of the press and the establishment of an independent judiciary. He was arrested on numerous occasions for taking part in a movement launched by the political parties in February 1981 for the achievement of the above objectives.|$|E
500|$|William Aberhart's Social Credit League won a {{substantial}} {{victory in the}} 1935 Alberta provincial election {{on the strength of}} <b>its</b> <b>promise</b> <b>to</b> implement social credit, an economic theory proposed by British engineer C. H. Douglas. [...] Social credit held that the poverty of the Great Depression was in part the fault of bankers, who kept the cost of credit, and by extension of production, high.

500|$|In his 1993 {{programme}} {{guide to}} the Anderson productions, John Peel comments that Thunderbirds Are Go is [...] "well-made" [...] and that it fulfils <b>its</b> <b>promise</b> <b>to</b> deliver visual spectacle, coming off as the more favourable of the two Thunderbirds films, although the plot is partly recycled from the television episodes, and the dream sequence is [...] "painfully silly" [...] and [...] "embarrassingly awful". La Rivière agrees with Peel's view that the Thunderbird machines are underused, and that the extended model shots and infrequent appearances from the Tracy family {{may have been a}} disappointment to the intended audience of children.|$|E
500|$|Giddy {{with their}} success, the {{radicals}} now started to overstep their bounds. Their legitimacy was already tenuous, {{because of the}} way they had seized power. Now they also lost support in the rump-Assembly because of their partisanship. Not wishing to repeat the mistakes of the French Jacobins they moved against the popular political clubs that formed their political base, thereby alienating their most enthusiastic supporters. On the other hand, at the behest of Delacroix they also moved against [...] "counter-revolutionaries" [...] by having purging commissions removing these people from the electoral rolls, further undermining the legitimacy of the regime, as moderate Patriots were also disenfranchised. The final blow was that the new regime reneged on <b>its</b> <b>promise</b> <b>to</b> elect an entirely new Representative Assembly.|$|E
500|$|Janet Maslin of The New York Times {{called it}} [...] "a true movie milestone, {{presenting}} awe- and fear-inspiring sights {{never before seen}} on the screen... On paper, this story is tailor-made for Mr. Spielberg's talents... t becomes less crisp on screen than {{it was on the}} page, with much of the enjoyable jargon either mumbled confusingly or otherwise thrown away." [...] In Rolling Stone, Peter Travers described the film as [...] "colossal entertainment—the eye-popping, mind-bending, kick-out-the-jams thrill ride of summer and probably the year [...] Compared with the dinos, the characters are dry bones, indeed. Crichton and co-screenwriter David Koepp have flattened them into nonentities on the trip from page to screen." [...] Roger Ebert noted, [...] "The movie delivers all too well on <b>its</b> <b>promise</b> <b>to</b> show us dinosaurs. We see them early and often, and they are indeed a triumph of special effects artistry, but the movie is lacking other qualities that it needs even more, such as a sense of awe and wonderment, and strong human story values." [...] Henry Sheehan argued, [...] "The complaints over Jurassic Parks lack of story and character sound a little off the point," [...] pointing out the story arc of Grant learning to protect Hammond's grandchildren despite his initial dislike of them. Empire magazine gave the film five stars, hailing it as [...] "quite simply one of the greatest blockbusters of all time." ...|$|E
50|$|Joseph Noone, the {{clinical}} director psychiatrist-in-chief at Riverview in 1992 claimed that A Draft Plan to Replace Riverview Hospital had “magical {{faith that the}} Social Credit government would follow through on <b>its</b> <b>promises</b> <b>to</b> expand services in the community once they had downsized this hospital”. Noone claims that he was suspicious of the report since its publication. Noone also stated that 1,000 patients were brought in and shipped out of Riverview annually.|$|R

2500|$|Congress {{continued}} {{to debate the}} economic and social status of the free population, with land reform identified as critical to realizing black freedom. A bill drafted in conference committee to provide limited land tenure for one year while authorizing military supervision of freedmen was rejected in the Senate by abolitionists who thought it did not do justice to the freedmen.

25|$|In {{a repeat}} of Japanese wartime {{monetary}} policy, the government defaulted on <b>its</b> <b>promises</b> <b>to</b> redeem <b>its</b> banknotes in silver or gold coin while promising to maintain the two-to-one peso to dollar parity. This decision, compounded with the deliberate overprinting of fiat banknotes, resulted in the peso dropping in value by almost 67% against the US dollar within the first three hours of opening day. The government effort to maintain the peg devastated the gold, silver and dollar reserves of the country.|$|R
