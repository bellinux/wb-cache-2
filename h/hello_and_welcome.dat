Our topic today is “The Art of Architecture Transformation. ” • As we all know, large scale transformations can be very challenging. These challenges are not only compounded by a wide array of new technology components and high business expectation to get it right the first time, but also for planning and executing something that your organization – or you- have never done! • Today, we want to explore the art and science of large scale architecture planning. Our speakers are practicing enterprise architects, and will share their experiences and lessons learned in rebuilding entire IT organizations and infrastructure. • They will discuss this in terms of a standardized approach that includes business-led architecture planning, change management, and business communication. All of which are critical to ensure that your projects stay supported and funded! Let me introduce our speakers. Copyright © 2012, Oracle and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.

40|$|<b>Hello</b> {{everyone}} <b>and</b> <b>welcome</b> to the 19 th Security Protocols Workshop. The theme this year, {{which it}} is traditional to mention in the first session (and then never refer to again), is "Alice doesn't live here anymore". One of the perennial problems in analysing security protocols is how we distinguish Alice from not-Alice. The prevailing wisdom is that Alice possesses something which not-Alice does not. It might be knowledge of something that {{is used as a}} key. It might be that Alice possesses some physical characteristic, such as a biometric, or that there is something about the hardware that Alice is running on that is difficult to replicate. Or it might be that Alice possesses exclusive access to the interface to some distinguishing piece of hardware, like a dongle, although such hardware (when we think about it) usually belongs to some other security domain anyway. ?? 2011 Springer-Verlag...|$|R
40|$|Wow, {{has this}} project grown! <b>Hello,</b> <b>and</b> <b>welcome</b> {{to our new}} watchers and {{stargazers}} — and a special thanks to everybody who has provided feedback and helped over the past weeks. It's been a huge pleasure, and a complete blast, to have you around. Things have become much nicer and more stable {{as a result of}} your support, and I (that's me, @felixhenninger) have learnt a great deal and have become a better developer. This release is to commemorate a stable state in view of a few major upcoming changes, but there's also been a lot of activity that is worth summarizing. Contributor friendliness, project infrastructure, and community outreach A focus of the recent work has been to make the project as a whole more stable and accessible to contributors. This was prompted in a large part by Mozilla's excellent Open Leadership Training and the fantastic Global Sprint. In particular, the project now has A Code of Conduct Improved Contributor Documentation Build testing via travis-ci, thanks to @pvskarthikeya, who also (rightly) recommended the excellent course How to Write an Open Source Javascript Library by Kent C.
