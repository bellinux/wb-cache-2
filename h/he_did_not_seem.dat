5|$|Astana {{participated in}} the Volta a Catalunya in May, while the Giro d'Italia was ongoing. The team did not win any stage, but Haimar Zubeldia took third overall in the event, and the team won the teams classification. In the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré in June, Contador {{was thought to be}} a {{favorite}} for victory, but <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to try his hardest to win, not attacking or taking any pulls on the mountainous Stage 5 and seeming to work for Alejandro Valverde on the race's last two days. The team next took part in the Tour de Suisse, with Klöden in fourth their highest-placed rider.|$|E
5|$|The 1955 Dodgers {{got off to}} {{a strong}} start. Even so, an Associated Press article noted that Alston was reticent in {{response}} to questions and that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> like a manager who had won ten consecutive games. The 1955 Brooklyn team won the pennant and its only World Series championship. They clinched the NL pennant earlier in the year than any team had in NL history. In the World Series, Alston started Johnny Podres, who had a mediocre 9-10 regular season record, in the third and seventh games; Podres won both games. The pitcher had struggled with arm problems for much of the season.|$|E
500|$|To Bamber's supporters, who {{over the}} years have {{included}} MPs and journalists, he is a victim of one of Britain's worst miscarriages of justice. The Guardian took up his case at one point. One or more Guardian journalists began corresponding with him in 2006, and two interviewed him in 2011. Describing him as [...] "clever and strategic", they wrote that there was something about him that made the public unsympathetic toward him. He was [...] "handsome in a rather cruel, caddish way—he seemed to exude arrogance and indifference.... Like Meursault in the Camus novel L'Etranger, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to display the appropriate emotions." [...] He is reported to have passed a lie detector test in 2007.|$|E

500|$|Chapman {{considered}} {{the concept of}} an elderly Bond to be an interesting one, with Bond referring to Connery's Bond as a [...] "sexual acrobat who leaves a trail of beautiful dead women behind like blown roses". In line with the literary Bond, Niven's character drives a vintage Bentley, rather than the Aston Martin favoured by Connery. Bond scholar Steven Jay Rubin thought Niven perfectly cast as the retired Bond, and saw him as [...] "a throw-back to the hell-for-leather adventure heroes" [...] of the character, which paralleled Niven's own life and career. Barnes and Hearn describe this as a [...] "perfectly fair interpretation", given the way Niven approached the role, while Raymond Benson thinks casting Niven was [...] "intelligent". Jeremy Black questioned the use of Niven in the role, observing that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to be a killer, and did not have the [...] "disconcerting edge" [...] that Connery had.|$|E
500|$|The US tour {{started on}} 20 November at the Cow Palace in San Francisco. The group were nervous about playing Quadrophenia after the British tour, {{especially}} Moon. Before the show, {{he was offered}} some tranquillisers from a fan. Just after the show started, the fan collapsed and was hospitalised. Moon's playing, meanwhile, became incredibly erratic, particularly during Quadrophenia where <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> {{to be able to}} keep time with the backing tapes. Towards the end of the show, during [...] "Won't Get Fooled Again", he passed out over his drumkit. After a 20-minute wait, Moon reappeared onstage, but after a few bars of [...] "Magic Bus", collapsed again, and was immediately taken to hospital. Scot Halpin, an audience member, convinced promoter Bill Graham to let him play drums, and the group closed the show with him. Moon had a day to recover, and by the next show at the Los Angeles Forum, was playing to his usual strength. The group began to get used to the backing tapes, and the remainder of gigs for the US tour were successful.|$|E
500|$|The indulgence {{controversy}} {{set off by}} the Theses was {{the beginning}} of the Reformation, a schism in the Roman Catholic Church which initiated profound and lasting social and political change in Europe. Luther later stated that the issue of indulgences was insignificant relative to controversies which he would enter into later, such as his debate with Erasmus over the bondage of the will, nor did he see the controversy as important to his intellectual breakthrough regarding the gospel. Luther later wrote that at the time he wrote the Theses he remained a [...] "papist", and <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to think the Theses represented a break with established Catholic doctrine. But it was out of the indulgences controversy that the movement which would be called the Reformation began, and the controversy propelled Luther to the leadership position he would hold in that movement. The Theses also made evident that Luther believed the church was not preaching properly and that this put the laity in serious danger. Further, the Theses contradicted the decree of Pope Clement VI, that indulgences are the treasury of the church. This disregard for papal authority presaged later conflicts.|$|E

500|$|Virginia's {{death had}} a {{significant}} effect on Poe. After her death, Poe was deeply saddened for several months. A friend said of him, [...] "the loss of his wife was a sad blow to him. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to care, after she was gone, whether he lived an hour, a day, a week or a year; she was his all." [...] A year after her death, he wrote to a friend that he had experienced the greatest evil a man can suffer when, he said, [...] "a wife, whom I loved as no man ever loved before", had fallen ill. While Virginia was still struggling to recover, Poe turned to alcohol after abstaining for quite some time. How often and how much he drank is a controversial issue, debated in Poe's lifetime and also by modern biographers. Poe referred to his emotional response to his wife's sickness as his own illness, and that he found the cure to it [...] "in the death of my wife. This I can & do endure as becomes a manit was the horrible never-ending oscillation between hope & despair which I could not longer have endured without the total loss of reason".|$|E
500|$|Gordon-Cumming was {{replaced}} in the witness box by the prince. Examined by Clarke, {{he stated that}} he had not seen any cheating, and was ignorant of the accusations until he was told by Coventry and Williams. After 20 minutes of questions from both Clarke and Russell, the prince was free to depart. As the prince was leaving the witness box, a member of the jury put two questions to Edward: whether the heir had seen [...] "nothing of the alleged malpractices of the plaintiff?", and [...] "what was your Royal Highness's opinion at the time as to the charges made against Sir William Gordon-Cumming?" [...] To the first question the prince replied {{that he had not}}, although he explained that [...] "it is not usual for a banker to see anything in dealing cards"; to the second, he stated that [...] "the charges appeared to be so unanimous that it was the proper course—no other course was open to me—than to believe them". In comparison with Gordon-Cumming's performance in the witness box, Edward did not make a strong impression; the reporter for The New York Times noticed [...] "that the heir apparent was decidedly fidgety, that he kept changing his position, and that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> able to keep his hands still... Except to those near him, only two or three of his answers were fairly audible throughout the courtroom". The Daily News agreed, and stated that the impression gained from the prince's performance was unfavourable.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the time}} trial, {{there were three}} mountainous stages, {{although}} {{none of them had}} a summit finish. All three were won by riders from breakaways. Nicolas Roche (Sky) won Stage 18, beating Haimar Zubeldia (Trek Factory Racing) in a two-man sprint. After his team had put pressure on the peloton through the whole stage, Aru attacked Dumoulin six times on the final climb, and Valverde put in three more attacks. Dumoulin, however, did not lose any time and retained his three-second lead. Stage 19 ended with a short, cobbled climb into Ávila. It was won by Alexis Gougeard (...) , who had escaped from the breakaway group on the previous climb. The day's racing also produced another crash: this time Aru fell to the ground. Although he had to make several trips to the medical car, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> seriously injured. At the end of the stage, Dumoulin used his team to put him in a strong position for the cobbled climb and he increased his lead over Aru to six seconds. Stage 20 was the final day of mountainous terrain, including four difficult climbs. It was won by Rubén Plaza (Lampre-Merida) after a [...] solo breakaway that lasted over three hours. Aru's Astana team rode hard {{in the second half of}} the stage and, with a strong team effort, they were eventually able to drop Dumoulin on the penultimate climb of the day; he dropped further back on the final climb and lost nearly four minutes, dropping to sixth place overall. Quintana and Majka gained nearly a minute on the other general classification rivals. This meant that Aru took the race lead, with Rodríguez second and Majka third.|$|E

500|$|Lamb {{appeared}} {{to the justice}} to be a profoundly troubled young man. There was {{no doubt that he}} had killed Chaykoski and Woloch, he had not acted in self-defence and {{there was no evidence of}} provocation; the chances of reducing the murder charge to manslaughter were therefore slim. Nosanchuk felt obliged, in the light of Lamb's psychiatric and personal history, to explore an insanity plea. The lawyer interviewed Yaworsky and Dolan, secured them as witnesses for the trial, and also reviewed a report from four doctors at Penetanguishene who had previously interviewed his client. According to this report, Lamb had been amiable, fluent in his conversation and apparently plausible; he at first claimed amnesia for the events of 25 June, but on continued questioning related what had happened [...] "in detail". He admitted his responsibility but still did not appear to be concerned about what had happened. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to be able to emotionally appreciate the consequences of his actions, even though he understood on an intellectual level that he had shot at some people and that to do that was wrong. When he told the psychiatrists that he regretted what he had done, they wrote that he [...] "clearly did not have any real underlying feeling of remorse". He also did not appear to have considered that he might be suffering from any illness, mental or otherwise. The Penetanguishene report concluded that Lamb [...] "suffered from a disease of the mind as a pathological anti-social or psychopathic personality", which was a recognised psychiatric disorder under the Criminal Code and therefore grounds for an insanity defence in court.|$|E
500|$|From 1976 to 1979, {{the group}} lived in campgrounds, {{usually in the}} Rocky Mountains or Texas. Applewhite and Nettles began to place greater demands on their followers' {{heretofore}} loosely structured lives, which improved membership retention. They typically communicated with their disciples in writing or through assistants. Increasingly, they emphasized {{that they were the}} only source of truth—the idea that members could receive individual revelations was rejected in an attempt to prevent schisms. Applewhite also sought to prevent close friendships among his followers, fearing that this could lead to insubordination. Applewhite and Nettles insisted that their followers practice what they referred to as [...] "flexibility": strict obedience to their often shifting requests. The two leaders limited the group's contacts with those outside the movement, even some who may have been interested in joining, ostensibly to prevent infiltration from hostile parties. In practice, this made their followers completely dependent upon them. Applewhite instructed his disciples to be like children or pets in their submission—their sole responsibility was to obey their leaders. Members were encouraged to constantly seek Applewhite's advice and often ask themselves what their leaders would do when making a decision. To his followers, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> dictatorial: many of them found him laid back and fatherly. In his 2000 study of the group, Winston Davis states that Applewhite mastered the [...] "fine art of religious entertainment", noting that many of his disciples seemed to enjoy their service. Applewhite organized seemingly arbitrary rituals that were intended to instill a sense of discipline in his followers; he referred to these tasks as [...] "games". He also watched science-fiction television programs {{with the rest of the}} group. Rather than issue direct commands, he attempted to express his preferences and nominally offer his disciples a choice. He emphasized that students were free to disobey if they chose, in what Lalich dubs the [...] "illusion of choice".|$|E
500|$|In {{the fourth}} season opener, Rita and Dexter are living happily {{together}} in a suburban neighborhood with Astor, Cody, and new baby Harrison. In [...] "Remains to be Seen" [...] Dexter is in a terrible car accident, and Rita demands that he give her his keys {{so that she can}} drive him. In [...] "If I Had a Hammer," [...] friction begins to develop in the couple's relationship, and Dexter seeks guidance from Arthur Mitchell (John Lithgow), a family man who appears to balance his responsibilities with his secret life as the [...] "Trinity Killer". In [...] "Hungry Man," [...] Rita works hard to prepare Thanksgiving dinner. She shares a kiss with the next door neighbor, Elliot Larson (Rick Peters), when she asks if she can use his stove. Dexter arrives for an appointment with Rita for marriage counseling, but gets called to a crime scene as soon as he arrives. Soon after, Rita confesses that she and Elliot kissed, although Dexter tries to brush it off. Rita later admits that she felt hurt that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to care about her indiscretion. Dexter then punches Elliot and warns him to stay away from Rita, which reassures her that Dexter loves her. In the fourth season finale, Dexter asks her to go out of town so they can have a belated honeymoon; in reality, Dexter wants to keep her safe from Mitchell, who has learned his real identity and threatened to kill him and his family. After killing Mitchell, Dexter returns home and finds a message from Rita that she returned to pick up her identification for the flight. Dexter finds her dead in the bathtub [...] Mitchell's last victim. In the fifth season premiere [...] "My Bad", Dexter realizes, much to his own surprise, that he genuinely loved Rita and is devastated by her death. Julie Benz reprised her role as Rita as a special guest star in a flashback to her and Dexter's first date, and as a corpse.|$|E

2500|$|Though {{the prior}} ministers' fates {{and the level}} of {{contention}} in Salem Village were valid reasons for caution in accepting the position, Rev Parris increased the village's divisions by delaying his acceptance. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> able to settle his new parishioners' disputes: by deliberately seeking out [...] "iniquitous behavior" [...] in his congregation and making church members in good standing suffer public penance for small infractions, he contributed significantly to the tension within the village.

2500|$|In November 1987, after Premier Zhao Ziyang was {{promoted}} to General Secretary, Li became acting Premier. He was formally elected Premier in March 1988. [...] Within a year of this promotion, Li would {{play a major role}} in ending Zhao's career, after Zhao publicly supported demonstrators in Tiananmen Square. At the time of his promotion, Li seemed like an unusual choice for Premier because <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to share Deng's enthusiasm for introducing market reforms.

He wanted answers too quickly. I think part of the trouble may have been that he wasn't concentrating very hard on his thesis.

2500|$|Defenders of Ervin {{argue that}} his {{opposition}} to most civil rights legislation was based on {{his commitment to the}} preservation of the Constitution in its pristine formulation, and a general belief that the equal justice clause of the constitution only applied to white men. He repeatedly stated the Constitution encapsulated civil, human and equal rights for all those he considered worthy. There is little if any evidence that he engaged in the racial demagoguery of many of his Southern colleagues. Some historians consider Ervin's position to be one of [...] "cognitive dissonance" [...] because he opposed federal legislation to combat race-based discrimination, but did not do so in harsh, ugly terms. While he once maintained that Americans were entitled to [...] "their prejudices as well as their allergies", <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to be motivated by prejudice himself, but more by his suspicion of federal power. Ervin said he didn't like what the Warren Court [...] "has done to the Constitution".|$|E
2500|$|Candidate Reviews: Claire {{was accused}} of being too talkative but {{otherwise}} got the best reports from the interviewers, with Karren even offering to employ her if Sir Alan did not. Lee {{was considered to be}} a good all-round candidate, but got caught off-guard when asked to do a humorous impression by Paul, which backfired when he was told this demonstrated <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to take the interview seriously, while he was also reprimanded for exaggerating on his CV, lying about his length of time at university. Helene was also considered to have a good set of skills, but faced criticism for not having demonstrated any progression in work outside of her current company, and {{was accused of}} having a poor attitude after she repeatedly made insulting remarks about the other candidates. Alex continuously came under fire, with his CV being highlighted as boring; while he argued that this was because he was only 24 years old, both Karen and Paul insisted that this was not an excuse, stating that they had achieved more than him by his age. However, he did earn some praise for his accomplishments as a salesman, particularly {{the fact that he had}} managed to earn a living purely from sales commission. Lucinda got the worst reports, as she was praised for being intelligent and an excellent team leader, but heavily criticised for being a [...] "handful", with the interviewers questioning her motives for wanting the job, and feeling that her teamwork skills were weak.|$|E

[...] <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> to be much of a success in his new position and at half time, his captain David Watkins, switched him to centre. The following week Jarrett played in his first international and scored a breathtaking try. [...] England won a line-out in their own 25 (as it was then). [...] The ball was passed down the line to English centre, Colin McFadyean, who kicked towards the halfway line. [...] The ball bounced once and was seemingly going in to touch. [...] Instead, Jarret sprinted onto the ball, taking it without breaking stride. He sprinted down the touchline, outflanking the whole of the astonished England defence, to score in the left corner. [...] He converted his own try from just inside the touchline. Besides scoring a try, he kicked two penalty goals and five conversions for a total of 19 points. [...] His performance on the field was so impressive that the match has been known ever since as the Keith Jarrett match and he made the cover of Rugby World magazine two months later. The try has been voted seventh in a poll of the top ten Welsh tries and he is listed on the Welsh Rugby Union Official Website as the scorer of the [...] "Greatest Ever Welsh try".|$|E
