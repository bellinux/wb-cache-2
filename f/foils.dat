5|$|Because of its low {{atomic number}} and very low {{absorption}} for X-rays, {{the oldest and}} {{still one of the}} most important applications of beryllium is in radiation windows for X-ray tubes. Extreme demands are placed on purity and cleanliness of beryllium to avoid artifacts in the X-ray images.

Vacuum-tight windows and beam-tubes for radiation experiments on synchrotrons are manufactured exclusively from beryllium.

40|$|<b>Foil</b> {{bearings}} {{are widely}} used for oil-free micro turbomachinery. One of the critical technical issues related to reliability of the <b>foil</b> bearings is a coating wear on the top <b>foil</b> and rotor during start/stops. Bearing cooling is also mandatory for certain applications because the <b>foil</b> bearings can generate significant amount of heat depending on operating conditions. Usually axial flow is used through {{the space between the}} top <b>foil</b> and bearing sleeve. In this thesis, a hybrid air <b>foil</b> bearing with external pressurization is introduced. The hybrid operation eliminates the coating wear during start-up/shut down, and also reduces drag torque during starts. Furthermore, this hybrid <b>foil</b> bearing does not need cooling system. An experimental test with a loaded bearing under hydrostatic mode demonstrates the high potential of hybrid air <b>foil</b> bearings. The load capacity of the hybrid <b>foil</b> bearing was measured at 20, 000 rpm, and compared with that of hydrodynamic <b>foil</b> bearing. The hybrid <b>foil</b> bearing has much higher load capacity than the hydrodynamic <b>foil</b> bearing. The starting torque was also measured and compared with hydrodynamic bearing. A simple analytical model to calculate top <b>foil</b> deflection under hydrostatic pressurization has been developed. Predictions via orbit simulations indicate the hybrid air <b>foil</b> bearings can have a much higher critical speed and onset speed of instability than the hydrodynamic counter part. Major benefits of the hybrid <b>foil</b> bearings also include very low starting torque, reduced wear of the top <b>foil</b> and rotor, and very effective cooling capability by the pressurized air itself. This new concept of hybrid air <b>foil</b> bearings are expected to be widely applied to the oil free turbomachinery industry, especially for heavily loaded and/or high temperature applications...|$|R

5|$|Bismuth was {{purchased}} from the American Smelting and Refining Company {{of the highest}} purity that it could produce. It was sent to Hanford, where it was put in aluminum cans, and placed inside a reactor for 100 days. The canned slugs then shipped to Unit IV, where they were bathed in hydrochloric acid, which dissolved the aluminum. This formed an aluminum chloride solution that was disposed of, as it was highly radioactive due to iron and copper in the aluminum alloy. The bismuth slugs were then dissolved in aqua regia. This was too weak for electroplating the polonium, so the nitric acid was removed, and then the polonium deposited on bismuth by adding powdered bismuth. This resulted in a 100–1 concentration. This could then be repeated by dissolving in aqua regia again to achieve a 1000–1 concentration. This was again dissolved, and the polonium electroplated on platinum <b>foils.</b> The main problem with the process was that it required glass-lined containers due to the aqua regia, and mechanisms for safe handling of the radioactive material.
