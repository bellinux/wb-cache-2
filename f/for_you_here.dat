The other Sha'al, (which is Saul) is the leading Jew {{merchant}} here. They have recently come back from C'ple —they were at the first tea party I gave <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> <b>here.</b> I've known Sha'al's wife and family a long time—they are very interesting and able men. Sasun, with his reputation and his intelligence, ought to be a great help.”Bell also wrote of Sassoon on 17 October 1920:“That night Mr Philby dined with me and we had a long and profitable talk. He had been to tea with me also and I had Sasun Eff. to meet him which was most valuable, for Sasun is one of the sanest people here and he reviewed the whole position with his usual wisdom and moderation.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Fort Pulaski was {{considered}} invincible with its 7-1/2-foot solid brick walls and reinforcing masonry piers. General Robert E. Lee had earlier surveyed the fort’s defenses with Colonel Olmstead and determined, “they {{will make it}} pretty warm <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>here</b> with shells, but they cannot breach your walls at that distance." [...] Wide swampy marshes surrounded the fort on all sides and were infested with native alligators. No attacking ship could safely come within effective range, and land batteries could not be placed closer than Tybee Island, one to two miles away. Beyond 700 yards, smoothbore guns and mortars had little chance to break through heavy masonry walls. Beyond 1,000 yards, they had no chance at all. The U.S. Chief of Engineers, General Joseph Gilbert Totten, is quoted as saying, [...] "you might as well bombard the Rocky Mountains." [...] If there were ever {{to be a successful}} siege, it would have to starve the garrison into submission.|$|E
2500|$|Negotiations for the writer's return {{came to an}} end {{after the}} {{publication}} of his Memoirs (Воспоминания, 1950), full of scathing criticism of Soviet cultural life. Apparently aware of his own negativism, Bunin wrote: [...] "I was born too late. If I had been born earlier, my literary memoirs would have been different. I wouldn't have been a witness to 1905, the First World War, then 1917 and what followed: Lenin, Stalin, Hitler... How can I not be jealous of our forefather Noah. He lived through only one flood in his lifetime". Reportedly, the infamous Zhdanov decree {{was one of the reasons}} for Bunin's change of mind. On 15 September 1947, Bunin wrote to Mark Aldanov: [...] "I have a letter here from Teleshov, written on September 7; 'what a pity (he writes) that you've missed all of this: how your book was set up, how everybody was waiting <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>here,</b> in the place where you could have been... rich, feasted, and held in such high honour!' Having read this I spent an hour hair-tearing. Then I suddenly became calm. It just came to me all of a sudden all those other things Zhdanov and Fadeev might have given me instead of feasts, riches and laurels..." ...|$|E

2500|$|The gradobranitelj in Bukor in the 1950s was Trivun Selenić. Perceiving {{that there}} might be hail, he would go behind the village, wave his arms toward the cloud, and speak the {{following}} (the meaning of the italicized words is unclear): [...] "Raviše đaviše, nađuniši pistols, the dress on silver, the girl onto the neck! Barbarian's head smashed! I am the first voivode here. The dinner is not served <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>here.</b> Go there to those hills. It is served there for you. So dine there." [...] Trivun explained that hail clouds were led by devils accompanied by souls of the drowned and hanged. By the statement [...] "I am the first voivode here" [...] he would proclaim that he was the principal commander of devils, who consequently had to obey his commands and proceed around his village. Trivun recognized that all this was a sin: both his declaring himself a voivode of devils, and averting hail from his village, because it would fall and make damage at some other place. Miljko Ivković from Dobrići spoke nothing, but went onto the field, took his cap off, made the Sign of the Cross, and put the cap back on. After that, he three times made {{the sign of the cross}} with a knife in the direction of the cloud, thus cutting it into quarters, which he then drove apart. In the end he stuck the knife's handle into the ground, the blade turned toward the cloud.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} day a pro-Syrian demonstration {{set a new}} record when Hezbollah amassed 400–500 thousand protestors at Riad Solh square in Beirut, most of them bussed in from the heavily Shi'ite south Lebanon and eastern Beka'a valley. [...] The show of power demonstrated Hezbollah's influence, wealth and organization as the sole Lebanese party allowed to hold a militia by Syria. [...] In his speech Nasrallah blasted UN Security-Council Resolution 1559, which calls for Hezbollah's militia to be disbanded, as foreign intervention. [...] Nasrallah also reiterated his earlier calls {{for the destruction of}} Israel saying [...] "To this enemy we say again: There is no place <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>here</b> and there is no life for you among us. Death to Israel!". [...] Though Hezbollah organized a very successful rally, opposition leaders were {{quick to point out that}} Hezbollah had active support from Lebanon's government and Syria. [...] While the pro-democracy rallies had to deal with road blocks forcing protestors to either turn back or march long distances to Martyr's Square, Hezbollah was able to bus people directly to Riad Solh square. [...] Dory Chamoun, an opposition leader, pointed out that [...] "the difference is that in our demonstrations, people arrive voluntarily and on foot, not in buses". [...] Another opposition member said the pro-Syrian government pressured people to turn out and some reports said Syria had bused in people from across the border. But on a mountain road leading to Beirut, only one bus with a Syrian license plate was spotted in a convoy of pro-Syrian supporters heading to the capital and Hezbollah officials denied the charges.|$|E
2500|$|Most pulque is {{consumed}} in bars called pulquerías. At {{the beginning of}} the 20th century, more than 1,000 were located in Mexico City alone. By the early 20th century, pulquerías became socially accepted, and some were places of great elegance. But whether for rich or poor, two features stood out among these establishments: odd or catchy names, and murals decorating the walls. Names included (translated) [...] "My Office", [...] "Memories of the Future", [...] "Drink and Go", I'm Waiting <b>for</b> <b>You</b> <b>Here</b> at the Corner", and, {{across the street from the}} National Chamber of Deputies, [...] "The Recreation Center of Those Across the Street". Diego Rivera once said one of the most important manifestations of Mexican painting was the murals that decorated the facades and interiors of pulquerías. One tradition maintained at all pulquerias at {{the beginning of the}} 20th century was to put sawdust on the floor. The tradition at that time was to begin a pulque-drinking session by spilling a little on the floor or ground as an offering to Mother Earth. [...] Traditional pulquerías tend to be like clubs with closed membership, with casual visitors ignored or sometimes stared at. Frequent visits and large consumption of the drink tends to win acceptance. While some establishments may forbid women, it is much more common for the establishment to provide a separate seating area for them. Intermingling of the sexes is not permitted. In the more rural areas of Hidalgo and Tlaxcala, where most pulque is made, the pulque is fresher and better. A vendor usually displays a white flag over the door when a fresh shipment has arrived.|$|E
