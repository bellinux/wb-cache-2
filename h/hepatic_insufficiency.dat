40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} {{study was conducted}} to investigate seroprevalence of canine leptospirosis in urban Harare and five selected rural communities in Zimbabwe and to assess public awareness of the disease. Sera from randomly selected dogs were tested for antibodies to the serovars Canicola, Grippotyphosa, Icterohaemorrhagiae and Pomona of Leptospira interrogans using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Clinical chemistry was performed on all seropositive and selected seronegative sera to screen for <b>hepatic</b> and renal <b>insufficiency.</b> A questionnaire- based survey was conducted in Harare to assess dog owners’ awareness of leptospirosis and other zoonoses. Overall, 15. 6 % of sera samples tested (39 out of 250; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 11. 0 % – 20. 2 %) were positive for leptospiral antibodies. A significantly higher (p < 0. 05) seroprevalence was recorded in urban dogs than in rural dogs (25 % vs. 11. 2 %). No significant difference in seroprevalence was observed amongst dogs from different rural communities or between sexes of dogs. There was a significant association between seropositivity and <b>hepatic</b> and/or renal <b>insufficiency</b> (p < 0. 01), with dogs having <b>hepatic</b> and/or renal <b>insufficiency</b> being approximately twice as likely to be seropositive (relative risk = 1. 96; 95 % CI: 1. 3 – 3. 0). Of the dog owners, 78. 8 % (119 / 151) were aware of zoonoses. Except for rabies (92. 4 %), awareness of leptospirosis (5. 0 %) and other zoonoses amongst these owners was low.

50|$|In hyperacute {{and acute}} liver failure the {{clinical}} picture develops rapidly with progressive encephalopathy and multiorgan dysfunction such as hyperdynamic circulation, coagulopathy, acute renal and respiratory insufficiency, severe metabolic alterations and cerebral edema {{that can lead}} to brain death. In these cases the mortality without liver transplantation (LTx) ranges between 40-80%. LTx is the only effective treatment for these patients although it requires a precise indication and timing to achieve good results. Nevertheless, due to the scarcity of organs to carry out liver transplantations, it is estimated that one third of patients with ALF die while waiting to be transplanted.On the other hand, a patient with a chronic hepatic disease can suffer an acute decompensation of liver function following a precipitating event such as variceal bleeding, sepsis and excessive alcohol intake among others {{that can lead to}} a condition referred to as acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF).Both types of <b>hepatic</b> <b>insufficiency,</b> ALF and ACLF, can potentially be reversible and liver functionality can return to a level similar to that prior to the insult or precipitating event.LTx is the only treatment that has shown an improvement in the prognosis and survival with most severe cases of ALF. Nevertheless, cost and donor scarcity have prompted researchers to look for new supportive treatments that can act as “bridge” to the transplant procedure. By stabilizing the patient’s clinical state, or by creating the right conditions that could allow the recovery of native liver functions, both detoxification and synthesis can improve, after an episode of ALF or ACLF.Basically, three different types of supportive therapies have been developed: bio-artificial, artificial and hybrid liver support systems (Table 2).|$|E

No anticholinergic adverse events were observed in the clinical trials with bilastine. No serious adverse events were reported during the research and there were no clinically significant changes in vital signs, electrocardiography (ECG) or laboratory tests.
