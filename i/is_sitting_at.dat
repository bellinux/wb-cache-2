In the prequel, the Doctor <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> the swings of a children's playground when he meets a little girl. They talk about losing things, and the Doctor {{states that he}} has lost someone twice and he hopes {{he might be able}} to find her again. The girl tells him that, when she loses something, she goes to a quiet place for a think, and then can remember where she put it. As the girl leaves, it is revealed that she is Clara Oswald.|$|E

As Tracy raises his coffee mug, his wrist radio sounds. He tilts his wrist to listen, {{only to have the}} coffee spill to the amusement of the cops.|$|E

500|$|The book {{is divided}} into five chapters. Each chapter {{is divided into}} five parts, each {{describing}} events {{from the perspective of}} one of the five main characters: Karen, Rick, Luke, Rachel, and Player One. The first chapter, [...] "Hour One: Cue the Flaming Zeppelin", has Karen arriving at the Toronto airport on a flight from Winnipeg to meet a man she met online. She sits on a stool at the airport hotel bar in which Rick is the bartender, Rachel is at a computer terminal, and Luke <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> a table drinking scotch. Rachel is there with the expectation to meet a man who can father her child and approaches Luke. Karen's date goes badly as she finds the man too assertive physically and too distant intellectually. A self-help guru, Leslie Freemont, enters with his assistant Tara to welcome Rick into his empowerment program; Leslie gives a speech to the group, takes Rick's money, and leaves. Meanwhile, oil prices rapidly increase and explosions start to occur outside. With the power unreliable, Karen, Rick, Luke, and Rachel run to Rick's vehicle to listen to the radio. Karen's date, Warren, is killed by a sniper as he runs to the group, who quickly return to the bar lounge where they barricade themselves in.|$|E
500|$|Linda {{comes to}} Madam Liang's {{graduation}} party from citizenship school with Linda's [...] "brother" [...] (actually the comedian from Sammy's nightclub) and presents herself as Ta's intended, with her [...] "brother" [...] giving his consent for the marriage. [...] The extroverted, Americanized woman {{is not what}} Wang has in mind for his elder son, and Wang and Ta argue. [...] Sammy Fong arrives and quickly penetrates Linda's scheme: Linda, frustrated by the five years she has been seeing Sammy, is determined to marry someone, and if Sammy won't step forward, she will settle for Ta. [...] Sammy quickly strikes back by inviting the Wangs, Mei Li and her father to watch the show at his [...] "Celestial Bar" [...] ("Fan Tan Fannie"). [...] Linda does her striptease, realizing too late who <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> the best table. [...] Sammy's special guests storm out, except for Ta, who is so humiliated {{that he does not}} know what to do. [...] He is led away by childhood friend Helen Chao, a seamstress who fits Linda's costumes for her, and whose love for Ta is unrequited. [...] Linda, goaded beyond endurance when Sammy raises his glass to her, dumps a champagne bucket over his head.|$|E
2500|$|In Ralph Bakshi's 1978 {{animated}} film, Isildur (called Prince Isildur of {{the mighty}} Kings from across the Sea) appears as {{the events of the}} Last Alliance are portrayed in silhouette. He is called [...] "the heroic shadow who slipped in" [...] to chop off the One Ring from Sauron's finger. Later, he <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> the base of a tree by the River Anduin examining the One Ring. Sensing a disturbance, he draws his sword, but is shot by Orc arrows a moment later.|$|E

2500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Fallin'", {{directed}} by Chris Robinson, Blake Johnson and Danny Wise. Unlike most other R videos, the video for [...] "Fallin'" [...] was a low-key clip with no dancing. The video {{opens with a}} radio playing [...] "Girlfriend", where Keys <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> a piano. The plot has Keys traveling to a prison to visit her incarcerated boyfriend. The plot is continued in the video for Keys' next single, [...] "A Woman's Worth", which explores what happens when Keys' boyfriend is released and, with her help, adjusts back to regular life. Keys {{said in an interview}} that she was supposed to be the one incarcerated, and her boyfriend was visiting her.|$|E
2500|$|On the February 5, 2007, {{episode of}} Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip, Cole sang [...] "I Say a Little Prayer" [...] at a benefit dinner for Harriet Hayes (Sarah Paulson). She {{can also be}} seen in the last scene of Nas' music video for [...] "Can't Forget About You". The song uses a sample of her father's song [...] "Unforgettable". Cole <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> a piano in a cabaret-style lounge mouthing her father's song with Nas {{standing}} beside her. Cole also performed [...] "Something's Gotta Give" [...] on American Idol on April 29, 2009. In September 2010, Cole performed with Andrea Bocelli in a concert at the Kodak Theatre, for his album My Christmas, in which she recorded a duet with him, and from December 10â€“13, 2009, she appeared with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and Orchestra at Temple Square in their annual Christmas concerts. Both were videotaped for presentation on PBS in December 2010.|$|E

6000|$|The {{managing}} clerk, COKESON, <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> {{his table}} adding up [...] figures in a pass-book, and murmuring their numbers to himself.

6000|$|... [The {{scene is}} the same as in the Second Act, the drawing-room at [...] Basil's house in Putney. BASIL <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> the table, with his [...] head in his hands.

60|$|THE curtain rises on a drawing-room in Mrs. Harding's {{house in}} London. Mrs. Harding <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> a table. She is sorting out parcels.

The play has to just poof itself out noiselessly.|$|E
60|$|But Polly, though {{alone in}} the deserted mansion--for there is no {{companionship}} in the shut-up rooms in which its late master hides his head--is not alone long. It is night; and she <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> work in the housekeeper's room, trying to forget what a lonely house it is, and what a history belongs to it; {{when there is a}} knock at the hall door, as loud sounding as any knock can be, striking into such an empty place. Opening it, she returns across the echoing hall, accompanied by a female figure in a close black bonnet. It is Miss Tox, and Miss Tox's eyes are red.|$|E
60|$|Nelson and I {{were sitting}} in the Overland House. It was early in the evening, and the only reason we were there was because we were broke and it was {{election}} time. You see, in election time local politicians, aspirants for office, have a way of making the rounds of the saloons to get votes. One <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> a table, in a dry condition, wondering who is going to turn up and buy him a drink, or if his credit is good at some other saloon and if it's worth while to walk that far to find out, when suddenly the saloon doors swing wide, and enters a bevy of well-dressed men, themselves usually wide and exhaling an atmosphere of prosperity and fellowship.|$|E

60|$|High rises the response, not of cackling terror, but of crowing counter-defiance, and Vive la Nation; young Valour {{streaming}} {{towards the}} Frontiers; Patrie en Danger mutely beckoning on the Pont Neuf.

Committee, self-chosen, <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> the Sign of the Golden Sun: Journalist Carra, Camille Desmoulins, Alsatian Westermann friend of Danton, American Fournier of Martinique;--a Committee not unknown to Mayor Petion, who, as an official person, must sleep with one eye open. Not unknown to Procureur Manuel; least of all to Procureur-Substitute Danton! He, wrapped in darkness, being also official, bears it on his giant shoulder; cloudy invisible Atlas of the whole.|$|E
6000|$|The [...] "Animal Kingdom" [...] {{is a book}} of {{wonderful}} merits. It was written with the highest end,--to put science and the soul, long estranged from each other, at one again. It was an anatomist's account of the human body, in the highest style of poetry. Nothing can exceed the bold and brilliant treatment of a subject usually so dry and repulsive. He saw nature [...] "wreathing through an everlasting spiral, with wheels that never dry, on axles that never creak," [...] and sometimes sought [...] "to uncover those secret recess is where nature <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> the fires {{in the depths of}} her laboratory;" [...] whilst the picture comes recommended by the hard fidelity with which it is based on practical anatomy. It is remarkable that this sublime genius decides, peremptorily for the analytic, against the synthetic method; and, in a book whose genius is a daring poetic synthesis, claims to confine himself to a rigid experience.|$|E
6000|$|Populace, it is true, seizes {{the three}} rope-bound yellow Couriers; {{will at least}} {{massacre}} them. But our august Assembly, which <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> this great moment, sends out Deputation of rescue; and the whole is got huddled up. Barnave, 'all dusty,' is already there, in the National Hall; making brief discreet address and report. As indeed, through the whole journey, this Barnave has been most discreet, sympathetic; and has gained the Queen's trust, whose noble instinct teaches her always who is to be trusted. Very different from heavy Petion; who, if Campan speak truth, ate his luncheon, comfortably filled his wine-glass, in the Royal Berline; flung out his chicken-bones past the nose of Royalty itself; and, on the King's saying [...] "France cannot be a Republic," [...] answered [...] "No, it is not ripe yet." [...] Barnave is henceforth a Queen's adviser, if advice could profit: and her Majesty astonishes Dame Campan by signifying almost a regard for Barnave: and that, in a day of retribution and Royal triumph, Barnave shall not be executed. (Campan, ii. c. 18.) ...|$|E
