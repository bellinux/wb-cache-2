5|$|Castelli {{is largely}} <b>ignored</b> <b>in</b> the historiography of Argentina. Most historians focus {{instead on the}} {{disputes}} between Mariano Moreno and Cornelio Saavedra in the Junta, with Castelli described in passing as a supporter of Moreno. Despite of {{his role in the}} May Revolution, he was not the clear leader of it, as José Gervasio Artigas was for the Cry of Asencio or Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla for the Cry of Dolores. The May Revolution was instead the result of the convergence of diverse factions that shared the desire to remove the viceroy, and different historians highlight different specific factions. Castelli is largely <b>ignored</b> <b>in</b> Bolivia as well. His support of indigenous rights—still an ongoing issue in the country—and his religious ideas strongly affect the way he is perceived there.|$|E

5|$|Some {{authors have}} dealt with {{comparative}} studies between Taoism and Christianity. This has been of interest for students of history of religion such as J.J.M. de Groot, among others.

5|$|Contradicting these claims, {{the medieval}} Annales Suecici Medii Aevi and the 13th century legend of Saint Botvid mention some Henry as the Bishop of Uppsala (Henricus scilicet Upsalensis) in 1129, {{participating}} in the consecration of the saint's newly built church. He is apparently the same Bishop Henry who died at the Battle of Fotevik in 1134, fighting along with the Danes after being banished from Sweden. Known from the Chronicon Roskildense written soon after his death and from Saxo Grammaticus' Gesta Danorum from the early 13th century, he had fled to Denmark from Sigtuna, the see of the early Uppland bishops before it was moved a few kilometers to its later location in Uppsala sometime before 1164. He is <b>ignored</b> <b>in</b> all Swedish bishop chronicles, unless he is the same Henry who was later redated to the 1150s. That would make the claim about him coming to Finland with King Eric a late innovation, where memory about a killed bishop in Uppsala sometime in the 12th century was reused in a new context.|$|E

5|$|Henry and his {{crusade to}} Finland {{were also a}} part of the legend of King Eric. The {{appendix}} of the early 13th century Västgötalagen, which has a short description of Eric's memorable deeds, also makes no reference to Henry or the crusade. Henry and the crusade are both fully present only in a version of Eric's legend that dates to 1344. Similarities in the factual content and phraseology regarding the common events indicate that either one of the legends has acted as the model for the other. Henry's legend is commonly considered to have been written during the 1280s or 1290s at the latest, for the consecration of the Cathedral of Turku in 1300, when his alleged remains were translated there from Nousiainen, a parish not far from Turku. Yet, even as late as in the 1470s, the crusade legend was <b>ignored</b> <b>in</b> the Chronica regni Gothorum, a chronicle of the history of Sweden, written by Ericus Olai, the Canon of the Uppsala cathedral.|$|E

However, he has also been credited with keeping the political effects of the September 11 attacks from harming science research—by ensuring that tighter visa controls did not hinder the movement of those engaged in scientific research—and with increasing awareness of the relationship between science and government.

5|$|Meanwhile, in the Arab world, by 900 {{the great}} Greek herbals had been {{translated}} and copies lodged in centres {{of learning in}} the Byzantine empire of the eastern Mediterranean including Byzantium, Damascus, Cairo and Baghdad where they were combined with the botanical and pharmacological lore of the Orient.

In Lactantius' account, when Diocletian announced that he was to resign, the entire crowd turned to face Constantine. It was not to be: Severus and Maximin were declared caesars. Maximin appeared and took Diocletian's robes. On the same day, Severus received his robes from Maximian in Milan.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. Most {{of us are}} familiar with the decline in visual perception that comes with age. What is more surprising is that we also become worse at ignoring distractions. This ability to orient our minds to the most pressing inputs and exclude irrelevant information is vital to be able to function in our jobs, homes and leisure. Research has often focused on the consequences of attention to objects or locations. Recent findings, however, suggest that irrelevant information is not simply left unattended but under some conditions must be purposefully filtered out: a process of actively <b>ignoring.</b> <b>In</b> this project I will examine the functional and neural mechanisms of actively <b>ignoring</b> <b>in</b> young and old participants. I will investigate whether the decrease in the visibility of images that happens with ageing interacts with people’s capacity to actively ignore. Somewhat counter-intuitively, recent results have suggested that less visible images are more difficult to actively ignore. This project will use both brain imaging techniques (fMRI) and studies of behaviour to investigate whether ageing is associated with a change in strategy, a decline in perceptual abilities or a more general decline in abilities...|$|R
