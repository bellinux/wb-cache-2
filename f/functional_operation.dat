500|$|Botany (Greek [...] - grass, fodder; Medieval Latin [...] – herb, plant) and zoology are, historically, {{the core}} {{disciplines}} of biology whose history is {{closely associated with}} the natural sciences chemistry, physics and geology. A distinction can be made between botanical science in a pure sense, as the study of plants themselves, and botany as applied science, which studies the human use of plants. Early natural history divided pure botany into three main streams morphology-classification, anatomy and physiology – that is, external form, internal structure, and <b>functional</b> <b>operation.</b> The most obvious topics in applied botany are horticulture, forestry and agriculture although there are many others like weed science, plant pathology, floristry, pharmacognosy, economic botany and ethnobotany which lie outside modern courses in botany.

Modern molecular systematics, for example, entails the principles and techniques of taxonomy, molecular biology, computer science and more.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Highly regular {{data can}} be {{represented}} succinctly by various kinds of implicit data structures. Many problems in P {{are known to be}} hard if their input is given as circuit or Ordered Binary Decision Diagram (OBDD). Nevertheless, in practical areas like CAD and Model Checking, symbolic algorithms using <b>functional</b> <b>operations</b> on OBDD-represented data are well-established. Their theoretical analysis has mostly been restricted to the number of <b>functional</b> <b>operations</b> yet. We show that Pcomplete problems have no symbolic algorithms using a polylogarithmic number of <b>functional</b> <b>operations,</b> unless P=NC. Moreover, we complement PSPACE-hardness results for problems on OBDD-represented inputs by fixed-parameter intractability results, where the OBDD width serves as the fixed parameter. ...|$|R

40|$|Java 8 {{introduces}} two functional features: lambda {{expressions and}} <b>functional</b> <b>operations</b> like map or filter that apply a lambda expression over {{the elements of}} a Collection. Refactoring existing code to use these new features enables explicit but unobtrusive parallelism and makes the code more succinct. However, refactoring is tedious: it requires changing many lines of code. It is also error-prone: the programmer must reason about the control-, data-flow, and side-effects. Fortunately, refactorings can be automated. We designed and implemented LambdaFicator, a tool which automates two refactorings. The first refactoring converts anonymous inner classes to lambda expressions. The second refactoring converts for loops that iterate over Collections to <b>functional</b> <b>operations</b> that use lambda expressions. Using 9 open-source projects, we have applied these two refactorings 1263 and 1709 times, respectively. The results show that LambdaFicator is useful: (i) it is widely applicable, (ii) it reduces the code bloat, (iii) it increases programmer productivity, and (iv) it is accurate...|$|R

40|$|With {{advancement}} {{in the development}} of the new laboratory instruments and experimental techniques, the protein data has an explosive increasing rate. Therefore how to efficiently store, retrieve and modify protein data is becoming a challenging issue that most biological scientists have to face and solve. Traditional data models such as relational database lack of support for complex data types, which is a big issue for protein data application. Hence many scientists switch to the object-oriented databases since object-oriented nature of life science data perfectly matches the architecture of object-oriented databases, but there are still a lot of problems that need to be solved in order to apply OODB methodologies to manage protein data. One major problem is that the general-purpose OODBs do not have any built-in data types for biological research and built-in biological domain-specific <b>functional</b> <b>operations.</b> In this dissertation, we present an application system with built-in data types and built-in biological domain-specific <b>functional</b> <b>operations</b> that extends the Object-Oriented Database (OODB) system by adding domain-specific additional layers Protein-QL, Protein Algebra Architecture an...|$|R

In order to use randomization, we investigate the OBDD complexity of 2 ^n (almost) k-wise independent binary random variables. We give a OBDD construction of size O(n) for 3 -wise independent random variables and show a lower bound of 2 ^Ω(n) on the OBDD size for k ≥ 4. The best known lower bound was Ω(2 ^n/n) for k ≈ n due to Kabanets.

40|$|Scan-based tests allow {{a circuit}} to enter {{states that the}} circuit does not visit during <b>functional</b> <b>operation.</b> Testing a circuit using {{nonfunctional}} broadside tests will cause overtesting of delay faults, which may cause a good chip to fail the test due to functionally infeasible paths or excessive power demand that would not occur during <b>functional</b> <b>operation.</b> Functional broadside tests only allow reachable states, which the circuit can enter during <b>functional</b> <b>operation,</b> as scan-in states in order to eliminate overtesting. However, the exclusive use of functional broadside tests will cause a loss of fault coverage, which might lead to reliability issues. Partially-functional broadside tests are designed to improve the fault coverage achievable by using functional broadside tests. ^ Partially-functional broadside tests allow unreachable states to be scanned in, but they require a known Hamming distance between an unreachable scan-in state and a reachable state. In this way, they guarantee measurable deviations from <b>functional</b> <b>operation</b> conditions while tests are applied. In this thesis, a close-to-complete test generation procedure for partially-functional broadside tests targeting transition faults is described for both synchronizable circuits and non-synchronizable circuits. This procedure is guaranteed to find a test for every detectable fault, while targeting the test with a low Hamming distance from a reachable state. Experimental results show {{that it is possible}} to generate a test set that achieves the same fault coverage as a broadside test set with unconstrained scan-in states. The switching activity is used as an indirect indicator of the deviation from <b>functional</b> <b>operation</b> conditions while applying the tests. ...|$|E
