25|$|Knudsen's {{success at}} Pontiac {{led to his}} {{promotion}} to general manager of Chevrolet Division in 1961. While at Pontiac he was noted for his interest in performance, and this continued {{with the introduction of}} the Chevrolet Super Sport models. He also insisted on changes to improve the safety of the Chevrolet Corvair, which was not reported publicly until it was revealed by John DeLorean in his book On a Clear <b>Day</b> <b>You</b> Can See General Motors. Knudsen also reportedly rejected an idea to offer a Pontiac version of the revolutionary Corvair in favor a front-engine compact car to be offered by Oldsmobile (as the F-85) and Buick (as the Special) for 1961. Pontiac introduced its version of the Buick-Olds-Pontiac compact as the Tempest for 1961, but gave that car some unique engineering features such as a slanted four-cylinder engine (which was really half of a Pontiac 389 V8), rear swing axles and a rear transaxle (both derived from the Corvair) driven by a flexing shaft to eliminate the driveshaft hump for increased interior space.|$|E
500|$|The {{first single}} from {{the album was}} [...] "The <b>Day</b> <b>You</b> Come", a {{politically}} and socially influenced song. The band did not intend {{for it to be}} the first single, and released it only when they could not decide on anything else. Haug said it being [...] "a pretty inoffensive song musically" [...] helped Powderfinger make that decision. [...] "The <b>Day</b> <b>You</b> Come" [...] spent nine weeks on the ARIA Charts, peaking at #25.|$|E
500|$|In 1999, [...] "The <b>Day</b> <b>You</b> Come" [...] was {{nominated}} {{to win the}} [...] "Song of the Year" [...] APRA Award from the Australasian Performing Right Association, and [...] "Passenger" [...] won the same award the following year. The same year, the tracks [...] "Already Gone", [...] "Good-Day Ray" [...] and [...] "Passenger" [...] all featured in Triple J's Hottest 100 list, and [...] "Don't Wanna Be Left Out" [...] and [...] "The <b>Day</b> <b>You</b> Come" [...] featured in the list in 1998.

500|$|Numerous {{songs on}} Internationalist were {{politically}} and socially influenced, although the band denied {{it being a}} deliberate motif. Fanning explaining that the band did not intentionally discuss political issues, saying [...] "we don't try to do anything in particular". He noted, however, that the songs, as his emotional responses to recent events, could inevitably be interpreted as being political. When [...] "The <b>Day</b> <b>You</b> Come" [...] was released, there was speculation that it alluded to Pauline Hanson's One Nation political party, although the band claimed the song was vague and didn't specifically refer to one person.

500|$|On 7 September 1998, Powderfinger {{released}} {{their third}} studio album, Internationalist, which peaked at No.1 and spent 101 {{weeks in the}} Top50 of the ARIA Albums Chart; it was produced by Nick DiDia (Rage Against the Machine, Pearl Jam). AllMusic's Jonathan Lewis had mixed feelings about the album. He was enchanted by its lead single, [...] "The <b>Day</b> <b>You</b> Come", however [...] "the rest of the album didn't measure up" [...] except for [...] "some fine tracks" [...] in [...] "Don't Wanna Be Left Out" [...] and [...] "Already Gone". Nevertheless, by 2007 the album had shipped over 350,000 copies and was certified five times platinum domestically, and had reached European audiences. Internationalist was the first Powderfinger album to win any ARIA Music Awards. At the 1999 ceremony it won [...] "Album of the Year", [...] "Best Rock Album" [...] and [...] "Best Cover Art" [...] (by Kevin Wilkins), and [...] "The <b>Day</b> <b>You</b> Come" [...] won [...] "Single of the Year". [...] "Passenger", another single from Internationalist, was nominated for three additional categories in the following year. The band was both praised and criticised for their political views on Internationalist. In a November 1998 interview with Benedict Watts of Juice Magazine, Haug said that political messages in [...] "The <b>Day</b> <b>You</b> Come" [...] were not something they were just preaching about, but rather were something they saw as a responsibility.|$|E
500|$|Internationalist {{followed}} {{in the success of}} its predecessor, Double Allergic, and was certified five times platinum in Australia. Internationalist received four ARIA Music Awards, including [...] "Album of the Year". The album produced four singles for the band; [...] "The <b>Day</b> <b>You</b> Come", [...] "Don't Wanna Be Left Out/Good-Day Ray", [...] "Already Gone" [...] and [...] "Passenger", which all appeared on Triple J's Hottest 100 poll in two consecutive years.|$|E

500|$|In {{between the}} annual {{shooting}} of Dad's Army, Le Mesurier acted in films, including {{the role of}} the prison governor opposite Noël Coward in the 1969 Peter Collinson-directed The Italian Job. The cinema historian Amy Sargeant likened Le Mesurier's role to the [...] "mild demeanour" [...] of his Sergeant Wilson character. In 1970, Le Mesurier appeared in Ralph Thomas's Doctor in Trouble as the purser; he also made an appearance in Vincente Minnelli's On a Clear <b>Day</b> <b>You</b> Can See Forever, a romantic fantasy musical.|$|E
500|$|Internationalist debuted {{at the top}} of the ARIA Albums Chart, and was {{certified}} gold in {{its first}} week, selling over 35,000 copies.

At the 1999 ARIA Awards, the album received three awards—"Album of the Year", [...] "Best Rock Album", and [...] "Best Cover Art".

500|$|... "Like a Dog" [...] was {{released}} {{as the third}} single on 15 January 2001. The song was heavy in political sentiment, akin to [...] "The <b>Day</b> <b>You</b> Come" [...] on Internationalist. The riff for the song was written by Ian Haug, and the song's music video featured Australian Aboriginal boxer Anthony Mundine, and {{was based on the}} 1980 Martin Scorsese film Raging Bull. Drummer Jon Coghill said the song revolved around the question of [...] "why the hell won’t John Howard say sorry to the Aboriginal people!" [...] "Like a Dog" [...] spent one week on the ARIA Singles Chart, at #40.|$|E

500|$|In {{selecting}} which {{single to}} release first, Usher and the label considered various marketing strategies.

Meanwhile, they felt [...] "Burn" [...] also failed to meet their expectations: [...] "'Burn' being a great song is one thing, but it's one of them things where people said, 'It's strong, but can we make history with that?'

50|$|The break-even {{algorithm}} instructs you to {{rent for}} 9 days and buy skis {{on the morning}} of <b>day</b> 10 if <b>you</b> are still up for skiing. If you have to stop skiing during the first 9 days, it costs the same as what you would pay if you had known the number of <b>days</b> <b>you</b> would go skiing. If you have to stop skiing after day 10, your cost is $19 which is 90% more than what you would pay if you had known the number of <b>days</b> <b>you</b> would go skiing in advance. This is the worst case for the break-even algorithm.|$|R
50|$|Yes. For example, you can flip a coin. If {{it comes}} up head, you buy skis on <b>day</b> 8; otherwise, <b>you</b> buy skis on day 10. This is an {{instance}} of a randomized algorithm. It {{is easy to see}} that the expected cost is at most 80% more than what you would pay if you had known the number of <b>days</b> <b>you</b> would go skiing, regardless of how many <b>days</b> <b>you</b> ski. In particular, if you ski for 10 days, then your expected cost is 1/2 +10 + 1/2 9+10 = 18 dollars, only 80% excess instead of 90%.|$|R
