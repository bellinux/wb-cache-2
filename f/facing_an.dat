Marchington's time with the Flying Scotsman was documented in a documentary, the Channel 4 programme A Steamy Affair: The Story of Flying Scotsman.|$|E

5|$|In 1884 the DF renamed {{itself the}} Social Democratic Federation (SDF) and {{underwent}} an internal reorganisation. However, {{the group was}} <b>facing</b> <b>an</b> internal schism between those (such as Hyndman), who argued for a parliamentary path toward socialism, and those (like Morris) who deemed the Houses of Parliament intrinsically corrupt and capitalist. Personal issues between Morris and Hyndman were exacerbated by their attitude to British foreign policy; Morris was staunchly anti-imperialist while Hyndman expressed patriotic sentiment encouraging some foreign intervention. The division {{between the two groups}} developed into open conflict, with the majority of activists sharing Morris' position. In December 1884 Morris and his supporters – most notably Ernest Belfort Bax and Edward Aveling – left the SDF; the first major schism of the British socialist movement.|$|E
5|$|Just as they {{finished}} their report, the detachment was fired on by Ustaše Militia. The Ustaše called {{for help from}} Sinj, and by 18:00, Italian reinforcements had arrived and began encircling the detachment, engaging them with mortars and light artillery. Outnumbered and <b>facing</b> <b>an</b> enemy with greater firepower, the Partisans planned to hold their positions until evening then retreat using the cover of darkness. About 20:00, Kovačević-Lala, {{one of the most}} experienced members of the detachment, was killed after being hit by a mortar round, which had a significant effect on the morale of the remaining fighters. Borovčić-Kurir issued the order to retreat, but it turned into chaos as individuals fled the area.|$|E
5|$|Just {{behind the}} Greyfriars turret is the islet of Helgeandsholmen, where the {{northern}} city gate and defensive wall were located.

King Gustav Vasa had all the charitable institutions in the city merged into a single one housed in the former Greyfriars monastery on Riddarholmen, so the monasteries in the painting were all the possession of the crown when the painting was produced.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 14 February, Blücher, {{commanding}} a Prussian Corps and elements of two Russian Corps, resumed his attack against Marmont. The latter continued to fall back until he was reinforced. Napoleon arrived on the battlefield with strong combined-arms forces, which allowed the French to launch a determined counterattack and drive back the leading elements of the Army of Silesia. Blücher {{realized that he was}} facing the Emperor in person and decided to pull back and avoid another battle against Napoleon. In practice, Blücher's attempt to disengage proved extremely difficult to execute, as the Coalition force was by now in an advanced position, had virtually no cavalry present to cover its retreat and was <b>facing</b> <b>an</b> enemy who was ready to commit its numerous cavalry.|$|E
5|$|Burchard, {{along with}} Marshal {{and other members}} of the chapter, were often opposed to the actions of their {{archbishop}}. They objected to the archbishop having given a large part of York's treasury towards Richard's ransom, and to some of the archiepiscopal appointments in the church of York. Burchard and the others charged Geoffrey with simony, extortion, and neglect of his duties and the archbishop in return excommunicated the ringleaders more than once, and locked the canons out of church. The disputes flared up in 1192, with Burchard <b>facing</b> <b>an</b> effort by Geoffrey to replace him in the treasurership with Hamo, but the dispute was resolved by the gift of a church to Hamo by Burchard and Hamo's relinquishing of any claim to the treasurership. At another dispute, Geoffrey had confiscated the revenues of Burchard's offices, along with the revenues of Marshal, Peter de Ros the Archdeacon of Carlisle, and the canons Hugh Murdac and Adam of Thornover. Geoffrey refused to restore the incomes unless the offenders came barefoot into York Minster and begged for the archbishop's forgiveness. This all but Marshal did and they had their official revenues restored.|$|E
5|$|Chappell became South Australian captain {{when the}} long-serving Les Favell retired {{at the start}} of the 1970–1971 season. His younger brother Greg made his debut in the second Test of the summer against Ray Illingworth's England. <b>Facing</b> <b>an</b> English attack led by the hostile fast bowling of John Snow, Chappell scored a half-century in each of the first two Tests, but failed to {{capitalise}} on good starts while Greg Chappell scored 108 in his initial innings. Rain caused the abandonment of the third Test without a ball being bowled. Temporarily promoted to open the batting, Chappell failed in the fourth Test as Australia lost. In the fifth Test at Melbourne, he returned to number three and started nervously. Dropped on 0 and 14, Chappell found form and went on to post his maiden Ashes century (111 from 212 balls), which he followed with scores of 28 and 104 in the sixth Test.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, the U.S. {{trucking}} industry employed 1.8million {{drivers of}} heavy trucks. A {{major problem for}} the long-haul trucking industry is that {{a large percentage of}} these drivers are aging, and are expected to retire. Very few new hires are expected in the near future, resulting in a driver shortage. , within the long-haul sector, there is an estimated shortage of 20,000 drivers. That shortage was projected to increase to 111,000 by 2014, however the actual shortage of truck drivers in 2014 was around 38,000. The trucking industry (especially the long-haul sector) is also <b>facing</b> <b>an</b> image crisis due to the long working hours, long periods of time away from home, the dangerous nature of the work, and the average earnings compared to other forms of labor (such as construction, which was 1 percent higher than trucking in 2004).|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1930s, Chicago Black Hawks {{owner and}} staunch American {{nationalist}} Frederic McLaughlin commanded his general manager {{to compile a}} team of only American players; at the time, Taffy Abel was the only American-born player who was a regular player in the league. With eight out of 14 players Americans, the Black Hawks won only 14 of 48 games. In the playoffs, however, the Hawks upset the Canadiens, New York Americans, and the Maple Leafs to become the only team in NHL history to win the Stanley Cup despite a losing regular-season record. In the 1942 Stanley Cup Finals, the heavily favoured Toronto Maple Leafs were <b>facing</b> <b>an</b> upset, having fallen 3–0 in the seven-game series to the fifth-place Detroit Red Wings. Toronto rebounded, and won the next four games to capture the Stanley Cup, becoming {{the first of four}} teams in the NHL to come back from a 3–0 series deficit and the only team to accomplish that in the Stanley Cup Finals.|$|E
5|$|MacLaren {{began the}} 1902 season well and, <b>facing</b> <b>an</b> Ashes series against Australia, began {{planning}} for the Tests; he arranged to receive reports on prospective players from both sides. England dominated the first Test, scoring 376 and bowling Australia out for 36; rain prevented a result and also heavily curtailed the drawn second Test. The team for the third Test, played in Sheffield, was to be chosen from 12 players picked by the selectors, with the final place contested between Bill Lockwood and Schofield Haigh. However, {{on the morning of}} the match, MacLaren, with the approval of the selector Lord Hawke, summoned Barnes from Manchester to play instead of either. The move was unpopular with spectators—their favoured choice, Haigh, was a Yorkshire player—but Barnes took six wickets in the first innings, although injury reduced his effectiveness in the second innings. England were bowled out in poor light—MacLaren's biographer Michael Down suggests that part of the blame lies with him for not appealing against the light—and needed an unlikely 339 runs to win in their second innings. MacLaren changed the batting order, asking Gilbert Jessop to open the batting. Jessop scored fifty, and MacLaren scored 63, but England lost by 143 runs.|$|E
40|$|The US Department of Energy has {{formulated}} various sets {{of gasoline}} fuels, called fuels for advanced combustion engines (FACE), which are consistent in composition and properties. The analysis of heating and evaporation of <b>FACE</b> <b>A</b> gasoline fuel (paraffin-rich) is studied by replacing the 66 components with 19 components to represent this fuel. The {{reduction in the}} number of components is based on merging components from the same chemical groups and having the same chemical formula, which have very close thermophysical properties; the components with the highest initial compositions are chosen to be the representative components. Modelling of heating and evaporation of <b>FACE</b> <b>A</b> gasoline fuel and various surrogates is carried out based on the effective thermal conductivity/effective diffusivity model (ETC/ED). The model takes into account the effect of finite liquid thermal conductivity, finite liquid mass diffusivity and recirculation inside the droplets due to their non-zero velocities relative to the ambient air. Four surrogates of <b>FACE</b> <b>A</b> found in the literature are used in the analysis. These surrogates include the five component surrogate chosen for its ability to match the ignition delay time of the <b>FACE</b> <b>A</b> gasoline fuel (Surr 1), the primary reference fuel surrogate (PRF 84) that matches the research octane number (RON) of <b>FACE</b> <b>A,</b> the one that matches hydrogen-to-carbon ratio (H/C), RON, density and distillation curve with <b>FACE</b> <b>A</b> (Surr 2), and the one that matches the RON based on mole fraction linear blending (Surr 3). It is shown that these surrogates cannot predict adequately the time evolution of surface temperatures and radii of <b>FACE</b> <b>A</b> droplets. New „physical‟ surrogates with 8, 7 and 6 components (Surr 4, Surr 5, and Surr 6) are introduced to match the evaporation characteristics of <b>FACE</b> <b>A.</b> It is found that Surr 5 (7 components surrogate) can predict droplet lifetime and time evolution of surface temperature of <b>a</b> <b>FACE</b> <b>A</b> droplet with errors of up to 5 % and 0. 25 %, respectively. Also, the results show that the H/C, molecular weight and RON of the new surrogates are reasonably close to those of <b>FACE</b> <b>A.</b> These results allow us to recommend that <b>FACE</b> <b>A</b> gasoline fuel can be replaced by the 7 component surrogate that matches H/C, molecular weight, and the RON of <b>FACE</b> <b>A,</b> and adequately predicts the lifetime and surface temperatures of this particular fuel droplet...|$|R

5|$|In {{the course}} of the gradual decline and {{dissolution}} of the Western Roman Empire in the early 5th century, the Germanic tribe of the Vandals, allied with the Alans, had established themselves in the Iberian peninsula. In 429, the Roman governor of the Diocese of Africa, Bonifacius, who had rebelled against the West Roman emperor Valentinian III (r. 425–455) and was <b>facing</b> <b>an</b> invasion by imperial troops, called upon the Vandalic King Geiseric for aid. Thus, in May 429, Geiseric crossed the straits of Gibraltar with his entire people, reportedly 80,000 in total. Geiseric's Vandals and Alans, however, had their own plans, and aimed to conquer the African provinces outright. Their possession of Mauretania Caesariensis, Mauretania Sitifensis and most of Numidia was recognized in 435 by the Western Roman court, but this was only a temporary expedient. Warfare soon recommenced, and in October 439, the capital of Africa, Carthage, fell to the Vandals. In 442, another treaty exchanged the provinces hitherto held by the Vandals with the core of the African diocese, the rich provinces of Zeugitana and Byzacena, which the Vandals received no longer as foederati of the Empire, but as their own possessions. These events marked the foundation of the Vandalic Kingdom, as the Vandals made Carthage their capital and settled around it. Although the Vandals now gained control of the lucrative African grain trade with Italy, they also launched raids on the coasts of the Mediterranean that ranged as far as the Aegean Sea and culminated in their sack of Rome itself in 455, which allegedly lasted for two weeks. Taking advantage of the chaos that followed Valentinian's death in 455, Geiseric then regained control—albeit rather tenuous—of the Mauretanian provinces, and with his fleet took over Sardinia, Corsica and the Balearic Islands. Sicily barely escaped the same fate through the presence there of Ricimer.|$|E
5|$|Kimlinger of Anime News Network {{said that}} while Naruto's initial fight scenes are lacking {{conviction}} when compared to others, his encounter with Gaara {{is one of his}} best moments because its tactics surpassed most shōnen stereotypes. ANN's Theron Martin and Mania Entertainment's Justin Rich made similar comments. The character's final fight against Sasuke at the end of Part I attracted similar responses, due to the fighting styles employed, and the character development resulting from their rivalry. The enormous physical changes caused by the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox have also been the focus of critics, as Naruto's loss of control causes him to become a bigger threat to his loved ones than other series' antagonists. Carlo Santos of ANN commented on the character's growth in Part II, specifically his fight against Pain in which Naruto's comments on peace, and the means by which it is achieved, touch on philosophical themes never seen in a shōnen series. Chris Beveridge of Mania Entertainment noted a change in Naruto's attitude as he acts calmly and more seriously than in previous story arcs. Naruto's new Senjutsu style was praised, as was his careful preparation for the fight against Pain, which resulted in a detailed display of his skills. Allega Frank from Polygon noted that during the start of both the manga and anime Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, multiple fans were worried in regards to a flashforward; in this sequence an older Boruto is <b>facing</b> <b>an</b> enemy named Kawaki who implies Naruto might be dead so his fate left them worried. Singer Diana Garnet expressed her pleasure at recording one of the ending theme songs for the animated series of Naruto Shippuden stating that not only she has been a fan of the series ever since she was younger, but was also motivated by Naruto's character because of his determination not to give up no matter what challenge he faced.|$|E

5|$|The {{deepening}} {{economic crisis}} caused a marked deterioration in {{quality of life}} of ordinary citizens and resulted in increasing political instability. Rationing and queuing became a way of life, with ration cards (kartki) necessary to buy basic consumer staples. The ration cards were utilized by the government in order to avoid allowing market regulation of income and prices and thus risking social unrest. As Western institutions were no longer willing to extend credit policies to the de facto bankrupt Polish government, access to goods the Poles needed became even more restricted. Most of the available scarce resources of Western currency had to be used to pay the crushing rates on Poland's foreign debt, which reached US$27 billion by 1980 and increased to US$45 billion in 1989. The government, which controlled all official foreign trade, responded by continuing to maintain a highly artificial exchange rate with Western currencies. The exchange rate worsened distortions in the economy at all levels, resulting in a growing black market {{and the development of a}} shortage economy. The omnipresent and destructive underground economy was characterized by phenomena such as bribery, waiting lists, speculation, direct exchanges between enterprises and large percentages of personal incomes deriving from secondary activities. Societal degradation was accompanied by unprecedented deterioration in the areas of biological environment and physical and mental health, which included steadily increasing mortality rates. In the late 1980s, the PZPR feared another social explosion because of high inflation, depressed living standards and deepening public anger and frustration. The authorities themselves, <b>facing</b> <b>an</b> increasingly disorderly and unmanageable system, felt perplexed and powerless.|$|E
