40|$|The risk of {{cardiovascular}} disease and atherosclerosis progression is significantly increased after menopause, {{probably due to the}} decrease of estrogen levels. The use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for prevention {{of cardiovascular}} disease in older postmenopausal failed to meet expectations. Phytoestrogens may induce some improvements in climacteric symptoms, but their effect on the progression of atherosclerosis remains unclear. The reduction of cholesterol accumulation at the cellular level should lead to inhibition of the atherosclerotic process in the arterial wall. The inhibition of intracellular lipid deposition with isoflavonoids was suggested as the effective way for the prevention of plaque formation in the arterial wall. The aim of this double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study was to investigate the effect of an isoflavonoid-rich <b>herbal</b> <b>preparation</b> on atherosclerosis progression in postmenopausal women free of overt cardiovascular disease. One hundred fifty-seven healthy postmenopausal women (age 65 ± 6) were randomized to a 500 mg isoflavonoid-rich <b>herbal</b> <b>preparation</b> containing tannins from grape seeds, green tea leaves, hop cone powder, and garlic powder, or placebo. Conventional cardiovascular risk factors and intima-media thickness of common carotid arteries (cIMT) were evaluated at the baseline and after 12 months of treatment. After 12 -months follow-up, total cholesterol decreased by 6. 3 % in isoflavonoid-rich <b>herbal</b> <b>preparation</b> recipients (p = 0. 011) and by 5. 2 % in placebo recipients (p = 0. 020); low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol decreased by 7. 6 % in isoflavonoid-rich <b>herbal</b> <b>preparation</b> recipients (p = 0. 040) and by 5. 2 % in placebo recipients (non-significant, NS); high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol decreased by 3. 4 % in isoflavonoid-rich <b>herbal</b> <b>preparation</b> recipients (NS) and by 4. 5 % in placebo recipients (p = 0. 038); triglycerides decreased by 6. 0 % in isoflavonoid-rich <b>herbal</b> <b>preparation</b> recipients (NS) and by 7. 1 % in placebo recipients (NS). The differences between lipid changes in the isoflavonoid-rich <b>herbal</b> <b>preparation</b> and placebo recipients did not reach statistical significance (p > 0. 05). Nevertheless, the mean cIMT progression was significantly lower in isoflavonoid-rich <b>herbal</b> <b>preparation</b> recipients as compared to the placebo group (6 μm, or < 1 %, versus 100 μm, or 13 %; p < 0. 001 for the difference). The growth of existing atherosclerotic plaques in isoflavonoid-rich <b>herbal</b> <b>preparation</b> recipients was inhibited by 1. 5 -fold (27 % versus 41 % in the placebo group). The obtained results demonstrate that the use of isoflavonoid-rich <b>herbal</b> <b>preparation</b> in postmenopausal women may suppress the formation of new atherosclerotic lesions and reduce the progression of existing ones, thus promising new drug for anti-atherosclerotic therapy. Nevertheless, further studies are required to confirm these findings...|$|R
40|$|Jubi Formula ® is a <b>herbal</b> <b>preparation</b> {{made from}} three {{medicinal}} herbs (Parquetina nigrescens, Sorghum bicolor and Harungana madagascariensis). It {{has been reported}} to have been successfully used in the treatment of anaemia in humans. A study was therefore carried out to determine the effect of the preparation on packed cell volume (PCV) and haemoglobin (Hb) concentrations in anaemic rabbits. The PCV and Hb concentrations of healthy rabbits infected with Trypanosoma brucei brucei were monitored for 49 days. T. b. brucei produced a significant reduction in PCV and Hb concentrations in all infected rabbits when compared with the controls (p< 0. 05).

40|$|Background: Indigenous {{medicinal}} {{practice in}} Sri Lanka talks about powerful compounds extracted from native plants for treating venomous snake bites which are hardly documented in literature but {{are used by}} the indigenous doctors for thousand years. Objective: We screened the neutralizing ability of a <b>herbal</b> <b>preparation</b> practiced in indigenous medicine of Sri Lanka, consisting of Sansevieria cylindrica, Jatropha podagrica and Citrus aurantiifolia, {{for its ability to}} neutralize venom toxins of Naja naja (Common Cobra) and Daboia russelii (Russell's viper). Materials and methods: The venom toxicity was evaluated using a 5 -day old chicken embryo model observing the pathophysiology and the mortality for six hours, in {{the presence or absence of}} the <b>herbal</b> <b>preparation.</b> The known toxin families to exist in snake venom, such as Phospholipase A 2, Snake venom Metalloprotease, were evaluated to understand the mechanism of venom neutralizing ability of the <b>herbal</b> <b>preparation.</b> Results: The LD 50 of D.  russelii venom, as measured using the 5 -day old chicken embryo model, was 4. 8  ±  0. 865 ug (R 2  =  84. 8 %, P =  0. 079). The pre-incubation of venom with the <b>herbal</b> <b>preparation</b> increased the LD 50 of D.  russelii venom to 17. 64  ±  1. 35  μg (R 2  =  81. 0 %, P =  0. 100), showing a clear neutralizing action of D.  russelii venom toxicity by the herbal medicine. Whereas the pre-incubation of venom with the 1 × venom neutralizing dose of commercially available polyvalent anti-venom serum shifted the LD 50 venom only up to 5. 5  ±  1. 35  μg (R 2  =  98. 8 %, P =  0. 069). In the presence of the <b>herbal</b> <b>preparation,</b> Phospholipase A 2 activity of D.  russelii venom was significantly reduced from 9. 2  ×  10 − 3  mM min− 1 to 8. 0  ×  10 − 3  mM min− 1 and that of N.  naja from 2. 92  ×  10 − 2  mM min− 1 to 0. 188  ×  10 − 2  mM min− 1. Further, the pre-incubation of N.  naja venom with the <b>herbal</b> <b>preparation</b> significantly reduced its Metalloprotease activity from 0. 069 units min− 1 to 0. 019 units min− 1. Conclusion: The <b>herbal</b> <b>preparation</b> shows a clear neutralizing action against the toxicities of D.  russelii and N. naja venoms demonstrating the potential to be used as a plant based antidote for snake envenomation...|$|R

Controlled data supporting the efficacy of these treatments in patients with irritable bowel syndrome are lacking. Aim : To assess the efficacy and safety of a commercially available <b>herbal</b> <b>preparation</b> (STW 5) (nine plant extracts), the research <b>herbal</b> <b>preparation</b> STW 5 -II (six plant extracts) and the bitter candytuft mono-extract in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. Methods : Two hundred and eight patients with irritable bowel syndrome were recruited after standardized diagnostic work-up into a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre trial and were randomly assigned to receive one of four treatments: commercially available <b>herbal</b> <b>preparation</b> STW 5 (n = 51), research <b>herbal</b> <b>preparation</b> STW 5 -II (n = 52), bitter candytuft mono-extract (n = 53) or placebo (n = 52). The main outcome variables were the changes in total abdominal pain and irritable bowel syndrome symptom scores. Results : Two hundred and three patients completed the trial. STW 5 and STW 5 -II were significantly better than placebo in reducing the total abdominal pain score (intention-to-treat: STW 5, P = 0. 0009; STW 5 -II, P = 0. 0005) and the irritable bowel syndrome symptom score (intention-to-treat: STW 5, P = 0. 001; STW 5 -II, P = 0. 0003) at 4 weeks.
