50|$|Since {{producing}} <b>high</b> <b>carbon</b> steel from {{wrought iron}} was very difficult, careful lamination of different alloys also served to conserve this difficult-to-make steel by using it {{only for the}} parts of the blades where it was needed. Many swords were made with the minimum possible amount of <b>high</b> <b>carbon</b> steel along the cutting edge, {{with the rest of the}} blade being made of low carbon steel or wrought iron. A thin strip of <b>high</b> <b>carbon</b> steel could be laminated between two layers of softer steel, or a core of soft steel could be wrapped in <b>high</b> <b>carbon</b> steel. The Japanese katana was often found with complex patterns of soft and hard steels; having 5 sections of differing hardness welded together to form the final blade was not uncommon. The end result would be a blade with a very <b>high</b> <b>carbon</b> edge (as much as 1.0%, equal to the <b>highest</b> <b>carbon</b> content found in low alloy steels in use today) and a softer spine. The very hard, but brittle, edge made the swords extremely sharp, while the spine gave the blade flexibility, so that it would bend rather than break.|$|R

Over-mature forests have the least carbon storage; (2) By origin, natural forests of all age groups have <b>higher</b> <b>carbon</b> storage and carbon density than man-made forest plantations.
