5|$|Ranavalona's 33-year reign was {{characterized}} by her effort to strengthen the domestic authority of the Kingdom of Imerina over subjugated provinces and preserve the political and cultural sovereignty of Madagascar. These policies were enacted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> increasing European influence within her kingdom and competing French and English bids for domination over the island. Early in her reign, the queen took incremental steps to distance Madagascar from the purview of European powers, first {{putting an end to}} a friendship treaty with Britain, then placing increasing restrictions on the activities of the missionaries of the London Missionary Society, who operated schools where basic education and trade skills were taught in addition to the Christian religion. In 1835 she forbade the practice of Christianity among the Malagasy population, and within a year nearly all foreigners had left her territory.|$|E

25|$|A rival {{conclusion}} by {{some historians}} (Terraine, Sheffield, Duffy, Chickering, Herwig and Philpott et al.) {{is that there}} was no strategic alternative for the British in 1916 and that an understandable horror at British losses is insular, given the millions of casualties borne by the French and Russian armies since 1914. This school of thought sets the battle <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> a general Allied offensive in 1916 and notes that German and French writing on the battle puts it in a continental perspective.|$|E

In Turin and Milan, workers councils were formed and many factory occupations took place under the leadership of anarcho-syndicalists. The agitations also extended to the agricultural areas of the Padan plain and were accompanied by peasant strikes, rural unrests and guerrilla conflicts between left-wing and right-wing militias.|$|E

25|$|Bishara Khader {{argues that}} this ambitious European project towards its Mediterranean {{neighbours}} {{has to be}} understood <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> optimism. On the one hand, the European Community was undergoing important changes due to the reunification of Germany {{after the fall of}} the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the beginning of the adhesion negotiations of Eastern and Central European countries. On the other, the Arab–Israeli conflict appeared to be getting closer to achieving peace after the Madrid Conference (1991) and the Oslo Accords (1992). As well, Khader states that the Gulf War of 1991, the Algerian crisis (from 1992 onwards) and the rise of Islamic fundamentalism throughout the Arab world are also important factors in Europe's new relations with the Mediterranean countries based on security concerns.|$|E

25|$|William {{was also}} stadtholder {{of the main}} provinces of the Dutch Republic, then in the {{preliminary}} stages of joining the War of the Grand Alliance against France, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> international tensions caused by the revocation by Louis XIV of the Edict of Nantes and the disputed succession of Cologne and the Electorate of the Palatinate. William had already acquired {{the reputation of being}} the main champion in Europe of the Protestant cause against Catholicism and French absolutism; in the developing English crisis he saw an opportunity to prevent an Anglo-French alliance and bring England to the anti-French side, by carrying out a military intervention directed against James. This suited the desires of several English politicians who intended to depose James. It is still a matter of debate whether the initiative for the conspiracy was taken by the English or by the stadtholder and his wife. William had been trying to influence English politics for well over a year, letting Grand Pensionary Gaspar Fagel publish an open letter to the English people in November 1687 deploring the religious policy of James, which action had generally been interpreted as a covert bid for kingship.|$|E
25|$|Articles 19 and 32-36 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child {{prohibits the}} {{exploitation}} of children in any form and in any context. Any child who is exposed to violence, exploitation or abuse {{can be considered a}} victim of crime and enjoys the correlated rights and entitlements, including access to assistance, protection and support, services for recovery and rehabilitation, access to justice, with due procedural safeguards in any related legal or administrative proceedings. Children at risk of exploitation have to be identified and recognised as being at risk. This implies that {{they have a right to}} assistance and support in order to prevent their exploitation or any other harm resulting from the risks. Considering the difficulties of identifying children who have been trafficked and the broad protection against all forms and contexts of exploitation afforded under the Convention, a child rights-based approach prioritises the identification of child victims of exploitation or other crime and children at risk. Whether or not exploitation takes place <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> trafficking is of subordinate relevance for the child rights and protection context. It may interest primarily the law enforcement investigations and the prosecution.|$|E
500|$|The {{sociology}} of religion concerns the practices, historical backgrounds, developments, universal themes and roles {{of religion in}} society. There is particular emphasis on the recurring {{role of religion in}} all societies and throughout recorded history. The {{sociology of}} religion is distinguished from the philosophy of religion in that sociologists do not set out to assess the validity of religious truth-claims, instead assuming what Peter L. Berger has described as a position of [...] "methodological atheism". It may be said that the modern formal discipline of sociology began with the analysis of religion in Durkheim's 1897 study of suicide rates among Roman Catholic and Protestant populations. Max Weber published four major texts on religion <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> economic sociology and social stratification: The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism (1905), [...] (1915), [...] (1915), and Ancient Judaism (1920). Contemporary debates often centre on topics such as secularization, civil religion, the intersection of religion and economics and the role of religion <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> globalization and multiculturalism.|$|E
