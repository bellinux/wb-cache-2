5|$|Two months later, Warren {{returns to}} the garage and Lucas shows his support for Chris and defends him. Chris meets and befriends Warren's son, Blake (Oliver Edwin). When Warren learns Blake is friends with Chris, he decides {{to put a stop}} to the situation. Warren threatens to kill Chris unless he stops {{spending}} time with Blake. Mason told TV Week that he thinks it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> Chris and Blake cannot continue their friendship because of Warren and his views. It soon becomes clear someone is spying on Chris, but whether it is Warren or someone else is not clear. Mason added something big would happen and it may not end well for Chris.|$|E
25|$|The blurriness <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame,</b> because Rosenfeld has a {{legitimate}} argument. He explicitly rejects {{the view that}} any attack on Israeli policy equals anti-Semitism. Rather, his intended target is those Jews who reject {{the very existence of}} a Jewish state, and who express their opposition in shrieks that rise to equating Israel with the Nazis.|$|E
25|$|Several weeks later, {{she runs}} away from Fatboy's house without warning, {{returning}} to Walford and {{spending the night}} at Shirley's flat. Leon and Fatboy track her down and she apologises for disappearing. Shirley decides to let her stay with her for a while, and attempts to get Zsa Zsa into a local school. This fails, so she asks Phil for a favour, and he speaks to the headmaster Mr Allcock (Bill Buckhurst). Shirley tells Zsa Zsa she has an appointment with Mr Allcock {{but she is not}} interested until she sees him and takes a liking to him. She befriends Whitney and gives her relationship advice. Mr Allcock visits and Zsa Zsa flirts with him, but she gets a place in the school due to Phil's intervention. Zsa Zsa receives a letter from her mother asking her to join her in Spain, but she does not want to go, so tries to prove she is useful by babysitting Shirley's housemate Heather Trott's (Cheryl Fergison) baby George and saying it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> after Shirley went to all the trouble to get her into school. Shirley acts like she does not care if Zsa Zsa stays or goes but after she tears up Tina's letter, she lets on to Heather that she would have missed Zsa Zsa.|$|E

But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering. But if any seem contentious, we have no such custom, neither do the churches of God." ...|$|E
500|$|CSKA manager Valery Gazzaev praised {{his players}} despite their loss and hinted that {{injuries}} {{may have been}} a factor in the loss: [...] "The game was satisfactory – we had followed the plan we set out, but still we made two mistakes. On the whole I think our team played very well but of course it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> we didn't win. We had a lot of good opportunities but we couldn't do it. Liverpool played as we expected – they played quite aggressively. We didn't feel uncomfortable but we made a couple of mistakes." [...] Gazzaev rued the injuries his team suffered indicating {{there might have been a}} different outcome had certain players been fit.|$|E
500|$|Garcia was not {{selected}} {{a member of}} the National Baseball Hall of Fame. His normal window of eligibility has closed, and he would only be elected by decision of the Hall's Veterans Committee. Baseball historian Bill James dismissed Garcia's low ERA due to the [...] "cold, cavernous Cleveland Municipal Stadium, which at that time had a pitcher's mound higher than white cliffs of Dover". Referring to Garcia's great seasons of 1949 to 1954, baseball historian Wayne Corbett countered, [...] "Garcia's more famous teammates enjoyed the same home-field advantage, but it was Garcia who recorded the staff's lowest ERA in four of those six seasons." [...] Historian Stephen Lombardi wrote, [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> that Mike Garcia is sometimes disregarded. A career such as his does not deserve to fade away from the memory of the overall baseball public." [...] Cleveland sportswriter and Hall of Fame voter Hal Lebovitz wrote, [...] "If Garcia had pitched long enough, he probably would be in the Hall of Fame." ...|$|E

500|$|Eurogamer's Kristan Reed was unimpressed {{with the}} game, calling it [...] "a bit half-baked". He praised {{the opening of}} the game, arguing that, like Hansen himself, the player feels a strong sense of {{disorientation}} as they get used to being on the ship {{in the middle of a}} storm. However, he felt the strong opening soon gives way to clichés. He was highly critical of the absence of a map, arguing that because the environments all look similar, getting lost is a regular occurrence. GameSpot's Carrie Gouskos scored the PlayStation 2 version 6.9 out of 10 and the Xbox version 7.2 out of 10. She argued [...] "Atmospherically, Cold Fear is derivative and predictable, which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> considering that it is, at times, an enjoyable action game." [...] Although she praised the outdoor scenes on the boat, she felt there were not enough of them, with too many [...] "generic indoor locations." [...] She was also highly critical of the lack of a map and the autosave feature, feeling the save points were unevenly distributed.|$|E
500|$|Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine {{commented that}} [...] "'Bad Romance' and 'Dance in the Dark' are stacked with towering new-wave synths and {{seemingly}} endless hooks; if melodies could be time-stamped, these would have [...] "'80s" [...] branded on their asses. [...] The song isn't {{a cautionary tale}} , but a call to arms to misfits everywhere." [...] She went on to declare the song {{as one of the}} highlights of The Fame Monster but added that [...] "After a stuttering intro of orgasmic groans it becomes a little bit Gaga-by-numbers, which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> given the standard of the early tracks". Ben Patashnik from NME felt that [...] "Dance in the Dark", along with another song [...] "Monster", was [...] "slightly disposable". Michael Hubbard from MusicOMH complimented the song for its [...] "monumental chorus and some Madonna-esque spoken-word moments, including this shout out to a lost Royal: 'You will never fall apart Diana, you're still in our hearts / Never let you fall apart / Together we'll dance in the dark.'" ...|$|E
500|$|As a final {{tribute to}} Pauline and Wendy Richard, the BBC aired a special {{television}} programme, EastEnders Revealed: Goodbye Pauline, which provided an emotional {{look back at}} Pauline's pivotal storylines during her time in Walford. It also reunited Wendy Richard with prior cast-mates Todd Carty and James Alexandrou (Mark and Martin respectively), and featured character commentary and tributes from television critics and EastEnders actors such as Anna Wing and Pam St. Clement (Lou and Pat). During the programme—which aired on New Year's Day, 2007—Wendy Richard reflected upon how [...] "proud" [...] she was of her character, commenting: [...] "Pauline had everything in life thrown at her and I think she coped with it very well. It showed how people deal with their problems... She wasn't always grumpy... she did have lots of laughs, but sadly people don't seem to remember that, which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame...</b> they still harp on about her wearing her cardigans and Pauline stopped wearing cardigans three years after EastEnders started. She is a good woman, she's a kind woman, a loving woman and all she ever thought about was her family. That {{was the most important}} thing in her life." ...|$|E

2500|$|Many feminists {{have accused}} notions {{such as a}} male God, male prophets, and the man-centered stories in the Bible of {{contributing}} to a patriarchy. Though many women disciples and servants are recorded in the Pauline epistles, there have been occasions in which women have been denigrated and forced into a second-class status. For example, women were told to keep silent in the churches for [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> {{for a woman to}} speak in the church". Suffragist Elizabeth Cady Stanton said in The Woman's Bible that [...] "the Bible in its teachings degrades women from Genesis to Revelation".|$|E

2500|$|Also, 1 Corinthians 14:34,35 states, [...] "Let your women keep {{silence in}} the churches: for it is not {{permitted}} unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the law.

2500|$|A {{second example}} would be gender roles {{depicted}} in the letters, which proscribe roles for women that appear to deviate from Paul's more egalitarian teaching that in Christ there is neither male nor female. Separate male and female roles, however, were not foreign to the authentic Pauline epistles; the First Letter to the Corinthians (14:34–35) commands silence from women during church services, stating that [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> for women to speak in the church". Father Jerome Murphy-O'Connor, O.P., in the New Jerome Biblical Commentary, [...] "agrees with many other commentators on this passage over {{the last hundred years}} in recognising it to be an interpolation by a later editor of 1 Corinthians of a passage from 1 Timothy 2:11–15 that states a similar 'women should be silent in churches. This made 1 Corinthians more widely acceptable to church leaders in later times. If verses before or after 1 Corinthians 14:34–35 are read, it is fairly clear that verses 34 and 35 were inserted later.|$|E
