40|$|Groundwater is {{ubiquitous}} and immensely {{important for}} human uses {{but there is}} inadequate supply especially in the basement complex terrain as most boreholes are either abortive or can’t yield sustainable water to wells. This research tends to delineate into the subsurface {{in order to understand}} the aquifer pattern in Ogbagba area. A geophysical survey involving twelve vertical electrical sounding (VES) was carried out at some selected locations in Ogbagba. Resistivity meter was used to acquire the geophysical field data. Conventional partial curve matching and WinResist software was used for the data processing. 75 % of the aquifers in the study area are confined aquifers while the remaining 25 % are unconfined aquifers. Also, three probable aquifer units were delineated where clayey sand has 75 %, sandy clay constitutes 16. 7 % and fractured bedrock shares the remaining 8. 3 %. The study revealed that <b>insufficiency</b> <b>of</b> groundwater <b>exploitation</b> in the study area is due to the geologic formation of the aquifers and the depth to which groundwater is been abstracted. If these mistakes are corrected, Ogbagba will henceforth start to enjoy groundwater exploitation adequately. Keywords...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I present a rights-based theory <b>of</b> <b>exploitation.</b> I argue that {{successful}} conceptions <b>of</b> <b>exploitation</b> should {{begin with the}} ordinary language claim that exploitation involves `taking unfair advantage'. Consequently, they must combine an account {{of what it means}} to take advantage of another with an account of when transactions are unfair. Existing conceptions <b>of</b> <b>exploitation</b> fail to provide adequate accounts of both aspects <b>of</b> <b>exploitation.</b> Hillel Steiner and John Roemer provide convincing accounts of the unfairness involved in exploitation, but because they fail to provide restrictive `advantage taking' conditions, their theories <b>of</b> <b>exploitation</b> include cases that we would not ordinarily describe as exploitations. Ruth Sample and Robert Goodin provide accounts that place a stronger emphasis on the attitudes involved in exploitation and the processes that bring it about. Unfortunately, these theories do not properly incorporate the unfairness aspect <b>of</b> <b>exploitation.</b> Consequently, they are either self-frustrating or incomplete. I provide a conception <b>of</b> <b>exploitation</b> that combines both aspects. I claim that [...] ...|$|R

It is necessary to encourage creation of bilateral and multilateral forms of co-operation among the Danube-basin countries and establishment of their common approach to the other regions of the world. There is also a need for inflow of world capital, considering that the principles <b>of</b> sustainable <b>exploitation</b> <b>of</b> natural resources (sustainable development) are respected. All these efforts should be directed towards achievement of more accelerated economic development, to attain growth of labour productivity, to increase employment rate and the standard of living, to achieve development of national cultures and their mutual interweaving, and thus to ensure growth of material and cultural wealth of any defined community and the region as a whole...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{observe the}} {{clinical}} effects of acupuncture for allergic rhinitis. MethodsThe body acupuncture, auricular seed-embedding and microwave irradiation were adopted {{for treatment of}} allergic rhinitis due to various causative factors, such as cold and <b>insufficiency</b> <b>of</b> the lung-qi weakening the body resistance, <b>insufficiency</b> <b>of</b> the spleen-qi with lucid yang failing to rise, <b>insufficiency</b> <b>of</b> the kidney-yang failing to warm the body surface, and the heat accumulated in the lung channels giving invading the nose. ResultsAfter treatment, the symptoms and signs disappeared in all illustrative cases, with no recurrence found after a one-year follow-up. ConclusionAcupuncture may help to improve the blood rheology indexes with an increased volume of blood flow, and regulate the immunological function of the human body, thus giving therapeutic effects for allergic rhinitis...|$|R

By demonstrating the conceptual inadequacy <b>of</b> <b>exploitation</b> as defined in the first sense, and by defining exploitation adequately in the latter sense, we seek to demonstrate the moral complexity <b>of</b> <b>exploitation.</b> We contend, moreover, that moral evaluation <b>of</b> <b>exploitation</b> is only possible once we abandon a strictly Marxian framework and attempt, in the long run, to develop an integral ethic along Godwinian lines...|$|R
