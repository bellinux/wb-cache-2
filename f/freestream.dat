5|$|The {{thickness}} of the velocity boundary layer is normally defined as {{the distance from the}} solid body to {{the point at which the}} viscous flow velocity is 99% of the <b>freestream</b> velocity (the surface velocity of an inviscid flow). Displacement Thickness is an alternative definition stating that the boundary layer represents a deficit in mass flow compared to inviscid flow with slip at the wall. It is the distance by which the wall would have to be displaced in the inviscid case to give the same total mass flow as the viscous case. The no-slip condition requires the flow velocity at the surface of a solid object be zero and the fluid temperature be equal to the temperature of the surface. The flow velocity will then increase rapidly within the boundary layer, governed by the boundary layer equations, below.|$|E
500|$|In 1928, the French {{engineer}} André Lévêque {{observed that}} convective heat transfer in a flowing fluid is affected {{only by the}} velocity values {{very close to the}} surface. For flows of large Prandtl number, the temperature/mass transition from surface to <b>freestream</b> temperature takes place across a very thin region close to the surface. Therefore, the most important fluid velocities are those inside this very thin region in which the change in velocity can be considered linear with normal distance from the surface. In this way, for ...|$|E

2500|$|Many factors {{affect a}} thrust-to-weight ratio. [...] The {{instantaneous}} value typically varies over the flight with the variations of thrust due to speed and altitude {{along with the}} weight due to the remaining propellant and payload mass. [...] The main factors include <b>freestream</b> air temperature, pressure, density, and composition. [...] Depending on the engine or vehicle under consideration, the actual performance will often be affected by buoyancy and local gravitational field strength.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the terms}} [...] "subsonic" [...] and [...] "supersonic," [...] in the purest sense, refer to speeds below {{and above the}} local speed of sound respectively, aerodynamicists often use the same terms to talk about {{particular}} ranges of Mach values. This occurs {{because of the presence}} of a [...] "transonic regime" [...] around M = 1 where approximations of the Navier-Stokes equations used for subsonic design actually no longer apply; the simplest explanation is that the flow locally begins to exceed M = 1 even though the <b>freestream</b> Mach number is below this value.|$|E
2500|$|In {{aeronautics}} {{and marine}} hydrodynamics, the advance ratio is {{the ratio of}} the <b>freestream</b> fluid speed to the propeller, rotor, or cyclorotor tip speed. When a propeller-driven vehicle is moving at high speed relative to the fluid, or the propeller is rotating slowly, the advance ratio of its propeller(s) is a high number; and when it is moving at low speed, or the propeller is rotating at high speed, the advance ratio is a low number. [...] The advance ratio is a useful non-dimensional velocity in helicopter and propeller theory, since propellers and rotors will experience the same angle of attack on every blade airfoil section at the same advance ratio regardless of actual forward speed. It is the inverse of the tip speed ratio used for wind turbines.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the case}} of a <b>freestream</b> flow past a cylinder, three methods may be {{employed}} to control the boundary layer separation that occurs due to the adverse pressure gradient. [...] Rotation of the cylinder can reduce or eliminate the boundary layer that is formed on the side which is moving {{in the same direction as}} the <b>freestream.</b> The side moving against the flow also exhibits only partial separation of the boundary layer. Suction applied through a slit in the cylinder near a separation point can also delay the onset of separation by removing fluid particles that have been slowed in the boundary layer. Alternatively, fluid can be blown from a faired slit such that the slowed fluid is accelerated and thus the point of separation is delayed.|$|E

Many authors describe the atmospheric pressure at the altitude at which the aircraft is flying as the <b>freestream</b> static pressure. At least one author takes a different approach in order to avoid a need for the expression <b>freestream</b> static pressure. Gracey has written [...] "The static pressure is the atmospheric pressure at the flight level of the aircraft". Gracey then refers to the air pressure at any point close to the aircraft as the local static pressure.|$|E
