5|$|According to Cockerell, {{the side}} of the façade that is to the south of the central door <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> sacred and the scheme is divided accordingly. The lowest range of niches each {{contained}} a standing figure, of which all but four figures on the west front, two on each side, have been destroyed. More have survived on the northern and eastern sides of the north tower. Cockerell speculates that those to the south of the portal represented prophets and patriarchs of the Old Testament while those to the north represented early missionaries to Britain, of which Augustine of Canterbury, St Birinus, and Benedict Biscop are identifiable by their attributes. In the second zone, above each pair of standing figures, is a quatrefoil containing a half-length angel in relief, some of which have survived. Between the gables of the niches are quatrefoils that contain a series of narratives from the Bible, with the Old Testament stories to the south, above the prophets and patriarchs, and those from the New Testament to the north. A horizontal course runs around the west front dividing the architectural storeys at this point.|$|E
5|$|Because the new Olimpija is {{supported}} {{by most of the}} fans of the previous Olimpija, including their ultras group, the Green Dragons, who have a long-standing rivalry with Maribor's own ultras group Viole Maribor, many see the matches between Maribor and the new club as the continuation of the rivalry and refer to it by the same name. However, there are many fans, either the ones from Maribor or the ones from Ljubljana, that do not share the same view and do not share similar beliefs, including part of the media such as RTV Slovenija and Večer. The overall statistics of {{the old and the new}} Olimpija are tracked separately by the Football Association of Slovenia and the Association of 1. SNL. The first match between Maribor and the new Olimpija took place on 24 October 2007 in a Slovenian cup quarter-final match that was won by Maribor, 3–1. At the time, Olimpija was still competing under the name Olimpija Bežigrad. Statistically, Maribor <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> successful club either in the case of matches from the period from 1962 to 2005 or the whole period from 1962 to present day.|$|E
5|$|Broaching is a {{machining}} process {{that uses a}} toothed tool, called a broach, to remove material. There are two main types of broaching: linear and rotary. In linear broaching, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> common process, the broach is run linearly against a surface of the workpiece to effect the cut. Linear broaches are used in a broaching machine, which is also sometimes shortened to broach. In rotary broaching, the broach is rotated and pressed into the workpiece to cut an axisymmetric shape. A rotary broach is used in a lathe or screw machine. In both processes the cut is performed in one pass of the broach, which makes it very efficient.|$|E

5|$|Chicken is {{the most}} widely eaten meat in Israel, {{followed}} by turkey. Chicken is prepared in a multitude of ways, from simple oven-roasted chicken to elaborate casseroles with rich sauces such as date syrup, tomato sauce, etc. Examples include chicken casserole with couscous, inspired by Moroccan Jewish cooking, chicken with olives, a Mediterranean classic, and chicken albondigas (meat balls) in tomato sauce, from Jerusalem Sephardi cuisine. Albondigas are also prepared from ground meat., similar to albogindas <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> popular Kufta which is made of minced meat, herbs and spices and cooked with tomato sauce, date syrup, pomegranate syrup or tamarind syrup with vegetables or beans.|$|E
5|$|Elements in {{the same}} period show trends in atomic radius, {{ionization}} energy, electron affinity, and electronegativity. Moving left to right across a period, atomic radius usually decreases. This occurs because each successive element has an added proton and electron, which causes the electron to be drawn closer to the nucleus. This decrease in atomic radius also causes the ionization energy to increase when moving from left to right across a period. The more tightly bound an element <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> energy is required to remove an electron. Electronegativity increases {{in the same}} manner as ionization energy because of the pull exerted on the electrons by the nucleus. Electron affinity also shows a slight trend across a period. Metals (left side of a period) generally have a lower electron affinity than nonmetals (right side of a period), with the exception of the noble gases.|$|E

5|$|In Batesian mimicry, {{the mimic}} {{effectively}} copies the coloration of an aposematic animal, {{known as the}} model, to deceive predators into behaving {{as if it were}} distasteful. The success of this dishonest display depends on the level of toxicity of the model and the abundance of the model in the geographical area. The more toxic the model <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> likely it is that the predator will avoid the mimic. The abundance of the model species is also important for the success of the mimic because of frequency dependent selection. When the model is abundant, mimics with imperfect model patterns or slightly different coloration from the model are still avoided by predators. This is because the predator has a strong incentive to avoid potentially lethal organisms, given the likelihood of encountering one. However, in areas where the model is scarce or locally extinct, mimics are driven to accurate aposematic coloration. This is because predators attack imperfect mimics more readily where there is little chance that they are the model species. Frequency dependent selection may also have driven Batesian mimics to become polymorphic in rare cases where a single genetic switch controls appearance, as in the swallowtail butterflies (the Papilionidae).|$|E

5|$|Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) convinces {{regional}} manager Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{that he needs}} to choose someone to act as an Assistant to the Assistant to the Regional Manager (A.A.R.M.). Jim designs several Dwight-oriented challenges as tryouts for the position, and it is inevitably found that Dwight is the most qualified. Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey) is forced to bring her child, Phillip, to work, after her daycare turns her child away. Dwight, upon overhearing that Phillip has been eating the type of paper which he himself regards as the most flavorful, begins to think that Angela's son is actually his. To test this theory, Dwight offers the child either a check for one million dollars or a beet; Phillip picks the beet. Dwight tells Angela that he will marry her if the child is his, but she denies that this is the case. Dwight then confers with Jim, asking whether he should propose to Angela or his girlfriend Esther, who he thinks <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> logical choice. Jim tells Dwight {{that he needs to}} put aside logic and follow his instincts. Dwight makes up his mind and proposes to Angela, who says yes. Angela finally reveals to Dwight that Phillip is indeed his son, explaining that she lied about his parentage in order to test Dwight's feelings for her.|$|E
5|$|Lead shows {{two main}} {{oxidation}} states: +4 and +2. The tetravalent state {{is common for}} the carbon group. The divalent state is rare for carbon and silicon, minor for germanium, important (but not prevailing) for tin, and <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> important for lead. This is attributable to relativistic effects, specifically the inert pair effect, which manifests itself {{when there is a}} large difference in electronegativity between lead and oxide, halide, or nitride anions, leading to a significant partial positive charge on lead. The result is a stronger contraction of the lead 6s orbital than is the case for the 6p orbital, making it rather inert in ionic compounds. This is less applicable to compounds in which lead forms covalent bonds with elements of similar electronegativity such as carbon in organolead compounds. In these, the 6s and 6p orbitals remain similarly sized and sp3 hybridization is still energetically favorable. Lead, like carbon, is predominantly tetravalent in such compounds.|$|E
