5|$|Past {{hypotheses}} {{have suggested}} mistakenly that the Golondrina was a descendant or {{variant of the}} Plainview type. Although the two points exhibit similarities, particularly in terms of shape, they are now recognized as separate types. Identification is made {{from a lack of}} an auriculated, <b>fishtail</b> base on the Plainview and a deeper basal concavity on the Golondrina. Plainview points may have served to bring down large bison, while Golondrina points may have been used for killing smaller game such as deer, as well as doubling as a butchering knife. Compared to the split-stem hafting style of the Golondrina point without a deep setting, the shape of the Plainview points would necessitate them being set relatively deeply into a socketed haft that once bound would leave less of the cutting edge exposed. Stratigraphic evidence from the St. Mary's Hall site in southern, central Texas implies that Golondrina may have superseded Plainview on the southern Plains.|$|E

However, the dolphin <b>fishtail</b> kick violated the breaststroke rules set by FINA and was not allowed.

25|$|Trench coats have {{remained}} fashionable {{in the decades}} following World War II.

Humphrey Bogart's Rick Blaine from Casablanca and Peter Sellers' Inspector Clouseau wore the trench coat in the public eye. Often, a fedora or an ushanka (during colder weather) was also worn. In the 1960s, radical intellectuals wore trench coats over black turtleneck sweaters, while some Mods wore trench coats as fashionable overcoats, {{as an alternative to the}} <b>fishtail</b> parka or crombie. Streakers and flashers often prefer trench coats since they conceal the wearer's lack of undergarments and can be opened quickly when the exhibitionist is ready to expose him or herself.|$|E

2500|$|... 1928 was {{the start}} of the {{scientific}} study of swimming by David Armbruster, coach at the University of Iowa, who filmed swimmers from underwater. One breaststroke problem Armbruster researched was that the swimmer was slowed down significantly while bringing the arms forward underwater. In 1934 Armbruster refined a method to bring the arms forward over water in breaststroke. While this [...] "butterfly" [...] technique was difficult, it brought a great improvement in speed. A year later, in 1935, Jack Sieg, a swimmer also from the University of Iowa, developed a technique involving swimming on his side and beating his legs in unison similar to a fish tail, and modified the technique afterward to swim it face down. Armbruster and Sieg combined these techniques into a variant of the breaststroke called butterfly, with the two kicks per cycle being called dolphin <b>fishtail</b> kick. Using this technique Sieg swam 100 yards (91m) in 1:00.2. However, even though this technique was much faster than regular breaststroke, the dolphin <b>fishtail</b> kick violated the rules.

2500|$|A final major {{distinction}} {{is made in}} whether the trousers take a belt or braces (suspenders). While a belt was originally never worn with a suit, the forced wearing of belts during wartime years (caused by restrictions on use of elastic caused by wartime shortages) contributed to their rise in popularity, with braces now much less popular than belts. When braces were common, the buttons for attaching them {{were placed on the}} outside of the waistband, because they would be covered by a waistcoat or cardigan, but now it is more frequent to button on the inside of the trouser. Trousers taking braces are rather different in cut at the waist, employing inches of extra girth and also height at the back. The split in the waistband at the back is in the <b>fishtail</b> shape. [...] Those who prefer braces assert that, because they hang from the shoulders, they always make the trousers fit and hang exactly as they should, while a belt may allow the trouser waist to slip down on the hips or below a protruding midsection, and requires constant repositioning; also, they allow, indeed work best with, a slightly looser waist which gives room for natural expansion when seated.|$|E
