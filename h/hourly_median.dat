40|$|The {{human health}} effects {{following}} exposure to ultrafine (< 100 nm) particles (UFPs) produced by fuel combustion, while not completely understood, are {{generally regarded as}} detrimental. Road tunnels have emerged as locations where maximum exposure to these particles may occur for the vehicle occupants using them. This study aimed to quantify and investigate the determinants of UFP concentrations in the 4 km twin-bore (eastbound and westbound) M 5 East tunnel in Sydney, Australia. Sampling was undertaken using a condensation particle counter (CPC) mounted in a vehicle traversing both tunnel bores at various times of day from May through July, 2006. Supplementary measurements were conducted in February, 2008. Over three hundred transects of the tunnel were performed, and these were distributed evenly between the bores. Additional comparative measurements were conducted on a mixed route comprising major roads and shorter tunnels, all within Sydney. Individual trip average UFP concentrations in the M 5 East tunnel bores ranged from 5. 53 × 104 p cm- 3 to 5. 95 × 106 p cm- 3. Data were sorted by hour of capture, and <b>hourly</b> <b>median</b> trip average (HMA) UFP concentrations ranged from 7. 81 × 104 p cm- 3 to 1. 73 × 106 p cm- 3. <b>Hourly</b> <b>median</b> UFP concentrations measured on the mixed route were between 3. 71 × 104 p cm- 3 and 1. 55 × 105 p cm- 3. Hourly heavy diesel vehicle (HDV) traffic volume {{was a very good}} determinant of UFP concentration in the eastbound tunnel bore (R 2 = 0. 87), but much less so in the westbound bore (R 2 = 0. 26). In both bores, the volume of passenger vehicles (i. e. unleaded gasoline-powered vehicles) was a significantly poorer determinant of particle concentration. When compared with similar studies reported previously, the measurements described here were among the highest recorded concentrations, which further highlights the contribution road tunnels may make to the overall UFP exposure of vehicle occupants...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we address the {{question}} as to whether and to what extent workers in atypical employment are affected by low wages (below two-thirds of the <b>hourly</b> <b>median</b> wage). Our analysis is based on quantitative data (using the GSOEP) and on qualitative interviews at establishment level in various industries. We find that employees in marginal part-time work (mini-jobs), agency workers and employees with fixed-term contracts are particularly affected by low pay, whereas the share of low-wage workers among regular part-timers (covered by the social insurance System) is only slightly above average. In 2006, atypical employees (without double count) accounted for around two thirds of all low-paid workers and thus much more than in 1995 (slightly below 49 %). However, {{this does not mean that}} low pay in Germany is concentrated only on atypical workers or particular groups such as low-skilled or young employees.

The analysis period covers four months representative of solstitial and equinoctial seasonal periods during solar minimum year of 1987 for geomagnetically quiet-day. It is demonstrated that the month-by-month morphological patterns between vertical E × B drifts and F 2 -layer parameters range from worst to reasonably good and are largely seasonally dependent. A cross-correlation analysis conducted between equatorial drift and F 2 -layer characteristics yield statistically significant correlations for equatorial vertical drift and IRI-Bo, IRI-Te and IRI-TEC, whereas little or no acceptable correlation is obtained with observational evidence. Examination of the association between measured foF 2, hmF 2 and M(3000)F 2 illustrates consistent much more smaller correlation coefficients with no systematic linkage.|$|E

Here the first year-long (December 2012 – November 2013) {{measurements}} of the full radiation balance for a dense urban site in Shanghai are presented, collected with a net radiometer CNR 4 mounted 80 m above ground. Clear sky incoming shortwave radiation (K↓) (median daytime maxima) ranges from 575 W m- 2 in winter to 875 W m- 2 in spring, with cloud cover reducing the daily maxima by about 160 W m- 2. The median incoming longwave radiation daytime maxima is 305 and 468 W m- 2 in winter and summer, respectively, with increases of 30 and 15 W m- 2 for cloudy conditions. The effect of air quality is evident: ‘haze’ conditions decrease <b>hourly</b> <b>median</b> K↓ by 11. 3 %.

40|$|BACKGROUND—The {{relationship}} between current concentrations of ambient {{air pollution and}} adverse health effects is controversial. We report a meteorological index of air stagnation {{that is associated with}} daily visits to the emergency department for asthma in two urban areas.  METHODS—Data on daily values of a stagnation persistence index and visits to the emergency department for asthma were collected for approximately two years in Spokane, Washington, USA and for 15 months in Seattle, Washington, USA. The stagnation persistence index represents the number of hours during the 24 hour day when surface wind speeds are less than the annual <b>hourly</b> <b>median</b> value, an index readily available for most urban areas. Associations between the daily stagnation persistence index and daily emergency department visits for asthma were tested using a generalised additive Poisson regression model. A factor analysis of particulate matter (PM 2. 5) composition was performed to identify the pollutants associated with increased asthma visits.  RESULTS—The relative rate of the association between a visit to the emergency department for asthma and the stagnation persistence index was 1. 12 (95 % CI 1. 05 to 1. 19) in Spokane and 1. 21 (95 % CI 1. 09 to 1. 35) in Seattle for an increase of 11 and 10 hours, respectively, of low wind speed in a given day. The stagnation persistence index was only correlated with one set of factor loadings; that cluster included the stagnation persistence index, carbon monoxide, and organic/elemental carbon.  CONCLUSION—Increased air stagnation was shown to be a surrogate for accumulation of the products of incomplete combustion, including carbon monoxide and fine particulate levels of organic and elemental carbon, and was more strongly associated with asthma aggravation than any one of the measured pollutants. ...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, eddy {{covariance}} is the state-of-the-art {{method to}} quantify turbulent exchange fluxes {{in the surface}} boundary layer. In the absence of instruments suitable for high-frequency measurements, fluxes can also be determined using e. g., chamber techniques. However, up to date fluxes of depositing compounds were rarely determined using chamber techniques, mainly due to a modification of the aerodynamic conditions for the trace gas transport within the chamber. In this study, we present ozone (O 3) deposition fluxes measured by the dynamic chamber technique and validate them against the eddy covariance (EC) method for a natural grassland site in Germany. The chamber system presented in Pape et al. (2009) was used and optimized to (i) {{reduce the likelihood of}} non-stationarities, (ii) yield 30 min averages of flux measurements, and (iii) supply simultaneous profile measurements. The raw O 3 fluxes of the dynamic chamber were corrected for gas-phase chemistry in the chamber volume and for the modification of the aerodynamic and boundary layer resistances. Simultaneously measured carbon dioxide and water vapor fluxes by both methods compared well during daytime documenting an equal vegetation activity inside and outside the chambers. The final corrected O 3 deposition fluxes of both methods deviated on average by only 11 % during daytime. The findings demonstrate the capability of the dynamic chamber method to capture representative O 3 deposition fluxes for grassland ecosystems, even when the canopy height is similar to the chamber height. The canopy resistance to O 3 was assessed by both methods and showed a characteristic diurnal cycle with minimum <b>hourly</b> <b>median</b> values of 180 s m− 1 (chambers) and 150 s m− 1 (EC) before noon. During nighttime the fluxes and resistances showed a higher uncertainty for both methods due to frequent low wind associated with non-stationary conditions at the experimental site. Canopy resistances for nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) deposition were determined analogously with the chambers and were on average 86 % higher than for O 3...|$|E
40|$|The {{quest to}} reduce the {{dependence}} on fossil fuel has increased the use of bio-ethanol as an additive to gasoline. The metropolitan area of São Paulo (population 20 million) is a unique laboratory to study the ambient aerosol population caused {{by the use of}} bio-fuels because 55 % of the fuel used is ethanol. The use of ethanol as an additive to fossil fuel is known to increase aldehyde emissions and when photo chemically oxidized, result in smog. In order to characterize this smog problem total particle number concentration, particle number size distribution, light scattering and light absorption measurement equipment were deployed at the University of São Paulo campus area. Here we present the results from three months of measurements from 10 October 2010 to 10 January 2011. The median total particle number concentration for the sub-micron aerosol typically varies between 1 &times; 10 4 – 3 &times; 10 4 cm− 3 frequently exceeding 5 &times; 10 4 cm− 3 during the day. Median diurnal values for light absorption and light scattering vary between 12 – 33 Mm− 1 and 21 – 64 Mm− 1 , respectively. The <b>hourly</b> <b>median</b> single-scattering albedo varied between 0. 63 and 0. 85 indicating a net warming effect on a regional scale.

40|$|The dry {{component}} of total nitrogen and sulfur atmospheric deposition remains uncertain. The lack of measurements of sufficient chemical speciation and temporal extent {{make it difficult}} to develop accurate mass budgets and sufficient process level detail is not available to improve current air–surface exchange models. Over the past decade, significant advances {{have been made in the}} development of continuous air sampling measurement techniques, resulting with instruments of sufficient sensitivity and temporal resolution to directly quantify air–surface exchange of nitrogen and sulfur compounds. However, their applicability is generally restricted to only one or a few of the compounds within the deposition budget. Here, the performance of the Monitor for AeRosols and GAses in ambient air (MARGA  2 S), a commercially available online ion-chromatography-based analyzer is characterized for the first time as applied for air–surface exchange measurements of HNO 3, NH 3, NH 4 +, NO 3 −, SO 2 and SO 4 2 −. Analytical accuracy and precision are assessed under field conditions. Chemical concentrations gradient precision are determined at the same sampling site. Flux uncertainty measured by the aerodynamic gradient method is determined for a representative 3 -week period in fall 2012 over a grass field. Analytical precision and chemical concentration gradient precision were found to compare favorably in comparison to previous studies. During the 3 -week period, percentages of hourly chemical concentration gradients greater than the corresponding chemical concentration gradient detection limit were 86, 42, 82, 73, 74 and 69  % for NH 3, NH 4 +, HNO 3, NO 3 −, SO 2 and SO 4 2 −, respectively.

40|$|A {{short-term}} ionospheric forecasting empirical {{regional model}} (IFERM) {{has been developed}} to predict {{the state of the}} critical frequency of the F 2 layer (foF 2) under different geomagnetic conditions. IFERM is based on 13 short term ionospheric forecasting empirical local models (IFELM) developed to predict foF 2 at 13 ionospheric observatories scattered around the European area. The forecasting procedures were developed by taking into account, hourly measurements of foF 2, hourly quiet-time reference values of foF 2 (foF 2 QT), and the hourly time-weighted accumulation series derived from the geomagnetic planetary index ap, (ap(τ)), for each observatory. Under the assumption that the ionospheric disturbance index ln(foF 2 /foF 2 QT) is correlated to the integrated geomagnetic disturbance index ap(τ), a set of statistically significant regression coefficients were established for each observatory, over 12 months, over 24 h, and under 3 different ranges of geomagnetic activity. This data was then used as input to compute short-term ionospheric forecasting of foF 2 at the 13 local stations under consideration. The empirical storm-time ionospheric correction model (STORM) was used to predict foF 2 in two different ways: scaling both the <b>hourly</b> <b>median</b> prediction provided by IRI (STORM_foF 2 MED,IRI model), and the foF 2 QT values (STORM_foF 2 QT model) from each local station. The comparison between the performance of STORM_foF 2 MED,IRI, STORM_foF 2 QT, IFELM, and the foF 2 QT values, was {{made on the basis of}} root mean square deviation (r. m. s.) for a large number of periods characterized by moderate, disturbed, and very disturbed geomagnetic activity. The results showed that the 13 IFELM perform much better than STORM_foF 2,sub>MED,IRI and STORM_foF 2 QT especially in the eastern part of the European area during the summer months (May, June, July, and August) and equinoctial months (March, April, September, and October) under disturbed and very disturbed geomagnetic conditions, respectively. The performance of IFELM is also very good in the western and central part of the Europe during the summer months under disturbed geomagnetic conditions. STORM_foF 2 MED,IRI performs particularly well in central Europe during the equinoctial months under moderate geomagnetic conditions and during the summer months under very disturbed geomagnetic conditions. The forecasting maps generated by IFERM on the basis of the results provided by the 13 IFELM, show very large areas located at middle-high and high latitudes where the foF 2 predictions quite faithfully match the foF 2 measurements, and consequently IFERM can be used for generating short-term forecasting maps of foF 2 (up to 3 h ahead) over the European area...|$|E
40|$|During recent years, {{elevated}} ozone (O 3) {{values have}} been observed repeatedly in the Upper Green River Basin (UGRB), Wyoming during wintertime. This paper presents an analysis of high ozone days in late winter 2011 (1 h average up to 166 ppbv). Intensive Operational Periods (IOPs) of ambient monitoring were performed which included comprehensive surface and boundary layer measurements. On IOP days, maximum O 3 values are restricted to a very shallow surface layer. Low wind speeds in combination with low mixing layer heights (~ 50 m a. g. l. around noontime) are essential for accumulation of pollutants within the UGRB. Air masses contain substantial amounts of reactive nitrogen (NO x) and non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC) emitted from fossil fuel exploration activities in the Pinedale Anticline. On IOP days in the morning hours in particular, reactive nitrogen (up to 69 %), aromatics and alkanes (~ 10 – 15 %; mostly ethane and propane) are major contributors to the hydroxyl (OH) reactivity. Measurements at the Boulder monitoring site during these time periods under SW wind flow conditions show the lowest NMHC/NO x ratios (~ 50), reflecting a relatively low NMHC mixture, and a change from a NO x -limited regime towards a NMHC limited regime as indicated by photochemical indicators, e. g. O 3 /NO y, O 3 /NO z, and O 3 /HNO 3 and the EOR (Extent of Reaction). OH production on IOP days is mainly due to nitrous acid (HONO). Until noon on IOP days, HONO photolysis contributes between 74 – 98 % of the entire OH-production. Ozone photolysis (contributing 2 – 24 %) is second to HONO photolysis. However, both reach about the same magnitude {{in the early afternoon}} (close to 50 %). Photolysis of formaldehyde (HCHO) is not important (2 – 7 %). High HONO levels (maximum <b>hourly</b> <b>median</b> on IOP days: 1096 pptv) are favored by a combination of shallow boundary layer conditions and enhanced photolysis rates due to the high albedo of the snow surface. HONO is most likely formed through (i) abundant nitric acid (HNO 3) produced in atmospheric oxidation of NO x, deposited onto the snow surface and undergoing photo-enhanced heterogeneous conversion to HONO (estimated HONO production: 2250 pptv h − 1) and (ii) combustion related emission of HONO (estimated HONO production: ~ 585 pptv h − 1). HONO, serves as the most important precursor for OH, strongly enhanced due to the high albedo of the snow cover (HONO photolysis rate 2900 pptv h − 1). OH radicals will oxidize NMHCs, mostly aromatics (toluene, xylenes) and alkanes (ethane, propane), eventually leading to an increase in ozone...|$|E

The metropolitan area of São Paulo (MASP, population 20 million) accounts for one fifth of the Brazilian vehicular fleet. A feature of MASP is the amount of ethanol used by the vehicular fleet, known to exacerbate air quality. The study describes the diurnal behaviour of the submicron aerosol and relies on total particle number concentration, particle number size distribution, light scattering and light absorption measurements. Modelled planetary boundary layer (PBL) depth and air mass movement data were used to aid the interpretation. During morning rush-hour, stagnant air and a shallow PBL height favour the accumulation of aerosol pollution. During clear-sky conditions, there was a wind shift towards the edge of the city indicating a heat island effect with implications on particulate pollution levels at the site. The median total particle number concentration for the submicron aerosol typically varied in the range 1. 6 × 10 4 – 3. 2 × 10 4 cm− 3 frequently exceeding 4 × 10 4 cm− 3 during the day. During weekdays, nucleation-mode particles are responsible for most of the particles by numbers. The highest concentrations of total particle number concentrations and black carbon (BC) were observed on Fridays. Median diurnal values for light absorption and light scattering (at 637 nm wavelength) varied in the range 12 – 33 Mm− 1 and 21 – 64 Mm− 1 , respectively. The former one is equal to 1. 8 – 5. 0 μg m− 3 of BC. The growth of the PBL, from the morning rush-hour until noon, is consistent with the diurnal cycle of BC mass concentrations. Weekday <b>hourly</b> <b>median</b> single-scattering albedo (&omega; 0 ) varied in the range 0. 59 – 0. 76. Overall, this suggests a top of atmosphere (TOA) warming effect.

40|$|Ozone (O 3) in {{the lower}} {{troposphere}} is harmful to people and plants, particularly during summer, when photochemistry is most active and higher temperatures favor local chemistry. Local precursor emissions, {{such as those of}} volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NO x), together with their chemistry contribute to the O 3 and NO x mixing ratios in the Houston–Galveston–Brazoria (HGB) region. In addition to local emissions, chemistry and transport, larger-scale factors also contribute to local O 3 and NO x. These additional contributions (often referred to as regional background) are not well quantified within the HGB region, impeding more efficient controls on precursor emissions to achieve compliance with the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for O 3. In this study, we estimate ground-level regional background O 3 and NO x in the HGB region and quantify their decadal-scale trends. We use four different approaches based on principal component analysis (PCA) to quantify background O 3 and NO x. Three of these approaches consist of independent PCA on both O 3 and NO x for both 1 and 8  h levels to compare our results with previous studies and to highlight the effect of both temporal and spatial scales. In the fourth approach, we co-varied O 3, NO x and meteorology. Our results show that the estimation of regional background O 3 has less inherent uncertainty when it was constrained by NO x and meteorology, yielding a statistically significant temporal trend of − 0. 68  ±  0. 27  ppb yr − 1. Likewise, the estimation of regional background NO x trend constrained by O 3 and meteorology was − 0. 04  ±  0. 02  ppb yr − 1 (upper bound) and − 0. 03  ±  0. 01  ppb yr − 1 (lower bound). Our best estimates of the 17 -year average of season-scale background O 3 and NO x were 46. 72  ±  2. 08  ppb and 6. 80  ±  0. 13  ppb (upper bound) or 4. 45  ±  0. 08  ppb (lower bound), respectively. Average background O 3 is consistent with previous studies and between the approaches used in this study, although the approaches based on 8  h averages likely overestimate background O 3 compared to the <b>hourly</b> <b>median</b> approach by 7 – 9  ppb. Similarly, the upper bound of average background NO x is consistent between approaches in this study (A–C) but overestimated compared to the hourly approach by 1  ppb, on average. We likely overestimate the upper-bound background NO x due to instrument overdetection of NO x and the 8  h averaging of NO x and meteorology coinciding with MDA 8 O 3. Regional background O 3 and NO x in the HGB region both have declined over the past 2 decades. This decline became steadier after 2007, overlapping with the effects of controlling precursor emissions and a prevailing southeasterly–southerly flow...|$|E
40|$|The "Sahelian belt" {{is known}} as a region where mineral dust content is {{among the highest in the}} world. In the {{framework}} of the AMMA international Program, a transect of three ground based stations, the "Sahelian Dust Transect" (SDT), has been deployed in order to obtain quantitative information on the mineral dust content over the Sahel. These three stations: Banizoumbou (Niger), Cinzana (Mali) and M'Bour (Senegal) are aligned at 13 degrees N along the east-west main pathway of the Saharan and Sahelian dust toward the Atlantic Ocean. The SDT provides a set of aerosol measurements and local meteorological parameters to describe and understand the mechanisms that control the temporal and regional variability of mineral dust content in these regions. In this work we analyze the seasonal and diurnal variability of the dust concentrations over the period 2006 - 2010. The analysis of the dust concentrations measured between 2006 and 2010 confirmed a regional seasonal cycle characterized by a maximum in the dry season, with median concentration ranging from 205 mu g m(- 3) at Banizoumbou to 144 mu g m(- 3) at M'Bour, and a minimum (11 - 32 mu g m(- 3)) in the wet season. The five year data set allowed the quantification of the variability of the monthly concentrations. The range between the percentiles 75 and 25 varies linearly with the median concentration: it is of the same order than the median value in M'Bour, 17 % slightly higher in Cinzana and 50 % higher in Banizoumbou. The range between the accepted maximum and minimum is also correlated with the median value, with slopes ranging from 14 in Banizoumbou to 7 in M'Bour. Part of the variability of the concentration at the monthly scale is due to interannual variability. Extremely high or low monthly concentration can be recorded that significantly impacts the five year median concentration and its range. Compared to the 3 -year data set analyzed by Marticorena et al. (2010), the two additional years used in this work appear as the less dusty year (2009) and one of the dustier years (2010). The sampling time step and the high recovery rates of the measurement stations allowed to investigate the diurnal cycle of the dust concentration for the first time. During the dry season, the <b>hourly</b> <b>median</b> concentrations range from 80 to 100 mu g m(- 3) during the night to 100 - 160 mu g m(- 3) during the day-time maximum. The diurnal cycle of the PM 10 concentrations is phased with the diurnal cycle of the surface wind speed and thus modulated by the interactions between the nocturnal lower level jet (NLLJ) and the surface boundary layer. The NUJ appears as a major agent to transport Saharan dust toward the Sahel. During the wet season, the median PM 10 concentrations are maximum at night-time (< 50 mu g m(- 3)). The night-time concentrations are associated with a large range of variability and coincide with the periods of higher occurrence of meso-scale convective systems. The amplitude of the diurnal cycle is of the order of 60 mu g m(- 3) in the dry season and 20 mu g m(- 3) in the wet season. Both in the dry and in the wet season, despite a month to month variability of the daily dust concentration, a typical diurnal pattern has been established suggesting that this temporal pattern is mainly driven by local meteorological conditions...|$|E

The relationship found between ionospheric absorption, [...] as measured with a vertical incidence sounder, and signal outtime [...] is summarized. [...] The average diurnal variation in the <b>hourly</b> <b>median</b> signal strength [...] during the different seasons of the year 1954 - 55 is given for all frequencies [...] on both short and long paths in the East-West {{as well as the}} [...] South-North direction. The diurnal variation in signal strength on the [...] 4 me short paths and the 12 me long paths is compared for a year of [...] high solar activity (1949 - 50) and a year of low solar activity (1954 - 55). [...] The discussion of the data reveals that a statistically significant [...] difference in signal in-time for the East-West and South-North paths [...] exists only for the 12 me short paths. The larger percentage of signal [...] in-time found in the East-West direction is believed to be due to a preferential [...] orientation of sporadic ionization along parallels to the auroral [...] zone. [...] A study of the critical frequencies observed for the E and F -layers [...] shows that the difference in daytime variation of median signal strength [...] between the years 1949 - 50 and 1954 - 55 may be explained in terms of the [...] normal changes in F -layer ionization and D -layer absorption in course [...] of a sunspot cycle. The results indicate that in Alaska there will generally [...] be F 2 propagation during daytime of 4 me signals over 350 km [...] paths throughout the solar cycle.
