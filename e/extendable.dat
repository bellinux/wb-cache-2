5|$|David Gilbertson, {{a former}} {{assistant}} inspector {{who had worked for}} the Home Office formulating policing policy, told The New York Times that the British police used to act with the sanction of the public, but that tactics had changed after a series of violent assaults on officers in the 1990s. Now dressing in military-style uniforms and equipped with anti-stab vests, <b>extendable</b> metal batons and clubs that turn into handcuffs, an entire generation of officers has come to regard the public as the enemy, the newspaper said.|$|E
5|$|Citizens {{of member}} {{nations of the}} Gulf Cooperation Council and Jordan may travel to Republic of Lebanon without visa limits for a maximum stay of 6 months per year and 3 months per 6 months respectively, {{citizens}} of the 79 other countries and territories are granted a visa on arrival at Beirut International Airport or any other port of entry {{if there is no}} Israeli stamps, visas, or seals on their passport and are holding a telephone number, address in the Republic of Lebanon, and a non-refundable return or circle trip ticket for a maximum stay of one month, <b>extendable</b> for 2 additional months. Citizens of Brazil and Turkey are instead granted a multiple entry visa valid for a maximum stay of 1 month and 3 months respectively. All visitors must hold a passport valid for 6 months beyond the period of intended stay and with two blank pages. An identity document is accepted in lieu of a passport for Jordanian citizens.|$|E
5|$|The pallid sturgeon's snout {{and head}} are {{longer than that}} of the shovelnose sturgeon. In both species, the mouth is located well back from the tip of the snout. Lacking teeth, they use their <b>extendable</b> mouths to suck up small fish, mollusks, and other food sources from river bottoms. Both species also have four barbels which descend from the snout near the front of the mouth. The barbels are {{believed}} to be sensory features to locate food sources. On pallid sturgeon, the two inner barbels are about half as long as the outer ones, while on the shovelnose sturgeon, all four barbels are the same length. The inner barbels of the pallid sturgeon are positioned in front of the outer ones, but those on the shovelnose sturgeon are all located in essentially a straight line. The length and positioning of the barbels {{is one of the best}} ways to distinguish the two species.|$|E
25|$|Every Hadamard 2-design is <b>extendable</b> (to an Hadamard 3-design).|$|E
25|$|The only <b>extendable</b> {{projective}} planes (symmetric 2-(n2+n+1, n+1, 1) designs) {{are those}} of orders 2 and4.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, means of {{reaching}} tall structures were devised. At first, manually <b>extendable</b> ladders were used; as these grew in length (and weight), {{they were put}} onto two large wheels. When carried by fire engines these wheeled escape ladders had the wheels suspended behind {{the rear of the}} vehicle, making them a distinctive sight. Before long, turntable ladders — which were even longer, mechanically <b>extendable,</b> and installed directly onto fire trucks — made their appearances.|$|E
25|$|Media player device support: Winamp has <b>extendable</b> {{support for}} {{portable}} media players and Mass Storage Compliant devices, Microsoft PlaysForSure, and ActiveSync, and syncs unprotected {{music to the}} iPod.|$|E
25|$|CL-GD5434 – Alpine family chip with 64-bit {{internal}} memory interface. Only supports 64-bit mode {{if equipped}} with 2 MB of video memory; commonly equipped with 1 MB, <b>extendable</b> to 2 MB.|$|E
25|$|S-series – {{launched}} in August 2016. It {{is the highest}} cab Scania has ever built. It features a completely flat floor and a low bed that is <b>extendable</b> up to 100 cm (about 3.28 feet).|$|E
25|$|Visas {{must be used}} within 30 days of approval. Multiple entry visas {{are valid}} for 3 months {{from the time of}} entry. On each entry a maximum length of stay allowed is 1 month, <b>extendable</b> for 2 {{additional}} weeks.|$|E
25|$|Holders of {{a letter}} of {{invitation}} issued by a company registered in Turkmenistan with a prior approval from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs can obtain a visa on arrival valid for 10 days, and <b>extendable</b> for another 10 days.|$|E
25|$|Nationals {{who want}} to get {{multiple}} entry visa or want to have visa <b>extendable</b> up to 5 times or Nationals who are not eligible for visa free entry or visa on arrival need to apply for a visa at an Indonesian embassy or consulate.|$|E
25|$|Citizens of all {{countries}} can obtain a visa on arrival at all border posts {{if they have}} documentation to prove they are traveling for leisure purposes (return ticket, accommodation confirmation or invitation letter). This visa is valid for 30 days, and is <b>extendable</b> up to 60 days. Maputo Airport recently began accepting credit card payments for visas.|$|E
25|$|Lunokhod 1 was a {{lunar vehicle}} formed of a tub-like {{compartment}} {{with a large}} convex lid on eight independently powered wheels. Its length was 2.3 metres. Lunokhod 1 was equipped with a cone-shaped antenna, a highly directional helical antenna, four television cameras, and special <b>extendable</b> devices to impact the lunar soil for density measurements and mechanical property tests.|$|E
25|$|Until 1973, driving {{licences}} (and tax discs) were issued by {{local authorities and}} had to be renewed every three years. In 1971, the decision was taken to computerise the licensing system to enable it to be linked to the Police National Computer and to extend the life of the licence up to the driver's 70th birthday, <b>extendable</b> at intervals thereafter provided the driver can prove fitness.|$|E
25|$|Other {{nationals}} {{arriving from}} a country with no DRC embassy can apply for a visa confirmation ("visa volant"). A letter of request is sent via e-mail to the Direction Générale de Migration with a photocopy of the passport of the applicant and the inviting person/organization. A confirmation {{is sent to the}} applicant which is then used to obtain a visa on arrival, valid for 7 days and <b>extendable</b> in the DRC.|$|E
25|$|MDP {{recruits}} {{are trained}} at the Force Training Centre at Wethersfield on a 16-week fully residential course. The program follows the College of Policing initial learning and development syllabus. An MDP anomaly {{is that there are}} separate English Law and Scottish Law classes dependent on the individual officer’s posting. Recruits are trained in personal safety including PAVA, <b>extendable</b> baton and kwikcuffs. They also receive level three public order training.|$|E
25|$|The building's main structure, the two {{remaining}} uniquely designed <b>extendable</b> gangways and an interior mural known as Foundations of European Settlement by Australian artist Arthur Murch are all listed as individual items of significance within the State Heritage Inventory by the New South Wales Heritage Office. Since 2006, the building and its surroundings have also been listed {{as part of the}} UNESCO World Heritage Site buffer zone for the Sydney Opera House.|$|E
25|$|Other {{species of}} {{scallops}} {{can be found}} on the ocean floor attached to objects by byssal threads. Byssal threads are strong, silky fibers extending from the muscular foot, used to attach to a firm support, such as a rock. Some can also be found on the ocean floor, moving with the use of an <b>extendable</b> foot located between their valves or burrowing themselves in the sand by extending and retracting their feet.|$|E
25|$|Jammu and Kashmir is {{the only}} state in India which enjoys special {{autonomy}} under Article 370 of the Constitution of India, according to which no law enacted by the Parliament of India, except for those in the field of defence, communication and foreign policy, will be <b>extendable</b> in Jammu and Kashmir unless it is ratified by the state legislature of Jammu and Kashmir. Subsequently, jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of India over Jammu and Kashmir has been extended.|$|E
25|$|With {{triggered}} sweeps, {{the scope}} will blank the beam {{and start to}} reset the sweep circuit each time the beam reaches the extreme {{right side of the}} screen. For a period of time, called holdoff, (<b>extendable</b> by a front-panel control on some better oscilloscopes), the sweep circuit resets completely and ignores triggers. Once holdoff expires, the next trigger starts a sweep. The trigger event is usually the input waveform reaching some user-specified threshold voltage (trigger level) in the specified direction (going positive or going negative—trigger polarity).|$|E
25|$|While Sega {{was seeking}} a {{flagship}} series {{to compete with}} Nintendo's Mario series with a character to replace Alex Kidd as the company's mascot, several character designs were submitted by its Sega AM8 research and development department. Many results came forth from their experiments with character design, including an armadillo (who was later developed into Mighty the Armadillo), a dog, a Theodore Roosevelt look-alike in pajamas (who would later {{be the basis of}} Dr. Robotnik/Eggman's design), and a rabbit (who would use its <b>extendable</b> ears to collect objects, an aspect later incorporated in Ristar).|$|E
25|$|Although Police {{officers}} carry only <b>extendable</b> batons and MK-4 OC-spray (pepper spray) whilst on duty, {{they are}} trained {{in the use of}} firearms and are issued firearms in certain situations. Competition shooting with handguns is common within the police. Some of the patrol vehicles are equipped with firearms, longer batons, riot shields and spike strips; the Reykjavík Metropolitan Police, however, do not have firearms in their vehicles, rather it is primarily the special operations team, the Víkingasveitin, and the police out in the more remote areas of the country.|$|E
25|$|Let D = (X, B) be a t-(v,k,λ) {{design and}} p {{a point of}} X. The derived design D'p has point set X{p} and as block set all the blocks of D which contain p with p removed. It is a (t1)-(v1, k1, λ) design. Note that derived designs with respect to {{different}} points may not be isomorphic. A design E is called an extension of D if E has a point p such that Ep is isomorphic to D; we call D <b>extendable</b> if it has an extension.|$|E
25|$|<b>Extendable</b> Ears {{are long}} flesh-coloured strings, {{one end of}} which is {{inserted}} into a user's ear and the other end placed further away towards a conversation or sound. Much like a listening device, the user {{will be able to}} hear the sounds as if they were much closer to the source. They were first introduced by Fred and George Weasley in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, when they used the ears to listen to the Order's meetings, until one was destroyed (and eaten) by Crookshanks.|$|E
25|$|Another {{animated}} series {{also produced}} by Hanna-Barbera, titled The Robonic Stooges, originally {{seen as a}} featured segment on The Skatebirds (CBS, 1977–1978), featuring Moe, Larry, and Curly (voiced by Paul Winchell, Joe Baker and Frank Welker, respectively) as bionic cartoon superheroes with <b>extendable</b> limbs, similar to the later Inspector Gadget. The Robonic Stooges later aired as a separate half-hour series, retitled The Three Robonic Stooges (each half-hour featured two segments of The Three Robonic Stooges and one segment of Woofer & Whimper, Dog Detectives, the latter re-edited from episodes of Clue Club, an earlier Hanna-Barbera cartoon series).|$|E
25|$|Other {{countries}} and territories only offer partially reciprocal treatment to Irish citizens (i.e. visa-free access that is less than 3 months). The following countries permit Irish citizens to stay without a visa for up to 30 days (or 1 month) only: Belize, Kiribati, Maldives, Nauru, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Seychelles (1 month, <b>extendable</b> to 12 months), Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu. Also, the following countries the following countries permit Irish citizens to stay without a visa for less than 3 months: Mauritius (60 days for tourists, 90 days on business), St Lucia (6 weeks), Samoa (60 days) and Swaziland (60 days).|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} of the Supra had optional power windows and power locks {{as part of the}} convenience package. The convenience package also included cruise control and special door trim with door pull straps, with an optional sunroof. As for standard features, in the center console there was an <b>extendable</b> map light and a flip-top armrest, which provided storage. Some other features were the tilt steering wheel, deep zippered pockets {{on the backs of the}} front seats, and a tonneau cover under the liftback. The dashboard also contained a state of the art AM/FM/MPX 4-speaker stereo radio, analog clock, and tachometer as part of the instrument panel.|$|E
25|$|Both the HD and SD serial {{interfaces}} provide for 16 channels of embedded audio. The two interfaces use different audio encapsulation methods— SD uses the SMPTE 272M standard, whereas HD uses the SMPTE 299M standard. In either case, an SDI signal may contain up to sixteen audio channels (8 pairs) embedded 48kHz, 24-bit audio channels {{along with the}} video. Typically, 48kHz, 24-bit (20-bit in SD, but <b>extendable</b> to 24 bit) PCM audio is stored, in a manner directly compatible with the AES3 digital audio interface. These are placed in the (horizontal) blanking periods, when the SDI signal carries nothing useful, since the receiver generates its own blanking signals from the TRS.|$|E
25|$|Excluding minor {{syntactic}} differences, {{there are}} only a couple of exception handling styles in use. In the most popular style, an exception is initiated by a special statement (throw or raise) with an exception object (e.g. with Java or Object Pascal) or a value of a special <b>extendable</b> enumerated type (e.g. with Ada). The scope for exception handlers starts with a marker clause (try or the language's block starter such as begin) and ends in the start of the first handler clause (catch, except, rescue). Several handler clauses can follow, and each can specify which exception types it handles and what name it uses for the exception object.|$|E
25|$|The {{upper stage}} of the Delta IV, or DCSS, {{is based on the}} Delta III upper stage, but with {{increased}} propellant capacity. The 4-meter (13.1ft) version uses lengthened propellant tanks, while the 5-meter version has a 5-meter diameter liquid hydrogen tank and a further lengthened liquid oxygen tank. The second stage is powered by a RL10B2 engine, which features an <b>extendable</b> carbon-carbon nozzle to improve specific impulse. Depending on variant, two different interstages are used to mate the first and second stages. A tapering interstage which narrows down from 5 m to 4 m in diameter is used on 4-meter variants, where a cylindrical interstage is used on 5-meter variants. Both interstages are built from composites.|$|E
25|$|Later, timpani {{were adopted}} into other {{classical}} music ensembles such as concert bands. In the 1970s, marching bands and drum and bugle corps, which evolved both from traditional marching bands and concert bands, began to include marching timpani. Unlike concert timpani, marching versions had fiberglass shells {{to make them}} light enough to carry. Each player carried a single drum, which was tuned by a hand crank. Often, during intricate passages, the timpani players would put their drums on the ground by means of <b>extendable</b> legs, and performed more like conventional timpani, yet with a single player per drum. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, marching arts-based organizations' allowance for timpani and other percussion instruments to be permanently grounded became mainstream. This {{was the beginning of}} the end for marching timpani: Eventually, standard concert timpani found their way onto the football field as part of the front ensemble, and marching timpani fell out of common usage. Timpani are still used by the Mounted Bands of the Household Division of the British Army.|$|E
500|$|... "The Gift" [...] was {{the first}} episode that make-up artist Matthew W. Mungle's company worked on for The X-Files. The soul eater was a {{combination}} of actor Jordan Marder in make-up, and a silicone dummy that featured an <b>extendable</b> mouth and movable teeth.|$|E

500|$|Elite Class, EVA Air's premium economy product, {{is offered}} in a {{dedicated}} cabin on the Boeing 777 and 747-400. Elite Class has wider seating and legroom (in a 2-4-2 layout), and a seat similar to short-haul business class with an <b>extendable</b> leg rest, [...] pitch, adjustable winged headrests, and laptop power. Service levels in Elite Class {{are similar to}} Economy Class, but food and amenities are improved, along with the seating. Elite passengers further receive an amenity kit on most flights.|$|E
