500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic {{gave the}} album {{three out of}} five stars, but felt that the track list could have been shortened. Erlewine complimented some of the remixes, {{including}} those by Pet Shop Boys and Space Cowboy, adding that The Remix [...] "is not an essential addition to Gaga’s canon <b>goes</b> <b>without</b> <b>saying...</b> but there’s glitz and glamour to enjoy here." [...] Mark Beech, reviewing the album for Bloomberg Television, noticed that the already familiar tracks from Gaga [...] "are given a new sheen by the Pet Shop Boys and sometime Madonna producer Stuart Price." [...] Nicki Escudero from Phoenix New Times gave a positive review saying that the songs featured in The Remix {{can be a great}} addition during workouts, as well as staple dance floor music. She listed the Chew Fu remix of [...] "LoveGame" [...] as a highlight from the album. Monica Herrera from Billboard complimented the album saying [...] "Gaga has employed a collection of more-than-capable producers to make her dance-ready smashes from The Fame and The Fame Monster even more danceworthy." [...] Giving it three out of five stars, Caryn Ganz from Rolling Stone noted an uneven sequencing among the tracks in The Remix. She felt that the Passion Pit remix of [...] "Telephone" [...] was the best remix on the album.|$|E
500|$|The {{concerts in}} England and Ireland {{received}} mixed feedback from critics. Kitty Empire (The Observer) was not {{impressed with the}} show at Windsor Hall. Empire wrote, [...] "It's easy to sneer at boy bands, but always worth considering their appeal. It <b>goes</b> <b>without</b> <b>saying</b> that One Direction are slick, and often bland. With the exception of their persuasive No 1 single, [...] "What Makes You Beautiful", their songs aren't wildly distinctive". For the concert at the HMV Hammersmith Apollo in London, James Robertson (Daily Mirror) gave the band a positive review. He states, [...] "The room shook with hair raising, ear drum piercing and (if there had been windows) glass-shattering screams. Each took a turn walking forward to embrace the cries from the sold-out Hammersmith Apollo while singing the lame-named Na, Na, Na. It {{was impossible to tell}} which one of the five boys had the biggest ovation but the loudest cheer came when Niall played acoustic guitar as they sang solo around an artificial camp fire". Another glowing review was done by Alexandra Ryan (Evening Herald) for the concert at Dublin's The O2. She says, [...] "THEY came, they saw, they conquered. Dreams came true for thousands of Irish female fans as their pop idols One Direction took to the stage at the O2. Swarms of screaming girls flocked to the sold-out venue last night as Zayn, Harry, Louis, Liam and Mullingar teen Niall Horan performed for 14,000 fans".|$|E

2500|$|A highly skilful winger, {{considered}} by several pundits {{to be one}} of the greatest dribblers in the history of the sport, Best received plaudits for his playing style, which combined pace, skill, balance, feints, two-footedness, goalscoring and the ability to get past defenders. Recalling Best's career and style of play, Patrick Barclay said: [...] "In terms of ability he was the world’s best footballer of all time. He could do almost anything – technically, speed, complete mastery of not only the ball but his own body. You could saw his legs away and he still wouldn’t fall because his balance was uncanny, almost supernatural.

2500|$|Running over-the-air {{commercials}} was {{an obvious}} financing alternative, but initially Westinghouse officials were soundly against the idea, contending that it would destroy the listening experience. In 1922 J. C.

In 1922, H. P.

2500|$|It {{has been}} known since before the 1960s that a [...] "full-roller" [...] type of {{delivery}} does not hook as well as [...] "3/4 rollers" [...] on oily lanes. On successive rotations, the [...] "full roller" [...] repeatedly contacts the lane on the same full circumferential circle, on which the oil accumulates, {{making it harder for}} the side-roll to find traction and create hooking action. The [...] "full-roller" [...] had been the dominant choice before the changes in lane coatings and oil. The [...] "semi-roller" [...] is now preferred (it may also be called [...] "3/4 roller" [...] or by other slang terms). With a 3/4-roller a bowler puts the ball into a rotation whose contact ring is smaller, and on successive rotations enlarges (subsequent examination of the ball often shows a flaring of the circles of oil). This is because at every spot along the circle, friction reduces the rotation, and that includes the spin component, causing rotation on a continually larger circle. This has the effect of bringing relatively dry ball surface in contact with the lane, increasing traction for both forward-roll and side-roll. It probably <b>goes</b> <b>without</b> <b>saying</b> why bowlers often wipe oil off the ball.|$|E
