5|$|The natural {{resources}} of Devarakota are being exploited by Sashi, {{the brother of}} central minister Venkata Ratnam, whose tyranny has made many locals migrate {{to the city to}} seek a better life. Nevertheless, the village head Narayana Rao hopes that the standard of living will soon improve along with the <b>general</b> <b>condition</b> of the village. Meanwhile, Ratnam's son Radha uses blackmail to threaten harm to Ravikanth's family if he does not back out of a prestigious highway contract. Ravikanth's nephew Karthik, who hopes to succeed Ravikanth in the business empire, leaks to Radha details about an upcoming bid for the contract, which comes to the notice of Harsha. After subtly warning Ratnam at his residence in Delhi, Harsha secretly makes a lower bid on behalf of his father's company and wins the contract.|$|E

30|$|Our results motivate many {{possible}} directions for future research. First, {{an open question}} is whether there exist <b>general</b> <b>conditions</b> under which reference priors yield proper posterior distributions. In addition, the existence of <b>general</b> <b>conditions</b> for posterior propriety may be investigated for Jeffreys-rule and independence Jeffreys priors. The search of <b>general</b> <b>conditions</b> for posterior propriety may benefit from our present work on EP regression and previous literature on examples of impropriety of posterior distributions for distinct objective Bayes priors (Berger et al. 2001; Ferreira and De Oliveira 2007; Salazar et al. 2012; Wasserman 2000).|$|R

5|$|To {{adapt the}} dogs to the {{confines}} of the tiny cabin of Sputnik 2, they were kept in progressively smaller cages for periods of up to 20 days. The extensive close confinement caused them to stop urinating or defecating, made them restless, and caused their <b>general</b> <b>condition</b> to deteriorate. Laxatives did not improve their condition, and the researchers found that only long periods of training proved effective. The dogs were placed in centrifuges that simulated the acceleration of a rocket launch and were placed in machines that simulated the noises of the spacecraft. This caused their pulses to double and their blood pressure to increase by 30–65 torr. The dogs were trained to eat a special high-nutrition gel that would be their food in space.|$|E

This appointment is a legal commitment by both contractor and supervisor, and the format may be prescribed. In many cases the supervisor may be appointed to supervise the contractor's diving operations as a <b>general</b> <b>condition</b> of employment, but the requirement {{to ensure that the}} supervisor is competent and fit to supervise any specific operation remains the responsibility of both contractor and supervisor. These requirements do not generally preclude hiring a supervisor as a subcontractor, but this does not generally transfer the responsibilities of the contractor.|$|E

Small localized squamous-cell cancers may be treated with surgery alone with the hope of a cure. In most other cases, chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy is used along with surgery. Larger tumors may have their growth slowed with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. In the presence of extensive disease or if the affected person is not fit enough to undergo surgery, palliative care is often recommended.|$|E
25|$|After the surrender, Varley, {{along with}} the {{majority}} of his fellow AIF captives were imprisoned at Selarang Barracks near Changi Prison. When the first major contingent of Australian prisoners, totaling around 3,000 men and designated A Force departed Changi, Varley was placed in command. A Force was shipped in cramped conditions to Burma where it was engaged in the construction of airfields. Initially, conditions were good and men were paid for their work (although the Japanese deducted expenses) which allowed them to buy rations. Consequently, the prisoner's <b>general</b> <b>condition</b> improved from what it was in Changi. To capitalise on this, Varley endeavoured to keep as many men as possible working. Eventually, the airfield work was completed, and in September 1942, A Force was shipped to Thanbyuzayat to start work on the Burma-Thailand Railway.|$|E

25|$|The {{management}} of wildlife is restricted to, firstly, {{the protection of}} fauna from poaching, and, secondly, designation of some areas as wildlife sanctuaries where no extraction of forest produce is allowed and where the wildlife face few disturbances. Although the fauna of Bangladesh have diminished in recent times and the Sundarbans has not been spared from this decline, the mangrove forest retains several good wildlife habitats and their associated fauna. Of these, the tiger and dolphin are target species for planning wildlife management and tourism development. There are high profile and vulnerable mammals living in two contrasting environments, and their statuses and management are strong indicators of the <b>general</b> <b>condition</b> and {{management of}} wildlife. Some species are protected by legislation, notably by the Bangladesh Wildlife (Preservation) Order, 1973 (P.O. 23 of 1973).|$|E

500|$|The {{text that}} Tippett {{prepared}} follows the three-part structure used in Handel's Messiah, in which Part I is prophetic and preparatory, Part II narrative and epic, Part III meditative and metaphysical. In A Child of Our Time the <b>general</b> <b>condition</b> of oppression {{is defined in}} the first part, the narrative elements are confined to the second part, while the third part contains interpretation and reflection on a possible healing. [...] Tippett perceived the work as a general depiction of man's inhumanity to man, and wanted Grynszpan's tragedy [...] to stand for the oppressed everywhere. To preserve the universality of the work, Tippett avoids all use of proper names for people and places: thus, Paris is [...] "a great city", Grynszpan becomes [...] "the boy", the soprano is [...] "the boy's mother", vom Rath is [...] "the official".|$|E
500|$|During {{the mid to}} late 19th {{century the}} school fell into {{disrepair}} and decay. Guildford Municipal Charities established a committee to report into the <b>general</b> <b>condition</b> of the school and the buildings. The committee reported in 1881 that the school had no funds available for repairs and that there were only nine boys [...] "instead of the former ordinary number of 100". Various suggestions were made by the Charity Commission to raise funds for the school, including a reorganisation with Archbishop Abbot's School. [...] The Committee for Maintaining Higher Education in Guildford was established in March 1887 to oppose the Charity Commission's draft scheme to amalgamate the RGS, Nettle's Charity and Archbishop Abbot's School. The committee raised [...] (approximately £108,000 in 2010) towards the restoration of the RGS, ensuring its survival. A new Charity Commission scheme came into effect in November 1888 which resulted in the Old Building being restored, and the school's continuation as a day only school. Several years later under the Education Act 1944 the school adopted voluntary controlled status; tuition was therefore free and entrance was to be by common examination at the age of eleven.|$|E
