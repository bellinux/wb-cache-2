[...] On Carey's official Facebook page on May 12, 2012, shortly after the release, she wrote, [...] "I spent four years writing this song, only because after I performed in Schenectady, NY, I started hearing this melody and singing {{it over and over}} to myself as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> a bath, looking at the moon.. Four years later, as I was leaving a devastating part of my life behind, I wrote the second verse, the bridge and the outro." ...|$|E
500|$|The title The Cookbook derived of Elliott feeling [...] "no two {{records are}} going to sound alike; each record has its own spices and herbs. Each record is cooking up a hot recipe for a hot album." [...] The black and white cover {{features}} Elliott posing with a vintage microphone in a 1920s juke joint. She explained the cover, saying, [...] "I wanted people to see <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> music back to the roots—not just hip hop, but our ancestors. Whether they was on railroad tracks or cooking in somebody's kitchen, they was always singing." ...|$|E
500|$|Of his law {{practice}} in Manchester, Combs later noted: [...] "I {{had too many}} kinfolks and friends in Manchester, and they all expected me to handle things as a favor... Then they'd get their feelings hurt if I charged them. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> {{in a lot of}} cases, but not sending out many bills." [...] In 1938, Combs accepted an offer from a law school classmate named LeRoy Combs (no relation) to join his father and uncle's law firm in Prestonsburg. Prestonsburg was closer to his wife's home in Knott County. Combs' son Tommy suffered from a form of mental retardation, the result of an injury sustained at birth. After moving to Prestonsburg, Combs started a class for people with mental retardation, in part so Tommy could attend the class.|$|E

500|$|As Travolta did {{not attend}} to collect his trophies, an action figure of Terl, his character, {{accepted}} them in his place. Travolta responded a week later to the awards: [...] "I didn't even know there were such awards. I have people around me {{whose job it is}} to not tell me about such things. They're obviously doing their job. Not every film can be a critical and box office success. It would have been awful only if Battlefield Earth was neither. That's not the case. It is edging toward the $100m mark which means it has found an audience even if it didn't impress critics. I'd rather my films connect with audiences than with critics because it gives you more longevity as a performer." [...] He later insisted that he still felt [...] "really good about it. Here <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> big chances, breaking a new genre." ...|$|E
500|$|Eckhart first gained wide {{exposure}} in 2000 as George, a ponytailed, goateed biker, in Steven Soderbergh's drama Erin Brockovich. The film {{was met with}} reasonable reviews, and was a box office success, earning $256million worldwide. His performance was well received by critics; Entertainment Weeklys Owen Gleiberman wrote that Eckhart [...] "may be playing {{a bit of an}} ideal [...] but he makes goodness as palpable as he did yuppie evil in 'In the Company of Men'." [...] In an August 2004 interview, Eckhart claimed that he had not worked for nearly a year before he was cast in the movie. [...] "I felt like I sort of was getting away from what I wanted to do as an actor. [...] I had nine months off, but it wasn't a vacation. Sure, I didn't earn any money for nine months, but every day I was reading scripts, I was producing my own material, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> meetings, I was working on my craft." ...|$|E
500|$|On the {{afternoon}} of this day <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> a walk with the steward of the convent in the neighbourhood, and as we returned, towards sunset, he begged me to take some refreshment {{with him in his}} cell. Scarcely had he entered the room, when, resuming our former subject of conversation, he said: [...] "And I, too, have read a Septuagint" [...] – i.e. a copy of the Greek translation made by the Seventy. And so saying, he took down from {{the corner of the room}} a bulky kind of volume, wrapped up in a red cloth, and laid it before me. I unrolled the cover, and discovered, to my great surprise, not only those very fragments which, fifteen years before, I had taken out of the basket, but also other parts of the Old Testament, the New Testament complete, and, in addition, the Epistle of Barnabas and a part of the Shepherd of Hermas.|$|E

500|$|... "Danke Schoen" [...] {{is one of}} the {{recurring}} motifs in the film and is sung by Ferris, Ed Rooney, and Jeanie. Hughes called it the [...] "most awful song of my youth. Every time it came on, I just wanted to scream, claw my face. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> German in high school—which meant that we listened to it in school. I couldn't get away from it." [...] According to Broderick, Ferris's singing [...] "Danke Schoen" [...] in the shower was his idea. [...] "Although it's only because of the brilliance of John's deciding that I should sing [...] "Danke Schoen" [...] on the float in the parade. I had never heard the song before. I was learning it for the parade scene. So we're doing the shower scene and I thought, 'Well, I can do a little rehearsal.' And I did something with my hair to make that Mohawk. And you know what good directors do: they say, 'Stop! Wait till we roll.' And John put that stuff in." ...|$|E
500|$|At the 1963 {{convention}} of the newly formed East Coast Homophile Organizations, the audience heard a speaker named Dr. Albert Ellis tell them that [...] "the exclusive homosexual" [...] was a psychopath. Articles and essays in The Ladder sometimes carried these viewpoints, since {{it was difficult to}} get psychiatrists and doctors to address homosexuality in any form. Gittings said, [...] "People like Ellis talked about homosexuality being a sickness. And they talked about a cure...We'd sit there and listen and politely applaud and then go for the social hour afterward." [...] However, after Dr. Ellis spoke, so did gay activist Frank Kameny, making an impression upon Gittings with his point that it is useless to try to find cures and causes for homosexuality since there is no valid evidence that it is an illness. Said Gittings, [...] "My thinking didn't change until Frank Kameny came along and he said plainly and firmly and unequivocally that homosexuality is no kind of sickness or disease or disorder or malfunction, it is fully on par with heterosexuality...Suddenly I found that I was looking at things that had happened in the past in a very different light and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> a position that was increasingly diverging from DOB’s positions." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's {{title and}} opening track, [...] "Dance Again", {{was written by}} RedOne, Enrique Iglesias, Bilal [...] "The Chef", AJ Junior and Pitbull, who is also {{featured}} in the song. After hearing a demo version of the track, she begged Iglesias to let her record the song, telling {{him that it was}} [...] "her song". Lopez, who was going through a divorce with Marc Anthony and the [...] "breakup of a family", felt as if the song had come to her at the [...] "perfect moment". According to Lopez, the period was devastating because family is very important to her. Lopez revealed: [...] "I had to turn that into something better"; she thought: [...] "I don't want to just survive it, I want to come out better than that." [...] Lopez didn't want to be [...] "the woman who stayed in bed for months". [...] "I knew I had to get through it. I'd dance every day, I'd work out, I'd say a little prayer and I still wouldn't feel any better. Then I'd go to bed and get up the next day and do it all again. It was a process, and it very gradually got a little easier ... I had to do it for my kids. I had to get through it for them." [...] She re-wrote parts of the verses to better relate to her experiences. The song [...] "helped lift her out of the darkness" [...] and gave her hope again. Looking back on the song in December 2012, Lopez stated that: [...] "'Dance Again' became my anthem ... an expression of what I needed to do at that time in my life and for what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> on with [...] It was a beautiful metaphor that became my reality." ...|$|E

500|$|On the {{recommendation}} of Cabranes, Sotomayor was hired {{out of law school}} as an assistant district attorney under New York County District Attorney Robert Morgenthau starting in 1979. [...] She said at the time that she did so with conflicted emotions: [...] "There was a tremendous amount of pressure from my community, from the third world community, at Yale. They could not understand why <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> this job. I'm not sure I've ever resolved that problem." [...] It was a time of crisis-level crime rates and drug problems in New York, Morgenthau's staff was overburdened with cases, and like other rookie prosecutors, Sotomayor was initially fearful of appearing before judges in court. [...] Working in the trial division, she handled heavy caseloads as she prosecuted everything from shoplifting and prostitution to robberies, assaults, and murders. She also worked on cases involving police brutality. She was not afraid to venture into tough neighborhoods or endure squalid conditions in order to interview witnesses. [...] In the courtroom, she was effective at cross examination and at simplifying a case in ways to which a jury could relate. [...] In 1983 in her highest profile case she helped convict the [...] "Tarzan Murderer" [...] (who acrobatically entered apartments, robbed them, and shot residents for no reason). [...] She felt lower-level crimes were largely products of socioeconomic environment and poverty, but she had a different attitude about serious felonies: [...] "No matter how liberal I am, I'm still outraged by crimes of violence. Regardless of whether I can sympathize with the causes that lead these individuals to do these crimes, the effects are outrageous." [...] Hispanic-on-Hispanic crime was of particular concern to her: [...] "The saddest crimes for me were the ones that my own people committed against each other." [...] In general, she showed a passion for bringing law and order to the streets of New York, displaying special zeal in pursuing child pornography cases, unusual for the time. [...] She worked 15-hour days and gained a reputation for being driven and for her preparedness and fairness. [...] One of her job evaluations labelled her a [...] "potential superstar". Morgenthau later described her as [...] "smart, hard-working, [...] a lot of common sense," [...] and as a [...] "fearless and effective prosecutor." [...] She stayed a typical length of time in the post and had a common reaction to the job: [...] "After a while, you forget there are decent, law-abiding people in life." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the funeral}} service, her {{daughter}} Luci Baines Johnson gave a eulogy, saying, [...] "A {{few weeks before}} Mother died, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> visiting relatives to the extraordinary Blanton Art Museum...Mother was on IV antibiotics, a feeding tube, and oxygen, but she wasn't gonna let little things like that deter her from discovering another great art museum.

2500|$|The {{music of}} BLACKsummers'night {{is rooted in}} general soul music, and it {{features}} a more straightforward musical structure than Maxwell's previous work such as Embrya (1998).

In an interview with Pete Lewis of Blues & Soul, Maxwell stated [...] "The inspiration was real life itself. You know, while <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> time away from the industry, I came across a relationship that took me by surprise." ...|$|E
2500|$|Frederick {{described}} {{his account of}} the litigation: [...] "Erhard sent seven lawyers to the courtroom; I had one.

The judge must have thought that we were arguing over some might trivial scribblings, because he just looked up quizzingly over his Franklin specs and threw the whole case right out the door." [...] Erhard filed three lawsuits against Frederick, claiming copyright infringement. All of est/Erhard's suits were ruled 'nuisance claims'and summarily [...] "thrown out of court" [...] in 1976.|$|E
2500|$|Gimblett's own words, {{quoted in}} the Foot biography, tell the story.

I couldn't offer any reason why and I don't think the medical profession knew either." [...] In the winter of 1953-54, Gimblett spent 16 weeks in Tone Vale Hospital, a psychiatric institution, where he was given electro-convulsive therapy, and was released in time to join the Somerset team {{for the start of}} the 1954 season. He played in the first two county matches of the new season, but was not fit enough mentally to continue and– though the details vary– Somerset agreed to give him time off. He did not appear in first-class cricket again. Later in the 1954 season, according to Gimblett's own report, he went to Somerset's Taunton ground to watch some of the cricket, and was [...] "ordered out of the ground".|$|E

Once the plane was approaching the British coast, they drew their guns and grenades and approached the cockpit, demanding entrance. According to Khaled, {{in an interview in}} 2000,"So half an hour (after take off) we had to move. We stood up. I had my two hand grenades and I showed everybody <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> the pins out with my teeth. Patrick stood up. We heard shooting just the same minute and when we crossed the first class, people were shouting but I didn't see who was shooting because it was behind us. So Patrick told me 'go forward I protect your back.' So I went and then he found a hostess {{and she was going to}} catch me round the legs. So I rushed, reached to the cockpit, it was closed. [...] So I was screaming 'open the door.' Then the hostess came; she said 'she has two hand grenades,' but they did not open (the cockpit door) and suddenly I was threatening to blow up the plane. I was saying 'I will count and if you don't open I will blow up the plane.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Having {{spent his}} early years {{in front of the}} cameras on Leave it to Beaver as [...] "Gilbert Bates" [...] (56 episodes), Talbot {{abandoned}} acting for a career as a journalist. In an article in Salon.com he looked back with a sense of humor about his past role. [...] "In the interests of historical accuracy I should say that, yes, Gilbert was a troublemaker and an occasional liar, but my character was certainly no Eddie Haskell – that leering teenage hypocrite who spoke unctuously to parents ('Well, hello Mrs. Cleaver, and how is young Theodore today?') and venomously to the Beav ('Hey, squirt, take a powder before I squash you like a bug')."! [...] "I have spent my adult life trying to conceal my Leave it to Beaver past or correcting the historical record. Either way the series has become inescapable. When I was a kid, I loved acting; in fact, I badgered my father and mother until they allowed me to work. But how could I have known as an innocent 9-year-old that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> part in a television program that would live on for 40 years as an icon for baby boomers? In the early '80s, I turned down an offer to revive my role as Gilbert in a dreadful Beaver reunion series.
