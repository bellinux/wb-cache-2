40|$|One of the {{recommended}} control measures for Salmonella enterica is improved or adequate fann hygiene. Although loosely defined, {{a component of}} <b>good</b> <b>hygiene</b> <b>practice</b> is to minimize animal contact with feces. Increased exposure to feces would he expected to {{increase the likelihood of}} transmission and fecal shedding of Salmonella enterica. There are indications in the literature that decreased animal contact with feces may result in a decreased risk for Salmonella enterica infection. Davies et al. demonstrated increased mean prevalence in open-flush gutter and dirt lot systems when compared to pigs housed on total slatted flooring systems. Paradoxically, three-site, all-in!all-out pig flow systems did not have a significantly different mean Salmonella enterica prevalence when compared to one-site continuous flow fanns. A similar incongruity is the evidence that in poultry barns, birds placed on used litter had lower risk of salmonella shedding than birds placed on clean litter. (5) Proposed mechanisms of this result are colonization with competitive flora from the used litter as well as an inhibitory environment for Salmonella enterica. The subjective nature of determining adequate hygiene as well as the presence of apparently contradictory results regarding hygiene and prevalence of Salmonella shedding in animals warrants inquiry into the question of what is good hygiene in respect to Salmonella shedding in animals...|$|E

40|$|The ‘hygiene hypothesis’ as {{originally}} formulated by Strachan, proposes that {{a cause of}} the recent rapid rise in atopic disorders could be a lower incidence of infection in early childhood, transmitted by unhygienic contact with older siblings. Use of the term ‘hygiene hypothesis’ has led to several interpretations, {{some of which are}} not supported by a broader survey of the evidence. The increase in allergic disorders does not correlate with the decrease in infection with pathogenic organisms, nor can it be explained by changes in domestic hygiene. A consensus is beginning to develop round the view that more fundamental changes in lifestyle have led to decreased exposure to certain microbial or other species, such as helminths, that are important for the development of immunoregulatory mechanisms. Although this review concludes that the relationship of the hypothesis to hygiene practice is not proven, it lends strong support to initiatives seeking to improve hygiene practice. It would however be helpful if the hypothesis were renamed, e. g. as the ‘microbial exposure’ hypothesis, or ‘microbial deprivation’ hypothesis, as proposed for instance by Bjorksten. Avoiding the term ‘hygiene’ would help focus attention on determining the true impact of microbes on atopic diseases, while minimizing risks of discouraging <b>good</b> <b>hygiene</b> <b>practice...</b>|$|E
40|$|The International Commission on Microbiological Specifications for Foods (ICMSF) has {{recently}} proposed a scheme {{for the management}} of microbial hazards for foods that involves the concept of food safety objectives (FSOs). FSOs are intended to specify the maximum levels of hazardous agents required to meet a given public health goal. This scheme offers flexibility for the food industry in terms of allowing the use of alternative but equivalent means for achieving a given FSO. This paper illustrates the application of the ICMSF model via the analysis of the microbiological hazard of Staphylococcus aureus in cream- lled baked goods. Cream-filled baked goods have a notorious history as vehicles for foodborne illness, particularly staphylococcal food poisoning. Although the numbers of cases reported in the United States and Europe have declined in recent years, staphylococcal food poisoning may be much more common than is recognized, particularly in other countries. The ICMSF principles for setting FSOs and the use of performance criteria, process criteria, and validation in relation to hazard analysis critical control point and <b>good</b> <b>hygiene</b> <b>practice</b> plans for managing S. aureus in cream-filled baked goods are described.

The main difference is that in ISO 22000 systems like Good Manufacturing Practice and <b>Good</b> <b>Hygiene</b> <b>Practice</b> are prerequisites thus leading to lower number of CCPs. In this case study for example, the number of CCPs dropped from eight (8) in HACCP to four (4) in ISO 22000.

40|$|Demodex {{has been}} {{considered}} to be related with multiple skin disorders, but controversy persists. In this case-control study, a survey was conducted with 860 dermatosis patients aged 12 to 84 years in Xi’an, China to identify the association between facial dermatosis and Demodex. Amongst the patients, 539 suffered from facial dermatosis and 321 suffered from non-facial dermatosis. Demodex mites were sampled and examined using the skin pressurization method. Multivariate regression analysis was applied to analyze the association between facial dermatosis and Demodex infestation, and to identify the risk factors of Demodex infestation. The results showed that total detection rate of Demodex was 43. 0 %. Patients aged above 30 years had higher odds of Demodex infestation than those under 30 years. Compared to patients with neutral skin, patients with mixed, oily, or dry skin {{were more likely to}} be infested with Demodex (odds ratios (ORs) were 2. 5, 2. 4, and 1. 6, respectively). Moreover, Demodex infestation was found to be statistically associated with rosacea (OR= 8. 1), steroid-induced dermatitis (OR= 2. 7), seborrheic dermatitis (OR= 2. 2), and primary irritation dermatitis (OR= 2. 1). In particular, ORs calculated from the severe infestation (≥ 5 mites/cm 2) rate were significantly higher than those of the total rate. Therefore, we concluded that Demodex is associated with rosacea, steroid-induced dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis, and primary irritation dermatitis. The rate of severe infestation is found to be more correlated with various dermatosis than the total infestation rate. The risk factors of Demodex infestation, age, and skin types were identified.

Fifty samples of imported frozen liver were randomly collected from different shops at Kafr El-Sheikh Governorate for isolation of S. typhimurium, S. enteritidies, and E. coli O 157 :H 7.

40|$|The main {{conclusions}} {{of this report}} are that antimicrobial-resistant bacteria are transmitted to humans through the food chain, although the contribution of this transmission pathway to the overall problem of AMR in humans is not readily quantified. Measures aimed at reducing or eliminating bacteria from food, e. g. cooking, <b>good</b> <b>hygiene</b> <b>practice,</b> {{can be expected to}} substantially reduce the risk of transmission of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria through the food chain. Antimicrobial resistance is driven by antimicrobial consumption; there is intense use of antimicrobials in at least some sectors of primary food production in Ireland, and there is scope to reduce use. This is required as part of an all-sector response to reduce and improve antimicrobial use, and the National Interdepartmental Antimicrobial Resistance Consultative Committee is a key structure to manage this process. There are gaps in current systems for surveillance of antimicrobial use in food production and of AMR in the food chain, and integration and analysis of human and non-human antimicrobial resistance data are lacking. A key recommendation includes reducing the demand for antimicrobial use in primary production by improving preventive measures. When required, prudent use of antimicrobial agents should be supported by improving training and therapeutic guidelines, equivalent regulatory control of all antimicrobial formulations, developing targets and incentives for each animal sector to drive more prudent use and by developing systems that allow more targeted delivery of antimicrobial agents to the animals that actually need to receive them. Systems to improve surveillance of antimicrobial use and of AMR should be further developed and findings published annually as an integrated human and food chain report...|$|E
