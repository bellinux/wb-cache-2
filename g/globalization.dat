5|$|The CCP {{views the}} world as {{organized}} into two opposing camps; socialist and capitalist. They insist that socialism, {{on the basis of}} historical materialism, will eventually triumph over capitalism. In recent years, when the party has been asked to explain the capitalist <b>globalization</b> occurring, the party has returned to the writings of Karl Marx. Despite admitting that <b>globalization</b> developed through the capitalist system, the party's leaders and theorist argue that <b>globalization</b> is not intrinsically capitalist. The reason being that if <b>globalization</b> was purely capitalist, it would exclude an alternative socialist form of modernity. <b>Globalization,</b> as with the market economy, therefore does not have one specific class character (neither socialist nor capitalist) according to the party. The insistence that <b>globalization</b> is not fixed in nature comes from Deng's insistence that China can pursue socialist modernization by incorporating elements of capitalism. Because of this there is considerable optimism within the CCP that despite the current capitalist dominance of <b>globalization,</b> <b>globalization</b> can be turned into a vehicle supporting socialism.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, Suzanne Bergeron, for example, raises {{examples}} {{of studies that}} illustrate the multifaceted effects of <b>globalization</b> on women, including Kumudhini Rosa's study of Sri Lankan, Malaysian, and Philippine, workers in free trade zones {{as an example of}} local resistance to <b>globalization.</b> Women there use their wages to create women's centers aimed at providing legal and medical services, libraries and cooperative housing, to local community members. Such efforts, Bergeron highlights, allow women the chance to take control of economic conditions, increase their sense of individualism, and alter the pace and direction of <b>globalization</b> itself.|$|E
5|$|Another {{development}} {{that lead to}} the shift to modern <b>globalization</b> was the development of a more politicized system. Proto-globalization period marked a steady expansion of larger states from the Indonesian islands to northern Scandinava. The settlement of these individuals made it easier for governments to tax, develop an army, labor force, and create a sustainable economy. The development and streamlining of these cultural aspects lead to an increase in peripheral players in the game of <b>globalization.</b> The stable legal institutions developed in the late proto-globalization and early modern <b>globalization</b> period established economic advances, intellectual property rights (more predominantly in England), general geographical stability, and generational societal improvement.|$|E

5|$|During the pre-modern era early {{forms of}} <b>globalization</b> were already {{beginning}} to affect a world system, marking a period that historian A. G.

5|$|<b>Globalization</b> at {{this time}} was {{hindered}} by war, diseases and population growth in certain areas.

Eventually, the Ricardian theory of economics became prominent and allowed for improved trade regulations, specifically with Portugal.|$|E

5|$|Economic <b>globalization</b> grew under free trade, {{starting}} in 1860 when the United Kingdom {{entered into a}} free trade agreement with France known as the Cobden–Chevalier Treaty. However, the golden age of this wave of <b>globalization</b> endured a return to protectionism between 1880 and 1914. In 1879, German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck introduced protective tariffs on agricultural and manufacturing goods, making Germany the first nation to institute new protective trade policies. In 1892, France introduced the Méline tariff, greatly raising customs duties on both agricultural and manufacturing goods. The United States maintained strong protectionism during most of the nineteenth century, imposing customs duties between 40 and 50% on imported goods. Despite these measures, international trade continued to grow without slowing. Paradoxically, foreign trade grew at a much faster rate during the protectionist phase of the first wave of <b>globalization</b> than during the free trade phase sparked by the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Feminist economists' work on <b>globalization</b> is {{diverse and}} multifaceted. But {{much of it}} is tied {{together}} through detailed and nuanced studies {{of the ways in which}} <b>globalization</b> affects women in particular and how these effects relate to socially just outcomes. Often country case studies are used for these data. Some feminist economists focus on policies involving the development of <b>globalization.</b> For example, Lourdes Benería argues that economic development in the Global South depends in large part on improved reproductive rights, gender equitable laws on ownership and inheritance, and policies that are sensitive to the proportion of women in the informal economy. Additionally, Nalia Kabeer discusses the impacts of a social clause that would enforce global labor standards through international trade agreements, drawing on fieldwork from Bangladesh. She argues that although these jobs may appear exploitative, for many workers in those areas they present opportunities and ways to avoid more exploitative situations in the informal economy.|$|E

Finally, <b>globalization</b> has reduced the importance of resource extraction and manufacturing in the economy and increased the importance of fields in which the creative class participate.|$|E

5|$|Following {{research}} of systemic crises that plagued developing countries throughout the 1990s, economists {{have reached a}} consensus that liberalization of capital flows carries important prerequisites if these countries are to observe the benefits offered by financial <b>globalization.</b> Such conditions include stable macroeconomic policies, healthy fiscal policy, robust bank regulations, and strong legal protection of property rights. Economists largely favor adherence to an organized sequence of encouraging foreign direct investment, liberalizing domestic equity capital, and embracing capital outflows and short-term capital mobility only once the country has achieved functioning domestic capital markets and established a sound regulatory framework. An emerging market economy must develop a credible currency {{in the eyes of}} both domestic and international investors to realize benefits of <b>globalization</b> such as greater liquidity, greater savings at higher interest rates, and accelerated economic growth. If a country embraces unrestrained access to foreign capital markets without maintaining a credible currency, it becomes vulnerable to speculative capital flights and sudden stops, which carry serious economic and social costs.|$|E

A Newton–Krylov {{method is}} an {{implementation}} of Newton’s method {{in which a}} Krylov subspace method is used to solve approximately the linear subproblems that determine Newton steps.
