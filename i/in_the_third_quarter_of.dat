5|$|Donnchadh {{was the son}} of Gille-Brighde, son of Fergus, king of the Gall-Gaidhil.

The name Gille-Brighde, used by Donnchadh's father (Fergus' son), was also {{the name of the father}} of Somhairle, petty king of Argyll <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> the 12th century. As the original territory of the Gall-Gaidhil kingdom probably adjoined or included Argyll, Alex Woolf has suggested that Fergus and Somhairle were brothers or cousins.|$|E

5|$|By 2000, Gas Powered Games {{had begun}} {{to search for a}} {{publisher}} for the game. Taylor claims that multiple publishers were interested in the game, but he was convinced by Ed Fries to partner with the newly established Microsoft Game Studios. Although Microsoft's publishing wing was established in part to publish games for the newly announced Xbox console, Gas Powered Games and Microsoft did not strongly consider bringing the game to the console. Taylor believes that this was due {{to the size of the}} game itself, as well as the small market for role-playing games on consoles at the time. Dungeon Siege was initially planned for release <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> 2001, before being delayed to the following year, and Gas Powered Games spent the added time tuning and polishing the game and expanding the game's items and multiplayer features.

Reviewers at Electronic Gaming Monthly cited the cooperative multiplayer mode and challenging levels as the game's strongest points. They declared it one of the best shooters on the SNES and compared it to the Neo Geo game NAM-1975. GamePro praised the game for its intense action, fun cooperative multiplayer mode, colorful graphics, and ability to shoot almost any on-screen object. They remarked that the game is difficult even on easy, but that players are rewarded for perseverance. Nintendo Power found the game to have good graphics and control, and complimented the presence of both male and female playable characters. However, they believed the game was not as challenging as other shooters. A 32X version was reportedly planned for 1996, but never materialized.|$|E
