40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Accurate costing information is required to support decision making in modern manufacturing enterprises in order {{to compete in a}} global market. It is widely accepted that costing information may be supplied by using distributed costing systems based on a number of emerging cost accounting philosophies. However, the full benefits of incorporating these costing systems have yet to be realised because of difficulties in accessing distributed information and limitations in current practices in the design and building of costing systems. These limitations include difficulty in integrat <b>ing</b> costing with <b>manufacturing</b> systems, a lack of flexibility and an inability to adapt to change. The thesis focuses on the derivation of a methodology to enable the realisation {{of a new generation of}} integrated and distributed costing systems which overcomes the above limitations. (A schematic representation outlining the issues around which the research work is structured is shown overleaf). The research examines two broad fields; cost accounting (indicated by part [a]) and advanced manUffiCtUring technology (shown by part [b]). Examination of current practice in the design and operation of costing systems in manufacturing industry (shown by part [c]) led to the identification of life-cycle requirements (embracing the design, build, operation and change phases) of a new generation of distributed costing systems. Structured design and analysis methodologies, computer communication, information management mechanisms and integration methods (including the use of an integrating infrastructure) were incorporated to assist the design, build and operate phases of the life-cycle (shown by part [d]). A novel feature of the work involves designing mechanisms which enable cost models created at the design phase to be formally associated with the operation phase. The life-cycle methodology was demonstrated by designing and building a proof-of-concept prototype activity-based costing software system (shown by part [e]) which was implemented in a case-study (shown by part [f]). The case-study demonstrates the benefits of the methodology by showing how results of cost analysis may be utilised by other distributed applications on a run-time basis (shown by part [g]).

40|$|Manufacturing {{organizations}} {{around the}} globe are now leaning towards just-in time or customized production {{in order to gain}} competitive advantage in an ever more intense marketplace. The problem with customized or variant production is that, organizations have to track the different product parts precisely {{in order to ensure that}} the right part is at the right place in the right amount at the right time, to deliver customized products to their customers. Due to this reason, companies are now increasingly using RFID technology to track production in real-time. The wide spread deployment of RFID technology for production monitoring and tracking is impeded by the fact that the technology is inherently unreliable and RFID readers suffer from errors such as duplicate, false, missed and out of order readings. In this work we have presented algorithms to a) enable real-time tracking and monitoring of product parts on the production lines, b) provide probabilistic guarantees to the real-time product parts that are being tracked c) enable the RFID readers to self-calibrate their reader probabilities so that the readings that they generate are highly reliable at all times <b>d)</b> generate complex <b>manufacturing</b> events and provide probabilistic guarantees for the accuracy of these complex manufacturing events. In particular the following contributions are made in this thesis. As a first contribution, we developed a consistency stack that conceptually divides the different consistency/reliability issues in production monitoring into separate layers. In addition to this we have built a consistency management framework to ensure consistent real-time production monitoring, using unreliable RFID devices. Secondly, we deal with the problem of detecting object sequences by a set of unreliable RFID readers that are installed along production lines. We propose a probabilistic sequence detection algorithm that assigns probabilities to objects detected by RFID devices and provides probabilistic guarantees regarding the real-time sequences of objects on the production lines. Thirdly, we developed a probabilistic model to assign probabilities to the RFID readers and to the product part detections. We also present a probability self-calibration algorithm that automatically adapts the probabilities of RFID readers to better reflect their performance at current instance of time. This would ensure that unreliable RFID devices would have little or no say in the overall production monitoring and tracking within the production environment. The use of RFID technology in manufacturing and production is still limited because of the non-availability of middleware solutions to transform raw RFID data into higher level meaningful information. So as our fourth contribution, we present a complex event processing framework that can be deployed in manufacturing environments. The framework is capable of processing raw RFID events to generate complex manufacturing events that are of relevance to the production operations. The framework assigns probabilities to each complex event, which are continuously updated as more information is made available regarding these events. This provides a measure to the higher level applications about how accurate or inaccurate a certain complex event really is...|$|R

Recently, a novel 3 D printing platform, Multi 3 <b>D</b> <b>manufacturing,</b> {{was funded by the}} presidential initiative for revitalizing manufacturing in the USA using 3 D printing (America Makes - also known as the National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Institute). The Multi 3 D system specifically targets 3 D printed electronics in arbitrary form; and building upon the potential of this system, this paper describes RF antennas and components fabricated through the integration of material extrusion 3 D printing with embedded wire, mesh, and RF elements...|$|E
40|$|This paper shows a {{conceptual}} {{model for the}} generation of performance measures in manufacturing fi rms. The conceptual model {{is based on a}} hierarchical approach for for-mulating manufacturing strategies in small and medium enterprises, which structures the process as a hierarchy and links the levels using tools of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The original model consists of 4 levels: (a) the well-being of the company, (b) strategic objectives, (c) strategic business units, (c) critical success factors and (<b>d)</b> <b>manufacturing</b> decision area. This model includes the four perspectives of the Balanced Scorecard, as follows. The fi nancial perspective is included in the strategic objectives, the customer perspective is included in the critical success factors and the process perspective and innovation & development perspective are included in the manufacturing decision areas. In this way, the same hierarchical model for formulating a manufacturing strategy {{can be used as a}} tool for generating performance measures. The main contribution of this work is that it provides with a systematic mechanism for generating performance measures. It also allows the assignation of weights to the measures created, using a well known and proved process as AHP...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{addresses}} The Fashion Paradox – {{the economic}} {{importance of the}} fashion industry set against its inherent obsolescence and waste through constant change. A new methodology is being developed for designers to approach these complex problems, and to evaluate the impact of design decisions {{through the development of}} personalized fashion products. A new ‘Considerate Design’ process model is being created through analysis of practical design processes by transferring tools and methods from engineering design within a framework of sustainability. This project responds to the rapidly changing context of fashion and positions the user at the centre of the design process. It will produce personalized fashion products using 3 D body scanning and rapid prototyping techniques integrated with different production processes: the direct 3 <b>D</b> <b>manufacturing</b> of seamfree knitwear; the making of bespoke handcrafted bags, and the direct digital creation of body conformable seamless textile structures. The sub projects each represent different levels of the industry, to test economic viability of products which are individually tailored to requirements, contributing to the development of mass customization. Considerate Design will reduce environmental impact of fashion products and consider both the end user and the entire product life cycle...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{identifies}} how {{the transition}} to a green economy presents trade opportunities for the manufacturing sector in developing countries. For developing countries, facilitating green manufacturing processes can stimulate innovation and enhance international competitiveness, translating into opportunities for increasing trade and global market share. Furthermore, manufacturing green products in specific sectors can enable developing countries to tap into growing international markets for sustainable products. This chapter first analyses cross-sectoral processes through which green trade opportunities can be realised, including:  Greening supply chains, including transport;  Embedding sustainability as a core business strategy, including by investing in renewable energy in industrial applications;  Utilising energy-efficient technologies throughout business processes;  Manufacturing environmental goods and providing environmental services;  Investing in renewable energy in industrial applications;  Promoting the complete disassembly, recovery and re-use of individual product components (remanufacturing); and  Considering emerging opportunities such as 3 <b>D</b> <b>manufacturing</b> and product-service systems. Second, the chapter focuses on certain specific manufacturing sectors where opportunities exist for generating gains from trade while reducing environmental impacts. These sectors include chemicals; Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) and electronics; and textiles, clothing and footwear...|$|E
