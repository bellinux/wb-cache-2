[...] "I always sang as a child. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> kids who just liked to sing. Some kids sing in choirs; others like to show {{off in front of}} the mirror. I was in the church choir and I also loved {{listening}} to singers on the radio–the BBC or Radio Luxembourg–or watching them on TV and in the movies." ...|$|E
500|$|Victoria {{was buried}} in the ducal family {{mausoleum}} at [...] in Coburg, until her remains [...] to the Grand Ducal Mausoleum of the Peter and Paul Fortress in Saint Petersburg on 7 March 1995. Her husband was intensely lonely after her death. The marriage of their daughter, Kira, to Louis Ferdinand, Prince of Prussia, in 1938 was a bright spot for Kirill, who saw it as the joining of two dynasties. However, Kirill died just two years after his wife. Kirill, though he had been unfaithful, still loved and missed the wife he had depended so much upon and passed his remaining years writing memoirs of their life together. [...] "There are few who in one person combine all that is best in soul, mind, and body," [...] he wrote. [...] "She had it all, and more. Few there are who are fortunate in having such a woman as the partner of their lives -- <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> privileged." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} for MTV News at Dylan's Candy Bar, Minaj revealed that she had kept the collaboration a secret from everyone she knew because she was [...] "so surprised" [...] at being asked to work with Carey and {{did not believe that}} the collaboration would actually come to fruition. [...] "That one, I didn’t believe until I was physically in the studio that I was doing with something with Mariah," [...] Minaj said. [...] "She’s an icon, I’ve loved her since I was little, like ’Vision of Love,’ ’Someday.’ <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> little girls in the mirror singing her songs with my mother.” A release date of February 23, 2010, for the album was slated, and then pushed back to March 9. It was then further pushed back to March 30. However, it was confirmed in March 2010 that production of Angels Advocate had halted and the project was shelved indefinitely. Island Def Jam stated that the singer was instead working on a new project and [...] "new surprises". Metro revealed that Carey was possibly recording a Christmas album.|$|E

500|$|Elias Kifle Maraim Beyene, a {{survivor}} from Ethiopia being {{asked about his}} memory of Michael Jackson after his death remembers: [...] "I won't ever forget Michael Jackson because his contribution to the song We are the World had a very significant effect on my life. I am 50 now but 25 years ago I was living in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, which {{at that time was}} suffering from a long drought and famine. It was a terrible situation. Lots of people became sick and many more died. Around one million people in all were killed by the famine. In 1984 Michael Jackson, along with a number of other leading musicians, made the song We are the World to raise money for Africa. We received a lot of aid from the world and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who directly benefitted from it. The wheat flour that was distributed to the famine victims was different to the usual cereal we bought at the market. We baked a special bread from it. The local people named the bread after the great artist and it became known as Michael Bread. It was soft and delicious.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Marc Cherry {{was in a}} {{precarious}} financial situation and was having trouble finding a job. He commented, [...] "I was broke, unable to get even an interview for a writing job, and seriously concerned about my future. I had just turned forty and was starting to wonder if <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> deluded writers that wander around Hollywood, convincing themselves they're talented when all the evidence points to the contrary." [...] While watching television coverage of the Andrea Yates trials with his mother, Cherry turned to her and asked, [...] "Can you imagine being so desperate that you would do that to your children?" [...] to which his mother replied, [...] "I've been there." [...] Cherry was intrigued {{by the idea that}} a [...] "perfectly sane, rational woman could have the life she wanted, being a wife and mother... and still have moments of insanity;" [...] he began writing the pilot episode soon after. Cherry originally developed the concept as a half-hour comedy. However, after his agent was arrested for embezzlement, Cherry signed with Paradigm Talent Agency, where he was advised to rewrite the script as a soap opera. Cherry completed the first draft of the pilot in April 2002 and pitched the script to CBS, NBC, Fox, HBO, Showtime, and Lifetime, all of which turned it down.|$|E
2500|$|King Hrothgar {{is portrayed}} by Anthony Hopkins. Hopkins noted in an {{interview}} that since Zemeckis is an American, he wasn't certain what accent Hopkins should use for the role of Hrothgar. Hopkins told him, [...] "Well, Welsh would be my closest because that's where I come from." [...] It was also his first time working with motion capture technology. Hopkins noted, [...] "I didn't know what was expected. It was explained to me, I'm not stupid, but I still don't get the idea of how it works. I have no idea [...] you don't have sets, so it is like being in a Brecht play, you know, with just bare bones and you have nothing else." [...] When asked if he had to read the original poem of Beowulf in school, Hopkins replied: [...] "No, I was hopeless at school. I couldn't read anything. I mean I could read, but I was so inattentive. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> poor kids, you know, who was just very slow, didn't know what they were talking about... So I tried to get around to reading Beowulf just before I did this movie, and it was a good modern translation. It was Trevor Griffiths, I’m not sure, but I couldn't hack it, and I tend to like to just go with the script if it's a good script." ...|$|E
