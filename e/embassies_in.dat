5|$|Cuba and Venezuela {{were the}} {{founding}} {{members of the}} Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas (ALBA). ALBA sought to redistribute wealth evenly throughout member countries, to protect the region's agriculture, and to oppose economic liberalization and privatization. ALBA's origins lay in a December 2004 agreement signed between the two countries, and was formalized through a People's Trade Agreement also signed by Evo Morales' Bolivia in April 2006. Castro had also been calling for greater Caribbean integration since the late 1990s, saying that only strengthened cooperation between Caribbean countries would prevent their domination by rich nations in a global economy. Cuba has opened four additional <b>embassies</b> <b>in</b> the Caribbean Community including: Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Suriname, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. This development makes Cuba the only country to have <b>embassies</b> <b>in</b> all independent countries of the Caribbean Community.|$|E

50|$|Indonesian <b>embassy</b> <b>in</b> Havana {{was officially}} opened on 14 August 1963. However, due to {{austerity}} reasons, Indonesia closed its Havana <b>embassy</b> <b>in</b> October 1971 and accredited its foreign affairs with Cuba to its <b>embassy</b> <b>in</b> Mexico City. In December 1995, Indonesian <b>embassy</b> <b>in</b> Havana was reopened.|$|R

These orders were picked up and received in Washington at 02:49, August 14.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from his}} writing, Notosusanto {{was active in}} student and {{political}} organisations, the student press, and academic conferences.

Together they had three children: Indrya Smita, Inggita Sukma, and Narottama.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the fall}} of Constantinople (1453), the newly {{expanded}} Ottoman Empire welcomed European <b>embassies</b> <b>in</b> its capital, which in turn became the sources of plants from those regions to the east which traded with the empire. In the following century twenty times as many plants entered Europe along the Silk Road as had been transported in the previous two thousand years, mainly as bulbs. Others were acquired primarily for their alleged medicinal value. Initially Italy benefited from this new knowledge, especially Venice, which traded extensively with the East. From there these new plants rapidly spread {{to the rest of}} Western Europe.|$|E
50|$|Bilateral {{relations}} between Chile and Indonesia {{were established in}} 1964.

5|$|In {{response}} to a 1996 State Department warning about bin Laden and the 1998 bombings of U.S. <b>embassies</b> <b>in</b> East Africa by al-Qaeda (which killed 224 people, including 12 Americans), Clinton ordered several military missions to capture or kill bin Laden, {{both of which were}} unsuccessful. In August 1998, Clinton ordered cruise missile strikes on terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Sudan, targeting the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory in Sudan, which was suspected of assisting bin Laden in making chemical weapons, and bin Laden's terrorist training camps in Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|Like any alliance, NATO is {{ultimately}} governed by its 29 member states. However, the North Atlantic Treaty and other agreements outline how decisions {{are to be}} made within NATO. Each of the 29 members sends a delegation or mission to NATO's headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. The senior permanent member of each delegation {{is known as the}} Permanent Representative and is generally a senior civil servant or an experienced ambassador (and holding that diplomatic rank). Several countries have diplomatic missions to NATO through <b>embassies</b> <b>in</b> Belgium.|$|E
5|$|Operation Infinite Reach was the codename for American {{cruise missile}} strikes on al-Qaeda bases in Khost, Afghanistan, and the Al-Shifa {{pharmaceutical}} factory in Khartoum, Sudan, on August 20, 1998. The attacks, {{launched by the}} U.S. Navy, were ordered by President Bill Clinton in retaliation for al-Qaeda's August 7 bombings of American <b>embassies</b> <b>in</b> Kenya and Tanzania, which killed 224 people (including 12 Americans) and injured over 4,000 others. Operation Infinite Reach {{was the first time}} the United States acknowledged a preemptive strike against a violent non-state actor.|$|E

5|$|In May 2015, in {{recognition}} of the sociopolitical progress made in Somalia and its return to effective governance, US Secretary of State John Kerry announced a preliminary plan to reestablish the US embassy in Mogadishu. He indicated that although there was no set timetable for the premises' relaunch, the US government had immediately begun upgrading its diplomatic representation in the country. President of Somalia Hassan Sheikh Mohamud and Prime Minister Omar Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke also presented to Kerry the real estate deed for land reserved for the new US embassy compound. Mohamud concurrently signed an Establishment Agreement with the EU Head of Delegation in Somalia Michele Cervone d’Urso, which facilitates the opening of more <b>embassies</b> <b>in</b> Mogadishu by European Union member states. The EU also announced that it had opened a new EU Delegation office in the city.|$|E
5|$|Madagascar has {{historically}} been perceived as being on the margin of mainstream African affairs despite being {{a founding member of}} the Organisation of African Unity, which was established in 1963 and dissolved in 2002 to be replaced by the African Union. Madagascar was not permitted to attend the first African Union summit because of a dispute over the results of the 2001 presidential election, but rejoined the African Union in July 2003 after a 14-month hiatus. Madagascar was again suspended by the African Union in March 2009 following the unconstitutional transfer of executive power to Rajoelina. Madagascar is a member of the International Criminal Court with a Bilateral Immunity Agreement of protection for the United States military. Eleven countries have established <b>embassies</b> <b>in</b> Madagascar, including France, the United Kingdom, the United States, China and India.|$|E
5|$|Mugabe {{focused on}} the {{propaganda}} war, making regular speeches and radio broadcasts. In these, he presented himself as a Marxist-Leninist, speaking warmly of Marxist-Leninist revolutionaries like Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin, and Fidel Castro. Despite his Marxist views, Mugabe's meetings with Soviet representatives were unproductive, for they insisted on Nkomo's leadership of the revolutionary struggle. His relationship with the People's Republic of China was far warmer, as the Chinese Marxist government supplied ZANLA with armaments without any conditions. He also sought support from Western nations, visiting Western <b>embassies</b> <b>in</b> Mozambique, and travelled to both Western states like Italy and Switzerland and Marxist-governed states like the Soviet Union, China, North Korea, Vietnam, and Cuba.|$|E

Almost all countries have <b>embassies</b> <b>in</b> Washington, D.C., and many have consulates around the country. Likewise, nearly all nations host American diplomatic missions. However, Iran, North Korea, Bhutan, and the Republic of China (Taiwan) do not have formal diplomatic relations with the United States (although the U.S. still maintains relations with Taiwan and supplies it with military equipment).|$|E
5|$|In 1990, {{seasoned}} diplomat James K. Bishop {{was appointed}} US Ambassador to Somalia. In 1967, Bishop {{was at the}} US Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon when the Six-Day War erupted, which prompted the evacuation of about 3,600 Americans in 33 hours; Bishop was one of 26 diplomats and Marines that remained in the city during the conflict. Ambassador Bishop also gained valuable experience organizing evacuations of several <b>embassies</b> <b>in</b> the 1980s while serving as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Africa. In his previous post, as US ambassador to Liberia, Bishop was overseeing the voluntary evacuation of embassy staff and civilians as a civil war in Liberia spread, when he left in March 1990. Ambassador Bishop returned to Washington to prepare for his new appointment to Somalia, but he was soon appointed to a taskforce {{to deal with the}} crisis in Liberia, which included a gradual evacuation of American civilians and a rapid closure of the embassy in August.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the raid on Sind and following the 1809 monsoon season, the British authorities in India decided to make a significant show of force against the Al Qasimi, in an effort not only to destroy their larger bases and as many ships as could be found, but also to counteract French encouragement of them from their <b>embassies</b> <b>in</b> Persia and Oman. Forces were gathered at Bombay during the summer: the small HEIC warships, Mornington, Aurora, Ternate, Mercury, Nautilus, Prince of Wales, Ariel and Fury joined by the bomb ketch Stromboli and the Royal Navy frigates HMS Caroline under Charles Gordon and Chiffone under John Wainwright, who was placed in command of the entire expeditionary force with the temporary rank of commodore. The force was complemented with troops seconded from the Bombay garrison, including a battalion of the 65th Foot, soldiers from the 47th Foot and an assortment of HEIC marines, engineers, artillery men and sepoys from the 2nd Bombay Native Infantry under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Lionel Smith of the 65th.|$|E

5|$|Beginning {{in the age}} of Augustus (r. 27 BC – 14 AD), {{the ancient}} Romans, {{including}} authors such as Pliny the Elder, mentioned contacts with the Seres, who they identified as the producers of silk from distant East Asia and could have been the Chinese or even any number of middlemen of various ethnic backgrounds along the Silk Road of Central Asia and Northwest China. The Eastern-Han era Chinese general Ban Chao, Protector General of the Western Regions, explored Central Asia and in 97 AD dispatched his envoys Gan Ying to Daqin (i.e. the Roman Empire). Gan was dissuaded by Parthian authorities to venture further than the Persian Gulf, although he wrote a detailed report about the Roman Empire, its cities, postal network, and consular system of government, and presented this to the Han court. Subsequently, there were a series of Roman <b>embassies</b> <b>in</b> China lasting from the 2nd to 3rd centuries AD, as recorded in Chinese sources. In 166 AD the Book of Later Han records that Romans reached China from the maritime south and presented gifts to the court of Emperor Huan of Han (r. 146–168 AD), claiming they represented Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus (Andun 安敦) (r. 161–180 AD). Historian Rafe de Crespigny speculates that they were Roman merchants instead of official diplomats.|$|E
5|$|Relations {{between the}} Liao and the Song were {{initially}} peaceful, {{with the two}} dynasties exchanging <b>embassies</b> <b>in</b> 974. Following {{the collapse of the}} Tang dynasty, several territories formed small, independent states that were never reunified during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. Additionally, several additional territories that were controlled by military governors during the Tang dynasty had fallen under the control of local warlords following the Tang collapse. Rather than focus on reclaiming land from the Liao dynasty, Zhao Kuangyin, who would take the title Emperor Taizu of Song, focused on reclaiming these smaller break-off territories. He would die in 976 having reestablished control over all but one of these territories, the Northern Han kingdom. Despite the Northern Han's status as a protectorate of the Liao dynasty, Emperor Taizu of Song launched an invasion of the kingdom in 976, only months before his death. The Northern Han received assistance from the Liao, and the invasion was repelled. Emperor Taizong of Song, brother of the founding emperor and the second emperor of the Song dynasty, launched a second invasion in 979. The Northern Han again received Liao assistance, but this invasion was successful; the Northern Han crumbled, and the Song were able to assume control of the territory. Emperor Taizong of Song immediately followed this victory with an attempted invasion of the sixteen prefectures, but the unrested and undersupplied Song troops were thoroughly routed by the Liao in the Battle of Gaoliang River.|$|E
