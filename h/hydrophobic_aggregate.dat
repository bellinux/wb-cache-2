40|$|A {{systematic}} {{analysis of the}} hypothesis of the antimicrobial peptides' (AMPs) cooperative action is performed by means of full atomistic molecular dynamics simulations accompanied by circular dichroism experiments. Several AMPs from the aurein family (2. 5, 2. 6, 3. 1), have a similar sequence in the first ten amino acids, are investigated in different environments including aqueous solution, trifluoroethanol (TFE), palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (POPE), and palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylglycerol (POPG) lipid bilayers. It is found that the cooperative effect is stronger in aqueous solution and weaker in TFE. Moreover, {{in the presence of}} membranes, the cooperative effect {{plays an important role in}} the peptide/lipid bilayer interaction. The action of AMPs is a competition of the hydrophobic interactions between the side chains of the peptides and the hydrophobic region of lipid molecules, as well as the intra peptide interaction. The aureins 2. 5 -COOH and 2. 6 -COOH form a <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>aggregate</b> to minimize the interaction between the hydrophobic group and the water. Once that the peptides reach the water/lipid interface the <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>aggregate</b> becomes smaller and the peptides start to penetrate into the membrane. In contrast, aurein 3. 1 -COOH forms only a transient aggregate which disintegrates once the peptides reached the membrane, and it shows no cooperativity in membrane penetratio...|$|E
40|$|The {{principal}} {{objective of this}} project is to {{develop an understanding of}} the molecular self-organisation process in elastic protein resilin in aqueous dispersion. This research will promote fundamental knowledge relating to resilin protein’s structure & special organization, which is responsible for the formation of unique and highly responsive functional elastomeric gels from such protein. The sensitivity of the organisation process on variables such as temperature, concentration and pH will be quantified. PROGRESS REPORT and RESEARCH OUTCOMES Research outcomes The biomimetic synthetic resilin developed was confirmed to have elasticity and resilience (~ 94 %) comparable to the natural resilin and also observed to be less sensitive to temperature [1 - 3]. However, resilin is highly resilent only in hydrated state and structural organization of synthetic resilin in presence of water and other polar solvent is extremely important. Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) and TEM was used to investigate the effect of water in the molecular organization of resilin. This will also provide information about the <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>aggregate</b> size and shape. To support {{the size and shape of}} the resilin, TEM and Micro-TA instruments was used.

40|$|Mulches augment soil {{moisture}} availability to plants by restraining direct evaporation of soil water. Yet, in field conditions wind decreases their {{resistance to water}} vapor transport, diminishing their efficiency as a water conservation measure. The relation between vapor transport resistance and wind speed was investigated in a wind tunnel where air flow was turbulent. The mulch material was chopped straw with bulk densities of 31 and 37 Â kgÂ m- 3, and chemically stabilized aggregates segregated in diameter classes 1 - 2, 2 - 4, 4 - 8, 8 - 11. 2 Â mm, in layers 10 - 100 Â mm thick. The resistance decreased exponentially with increasing wind speed from the molecular diffusion value at zero wind speed, suggesting that turbulence penetrates the pores of the mulch and drives convective water vapor transport. Resistance rose exponentially with increasing layer thickness, a mirror reflection of the turbulence decay profile. Higher bulk density of the straw and finer aggregates augmented the resistance. The convective component of the vapor transport resistance was related to mulch area index, defined as the surface area of the solid elements of mulch per unit covered ground area. This procedure merged the effect of layer thickness and that of straw bulk density or aggregates size into a single function, indicating that friction forces proportional to internal area of the solid fabric restrain the penetration of momentum in the porous medium. Two-layered mulches combining straw and aggregates have a higher resistance {{than the sum of}} the resistances of the individual components as is expected from the attenuation of convection in the top layer. The functions derived in this study can serve as input for models evaluating the impact of mulches on soil water balance.

40|$|Protein {{refolding}} from {{inclusion bodies}} (IBs) often encounters {{a problem of}} low recovery at high protein concentration. In this study, we demonstrated that high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) could simultaneously achieve high refolding concentration and high refolding yield for IBs of recombinant human ciliary neurotrophic factor (rhCNTF), a potential therapeutic for neurodegenerative diseases. The use of dilution refolding obtained 18 % recovery at 3 mg/mL, even {{in the presence of}} 4 M urea. In contrast, HHP refolding could efficiently increase the recovery up to almost 100 % even at 4 mg/mL. It was found that in the dilution, <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>aggregates</b> were the off-path products and their amount increased with the protein concentration. However, HHP could effectively minimize the formation of <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>aggregates,</b> leading to almost complete conversion of the rhCNTF IBs to the correct configuration. The stable operation range of concentration is 0. 5 - 4. 0 mg/mL, in which the refolding yield was almost 100 %. Compared with the literatures where HHP failed to increase the refolding yield beyond 90 %, the reason could be attributed to the structural difference that rhCNTF has no disulfide bond and is a monomeric protein. After purification by one-step of anionic chromatography, the purity of rhCNTF reached 95 % with total process recovery of 54. 1 %. The purified rhCNTF showed similar structure and in vitro bioactivity to the native species. The whole process featured integration of solubilization/refolding, a high refolding yield of 100 %, a high concentration of 4 mg/mL, and a simple chromatography to ensure a high productivity.

The interactions are electrostatic and hydrophobic. Thus, they are manifested {{in the formation of}} <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>aggregates.</b> The critical aggregation concentration (CAC) is much lower than the critical micellar concentration (CMC) of the surfactant alone.

Because {{it can be}} used in situ and applied to a wide particle size range, turbidimetry is acknowledged {{as one of the best}} methods for this characterization. Although much work has been done on aggregation, some aspects are less known and require additional experimental and theoretical research. This is particularly the case of aggregation of <b>hydrophobic</b> particles. Corresponding <b>aggregates</b> are three-phase objects (solid-liquid-gas) the morphology and optical properties of which are not known. The present work rests on the turbidimetric study of hydrophilic and hydrophobic silica samples in stirred aqueous solutions. Modeling involves different aspects: aggregate morphology, aggregate optical properties, and aggregation dynamics. This article particularly emphasizes the second aspect. Fractal-like models are proved to be representative of the aggregate morphology even at small size. Light-scattering cross section of the aggregates is calculated from their averaged projected area; effective refractive index is proved to be a good parameter for modeling the optical properties of both hydrophilic and <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>aggregates.</b> Classical models of porous aggregate formation (Kusters theory) are used for describing the aggregation dynamics...|$|R
40|$|Cellular Toxicity of C 60 Fullerenes in RAW 264. 7 Immortalized Macrophages 	C 60 fullerenes are {{nanoparticles}} (~ 1 nm dia.) {{composed of}} 60 carbons in a spherical graphene structure. They are <b>hydrophobic,</b> <b>aggregate</b> {{in aqueous solution}} and {{have been associated with}} cellular toxicity in multiple cell types. The central hypothesis of this thesis is that exposure of peripheral immune cells to C 60 fullerenes will result in their uptake into the cytosol, membrane-bound intracellular compartments and cell membrane(s) resulting in cellular stress and subsequent activation of apoptosis. 	Electron-dense terbium endohedral fullerenes were an excellent model for visualizing C 60 in cells. Transmission electron microscopy on RAW 264. 7 immortalized murine macrophages showed that C 60 was found in endosomes, embedded within lipid membranes and free in the cytosol and nucleoplasm. Endocytosis was found to be mediated by both caveolin and clathrin. 	Cell death assays determined that at 24 hours there was no statistically significant occurrence of early or late apoptosis or necrosis. Cells exhibited subtle alterations in cytokine and chemokine gene expression profiles. Examination of the glutathione synthesis pathway showed changes consistent with a mild form of oxidative stress. Cellular proliferation decreased upon exposure to 1 and 4 μg/mL fullerenes and metabolic studies showed alterations in nucleotide catabolism and lipid metabolism. 	These studies show that exposure of immune cells to C 60 fullerenes results in uptake of the nanoparticles and alterations in the normal functions of the cell. The changes in the synthesis of glutathione, nucleotide catabolism, and lipid synthesis do not result in increased cell death at 24 hours; however, alterations to cellular proliferation and mildly altered inflammatory signals suggest that the cell {{is in the process of}} trying to resolve damage inflicted by fullerenes. Moreover, at 24 hours, the cells do not show clear signs of mechanisms leading to survival, proliferation or death...|$|E
40|$|Two {{families}} of amphiphilic polymers were characterized {{with respect to}} their ability to respond to changing solution conditions using steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence. Firstly, a series of 5 sequential amphiphilic polypeptides consisting of hydrophilic and ionizable aspartic acid (Asp) and hydrophobic phenylalanine (Phe) in varying sequence (AspxPhey) n were studied. The effect of pH on the collapse and aggregation behaviour of the samples was investigated using light scattering which determined that the samples became insoluble when the fraction of ionized amino acids decreased below 0. 2. Pyrene fluorescence measurments demonstrated that <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>aggregate</b> formation was the cause of this behaviour. The fluorescence and light scattering experiments yielded a detailed description of how pH affects the collapse and aggregation behaviour of amphiphilic polypeptides. 	Secondly, a series of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) chains in aqueous solution, varying in length and end-labelled with pyrene (Py 2 -PNIPAM), were studied {{with respect to their}} temperature dependent solubility using turbidimetry, light scattering, and fluorescence. The cloud point temperature (Tc) of the Py 2 -PNIPAM samples was found to increase with increasing chain length. Steady-state fluorescence spectra yielded the ratio of excimer intensity to that of monomer intensity, or (IE/IM) SS, which reached a maximum at Tc. Time-resolved fluorescence decays were analyzed using Model-Free Analysis (MFA). The MFA yielded the average rate constant of excimer formation, and the parameters fagg, fdiff and ffree, which reflect the molar fractions of pyrenes that form excimer from pre-formed aggregates, form excimer by diffusion, and do not form excimer, respectively. Increasing the temperature above Tc caused a strong decrease in and ffree, and a sharp rise in fdiff, which is consistent with the formation of mesoglobules. Increasing the temperature above the dehydration temperature of unlabelled PNIPAM (Tm = 34 oC) caused the distribution of pyrene to stabilize. 	The third study focused on aqueous mixtures of Py 2 -PNIPAM and unlabelled PNIPAM, and their ability to mix when the temperature was raised above Tm. Using turbidimetry, separate transitions for Py 2 -PNIPAM and unlabelled PNIPAM were identified. Steady-state fluorescence of the labelled chains demonstrated separate (IE/IM) SS transitions for the labelled and unlabelled chains as well. The MFA of the time-resolved fluorescence decays yielded no transition in at Tm, while fagg, fdiff and ffree showed transitions consistent with unlabelled PNIPAM entering the Py 2 -PNIPAM mesoglobules. This led {{to the conclusion that the}} two polymers are able to mix at and above Tm, and that the mesoglobules are not frozen and vitreous. 	Fourthly, a variety of pyrene-labelled polymers in organic solution were studied using steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence, where the results of Birks’ Scheme and the Fluorescence Blob Model (FBM) were compared to the results of the MFA. The MFA was found to be able to faithfully reproduce the results of the other, more established, models. In addition, the MFA allowed the calculation of (IE/IM) SPC, the ratio of excimer to monomer intensity as determined by time-resolved fluorescence, which scaled linearly with both (IE/IM) SS and. From this it was concluded that the MFA is able to fit the decays of pyrene-labelled polymers with any architecture studied thus far, but also provides an absolute measure of IE/IM which can be reproduced in any lab...|$|E
40|$|Proteins can be {{denatured}} by {{pressures of}} a few hundred MPa. This finding apparently contradicts the most widely used model of protein stability, where the formation of a hydrophobic core drives protein folding. The pressure denaturation puzzle is resolved by focusing on the pressure-dependent transfer of water into the protein interior, in contrast to the transfer of nonpolar residues into water, the approach commonly taken in models of protein unfolding. Pressure denaturation of proteins can then be explained by the pressure destabilization of <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>aggregates</b> by using an information theory model of hydrophobic interactions. Pressure-denatured proteins, unlike heat-denatured proteins, retain a compact structure with water molecules penetrating their core. Activation volumes for hydrophobic contributions to protein folding and unfolding kinetics are positive. Clathrate hydrates are predicted to form by virtually the same mechanism that drives pressure denaturation of proteins...|$|R
40|$|Prions are {{mammalian}} proteins (PrPs) with {{a unique}} pathogenic property: a nonendogenous isoform PrPSc can catalyze conversion of the endogenous PrPC isoform into additional PrPSc. In this work, we demonstrate that PrPC helix 1 has certain properties (hydrophilicity, charge distribution) that make it unique among all naturally occurring α-helices, and which are indicative of a highly specific model of prion infectivity. The β-nucleation model proposes that PrPSc is an aggregate with a hydrophilic core, consisting of a β-sheet-like arrangement of constituent helix 1 components. It is suggested by using structural arguments, and confirmed by using charmm energy calculations, that aggregate formation from two PrPC molecules is highly unfavorable, but the addition of chains to an existing aggregate is favorable. The β-nucleation model is shown {{to be consistent with}} the prion species-barrier, as well as with infectivity data. Sequence analysis of all known protein structures indicates that PrP is uniquely suited to β-nucleation, in contrast to the many proteins that readily form less favorable (often nonspecific) <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>aggregates...</b>|$|R

A low-frequency adhesion fatigue test was proposed in this paper to study the effect of environment on the asphalt-aggregate adhesion system. The stress-based fatigue model had been utilized to describe the fatigue behavior of thin-film asphalt and aggregate system. The factors influencing the adhesion fatigue performance were also investigated. Experiment results show that asphalt has more important effect on the adhesion performance comparing with aggregate. Basalt, which is regarded as <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>aggregates</b> with low silica content, has better adhesion performance to asphalt binder when compared with granite. The effects of aging on the adhesion fatigue performance are different for PG 64 - 22 and rubber asphalt. Long-term aging is found to reduce the adhesion fatigue lives for rubber asphalt and aggregate system, while the effect of long-term aging for aggregate and PG 64 - 22 binder system is positive. Generally the increased stress amplitude and test temperature could induce greater damage and lead to less fatigue lives for adhesion test system...|$|R

Degradation products identified by [1 H- 31 P] heteroTOCSY revealed that phosphoesters are cleaved between sugar and phosphate, while phosphoramidates are also cleaved at the lipid-phosphate bond. For the latter compounds, the ratio between both degradation pathways is influenced by the nucleobase moiety. However no oligomerization of nucleotides was observed; nor the formation of 3 ′- 5 ′-cyclic nucleotides, possible intermediates for oligonucleotide synthesis.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A bifunctional {{fusion protein}} {{consisting}} of or-ganophosphorus hydrolase (OPH) and elastin-like poly-peptide (ELP) was synthesized for the detoxification of organophosphorus compounds. ELPs undergo a revers-ible phase transition upon {{an increase in}} temperature, forming <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>aggregates.</b> This thermally trig-gered property of phase transition allows for a simple and rapid means of purifying the fusion protein. Over 1, 300 -fold purification was achieved after only 2 cycles of inverse phase transition. The purified fusion protein showed identical kinetic properties as the native OPH with only a modest 10 % increase in Km and a 5 % de-crease of Kcat. The ability of the ELP domain to form collapsed aggregates also improved long-term stability of the fusion enzyme. Aggregated ELP–OPH retained nearly 100 % activity over a span of three weeks. In addi-tion to facilitating purification and stability, the ELP moi-ety served as a hydrophobic tag for one-step immobili-zation of the fusion protein onto hydrophobic surfaces. The ELP–OPH was capable of rapidly degrading paraox-on while immobilized. The protein also retained ELP functionality of reversible phase transition thereby allow-ing for the regeneration of the treated surface.

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the role of}} two Escherichia coli heat shock proteins, the dnaK and dnaJ gene products, during the initiation of lambda dv DNA replication in vitro. Using 14 C-labeled lambda P protein we showed that the DnaK and DnaJ heat shock proteins function together to release lambda P protein from the preprimosomal complex consisting of lambda origin of replication-lambda O-lambda P-DnaB protein. Hydrolysis of ATP, catalyzed presumably by DnaK, is required during this reaction. Substitution of DnaK protein {{with that of the}} mutant DnaK 756 protein blocks lambda P release. After DnaK and DnaJ action, the preprimosomal complex, isolated on Sepharose 4 B, can support lambda dv DNA replication without any additional prepriming proteins. Using DnaK-affinity chromatography we showed that both lambda O and lambda P proteins bind to DnaK protein. The lambda P protein interacts with DnaK protein in a salt-resistant, hydrophobic manner, and ATP hydrolysis is necessary to elute at least part of lambda P protein from the DnaK-affinity column. The proposed mechanism of action of the prokaryotic DnaK and DnaJ heat shock proteins agrees with the hypothesis that Hsp 70, the DnaK analogue of eukaryotes, uses ATP to disrupt <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>aggregates</b> [Pelham, H.

40|$|The intracelluIar {{parasite}} Toxoplasma gondii resides {{within a}} specialized compartment, the parasitophorous vacuole (PV), that resists fusion with host cell endocytic and lysosomal compartments. The PV is extensively modified by secretion of parasite proteins, including the dense granule protein GRA 5 that is specifically targeted to the delimiting membrane of the PV (PVM). We show here that GRA 5 is present both in a soluble form and in <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>aggregates.</b> GRA 5 is secreted as a soluble form into the PV after which it becomes stably {{associated with the}} PVM. Topological studies demonstrated that GRA 5 was inserted into the PVM as a transmembrane protein with its N-terminal domain extending into the cytoplasm and its C terminus in the vacuole lumen. Deletion of 8 of the 18 hydrophobic amino acids of the single predicted transmembrane domain resulted in the failure of GRA 5 to associate with the PVM; yet it remained correctly packaged in the dense granules and was secreted as a soluble protein into the PV. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that the secretory pathway in Toxoplasma is unusual in two regards; it allows soluble export of proteins containing typical transmembrane domains and provides a mechanism for their insertion into a host cell membrane after secretion from the parasite.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{approach is developed}} to quantify hydrophobic hydration and interactions on a molecular scale, {{with the goal of}} gaining insight into the molecular origins of hydrophobic effects. The model is based on the fundamental relation between the probability for cavity formation in bulk water resulting from molecular-scale density fluctuations, and the hydration free energy of the simplest hydrophobic solute, a hard particle. This probability is estimated using an information theory (IT) approach, incorporating experimentally available properties of bulk water [...] the density and radial distribution function. The IT approach reproduces the simplest hydrophobic effects: hydration of spherical nonpolar solutes, the potential of mean force between methane molecules, and solvent contributions to the torsional equilibrium of butane. Applications of this approach to study temperature and pressure effects provide new insights into the thermodynamics and kinetics of protein folding. The IT model relates the hydrophobic-entropy convergence observed in protein unfolding experiments to the macroscopic isothermal compressibility of water. A novel explanation for pressure denaturation of proteins follows from an analysis of the pressure stability of <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>aggregates,</b> suggesting that water penetrates the hydrophobic core of proteins at high pressures. This resolves a long-standing puzzle, whether pressure denaturation contradicts the hydrophobic-core model of protein stability. Finally, issues of ``dewetting'' of molecularly large nonpolar solutes are discussed {{in the context of a}} recently developed perturbation theory approach.

Hemolysis was observed only when cells were incubated first with calcium followed by bilirubin and not vice versa. This hemolysis {{was found to}} be dependent upon several factors such as concentration of bilirubin, time of incubation of erythrocytes with calcium and time of incubation of bilirubin with the calcium-loaded erythrocytes. Inclusion of EDTA in the incubation medium reduced the percentage hemolysis to a significant extent. Involvement of activated oxygen species in hemolytic process seems to be unlikely as inclusion of sodium azide and catalase did not prevent hemolysis. A comparison of other bivalent cations such as Ba 2 +, Mg 2 +, Mn 2 + and Cu 2 + with Ca 2 + for their ability to hemolyse cells in presence of bilirubin shows that Ba 2 + and Mg 2 + are ineffective, whereas both Mn 2 + and Cu 2 + induce hemolysis both in the absence {{as well as in the}} presence of bilirubin. However, their mechanism of hemolysis is different from that of calcium-induced hemolysis.

40|$|The {{comparative}} study of the chemical denaturation by Chaotropic reagents urea and guanidine hydrochloride was studied on the model protein Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) using UV-Vis Spectrophotometry and Steady State Fluorescence Spectroscopy. The denaturation or unfolding is a complex process for water soluble globular protein BSA as it contains multi – domains in which each domain can unfold dependently or independently and the association of different domains in the whole protein through various short range and long range interactions may affect the overall process. In the present experimental study the intrinsic fluorescence of amino acid (phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan) was explored {{to account for the}} denaturation process. The Chaotropic reagents of interest i. e. urea and guanidine hydrochloride being less polar than water, act upon by leading to an energetically unfavourable disruption of water structure. The addition of these denaturing agents to aqueous solutions therefore results in an increase in solvent-accessible surface area which destabilises <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>aggregates,</b> micelles and native protein structures ultimately leading to the process of unfolding or denaturation. Absorption studies were not effective in providing much information regarding the denaturation or unfolding of BSA. But the fluorescence emission spectra obtained describes successfully accounting for the changes during the unfolding and reasons behind it. The fluorescence intensity and anisotropy values well complemented each other for assigning the microenvironment of tryptophan to account for the changes during the unfolding of BSA.

40|$|As protein {{aggregation}} {{is potentially}} lethal, control of protein conformation by molecular chaperones {{is essential for}} cellular organisms. This is especially important during protein expression and translocation, since proteins are then unfolded and therefore most susceptible to form non-native interactions. Using TANGO, a statistical mechanics algorithm to predict protein aggregation, we here analyse the aggregation propensities of 28 complete proteomes. Our results show that between 10 % and 20 % of the residues in these proteomes are within aggregating protein segments and that this represents a lower limit for the aggregation tendency of globular proteins. Further, we show, that not only evolution strongly pressurizes aggregation downwards by minimizing the amount of strongly aggregating sequences but also by selectively capping strongly <b>aggregating</b> <b>hydrophobic</b> protein sequences with arginine, lysine and proline. These residues are strongly favoured at these positions as they function as gatekeepers that are most efficient at opposing aggregation. Finally, we demonstrate that the substrate specificity of different unrelated chaperone families is geared by these gatekeepers. Chaperones face the difficulty of having to combine substrate affinity for {{a broad range of}} hydrophobic sequences and selectivity for those <b>hydrophobic</b> sequences that <b>aggregate</b> most strongly. We show that chaperones achieve these requirements by preferentially binding hydrophobic sequences that are capped by positively charged gatekeeper residues. In other words, targeting evolutionarily selected gatekeepers allows chaperones to prioritize substrate recognition according to aggregation propensity. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

30|$|Recently, {{polymeric}} micelles as a {{means to}} solubilize poorly water-soluble drugs have attracted much attention [4 – 6]. Generally, block copolymers with concentration above the critical association concentration (CAC) self-assemble into spherical polymeric micelles with a core–shell structure in water: the <b>hydrophobic</b> segments <b>aggregate</b> to form an inner core being able to accommodate hydrophobic drugs with improved solubility by hydrophobic interactions; the hydrophilic shell consists of a brush-like protective corona that stabilizes the micelles in aqueous solution [7 – 9]. Polymeric micelles as novel drug vehicles present numerous advantages, such as reduced side effects of anticancer drugs, selective targeting, stable storage and prolonged blood circulation time [9, 10]. Furthermore, polymeric micelles possess a nanoscale size range with a narrow distribution, and they can achieve higher accumulation at the target site through an enhanced permeation retention effect (EPR effect) [11]. They can protect drugs against premature degradation in vivo owing to their core–shell architecture [12, 13]. More importantly, polymeric micelles are fabricated according to the physicochemical properties of drugs and the compatibility between the core of micelles and drug molecules [9, 14].|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Hydrogels {{have been}} {{developed}} as extracellular matrix (ECM) mimics both for therapeutic applications and basic biological studies. In particular, elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) hydrogels, which can be tuned to mimic several biochemical and physical characteristics of native ECM, have been constructed to encapsulate various types of cells to create in vitro mimics of in vivo tissues. However, ELP hydrogels become opaque at body temperature because of ELP’s lower critical solution temperature behavior. This opacity obstructs light-based observation of the morphology and behavior of encapsulated cells. In order to improve the transparency of ELP hydrogels for better imaging, we have designed a hybrid ELP-polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogel system that rapidly cross-links with tris(hydroxymethyl) phosphine (THP) in aqueous solution via Mannich-type condensation. As expected, addition of the hydrophilic PEG component significantly improves the light transmittance. Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy reveals that the hybrid ELP-PEG hydrogels have smaller <b>hydrophobic</b> ELP <b>aggregates</b> at 37 °C. Importantly, this hydrogel platform enables independent tuning of adhesion ligand density and matrix stiffness, which is desirable for studies of cell−matrix interactions. Huma...|$|R
40|$|Essentially all {{biochemistry}} {{and most}} molecular biology experiments require recombinant proteins. However, large, <b>hydrophobic</b> proteins typically <b>aggregate</b> into insoluble and misfolded species, and are directed into inclusion bodies. Current techniques to fold proteins recovered from inclusion bodies rely on denaturation followed by dialysis or rapid dilution. Such approaches can be time consuming, wasteful, and inefficient. Here, we describe rapid protein folding using a vortex fluidic device (VFD). This process uses mechanical energy introduced into thin films to rapidly and efficiently fold proteins. With the VFD in continuous flow mode, {{large volumes of}} protein solution can be processed per day with 100 -fold reductions in both folding times and buffer volumes...|$|R

The micellar population in a detergent/water mixture cannot increase without limit as the detergent to water ratio increases. In the presence of low amounts of water, lipids that would normally form micelles will form larger aggregates {{in the form of}} micellar tubules in order to satisfy the requirements of the <b>hydrophobic</b> effect. These <b>aggregates</b> {{can be thought of as}} micelles that are fused together. These tubes have the polar head groups facing out, and the hydrophobic hydrocarbon chains facing the interior.

40|$|Peptide {{nucleic acid}} (PNA) is a DNA mimic {{in which the}} {{nucleobases}} are linked by an N-(2 -aminoethyl) glycine backbone. Here we report that PNA can interact with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) in a non-sequence-specific fashion. We observed that a 15 mer PNA inhibited the ssDNA-stimulated ATPase activity of a bacteriophage T 4 helicase, Dda. Surprisingly, when a fluorescein-labeled 15 mer PNA was used in binding studies no interaction was observed between PNA and Dda. However, fluorescence polarization did reveal non-sequence-specific interactions between PNA and ssDNA. Thus, the inhibition of ATPase activity of Dda appears to result from depletion of the available ssDNA due to non-Watson–Crick binding of PNA to ssDNA. Inhibition of the ssDNA-stimulated ATPase activity was observed for several PNAs of varying length and sequence. To study the basis for this phenomenon, we examined self-aggregation by PNAs. The 15 mer PNA readily self-aggregates {{to the point of}} precipitation. Since PNAs are <b>hydrophobic,</b> they <b>aggregate</b> more than DNA or RNA, making the study of this phenomenon essential for understanding the properties of PNA. Non-sequence-specific interactions between PNA and ssDNA were observed at moderate concentrations of PNA, suggesting that such interactions should be considered for antisense and antigene applications...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the mechanism of}} inclusion body formation {{and the effect of}} a hydrophobic sequence on the in vivo polypeptide folding, the aggregation caused by recombinant fusion β-galactosidase in Escherichia coli was examined. Two plasmids were constructed: pTBG(H -) carried only the preS 2 sequence of the hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) in front of the β-galactosidase gene (lacZ) while pTBG(H+) carried an additional sequence encoding the amino-terminal hydrophobic sequence of the S region of HBsAg between preS 2 and lacZ. Unlike cells expressing the fusion protein not containing the hydrophobic sequence, E. coli JM 109 /pTBG(H+) exhibited temperature-sensitive production of β-galactosidase. As the culture temperature increased the activity decreased dramatically. This decrease in activity was not due to a decrease in fusion polypeptide production, but rather the fusion polypeptides containing the <b>hydrophobic</b> sequence <b>aggregated</b> within the cells at high temperature. However once the fusion polypeptides folded into proper conformation at low temperature, they maintained the activity even at high temperature. The results indicate that aggregation is a consequence of incorrect folding and assembly of the polypeptides, and is not derived from the native structure. The aggregates of the pTBG(H+) -encoded fusion polypeptides did not revert to active form when the culture temperature was lowered. ope...|$|R
40|$|Starch {{nanoparticles}} (SNPs) were hydrophobically modified with propionic (C 3) and hexanoic (C 6) anhydride via esterification. Different {{degrees of}} substitution (DS) of the hydroxyl {{groups of the}} SNPs were achieved by varying the reaction conditions. The relative hydrophobicity of the hydrophobically modified SNPs (HM-SNPs) was examined with pyrene fluorescence. The hydrophobes covalently attached to the SNPs conferred an amphiphilic character to the SNPs whereby hydrophobic microdomains were generated and stabilized by the hydrophilic SNPs in aqueous solution. The hydrophobic microdomains of the HM-SNPs were probed with the hydrophobic dye, pyrene. Several parameters related to the photophysical properties of pyrene, such as the (I 1 /I 3) o ratio, the bimolecular rate constant for quenching k¬q, the natural lifetime o, and the equilibrium constant for the binding of pyrene to the HM-SNPs KB, were found {{to respond to the}} expected hydrophobicity of the HM-SNPs, and thus the level of hydrophobic modification. These four parameters, (I 1 /I 3) o, k¬q, o, and KB, were examined {{as a function of the}} DS and the type of hydrophobic modification (propionic versus hexanoic acid). As the DS of hexanoic acid of the HM-SNPs increased, pyrene experienced a decrease in the polarity of its local environment evident from a decrease in (I 1 /I 3) o while the microviscosity of the <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>aggregates</b> increased as indicated by an increase in o and a decrease in kq. Moreover, the interactions between SNPs and pyrene became stronger with increasing DS and were dependent on the surface area of the SNPs. All the parameters confirmed that the hydrophobicity of the HM-SNPs increased with increasing DS of hexanoic acid. The parameters also demonstrated that for a same DS, the environment generated by the SNPs modified with hexanoic acid was more hydrophobic than that of the SNPs modified with propionic acid. As it turns out, the photophysical parameters of pyrene retrieved for the SNPs modified with propionic acid were similar to those obtained with the naked SNPs. A model was proposed to account for the increase in SNP diameter due to aggregation observed at high SNP concentration. Its validity was supported by the good agreement obtained when comparing the average diameter predicted by the model with the hydrodynamic diameter of the SNPs determined by DLS. These studies led to the conclusion that hexanoic anhydride modification of SNPs appears to be more suitable than propionic acid modification to increase the hydrophobicity of SNPs. These measurements carried out with pyrene demonstrate that HM-SNPs can be generated where the level of hydrophobicity can be gauged based on the value of the (I 1 /I 3) o, k¬q, o, and KB parameters. Finally, interactions between pyrene and SNPs seem to occur at the SNPs surface which is reduced upon aggregation of the SNPs...|$|R

In relation with the gelation properties of whey proteins, this thesis deals with understanding the mechanism of peptide-induced aggregation of whey protein hydrolysates made with Bacillus licheniformis protease (BLP). The results show that BLP breaks down hydrophilic segments in the substrate and, therefore, preserves <b>hydrophobic</b> segments that <b>aggregate</b> once exposed to the solvent. Aggregation during hydrolysis prevented further degradation of the substrate, explaining that aggregating peptides are larger than the non-aggregating ones. Solubility experiments performed on fractionated aggregating peptides showed that peptide co-aggregation {{is an important factor}} in the aggregation process. Results also showed that the hydrolysates are able to aggregate added parental protein. The aggregating peptides could form a network in which the presence of both insoluble and partly insoluble peptides was required for the aggregation of intact protein...|$|R
