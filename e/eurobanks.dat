5000|$|Eurocredits are short-to-medium-term loans of Eurocurrency {{extended}} by <b>Eurobanks</b> to corporations, sovereign governments, nonprime banks, or international organizations. The loans are denominated in currencies {{other than the}} home currency of the Eurobank. Because these loans are frequently too large for a single bank to handle, <b>Eurobanks</b> will band {{together to form a}} bank lending syndicate to share the risk.The credit risk on these loans is greater than on loans to other banks in the interbank market. Thus, the interest rate on Eurocredits must compensate the bank, or banking syndicate, for the added credit risk. On Eurocredits originating in London the base lending rate is LIBOR. The lending rate on these credits is stated as LIBOR +X percent, where X is the lending margin charged depending upon the creditworthiness of the borrower. Additionally, rollover pricing was created on Eurocredits so that <b>Eurobanks</b> do not end up paying more on Eurocurrency time deposits than they earn from the loans. Thus, a Eurocredit may be viewed as a series of short-term loans, where {{at the end of each}} time period (generally three or six months), the loan is rolled over and the base lending rate is repriced to current LIBOR over the next time interval of the loan.|$|E
40|$|Stefano Battilossi, Financial {{innovation}} {{and the golden}} ages of international banking: 1890 1931 and 1958 81 Throughout the twentieth century, the internationalisation of banking was both a factor for, and an ensuing aspect of, rising globalisation. During the period 1890 1931, commercial banks of industrialised countries promoted organisational and process innovations that successfully challenged the dominance of merchant banks in international financial intermediation. International banking re-emerged from interwar nationalistic retrenchment during the late 1950 s, when banks exploited regulatory asymmetries to foster the emergence of Eurocurrency markets. <b>Eurobanks</b> provided not only global liquidity redistribution but also portfolio transformation services to corporate and sovereign customers. Financial innovations related to Eurobanking mark a secular discontinuity as they proved to be vehicles of a banking revolution, based on competition, deregulation and wholesale-market funding. ...|$|E
40|$|Fritz Machlup {{recently}} reproposed {{the issue}} of the logical foundation underlying the flows of funds denominated in dollars and other “strong” currencies which are traded in the so-called Euro-dollar market. The present paper shows that Machlup’s study picks out only some of the aspects of a more general theory presented elsewhere and underestimates the possibilities to empirical research opened up by the present statistical endowment. The central thrust of the analysis is the incorporation of the demand for and the supply of international liquidity within a unified framework. The authors first discuss the relationship between the U. S. balance of payments and the Eurodollar market. An interpretation of the empirical content to assign to the reserve position of <b>Eurobanks</b> is then suggested. Finally, the authors postpone to an appendix the discussion of Machlup’s six propositions in terms of a more general framework of international financial flows.   JEL: E 44, F 32 </p...|$|E
