In such a context, a new type of financial intermediary - the venture capital fund - knows an explosive growth, being directly linked to the proliferation of the new type of economic system. The development of the venture capital funds will not cause the disappearance of the traditional financing sources as this new <b>financial</b> <b>actor</b> „fills a gap“ in the financial system, which is developed in the present day form during the Industrial Age.

40|$|The {{increase}} in direct personal investment in capital market assets by Australians {{over the past}} two decades represents an unprecedented engagement with that sector of Australian economic life. This dissertation critically investigates claims that this engagement heralds a shareholder democracy. Increased economic participation based on private direct ownership of corporate securities could be interpreted as a weak form of democratisation. Using a class-theoretical framework, the dissertation conceptualises the private shareholder phenomenon as a process of embourgeoisement and argues that the development of a macro-level mass consumer financial products market is the result of capitalist class development and expansion. A thesis of strong democratisation proffers the notion that the private shareholder, as an ascendant class of <b>financial</b> <b>actor,</b> engages with real democratic processes in addition to simply owning securities. To test this thesis the dissertation measures the extent to which small shareholders control the objective conditions under which they accumulate greater wealth by seeking evidence of potential or actual engagement with macro-market and meso-corporate level social processes. The dissertation assesses macro-level practice by drawing on the work of Bourdieu and on notions of the social field. It considers the entry of the new class of <b>financial</b> <b>actor</b> to the financial field and analyses their capacity to accumulate and deploy informational capital, and compares their ability to influence a state-sponsored economic reform process (CLERP) with that of other actors. The dissertation analyses longitudinal ownership and shareholder voting data from a set of over 30 major Australian companies. It finds that the new class of economic actor is most prevalent in privatised state-owned enterprises and mutuals. In the context of an ideal Habermasian public sphere, the study considers the potential for small shareholders to participate in meso-level, corporate agenda-setting and deliberation. Using the ideal political space of Arendt, it searches for methods of achieving democratic outcomes. The dissertation finds that while the personal ownership of tradable financial assets may constitute a weak form of economic democratisation, small shareholders&# 146; inability to influence real outcomes, even in companies in which they constitute the majority, places substantial restrictions on the overall strength of the share ownership-as-democracy thesis...|$|E

40|$|I am very {{grateful}} to Libby Assassi, Marc Flandreau, and the various anonymous referees and editors of the Review of International Political Economy for their valuable comments and suggestions. Conventional theories of international hegemony all agree {{on the fact that}} the stabilizing functions of hegemons (i. e., nations which use their power to maintain orderly relations in a given issue-area) are positively correlated with their power. The public goods logic upon which this vision is founded posits that as any potential leader becomes more powerful in a given issue area, it will increasingly see its own welfare as synonymous with order in the entire constellation of relations within the issue area itself, and consequently have an incentive to provide the necessary public goods (i. e., the components of stability) to bring such order about. Monetary relations under the classical gold standard (1880 - 1914), however, demonstrated an entirely different set of circumstances.

40|$|Over {{the recent}} period, many {{emerging}} market economies and commodity-exporting nations are experiencing unprecented growth and accumulating unprecedented amounts {{of foreign exchange}} reserves. The management of these foreign reserves {{has led to the}} emergence of an important <b>financial</b> <b>actor,</b> namely the sovereign wealth fund (SWF). While SWFs have existed {{in one form or another}} since the 1950 s, it is only recently that they have risen in prominence and been exposed to public scrutiny and debate. In this paper, we outline their possible impact on international financial stability. We conclude that SWFs are long-term investors who can play a stabilizing role in financial markets by supplying liquidity and reducing market volatility. SWFs are also contributing to the gradual unwinding of global imbalances as they gradually diversify their portfolios. While the potential for destabilization by one or more SWFs does exist if other investors mimic the same investment strategies, there is little evidence of this occurring during the recent period. Similarly, the rise of financial protectionism as host countries adopt rules to protect sensitive industries might unduly restrict global capital flows, but is not likely to destabilize the international financial system...|$|E
40|$|The recent {{financial}} crisis brought into sharp relief fundamental {{questions about the}} social function and purpose of the financial system, including its relation to the “real” economy. This Article argues that, to answer these questions, we must recapture a distinctively American view of the proper relations among state, financial market, and development. This programmatic vision – captured in {{what we call a}} “developmental finance state” – is based on three key propositions: (1) that economic and social development is not an “end-state” but a continuing national policy priority; (2) that the modalities of finance are the most potent means of fueling continuous development; and (3) that the state, as the most potent <b>financial</b> <b>actor,</b> both must and often does pursue its developmental goals by acting endogenously – i. e., as a direct participant in private financial markets. In addition to articulating and elaborating the concept of the developmental finance state, this Article identifies and analyzes the principal modalities through which the modern American developmental finance state operates today. Finally, the Article proposes three broad strategic extensions of the existing modalities, with a view to enabling the emergence of a more ambitiously proactive and effective developmental finance state – and thus rediscovering a truly public-minded finance...|$|E

40|$|Sparked by the {{conjunction}} of food, fuel, and financial crises, {{there has been}} an increasing awareness in recent years of the scarce and finite character of natural resources. Productive resources such as agricultural land have been touted by financial actors—such as merchant banks, pension funds, and investment companies—as providing the basis for a range of new “alternative” financial asset classes and products. While the drivers, motives, and rationales behind the increasing interest of turning farmland into a financial asset class have been traced by a number of scholars, the interpretations of, and interactions with, <b>financial</b> <b>actors</b> at the community level have received less attention. Based on qualitative research in rural Australia, this paper reveals the grounds on which finance-backed investments have been accepted and accommodated by communities in rural Australia and delineates the reasons that have led to feelings of unease or refusal. The paper thereby demonstrates that the financialization of farmland is neither abstract nor one-sided but rather a multidimensional process that not only includes <b>financial</b> <b>actors</b> but also the impacted rural populations in various ways. Positioning the activities of <b>financial</b> <b>actors</b> in Australia within the emerging research on the financialization of farmland, the paper endorses context-sensitive analyses to better interpret these recent transformations of the agri-food system...|$|R
40|$|Market-based {{solutions}} {{to climate change}} are widely advocated by financial actors and policy makers in order to foster a smooth transition to a low-carbon economy. A first important limiting factor to this approach is widely recognized to be the imperfect information on investors' portfolios' exposure to climate-related risks. While better disclosure of climaterelevant information is often recommended as a remedy, the current lack of concise and comparable measures of portfolios' exposure to climate risk fails to provide major investors with the full incentives to reallocate their portfolios. A second limiting factor arises {{from the fact that}} in the context of the low-carbon transition, it is not clear how to measure the market share of participants because many economic sectors produce greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions or induce them along the supply chain. The lack of common and concise measures of the relevant market share hampers the ability of policy makers to ensure fair competition policies and the ability of major investors to assess the effects of their own and their competitors' portfolio reallocation. To address these two gaps, we propose two novel and complementary indices: (i) the "GHG exposure," capturing the exposure of single investors' portfolios to climate transition risks, and (ii) "GHG holding," capturing the market share of each <b>financial</b> <b>actor</b> weighted by its contribution to GHG emissions. We illustrate the use of the indices on a dataset of portfolios of equity holdings and loans in the Euro-Area, and we discuss the policy implications for the low-carbon transition...|$|E
40|$|This paper, which {{selectively}} {{focuses on}} the contested concept of Corporate Social Responsibility [CSR], forms {{part of a larger}} research project on the evolution of corporate governance. This research posits the evolution of corporate governance along three historical paradigms: first, the economic/industrial organization paradigm, second, the financial paradigm, and third, the knowledge paradigm. With regard to CSR, the paper explores the promises and shortcomings of the concept against the background of an evolutionary theory of corporate governance. The identification of three historical-conceptual paradigms allows us to trace the development of the relation between a general discourse on corporate governance regulation [CGR] {{on the one hand and}} a more specialized, often polemic debate over corporate (social, environmental, human rights) responsibilities on the other. On the basis of the review of the three paradigms of CSR over the course of more than one hundred years, the paper concludes that there is no convincing justification to separate the general Corporate Governance from the more specific CSR discourse when assessing the nature of the corporation. Instead, it is argued that a more adequate understanding of what defines a corporation is gained when capturing its embedded nature in a continuously changing domestic, global and functional environment. Besides being both a legal fiction and an economic actor, the business corporation is assuming a host of other roles in a functionally differentiated global society. The paper suggests that the generation and dissemination of knowledge, both internally and externally, has become the defining feature of the firm. The corporation as a knowledge actor succeeds the prior stages of assessing it as a private, political or <b>financial</b> <b>actor,</b> without however erasing these dimensions of the firm. In that, the history of the corporation - as concept and reality - shares important features with that of the state - as concept and as fact. corporate social responsibility, corporate governance, financialisation, economic sociology, knowledge society, uncertainty, risk, management...|$|E

40|$|Dominant theorisations of {{investment}} decision making remain firmly wedded {{to the notion}} of economic rationality, either as a postulate of how <b>financial</b> <b>actors</b> actually behave or as a normative ideal to which <b>financial</b> <b>actors</b> should strive. However, such frameworks have been developed largely without engaging financial market participants themselves. Based on 51 in-depth interviews with fund managers in various global financial centres, this article highlights a number of features {{of investment}} decision making that mainstream finance and behavioural approaches both fail adequately to describe. Drawing on psychoanalytic theory, it is shown how the inherent uncertainty of the investment process engenders a state of endemic anxiety among fund managers. This anxiety is managed via a range of mental defences, both conscious and unconscious. The importance fund managers place on meeting and putting trust in company management to ‘perform’ for them can equally be viewed as a means of alleviating anxiety rather than having any direct economic purpose. This article, furthermore, brings to light the crucial role that calculative techniques play in dealing with anxiety. Rather than constituting a means of restoring rationality or correcting cognitive biases, calculation can actually reinforce ego defences while simultaneously perpetuating the myth of homo economicus. Fund managers can be characterised as ‘doing’ but ‘not doing’ and ‘knowing’ but ‘choosing not to know’ and have to manage not only their clients' funds, but their own personal anxiety as well...|$|R

This is reinforced by climate change concerns, nuclear dangers and accumulating radioactive waste, high oil prices, peak oil and increasing government support for renewable energy.

40|$|In the {{financial}} world, stocks {{should provide a}} greater return than safe investments such as Treasury bonds. This {{is due to a}} higher risk involved when obtaining stocks in comparison to treasury bonds. Thus, the higher risk involved, the higher return is expected by the investors. The return expected over the risk-free rate is a compensation for the risk. This compensation {{is referred to as the}} market risk premium (MRP). According to financial researchers, it is not only the magnitude of the MRP discussed controversially among economists, but also the appropriate methodology to calculate meaning-ful estimates. The various estimation methods can be generalized as the historical approach (ex post) and the forward-looking approach (ex ante). The purpose of this thesis is to investigate the application of the estimation methods for-practical investment decitions and to observe which estimate (ex-post or/and ex-ante) the <b>financial</b> <b>actors</b> find to be optimal as an input for decision making. Data will be gathered from a small group of respondents in order to receive an in-depth comprehension of the subject matter. Hence, the nature of the data in this research dictates the application of qualitative methods.

Furthermore, it could be concluded that investors can apply different values of MRP as an input for models and investment deci-sions due to the fact that the choice of the fair MRP involves some subjective judgments from the individual analyst or investor...|$|R

Food studies scholars have paid increasing attention to ‘financialization’ within the food system as private <b>financial</b> <b>actors</b> have played a growing role in various facets of the sector in recent years. While there has been much attention paid to the implications of the greater role for <b>financial</b> <b>actors</b> in the food system, there has been relatively less attention paid {{to the ways in which}} these actors have historically interacted with it; in particular, in relation to the role of the state in mediating agricultural finance. This paper examines the long association between agriculture, finance and the state. Historically, private capital has been reluctant to invest in agriculture without assurances and support from the state, and states have practiced varying degrees of regulation on private financiers in the sector. These trends have shaped the practices of contemporary financialization. Although we recognize the systematic political project to reduce the role of the state in agriculture since the 1970 s, these patterns persist and we ultimately argue that to understand the financialization of agriculture, it is important to understand how the state has been a long-standing coupler between finance and agriculture...|$|R
