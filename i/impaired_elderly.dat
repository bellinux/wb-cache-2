40|$|The {{changes that}} occur during aging are {{accompanied}} by limitations in functional performance that <b>impair</b> <b>elderly</b> people's social participation and consequently harm their quality of life. In the SABE Study (São Paulo, Brazil), the results indicated relationships between life expectancy without disabilities and demographic and social variables. This article sought to evaluate these and other variables together as explanatory factors for {{the presence or absence}} of difficulties in instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), directly related to the possibility of more efficient community participation. Five of the eight questions relating to IADL that were applied to the sample of 2, 143 elderly individuals in the municipality of São Paulo in 2000 were considered. Odds ratios were calculated using logistic regression. All the socio-demographic variables analyzed (age, income, ethnicity, schooling, and gender) were significant, with the exception of "sufficient money".

40|$|Purpose. To {{assess the}} degree of {{participation}} of the visually <b>impaired</b> <b>elderly</b> {{and to make a}} comparison with population-based reference data. Method. This cross-sectional study included visually <b>impaired</b> <b>elderly</b> persons (>/= 55 years; n = 173) who were referred to a low-vision rehabilitation centre. Based on the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) participation in: (1) domestic life, (2) interpersonal interactions and relationships, (3) major life areas, and (4) community, social and civic life was assessed by means of telephone interviews. In addition, we assessed perceived participation restrictions. Results. Comparison with reference data of the elderly showed that visually <b>impaired</b> <b>elderly</b> persons participated less in heavy household activities, recreational activities and sports activities. No differences were found for the interpersonal interactions and relationships domain. Participants experienced restrictions in household activities (84 %), socializing (53 %), paid or voluntary work (92 %), and leisure activities (88 %). Conclusions. Visually <b>impaired</b> <b>elderly</b> persons participate in society, but they participate less than their peers. They experience restrictions as a result of vision loss. These findings are relevant, since participation is an indicator for successful aging and has a positive influence on health and subjective well-being...|$|E
40|$|One major {{priority}} {{for health care}} professionals is {{to minimize the risk}} of fall in the elderly population. While {{the quality of life of}} an individual is affected by fall accidents, management of post-fall disability in the elderly could be a huge economic burden to the society. Visually <b>impaired</b> <b>elderly</b> are at a higher risk of fall, because "vision", an important component contributing to balance, is disturbed. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of an exercise programme, which focused on improvement of the functional balance of visually <b>impaired</b> <b>elderly.</b> Visually <b>impaired</b> <b>elderly</b> residents were randomly assigned to either the exercise training or control group. A multidimensional, individually tailored exercise programme was introduced by physiotherapists to the exercise group for 12 weeks. Functional balance status reflected by the Berg Balance Scale, chair stand test, and timed up-and-go test assessed before and after the 12 -week training programme was compared between the two groups. Results demonstrated a significant improvement in balance outcomes in the exercise group (p< 0. 05) but not in the control group. The results of this study suggest that a physiotherapist-designed stren~thening and balance-training programme can improve the functional balance status of visually <b>impaired</b> <b>elderly.</b> Department of Rehabilitation Science...|$|E
40|$|Speaking {{disorders}} frequently {{result in}} serious consequences for mentally <b>impaired</b> <b>elderly</b> people. Two examples are presented illustrating the modification of both excess and deficit rates of talking via differential reinforcement procedures. Two men exhibiting verbal disorders {{severe enough to}} impair social interactions and lead to possible nursing home placement were treated by teaching their spouses to reinforce positive and ignore undesired verbal responses. Problem behaviors were reduced sufficiently to permit continued home care, and alternative positive behaviors were increased. These findings suggest that verbal behavior of the mentally <b>impaired</b> <b>elderly</b> can be affected by applying systematic consequences and can be modified by relatively simple procedures. These procedures provide {{an alternative to the}} negative effects of labels associated with either aversive or deficient verbal behaviors, promote more positive activities, and enable continued residence at home. Further, this research provides support for the generality of the utility of training spouses to serve as behavior therapists for the <b>impaired</b> <b>elderly...</b>|$|E

40|$|Immunosenescence {{contributes}} to the decreased ability of the elderly to control infectious diseases, which is also reflected in their generally poor response to new antigens and vaccination. It is known that the T cell branch {{of the immune system}} is <b>impaired</b> in the <b>elderly</b> mainly due to expansion of memory/effector cells that renders the immune system less able to respond to new antigens. B lymphocytes are also <b>impaired</b> in the <b>elderly</b> in terms of their response to new antigens.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the prevalence of loneliness among visually <b>impaired</b> <b>elderly,</b> and its relations with adaptation to vision loss, received social support and depression. Clients aged 55 years or older who contacted Sensis, a rehabilitation centre for visually impaired people, are approached to take part in this observational study. Exclusion criteria are hearing and cognitive impairments. The participants receive an interview by telephone in which loneliness, adaptation to vision loss, received social support and depression are investigated. The results indicate a high prevalence of loneliness (54 %) among visually <b>impaired</b> <b>elderly.</b> Compared to visually <b>impaired</b> <b>elderly</b> who are not lonely, the lonely ones show a poorer adaptation to vision loss (mean = 22. 7 (S. D. = 6. 79) versus mean = 27. 8 (S. D. = 5. 32); t = 6. 08 (194. 84); p =. 000), less received social support (mean = 26. 3 (S. D. = 5. 99) versus 29. 4 (S.

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} factors related to the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of caregivers providing continuing home care for the <b>impaired</b> <b>elderly</b> focusing mainly on care managers ’ support given to caregivers. Two interviews over a course of 12 months were conducted with 42 caregivers. The questionnaire items for the caregivers included demographic variables, HRQOL, the satisfaction level of care managers, coping ability, and depressive state. For the <b>impaired</b> <b>elderly,</b> the questionnaire items included demographic variables, abilities of activities of daily living, dementia assessment, and depressive state. The mean age of the caregivers was 66. 1 ± 8. 8. By logistic regression analysis with HRQOL as a dependent variable, the caregivers ’ physical QOL was significantly related to the depressive state of <b>impaired</b> <b>elderly</b> and the caregivers’ satisfaction with their care manager, whereas the caregivers ’ mental QOL was significantly related to the caregivers ’ sense of coherence and satisfaction with their care manager. These results suggest that the care managers ’ support to caregivers who provide continuing home care is important for caregivers ’ HRQOL...|$|E

Additional needs arise from disabilities and handicaps that limit the patient's ability to perform daily tasks and to communicate. Relatives and others can provide a natural support network central to the patient's ability to maintain some measure of autonomy. Any factors undermining this network's commmitment to provide care should be identified. Yet, most mentally <b>impaired</b> <b>elderly</b> persons are not known to the health care system.

40|$|Primary {{caregivers}} ’ {{perceptions of}} {{the overall quality of}} care given to their <b>impaired</b> <b>elderly</b> relatives are more strongly related to the perceived helpfulness of selected formal care providers (home aides, physicians, and social workers) than to the perceived helpfulness of selected kin caregivers. Caregiver race and age, the types of other family members who are helping, and whether a nurse is involved influence caregivers’{{perceptions of the}} helpfulness of these formal care providers. Research on the care given to chronically ill and <b>impaired</b> <b>elderly</b> has established that the majority have multiple helpers who make up a helping network (Barer & Johnson, 1990; Penrod, R. A. Kane, R. L. Kane, & Finch, 1995). Most of these investigations focus on the composition of informal helper networks and the types of assistance they provide. The primary infor-mal caregiver, typically a spouse or daughter(in-law), generally is used as the informant about the larger network of helpers. Reliance on a primary caregiv-er’s perception is consistent with long-standing concerns about the effects of caregiving on this individual’s health and well-being. Less often investigated is the perceived quality of care given to <b>impaired</b> <b>elderly,</b> the presence and consequences of formal service providers as partici-pants in helping networks, and the influence of formal helpers on perceptions of quality of care. Lack of attention to these features may extend from the supposition that the quality of care is good when provided by one’s family members and that currently, most home- and community-based care i...|$|E
