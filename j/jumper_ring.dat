5000|$|Davis {{was born}} October 22, 1992 in Los Angeles. She {{grew up in}} California and started taking riding lessons {{at the age of}} five. She grew as a rider and was {{supported}} by her family, who had some equestrian background, as her grandfather, Robert Barron Freize, was a jockey's agent, and her mother rode casually. Davis accompanied her mother to the barn {{a few times a week}} and quickly became interested in horses. Her early riding career was with trainer Chacha Levinson at the Sullivan Canyon Preservation Association. She later moved to train with Archie Cox at Middle Ranch to compete in the hunters and equitation on the A and AA levels. During her time with Cox, Davis won many national championships in the equitaiton and hunters which include World Champion Hunter Rider in 2007. [...] Davis showed in the pony and junior hunters competitive divisions before convincing her mother to let her compete in the <b>jumper</b> <b>ring</b> when she was fourteen. From then on, she advanced from the Low Junior Jumpers (1.20m) on her first junior jumper, Mister Mind. Growing up, Davis also played soccer, but she later dropped the sport at age sixteen to pursue equestrian competition full-time.|$|E
