40|$|This {{in-depth}} study {{looked at a}} major manufacturing company during a year when management projected contract losses and massive lay-offs and terminations. The company's <b>hourly</b> <b>employee</b> culture indicated that the major automotive customers of the company were influential driving forces and would rescue the company from the dire management predictions. The principal major research question {{was to determine the}} accuracy of predictions based upon the company's hourly workers' culture versus management's predictions and actions based upon external sources. Another investigation area was the company management's actions to manifest their avowed "our employees are our most valuable resource and asset" belief statement. Similarly, would the Professional and Technician Equal Employment Opportunity job groups have the smallest percent of reduction, since the company's primary strength was purported to lie in its engineering and technical employees?Interviews, data collection and analysis, and monthly task force investigations and communications revealed the company culture was definitely more accurate than the numerous predictions made by management. As the "culture" predicted, the loss of the contracts did not occur. The company concluded the year with increases in total employment. Temporary lay-offs did occur during the year and management took numerous actions to help both retained employees and those being terminated or laid-off. Such actions included outplacement services, stress reduction programs, job placement and resume writing, and instituting communication networks and procedures and a Dispute Resolution Procedure. The company did show that the employees were valuable and important assets. The reduction numbers and percents for the Professionals (engineers) and Technicians were exactly opposite of what management typically avowed. The largest category reduced was the Technicians and the second-largest category was the Professionals. The company continued to be quite viable and the future outlook became optimistic, which coincides with the company culture that the major automotive customers will always be there needing the company's products. The company management took several steps to prevent their predictions from occurring, while hourly employees, using only history which is not a very dependable source for industry today, happened to be correct in this study. The primary conclusion was that the culture of the company's hourly workers was more accurate in predicting the future than management's predictions based on supposed knowledgeable external sources. It was recommended that internal cultural based predictions and externally based information be blended together for the most accurate predictions. This will provide all managements everywhere a better information base for making decisions, particularly strategic planning decisions. Center for Lifelong EducationThesis (D. Ed. ...|$|E

We construct the theoretical base of the research in three areas: 1) the discussion of the faculty teach-learning practices according to the centrality that strategies discharge; in the professor, the pupil or the interrelation between them; 2) a historical retaken of the Occupational Therapy education in Brazil and the Curricular policies; 3) the concern of the gerontology and geriatry education in health education specifically in the Occupational Therapy. In the methodology resorted we consider the relation with the world where they got into and the understanding of meaning that the respondent give to their practices, being this research characterized as qualitative. Five universities had been part of this study, which seven professors responsible for the curricular component who had answered to a questionnaire and had granted an interview had been part of this research we also consult the professor teaching design and the register of the privileged curricular component. The data had been analyzed using the thematic analysis from the following orienting core: curricular component characteristics, professor profile, conceptions and estimated on education and learning, teach-learning strategies, scenes of teach-learning and possibility and limits in the application of the strategies. The analysis and discussion of results, had allowed to know the professor who, in its majority: are women, they follow exclusively the teaching profession, and work like <b>hourly</b> <b>employee.</b> The teaching time varies between 6 and 24 years. Barely two professors are doctors, four have master degree and one specialist. The interviwee perceive the teaching identity as fruit of the experiences that construct throughout their trajectories, influenced for personal and group issues. All professors considered relevant a good professional performance, have the rule over the area of knowledge in geriatry and gerontology, be able to use compatible education strategies with the characteristics of this curricular component;be engaged with the student independence and intellectual, teaching motivation and be fond of the area. The data show us that the searched professors follow the teaching in diverse scenes: classroom, ambulatory, hospitals, centers of sociability and health basic units; what it is presented as a possibility to integrate knowledge and approach the students to the different health area contexts, considering the insertion in the Unified Health System (UHS). Also they use a diversity of strategies from among appear: dialogued descriptive class, readings and research, studies of case and the dramatization associates to render a problem as area of class development. The investigated professors had demonstrated to be worried in knowing the expectations of the students and also using their previous experiences turn education into a most significant and stir them up responsible in the pursuit of knowledge. All the professors had been placed as facilitator of this process using the dialogue as instigator of teach-learning process tending to an integral formation of their students. utilizadas por professores de Terapia Ocupacional do Estado de São Paulo na implementação de estratégias de ensino-aprendizagem no componente curricular Gerontologia/ Geriatria em cursos de Terapia Ocupacional. Construímos a base teórica da pesquisa em três eixos: 1) a discussão das práticas de ensinoaprendizagem dos professores segundo a centralidade no professor, no aluno ou na inter-relação entre eles; 2) uma retomada histórica do ensino da Terapia Ocupacional no Brasil e das Diretrizes Curriculares e 3) a importância do ensino da Gerontologia e Geriatria no ensino em saúde e, especificamente, no curso de Terapia Ocupacional. Na metodologia empregada consideramos a relação com o mundo em que estão inseridos e a compreensão do significado que os sujeitos pesquisados dão à sua prática, sendo esta pesquisa caracterizada como qualitativa. Fizeram parte deste estudo cinco universidades, das quais sete professores, responsáveis pelo componente curricular, responderam a um questionário e concederam uma entrevista, também consultamos o plano de aula e o ementário do componente curricular privilegiado. Os dados foram analisados utilizando a análise temática a partir dos seguintes núcleos orientadores: características do componente curricular, perfil do professor, concepções e pressupostos sobre ensino e aprendizagem, estratégias de ensino-aprendizagem, cenários de ensinoaprendizagem e possibilidade e limites na aplicação das estratégias. A análise e a discussão dos resultados permitiram identificar o perfil dos professores que, na sua maioria: são mulheres, exercem exclusivamente a profissão de professor, e a maioria trabalha em regime horista. O tempo de docência varia entre 6 e 24 anos. Apenas dois professores são doutores, quatro são mestres e um especialista. Os entrevistados percebem a identidade docente como fruto das experiências que constroem ao longo de suas trajetórias profissionais, influenciada, assim, por questões pessoais e grupais. Todos consideram ser importante para o bom desempenho profissional ter domínio sobre a área de conhecimento em Gerontologia/ Geriatria, ser capaz de utilizar estratégias de ensino compatíveis com as características desse componente curricular; ter compromisso com a independência e autonomia intelectual dos alunos, ter motivação para a docência e gostar da área. Os dados nos mostraram que os professores pesquisados exercem a docência em diversos cenários: sala de aula, ambulatórios, hospitais, centros de convivência e unidades básicas de saúde; o que se apresenta como uma possibilidade de integrar conhecimentos e aproximar os alunos aos diferentes contextos da área de saúde, considerando a inserção no Sistema Único de Saúde (SUS). Também utilizam uma diversidade de estratégias, entre as principais aparecem: a aula expositiva dialogada, as leituras e pesquisas, os estudos de caso e as dramatizações associadas à problematização como eixo do desenvolvimento das aulas. Os professores investigados demonstraram preocupar-se em conhecer as expectativas dos alunos e em utilizar suas experiências prévias, tornando o ensino mais significativo, e também em fazê-los se responsabilizarem pela busca do conhecimento. Todos os professores colocaram-se como facilitadores desse processo, utilizando o diálogo como promotor do processo de ensino-aprendizagem, visando a uma formação integral de seus alunos.

Most research on job status, however, has focused on salaried populations, and it remains unclear whether job status operates similarly among hourly workers. Our objectives were to examine whether hourly status itself influences risk of hypertension after adjustment for socioeconomic confounders, and to explore the role of fine-scale job grade on hypertension incidence within hourly and salaried groups. We examined data for 14, 999 aluminum manufacturing employees in 11 plants across the U. S., using logistic regression with adjustment for age, sex, race/ethnicity and other individual characteristics. Propensity score restriction was used to identify comparable groups of <b>hourly</b> and salaried <b>employees,</b> reducing confounding by sociodemographic characteristics. Job grade (coded 1 through 30, within hourly and salaried groups) was examined as a more refined measure of job status. Hourly status was associated with an increased risk of hypertension, after propensity restriction and adjustment for confounders. The observed effect of hourly status was stronger among women, although the propensity-restricted cohort was disproportionately male (96 %). Among salaried workers, higher job grade was not consistently associated with decreased risk; among <b>hourly</b> <b>employees,</b> however, there was a significant trend, with higher job grades more protective against hypertension.
