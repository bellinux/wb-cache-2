5|$|Historic {{preservation}} in Chicago {{has saved}} {{some of the}} city's architectural heritage. The efforts of the Chicago Architecture Foundation and the Landmarks and Preservation Council of Illinois <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> forefront of these efforts. The Commission on Chicago Landmarks (now part of the city's Department of Planning and Development) has designated the Prairie Avenue Historic District as a city landmark.|$|E
5|$|The route was {{approved}} {{and the bill}} received royal assent on 28 March 1893 as the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway Act, 1893. Stations were permitted at Baker Street, Oxford Circus, Piccadilly Circus, Trafalgar Square, Embankment and Waterloo. The depot would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{south end of the}} line at James Street and Lower Marsh.|$|E
5|$|As a tyrannosaurid, Albertosaurus was a bipedal {{predator}} with tiny, two-fingered {{hands and}} a massive head that had dozens of large, sharp teeth. It may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> top {{of the food chain}} in its local ecosystem. While Albertosaurus was large for a theropod, it was much smaller than its larger and more famous relative Tyrannosaurus rex, growing nine to ten meters long and weighing less than possibly 2 metric tons.|$|E

5|$|Confusion arose when {{an issue}} of the French daily {{newspaper}} Le Petit Journal, published on 24 July 1904 {{on the occasion of}} the bey of Tunis's visit to France, reproduced an illustration showing the flag used while was visiting the Hôtel de Ville, Paris. Ivan Sache of Flags of the World claimed that this flag design, which hadn't been seen earlier, may have been inaccurate, suggesting that the journalist might not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> affair or he had reproduced a drawing of the wrong flag.|$|E
5|$|In September 1922, {{the ground}} held a Grand Fete, {{to raise money}} to repair the tower of Blacklands Church. In 1948, the ground was flooded, and the Public Health Committee report into the storm floods had to be {{withdrawn}} after a magistrate appeared to provide misinformation in his statutory declaration. In his declaration, he had claimed to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Central Recreation Ground for two 15 minute time periods during the flooding period and claimed to have seen the flooding, but at those times, the ground had not yet been flooded. The ground had previously flooded in 1866, when one resident noted that it had been underwater many times within their memory.|$|E
5|$|The 1977 {{science fiction}} film Close Encounters of the Third Kind {{featured}} a {{depiction of the}} Flight 19 planes being discovered in the Sonoran Desert, apparently set there by extraterrestrial forces and later their pilots are returned to Earth by peaceful alien captors. In the film, the returned fliers are depicted at the age they would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time of their disappearance, but have fictional names.|$|E

5|$|The {{front part}} of a skull (specimen NMP P6V-004389, a syntype of this species) in the National Museum of Prague was found in 1850 among {{the remains of the}} Böhmisches Museum. Other {{elements}} supposedly belonging to this specimen have been listed in the literature, but it appears only the partial skull was ever present. It may be what remains of one of the stuffed dodos known to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> menagerie of Emperor Rudolph II, possibly the specimen painted by Hoefnagel or Savery there.|$|E
5|$|Bede {{sometimes}} {{included in}} his theological books an {{acknowledgement of the}} predecessors on whose works he drew. In two cases he left instructions that his marginal notes, which gave {{the details of his}} sources, should be preserved by the copyist, and he may have originally added marginal comments about his sources to others of his works. Where he does not specify, it is still possible to identify books to which he must have had access by quotations that he uses. A full catalogue of the library available to Bede in the monastery cannot be reconstructed, but it is possible to tell, for example, that Bede was very familiar with the works of Virgil. There is little evidence that he had access to any other of the pagan Latin writers—he quotes many of these writers but the quotes are almost all {{to be found in the}} Latin grammars that were common in his day, one or more of which would certainly <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> monastery. Another difficulty is that manuscripts of early writers were often incomplete: it is apparent that Bede had access to Pliny's Encyclopedia, for example, but it seems that the version he had was missing book xviii, as he would almost certainly have quoted from it in his De temporum ratione.|$|E
5|$|In July 1095, Urban {{turned to}} his {{homeland}} of France to recruit men for the expedition. His travels there culminated in the Council of Clermont in November, where, according to the various speeches attributed to him, he gave an impassioned sermon to a large audience of French nobles and clergy, graphically detailing the fantastical atrocities being committed against pilgrims and eastern Christians. There are five versions of the speech recorded by people who may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> council (Baldric of Dol, Guibert of Nogent, Robert the Monk, and Fulcher of Chartres) or who went on crusade (Fulcher and the anonymous author of the Gesta Francorum), {{as well as other}} versions found in later historians (such as William of Malmesbury and William of Tyre). All of these versions were written after Jerusalem had been captured. Thus {{it is difficult to know}} what was actually said and what was recreated in the aftermath of the successful crusade. The only contemporary records are a few letters written by Urban in 1095.|$|E

5|$|Most {{people who}} stay at Glastonbury Festival camp in a tent. There are {{different}} camping areas, {{each with its}} own atmosphere. Limekilns and Hitchin Hill Ground are quieter camping areas, whereas Pennard Hill Ground is a lively campsite. Cockmill Meadow is a family campsite and Wicket Ground was introduced in 2011 as a second family-only campsite. A disabled campsite is also available in Spring Ground. Campsite accommodation is provided in the cost of a standard entry ticket but festival-goers must bring their own tents. Tipis <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> festival for many years. A limited number of fixed tipis are available for hire at the tipi field near the stone circle. Up to six adults can stay in each tipi and each one comes with a groundsheet and raincatcher. Internal bedding and camping equipment is not provided. Tipi Park also offers solar showers and a log-fired yurt sauna to cap off the experience.|$|E
5|$|The National Hurricane Center {{initially}} {{thought the}} center might not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> surface, {{and the agency}} indicated low forecasting confidence, as they could not determine a circulation center. The difficulty arose from the large, sprawling nature of the storm, and by later on May 27 a new center formed, as confirmed by radar imagery and the Hurricane Hunters. That night, the extremely small center made landfall just south of Savannah, Georgia, affecting a very small area with winds of 65mph (100km/h) and a minimum pressure of 991 mbar (hPa; 29.26 inHg). Around the time of landfall, Alpha developed a warm core, indicating some tropical characteristics. The storm weakened quickly over land, although it did not dissipate until two days later over the northeast Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The SPARS were {{assigned}} to every USCG district except Puerto Rico, and served in Hawaii and Alaska as well. Most officers held general duty billets, which included administrative and supervisory assignments. Other officers served as communication officers, supply officers, barracks, and recruiting officers. The bulk of the enlisted women performed clerical and stenographic duties. In smaller numbers, the enlisted personnel were found in practically every other billet, from baking pies to rigging parachutes and driving jeeps. A select group of SPAR officers and enlisted personnel were also assigned {{to work with the}} Long Range Aid to Navigation at monitoring stations in the Continental United States. Better known under the acronym LORAN, it was a top-secret radio navigation system developed for ships at sea and long-range aircraft. The first monitoring station staffed by SPARS was at Chatham, Massachusetts. Chatham is believed to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> (<b>at</b> <b>the</b> time) the only all female-staffed station {{of its kind in the}} world. The SPARS peak strength was approximately 11,000 officers and enlisted personnel. Commodore J. A. Hirschfield, USCG, said the SPARS volunteered for duty when their country needed them, and they did their jobs with enthusiasm, efficiency, and with a minimum of fanfare. To honor the SPARS, two USCG cutters were given their name.|$|E
