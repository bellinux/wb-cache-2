5000|$|In 1899, Monmouth Corporation {{established}} one of {{the first}} publicly owned <b>electricity</b> <b>generating</b> <b>stations</b> in the country at Osbaston. The power station used water power to drive turbines. The height of the weir was raised to impound a reservoir, and the water was directed by a leat to the turbines underneath the brick building, which housed three alternators.

50|$|The final major {{evolution}} of the steam engine design {{was the use of}} steam turbines starting in the late part of the 19th century. Steam turbines are generally more efficient than reciprocating piston type steam engines (for outputs above several hundred horsepower), have fewer moving parts, and provide rotary power directly instead of through a connecting rod system or similar means. Steam turbines virtually replaced reciprocating engines in <b>electricity</b> <b>generating</b> <b>stations</b> early in the 20th century, where their efficiency, higher speed appropriate to generator service, and smooth rotation were advantages. Today most electric power is provided by steam turbines. In the United States 90% of the electric power is produced in this way using a variety of heat sources. Steam turbines were extensively applied for propulsion of large ships throughout most of the 20th century.|$|E

40|$|We {{determined}} {{the utility of}} inclined-plane traps for capturing smolts of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar and studied {{the timing of the}} downriver run and survival of smolts in the Connecticut River in 1985 and 1986. We captured 22 smolts with one trap in 1985, and 45 with three traps in 1986. Although these numbers were small, the results from both years were similar. Mean total lengths of smolts (ranges in parentheses) were 186 mm (152 - 206 mm) in 1985 and 178 mm (152 - 201 mm) in 1986. The migration period in both years extended from early April to mid-May. Mean river temperatures when smolts were captured were 10. 5 Â°C (4. 5 - 16. 0 Â°C) in 1985 and 10. 3 Â°C (4. 5 - 15. 0 Â°C) in 1986. Most smolts were captured several weeks after the period of peak spring flows that probably would have provided the safest passage past <b>electricity</b> <b>generating</b> <b>stations.</b> The recapture rates of tagged hatchery smolts stocked 8 km upstream from the trap were 1 of 4, 400 (0. 023 %) in 1985 and 1 of 2, 900 (0. 034 %) in 1986. These rates were significantly higher than the recapture rates of tagged hatchery smolts stocked in headwater tributaries. The seemingly poor survival of smolts from headwater tributaries was probably caused largely by the low river flows when smolts migrated and a lack of smolt protection or passage at <b>electricity</b> <b>generating</b> <b>stations</b> on the Connecticut River. Increasing the survival of smolts will require that downstream passage or protection be provided at all generating stations that are likely to kill or injure migrating smolts...|$|E

40|$|Greenhouse gas {{emissions}} from fossil fired <b>electricity</b> <b>generating</b> <b>stations</b> will dramatically {{increase over the}} next 20 years. Nuclear energy is the only fully developed technology able to supply large amounts of electricity without generation of greenhouse gases. However, the problem of noncompetitive economics and public concerns about radioactive waste disposal, safety, and nuclear weapons proliferation may prevent the reemergence of nuclear power as a preferred option for new electric energy generation in the US. This paper discusses a new research program to help address these issues, by developing fuel designs capable of burnup values in excess of 60 MWD/kgU. The objectives of the program are to: Improve the reliability and robustness of light water reactor fuel, thereby improving safety margins; significantly increase the energy generated by each fuel loading, thereby achieving longer operating cycles, higher capacity factors, and lower cost electric power; significantly reduce the volume of spent nuclear fuel discharged for disposal by allowing more energy to be extracted from each fuel element prior to discharge; and develop fuel that is much more proliferation resistant...|$|E
40|$|The {{methodology}} of life-cycle assessment was applied {{in order to}} evaluate the environmental performance of a hypothetical Saskatchewan lignite-fueled Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) electricity generation, with and without pre-combustion carbon dioxide (CO 2) capture from a full life-cycle perspective. The emphasis here is placed on environmental performance associated with air contaminants of the comparison between IGCC systems (with and without CO 2 capture) and a competing lignite pulverized coal-fired electricity generating station in order to reveal which technology offers the most positive environmental effects. Moreover, ambient air pollutant modeling was also conducted by using American Meteorological Society/Environmental Protection Agency Regulatory Model (AERMOD) air dispersion modeling to determine the ground-level concentration of pollutants emitted from four different <b>electricity</b> <b>generating</b> <b>stations.</b> This study assumes that all stations are located close to Estevan. The results showed {{a significant reduction in}} greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and acidification potential by applying both post-combustion and pre-combustion CO 2 capture processes. The GHG emissions were found to have reduced by 27 %â€“ 86 %, and IGCC systems were found to compare favorably to pulverized coal systems. However, in other environmental impact categories, there are multiple environmental trade-offs depending on the capture technology used. In the case of post-combustion capture, it was observed that the environmental impact category of eutrophication potential, summer smog, and ozone depletion increased due to the application of the CO 2 capture process and the surface mining coal operation. IGCC systems, on the other hand, showed the same tendency as the conventional coal-fired electricity generation systems, but to a lesser degree. This is because the IGCC system is a cleaner technology that produces lower pollutant emission levels than the electricity generating station; thus, the benefits of capture are reduced on a comparative basis. The results from air dispersion analysis showed that the maximum ground-level concentrations of pollutants from all <b>electricity</b> <b>generating</b> <b>stations</b> are in compliance with all air quality standards, except for Co, Pb and Ni. The IGCC with capture revealed the lowest nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) ground-level concentration compared to all other scenarios. Moreover, IGCC systems both with and without pre-combustion CO 2 capture revealed no ground-level concentration of trace elements. This is because the IGCC system operates with an acid gas cleaning process that removes most of the trace contaminants from the syngas...|$|E
40|$|Electric {{power is}} {{essential}} to the functioning of the nation in the industrial, commercial, and domestic aspects. Electricity is supplied to Australia from a range of <b>electricity</b> <b>generating</b> <b>stations</b> via a 38, 000 km network of power lines. Currently this country has about 110 Coal fired, Natural Gas and Hydro power stations (of 50 MWe or greater) that supply most of the 56, 000 MWe (i. e. megawatts of electric power) to the nation. The largest of these stations burn black or brown coal to obtain the heat energy to convert to electricity. In addition, burning natural gas is increasingly being used to augment supplies, while other sources of note are hydro power (i. e. using the energy of descending water), wind farms (using the energy of wind) and photoelectric panels (using the energy of the sun). Currently the distribution of these sources of electric generating capacity are: coal 54 %, natural gas 26 %, hydro 13 %, and other renewables 4. 5 %, {{but in terms of the}} actual electricity produced (i. e. kilowatt-hours) coal provides 77 %, natural gas 15. 2 %, hydro 4. 8 % and other renewables 2. 7 %.
