However, the domestic counterpart has been even-higher rates of investment as opposed to lower rates of saving and a more sustainable growth of public and private consumption.

40|$|Since {{the end of}} the Second World War {{the world}} economy has, apart from brief interludes of price stability, been in the grip of {{continuous}} inflation. No country seems to have managed to escape this world inflation entirely, although a few have made the very greatest efforts to do so. The present article considers why these efforts were in vain and if there really is no defence against “imported” world inflation. The author analyses the four types of policy for avoiding inflation - restrictive monetary and fiscal policy, export of capital, periodic changes in exchange parities and flexible exchange rates. The analysis suggests that the first two are least recommendable in the face of chronic balance of payments surpluses because they do not eradicate the surplus itself and can be sustained for only {{a relatively short period of}} time. The latter two do eliminate the <b>external</b> <b>surplus,</b> however, in the face of continuous world inflation, periodic  revaluation does so only temporarily while flexible rates represent a permanent solution.

40|$|This paper {{sketches}} a {{macroeconomic scenario}} for China for 2010 - 20. Our growth accounting exercise finds that, {{with both the}} working population and total factor productivity on course to decelerate, potential GDP growth is likely to moderate in the coming 10 years, despite still sizeable capital deepening. Actual GDP should grow broadly as fast as potential GDP, continuing the track record since the late 1990 s. With some rebalancing expected, the share of consumption in GDP is likely to bottom out and to rise somewhat through 2015 while the share of investment edges down. Robust economic growth in China would support imports. Meanwhile, given the outlook for the world economy, the share of exports in GDP may decline in 2010 - 2015 despite good competitiveness. As a result, the trade surplus may diminish relative {{to the size of}} China’s economy. Even so, the <b>external</b> <b>surplus</b> would continue to rise in US dollar terms, especially the current account. In 2020 China’s GDP per capita would be broadly comparable to the current level in Latin America, Turkey and Malaysia. Adjusted for purchasing power, in 2020 China’s GDP per capita would be one-fourth of the US level and China’s total economy larger than that of the US. The pace of catch up in current prices and market exchange rates will depend on the extent of real exchange rate (RER) appreciation. Past experience internationally suggests that, with a large portion of labor employed in agriculture, RER appreciation may be modest in the coming decade. However, demographic changes may speed up the tightening of the labor market and trend RER appreciation.

40|$|The global {{financial}} crisis and ensuing economic downturn has raised many {{questions concerning the}} future of global economic growth. Prior to the financial crisis, global growth was characterized by growing imbalances, reflected primarily in large trade surpluses in China, Japan, Germany, and the oil exporting countries and rapidly growing deficits, primarily in the United States. The global crisis {{raises the question of}} whether the previous growth model of low consumption, high saving countries such as China is obsolete. Although a strong and rapid policy response beginning in the early fall of 2008 made China the first globally significant economy to come off the bottom and begin to grow more rapidly, critics charged that China's recovery was based on the old growth model, relying primarily on burgeoning investment in the short run and the expectation of a revival of expanding net exports once global recovery gained traction. Critics, however, argued that as government-financed investment inevitably tapered off, the likelihood was that global recovery would not be sufficiently strong for China's exports to resume their former role as a major contributor to China's economic expansion. The prospect, in the eyes of these critics, is that China's growth will inevitably falter. This study examines China's response to the global crisis, the prospects for altering the model of economic growth that dominated the first decade of this century, and the implications for the United States and the global economy of successful Chinese rebalancing. On the first it analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of China's stimulus program. On the second it analyzes the nature of origins of the imbalances in China's economy and the array of policy options that the government has to transition to more consumption-driven growth. On the third successful rebalancing would mean that more rapid growth of consumption would offset the drag on growth from a shrinkage of China's <b>external</b> <b>surplus.</b> Successful rebalancing would mean China would no longer be a source of financing for any ongoing US external deficit. From a global perspective China would no longer be a source of the global economic imbalances that contributed to the recent {{global financial}} crisis and great recession. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{medium-term}} {{outlook for}} Belgium points towards an average GDP {{growth rate of}} 2. 2 % during the 2006 - 2011 period, which is slightly higher than potential (2. 0 %). This pace of growth should follow a slowdown in economic growth in 2005 (1. 5 %) and a rebound in 2006 (2. 4 %). Economic growth in Belgium should remain slightly {{higher than in the}} euro area, on average. Despite moderate wage increases, the average yearly growth rate for private consumption should reach 1. 8 % during the 2006 - 2011 period, in particular because of the increase in household disposable income (stimulated especially by reductions in personal income tax and increases in employment and social benefits). Investment growth should reach 2. 5 % during the 2006 - 2011 period, mainly reflecting the path of business investment growth, but also an acceleration in public investment {{at the end of the}} projection period. Growth in exports should be 5. 4 % on average and the contribution of net exports to GDP growth is expected to be 0. 3 %-points. The <b>external</b> <b>surplus,</b> which was strongly reduced between 2002 and 2005, should increase again after 2007 and attain 3. 2 % of GDP in 2011 (partly as a result of the improvement of the terms of trade). Limited increases in wage costs, the decline in oil prices after 2007 and a negative output gap until the end of the projection period, should allow the inflation rate to remain below 2 % in the medium term. The expected evolution of employment reflects a favourable macroeconomic context, a limited increase in wage costs and various policy measures. After the net creation of approximately 39, 000 and 41, 000 jobs in 2005 and 2006 respectively, about 35, 000 jobs should be created every year during the 2007 - 2011 period. Between 2005 and 2011, industrial employment should fall by 30, 000 persons, but the number of jobs created in market services should exceed 250, 000. Nevertheless, in view of the strong increase in the labour force (mainly in the 50 - 64 age class) the fall in unemployment will be limited to 38, 000 persons. The unemployment rate (broad administrative statistics) should fall from 14. 3 % in 2005 to 13. 1 % in 2011. Under the assumption of constant policy, public accounts are expected to deteriorate markedly, with a net public financing requirement of 0. 3 % of GDP appearing in 2006, widening to 1. 2 % in 2007, before gradually falling to 0. 3 % by the end of the projection period.

40|$|Turbulences' {{check-up}} Département des diagnostics Western economies {{began their}} recovery one year ago, {{but it is}} still difficult to foresee jobs and capacities creations on the near term. National situations exhibit quite varied imprints of indebtedness and disindebtedness waves brought about by the deregulations and monetary policies. Continental Europe, Germany excepted, has achieved the curbing of corporate failures, but persistingly high real interest rates {{stand in the way of}} investment. Money and budget managements have been very upset by the swerves of the private demand. They will become clearer as turbulences move off. In Europe, reducing interest rates will be the only way to alleviate the fiscal austerity. In the United states the buoyant activity will reignite inflation, although an increased response to interest rates, and budget cuts, will check the demand during 1995. Japan is still striving towards slowing his production capacities growth; public support is essential during 1994 to resume a moderate growth. In the United Kigdom, the activity is now heavily dependent on the internal demand, but the covering of the general government needs will limit the financial ressources of the private sector that will find itself short of equipments. Germany has definitely entered the disinflationary process, which allows the lowering of short term interest rates, but corporate accounts are not enough restored to boost investment. Recent tensions on bond yields betray the European subordination to capital markets. Savings are presently more drawn on in the United States, but also by the emerging markets the advance of which is dramatic. Asian dynamism has supported the world trade in 1993, a conflicting period for market shares. Trade developments will be faster (+ 6 % to + 7 % a year) and more balanced during 1994 et 1995. In France the recovery is mostly obvious in business surveys; quantitative data are still scarce to confirm it. As long as the final demand dees not strengthen significantly, inventories bear the bulk of the ongoing adjustment. The economic policy attempts to reconcile several targets : the franc / mark parity, the lowering of interest rates, the support of activity, the checking of public deficits, the curbing of tax and contribution rates. When these targets prove to be inconsistent, the government is induced to get rather pragmatic. In 1994, GDP will grow by 1, 1 %. The internal demand, excluding inventories, would rise somewhat from its depressed level of 1993. A weak increase of private consumption, a recovery of the real estate business and a sustained advance of public investment would go toward starting growth; but the equipment spending by firms would be hardly stabilized, following their strong 1993 fall. In 1995 it would speed up, when inventories are considered satisfactory. GDP growth could then exceed 2, 5 %, as both intenal and external demands would intensify. During both years, exports would increase more than imports. The French growth would thus benefit by the international environment, the domestic components of demand remaining subdued by some disindebtedness. A widening <b>external</b> <b>surplus</b> is forecasted, as well as a shrinking inflation. But the unemployment would keep spreading, this year, and would level off next year. année conflictuelle pour le partage des marchés.

Ces objectifs étant parfois contradictoires, cela a conduit le gouvernement à faire preuve d'un assez grand pragmatisme. En 1994, le PIB progresserait de 1, 1 %. La demande intérieure hors stocks s'élèverait un peu après avoir reculé en 1993. Faible progression de la consommation des ménages, reprise de l'investissement en logements et progression soutenue de l'investissement public contribueraient à amorcer la croissance; mais les dépenses d'équipement des entreprises seraient à peine stabilisées, après leur fort repli de 1993. En 1995, celles-ci s'accéléreraient et l'arrêt du déstockage favoriserait significativement la croissance. Celle-ci pourrait alors dépasser 2, 5 %, les demandes interne et externe s' intensifiant. Chacune des deux années, la progression des exportations excéderait celle des importations. Ainsi, la croissance française serait d'abord portée par son environnement international, investissement et consommation intérieurs restant contraints par des logiques de désendettement. Elle ne se fera donc pas au détriment des soldes extérieurs. Elle ne se fera pas non plus au détriment de l'inflation qui décélérerait à nouveau. En revanche, le chômage continuerait de s'élever cette année et plafonnerait l'an prochain.

We find empirical support to sustainability: the Italian economy used <b>external</b> deficits (<b>surpluses)</b> to smooth aggregate consumption. Persistent current account deficits from 1861 to WW 1 {{seem to have been}} used to prompt the nation's productivity and economic efficiency and so they do not seem to have undermined the nation's intertemporal solvency...|$|R
40|$|A {{few years}} after the {{establishment}} of the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), large asymmetries emerged in the trade balances and the current accounts of the member-states. A divide seems to separate two groups in the euro area, one with the northern countries achieving <b>external</b> <b>surpluses</b> and the other including the southern countries with large external deficits. We argue that a crucial factor in shaping productivity, and consequently affecting competitiveness and the external position of the economy, is the size and composition of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and find that the northern countries received more total FDI than the southern group. Moreover, the southern countries attracted more investment in real estate rather than the productive sector. Focusing on ten euro area economies over the period 1980 - 2009, we establish a positive relationship between FDI flows and trade balances in the northern countries, in contrast to a negative one for the southern group. Using industry-level data, we also establish a positive (negative) long-run relationship between FDI in the manufacturing (non-manufacturing) sector and the trade balance for the northern (southern) countries.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{episodes of}} banking sector distress {{for a large}} sample of developed and developing countries, highlighting the experience of Japan. By a host of criteria, Japan {{appeared to be in}} a stronger position than most countries at the onset of banking problems - low inflation, appreciating currency, balanced government budget, and large <b>external</b> <b>surpluses.</b> However, Japan followed a clear international boom-and-bust pattern in terms of real output growth, credit growth and stock price movements. We estimate a multivariate probit model that links the likelihood of banking problems to a set of macroeconomic variables and institutional characteristics. The model predicts a high probability of banking sector distress in Japan in the early 1990 s. In particular the likelihood of an episode of banking distress rose in line with the sharp drop in asset prices, deepening recession and a "moral hazard' problem (financial liberalization combined with explicit deposit insurance). The Japanese case is also noteworthy by the long duration of the banking crisis, the length of the coincident recession and general malaise over the economy, the slow regulatory response, and the long delay in the commitment of public funds to re-capitalize the banking sector.
