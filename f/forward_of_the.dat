5|$|After {{the first}} salvo from the 15cm {{batteries}} in Drøbak, the steering {{from the bridge}} was disabled. Blücher had just passed Drøbakgrunnen (Drøbak shallows) and was in a turn to port. The commander got her back on track by using the side shafts, but she lost speed. Normally the rudder is controlled electrically from the bridge to the motors <b>forward</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Handsteuerraum (hand steering room) deep under the armored deck, <b>forward</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rudder. In an emergency it can be switched within seconds to manual steering, but orders from the bridge to the rudder may be delayed. At 04:34 Norwegian land-based torpedo batteries scored two hits on the ship. The targeting device in the torpedo battery was very primitive. The speed of the torpedo was known and set, but {{the speed of the}} target had to be adjusted by dead reckoning (guessing).|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to their large compound eyes, wasps have several simple eyes known as ocelli, which are typically arranged in a triangle just <b>forward</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vertex of the head. Wasps possess mandibles adapted for biting and cutting, like those of many other insects, such as grasshoppers, but their other mouthparts are formed into a suctorial proboscis, which enables them to drink nectar.|$|E
5|$|In {{the initial}} design the battery box and air {{reservoirs}} were located <b>forward</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fuel tank; in locomotives manufactured after 1977 these were relocated behind the tank. The battery box {{returned to its}} original location in the F40PH-2. The F40PH-2s delivered to Caltrain incorporated Southern Pacific Railroad-style headlights.|$|E

50|$|Thompson {{has said}} that playing on <b>the</b> big <b>forwards</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> GFL gave him a {{platform}} to build his whole AFL career on.|$|R
50|$|He was {{considered}} one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most promising young Italian <b>forwards</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early 1980s and collected 14 caps and 9 {{goals for the}} Italy national under-21 football team.|$|R
5|$|Most {{noticeable}} of the N3 {{design was}} {{the concentration of}} the main battery <b>forward</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bridge and machinery spaces. A related feature of the design was the tower bridge structure behind the first two gun turrets. This provided a better and more stable foundation for fire-control equipment, greatly improved accommodation and protection from the weather.|$|E
5|$|A five-man crew, {{the first}} pilot, co-pilot, {{navigator}} radar, navigator plotter and air electronics officer (AEO) was accommodated within the pressure cabin on two levels; the pilots sitting on Martin-Baker 3K (3KS on the B.2) ejection seats whilst {{on the lower}} level, the other crew sat facing rearwards and would abandon the aircraft via the entrance door. The original B35/46 specification sought a jettisonable crew compartment, this requirement was removed in a subsequent amendment, the rear crew's escape system was often an issue of controversy, such as when a practical refit scheme was rejected. A rudimentary sixth seat <b>forward</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> navigator radar was provided for an additional crew member; the B.2 had an additional seventh seat opposite the sixth seat and <b>forward</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> AEO. These seats {{were no more than}} cushions, a full harness and an oxygen and intercom facility. The visual bomb-aimer's compartment could be fitted with a T4 (Blue Devil) bombsight, in many B.2s this space housed a vertically mounted Vinten F95 Mk.10 camera for assessing simulated low-level bombing runs.|$|E
5|$|Adding to {{the inner}} {{complexities}} of the picture and creating further visual interactions is the male dwarf in the foreground, whose raised hand echoes the gesture of {{the figure in the}} background, while his playful demeanour, and distraction from the central action, are in complete contrast with it. The informality of his pose, his shadowed profile, and his dark hair all serve to make him a mirror image to the kneeling attendant of the Infanta. However, the painter has set him <b>forward</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> light streaming through the window, and so minimised the contrast of tone on this foreground figure.|$|E
50|$|White was {{regarded}} as one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> best <b>forwards</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1940s. He was fast on the lead, was a strong overhead mark and possessed a long and accurate kick.|$|R

5|$|Dreadnoughts tripod {{foremast}} {{was positioned}} behind the forward funnel {{to allow the}} vertical leg {{to serve as a}} support for the boat-handling derrick. This meant that the hot funnel gases could render the spotting top uninhabitable in conditions of little or no wind. The Bellerophons had the foremast moved <b>forward</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> funnels to reduce the problem in the spotting top and a second tripod mast was added to handle the derrick, but it had to be positioned in front of the aft funnel to do that, which rendered the aft spotting top almost useless as it could be exposed to the exhaust plumes from both funnels under certain circumstances.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} season García recorded a record-breaking tally of 16 {{goals for the}} season, the most ever in a single season by a Real Sociedad player. Her seasonal haul included a notable goal against rivals Athletic and a hat-trick against Levante during December which propelled Txuri-urdin to a fifth-placed finish in the Primera División, the club's highest placing since formation in 2004. Real Sociedad also made the quarter-finals of the Copa de la Reina where they were eliminated 5–1 by eventual runners-up Barcelona, with García netting the only goal of the match for her club. García's form throughout the season saw her nominated for the Primera División <b>forward</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Season award.|$|E
5|$|It was {{the opinion}} of Mearns and White who {{investigated}} the wreck that this was unlikely as the damage was far too limited in scale, nor could it account for the outwardly splayed plates also observed in that area. Bill Jurens points {{out that there was}} no magazine of any kind at the location of the break and that the location of the break just <b>forward</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forward transverse armoured bulkhead suggests that the ship's structure failed there as a result of stresses inflicted when the bow was lifted into the vertical position by the sinking stern section. Furthermore, the current position of the plates {{at the edge of the}} break only reflects their last position, not the direction that they first moved.|$|E
50|$|Although Maddison {{played at}} a time when <b>the</b> loose <b>forwards</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Souths' pack - Coote, Bob McCarthy, Gary Stevens and Paul Sait - {{dominated}} representative selections, he managed his Australian debut at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> a great club season in 1973 when he was selected for the 1973 Kangaroo tour. He was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> form <b>forwards</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tour scoring two tries in the third and deciding Test against Great Britain. He played in all three Ashes Tests, in one Test against France and in nine minor tour matches scoring six tries in all. The following year he made his sole state appearance for New South Wales Blues.|$|R
50|$|W L Oldham became <b>the</b> first <b>of</b> <b>the</b> club’s great <b>forwards</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20th {{century to}} {{represent}} England. Early {{in the century}} the Butts was lost when the professional Northern Union game took brief hold in the city.|$|R
50|$|A balestron rig is a sailplan {{involving}} a boom that extends <b>forwards</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mast and {{is pivoted on}} it. It is a balanced rig. It involves a mainsail and a smaller jib on an unstayed mast.|$|R
5|$|Living {{quarters}} for the senior officers consisted of eight separate well-furnished cabins, each {{provided with a}} small oak table and chair, an oil lamp, shelves and drawers and a canvas floor covering covered with a rug. The entire crew were given goat-skin mats to sleep on. Lighting for each living area was provided by small skylights in the deck above, which were covered by an iron hatch during battle. The officer's wardroom was located <b>forward</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> berth deck where officers would eat their meals, hold meetings or socialize during what little spare time they had. It was well furnished with an oriental rug, a large oak table and other such items. Ericsson had personally paid for the costs of all the officer's furnishings.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, on Hill 677 the Canadians {{had spent}} the night of 23/24 April in their pits {{listening}} to the sounds of the fighting on the Australian front. However, by early morning Chinese activity increased and, with the situation deteriorating on the Patricia's right flank, Stone withdrew B Company from their position <b>forward</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> feature's summit to strengthen this flank if the Australians were forced to withdraw. Under the command of Major Vince Lilley the company subsequently moved to occupy positions east of Battalion Headquarters on the high ground overlooking the valley road.|$|E
5|$|On 25 June 1940, Fraser, {{her sister}} , and the cruiser Calcutta were {{returning}} from St. Jean de Luz after rescuing refugees {{trapped by the}} German Army (Operation Ariel), when Fraser was rammed by Calcutta in the Gironde estuary. Struck <b>forward</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bridge by the cruiser's bow, Fraser was cut in half and sank immediately. All but 45 of the ship's crew were rescued by Restigouche and other nearby ships. Many of the survivors from Fraser transferred that later summer to , and were lost when that vessel sank on 22 October 1940 {{as a result of}} a collision with the freighter MV Port Fairy.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} end of World War I, the number of 50-caliber 76mm guns was reduced to 13, all mounted on the turret tops, and six new 40-caliber 76-millimeter {{anti-aircraft}} (AA) guns were installed abreast the aft funnel. In addition two license-built 2-pounder AA guns were mounted on the forecastle deck abreast 'B' turret. In 1925–26 the foremast was replaced by a tetrapodal mast, which was moved <b>forward</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> funnels, the rangefinders were upgraded, and the ships were equipped to handle a Macchi M.18 seaplane mounted on the center turret. Around that same time, {{one or both of the}} ships was equipped with a fixed aircraft catapult on the port side of the forecastle.|$|E

50|$|Jarman was chosen, {{between the}} 1910 and 1911 Five nations Championship, to join Tommy Smyth's British Isles team to tour South Africa. Jarman played {{in all three}} tests and was rated as one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> best <b>forwards</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> touring side.|$|R
60|$|This desperate fight {{had lasted}} but four hours, but to all engaged it seemed an age.

5|$|The 7th Division was now {{concentrated}} in the coastal sector. Berryman clashed with Brigadier Jack Stevens of the 21st Infantry Brigade over the siting of Berryman's artillery observation posts, which were <b>forward</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> infantry's front lines. Berryman wanted Stevens' positions advanced so as to obtain effective observation of the enemy's lines for Berryman's gunners. Stevens refused, hampering Berryman's efforts to support him in the Battle of Damour. Despite this, Berryman implemented an effective artillery plan. In {{the final stage of}} the battle, Berryman, without authority, ordered Lieutenant Colonel Denzil MacArthur-Onslow of the 2/6th Cavalry Regiment to pursue the retreating French forces, but was overruled by Savige and Allen. For his part in the campaign, Berryman received a third Mention in Despatches.|$|E
5|$|The GR1A and GR4A were {{equipped}} with TIRRS (Tornado Infrared Reconnaissance System), consisting of one SLIR (Sideways Looking Infra Red) sensor {{on each side}} of the fuselage <b>forward</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> engine intakes to capture oblique images, and a single IRLS (InfrarRed LineScan) sensor mounted on the fuselage's underside to provide vertical images. TIRRS recorded images on six S-VHS video tapes. The newer RAPTOR reconnaissance pod has replaced the built-in TIRRS system.|$|E
5|$|The P.1127 lacked any in-built armaments, {{the ethos}} of {{tactical}} flexibility meant a reliance upon underwing hard point-mounted munitions and equipment, which included multiple 2-inch rocket batteries, 30-mm ADEN cannon gun pods, and 1,000 lb bombs, napalm, and range-extending drop tanks. The prototypes were furnished with long nose-mounted instrumentation booms, these were replaced on the Kestrel with a much smaller counterpart on the vertical stabilizer to enable the nose to accommodate a tactical camera instead. An unusual feature of the P.1127 was the installation of a ram air turbine upon the rear fuselage just <b>forward</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vertical stabilizer to provide power for ancillary services {{in the event of}} engine failure.|$|E
30|$|Another {{possibility}} to route messages to a node in another subtree is <b>the</b> <b>forwarding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> messages {{to all the}} other sink nodes (eventually via multi-cast) (Figure 5 b).
