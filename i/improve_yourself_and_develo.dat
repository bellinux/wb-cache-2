30|$|Burnison (2016) {{claim that}} anyone can have the right {{hands-on}} skills, but true leadership finesse lies in the much tougher realm of developing self-awareness to lead yourself first; navigating by a fixed point of personal and organizational purpose; journeying with others who want to follow you; and plotting a course that is beyond the line of sight of what everyone sees. To lead others, you must continually measure yourself - not overestimating your strengths, and not underestimating your weaknesses. To do so, you {{must be able to}} look humbly in the mirror. After all, self-awareness and honesty go hand in hand. Let others illuminate your blind spots as you <b>improve</b> <b>yourself</b> <b>and,</b> by extension, the organization.|$|R

I mean to go for a sailor myself if I can, and I shall be glad to have you as a chum on board. We have always been great friends, and I am sure we always shall be, Tommy. If I were you I would think it over a good many times before you decide upon it. You see I have learnt a great deal from books to prepare myself for a sea life. Miss Warden is going to try to get me taken as an apprentice, and in that case I may hope to get to be an officer when my time is out, but you would not have much chance of doing so. Of course if we were {{together}} I could help you on. So far you have never cared for books or to <b>improve</b> <b>yourself,</b> <b>and</b> without that you can never rise to be any more than a common sailor.” ...|$|R
6000|$|We {{arrived in}} London the 24th of December, 1724. I waited upon the stationer, who came first in my way, {{delivering}} the letter as from Governor Keith. [...] "I don't know such a person," [...] says he; but, opening the letter, [...] "Oh! {{this is from}} Riddlesden. I have lately {{found him to be}} a complete rascal, and I will {{have nothing to do with}} him, nor receive any letters from him." [...] So, putting the letter into my hand, he turned on his heel and left me, to serve some customer. I was surprised to find these were not the governor's letters; and, after recollecting and comparing circumstances, I began to doubt his sincerity. I found my friend Denham, and opened the whole affair to him. He let me into Keith's character; told me there was not the least probability that he had written any letters for me; that no one who knew him had the smallest dependence on him; and he laughed at the notion of the governor's giving me a letter of credit, having, as he said, no credit to give. On my expressing some concern about what I should do, he advised me to endeavor getting some employment in the way of my business.

6000|$|When we {{came into}} the Channel, the captain kept his word with me, and gave me an {{opportunity}} of examining the bag for the governor's letters. I found none upon which my name was put as under my care. I picked out six or seven, that, by the handwriting, I thought might be the promised letters, especially as one of them was directed to Basket, the king's printer, and another to some stationer. We arriv'd in London the 24th of December, 1724. I waited upon the stationer, who came first in my way, delivering the letter as from Governor Keith.

40|$|The current thesis {{describes}} {{a number of}} educational problems which arise in asynchronous distance education, such as discontinuity of educational sessions or lack of effective student supervising, and explores how such problems may be addressed {{by the use of}} Student Models. A number of typical examples of Student Models that have been developed are reviewed, in order to indicate the uses and the achievements of Student Models in education. The question of how Student Models could potentially be useful in asynchronous distance education is discussed, in addition to criteria for testing the applicability of such models. Furthermore, the pilot implementation of a student model called See <b>Yourself</b> <b>Improve</b> (SYIM) <b>and</b> the application of this model to a real asynchronous distance education session as a field test is described. The thesis closes with an evaluation of the feedback provided by the field test participants, and the modifications/recommendations for further improvement of the SYIM model...|$|R
