5|$|Vanadium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol V and atomic number 23. It is a hard, silvery grey, ductile, and malleable transition metal.

5|$|Barium is a {{chemical}} element with symbolBa and atomic number56. It {{is the fifth}} element in group 2 and is a soft, silvery alkaline earth metal. Because of its high chemical reactivity, barium is never <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>nature</b> as a free element. Its hydroxide, known in pre-modern history as baryta, does not occur as a mineral, but can be prepared by heating barium carbonate.|$|E
5|$|Because {{strontium}} is {{so similar}} to calcium, it {{is incorporated in}} the bone. All four stable isotopes are incorporated, in roughly the same proportions they are <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>nature.</b> However, the actual distribution of the isotopes tends to vary greatly from one geographical location to another. Thus, analyzing the bone of an individual can help determine the region it came from. This approach helps to identify the ancient migration patterns and the origin of commingled human remains in battlefield burial sites.|$|E
40|$|This thessis {{deals with}} {{assessment}} of the actual state of an herb layer and regeneration <b>in</b> <b>nature</b> preservations Coufavá and Slunná. Both of nature preservations were affected large-scale wind disturbances. The survey was conducted in June and July 2013. There were totally performed 384 phytosocenological releves (162 <b>in</b> <b>nature</b> preserve Coufavá and 222 <b>in</b> <b>nature</b> preserve Slunná). Research was carried out on a regular grid 15 × 15 meters. There were 254 juvenile trees which were <b>founded</b> <b>in</b> <b>nature</b> preserve Coufavá and also 1891 juvenile trees were <b>founded</b> <b>in</b> <b>nature</b> preserve Slunná. <b>In</b> both of preservations browse didn't rise up 10 % from all regeneration. Most abundant tree species <b>in</b> <b>nature</b> preserve Coufavá were Fagus sylvatica. <b>In</b> <b>nature</b> preserve Slunná were most abundant Tilia sp. Strong clonal species dominated in disturbed desktop non-wood undergrowth in both of studied areas. In closed stand dominated typical forest species. Impatiens parviflora has abundant occurrence in both of biotopes. For both nature preserves was estimated future development and propose of solutions.

Quinoline Yellow (E104) is a commonly used coloring in the United Kingdom but is banned in Australia, Japan, Norway and the United States.

5|$|All {{elements}} from atomic numbers 1 (hydrogen) to 118 (oganesson) {{have been discovered}} or synthesized, with the most recent additions (nihonium, moscovium, tennessine, and oganesson) being confirmed by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) in 2015 and officially named in 2016: they complete the first seven rows of the periodic table. The first 94 elements exist naturally, although some are found only in trace amounts and were synthesized in laboratories before being <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>nature.</b> Elements with atomic numbers from 95 to 118 have only been synthesized in laboratories or nuclear reactors.

5|$|Boron is <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>nature</b> on Earth entirely {{as various}} oxides of B(III), often {{associated}} with other elements. More than one hundred borate minerals contain boron in oxidation state +3. These minerals resemble silicates in some respect, although boron is often found not only in a tetrahedral coordination with oxygen, but also in a trigonal planar configuration. Unlike silicates, the boron minerals never contain boron with coordination number greater than four. A typical motif is exemplified by the tetraborate anions of the common mineral borax, shown at left. The formal negative charge of the tetrahedral borate center is balanced by metal cations in the minerals, such as the sodium (Na+) in borax.|$|E
