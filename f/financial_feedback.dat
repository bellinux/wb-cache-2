50|$|The {{link between}} the real economy and {{financial}} markets stems from firms’ need for external finance to engage in physical investment opportunities. Firms’ ability to borrow depends essentially on {{the market value of}} their net worth. The reason for this is asymmetric information between lenders and borrowers. Lenders are likely to have little information about the reliability of any given borrower. As such, they usually require borrowers to set forth their ability to repay, often in the form of collateralized assets. It follows that a fall in asset prices deteriorates the balance sheets of the firms and their net worth. The resulting deterioration of their ability to borrow has a negative impact on their investment. Decreased economic activity further cuts the asset prices down, which leads to a feedback cycle of falling asset prices, deteriorating balance sheets, tightening financing conditions and declining economic activity. This vicious cycle is called a financial accelerator. It is a <b>financial</b> <b>feedback</b> loop or a loan/credit cycle, which, starting from a small change in financial markets, is, in principle, able to produce a large change in economic conditions.|$|E

40|$|The {{barriers}} to reduction of energy consumption include: {{a lack of}} {{public awareness of the}} importance of the problem, positive association of the level of consumption with social status, and a lack of sufficient feedback between the amount of energy consumed and the costs of it. The authors distinguish and discuss 3 groups of factors impeding reduction of energy consumption. These are: (1) a lack of appreciation (by the users) of indirect negative consequences of an increase in energy consumption on a global scale; (2) a positive association of the level of consumption in general (and consequently, the amount of energy consumed) with social status; (3) a lack of efficient cognitive and <b>financial</b> <b>feedback</b> concerning the amount of electrical energy consumed, resulting from the specific nature of this product.

40|$|Background: E-waste {{constitutes}} an increasing problem {{due to its}} growing amount and its hazardous substances content, and stands diametrically opposed to an increasing resource scarcity. In response, the EU introduced the WEEE Directive, which embraces the market-based policy principle of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR). EPR requires electronics manufacturers to take their products back and organise proper end-of-life management. The assumption that this would promote eco-design practices, as manufacturers {{have an incentive to}} design products that are easier to treat and recycle, is contested in the academic literature. Particular disagreement concerns the question if producers have to fulfil their responsibility individually or may also choose a collective approach. Method: This thesis aims to enrich the discussion of EPR by empirical insights from in the ICT sector. To this end, six producers were examined through a qualitative multiple case study approach: Dell, HP, LG, Nokia, Philips, and Sony. The case studies are largely based on expert interviews with company representatives; additional information was gathered from company websites, annual and CSR reports, white papers, available case studies and NGO reports. Results: The examined producers adopt different approaches of EPR compliance. While all producers rely on collective systems, some run additional individual schemes in order to gain competitive edge. Three feedback loops from end-of-life management to the production phase are identified, by which EPR can potentially influence eco-design. Informational feedback is found to have the strongest influence, followed by <b>financial</b> <b>feedback.</b> Material feedback loops are hardly established, which suggests that EPR does not contribute significantly to the closure of material loops. Furthermore, seven eco-design strategies with end-of-life relevance are identified. The examined producers are particularly active with regards to conducting measures that reduce the waste treatment costs, as well as increasing their use of recycled materials. Strategies to reduce the volume of WEEE are conducted by half of the sample, and strategies that promise {{to increase the amount of}} recovered materials are the least relevant. Conclusions: The findings of this thesis suggest that EPR, as implemented in the WEEE Directive, positively affects eco-design. Next to the identified feedback loops, EPR promotes eco-design through several mediate effects. The principle has raised awareness of the e-waste problem and contributed to a shifting mindset among ICT producers...|$|E
40|$|The {{history of}} flower-plant (F-P) {{cultivation}} in China can be mainly {{divided into three}} periods: in 1980 s, it existed with the style of small workshops with traditional planting skills, little scale, limited species and dispersed management. From 1991 to 1997, experienced the transforming from planned economy to market economy, this cultivation became basically suitable for industrial management. After 1998, {{it has been in}} the primary stage of management industrialization with sharply increased cultivation scale and species. China is in urbanization process and the market demand for F-P is huge and long lasting. The global F-P product demand is with big potential as well. Attracted by the huge market, plenty of districts over China start ornamental plants cultivation and till 2010, the national planting area came up to 918, 000 ha from 70, 000 ha in 1998 and sales value up to 86. 21 billion Yuan from 9. 9 billion in 1998. The output value also increased to 0. 46 billion US$ from 3. 2 million US$. However, though F-P cultivation industry has brought much more economic benefits and job opportunities to local farmers than before and increased the regional greening coverage and beautified the environment, there are environmental problems emerging or being reported especially in the cultivation process which seems not to be sustainable. Firstly, with most farmers holding the misunderstanding that "more fertilizer and pesticide equals higher land productivity", widely existed over-usage of chemical fertilizer and pesticide in cultivation (much more than in crops cultivation) are causing farmland soil and nearby water pollution seriously. Secondly, unlike traditional agriculture, it usually takes away a lot of land top-soil for distribution directly leading soil fertility decrease after years. So with the hypothesis that "bringing rapid economic and societal development, F-P cultivation is threatening rural environment", this research want to confirm and evaluate the impacts caused by F-P cultivation on rural environment mainly on soil and surface water. Wujin, honored with "Chinese Flowers & Plants Township" with more than 20 years flowers and plants planting history, was chosen as a typical case study area. Based on the DPSIR framework as logistic research guidance, we combined interview and structured questionnaire survey and field survey in order to figure out the driver, pressure, state, impacts of F-P cultivation, and then, based on the results, propose the well-targeted recommendations. We face to face distributed more than 100 questionnaires to local farmers in traditional moving market and received 100 replies. Then, according to responders'distribution map, we chose two sites (JiaZe and HuangLi town) for field work and finally collected 18 top-soil samples in 20 cm depth from F-P cultivated farmland (3 groups: control, > 10 years, and < 5 years) and 6 surface water samples from nearby-farmland stable water courses for analysis. The top-soil loss field survey was conducted on the main tree species in Wujin, which was divided into 3 categories (seedling, spherical shaped and up-growing trees) by us according to their separate calculating methods of top-soil loss. According to the results of this research, the findings were as follows: 1) The low education level and no longer young are the internal limitations and the higher income from F-P than crops is the main external driver for the farmers to transfer to F-P from traditional agriculture cultivation; 2) The cultivation methods for farmers are mainly by self-learning and large chemical fertilizer usage (average 1623 Kg/ha/year) and low organic fertilizer usage (36 % not use) is widely existed. Also the popular groundwater for irrigation (64 % using) is a new finding; 3) Usually the popular container seedlings of trees with a quicker <b>financial</b> <b>feedback</b> are taking away a larger amount of top-soil per km 2 and cause more serious soil fertility decrease than the up-growing and spherical trees. In addition, a linear relationship is expected and proved between tree's DBH (x) and soil ball's diameter (y) in up-growing trees (y = 4. 5685 x, R 2 = 0. 8526). Also an exponential relationship was found between each up-growing tree's age (x) and the yearly per unit amount of top-soil loss (y) (y = 14. 219 e- 0. 092 x, R 2 = 0. 8747). So generally, according to the equation, the yearly top-soil loss situation by trees of different aged common specie in up-growing category can be predicted in a certain extent; 4) The surface water has very serious eutrophication problem after evaluation (100 % hyper eutrophication). The obvious soil acidification tendency (pH 0. 27 - 0. 3 decrease) and TOC decreasing problem (2 - 3. 6 g/Kg decrease) caused by F-P cultivation is also proved. The large amount of ground water for irrigation in F-P cultivation may lead to big possibility of land subsidence in rural area which needs more attention from the public and the government. In reality, without external intervention to the farmers, if there is profit, there is cultivation. So, if the farmers continue to cultivate F-P and sell top-soil in current way, the vicious circle will be caused until the farmland fertility and safety is totally ruined. Then the rural economic development and society stability will break up. Currently the negative impacts caused by F-P cultivation haven not been paid enough attention to by academia, government and farmers. So we hope, through scientific data and logistic story, this research can somehow make contribution directly to stakeholders'better understanding and realization of F-P cultivation in a sustainable way. 報告番号:; 学位授与年月日: 2012 - 09 - 27; 学位の種別: 修士; 学位の種類: 修士(サステイナビリティ学); 学位記番号: 修創域第 4519 号; 研究科・専攻: 新領域創成科学研究科環境学研究系サステイナビリティ学教育プログラ...|$|E
50|$|At the {{organizational}} level, internal control objectives {{relate to the}} reliability of <b>financial</b> reporting, timely <b>feedback</b> on the achievement of operational or strategic goals, and compliance with laws and regulations. At the specific transaction level, internal control refers to the actions taken to achieve a specific objective (e.g., how to ensure the organization's payments to third parties are for valid services rendered.) Internal control procedures reduce process variation, leading to more predictable outcomes. Internal control {{is a key element}} of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) of 1977 and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which required improvements in internal control in United States public corporations. Internal controls within business entities are also referred to as operational controls.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the dynamics of}} international portfolios with a unique data set on the stock allocations of approximately 6, 500 international equity funds domiciled in four different currency areas. The disaggregated data structure allows us to examine whether fluctuations in foreign exchange and equity risk of a portfolio due to realized returns on financial assets trigger rebalancing behavior at the fund and stock level. The data provide strong support for portfolio rebalancing behavior aimed at reducing both exchange rate risk and equity risk exposure. We also provide a simple model of rebalancing compatible with those facts. Sylvain Champonnois provided excellent research assistance. We are very grateful to the Fondation Banque de France and especially Henri Pagès for <b>financial</b> support and <b>feedback.</b> We also benefited greatly from comments by Paolo Mauro, Ja...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to empirically analyze the influence of the financial crisis on the investment behavior of sovereign wealth funds (SWFs). Design/methodology/approach: Using 615 deals from 20 SWFs, a series of research are designed and conducted to compare the SWFs' governance, external environment, investment strategy and <b>financial</b> markets' <b>feedback</b> around the crisis. Findings: The paper finds that the recent financial crisis did not only bring SWFs heavy losses and the pressure to improve its image and governance structure, but also a precious opportunity of a better external environment by easing the nerves of the recipient country's government. Their investment strategies will be more positive, diversified and complementary to their own real economy. The event studies illustrate that financial markets turn to be more effective after the crisis. The market reaction to SWF's investment tends to mitigate speculative trading to a larger extent, which is shown by the lower cumulative abnormal return and turnover volatility. Originality/value: This paper tries to test the change of SWFs' behavior pro‐ and post‐crisis. It reveals that SWFs have changed their effects on SWF's home country, SWF's host country, the financial market and the real economy after the financial crisis, which is helpful for government and institutions to maintain the stability of the national economy and security market...|$|R
