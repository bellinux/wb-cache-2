25|$|Most often, {{magnetic}} wire {{is composed of}} fully annealed, electrolytically refined copper to allow closer winding when making <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>coils.</b> The wire is coated {{with a range of}} polymeric insulations, including varnish, rather than the thicker plastic or other types of insulation commonly used on electrical wire. High-purity oxygen-free copper grades are used for high-temperature applications in reducing atmospheres or in motors or generators cooled by hydrogen gas.|$|E
25|$|The {{lenses of}} a TEM allow for beam {{convergence}}, with {{the angle of}} convergence as a variable parameter, giving the TEM the ability to change magnification simply by modifying the amount of current that flows through the coil, quadrupole or hexapole lenses. The quadrupole lens is an arrangement of <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>coils</b> at the vertices of the square, enabling the generation of a lensing magnetic fields, the hexapole configuration simply enhances the lens symmetry by using six, rather than four coils.|$|E

25|$|Electron lenses are {{designed}} {{to act in a}} manner emulating that of an optical lens, by focusing parallel electrons at some constant focal distance. Electron lenses may operate electrostatically or magnetically. The majority of electron lenses for TEM use <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>coils</b> to generate a convex lens. The field produced for the lens must be radially symmetrical, as deviation from the radial symmetry of the magnetic lens causes aberrations such as astigmatism, and worsens spherical and chromatic aberration. Electron lenses are manufactured from iron, iron-cobalt or nickel cobalt alloys, such as permalloy. These are selected for their magnetic properties, such as magnetic saturation, hysteresis and permeability.|$|E
500|$|The Cooke and Wheatstone {{telegraph}} was {{an early}} electrical telegraph system dating from the 1830s invented by English inventor William Fothergill Cooke and English scientist Charles Wheatstone. [...] It was the first telegraph system {{to be put into}} commercial service. [...] The receiver consisted of a number of needles which could be moved by <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>coils</b> to point to letters on a board. [...] This feature was liked by early users who were unwilling to learn codes, and employers {{who did not want to}} invest in staff training.|$|E
2500|$|In 1827, Hungarian {{physicist}} √Ånyos Jedlik started {{experimenting with}} <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>coils.</b> After Jedlik solved the technical {{problems of the}} continuous rotation with {{the invention of the}} commutator, he called his early devices [...] "electromagnetic self-rotors". Although they were used only for instructional purposes, in 1828 Jedlik demonstrated the first device to contain the three main components of practical DC motors: the stator, rotor and commutator. The device employed no permanent magnets, as the magnetic fields of both the stationary and revolving components were produced solely by the currents flowing through their windings.|$|E

40|$|An <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>coil</b> {{gun with}} three stages of {{accelerating}} coils is designed and built. Conventional projectile propulsion mechanisms {{include the use}} of compressed air/spring or explosion which places theoretical limits on the maximum muzzle velocity governed by laws of thermodynamics. The <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>coil</b> gun, on the other hand, explores the use of electromagnetism in accelerating projectiles which offers a much higher theoretical limit on muzzle velocity. One attractive feature of an electromagnetic acceleration system that cannot be provided by conventional propulsion systems is that acceleration can be provided to a projectile in different stages as it moves along a barrel, where conventional propulsion system can only provide one burst of impulse at triggering...|$|R
50|$|The current {{application}} of MagneRide {{is the third}} generation. The first generation was created by Delphi Corporation and debuted on the Cadillac Seville STS.

The vacuum vessel is made of Pyrex glass and is 80 cm long and 40 cm in diameter. The <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>coils</b> can produce up to 230 Gauss (0.023 Tesla) magnetic fields center of the vacuum vessel. Another electromagnetic coil running through the axis of the vacuum vessel can produce the magnetic field necessary to make the apparatus a spherical tokamak.

Each disk has a given number of smooth bumps at the rim; these generate a specific frequency as the disk rotates close to a pickup assembly that {{consists of a}} magnet and <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>coil.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{magnetic}} {{direct energy}} converter {{is analogous to}} the internal combustion engine. As the hot plasma expands against a magnetic field, {{in a manner similar to}} hot gases expanding against a piston, part of the energy of the internal plasma is inductively converted to an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>coil,</b> as an EMF (voltage) in the conductor.|$|R
5000|$|Coil noise is, as {{its name}} suggests, caused by <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>coils.</b> These coils, which may act as {{inductors}} or transformers, have a certain resonant frequency when coupled {{with the rest of}} the electric circuit, as well as a resonance at which it will tend to physically vibrate.|$|E
50|$|A {{magnetic}} lens typically consists of several electromagnets {{arranged in a}} quadrupole (see quadrupole magnet), sextupole, or higher format; the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>coils</b> are placed at the vertices of a square or another regular polygon.

50|$|The SDCA {{enables the}} {{pico-satellite}} by using sensors {{to determine its}} attitude, calculate the correction required to achieve the desired orientation and execute the necessary maneuvers using the actuators. The attitude determination system will use magnetometers, sun sensors and attitude determination algorithms for estimating positions and angular velocities. Using GPS and gyroscopes as sensors for determining attitude will also be evaluated. The attitude control system will use <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>coils</b> and permanent magnets as actuators, forming {{what are known as}} magnetorquers. The <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>coils</b> are especially important for the stabilization of the pico-satellite once it leaves the deployer. The inclusion of the permanent magnet can have a system of active-passive control. More than one control law will be studied for possible implementation. The use of magnetic materials and hysteretic also be evaluated.|$|E

They measured the stability boundaries of this mode, and found that an additional <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>coil</b> around {{the middle of the}} machine pinched the FRC into two separate pieces, mitigating the tilt mode.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} these hearing aids {{is to improve the}} {{quantity}} and quality of amplification of the sound wave. Their operating principle is based on the existence of a transducer which transforms the electric signal captured by the microphone into a mechanical, vibrating wave. This transducer can act either directly on the temporal bone by short-circuiting the middle ear (and is then called a bone conduction implant) or directly on the ossicular chain (in which case it is called an ossicular transduction implant). A) There are 2 types of bone conduction implant: the "Audiant Bone Conduction" system of Hough-Vernon (Xomed), where an outside <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>coil</b> sends signals transcutaneously to a magnetic screw embedded on the temporal bone. Bone conduction must be normal. The "Bone Anchored Hearing Aid" (Nobelpharma) where the outside <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>coil</b> sends signals directly to the magnetic screw that is percutaneous. The mean thresholds in bone conduction can reach up to 45 dB. The drawbacks of this system lie in its inaesthetic appearance and the risk of infection. B) With ossicular transduction implants, the transducer may be: either an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>coil</b> influencing a magnet fixed to the tympanum, on the ossicular chain, or replacing an element of the ossicular chain (these hearing aids are marketed by Richards); or a piezo-electric crystal which produces vibrations when it is subjected to an AC current, and which can be positioned on the stapes (Yanagihara). This system consumes less energy, gives excellent results for the high frequencies, but is more cumbersome...|$|R
50|$|A bifilar <b>coil</b> is an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>coil</b> that {{contains}} two closely spaced, parallel windings. In engineering, the word bifilar describes wire {{which is made}} of two filaments or strands. It is commonly used to denote special types of winding wire for transformers. Wire can be purchased in bifilar form, usually as different colored enameled wire bonded together. For three strands, the term trifilar coil is used.|$|R
