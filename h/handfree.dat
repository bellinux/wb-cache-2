40|$|A 0. 5 m 3 V CMOS mixed-mode audio {{processor}} is presented. It is mainly composed of eleven low noise input channels and a dedicated digital {{audio processor}}. Analog input signals are provided through an eleven microphone array. The chip size is about 50 mm 2 {{and the power}} dissipation is less than 100 mW. This circuit is dedicated to multimediaapplications. System environment In teleconference systems and <b>handfree</b> telephone sets {{as well as in}} multimedia workstations with audio interfaces, picked up speech signals are disturbed by the acoustic environment (room effect and ambient noise). The microphone array has been demonstrated as an efficient technique to improve the speech quality in various applications { 1 }. In a microphone array, the signals picked up by the several sensors are combined such that the useful signals are coherently summed and therefore enhanced with respect to the disturbing signals. Previous studies { 2 } have shown the improvement in the speech quality obtained [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new method for one channel {{noise suppression system}} which overcomes the typical disadvantage of one channel noise suppression algorithms - the impossibility of noise estimation during speech sequence. Our method is the combination of Wiener filtering and spectral subtraction. The noise can be successfully updated even during the speech sequences {{and that is why}} there is no need of the voice activity detector. 1 INTRODUCTION The spectral subtraction offers the simple and computationally efficient tool for the suppression of an additive noise in a speech signal. This method has been extensively studied for almost twenty years. The research has been focused on higher degree of noise suppression, lower speech distortion, and less audible musical noise. The last requirement is important especially in the <b>handfree</b> telephony application. But the main shortcoming of this method has not been overcome for a long time. It is the updating of the background noise characteris [...] ...|$|E
