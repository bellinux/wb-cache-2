500|$|In 1917, the Bolsheviks rose {{to power}} in Russia in the October Revolution. After over two years of fragile independence, Armenia fell to Soviet rule in late 1920. Georgia was also Sovietized {{by the spring of}} 1921. Both {{countries}} formally became part of the Soviet Union in December 1922. Khachaturian later wrote that [...] "the October Revolution fundamentally changed my whole life and, if I have really grown into a serious artist, then <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>indebted</b> only to the people and the Soviet Government. To this people is dedicated my entire conscious life, as is all my creative work." [...] Khachaturian always remained enthusiastic about communism, and was an atheist. When asked about his visit to the Vatican, Khachaturian responded: [...] "I'm an atheist, but I'm a son of the [...] people who were the first to officially adopt Christianity and thus visiting the Vatican was my duty." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Marshalls {{had long}} before decided that John {{was to be}} a lawyer. William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England had been {{published}} in America and Thomas Marshall bought a copy for his own use and for John to read and study. After John returned home from Campbell's academy he continued his studies with no other aid than his dictionary. John's father superintended the English part of his education. Marshall wrote of his father, [...] "... and to his care <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>indebted</b> for anything valuable which I may have acquired in my youth. He was my only intelligent companion; and was both a watchful parent and an affectionate friend".|$|E
2500|$|In his will, Wythe {{left his}} large book {{collection}} to Thomas Jefferson. This {{was part of}} the collection which Jefferson later sold to create the Library of Congress. Jefferson praised Wythe as [...] "my ancient master, my earliest and best friend, and to him <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>indebted</b> for first impressions which have [...] the most salutary on the course of my life." [...] However, Jefferson later refused an offer of Wythe's lecture notes and other legal papers, believing they should go instead to what became the Library of Virginia. Last reported either in the possession of Spencer Roane (who burned many papers before his own death) or his ally Thomas Ritchie (publisher of the Richmond Enquirer), they were reported lost by the 1830s.|$|E
