40|$|There is {{considerable}} {{evidence that the}} level of cerebral serotonin {{plays a key role in}} the volitional consumption of ethanol in both man and animals. Naive alcohol-preferring C 57 BL/ 6 J mice have been shown to have a lower cerebral serotonin content compared to the non-preferring CBA/Ca mouse strain. This has been attributed to the enhancement of hepatic tryptophan pyrrolase activity in C 57 mice. Activity and/or expression of tryptophan pyrrolase may be an important biological determinant of alcohol preference. We have investigated the possible mechanism/s underlying this strain difference in tryptophan pyrrolase activity by assaying both mRNA levels encoding for the tryptophan pyrrolase gene and by mutational analysis of tryptophan pyrrolase cDNA. We were unable to demonstrate any difference in tryptophan pyrrolase mRNA levels between naive C 57 and CBA mice.

40|$|AbstractIt is now {{recognised}} that mixed viral infection, or {{infection of}} an individual with two or more distinct strains of a single viral species, often occurs particularly with RNA viruses. Current methods for detection of mixed infection normally involve genotyping or cloning and DNA sequencing. These methods are not always accurate or sensitive at detecting mixed infection and cannot be used for large numbers of samples. Furthermore subsequent sequence determination of the coinfecting viruses is labour intensive. This paper describes a simple, generic method based upon PCR and <b>heteroduplex</b> mobility <b>analysis</b> (HMA) {{that can be used}} to rapidly determine mixed infection with two strains of the same virus. The utility of this method is illustrated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and TT virus (TTV) as examples.

Patients and Methods:Surgically resected 101 paired primary NSCLC and metastatic lymph nodes were evaluated for the EGFR mutations by direct DNA sequencing and <b>heteroduplex</b> <b>analysis.</b> Results:EGFR mutation was detected in 29. 7 % (30 of 101) of the primary tumors and in 27. 7 % of lymph node metastases (28 of 101) by either direct sequencing or <b>heteroduplex</b> <b>analysis,</b> respectively.

40|$|In recent {{theories}} {{concerning the}} pathogenesis of essential hypertension, altered calcium homeostasis plays an important role. Increased intracellular Ca(2 +) levels have repeatedly been reported in different cell types of hypertensive subjects. In vascular smooth muscle cells the plasma membrane Ca(2 +) -ATPase (PMCA) represents the most important Ca(2 +) -ejection system. Modifications of this pump therefore have been assumed to increase contractile tone of small vessels. For this reason, {{the purpose of this}} study was to determine if genetic alterations in the hPMCA 1 gene might be associated with arterial hypertension. For detection of polymorphisms all 22 PMCA 1 exons from 44 patients with essential hypertension (based on rigorous clinical data in addition to a positive family history) and from 40 normotensives without a family history of hypertension were PCR amplified and subsequently subjected to combined single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and <b>heteroduplex</b> (HTX) <b>analysis.</b> Despite the high sensitivity of almost 100 %, differences could not be identified between hypertensives and normotensives within the two groups.

We analyzed 62 B-cell lymphomas (33 follicular and 29 nonfollicular) and 16 reactive lymph nodes. Chip-based electrophoresis was conclusive for monoclonality in 59 / 62 samples; for 20 samples, it was compared with GeneScan analysis. Concordant results were obtained in 45 / 55 IGH (FR 1, FR 2, and FR 3) gene rearrangements, and in 34 / 37 IGK gene rearrangements. However, when the chip device was used to analyze selected IGK gene rearrangements (biallelic IGK rearrangements or IGK rearrangements in a polyclonal background), its performance was not completely accurate.
