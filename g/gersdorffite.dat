40|$|SUMMARY. Data are {{presented}} from cobaltite (CoAsS), <b>gersdorffite</b> (NiAsS), and ullmannite (NiSbS) for cell size, compositional zoning, mineralogical ssociation, X-ray diffraction powder intensities, and optical anisotropy. The presence of powder X-ray diffraction reflections 00 t and 011 {{are related to}} the crystal structure type. The amount of distortion from cubic symmetry is related to the ooI reflection intensity and also to the optical anisotropism strength. These properties are related approxi-mately to the thermal stability of the distorted crystal structure. This thermal stability increases with the substitution of cobalt for nickel, which decreases the cell size. An order-disorder change occurs before the distortion release in non-cubic <b>gersdorffite</b> (PI) with a large cell size, whereas only a dis-tortion release is observed in cobaltite (Pca 20 and non-cubic <b>gersdorffite</b> (PI) with a small cell size.

This structure has the sulphur and arsenic atoms equally distributed over the non-metal atom sites of pyrite.

40|$|The Atrevida vein {{is located}} at the {{south-western}} edge of the Catalonian Coastal Ranges, Spain. This vein extends for more than 3 km and is hosted by Silurian and Carboniferous metasediments, late Hercynian granites and continental conglomerates of Lower Triassic age. The Silurian metasediments contain massive sulphide layers with disseminations of platinum-group element (PGE) -bearing, Fe-Ni arsenides. Vein filling largely consists of banded and brecciated baryte rimmed by a complex polymetallic assemblage of Co-Ni-As-Bi-Ag(-U) ores. The Ni arsenide and sulpharsenide assemblage occurs only where the vein cuts the sulphide-bearing Silurian metasediments, and consists of nickeline, maucherite, rammelsbergite, <b>gersdorffite</b> and Ni-skutterudite. These Ni arsenides and sulpharsenides display rosettes, spherules, colloform and botryoidal textures, as well as subhedral crystals. The chemical compositions of these arsenide-sulpharsenide minerals exhibit limited cation substitution but substantial anion substitution of As by S and Sb, exceeding the expected theoretical values at low temperatures. This suggests that most of them formed under disequilibrium conditions. Ni arsenides and sulpharsenides also contain trace PGE. Palladium (up to 157 ppm) is the most abundant PGE, and occurs in solid-solution in all the phases studied, but shows the highest values in rammelsbergite and Niskutterudite. Pt only occurs in massive nickeline (54 - 1338 ppm Pt) and in zoned <b>gersdorffite</b> (29 - 360 ppm Pt) formed {{at the end of the}} depositional sequence of arsenides. The Ni arsenide and sulpharsenide ores at the Atrevida mine formed by reduction of PGE-bearing, oxidizing fluids at temperatures close to, or slightly above 100 °C. These oxidizing fluids most probably collected their PGE budget from the nearby mineralized black shales. During the crystallization of the veined, Ni arsenide and sulpharsenide ores, Pd partly concentrated in the early nickeline and maucherite, but mainly fractionated to the late solutions from which rammelsbergite and Ni-skutterudite precipitated.

Early sulfidic and phosphatic nodules and host matrix have been lithified, somewhat fractured, and then mineralized with later-stage sulfides and sulfarsenides. <b>Gersdorffite,</b> millerite, polydymite, pyrite, sphalerite, chalcopyrite, galena, and clausthalite have been recognized. EMPA data are given for the major phases. Pyrite trace-element distributions and coeval Ni-, As-sulfides indicate that in the main ore layer, the last sulfide deposition was Ni-As-Co-rich.

Among the sulfosalts of these systems tetrahedrite (Cu 12 +xSb 4 +yS 13, where 0 < x < 1. 92 and - 0. 02 < y < 0. 27) and tennantite (Cu 12 +xAs 4 +yS 13, where 0 < x < 1. 72 and 0 < y < 0. 08) are reported to be the most stable relative to other sulfosalts and certain other sulfide phases, which accounts for their common occurrence in a variety of mineral ore deposits. Natural tetrahedrite and tennantite in equilibrium with other minerals commonly constitute other chemical elements as a substitution for Cu, As and Sb and both are described by the general formula:(Cu, Ag) 10 (Fe, Zn, Cu, Hg, Cd, Co, Au) 2 (Sb, As) 4 S 13. According to the literature data the Ni-based systems comprise a single stoichiometric ternary stable phase for their respective impurities (<b>gersdorffite,</b> NiAsS, and ullmannite, NiSbS), and both experience a wide solid solubility range.

Native gold is argentian (Agdollarlcub 22 rcubdollar-Agdollarlcub 32 rcubdollar), and most Ag-rich in pegmatite-hosted samples. Testibiopalladite compositions straddle the previously inferred miscibility gap with michenerite. The unnamed PGM has a composition of (Pd,Ni) dollarlcub 0. 44 rcubdollar(Te,Sb) dollarlcub 0. 56 rcubdollar, and is distinctly anisotropic. Sporadic, minor amounts of PGEs are present in <b>gersdorffite</b> and nickeline.;All ore types are associated with a pervasive hydrothermal alteration event that post-dates the regional amphibolite facies metamorphism (presently constrained around 600 - 700 dollar∘dollarC and 6 - 7 kbar).

The sulfide-mineralized area shows variable bulk S, Ni, Co, Cu, PGE, Au, As, Sb, Se, Te and Bi contents. S and Au tend to decrease irregularly from bottom to top of the deposit, whereas Ni, Ni/Co, PGE, As, Sb, Se, Te and Bi tend to increase. Thus, the upper section of the deposit has low S (< 1. 5 wt. %) and Au (160 ppb on average), but elevated levels of the PGE (2120 ppb Pt, 1855 ppb Pd on average). Sulfides consist of intergranular, highly disseminated aggregates mainly made up of pentlandite, pyrite, and chalcopyrite (all showing fine intergrowths), as well as nickeline, maucherite and <b>gersdorffite</b> in some samples. Most platinum-group minerals occur as single, minute grains included in silicates (57 %) or attached to the grain boundaries of sulfides (36 %). Only a few PGM grains (6 %) are included in sulfides.

Late-stage, cross-cutting, electrum-bearing chalcopyrite veins are consistent with the crystallization of Cu- and Au-rich intermediate solid solution. The chemistry, mineralogy and lithological relationships of the diorite suggest that it may be an appinite and as such is potentially analogous to the Au-rich lamprophyre dykes present within southwest Scotland. © 2004 The Mineralogical Society.

40|$|Lapieite, a new mineral species, {{is a rare}} {{constituent}} of a mineralized glacial erratic {{found at}} the confluence of Glacier Creek and Lapie River, St. Cyr Ranges, Yukon Ter-ritory. The highly metamorphosed rock consists mainly of quartz, magnesite, altered spinel and disseminated Cr-bearing mica. The sdnde minerals associated with lapieite are Ni-rich pyrite, <b>gersdorffite,</b> polydymite, millsrils, 1 etr 4 -hedrite, marcasite and chalcopyrite. The mineral is opaque and metallic, with fair cleavage parallel to [@]. Individual subhedral grains do not exceed 150 pm in length. Lapieite is moderately bireflectant and is pleochroic in shades of greenish gxey to grey: it is strongly anisotropic with very pale blue to intense yellowish pink rotation-tints. Reflec-tance measurements for 3 grains in air and oil are tabu-lated. Averaged electron-microprobe data yield the chem-ical formula Cu(Nir. mFeo. or) (Sbo. e 8 As 0. 0 l) Sz. g 7, calculated on tlte basis Cu = I or, ideally, CuNiSbS 3.

40|$|Low {{temperature}} lead-zinc-copper veins {{are developed}} within a NE-SW trending fracture system in rocks of the Eycott Volcanic Group at Driggith and Sandbed mines in the Caldbeck Fells, Cumbria. The lead veins were worked by {{a succession of}} mining companies from the 18 th century onward, first at Driggith mine and later at Sandbed mine. East-west trending baryte-quartz-carbonate veins were worked for baryte in the mid- 20 th century. The dumps from these mines surround {{and in some cases}} cover those of the earlier lead workings. Several episodes of primary mineralisation can be distinguished. The primary lead vein mineralisation comprises major quartz, calcite, sphalerite, galena and chalcopyrite. Sparse antimony-rich sulphide mineralisation is present as inclusions in the galena. There is rich, localised, iron sulphide-arsenopyrite mineralisation, which pre-dates the lead-copper-zinc vein mineralisation; sparse nickel- and cobalt-bearing mineralisation of unknown affinity, and baryte mineralisation with quartz and carbonates that post-dates the lead-copper-zinc vein mineralisation. The later baryte is present in distinct E-W trending veins and as a later stage of mineralisation in the fractures that host the lead-copper-zinc vein mineralisation. Supergene oxidation is extensive. About sixty supergene minerals have been identified. Distinctive specimens of curved green arsenate-rich pyromorphite on hackly quartz are well known from the opencut above Driggith mine. Bayldonite, cerussite, mimetite and malachite are widespread and abundant. Anglesite, aurichalcite, hemimorphite, Iinarite and philipsburgite are relatively common in micro-crystalline specimens. The arsenate minerals bariumpharmacosiderite, beudantite, mimetite, segnitite and scorodite form distinct localised gossans, which are closely associated with primary arsenopyrite. A variety of sulphate minerals including brochantite, langite, linarite, serpierite and schulenbergite have been formed by post-mining oxidation. Minerals discovered {{for the first time at}} the Sand bed and Driggith mines as a result of this study include arsendescloizite, annabergite, brianyoungite, djurleite, erythrite, <b>gersdorffite,</b> kottigite, lanarkite, lavendulan, olivenite, mawbyite, parnauite, philipsburgite, pyrrhotite, redgillite, strashimirite, yarrowite and zalesiite. Of these, annabergite, brianyoungite, <b>gersdorffite,</b> lavendulan, parnauite, strashimirite, yarrowite and zalesiite are reported for the first time in the Caldbeck Fells and mawbyite for the first time in the British Isles. The published mineralogy of the Driggith and Sandbed mines is complicated by the claims of Arthur Kingsbury, many of which are fraudulent. Rare species claimed by Kingsbury, which should be removed from the list of minerals from Driggith and Sand bed include allophane, chalcanthite, conichalcite, chlorargyrite, plancheite, plumbogummite, phosgenite, pseudomalachite, turquoise and wulfenite. In addition, many fine specimens in the Kingsbury collection which are labelled from Driggith or Sandbed mine, including common species such as adamite, brochantite, cerussite, leadhillite, Iinarite and malachite, are fraudulent, although undoubted specimens (almost always of much poorer quality) are well known at both localities...|$|E
40|$|Blebs and pods {{of organic}} matter (0. 2 - 7. 0 cm in diam) are {{associated}} with uranium min-eralization in all the major deposits (D, N-R-F, Claude, OP, and Dominique-Peter zones) of the Cluff Lake area in northwestern Saskatchewan. These deposits are hosted in strongly altered quartzofeldspathic, graphitic pelitic, and granitoid gneisses of suspected Archcan age and locally, as in the D zone, in the basal section of the unmetamorphosed middle Proterozoic Athabasca Group sediments, which comprise conglomerate, sandstone, and siltstone. Samples of the organic matter from the Claude deposit contain up to 12 percent uranium, principally as small uraninite grains (10 - 40 tim in diam) and minor coffinitc. Associated mineral grains include pyrite, marcasite, chalcopyrite, galena, molybdenite, jordisite, <b>gersdorffite,</b> and altaitc. The uranium and its daughters have caused massive radiation damage that is expressed as complexly zoned halos approximately 50 tim wide in the surrounding organic material. Stable isotope determinations ofthe bulk organic matter give a 6;aC value of- 44 per mil vs. PDB, whereas occluded gases CH 4 and CO 2, produced by irradiation, show •;aC values of- 48 and- 32 per mil vs. PDB, respectively. Pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass pectrometry of the sample yields mainly one- and fused-ring aromatic molecules from the organic matter that ar...|$|E
