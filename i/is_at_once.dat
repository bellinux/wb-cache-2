5|$|According to Najmabadi, {{occasionally}} we {{come across}} the lion and sun with a sword in the lion's paw and with a crown during this period. The Mohammad Shah's decree in 1836 states that the lion must erectly stand, bear a saber ("to make it explicitly stands for the military prowess of the state"). The crown was also added {{as a symbol of}} royalty rather than for any particular Qajar monarch. The decree states that the emblem <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>once</b> the national, royal, and the state emblem of Iran. In this period the lion was depicted as more masculine and the sun was female. Before this time the sun could be male or female and the lion was represented as a swordless, friendly and subdued seated animal.|$|E
5|$|From 1915 Gaudí devoted himself almost {{exclusively}} to his magnum opus, the Sagrada Família, a synthesis of his architectural evolution. After completion of the crypt and the apse, still in Gothic style, {{the rest of the}} church is conceived in an organic style, imitating natural shapes with their abundance of ruled surfaces. He intended the interior to resemble a forest, with inclined columns like branching trees, helicoidal in form, creating a simple but sturdy structure. Gaudí applied all of his previous experimental findings in this project, from works such as the Park Güell and the crypt of the Colònia Güell, creating a church that <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>once</b> structurally perfect, harmonious and aesthetically satisfying.|$|E
5|$|Glasser {{wished the}} benefit of the {{undivided}} assistance of counsel of his own choice. We think that such a desire on the part of an accused should be respected. Irrespective of any conflict of interest, the additional burden of representing another party may conceivably impair counsel's effectiveness. To determine the precise degree of prejudice sustained by Glasser {{as a result of the}} court's appointment of Stewart as counsel for Kretske <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>once</b> difficult and unnecessary. The right to have the assistance of counsel is too fundamental and absolute to allow courts to indulge in nice calculations as to the amount of prejudice arising from its denial.|$|E
60|$|A note <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>once</b> {{sent off}} to the lawyer's to make the appointment, and the girls arrived with Miss Purcell {{two or three minutes}} before the hour, and <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>once</b> shown into Mr. Pettigrew's room, where Mr. Farmer {{immediately}} joined them.|$|R

60|$|The horn <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>once</b> sounded, and Sir John Wyncliffe and {{the other}} knights hastily {{assembled}} in the courtyard. Here, after a short consultation, {{it was determined that}} a mounted party should <b>be,</b> <b>at</b> <b>once,</b> despatched to endeavour to harass the advance of the Welsh; the troop consisting of Alwyn's men-at-arms, twenty men of the garrison, and fifty mounted men who formed part of the new levy. Four hundred footmen <b>were</b> to follow, <b>at</b> <b>once.</b>|$|R

25|$|The 50-state {{strategy}} {{relied on}} the idea that building the Democratic Party <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>once</b> an incremental election by election process as well as a long-term vision in party building. Democrats cannot compete in counties in which they do not field candidates. Therefore, candidate recruitment emerged as a component element of the 50-state strategy.|$|E

25|$|The Dreaming <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>once</b> {{both the}} ancient time of {{creation}} and the present-day reality of Dreaming. There were a great many different groups, {{each with its own}} individual culture, belief structure, and language. These cultures overlapped {{to a greater or lesser}} extent, and evolved over time. Major ancestral spirits include the Rainbow Serpent, Baiame, Dirawong and Bunjil.|$|E
25|$|Parvati's legends are {{intrinsically}} {{related to}} Shiva. In the goddess-oriented Shakta texts, {{that she is}} said to transcend even Shiva, and is identified as the Supreme Being. Just as Shiva <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>once</b> the presiding deity of destruction and regeneration, the couple jointly symbolise at once both the power of renunciation and asceticism and the blessings of marital felicity.|$|E
25|$|Silver is also {{applied to}} copper {{by means of}} electroplating, and {{provides}} an interior finish that <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>once</b> smooth, more durable than either tin or nickel, relatively non-stick and extremely thermally efficient. Copper and silver bond extremely well owing to their shared high electro-conductivity. Lining thickness varies widely by maker, but averages between 7–10 microns. The disadvantages of silver are expense and the tendency of sulfurous foods, especially brassicas, to discolor. Worn silver linings on copper cookware can be restored by stripping and re-electroplating.|$|E

25|$|In mid-1980s Istanbul, Master Mahmut and his {{apprentice}} use ancient {{methods to}} dig new wells; {{this is the}} tale of their back-breaking struggle, {{but it is also}} an exploration—through stories and images—of ideas about fathers and sons, authoritarianism and individuality, state and freedom, reading and seeing. This short, compelling novel <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>once</b> a realist text investigating a murder which took place thirty years ago near Istanbul, and a fictional inquiry into the literary foundations of civilizations, comparing two fundamental myths of the West and the East respectively: Sophocles’s Oedipus Rex (a story of patricide) and Ferdowsi’s tale of Rostam and Sohrab (a story of filicide).|$|E
25|$|Indigenous Australians have {{a complex}} oral {{tradition}} and spiritual values based upon {{reverence for the}} land and {{a belief in the}} Dreaming. The Dreaming <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>once</b> the ancient time of creation and the present day reality of Dreaming. There were a great many different groups, each with their own individual culture, belief structure, and language. These cultures overlapped {{to a greater or lesser}} extent, and evolved over time. The Rainbow Serpent is a major dream spirit for Aboriginal people across Australia. The Yowie and Bunyip are other well known dream spirits. At the time of the British settlement, traditional religions were animist and also tended to have elements of ancestor worship.|$|E
25|$|After his retirement, Eamon Carr went on {{to become}} a {{producer}} of young rock talent in the mid-1980s, and also forming his own record label called Hotwire (which sponsored noted acts such as the punk rock group The Golden Horde). He also did a number of specialist DJ slots on radio before morphing into a music/sports journalist with the Evening Herald in Dublin. More recently he presented on a Dublin station 'Carr's Cocktail Shack' in which he played American music of the 1950s and 1960s. In 2008, Carr and Henry McCullough co-wrote a new bunch of songs. A resulting album entitled Poor Man's Moon was released on 1 September 2008. Also in 2008, Carr released his first book, The Origami Crow, Journey Into Japan, World Cup Summer 2002, a book that <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>once</b> a travel log about his journey to Japan, a poetry collection, an homage to Japanese poet Basho, heralded by many as the creator of Haiku, and also has some sports commentary thrown in.|$|E

25|$|During the 16th {{century the}} best work is {{undoubtedly}} to {{be found on the}} Continent. France, Germany and the Netherlands producing numberless examples not only of house decoration but of furniture as well. The wealth of the newly discovered American continent was only one factor which assisted in the civilizing influence of this time, and {{hand in hand with the}} spread of commerce came the desire for refinement. The custom of building houses chiefly in wood wherever timber was plentiful continued. Pilasters took the place of pinnacles, and vases or dolphins assisted the acanthus leaf to oust the older forms of design. House fronts of wood gave ample scope to the carver. That of Sir Paul Pinder (1600), formerly in Bishopsgate, but now preserved in the Victoria and Albert Museum, is a good example of decorative treatment without overloading. The brackets carved in the shape of monsters which support the projecting upper storey are typical of hundreds of dwellings, as for instance St Peters Hospital, Bristol. The panels, too, of Sir Paul Pinders house are good examples of that Jacobean form of medallion surrounded by scroll work which <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>once</b> as decorative as it is simple.|$|E
25|$|Xenocrates {{recognized}} three {{grades of}} cognition, each appropriated to {{a region of}} its own: knowledge, sensation, and opinion. He referred knowledge (episteme) to that essence which {{is the object of}} pure thought, and is not included in the phenomenal world; sensation (aisthesis) to that which passes into the world of phenomena; opinion (doxa) to that essence which <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>once</b> the object of sensuous perception, and, mathematically, of pure reason - the essence of heaven or the stars; so that he conceived of doxa in a higher sense, and endeavoured, more definitely than Plato, to exhibit mathematics as mediating between knowledge and sensuous perception. All three modes of apprehension partake of truth; but in what manner scientific perception (epistemonike aisthesis) did so, we unfortunately do not learn. Even here Xenocrates's preference for symbolic modes of sensualising or denoting appears: he connected the above three stages of knowledge with the three Fates: Atropos, Clotho, and Lachesis. We know nothing further about the mode in which Xenocrates carried out his dialectic, as it is probable that what was peculiar to Aristotelian logic did not remain unnoticed in it, for it can hardly be doubted that the division of the existent into the absolutely existent, and the relatively existent, attributed to Xenocrates, was opposed to the Aristotelian table of categories.|$|E
25|$|The medieval {{story of}} Sir Eglamour of Artois {{makes use of}} a number of themes and motifs that are found in other romances of the period. Near the very {{beginning}} of the tale the reader, or listener, <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>once</b> introduced to two of them. Sir Eglamour is in love with his overlord’s daughter. She is the child and heir of an earl. Sir Eglamour, a relatively poor knight, declares his love for Christabel and is immediately given three impossible tasks to achieve by her angry father in order to win her hand in marriage; just as Culhwch is given an impossibly long list of impossible tasks by Chief Giant Ysbaddaden in the Old Welsh Mabinogion tale How Culhwch won Olwen, in order to win the hand in marriage of his daughter and heir. Sir Eglamour’s first task is to take a deer from a forest far to the west, where the Celtic Otherworld is often located. The forest is surrounded by a stone wall and the deer are guarded by a giant who stands fifty feet tall. Despite these difficulties, Sir Eglamour manages to kill the principal stag of the giant’s herd and then kills the giant himself. Having achieved this first trial, Sir Eglamour returns home triumphant, carrying the giant’s head as well as that of the deer.|$|E

500|$|A. O. Scott of The New York Times wrote [...] "what makes 'Let Me In' so eerily {{fascinating}} is {{the mood}} it creates. It <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>once</b> artful and unpretentious, {{more interested in}} intimacy and implication than in easy scares or slick effects." ...|$|E
500|$|Welch and Rawlings {{incorporate}} {{elements of}} {{early twentieth century}} music such as old time, classic country, gospel and traditional bluegrass with modern elements of rhythm and blues, rock 'n' roll, jazz, and punk rock. [...] The New Yorkers Alec Wilkinson maintained their musical style is [...] "not easily classified—it <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>once</b> innovative and obliquely reminiscent of past rural forms".|$|E
500|$|Dylan critic Michael Gray also {{praises the}} subtlety of the song. Gray {{acknowledges}} {{that it is difficult}} to say what this song is [...] "about", since it <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>once</b> indefinable and precise. For Gray, its principal achievement lies in the way it confuses categories, using language to be simultaneously serious and flippant, delicate and coarse, and mixing up [...] "abstract neo-philosophy and figurative phraseology".|$|E
