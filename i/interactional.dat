25|$|Most outcome {{research}} {{is carried out}} using time-limited therapy with diagnostically homogenous groups.

25|$|Perceptions of {{injustice}} and unfairness are significant antecedents and determinants of turnover intention (DeConinck & Stilwell, 2004; Nadiri & Tanova, 2010). In other words, turnover intention {{is a considerable}} outcome of an employee's fairness perceptions. Although all three dimensions of organizational justice {{may play a role}} in an employee’s intention to exit an organization, <b>interactional</b> and distributive justice are more predictive of turnover intention than procedural justice (Thomas & Nagalingappa, 2012).|$|E
25|$|The sum {{of being}} {{consists}} of the two systems of substantial forms and <b>interactional</b> relations, and it reappears {{in the form of}} concept and judgment, the concept representing being and the judgment being in action. Knowledge has under both forms the same object, the relative difference of the two being that when the conceptual form predominates we have speculative science and when the form of judgment prevails we have empirical or historical science. Throughout the domain of knowledge the two forms are found in constant mutual relations, another proof of the fundamental unity of thought and being or of the objectivity of knowledge. It is obvious that Plato, Spinoza and Kant had contributed characteristic elements of their thought to this system, and directly or indirectly it was largely indebted to Schelling for fundamental conceptions.|$|E
25|$|The {{rhetoric of}} the nudism and anti-nudism {{movements}} emphasizes freedom {{from many of the}} normal constraints which regulate human interaction in nudist settings, although for different reasons. Using data from French and German beaches, this hypothesis was tested using five different indicators. Little significant variation between nudists and non-nudists within French and German settings is found in their patterns of <b>interactional</b> spacing, while more significant main effects for differences of cultures are found regardless of nudity status. As a subculture, nudists would appear to differ from nonnudists only in their propensity to like to sunbathe in the nude. Their nude status would appear to have none of the de-inhibiting effects often attributed to nudism. By contrast, clear cultural differences between German and French cultures are shown consistent with Hall's high-low context distinction and the Francoeur's hot-cool sexuality continuum.|$|E

2500|$|A recent {{meta-analysis}} by Barsky and Kaplan (2007) condenses {{many studies}} {{on this topic}} and explains that state and trait level affect can influence one's perceptions of justice. [...] The findings of Barsky and Kaplan show that both state and trait level negative affect can act as antecedents to justice perceptions. [...] State and trait level negative affect are negatively associated with <b>interactional,</b> procedural, and distributive justice perceptions. [...] Conversely, positive state and trait affectivity was linked to higher ratings of <b>interactional,</b> procedural and distributive justice.|$|E
2500|$|The {{accuracy}} of the two-factor model was challenged by studies that suggested a third factor (<b>interactional</b> justice) may be involved. [...] Bies and Moag (1986) argue that <b>interactional</b> justice is distinct from procedural justice because it represents the social exchange component of the interaction {{and the quality of}} treatment whereas procedural justice represents the processes that were used to arrive at the decision outcomes. [...] Generally researchers are in agreement regarding the distinction between procedural and distributive justice but there is more controversy over the distinction between <b>interactional</b> and procedural justice (Cohen-Charash & Spector, 2001). [...] Colquitt (2001) demonstrated that a four-factor model (including procedural, distributive, interpersonal, and informational justice) fit the data significantly better than a two or three factor model. [...] Colquitt's construct validation study also showed that each of the four components have predictive validity for different key organizational outcomes (e.g., commitment and rule compliance).|$|E
2500|$|<b>Interactional</b> justice {{refers to}} the {{treatment}} that an individual receives as decisions are made and can be promoted by providing explanations for decisions and delivering the news with sensitivity and respect (Bies & Moag, 1986). [...] A construct validation study by Colquitt (2001) suggests that <b>interactional</b> justice should be broken into two components: interpersonal and informational justice. Interpersonal justice refers to perceptions of respect and propriety in one's treatment while informational justice relates to {{the adequacy of the}} explanations given in terms of their timeliness, specificity, and truthfulness.|$|E
2500|$|Emotional exhaustion, which {{related to}} {{employee}} health and burnout, {{is related to}} overall organizational justice perceptions. As perceptions of justice increase employee health increases and burnout decreases (Liljegren & Ekberg, 2009). [...] Distributive, procedural, and <b>interactional</b> justice perceptions are able to capture state specific levels of emotional exhaustion which fade over time; however, overall organizational justice perceptions give the most stable picture {{of the relationship between}} justice perceptions and emotional exhaustion over time (Liljegren & Ekberg, 2009).|$|E
2500|$|Another {{model of}} {{organizational}} justice proposed by Byrne (1999) and colleagues (Byrne & Cropanzano, 2000) [...] suggested that organizational justice is a multi-foci construct, one where employees see justice as {{coming from a}} source - either the organization or their supervisor. Thus, rather than focus on justice as {{the three or four}} factor component model, Byrne suggested that employees personify the organization and they distinguish between whether they feel the organization or supervisor have treated them fairly (<b>interactional),</b> use fair procedures (procedural), or allocate rewards or assignments fairly (distributive justice). A number of researchers used this model exploring the possibility that justice is more than just 3 or 4 factors (e.g., Karriker & Williams, 2009).|$|E
2500|$|As {{the only}} case where video of an {{incident}} of fratricide or 'friendly fire' has become publicly available, {{the case has}} attracted {{a great deal of}} interest among researchers interested in exploring the question of why such incidents occur and what might be done about them. Drawing on the sociological research traditions of ethnomethodology and conversation analysis, the work of Nevile and the work of Elsey, Mair, Smith and Watson, among these, has offered detailed accounts of how the incident unfolded in real-time as well as how it was subsequently investigated by the various military and non-military inquiries after-the-fact. In the course of their research, [...] Elsey, Mair, Smith and Watson developed an alternative version of the transcript, based in part on the detailed information released in the USAF Friendly Fire Investigation Board Report, {{to make it easier to}} follow the incident’s <b>interactional</b> dynamics. The transcript is available open access.|$|E

The board of trustees responded by appointing some of the individual faculty and by, [...] "reviewing the allocation of faculty positions with consideration of how they will contribute to <b>interactional</b> diversity in the curriculum" [...] in the college's 2016–2021 strategic plan. The college opposed firing any employees in response and neglected to issue formal responses {{to many of the}} other demands though has sought to cut wages and health care funds for administrator, office worker and library support staff Office and Professional Employees International Union members during contract negotiations. Many campus workers still earn the minimum wage. Over 75 students protested the college's attempt to alter administrator, office worker and library support staff contracts during spring 2016 contract negotiations.|$|E
2500|$|Since then, through {{interdisciplinary}} and convergent studies, Cohen {{has attempted}} to more fully understand ways in which experience is represented and stored by the brain. [...] A major focus of his work has been {{the role played by}} the hippocampus, located in the medial temporal lobe of the brain, in forming relational memories. [...] Cohen and Howard Eichenbaum have developed a theory of memory, learning and amnesia, known as relational memory theory. [...] In this view, the hippocampus is essential in elemental cognitive processes that bind elements of experience in memory, and link memories together, forming a representation of the relations among [...] "the constituent elements of experience" [...] referred to as a [...] "memory space". [...] The hippocampus rapidly forms associations between incoming information about people, places, objects, and their spatial, temporal, and <b>interactional</b> relationships, and connects them to reactivated relational memories. [...] In the underlying representational scheme, [...] events are represented as relations among elements of experience in a particular context. Episodes are represented as the flow of events across time. [...] Memory is represented as a dynamic and flexible relational network of events and episodes, from which novel inferences can be drawn. For example, a person's name and their face are stored as separate pieces of information in the brain, but bound together in relational memory so that the person can be recognized the next time they are seen. The property of [...] "representational flexibility" [...] is considered to be critical, and as derivable from [...] "the kind of system that must necessarily evolve to store environmental spatial information".|$|E
2500|$|Focus group {{discussion}} in qualitative method has gain huge popularity {{of this method}} across the social sciences over the past decade. Focus groups are now thoroughly assessable and familiar to the general public. Prior 1920’s and late 1970’s the focus groups were mainly used in marketing, tool, and studies {{in the field in}} the business. Aspects like including education, communication, media studies, feminist research, sociology and social psychology. Focused groups are also known as ‘group interviews’. The members are encouraged to interact and have discussions. The data collected by focused {{group discussion}} are seldom produced through interview and observation; it enlightens us with its power of knowledge. Focus group discussion also focuses on the process beyond the individual’s memory and desires. The richness and complexity of group dynamics should be considered. Focus group can also access to social <b>interactional</b> dynamics that produce particular memories, ideologies, and practices among the group members. It themselves becomes relevant, termed as units of analysis of our study. Questions, issues and topics process focus group. Through different dynamics multiple angles of vision {{can be seen in the}} new world in unexpected ways. Focus group helps us move towards constructing a ‘methodology of getting lost” and toward enacting “double practices” (lather, 2001). This seems a necessary step towards conducting qualitative research. Keeping norms and rules of groups in mind the researcher and research participants realize that interpretation of individual are situated, provisional, contingent, unstable thus it’s unchangeable. It is necessary for the researcher to have self-reflectivity that involves making the research transparent rhetorical and poetic work of the researcher in representing the object of the study. It is theoretically important to construct a mutual ground between the researcher and the research participants. The second sense of self-reflexivity is important to encourage refection on interpretive research as the dual practice of knowledge gathering and self transformation is done through self-reflection and mutual reflection. Allowing ourselves to dwell in the existing inevitable indeterminacies, we are leading ourselves in the best way of the qualitative research practice.|$|E

5000|$|In {{identifying}} this {{separate and}} distinctive kind of linguistic expertise, {{the idea of}} <b>interactional</b> expertise makes a clear break with other theories of expertise, particularly those developed in Science and Technology Studies, which tend to see expertise as a social status granted by others rather than a property of the individual. As discussed in more detail below, the idea of <b>interactional</b> expertise also differs from more traditional phenomenological theories of expertise, in which the [...] expertise of the contributory expert is well-recognised but the distinctively linguistic expertise of the <b>interactional</b> expert {{appears to have been}} overlooked. In this context, it must be emphasised that <b>interactional</b> expertise is a tacit knowledge-laden ability and thus similar in kind to the more embodied contributory expertise. This means that, like contributory expertise, <b>interactional</b> expertise cannot be acquired from books alone and it cannot be encoded in computerised expert systems. It is a specialised natural language and, as such; it can only be acquired by linguistic interaction with experts. The difference between <b>interactional</b> and contributory expertise is that, in the case of <b>interactional</b> expertise, the tacit knowledge pertains to the language of the domain but not its practice. In the case of contributory expertise, tacit knowledge relating to both the language and practice must be acquired.|$|E

50|$|To summarize, Picard and her adherents {{pursue a}} cognitivist {{measuring}} approach to users' affect, while the <b>interactional</b> perspective endorses a pragmatist approach that views (emotional) experience as inherently referring to social interaction. While the Picardian approach, thus, focuses on human-machine relations, <b>interactional</b> affective computing focuses primarily on computer-mediated interpersonal communication. And while the Picardian approach {{is concerned with}} the measurement and modeling of physiological variables, <b>interactional</b> affective computing is concerned with emotions as complex subjective interpretations of affect, arguing that emotions, not affect, are at stake {{from the point of view}} of technology users.|$|E

50|$|The {{link between}} these arguments, the {{embodiment}} debate {{and the idea}} of <b>interactional</b> expertise is the importance of natural language. If <b>interactional</b> expertise exists then it suggests that people who cannot perform a particular task or skill - and who therefore cannot have the embodied expertise associated with it - can still talk about that skill as if they did possess the embodied skills. <b>Interactional</b> expertise thus raises a key question about the “amount” of embodiment that is needed for expertise to be transferred. For proponents of the embodiment thesis, quite a lot of embodiment is needed as the expertise resides in the relative position, movement and feel of the body. From the perspective of <b>interactional</b> expertise much less embodiment is needed and, taken to its logical minimum, perhaps only the ability to hear and speak are needed.|$|E

5000|$|The post-cognitive, <b>interactional</b> {{approach}} to affective computing departs from the Picardian research program in three ways: First, it adopts {{a notion of}} emotion as constituted in social interaction. This {{is not to deny}} that emotion has biophysical aspects, but it is to underline that emotion is [...] "culturally grounded, dynamically experienced, and to some degree constructed in action and interaction".Second, the <b>interactional</b> approach does not seek to enhance the affect-processing capacities of computer systems. Rather, it seeks to help [...] " ... people to understand and experience their own emotions".Third, the <b>interactional</b> approach accordingly adopts different design and evaluation strategies than those described by the Picardian research program. <b>Interactional</b> affective design supports open-ended, (inter-)individual processes of affect interpretation. It recognizes the context-sensitive, subjective, changing and possibly ambiguous character of affect interpretation. And it takes into account that these sense-making efforts and affect itself may resist a computational formalization.|$|E
