5|$|Although it {{had sold}} two million copies by August 2008, Here <b>I</b> <b>Stand</b> {{was seen as}} a {{commercial}} failure relative to Confessions, which had sold nineteen million copies. Tyler Lewis of PopMatters put the album's limited success down to Usher's and Foster's marriage; he believed that Usher's fans disliked Foster.|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stood</b> not a yard {{from the}} sweet lips I had kissed; <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> within arm's {{length of the}} inanimate beauty I desired to quicken, and I saw opening between us a gulf of years, toil, waiting, disappointments and an immense uncertainty.|$|R

25|$|Following {{the release}} of <b>I</b> <b>Stand</b> Alone, Fältskog had a 17-year hiatus from the music industry, during which she made few public appearances.|$|E
6000|$|While {{one might}} have counted twenty <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> unwilling to {{acknowledge}} my helplessness, and then something like a gleam of common sense came into my mind. <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> ready to confess that I had acted like a simple, and he must have understood something of the truth, when I said: ...|$|R
60|$|She went on {{painting}} in silence. From where <b>I</b> <b>stood</b> <b>I</b> {{could see her}} profile. Her chin was tilted. Her expression was determined.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stood</b> helplessly {{gazing at}} her--anxious to comfort but unable.|$|R
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1987, Fältskog {{travelled}} to Malibu, California, to record her fourth post-ABBA solo album, <b>I</b> <b>Stand</b> Alone, produced by Peter Cetera (formerly of the band Chicago) and Bruce Gaitsch, who had collaborated on Madonna's La Isla Bonita. Released in November of that year, <b>I</b> <b>Stand</b> Alone was a minor hit in Europe, except in Sweden where it spent eight weeks at No. 1 and became the best-selling album of 1988. More than 300,000 copies were sold throughout Scandinavia. According to Hans Englund, the Swedish head of WEA, more than 800,000 copies were sold globally. However, chart-wise outside of Scandinavia, the results were less impressive.|$|E
25|$|On 16 December Hussey scored 103 {{runs off}} 156 balls—his fifth Test century—on {{the third day}} of the third match of the series at the WACA Ground in Perth. On 6 January 2007 after Australia's 5–0 Ashes whitewash, Justin Langer anointed Hussey to be the next leader of the team's victory song Under the Southern Cross <b>I</b> <b>Stand.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{politics}} {{of this would be}} very easy. The politics would be, {{to be one of the}} lads, the safest way in Ireland. But I do not believe that the interests of this State, or our Constitution and of this Republic, would be served by putting politics before conscience in regard to this. There is a choice of a kind that can only be answered by saying that <b>I</b> <b>stand</b> by the Republic and accordingly I will not oppose this Bill.|$|E

25|$|Some historians posit {{that a new}} era of the {{gay rights}} {{movement}} began in the 1980s with the emergence of AIDS, which decimated the leadership and shifted the focus for many. This era saw a resurgence of militancy with direct action groups like AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP), formed in 1987, as well as its offshoots Queer Nation (1990) and the Lesbian Avengers (1992). Some younger activists, seeing gay and lesbian as increasingly normative and politically conservative, began using queer as a defiant statement of all sexual minorities and gender variant people—just as the earlier liberationists had done with gay. Less confrontational terms that attempt to reunite the interests of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people also became prominent, including various acronyms like LGBT, LGBTQ, and LGBTI, where the Q and <b>I</b> <b>stand</b> for queer or questioning and intersex, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Mulroney, while {{publicly}} endorsing Clark at a {{press conference}} in 1982, organized behind the scenes to defeat him at the party's leadership review. Clark's key Quebec organizer Rodrigue Pageau was in fact a double agent, working for Mulroney, undermining Clark's support. When Clark received an endorsement by only 66.9 per cent of delegates at the party convention in January 1983 in Winnipeg, he resigned and ran to regain his post at the 1983 leadership convention. Despite still not being a member of Parliament, Mulroney ran against him, campaigning more shrewdly than he had done seven years before. Mulroney had been criticized in 1976 for lacking policy depth and substance, a weakness he addressed by making several major speeches across the country in the early 1980s, which were collected into a book, Where <b>I</b> <b>Stand,</b> published in 1983. Mulroney also avoided most of the flash of his earlier campaign, for which he had been criticized. Mulroney was elected party leader on June 11, 1983, beating Clark on the fourth ballot, attracting broad support from the many factions of the party and especially from representatives of his native Quebec. Two months later, Mulroney entered Parliament as the MP for Central Nova in Nova Scotia, winning a by-election in what was then considered a safe Tory seat, after Elmer MacKay stood aside in his favour. This is a common practice in most parliamentary systems.|$|E
25|$|I find it {{very hard}} to say this truth. I am to blame for {{everything}} I did at that time. I am trying to erase all this and to be what I was not at that time. I am also to blame for what I did not do, for not trying to protect those prisoners. Regardless of the temporary nature of my then-post. I ask myself again and again, what could I have done that I didn't do? Thousands of innocent victims perished. Graves remain behind, refugees, destruction and misfortune and misery. I bear general part of the responsibility for this. There is misfortune on all sides that stays behind as a warning that this should never happen again. My testimony and admission of guilt will also remove blame from my nation because it is individual guilt, the guilt of a man named Dragan Obrenović. <b>I</b> <b>stand</b> by this. I am responsible for this. The guilt for which I feel remorse and for which I apologise to the victims and to their shadows. I will be happy if this contributed to reconciliation in Bosnia, if neighbours can again shake hands, if our children can again play games together, and if {{they have the right to}} a chance. I will be happy if my testimony helps the families of victims, if I can spare them having to testify again and thus relive the horrors and the pain during their testimony. It is my wish that my testimony should help prevent this ever happening again, not just in Bosnia, but anywhere in the world. It is too late for me now, but for the children living in Bosnia now, it's not too late and I hope that this will be a good warning to them.|$|E

500|$|Usher's publicist, Patti Webster, {{resigned}} on August1,2008. Usher rehired Patton as {{his manager}} on August6,2008 and [...] "dissolved his management arrangement with Benny Medina". At {{the time of}} the split from Medina, Here <b>I</b> <b>Stand</b> had sold two million copies worldwide compared to Confessions nineteen million copies; some speculated that the disunion was because of the poorer album sales. Medina said that he and the singer [...] "parted ways amicably", and deflected comments that he was responsible for the lower album sales. He pointed out that Here <b>I</b> <b>Stand</b> and [...] "Love in This Club" [...] reached number one on the US charts, and that the music industry had changed since the release of Confessions. Due to the lower sales, Here <b>I</b> <b>Stand</b> was seen as a commercial failure. According to Tyler Lewis from PopMatters its failure was spurred by Usher's marriage to Foster: [...] "his fanbase hated his wife".|$|E
500|$|Here <b>I</b> <b>Stand</b> is {{the fifth}} studio album by American singer Usher, {{released}} on May13,2008 by LaFace Records. Inspired by love for his new wifeTameka Fosterand son, Usher recorded many ballads for the album. Prior to the album's recording, Usher split with his mother, Jonnetta Patton, as manager and hired Benny Medina. Usher's estranged father died months before the release of Here I Stand; this also influenced themes of the album. It was originally to be titled [...] "Measure of a Man", but Usher named it Here <b>I</b> <b>Stand</b> to mark [...] "a new chapter in [...] life".|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} leaked onto the {{internet}} in later October 2009 with several preliminary tracks from Raymond v. Raymond. [...] "Hey Daddy (Daddy's Home)", one of the tracks that follows-up Usher's divorce, and the change in content from Here <b>I</b> <b>Stand,</b> back to Confessions-style, was one of six tracks co-written by Rico Love for the album. In an exclusive with Rap-Up, Love said of Usher's return to that style, [...] "I feel like he’s got his mind right and it’s focused. He went through a lot. He had lost his father when he was creating the Here <b>I</b> <b>Stand</b> record, {{a lot of controversy}} with his marriage, he had kids, he parted ways with his mother’s management, and there were just {{a lot of things going}} on and he kind of lost focus. It’s not like Here <b>I</b> <b>Stand</b> wasn’t a good album. I just feel like he lost touch with his demographic." [...] According to MTV News, the song provides the reasons behind Usher's crumbling marriage as narrated in [...] "Papers". The remix version featuring Plies made its way onto {{the internet in}} late November, a few days before the song's radio and digital release.|$|E
