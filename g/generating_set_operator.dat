We construct integral forms for vertex (operator) algebras based on highest-weight modules for affine Lie algebras and we exhibit natural <b>generating</b> <b>sets.</b> For vertex <b>operator</b> algebras in general, we give conditions showing when an integral form contains the standard conformal vector generating the Virasoro algebra.

40|$|Let V be {{a unitary}} vertex {{operator}} algebra (VOA) satisfying the following conditions: (1) V is of CFT type. (2) Every N-gradable weak V-module is completely reducible. (3) V is C_ 2 -cofinite. Let Rep^u(V) be {{the category of}} unitary V-modules, and let C be a subcategory of Rep^u(V) whose objects are closed under taking tensor product. Then C is a ribbon fusion category. For any objects W_i,W_j of C, we define a sesquilinear form on the tensor product W_i W_j. We show that if these sesquilinear forms are positive definite (i. e., when they are inner products), then the ribbon fusion category C is unitary. We show that if the unitary V-modules and a <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> of intertwining <b>operators</b> in C satisfy certain energy bounds, then these sesquilinear forms are positive definite. Our result {{can be applied to}} the modular tensor categories of unitary Virasoro VOAs, and unitary affine VOAs of type A_n,D_n,G_ 2, and more. Comment: 68 page...|$|R

40|$|There {{are three}} <b>set</b> <b>operators</b> defined in XQuery, namely union, {{intersect}} and except. They take node sequences as operands, {{in which each}} node is identified by its node-ID and treated as an atomic entity. However, according to XML semantics, each node is “a set of set(s) ”, which have descendants in a tree-structured hierarchy. Unfortunately, the regular <b>set</b> <b>operators</b> as described above ignored this structural feature of XML data. On the other hand, some XML applications can be benefited from <b>set</b> <b>operators</b> with different semantics considering ancestor-descendant relationships between nodes. In this extended semantics, the comparison during query processing are conducted not only on nodes of both operands, but also on their descendants, in a “deep” manner.

40|$|Abstract. A module M over a ring R is said {{to satisfy}} (P) if every gen-erating set of M {{contains}} an independent <b>generating</b> <b>set.</b> The following results are proved; (1) Let τ = (Tτ,Fτ) be a hereditary torsion theory such that Tτ 6 = Mod-R. Then every τ-torsionfree R-module satisfies (P) {{if and only if}} S = R/τ(R) is a division ring. (2) Let K be a hereditary pre-torsion class of modules. Then every module in K satisfies (P) if and only if either K = { 0 } or S = R/SocK(R) is a division ring, where SocK(R) = ∩{I ≤ RR: R/I ∈ K}. For a right R-moduleM, a subset X ofM {{is said to}} be a <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> ofM if M = Σx∈XxR; and a minimal <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> of M is any <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> Y of M such that no proper subset of Y can generate M. A <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> X of M is called an independent <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> if Σx∈XxR = ⊕x∈XxR. Clearly, every independent <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> of M is a minimal <b>generating</b> <b>set,</b> but the converse is not true in general. For example, the set { 2, 3 } is a minimal <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> of ZZ but not an independent <b>generating</b> <b>set.</b> It is well-known that every <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> of a right vector space over a division ring contains a minimal <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> (or a basis). This motivated various interests in characterizing the rings R such that every module in a certain class of right R-modules contains a minimal <b>generating</b> <b>set,</b> or every <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> of each module in a certain class of right R-modules contains a minimal <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> (see, for example, [2], [8], [9], [11]). In [2, Theorem 2. 3], the authors proved that R is a division ring if and only if every R-module has a basis if and only if every irredundant subset of an R-module is independent. This result can be considered in a more general context of a torsion theory. For anR-moduleM,M is said to satisfy (P) if ever...|$|R
