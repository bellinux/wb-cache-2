Conclusion/Recommendations: It can be concluded that performance of <b>extension</b> <b>agents</b> is expected to increase if they have program development competencies. Results supported the importance of these competencies for performance of <b>extension</b> <b>agents</b> in process of technology transfer. Hence to keep <b>extension</b> <b>agents</b> competent and to further improve their performance, these competencies must be considered and upgraded.

40|$|Abstract — It is {{expected}} that the income generated by paddy industry will increase up to 988 million per year. In order to achieve this, <b>extension</b> <b>agents</b> plays important role in educating farmers by encouraging them to learn, adopt new technologies and spread them to other farmers. To ensure the success of <b>extension</b> program, the <b>agents</b> should recognize their roles as change agents (as a catalyst, solution giver, process helper, and resource linker) and have ability to acquire competencies to accomplish these roles. Thus, this study aims to explore the level of roles among <b>extension</b> <b>agents.</b> Using a quantitative survey methodology, self-administered questionnaires measuring the roles of <b>extension</b> <b>agents</b> as change agents. A total of 117 <b>extension</b> <b>agents</b> had participated in this study. The <b>extension</b> <b>agents</b> were the officers from various agricultural departments and agencies who serve paddy farmers in Malaysia region in related to extension, marketing, financing, farmers association, production, and others.

Hence, the competency of <b>extension</b> <b>agents</b> in Malaysia is indeed especially as a change agents and one of the important determinants of success for agriculture industry in Malaysia.

Respondents were the <b>extension</b> <b>agents</b> operating in this area. A structured interview instrument was used and data were obtained from 112 of the 115 <b>extension</b> <b>agents</b> in the study area;The most important impacts as perceived by <b>extension</b> <b>agents</b> were widespread awareness of recommended farm practices, higher crop production, and availability of farm inputs. The most perceived roles of <b>extension</b> by <b>extension</b> <b>agents</b> were holding meetings, home and farm visits, providing farmers with information and organizing community projects;However, the most performed role was writing reports followed by providing farmers with information and distribution of farm materials. There was high consensus with extension officials that providing farmers with information, distributing farm materials, and holding meetings, home and farm visits were the three most important roles of extension agents;Role and organization theories were used to investigate factors that influence agent role performance which, in turn, affects role impact. Using path analysis, significant predictors of role performance were role perception, age, and decision making.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} Texas <b>Extension</b> <b>agents?</b> and supervisors? perceptions of the current Performance Appraisal System. A survey instrument was developed to address the research questions. The instrument had two sections: satisfaction with the Current Appraisal System (14 items) and satisfaction with Appraiser Performance ? views toward the roles/behavior of the appraiser relative to the performance appraisal process (7 items). The online survey was piloted by eight Extension employees. The instrument was deployed online to the study population. The population studied consisted of all Texas <b>Extension</b> <b>agents</b> in November, 2014 (N= 596) and supervisors? (N= 19), making the total population for the study 615 respondents. The total completed responses were 282 for a completed response rate of 46 %. In this study, seven in ten respondents (74. 3 %) felt that the current appraisal system should be improved. The desired improvements included: (a) The <b>Extension</b> <b>agents?</b> desire to have an annual appraisal system that rates them fairly (less subjective); (b) the <b>Extension</b> <b>agents?</b> desire for a performance appraisal rubric that more accurately reflects their actual job duties; (c) the <b>Extension</b> <b>agents?</b> desire to make the performance appraisal system less time-consuming and efficient; and (d) information from the appraisal system needs to be able to flow into other reporting system for other required reports. Overall, Texas <b>Extension</b> <b>agents</b> were satisfied with the roles and behaviors of their appraisers (supervisors). The majority of Texas <b>Extension</b> <b>agents</b> and supervisors viewed their appraiser?s performance in conducting the appraisal with positive judgment, fairness, and trust by their subordinates. The major recommendations emerging from this study are the provision of professional development for all appraisers to ensure accurate and effective performance appraisal, exploration of strategies to require less effort on the part of Texas <b>Extension</b> <b>agents</b> to prepare the appraisal materials, not to use a team approach for performance appraisal, develop a trust-worthy appraisal system and link the appraisal system to merit or salary increase...|$|R

The contact and non-contact farmers were selected by simple random sampling. All the <b>extension</b> <b>agents</b> working in the zone studied were respondents. The results show that the contact farmers understand their roles, relate with <b>extension</b> <b>agents</b> as expected, perform the roles assigned to them both on their farms, and in passing on messages received from <b>extension</b> <b>agents</b> to non-contact farmers. Many factors were identified as affecting the performance of contact farmers.
