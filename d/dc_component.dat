So they were only used if the gain was specified down to DC (e.g., in an oscilloscope). In the context of modern electronics developers are encouraged to use directly coupled amplifiers whenever possible. In FET and CMOS technologies direct coupling is dominant since gates of MOSFETs theoretically pass no current through themselves.

Bias is a technique by which active devices are set to operate in a particular region, or by which the <b>DC</b> <b>component</b> of the output signal is set to the midpoint between the maximum voltages available from the power supply. Most amplifiers use several devices at each stage; they are typically matched in specifications except for polarity. Matched inverted polarity devices are called complementary pairs. Class-A amplifiers generally use only one device, unless the power supply is set to provide {{both positive and negative}} voltages, in which case a dual device symmetrical design may be used. Class-C amplifiers, by definition, use a single polarity supply.|$|E

40|$|Stator flux {{estimation}} using voltage {{model is}} basically {{the integration of the}} induced stator back electromotive force (emf) signal. In practical implementation the pure integration is replaced by a low pass filter to avoid the DC drift and saturation problems at the integrator output because of the initial condition error and the inevitable <b>DC</b> <b>components</b> in the back emf signal. However, the low pass filter introduces errors in the estimated stator flux which are significant at frequencies near or lower than the cutoff frequency. Also the <b>DC</b> <b>components</b> in the back emf signal are amplified at the low pass filter output by a factor equals to. Therefore, different integration algorithms have been proposed to improve the stator flux estimation at steady state and transient conditions. In this paper a new algorithm for stator flux estimation is proposed for direct torque control (DTC) of induction motor drives. The proposed algorithm is composed of a second order high pass filter and an integrator which can effectively eliminates the effect of the error initial condition and the <b>DC</b> <b>components.</b> The amplitude and phase errors compensation algorithm is selected such that the steady state frequency response amplitude and phase angle are equivalent to that of the pure integrator and the multiplication and division by stator frequency are avoided. Also the cutoff frequency selection is improved, even small value can filter out the <b>DC</b> <b>components</b> in the back emf signal. The simulation results show the improved performance of the induction motor direct torque control drive with the proposed stator flux estimation algorithm.
