60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{side of my}} bed, {{actually}} quivering with excitement.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> foot of {{the couch}} near to the font-like basin of water, and She sank down softly on to the other end.|$|E
60|$|The kind frank way {{in which}} this was said quite won my heart, so <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> old cask, and told the sailor all my sorrows.|$|E
60|$|We {{took our}} bags into the Custom House and opened them, and <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> mine, and {{immediately}} went to sleep.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a chair, and Mr. Stillwell {{began to}} look over his letters. I {{wondered}} what would happen next, but I was not quite prepared for what did happen.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sit down," [...] {{she said}} and dropped into a chair against the light, looking away from me across the wide green space of {{afternoon}} sunshine. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a little sofa, at a loss also.|$|R
60|$|A rabbit came {{bounding}} {{across the}} hill {{between us and}} the house. I threw down my suit-case and pursued it hotfoot. After I had run twenty yards and seen it disappear, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grass and wept disconsolately.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{rocks to}} take, not a sketch,--for who can sketch a {{mountain}} torrent?--but to note {{down on paper}} a kind of diagram, from which afterwards I might reconstruct an image of this feathery, frisky son of Kuhleborn.|$|E
60|$|His manner {{surprised}} me; {{he did not}} {{now seem}} like the Marcos Marcó I had travelled with that day. Touched with his words, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stocks facing him, and begged him {{to tell me what}} I could do for him.|$|E
60|$|It was {{of small}} use {{to follow him}} further, so <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a {{prostrate}} yellow birch to rest and listen awhile in the vast silence, and to watch anything that might be passing through the cold white woods.|$|R
60|$|That was interesting; so <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a rock to watch. Whenever I took my {{eyes from}} him a moment, it was {{difficult}} to find him again, so perfectly did his plumage blend with the white ice upon which he stood motionless.|$|R
60|$|He muttered {{through his}} teeth, “Mal. Je ne dors plus.” He moved off {{to stand at}} the window {{with his back to the}} room. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a sofa that was there and put my feet up, and silence took {{possession}} of the room.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sofa beside her, {{and told}} her all, without one word of excuse or concealment, from our last parting to the day of Césarine's death in Haiti: and she held my hand and listened all the while with breathless wonderment to my strange story.|$|E
60|$|Tears were in Maud’s eyes, and I {{do believe}} they were for me. I could have wept myself. Where now was our project of remasting the Ghost? He had done his work well. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hatch-combing and rested my chin on my hands in black despair.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{stool and}} opened my note-book. I headed the page: [...] "Sunrise in July: {{observations}} and emotions," [...] and I wrote down at once, lest I should forget it, that towards three o'clock a faint light is discernible, {{and added that}} this light gets stronger as the time goes on.|$|E
60|$|Then {{he turned}} and left me and I entered the house where I found my mother sitting, still in her festal robes, like one who waits. She looked at my face, then asked what troubled me. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a stool at her feet and told her everything.|$|R
6000|$|... "I haven't done {{anything}} with it. Nadel {{thought he would}} take hold of it at one time, but he dropped it again. After all, I don't suppose it could be popularized. Fulkerson wanted to offer it as a premium to subscribers for 'Every Other Week,' but <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> that." ...|$|R
6000|$|He left us. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> one of {{the chairs}} in the hall, and did my best to compose myself. Benjamin walked to and fro, deep in thought. [...] "Both of them fond of him," [...] I heard my old friend say to himself. [...] "Half monkey, half man--and both of them fond of him. That beats me." ...|$|R
6000|$|So <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{stone steps}} of a building. Five minutes later a {{policeman}} was looking at me. My eyes were wide open, so he only grunted and passed on. Ten minutes later my head was on my knees, I was dozing, and the same policeman was saying gruffly, [...] "'Ere, you, get outa that!" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{grass in}} front of her, feeling as I did so that the change of {{position}} in a manner clipped my wings. It is difficult to speak movingly while sitting on the ground. Instinctively I avoided eloquence. Standing up, I might have been pathetic and pleading. Sitting down, I was compelled to be matter-of-fact.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sofa, on the {{cushions}} covered with {{blue and red}} checks. The room was very hot, and I stared about uncomfortably. The old lady sat peering at nothing, in reverie. She was a hard-visaged, bosomless dame, clad in thick black cloth-like armour, and wearing an immense twisted gold brooch in the lace at her neck.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> an {{old wooden}} settle, carved all over like a bench on the Battery. At one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning {{it with his}} jack-knife, stooping over and {{diligently}} working away at the space between his legs. He was trying his hand at a ship under full sail, but he didn't make much headway, I thought.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{opened the}} street door {{and went up}} stairs, and heard him {{sleeping}} his heavy sleep, exactly as I had heard him when I went out. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> my bed and took off my bonnet, quite quiet in myself, because I knew it was to be. I damped the towel, and put it ready, and took a turn in the room.|$|R
60|$|With such comfort {{as these}} words afforded I {{returned}} to the music-room, and, finding it empty, {{went out to the}} terrace, where the others were now strolling about in knots and couples, conversing and enjoying the lovely moonlight. Wandering a little distance away by myself, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a bench under a tree, and presently Yoletta came to me there, and closely scrutinized my face.|$|R
60|$|Aunt Olivia {{went into}} the parlour, settled herself in the old carved chair, and folded her hands. Peggy and <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stairs to await his coming in a {{crisping}} suspense. Aunt Olivia's kitten, a fat, bewhiskered creature, looking {{as if it were}} cut out of black velvet, shared our vigil and purred in maddening peace of mind.|$|E
6000|$|What I {{really needed}} {{was to be}} alone for a bit. I seized this opening hastily. My bedroom was a quiet refuge in an {{apparently}} uninhabited wing of the building. Having {{absolutely nothing to do}} (for I had not unpacked my things), <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bed and abandoned myself to the influences of the hour. To the unexpected influences. [...] .|$|E
6000|$|I crept to {{the side}} of Cleopatra, and, now that none were left to see, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bed and laid her head upon my knee, as once before it had been laid in that night of sacrilege beneath the shadow of the {{everlasting}} pyramid. Then I kissed her chill brow and went from the House of Death--avenged, but sorely smitten with despair! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{come back}} to the old bunk, you see," [...] he continued, while <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a chest which served for a chair. [...] "I likes the Home better an' better every time I comes to it, and I've brought all my crew with me; for you see, sir, the `Coffin's' a'most fallin' to pieces, and will have to go into dock for a riglar overhaul." ...|$|R
60|$|Feeling much depressed, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a wet stone, in my wet garments, and lunched off a moist biscuit, a {{piece of}} tongue, and a lump of cheese. This was consoling, {{as far as it}} went, but it did not go far. The misty clouds obliterated the mountains, the rain drizzled from the skies, percolated through the brim of my hat, trickled down my nose, and dropped upon my luncheon.|$|R
60|$|Nothing {{less than}} two fat sweltering one-pound notes {{that seemed to have}} been on terms of the warmest {{intimacy}} with all the cattle-markets in the county. Joe caught up his hat again, and ran with them to the Jolly Bargemen to restore them to their owner. While he was gone, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> my usual stool and looked vacantly at my sister, feeling pretty sure that the man would not be there.|$|R
6000|$|There was a sergeant, reading, {{in one of}} the fireside groups. As {{he was a man of}} very {{intelligent}} countenance, and as I have a great respect for non-commissioned officers as a class, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> nearest bed, to have some talk with him. (It was the bed of one of the grisliest of the poor skeletons, and he died soon afterwards.) ...|$|E
60|$|But I saw {{she was not}} {{thinking}} of apricots. She was staring absently, thoughtfully; as I came near her I perceived {{that she had been}} crying. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bench beside her before she saw me; then, when she had done so, she simply turned round, without surprise, and rested her sad eyes upon me. Something very bad indeed had happened; she was completely changed.|$|E
60|$|Next I rose stiffly upright, ensanguined, {{with wild}} gasps of thankfulness, {{and sent a}} hoarse cry ringing across the woods, after which <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fur and stabbed the lifeless brute twice again, for I {{was filled with a}} childish fear that even now it might escape me. This was needless, and even barbarous, but to one in my {{position}} it was natural.|$|E
60|$|As {{he entered}} the roofless inclosure, he reverently removed his hat. It was {{impossible}} for me to follow him any further, without exposing myself to the risk of discovery. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> one of the fallen stones, waiting to see him again. It must have been at least half an hour before he appeared. He thanked me for my kindness, as composedly as if he had quite expected to find me in the place that I occupied.|$|R
60|$|As soon as I {{saw that}} his eyes were shut <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a box to think. To tell the truth, I was not {{altogether}} happy in my mind. To begin with I {{did not know how}} the twenty bearers would behave under fire. They might be seized with panic and rush about, in which case I determined to let them out of the boma to take their chance, for panic is a catching thing.|$|R
60|$|What {{was it in}} the air? What {{sense of}} fear brooded here and whispered in the alder leaves and tinkled in the brook? Simmo grew uneasy and hurried away. He was like the wood folk. But <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a great log that the spring floods had driven in through the alders to feel {{the meaning of the}} place, if possible, and to have the vast sweet {{solitude}} all to myself for a little while.|$|R
