5000|$|However, {{domestic}} <b>first</b> <b>class</b> {{does have}} {{two very different}} meanings on certain transcontinental routes between New York City and California. Delta Airlines, American Airlines, United Airlines, and JetBlue operate a special service on flights between John F. Kennedy International Airport and San Francisco International Airport or Los Angeles International Airport known as [...] "Delta Transcontinental Service," [...] "American flagship service", [...] "United p.s." [...] (p.s. stands for premium service), and [...] "Mint," [...] respectively, with Delta and United using specially configured Boeing 757-200s and American and JetBlue using Airbus A321s. In the cases of American and JetBlue, <b>first</b> <b>class</b> is actually a three-cabin <b>first</b> <b>class</b> which is different from two-cabin <b>first</b> <b>class,</b> both in comfort and price (such as lie flat seats in <b>first</b> <b>class,</b> for example). In these cases, domestic business class is generally slightly higher than a two-cabin domestic <b>first</b> <b>class</b> ticket. The three-cabin <b>first</b> <b>class</b> {{is more of a}} true <b>first</b> <b>class</b> rather than a rebranded business class. On JetBlue however, <b>first</b> <b>class</b> is only offered on transcontinental flights, consisting of mini suites or lie-flat seats.|$|R

5000|$|On busy {{commuter}} services <b>First</b> <b>Class</b> seating {{is similar}} or identical to Standard class. However its much higher cost ensures the <b>First</b> <b>Class</b> ticket holder {{a better chance}} of finding a seat. Some Train Operating Companies offer <b>First</b> <b>Class</b> fares that are often nearly double the fare of Standard class. On some services despite the existence of a <b>first</b> <b>class</b> cabin, it is [...] "declassified" [...] indicating that any ticket holder may sit there, and <b>first</b> <b>class</b> tickets are usually not sold.|$|R

5000|$|... for all [...] Note {{that the}} only {{quantities}} that weakly vanish are the constraints , and therefore anything that weakly vanishes must be strongly equal to a linear combination of the constraints. One can demonstrate that the Poisson bracket of two <b>first</b> <b>class</b> quantities must also be <b>first</b> <b>class.</b> The <b>first</b> <b>class</b> constraints are intimately connected with the unphysical degrees of freedom mentioned earlier. Namely, the number of independent <b>first</b> <b>class</b> constraints {{is equal to the}} number of unphysical degrees of freedom, and furthermore the primary <b>first</b> <b>class</b> constraints generate gauge transformations. Dirac further postulated that all secondary <b>first</b> <b>class</b> constraints are generators of gauge transformations, which turns out to be false; however, typically one operates under the assumption that all <b>first</b> <b>class</b> constraints generate gauge transformations when using this treatment.|$|R

50|$|<b>First</b> <b>class</b> is {{a travel}} class on some {{passenger}} airliners {{intended to be}} more luxurious than business class, premium economy, and economy class. On a passenger jetliner, <b>first</b> <b>class</b> usually refers to a limited number (rarely more than 20) of seats or cabins {{toward the front of}} the aircraft which have more space, comfort, service, and privacy. In general, <b>first</b> <b>class</b> is the highest class offered, although some airlines have branded their new products as above <b>first</b> <b>class.</b> Propeller airliners often had <b>first</b> <b>class</b> in the rear, away from the noise of the rotating propeller.|$|R
50|$|Mumbai {{railways}} offer <b>first</b> <b>class</b> commuter transport. <b>First</b> <b>class</b> fares {{are approximately}} 10 times the second class fare and therefore {{tend to be}} less crowded in the non rush hour period. <b>First</b> <b>class</b> compartments also have slightly better seats than second class. less crowded compartments during non peak hours, the <b>first</b> <b>class</b> compartments are rather more crowded during the peak hour time, as there is a large supply and demand gap.Its notoriously hard to get into the <b>first</b> <b>class</b> compartment as the coach is overcrowded with people hanging out of the doors.|$|R
50|$|The {{units have}} <b>first</b> <b>class</b> and Standard class accommodation: the four-car sets can {{accommodate}} up to 175 standard class passengers, {{with up to}} 239 in the five-car sets. <b>First</b> <b>class</b> accommodation is {{in one of the}} driving cars, referred to as 'DMF' (Driving-Motor-First) cars. The <b>first</b> <b>class</b> cars have two different layouts: 332002, 332004 and the five-car sets can accommodate up to 26 <b>first</b> <b>class</b> passengers, while in the other four-car sets up to 14 <b>first</b> <b>class</b> passengers can be accommodated due to the checked luggage compartments installed in some DMF cars in 1999.|$|R
50|$|Since the 1990s, a trend {{developed}} {{in which many}} airlines eliminated <b>first</b> <b>class</b> sections in favour of an upgraded business class. Newer business class seating is increasing adding features previously exclusive to <b>first</b> <b>class</b> such as convertible lie-flat seats, narrowing the amenities gap to an extent that <b>first</b> <b>class</b> is redundant. Furthermore, with the late 2000s recession, airlines have removed or not installed <b>first</b> <b>class</b> seating in their aircraft, as <b>first</b> <b>class</b> seats are usually double the price of business class but can take up {{more than twice the}} room, leaving business class the most expensive seats on such planes. However some, such as Garuda Indonesia, have opted to reintroduce <b>first</b> <b>class</b> seating sections with new aircraft.|$|R

50|$|As {{a general}} rule, <b>first</b> <b>class</b> items {{represent}} things rather than relationships. For example, the database representations {{of a human}} and of a company are each <b>first</b> <b>class</b> items. However, {{the fact that the}} person is an employee of that company is not a <b>first</b> <b>class</b> item. Likewise, data about that relationship, e.g. information about the salary the company pays to its employee, is not a <b>first</b> <b>class</b> item.|$|R
50|$|Similarly to Germany, Dutch trains {{have had}} two classes since 1956. Currently, only trains running on the Merwedelingelijn and the line Zutphen - Oldenzaal have no <b>first</b> <b>class</b> seats. On two lines in Friesland there are no <b>first</b> <b>class</b> tickets, but the trains (which are also used on lines with <b>first</b> <b>class</b> tickets) do have <b>first</b> <b>class</b> seats. On most {{regional}} and local trains, the difference between second and <b>first</b> <b>class</b> is in only the padding of the seats, an additional armrest, decorative lighting or larger tables. In most cases, the <b>first</b> <b>class</b> in the trains is situated right behind the cabin, preventing others from walking through. On Intercity trains, <b>first</b> <b>class</b> has a 2+1 seating, as opposed to 2+2 in second class, can recline and feature a feet rest in coach seating. Most Intercity trains {{have only a few}} power sockets in <b>first</b> <b>class,</b> but {{this is due to the}} fact that providing a large number of power sockets would require significant modifications to the electrical system. All trains produced after 2015 have power and/or USB sockets in both classes.|$|R
5000|$|For many airlines, a <b>first</b> <b>class</b> lounge {{will also}} be offered to {{international}} <b>first</b> <b>class</b> and top-tier passengers. <b>First</b> <b>class</b> lounges are usually more exclusive and will feature extra amenities over business class that are {{more in line with}} the European/Asian concept of an airport lounge. In the few cases where an amenity is offered only in the business <b>class</b> lounge, <b>first</b> <b>class</b> passengers are permitted to use the business lounge if they wish. In any case, anyone with <b>first</b> <b>class</b> lounge access almost automatically has access to the business class lounge—such as if a traveling companion is not in <b>first</b> <b>class</b> and cannot be brought into the <b>first</b> <b>class</b> lounge as a guest—though lounge agents may get confused when passengers choose to use a lesser amenity than that to which they are entitled. In most cases, airlines will offer <b>first</b> <b>class</b> passengers a free pass to their standard airport club. Some airlines offer [...] "arrival lounges" [...] for passengers to shower, rest, and eat after a long-haul international flight.|$|R
2500|$|<b>First</b> <b>Class</b> {{is offered}} on most {{long-haul}} aircraft (Airbus A330-300, A340-600, the front {{part of the}} upper deck of all Airbus A380s, and the main deck nose section of all Boeing 747–8s). Each seat converts to a [...] bed, includes laptop power outlets, as well as entertainment facilities. Meals are available on demand. Lufthansa offers dedicated <b>First</b> <b>Class</b> check-in counters at most airports, and offers dedicated <b>First</b> <b>Class</b> lounges in Frankfurt and Munich, {{as well as a}} dedicated <b>first</b> <b>class</b> terminal in Frankfurt. Arriving passengers have the option of using Lufthansa's <b>First</b> <b>Class</b> arrival facilities, as well as the new Welcome Lounge. Lufthansa has introduced a new <b>First</b> <b>Class</b> product aboard the Airbus A380 and plans to gradually introduce it on all of its long-haul aircraft.|$|R
