50|$|From {{the gun in}} the final, American Leshon Collins {{got some}} {{separation}} from Canada's Akeem Haynes. Also gaining an advantage on the stagger was Chijindu Ujah, the British leadoff as the gap to China's Tang Xingqiang and Barbados' Mario Burke shrunk. Down the backstretch, Britain's Zharnel Hughes and American Mike Rodgers didn't gain against China's Xie Zhenye, who gained a step on Ramon Gittens to his outside. The second Canadian exchange between Aaron Brown and Brendon Rodney was an adventure, with Rodney hopping up and down leaving the zone without the baton. Through the second turn, American Ronnie Baker gained a little on Britain's Daniel Talbot and China's sub-10 star, Su Bingtian to take a slight lead into the final handoff. Britain's Ojie Edoburun reached back for the baton first but came up empty handed. The American handoff was more awkward as Justin Gatlin slowed and grabbed twice to finally get the baton in hand. China's final exchange was also awkward as Su ran up on Liang Jinsheng, finally getting a successful handoff but behind a step, as USA {{came out with the}} baton in first. With the advantage, the Olympic silver medalist sped away to a huge victory. Farther behind, Netherlands also failed to get the handoff between Solomon Bockarie and Hensley Paulina. Two steps behind China, Barbados made a clean exchange between Nicholas Deshong and Burkheart Ellis. As expected, Liang was losing ground to Gatlin, behind him, reminiscent of Bob Hayes in Tokyo, a gangly running Ellis was gaining on every step, Barbados overtaking China a step out, accentuated by a <b>dip</b> <b>finish.</b>|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} is to {{incorporate}} a novel, universal functional group into textile colorants and finishes that leads to high-yield add-on and then permanency via thermally-induced covalent bond formation in a second processing step. The goal will be accomplished by using a novel reactive ionic functional group that will lend high substantivity to a textile chemical via complementary electrostatic attractions (i. e., ionic bonds) which can be thermally converted to covalent bonds. The first step will be to incorporate one of these novel functional groups into an appropriate textile chemical. The textile chemical containing the reactive ionic group will be applied and the application conditions will be optimized. We have successfully prepared {{two different types of}} reactive ionic finishes and applied these to cotton fabrics. Beginning with octadecyl alcohol, trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride was used to prepare an octadecyltriflate intermediate which was then reacted with N-phenyl pyrrolidine (NPP) to give the octadecyl-NPP quaternary salt, a reactive ionic wax, in 90 % yield. This reactive ionic wax was applied to a bleached cotton sateen fabric (10 % owf) after first activating the surface hydroxyl groups by a caustic <b>dip.</b> The <b>finished</b> fabric was then placed in an oven at 75 ºC for 10 minutes to initiate the ring-opening covalent fixation of the reactive ionic wax to the substrate. This was followed by vigorous washing of the finished fabric with organic solvents for the reactive ionic wax. The finished fabrics exhibited significantly increased water droplet wetting times. The same general protocol was followed to prepare a reactive ionic silicone finish beginning with hydroxy-end-functionalized poly(dimethylsiloxane). These reactive ionic finishes can be applied to negatively charged substrates with high-yield add-on since they contain positively charged cyclic ammonium groups, which disappear by thermally-induced ring opening to yield permanent covalent linkages...|$|R
40|$|Natural {{rubber latex}} (NRL) allergy {{is caused by}} the {{extractable}} latex proteins in dipped rubber products. It is a major concern for the consumers who are sensitive to the allergenic extractable proteins (EP) in products such as NRL gloves. Objective of this research was to develop an economical method to reduce the EP in <b>finished</b> <b>dipped</b> NRL products. In order to reduce the EP levels, two natural proteases, bromelain from pineapple and papain from papaya, were extracted and partially purified using (NH 4) 2 SO 4. According to the newly developed method, different glove samples were treated with a 5 % solution of each partially purified enzyme, for 2 hours at 60 °C. Residual amounts of in treated samples were quantified using the modified Lowry assay (ASTM D 5712 - 10). Bromelain displayed a 54 (± 11) % reduction of the EP from the dipped rubber products, whereas it was 58 (± 8) % with papain. These results clearly indicate that the selected natural proteases, bromelain, and papain contribute significantly towards the reduction of the total EP in finished NRL products. Application of bromelain enzyme for the aforementioned purpose has not been reported up to date, whereas papain has been used to treat raw NRL towards reducing the EP...|$|R
