5|$|The {{election}} {{was conducted by}} voice vote, a qualified elector would tell the returning officer at a polling station who he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> and the results would be tallied. Under {{the terms of the}} Act eligible electors were males who had reached the age of majority, which was 21 years of age at that time. The act specified that electors must be bona fide males who were not aliens or unenfranchised Indians. Electors must also have resided in the territory for at least 12 months to the day of the writ being dropped.|$|E

He donated to Obama's presidential campaign in 2007, and hosted two fundraisers for the candidate during the 2008 Democratic Primary. Affleck urged voters to [...] "help make history" [...] in a MoveOn.org campaign, and made several appearances during the 2008 Democratic National Convention. In the week of the presidential election, he appeared on Saturday Night Live to jokingly endorse Senator John McCain. Affleck did not actively campaign for Obama's reelection in 2012, but stated: [...] "I like the president, I’m <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> the president." ...|$|E
50|$|After the election, however, {{he joined}} with Senator Samuel Smith of Maryland {{and his brother}} Robert Smith, the Secretary of State, in criticizing Madison; first as too weak on Britain and then, in 1812, as too {{precipitate}} in <b>going</b> <b>to</b> war; however, <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> the declaration of war. He particularly disliked Albert Gallatin, the Secretary of the Treasury, and was largely responsible for preventing his nomination as Secretary of State and for defeating Gallatin's bill of 1811 for a new Bank of the United States.|$|R
50|$|Taking place a {{year before}} the presidential {{election}} scheduled on March 2, 2008, the St. Petersburg protest also came ahead of the local elections to the Saint Petersburg Legislative Assembly to be held on March 11, 2007. While leaders of Communist party and democratic Union of Right Forces which were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> contest <b>for</b> <b>votes</b> didn't take part in the march (as well as other major parties), the action was joined by St. Petersburg department of social-liberal party Yabloko which had been eliminated from the upcoming local legislative election for technical reasons earlier in February.|$|R
6000|$|I {{went with}} Denison {{and another man}} named Jeffreys between eleven [...] and twelve. We began {{to talk to some}} men among Weyland's friends; [...] they crowded round, and began to holloa at us, and were making a [...] sort of ring round us preparatory to a desperate hustle, when lo! [...] up rushed a body of Norreys' men from St. Thomas's, broke their [...] ranks, raised a shout, and rescued us in great style. I shall ever [...] be {{grateful}} to the men of St. Thomas's. When we were talking, [...] Jeffreys said something which made one man holloa, 'Oh, his [...] father's a parson.' This happened to be true, and flabbergasted me, [...] but he happily turned it by reminding them, that they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> [...] <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> Mr. Harcourt, son of the greatest parson in England but [...] one (Archbishop of York). Afterwards they left me, and I pursued my [...] work alone, conversed with a great number, shook hands with a fair [...] proportion, made some laugh, and once very nearly got hustled when [...] alone, but happily escaped. You would be beyond measure astonished [...] how unanimous and how strong is the feeling among the freeholders [...] (who may be taken as a fair specimen of the generality of all [...] counties) against the catholic question. Reformers and [...] anti-reformers were alike sensitive on that point and perfectly [...] agreed. One man said <b>to</b> me, 'What, <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> Lord Norreys? Why, he [...] voted against the country both times, for the Catholic bill and [...] then against the Reform.' What would this atrocious ministry have [...] said had the appeal to the voice of the people, which they now [...] quote as their authority, been made in 1829? I held forth to a [...] working man, possibly a forty-shilling freeholder, [he adds in a [...] fragment of later years,] on the established text, reform was [...] revolution. To corroborate my doctrine I said, 'Why, look at the [...] revolutions in foreign countries,' meaning of course France and [...] Belgium. The man looked hard at me and said these very words, 'Damn [...] all foreign countries, what has old England to do with foreign [...] countries?' This is not the only time that I have received an [...] important lesson from a humble source.|$|R

2500|$|From {{an early}} age, Alice was {{interested}} in politics. When advancing age and illness incapacitated her Aunt Bamie, Alice stepped into her place as an unofficial political adviser to her father. She warned her father against challenging the renomination of William Howard Taft in 1912. Alice took a hard-line view of the Democrats and in her youth sympathized with the conservative wing of the Republican Party. She supported her half-brother Ted {{when he ran for}} governor of New York in 1924. When Franklin D. Roosevelt ran for president in [...] 1932, Alice publicly opposed his candidacy. Writing in the Ladies' Home Journal in October 1932, she said of FDR, [...] "Politically, his branch of the family and ours have always been in different camps, and the same surname is about all we have in common..... I am a Republican..... I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> Hoover..... If I were not a Republican, I would still vote for Mr. Hoover this time." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1965, Hitchens {{joined the}} Labour Party {{on the very}} first day he was {{eligible}} to vote, but along with the majority of the Labour students' organization was expelled in 1967, because of what Hitchens called [...] "Prime Minister Harold Wilson's contemptible support for the war in Vietnam". Since then he stated he had [...] "re-enlisted a few times" [...] back into the Labour Party. In a 2001 interview with Reason, he said, in 1979, that even though {{he was a member of}} the Labour Party, that he wasn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> the Labour Party, nor could he bring himself to [...] "vote conservative." [...] He didn't vote at all in that election. He also stated that by not voting for the Labour Party he was effectively voting for Margaret Thatcher to win, which he said he had [...] "secretly hoped would happen." [...] In a 2005 Vanity Fair article, he endorsed Tony Blair in the 2005 general election, mainly due to his support for the 2003 invasion of Iraq. In a 2009 Slate article, he described that in the late 1970s the Labour Party moved to the right and stated that the downfall of the Labour Party was when Gordon Brown became the Prime Minister.|$|E
5000|$|In a November 2016 {{interview}} with The Washington Post, Horner expressed regret {{for the role}} his fake news stories played in the election and surprise at how gullible people were in treating his stories as news. In February 2017 Horner said, [...] "I truly regret my comment about saying that I think Donald Trump is in the White House because of me. I know all I did was attack him and his supporters and got people not <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> him. When I said that comment it was because I was confused how this evil got elected President and I thought maybe instead of hurting his campaign, maybe I had helped it. My intention was to get his supporters NOT <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> him and I {{know for a fact}} that I accomplished that goal. The far right, a lot of the Bible thumpers and alt right were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> him regardless, but I know I swayed so many that were on the fence." ...|$|R

50|$|Week 1 - Selena (3-2): At the elimination, it {{came down}} to Hamish from the Blue Team and Selena from the White Team. The Black and Red teams were offered the option {{following}} <b>voting</b> <b>to</b> save both and not eliminate anyone, but only if it was a unanimous vote. Both Alex and Graham from the Black team abstained, but everyone else chose <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> (though it is implied that everyone, with the exception of Margie, were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> on not sending anyone home). After Margie was the first <b>to</b> choose <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> (<b>for</b> Selena), and Lisa tied it by <b>voting</b> <b>for</b> Hamish and Brenda and Simon respectively continued the trend, Selena's third vote came from Shane. Because she had the lowest percentage of weight loss, there was no need <b>for</b> Lydia's <b>vote</b> <b>to</b> be revealed. After elimination, when the trainers returned, they all told Margie that they never gave up on anyone and the Commando told Margie should start learning the stories of other contestants.|$|R

6000|$|The {{next day}} Mr. Hopkins {{scattered}} flaring hand-bills over the district which were worded {{in a way}} designed to offset any advantage his opponent had gained from the lawn fête of the previous day. They read: [...] "Hopkins, the Man of the Times, is the Champion of the Signs of the Times. Forbes, who never earned a dollar in his life, but inherited his money, is {{trying to take the}} dollars out of the pockets of the farmers by depriving them of the income derived by selling spaces for advertising signs. He is robbing the farmers while claiming he wants to beautify their homes. The farmers can't eat beauty; they want money. Therefore they are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> the Honorable Erastus Hopkins for Representative." [...] Then followed an estimate of the money paid the farmers of the district by the advertisers during the past five years, amounting to several thousands of dollars in the aggregate. The circular ended in this way: [...] "Hopkins challenges Forbes to deny these facts. Hopkins is willing to meet Forbes before the public at any time and place he may select, to settle this argument in joint debate." ...|$|E

40|$|Three senior {{researchers}} from the Pew Research Centre suggest three possible reasons why US polls failed to predict {{the outcome of the}} 2016 Presidential election, including: 	nonresponse bias: which occurs when certain kinds of people systematically do not respond to surveys despite equal opportunity outreach to all parts of the electorate; 	“shy Trumpers”: suggests that support for Trump was socially undesirable, and that his supporters were unwilling to admit their support to pollsters; and 	the way pollsters identify likely voters: because voting is non-compulsory in the US, pollsters can’t know in advance who is actually <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote,</b> so they develop models predicting who is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> and what the electorate will look like on election day.  ...|$|R

6000|$|Meanwhile the disquieting rumors {{continued}} to come in. Jabez Miller, {{on the north}} slope, had told Samuel Todd, who told Ephraim Williams, that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> Fletcher. Moses Hatch hitched up his team {{and went out to}} see Jabez, spent an hour in general conversation, and then plumped the question, taking, as he said, that means of finding out. Jabez hemmed and hawed, said his farm was mortgaged; spoke at some length about the American citizen, however humble, having a right to vote as he chose. A most unusual line for Jabez, and the whole matter very mysterious and not a little ominous. Moses drove homeward that sparkling day, shutting his eyes to the glare of the ice crystals on the pines, and thinking profoundly. He made other excursions, enough to satisfy himself that this disease, so new and unheard of (the right of the unfit to hold office), actually existed. Where the germ began that caused it, Moses knew no better than the deacon, since those who were suspected of leanings toward Fletcher Bartlett were strangely secretive. The practical result of Moses' profound thought was a meeting, in his own house, without respect to party, Democrats and Whigs alike, opened by a prayer from the minister himself. The meeting, after a futile session, broke up dismally. Sedition and conspiracy existed; a chief offender and master mind there was, somewhere. But who was he? ...|$|E

40|$|Leading {{up to the}} 2008 U. S. election, pundits {{wondered}} whether Whites, particularly in Southern states, were ready <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> a Black president. The present paper explores how a common Southern symbol—the Confederate flag—impacted willingness <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> Barack Obama. We predicted that exposure to the Confederate flag would activate nega-tivity toward Blacks and result in lowered willingness <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> Obama. As predicted, participants primed with the Confederate flag reported less willingness <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> Obama than those primed with a neutral symbol. The flag did not affect willingness <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> White candidates. In a second study, participants primed with the Confederate flag evalu-ated a hypothetical Black target more negatively than controls. These results suggest that exposure to the Confederate flag results in more negative judgments of Black targets. As such, the prevalence of this flag in the South {{may have contributed to}} a reticence <b>for</b> some <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> Obama because of his race...|$|R
