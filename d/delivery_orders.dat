40|$|A flush channel {{offers the}} implementor of a {{distributed}} application {{the flexibility of}} specifying a message <b>delivery</b> <b>order</b> apropos of {{the demands of the}} application. This stands in marked contrast to the rigid FIFO (first-in-first-out) <b>delivery</b> <b>order</b> of communication with a FIFO channel. The more restrictive the <b>delivery</b> <b>order,</b> the less concurrency possible to exploit in message transmissions over a multi-path system. This paper investigates the possible gain in effective network bandwidth when a large amount of information, such as the transmission of image data, is transmitted over a multi-path flush channel as compared to a multi-path FIFO channel. Analytical and simulation results illustrate that the relaxed <b>delivery</b> <b>order</b> restrictions of the flush channel may reduce the mean message response time by a factor of the number of message fragments. This difference may be critical in meeting real-time requirements of an application...|$|R
