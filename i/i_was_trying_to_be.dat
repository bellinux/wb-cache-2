Following the release of We Are Born, Sia decided to retire from the career as a recording artist and established {{a career as a}} songwriter. She wrote the song [...] "Titanium" [...] for American singer Alicia Keys, but it was later sent to David Guetta, who included Sia's original demo vocals on the song and released it as a single in 2011. [...] "Titanium" [...] was a commercial success worldwide, peaking within the top five of record charts in the United States, Australia and numerous European regions. However, Sia was not pleased with the success of the single: [...] " [...] I never even knew it was gonna happen, and I was really upset.

500|$|Despite the band's {{annoyance}} {{at having}} {{so little time}} to prepare, the Kingsmen walked into the recording studio on April 6 at 10:00am. In order {{to sound like a}} live performance, the group's equipment was arranged such that Ely was forced to lean back and sing into a boom microphone suspended high above the floor. [...] "It was more yelling than singing," [...] Ely said, [...] "'cause <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> heard over all the instruments." [...] In addition, he was wearing braces {{at the time of the}} performance, further compounding his infamously slurred words. Ely sang the beginning of the third verse a few bars too early, but realized his mistake and waited for the rest of the band to catch up. In what was thought to be a warm-up, the song was recorded in its first and only take. The Kingsmen were not proud of the version, but their manager liked the rawness of their cover. The B-side was [...] "Haunted Castle", composed by Ely and Don Gallucci, the new keyboardist. However, credit was given to Lynn Easton on both the Jerden and Wand labels. [...] The entire session cost $50, and the band split the difference.|$|E

He began photographing in Chicago parks and a farm owned by his aunt, and developed his own film and prints. Later he would remember that even at that early age his work showed strong artistic merit. He said, [...] "I feel that my earliest work of 1903 ‒ though immature ‒ is related more closely, both with technique and composition, to my latest work than are several of my photographs dating from 1913–1920, a period in which <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> artistic." ...|$|E

[...] Others were quick to point out striking resemblances of Palin to actress Tina Fey, who would impersonate her on Saturday Night Live, and Peggy Hill, a character on Fox Network's cartoon series King of the Hill.

2500|$|Lynch got {{approval}} from Propaganda to switch projects; however, production {{was scheduled to}} begin {{two months after the}} rights had been purchased, forcing the director to work fast. He had Cage and Dern read Gifford's book and wrote a draft in a week. By Lynch's own admission, his first draft was [...] "depressing and pretty much devoid of happiness, and no one wanted to make it". Lynch did not like the ending in Gifford’s book where Sailor and Lula split up for good. For Lynch, [...] "it honestly didn’t seem real, considering the way they felt about each other. It didn’t seem one bit real! It had a certain coolness, but I couldn’t see it". It was at this point that the director's love of The Wizard of Oz (1939) began to influence the script he was writing and he included a reference to the [...] "yellow brick road". Lynch remembers, [...] "It was an awful tough world and there was something about Sailor being a rebel. But a rebel with a dream of the Wizard of Oz is kinda like a beautiful thing". Samuel Goldwyn, Jr. read an early draft of the screenplay and did not like Gifford’s ending either, so Lynch changed it. However, the director was worried that this change made the film too commercial, [...] "much more commercial to make a happy ending yet, if I had not changed it, so that people wouldn’t say <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> commercial, I would have been untrue to what the material was saying".|$|E
