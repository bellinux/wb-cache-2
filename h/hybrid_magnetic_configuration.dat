The <b>hybrid</b> factor {{is defined as}} the ratio of the force produced by the permanent magnet and the forces produced by the permanent magnet and current in <b>hybrid</b> <b>magnetic</b> bearing. It is deduced from a certain radial <b>hybrid</b> <b>magnetic</b> bearing using its important parameters such as the current stiffness and displacement stiffness at first and then the dynamic model of magnetically suspended rotor system is established. The relationship between structural parameters and control system parameters is analyzed based on the hybrid factor. Some influencing factors of hybrid factor in <b>hybrid</b> <b>magnetic</b> bearing, such as the size of the permanent magnet, length of air gap, and area of the stator poles, are analyzed in this article. It can be concluded that larger hybrid factor can be caused by the smaller power loss according to the definition of hybrid factor mentioned above. Meanwhile, the hybrid factor has a maximum value, which is related to control system parameters such as proportional factor expect for structural parameters.

40|$|Stellarators {{commonly}} comprise {{different sets}} of coils to produce diverse <b>magnetic</b> <b>configurations.</b> However, the diversity of possible configurations in a single device is usually rather limited. The achievement of a broad variety of <b>magnetic</b> <b>configurations</b> might be valuable for some purposes, for example, to assay {{the effect of the}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>configuration</b> on turbulent transport. Thus, a method is created to systematically define sets of modular coils located on concentric toroidal winding surfaces. The method is based on the expression of a Last Closed Flux Surface (LCFS) by Fourier coefficients in cylindrical coordinates and consists in the definition of successive windings located on equidistant concentric winding surfaces, each winding such that produces a magnetic field which, when added to the magnetic field generated by a sole base winding that generates a base <b>magnetic</b> <b>configuration,</b> produces a <b>magnetic</b> <b>configuration</b> whose LCFS is defined by the Fourier coefficients of the base <b>magnetic</b> <b>configuration</b> plus only one new Fourier coefficient. The utilization of a diversity of currents in the different windings would give a linear combination of magnetic fields that reproduce the LCFS defined mathematically by the respective Fourier coefficients. The deviation between a particular modelled LCFS and the obtained LCFS from the windings depends on: the order and value of each Fourier coefficient, the selected shape of concentric winding surfaces, and the possible intersection of the LCFS with the internal winding surface. The method to generate the windings is reported and the application to one case study is described. Each modelled LCFS is compared with the respective Poincaré plot obtained from the linear combination of magnetic fields from the windings. Comment: 7 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
