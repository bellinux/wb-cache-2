40|$|The {{focus of}} system theory {{to date is}} mainly local, {{developing}} the complex self-organising characteristics of <b>intraconnection</b> but with interconnection to an independent environ-ment. Now with the increasing importance of interoperation of global systems the spot-light has to be broadened on to non-local activities in system theory {{and the role of}} systems that are not just open but also free. Non-locality requires closer attention to fun-damental definitions which can no longer rely on local assumptions found currently in Gen-eral Information Theory. Category theory recommended by Robert Rosen as a mod-ern tool for living systems is found to have a formal expressive power as process be-yond modelling for exploring the fundamen-tal non-local concept of adjointness needed to understand advanced systems. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{advent of}} very large scale {{integration}} will require substantial progress {{in all aspects}} of silicon technology: processing, lithography, modeling, design tools, chip architecture, and applications This paper will survey current trends in silicon integrated circuit fabrication, focusing on new developments and outstanding problems. Progress in both bipolar and MOSFET technologies will be considered. Silicon fabrication techniques will be described in terms of the repetitious application of operations that are additive (oxidation, doping, deposition), selective (lithography), and subtractive (etching). The objective of these operations is a reliable and predictable device structure. Device structures will be described in terms of isolation areas, devices, contacts (<b>intraconnection</b> vias), wiring (interconnection lines), and passivation. Immediate problems in isolation size, device performance, contact resistance, and wiring topography will be identified. Future needs for improved structures will be indicated. Promising new approaches such as lightly-doped drain FETs and silicide-on-polysilicon (polycide) wiring will be described. Throughout this discussion the importance of process modeling will be emphasized...|$|E
40|$|Silicon {{photonics}} {{have generated}} an increasing {{interest in the}} recent year, mainly for optical telecommunications or for optical interconnects in microelectronic circuits. The rationale of silicon photonics is {{the reduction of the}} cost of photonic systems through the integration of photonic components and an IC on a common chip, or in the longer term, the enhancement of IC performance with the introduction of optics inside a high performance chip. In order to build a Opto-Electronic Integrated circuit (OEIC), different European project has been launched in Europe. The PICMOS project demonstrated the full optical link on a silicon circuit with InP bonded devices. The following WADIMOS project goes a step further with the demonstration of an optical network on chip with WDM laser for on-chip <b>intraconnection</b> between IC cores. The UK silicon photonics project and the European HELIOS project are focalized on telecommunications devices with the aim of photonics and electronics integration which can be done either by wafer bonding of an SOI photonic circuit or by low temperature fabrication of a photonic layer at the metallization levels. Recent development on building blocks will be reported such as low loss couplers, Si and InP disk modulators, high speed Ge or InGaAs photodetectors...|$|E
30|$|Recently, [17] {{proposed}} a new nonoverlapping community detection algorithm, scalable community detection (SCD). Network communities of good quality should have stronger <b>intraconnections</b> than interconnections. Previous algorithms measure such strength of connectivity {{only through the}} number of edges. The uniqueness of SCD {{is that it is}} based on a triangular structure of edges. The goal is to identify communities where each node forms more triangles with nodes inside the community than those formed with nodes outside the community.|$|R
30|$|The “best” {{community}} to split further is chosen by computing and comparing splitting scores for all current communities {{corresponding to the}} leaf nodes in the hierarchy. The proposed splitting scores are based on normalized cut. We make this choice because (1) normalized cut determines whether a split is structurally effective since it measures the difference between <b>intraconnections</b> and interconnections among network nodes; and (2) for SymNMF, when S is the normalized adjacency matrix, the SymNMF objective function is equivalent to (a relaxation of) minimizing the normalized cut, which is the preferred choice in graph clustering [14].|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Human {{organism}} is interpenetrated by {{the world}} of microorganisms, from the conception until the death. This interpenetration involves different levels of interactions between the partners including trophic exchanges, bi-directional cell signaling and gene activation, besides genetic and epigenetic phenomena, and tends towards mutual adaptation and coevolution. Since these processes are critical {{for the survival of}} individuals and species, they rely on the existence of a complex organization of adaptive systems aiming at two apparently conflicting purposes: the maintenance of the internal coherence of each partner, and a mutually advantageous coexistence and progressive adaptation between them. Humans possess three adaptive systems: the nervous, the endocrine and the immune system, each internally organized into subsystems functionally connected by <b>intraconnections,</b> to maintain the internal coherence of the system. The three adaptive systems aim at the maintenance of the internal coherence of the organism and are functionally linked by interconnections, in such way that what happens to one is immediately sensed by the others. The different communities of infectious agents that live within the organism are also organized into functional networks. The members of each community are linked by <b>intraconnections,</b> represented by the mutual trophic, metabolic and other influences, while the different infectious communities affect each other through interconnections. Furthermore, by means of its adaptive systems, the organism influences and is influenced by the microbial communities through the existence of transconnections. It is proposed that these highly complex and dynamic networks, involving gene exchange and epigenetic phenomena, represent major coevolutionary forces for humans and microorganisms...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Network-on-chip (NoC) is a {{new design}} {{paradigm}} for system-on-chip <b>intraconnections</b> in the billion-transistor era. Application specific on-chip network design is essential for NoC success in this new era. This paper presents a class of source routing switches {{that can be used}} to efficiently form arbitrary network topologies and that can be optimized for various applications. Hardware description language versions of the networks can be generated automatically for simulations and for syntheses. A series of switches and networks has been configured with their performances including latency, delay, area, and power, and analyzed theoretically and experimentally. The results show that this NoC architecture provides a large design space for application specific on-chip network designs. Key words: network-on-chip; system-on-chip; source routin...|$|R
30|$|Community {{detection}} {{is a key}} task in {{the study}} of large networks, which has recently become a very important area of research [1 – 3]. Although there are no generally accepted definitions of network communities, it is usually agreed that a community is defined as a group of nodes that have more <b>intraconnections</b> than interconnections. This high-level description defines community from a linkage point of view. In reality, a functional community in a network is usually based on some common affiliation, attribute, etc., which may not be directly related to linkage information. However, {{it has been shown that}} linkage-based communities usually have strong correlation with functional communities [4]. The purpose of community detection is to identify linkage-based communities or functional communities in a network.|$|R
40|$|The General Purpose Computer (GPC) 'subsystem' of the Orbiter Data Processing System was described. Two {{interface}} {{areas are}} discussed. One {{is the area}} of GPC <b>intraconnections</b> and intracommunications involving the hardware/software interface between the Central Processing Unit (CPU) and the Input/Output Processor (IOP). The other is the area of GPC interconnections and intercommunications and involves the hardware/software interface between the five Orbiter GPC's. Based on the detailed GPC interface given, it is felt that the basic CPU to IOP interface and the GPC to GPC interface {{have the potential for}} trouble free operation. However, due to the complexity of the interface and the criticality of GPC synchronization to overall avionics performance, the GPC to GPC interface should be carefully evaluated when attempting to resolve test anomalies that may involve GPC timing and synchronization errors...|$|R
30|$|Earlier work in {{this area}} mainly focused on finding linkage-based {{communities}} on small networks. Various measures have been defined and optimized for the difference between <b>intraconnections</b> and interconnections among network nodes, such as normalized cut, conductance, and others, using a variety of methods [4]. Manual examinations (such as visualization) of the results have typically been used in those studies, which may provide some valuable information and insights. Community detection on large networks is more challenging due to the following reasons: (1) many algorithms suitable for small networks are often not scalable; (2) there is a dearth of ground-truth communities defined for large networks and even for the datasets with ground truth, where the quality of the ground truth is often questionable; and (3) examining the results is nearly impossible. It has not been until recently [4] that ground-truth communities have been defined and studied in several real-world large-scale networks.|$|R
40|$|The {{strategy}} of decomposing a design problem into subproblems {{is commonly used}} in engineering design. One difficulty in applying this strategy to computer-based design systems is the assembly of subproblem solutions to construct a whole solution. Despite its advantages, this design strategy suffers two major problems. First, as constraints are ill defined and implicitly exist among design objects, {{it is very difficult}} to articulate and represent design constraints in computable forms. Second, as design subproblems are designated separately in computer-based design systems, the inherent relationships among subproblems are not considered in contriving these  subproblems. As a result, recomposing subproblem solutions is hard to do. This paper presents a model for modelling design processes and the knowledge involved. The model is called “design concept”, which represents empirical interconnections of design attributes and <b>intraconnections</b> of design subproblems. Topological relations are represented using decomposition trees. The advantages and disadvantages of integratively using decomposition trees and design concepts in facilitating conceptual design are discusse...|$|R
50|$|These {{theories}} {{do agree}} on one element of LTP, namely, that it must occur through physical changes to the synaptic membrane/s, i.e. synaptic plasticity. Perceptual control theory encompasses both of these views. It proposes the mechanism of 'reorganisation' {{as the basis of}} learning. Reorganisation occurs within the inherent control system of a human or animal by restructuring the inter- and <b>intraconnections</b> of its hierarchical organisation, akin to the neuroscientific phenomenon of neural plasticity. This reorganisation initially allows the trial-and-error form of learning, which is seen in babies, and then progresses to more structured learning through association, apparent in infants, and finally to systematic learning, covering the adult ability to learn from both internally and externally generated stimuli and events. In this way, PCT provides a valid model for learning that combines the biological mechanisms of LTP with an explanation of the progression and change of mechanisms associated with developmental ability (Plooij 1984, 1987, 2003, Plooij & Plooij (1990), 2013).|$|R
30|$|In this paper, {{we focus}} on link-based {{community}} detection, and use functional communities (if known) as ground truth. In general, to evaluate link-based community detection results, we may ask several questions. The first is whether the result is coherent {{from the point of}} view of network links (Q 1). There are many measurement scores defined based on the presumption that a community should have more <b>intraconnections</b> than interconnections. These measures include normalized cut, ratio cut, conductance, etc. The second question is whether the result agrees with prior knowledge, especially the ground truth if it is known (Q 2). There have been largely two approaches. One is to manually analyze the results with some known meta-information (such as the entity each node represents), which is not scalable to large networks. Another approach is to compare the community detection result using some measures such as F 1 score, which assumes the existence of ground truth. Finally, we would like to know whether the result reveals some new and useful information about the network (Q 3). This is mostly relevant for the study of small networks [15]. For large networks, it is almost impossible to manually check all communities discovered. However, the answers to Q 2 may guide our focus to more interesting parts of the network.|$|R
40|$|An {{established}} {{aspect of}} force transmission in quasistatic deformation of granular media is {{the existence of}} a dual network of strongly versus weakly loaded particles. Despite significant interest, the regulation of strong and weak forces through the contact network remains poorly understood. We examine this aspect of force transmission using data on microstructural fabric from: (I) three-dimensional discrete element models of grain agglomerates of bonded subspheres constructed from in situ synchrotron microtomography images of silica sand grains under unconfined compression and (II) two-dimensional assemblies of unbonded photoelastic circular disks submitted to biaxial compression under constant volume. We model force transmission as a network flow and solve the maximum flow-minimum cost (MFMC) problem, the solution to which yields a percolating subnetwork of contacts that transmits the "maximum flow" (i. e., the highest units of force) at "least cost" (i. e., the dissipated energy from such transmission). We find the MFMC describes a two-tier hierarchical architecture. At the local level, it encapsulates <b>intraconnections</b> between particles in individual force chains and in their conjoined 3 -cycles, with the most common configuration having at least one force chain contact experiencing frustrated rotation. At the global level, the MFMC encapsulates interconnections between force chains. The MFMC can be used to predict most of the force chain particles without need for any information on contact forces, thereby suggesting the network flow framework may have potential broad utility in the modeling of force transmission in unbonded and bonded granular media...|$|R
40|$|Many {{infrastructure}} {{networks have}} a modular structure {{and are also}} interdependent. While significant research has explored the resilience of interdependent networks, {{there has been no}} analysis of the effects of modularity. Here we develop a theoretical framework for attacks on interdependent modular networks and support our results by simulations. We focus on the case where each network has the same number of communities and the dependency links are restricted to be between pairs of communities of different networks. This is very realistic for infrastructure across cities. Each city has its own infrastructures and different infrastructures are dependent within the city. However, each infrastructure is connected within and between cities. For example, a power grid will connect many cities as will a communication network, yet a power station and communication tower that are interdependent will likely be in the same city. It has been shown that single networks are very susceptible to the failure of the interconnected nodes (between communities) Shai et al. and that attacks on these nodes are more crippling than attacks based on betweenness da Cunha et al. In our example of cities these nodes have long range links which are more likely to fail. For both treelike and looplike interdependent modular networks we find distinct regimes depending on the number of modules, $m$. (i) In the case where there are fewer modules with strong <b>intraconnections,</b> the system first separates into modules in an abrupt first-order transition and then each module undergoes a second percolation transition. (ii) When there are more modules with many interconnections between them, the system undergoes a single transition. Overall, we find that modular structure can influence the type of transitions observed in interdependent networks and should be considered in attempts to make interdependent networks more resilient...|$|R
