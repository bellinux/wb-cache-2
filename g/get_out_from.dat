He called her [...] "just one of many countless authorities that have explained to me the rules of a game, how to control myself, and then pushed me towards a particular goal of the computer’s design" [...] and that [...] "this is an experience that I have every time that I fire up my Xbox and describes the curiously intimate relationship between player and gaming system that emerges in single player gameplay".

He wrote [...] "I cared about GlaDOS only because she was the one directing me. Oh, and then I really cared about her because she wanted to kill me".|$|E
