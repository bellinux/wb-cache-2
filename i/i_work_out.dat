The film's screenplay was co-written by Sia and children's book author Dallas Clayton. Sia enjoyed the creative process and noted similarities between directing and writing songs. She said of the process: For me, the process was basically, <b>I</b> <b>work</b> <b>out</b> the movie. I'll act it out, I'll have the dialogue already in my head ... I can't be bothered to learn Final Draft ... Like, when I sing, I just want to sing the melody and write the lyrics. I don't want to have to do production, which is very technical.

50|$|Burke later {{described}} his process for directing operas:What I do first is learn the whole opera. I {{would get the}} records of the opera and learn every note and all the dialogue. I would play it, and play it etc. After a while images come into the mind - the way an aria sticks out in an opera and so do certain key moments. Then <b>I</b> <b>work</b> <b>out</b> the crucial scenes. What makes it different to any other opera. Why is this opera the opera it is. The ABC Music Department cast all the operas so I played no part in that. Next was the design. I was allocated a designer. We would work out the costumes and sets and flavour and tone and period. Next is the big job of plotting the opera ie pictures and all the detail. I would leave the office and go home and play the opera for weeks, with the script in front of me. I would work on it plotting bar by bar. Then I passed all that information to the cast. I found most singers very grateful for direction.The team of Lola Montez were commissioned to write an original musical for television, Pardon Miss Westcott. A third musical by the trio, based on Ruth Park's The Harp in the South, has never been performed.|$|E
