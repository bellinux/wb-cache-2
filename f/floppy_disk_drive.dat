5|$|The ZX Spectrum +3, {{released}} in 1987, looked {{similar to the}} +2A but featured a built-in 3-inch <b>floppy</b> <b>disk</b> <b>drive</b> (like the Amstrad CPC 6128) instead of the tape drive, and was in a black case. It was launched in 1987, initially retailed for £249 and then later £199 and was the only Spectrum capable of running the CP/M operating system without additional hardware.|$|E
5|$|Referred to during {{development}} as the ZX81 Colour and ZX82, it was launched as the ZX Spectrum by Sinclair {{to highlight the}} machine's colour display, compared with {{the black and white}} of its predecessor, the ZX81. The Spectrum was released as eight different models, ranging from the entry level with 16KB RAM released in 1982 to the ZX Spectrum +3 with 128KB RAM and built in <b>floppy</b> <b>disk</b> <b>drive</b> in 1987; together they sold over 5 million units worldwide (not counting clones).|$|E
5|$|The PowerBook100 was {{the first}} PowerBook to {{incorporate}} SCSI Disk Mode, which allowed it {{to be used as}} an external hard disk on a desktop Macintosh. This provided a convenient method for software to be installed onto the PowerBook or transferred to the desktop, without the need for the 100's optional <b>floppy</b> <b>disk</b> <b>drive.</b> A specialized SCSI cable with a unique connector was required, however, to use any SCSI device on the PowerBook series. A second dedicated cable was required for SCSI Disk Mode. This feature was unique to the 100 until Apple introduced new PowerBooks more than a year later.|$|E

5|$|However, {{the initial}} {{popularity}} of the PowerBook100 did not last. Sales decreased, and by December 1991 the 140 and 170 models had become more popular because customers {{were willing to pay}} more for a built-in <b>floppy</b> <b>disk</b> <b>drive</b> and second serial port, which the PowerBook100 lacked. By August 10, 1992, Apple quietly dropped the PowerBook100 from its price list but continued to sell existing stock through its own dealers and alternative discount consumer-oriented stores such as Price Club. In these stores, a 4MB RAM/40MB hard drive configuration with a floppy drive sold for less than $1,000 (more than $1,500 less than the similar 2MB/20MB configuration's original list price).|$|E
5|$|When he auditioned, Hertzberg had no {{idea what}} Adam would look like in full costume and make-up. Buffy used a company named Optic Nerve to build the {{materials}} to make Hertzberg look like a demonoid. Almost immediately after Hertzberg got the part, Optic Nerve sketched and sculpted Adam's appearance. They had Hertzberg come in to have molds made for prosthetic parts to fit his head and face, arms, chest, and legs, then he was fitted for contact lenses. They also created separate hands and a chest to film for close-up shots. Adam has a <b>floppy</b> <b>disk</b> <b>drive</b> mounted on his chest which, when used, had to be filmed without Hertzberg behind it. The entire construction of Adam's appearance took about two weeks. Hertzberg's voice was also modified post-production. When he saw the full Adam prosthetic and costume, his biggest concern was being able to show nuanced facial expressions under so much latex. It took hours to get Hertzberg into his full costume, but even after it was fully applied on set, often he would have to wait even longer before he went in front of the cameras. He spoke of the need to stay focused during all the waiting while sweating underneath everything he wore for the part.|$|E

25|$|A floppy disk, {{also called}} a floppy, diskette, or just disk, {{is a type}} of disk storage {{composed}} of a disk of thin and flexible magnetic storage medium, sealed in a rectangular plastic enclosure lined with fabric that removes dust particles. Floppy disks are read and written by a <b>floppy</b> <b>disk</b> <b>drive</b> (FDD).|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} to make a 3½-inch <b>floppy</b> <b>disk</b> <b>drive</b> be recognized by a system as a 5¼‑inch 360 KB or 1200 KB drive, and {{to read and write}} disks with the same number of tracks and sectors as those disks; this had some application in data exchange with obsolete CP/M systems.|$|E
25|$|Gary Kildall {{originally}} developed CP/M during 1974, as an operating system {{to run on}} an Intel Intellec-8 development system, equipped with a Shugart Associates 8-inch <b>floppy</b> <b>disk</b> <b>drive</b> interfaced via a custom floppy disk controller. It was written in Kildall's own PL/M (Programming Language for Microcomputers). Various aspects of CP/M were influenced by the TOPS-10 operating system of the DECsystem-10 mainframe computer, which Kildall had used as a development environment.|$|E

25|$|Many {{personal}} computers of all types, including tablets and mobile phones, use SD cards, either through built-in slots or through an active electronic adaptor. Adaptors {{exist for the}} PC card, ExpressBus, USB, FireWire, and the parallel printer port. Active adaptors also let SD cards be used in devices designed for other formats, such as CompactFlash. The FlashPath adaptor lets SD cards {{be used in a}} <b>floppy</b> <b>disk</b> <b>drive.</b>|$|E
25|$|Apple {{encouraged}} hardware {{developers to}} produce PCI compatible peripherals {{that could be}} added to the Pippin. The only official method of producing add-ons for the Pippin was by developing PCI-compatible devices, and then placed in a docking station cabinet. A proprietary riser card interface (referred to by Apple as an X-PCI slot) is located on the bottom of a Pippin system, and is used by docking stations. A docking station for a Pippin can contain a variety of hardware, such as SCSI or <b>floppy</b> <b>disk</b> <b>drive</b> controllers, video interfaces, codecs, or network interfaces such as Ethernet. The logic board passes PCI signals through the X-PCI docking interface, and then to the docking station. Docking stations within the Pippin line do not provide pass-through support, thereby limiting a Pippin system to use only one docking station at one time. For example, a docking station for a <b>floppy</b> <b>disk</b> <b>drive</b> would need to be removed in order to attach a docking station for the magneto optical drive. Katz Media produced a generic docking station, containing a PCI slot, allowing a user to install PCI cards. No PCI-based peripherals were ever developed specifically for the Pippin.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{introduction}} of the first Macintosh, alongside the Apple logo, Apple used a typeface called Motter Tektura, which was designed in Austria by Othmar Motter of Vorarlberger Graphik in 1975 and distributed by Letraset (and also famously used by Reebok). At the time, the typeface was considered new and modern. One modification to the typeface was the removal of the dot over the i. The s was also modified for the label on the Disk II 5.25-inch <b>floppy</b> <b>disk</b> <b>drive.</b>|$|E

50|$|Shugart Associates was {{a common}} source of <b>floppy</b> <b>disk</b> <b>drives,</b> as was Tandon Corporation.|$|R
25|$|In 1992, Wang marketed a PC-compatible {{based on}} the Intel 80386SX processor, which they called the Alliance 750CD. It was clocked at 25MHz and had a socket for an 80387 math coprocessor. It came with 2 {{megabytes}} of installed RAM, and was expandable to 16 megabytes using SIMM memory cards (a Wang invention that became an industry standard). It had a 1.44 megabyte <b>floppy</b> <b>disk</b> <b>drive,</b> an internal 80 megabyte hard disk, and a CD-ROM drive. Five expansion slots were built-in. It came with MS-DOS and Windows 3.1 operating systems.|$|E
25|$|A further radical {{step was}} to abandon the 3½-inch <b>floppy</b> <b>disk</b> <b>drive</b> which had been present in every Macintosh since the first in 1984. Apple argued that {{recordable}} CDs, the Internet, and office networks were quickly making diskettes obsolete, however, Apple's omission generated controversy. At the time of iMac's introduction, third-party manufacturers offered external USB floppy disk drives, often in translucent plastic to match the iMac's enclosure. Apple had initially announced the internal modem in the iMac would operate at only 33.6 kbit/s rather than the new 56 kbit/s speed, but was forced by consumer pressure to adopt the faster standard.|$|E
25|$|Sinclair created various {{peripherals}} for its computers, including memory expansion modules, the ZX Printer, and the ZX Interface 1 and ZX Interface 2 add-ons for the ZX Spectrum. A {{number of}} QL peripherals {{were developed by}} other companies but marketed under the Sinclair brand. External storage for the Spectrum was usually on cassette tapes, as was common in that era. Rather than an optional <b>floppy</b> <b>disk</b> <b>drive,</b> Sinclair instead opted to offer its own mass storage system, the ZX Microdrive, a tape-loop cartridge system that proved unreliable. This was also the primary storage device for the QL.|$|E

25|$|Such large platters {{were never}} used with {{microprocessor-based}} systems. With increasing sales of microcomputers having built in floppy-disk drives (FDDs), HDDs {{that would fit}} to the FDD mountings became desirable. Thus HDD Form factors, initially followed those of 8-inch, 5.25-inch, and 3.5-inch <b>floppy</b> <b>disk</b> <b>drives.</b> Because there were no smaller <b>floppy</b> <b>disk</b> <b>drives,</b> smaller HDD form factors developed from product offerings or industry standards.|$|R
25|$|Led by Masayuki Uemura, Nintendo's R {{team had}} been {{secretly}} {{working on a}} system since 1980, ambitiously targeted to be less expensive than its competitors, yet with performance {{that could not be}} surpassed by its competitors for at least a year. Uemura initially thought of using a modern 16-bit CPU, but instead settled on the inexpensive MOS Technology 6502, supplementing it with a custom graphics chip (the Picture Processing Unit). To keep costs down, suggestions of including a keyboard, modem, and <b>floppy</b> <b>disk</b> <b>drive</b> were rejected, but expensive circuitry was added to provide a versatile 15-pin expansion port connection {{on the front of the}} console for future add-on functionality such as peripheral devices.|$|E
25|$|Super Mario Bros. was ported {{several times}} in the years {{following}} its original release on the Famicom/NES. A side-scrolling platform game entitled Super Mario Bros. was released as part of the Game & Watch range of handheld LCD game systems by Nintendo. The Game & Watch Super Mario Bros. is an entirely new game, featuring none of the stages from the Famicom/NES original. In Japan, Super Mario Bros. was released for the Disk System, Nintendo's proprietary <b>floppy</b> <b>disk</b> <b>drive</b> for the Famicom. This version also had multiple Minus World levels and featured on its packaging an artwork drawn by Miyamoto himself. It was also released for the North American NES with other games on the same cartridge (Super Mario Bros.-Duck Hunt and Super Mario Bros.-Duck Hunt-World Class Track Meet).|$|E
25|$|By early 1985 much Macintosh {{software}} required 512K of memory. Apple sold {{an official}} memory upgrade for the Macintosh 128K, {{which included a}} motherboard replacement effectively making it a Macintosh 512K, {{for the price of}} US $995. Additionally, Apple offered an 800KB <b>floppy</b> <b>disk</b> <b>drive</b> kit, including updated 128K ROMs. Finally, a Mac 128K could be upgraded to a Macintosh Plus by swapping the logic board as well as the case back (to accommodate the slightly different port configuration) and optionally adding the Macintosh Plus extended keyboard. Any of the kits could be purchased alone or together at any time, for a partial or full upgrade for the Macintosh 128K. All upgrades were required to be performed by professional Apple technicians, who reportedly refused to work on any Macintosh upgraded to 512K without Apple's official upgrade, which at US$700 was much more expensive than about $300 for third-party versions.|$|E

50|$|Half-height drive bays are 1.625″ high by 5.25″ wide (1.625 x 5.75 in), {{and are the}} {{standard}} housing for CD and DVD drives in modern computers, but were sometimes used for other things in the past, including hard <b>disk</b> <b>drives</b> (roughly between 10 and 100 MB) and <b>floppy</b> <b>disk</b> <b>drives.</b> As the name indicates, two half-height devices can fit in one full-height bay. Often represented as 5.25-inch, these <b>floppy</b> <b>disk</b> <b>drives</b> are obsolete.|$|R
5000|$|IBM {{manufactured}} 8-inch <b>floppy</b> <b>disk</b> <b>drives</b> from 1969 {{until the}} mid-1980s, {{but did not}} become a significant manufacturer of smaller-sized, 5.25" [...] or 3.5" [...] <b>floppy</b> <b>disk</b> <b>drives</b> (the dimension refers to {{the diameter of the}} <b>floppy</b> <b>disk,</b> not the size of the drive). IBM always offered its magnetic <b>disk</b> <b>drives</b> for sale but did not offer them with original equipment manufacturer (OEM) terms until 1981. By 1996, IBM had stopped making hard <b>disk</b> <b>drives</b> unique to its systems and was offering all its HDDs as an original equipment manufacturer (OEM).|$|R
