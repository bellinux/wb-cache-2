5|$|Nucleic acid {{amplification}} tests (NAATs), direct fluorescein tests (DFA), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) {{are highly}} sensitive tests that can identify specific pathogens present.

5|$|A {{review of}} {{metformin}} overdoses reported to poison control centers {{over a five-year}} period found serious adverse events were rare, though the elderly appeared to be at greater risk. A similar study in which cases were reported to Texas poison control centers between 2000 and 2006 found ingested doses of more than 5,000mg were more likely to involve serious medical outcomes in adults. Survival following intentional overdoses with up to 63,000mg (63g) of metformin have been reported. Fatalities following overdose are rare. <b>In</b> <b>healthy</b> children, unintentional doses of less than 1,700mg are unlikely to cause significant toxic effects.|$|E

The week-long festival is a community event which aims to educate people <b>in</b> <b>healthy</b> eating {{as well as the}} availability of foods.

5|$|Lactate uptake by {{the liver}} is diminished with {{metformin}} administration because lactate is a substrate for hepatic gluconeogenesis, {{a process that}} metformin inhibits. <b>In</b> <b>healthy</b> individuals, this slight excess is cleared by other mechanisms (including uptake by unimpaired kidneys), and no significant elevation in blood levels of lactate occurs. Given impaired kidney function, clearance of metformin and lactate is reduced, increasing levels of both, and possibly causing lactic acid buildup. Because metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate, any condition that may precipitate lactic acidosis is a contraindication. Common causes include alcoholism (due to depletion of NAD+ stores), heart failure and respiratory disease (due to inadequate tissue oxygenation); {{the most common cause}} is kidney disease.|$|E
5|$|Like all lifeforms, new {{strains of}} E. coli evolve through the natural {{biological}} processes of mutation, gene duplication, and horizontal gene transfer; in particular, 18% {{of the genome}} of the laboratory strain MG1655 was horizontally acquired since the divergence from Salmonella. E. coli K-12 and E. coli B strains are {{the most frequently used}} varieties for laboratory purposes. Some strains develop traits that can be harmful to a host animal. These virulent strains typically cause a bout of diarrhea that is often self-limiting <b>in</b> <b>healthy</b> adults but is frequently lethal to children in the developing world. More virulent strains, such as , cause serious illness or death in the elderly, the very young, or the immunocompromised.|$|E
5|$|Many {{plants and}} animals are {{associated}} with C.australis <b>in</b> <b>healthy</b> ecosystems. The most common epiphytes are ferns, astelias and orchids. Old trees often carry large clumps of the climbing fern Asplenium, and in moist places, filmy ferns and kidney ferns cling to the branches. Astelia species and Collospermum often establish in the main fork of the tree, and one tree can host several species of native orchid. Other common epiphytes include Griselinia lucida, {{as well as a}} range of mosses, liverworts, lichens and fungi. Two fungus species which infect living tissue—Phanaerochaeta cordylines and Sphaeropsis cordylines—occur almost exclusively on C.australis.|$|E

5|$|The {{peregrine}} falcon is sexually mature at {{one to three}} years of age, but <b>in</b> <b>healthy</b> populations they breed after {{two to three years}} of age. A pair mates for life and returns to the same nesting spot annually. The courtship flight includes a mix of aerial acrobatics, precise spirals, and steep dives.

5|$|The {{protein that}} prions {{are made of}} (PrP) is found {{throughout}} the body, even <b>in</b> <b>healthy</b> people and animals. However, PrP found in infectious material has a different structure and is resistant to proteases, the enzymes in the body that can normally break down proteins. The normal form of the protein is called PrPC, while the infectious form is called PrPSc— the C refers to 'cellular' PrP, while the Sc refers to 'scrapie', the prototypic prion disease, occurring in sheep. While PrPC is structurally well-defined, PrPSc is certainly polydisperse and defined at a relatively poor level. PrP can be induced to fold into other more-or-less well-defined isoforms in vitro, {{and their relationship to}} the form(s) that are pathogenic in vivo is not yet clear.|$|E

5|$|The {{relative}} risk {{and severity of}} serotonergic side effects and serotonin toxicity, with individual drugs and combinations, is complex. Serotonin syndrome {{has been reported in}} patients of all ages, including the elderly, children, and even newborn infants due to in utero exposure. The serotonergic toxicity of SSRIs increases with dose, but even in over-dose it is insufficient to cause fatalities from serotonin syndrome <b>in</b> <b>healthy</b> adults. Elevations of central nervous system serotonin will typically only reach potentially fatal levels when drugs with different mechanisms of action are mixed together. Various drugs, other than SSRIs, also have clinically significant potency as serotonin reuptake inhibitors, (e.g. tramadol, amphetamine, and MDMA) and are associated with severe cases of the syndrome.|$|E
5|$|A {{midazolam}} overdose {{is considered}} a medical emergency and generally requires the immediate attention of medical personnel. Benzodiazepine overdose <b>in</b> <b>healthy</b> individuals is rarely life-threatening with proper medical support; however, the toxicity of benzodiazepines increases when they are combined with other CNS depressants such as alcohol, opioids, or tricyclic antidepressants. The toxicity of benzodiazepine overdose and risk of death is also increased in the elderly and those with obstructive pulmonary disease or when used intravenously. Treatment is supportive; activated charcoal can be used {{within an hour of}} the overdose. The antidote for an overdose of midazolam (or any other benzodiazepine) is flumazenil. While effective in reversing the effects of benzodiazepines it is not used in most cases as it may trigger seizures in mixed overdoses and benzodiazepine dependent individuals.|$|E
5|$|The {{balance between}} the {{oxidized}} and reduced forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide is called the NAD/NADH ratio. This ratio {{is an important component}} of what is called the redox state of a cell, a measurement that reflects both the metabolic activities and the health of cells. The effects of the NAD/NADH ratio are complex, controlling the activity of several key enzymes, including glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase. <b>In</b> <b>healthy</b> mammalian tissues, estimates of the ratio between free NAD and NADH in the cytoplasm typically lie around 700; the ratio is thus favourable for oxidative reactions. The ratio of total NAD/NADH is much lower, with estimates ranging from 3–10 in mammals. In contrast, the NADP/NADPH ratio is normally about 0.005, so NADPH is the dominant form of this coenzyme. These different ratios are key to the different metabolic roles of NADH and NADPH.|$|E
