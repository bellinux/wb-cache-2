25|$|On {{the morning}} of 26 April, wounded {{soldiers}} began to be ferried off the beach, first to Goliath and the cruisers off shore. A miscommunication with the men on shore led to an unintended, larger evacuation effort. In {{the course of the}} action, she sustained some damage from the gunfire of Ottoman Turkish forts and shore batteries. Later in the <b>day,</b> <b>order</b> was restored on shore, and the Allied troops were able to occupy Sedd el Bahr, and reinforcements were landed, which allowed the advance to push toward Krithia on 27 April. Goliath and several other battleships shelled Ottoman defenders around the town to support the attack, which began the following morning at around 10:00. Goliath moved as close to shore as possible, to employ all of her guns at very close range. Despite the heavy fire support, the Allied troops were unable to dislodge the Ottoman defenders, and the First Battle of Krithia ended in an Allied defeat. She was damaged by Turkish guns again on 2 May.|$|E
2500|$|The {{family is}} found in Salemi, Mazzara, and today in Trapani. Nobile [...] Giuseppe Adragna {{was among the first}} jurors of Salemi in the years 1567–68; 1573–74. In Mazzara, Pietro Adragna held the rank of Captain in charge of Justice on 7 October 1665. In {{recognition}} of the family's feudal rights, Francesco Adragna was granted the title of Baron of Altavilla Salina by King Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies. Today, the Sicilian Heraldry Commission lists the family in the Golden Book of Italian Nobility, now preserved in the Italian historical archives in Rome. Similarly to other Italian Norman families, the House of Adragna has historic links with the Knights Hospitaller (the present <b>day</b> <b>Order</b> of Malta) through participation in the Crusading movement in the Holy Land.|$|E

60|$|Not so, however: the Incorruptible, {{about to}} be indicted in this sudden manner, could not be refused a week of delay. That week, he is not idle; nor is the Mother Society idle,--fierce-tremulous for her chosen son. He is ready at the day with his written Speech; smooth as a Jesuit Doctor's; and convinces some. And now? Why, now lazy Vergniaud does not rise with Demosthenic thunder; poor Louvet, unprepared, can do little or nothing: Barrere proposes that these {{comparatively}} despicable 'personalities' be dismissed by order of the <b>day!</b> <b>Order</b> of the day it accordingly is. Barbaroux cannot even get a hearing; not though he rush down to the Bar, and demand to be heard there as a petitioner.

The convention, eager for public business (with that first articulate emergence of the Trial just coming on), dismisses these comparative miseres and despicabilities: splenetic Louvet must digest his spleen, regretfully for ever: Robespierre, dear to Patriotism, is dearer for the dangers he has run.|$|E
