5|$|Both {{teams had}} progressed through three stages {{to reach the}} final. Australia was unbeaten thus far, while India had lost one game—against Australia in the first stage. Australia—led by Ricky Ponting—entered the game as firm favourites. After winning the toss, India captain Sourav Ganguly decided to field <b>first</b> <b>before</b> a crowd of nearly 32,000. The Australian opening pair, Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden, added 105 runs in 14 overs. After their dismissals, Ponting (140 not out) and Damien Martyn (88 not out) were {{involved}} in a partnership of 234 runs, then an Australian record, and took the total to 359 runs {{at the end of the}} innings. Harbhajan Singh took both of the Australian wickets, conceding 49 runs.|$|E
5|$|Burton filmed all the {{dramatic}} hospital scenes {{and most of}} those involving Finney <b>first,</b> <b>before</b> moving on to the McGregor section of Bloom's life. Although McGregor was on set from the beginning of filming, Burton chose to shoot all Finney's scenes first. Location filming in Alabama was delayed by inclement weather; during the Calloway circus scenes filming, a tornado watch was issued and flooding on the set interrupted filming for several weeks. Despite the delays, Burton delivered the film on budget and on schedule.|$|E

5|$|During {{subsequent}} {{discussions with}} a US consular official, Terrazas gave conflicting answers {{as to whether}} or not he had truly intended to abandon his rights as a US citizen when he applied for his certificate of Mexican nationality. The State Department eventually concluded that he had lost his US citizenship, a decision which Terrazas appealed, <b>first</b> <b>before</b> the State Department's board of appellate review, and subsequently to the courts.|$|E
5|$|In December 2006 and January 2007, {{during the}} off-season, both zero-G rolls {{were removed from}} the ride. The rolls were a problem due to {{concerns}} of occasional stalling caused by a failure of the tower's LIMs. The rolls were replaced by a slightly banked inclined S-curve. Batman's train had its shells painted red so Robin could be ready to open <b>first</b> <b>before</b> Batman. This was done because Robin was more reliable than Batman and the track replacement for Robin was completed first on March 13. It re-opened on April 7. Batman's track was replaced between April 16 and April 20, while the park was closed. However, Batman never re-opened.|$|E
5|$|The {{return of}} Australian {{personnel}} from the SWPA was delayed by shipping shortages {{and the need}} to maintain a force in the area for garrison duties. The military provided these personnel with training courses to prepare them for civilian life. Refresher courses in basic subjects such as maths and English were run <b>first</b> <b>before</b> vocational training began. The teachers and instructors for these courses were service personnel {{selected on the basis of}} their civilian occupations. In addition, sport competitions were conducted to keep the men busy.|$|E

5|$|When writing material, {{the band}} would write the music <b>first</b> <b>before</b> {{incorporating}} lyrics. King or Hanneman used a 24-track and drum machine to show band members the riff that they created, {{and to get}} their opinion. Either King, Hanneman or Lombardo would mention if any alterations could be made. The band played the riff to get the basic song structure, and figured out where the lyrics and solos would be placed. Hanneman, King and Araya tended to have different lyrical influences. Hanneman's lyrics dealt with Nazis, religion, warfare and similar topics; King's lyrics are generally anti-religious; Araya's lyrics usually dealt with topics {{that could be considered}} less controversial than Hanneman's and King's, such as serial killers and warfare.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} storm {{was present in}} the east-central Atlantic on October17. It moved northwestward at <b>first</b> <b>before</b> turning to the northeast on October19, when it was already a small, compact tropical cyclone. The storm steadily intensified as it tracked toward the Azores, and it reached a peak intensity of 70mph (110km/h) on October21. Maintaining its peak strength for 30hours, the storm began a steady weakening trend before crossing through the southern Azores. It turned to the southeast, weakening to tropical depression status on October24. Subsequently, the system turned {{to the south and}} quickly dissipated. This {{tropical storm}} {{was not included in the}} Monthly Weather Reviews summary of the 1950 hurricane season, and it was added to the Atlantic hurricane database in 1959.|$|E
5|$|At the time, 404 {{would have}} been the highest ever fourth innings score to result in a Test victory for the batting side. Australia had only 345 minutes to reach their target, and the local press wrote them off, {{predicting}} that they would be dismissed by lunchtime on a deteriorating wicket expected to favour spin bowlers. Morris and Hassett started slowly, scoring only six runs in the first six overs on a pitch offering spin and bounce. It appeared they were playing carefully at <b>first</b> <b>before</b> deciding whether to try to achieve the target at a later point. In Bedser's second over, the third of the innings, Morris chipped the ball in the air towards mid-wicket, in a similar manner to his first innings dismissal, but this time the ball evaded Cranston. After 15 minutes, Australia had only made 0/10.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{invocation}} {{and the performance}} of the National Anthem, three-time Olympic gold medalist swimmer Ryan Lochte commanded the drivers to start their engines. Edwards maintained his pole position lead going into the first corner with Earnhardt, Jr. in second. On lap two, Tony Stewart passed Edwards around the outside to take the lead. Edwards, with assistance from Bayne, moved in front of Stewart going into turn three to reclaim the first position two laps later. On the fifth lap, Earnhardt moved into the lead and Ambrose moved into second place. Edwards temporarily moved back into <b>first</b> <b>before</b> Earnhardt reclaimed the position. Bayne, who also battled for the lead, had moved down the field by lap seven. On lap nine, Michael McDowell made contact with David Gilliland's left-rear quarter panel between turns one and two; Gilliland went up the track towards the outside wall, and collected Menard and Montoya, triggering the first caution of the race and the appearance of the pace car. Keselowski was also caught up in the wreckage and his car sustained minor damage. Most of the drivers, including Earnhardt, made pit stops for fuel. Earnhardt was required to make an additional pit stop after one of his pit crew went over the wall too soon, dropping him down the field.|$|E

Jenner held a renaming ceremony in July 2015, adopting the name Caitlyn Marie Jenner. Prior to her 20/20 interview, a two-part special titled Keeping Up with the Kardashians: About Bruce was filmed {{with the family}} in which she answered questions, and prepared her children for the personal and public aspects of the transition. In the special, which aired in May 2015, the point was emphasized {{that there is no}} one right way to transition. Jenner made it a priority to ensure that all her children were independent <b>first</b> <b>before</b> focusing on her transition. In September 2015, her name was legally changed to Caitlyn Marie Jenner and gender to female.|$|E
5|$|In the game's single-player mode, {{the player}} must {{complete}} {{a series of}} levels where different types of AI-controlled enemies will try to hinder the player's progress. The game primarily takes place inside labyrinthine underground facilities, but the player can occasionally travel {{over the surface of}} the planets where the facilities are buried to reach other nearby areas. The underground facilities are composed of a set of tunnels and rooms separated by doors. Most of them can be opened by either firing weapons at them or bumping into them, but others require special actions to be performed <b>first</b> <b>before</b> entry is allowed. For instance, some doors require special keys to open them. To finish a level and proceed to the next one, the player must complete a certain set of objectives, ranging from collecting items to activating switches, defeating enemies, and destroying objects, among others. Some levels also feature optional objectives that are not critical but add to the player's overall completion score.|$|E

5|$|On September 20, a {{tropical}} cyclone was observed south off Guam, which proceeded northward through the Northern Marianas Islands. It {{turned to the}} northwest, but curved to the northeast by September 22. Passing south of Japan, the storm was last observed two days later. Another storm was observed on September 23 {{to the south of}} the Ryukyu Islands. It moved to the northeast at <b>first</b> <b>before</b> executing a loop in its track, passing through the Ryukyu Islands. The storm progressed to the northeast, remaining south of Japan, and was last noted on September 29. The final storm of the month was first observed on September 29 near Guam. Moving generally to the northwest at first, it turned to the northeast on September 30 and was last observed two days later to the southeast of Japan. While near the Bonin Islands, a station recorded a minimum pressure of 989 mbar (29.23 inHg).|$|E
5|$|Poulton had {{her most}} {{productive}} {{season in the}} WNCL in 2008–09 ahead of the 2009 World Cup, scoring 376 runs at 41.77. She posted two half-centuries {{in the first four}} matches, resulting in eight-wicket wins over Queensland and Western Australia respectively. She then made fifties {{in each of the last}} three round-robin matches. This included 60 and 53 against Victoria in the last two games, which New South Wales won win by nine and three wickets respectively. New South Wales thus earned the right to host the final against the same team, and Poulton made 43 as they chased down 118 and won the title by six wickets. Poulton totalled 0/48 from 11 overs during the WNCL. She also played in two Twenty20 interstate matches, scoring 23 and 35. New South Wales won the <b>first</b> <b>before</b> losing by one wicket to Victoria in the second.|$|E

They flew to Phuket on 15 March with Martin (still using his assumed name) who {{was sitting in the}} same row as them. He befriended the two and they checked into Nilly's Marina Inn facing Patong Beach. Martin was given Room 48 and the Damudes were given the adjacent Room 43. The Damudes were not seen again after they ate breakfast the next morning; at about 11a.m. THA (5a.m. UTC), Martin asked the inn's receptionist to switch his room to Room 43, saying that the Damudes had left and that he would pay their bill.|$|E

5|$|The 1910 Dual Contracts {{called for}} {{extending}} IRT and BMT lines to Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx. Owing to Queens' lack of {{development at the}} time, it did not receive many new IRT and BMT lines compared to Brooklyn and the Bronx, since the city's Public Service Commission (PSC) wanted to alleviate subway crowding {{in the other two}} boroughs <b>first</b> <b>before</b> building in Queens. The IRT Flushing Line was to be one of two Dual Contracts lines in the borough, and it would connect Flushing and Long Island City, two of Queens' oldest settlements, to Manhattan via the Steinway Tunnel. When the majority of line was built in the early 1910s, most of the route went through undeveloped land, and Roosevelt Avenue had not been constructed. Community leaders advocated for more Dual Contracts lines to be built in Queens to allow development there.|$|E
5|$|The {{declaration}} left Australia with {{a victory}} target of 404 runs.

Australia had only 345 minutes to reach the target, and the local press wrote them off, predicting their dismissal by lunchtime on a deteriorating wicket expected to favour the spinners.

Morris and Hassett started slowly, making only six runs in the first six overs on a pitch offering spin and bounce.

5|$|The {{last two}} Prussian {{attempts}} to rid itself of the Teutonic rule were made {{relying on the}} foreign powers who were enemies of the Knights. The first one in 1286, {{also known as the}} fourth uprising, depended upon help from the Duke of Rügen, the grandson of Swantopolk. The plot was soon revealed and the Bartians and Pogesanians suffered the consequences. In 1295 the last uprising was limited to Natangia and Sambia and depended upon help from Vytenis, Grand Duke of Lithuania. The rebels captured Bartenstein (Bartoszyce) by surprise and plundered as far as Königsberg, but were never a serious threat. By that time Prussian nobility was already baptized and pro-Teutonic to the extent that peasants killed them <b>first</b> <b>before</b> attacking the Knights.|$|E
