40|$|AbstractBased on {{theories}} of multiphase fluid mechanics, the gas transportation and concentration distribution <b>in</b> <b>drivage</b> face were studied in this paper. According to gas transportation characteristics <b>in</b> <b>drivage</b> working face, reasonable simplification was made, and two-phase flow transportation model for gas and air was established, then gas transportation characteristics <b>in</b> <b>drivage</b> face were theoretically deduced. In this paper, the gas transportation <b>in</b> <b>drivage</b> working face was also numerically simulated by common CFD software, {{and the distribution}} and transportation law of gas in some sections of the laneway were elicited. The results indicate: (1) The gas transportation in mine atmosphere is essentially the quality transmission process of gas in the flow; (2) The main factors having influences on gas transportation in the laneway are convection, molecule diffusion, turbulent flow diffusion and displacement transportation; (3) The main gas accumulation regions are the laneway corners, the laneway roof, the combining part of digging laneway and main laneway...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Based on the particularity {{of loose}} and broken of the {{surrounding}} rock of roadway, there will be rib spalling after excavating of roadway without support problem. Through analyzing for the specific reasons of the rib spalling, the theory of forepoling pre-stressed system and forepoling support project were put forward. The broken <b>rock</b> zone test <b>in</b> normal roadway support indicating that this technology can effectively prevent the rib spalling before and after digging, having good supporting effect and economic benefits. Foreword Coal mining technology in China has developed rapidly in recent years, including mining craft and roadway support, etc. especially in recent years, with the improvement of supporting technology, <b>drivage</b> <b>in</b> coal seam going more and more adapt to the need of roadway exploit and production of coal mine. Compare with <b>rock</b> roadway <b>drivage,</b> excavating <b>in</b> coal can improve the speed of excavation, decrease {{the strength of the}} tunneling, and increase the coal production. But due to complex conditions of coal-forming in our country, making the geological conditions of coal seam occurrence diverse, bringing great difficulties to excavate in coal roadway.

40|$|In {{recent years}} the drivage advance rates {{achieved}} within the UK coal industry have increased. In the 1980 's average drivage rates were 35 m per week compared to the 100 / 150 m per week possible today. These extended rates of advance have resulted {{in an increase in}} the potential methane, dust and heat generation within the vicinity of the <b>drivage</b> face. <b>In</b> order to effectively disperse this additional pollutant load a controlled increase in air quantity is required. Although advance rates have changed, current auxiliary ventilation practice has not. UK mining law requires that the fresh air must be delivered to within 5 m of the face. This has lead to the wide spread adoption of the use of overlap auxiliary systems within mechanised drivages, since a pure forcing system set at this distance from the face would lead to excessive airborne dust. UK mining law does not at present consider on-board mounted exhaust scrubber fans to constitute an effective overlap fan within mechanised drivages. Consequently an additional overlap exhaust fan is required to be installed within such <b>drivages.</b> <b>In</b> an attempt to determine whether working conditions could be safely and economically improved within mechanised rapid development drivages utilising an on-board mounted exhaust fan, a series of preliminary full scale gallery trials were conducted. A summary of the principal findings of these trials is presented together with an outline of a series of representative CFD simulations. This thesis examines the accuracy of CFD simulations for auxiliary ventilated headings. This is achieved by utilising Laser Doppler Anenometry (LDA) in a scale model representative of an underground heading and a detailed underground measurement programme conducted in production headings. These measured airflow values are then compared with representative CFD simulations and conclusion...|$|R
40|$|Large {{areas of}} ground are {{permanently}} supported on coal pillars, both in extensive old workings and current <b>drivages</b> <b>in</b> active mining operations. Continued growth of civil infrastructure is resulting in more surface development above old bord and pillar mines {{and an increased}} need for mine development beneath existing surface structures and features. The result is a greater likelihood of conflict between miners, developers and regulatory bodies. However, over the last 40 years {{there has also been}} significant improvement in the general level of understanding of pillar behaviour and stability, both in Australia and overseas. This paper examines some of the issues to be considered when undermining surface structures or undertaking surface development above old workings. The Factor of Safety (FoS) methodology widely employed for the assessment of pillar stability is reviewed, including the key geometrical, geological and statistical concepts associated with the probability of pillar failure; local and international experiences are examined and significant parameters isolated. Common concerns are addressed in the context of actual practical experience, utilising a risk management approach. Recent advances in methods for the assessment of pillar stability are put forward, along with criteria for arriving at rational design outcomes...|$|R

40|$|The current {{trend towards}} the {{adoption}} of retreat longwall mining methods and the associated rapid development of the access drivages has exacerbated the environmental conditions experienced within these workings. The combined use of roof bolt and continuous miner systems has improved the face advance rate within rapid development <b>drivages.</b> <b>In</b> order to maintain adequate dust and gas control {{it is essential that}} the auxiliary ventilation and monitoring systems are correctly installed and maintained. The causes of many potential environmental hazards experienced within auxiliary ventilated rapid development drivages, are often attributed to a failure by the workforce and supervisory officials to maintain the correct installation, maintenance and operational standards of the ventilation and mining systems. The potential ventilation hazards encountered may include: the failure to deliver the required fresh air quantity and velocity to rapidly dilute and disperse methane gas liberated {{in the vicinity of the}} cutting face, or the failure to maintain sufficient exhaust air quantity in the vicinity of the cut to adequately capture dust produced on cutting and loading of the extracted mineral. Results of recent research studies have demonstrated that validated Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation models can adequately replicate examples of good and bad ventilation. CFD models may be constructed and solved to examine the relative ventilation benefits produced by alternative mining and auxiliary ventilation configurations. These models enable the practitioner to predict and visualise the velocity, pressure and contaminant fields within an auxiliary ventilated drivage. This research project has developed a prototype educational aid, which animates and visualises these airflow and pollutant dispersion patterns within a Virtual Reality (VR) model. By introducing a pollutant such as methane into the CFD models, the VR simulation highlights regions of potential methane concentration build-up to the trainee. The application also allows the user to select/investigate the environmental consequences of enacting a number of remedial actions...|$|R
