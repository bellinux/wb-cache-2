50|$|Developed in 2007, the Fuel Characteristic Classification System expands {{upon the}} {{existing}} fuel models {{to produce a}} set of stylized fuel beds with quantitative data {{on their ability to}} support Wild-land fire {{and the degree to which}} such a fire would consume the fuel lying within the bed. Regionally developed by teams of experts, these models were “compiled from scientific literature, fuels photo series, fuels data sets, and expert opinion.” In addition to the standard dead and live components, the FCCS scheme reports assigned and calculated fuel characteristics for each existing <b>fuel</b> <b>bed</b> stratum including the canopy, shrubs, non-woody, woody, litter-lichen-moss, and duff,” allowing a more comprehensive analysis of material within a <b>fuel</b> <b>bed.</b> Furthermore, “the system classifies each <b>fuel</b> <b>bed</b> by calculating fire potentials that provide an index of the intrinsic capacity of each <b>fuel</b> <b>bed</b> to support surface fire behavior, support crown fire, and provide fuels for flaming, smoldering, and residual consumption.” The FCCS has significant potential, but has not be integrated into mainstream modeling software such as Flammap or Farsite. However, they are gaining popularity in modeling wild-land fire emissions and in the development of <b>fuel</b> <b>bed,</b> fire hazard, and treatment effectiveness maps on several national forests. Unlike the Scott and Burgan Models which move away from the use of vegetation type as a proxy for fuel type, the FCCS relies heavily on vegetation type in the formation of its models.|$|E
30|$|A current {{challenge}} {{that exists in}} the parameterization of first-order fire effects models is obtaining the measurement of fine-scale heterogeneity in fuel structure and loading. Assessment of fine-scale spatial heterogeneity of fuels is also important from the standpoint of fire spread, as this knowledge is required by models that simulate fire spread in layered and horizontally variable <b>fuel</b> <b>beds</b> as opposed to the homogenous <b>fuel</b> <b>beds</b> required by the Rothermel (1983) fire spread relations.|$|R
40|$|Flame {{spread over}} flat solid <b>fuel</b> <b>beds</b> {{is a useful}} means of {{understanding}} more complex two-phase non-premixed spreading flames, {{such as those that}} may occur due to accidents in inhabited buildings and orbiting spacecraft. The role of buoyant convection on flame spread is substantial, especially for thermally-thick fuels. The conventional view, as supported by computations and space experiments, is that for quiescent mu-g conditions, the spread rate must be unsteady and decreasing until extinction occurs due to radiative losses. However, this view does not consider that radiative transfer to the fuel surface can enhance flame spread. In this work we suggest that radiative transfer from the flame itself, not just from an external source, can lead to steady flame spread at mu-g over thick <b>fuel</b> <b>beds...</b>|$|R

50|$|Scott and Burgan’s Dynamic Fuel Models were {{published}} in 2005 to eliminate {{the assumption that the}} <b>fuel</b> <b>bed</b> was uniform during the dry season. This is done through the use of dynamic herbaceous fuel beds, where the “live herbaceous load is transferred to dead {{as a function of the}} live herbaceous moisture content.” The use of a curing coefficient allows more realistic modeling of fire behaviors in herbaceous fuel beds. Furthermore, these models aim to move away from the correlation between vegetation type and <b>fuel</b> <b>bed</b> characteristics. For example, the original ‘chaparral’ model becomes the ‘heavy load, tall brush” model. Like the NFDRS conversion crosswalk in Albini and Anderson’s models, Scott and Burgan include a crosswalk between the original 13 and their set of 40 new models. Furthermore, they include the original 13 as models 1-13 to allow backwards compatibility in newer modeling software.|$|E
50|$|The GPCS is a {{single-stage}} {{gas producer}} which achieves an improved combustion and steaming rate, reduces the emission of wasteful black smoke and overcomes {{the problem of}} clinkering. The most serious waste of fuel in a conventional steam locomotive {{is the loss of}} unburned coal particles from the <b>fuel</b> <b>bed</b> through the exhaust because of the rapid flow of air through the grate.|$|E
50|$|A Fuel Model is {{a stylized}} set of <b>fuel</b> <b>bed</b> {{characteristics}} {{used as input}} {{for a variety of}} wildfire modeling applications. Wildfire behavior models, such as those of Rothermel, take into account numerous empirical variables. While these inputs are important for equation outputs, they are often difficult and time-consuming, if not impossible, to measure for each <b>fuel</b> <b>bed.</b> A fuel model defines these input variables for a stylized set of quantitative vegetation characteristics that can be visually identified in the field. Depending on local conditions, one of several fuel models may be appropriate. As Anderson states “Fuel models are simply tools to help the user realistically estimate fire behavior. The user must maintain a flexible frame of mind and an adaptive method of operating to totally utilize these aids". Furthermore, depending on the application, the user must choose a fuel model classification system. The major classification systems for use in the United States include the National Fire Danger Rating System, the 13 ‘original’ fuel models of Anderson and Albini, the subsequent set of 40 fuels produced by Scott and Burgan, and the Fuel Characteristics Classification System.|$|E
40|$|Fire {{behavior}} of plant mixtures includes {{a complex set}} of processes for which the interactive contributions of its drivers, such as plant identity and moisture, have not yet been unraveled fully. Plant flammability parameters of species mixtures can show substantial deviations of fire properties from those expected based on the component species when burnt alone; that is, there are nonadditive mixture effects. Here, we investigated how fuel moisture content affects nonadditive effects in fire behavior. We hypothesized that both the magnitude and variance of nonadditivity in flammability parameters are greater in moist than in dry <b>fuel</b> <b>beds.</b> We conducted a series of experimental burns in monocultures and 2 -species mixtures with two ericaceous dwarf shrubs and two bryophyte species from temperate fire-prone heathlands. For a set of fire behavior parameters, we found that magnitude and variability of nonadditive effects are, on average, respectively 5. 8 and 1. 8 times larger in moist (30 % MC) species mixtures compared to dry (10 % MC) mixed <b>fuel</b> <b>beds.</b> In general, the moist mixtures caused negative nonadditive effects, but due to the larger variability these mixtures occasionally caused large positive nonadditive effects, while this did not occur in dry mixtures. Thus, at moister conditions, mixtures occasionally pass the moisture threshold for ignition and fire spread, which the monospecific <b>fuel</b> <b>beds</b> are unable to pass. We also show that the magnitude of nonadditivity is highly species dependent. Thus, contrary to common belief, the strong nonadditive effects in mixtures can cause higher fire occurrence at moister conditions. This new integration of surface fuel moisture and species interactions will help us to better understand fire behavior in the complexity of natural ecosystems. In general the moist species mixtures caused negative non-additive effects, but due to the larger variability these mixtures occasionally caused large positive non-additive effects, while this did not occur in dry mixtures.

40|$|Wildland fire is {{a natural}} part of the earth’s phenomenological pattern and like most natural {{phenomena}} has presented a challenge to human activity and engineering science. Wildfire presents Fire Safety Engineering with the task of developing fundamental research and designing analysis tools to address fire on a scale where interactions with atmospheric and terrestrial conditions dominate fire behavior. The research work presented in this thesis addresses a fundamental research issue involving transport processes in porous wildland <b>fuel</b> <b>beds.</b> This research project had the specific goal of developing an understanding of how transport processes affected the combustion of wildland fuels that were {{in the form of a}} porous bed. No detailed study could be found in the literature that specifically addressed how the fuel structure affected the combustion process in these types of fuels. To this end, a series of experiments were designed and carried out that approached the understanding of this problem using commonly available fire testing equipment, specifically the cone calorimeter and the FM Global Fire Propagation Apparatus. The goal of this research study and the basis for the novel and relevant contribution to the field of engineering was to conduct an experimental test series, analyze the data and examine the scalability of the results, to determine the effect of transport processes on the Heat Release Rate (HRR) of porous wildland fuels. The project concluded that flow dominates HRR in fires involving the wildland fuels tested. A dimensionless analysis of the fuel sample baskets showed consistency with well established mass transfer, fluid flow and chemical kinetic relationships. The dimensionless analysis also indicates that the experimental results should be scalable to similar configurations in larger <b>fuel</b> <b>beds.</b> One conclusion of this study was that wildland fire modeling efforts should invest in understanding flow conditions in <b>fuel</b> <b>beds</b> because this behavior dominates over the chemical kinetics of combustion for predicting HRR which is an important parameter in fire modeling...|$|R

50|$|The {{most serious}} waste of fuel in a {{conventional}} steam locomotive {{is the loss of}} unburned coal particles from the <b>fuel</b> <b>bed</b> because of the rapid flow of air through the grate. With the GPCS, the coal is therefore heated to drive off the volatile components which are then burned in the secondary air admitted above the grate. The result is improved combustion, thereby minimising black smoke, which is evidence of incomplete combustion with the result that unburnt coal particles are ejected through the exhaust.|$|E
50|$|Air {{curtains}} {{are also}} used to control the release of smoke particulates into the environment. After a natural disaster, or during brush clearing activities, debris is disposed of by incineration in either a ceramic or earth pit containment. Just as an air curtain serves to separate indoor air from outdoor air as, for instance, in restaurants and walk-in refrigerators, a powerful air curtain can defeat the chimney effect of the incineration process to eliminate any smoke from a brush incinerator. The air curtain acts as a lid on the process, and forces the smoke back into the <b>fuel</b> <b>bed</b> for a cleaner burn.|$|E
5000|$|The {{concept of}} a fuel model was first {{introduced}} in 1972 with the National Fire Danger Rating System. The first system of its kind, the NFDRS was a standardized set of equations to determine fire danger at specific points on the landscape. [...] Fuel models were {{at the core of}} these calculations, with each of its 20 models containing information about the relative loading of different fuel components. Each model is described by the volume of 1-hr, 10-hr, 100-hr, and 1000-hr dead fuels, herbaceous and woody live fuels present as well as the <b>fuel</b> <b>bed</b> depth and moisture of extinction.|$|E
40|$|Flame {{spread over}} flat solid <b>fuel</b> <b>beds</b> {{is a useful}} means of {{understanding}} more complex two-phase non-premixed spreading flames, {{such as those that}} may occur due to accidents in inhabited buildings and orbiting spacecraft. The role of buoyant convection on flame spread is substantial, especially for thermally-thick fuels. With suitable assumptions, deRis showed that the spread rate (S(sub f)) is proportional to the buoyant or forced convection velocity (U) and thus suggests that S(sub f) is indeterminate at mu g (since S(sub f) = U) unless a forced flow is applied. (In contrast, for thermally thin fuels, the ideal S(sub f) is independent of U.) The conventional view, as supported by computations and space experiments, is that for quiescent g conditions, S(sub f) must be unsteady and decreasing until extinction occurs due to radiative losses. However, this view does not consider that radiative transfer to the fuel surface can enhance flame spread. In recent work we have found evidence that radiative transfer from the flame itself can lead to steady flame spread at mu g over thick <b>fuel</b> <b>beds.</b> Our current work focuses on refining these experiments and a companion modeling effort toward the goal of a space flight experiment called Radiative Enhancement Effects on Flame Spread (REEFS) planned for the International Space Station (ISS) c. 2007...|$|R

In the experimental conditions the values of upslope–no-wind and no-slope–upwind fires showed no statistically significant differences from those of no-slope–no-wind fires.

Heat transfer {{ahead of the}} flame is allowed through both the solid and gas phases. The simplifying assumption of a surface reaction is made. Temperature profiles in both phases, concentration profiles in the gas phase, heat transfer at the surface, and flame spreading rates are determined. It is found that chemical kinetic parameters together with transport properties strongly influence the spreading rate. Heat transfer through the gas phase is the dominant mechanism for energy transfer ahead of the spreading flame {{over a wide range}} of Peclet numbers for the gas and solid phases...|$|R

Producer gas {{is made by}} blowing air through an incandescent <b>fuel</b> <b>bed</b> (commonly coke or coal) in a gas producer. The reaction of fuel with insufficient air for total combustion produces carbon monoxide (CO); this reaction is exothermic and self-sustaining. It was discovered that adding steam to the input air of a gas producer would increase the calorific value of the fuel gas by enriching it with CO and hydrogen (H2) produced by water gas reactions.

5000|$|For {{the proper}} and the {{optimized}} heat transfer from the flue gases to the boiler tubes draft holds {{a relatively high}} amount of significance.

A boiler equipped with a combustion chamber which has a strong current of air (draft) through the <b>fuel</b> <b>bed</b> will increase the rate of combustion ( [...] which is the efficient utilization of fuel with minimum waste of unused fuel).

40|$|Graduation date: 1978 A {{program of}} {{research}} has been established at Oregon State University to study wood residue combustion using an experimental spreader-stoker combustor. This research was conducted to increase the understanding of combustion occurring in wood fired boilers. Using Douglas Fir screened to 3 / 8 - 3 / 4 inches, two 4 x 4 factorial experiments were conducted varying depth of <b>fuel</b> <b>bed</b> and fuel feed rate. The objective of the experiments was to test the hypotheses that increased <b>fuel</b> <b>bed</b> depth has the statistically significant effects of decreasing particulate emissions and increasing the relative amount of solid carbon oxidized by the underfire air (the Relative Carbon Saturation). The amount of carbon is relative to the maximum amount that could be oxidized by the air. The results of the experiments were that the following effects {{were found to be}} statistically significant. 1. Increasing <b>fuel</b> <b>bed</b> depth from two to four inches decreases particulate emissions. 2. The effect of bed depth on particulate emissions is more pronounced at higher combustion rates. 3. Increasing <b>fuel</b> <b>bed</b> depth from two to four inches increases the Relative Carbon Saturation of the gases produced in the <b>fuel</b> <b>bed.</b> 4. At either <b>fuel</b> <b>bed</b> depth, the Relative Carbon Saturation is decreased by higher combustion rates. The most important results of the research are that a <b>fuel</b> <b>bed</b> several inches thick in a wood fired spreader-stoker can be used to effectively meter the underfire air to reduce particulate emissions and increase the heating value of the gases produced in the <b>fuel</b> <b>bed</b> which become fuel for the overfire combustion.

40|$|This work aims to {{characterize}} pine needles as a fuel {{for a better}} understanding of the burning dynamics of forest floor fuels in wildland fires. Three Mediterranean species of pine have been studied: Pinus halepensis, Pinus pinaster and Pinus laricio. These species have been chosen because they present close but slightly different physical and chemical properties. The study focuses on the influence of the bulk and particle properties on the burning dynamics of pine needles litters. The permeability of the porous <b>fuel</b> <b>beds</b> as well as the physical and chemical characteristics of each fuel have been determined experimentally. The combustion experiments were performed using the FM Global Fire Propagation Apparatus. The heat release rate estimation was done by using oxygen consumption calorimetry with a correction of the energy constant since the composition of the fuels was known. Two kinds of sample holders were used, one with holes to allow different air flow rates to pass through the fuel sample and one blocked to stop the flow at the bottom and the sides of the fuel sample. The different air flow rates were natural convection and different rates of forced flows. A mean value of the energy released during the flaming stage per unit mass loss can be determined for all species under the different flow conditions. This energy is related to the fire-line intensity, which is an important quantity for foresters, and firefighters that allows them to evaluate the fire impact and the means which are necessary to fight a fire. Permeability appears to be an important parameter when analyzing the combustion dynamics of highly porous forest <b>fuel</b> <b>beds.</b> The energy released during flaming depends greatly on permeability but for the same permeability, the fuel species have an influence on the burning dynamics...|$|R
