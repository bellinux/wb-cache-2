5|$|Samarium (and its sesquioxide) are {{paramagnetic}} at room temperature. Their corresponding effective magnetic moments, below 2µB, are the 3rd lowest {{among the}} lanthanides (and their oxides) after lanthanum and lutetium.

They {{can also be}} doped between the C60 molecules in the <b>fullerene</b> solid, rendering it superconductive at temperatures below 8K. Samarium doping of iron-based superconductors – the most recent class of high-temperature superconductors – allows to enhance their transition temperature to 56K, which is the highest value achieved so far in this series.|$|E
5|$|Uncommon {{magnetic}} properties (spin glass state) {{were observed in}} diamond nanocrystals intercalated with potassium. Unlike paramagnetic host material, magnetic susceptibility measurements of intercalated nanodiamond revealed distinct ferromagnetic behavior at 5 K. This is essentially different from results of potassium intercalation in graphite or C60 <b>fullerene,</b> and shows that sp3 bonding promotes magnetic ordering in carbon. The measurements presented first experimental evidence of intercalation-induced spin-glass state in a nanocrystalline diamond system.|$|E
5|$|Another {{approach}} ignores {{energy and}} deals {{only with the}} molecular complexity estimated by the information entropy index. It speculates that the points of several natural compounds (urea, pyrimidine, dihydroxyacetone, uracil, cytosine, glycine, and alanine) fall into {{the range of the}} values typical for the known interstellar molecules that indicates high probability of their detection in interstellar environment. Additionally the molecules with maximal information entropy, i.e. the most complex compounds, make up approximately a half of the interstellar set and their percentage is decreased with the size. This trend may be associated with the different stabilities of the molecules with uniform (usually more stable) and diversified (usually less stable) chemical structures, so the detectable molecules with a large size must possess symmetric structure more probably than non-symmetric. The remarkable detection of low-entropy (highly symmetric) <b>fullerene</b> molecules supports this assumption. It is also noted that information entropy reflects the depth of hydrogenation of interstellar entities: the molecules with maximal information entropy are hydrogen-poor whereas the others are mainly hydrogen-rich.|$|E

5|$|At {{the scale}} of living cells, foam {{patterns}} are common; radiolarians, sponge spicules, silicoflagellate exoskeletons and the calcite skeleton of a sea urchin, Cidaris rugosa, all resemble mineral casts of Plateau foam boundaries. The skeleton of the Radiolarian, Aulonia hexagona, a beautiful marine form drawn by Ernst Haeckel, {{looks as if it}} is a sphere composed wholly of hexagons, but this is mathematically impossible. The Euler characteristic states that for any convex polyhedron, the number of faces plus the number of vertices (corners) equals the number of edges plus two. A result of this formula is that any closed polyhedron of hexagons has to include exactly 12 pentagons, like a soccer ball, Buckminster Fuller geodesic dome, or <b>fullerene</b> molecule. This can be visualised by noting that a mesh of hexagons is flat like a sheet of chicken wire, but each pentagon that is added forces the mesh to bend (there are fewer corners, so the mesh is pulled in).|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of <b>fullerenes</b> {{in and around}} the LDEF crater number 31 is reported. This crater has a high C level associated with it, and is interpreted as having been produced by the impact of a C-rich micrometeoroid. <b>Fullerenes</b> are large 3 -D C structures, among which the species C sub 60 (MW 720) and C sub 70 (MW 840) are preeminent. <b>Fullerenes</b> have several UV absorption bands, hence <b>fullerenes</b> should be detectable using UV laser ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. We use a LIMA- 2 A instrument with pulsed UV laser (266 nm) to search for high mass C species associated with LDEF crater number 31. The mass range was 0 to 1200 amu. Low ablating laser power levels were used (less than or = 5 x 10 exp 7 W/sq. cm); 200 mass spectra were acquired and summed. We observed high mass signals near m/z 720, exhibiting 24 amu separation, which is characteristic of <b>fullerenes.</b> Alkali ion signals were also observed. Little or no C clusters of intermediate mass were observed. We interpret the signals around m/z 720 as <b>fullerenes,</b> mainly C sub 60 + with lower levels of C sub 70 +. We propose that the mechanism that produces these signals is resonant multiphoton ionization (REMPI). This selective mechanism explains why low mass C cluster ions are not observed along with the <b>fullerenes,</b> since they have much higher ionization potentials. This finding is unexpected, since up to now the search for <b>fullerenes</b> in extraterrestrial materials has not been successful. We conclude that the <b>fullerenes</b> became associated with crater number 31 in space.
