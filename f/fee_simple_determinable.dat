5000|$|A <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> <b>determinable</b> is {{an estate}} that will end {{automatically}} when the stated event or condition occurs. The interest will {{revert to the}} grantor or the heirs of the grantor. Normally, a possibility of reverter follows a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> <b>determinable.</b> However a possibility of reverter does not follow a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> <b>determinable</b> subject to an executory interest. Durational language such as [...] "to A {{as long as the}} property is used for a park" [...] creates a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> <b>determinable</b> and a possibility of reverter.|$|E
50|$|A <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> <b>determinable</b> {{does not}} violate the rule against perpetuities, since the {{interest}} in real property reverts to the grantor or his heirs, who are measuring lives.|$|E
50|$|There is a {{possibility}} of reverter when an estate {{will return to the}} grantor if a condition is violated. The possibility of reverter can only follow a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> <b>determinable.</b>|$|E
40|$|Prominent {{economically}} oriented legal academics {{are currently}} {{arguing that the}} <b>fee</b> <b>simple,</b> the dominant form of private landownership in the United States, is an inefficient way for society to allocate land. They maintain that the <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> blocks transfers of land to higher value uses because it provides property owners with a perpetual monopoly. The critics propose that landownership be reformulated to enable private actors to forcibly purchase land from other private owners, {{similar to the way}} that governments can expropriate land for public uses using eminent domain. While recognizing the significance of the critique, this Article takes issue with it and defends the <b>fee</b> <b>simple.</b> The Article makes two main points in defense of the <b>fee</b> <b>simple.</b> First, addressing the critique on its own economic terms, the Article argues that the critics have not established that there is a robust economic argument for dispensing with the <b>fee</b> <b>simple.</b> The critique that the <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> leads to the misallocation of land rests on three empirical premises for which the critics have yet to provide much evidence. The critique also downplays or overlooks important economic benefits of the <b>fee</b> <b>simple.</b> Second, departing from the economic discourse of the critics, the Article argues that the <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> is valuable because it gives landowners a perpetual right to choose, free from the dictates of others, whether to transfer their land. Thus the <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> expands the choices of landowners and promotes their independence and autonomy. Eliminating the <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> would leave landowners vulnerable to the whims of others, and less free and autonomous. Landownership is not only about efficiency, but also about individual freedom...|$|R
50|$|Leased fee value - This {{is simply}} the <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> {{interest}} encumbered by a lease. If the lease is at market rent, then the leased fee value and the <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> value are equal. However, if the tenant pays {{more or less than}} market, the residual owned by the leased fee holder, plus the market value of the tenancy, may be more or less than the <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> value.|$|R
25|$|Takings {{may be of}} {{the subject}} {{property}} in its entirety (total take) or in part (part take), either quantitatively or qualitatively (either partially in <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> or, commonly, an easement, or any other interest less than the full <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> title).|$|R
50|$|This type {{of future}} {{interest}} can only follow the <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> <b>determinable.</b> The vesting {{of the future}} interest is determinable {{at the time of}} the grant, because reverter is automatic if the condition is broken—a possibility of reverter, therefore, is not subject to the Rule Against Perpetuities.|$|E
5000|$|If {{previous}} grantors of a {{fee simple}} estate do not create any conditions for subsequent grantees, then the title is called fee simple absolute. A fee simple absolute is the highest estate permitted by law and it gives the holder full possessory rights and obligations {{now and in the}} future. Other {{fee simple estate}}s in real property include fee simple defeasible (or <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> <b>determinable)</b> estates. A defeasible estate is created when a grantor places a condition on a fee simple estate (in the deed). When a specified event happens, the estate may become void or subject to annulment. There are two types of defeasible estates: <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> <b>determinable</b> and the fee simple subject to a condition subsequent. If the grantor uses durational language in the condition such as [...] "to A. as long as the land is used for a park", then upon the happening of the specified event (in this case if the land is used for anything other than a park), the estate will automatically terminate and revert to the grantor or the grantor's estate; this is called a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> <b>determinable.</b> If the grantor uses language such as [...] "but if alcohol is served", then the grantor or the heirs have a right of entry if the condition occurs, but the estate does not automatically revert to the grantor; this is a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent. In most jurisdictions in the United States these concepts have been modified by statute. <b>Fee</b> <b>simple</b> <b>determinable</b> was generally preferred by courts in the common law of the early United States. Recently, that trend has reversed, and most courts in the United States will find a fee simple subject to condition subsequent in situations where the conveying document's language is unclear.|$|E
50|$|Fee simple estates may {{be either}} fee simple {{absolute}} or defeasible (i.e. subject to future conditions) like <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> <b>determinable</b> and fee simple subject to condition subsequent; this is the complex system of future interests (q.v.) which allows concepts of trusts and estates to elide into actuarial science {{through the use of}} life contingencies.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> {{subject to}} a {{condition}} subsequent is created when {{the words of a}} grant support the conclusion that the grantor intends to convey a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> absolute but has attached a condition to the grant so that if a specified future event happens the grantor will get its <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> absolute back, provided that the grantor exercises his right of entry (or power of termination). Thus, a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> subject to condition subsequent does not end automatically upon the happening of the condition. The future interest is called a [...] "right of reentry" [...] or [...] "right of entry," [...] and the property only reverts to the original grantor if he exercises this right.|$|R
50|$|The Rule's effect ended there. After that, the {{doctrine}} of merger operated on the two successive freehold estates placed in the same purchaser (B's life estate and B's remainder in <b>fee</b> <b>simple)</b> and converted them into a single <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> absolute in B.|$|R
50|$|Here, O is the {{original}} owner. She grants A a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> subject to the subsequent condition that he doesn't accept a candy bar from C. But unlike a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> subject to a condition subsequent, Blackacre goes to a third party (B) instead of the grantor (O) if the condition is met. Also unlike a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> subject to a condition subsequent, B then automatically gains the interest in Blackacre and does not only have a mere right to sue for re-entry.|$|R
50|$|Some jurisdictions in the United States have {{abolished}} this interest. For example, Kentucky {{abolished the}} <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> <b>determinable</b> and {{possibility of reverter}} by statute in 1960. An attempt to create such an interest is construed as a fee simple subject to condition subsequent (see below), and a person who would have possibility of reverter at common law will instead have a right of entry.|$|E
50|$|Reversion {{should not}} be {{confused}} with the possibility of reverter created in the grant of a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> <b>determinable.</b> Although both result in the return of the land to the original grantor or his heirs, reversions occur upon the natural expiration of the grantee's estate, while the possibility of reverter actively ends the grantee's otherwise-indefinite estate as a consequence of the grantee's failure to comply with the condition contained in the grant.|$|E
5000|$|A {{defeasible estate}} is created when a grantor {{transfers}} land conditionally. Upon the happening {{of the event}} or condition stated by the grantor, the transfer may be void or at least subject to annulment. (An estate not subject to such conditions is called an indefeasible estate.) Historically, the common law has frowned {{on the use of}} defeasible estates as it interferes with the owners' enjoyment of their property and as such has made it difficult to create a valid future interest. Unless a defeasible estate is clearly intended, modern courts will construe the language against this type of estate. Three types of defeasible estates are the <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> <b>determinable,</b> fee simple subject to an executory limitation or interest, and the fee simple subject to a condition subsequent.|$|E
50|$|An {{estate in}} <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> denotes the maximum {{ownership}} in land {{that can be}} legally granted; it is the greatest possible aggregate of rights, powers, privileges and immunities available in land. The three hallmarks of the <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> estate are that it is alienable, devisable and descendible.|$|R
40|$|Under {{the common}} law one who held an estate in lands in <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> {{absolute}} was the sole owner of such lands, and 1 hisright to enjoy the estate and exercise all the powers and privileges incident thereto could not be restricted by the devisor or grantor.

50|$|In English law, a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> or <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> {{absolute}} is {{an estate}} in land, {{a form of}} freehold ownership. It is a way that real estate may be owned in common law countries, and is the highest possible ownership interest that can be held in real property. Allodial title is reserved to governments under a civil law structure. The rights of the <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> owner are limited by government powers of taxation, compulsory purchase, police power, and escheat, and {{it could also be}} limited further by certain encumbrances or conditions in the deed, such as, for example, a condition that required the land {{to be used as a}} public park, with a reversion interest in the grantor if the condition fails; this is a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> conditional.|$|R
5000|$|The rule {{does not}} apply to {{interests}} in the grantor himself. For example, the grant [...] "For A so long as alcohol is not sold on the premises, then to B" [...] would violate the rule as to B. However, the conveyance to B would be stricken, leaving [...] "To A so long as alcohol is not sold on the premises." [...] This would create a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> <b>determinable</b> in A, with a possibility of reverter in the grantor (or the grantor's heirs). The grant to B would be void as it is possible alcohol would be sold on the premises more than 21 years after the deaths of A, B, and the grantor. However, as the rule {{does not apply}} to grantors, the possibility of reverter in the grantor (or his heirs) would be valid.|$|E
5000|$|The rule never {{applies to}} {{conditions}} {{placed on a}} conveyance to a charity that, if violated, would convey the property to another charity. For example, a conveyance [...] "to the Red Cross, {{so long as it}} operates an office on the property, but if it does not, then to the World Wildlife Fund" [...] would be valid under the rule, because both parties are charities. Even though the interest of the Fund might not vest for hundreds of years, the conveyance would nonetheless be held valid. The exception, however, does not apply if the conveyance, upon violation of the condition, is not from one charity to another charity. Thus, a devise [...] "to John Smith, so long as no one operates a liquor store on the premises, but if someone does operate a liquor store on the premises, then to the Roman Catholic Church" [...] would violate the rule. The exception would not apply to the transfer from John Smith to the Roman Catholic Church because John Smith is not a charity. Also, if the original conveyance was [...] "to John Smith and his heirs for as long as John Smith does not use the premises to sell liquor, but if he does, then to the Red Cross" [...] this would violate the rule because it could be more than 21 years before the interest in Red Cross would vest, and therefore, their interest is void. Thus leaving John with a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> <b>determinable</b> and the grantor a possibility of reverter.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{demonstrate}} the general inappropriateness of strictly adhering to any one predetermined standard in compensating owners whose property has been taken. Holmes' admonition is appropriate in this instance not because the reasons behind the standards have vanished, but because the courts, "from blind imitation" of these objective standards, have strayed from their reason for being. That reason is the just compensation requirement in the fifth amendment. Section II of this article compares United States Supreme Court opinions with other approaches to determine when, in general, compensation is "just" compensation. The {{purpose of this}} section is to urge that just compensation be equated with the fifth amendment's dictate of fairness and indemnity rather than with any one objective standard. Section III analyzes the rules the Restatement of Property and the courts have provided for deciding how a future interest holder should be compensated. The rules governing compensation for an owner of a possibility of reverter are emphasized throughout, since they represent the most egregious departure from the constitutional dictate. This section presents the condemnation of fee simple determinables as representative of the objective standards' failure in determining just compensation in all takings cases and proposes restructuring this approach by dethroning objective standards and emphasizing the equities of each case. Section IV reviews a recent article by Professors Goldberg and Merrill, and Daniel Unumb in which they support a "default rule" which gives the entire condemnation award to the grantee of a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> <b>determinable</b> thereby denying the owner of the possibility of reverter any compensation. Section IV takes issue with their support of this rule and demonstrates that, despite their indications to the contrary, ex ante clauses could work effectively in a deed granting a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> <b>determinable...</b>|$|E

5000|$|The {{concept of}} a [...] "fee" [...] has its origins in feudalism.

Land held in <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> can be {{conveyed}} to whomsoever its owner pleases; it can also be mortgaged or put up as security.Owners of real property in <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> have the privilege of interest in the property during their lifetime and typically have a say in determining who gets to own an interest in the property after their death.|$|R
