5|$|Andy (Ed Helms) {{still has}} not learned about fiancee Angela's (Angela Kinsey) affair with Dwight (Rainn Wilson), {{seventeen}} days after Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) revealed it to {{everyone else in the}} Dunder Mifflin office. Michael (Steve Carell) suggests he should inform Andy, but the entire office argues that Angela should be the one to break the news. Jim (John Krasinski) is particularly concerned that Andy's past anger management issues may lead to violence. Dwight tries convincing Angela to tell Andy, but she continues to put it off. This leaves Michael to tell Andy before he leaves for a meeting with David Wallace (Andy Buckley). Michael reveals the affair to Andy while driving out of the parking lot, leaving Andy shocked and dismayed. Angela reluctantly confirms the affair occurred, and Andy realizes <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> office already knew about it.|$|E
25|$|The {{explosives}} fail to {{kill the}} rabbits, and that night they attack Cole's ranch, killing Jud while Cole, Frank, Jackie, and Cole's housekeeper escape into the storm shelter. The rabbits {{make their way to}} the general store, killing housekeeper Mildred (Francesca Jarvis) and eating <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> small town of Galanos they find before taking refuge in the buildings for the day. In the morning, Gerry and Amanda leave to avoid the coming press but get stuck along a sandy stretch of road. Roy and Elgin update Sheriff Cody (Paul Fix) on the situation and, after realizing the rabbits have escaped the mine, call in the National Guard. As night falls, the rabbits leave Galanos to continue the rampage, making their way to the main town of Ajo and eating and killing everybody in their pathway. Cole proposes using a half-mile wide stretch of electrified railroad track as a fence to contain and kill the rabbits. They recruit a large group of people at a drive in theater to help herd the rabbits with their car lights, with assistance from the machine gun fire of the National Guard.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a story of a flood as seen through the eyes of an architect. The {{narrative}} explores the relationship of the young architect with his physical surroundings, using the context of a city that goes through a destructive natural phenomenon. The story aims to answer this question: Why is the spiritual quest of the architect for a deep understanding of his natural world important for his career? The hero sees himself as part of a society that is mainly responsible for shaping the new environment of the city. He notices the great influences of architecture on the way people relate themselves to nature. <b>In</b> experiencing <b>the</b> flood he sees the vulnerability of human settlements, perceives the restrictions the natural world imposes on us and learns to appreciate its generosity and beauty; and he realizes that he can transfer this vision to the rest of society through his design. It is only when he grasps the notion of humanity as a single fraction of this planet, when he acquires modesty and stops taking all that nature offers for granted, that he is able to build in accordance with nature’s harmony and his very own nature. <b>In</b> depicting <b>the</b> process of self-awareness for the architect, the flood becomes a representation of nature’s power, its strong presence and interference <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city’s built environment. The state of the architect’s soul and his perception evolve with the rain, and with the rising and receding of the water. The story consists of five chapters. At first there is ignorance. Everything appears calm. The architect is engaged <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rise of his career, and he’s unaware of what is missing from his life. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> second chapter, a feeling of anticipation emerges when the first warning signs of the flood appear. The architect might not take it very seriously, yet he begins to feel worried. At the same time, an inner excitement sparks in him, an aspiration to know this strange natural phenomenon. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> third chapter, during his exploration, the great flood strikes with all its fury and its devastating force. The architect is shocked; he’s struck with a power much greater than himself, the city, and its people. He sees that neither he nor others have any control over the situation. Thereafter, with the start of the fourth chapter, he has to face the real destruction of the city. Only then does he observe how all that was thought to be durable was in fact fragile; he is humbled like <b>everybody</b> <b>else.</b> Finally, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last chapter, and through creating a work of architecture, his realization reveals itself. The city and the architect begin to rebuild, but this time he has a new understanding of nature and his own role as the builder. The architect is reborn with the reconstruction of the city...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The overall aim of {{this thesis}} was to explore the {{conditions}} for daily occupations, and how these are reflected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> daily lives of people with the late effects of polio. Four studies (studies I–IV) are included in this research: three follow a qualitative approach exploring the experiences, strategies, and conditions for daily occupations among immigrants with the late effects of polio, and one follows a quantitative approach to explore the possible factors associated with fatigue among persons with the late effects of polio <b>in</b> Sweden. Methods: <b>The</b> Grounded Theory (GT) method was used to explore experiences, strategies, and participation in daily occupations and how participation is reflected and can be understood in daily life. Twelve immigrants from Eastern Africa with the late effects of polio were interviewed and the interviews were analyzed according to GT (studies I–III). For study III, a secondary analysis of the interviews was conducted to probe deeper into the complexity of participation. In study IV, an explorative and cross-sectional method was used to explore possible factors associated with fatigue. Results: Study I showed that experiences in daily occupations were highly varied. Thoughts, feelings, and reasoning about capacities and opportunities to live and do things like <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> resulted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> identification of participants’ conceptions of occupational self, which in turn affected {{their view of the}} future. Experiences were dependent upon participation in daily occupations where the social environment had a salient role. <b>The</b> findings <b>in</b> study II showed how participants used 14 different strategies to find a balance between physical capacity, meaningful occupations, and the conception of their own and others’ norms and values and living conditions in Swedish society. This resulted in a struggle for occupational participation and normality. Occupations within different areas of life and social interaction appeared to be important. Based on <b>the</b> analysis <b>in</b> study III, participation proved to be an ongoing, dynamic, and interactive process influenced by five subprocesses that contributed to value and identity development. Different conditions in daily life shaped the participation process. The process could have different strengths and could lead to both a sense of participation and exclusion. Study IV showed that factors associated with fatigue such as age and the use of mobility assistive devices could partly explain fatigue among persons living with the late effects of polio in Sweden. Use of mobility assistive devices proved to be the factor most likely to explain fatigue among participants. Participants using mobility assistive devices reported less fatigue than non-users. Conclusions: This thesis contributes to the understanding of conditions for daily occupations among immigrants with the late effects of polio. These conditions make participation an inconstant and changeable process. Attention must be paid to those conditions that create possibilities to perform daily occupations and opportunities for occupations, conditions that lead to engagement in occupations, and how the conception of occupations emerges in interactions with others and the environment. To provide interventions that support the management of physical capacity and increase knowledge about the late effects of polio and its consequences in daily life is essential. To prevent fatigue and enhance participation in daily occupations, it is important to provide and demonstrate the importance of assistive devices to ensure the management of fatigue. Understanding participation as an interactional process helps to clarify the social political aspects of participation, which advocates for the consideration of conditions that influence the participation process both politically and socially. The results call for a critical approach when addressing and enhancing participation. Additionally, <b>the</b> findings <b>in</b> this thesis reinforce the importance of occupations for those at risk of social exclusion...|$|R
