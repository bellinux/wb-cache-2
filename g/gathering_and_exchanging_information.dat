40|$|A {{growing number}} of New Psychoactive Substances (NPS) appear yearly on the European market (81 {{for the first time}} in 2013, adding to a total of over 350 NPS). Using semi-structured {{interviews}} with 25 Dutch experienced recreational drug users, the role of the Internet and friends in <b>gathering</b> <b>and</b> <b>exchanging</b> <b>information</b> about NPS was elaborated. Furthermore, we investigated how NPS were acquired and which aspects make NPS more or less attractive, including their legal status. It appeared that the Internet was an important source of information about NPS in general. Personal experiences with NPS were preferably shared face-to-face with friends, as for privacy reasons users were cautious to post their experiences on web sites and forums. NPS were usually obtained or bought from friends or-to a lesser extent-purchased via the Internet. The preference for a specific NPS depended on the desired effects (mostly stimulant or psychedelic), price (similar to MDMA or amphetamine), duration of effect (preferably around four hours), and setting (at home, at festivals, or in nightlife). Legal status was not relevant for the decision to use NPS. Most NPS are not superior to the already marketed drugs, and do not displace conventional illicit drug...|$|E

In more details, we propose a RoboCast algorithm that allows robots to broadcast their local coordinate systems to each others.

Overall recommendation A lighthouse Regional Manufacturing Innovation and Workforce Development Partnership be piloted, to pioneer a regional program of <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>and</b> shared workforce development accessible to small and medium businesses. This Government-funded model would be supported by creating seconded or earmarked cross-organisational staff positions and roles, with the brief of working across employer groups, key training organisations and the three tiers of government. Their brief would be to provide a focus for <b>gathering,</b> <b>exchanging</b> <b>and</b> disseminating <b>information</b> that is timely, targeted, well- integrated and readily digestible. This information would cover: - Case study approaches to setting up local innovation initiatives - Environmental scanning of technological developments and locally-relevant market opportunities in Australian and global markets - Best- practice tools such as strategies and resources for induction and advice about accessing customised delivery of accredited workplace, online and off-site learning to building workplace expertise - Regional Manufacturing occupational labour market data, and a regional job-matching website specifically for use by local employers and jobseekers. The Partnership would also provide funding and practical support for the creation of recognized workplace development programs and resource materials supporting small manufacturing businesses in training novices and in upskilling staff. The Partnership would have initial funding for five years, and be tasked with the specific mission of embedding into ongoing practice the structures and approaches it develops. Development of the Badgerys Creek Precinct provides a unique catalyst, with significant multiplier effects, for the creation of such a South Western Sydney Advanced Manufacturing Initiative, one of whose focal points might be an Advanced Manufacturing and Aircraft Maintenance hub...|$|R

40|$|This master’s thesis {{was aimed}} at researching the {{possibilities}} of a project for building a metropolis out of a former industrial region in southern Poland. The idea was to study the development strategies and plan, and the spatial status of the agglomeration region in Upper Silesia, to measure it against a framework of polycentric development model. What I could argue is the innovative element {{in the study was}} the incorporation in the framework of both polycentric principles and ‘livability’ principles. Livability is understood as the spatial and social characteristics that generate quality of life in the inhabitants. The purpose of adding livability to the planning stages of a project of this kind was to make quality of life a priority and a goal of the development, and not only a by-product, as it usually is. We are aware that commonly, economic development is pursued first in most given projects, specially in the countries of Eastern Europe, and lately environmental sustainability is the objective of the projects in Western Europe. The proposal of my thesis is to take an integral approach to planning and to put the balanced development of the person {{at the center of the}} urban and metropolitan planning. To achieve this, a combination of livability principles taken from the experience of some of the best cities to live in the world, and of polycentricity models as understood by the European Union institutions and documents was created. Measuring existing development plans like those of Upper Silesia, (and any other cases for that matter), with a certain degree of attention to the context (historical, social, political, economical, natural), the areas that are lacking importance in the spatial planning can be identified, and recommendations can be done to improve the livability of any metropolitan or combined region. Above all, a balanced development should be pursued to enhance quality of life and the attractiveness of the region, which in the long run translates into growth and welfare for the people. This particular study yielded interesting results to the case of Upper Silesia and their projected building of their metropolis, finding areas that were not considered before, and that could improve the livability of the city. Based on these results, two urban design proposals were put forward, addressing similar but individual issues: the building of Meeting Places Networks within city centres, and the establishing of Green Path Networks across the region. Both proposals complement each other to generate a better space and alternative uses for the inhabitants of the metropolis. The Meeting Place Network is based on a regeneration of the public realm to make the city navigable once more for the person on foot, rather than by motor vehicles. It doesn’t contemplate the erradication of vehicle traffic in the cities, but a better relationship between it and the public space. The network is designed between certain areas that are important for people <b>gathering</b> <b>and</b> <b>exchanging</b> experiences <b>and</b> <b>information</b> without recurring to the isolation of the automobile. By fostering these meeting places and linking them, it is believed that the city can reach a renewed level of livability for the inhabitants and also a new attractiveness for tourism and leisure activities. The city stops being fragmented spaces partitioned by street borders, or isolated building interiors, and becomes a whole navigable space for people walking or cycling, for popular culture, entertainment <b>and</b> personal <b>exchange.</b> The Green Paths further enhance this network by serving as walking, cycling and green area links between city cores and parks, serving as truly viable alternatives to private and public transport and an attractive mode of transport of the livable city. It if my belief that the thesis expresses clearly enough my interest in the enhancing of livability in both post-modern, post-industrial and emerging cities of all sizes. By returning the human being as the scale and center of the planning, and by integrating the necessary technological developments of the new society, a new level of livability can be achieved, where people truly live the city while keeping globally connected. + 48 696348678, ul.
