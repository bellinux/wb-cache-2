5|$|In Rome the portico of the Palazzo dei Conservatori {{sheltered}} {{offices of}} various guilds. Here disputes arising in the transaction of business were adjudicated, {{unless they were}} of sufficient importance to go before a communal tribunal, {{such as that of}} the conservatori. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> place for such activity. Until the 1470s the main market of the city was held on and around the campidoglio, while cattle continued to be taxed and sold in the ancient forum located just to the south.|$|E
25|$|In December 1610, Galileo Galilei {{used his}} {{telescope}} {{to observe that}} Venus showed all phases, just like the Moon.

25|$|In the Crewe manuscript, {{the earlier}} {{unpublished}} {{version of the}} poem, the Abyssinian maid is singing of Mount Amara, rather than Abora. Mount Amara is a real mountain, today called Amba Geshen, located in the Amhara Region of modern Ethiopia, {{formerly known as the}} Abyssinian Empire. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> fortress, and was the site of the royal treasury and the royal prison. The sons of the Emperors of Abyssinia, except for the heir, were held prisoner there, to prevent them from staging a coup against their father, until the Emperor's death.|$|E
25|$|During {{the metal}} type era, all type {{was cut in}} metal and could only be printed at a {{specific}} size. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> process to vary a design at different sizes, making it chunkier and clearer to read at smaller sizes. Many digital fonts are offered {{in a range of}} styles for different sizes, especially designs sold for professional printing use by companies such as Adobe. The art of designing fonts for a specific size is known as optical sizing. Others will be offered in only one style, but optimised for a specific size. Designs intended to be printed small may feature larger lower-case letters, chunkier stroke weights and thicker serifs, while fonts intended for display may be more slender. Optical sizes are particularly common for serif fonts, since the fine detail of serif fonts can need to be bulked up for smaller sizes.|$|E

25|$|First Nations {{used the}} river's valleys for the buffalo hunt, in which herds of buffalo were driven over cliffs or into valleys {{where they could}} be killed more easily with bows and arrows. Of all the First Nations groups that lived in the Bow River area, only the Nakoda fished the river regularly. While other groups likely caught fish during harder times, they {{primarily}} hunted buffalo during the summer season when fishing would have been most plentiful. The river's water naturally attracted game, which the First Nations men also hunted, while women gathered the roots, nuts and berries and processed them for food. The river's game, its local sources for firewood, and its valleys' shelter made the river a common camp location for First Nations during the prairie winters. The danger of crossing the river meant <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> boundary for First Nations. The two main fords of the lower Bow River, Blackfoot Crossing and a ford near the Bow's confluence with the Elbow River (where today's central Calgary developed), became important gathering points for southern Alberta's First Nations to exchange goods and celebrate festivities. Blackfoot Crossing was used by the Siksika as a winter campsite and is today a part of their reserve.|$|E
500|$|Neighborhoods was {{released}} to mixed reviews from critics; some felt <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> evolution from the band's previous releases, while others found it stale and disjointed. The album debuted at number {{two on the}} Billboard 200 and [...] "Up All Night" [...] and [...] "After Midnight" [...] were released as singles, with both attracting modest success on Billboards Alternative Songs chart. Despite this, Neighborhoods did not sell as well as earlier releases and the band would depart from Interscope the following fall. The group would later look back on their comeback album with divided feelings; DeLonge would admit that the recording methods perhaps created less unity within the group.|$|E
500|$|Kove's first {{ideas for}} The Danish Poet began {{when she went}} {{through a period of}} self-assessment; she wanted to write a story about what she {{described}} as when [...] "you reach a turning point or a milestone and you look back and you think 'how in the heck did I get here?' [...] And you realize that the answer lies somewhere in a complex web of all kinds of stuff, like genetic make-up, upbringing, coincidences, choices you made along the way, missed opportunities, [...] lucky breaks." [...] She felt that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> choice to centre on a relationship between two people, [...] "because relationships, and especially the romantic ones, play a huge role in shaping our lives, and also, obviously, in creating new ones." ...|$|E

500|$|McIlrath was {{inspired}} to write the lyrics for the song following a trip he took to New Orleans. While he had initially gone to discuss with local musicians how to merge politics and music, {{he was able to}} visit several areas affected by Hurricane Katrina and the subsequent flood, such as the Lower Ninth Ward. As McIlrath had felt that news outlets were quick to discuss less important stories following the disaster, he compiled his thoughts and wrote the song's lyrics. McIlrath also noted that his criticism of the United States government's handling of various disasters influenced the lyrics; he called Hurricane Katrina [...] "as much a man-made disaster as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> disaster", and lambasted the fact that no legislation was passed to prevent another oil spill following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{decision}} to eliminate the Kazon from future episodes, the writing team was uncertain if the season two finale and season three premiere would focus on them. Piller {{said that it was}} suggested that the episodes could serve as an introduction to a new alien species, but he supported the possibility that they act as a farewell to the Kazon storylines. He explained his decision by saying he [...] "felt we had built up this arc with them and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> conclusion". The Kazon were replaced by storylines focusing on the Vidiians, the Borg, and the Hirogen. Prior to the premiere of , [...] Donna Dickens speculated that Andrew Lincoln's appearance on the series could be as a character from the Kazon. While acknowledging fans' negative response to the alien species during Star Trek: Voyager, Dickens questioned if Star Trek: Discovery would be an appropriate venue for the Kazon to have a [...] "cameo comeback".|$|E

Owing to {{prohibitive}} strictures of the totalitarian regime, his work only gradually became widely appreciated in recent decades. Writes Jiří Machalický, [...] "Not everyone will understand Kubíček’s way of thinking in the same way. It is not a mathematical game, but an exact solution to problems, combined with intuition, without which art is impossible. And {{if we look at}} his work as a whole, it possesses an immeasurable logic found with few other artists, as well as the ability to open up other alternatives. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> part not only of Czech, but also of progressive European art, which continued to develop the legacy of pure abstraction and constructivist tendencies." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{the release}} of CNBLUE's fifth Japanese studio album Wave in September 2014, band member Lee Jong-hyun began forming ideas of {{releasing}} a single that slightly deviated from the band's music. He consulted his bandmates regarding the notion, but he [...] "didn't think very seriously about it". He felt that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> progression as a musician. He began working on the song during the CNBLUE 2014 Arena Tour [...] "Wave" [...] concerts and continued {{to work on the}} song during the 2014 FNC Kingdom in Japan: Starlight concerts, among various other opportunities. In creating the composition, he wanted to avoid making more sad songs and set out to make a [...] "fun" [...] song for live performances. He first began by playing a full phrase on a guitar before implementing different arrangements on a computer. [...] "White" [...] was announced as CNBLUE's ninth single on March 7, 2015, with a release date of April 8.|$|E
2500|$|Nanda's once mighty empire {{had been}} reduced to a strip of coastal Lower Burma (Pegu and the Irrawaddy delta). The former vassal rulers now {{effectively}} ignored the high king as inconsequential, instead now saw each other as rivals. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> return to multilateral relations among the smaller states that had existed before the rise of Toungoo Empire. Concerned by Nyaungyan's takeover of Upper Burma, Thado Dhamma Yaza III of Prome decided to invade the upcountry. But he was assassinated on [...] by one of his advisers. Toungoo tried to pick off Prome but the new ruler of Prome, Yan Naing, fended off Toungoo's attacks. In the middle Tai country too, chaos reigned. Lan Na and Lan Xang were locked in conflict. Lan Na's own vassals (Nan, Chaing Saen, Chiang Rai) were in revolt. Siam began to intervene the upcountry affairs in 1598, gaining Lan Na c. 1601/02 but chaos continued on the Lan Na countryside.|$|E
2500|$|Prior {{to recent}} history most {{postgraduate}} {{education in the}} United States was accomplished using the mentor system. A physician would finish a rotating internship and move to some town and be taught by the local physicians the skills needed for that particular town. This allowed each community's needs to be met by {{the teaching of the}} new general practitioner the skills needed in that community. This also allowed the new physician to start making a living and raising a family, etc. General practitioners would be the surgeons, the obstetricians, and the internists for their given communities. Changes in demographics and the growing complexities of the developing bodies of knowledge made it necessary to produce more highly trained surgeons and other specialists. For many physicians <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> desire to want to be considered [...] "specialists". What was not anticipated by many physicians is that an option to be a generalist would be abolished.|$|E
