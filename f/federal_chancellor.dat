5|$|Shortly before Hitler was {{eligible}} for parole, the Bavarian government attempted {{to have him}} deported back to Austria. The Austrian <b>federal</b> <b>chancellor</b> rejected the request on the specious grounds that his service in the German Army made his Austrian citizenship void. In response, Hitler formally renounced his Austrian citizenship on 7 April 1925.|$|E
5|$|The 1866 North German Constitution became (with some {{semantic}} adjustments) the 1871 Constitution of the German Empire. With this constitution, the new Germany acquired some democratic features: {{notably the}} Imperial Diet, which—in {{contrast to the}} parliament of Prussia—gave citizens representation {{on the basis of}} elections by direct and equal suffrage of all males who had reached the age of 25. Furthermore, elections were generally free of chicanery, engendering pride in the national parliament. However, legislation required the consent of the Bundesrat, the federal council of deputies from the states, in and over which Prussia had a powerful influence; Prussia could appoint 17 of 58 delegates with only 14 votes needed for a veto. Prussia thus exercised influence in both bodies, with executive power vested in the Prussian King as Kaiser, who appointed the <b>federal</b> <b>chancellor.</b> The chancellor was accountable solely to, and served entirely at the discretion of, the Emperor. Officially, the chancellor functioned as a one-man cabinet and was responsible for the conduct of all state affairs; in practice, the State Secretaries (bureaucratic top officials in charge of such fields as finance, war, foreign affairs, etc.) acted as unofficial portfolio ministers. With the exception of the years 1872–1873 and 1892–1894, the imperial chancellor was always simultaneously the prime minister of the imperial dynasty's hegemonic home-kingdom, Prussia. The Imperial Diet had the power to pass, amend, or reject bills, but it could not initiate legislation. (The power of initiating legislation rested with the chancellor.) The other states retained their own governments, but the military forces of the smaller states came under Prussian control. The militaries of the larger states (such as the Kingdoms of Bavaria and Saxony) retained some autonomy, but they underwent major reforms to coordinate with Prussian military principles and came under federal government control in wartime.|$|E
25|$|This {{resulted}} in new general elections in November, which {{resulted in}} a landslide victory (42.27% of the vote) of the conservative Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) led by <b>Federal</b> <b>Chancellor</b> Wolfgang Schüssel.

25|$|The Parliament of Austria {{consists}} of two chambers. The composition of the Nationalrat (183 seats) is determined every five years (or whenever the Nationalrat has been dissolved by the federal president on a motion by the <b>federal</b> <b>chancellor,</b> or by Nationalrat itself) by a general election in which every citizen over 16 years (since 2007) has voting rights.

25|$|The {{election}} held on 25 November 1945 was a {{blow for}} the Communist Party of Austria which received {{a bit more}} than 5% of the vote. The coalition of Christian Democrats (ÖVP) and Social Democrats (SPÖ), backed by 90% of the votes, assumed control over the cabinet and offered the position of <b>Federal</b> <b>Chancellor</b> to Christian Democrat Julius Raab. The Soviets vetoed Raab, due to his political role in the 1930s. Instead President Karl Renner, with the consent of parliament, appointed Leopold Figl, who was just barely acceptable to the Soviets. They responded with massive and coordinated expropriation of Austrian economic potential.|$|E

500|$|West Germany was {{established}} as a federal parliamentary republic with a [...] "social market economy". Starting in 1948 West Germany became a major recipient of reconstruction aid under the Marshall Plan and used this to rebuild its industry. Konrad Adenauer was elected the first <b>Federal</b> <b>Chancellor</b> (Bundeskanzler) of Germany in 1949 and remained in office until 1963. Under his and Ludwig Erhard's leadership, the country enjoyed prolonged economic growth {{beginning in the early}} 1950s, that became known as an [...] "economic miracle" [...] (Wirtschaftswunder).

500|$|In the 1999 general {{election}} the FPÖ won 27% of the votes, {{more than in}} any previous electionbeating the ÖVP [...] {{for the first time}} by a small margin. In February 2000, the ÖVP agreed to form a coalition government with the FPÖ. Normally, Haider should have become <b>federal</b> <b>chancellor.</b> [...] However, it soon became apparent that Haider was too controversial {{to be part of the}} government, let alone lead it. Amid intense international criticism of the FPÖ's participation in the government, the FPÖ ceded the chancellorship to Wolfgang Schüssel of the ÖVP. As a concession to the FPÖ, the party was given power to appoint the Ministers of Finance and Social Affairs. Later that month Haider stepped down as party chairman, replaced by Susanne Riess-Passer. Having threatened a diplomatic boycott of Austria, the other fourteen European Union (EU) countries introduced sanctions after the government had been formed; other than formal EU meetings, contacts with Austria were reduced. The measures were justified by the EU, which stated that [...] "the admission of the FPÖ into a coalition government legitimises the extreme right in Europe." ...|$|E

The submissions had ranged from a complete restructuring of the auditorium to {{a replica of the}} original design; Boltenstern decided on a design similar to the original with some modernisation in keeping with the design of the 1950s. In order to achieve a good acoustic, wood was the favoured building material, at the advice of, among others, Arturo Toscanini. In addition, the number of seats in the parterre (stalls) was reduced, and the fourth gallery, which had been fitted with columns, was restructured so as not to need columns. The façade, entrance hall and the [...] "Schwind" [...] foyer were restored and remain in their original style.|$|E

50|$|The <b>federal</b> <b>chancellor's</b> {{dual role}} as {{executive}} officeholder and heavyweight party official well-connected {{to the legislature}} makes him or her far {{more powerful than the}} formally senior federal president. Actual executive authority thus lies with the chancellor and his or her ministers, while the federal president is a figurehead rather than an actual head of government. Austria's presidents are largely content with their ceremonial role, striving for the role of impartial mediator and dignified Elder Statesman, and more or less consistently steer clear of the murky waters of hands-on politics. The stern frown worn by the late president Thomas Klestil while swearing in Wolfgang Schüssel's controversial cabinets was at the time widely considered the strongest unilateral political statement made by any Austrian president. In recent times, however, the current holder of office, Heinz Fischer, has been known to comment on current political issues from time to time.|$|R
