40|$|Organization of heat {{exchange}} in the evaporator of a loop heat pipe (LHP) by {{the principle of}} inverted menisci is connected with considerable non-uniformity of heat flow on an evaporating surface that reduces LHP operating characteristics. The paper considers a possible variant concerning  decrease of this non-uniformity which is not connected with the usage of an internal surface of powder capillary structure that starts playing a role at partial <b>drainage</b> of  a <b>pore</b> <b>space.</b> This variant presupposes creation {{of a system of}} vapor-outlet channels located inside of the capillary structure on some distance from the evaporator wall. The paper shows that such design of the LHP evaporator makes it possible to distribute heat flow on an evaporating surface much more uniformly and decrease a maximum heat flow density by several folds. Thus it is possible significantly to intensify a {{heat exchange}} process and increase a critical average heat flow and also reduce a temperature of an LHP evaporator body. </p...|$|R

Fluid transport depends on where <b>pore</b> <b>spaces</b> are located in the soil, and for this reason, it is important to identify pore zones. The low contrast between soil and <b>pore</b> <b>space</b> in CT images presents a problem with respect to pore quantification. In this paper, we present a methodology that integrates image processing, clustering techniques and artificial neural networks, in order to classify <b>pore</b> <b>space</b> in soil images. Image processing was used for the feature extraction of images. Three clustering algorithms were implemented (K-means, Fuzzy C-means, and Self Organising Maps) to segment images. The objective of clustering process is to find pixel groups of a similar grey level intensity and to organise them into more or less homogeneous groups. The segmented images are used for test a classifier. An Artificial Neural Network is characterised by a great degree of modularity and flexibility, and it is very efficient for large-scale and generic pattern recognition applications. For these reasons, an Artificial Neural Network was used to classify soil images into two classes (<b>pore</b> <b>space</b> and solid soil).

The algorithm distinguishes between the ‘‘pore bodies’’ and ‘‘pore throats,’’ and establishes their respective volumes and connectivity. The proposed algorithm also produces a stick-and-ball diagram of the rock <b>pore</b> <b>space.</b> The tests on a pack of equal spheres, for which the results are verifiable, confirm its stability. The impact of image resolution on the algorithm output is investigated on the images of computer-generated <b>pore</b> <b>space.</b> One of distinctive features of our approach is that no image thinning is applied. Instead, {{the information about the}} skeleton is stored through the maximal inscribed balls or spheres (MIS) associated with each voxel. These maximal balls retain information about the entire <b>pore</b> <b>space.</b> Comparison with the results obtained by a thinning procedure preserving some topological properties of the <b>pore</b> <b>space</b> shows that our method produces more realistic estimates of the number and shapes of pore bodies and pore throats, and the pore coordination numbers. The distribution of maximal inscribed spheres makes possible simulation of mercury injection and computation of the corresponding dimensionless capillary pressure curve. It turns out that the calculated capillary pressure curve is a robust descriptor of the <b>pore</b> <b>space</b> geometry and, in particular, can be used to determine the quality of computer-based rock reconstruction...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} the {{follow-up}} to a previous one devoted to soil <b>pore</b> <b>space</b> modelling. In the previous study, we proposed algorithms to represent soil <b>pore</b> <b>space</b> by means of optimal piecewise approximation using simple 3 D geometrical primitives: balls, cylinders, cones, etc. In the present study, we use the ball-based piecewise approximation to simulate biological activity. The basic idea for modelling <b>pore</b> <b>space</b> consists in representing <b>pore</b> <b>space</b> using a minimal set of maximal balls (Delaunay spheres) recovering the shape skeleton. In this representation, each ball is considered as a maximal local cavity corresponding to the "intuitive" notion of a pore {{as described in the}} literature. The space segmentation induced by the network of balls (pores) is then used to spatialise biological dynamics. Organic matter and microbial decomposers are distributed within the balls (pores). A valuated graph representing the pore network, organic matter and microorganism distribution is then defined. Microbial soil organic matter decomposition is simulated by updating this valuated graph. The method has been implemented and tested on real data. As far as we know, this approach is the first one to formally link <b>pore</b> <b>space</b> geometry and biological dynamics. The long-term goal is to define geometrical typologies of <b>pore</b> <b>space</b> shape that can be attached to specific biological dynamic properties.

The model is {{developed as a}} component of a more general hydromechanical coupling framework based on the discrete element method, which will be elaborated in future papers. Here the emphasis is on the generation of a network of pores mapping the void space between spherical grains, and the definition of local criteria governing the primary <b>drainage</b> process. The <b>pore</b> <b>space</b> is decomposed by Regular Triangulation, from which a set of pores connected by throats are identified. A local entry capillary pressure is evaluated for each throat, based on the balance of capillary pressure and surface tension at equilibrium. The model reflects the possible entrapment of disconnected patches of the receding wetting phase. It is validated by a comparison with drainage experiments. A series of simulations are reported to illustrate size and boundary effects, key questions when studying small samples made of spherical particles be it in simulations or experiments. Repeated tests on samples of different sizes give evolution of water content which are not only scattered but also strongly biased for small sample sizes. More than 20, 000 spheres are needed to reduce the bias on saturation below 0. 02. Additional statistics are generated by subsampling a large sample of 64, 000 spheres. They suggest that the minimal sampling volume for evaluating saturation is one hundred times greater that the sampling volume needed for measuring porosity with the same accuracy. This requirement in terms of sample size induces a need for efficient computer codes. The method described herein has a low algorithmic complexity in order to satisfy this requirement. It will be well suited to further developments toward coupled flow-deformation problems in which evolution of the microstructure require frequent updates of the pore network.

The growth features observed for barite imply a crystallization sequence in the experiments. In the beginning, the growth of the barite crystals is tabular (Fig.  10) with a size of approx. 15  µm in the larger <b>pore</b> <b>spaces.</b> Once a barite crystal is formed, it acts as a seed and is overgrown by further barite precipitations forming a crystal agglomerate (Fig.  11).

In the latter case, the barite overgrows the illite along the margins of the pore (Fig.  12). Quartz grains have smooth surfaces with small holes and often show dissolution edges (Fig.  18), whereas such features are absent in the feldspar. Especially in the smaller pores and cracks, subhedral baryte crystals grow together forming crystal aggregates. With increasing growth or narrowing of the <b>pore</b> <b>spaces,</b> the crystals preferentially accumulate at the bottlenecks of the <b>pore</b> <b>spaces</b> (Fig.  13).
