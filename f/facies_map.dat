40|$|Mapping {{surficial}} seafloor facies (sand, silt, muddy sand, rock, etc.) {{should be}} the first step in marine geological studies and is crucial when modeling sediment processes, pollution transport, deciphering tectonics, and defining benthic habitats. This report outlines an empirical technique that predicts the distribution of seafloor facies for a large area offshore Los Angeles, CA using high-resolution bathymetry and co-registered, calibrated backscatter from multibeam echosounders (MBES) correlated to ground-truth sediment samples. The technique uses a series of procedures that involve supervised classification and a hierarchical decision tree classification that are now available in advanced image-analysis software packages. Derivative variance images of both bathymetry and acoustic backscatter are calculated from the MBES data and then used in a hierarchical decision-tree framework to classify the MBES data into areas of rock, gravelly muddy sand, muddy sand, and mud. A quantitative accuracy assessment on the classification results is performed using ground-truth sediment samples. The predicted <b>facies</b> <b>map</b> is also ground-truthed using seafloor photographs and high-resolution sub-bottom seismic-reflection profiles.

Many such maps represent experiments in methodology, and {{the wide variety of}} patterns displayed on the maps presents many problems of interpretation. In part, interpretation f facies maps depends upon the scale of the map, the magnitude of the stratigraphic interval, the geographic area involved, and the relative rate of change of the facies in the map area. In general, two types of maps are recognized: regional *naps, which show broad trends over large areas, and local maps, which show greater detail in smaller areas.

The isopach map of the stratigraphic unit is used as a base for the <b>facies</b> <b>map,</b> and interpreta-tion of the facies patterns i closely related to interpretation f the isopach lines.

Since the dam removal, an estimated 50, 000 cubic yards of sediment has eroded from the banks and channel at the former dam site.

To evaluate characteristics of the sediment deposition, we performed roughly 60 pebble counts and created a <b>facies</b> <b>map</b> for a 1. 43 mi stretch downstream of the former dam site.

This study provides {{insights into the}} primary sedimentological and early alteration characteristics of an isolated fringing reef system (Kaledupa-Hoga) from the Tukang Besi Archipelago, SE Asia. A combined multispectral satellite imagery, field and petrographic study allowed for the generation of an environmental <b>facies</b> <b>map,</b> which acts {{as a model for}} the distribution of primary sedimentological characteristics in relation to the primary environmental facies. The islands of the Tukang Besi Archipelago are mesotidal ( 71 % accuracy when compared with field and sedimentary data. With the exception of the reef crest and reef slope that commonly have widths on a sub-imaging resolution (< 30 m), the <b>facies</b> <b>map</b> accurately demonstrates the heterogeneous nature of the carbonate system. Although field and satellite imagery observations reveal ten environmental facies, sedimentological characterisation results in a lower number of distinctive categories due to the similarity of many deposits. Foreshore/backshore and bare intertidal deposits are distinctive and are composed of reef-derived material that has been reworked shorewards. Seagrass-associated facies all show some fine silt-clay sized material (< 8 %) with common imperforate foraminifera and pervasive micritisation, but also contain high abundances of reworked coral and shell allochems. Coral-associated reef flat facies are typically low in imperforate but high in perforate foraminifera, and show lesser effects of bioerosion and very low silt contents. The reef slope and crest are characterised by high abundances of gravel-sized fragmented corals with the highest abundances of echinoderm material and alcyonarian sclerites. Sediment samples across all fringing reef environments from the Kaledupa-Hoga transects are characterised almost exclusively by grain-rudstone textures, with < 2 - 5 % silt and clay size fractions, and minor baffling of fines in seagrass-associated settings (grain-packstones). The paucity of fines across the fringing reef systems as a whole, and the degree of homogenisation of sediment characteristics across the different field- and satellite-identifiable environmental facies are attributed to: (1) high wave/current energies, (2) the small size of the islands rendering limited protection, (3) bidirectional monsoon winds and (4) the lack of reef rimmed margins built to sea level.

Regional aeromagnetic and structural data suggest that thrust style faulting may have caused the extensive lithological repetition observed within the Cabonne Group. Volcanic <b>facies</b> <b>mapping,</b> combined with geochemical sampling, has provided a basis for re-interpretation of areas within the Cabonne Group. <b>Facies</b> <b>mapping</b> has demonstrated {{a number of possible}} stratigraphic correlations, including a possible link between limestones present at and surrounding Browns Creek with limestones within the Weemalla Formation {{at the base of the}} Forest Reefs Volcanics. Geochemical and petrological data define a temporal change in magmatic affinities within the Ordovician volcanics of the Molong Volcanic Belt. This change in magmatism from high Kin the Blayney Volcanics to shoshonitic in the Forest Reefs Volcanics is broadly coincident with the late Middle Ordovician limestone interval at the base of the Forest Reefs Volcanics. This broad lithochemical stratigraphy provides a framework for comparisons with the Ordovician Junee-Narromine volcanic belt located 100 km to the west, where a similar temporal transition exists from high-Kin the Nelungaloo Volcanics to shoshonitic in the overlying Goonumbla Volcanics. The Ordovician volcanics from the Molong belt are also similar to the early to midMiocene calc-alkaline to shoshonitic suites from Fiji.

They consist mainly of conglomerates with quartzite pebbles, sandstones, and sandy, loamy, and marly deposits, all with a deep red colour. Detailed analyses were made on grain size composition, on pebble roundness, and on sand grain roundness and sphericity. The results are presented in triangle-diagrams for nomenclature, cumulative curves of size frequency distributions, graphs showing changes of sediment properties with transport distance, and in a <b>facies</b> <b>map.</b> The following conclusions can be drawn: (1) the source area of the sediments was a mountain chain with outcropping Paleozoic and Mesozoic deposits and their weathering products; (2) the transport of the debris occurred by rivers, which flowed in a south-easterly direction; (3) the deposition took place in the mountain foreland, the coarse sediments being deposited nearer to the mountain area than the finer ones; (4) the transport length was fairly short; (5) the conglomerates exposed in the source area provided rounded pebbles to the gravelly sediments deposited in the basins (6) the rivers left the mountain area at the same sites as the present ones. Finally the description of two type locality sections gives an impression of the red bed lithology...|$|E
40|$|The Middle Permian lower Beaufort Group in the {{southern}} main Karoo Basin comprises of the fluvio-lacustrine Abrahamskraal and the overlying Teekloof and correlative Middleton Formations. These units are mainly made up of mudrocks with subordinate fine-grained sandstone-rich intervals. The objective of this mainly qualitative facies analysis study is {{the evaluation of the}} vertical and lateral abundances of the facies associations in order to decouple the preserved tectonic and climatic signals in the formations. The results on the stratigraphic trends should aid paleo-environmental, paleontological, and basin analysis studies, and improve our understanding of reservoir dynamics (e. g., permeability, connectivity) when used as outcrop analogues for subsurface fluvial reservoirs. High resolution <b>facies</b> <b>mapping</b> showed that flat-topped, laterally continuous (for 10 s of Kms) channel-belt complexes are the most common external architecture of the channel sandstones in all formations...|$|R
30|$|From {{the result}} of the {{strategy}} 1, the significance of TI in MPS is confirmed once again because soft data such as a <b>facies</b> probability <b>map</b> can provide information about the guideline level only. If the quality of TI is very low, setting tau 1 to be less than tau 2 may increase the effect of pseudo-soft data over TI on facies modeling.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} indicator based geostatistical methods (Indicator Kriging and Sequential Indicator Simulations),mostly {{used for}} <b>facies</b> <b>mapping</b> or <b>facies</b> modeling. Although {{it is assumed}} that in facies modelling variables should be descrete, it is possible to apply these methods on continuous variables as well. Continuous variables such as porosity can very well describe lithofacies. Methodology includes series of cut-offs. Indicator Kriging maps show probability of certain lithofacies appearing in some location. On the other hand, stochastical realizations provide different number of solutions for the same input data set. Those solutions can be very similar, but never identical. It is important to emphasize that all obtained solutions or results are equally probable. Results of Sequential Indicator Simulations are also probability maps. There are several advantages for Indicator based methods. They do not need normality for the input dataset, they can be implemented in case of bimodal distribution, and they can show connectivity of the largest or smallest values...|$|R
