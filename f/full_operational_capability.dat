5|$|In January 2016, Russia, for {{the first}} time in combat conditions, {{deployed}} four Su-35S planes to Khmeimim air base in Syria as part of Russian air operations in the country. This occurred following an increase in tension between Russia and Turkey as a result of reported incursions by Russian aircraft into Turkish airspace. The aircraft complemented the Su-30SMs in flying combat air patrols and providing protection to other aircraft that were conducting bombing missions. As a result of operations in Syria, problems were identified with the aircraft's avionics and were subsequently rectified. The aircraft presumably attained <b>full</b> <b>operational</b> <b>capability</b> in September 2017.|$|E
5|$|The Westland Apache {{experienced}} {{delays in}} entering service due to complications with the modifications made for British service. Prior to the Apache entering service in 2004, several development problems were noted, including {{a lack of}} the ability to securely communicate with other helicopters and a risk of damage to the tail rotor and airframe from firing its Hellfire missiles. The problem with using the Hellfire was debris generated by the firing of missiles, both the Hellfire and CRV7 rockets, could strike the body of the aircraft and cause damage; resolving this issue created a delay to training programmes. These problems were corrected prior to entering service, a secure communications suite was installed and Hellfire missiles are routinely fired by Apaches. In 2002, government sources stated that <b>full</b> <b>operational</b> <b>capability</b> was set to be achieved by 2010.|$|E

40|$|Since {{the end of}} {{the last}} war in Kosovo, June 1999, Kosovo has been under the sole defense of {{thousands}} of NATO troops who have had the task and duty from security and public order to border security and protection of all residents. Given the fact that NATO and KFOR troops are reducing their presence in Kosovo rapidly, the latter needs to act and strengthen its own security and defense capability in order not to allow any security vacuum in the territory of the Republic of Kosovo in the post 2012 period. Kosovo has been through security challenges, from having no security structure to building up a modern security force whose mandate is mostly non-conventional military duties, but only humanitarian and civil protection tasks and missions. However, this Capstone Project recommends the following actions to the Government of Kosovo: 1. KSF has to reach <b>full</b> <b>operational</b> <b>capabilities</b> (FOC) as soon as possible 2. Implement constitutional review Kosovo’s Future Defense Force 3. To accelerate strategic regional compatibility: euroatlantic integration initiatives starting from membership into Adriatic Charter 4.

40|$|With the <b>full</b> GPS <b>operational</b> <b>capability</b> in the mid- 1990 s, it {{has been}} used as a {{stand-alone}} system for many land applications that require fast and precise positioning such as mining, heavy construction, precision farming, and automated highway systems as well as in other high-traffic land-based applications. However, there are situations where GPS by itself does not provide the desired accuracy, for example when satellite signals are blocked or when the achievable accuracy is restricted by the geometry of the satellite constellation. In these situations, augmentation of GPS using ground-based GPS transmitters, pseudolites can be used to enhance the availability, accuracy, and reliability of the GPS-derived position solution. This research builds on the current work between the SNAP (Satellite Navigation And Positioning) group at The University of New South Wales, Sydney, and the DSO National Laboratories, Singapore. They are jointly developing a local area augmentation system able to provide high accuracy navigation for aircraft approach and landing. The first phase of this autolanding system development consists of a carrier-smoothed code-phase differential GPS/pseudolite technique to determine the feasibility of a robust differential GPS/PL technique for aircraft precision approach and landing. This paper assesses the performance of the carrier-smoothed code-phase differential GPS/pseudolite algorithm to be used for land applications. Preliminary post-processed results are presented and analysed of vehicle trials at La Perouse and Coogee, Australia...|$|R
5|$|In 2007, the Australian {{government}} decided to retire the F-111s by 2010, and acquire 24 Boeing F/A-18F Super Hornets as an interim replacement, pending {{the arrival of}} the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning then being developed. The F-111 fleet was considered to be at risk due to fatigue, and too expensive to operate as each aircraft required 180 hours of maintenance for every hour of flying time. No.1 Squadron ceased operating the F-111 in January 2009, in preparation for converting to the Super Hornet. Former F-111 aircrew, familiar with side-by-side seating and a different performance envelope, found conversion more challenging than pilots experienced in the RAAF's McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet fighters, which shared many characteristics with the newer model. No.1 Squadron re-equipped between 26March 2010 and 21October 2011, making it the first Australian unit, and the first squadron outside the United States, to fly the Super Hornet. It became operational with its new aircraft on 8December 2011. The multi-role Super Hornet allowed No.1 Squadron to augment its previous offensive strike role with an air-to-air combat function. The RAAF attained <b>full</b> <b>operational</b> <b>capability</b> with the Super Hornet in December 2012.|$|E
5|$|The Special Air Service Regiment {{owes its}} {{heritage}} to the RAR. Originally formed as the 1st SAS Company in 1957, in 1960 {{it became an}} independent company of the RAR and was tasked with providing the army's special operations capability. The SASR became a regiment {{in its own right}} on 20 August 1964, severing the link with the RAR at this time. Re-raised as a commando battalion from 1997, 4 RAR (Commando) served in East Timor as a conventional light-role battalion in 2001, before focusing on the development of its special operations capability. In this role the battalion was designed to be a flexible, self-contained force element able to deploy at short notice to undertake offensive operations in support of Australia's national interests. Once <b>full</b> <b>operational</b> <b>capability</b> was reached, elements of 4 RAR (Commando) would serve in Timor Leste, Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as providing a domestic counter terrorism capability as part of Tactical Assault Group (East). In 2009, 4 RAR (Commando) was renamed the 2nd Commando Regiment, and as such is no longer part of the RAR. Rather than being formally disbanded, 4 RAR remained on the Army's order of battle with its colours and traditions maintained and protected, ready to be re-raised in the future if required.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study aims {{to explore}} the effect of supply chain {{integration}} (SCI) on <b>operational</b> <b>capability.</b> Using data collected from 201 Malaysian small- and medium-sized manufacturers (SMMs) and rigorous structural equation modeling methods, a total of one main effect and four sub-effects were hypothesized and tested. All the proposed hypotheses {{were found to be}} significant, suggesting positive relationships between SCI and <b>operational</b> <b>capability,</b> as well as between sub-constructs of SCI and <b>operational</b> <b>capability.</b> Overall, the findings are particularly important for SMMs owing to resource paucity and the need to draw upon SCI in order to ensure a sustainable <b>operational</b> <b>capability.</b> Recommendations for how to improve <b>operational</b> <b>capability</b> are provided accordingly...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between supply chain practices and business performance {{has been widely}} investigated by many academics and practitioners; however, the relationship is not yet fully understood. Therefore, this paper aims to examine the relevance of several prominent theories in strategic management for explaining the mediating role of <b>operational</b> <b>capability</b> in the {{relationship between}} supply chain practices and business performance. The resource-based view of the firm and neo-institutional theory are reviewed for their applicability to relate supply chain practices and <b>operational</b> <b>capability</b> in explaining sustained business performance. Supply chain practices are insufficient to drive business performance. Firms need to be able simultaneously to increase efficiency through supply chain practices and to be innovative through <b>operational</b> <b>capability.</b> Specifically, <b>operational</b> <b>capability</b> is forwarded as a key firm-specific capability that can result in significant and long-term improvement in organisational sustainability. <b>Operational</b> <b>capability</b> can serve as a critical mediating factor that better transmits the ambitions of supply chain practices onto business performance. As such, this paper provides a conceptual support to urge further research to empirically evaluate the relationship between supply chain practices, <b>operational</b> <b>capability</b> and business performance...|$|R
40|$|Based on the resource-based view of {{the firm}} (RBV) and the resource/capability {{perspective}} of innovation, this study explores the independent and complementary effects of two types of innovation capability (namely product development <b>capability</b> and <b>operational</b> <b>capability)</b> on market performance {{in a sample of}} 2971 Chinese industrial firms. Product development <b>capability</b> and <b>operational</b> <b>capability</b> have different degrees of firm specificity in terms of the technological complexity of underlying resources. We further explore industry dynamism as an important moderating effect on the relationship between different types of innovation capability and market performance. Our findings suggest that,in the Chinese firms surveyed, both product development and <b>operational</b> <b>capability</b> in innovation positively contribute to market performance. The effect of <b>operational</b> <b>capability</b> is notably stronger than that of product development capability. We also confirm the complementary effect of <b>operational</b> <b>capability</b> with product development capability in enhancing market performance. Our findings further suggest that product development capability tends to have a stronger effect on market performance when the level of industry dynamism is low, while the impact of <b>operational</b> <b>capability</b> on market performance is stronger in industries with a relatively high level of dynamism...|$|R

40|$|Location {{systems are}} seen as a {{promising}} technology for tracking people and objects to improve efficiency and quality in the healthcare domain. To increase the chances of success when introducing this new technology there are certain <b>operational</b> <b>capabilities</b> that need to be understood. The purpose of this Thesis is to explore how these <b>operational</b> <b>capabilities</b> can be assessed by experiment. The thesis proposes a method for describing the <b>operational</b> <b>capabilities</b> of a location system using a two-dimensional matrix of purposes of location systems in the healthcare domain, as found in literature. Using this matrix it is possible to assess and predict the requirements for a location system based on a classification of the purpose of the installation. Conversely it is possible to use the same matrix to find purposes that can be solved with a given location system. Using the Sonitor Indoor Positioning System it was also demonstrated how the <b>operational</b> <b>capabilities</b> of a location system could be found through a series of small low cost and low effort experiments. In conclusion three dimensions relating to <b>operational</b> <b>capabilities</b> were identified: granularity, resolution, and concurrency. Granularity and concurrency were shown to be successfully assessed through experiment, while resolution was found analytically. We also found a method to predict the impact of infrastructure size on the <b>operational</b> <b>capability</b> of the location system based on the same small experiments. </p...|$|R

25|$|The {{satellite}} navigation system GLONASS was conceived {{in the late}} 1960s, and formal requirements were completed in 1970. The government of the Soviet Union {{made a decision to}} develop the system in 1976. Design work was carried out by specialists led by Vladimir Cheremisin at NPO PM in Krasnoyarsk-26. The first launch took place in 1982. Until its dissolution in 1991, the Soviet Union launched 43 GLONASS-related satellites. Work on the system was continued by the Russian Federation which brought it its <b>full</b> <b>operational</b> <b>capability</b> in 1995. In the following years, the system fell into disrepair due to the economic crisis in the country and diminished space funding. Starting from 2000, the government under President Vladimir Putin made the restoration of GLONASS a top priority; its funding was doubled and after a lull of several years, launches were restarted again. In 2003, a new satellite design, GLONASS-M, was introduced. By early 2011, GLONASS had 22 operational satellites, two short of the required constellation of 24 to provide global coverage. The latest and significantly improved satellite type, GLONASS-K, is set to be launched in February 2011.|$|E
