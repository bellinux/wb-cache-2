The erecting curve was optimized and different stress and impact problems of Multi-stage Cylinder were studied {{to establish the}} system model. Fuzzy PID control algorithm was used to co-simulate in erecting process to optimize the control parameters, which can weaken impact when the working parts was in place in erecting process. The experiment shows that the erecting time is about 50 s and collision is decreased when the Multi-stage Cylinder is stickled out in grade change to reduce hydraulic impact. So it may be have an important guidance and application value in engineering. I...|$|E

40|$|A {{method is}} {{proposed}} to introduce instrumented balloons into tornadoes {{by means of}} the radial pressure gradient, which supplies a buoyancy force driving to the center. Presented are analytical expressions, verified by computer calculations, which show the possibility of introducing instrumented balloons into tornadoes at or below the cloud base. The times required to reach the center are small enough that a large fraction of tornadoes are suitable for the technique. An experimental procedure is outlined in which a research airplane puts an instrumented, self-inflating balloon on the track ahead of the tornado. The uninflated balloon waits until the tornado closes to, typically, 750 meters; then it quickly inflates and spirals up and into the core, taking roughly 3 minutes. Since the drive to the center is automatically produced by the radial pressure gradient, a proper launch radius is the only guidance requirement. Prepared at Langley Research Center. "November 1971.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{vibratory}} angular acceleration on detection thresholds for constant angular acceleration in a dynamic flight simulator {{are reported in}} three experiments. Detection thresholds were determined for 10 pilots and four nonpilots using a random, double-staircase procedure while the subjects sat <b>erect</b> in a <b>device</b> which rotated about an earth-vertical axis. Constant angular acceleration were presented for 0. 5 and 1. 0 s with concurrent, vibratory angular acceleration at 1 and 5 Hz, and thresholds with no vibratory angular acceleration were established. The thresholds were obtained while the subjects observed a visual reference in the enclosed cockpit in two experiments and in total darkness in a third. The results confirmed earlier experiments showing an inverse relationship between the duration of constant angular acceleration and detection threshold and showed that the detection thresholds in darkness were higher than with a visual reference present. Two analyses of variance revealed {{no significant differences in}} thresholds across the three vibration conditions. These results indicate that vibratory angular acceleration of fairly high levels can be present in a dynamic flight simulator without masking the pilot's ability to detect either maneuver or disturbance motions...|$|R

We also describe several examples of how different devices might be extended with embedded security functionality and outline some challenges of designing and managing self-securing devices. 1. Overview From all indications, assured OS security seems to be an impossible goal. Worse, conventional security architectures are brittle by design, because a small number of border protections (e. g., firewalls and/or host OSs) are used to protect a large number of resources and services. For example, an attacker who compromises a machine’s OS gains complete control over all resources of that machine. Thus, such an intruder gains the ability to transmit anything onto the network, modify anything on the disk, and examine all input device signals (e. g., typing patterns and video feeds). Likewise, an attacker who circumvents firewall-based protection has free reign within the “protected ” environment. Having shared border protections for large sets of resources creates three fundamental difficulties: (1) the many interfaces and functionalities for the many resources (e. g., consider most multi-purpose OSs) make correct implementation and administration extremely difficult; the practical implications are daily security alerts for popular OSs (e. g., Windows NT and Linux) and network applications (e. g., e-mail and web); (2) the ability of successful attackers to freely manipulate everything beyond the border protection greatly complicates most phases of security management...|$|R
6000|$|In {{times of}} old, when Time was young, And poets their own verses sung, A verse would draw a stone or beam, That now would {{overload}} a team; Lead 'em a dance {{of many a}} mile, Then rear 'em to a goodly pile. Each number had its diff'rent power; Heroic strains could build a tower; Sonnets and elegies to Chloris, Might raise a house about two stories; A lyric ode would slate; a catch Would tile; an epigram would thatch. [...] Now Poets feel this art is lost, Both to their own and landlord's cost. Not one of all the tuneful throng Can hire a lodging for a song. For Jove consider'd well the case, That poets were a numerous race; And if they all had power to build, The earth would very soon be fill'd: Materials would be quickly spent, And houses would not give a rent. The God of Wealth was therefore made Sole patron of the building trade; Leaving to wits the spacious air, With license to build castles there: In right whereof their old pretence To lodge in garrets comes from thence. There is a worm by Phoebus bred, By leaves of mulberry is fed, Which unprovided where to dwell, Conforms itself to weave a cell; Then curious hands this texture take, And for themselves fine garments make. Meantime a pair of awkward things Grow to his back instead of wings; He flutters when he thinks he flies, Then sheds about his spawn and dies. Just such an insect of the age Is he that scribbles for the stage; His birth he does from Phoebus raise, And feeds upon imagin'd bays; Throws all his wit and hours away In twisting up an ill spun Play: This gives him lodging and provides A stock of tawdry shift besides. With the unravell'd shreds of which The under wits adorn their speech: And now he spreads his little fans, (For all the Muses Geese are Swans) And borne on Fancy's pinions, thinks He soars sublimest when he sinks: But scatt'ring round his fly-blows, dies; Whence broods of insect-poets rise. [...] Premising thus, in modern way, The greater part I have to say; Sing, Muse, the house of Poet Van, In higher strain than we began. [...] Van (for 'tis fit the reader know it) Is both a Herald and a Poet; No wonder then if nicely skill'd In each capacity to build. As Herald, he can in a day Repair a house gone to decay; Or by achievements, arms, <b>device,</b> <b>Erect</b> a new one in a trice; And poets, if they had their due, By ancient right are builders too: This made him to Apollo pray For leave to build--the poets way. His prayer was granted, for the God Consented with the usual nod. [...] After hard throes of many a day Van was delivered of a play, Which in due time brought forth a house, Just as the mountain did the mouse. One story high, one postern door, And one small chamber on a floor, Born like a phoenix from the flame: But neither bulk nor shape the same; As animals of largest size Corrupt to maggots, worms, and flies; A type of modern wit and style, The rubbish of an ancient pile; So chemists boast they have a power, From the dead ashes of a flower Some faint resemblance to produce, But not the virtue, taste, nor juice. So modern rhymers strive to blast The poetry of ages past; Which, having wisely overthrown, They from its ruins build their own.|$|R

For Jove consider'd well the case, Observed they grew a numerous race; And should they build as fast as write, 'Twould ruin undertakers quite. This evil, therefore, to prevent, He wisely changed their element: On earth the God of Wealth was made Sole patron of the building trade; Leaving the Wits the spacious air, With license to build castles there: And 'tis conceived their old pretence To lodge in garrets comes from thence. [...] Premising thus, in modern way, The better half we have to say; Sing, Muse, the house of Poet Van, In higher strains than we began. [...] Van (for 'tis fit the reader know it) Is both a Herald[2] and a Poet; No wonder then if nicely skill'd In both capacities to build. As Herald, he can in a day Repair a house gone to decay; Or, by achievements, arms, <b>device,</b> <b>Erect</b> a new one in a trice; And as a poet, he has skill To build in speculation still. [...] "Great Jove!" [...] he cried, [...] "the art restore To build by verse as heretofore, And make my Muse the architect; What palaces shall we erect! No longer shall forsaken Thames Lament his old Whitehall in flames; A pile shall from its ashes rise, Fit to invade or prop the skies." [...] Jove smiled, and, like a gentle god, Consenting with the usual nod, Told Van, he knew his talent best, And left the choice to his own breast. So Van resolved to write a farce; But, well perceiving wit was scarce, With cunning that defect supplies: Takes a French play as lawful prize;[3] Steals thence his plot and ev'ry joke, Not once suspecting Jove would smoke; And (like a wag set down to write) Would whisper to himself, [...] "a bite." [...] Then, from this motley mingled style, Proceeded to erect his pile. So men of old, to gain renown, did Build Babel with their tongues confounded. Jove saw the cheat, but thought it best To turn the matter to a jest; Down from Olympus' top he slides, Laughing as if he'd burst his sides: Ay, thought the god, are these your tricks, Why then old plays deserve old bricks; And since you're sparing of your stuff, Your building shall be small enough. He spake, and grudging, lent his aid; Th'experienced bricks, that knew their trade, (As being bricks at second hand,) Now move, and now in order stand. [...] The building, as the Poet writ, Rose in proportion to his wit-- And first the prologue built a wall; So wide as to encompass all. The scene, a wood, produc'd no more Than a few scrubby trees before. The plot as yet lay deep; and so A cellar next was dug below; But this a work so hard was found, Two acts it cost him under ground. Two other acts, we may presume, Were spent in building each a room. Thus far advanc'd, he made a shift To raise a roof with act the fift. The epilogue behind did frame A place, not decent here to name. [...] Now, Poets from all quarters ran, To see the house of brother Van; Looked high and low, walk'd often round; But no such house was to be found. One asks the watermen hard by, [...] "Where may the Poet's palace lie?" [...] Another of the Thames inquires, If he has seen its gilded spires? At length they in the rubbish spy A thing resembling a goose-pie. Thither in haste the Poets throng, And gaze in silent wonder long, Till one in raptures thus began To praise the pile and builder Van: [...] "Thrice happy Poet! who may'st trail Thy house about thee like a snail: Or harness'd to a nag, at ease Take journeys in it like a chaise; Or in a boat whene'er thou wilt, Can'st make it serve thee for a tilt! Capacious house! 'tis own'd by all Thou'rt well contrived, tho' thou art small: For ev'ry Wit in Britain's isle May lodge within thy spacious pile. Like Bacchus thou, as Poets feign, Thy mother burnt, art born again, Born like a phoenix from the flame: But neither bulk nor shape the same; As animals of largest size Corrupt to maggots, worms, and flies; A type of modern wit and style, The rubbish of an ancient pile; So chemists boast they have a power, From the dead ashes of a flower Some faint resemblance to produce, But not the virtue, taste, or juice. So modern rhymers wisely blast The poetry of ages past; Which, after they have overthrown, They from its ruins build their own." ...|$|R
