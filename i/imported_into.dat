5|$|The Thoroughbred as it {{is known}} today was {{developed}} in 17th- and 18th-century England, when native mares were crossbred with imported Oriental stallions of Arabian, Barb, and Turkoman breeding. All modern Thoroughbreds can trace their pedigrees to three stallions originally <b>imported</b> <b>into</b> England in the 17th century and 18th century and to a larger number of foundation mares of mostly English breeding. During the 18th and 19th centuries, the Thoroughbred breed spread throughout the world; they were <b>imported</b> <b>into</b> North America starting in 1730 and into Australia, Europe, Japan and South America during the 19th century. Millions of Thoroughbreds exist today, and around 100,000foals are registered each year worldwide.|$|E

40|$|Treatment of {{isolated}} yeast mitochondria {{with high levels}} (1 mg/ml) of trypsin severely inhibits protein import but does not destroy {{the integrity of the}} outer membrane or abolish mitochondrial energy coupling. If the outer membrane of these trypsin-inactivated mitochondria is disrupted by osmotic shock, the resulting mitoplasts are again able to import proteins. Protein <b>import</b> <b>into</b> mitoplasts, like that into intact mitochondria, is energy-dependent; however, whereas <b>import</b> <b>into</b> mitochondria is inhibited by antibody against 45 -kd proteins of the outer membrane [Ohba and Schatz, EMBO J., 6, 2109 - 2115 (1987) ], <b>import</b> <b>into</b> mitoplasts not affected by this antibody.

5|$|Thomas C.

More recently however, {{a new study by}} Air Force historian Eduard Mark has attempted to rehabilitate the Air Force's original claims by finding a rough correlation between trucks <b>imported</b> <b>into</b> North Vietnam during the war and those that were claimed by the American pilots as destroyed. Only the opening of the Vietnamese archives to scholarly research will reveal the true effectiveness (or lack thereof) of the American electronic and aerial effort.|$|E

5|$|The Dorset is {{an ancient}} breed that was most likely {{developed}} from horned sheep that lived in the valleys and pastures of southwestern England. Dorset Horn sheep were <b>imported</b> <b>into</b> the United States in 1860, and the first U.S. national flock book was formed in 1891. Today, the Dorset is found in two varieties globally, Horned and Polled. In the Horn variety, both ewes and rams have horns, while the polled variety have no horns at all. Polled Dorsets are ideal for commercial settings {{because they do not}} have horns that can get caught in fencing or cause damage when they butt.|$|E

By 1801, the smaller variety of land spaniel was called the Cocker or Cocking Spaniel, so named for its use in flushing woodcock.|$|E
