Rush drummer Neil Peart has said: [...] "I think Selling England by the Pound is an {{enduring}} masterpiece of drumming. Beautiful drumming, lovely sound, and the arrangements, I {{think they really}} nailed {{the best of what}} that band as an entity could have <b>done</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> album." [...] Fish, solo artist and former lead singer of Marillion, has called it [...] "the definitive Genesis album", praised its [...] "emotive" [...] quality, said the wordplay was [...] "one of the things that became quite an influence on me - the games within the lyrics" [...] and concluded it [...] "took a whole jump forward and was the album that really got me into Genesis". Singer and songwriter Robert Pollard of Guided by Voices considers Selling England by the Pound one of his ten favourite records of all time. John Lennon said he really liked the album during a radio interview, which the band took great encouragement from.|$|E
500|$|Coghill told Australian Times {{that the}} final tour is [...] "going to be great fun, but it's {{also going to be}} sad". He {{confirmed}} that he had no plans to start a new band or for a solo project. Instead he intended to finish his degree, [...] "nce I'm <b>done</b> <b>with</b> <b>that,</b> I might put the feelers out and see what's happening. I don't think I'd be doing anything solo, but I might look to join other bands, just {{to have a chance to}} keep playing. I'm just not keen to be off touring the world anymore". Powderfinger played their final show at the River Stage in Brisbane on 13 November 2010 in front of 10,000 fans; the last song they performed was [...] "These Days". On 25 January 2011 the band issued a previously unreleased track, [...] "I'm on Your Side", as a fundraiser for the Premier's Flood Appeal as a result of major flooding in Queensland from December the previous year into January. The song was available via the band's website with all proceeds going towards the cause. On 8 November 2011, the group released a second compilation album, , containing two new tracks. There was also a 2-disc release, Fingerprints & Footprints – The Ultimate Collection, combining both Fingerprints and Footprints in one set. Also in November, Dino Scatena and the band, published a biography, Footprints: the inside story of Australia's best loved band. Scatena, a rock music journalist, had started writing the book in the previous October during the Sunsets Farewell Tour.|$|E
500|$|However, in January 2012, Heigl {{stated in}} an {{interview}} that she has asked the producers if she could return to the show to give closure to Izzie's storyline: [...] "I've told them I want to ," [...] she said. [...] "I really, really, really want to see where [...] is. I just {{want to know what happened}} to her and where she went and what she's doing now. My idea is that she actually like figures it out, and finds some success and does really well in a different hospital. She was always floundering you know, and so she was always one step behind the eight ball and I want to see that girl take some power back." [...] She later went on to say that she regrets leaving the show, [...] "Oh yeah, sometimes, yeah. You miss it. I miss my friends. It was a great work environment ... and it becomes a family. I spent six years together with these people every day ... you grow up together, in a way," [...] and again commented on Izzie possibly returning to the show, [...] "I always felt that if they wanted me to come back and sort of wrap up that storyline ... I want them to know that I'm down with it if they want me to, but I completely understand if it doesn't necessarily work ... They've got a lot of story lines going on there." [...] But in March 2012, Shonda Rhimes said that there are no plans at the moment for the character to return, [...] "I think it was really nice to hear her appreciating the show. At the same time we are on a track we have been planning. The idea of changing that track is not something we are interested in right now." [...] Three years later, Rhimes said she has completely moved on from the idea of Izzie coming back, “I’m <b>done</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> story. I’ve turned that idea over in my mind a thousand times and thought about how it would go. And I don’t think so.” ...|$|E

2500|$|In April 2009, Warner Bros. hired Todd Phillips, who {{directed}} The Hangover, {{to write a}} sequel with Scot Armstrong. The deal, reached {{two months before the}} release of The Hangover in June 2009, came as result of The Hangovers positive screen tests, and a trailer which drew a strong reaction from audiences at ShoWest. The writers from the first film, Scott Moore and Jon Lucas, decided not to come back to write the sequel because, according to Lucas, [...] "they were <b>done</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> story...and didn't want to just write Hangover sequels their whole careers".|$|E
2500|$|No, we're all <b>done</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> [...] now, {{all the old}} material.

We're moving on now, and getting on with the new record.|$|E
2500|$|Huxley's {{arguments}} with Owen {{continued in the}} Athenaeum so that each Saturday Darwin could read the latest ripostes. Owen tried to smear Huxley by portraying him as an [...] "advocate of man's origins from a transmuted ape", {{and one of his}} contributions was titled [...] "Ape-Origin of Man as Tested by the Brain". This backfired, as Huxley had already delighted Darwin by speculating on [...] "pithecoid man" [...] – ape-like man, and was glad of the invitation to publicly turn the anatomy of brain structure into a question of human ancestry. He was determined to indict Owen for perjury, promising [...] "before I have <b>done</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> mendacious humbug I will nail him out, like a kite to a barn door, an example to all evil doers." [...] Darwin egged him on from Down, writing [...] "Oh Lord what a thorn you must be in the poor dear man's side".|$|E

2500|$|To Thomas Henry Huxley {{the claim}} about the {{hippocampus}} minor {{appeared to be}} a significant blunder by Owen, and Huxley began systematically dissecting the brains of monkeys, determined that [...] "before I have <b>done</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> mendacious humbug I will nail him out, like a kite to a barn door, an example to all evil doers." [...] He did not discuss this in public at this stage, but continued to attack Owen's other ideas, aiming to undermine Owen's status. At his 17 June 1858 Royal Institution Croonian Lecture [...] "On the Theory of the Vertebrate Skull", Huxley directly challenged Owen's central idea of archetypes shown by homology, with Owen in the audience. Huxley's aim was to overcome the domination of science by wealthy clergymen led by Owen, {{in order to create a}} professional salaried scientific civil service and make science secular. Under Darwin's influence he took up transmutation as a way of dividing science from theology, and in January 1859 argued that [...] "it is as respectable to be modified monkey as modified dirt".|$|E
2500|$|By this time, Wright felt typecast as the Prairie house {{architect}} {{and sought to}} broaden his architectural vision. [...] Wright turned to the concrete block as his new building material. [...] Wright wrote in his autobiography that he chose to build with concrete blocks as they were [...] "the cheapest (and ugliest) thing in the building world," [...] {{and he wanted to}} see [...] "what could be <b>done</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> gutter-rat." [...] The textile-block houses were named for their richly textured brocade-like concrete walls. [...] The style was an experiment by Wright in modular housing; he sought to develop an inexpensive and simple method of construction that would enable ordinary people to build their own homes with stacked blocks. [...] By adding ornamental designs to mass-produced blocks, Wright hoped the blocks could become a [...] "masonry fabric capable of great variety in architectural beauty." [...] One writer has described Wright's concept this way: [...] "By unifying decoration and function, exterior and interior, earth and sky — perforated blocks served as skylights — Wright saw his Textile Block Method approach as an utterly modern, and democratic, expression of his organic architecture ideal." ...|$|E
