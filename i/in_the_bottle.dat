5|$|Originally {{a bottle}} {{conditioned}} beer, FES has been pasteurised to ensure quality consistency since 1948. Since 1950, {{in an attempt}} to recreate the flavour profile of bottle conditioned FES, the beer has been produced by blending fresh FES with 2 per cent FES that has been aged for up to 100 days, which has developed a high lactic acid content. Finally, the beer is allowed to mature <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> for 28 days before being sent out for distribution.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th and 20th centuries, a {{large part}} of Cabernet Sauvignon's {{reputation}} was built on its ability to age and develop <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottle.</b> In addition to softening some of their austere tannins, as Cabernet wines age new flavors and aromas can emerge and add to the wines' complexity. Historically this was a trait characterized by Bordeaux with some premium examples in favorable vintages having the potential to last for over a century, but producers across the globe have developed styles that could age and develop for several decades. Even with the ability to age, some Cabernet Sauvignon wines can still be approachable a few years after vintage. In Bordeaux, the tannins of the wines tend to soften after ten years and can typically last for at least another decade-sometimes longer depending on the producer and vintage. Some Spanish and Italian Cabernet Sauvignons will need similar time as Bordeaux to develop but most examples are typically made to be drunk earlier.|$|E

A total of 20, 155 blood cultures, consisting of a vented Roche tryptic soy broth (R-TSB) bottle and an unvented Difco thiol broth bottle, was processed; 2, 509 organisms were recovered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> R-TSB <b>bottles,</b> and 1, 865 organisms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> thiol <b>bottles.</b> Only 32 organisms isolated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> R-TSB <b>bottles</b> and 10 organisms isolated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> thiol <b>bottles</b> were detected after incubation for more than 7 days; 15 of <b>the</b> 32 isolates <b>in</b> <b>the</b> R-TSB <b>bottles</b> and all 10 of <b>the</b> isolates <b>in</b> <b>the</b> thiol <b>bottles</b> were either recovered in other blood cultures or were {{not considered to be}} clinically significant.

5|$|The crémant {{produced}} in the Languedoc is made according to the Méthode Traditionnelle - formerly known as méthode champenoise, the same method used to produce the Champagne, including a second fermentation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> to encapture the carbon dioxide produced by the yeast - in the small villages around the town of Limoux. The wines are normally composed of 70% Mauzac and a 30% combination of Chardonnay and Chenin blanc. AOC regulations require a year of aging on the lees. The Blanquette de Limoux, when labelled méthode ancestrale, is composed entirely of Mauzac, undergoes only one fermentation and is aged approximately three months less on the lees before the bottling, the actual date being determined by the moon's cycle.|$|E
5|$|While New World Cabernets are {{characterized}} as being drinkable earlier than Bordeaux, premium producers {{such as the}} Californian cult wines will produce wines that need time to age and could potentially develop {{for two to three}} decades. Overall, the majority of Californian Cabernets are meant to be approachable after only a couple of years <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> but can still have the potential to improve further over time. Similarly many premium Australian Cabernet will also need at least ten years to develop though many are approachable after two to five years. New Zealand wines are typically meant to be consumed young and will often maintain their green herbal flavors even with extended bottle aging. South American Cabernets have very pronounced fruit flavors when they are young and the best made examples will maintain some of those flavors as they age. South African wines tend to favor more Old World styles and typically require six to eight years' aging before they start to develop further flavors.|$|E
5|$|Cabernet Sauvignon {{is grown}} {{in nearly every}} South American country {{including}} Chile, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Peru and Uruguay. In Chile, the wines were historically limited by the excessively high yields that were commonplace throughout the country. As producers begun to concentrate on limiting yields, regional differences began to emerge that distinguished Chilean Cabernets. For vineyard plantings along flat river valleys, the climate of the region {{is the most important}} consideration; as plantings move to higher elevations and along hillsides, soil type is a greater concern. The wines of the Aconcagua region are noted for their ripe fruit but closed, tight structure that needs some time <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottle</b> to develop. In the Maipo Valley, Cabernet Sauvignon wines are characterized by their pervasive blackcurrant fruit and an earthy, dusty note. In warmer regions, such as the Colchagua Province and around Curicó, the grapes ripen more fully; they produce wines with rich fruit flavors that can be perceived as sweet due to the ripeness of the fruit. The acidity levels of these wines will be lower and the tannins will also be softer, making the wines more approachable at a younger age.|$|E

It is considered that the optimum incubation period, i. e., treatment timing for fruiting, is when the CO 2 concentration sinks to the bottom after rising to the top. This conclusion is almost same as other edible mushroom cultivations. The optimal temperature and moisture concentration were 14 - 16 °C and over 95 % RDH for fruit body yields and the proper traits of fruit bodies. It is considered that the optimal moisture concentration for P. adiposa fruit body yield is higher than other edible mushrooms. 食用きのこヌメリスギタケのスギ鋸屑を基本にした培地 での人工栽培において, 栽培条件を検討した｡栽培瓶に詰 める培地の量と培養期間が収量に与える影響を検討したところ, 800 mlナメコ瓶における｢福岡Ｋ－Ｎ｣の栽培では, 460 ～ 500 g詰め重でいずれも８週間培養が最も高い収量が得られた｡そして, これらの場合において第１回発生の収量が全収量に大きく影響していた｡詰め重別では, 480 g,および 500 gが収量が高かった｡ 480 g詰めでは, 培養期間が８週より長くても短くても 500 g詰めに比べ顕著に収量が低くなった｡他の品種では同じではなく, 500 g詰めにおける最適培養期間は長期を要した｡最適培養期間の指標とするために, 培養中の菌糸体の炭酸ガス排出量を測定した｡最適培養期間, すなわち子実体発生処理の時期は, 炭酸ガス排出濃度が最高となった後減少して落ち込んだ時点であることが示唆された｡このことは, 他の食用きのこ類とほぼ同様であった｡子実体発生処理の温度湿度条件ついて検討した｡収穫量が高く形質のバランスを考慮すると, 温度は 14 ～ 16 ℃で,湿度は 95 ％以上が適性であり, 適正な子実体形成には他の食用きのこと比較してやや高湿度を要すると考えられた...|$|R
