40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to develop practical care procedures to help maintain the protective quality of flame resistant workwear laundered by workers in the field. Based on observed field conditions, experiments were conducted that simulated domestic laundry procedures. The first experiment involved two flame resistant (FR) fabrics, contaminated or not contaminated with oil. Independent variables also included detergent type and laundry pre-treatment. Other laundry parameters were controlled. Results indicated that it is easier to maintain the FR performance of the FR-treated blend than it is for the aramid fabric. It is hypothesized that energy generated by initial ignition of oil on the specimens triggers the FR mechanism of the treatment, which in turn inhibits further combustion.

40|$|The {{washing machine}} {{is widely used}} in the present day’s society for washing and drying of clothes. The Fisher & Paykel EcoSmart GWL 10 washing machine has been awarded “The America’s Most Energy Efficient Washer ” for this year by The Consortium of Energy Efficiency, which rates washers in the market {{depending}} on their energy and water consumption and the remaining moisture content. Most of the raw materials used in the manufacturing process of the washing machine have considerable negative social and environmental impacts which include mass scale extraction of metals, releases of toxic gases during production and processing, contamination of land and health hazards caused in humans and animals. Therefore it is important to mitigate these effects while achieving the social requirements. It is believed that providing a service to replace the <b>domestic</b> <b>washing</b> <b>machine</b> would be a feasible solution for this dilemma. A service can be introduced where all the dirty laundry will be collected on a weekly basis, washed, dried, ironed and then returned to the users after a certain number of days. It is suggested that these services be well organised and functioned as a service to the community than a business to individual service providing companies. Therefore a fixed charge for a fixed volume or number of clothes is strongly recommended. Thusitha Mabotuwana Table of content...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: There is {{significant}} public concern in England about health carers wearing uniform {{in public places}} and that contaminated uniforms {{may contribute to the}} spread of healthcare-associated infections (HCAI). Evidence of a link between contaminated uniforms and HCAI, or that wearing uniforms in public spaces may contribute to the spread of infection from the healthcare environment to the wider community, has not previously been systematically assessed. METHODS: A comprehensive review was conducted that focused on patient perceptions of the significance and infection risks of uniforms and microbiological and clinical evidence of the infection risks to patients from contaminated uniforms. RESULTS: Uniforms {{play an important role in}} the public's perception of healthcare professionals. This is constructed from social and cultural images leading patients to judge the professionalism and trustworthiness of practitioners based on the clothes they wear. The colour and design of uniforms may reinforce socially constructed concepts of cleanliness that result in unachievable expectations. Evidence directly related to the laundering of uniforms is limited. Small scale studies show that uniforms and white coats become progressively contaminated during clinical care and most microbial contamination originates from the wearer of the uniform. Although some studies theorise that uniforms may transmit HCAI, no studies demonstrated this in practice. A small number of studies evaluated the phases of the wash cycle in hospital laundries for patient linen but not uniforms. They indicate that micro-organisms are removed and killed during laundering, and dilution during washing and rinsing is important. Significant reductions in micro-organisms occur at lower temperatures more commonly used in home laundering. A small number of studies show that home laundering provides effective decontamination. We found no recent studies that accounted for advances in <b>domestic</b> <b>washing</b> <b>machine</b> and detergent technology or that addressed the theoretical infection risk linked with wearing uniforms in public places. CONCLUSION: Despite the limited amount and quality of the evidence, the general public's perception is that uniforms pose an infection risk when worn inside and outside clinical settings. This is reinforced by media comment and a lack of clear, accessible information and may have a damaging effect on the relationship between professionals and patients and the public image of healthcare workers. There is no good evidence to suggest uniforms are a significant risk, that home laundering is inferior to commercial processing of uniforms or that it presents a hazard in terms of cross-contamination of other items in the wash-load with hospital pathogens. It is essential that the evidence is considered in a balanced way and not over-emphasised in the development of uniform policy and that the general principles of infection control are stressed...|$|E
5000|$|The origins [...] of the Girbau company {{go back to}} the mid-1920s with a small {{electromechanical}} workshop {{devoted to}} manufacturing and repairing all kinds of appliances, including <b>domestic</b> <b>washing</b> <b>machines.</b> In the nineteen sixties, {{at the height of the}} tourist boom in Spain, the company gradually shifted its production to the manufacture of industrial machinery for laundries, providing equipment for the hotel and restaurant sector along with an after-sales service.|$|R

Overall, > 1900 fibres were given off from the evaluated PES fleece during a single wash. Synthetic textile fibres are also released to air and dust, either during normal use [57] or during tumble drying [77]. In addition, synthetic fibres are released from hygiene products, e.g. if improperly disposed into wastewater [31].|$|R
50|$|Historically, small {{processes}} or microprocesses per se {{have always}} existed. For example, small vineyards and breweries have produced feedstock, processed it, and stored product {{in what could}} be considered “microprocess” when compared to processes designed based on the petrochemical industry model or, for example, large-scale production of beer. Small villages in India and other places in the world have learned to produce biogas from animal manure {{in what could be}} considered small-scale microprocesses for the production of energy. However, microprocesses and process miniaturization as a design philosophy includes the notion of approaching total automation, and is a new technology which has been enabled by computer hardware miniaturization, for example, the microprocessor. It is easy to envision processes which can be mass-produced and transported. For example, many appliances such as air conditioners, <b>domestic</b> <b>washing</b> <b>machines,</b> and refrigerators could be considered microprocesses.|$|R
40|$|Clothes {{will often}} {{automatically}} be washed {{without too much}} consideration because it involves little effort and because the environmental effects of that washing process remain unseen and consequently unconsidered. This essay will examine what sustainability means {{in the context of}} the use of <b>domestic</b> <b>washing</b> <b>machines.</b> Initially the term 'washing machine' will be defined. These are household appliances commonly used in developed countries such as Australia which require inputs of electricity, water and detergent in order to wash clothes and linen. There are a myriad of brands and model variations available, with the main category choice being between front loading and top loading machines. Front loaders use between 50 % and 143 % less energy than top loading machines. The use of these machines generates a significant proportion of domestic water and electricity demands, while the use of detergents releases potential pollutants into the environment via the grey water that is produced. In meeting our present requirements for clean clothes and linen by using <b>washing</b> <b>machines</b> are we depleting resources and creating pollution that may affect future generations in a negative way...|$|R

25|$|An {{advantage}} of the universal motor is that AC supplies may be used on motors that have some characteristics more common in DC motors, specifically high starting torque and very compact design if high running speeds are used. The negative aspect is the maintenance and short life problems caused by the commutator. Such motors are used in devices, such as food mixers and power tools, that are used only intermittently, and often have high starting-torque demands. Multiple taps on the field coil provide (imprecise) stepped speed control. Household blenders that advertise many speeds frequently combine a field coil with several taps and a diode that can be inserted in series with the motor (causing the motor to run on half-wave rectified AC). Universal motors also lend themselves to electronic speed control and, as such, are an ideal choice for devices like <b>domestic</b> <b>washing</b> <b>machines.</b> The motor {{can be used to}} agitate the drum (both forwards and in reverse) by switching the field winding with respect to the armature.|$|R

40|$|Washing laundry {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{widespread}} housework tasks in the world. <b>Washing</b> <b>machines,</b> performing this task already in many private households, are now responsible for about 2 % of the global electricity consumption. Worldwide, more than 840 million <b>domestic</b> <b>washing</b> <b>machines</b> are in use, with an annual consumption exceeding 92 TWh of electricity and 19 billion m 3 of water as well as causing emissions of more than 62 megatons CO 2 eq. In North America, Western Europe and Pacific OECD countries, most households own a <b>washing</b> <b>machine.</b> In these economies standard and label policy programs already addressed and reduced the specific electricity and water consumption of <b>washing</b> <b>machines</b> per <b>wash</b> cycle. Nevertheless, in other world regions, the level of ownership for <b>washing</b> <b>machines</b> is still well below saturation and high growth rates can be observed in developing and newly industrialising countries. As <b>washing</b> <b>machines</b> use water, electricity, chemical substances and process time as resources, also the absolute worldwide resource consumption and emissions of these appliances are still on the rise. Due to different washing habits and practices as well as types of <b>washing</b> <b>machines</b> in different world regions, the specific consumption of resources for doing the laundry is varying to a large extent. On that score, this paper presents an overview of the current situation worldwide as well as respective saving potentials. Bottom-up scenario calculations, carried out for the 11 world regions according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change classification, show that large energy, water and greenhouse gas savings are possible with the "Best Available Technologies" today, and even higher savings will be possible with next generation "Best Not yet Available Technologies". According to model results, these savings are usually also very cost-effective. Following these calculations, it is highly advisable for policymakers world-wide to pay even more attention to improvement options in order to implement ambitious and product-specific policy packages, including minimum performance standards and labelling schemes...|$|R

40|$|Frequency {{excursions}} on {{electrical power}} systems are traditionally controlled using governors on central, often steam driven, generators. However, if {{the proportion of}} steam driven plant is reduced, {{there is a need}} to provide frequency response by other means. Distributed frequency response is under-utilised; this is partly because it is difficult for system operators to schedule demand side frequency response capability and verify its operation. Smart meters provide a means to overcome these difficulties, if the meters have an adequate hardware specification. A scheme to enable System Operators to specify demand side frequency response, become aware of its availability and verify its operation is put forward. A model is developed in which demand side frequency response operation is verified using `Frequency Response Verification Packets' (FRVPs) - data packets created by smart meters that quantify changes in demand following a detected frequency excursion. The model is used to simulate a situation where 20 % of all <b>domestic</b> <b>washing</b> <b>machines</b> in Britain can pause for 30 minutes following a frequency excursion. For a frequency deviation at 1830 hrs on a weekday in the month of March, 291778 FRVPs were created (corresponding to 135 MW total demand reduction within 2 seconds of the frequency excursion) ...|$|R
50|$|Changes to labour laws {{during the}} early 20th century meant that Chinese sailors found it {{increasingly}} difficult to find employment on ships. They turned instead to running restaurants and laundries. The rector at St Anne's, Limehouse, estimated that at its peak after the First World War the local Chinese community never numbered more than 300 people. At that time, the community was still based around Limehouse Causeway and Pennyfields. The area was marked with lodgings for seamen and restaurants. These streets were heavily bombed during The Blitz. During World War II, around 10,000 Chinese men enrolled in the Merchant Navy while others defended Hong Kong and undermined Japanese forces in the Far East. London's docklands were badly damaged by bombing, and the remains demolished by the council. Now, only their names remain to evoke the past community. There are names such as Canton Street, Mandarin Street, Pekin Street, Ming Street and Nankin Street. Today, mostly elderly Chinese people live in the Limehouse area. Despite the decline of the London shipping industry, the Chinese population grew steadily after the Second World War. After the war, the Chinese began to move into Soho and bought up cheap property. Entire families were also entering the laundry trade. Chinese hand laundries were made obsolete in the 1950s by the introduction of laundrettes and eventually much later the widespread use of <b>domestic</b> <b>washing</b> <b>machines.</b>|$|R

40|$|Clothes laundry {{is one of}} {{the hidden}} {{practices}} of fashion - while wearing clean looking and fresh smelling clothes is fundamental for most people, our laundry practices are concealed within the monotony of everyday life. And loaded with cultural and social meanings. Yet laundry practices are simultaneously problematic since the collective use of <b>domestic</b> <b>washing</b> <b>machines</b> and dryers consume massive quantities of environmentally significant resources such as energy and water. The environmental impacts of laundering are inadvertent and somewhat ironic: laundry can be understood as a practice of both purity and pollution. Efforts to reduce impacts from laundry have been mainly focused on technological efficiency and individual changes in behaviour. These initiatives appeal to a logic of direct reductions in resource use, but they fall short in responding to the meanings and values that are reproduced and enacted through doing the laundry and the social construction of practices. As such, despite continuously improving product and appliance efficiency, the net consumption of energy incurred through doing the laundry has in fact doubled since 1970 (Goodright and Wilkes, 2015). Looking beyond the mundanities of doing the laundry, this exhibition explores some of the cultural and social meanings that laundry practices help to reconstruct and reinforce. It brings together a range of work from a small group of fashion activists, theorists and researchers from London College of Fashion and the University of Huddersfield who have explored laundry from a range of different perspectives. It includes a mix of photos, garments, illustrations and a pop up garment grooming station – giving an up close and personal glimpse into the secret world of laundry...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Despite {{the massive}} demand {{of water for}} plant irrigation, there are few devices {{being used in the}} {{automation}} of this process in agriculture. This work evaluates a simple controller to water plants automatically that can be set up with low cost commercial materials, which are large-scale produced. This controller is composed by a ceramic capsule used in common domestic water filters; a plastic tube around 1. 5 m long, and a pressostate used in <b>domestic</b> <b>washing</b> <b>machines.</b> The capsule and the pressostate are connected through the tube so that all parts are filled with water. The ceramic capsule is the sensor of the controller and has to be placed into the plant substrate. The pressostate has to be placed below the sensor and the lower it is, the higher is the water tension to start the irrigation, since the lower is the pressostate the higher is the water column above it and, therefore, the higher is the tension inside the ceramic cup to pull up the water column. The controller was evaluated in the control of drip irrigation for small containers filled with commercial organic substrate or soil. Linear regressions explained the relationship between the position of pressostate and the maximum water tension in the commercial substrate (p < 0. 0054) and soil (p < 0. 0001). Among the positions of the pressostate from 0. 30 to 0. 90 m below the sensor, the water tension changed from 1 to 8 kPa for commercial substrate and 4 to 13 kPa for the soil. This simple controller can be useful to grow plants, applying water automatically in function of the water tension of the plant substrate...|$|R
5000|$|Bendix Home Appliances, a {{subsidiary}} of Avco, an otherwise unrelated company, who licensed the name from Bendix Corporation, introduced the first <b>domestic</b> automatic <b>washing</b> <b>machine</b> in 1937, having applied for a patent in the same year. In appearance and mechanical detail, this first machine was not unlike the front loading automatic washers produced today. Although it included many of the today's basic features, the machine lacked any drum suspension and therefore had to be anchored to the floor to prevent [...] "walking". Because of the components required, the machine was also very expensive. For instance, the Bendix Home Laundry Service Manual (published November 1, 1946) shows that the drum speed change was facilitated by a 2-speed gearbox built to a heavy duty standard (not unlike a car automatic gearbox, albeit at a smaller size). The timer was also probably fairly costly, because miniature electric motors were expensive to produce.|$|R
