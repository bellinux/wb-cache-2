5|$|By 1912, Sadler and his wife, both doctors by then, {{operated}} a <b>joint</b> <b>practice</b> in Chicago that catered to children's and women's health issues. Sadler initially focused on surgery, performing surgeries with his wife, but widened his practice to include psychiatric counseling in 1930 {{and became a}} consulting psychiatrist at Columbus Hospital. As a psychiatrist, Sadler advocated {{an eclectic mix of}} techniques, applying the theories of Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, Alfred Adler, and Adolf Meyer. Sadler believed that religious faith was beneficial to mental health, and specifically promoted prayer, which he believed to be most effective in the context of Christian faith. However, he thought that religious beliefs were deleterious to mental health if based on fear.|$|E

2500|$|In 1898, Reilly {{became an}} Associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA). In 1900 {{he applied for}} the chair of {{architecture}} at King's College, London; he had not seriously expected to be successful and was surprised and pleased to reach the final shortlist of three. The successful candidate, Ravenscroft Elsey Smith, appointed him to a part-time lectureship and introduced him to Stanley Peach, who specialised in designing power stations. Peach and Reilly entered into a <b>joint</b> <b>practice.</b> According to Reilly, Peach was [...] "a good constructor, but diffident about his own powers of design. The result was that he tried far too hard to dress up his engineering buildings, with their fine roofs and great chimneys, with 'architecture' when {{they would have been}} much better left alone." [...] Reilly, on the other hand, was more interested in design than in the mechanics of construction.|$|E

2500|$|Holker Hall (pronounced Hooker) is a privately-owned {{country house}} located about 2km to the {{southwest}} of the village of Cartmel, Cumbria, England, a location previously in the historic county of Lancashire. It is [...] "the grandest [...] of its date in Lancashire...by the best architects then living in the county." [...] The building dates from the 16thcentury, with alterations, additions, and rebuilding in the 18th and 19th centuries. The 19th century rebuilding was by George Webster in Jacobean Revival style and subsequent renovations were by E.G.Paley. Hubert Austin had a <b>joint</b> <b>practice</b> with Paley by the 1870s and they both rebuilt the west wing after it was destroyed by a major fire in 1871, only a decade after Paley's previous work on the structure. The fire also destroyed a number of notable artworks. Holker Hall is Paley and Austin's [...] "most important country house commission." [...] The architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner expressed the opinion that the west wing is the [...] "outstanding domestic work" [...] of Paley and Austin. In 1970 the hall itself, together with its terrace wall, were designated GradeII* Listed buildings. The house stands in an estate of about 80hectares, and is surrounded by formal gardens, parkland and woodland. Within the grounds are six structures listed at GradeII.|$|E

40|$|As {{supply chain}} risks {{refer to the}} risks {{transmitted}} among supply chain members and supply chain management (SCM) is concerned with close collaboration among chain members to enhance the chains overall performance, we argue {{that we need to}} use an SCM perspective in supply chain risk management (SCRM). We identify risk information sharing and risk sharing mechanism as two important <b>joint</b> SCRM <b>practices.</b> Drawing on the literature on agency theory and collaborative relationships, we argue that the effectiveness of these two <b>joint</b> <b>practices</b> in improving financial performance can be strengthened by collaborative relationship characteristics including relationship length, supplier trust, and shared SCRM understanding. We empirically test our conceptual model using the data collected from 350 manufacturing firms in China. The results suggest that both risk information sharing and risk sharing mechanism improve financial performance, and the effectiveness of the former is strengthened by relationship length and supplier trust, while that of the latter is strengthened by shared SCRM understanding. We contribute to research and practice by identifying two useful <b>joint</b> SCRM <b>practices</b> and ascertaining the conditions under which each of the practices is particularly effectively.

50|$|Collaborative Planning, Forecasting and Replenishment (CPFR), a {{trademark}} of GS1 US, {{is a concept}} that aims to enhance supply chain integration by supporting and assisting <b>joint</b> <b>practices.</b> CPFR seeks cooperative management of inventory through joint visibility and replenishment of products throughout the supply chain. Information shared between suppliers and retailers aids in planning and satisfying customer demands through a supportive system of shared information. This allows for continuous updating of inventory and upcoming requirements, making the end-to-end supply chain process more efficient. Efficiency is created through the decrease expenditures for merchandising, inventory, logistics, and transportation across all trading partners.|$|R

30|$|The {{findings}} indicated that substantial parts {{of the study area}} have been converted from cereal crop production system to agroforestry land use which enables the community to diversify their income. The farm household participated in agroforestry production not only just from its expected comparative economic return but also from the synergy effects it has with the non-farm income generating activities. Therefore, policy interventions that simultaneously motivate agroforestry and non-farm income diversification activities could enhance the sustainability of land management and maximise the farm households’ economic return from these <b>joint</b> <b>practices.</b> Accessing farm technologies like fertiliser and improved seed, and institutions such as rural markets and infrastructures for farm households will be helpful to economically empower them in a sustainable way.|$|R

40|$|This article {{studies the}} {{relation}} between two specialised practices in meteorology, modelling and field measurements.

The relationship between theory, model and observation has been of concern for many philosophers of science whereas the relationship between the working practices that underlie theories, mod-els and observations, has received less attention. This paper describes and compares the practices that generate observation data and model output and the way differ-ent roles that fieldworkers and modellers have in this process are established. Next, different practice-oriented perspectives on the status of models, data and experi-ments are analysed and the discussion then moves on to the different trouble-shoot-ing strategies scientists deploy, depending on their position within the discipline. It is shown that these strategies are often based on the ideas and judgements that modellers and experimentalists express about each other, and by implication, about their own role in the meteorological enterprise...|$|R
