Alice chose Stokes to run for a relatively unimportant seat on the community college board. Though Stokes received 45,000votes, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>quiet,</b> unassuming, and did not win. Foster, however, shot to national prominence by being the first openly gay man to address a political convention. His speech at the 1972 Democratic National Convention ensured that his voice, according to San Francisco politicians, was the one to be heard when they wanted the opinions, and especially the votes, of the gay community.|$|E

[...] Later, however, he cited the French Revolution as his religious [...] "awakening". Hudson was repelled by the uprising's violence and disregard for life; in 1798 he proclaimed himself a [...] "political Christian", {{and later a}} [...] "speculative Christian". From then on, Hudson felt it his duty to lead a religious life. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>quiet</b> about his beliefs, however: [...] "My pride would not permit me to unburthen my soul to any living person.

500|$|Sanz≈ç Nosaka {{was the son}} of {{a prosperous}} Japanese {{merchant}} and was raised in a bourgeois environment. As a young man Nosaka was known for his fashionable taste in clothing and for the large dog that often accompanied him in public. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>quiet,</b> serious, studious, introverted, and more comfortable in libraries than at public demonstrations. After his secondary education, Nosaka attended Keio University, which was then considered a [...] "rich boys school".

Nosaka decided to write his senior thesis on the moderate labor organization founded by Bunji Suzuki, [...] "Yuaikai" [...] ("The Friendly Society"). To research his thesis, Nosaka contacted Yuaikais head office, and acquainted himself with its senior leaders: Suzuki initially mistook Nosaka for a salesman the first time they met, but eventually grew fond of Nosaka. When Nosaka graduated from Keio, in 1915, he joined Yuaikai and worked for the organization as a research staff member and as an editor of the organization's journal, Rodo Oyobi Sangyo (Labour and Industry).|$|E

The immediate result of this was that, not being sure how to live a saintly life, and worried about it, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>quiet</b> and worried for the next few days. Noticing this, John Bosco spoke to Dominic and advised him to resume his customary cheerfulness, persevere in his regular life of study and religious practices, and especially not neglect being with his companions in games and recreation.

2500|$|Biographer Cath Carroll {{describes}} the young Fleetwood as [...] "a dreamer, an empathetic youth" [...] who, though intelligent, did not excel academically. According {{to his own}} autobiography, Fleetwood had an extremely difficult and trying time academically at the English boarding schools he attended, including the Kings School in Gloucester. He performed poorly on exams, which he attributes to his persistent inability to commit facts to memory. He nevertheless enjoyed acting during school, often in drag, and was a competent fencer. At 6'6", he was an imposing figure, and sported a beard and long hair {{for much of his}} life. [...] "Mick was very aristocratic," [...] recalls Ken Caillat, a sound engineer on Rumours.
