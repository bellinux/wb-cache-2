40|$|Today {{multinational}} firms face grave uncertainties {{with respect}} to their investment strategies in other countries. This paper stresses the importance of integrating the descriptive aspects of this problem with prescriptive recommendations. It does so by raising two broad interrelated questions: (1) How do multinational firms and insurers deal with the problems of international risk in making their decisions on what investments to undertake? (2) What role can analytic approaches, including insurance mechanisms, play in better managing risk and uncertainty in international transactions? These questions are addressed by developing a conceptual framework which emphasizes the importance of problem formulation, institutional arrangements and decision processes as a basis for prescriptive recommendations. The problem is characterized by lack of a detailed statistical data base to estimate probabilities and consequences of different types of political, economic, and social risks. Corporate planners and risk managers who have responsibility for these investment decisions are anxious to avoid uncertainty. Hence, their actions appear to be greatly influenced by past experience and personal contacts. Our prescriptive recommendations are designed to widen the statistical data base by the use of experts and Bayesian analysis as well as to broaden the responsibility for investment decisions within the organization. We also propose a jointly operated private-federal insurance program which maintains features of current <b>government</b> <b>operated</b> <b>systems</b> but has private firms marketing policies and settling claims. The above theoretical concepts are illustrated with a case study of Indonesia's investment evaluation problem pursuant to their decision to provide the United States with liquefied natural gas in the early 1970 's. This case study illustrates the political risks of firms investing even in highly developed economies such as the United States...|$|R

Thus the existence, functions, powers and structures of local authorities depend entirely on the whim of state and territory governments.

In an exploratory effort to remedy this neglect, this paper draws on the international literature on the oversight role of state government agencies to develop a tentative quadrilateral typology of local government oversight models potentially applicable to Australian local government.

40|$|Carbon {{capture and}} storage (CCS) {{could become an}} {{instrumental}} part of a future carbon trading system in the US. If the US starts operating an emissions trading scheme (ETS) {{similar to that of}} the European Union's then limits on CO{sub 2 } emissions will be conservative in the beginning stages. The government will most likely start by distributing most credits for free; these free credits are called allowances. The US may follow the model of the EU ETS, which during the first five-year phase distributed 95 % of the credits for free, bringing that level down to 90 % for the second five-year phase. As the number of free allowances declines, companies will be forced to purchase an increasing number of credits at government auction, or else obtain them from companies selling surplus credits. In addition to reducing the number of credits allocated for free, with each subsequent trading period the number of overall credits released into the market will decline in an effort to gradually reduce overall emissions. Companies may face financial difficulty as the value of credits continues to rise due to the reduction of the number of credits available in the market each trading period. <b>Governments</b> <b>operating</b> emissions trading <b>systems</b> face the challenge of achieving CO{sub 2 } emissions targets without placing such a financial burden on their companies that the country's economy is markedly affected...|$|R
