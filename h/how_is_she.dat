6000|$|... "But, my aunt," [...] said Martin, anxiously; [...] "you {{have said}} nothing about Aunt Dorothy. <b>How</b> <b>is</b> <b>she?</b> where is she? is she well?" ...|$|E
60|$|And sister Mat, <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>she</b> getting along--I believe I {{will have}} {{to write a letter}} {{especially}} to her and Sis one of these times.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am {{very glad}} you are come; I came to inquire at the door, {{and they told}} me that you were here. <b>How</b> <b>is</b> <b>she,</b> poor thing?' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>How</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> to {{give him}} the purse? It was burning a hole in her pocket till she could do so; and yet <b>how</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> {{to get it out of}} her {{possession}} into his, and make her little speech, here in the public garden? She could have done it easily enough at home in the drawing-room at Surbiton Cottage.|$|R
60|$|But <b>how</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> to do this? An {{establishment}} in the Stumfold direction might be easier.|$|R
60|$|<b>How</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> {{to forbid}} {{him to come}} before Susan and Jane! <b>She</b> could only <b>be</b> silent.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not at all. She's a {{nice little}} girl enough, and he'll have nothing to trouble him. But <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>she,</b> poor thing, to talk to royal blood?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I fail {{to follow}} your Majesty. If this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>she</b> to prove their authenticity?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To {{think that}} I have found you at last, child. How puzzled you look. Did your mother never speak of me? <b>How</b> <b>is</b> <b>she?</b> Where is she?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{like your}} doughty policeman, Riach," [...] he said. [...] "Hie, obliging friend, let us hear how this gypsy struck you. <b>How</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> dressed?" ...|$|R
60|$|But <b>how</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> to get {{herself out}} of the room? It would not do for such a Juliet to stay all the night looking into the eyes of her ancient Romeo. And <b>how</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> to behave herself to Lady Ball, when she should again find herself in the drawing-room, {{conscious}} as <b>she</b> <b>was</b> that Lady Ball knew all about it? And <b>how</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> to conduct herself before all those young people whom she had left there? And her proposed father-in-law, whom she feared so much, and in truth disliked so greatly--would he know all about it, and thrust his ill-natured jokes at her? Her lover should have opened the door for her to pass through; but instead of doing so, as soon as she had withdrawn her hand from his, he placed himself on the rug, and leaned back in silence against the chimney-piece.|$|R
6000|$|When he was gone, it was {{possible}} to come to the examination upon Janet for which Mother Carey had <b>been</b> so anxious. <b>How</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> looking? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hush, Duke, {{you know}} you have no right to speak to me like this. Let us think of poor Constance. <b>How</b> <b>is</b> <b>she</b> to be told the truth?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Heaven above! Why {{did you not}} deep those cursed sugar-tongs out of [...] her sight? <b>How</b> <b>is</b> <b>she</b> {{going to}} get through it if you frighten her [...] like this? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You said a {{woman should}} fly frae the like o' Grizel's father though it should be {{to the other end}} of the world, but <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>she</b> to ken that he's that kind?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{can feel}} quite safe on that point," [...] he assured me. [...] "I was her counsel--that is, {{if it is}} the same woman. <b>How</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> dressed?" ...|$|R
60|$|But yet, {{now that}} the moment <b>was</b> coming, <b>how</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> to talk to him? <b>How</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> to speak the words which would rob him of his hope, {{and tell him that}} he did not, could not, never could possess that one {{treasure}} which he desired more than houses and lands, or station and rank? Alas, alas! If it could have been otherwise! If it could have <b>been</b> otherwise! <b>She</b> also <b>was</b> in love with poverty;--but at any rate, no one could accuse her now of sacrificing a poor lover for a rich one. Herbert Fitzgerald would be poor enough.|$|R
6000|$|Gyp, who {{was sitting}} at her bureau, seemed to be adding up the counterfoils in her cheque-book. She did not turn round, and Fiorsen paused. <b>How</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> going to receive him? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It seems 's if {{it helped}} her, an' so--I guess I'll stay. She may call for me, an' if she does," [...] he said resolutely, [...] "I'm goin' in, doctor. <b>How</b> <b>is</b> <b>she</b> now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite so," [...] I said, yawning, [...] "but perhaps, Zikali, {{you will}} come to the point of the spear. What of her? <b>How</b> <b>is</b> <b>she</b> named, and if she exists will she help me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How is your niece, Miss Bates?--I want {{to inquire}} after you all, but {{particularly}} your niece. How is Miss Fairfax?--I hope she caught no cold last night. <b>How</b> <b>is</b> <b>she</b> to-day? Tell me how Miss Fairfax is." ...|$|E
6000|$|She looked {{surprised}} at my agitation, but she little guessed its cause. <b>How</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> {{to know anything}} of that little packet {{which seemed to be}} burning a hole in my heart? ...|$|R
60|$|<b>How</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> to {{tell him}} that it was to the tone of the note she objected--to the hint of a clandestine meeting? She turned the light of her eyes full upon him.|$|R
6000|$|In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western {{would have}} been a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her, {{certainly}} clownish--in short, the working classes. <b>How</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> to adjust herself? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>she</b> {{getting on}} without a baily?" [...] the {{maltster}} inquired. Henery shook his head, and smiled {{one of the}} bitter smiles, dragging all the flesh of his forehead into a corrugated heap in the centre.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>she?</b> Why did she {{not come}} with you?" [...] sobbed Edith; while Dick Prince, seating {{himself on a}} rock, drew her on his knee and stroked her fair head as she wept upon his shoulder.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am at {{the marble}} works all day---in the mosaic department. Oh, Miss Gillian, I owe it all to Miss Merrifield's {{encouraging}} {{me to go to}} the School of Art. <b>How</b> <b>is</b> <b>she?</b> And I hope you have good accounts of Sir Jasper?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was wondering," [...] cried Mary Phillips, [...] "what {{had become}} of you; I thought perhaps you had gone down to breakfast." [...] In answer I called to her to tell me where Miss Nugent <b>was,</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>was,</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> came to <b>be</b> in this {{surprising}} situation, {{and how many people}} there were on board the steamer.|$|R
5000|$|A {{character}} in Anthony Trollope's Barchester Towers mentions Imogen: [...] "Imogen <b>was</b> true, but <b>how</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> rewarded? Her lord believed {{her to be}} the paramour of the first he who came near her in his absence." ...|$|R
6000|$|Having {{reached this}} conclusion, <b>how</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> to shape her future course? What new means could she {{discover}} which would lead her secretly to her end, {{in defiance of}} Mrs. Lecount's malicious vigilance and Noel Vanstone's miserly distrust? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What? Who's {{been putting}} that into your head? Your grumpy granny, I suppose. However, <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>she?</b> Margery, I have been {{thinking}} to- day--in fact, I was thinking it yesterday and all the week--that really we might settle our little business this summer.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, surely, John, {{what you}} think is right must be for the best," [...] said the girl quietly, with trust and {{confidence}} in her pale plain face and loving hazel eyes. [...] "But poor granny, <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>she</b> to cross the seas?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To-morrow!" [...] exclaimed Johanna; [...] "and <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>she</b> to be meetly clad? Look at this widow-garb; {{and how is}} time to {{be found}} for {{procuring}} other raiment? House-father, a substantial man like you should better understand! The meal too! I must to gossip Sophie!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{knew more}} of it than my dear {{mistress}} did herself, sir—a thousand times more. <b>How</b> <b>was</b> <b>she,</b> who <b>was</b> as innocent as a child, {{to know what was}} the meaning of the covert addresses of a villain?” ...|$|R
60|$|When Osborne {{heard that}} his friend had found her, he made hot and anxious {{inquiries}} regarding the poor child. <b>How</b> <b>was</b> <b>she?</b> <b>How</b> did she look? What did she say? His comrade took his hand, and {{looked him in}} the face.|$|R
60|$|It then {{occurred}} to Lady Carbury {{that if this}} were true the marriage after all might <b>be</b> suitable. But <b>how</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> {{to find out whether}} it was true? 'I understand that your papa is opposed to it,' she said.|$|R
