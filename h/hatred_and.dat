5|$|The R+L=J theory {{posits that}} rather than Rhaegar {{kidnapping}} Lyanna, {{they fell in love}} and ran away together. Living for a year in the Tower of Joy, they conceived a child—Jon. Rhaegar was killed in battle by Robert, and Lyanna died in childbirth. Ned claimed the baby as his own to protect him from Robert, who sought to exterminate all Targaryens out of <b>hatred</b> <b>and</b> to secure his claim to the throne.|$|E

However, he now feels threatened by Chief, a younger, faster Black and Tan Coonhound. Copper hates Chief, who is taking Copper's place as pack leader. During a bear hunt, Chief protects the Master when the bear turns on him, while Copper is too afraid of the bear to confront him. The Master ignores Copper to heap praise on Chief and Copper's <b>hatred</b> <b>and</b> jealousy grow.|$|E

5|$|Drizzt Do'Urden's {{stories are}} set in the Forgotten Realms {{campaign}} setting for Dungeons & Dragons. The character has been a mainstay for author R. A. Salvatore, appearing in his novels for over 20 years. Drizzt is a drow who acts against the drow stereotype, favoring friendship and peace over <b>hatred</b> <b>and</b> violence. His unusual personality creates the conflict that allows Salvatore to create so many novels with stories about courage and friendship. Drizzt fights the dark traits that are inherent in the drow.|$|E

Following a trial protested by several international human rights groups for irregularities—including alleged torture and the courtroom intimidation of witnesses by police—Askarov was given a life sentence, which he is currently serving. In November 2010, Askarov's health {{was reported to be}} rapidly deteriorating {{as a result of his}} confinement. Numerous groups have advocated on his behalf, including Human Rights Watch, Reporters Without Borders, People In Need, the Committee to Protect Journalists, and Amnesty International, the latter of which designated him a prisoner of conscience.|$|E

5|$|The {{prosecution}} {{case was}} that Bamber, motivated by <b>hatred</b> <b>and</b> greed, had left White House Farm around 10pm on 6 August 1985, after dining with his family, {{to drive to}} his home in Head Street, Goldhanger. Later, perhaps {{in the early hours of}} the morning of 7 August, he had returned to the farm on his mother's bicycle—which he had borrowed a few days earlier—cycling along a route that avoided the main roads and approaching the house from the back. He had entered the house through a downstairs bathroom window, taken the rifle with the silencer attached, and gone upstairs.|$|E
5|$|In another Buddhist text Majjhima Nikāya, the Buddha criticizes Jain {{emphasis}} on the destruction of unobservable and unverifiable types of karma {{as a means to}} end suffering, rather than on eliminating evil mental states such as greed, <b>hatred</b> <b>and</b> delusion, which are observable and verifiable. In the Upālisutta dialogue of this Majjhima Nikāya text, Buddha contends with a Jain monk who asserts that bodily actions are the most criminal, in comparison to the actions of speech and mind. Buddha criticises this view, saying that the actions of mind are most criminal, and not the actions of speech or body. Buddha also criticises the Jain ascetic practice of various austerities, claiming that he, Buddha, is happier when not practising the austerities.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Wilis have cornered {{a terrified}} Hilarion. They use their magic {{to force him}} to dance until he is nearly dead, and then drown him in a nearby lake. Then they turn on Albrecht, {{sentencing}} him to death as well. He pleads to Myrtha for his life, but she coldly refuses. Giselle's pleas are also dismissed and Albrecht is forced to dance until sunrise. However, the power of Giselle's love counters the Wilis' magic and spares his life. The other spirits return to their graves at daybreak, but Giselle has broken through the chains of <b>hatred</b> <b>and</b> vengeance that control the Wilis, and is thus released from their powers. After bidding a tender farewell to Albrecht, Giselle returns to her grave to rest in peace.|$|E

5|$|Miguel feigned {{compliance}} with PedroI's plans. As {{soon as he}} was declared regent in early 1828, and backed by Carlota Joaquina, he abrogated the Constitution and, supported by those Portuguese in favor of absolutism, was acclaimed King Dom MiguelI. As painful as was his beloved brother's betrayal, PedroI also endured the defection of his surviving sisters, Maria Teresa, Maria Francisca, Isabel Maria and Maria da Assunção, to MiguelI's faction. Only his youngest sister, Ana de Jesus, remained faithful to him, and she later traveled to Rio de Janeiro to be close to him. Consumed by <b>hatred</b> <b>and</b> beginning to believe rumors that MiguelI had murdered their father, PedroI turned his focus on Portugal and tried in vain to garner international support for MariaII's rights.|$|E
5|$|The German {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union began on 22 June. Over the next two days, the sporadic revolts by Serbs against the NDH in eastern Herzegovina erupted into mass rebellion, triggered by Ustaše persecution, Serb solidarity with the Russian people, <b>hatred</b> <b>and</b> fear of the NDH authorities, and other factors. Serb rebels, {{under the leadership of}} both local Serbs and Montenegrins, attacked police, gendarmerie, Ustaše and Croatian Home Guard forces in the region. In the first few days, the rebels captured gendarmerie posts in several villages, set up roadblocks on the major roads and ambushed several military vehicles. On the night of 26 June, the rebels mounted a sustained attack on the town of Nevesinje in an attempt to capture it, but the garrison held out until the morning of 28 June when NDH troops broke through the rebel roadblocks.|$|E
5|$|When {{the game}} starts, Kratos has been serving the gods for ten years. He kills the Hydra {{on behalf of}} Poseidon, but he has grown tired of his service and suffering. He summons Athena, who states that if Kratos {{performs}} one final act—the murder of Ares—he will be forgiven for killing his family. Ares is waging war on the city of Athens out of <b>hatred</b> <b>and</b> jealousy of his sister Athena, who assigns Kratos to destroy Ares because Zeus has forbidden divine intervention. Athena guides Kratos to the war-torn Athens. After a strange encounter with a gravedigger who encourages him to continue his task, Kratos battles his way to Athens's oracle, finds her, and learns {{that the only way}} to defeat Ares is with Pandora's Box, a mythical artifact that grants the power to kill a god.|$|E

5|$|Alvarado's subjugation of Honduras proved superficial, {{and largely}} limited to Higueras. His {{conquest of the}} Naco valley and the lower Ulúa River firmly {{established}} a Spanish presence there, but beyond that Spanish control was fragile. Expeditions had penetrated deeply across Honduras, and distant native rulers had come to offer homage to the Spanish Crown. The settlement at Gracias a Dios was not as secure as it had appeared when Alvarado left, and no effective assistance {{had been sent to}} Trujillo. Many native rulers, who had been cowed by Alvarado's formidable reputation and military skill, rose in rebellion as soon as he left the province. Alvarado had also encouraged the enslavement of natives that fought against the Spanish, and their subsequent sale, as well as general harsh treatment of the indigenous population; this produced considerable resentment among the Indians, and left them susceptible to rebellion. Many natives resisted passively, by not providing supplies or labour to their encomenderos. Continued slave raids, and ferocious treatment {{at the hands of the}} Achi Maya auxiliaries increased their <b>hatred</b> <b>and</b> resistance, and many Indians abandoned their settlements and fled to the mountains and forests. The greater part of the districts of San Pedro and Gracias a Dios were at war, and the Spanish position was again precarious.|$|E
5|$|Meyszner's time in Belgrade was characterised by {{friction}} and competition with German military, economic and foreign affairs officials, {{and by his}} visceral <b>hatred</b> <b>and</b> distrust of Serbs. During his tenure, he oversaw regular reprisal killings and sent {{tens of thousands of}} forced labourers to the Reich and occupied Norway. His Gestapo detachment used a gas van to kill as many as 8,000 Jewish women and children that had been detained at the Sajmište concentration camp. In April 1944, his outspoken complaints about a reduction in reprisals against civilians allowed his enemies within the German occupation regime in Serbia to have him removed. Himmler transferred him to Berlin with the task of establishing a Europe-wide gendarmerie. After the war, he fell {{into the hands of the}} Allies and was interrogated by the United States Chief Counsel for the Prosecution of Axis Criminality. Extradited to Yugoslavia, he was tried for war crimes, along with many of his staff from his time in Serbia. He was found guilty by a Yugoslav military court and executed by hanging in January 1947.|$|E
5|$|On the moon, {{the party}} meets the sage Fusoya, who {{explains}} that Cecil's {{father was a}} Lunarian. Fusoya also explains that a Lunarian named Zemus plans to destroy life on the Blue Planet so that the Lunarians can take over, using Golbez to summon the Giant of Babil, a colossal robot. The party returns to Earth and {{the forces of the}} two worlds attack the Giant, including Palom and Porom, who have been revived. After the party breaks the robot, Golbez and Kain confront them, only to have Fusoya break Zemus' control over Golbez, in turn releasing Kain. Cecil learns that Golbez is his older brother. Golbez and Fusoya head to the core of the moon to defeat Zemus, and Cecil's party follows. In the moon's core, the party witnesses Golbez and Fusoya kill Zemus, but then quickly fall to his resurrected form, the spirit Zeromus, the embodiment of all of Zemus' <b>hatred</b> <b>and</b> rage. Back on Earth, the Elder of Mysidia commands all of Cecil's allies and friends to pray for the party, which gives Cecil and his allies the strength to fight and slay Zeromus. Following the battle, Fusoya and Golbez opt to leave Earth with the moon. Cecil, at last accepting the truth, acknowledges Golbez as his brother, and bids him farewell.|$|E
