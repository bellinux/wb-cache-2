Disproven hypotheses include systemic acidosis (high levels of acid in the blood), electrolyte changes and hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose). Although many biochemical changes are known to occur in the brain of a patient on the ketogenic diet, it is not known which of these has an anticonvulsant effect. The lack of understanding in this area is similar to the situation with many anticonvulsant drugs.|$|E

5|$|For {{many years}} the African river martin {{was the sole}} member of its genus and {{subfamily}} until {{the discovery of the}} white-eyed river martin, Pseudochelidon eurystomina, by Thai ornithologist Kitti Thonglongya in 1968. Although some authorities follow Brooke in placing that species in a separate genus Eurochelidon due to its significant differences from the African species, <b>it</b> <b>remains</b> <b>a</b> member of the same subfamily. Genetic studies confirmed that the two river martins form a distinct clade from the typical swallows in the Hirundininae subfamily.|$|E

5|$|New Zealand is a multiethnic society, {{and home}} to people of many {{different}} national origins. Originally composed solely of the Māori who arrived in the thirteenth century, the ethnic makeup of the population later became dominated by New Zealanders of European descent. In the nineteenth century, European settlers brought diseases for which the Māori had no immunity. By the 1890s, the Māori population was approximately 40 percent of its size pre-contact. The Māori population increased during the twentieth century, though <b>it</b> <b>remains</b> <b>a</b> minority.|$|E
5|$|The Port of Montreal {{is one of}} {{the largest}} inland ports in the world {{handling}} 26 million tonnes of cargo annually.

For this reason, Montreal is the railway hub of Canada and has always been an extremely important rail city; it is home to the headquarters of the Canadian National Railway, and was home to the headquarters of the Canadian Pacific Railway until 1995.|$|E

5|$|Tittle was {{the fourth}} player to throw seven {{touchdown}} passes in a game, when he did so in 1962 against the Redskins. He followed Sid Luckman (1943), Adrian Burk (1954), and George Blanda (1961). The feat has since been equaled by four more players: Joe Kapp (1969), Peyton Manning (2013), Nick Foles (2013), and Drew Brees (2015). Tittle, Manning and Foles did it without an interception. His 36 touchdown passes in 1963 set a record which stood for over two decades until it was surpassed by Dan Marino in 1984; as of 2016 <b>it</b> <b>remains</b> <b>a</b> Giants franchise record.|$|E
5|$|While no {{announcement}} {{has been}} made of plans to start Regional Eurostar services, <b>it</b> <b>remains</b> <b>a</b> possibility for the future. In the meantime, the closest equivalent to Regional Eurostar services are same-station connections with East Midlands Trains and Thameslink, changing at St Pancras. The recent construction of a new concourse at adjacent King's Cross Station has improved interchange with St Pancras and provided Virgin Trains East Coast, Great Northern, Hull Trains and Grand Central services with easier connections to Eurostar.|$|E
5|$|After facing {{criticism}} {{for a lack}} of production in the first two weeks, Smith turned in a record-setting performance against the St. Louis Rams in Week 3. In the first quarter, he scored on each of his first three career receptions with 74-, 41-, and 18-yard touchdowns. The 74-yard score was the longest completion of quarterback Joe Flacco's career. He became the first NFL rookie, and only the twelfth player, to amass three touchdown receptions in a single quarter. Smith finished the game with five receptions for 152yards in the 37–7 victory. <b>It</b> <b>remains</b> <b>a</b> Ravens rookie record, as does Smith's 30.4 yards per catch that day.|$|E

5|$|Elsewhere in Europe, {{the beetle}} became {{established}} near USA {{military bases in}} Bordeaux during or immediately following World War I and had proceeded to spread {{by the beginning of}} World War II to Belgium, the Netherlands and Spain. The population increased dramatically during and immediately following World War II and spread eastward, and the beetle is now found over much of the continent. After World War II, in the Soviet occupation zone of Germany, almost half of all potato fields were infested by the beetle by 1950. In East Germany they were known as Amikäfer ('Yankee beetles') following a governmental claim that the beetles were dropped by American planes. In the EU <b>it</b> <b>remains</b> <b>a</b> regulated (quarantine) pest for the UK, Republic of Ireland, Balearic Islands, Cyprus, Malta and southern parts of Sweden and Finland. It is not established in any of these Member States, but occasional infestations can occur when, for example, wind blows adults from Russia to Finland.|$|E
5|$|Legislation {{was passed}} in 1988 that removed the need for {{veterans}} to prove a causal link between certain forms of cancer and radiation exposure due to nuclear tests. Incidence of the main expected causes of this increased mortality, leukemia and other cancers, was not significantly higher than normal. Death by those diseases was tabulated {{on the assumption that}} if radiation exposure had a life-shortening effect it would likely show up there, but it did not. Not enough data were gathered on other causes of death to determine the reason for this increase in all-cause mortality, and <b>it</b> <b>remains</b> <b>a</b> mystery. The mortality increase was higher, 5.7%, for those who boarded target ships after the tests than for those who did not, whose mortality increase was only 4.3%.|$|E
5|$|More recently, {{the book}} has {{influenced}} a number of non-fiction books including The Song of the Dodo by David Quammen (1997), which discussed Wallace's contributions {{to the field of}} island biogeography; The Spice Islands Voyage by Tim Severin (1997) that retraced Wallace's travels; and Archipelago: The Islands of Indonesia, by Gavan Daws (1999), which compared the environment described by Wallace with the modern state of the archipelago.
