The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effect of HFS on reported pain sensitivity to <b>single</b> <b>electrical</b> stimuli applied within the area of conditioning stimulation. We also investigated the central nervous system responsiveness to these electrical stimuli by measuring event-related potentials (ERPs). <b>Single</b> <b>electrical</b> test stimuli were applied in the conditioned area before and 30 min after HFS. During electrical test stimulation, the reported pain intensity (numerical rating scale) and EEG (ERPs) were measured. Thirty minutes after conditioning stimulation, we observed a decrease of reported pain intensity at both the conditioned and control (opposite arm) skin site in response to the <b>single</b> <b>electrical</b> test stimuli. In contrast, we observed enhanced ERP amplitudes after HFS at the conditioned skin site, compared with control site, in response to the <b>single</b> <b>electrical</b> test stimuli.

40|$|A {{new type}} of single channel {{recording}} is described. Large pores were generated in the membranes of resealed human erythrocyte ghosts by incubation with perforin (cytolysin). The flux of the polar fluorescent probe Lucifer Yellow was measured in single ghosts by the fluorescence microphotolysis (photobleaching) technique. The distribution of flux rates for ghosts treated with a limiting perforin concentration showed equidistantly spaced peaks suggesting that subpopulations of ghosts with 0, 1 and 2 pores were resolved. Furthermore, distributions obtained for very different perforin concentrations could be well simulated by using one common value for the flux rate of the single pore (k = 4. 65 x 10 (- 3) s) and assuming a Poisson distribution of pores among ghosts. The flux rate of the single pore corresponds to a pore radius of approximately 50 A, a value which is much smaller than that obtained previously by electron microscopic studies but which agrees well with recent <b>electrical</b> <b>single</b> channel recordings. Mature perforin pores were observed to be very stable. No closing events were detected at a time resolution of 0. 2 s {{for a wide range}} of temperatures and Ca 2 + concentrations. However, the formation of new pores was an unexpectedly slow process. Fluorescence microscopic single channel recording as introduced by this study is applicable to a variety of cellular systems and fluorescent probes and thus may complement the information obtainable by <b>electrical</b> <b>single</b> channel recording of anorganic ion fluxes...|$|E

40|$|AbstractFor the {{analysis}} of membrane transport processes two single molecule methods are available that differ profoundly in data acquisition principle, achievable information, and application range: the widely employed <b>electrical</b> <b>single</b> channel recording and the more recently established optical single transporter recording. In this study dense arrays of microscopic horizontal bilayer membranes between 0. 8 μm and 50 μm in diameter were created in transparent foils containing either microholes or microcavities. Prototypic protein nanopores were formed in bilayer membranes by addition of Staphylococcus aureus α-hemolysin (α-HL). Microhole arrays were used to monitor the formation of bilayer membranes and single α-HL pores by confocal microscopy and electrical recording. Microcavity arrays were used to characterize the formation of bilayer membranes and the flux of fluorescent substrates and inorganic ions through single transporters by confocal microscopy. Thus, the unitary permeability of the α-HL pore was determined for calcein and Ca 2 + ions. The study paves the way for an amalgamation of electrical and optical single transporter recording. Electro-optical single transporter recording could provide so far unresolved kinetic data {{of a large number}} of cellular transporters, leading to an extension of the nanopore sensor approach to the single molecule analysis of peptide transport by translocases...|$|E

The objective of the review is to determine that this system satisfies the requirements of GDC 5, 17, and 18, and will perform its design functions during all plant operating and accident conditions. The offsite power system is referred to in industry standards and regulatory guides as the "preferred power system.

40|$|Biological and {{solid-state}} nanopore sensors {{have proven}} their capability of high-throughput <b>electrical</b> <b>single</b> molecule sensing and potential in DNA/RNA sequencing. On the other hand, optofluidics, {{the combination of}} integrated optics and microfluidics, has drawn extensive attention over the past decade. The combination of nanopore technology and optofluidics is bound to bring impressive features and superiority. In this work, we innovatively integrated the solid-state nanopore into an optofluidic device, anti-resonant reflecting optical waveguides (ARROWs), to form an electro-opto-fluidic sensing platform, and demonstrate {{for the first time}} correlated electro-optical detection of single biological nanoparticles. In order to successfully fabricate the solid-state nanopore in the semiconductor based ARROWs, we developed different fabrication methods, which are either based on standard semiconductor processes, or require the help of a focused ion beam milling. Solid-state nanopores fabricated with these methods were thoroughly characterized, analyzed, and compared using cross section analysis, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, and finite element simulation. We demonstrated that the fabrication dependent geometric shape of the pore determines the electrical blockade signal. Afterwards, our nanopore-optofluidic device was used for the correlated electro-optical detection of single synthesized nanoparticles, single viruses, and single DNA molecules. The nanopore functions as a smart gate for sequential introduction of single nanoparticles for optical analysis. We proved that the electrical signals and the optical signals of individual nanoparticles can be clearly detected and cross correlated with a fidelity of up to 100 %. On top of that, the electrical signal and the optical signal were used together to distinguish and identify different particles which could not be differentiated using either one of the signals. Moreover, information about the flow velocity, the particle-nanopore interaction, and the particle's fine structure could be extracted by analyzing electrical and optical signals. Furthermore, the combined analysis of optical signal intensity distribution and the simulated particle locations in the flow assisted us to find out the optical mode location. Both the results and the theoretical analysis show that our novel electro-opto-fluidic platform is promising for further scientific research and clinical applications...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the design improvement of a Sequential Shunt Switching Regulator (S 3 R) {{based on a}} power cell composed of one switching FET and one Diode connecting the Solar Array (SA) section to the Main Bus. This topology allows to minimize the S 3 R cells dimensions, to optimize the efficiency figures and complies with the <b>electrical</b> <b>Single</b> Point Failure Free (SPFF) requirement on the Main Bus. The single switching FET can cause the loss of one Solar array section if it fails in short circuit, while its failure in open can be compensated {{by the presence of}} one additional (spare) shunt section positioned on Main Bus to drain the power eventually in excess. If the series redundancy of the Diode is removed, its failure in short circuit, causes overload on the Main Bus when the switching FET turns ON. To avoid the possible subsequent failure in short circuit of the switching FET due to over-heating, with permanent loss of Main Bus, the maximum current drawn by the FET in failure condition and the duration of this operation mode must be strictly controlled in order to avoid thermal overstress and consequently thermal failure propagation. The adopted solution foresees a circuitry that controls the current in the FET, both the peak in the first transient and the subsequent limited value, and forces the FET in permanent open status after a short period, compatible with the overheat of the FET junction. No spurious cause leads to the permanent loss of the S 3 R section due to permanent activation of the protection, causing the switching element (FET) to be continuously open. In fact a dedicated circuit, activated by sensing of the Error Signal, unlatches the section to restore the power control. The presented design has found its first application in the PCDU for the COSMO-SkyMed Second Generation (CSG) satellite power system. A dedicated Elegant Bread Board of the S 3 R, integrated with the board designed to control the Battery Current and Voltage has been tested in the design and development plan of CSG PCDU...|$|E
