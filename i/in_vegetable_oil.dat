5|$|As {{the home}} country of {{beetroot}} borscht, Ukraine boasts great {{diversity of the}} soup's regional variants, with virtually every province having its own recipe. Differences between particular varieties may regard the type of stock used (meat, bone, or both), the kind of meat (beef, pork, poultry, etc.), the choice of vegetables and the method of cutting and cooking them. For example, although the typical recipe calls for beef and pork, the Kiev variant uses mutton or lamb as well as beef, while in the Poltava region, the stock for borscht is cooked on poultry meat, that is, chicken, duck or goose. The use of zucchini, beans and apples is characteristic of the Chernihiv borscht; in this variant, beetroots are sautéed <b>in</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>oil</b> rather than lard, and the sour taste comes solely from tomatoes and tart apples. The Lviv borscht is based on bone stock and is served with chunks of Vienna sausages.|$|E

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{results of}} a recent study done in Norway from Bergen University, to determine temperature dependence of linear birefringence in mineral oil and linear and induced birefringence <b>in</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils.</b> The study was done between the temperature range of 6 and 45 ºC in magnetic field up to 140 mT. It found the intrinsic birefringences responsible for optical activity <b>in</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> with impurities and all mineral oils. The results of optical activity in both oils obeyed the equation f = A + aw (1) where aw is the angle at which minimum irradiance Imin occurs in water and other substances which are optically inactive. Heavy oils like red diesel, Esso diesel and Fina diesel No. 2 rotate more the vibration plane and they possess more intrinsic birefringences than light diesel. The research team found that the temperature effect on rotation in both mineral and <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> with impurities, yielded results that obeyed the equation f 1 = A - bT (3) where b is positive. <b>In</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> for human consumption, application of magnetic field causes induced birefringences responsible for f given by f 2 = VHL + aw (4) where V is Verdet’s constant in rad T- 1 m- 1 and H is the magnetic field intensity in Am- 1.

2500|$|Most {{vegetable}} oil {{used in the}} US is produced from GM crops canola, corn, cotton and soybeans. Vegetable oil is sold directly to consumers as cooking oil, shortening and margarine and is used in prepared foods. There is a vanishingly small amount of protein or DNA from the original crop <b>in</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>oil.</b> Vegetable oil is made of triglycerides extracted from plants or seeds and then refined and may be further processed via hydrogenation to turn liquid oils into solids. [...] The refining process removes all, or nearly all non-triglyceride ingredients. Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) offer an alternative to conventional fats and oils. The length of a fatty acid influences its fat absorption during the digestive process. Fatty acids in the middle position on the glycerol molecules appear to be absorbed more easily and influence metabolism more than fatty acids on the end positions. Unlike ordinary fats, MCTs are metabolized like carbohydrates. They have exceptional oxidative stability, and prevent foods from turning rancid readily.|$|E
