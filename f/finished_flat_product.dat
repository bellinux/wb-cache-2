50|$|In 2003, Lisco {{exported}} 373 kn of {{finished products}} (48.5% of production). 881 kn of various products were exported in 2004, including 477 kn of HBI (54% of exports) and 72 kn of rebar. It {{is considered the}} only Arab company manufacturing this material. <b>Flat</b> <b>products</b> were 59% of exports in 2004. Europe received about 64.4% followed by Asian and Arab countries. Higher domestic demand for rebar resulted in exports declining to 20 kn in 2004. Exports {{in the first half}} of 2005 was approximately 384 kn; mostly HBI (54%) and <b>flat</b> <b>products</b> (31.7%). Exports fell for long <b>products</b> (81%), <b>flat</b> <b>products</b> (20%) and HBI (5%). This drop is due to the fact that the company stopped exporting rebar as well as a global recession, which led to a demand contraction for iron and steel products, particularly hot-rolled coils and HBI. Exports in 2006 exceeded one million tons, including 449 kn of <b>flat</b> <b>products.</b> During the first quarter of 2006 Lisco increased hot-rolled coils exports by 125% and exported sponge iron for the first time.|$|R

Production of long and <b>flat</b> <b>products</b> grew 18% in 2004; mainly rebar (460kt); hot-rolled coils (429kt) and HBI (606kt). Lisco produced over 574 kn of finished {{products in the}} first half of 2005, increasing 65% over the first half of 2004. The company also increased liquid steel production 52%. Rebar was 57.3% of finished products, hot-rolled coils was 39.3%. Sponge iron production was 579.407 tons, 348.243 tons of HBI, 376.239 tons of billets and blooms and 281.832 tons of slabs. During the first nine months of 2005, Lisco reached its highest production ever; 1 million tons of liquid steel. This was confirmed by Secretary of the Popular Committee, Dr. Mohammad Abu Ojeila Al-Mabrouk at celebrations in September 2005 on the occasion of the passage of 15 years since the company’s mills began production, which concurs with the anniversary of the Al-Fatah Revolution in Libya. In 2005, Lisco achieved the highest rate of increase in steel production among Arab companies, which amounted to 34.8%. Its production increased by 65% in the period from January to June 2005 compared with the same period of 2004. Production of both long and <b>flat</b> <b>products</b> was 1.070 tons in 2006. <b>Flat</b> <b>products</b> achieved a new output record for the company of 564kt, 13% higher than 2005. Production of bars and rods was 26% lower than 2005. Long product sales were 642 kn in 2006, a sizeable increase from 634 kn in 2005, forcing the company to import 168 kn of long products, mostly from Ukraine.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} of this research project {{was to determine the}} elemental composition of steel products manufactured by the most popular company in the country. The analysis by independent institution will be instructive for the consumers and helpful for the manufacturer company in order to upgrade the quality of its final steel products. The X-ray fluorescence (XRF) technique was used in this work to determine the elemental composition of long and <b>flat</b> steel <b>products</b> manufactured by this local company. The long products analyzed in this research work are some concrete reinforcing bars and wire rods, while the <b>flat</b> <b>products</b> analyzed including hot and cold rolled coils, and zinc galvanized coils. The results of these analyses show that most elemental compositions obtained conform to the values claimed by the company except that for silicon and manganese which exhibit slightly higher value for some long products. Nevertheless, the elemental compositions obtained for <b>flat</b> <b>products</b> conform to the specifications claimed by the company...|$|R

It was decided that both profile and <b>flat</b> <b>products</b> would be catered for in a plant with an ultimate capacity of 8 million tons per annum of liquid steel. Subsequent changes in steel markets has meant that extension to <b>flat</b> <b>products</b> has been delayed indefinitely and the current capacity is about 2,00 million tons of liquid steel.|$|R
