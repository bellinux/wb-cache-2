40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} an anthropomorphic robotic finger that {{is composed of}} three biomimetic joints whose biomechanics and dynamic properties are close to their human counterparts. By using five pneumatic cylinders, the robotic finger is actuated {{through a series of}} simplified antagonistic tendons whose insertion points and moment arms at each joint are inherited from the anatomy of the human finger. The dynamics of the artificial finger is investigated under PID control for the tasks of set point stabilization and disturbance rejection, set point tracking and trajectory tracking. An air dynamic model is empirically derived for controlling the pneumatic system. The kinematic model of the artificial <b>finger</b> <b>system</b> is constructed with help of MuJoCo- a physics engine custom-developed- to simulate the interaction between the finger’s joints and tendons. Experimental data of the tendon excursions are used to validate the efficacy of the simulation model.

If the movements predicted by the feed forward model of the user match the real actions of the sixth finger, then the user will be able to reach more targets in a given time. In our experiments, the group without visual feedback from the sixth finger had an slightly better performance, pointing that they had to rely less on the visual information, and more in the tactile information, which would have helped in creating a better efferent copy of the sixth <b>finger</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

Columnar-basalts are geological formations observed {{in some of the}} ponded basalt-lava found at many parts of the world. They are prismatic rock joints having polygonal cross-section with straight edges and parallel faces. The typical cross-sectional dimensions vary from few centimeters to meter size and typical height from 30 - 50 meters. Hence the aspect ratio of the columnar-basalt in most cases is greater than 100. The limitations for the evolution of columnar basalts provided in the literature have been discussed. An order of magnitude analysis has been presented for the thickness of the unstable layer at the interface. In this paper, we demonstrate that the double diffusive finger convection system can produce features similar to those observed in columnar basalt and can serve as an alternative, plausible explanation for the evolution of columnar basalt structure. </p...|$|E

30|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been great {{interest}} {{in the possibility of}} using artificial limbs {{as an extension of the}} human body as well as replacement of lost limbs. In this paper, we develop a sixth <b>finger</b> <b>system</b> as an extension of the human body. We then investigate how an extra robotic thumb, that works as a sixth finger and gives somatosensory feedback to the user, modifies the body schema, and also affecting the self-perception of existing limbs. The sixth robotic finger is controlled with the thumb of the opposite hand, and contact information is conveyed via electrostimulation to the tip of the thumb controlling the movement. We conducted reaching task experiments with and without visual information to evaluate the level of embodiment of the sixth robotic finger and the modification of the self-perception of the finger controlling the system. The experimental results indicate that not only the sixth finger is incorporated into the body schema of the user, but also the body schema of the controlling finger is modified; ability of the brain to adapt to different scenarios and geometries of the body is also implied.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In recent years, Japanese {{society has}} been aging, engendering a labor {{shortage}} of young workers. Robots are therefore expected to perform tasks such as rehabilitation, nursing elderly people, and day-to-day work support for elderly people. The pneumatic balloon actuator is a rubber artificial muscle developed {{for use in a}} robot hand in such environments. This actuator has a long stroke and a high power-to-weight ratio compared with the present pneumatic artificial muscle. Moreover, the dynamic characteristics of this actuator resemble those of human muscle. This study evaluated characteristics of force control of balloon actuator using a predictive functional control (PFC) system with disturbance observer. The predictive functional control is a model-based predictive control (MPC) scheme that predicts the future outputs of the actual plants over the prediction horizon and computes the control effort over the control horizon at every sampling instance. For this study, a 1 -link <b>finger</b> <b>system</b> using a pneumatic balloon actuator is developed. Then experiments of PFC control with disturbance observer are performed. These experiments demonstrate the feasibility of its control of a pneumatic balloon actuator for a robot hand. Keywords—Disturbance observer, Pneumatic balloon, Predictiv...|$|E
40|$|Crowdsensing leverages human intelligence/experience {{from the}} general public and social {{interactions}} to create participatory sensor networks, where context-aware and semantically complex information is gathered, processed, and shared to collaboratively solve specific problems. This paper proposes a real-time projector-camera <b>finger</b> <b>system</b> based on the crowdsensing, in which user can interact with a computer by bare hand touching on arbitrary surfaces. The interaction process of the system can be completely carried out automatically, and it can be used as an intelligent device in intelligent transport system where the driver can watch and interact with the display information while driving, without causing visual distractions. A single camera is used in the system to recover 3 D information of fingertip for hand touch detection. A linear-scanning method is used in the system to determine the touch for increasing the users’ collaboration and operationality. Experiments are performed to show the feasibility of the proposed system. The system is robust to different lighting conditions. The average percentage of correct hand touch detection of the system is 92. 0 % and the average time of processing one video frame is 30 milliseconds...|$|E
40|$|This is a {{transient}} two-dimensional numerical study of double-diffusive salt fingers in a two-layer heat-salt {{system for a}} wide range of initial density stability ratio (R-rho 0) and thermal Rayleigh numbers (Ra-T similar to 10 (3) - 10 (11)). Salt fingers have been studied for several decades now, but several perplexing features of this rich and complex system remain unexplained. The work in question studies this problem and shows the morphological variation in fingers from low to high thermal Rayleigh numbers, which have been missed by the previous investigators. Considerable variations in convective structures and evolution pattern were observed in the range of Ra-T used in the simulation. Evolution of salt fingers was studied by monitoring the finger structures, kinetic energy, vertical profiles, velocity fields, and transient variation of R-rho(t). The results show that large scale convection that limits the finger length was observed only at high Rayleigh numbers. The transition from nonlinear to linear convection occurs at about Ra-T similar to 10 (8). Contrary to the popular notion, R-rho(t) first decrease during diffusion before the onset time and then increase when convection begins at the interface. Decrease in R-rho(t) is substantial at low Ra-T and it decreases even below unity resulting in overturning of the system. Interestingly, all the <b>finger</b> <b>system</b> passes through the same state before the onset of convection irrespective of Rayleigh number and density stability ratio of the system.

The scenario provides a good match to the observed moments is obtained, gives clues to the development of filaments or fingers and entrainment of the molecular material, and associates the observed high velocity blueshifted emission to the region. The H 2 line emission is produced by a slow J-shock (20 km/s) in the clumps with an emissivity proportional to v 1. 8. Estimates for the total wind mass and clumps mass yield 0. 5 Msolar and 15 Msolar inside a radius of 1 arcmin (0. 1 pc).

The problemof stiff contacts between the slave and the environment isgiven specific attention. The work {{has been carried out}} at KTHbased on an initial cooperation with Karolinska Sjukhuset. Theaim of the over all project is to study the possibilities forintroduction of a force reflective teleoperator in neurologicalskullbase operations for the particular task of bone millingand thereby, hopefully, increase patient safety, decreasesurgeon workload and cost forthe society. The main contributions of this thesis are: Derivation of a dynamical model of the master andoperator 9 ̆ 2 s <b>finger</b> <b>system</b> and, experimental identificationof ranges on model parameter values. Based on this model, theinteraction channel controllers optimized for transparency arederived and modified to avoid the influence of the uncertainmodel parameters. This results in a three channel structure. Todecrease the influence of the uncertain parameters locally atthe master, a control loop is designed such that the frequencyresponse of the reflected force is relatively unaffected by theuncertainties, a result also confirmed in a transparencyanalysis based on the H-matrix. The developed teleoperatorcontrol structure is tested in experiments where the operatorcould alter the contact force without facing any problems aslong as the slave is in contact with the environment. As a result of the severe difficulties for the teleoperatorto move from free space motion to in-contact manipulationwithout oscillative behaviour, a new detection algorithm basedon passivity theory is developed. The algorithm is able todetect the non-passive behaviour of the actual teleoperatorinduced by the discrete change in system dynamics occurring atthe contact instant. A stabilization controller to be activatedby the detection algorithm is designed and implemented on themaster side of the teleoperator. The detection algorithm andthe stabilization controller are shown highly effective in realexperiments. All major research results presented in the thesis have beenverified experimentally.

Determinou-se o efeito do tratamento com inseticidas ou grafite sobre o ângulo de repouso de sementes de milho, e avaliou-se o efeito da velocidade de deslocamento, do tratamento químico e com grafite das sementes, além da classificação por peneiras, no desempenho de dois sistemas distribuidores, de disco e de dedos prensores. Os testes foram realizados em uma bancada montada em laboratório com sementes classificadas em diferentes peneiras e submetidas a seis tratamentos, testadas em duas velocidades de deslocamento e em dois sistemas de distribuição de sementes. O delineamento utilizado foi em blocos casualizados, com três repetições. No sistema de dedos prensores, o uso do inseticida melhorou significativamente o desempenho da semeadora, ao contrário do verificado no sistema de disco.
