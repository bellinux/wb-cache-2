The increasing number of applications of the PIV technique expected in near future requires a flexible <b>image</b> <b>shifting</b> system, which can be easily adapted to most different problems and experimental set-ups. Such a system, which must able to provide very high and easily adjustable shift velocities, can be attained by utilizing a rotating mirror for <b>image</b> <b>shifting.</b> In contrast to other <b>image</b> <b>shifting</b> methods no additional demands have to made on the light source and the scattering behaviour of the tracer particles. Problems as e. g. generating and controlling the rotation of the mirror and synchronizing the laser pulses with the angular position of the mirror have been solved successfully. A detailed theoretical model of the imaging of tracer particles by means of a rotating mirror system, which is required to obtain information about the accuracy of the method, is presented here for the first time. Further capabilities of the <b>image</b> <b>shifting</b> technique, which - in general - increase the applicability of the PIV-method for measuring complex flow fields are also described.

40|$|Abstract. In recent years, depth cameras gained {{increasing}} {{acceptance in}} the areas of robotics and autonomous systems. However, on mobile platforms depth measurements with continuous wave amplitude modula-tion Time-of-Flight cameras suffer from motion artifacts, since multiple acquisitions are required in order to compute one depth map (resulting in longer effective exposure times). Some lenses of different manufacturers include image stabilizers, but they are only able to compensate for small <b>image</b> <b>shifts.</b> Moreover, when performing a phase unwrapping based on the acquisition of multiple depth maps with different modulation frequen-cies, the motion artifacts are significantly more severe. In this paper, a method to compensate camera motions during the acquisition of a single depth map as well as for multiple depth maps is presented. <b>Image</b> <b>shifts</b> are estimated firstly and after normalization the individual phase <b>images</b> are <b>shifted</b> accordingly. The proposed approach is evaluated on different scenes and it is able to facilitate ToF imaging on mobile platforms...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} stereoscopic {{virtual reality}} displays {{in which the}} head is tracked and the display is stationary, attached to a desk, tabletop or wall. These are called stereoscopic HTDs (Head-Tracked Display). Stereoscopic displays render two perspective views of a scene, {{each of which is}} seen by one eye of the user. Ideally the user's natural visual system combines the stereo image pair into a single, 3 D perceived image. Unfortunately users often have difficulty fusing the stereo image pair. Researchers use a number of software techniques to reduce fusion problems. This paper geometrically examines and compares a number of these techniques and reaches the following conclusions. In interactive stereoscopic applications, the combination of view placement, scale and either false eye separation or ?-false eye separation can provide fusion control geometrically similar to <b>image</b> <b>shifting</b> and <b>image</b> scaling. However, in stereo HTDs <b>image</b> <b>shifting</b> and <b>image</b> scaling also generate additional geometric artifacts not generated by the other methods. We anecdotally link some of these artifacts to exceeding perceptual limitations of human vision. While formal perceptual studies are still needed, geometric analysis suggests that <b>image</b> <b>shifting</b> and <b>image</b> scaling may be less appropriate for interactive, stereo HTDs than the other methods...|$|R

40|$|During {{locomotion}} animals {{rely heavily}} on visual cues gained from the environment to guide their behavior. Examples are basic behaviors like collision avoidance or the approach to a goal. The saccadic gaze strategy of flying flies, which separates translational from rotational phases of locomotion, has been suggested to facilitate the extraction of environmental information, because only image flow evoked by translational self-motion contains relevant distance information about the surrounding world. In contrast to the translational phases of flight during which gaze direction is kept largely constant, walking flies experience continuous rotational image flow that is coupled to their stride-cycle. The consequences of these self-produced <b>image</b> <b>shifts</b> for the extraction of environmental information are still unclear. To {{assess the impact of}} stride-coupled <b>image</b> <b>shifts</b> on visual information processing, we performed electrophysiological recordings from the HSE cell, a motion sensitive wide-field neuron in the blowfly visual system. This cell has been concluded to {{play a key role in}} mediating optomotor behavior, self-motion estimation and spatial information processing. We used visual stimuli that were based on the visual input experienced by walking blowflies while approaching a black vertical bar. The response of HSE to these stimuli was dominated by periodic membrane potential fluctuations evoked by stride-coupled <b>image</b> <b>shifts.</b> Nevertheless, during the approach the cellâ€™s response contained information about the bar and its background. The response components evoked by the bar were larger than the responses to its background, especially during the last phase of the approach. However, as revealed by targeted modifications of the visual input during walking, the extraction of distance information on the basis of HSE responses is much impaired by stride-coupled retinal <b>image</b> <b>shifts.</b> Possible mechanisms that may cope with these stride-coupled responses are discussed...|$|R

40|$|When {{the eyes}} track a moving object, {{the image of}} a {{stationary}} target shifts on the retina colinearly with the eye movement.
