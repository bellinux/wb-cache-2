Benz later emphasized: I just didn't know how it was going to happen. So when they sent me the script —which I basically had to sign my life away to read—I was sitting in my trailer and I <b>just</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> cry. I thought it was such a beautiful ending, it was the payoff and just really brought her whole life kind of to that one moment. So I was really upset my last day of filming because I really thought it was over to me.|$|E
5|$|That {{afternoon}} three {{troops of}} tanks from the 13th/18th Royal Hussars, {{were sent to}} reinforce the Black Watch, but they had only <b>just</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> move towards the Château when three tanks were destroyed by hidden German self-propelled guns. The other tanks were withdrawn being unable to deploy in the wooded ground around the Château. The {{rest of the day}} and night passed without another attack, but the Germans sent out reconnaissance patrols to establish the exact location of the British positions and German armoured vehicles could be heard moving up to the front during the night.|$|E
5|$|The {{scholarly}} {{study of}} traditional Italian music began in about 1850, {{with a group}} of early philological ethnographers who studied the impact of music on a pan-Italian national identity. A unified Italian identity only <b>just</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> develop after the political integration of the peninsula in 1860. The focus at that time was on the lyrical and literary value of music, rather than the instrumentation; this focus remained until the early 1960s. Two folkloric journals helped to encourage the burgeoning field of study, the Rivista Italiana delle Tradizioni Popolari and Lares, founded in 1894 and 1912, respectively. The earliest major musical studies were on the Sardinian launeddas in 1913-1914 by Mario Giulio Fara; on Sicilian music, published in 1907 and 1921 by Alberto Favara; and studies of the music of Emilia Romagna in 1941 by Francesco Balilla Pratella.|$|E

Graham and Khan lobbied SOM partners to purchase a mainframe computer, a risky investment at a time, when new technologies were <b>just</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> form. The partners agreed, and Khan began programming the system to calculate structural engineering equations, and later, to develop architectural drawings.|$|R
5|$|There is no {{indication}} of feathering on the upper neck and head. While these conceivably may have been nude, this may still be an artefact of preservation. It appears that most Archaeopteryx specimens became embedded in anoxic sediment after drifting some time on their backs in the sea—the head, neck and the tail are generally bent downward, {{which suggests that the}} specimens had <b>just</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> rot when they were embedded, with tendons and muscle relaxing so that the characteristic shape (death pose) of the fossil specimens was achieved. This would mean that the skin already was softened and loose, which is bolstered by the fact that in some specimens the flight feathers were starting to detach at the point of embedding in the sediment. So it is hypothesized that the pertinent specimens moved along the sea bed in shallow water for some time before burial, the head and upper neck feathers sloughing off, while the more firmly attached tail feathers remained.|$|E
25|$|In 1940, the US Army <b>just</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> receive {{its first}} antitank gun, the 37 mm Gun M3. While it fitted {{the request of}} the Infantry for light, easy to manhandle {{anti-tank}} weapon, Artillery and Ordnance foresaw a need for a more powerful gun. This led to a number of expedient designs, such as adaptations of the 75 mm M1897 or towed variants of the 75 mm M3.|$|E

25|$|The three INLA men {{rushed through}} the {{turnstile}} leading to A wing's exercise yard.

The van was ordered to stop by the armed INLA men, however, the driver, John Park, thinking {{that he and the}} other officer were about to be taken hostage, intended to accelerate through the partially opened gates in a bid to escape. He was prevented from doing so when the gates were automatically shut. The other prison officers stationed at the forecourt gates had spotted the men on the roof, and assuming there was a prison escape in progress, activated the alarm system. The van was ten feet away from the gates when it came to a halt. Neither of the two prison officers inside the van was armed.|$|E

[...] The episode featured several uncredited celebrity cameos. During the premiere of the movie, Duchovny's Return to Me costars Minnie Driver and David Alan Grier appear as members of the audience.

500|$|During the two-month American tour, {{the band}} became {{increasingly}} unhappy, often venting frustrations on each other, leading to several physical confrontations. The band members were homesick; Albarn said, [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> miss really simple things ... I missed everything about England so I started writing songs which created an English atmosphere." [...] Upon the group's return to Britain, Blur (Albarn in particular) were {{upset by the}} success rival group Suede had achieved while they were gone. After a poor performance at a 1992 gig that featured a well-received set by Suede on the same bill, Blur {{were in danger of}} being dropped by Food. By that time, Blur had undergone an ideological and image shift intended to celebrate their English heritage in contrast to the popularity of American grunge bands like Nirvana. Although sceptical of Albarn's new manifesto for Blur, Balfe gave assent for the band's choice of Andy Partridge (of XTC) to produce their follow-up to Leisure. The sessions with Partridge proved unsatisfactory, but a chance reunion with Stephen Street resulted in him returning to produce the group.|$|E
500|$|Tyler had her {{breakthrough}} {{role in the}} art house film Stealing Beauty (1996), {{in which}} she played Lucy Harmon, an innocent, romantic teenager who travels to Tuscany, Italy, intent on losing her virginity. The film received generally mixed reviews, but Tyler's performance was regarded favorably by the critics. Variety wrote: [...] "Tyler is the perfect accomplice. At times sweetly awkward, at others composed and serene, the actress appears to respond effortlessly and intuitively to the camera, creating a rich sense of what Lucy is about that often is not explicit in the dialogue." [...] Empire noted, [...] "Liv Tyler (here radiantly resembling a ganglier young Ava Gardner) with {{a rare opportunity to}} enamour, a break she capitalizes on with composure." [...] The film was directed by Bernardo Bertolucci, who chose Tyler for the role after meeting with a number of young girls in Los Angeles, including Tyler's music video co-star Alicia Silverstone. Bertolucci said [...] "there was something missing in all of them". He later said that what he saw in Tyler was a gravitas he described as [...] "a New York aura". During promotion of the film, Tyler said she wanted to separate herself from the character during production: [...] "I tried my damnedest not to think of my own situation. But at one point, after a take, I <b>just</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> cry and cry. I remembered when I found out about my dad and how we just stared at each other from head to toe taking in every nook and cranny." ...|$|E
