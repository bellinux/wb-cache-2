5|$|If {{permanent}} brachytherapy is used, {{low dose}} radioactive sources (seeds) {{are left in}} the body after treatment – the radiation levels are very low and decrease over time. In addition, the irradiation only affects tissues within a few millimeters of the radioactive sources (i.e. the tumour being treated). As a precaution, some people receiving permanent brachytherapy may be advised to not hold any small children or be too close to pregnant women {{for a short time}} after treatment. Radiation oncologists or nurses can provide specific instructions to patients and advise for <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>they</b> need to be careful.|$|E

When their table is ready, users get a text message. Customers can also text back to say they’re running late, and restaurants can {{decide whether or not to}} hold the table for them.|$|E

5|$|The career mode {{is broken}} {{up into a}} dozen-some show sets, each set {{consisting}} of about 3-5 songs. The video for each set includes the band's introduction, banter between the band and crowd between songs, and final ovations on conclusion of the show. The player must unlock each set in order as to move forward. Once a set is complete, the player is shown the game's ranking of their performance and for each song, based on factors such as percentage of notes hit correctly, the longest streak of properly played consecutive notes, and <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>they</b> kept the virtual crowd excited about their performance. The player then unlocks the ability to play the individual songs outside of sets.|$|E
5|$|Attachment {{disorders}} tend {{to occur}} in a definable set of contexts such as within some types of institutions, {{in the presence of}} repeated changes of primary caregiver or of extremely neglectful identifiable primary caregivers who show persistent disregard for the child's basic attachment needs, but not all children raised in these conditions develop an attachment disorder. Studies undertaken on children from Eastern European orphanages from the mid-1990s showed significantly higher levels of both forms of RAD and of insecure patterns of attachment in the institutionalized children, regardless of <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>they</b> had been there. It would appear that children in institutions like these are unable to form selective attachments to their caregivers. The difference between the institutionalized children and the control group had lessened in the follow-up study three years later, although the institutionalized children continued to show significantly higher levels of indiscriminate friendliness. However, even among children raised in the most deprived institutional conditions the majority did not show symptoms of this disorder.|$|E
5|$|As in Forza Motorsport 3, {{there is}} a career mode for players to complete, which sees players racing at {{multiple}} locations around the world. This is known as World Tour Mode in Forza Motorsport 4, previously known as Season Play in Forza Motorsport 3. However, one new feature that appears in Forza Motorsport 4 is the game's ability to adapt the difficulty as the player progresses through the career, and collect a trend of data {{to see how well}} they perform. This allows AI drivers to change and upgrade their cars automatically to suit the player's driving abilities. There are several types of races besides the standard format. Forza Motorsport 4 includes the original bumper-to-bumper races, but also has drift, autocross, and multiple-heat races. Unlike in Forza Motorsport 3 where players had no choice over which car they received after leveling up, in Forza Motorsport 4 players are now able to choose one out of several cars as a prize, which are automatically upgraded to the high end of their class. Players are able to import their Forza Motorsport 3 profiles into Forza Motorsport 4. This gives them the ability to transfer a certain number of in-game credits and gifted cars into their new garage. The allowed number transferred is based on <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>they</b> have played the game and how many cars and credits they have. Players have the option to create car clubs and share cars in their garages within that club. Previous games in the series were limited to eight cars on the track, however Forza Motorsport 4 supports 16 player racing online, and two players offline.|$|E

25|$|Seven {{criteria}} {{measure the}} usability {{of different types}} of public transport and its overall appeal, although they overlap somewhat. The criteria are speed, comfort, safety, cost, proximity, timeliness and directness. Speed is calculated from total journey time including transfers. Proximity means how far passengers must walk or otherwise travel before they can begin the public transport leg of their journey and how close it leaves them to their desired destination. Timeliness is <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>they</b> must wait for the vehicle. Directness records how far a journey using public transport deviates from the shortest route.|$|E
25|$|Before 2005, donor lungs {{within the}} United States were {{allocated}} by the United Network for Organ Sharing on a first-come, first-served basis to patients on the transplant list. This {{was replaced by}} the current system, in which prospective lung recipients of age of 12 and older are assigned a lung allocation score or LAS, which takes into account various measures of the patient's health. The new system allocates donated lungs according to the immediacy of need rather than how long a patient has been on the transplant list. Patients who are under the age of 12 are still given priority based on <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>they</b> have been on the transplant waitlist. The length of time spent on the list is also the deciding factor when multiple patients have the same lung allocation score.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1950s, Muslim {{immigrants}} have emigrated to western countries {{in large numbers}} because fellow Muslim countries that are well-off economically and socially do not accept them. Out of the 57 Muslim majority countries, only two nations (Turkey and Malaysia) offer a formal path for immigrants to become naturalized citizens, regardless of birthplace, religious beliefs, marital status or ethnic origin. Even the oil-rich Gulf states do not grant citizenship to immigrants, regardless of <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>they</b> have resided in those countries. To make matters more difficult, Gulf states have stringent laws which explicitly state that an immigrant or expat can become a citizen only if his/her father was a citizen or, in some cases, if an expat woman marries an Arab national. These laws make it almost impossible for expats (both Muslim and non-Muslim) to gain citizenship.|$|E
