40|$|Using {{administrative}} {{records on}} Australian <b>income</b> <b>support</b> (welfare) recipients {{over the period}} July 1995 to June 2002, we examine dynamic properties of <b>income</b> <b>support</b> receipt and the personal characteristics associated with alternative patterns of receipt. We draw on three concepts: churning – the process of ending a spell on <b>income</b> <b>support</b> and subsequently commencing a new spell; transferring – moving from one payment-type to another within a spell on income support; and Total proportion of Time On <b>income</b> <b>support</b> (TTO) – the proportion of time on <b>income</b> <b>support</b> in a given period. We find that churning and transferring are significant features of <b>income</b> <b>support</b> receipt in Australia. For example, over half of recipients churn within five years of commencing an <b>income</b> <b>support</b> spell, and onefifth make a payment transfer within the same time frame. Examination of the characteristics associated with each of five distinct patterns of receipt reveals substantial differences in patterns by age, family composition, unemployment status, health status, and recent history of <b>income</b> <b>support</b> receipt. ...|$|R

Table  3 shows small numbers on Family Credit who have a labour market status of UE or NP which is inconsistent. In our econometric {{analysis}} we respect the observed data but because we assume that choices depend on levels of entitlements we will be unlikely to predict someone choosing a point of zero entitlement. Note that we treat <b>Income</b> <b>Support</b> as equivalent to non-transfer income; but some individuals who record themselves as UE or NP receive Unemployment Benefit (sometimes plus Housing Benefit) rather than <b>Income</b> <b>Support.</b> Unemployment Benefit is conditional on searching for work but is not actually means tested. Thus, single parents with some asset <b>income,</b> perhaps child <b>support</b> (although this was rather uncommon during this period), {{might be better off}} on Unemployment Benefit and Housing Benefit than on <b>Income</b> <b>Support.</b> Since we treat <b>Income</b> <b>Support</b> as equivalent to non-transfer income, and since <b>Income</b> <b>Support</b> and Unemployment Benefit are effectively interchangeable, since there was no obligation to search for this group, we treat Unemployment Benefit and <b>Income</b> <b>Support</b> as equivalent.|$|R

What difference would it make for environmental gain and farm <b>income</b> <b>support?</b> This report approaches the questions in two ways. First, spending patterns in existing commodity and conservation programs are analyzed {{to determine the extent}} to which producers who are currently receiving commodity payments also receive conservation payments. Then, a number of hypothetical program scenarios are devised and analyzed to estimate how emphasis on current <b>income</b> <b>support</b> recipients would differ from a combined program that focuses on achieving cost-effective environmental gain.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the historical basis of the Australian disability <b>income</b> <b>support</b> system from 1908 to 2007. Although designed as a safety net for people with a disability, the disability <b>income</b> <b>support</b> system within Australia has been highly targeted. The original eligibility criteria of "permanently incapacitated for work", medical criteria and later "partially capacitated for work" potentially contained ideological inferences that permeated across the time period. This represents an important area for study given the potential consequence for disability <b>income</b> <b>support</b> to marginalise people with a disability. Social policy and disability policy theorists, including Saunders (2007, Social Policy Research Centre [SPRC]) and Gibilisco (2003) have provided valuable insight {{into some of the}} effects of disability policy and poverty. Yet while these theorists argued for some form of <b>income</b> <b>support</b> they did not propose a specific form of income security for further exploration. Few studies have undertaken a comprehensive review of the history of disability <b>income</b> <b>support</b> within the Australian context. This thesis sought to redress these gaps by examining disability <b>income</b> <b>support</b> policy within Australia. The research design consisted of an in-depth critical historical-comparative policy analysis methodology. The use of critical historical-comparative policy analysis allowed the researcher to trace the construction of disability within the Australian disability <b>income</b> <b>support</b> policy across four major historical epochs. A framework was developed specifically to guide analysis of the data. The critical discourse analysis method helped to understand the underlying ideological dimensions that led to the predominance of one particular approach over another. Given this, the research purpose of the study centred on: i. Tracing the history of the Australian disability <b>income</b> <b>support</b> system. ii. Examining the historical patterns and ideological assumptions over time. iii. Exploring the historical patterns and ideological assumptions underpinning an alternative model (Basic Income) {{and the extent to which}} each model promotes the social citizenship of people with a disability. The research commitment to a social-relational ontology and the quest for social change centred on the idea that "there has to be a better way" in the provision of disability <b>income</b> <b>support.</b> This theme of searching for an alternative reality in disability <b>income</b> <b>support</b> policy resonated throughout the thesis. This thesis found that the Australian disability <b>income</b> <b>support</b> system is disabling in nature and generates categories of disability on the basis of ableness. From the study, ableness became a condition for citizenship. This study acknowledged that, in reality, <b>income</b> <b>support</b> provision reflects only one aspect of the disabling nature of society which requires redressing. Although there are inherent tensions in any redistributive strategy, the Basic Income model potentially provides an alternative to the Australian disability <b>income</b> <b>support</b> system, given its grounding in social citizenship. The thesis findings have implications for academics, policy-makers and practitioners in terms of developing better ways to understand disability constructs in disability <b>income</b> <b>support</b> policy. The thesis also makes a contribution in terms of promoting <b>income</b> <b>support</b> policies based on the rights of all people, not just a few...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{understand}} how social welfare secretaries within <b>income</b> <b>support</b> relate to user influence. We evaluated how to implement user influence within systems like <b>income</b> <b>support.</b> We based this study on the experiences of social welfare secretaries with regards to user influence and which possibilities and constraints they believe exist within the implementation of user influence. We chose to use a qualitative method with a hermeneutic approach and interviewed eight social welfare secretaries within the field of <b>income</b> <b>support.</b> The empirical material was interpreted by using Michel Lipsky's theory on Street-level bureaucracy and Michel Foucault's definition of power/knowledge and governmentality. The study came to show that the term user influence does not have one single definition, but several and provides possibilities for interpretation. The implementation of the concept of user influence depends on how it is being interpreted by the social welfare secretaries. Furthermore, within the field of <b>income</b> <b>support</b> there is a limited space for the users to have influence, but it is important to preserve that limited space. The outcome shows that user influence within <b>income</b> <b>support</b> is limited by the space for action and resources of the secretaries and organizations.
