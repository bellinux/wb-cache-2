5|$|In {{addition}} to the images and local elements applied in design, {{the capacity of the}} buildings, the nature of the space, the potential of the neighboring districts, the convenience of the traffic square, and the contrast of vertical and horizontal volumes of the buildings that constitute the skyline are all considered. The horizontal volume of the station is due to the conditions of the site, the functions, and development regulations. Therefore, the contrast created by the vertical volumes of the supporting structures can characterize the space and enhance the image of the architecture in the surroundings. The images of the supporting facilities are suggestive, and the image of the stations <b>is</b> <b>revealing.</b>|$|E
25|$|A heavily fictionalised story {{based on}} {{historical}} persons, the series explores the early life of Leonardo da Vinci during the Renaissance in Italy. He is an eccentric genius who {{has struggled to}} deal with his inner demons and unruly imagination, as he yearns for acceptance from his estranged father. Their sometimes antagonistic relationship results in Leonardo's working for the House of Medici. While doing so, he becomes embroiled in a political scheme to control Florence, as he hunts for a spy who <b>is</b> <b>revealing</b> information to the Catholic Church and the Pazzi family. He also begins an affair with Lucrezia Donati, Lorenzo de' Medici's mistress. The series depicts many of Leonardo's inventions and subsequent works as a military engineer for the Duke of Milan and the Borgias.|$|E
25|$|Alexandria {{was founded}} around a small, ancient Egyptian town c. 331 BC by Alexander the Great. It became an {{important}} center of the Hellenistic civilization and remained the capital of Hellenistic and Roman and Byzantine Egypt for almost 1000 years until the Muslim conquest of Egypt in AD 641, when a new capital was founded at Fustat (later absorbed into Cairo). Hellenistic Alexandria was {{best known for the}} Lighthouse of Alexandria (Pharos), one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World; its Great Library (the largest in the ancient world; now replaced by a modern one); and the Necropolis, one of the Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages. Alexandria was the second most powerful city of the ancient world after Rome. Ongoing maritime archaeology in the harbor of Alexandria, which began in 1994, <b>is</b> <b>revealing</b> details of Alexandria both before the arrival of Alexander, when a city named Rhacotis existed there, and during the Ptolemaic dynasty.|$|E

500|$|Freedom of Speech {{depicts a}} scene of a local town meeting in which Jim Edgerton, the lone {{dissenter}} to the town selectmen's announced {{plans to build a}} new school, was accorded the floor as a matter of protocol. The old school had burned down. Once he envisioned this scene to depict freedom of speech, Rockwell decided to use his Vermont neighbors as models for a Four Freedoms series. The blue-collar speaker wears a plaid shirt and suede jacket. He has dirty hands and a darker complexion than others in attendance. The other attendees are wearing white shirts, ties and jackets. Although one of the men is wearing a wedding band, the speaker is not. Edgerton's youth and workmanlike hands are fashioned with a worn and stained jacket, while the other attendees, appear to be older and more neatly and formally dressed. He is shown [...] "standing tall, his mouth open, his shining eyes transfixed, he speaks his mind, untrammeled and unafraid." [...] Edgerton is depicted in a way that resembles Abraham Lincoln. According to Bruce Cole of The Wall Street Journal, the closest figure in the painting <b>is</b> <b>revealing</b> a subject of the meeting as [...] "a discussion of the town's annual report". According to John Updike, the work is painted without any painterly brushwork. According to Robert Scholes, the work shows audience members in rapt attention with a sort of admiration of this lone speaker.|$|E
500|$|The Crows' {{insistence that}} reading is useless, even {{dangerous}} for Scarecrow because it only leads to discontentment takes on an especially haunting {{reminder of the}} ways in which the residues of slavery continue to injure contemporary African Americans. The Crows reinforce Scarecrow's subjection at their hands through a song whose refrain [...] "you can't win child, you can't get out of the game" [...] that aims to disabuse Scarecrow of any aspirations toward freedom... Their insistence that [...] "reading is stupid" [...] suggests that a Eurocentric education does not promise liberation from [...] "the game" [...] that race and racism create... The Crow's dismissal of education and western thought fails because they do not offer Scarecrow an alternative that will emancipate him. The Crow's attempt to discipline Scarecrow by displacing his hope with nihilism. For The Crow's so-called book of knowledge is less valuable than what they perceive to be real knowledge-street smarts. Though they are not tethered to a pole, they are seemingly unable or as their commandments and anthem suggests, unwilling to find opportunities than their present location provides. The Crow's chorus to Scarecrow's song <b>is</b> <b>revealing</b> for what it says about their loss of hope... The Crow's are even more disadvantaged than Scarecrow because, unlike him, they are hopeless. The Crow's chorus, like The Crow Commandments, reflects their disillusionment with their inability to realize the promise of upward mobility.|$|E

The courts have reviewed administrative determinations, and upheld many adverse ones, where the only supporting evidence has been reports of this kind, buttressed sometimes, but often not, by testimony of a medical adviser such as Dr. Leavitt. In these cases admissibility was [...] not contested, but the decisions do demonstrate traditional and ready acceptance of the written medical report in social security disability cases.|$|E

2500|$|In 1335, the French {{cardinal}} Jacques Fournier, {{a former}} Cistercian monk {{and the son}} of a miller, was elected and consecrated Pope Benedict XII. [...] The maxim attributed to him, [...] "the pope must be like Melchizedech who had no father, no mother, nor even a family tree", <b>is</b> <b>revealing</b> of his character. [...] Benedict was shy of personal power and was devoted exclusively to restoring the authority of the Church. [...] As a Cistercian, he had a notable theological background and, unlike his predecessor John XXII, he was a stranger to nepotism and scrupulous with his appointments. [...] He promulgated a series of regulations to restore the primitive spirit of the Cistercian Order.|$|E
2500|$|According to Turcotte and Parkin, other poll data {{reveal that}} [...] "in {{contrast}} to Francophones, Anglophones, in general, have resisted putting more government effort and resources into promoting bilingualism...

Opposition seems to be directed to {{the actions of the}} federal government, rather than to bilingualism itself... his distinction is key to understanding public opinion on the issue." [...] This helps to explain results that would otherwise seem contradictory, such as a 1994 poll in which 56% of Canadians outside Quebec indicated that they either strongly or moderately supported official bilingualism, but 50% agreed with a statement that [...] "the current official bilingualism policy should be scrapped because it's expensive and inefficient." ...|$|E
2500|$|There are {{numerous}} other faults (or fault zones) in the Puget Lowland, and around its edges, sketchily studied and largely unnamed. These are usually fairly short, and not {{believed to be}} significantly seismogenic. However, most seismic activity is not associated with any known fault. [...] Seismicity sometimes occurs in zones, such as has been observed under Mercer Island, or from downtown Seattle towards Kirkland but whether particular zones reflect undiscovered faults, or might {{be the source of}} damaging earthquakes, is generally unknown. Ongoing mapping <b>is</b> <b>revealing</b> more faults. E.g., mapping along the Rattlesnake Mountain Fault Zone has revealed a complex network of active or potentially active faults across (and likely beyond) the lower Snoqualmie Valley, including the Cherry Creek Fault Zone, scene of the 1996 M 5.3 Duvall earthquake.|$|E

2500|$|Gems {{were mostly}} cut by using {{abrasive}} powder from harder stones {{in conjunction with}} a hand-drill, probably often set in a lathe. Emery has been mined for abrasive powder on Naxos since antiquity. [...] Some early types of seal were cut by hand, rather than a drill, which does not allow fine detail. There is no evidence that magnifying lenses were used by gem cutters in antiquity. A medieval guide to gem-carving techniques survives from Theophilus Presbyter. Byzantine cutters used a flat-edged wheel on a drill for intaglio work, while Carolingian ones used round-tipped drills; it is unclear where they learnt this technique from. In intaglio gems at least, the recessed cut surface is usually very well preserved, and microscopic examination <b>is</b> <b>revealing</b> of the technique used. The colour of several gemstones can be enhanced by a number of artificial methods, using heat, sugar and dyes. Many of these can be shown to have been used since antiquity – since the 7th millennium BC in the case of heating.|$|E
2500|$|On July 25, 2014 Rep. Curt Clawson, a {{freshman}} Republican congressman from Florida, mistook Arun M.

He assured them that, as a U.S. representative, he would support all efforts to facilitate a better relationship between America and [...] "your country" [...] and [...] "your government." [...] Clawson continued on by heaping praise upon India while addressing Biswal and Kumar, apparently unaware of his confusion.Three days later, the incident was featured in Last Week Tonight by John Oliver; the clip of that show went viral and has recorded 3 million views. The incident lead to a wave of criticism across print, television & social media and the blogosphere. According to USA Today, Mr. Clawson later said, “I {{made a mistake in}} speaking before being fully briefed and I apologize. [...] I’m a quick study, but in this case I shot an air ball.” He was reported to have apologized to both Biswal and Kumar.

2500|$|In 1948 Charles Wisner Barrell {{argued that}} the [...] "Envoy", or postscript, to Thomas Edward's poem Narcissus (1595) {{identified}} the Earl of Oxford as Shakespeare. The Envoy uses allegorical nicknames in praising several Elizabethan poets, among them [...] "Adon". This is generally accepted to be an allusion to Shakespeare as the mythical Adonis from his poem Venus and Adonis. In the next stanzas, Edwards mentions a poet dressed [...] "in purple robes", [...] "whose power floweth far." [...] Since purple is, among other things, a symbol of aristocracy, most scholars accept that he is discussing an unidentified aristocratic poet. Barrell {{argued that the}} stanzas about Adon and the anonymous aristocrat must be seen together. He stated that Edwards <b>is</b> <b>revealing</b> that Adon (Shakespeare) is really the Earl of Oxford, forced by the Queen to use a pseudonym. Variations on Barrell's argument have been repeated by Diana Price and Roger Stritmatter. [...] James Rubenstein argues that the same passage points to Sir Henry Neville. Mainstream scholars assert that Edwards is discussing two separate poets, and {{it has also been}} suggested that (as in the final stanzas of Venus and Adonis) the purple refers to blood, with which his garments are [...] "distain'd", and that the poet could be Robert Southwell, under torture in the Tower of London.|$|E
