5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the native {{language}} of {{a significant part of the}} country's population is Russian, the language occupies a modest role in Israel's education system. Hebrew University started teaching Russian in 1962. In public schools, the first Russian-language classes were opened in the 1970s in large cities. The number of students enrolled <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>programs</b> dropped in the 1980s as immigration from the Soviet Union slowed down. In the 1990s, a Russian-language program carried out by local governments called Na'leh 16 included some 1,500 students. In 1997, about 120 schools in Israel taught Russian in one way or another.|$|E

40|$|Binary multirelations have {{received}} attention {{in recent years}} as a semantic domain of nondeterministic programming languages. Also, it is known that binary multirelations provide a model of Parikhâ€™s game logic. The iteration operator plays a central role <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>programming</b> languages and the logic, and it is natural that the iteration is ineterpreted as the reflexive transitive closure of a binary multirelation. We investigate constructions of the reflexive transitive closure among basic properties of up-closed binary multirelations. ...|$|R

25|$|The CAP concept {{seems to}} have been at least {{partially}} based on Marine pacification programs in Haiti, Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, and elsewhere, during the Banana Wars in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. <b>In</b> <b>these</b> <b>programs,</b> Marine units would pacify and administer regions, while providing training and security for local forces and villages. There are also connections to other pacification programs, such as the Philippine Insurrection.|$|E

Federal-state social welfare programs like Medicaid would be shifted from the mandatory section of the budget to the discretionary section, so that Congress would need to approve funding allocations each year.|$|E
25|$|Robert's Rules of Order is {{also used}} in Model United Nations conferences.

25|$|Each of the {{patients}} of VR went through 3 weeks, 5 days a week, of 30-minute intervals emerged <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>programs.</b> The controls went through the equivalent time in traditional rehabilitation therapies. Each patient took the star cancellation test, line bisection test, and Catherine Bergego Scale (CBS) 24 hours {{before and after the}} three-week treatment to assess the severity of unilateral spatial neglect. The VR group showed a higher increase in the star cancellation test and CBS scores after treatment than the control group (p<0.05), but both groups did not show any difference in the line bisection test and K-MBI before and after treatment. These results suggest that virtual reality programs can be more effective then conventional rehabilitation and thus should be further researched.|$|E
25|$|The Armstrong School District {{offers a}} wide variety of clubs, {{activities}} and an extensive junior high and high school sports program. In 2013, Armstrong School District spent over $1.5 million for activities (not including facilities costs or transportation). In 2014, Armstrong School District spent over $1.8 million for activities (not including facilities costs or transportation). The total revenue received by the district from all activities was only $107,500 in 2013. The district is especially challenged because it operates multiple high schools there by duplicating sports teams and the associated costs like coaches salaries, officials salaries, transportation, facilities and their maintenance, administration, uniforms and so on. Armstrong School Board determines eligibility policies to participate <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>programs.</b> When the planned high school and junior high school consolidation occurs in 2014-15, some duplicate teams will be eliminated.|$|E
