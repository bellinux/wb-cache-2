25|$|Laws {{regulating}} the discharge {{and treatment of}} sewage have led to dramatic nutrient reductions to surrounding ecosystems, but it is generally agreed that a policy regulating agricultural use of fertilizer and animal waste must be imposed. In Japan the amount of nitrogen produced by livestock is adequate to serve the fertilizer needs for the agriculture industry. Thus, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>unreasonable</b> to command livestock owners to clean up animal waste—which when left stagnant will leach into ground water.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>unreasonable</b> {{but also}} not {{necessary}} to conclude that Marcellus was a practicing physician. In his dissertation, the intellectual historian of magic and medicine Lynn Thorndike pronounced him the “court physician” of Theodosius I, but the evidence is thin: Libanius, if referring to this Marcellus, praises his ability to cure a headache. The prevailing view is that Marcellus should be categorized as a medical writer and not a physician. A translator of the medical writings of Isidore of Seville characterizes Marcellus as a “medical amateur” and dismisses the De medicamentis as “nothing {{more than the usual}} ancient home remedies,” and the historian of botany Ernst Meyer seems to have considered him a dilettante.|$|E

2500|$|Nonetheless, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>unreasonable</b> {{to suggest}} that the {{generation}} who followed the preceptors of the Revolution succeeded partly because they could formulate straightforward responses to Marxist economic theory. The most famous of these was that of Böhm-Bawerk, Zum Abschluss des Marxschen Systems (1896),"On the Closure of the Marxist System"], Staatswiss. Arbeiten. Festgabe für K. Knies (1896). but the first was Wicksteed's [...] "The Marxian Theory of Value. Das Kapital: a criticism" [...] (1884, followed by [...] "The Jevonian criticism of Marx: a rejoinder" [...] in 1885). Initially {{there were only a few}} Marxist responses to marginalism, of which the most famous were Rudolf Hilferding's Böhm-Bawerks Marx-Kritik (1904) and Politicheskoy ekonomni rante (1914) by Никола́й Ива́нович Буха́рин (Nikolai Bukharin). However, over the course of the 20th century a considerable literature developed on the conflict between marginalism and the labour theory of value, with the work of the neo-Ricardian economist Piero Sraffa providing an important critique of marginalism.|$|E
2500|$|Oral {{tradition}} in the Spokane area may give an entirely different account of this child. This tradition holds that, {{in the fall of}} 1853, John Mullan met and married Mary Ann Finley (or [...] "Finlay"), granddaughter of Jaco Finlay. Her age is unclear; she was born in either 1834 or 1836, making her either 19 or 17 years of age {{at the time of her}} marriage. She was one-half Native American. On June 9, 1855, Mary Ann died giving birth to a son, whom she named Peter Mullan. Historian Glen Adams argues that Peter Mullan was not John Mullan's child. Rather, a full-blood Native American probably impregnated Mary Ann, and that Peter is the boy whom John Mullan raised for a time. (Whether there was a John Mullan III in addition to Peter Mullan is not resolved by Adams.) Mullan biographers Louis C. Coleman and Leo Rieman examined much of the same evidence, and came to the same conclusions as Adams. Historian Keith Petersen, however, argues that it is plausible that Mullan fathered Peter Mullan. He argues that there is confusion over whether the mother was Mary Ann Finley or another woman, Rose Laurant. Laurant was Salish, and she may have lived with the Bitterroot Salish in 1853 when John Mullan was in the same area. Limited evidence in the oral tradition confuses Finley with Laurant, Petersen believes, and he concludes (a) that Peter Mullan is not the same person as John Mullan III, and (b) <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>unreasonable</b> to believe that Peter Mullan was John Mullan's biological son.|$|E

In 1780, however, he intimated to Dr. Price that he should be glad to establish Priestley on his Irish estates: the suggestion was interpreted, as Lord Shelburne probably intended it should be, and Priestley left him, the annuity of £150 a year, which had been promised in view of such a contingency, being punctually paid.|$|E
60|$|In {{the first}} place, {{although}} {{the surrender of}} the feudal privileges (on a motion seconded by a nobleman of great rank) was the occasion of a sentimental scene, I {{see no reason to}} doubt, but on the contrary, many reasons to believe, that some of these privileges had been used to the frightful oppression of the peasant, quite as near to the time of the Revolution as the doctor's narrative, which, you will remember, dates long before the Terror. And surely when the new philosophy was the talk of the salons and the slang of the hour, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>unreasonable</b> or unallowable to suppose a nobleman wedded to the old cruel ideas, and representing the time going out, as his nephew represents the time coming in; as to the condition of the peasant in France generally at that day, I take it that if anything be certain on earth it is certain that it was intolerable.

60|$|From what is {{recorded}} of the infancy of Chatterton, {{parents may be}} satisfied that an inaptness to learn in childhood, {{is far from being}} a prognostic of future dullness. At the age of five years, he was sent to the school of which his father had been master, and was found so incorrigibly stupid, that he was rejected by the teacher, whose name was Love, as incapable of profiting by his instruction. His mother, as most mothers would have done in the like case, bitterly lamented her son's untowardness; when an old musical manuscript in French coming in his way, he fell in love, as she expressed it, with the illuminated capitals. Of this fancy she eagerly availed herself to lead him on to an acquaintance with the alphabet; and from hence proceeded to teach him to read in an old Testament or Bible in the black letter.
