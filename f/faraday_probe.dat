40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method for analyzing near-field <b>Faraday</b> <b>probe</b> {{data obtained from}} Hall thrusters. Traditional methods spawned from far-field <b>Faraday</b> <b>probe</b> analysis rely on assumptions that are not applicable to near-field <b>Faraday</b> <b>probe</b> data. In particular, arbitrary choices for the point of origin and limits of integration have made interpretation of the results difficult. The new method, called iterative pathfinding, uses {{the evolution of the}} near-field plume with distance to provide feedback for determining the location of the point of origin. Although still susceptible to the choice of integration limits, this method {{presents a}} systematic approach to determining the origin point for calculating the divergence angle. The iterative pathfinding method is applied to near-field <b>Faraday</b> <b>probe</b> data taken in a previous study from the NASA- 300 M and NASA- 457 Mv 2 Hall thrusters. Since these two thrusters use centrally mounted cathodes the current density associated with the cathode plume is removed before applying iterative pathfinding. A procedure is presented for removing the cathode plume. The results of the analysis are compared to far-field probe analysis results. This paper ends with checks on the validity of the new method and discussions on the implications of the results...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} a magnetically {{filtered}} <b>Faraday</b> <b>probe</b> (MFFP) to obtain the ion current density profile of a Hall thruster is investigated. The MFFP is designed to eliminate the collection of low-energy, charge-exchange (CEX) ions by using a variable magnetic field as an ion filter. In this study, a MFFP, <b>Faraday</b> <b>probe</b> with a reduced acceptance angle (BFP), and nude <b>Faraday</b> <b>probe</b> are {{used to measure the}} ion current density profile of a 5  kW 5 kW Hall thruster operating over the range of 300 – 500  V 300 – 500 V and 5 – 10  mg/s 5 – 10 mg∕s. The probes are evaluated on a xenon propellant Hall thruster in the University of Michigan Large Vacuum Test Facility at operating pressures within the range of 4. 4 × 10 − 4  Pa 4. 4 × 10 − 4 Pa Xe (3. 3 × 10 − 6  Torr 3. 3 × 10 − 6 Torr Xe) to 1. 1 × 10 − 3  Pa 1. 1 × 10 − 3 Pa Xe (8. 4 × 10 − 6  Torr 8. 4 × 10 − 6 Torr Xe) in order to study the ability of the <b>Faraday</b> <b>probe</b> designs to filter out CEX ions. Detailed examination of the results shows that the nude probe measures a greater ion current density profile than both the MFFP and BFP over the range of angular positions investigated for each operating condition. The differences between the current density profiles obtained by each probe are attributed to the ion filtering systems employed. Analysis of the results shows that the MFFP, operating at a + 5  A+ 5 A solenoid current, provides the best agreement with flight-test data and across operating pressures...|$|E

Langmuir probe measurements are {{taken in the}} near-field plasma surrounding a nude <b>Faraday</b> <b>probe,</b> which is located 1 m from the exit plane of the University of Michigan/U. S. Air Force Research Laboratory P 5 Hall thruster. The thruster is operated at an anode flow rate of 5. 30 mg/s, at backpressures of 1. 5 × 10 − 3 Pa (1. 1 × 10 − 5 torr) and 4. 8 × 10 − 4 Pa (3. 6 × 10 − 6 torr), corrected for xenon. The effect of the facility backpressure is clearly seen in {{the wings of the}} plume. A combination of charge-exchange collisions and vacuum chamber gas ingestion into the thruster {{is believed to be the}} cause of this phenomenon. The Langmuir probe results indicate that the electric fields near the nude <b>Faraday</b> <b>probe</b> are functions of facility backpressure and the angle from the thruster centerline. The plasma potential measured within 20 mm of the probe varied by no more than 3 V. Thus, the electric fields near the nude <b>Faraday</b> <b>probe</b> are not large enough to explain the increased collection of charge-exchange ions at elevated facility background pressures and large angles from the thruster centerline...|$|E

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of collimated Faraday probes in obtaining the ion current density profile in Hall thrusters is investigated. A collimated probe design is attractive {{because it offers}} the possibility of obtaining the true ion current density profile regardless of the facility pumping speed. The collimator is intended to act primarily as a filter for low energy ions introduced in the plume by charge exchange collisions. Experiments were conducted using a traditional nude <b>Faraday</b> <b>probe</b> and a collimated probe.

40|$|Ion {{current density}} and {{electron}} number density profiles were {{measured in the}} very-nearfield plume of a 1. 35 kW stationary plasma thruster (SPT- 100). In order to take these measurements without significantly disturbing plasma flow while data were collected, a small <b>Faraday</b> <b>probe</b> and a single Langmuir probe were constructed and used with high-speed electronics for fast spatial sweeps. The data showed that there were distinct peaks in ion current density and electron number density related {{to the position of}} the thruster discharge chamber exit in the very-near-field plume. These peaks decreased and broadened as the axial position from the thruster exit increased. The <b>Faraday</b> <b>probe</b> data showed that a diverging annular ion beam came out of the discharge chamber. The inner boundary converged at or near 100 mm downstream of the exit plane.

40|$|Abstract: A <b>Faraday</b> <b>probe</b> {{with three}} {{concentric}} rings {{was designed and}} fabricated to assess the effects of gap width and probe geometry in a systematic study of the Hall thruster plume. The nested <b>Faraday</b> <b>probe</b> consisted of two concentric collector rings and an outer guard ring, which enabled simultaneous current density measurements on {{the inner and outer}} collector. Two versions of the outer collector were fabricated to create 0. 5 mm or 1. 5 mm gaps between the rings. Current density distribution of a Hall thruster ion source were studied at 8, 12, 16, and 20 thruster diameters downstream of the exit plane with four probe configurations at background pressures of 3 x 10 - 6, 1 x 10 - 5, and 3 x 10 - 5 torr. Several correction factors are proposed to account for the effective probe collection area and systematic measurement error associated with measuring an annular device as a point source. These corrections enable the investigation of beam expansion and ion migration from the central core, and result in a highly accurate estimate of divergence in the Hall thruster plume. Application of the correction factors and characterization of facility effects are shown to decrease the calculated beam current by 10 - 20 % compared to conventional analysis and reduce measurement uncertainty to ± 3 %...|$|E

40|$|Electric {{propulsion}} devices, including ion thrusters and Hall thrusters, {{are becoming}} increasingly popular for long duration space missions. Ground-based experimental testing of such devices is performed in vacuum chambers, which develop an unavoidable background gas due to pumping limitations and facility leakage. Besides directly altering the operating environment, the background gas may indirectly affect the performance of immersed plasma probe diagnostics. This work focuses on computational modeling research conducted to evaluate {{the performance of a}} current-collecting <b>Faraday</b> <b>probe.</b> Initial findings from one dimensional analytical models of plasma sheaths are used as reference cases for subsequent modeling.

40|$|During {{the early}} {{development}} stages of Hall thruster technology, plasma research and propulsion advancements centered primarily on 300 -V, 1600 -s specific impulse operation. Since the first Hall thruster firing on a Soviet satellite in 1972, extensive {{investigations of the}} plasmadynamic discharge phenomena and operating characteristics progressed the propulsion concept to {{a high level of}} performance suitable {{for a wide range of}} near-earth maneuvers and interplanetary missions. The expanded performance envelope is primarily a function of improvements in thruster lifetime, thermal margin, discharge stability, and power system capability. Advancements in Hall thruster propulsion systems enable a wider range of input parameters to the thruster, including the applied anode-to-cathode potential. Operation in the low discharge voltage regime is associated with a decline in total thruster efficiency. This dissertation is intended to investigate low-voltage Hall thruster physics, identify dominant performance loss mechanisms, and determine the discharge characteristics that drive efficiency. A systematic, experimental investigation of low-voltage Hall thruster performance and plume properties led to the conclusion that reduced electron temperature in the discharge was correlated with diminished Joule heating losses and a lower ionization cost per beam ion. However, the reduced electron temperature also decreased the ionization rate coefficient, and corresponded to an escalation of electron current to the anode to sustain ionization processes. In addition, divergence of the kinetic ion jet limited the component of axially directed thrust and reduced the total thruster efficiency. Two jet-mode Hall thruster operating regimes were discovered for low-voltage operation, corresponding to ionization instabilities in the discharge and additional electron current to the anode. These modes are methodically characterized and potential causes are hypothesized. During the course of this research, corollary studies on <b>Faraday</b> <b>probe</b> design, facility effects, and data analysis techniques improved accuracy of current density profiles and far-field plume properties. <b>Faraday</b> <b>probe</b> uncertainty is difficult to quantify, and therefore is often employed for qualitative analysis of electric propulsion plumes.

However, the necessary asymmetric location of the discharge cathode away from thruster centerline could potentially lead to non-uniformities in the discharge not present in conventional geometry ion thrusters. In an effort to characterize the degree of this potential non-uniformity, a number of current density measurements were taken on a breadboard AGI-Engine.

Plume measurements were taken with a <b>Faraday</b> <b>probe</b> and a Retarding Potential Analyzer at various background pressures to correlate changes in current density and ion energy distribution with changes in pressure. Results showed that current density increases linearly with background pressure at any given angle. This linear relationship was used to extrapolate laboratory measurements to zero background pressure, the in-orbit condition. Measurements from the <b>Faraday</b> <b>probe</b> and the Retarding Potential Analyzer were compared to ensure consistency. The effect of discharge voltage on plume divergence was also investigated. Measurements from both probes revealed that plume divergence decreases with an increase in discharge voltage. Hall thruster plume expansion was also characterized using a numerical plume simulation. Comparison of plume simulation results for in-orbit conditions to extrapolated current density at zero pressure demonstrated good agreement. (cont.) However, comparison of plume simulation and experimental results at a non-zero background pressure showed deficiencies in the collision model of the plume simulation. An analytical expression for current density obtained using a elf-similar plume model was compared to extrapolated current density at zero pressure and showed good agreement. In addition, an analytical model derived for current density of source ion collisions with neutrals was consistent with experimental measurements and confirms the deficiencies in the simulation's collision model. In summary, experimental, numerical and analytical results indicate that the method of determining in-orbit plume divergence from laboratory measurements is valid and can be used to integrate Hall thrusters with the spacecraft. by Yassir Azziz.

40|$|In {{order to}} aid in the design of {{high-power}} Hall thrusters and provide experimental validation for existing modeling efforts, plasma potential and Langmuir probe measurements were performed in the near-field plume of the NASA 300 M Hall thruster. A probe array consisting of a <b>Faraday</b> <b>probe,</b> Langmuir probe, and emissive probe was used to interrogate the plume from approximately 0. 1 - 2. 0 DT,m downstream of the thruster exit plane at four operating conditions: 300 V, 400 V, and 500 V at 20 kW as well as 300 V at 10 kW. Results show that the acceleration zone and high-temperature region were contained within 0. 3 DT,m from the exit plane at all operating conditions. Isothermal lines were shown to strongly follow magnetic field lines in the nearfield, with maximum temperatures ranging from 19 - 27 eV. The electron temperature spatial distribution created large drops in measured floating potentials in front of the magnetic pole surfaces where the plasma density was small, which suggests strong sheaths at these surfaces. The data taken have provided valuable information for future design and modeling validation, and complements ongoing internal measurement efforts on the NASA 300 M...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Quantum {{metrology}} uses quantum {{features such}} as entanglement and squeezing to improve the sensitivity of quantum-limited measurements. Long established as a valuable technique in optical measurements such as gravitational-wave detection, quantum metrology is increasingly being applied to atomic instruments such as matter-wave interferometers, atomic clocks, and atomic magnetometers. Several of these new applications involve dual optical/atomic quantum systems, presenting both new challenges and new opportunities. Here we describe an optical magnetometry system that achieves both shot-noise-limited and projection-noise-limited performance, allowing study of optical magnetometry in a fully-quantum regime [1]. By near-resonant <b>Faraday</b> rotation <b>probing,</b> we demonstrate measurement-based spin squeezing in a magnetically-sensitive atomic ensemble [2 – 4]. The versatility of this system allows us also to design metrologically-relevant optical nonlinearities, and to perform quantum-noise-limited measurements with interacting photons. As a first interaction-based measurement [5], we implement a non-linear metrology scheme proposed by Boixo et al. with the surprising feature of precision scaling better than the 1 /N “Heisenberg limit ” [6]. 1...|$|R
40|$|Planar {{squeezed}} states, i. e. quantum {{states which}} are squeezed in two orthogonal spin components, have recently attracted attention {{due to their}} applications in atomic interferometry and quantum information [Q. Y. He et al, New J. Phys. 14, 093012 (2012) ]. While canonical variables such as quadratures of the radiation field can be squeezed in at most one component, simultaneous squeezing in two orthogonal spin components can be achieved due to the angular momentum commutation relations. We present a novel scheme for planar squeezing via quantum non-demolition (QND) measurements in spin- 1 systems. The QND measurement is achieved via near-resonant paramagnetic <b>Faraday</b> rotation <b>probing,</b> and the planar squeezing is obtained by sequential QND measurement of two orthogonal spin components. We compute the achievable squeezing {{for a variety of}} optical depths, initial conditions, and probing strategies. The planar squeezed states generated in this way contain entanglement detectable by spin-squeezing inequalities and give an advantage relative to non-squeezed states for any precession phase angle, a benefit for single-shot and high-bandwidth magnetometry.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with characterising the plume expansion in the magnetic nozzle of a helicon thruster. The investigation {{took place in the}} context of the new electric propulsion laboratory of the Space Propulsion & Plasmas Group (EP 2) of University Carlos III of Madrid (UC 3 M) and the testcampaign of the helicon plasma thruster HPT 05 prototype that is a joint project of SENER and EP 2. The magnetic nozzle is a new plasma acceleration concept that can be used on several different electric thrusters. The helicon plasma thruster is a new type of electric thruster that aims to achieve high thrust density by using a helicon plasma source. The focus of this work is threefold: development, testing and application of electrostatic probe diagnostics for the EP 2 lab; characterising the plume expansion and comparison to DiMagNo (magnetic nozzle model) simulations. Some figures of merit about the helicon thruster performance are estimated along the way. The diagnostics used in this thesis are simple and RF-compensated Langmuir <b>probes,</b> <b>Faraday</b> <b>probes</b> and emissive probes. Langmuir probe measurements were found useful for inferring the plasma density and providing the electron temperature which were found to be of the order of 〖 10 〗^ 16 -〖 10 〗^ 18 m^(- 3) and 3 - 5 eV respectively. RF-compensated probes could not be verified correctly as in the low plasma densities of n 650 W) the observed behaviour was isothermal. The plume divergence half angle was found to remain constant downstream (> 120 mm) indicating ion detachment from the magnetic fields lines. This was further corroborated by the downstream increase of the ratio of ion to magnetic flux. The presence of the magnetic nozzle significantly improved the plume divergence, decreasing the divergence half-angle with 7 °. The axial evolution of measured plasma parameters in the plume were compared to the DiMagNo simulation for the nominal (500 W) case, which showed overall good agreement of ion Mach number, plasma potential, ion current density and plasma density 1. Including the polytropic model for electron thermodynamics into DiMagNo was necessary to achieve agreement between simulation and measurement of the ion Mach number. Results were also compared to results from similar thrusters found in literature and good agreement was found particularly with Takahashi [80] and Little [49, 50]. This work helped develop the diagnostic capabilities of the EP 2 electric propulsion lab and paved the way for future experiments on magnetic nozzles and validation of the DiMagNo code.
