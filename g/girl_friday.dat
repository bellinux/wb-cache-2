5|$|The best decade for January movies, Burr writes, {{may well}} have been the 1940s. It began with what he {{suggests}} was best January in cinema history. The Grapes of Wrath, His <b>Girl</b> <b>Friday</b> and The Shop Around the Corner, all considered classics, were released in January 1940. Later in the decade, other classic films would first reach screens during January, such as Sullivan's Travels, Shadow of a Doubt and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.|$|E

50|$|Boys and <b>Girls</b> <b>Friday</b> was {{broadcast}} in a Friday mid-evening 30-minute slot and was principally a 'fly on the wall' format (introduced and narrated by Anderson) in which cameras would follow each week's winners during their {{week in the}} apartment as they undertook their shopping challenges. Edited highlights from this programme would be shown when the contestants returned to the studio the following day for the endgame.|$|R

This 'shopping challenge' would be filmed through the week for broadcast on Boys and <b>Girls</b> <b>Friday</b> (see below). Any money not spent during the shopping challenge would be forfeited.|$|R
5|$|The {{arrival of}} sound film {{created a new}} job market for writers of screen dialogue. Many {{newspaper}} journalists moved to California and became studio-employed screenwriters. This resulted {{in a series of}} fast-talking comedy pictures featuring newsmen. The Front Page, later re-made as the much less cynical and more sentimental post-Code His <b>Girl</b> <b>Friday</b> (1940), was adapted from the Broadway play by Chicago newsmen, and Hollywood screenwriters, Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur. It was based on Hecht's experiences working as a reporter for the Chicago Daily Journal.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, Hawks {{returned}} to the screwball comedy genre with His <b>Girl</b> <b>Friday,</b> starring Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell. The film was an adaptation of the hit Broadway play The Front Page by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur, which had already been made into a film in 1931 and had also been reworked by the same screenwriters and transplanted to Rudyard Kipling's India for Gunga Din in 1939. In 1941, Hawks made Sergeant York, starring Gary Cooper as a pacifist farmer who becomes a decorated World War I soldier. This was the highest-grossing film of 1941 and won two Academy Awards (Best Actor and Best Editing), as well as earning Hawks his only nomination for Best Director. Later that year, Hawks worked with Cooper again for Ball of Fire, which also starred Barbara Stanwyck. The film was written by Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett and is a playful take on Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Cooper plays a sheltered, intellectual linguist who is writing an encyclopedia with six other scientists, and hires street-wise Stanwyck {{to help them with}} modern slang terms. In 1941, Hawks began work on the Howard Hughes-produced (and later directed) film The Outlaw, based on the life of Billy the Kid and starring Jane Russell. Hawks completed initial shooting of the film in early 1941, but due to perfectionism and battles with the Hollywood Production Code, Hughes continued to re-shoot and re-edit the film until 1943, when it was finally released with Hawks uncredited as director.|$|E
25|$|Among the better-known films {{he helped}} write without being {{credited}} are Gone with the Wind, The Shop Around the Corner, Foreign Correspondent, His <b>Girl</b> <b>Friday</b> (the second {{film version of}} his play The Front Page), The Sun Also Rises, Mutiny on the Bounty, Casino Royale (1967), and The Greatest Show on Earth.|$|E

25|$|Bogdanovich {{followed}} up The Last Picture Show {{with the popular}} comedy What's Up, Doc? (1972), starring Barbra Streisand and Ryan O'Neal, a screwball comedy indebted to Hawks's Bringing Up Baby (1938) and His <b>Girl</b> <b>Friday</b> (1940). Despite his reliance on homage to bygone cinema, Bogdanovich solidified his status {{as one of a}} new breed of A-list directors that included Academy Award winners Francis Ford Coppola and William Friedkin, with whom he formed The Directors Company. The Directors Company was a generous production deal with Paramount Pictures that essentially gave the directors carte blanche if they kept within budget limitations. It was through this entity that Bogdanovich's Paper Moon (1973) was produced.|$|E

500|$|Hawks was a {{versatile}} director whose career included comedies, dramas, gangster films, science fiction, film noir, and westerns. His most popular films include Scarface (1932), [...] Bringing Up Baby (1938), Only Angels Have Wings (1939), His <b>Girl</b> <b>Friday</b> (1940), To Have and Have Not (1944), The Big Sleep (1946), Red River (1948), The Thing from Another World (1951), and Rio Bravo (1959).

500|$|In 1940, Grant {{played a}} callous {{newspaper}} editor who learns that his ex-wife and former journalist, played by Rosalind Russell, is to marry an insurance {{officer in the}} comedy His <b>Girl</b> <b>Friday,</b> which was praised for its strong chemistry and [...] "great verbal athleticism" [...] between Grant and Russell. Grant reunited with Irene Dunne in My Favorite Wife, a [...] "first rate comedy" [...] according to Life magazine, which became RKO's second biggest picture of the year, with profits of $505,000. [...] After playing a Virginian backwoodsman in the American Revolution-set The Howards of Virginia, which McCann considers to have been Grant's worst film and performance, his last film {{of the year was}} in the critically lauded romantic comedy The Philadelphia Story, in which he played the ex-husband of Hepburn's character. Grant felt his performance was so strong that he was bitterly disappointed not to have received an Oscar nomination, and joked [...] "I'd have to blacken my teeth first before the Academy will take me seriously".|$|E
500|$|Grant often poked fun {{at himself}} with {{statements}} such as, [...] "Everyone {{wants to be}} Cary Grant—even I want to be Cary Grant", and in ad-lib lines—such as in the film His <b>Girl</b> <b>Friday</b> (1940), saying, [...] "Listen, the last man who {{said that to me}} was Archie Leach, just a week before he cut his throat." [...] In Arsenic and Old Lace (1944), a gravestone is seen bearing the name Archie Leach. According to a famous story now believed to be fictional, after seeing a telegram from a magazine editor to his agent asking, [...] "How old Cary Grant?", Grant reportedly responded, [...] "Old Cary Grant fine. How you?" [...] Despite his strong comedic qualities, Alfred Hitchcock thought that Grant was also very effective in playing darker roles, with a mysterious, dangerous quality, remarking that [...] "there is a frightening side to Cary that no one can quite put their finger on". Wansell notes that this darker, mysterious side extended to his personal life, which he took great lengths to cover up to retain his debonair image.|$|E

500|$|Born in Horfield, Bristol, Grant became {{attracted}} to theatre {{at a young}} age, and began performing with a troupe known as [...] "The Penders" [...] {{from the age of}} six. After attending Bishop Road Primary School and Fairfield Grammar School in Bristol, he toured the country as a stage performer, and decided to stay in New York City after a performance there. He established a name for himself in vaudeville in the 1920s and toured the United States before moving to Hollywood in the early 1930s. He initially appeared in crime films or dramas such as Blonde Venus (1932) and She Done Him Wrong (1933), but later gained renown for his appearances in romantic comedy and screwball comedy films such as The Awful Truth (1937), Bringing Up Baby (1938), His <b>Girl</b> <b>Friday</b> (1940) and The Philadelphia Story (1940). Along with the later Arsenic and Old Lace (1944) and I Was a Male War Bride (1949); these films are frequently cited as among the all-time great comedy films. Having established himself as a major Hollywood star, he was nominated twice for the Academy Award for Best Actor, for Penny Serenade (1941) and None but the Lonely Heart (1944).|$|E
500|$|Among major {{metropolitan}} weeklies, David Edelstein of New York magazine called the film [...] "a shapely piece of mythmaking [...] Favreau doesn't {{go in for}} stylized comic-book frames, {{at least in the}} first half. He gets real with it – you'd think you were watching a military thriller", while conversely, David Denby of The New Yorker put forth a negative review, claiming [...] "a slightly depressed, going-through-the-motions feel to the entire show [...] Gwyneth Paltrow, widening her eyes and palpitating, can't do much with an antique role as Stark's <b>girl</b> <b>Friday,</b> who loves him but can't say so; Terrence Howard, playing a military man who chases around after Stark, looks dispirited and taken for granted". IGN's Todd Gilchrist recognized Downey as [...] "the best thing" [...] in a film that [...] "functions on autopilot, providing requisite story developments and character details to fill in this default 'origin story' while the actors successfully breathe life into their otherwise conventional roles". Noting the cultural elements of the film, Cristobal Giraldez Catalan of Bright Lights Film Journal wrote, [...] "Iron Man is far more than playboy fantasy; it is American foreign policy realized without context [...] with narrative and directorial precision, once again provides the high-fidelity misogyny and anti-Muslim rhetoric Hollywood is known for." ...|$|E
500|$|Brian Lowry, {{reviewing}} the two-part premiere for Variety, felt that giving Atwell her own television series was [...] "a pretty smart bet" [...] by Marvel, {{and he called}} the episodes [...] "considerable fun". He noted the period setting as contributing to this, and positively mentioned the score by composer Christopher Lennertz. Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly felt that [...] "the show isn't as retro-stylish as it thinks it is ... the first hour of Agent Carter feels like an above-average episode of Young Indiana Jones Chronicles", noting that it tonally aims for His <b>Girl</b> <b>Friday,</b> Dick Tracy, and Alias ("A tough tonal mixture on a weekly broadcast budget, but also an ambition worth pursuing"), but praised Atwell's performance, calling her [...] "a delight" [...] and [...] "firing on all cylinders". Franich was negative about what he saw to be common MCU tropes, notably [...] "Somebody named Stark invented something dangerous; everyone wants an All-Important Glowing Thing; there's an implicit promise that nothing will be solved for weeks/years to come." [...] Though he was wary about the series being forced {{to contribute to the}} rest of the MCU, he did note that [...] "Agent Carter feels pleasantly segmented off from the greater Marvel Machinery".|$|E

500|$|The Coen {{brothers}} {{first met}} Sam Raimi when Joel Coen {{worked as an}} assistant editor on Raimi's The Evil Dead (1981). Together, they began writing the script for The Hudsucker Proxy in 1981, and continued during the filming of Crimewave (1985), and post-production on Blood Simple (1985), in which Joel and Ethan Coen shared a house with Raimi. The Coens and Raimi were inspired by the films of Preston Sturges, such as Christmas in July (1940) and the Hollywood satire, Sullivan's Travels (1941). The sentimental tone and decency of ordinary men as heroes was influenced by films of Frank Capra, like Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936), Meet John Doe (1941), and It's a Wonderful Life (1946). The dialogue is an homage to Howard Hawks' His <b>Girl</b> <b>Friday</b> (1940), while Jennifer Jason Leigh's performance as fast-talking reporter Amy Archer is reminiscent of Rosalind Russell and Katharine Hepburn, in both the physical and vocal mannerisms. Other movies that observers found references to include Executive Suite (1954) and Sweet Smell of Success (1957). The brothers had no intention commenting on or parodying such movies, instead as Ethan said [...] " [...] It's the case where, having seen those movies, we say ' They're really fun - let's do one; as opposed to 'They're really fun- let's comment upon them." [...] Raimi describes the script as [...] " [...] "big-business comedy. It's {{a return to the}} very large love story comedies they used to make in the forties and early fifties." [...] So the brothers started to pace around their apartment, taking turns on the typewriter, and when they found themselves stuck at a point, Raimi would do all sorts of tricks to get the boys back up. For example, while Ethan is pacing around, he would move things around the apartment so Ethan would be thrown off, he even said he threw firecrackers at them.|$|E
