I use textures when I do records and I just wanted her voice texture on this record, and she really made this song. Now she's been complaining saying she's been taken off the record, I don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>that</b> came from.

[...] "It was a lot of actresses. The True Blood actress, I don't know that she was even available; I think she's still on True Blood.

[...] Mars pleaded guilty to felony drug possession and in return was told that the charges would be erased from his criminal record as long as he stayed out of trouble for a year.

500|$|People {{are always}} {{using the word}} Illuminati but they're always {{referencing}} it in an incorrect way. People often accuse me of {{being a member of}} the Illuminati and I think in today's pop culture the Illuminati is perceived as a group of powerful, successful people who are working behind the scenes to control the universe. Not people with consciousness, not people who are enlightened. So people were accusing me of {{being a member of the}} Illuminati, and I kept going, wait—so first I had to figure out what that meant...I know who the real Illuminati are, and I <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>that</b> word comes from. The real Illuminati were a group of scientists, artists, philosophers, writers, who came about in what is referred to as the Age of Enlightenment, after the Dark Ages, when there was no writing and no art and no creativity and no spirituality, and life was really at a standstill. And right after that, everything flourished. So we had people like Shakespeare and Leonardo Da Vinci and Michaelangelo and Isaac Newton, and all these great minds and great thinkers, and they were called Illuminati...It had nothing to do with money and power. Of course they were powerful, because they influenced people. But their goal was to inspire and enlighten. So when people refer to me as a member of the Illuminati, I always want to say thank you. Thank you for putting me in that category.|$|E

500|$|In [...] "The Born-Again Identity", it's {{revealed}} that Castiel survived. After the Leviathans left him, {{he made his}} way out of the river, naked, and ran into his future wife Daphne. However, the experience renders Castiel amnesic, but with his angelic powers intact. Going by the name [...] "Emanuel", Castiel used his powers to heal people, though he didn't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>that</b> ability and his power to see demon's true faces came from. After Sam is committed to a mental hospital as a result of the hallucinations of Lucifer he is suffering due to Castiel breaking his [...] "mental wall", Dean searches for [...] "Emanuel" [...] and kills a demon that is holding his wife hostage. Castiel agrees to help Dean who doesn't tell him who he really is, but mentions what [...] "Cas" [...] had done to Sam. The two are joined by Meg, but upon reaching the hospital, find demons surrounding the entrance. As Castiel is the only one who can take them all down, Dean is forced to tell him the truth about who he really is and insists he has the power to kill the demons. Castiel manages to summon his power to kill demons and kills all of them, but doing so restores his memories. Castiel shows remorse for his previous actions and initially wants to leave, but Dean is able to convince him to help by giving him back his trench coat. Castiel finds Sam in time to save him from a demon torturing him to death with electro-shock therapy and tries to restore his mental wall, but can't as it's completely gone. Feeling sorry for what he had done, Castiel transfers the problem to himself and is haunted by visions of Lucifer like Sam was. Castiel is committed to the mental hospital, but is safe from the demons as only Meg knows he's alive and she takes a job at the hospital, presumably to look after him. In [...] "Party On, Garth", Dean calls Meg and she reveals that Castiel's in the same condition, which Sam feels guilty about.|$|E

It also concerns me that once the pork barrel is filled, suddenly the Church of Scientology, the Jehovah Witnesses , the various and many denominations and religious groups—and I don't say those words in a pejorative way—begin applying for money—and I don't see how any can be turned down because of their radical and unpopular views.

2500|$|Soon afterwards, Clarke {{joined up}} with blues singer Alison Moyet to form Yazoo (or Yaz in the United States).

Clarke, however, denied {{in an interview}} that such an offer ever took place saying, [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>that</b> came from. That's not true."

2500|$|On December 28, 2015, ESPN {{announced}} that they had reached an agreement with CBS and the NFL to provide a dedicated Spanish-language broadcast of Super Bowl 50, airing on ESPN Deportes and streaming on WatchESPN, featuring commentary and surrounding coverage in the language; unlike Fox and NBC, CBS {{does not have a}} Spanish-language cable network that could have carried such a broadcast. The production utilized CBS's video, but with Spanish-language graphics provided by ESPN, and its Monday Night Football commentary crew of Alvaro Martin, Raul Allegre, and sideline reporter John Sutcliffe. ESPN Deportes broadcast pre-game and post-game coverage, while Martin, Allegre, and Sutcliffe also contributed reports for the English-language ESPN as part of efforts to promote the simulcast. ESPN Deportes' vice president of programming Freddy Rolon felt that dedicated Spanish-language coverage appealed better to Hispanic viewers than Spanish commentary on the SAP audio channel, going on to say that [...] "I have family members who watch Spanish language television and they don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>that</b> SAP button is to begin with".|$|E
2500|$|British rock critic Nick Kent wrote that, {{sometime}} in the mid-1960s: [...] "Wilson began getting wrapped up in big complicated ideas like 'Art' and 'Civilization'. People would tell him the most commonplace facts about such-and-such a composer or painter and Brian would just flip right out ... A visitor would read a fragment from a volume of Omar Khayyam and Brian Wilson would leap up, his head just awash with all this magical dumb inspiration, screaming 'Wow' and 'Too much' {{over and over again}} because he sensed right there and then that this guy had access to all the answers to the problems besetting our troubled universe. According to unnamed participants of the Smile sessions, [...] "If you came up to the house and introduced something new to Brian's thought processes–astrology, a different way to think about the relationship of Russia to China, anything at all–if {{all of a sudden he}} was into that, it would find its way into the music. You could hear a bit and say, 'I <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>that</b> feeling came from.'" [...] Tony Asher remembers that Wilson [...] "exhibit this awful taste.

2500|$|Like {{the earlier}} {{attempts}} at bands, The Waterfront fizzled out, but in late 1983 Couzens {{decided to try}} again at starting a band, and approached Brown. They decided on Wolstencroft (who had turned down the job of drummer in The Smiths) as drummer and Pete Garner as bassist (despite his admission {{that he could not}} play anything but [...] "Block Buster!"). They also decided that they needed Squire in the band, and when he agreed the band's line-up was cemented. Leaving their previous bands behind, they worked solely on new material. Brown's vocal limitations prompted him to take singing lessons for three weeks. After rehearsing for some time without a band name, Squire came up with [...] "The Stone Roses". Several stories later emerged suggesting that the band had initially been called [...] "English Rose" [...] or that the name was somehow linked to The Rolling Stones, but these were untrue, Brown explaining [...] "No, I don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>that</b> English Rose story came from. John thought up the name [...] "Stone Roses" [...] - something with a contrast, two words that went against each other". The band rehearsed for six months, during which time Wolstencroft had been auditioning for other bands, and he left to join Terry Hall's band The Colourfield. They got Goodwin to rejoin, but he lasted for only one rehearsal, so they advertised for a replacement and began auditioning, eventually recruiting Alan Wren in May 1984.|$|E
