40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2014 This {{research}} study explores {{the role of}} museum marketing departments <b>during</b> <b>the</b> exhibition <b>development</b> process. Literature suggests a trend of museum marketing departments becoming increasingly involved in <b>the</b> exhibition <b>development</b> process. For-profit internal marketing strategies provide strategic comparison to the best practices and benefits attributed to the increased involvement of <b>the</b> marketing department <b>during</b> <b>the</b> exhibition <b>development</b> process. <b>The</b> Museum of History & Industry, Pacific Science Center, Henry Art Gallery, and Museum of Flight serve as case studies {{for the role of}} museum marketing departments <b>during</b> <b>the</b> exhibition <b>development</b> process. Interviews with museum marketing professionals at each institution shed light on how marketing is involved with <b>the</b> exhibition <b>development</b> process, <b>the</b> best practices of that role, steps to achieve the best practices, and the benefits of achieving the best practices stated. Analysis and discussion reveal increased marketing involvement <b>during</b> <b>the</b> exhibition <b>development</b> process. Emerging trends include; involvement of the marketing department from concept to launch, recognition of benefits to good communication throughout <b>the</b> exhibit <b>development</b> process, and an alignment of the interviewed museums' best practices of marketing departments <b>during</b> <b>the</b> exhibit <b>development</b> process...|$|R

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the effects of energy restriction <b>during</b> <b>the</b> gilt <b>development</b> period on lifetime sow reproductive performance of two maternal lines. There were essentially no interactions among line, dietary treatment, and parity. The Large White x Landrace gilts were heavier before and after dietary treatments, matured later, and had greater longissimus muscle area compared to Nebraska Line gilts. Restricting energy intake <b>during</b> <b>the</b> developmental period increased litter weaning weight but had no affect on litter size. Nutritional management of prolific sow lines <b>during</b> <b>the</b> gilt <b>development</b> period does affect sow and litter performance. However, these results do not suggest that the sow populations studied should be fed differently <b>during</b> <b>the</b> gilt <b>development</b> period...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} the metabolism and energy utiliztion <b>during</b> <b>the</b> early <b>development</b> of Odontobutis potamophila, the oxygen consumption rate and NH 3 -N excretion rate were measured between 20. 8 ℃ and 24. 6 ℃ in this paper. The {{results showed that}} the oxygen consumption rate was very low <b>during</b> <b>the</b> early embryonic <b>development,</b> and <b>the</b> metabolism was kept at a low level. But it increased significantly at the prehatching stage from 0. 315 1 *. Thereafter, oxygen consumption rate increased linearly with <b>the</b> <b>development</b> of O. potamophila; In addition, the NH 3 -N excretion rate increased with <b>the</b> <b>development</b> of O. potamophila too, while it had no significant difference <b>during</b> <b>the</b> early embryonic <b>development.</b> When <b>the</b> embryo earched the eye pigmentation stage, the NH 3 -N excretion rate increased rapidly(P< 0. 05) and achieved maximum value of embryonic stage, yet a slightly decreased after hatching. It increased from 8 d to 16 d after hating (P< 0. 05), and then NH 3 -N excretion rate keeps still. The results indicated that the metabolism improved gradually <b>during</b> <b>the</b> early <b>development</b> of O. potamophila.

The movement of Ariel's hair underwater was based on footage of astronaut Sally Ride while she was in space. Extra reference was given by filming Stoner swimming in a pool, which also helped guide Ariel's aquatic movement.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} first instalment, Jumping Flash! 2 was {{developed}} by Japanese developer Exact Co., Ltd however Ultra Co., Ltd {{was not involved in}} development. The game engine and most of the interface were transferred from its predecessor to Jumping Flash! 2 in order to save time <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>development.</b> Despite the initial similarities the developers decided to give Jumping Flash! 2 a much larger draw distance, higher quality textures, and updated enemy AI in order to give the game a more memorable first-person 3D perspective. Jumping Flash! 2 was not designed to be a technology demonstrator, unlike its predecessor.|$|E
5|$|Banjo-Tooie was {{developed}} by Rare and designed by Gregg Mayles, who previously worked on Banjo-Kazooie. Development of the game started in June 1998. Some features that were originally cut <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> of Banjo-Kazooie, such as some of its worlds and a multiplayer game mode, were instead integrated into Banjo-Tooie. An additional world set in a castle was planned, but due to time constraints, it was scrapped during development and assets from it were used in constructing Cauldron Keep. The game features roughly 150 total characters, including enemies and non-playable characters.|$|E

Development was led by Sonic Team veterans Yuji Naka, Naoto Ohshima, and Takashi Iizuka. Naka began the project with the main idea revolving around flight, and Ohshima designed the character Nights to resemble an angel that could fly like a bird. Ohshima designed Nights specifically as an androgynous character. The team conducted research on dreaming and REM sleep, and was influenced by the works and theories of psychoanalysts Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud. An analogue controller, known as the Saturn 3D controller, was designed alongside the game and was included with some retail copies sold.|$|E
