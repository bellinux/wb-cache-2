500|$|Elías also {{discussed}} the three different strategies seen within the independence movement, electoral participation, civil mobilization and clandestine struggle.

Ojeda Ríos justified the vigency of armed resistance, also distancing itself from terrorism, dictatorship or coups. He {{also discussed}} his close friendship with Rafael Cancel Miranda and confided that the EPB had been covertly publishing documents about armed resistance that in his view were gathering this tactic support from the public. When questioned by Elías about the reason behind the move from a mostly paramilitary strategy to also include activism, Ojeda Ríos quoted that several other armed organizations had spent prolonged periods in preparation before stricking, citing 15 years of inactivity by the zapatistas while it gathered the support of Amerindian groups, the initial movements in Vietnam during the 1930s and the organization of the French Revolution as examples. Ojeda Ríos gave his opinion of then-Resident Commissioner Luis Fortuño to this journalist, labeling him as [...] "a person with no dignity", [...] "who is totally submitted to the will of the United States government" [...] and [...] "does not make decisions that favor the people".

If Kinkade's art is principally about ideas, and I think it is, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>suggested</b> that he is a Conceptual artist.

40|$|Natural zeolites as a raw {{material}} to prepare catalytic precursors for the oxidation reaction of linear and poly-aromatic hydrocarbons {{are reported in}} this work.

The materials are analyzed by different physicochemical techniques and used as catalysts for propane and naphthalene oxidation in emissions sources. Comparatively, Rh-zeolites are the most active catalysts for propane conversion.

40|$|Abstract: We have {{analyzed}} telomeres in four hamster {{cell lines}} to investigate how telomeres look in cells grown past the Hayflick limit. In all four cell lines telomeric signals were seen after detection with two different sensitive in situ methods (FISH with PNA probes and PRINS). The telomeric signals {{were not very}} strong, suggesting that the repeats are very short, but were nevertheless clearly visible. With the PRINS technique, it was further possible to probe also {{for the presence of}} variant telomeric repeats at the chromosome ends. With some of the variant repeat probes, a difference was seen between probes for the C-rich, and probes for the G-rich strand of the repeats. This is similar to findings on normal human chromosomes, and <b>it</b> <b>could</b> therefore <b>be</b> <b>suggested</b> that hamster telomeres are similar to human telomeres in having a discrete domain of variant repeats centromeric to the (AGGGTT) n repeats. Some differences in staining patterns with the variant probes were observed between the various cell lines, but the significance of this finding is unclear. It seems that the telomeres are maintained by telomerase in the cell lines investigeted, as a telomerase assay was positive in all four cell lines...|$|R
50|$|Though {{self-assessment}} {{is one of}} the self-evaluation motives <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>suggested</b> that it may not be {{the most}} popular one. Self-enhancement was displayed in each of the experiments conducted by Sedikides and self-assessment, and even self-verification to an extent was only displayed when it was teased out. This is not to say that self-assessment is not a self-evaluation motive, however most of the experiments conducted by Sedikides ended up with the participants reflecting on central traits rather than peripheral traits. This is unsurprising as they are the most important traits to a person's self-concept, however it is not therefore surprising that these are the traits that are enhanced rather than assessed as if someone assessed their central traits and found fault it would be more of an issue than finding a fault with a peripheral trait. The fifth experiment carried out by Sedikides shows that self-assessment does exist and {{is one of the}} self-evaluation motives; if people didn't self-assess then even in this experiment there would have been no difference between the reflections of those asked to be objective and those who were not. Self-assessment is a difficult motive to assess, as discovered by Sedikides but it is important to self-evaluation as it means that people are able to realize ways in which to improve themselves.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{interesting}} how Landauer coins {{the terms of}} [...] "time" [...] and [...] "eternity" [...] in his essay [...] "Skepsis und Mystik" [...] (Sceticism and Mysticism). Eckhart or Neoplatonists of the Christian and Pre-Christian tradition (Plotinus, Augustinus, Dionysius Areopagita, Scotus Eriugena, Bonaventura etc.) respectively, did not define eternity as a time span which was forever expanded. Eternity is rather present in every moment of time, as it contains time {{as a whole and}} transcends it at the same time. An [...] "secluded" [...] person that can free himself from time, experiences eternity by [...] "mystical show" [...] (spiritual perception) (Plotinus). For Landauer eternity at the same time is an everlasting temporal continuation but also the source of the temporal stream of development (Entwicklungsstrom). The idea of past and future is a [...] "distortion of space" [...] because only by applying ideas of space <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>suggested</b> that we are standing at a point from which one can see into the past and into the future. The opinions that eternity is an everlasting temporal continuation or it is the source of time, seem to contradict each other. For Landauer eternity remains bound to the course of time.

5000|$|Isaac has {{the power}} of precognition, which allows him to depict images of the future, usually while in a trance-like state.

Very little context comes to Isaac {{when he sees the}} future. He can't tell anything about the people, places, or events involved beyond what he specifically sees at that moment. Thus, he is often surprised to find out weeks later what his work is actually depicting. Also due to the previous heroin use, Isaac was not able to clearly remember certain images after he painted them, as he stated in [...] "Better Halves". It would seem that his precognitive abilities also augment his natural abilities as a painter, as Simone once complimented how much she appreciates the works he creates when he is high, and from the way Peter completed the unfinished portrait in [...] "Hiros" [...] when he first actively duplicated Isaac's power despite the latter having no innate talents whatsoever as a painter. It showed that Peter was painting an image he could partially see, so <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>suggested</b> that Isaac's power allows one to trace an image from the future, rather than paint it from scratch ...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the short-term effects of occlusal splint therapy and tricyclic antidepressants on the bite force and occlusal contact area of patients presenting with nocturnal bruxism. Methods: A maxillary full-coverage hard acrylic splint was applied to the five patients (Group S). Five patients took a tricyclic antidepressant (Amitriptiline HCl, 10 mg/day) for 3 months (Group A) and a control group (Group C) comprising of 10 dental school students with normal occlusion was also formed. Using a Dental Prescale (Fuji Photo Film Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and an Occluzer computer (FPD 703, Fuji Photo Film Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) the bite force and occlusal contact area were measured. The evaluations were made just before the treatment and at 1 month and 3 months of treatment. Results: The bite force and occlusal contact area before treatment in study Groups A and S were found to be higher than those in the Group C. Furthermore, the bite force and occlusal contact area increased during treatment in Group A whilst they decreased in Group S. Bite force and occlusal contact area in Group S were lower at both 1 month and 3 months of treatment than in Group C.

40|$|Aim and Background: Strenuous {{endurance}} training induces {{oxidative stress}} in athletes' body. Therefore, {{this study was}} designed to investigate the effects of curcumin supplementation and light resistance training during endurance training on soleus muscles antioxidant capacity (SOD) and lipid peroxidation (MDA) of serum in male Wistar rats. Material and Methods: For this experimental study, 36 healthy male Wistar rats, after 1 -week familiarization (age: 9 weeks and weights: 255. 62 ± 19. 99), were divided randomly into 6 groups: control (N= 6), curcumin (N= 6), endurance (N= 6), endurance+resistance (N= 6), endurance+curcumin (N= 6) and endurance+curcumin+resistance (N= 6). Incremental endurance training (8 weeks and 5 session a week) carried out on an animal treadmill. The speed and duration of running reached to 35 m/min for 70 min at last week.  Resistance training (8 weeks and 2 session a week) carried out on vertical ladder with extra weight (30 - 70 % BW) fixed on tail. The animals received curcumin supplement by intraperitoneal injection (8 weeks, 3 times per week, 30 mg/kg. Bw). SOD enzyme activity of skeletal muscle and serum MDA level was measured by ELISA and TBARS methods respectively. One way ANOVA were used for analysis of data.  Results: SOD enzyme activity of soleus muscle in endurance training group (1. 58 ± 0. 222 u/mg protein) was significantly (p= 0. 043) lower than control group (2. 22 ± 0. 481). Also SOD activity of soleus muscle in End+Res (1. 87 ± 0. 172; p= 0. 044), End+Cur (2. 14 ± 0. 229; p= 0. 039) and End+Cur+Res (2. 21 ± 0. 155; p= 0. 020) groups were significantly higher than endurance group. MDA level of serum in endurance training group (4. 27 ± 0. 438 nmol/mg protein) was significantly (p= 0. 031) higher than control group (3. 42 ± 0. 350) and MDA level of serum in End+Res (3. 04 ± 0. 342; p= 0. 023), End+Cur (2. 73 ± 0. 342; p= 0. 000) and End+Cur+Res (3. 27 ± 0. 349; p= 0. 008) groups were significantly lower than endurance group. Conclusion: Based on our results, the prolonged strenuous endurance training can induce oxidative stress and curcumin supplementation and light resistance training alone (Curcumin: SOD 35 % increase and MDA 50 % decrease; Resistance training: SOD 18 % increase and MDA 40 % decrease) and together (SOD 39 % increase and MDA 30 % decrease) could improve SOD enzyme activity and decrease the MDA levels. Thus, for those athletes who use strenuous endurance training, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>suggest</b> use from these supplements.  ...|$|R
