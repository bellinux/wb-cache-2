40|$|Abstract. We have {{developed}} an evolutionary approach for the flexible docking that is now {{an important component of}} a rational drug design. This automatic <b>docking</b> <b>tool,</b> referred to as the GEMDOCK (Generic Evolutionary Method for DOCKing molecules), combines both global and local search strategies search mechanisms. GEMDOCK used a simple scoring function to recognize compounds by minimizing the energy of molecular interactions. The interactive types of atoms between ligands and proteins of our linear scoring function consist only hydrogenbonding and steric terms. GEMDOCK has been tested on a diverse dataset of 100 protein-ligand complexes from Protein Data Bank. In total 76 % of these complexes, it obtained docked ligand conformations with root mean square derivations (RMSD) to the crystal ligand structures less than 2. 0 ˚A when the ligand was docked back into the binding site. Experiments shows that the scoring function is simple and efficiently discriminates between native and non-native docked conformations. This study suggests that GEMDOCK is a useful tool for molecular recognition and is a potential <b>docking</b> <b>tool</b> for protein structure variations. ...|$|E

40|$|Increased {{availability}} of bioinformatics resources is creating {{opportunities for the}} application of network pharmacology to predict drug effects and toxicity resulting from multi-target interactions. Here we present a high-precision computational prediction approach that combines two elaborately built machine learning systems and multiple molecular <b>docking</b> <b>tools</b> to assess binding potentials of a test compound against proteins involved in a complex molecular network. One of the two machine learning systems is a re-scoring function to evaluate binding modes generated by <b>docking</b> <b>tools.</b> The second is a binding mode selection function to identify the most predictive binding mode. Results from a series of benchmark validations and a case study show that this approach surpasses the prediction reliability of other techniques and that it also identifies either primary or off-targets of kinase inhibitors.

40|$|Abstract: Core {{elements}} of cell regulation {{are made up}} of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. However, many parts of the cell regulatory systems include unknown PPIs. To approach this problem, we have developed a computational method of high-throughput PPI network prediction based on all-to-all rigid-body docking of protein tertiary structures. The prediction system accepts a set of data comprising protein tertiary structures as input and generates a list of possible interacting pairs from all the combinations as output. A crucial advantage of this docking based method is in providing predictions of protein pairs that increases our understanding of biological pathways by analyzing the structures of candi-date complex structures, which gives insight into novel interaction mechanisms. Although such exhaustive docking calcu-lation requires massive computational resources, recent advancements in the computational sciences have made such large-scale calculations feasible. In this study we applied our prediction method to a pathway reconstruction problem of bacterial chemotaxis by using two different rigid-body <b>docking</b> <b>tools</b> with different scoring models. We found that the predicted interactions were different between the results from the two tools. When the positive predictions from both of the <b>docking</b> <b>tools</b> were combined, all the core signaling interactions were correctly predicted with the exception of interactions activated by protein phosphory-lation.

40|$|Structure-based virtual {{screening}} (SBVS) methods often rely on docking score. The docking {{score is}} an over-simplification {{of the actual}} ligand-target binding. Its capability to model and predict the actual binding reality is limited. Recently, interaction fingerprinting (IFP) has come and offered us an alternative way to model reality. IFP provides us an alternate way to examine protein-ligand interactions. The docking score indicates the approximate affinity and IFP shows the interaction specificity. IFP is a method to convert three dimensional (3 D) protein-ligand interactions into one dimensional (1 D) bitstrings.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} the unified conformational sampling and <b>docking</b> <b>tool</b> called Sampler for Multiple Protein-Ligand Entities (S 4 MPLE). The main novelty in S 4 MPLE is the unified dealing with intra- and intermolecular degrees of freedom (DoF). While classically programs are either designed for folding or docking, S 4 MPLE transcends this artificial specialization. It supports folding, docking of a flexible ligand into a flexible site and simultaneous docking of several ligands. The trick behind it is the formal assimilation of inter-molecular to intra-molecular DoF associated to putative inter-molecular contact axes. This is implemented within the genetic operators powering a Lamarckian Genetic Algorithm (GA). Further novelty includes differentiable interaction fingerprints to control population diversity, and fitting a simple continuum solvent model and favorable contact bonus terms to the AMBER/GAFF force field. Novel applications—docking of fragment-like compounds, simultaneous docking of multiple ligands, including free crystallographic waters—were published elsewhere.

The model encoded and tested is that side-chain conformational changes involving more atoms or larger angles {{are likely to be more}} costly and less prevalent than small motions due to energy barriers between rotamers and the potential of large motions to cause new steric clashes. Accordingly, SLIDE adjusts the protein and ligand side groups as little as necessary to achieve steric complementarity.
