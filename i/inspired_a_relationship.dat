40|$|György Kurtág's music makes {{extensive}} {{musical and}} extra-musical reference in ways {{which are often}} highly personal, yet the instructions which he gives to his performers are very often unclear, ambiguous, or even confusing. Through the examination of {{a small number of}} Játékok, centring on the 'Hommage à Tchaikovsky', the author demonstrates the compositional motivations behind some of this music. The discussion covers the use of musical reference and near-quotation, notation and performance physicality. These are also pieces which are situated within a pedagogical framework, and so <b>inspire</b> <b>a</b> particular <b>relationship</b> between the composer and his interpreter. In the 'Hommage à Tchaikovsky', Kurtág's idiosyncratic reinterpretation of the B flat minor Concerto is transformed into a direct engagement with the very physical experience of playing the piano. Through the analysis of complementary works this paper shows how this transmission of personal experience through musical and physical gesture seems crucial to Kurtág's compositional thought...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 This thesis takes {{a magical}} realist {{approach}} to unpack today's challenges and to <b>inspire</b> <b>a</b> subjective <b>relationship</b> to these matters.

Interbay is the industrial switching yard of Seattle with strong historical echoes. Formerly a waterway, in 1911, the land was capped by asphalt., a 56 -acre parking lot remains. The site is an engineered landscape, a relic of Seattle's past. Early settlers played high-stakes by building a railyard on waterways and overlaid notions of risk-taking and engineering onto the landscape. Considering global warming and rising sea levels, the seawater will inevitably return. An imagined resettlement of Smith Cove is proposed and the persona of the settler is developed as two characters: the gambler and the engineer, based on notions of manipulating the landscape through chance and opportunity...|$|R

The lyricist told Rolling Stone, [...] "I wouldn't want anyone to think it's the clichéd break-up record but I haven't written about true, personal experiences all that much in the past." [...] The move to more intimate subject matter was [...] "semi-conscious" [...] because the band members did not want to focus on socio-political issues as they had in their previous works. Three tracks allude to Greek mythology: [...] "Ares" [...] draws its name from the god of war, [...] "Trojan Horse" [...] is named after the Trojan War military ruse, and [...] "Zephyrus" [...] draws its name from the god of the west wind. The narrative in the songs occurs between two people and focuses on the relations between lovers, friends, and enemies; Okereke indicated that [...] "it's about moments of shared vulnerability". [...] "Better Than Heaven" [...] references the Garden of Eden and , because the lyricist wanted to explore the themes of sex and death, especially in a biblical context.|$|R

Keys' cover of Prince's 1982 ballad [...] "How Come U Don't Call Me Anymore?" [...] (retitled [...] "How Come You Don't Call Me") was <b>inspired</b> by <b>a</b> long-term <b>relationship</b> with <b>a</b> partner. The music critic for PopMatters felt that the song was credible, but fell short from the original and Stephanie Mills's 1980s cover. [...] "Fallin'", the gospel-driven lead single and often considered Keys's signature song, contains a sample of James Brown's [...] "It's a Man's Man's Man's World".

Horowitz, giving the album {{three and a}} half stars for Billboard, writes, [...] "she shouldn't be dismissed as a carbon copy Amy Winehouse - the LP, <b>inspired</b> by <b>an</b> eight-year <b>relationship's</b> end, is too genuinely intentioned and rife with regret.
