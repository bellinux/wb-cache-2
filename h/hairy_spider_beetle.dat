40|$|Documentation of New Species of the Bizarre South African Endemic Genus Meziomorphum (Coleoptera: Ptinidae) Olivia M. Gearner T. Keith Philips Department of Biology, Western Kentucky University South Africa {{is home to}} some of {{the highest}} <b>spider</b> <b>beetle</b> {{diversity}} in the world. However, due to their small body size, and often small populations with limited distributions, there are likely many species that remain undiscovered and undocumented. Further, this megadiverse region includes three biodiversity hotspots - regions with high diversity that are also under severe threat of environmental destruction. Meziomorphum is a genus of <b>spider</b> <b>beetles</b> only found in South Africa within two of these hotspots. Four species of this genus are known, including one that exists only within a single cave located in the Western Cape. Four new species were recently discovered in several museum collections and are described herein. This genus {{is one of the most}} morphologically unique and distinct within the <b>spider</b> <b>beetles.</b> Species are characterized by a bizarre meringue-like and thick covering composed of fused setae on the pronotum and rows of long, erect spines on the elytra, the latter potentially an adaptation for avoiding predation from ants. Importantly, these beetles are useful for determining where protected areas should be created, as their distribution reflects habitats with a wide variety of species with similar high levels of endemicity that are also under a great risk of extinction...|$|R
50|$|Antechinuses are small, carnivorous, shrew-like {{animals that}} {{primarily}} prey on invertebrates such as <b>spiders,</b> <b>beetles</b> (including larvae), and weevils. Some are strictly terrestrial and hunt only at ground level, {{while others are}} arboreal (tree-climbing) in nature. Most species nest communally in tree-hollows. Their primary habitats are: swamps, tropical rainforests, temperate rainforests and woodlands.|$|R
50|$|The Australian <b>spider</b> <b>beetle</b> (Pictus tectus) {{measures}} 2.5-4 mm {{in length}} and is coloured dark brown. The adults have biting mouthparts, a well developed thorax and 11-segmented antennae. Characteristics which give them a spider-like appearance include a stout body, pronounced constriction of the neck shield and 6 long thin legs with 5-segmented tarsi.|$|R
25|$|Arthropods and {{molluscs}} found include millipedes, collembolans, <b>spiders,</b> <b>beetles,</b> slugs, {{and various}} centipedes. Animals that inhabit the Northern Coast range are weevils, chipmunks, bears, rabbits, white-footed deer mice, Columbian Black tail deer, and others. Birds include chickadees, red-breasted nuthatches, kinglets, Western pileated woodpeckers, Oregon gray jays, California creepers, and Sitka red crossbills among others.|$|R
5|$|Beetles, both {{adults and}} larvae, are the prey of many animal predators {{including}} mammals from bats to rodents, birds, lizards, amphibians, fishes, dragonflies, robberflies, reduviid bugs, ants, other <b>beetles,</b> and <b>spiders.</b> <b>Beetles</b> {{use a variety}} of anti-predator adaptations to defend themselves. These include camouflage and mimicry against predators that hunt by sight, toxicity, and defensive behaviour.|$|R
