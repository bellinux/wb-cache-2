25|$|At {{the gate}} to the engine, Namgoong reveals that he plans to use the highly {{flammable}} Kronole as an explosive to blow a hatch to the outside, as he observed signs the world outside is thawing and may be hospitable. Curtis confesses to him that shortly after boarding the train, the tail passengers resorted to cannibalism to survive, and he is haunted by his part in it. He was nearly ready to kill infant Edgar when Gilliam offered his own arm instead. After years of disdain for Wilford, Curtis seeks to learn what Wilford's intentions were. Franco is revealed to have survived and makes <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> engine.|$|E
2500|$|Nedda, {{trying to}} {{continue}} the play, admits {{that she has been}} visited by the innocent Arlecchino. Canio, furious and forgetting the play, demands the name of her lover. Nedda swears she will never tell him, and it becomes apparent that they are not acting. Beppe asks Tonio to intervene, but Tonio refrains and prevents Beppe from halting the action. Silvio begins to fight <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> stage. Canio, grabbing a knife from the table, stabs Nedda. As she dies, she calls: [...] "Help! Silvio!". Silvio attacks Canio, but Canio kills Silvio also. The horrified audience then hears the celebrated final line: ...|$|E
2500|$|Spargo {{was elected}} to the National Committee of the Socialist Party in 1905 and to the {{governing}} National Executive Committee in 1909. As his biographer notes, during this period Spargo began [...] "easing <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> reformist right-wing" [...] of the SPA, giving up on the tactic of agitation among striking workers in favor of building middle class socialist educational institutions. Spargo was instrumental in helping establish the Rand School of Social Science, persuading George D. Herron and his wife Carrie Rand Herron to make a large bequest and Mrs. Herron's mother to provide seed money for the new institution. Spargo also was a co-founder of the Intercollegiate Socialist Society (ISS), an organization dedicated to the establishment of non-partisan socialist study groups on college campuses and sponsoring debates and lectures on socialist topics. Spargo would later serve on the ISS executive from 1916 to 1919.|$|E
60|$|As the Heliumite watched he {{saw another}} green warrior push <b>his</b> <b>way</b> forward <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> rostrum. Beside him he dragged a captive, {{and as the}} {{surrounding}} warriors parted to let the two pass, Carthoris caught a fleeting glimpse of the prisoner.|$|R
60|$|All within hearing {{immediately}} turned {{about and}} beheld the semblance of Mr. Hooper pacing slowly <b>his</b> meditative <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> meeting-house. With one accord they started, expressing more wonder than if some strange minister {{were coming to}} dust the cushions of Mr. Hooper's pulpit.|$|R
60|$|Once more {{he sought}} water, and after {{drinking}} deeply, took <b>his</b> <b>way</b> slowly <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> cabin by the sea. In times of loneliness and trouble it {{had long been}} his custom to seek there the quiet and restfulness which he could find nowhere else.|$|R
2500|$|On {{his arrival}} in Tiberias, Assi had an {{adventure}} with a ruffian, which ended disastrously for the latter. Assi was making <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> baths, when he was assaulted by a [...] "scorner." [...] He did not resent the assault, except by remarking, [...] "That man's neck-band is too loose," [...] and continued on his way. It so happened that an archon was at that very hour trying a thief, and the scoffer, still laughing at the adventure with Assi, came to witness the trial just when the judge interrogated the culprit as to accomplices. The culprit, seeing the man laughing, {{thought that it was}} at his discomfiture, and to avenge himself pointed to the ruffian as his accomplice. The man was apprehended and examined. He confessed to a murder he had committed, and was sentenced to be hanged with the convicted thief. Assi, on returning from the baths, encountered the procession {{on its way to the}} execution. His assailant on seeing him exclaimed, [...] "The neck-band which was loose will soon be tightened", to which Assi replied, [...] "Thy fate has long since been foretold, for the Bible says (Isa. xxviii. 22), 'Be ye not scorners lest your bands be made strong '" [...] (Yer. Ber. ii. 5c).|$|E
60|$|Martin nodded. The nigger-heaven bouncer {{was making}} <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> disturbance.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Coulson went on <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> {{exit from}} the station, puffing contentedly at his big cigar.|$|E
50|$|The book {{contains}} 12 chapters, {{which are}} loosely connected with each other, mainly by reappearing characters. It {{is more like}} {{a collection of short stories}} - each chapter can stand on its own. A conventional encompassing plot is missing. However, there is a thread: the protagonists are forced to mature, each one in <b>his</b> own <b>way,</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> end of the book.|$|R
60|$|About {{the same}} time that Lothair had {{repaired}} to the residence of Mr. Giles, Monsignore Berwick, whose audience of the cardinal in the morning had preceded that of the legal adviser of <b>the</b> trustees, made <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> one of <b>the</b> noblest mansions in St. James's Square, where resided Lord St. Jerome.|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope {{never to}} use this 'ere piece again if I didn't. The sneak has been wrigglin' <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> us for <b>the</b> last ten minutes, an' I only waited to let him believe he was keepin' his red carcass out of sight, {{although}} I marked it plainly from the instant he started." ...|$|R
60|$|He drew a {{card from}} his pocket, {{handed it to}} the officer and made <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> door.|$|E
6000|$|... "That can't be if she's still afloat," [...] Bob cried testily, {{and from}} {{the sound of his voice}} Jim knew he was making <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> rail.|$|E
60|$|The descent {{came to an}} end, however, as {{must all}} things in this world, and he groped <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> kitchen door, {{not so much as}} daring to breathe.|$|E
60|$|The {{crossing}} {{was most}} difficult, {{for he was}} very weak, but at last {{he came to the}} opposite bank and drew himself up to lie panting for a few minutes on the sloping bank. Then he crawled on again up to the top, and staggering to his feet made <b>his</b> <b>way</b> cautiously <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> two huts. All was quiet. He assumed that the party was asleep, and so he lay down near the rude shelter he had constructed for Barbara Harding, and fell asleep.|$|R
60|$|As on the {{previous}} day, just for the joy of it, he followed cattle-trails at haphazard and worked <b>his</b> <b>way</b> up <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> summits. Coming out on a wagon road that led upward, he followed it for several miles, emerging in a small, mountain-encircled valley, where half a dozen poor ranchers farmed the wine-grapes on the steep slopes. Beyond, the road pitched upward. Dense chaparral covered the exposed hillsides but in the creases of the canons huge spruce trees grew, and wild oats and flowers.|$|R
50|$|Lair thought Young uniquely {{qualified}} to operate solo {{in a culture}} so different from American ways. Lair had Young work <b>his</b> <b>way</b> westward <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> mountains where he was reared. Young's directions were to contact village headmen for recruitment, and to find airstrip locations for Lima Sites. He was also exploring a possible line of retreat for Vang Pao's army through Sainyabuli Province southward into Thailand. Young reached Sainyabuli Province in January 1962. Keeping a low profile there throughout the spring, {{he was able to}} recruit only 30 new guerrillas.|$|R
60|$|Arriving on {{the field}} he found the Old Boys batting. He stopped and watched an over of Adair's. The fifth ball bowled a man. Mike made <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> pavilion.|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall write {{a note to}} Miss Maurel," [...] {{the prince}} promised, as he made <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> writing-table, [...] "and ask her to visit me upon some other afternoon." ...|$|E
60|$|Tarzan {{rose and}} {{stretched}} lazily. The entertainment {{was beginning to}} bore him. He yawned and turned upon <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> clearing where the tribe would be sleeping in the encircling trees.|$|E
6000|$|For on {{the island}} of Boupari it was high feast with the worshippers of their god that night. The sun had turned on the Tropic of Capricorn at noon, and was making <b>his</b> <b>way</b> northward, <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> equator once more; and his votaries, as was their wont, had all come forth to do him honor in due season, and to pay their respects, in the inmost and sacredest grove {{on the island}}, to his incarnate representative, the living spirit of trees and fruits and vegetation, the very high god, the divine Tu-Kila-Kila! ...|$|R
60|$|Accordingly, {{the moment}} that the boat touched the shore, he and his {{followers}} rushed on board, and a dreadful scene of consternation and terror ensued. Gloucester himself made <b>his</b> <b>way</b> directly <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> figure of a lady, whose air, and manner, and style of dress indicated, so {{far as he could}} discern them in the darkness, that she was probably the object of his fury. He plunged his dagger into her breast. She, in an agony of terror, leaped into the river. She was buoyed up by her dress, and floated down the stream.|$|R
60|$|Sometimes lolling upon Tantor's back, {{sometimes}} {{roaming the}} jungle in solitude, Korak made <b>his</b> <b>way</b> slowly <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> West and South. He made {{but a few}} miles a day, for he had a whole lifetime before him and no place in particular to go. Possibly he would have moved more rapidly but for the thought which continually haunted him that each mile he traversed carried him further and further away from Meriem--no longer his Meriem, as of yore, it is true! but still as dear to him as ever.|$|R
60|$|After {{the officer}} had helped himself and condescended to relax his stern {{features}} into the {{semblance of a}} smile the young man bid him good night and resumed <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> hotel.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, pshaw! I didn't {{want the}} knife!" [...] he grumbled. [...] "Put it up again, maybe you'll get a bigger price for it," [...] {{and he began}} to edge <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> door.|$|E
60|$|I {{confess that}} I {{was not very}} anxious to look him up, but I {{followed}} the boarder, as he slowly made <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> kitchen door. As we opened the door we instinctively stopped.|$|E
5000|$|In his memoirs, Yehuda Leib Gerst {{described}} Rumkowski as {{a complex}} person: [...] "This man had sickly leanings that clashed. Toward his fellow Jews, he was an incomparable tyrant who behaved just like a Führer and cast deathly terror to anyone who dared to oppose <b>his</b> lowly <b>ways.</b> <b>Toward</b> <b>the</b> perpetrators, however, he was as tender as a lamb {{and there was no}} limit to his base submission to all their demands, even if their purpose was to wipe us out totally. Either way, he did not properly understand his situation and positing and their limits." ...|$|R
60|$|Seizing a cudgel {{from the}} nearest priest, he laid about him like a veritable demon as he forged <b>his</b> rapid <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> altar. The hand of La had paused at the first noise of interruption. When she saw who the author of it was she went white. She {{had never been able}} to fathom the secret of the strange white man's escape from the dungeon in which she had locked him. She had not {{intended}} that he should ever leave Opar, for she had looked upon his giant frame and handsome face with the eyes of a woman and not those of a priestess.|$|R
60|$|And a {{long time}} he sat there with the bunches of the camel-dates above him, golden as the sunlight. Then, as {{the scent of the}} lyric-flowers, {{released}} by evening, warned him of the night dropping like a flight of dark birds on the plain, he rose stiffly, and made <b>his</b> <b>way</b> as usual <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Vita Publica.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I'll {{leave it}} here," [...] he said. [...] "The {{thing would be}} a {{nuisance}} in my pocket," [...] and he dropped it {{into one of the}} desk drawers, while Bince continued <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> shop.|$|E
60|$|As lame as he was, Slugger {{attempted}} to edge <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> door, thinking {{he might get}} a chance to run away. But Jack caught him by the arm and sent him flying backward into a corner of the cabin.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} to drink my fill of that water," [...] Jake said, as he groped <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> rear of the chamber. [...] "It seems as if I hadn't had all I needed since we started on this trip." ...|$|E
40|$|I {{travelled}} to Gera, where Dr. Christoph Schwabe met me [ [...] . ] It was a cold, windy day, {{and we sat}} {{in front}} of the fireplace and talked for over two hours about <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> music therapy, <b>the</b> development of music therapy in the German Democratic Republic (GDR), different influences and experiences within that field before 1989 and the changes that have taken place since then...|$|R
60|$|Tarzan ran a short {{distance}} along the ground before he took to the trees. Then he raced quickly to the upper terrace, there doubling on his tracks and making <b>his</b> <b>way</b> rapidly back <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> village. Here he found that every Arab and Manyuema had joined in the pursuit, leaving the village deserted except for the chained prisoners and a single guard.|$|R
5|$|On {{the evening}} of 26March, Jourdan {{arranged}} for the abandonment of the positions in Engen and Stockach. Saint Cyr had already withdrawn along the Danube, after his and Vandamme's assaults on the Austrian right failed, and was working <b>his</b> <b>way</b> west <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Black Forest. Inexplicably, {{at least at the}} time, the Austrians failed to pursue the retreating French; instead of pursuing the French, Charles ordered his army into cantonments at Stockach and Engen, as far south as Wahlweiss. The Aulic Council, in establishing a plan of battle, had forbidden his approach to the Rhine until Switzerland was also cleared of the French army; Charles simply held his ground.|$|R
