25|$|A similar cascade {{occurred}} in the Baltic Sea {{at the end of}} 1980s. After a decline in Atlantic cod (<b>Gadus</b> <b>morhua),</b> the abundance of its main prey, the sprat (Sprattus sprattus), increased and the Baltic Sea ecosystem shifted from being dominated by cod into being dominated by sprat. The next level of trophic cascade was a decrease in the abundance of Pseudocalanus acuspes, a copepod which the sprat prey on.|$|E
25|$|In one {{laboratory}} study, Atlantic cod (<b>Gadus</b> <b>morhua)</b> given {{access to}} an operant feeding machine learned to pull a string to get food. However, the researchers had also tagged the fish by threading a bead {{in front of their}} dorsal fin. Some fish snagged the string with their bead, resulting in food delivery. These fish eventually learned to swim in a particular way to repeatedly make the bead snag the string and get food. Because the fish used an object external to their body in a goal-oriented way, this satisfies some definitions of tool use.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} a cascade in a complex, open-ocean {{ecosystem}} occurred in the northwest Atlantic during the 1980s and 1990s. The removal of cod (<b>Gadus</b> <b>morhua)</b> and other ground fishes by sustained overfishing resulted in increases in the abundance of the prey species for these ground fishes, particularly smaller forage fishes and invertebrates such as the northern snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio) and northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis). The increased abundance of these prey species altered the community of zooplankton that serve as food for smaller fishes and invertebrates as an indirect effect.|$|E
2500|$|The {{two most}} common species of cod are the Atlantic cod (<b>Gadus</b> <b>morhua),</b> which {{lives in the}} colder waters and deeper sea regions {{throughout}} the North Atlantic, and the Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus), found in both eastern and western regions of the northern Pacific. <b>Gadus</b> <b>morhua</b> was named by Linnaeus in 1758.

2500|$|The {{fisheries}} {{have been}} and still {{are the most important}} economic activity in Hovden. Several different fisheries are important, but the most significant are the winter-fisheries between Christmas and Easter. [...] These fisheries are also known under the name Lofotfisket. The Cod, <b>gadus</b> <b>morhua</b> migrate from the Barents Sea to spawn along the coast of Lofoten and have to pass Vesterålen on its way. Hovdens location is excellent given the short way to the areas where the fish are migrating south and northbound. For people living in Hovden, 80% of the total income was made during {{the first quarter of the}} year. The abundance of fish was far too much for consumption, and the fish was turned into dried fish and later salt fish, and then exported via Bergen to Europe.|$|E

50|$|The Western Gulf of Maine Closure Area (WGoMAC) was {{established}} in 1998 {{in response to the}} decreasing Atlantic Cod (<b>Gadus</b> <b>morhua)</b> stock. WGoMAC is located off the shores of Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Maine and is approximately 3100 km2.

50|$|The {{distinction}} between demersal {{species of fish}} and pelagic species is not always clear cut. The Atlantic cod (<b>Gadus</b> <b>morhua)</b> is a typical demersal fish, but {{can also be found}} in the open water column, and the Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) is predominantly a pelagic species but forms large aggregations near the seabed when it spawns on banks of gravel.|$|E
50|$|Loma morhua, {{also known}} as Loma branchialis, is a species of microsporidian parasite, infecting fish. It forms xenoparasitic {{complexes}} of the cell-hypertrophy tumour type, and {{is found in the}} gills of the Atlantic cod <b>Gadus</b> <b>morhua.</b> It is apansporoblastic, unikaryotic, disporoblastic and undergoes partial development in parasitophorous vacuoles, while lacking plasmodial stages. It produces one or two spores in a vacuole, having tubules in the parasitophorous vacuoles.|$|E
50|$|Whitefish {{or white}} fish is a {{fisheries}} term referring to {{several species of}} demersal fish with fins, particularly Atlantic cod (<b>Gadus</b> <b>morhua),</b> Caspian kutum (Rutilus kutum), whiting (Merluccius bilinearis), and haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), but also hake (Urophycis), pollock (Pollachius), or others. Whitefish (Coregonidae) is also the name of several species of Atlantic freshwater fish, so {{the use of the}} two-word term 'white fish' is less misleading.|$|E
50|$|Common {{characteristics}} {{include the}} {{positioning of the}} pelvic fins (if present), below or {{in front of the}} pectoral fins. Gadiformes are physoclists, which means their gas bladders do not have a pneumatic duct. The fins are spineless. Gadiform fish range in size from the codlets, which may be as small as 7 cm in adult length, to the Atlantic cod, <b>Gadus</b> <b>morhua,</b> which reaches up to 2 m.|$|E

50|$|Haisborough Sands and its {{surrounding}} shoals {{are known to be}} spawning grounds for Sand eels Ammodytes, Lemon sole Microstormus Kitt and sole Solea solea. The sands also provide nursery grounds for Cod <b>Gadus</b> <b>morhua,</b> Herring Clupea harengus, Mackerel Scomber scombrus, Sole, Lemon sole and Plaice Pleuronectes platessa. There are small numbers of Harbour porpoise regularly observed within the boundaries of the sands. The common seals Phoca vitulina which are resident in the Wash are occasionally observed in this area.|$|E
50|$|Kildin Island is a plateau, up to 900 feet in elevation; {{it drops}} sharply {{to the sea}} on the north. Great granite masses rise from the sea and are carved into broad terraces. In the {{interior}} there is a relict lake, Lake Mogil'noe (or Molginoye), which is separated from Kildin Strait by an isthmus through which seawater filters that replenishes the lake. The brackish lake holds a unique species of cod (<b>Gadus</b> <b>morhua</b> kildinensis) that has adapted to it.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} found as an {{external}} parasite on the Atlantic cod (<b>Gadus</b> <b>morhua),</b> the Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus), a shark in the genus Squalus, the common skate (Raja batis), the thorny skate (Amblyraja radiata) and the barndoor skate (Dipturus laevis). Large numbers have also {{been found in the}} stomach of a Greenland shark, though whether living as a parasite or as a commensal is unclear. It was also found {{for the first time on}} the goldstripe sardinella (Sardinella gibbosa) off the coast of Egypt in 2007.|$|E
50|$|It is {{manufactured}} by Abba Seafood. Kalles Kaviar {{is based on}} a recipe that is several hundred years old that originates from the Swedish west coast, and in particular from Lysekil. The product is mainly made of salted cod roe (<b>gadus</b> <b>morhua),</b> sugar, canola oil and spices. In French, this type of caviar is sometimes referred to as caviar de Lysekil. Other manufacturers of similar caviar are Öhnbergs Kaviar (often regarded as the connoisseur's alternative, and currently also owned by Abba Seafood) and Boviks kaviar.|$|E

5000|$|The Firth of Clyde in South West Scotland, {{an area of}} 3650 square miles, is {{the most}} southerly fjord in the {{northern}} hemisphere and extends over 100 km into Scotland’s west coast. Once comprising a highly diverse and rich ecosystem the Firth of Clyde marine environment has seen dramatic alterations throughout the last 200 years. [...] During the 19th century, diverse mixed fisheries existed in the Firth of Clyde for herring (Clupea harengus), cod (<b>Gadus</b> <b>morhua),</b> haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), turbot (Psetta maxima) {{and a variety of}} other species.|$|E
50|$|Relationships between fish {{stock changes}} in the Baltic Sea and the M74 {{syndrome}}: The M74 syndrome is connected to a weak Atlantic cod (<b>Gadus</b> <b>morhua)</b> stock and strong year classes of sprat in the Baltic Sea. Since the collapse, heavy fishing mortality as well as predation on cod eggs by sprat and food competition between sprat and young-of-the-year cod has inhibited cod recovery. Coincidentally with {{the decline in the}} cod stock since 1982, and following the consequent reduction in predation pressure, the sprat stock increased rapidly, and salmon therefore had more food. Salmon grew faster, resulting also in a high CF.|$|E
50|$|Gadimyxa arctica is {{a species}} of {{parasitic}} myxozoan. Together with G. atlantica and G. sphaerica, they infect <b>Gadus</b> <b>morhua</b> and Arctogadus glacialis by developing coelozoically in bisporic plasmodia in their urinary systems. These 3 species' spores exhibit two morphological forms: wide and subspherical, being both types bilaterally symmetrical along the suture line. The wide spores have a mean width ranging from 7.5-10μm, respectively, while the subspherical ones range from 5.3-8μm in mean width. The subspherical forms of Gadimyxa are similar to Ortholinea, differing {{in the development of}} the spores and in the arrangement of the polar capsules.|$|E
