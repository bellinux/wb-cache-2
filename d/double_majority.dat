25|$|This measure {{appeared}} as Measure 56, and would exempt elections held in May and November of any {{year from the}} <b>double</b> <b>majority</b> requirement. It was later passed by voters on November 4, 2008. Proponents of the measure called the <b>double</b> <b>majority</b> rule undemocratic because, in their view, the rule gave non-voters unfair influence in the democratic process {{by allowing them to}} make measures fail that otherwise won support among the majority of those who actually voted. They also argued that because of Oregon's exclusive vote-by-mail voting system, which makes it more convenient to vote, {{there is no reason for}} people not to vote.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we provide an {{analysis}} of the Commission's proposal of so called <b>double</b> simple <b>majority</b> rule (when to pass a decision simple majority of Member States {{and at the same time}} simple majority of total population has to be reached) for the voting in the Council of Ministers of the EU. In our evaluation we are using an a priori voting power methodology to measure an influence of the Member States before and after extension of the EU. In the closing part of the paper we shortly compare the <b>double</b> simple <b>majority</b> rule to the compromise approved by the 2000 Nice Summit of the EU.

25|$|Opponents {{considered}} unfair {{the idea}} that a small percentage of people could impose new taxes on others. They argued that the <b>double</b> <b>majority</b> rule was necessary to keep this from happening, and claimed that if it were repealed, taxes would rise too much.|$|E
25|$|Ballot Measure 47 was an {{initiative}} in the U.S. state of Oregon that passed in 1996, affecting {{the assessment of}} property taxes and instituting a <b>double</b> <b>majority</b> provision for tax legislation.

However, since the 2007 Treaty of Lisbon, article 15 of Treaty on European Union states that the European Council appoints a full-time president for a two-and-a-half-year term, with the possibility of renewal once.

50|$|This {{mechanism}} {{is used to}} prevent a small group from passing spending measures that affect the entire population {{in order to support}} their pet causes, especially at an election expected to have low voter turnout. <b>Double</b> <b>majorities</b> are also frequently used in municipal annexations, wherein majorities of both the residents in the annexing territory and the territory to be annexed must support the annexation.

The Treaty also made the Union's bill of rights, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, legally binding. The Treaty for the first time gave member states the explicit legal right to leave the EU and the procedure to do so.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} of the council mirrored that of most football leagues in Australia at the time: each affiliated full member league appointed a delegate (or, in the early years, two delegates) to the council to act on its behalf in discussions and votes. The decision making process followed by the council was that delegates would meet, generally every one to three years, to discuss and vote on proposed changes. All changes to on-field or off-field laws needed to be passed by a supermajority vote – this was originally a three-quarters majority, then later became a <b>double</b> <b>majority</b> which required an overall simple majority plus minimum number of the designated major states to vote in favour. The council also elected an executive committee which managed the game's administrative matters.|$|E
