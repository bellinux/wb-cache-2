2500|$|For decades, Marines {{learned a}} variety of martial arts and other methods of hand-to-hand combat, but these were {{irregular}} processes that varied greatly from unit to unit {{and from time to}} time. Eventually, the Corps solidified its various teachings into the LINE combat system, but its inherent inflexibility was evident. In 2001, the Marine Corps initiated a new program, called Marine Corps Martial Arts Program (MCMAP). Due to an expectation that urban and police-type peacekeeping missions would become more common in the 21st century, placing Marines in even closer contact with unarmed civilians, MCMAP was implemented to provide Marines with a larger and more versatile set of less-than-lethal options for controlling hostile, but unarmed individuals. It is also a stated aim of the program to instill and maintain the [...] "Warrior Ethos" [...] within Marines. The Marine Corps Martial Arts program is an eclectic mix of different styles of martial arts melded together and consists of boxing movements, <b>joint</b> <b>locking</b> techniques, opponent weight transfer (Jujitsu), ground grappling (mostly wrestling), bayonet, knife and baton fighting, non-compliance joint manipulations, and blood restriction chokes. Marines begin MCMAP training in boot camp, earning the first of five belts.|$|E
5000|$|In medicine, <b>joint</b> <b>locking</b> is {{a symptom}} of {{pathology}} in a joint. <b>Joint</b> <b>locking</b> is a common symptom of: ...|$|E

50|$|Less preferred, {{but also}} {{effective}} techniques are <b>joint</b> <b>locks.</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>locks</b> {{are not the}} preferred method for attacking an enemy, {{because they do not}} completely disable the enemy. <b>Joints</b> <b>locks</b> do inflict large amounts of pain and can secure compliance from the enemy. This makes them especially useful in controlling opponents during crowd control operations or when someone is being clearly threatening, but the rules of engagement prohibit killing them (if the opponent is easily given to surrender under pain). If compliance cannot be secured or is not desired, the <b>joint</b> <b>lock</b> can be extended fully, breaking the applicable joint. Students are taught the difference between pain that signals a <b>joint</b> <b>lock</b> is in progress and simple discomfort.|$|R
50|$|Small joint manipulation, in grappling, {{refers to}} twisting, pulling or bending fingers or toes to cause <b>joint</b> <b>locks</b> {{in the various}} joints in those appendages. <b>Joint</b> <b>locks</b> on fingers and toes are {{respectively}} referred to as finger locks and toe locks.|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} underactuation is {{increasingly}} applied to hand prostheses because it minimizes {{the number of}} actuators while the fingers are adaptive to the grasped objects. However, current underactuated grasp mechanisms suffer from an intrinsic stability problem which disables them to obtain a pinch grasp, hence they fail to grasp small objects. In an attempt {{to solve this problem}} <b>joint</b> <b>locks</b> are applied to an underactuated pulley-tendon driven hand. <b>Joint</b> <b>locks</b> might also {{have an effect on the}} power grasp strength. Therefore the effect of <b>joint</b> <b>locks</b> on the pinch grasp performance and power grasp strength of underactuated hand prostheses is investigated. This effect is quantified by two grasp performance metrics: the ability to pinch and the ability to hold. To find the optimal <b>joint</b> <b>lock</b> configurations for pinch grasp performance and power grasp strength, the effect of different <b>joint</b> <b>lock</b> configurations on both performance metrics is calculated using a static grasp model. The results of this model are validated by measurements on a prototype. Both the model and the measurements showed that <b>joint</b> <b>locks</b> do not have a significant effect on the pinch grasp performance when only the range of object sizes for which a pinch grasp equilibrium exists is considered. However, the measurements showed that a pinch grasp is more easily established with <b>joint</b> <b>locks.</b> Additionally, both the model and the measurements showed a significant increase in the power grasp strength.

50|$|Kitō-ryū (起倒流) is a {{traditional}} school (koryū) of the Japanese martial art of jujutsu. Its syllabus comprises atemi-waza (striking techniques), nage-waza (throwing techniques), kansetsu-waza (<b>joint</b> <b>locking</b> techniques) and shime-waza (choking techniques). Many of these techniques are performed while in full armor.|$|E
50|$|Common {{martial arts}} {{featuring}} <b>joint</b> <b>locks</b> include Aikido, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Catch Wrestling, Eskrima, Eagle Claw, Fu Jow Pai, Hapkido, Hung Gar, Jujutsu, Judo, Ninjutsu, Shoot wrestling, and mixed martial arts. They are usually practiced in a maximally safe manner, with controlled movements, and releasing the <b>joint</b> <b>lock</b> {{once it is}} apparent that it has been effectively applied. In combat sports, <b>joint</b> <b>locks</b> are used as submission holds, and are intended to force the opponent to submit; the lock will be controlled and held until an opponent submits or a referee recognizes the threat of injury and intervenes. The types of <b>joint</b> <b>locks</b> allowed in competitions featuring them varies according to the perceived danger in their application. Armlocks are generally considered safer, while small joint manipulation and spinal locks are banned in nearly all combat sports.|$|R

5000|$|Some define jujutsu {{and similar}} arts rather {{narrowly}} as [...] "unarmed" [...] close combat systems used to defeat or control an enemy who is similarly unarmed. Basic methods of attack include hitting or striking, thrusting or punching, kicking, throwing, pinning or immobilizing, strangling, and <b>joint</b> <b>locking.</b> Great pains were also {{taken by the}} bushi (classic warriors) to develop effective methods of defense, including parrying or blocking strikes, thrusts and kicks, receiving throws or <b>joint</b> <b>locking</b> techniques (i.e., falling safely and knowing how to [...] "blend" [...] to neutralize a technique's effect), releasing oneself from an enemy's grasp, and changing or shifting one's position to evade or neutralize an attack. As jujutsu is a collective term, some schools or ryu adopted the principle of ju more than others.|$|E
50|$|Clicking, grating, or locking {{may result}} from acute {{mechanical}} problems due to intra-articular bodies within the affected <b>joint.</b> <b>Locking</b> may destroy articular cartilage, resulting in secondary osteoarthritis.

50|$|The common {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of a torn meniscus are knee pain, particularly along the joint line, and swelling. These are worse when the knee bears more weight (for example, when running). Another typical complaint is <b>joint</b> <b>locking,</b> when the affected person is unable to straighten the leg fully. This can be accompanied by a clicking feeling. Sometimes, a meniscal tear also causes a sensation that the knee gives way.|$|E
5000|$|Like most martial arts, hapkido {{employs a}} great number of punches and hand strikes, as well as elbow strikes. A {{distinctive}} example of hapkido hand techniques is [...] "live hand" [...] strike that focuses energy to the baek hwa hyul in the hand, producing energy strikes and internal strikes. The hand strikes are often used to weaken the opponent before <b>joint</b> <b>locking</b> and throwing, and also as finishing techniques.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1800s, two wrestling styles were popular in Beijing, Manchurian/Mongolian wrestling and Pao Ting “fast style” wrestling. The Pao Ting style was quicker than the Manchurian style. As {{soon as the}} {{opponent}} {{came in contact with}} the wrestler, he would be thrown. There was not any grappling, struggling, or tussling as seen in Western wrestling. This wrestling also combined punching, kicking, <b>joint</b> <b>locking</b> and point striking with its throwing techniques.|$|E

50|$|Small joint {{manipulation}} is {{an illegal}} technique in most combat sports that feature <b>joint</b> <b>locking</b> such as Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, judo, mixed martial arts and Sambo, since unlike standard joint locks, {{there is less}} of an opportunity to submit before the small joint breaks. It is however sometimes taught as a self-defense and pain compliance technique, for instance in hapkido, Chin Na, kenpō, jujutsu, Krav Maga, vale tudo and especially in 'Small Circle JuJitsu'.

50|$|The {{techniques}} of Sōsuishi-ryū correspond with other ryūha founded during the Keicho {{and the early}} Edo period of Japan. For example: atemi (striking) is used to distract the enemy; a lack of overly complex <b>joint</b> <b>locking</b> techniques; weapons retention techniques (including the use of both long and short swords); defenses against armed and unarmed enemies; {{and the use of}} defensive and offensive tactics. There are several basic and advanced techniques in Sōsuishi-ryū, such as atemi, ukemi, tai-sabaki, kansetsu-waza and nage-waza. Some aspects are almost identical and directly correlate to those found in Takenouchi-ryū such as: torite, hade, kogusoku and kumi-uchi.|$|E

50|$|Armlocks, {{considered}} {{less dangerous}} techniques in combat sports allowing <b>joint</b> <b>locks,</b> {{are the most}} common <b>joint</b> <b>locks</b> used as submission holds. In training, the method of executing an armlock is generally slow and controlled to give the opponent time to submit prior to any infliction of injury. However, in self-defense applications, or when applied improperly or with excessive force, armlocks can cause muscle, tendon and ligament damage, even dislocation, or bone fractures.|$|R
50|$|<b>Joint</b> <b>locks</b> can {{be applied}} on {{anything}} that bends, such as fingers, wrists, elbows, shoulders or knees. Application of locks might include gaining purchase for throwing techniques, encouraging cooperation, submission, or restraining an aggressor. (Such techniques are taught to police forces.) Locks can also be utilised for interrogation/torture or controlling a prisoner prior to securing him using rope. In modern sporting contests, bouts are often concluded upon a submission resulting from a successful <b>joint</b> <b>lock.</b>|$|R
