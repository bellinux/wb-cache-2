25|$|The frontovik usually carried {{all he had}} in {{a simple}} bag. Most of the frontovik had a perevgzochnii paket (wound {{dressing}} packet), a razor, a shovel and would be very {{lucky to have a}} towel and toothbrush. Toothpaste, shampoo and soap were extremely rare. Usually sticks with chewed ends were used for brushing teeth. To relieve themselves latrine pits were dug, as portable toilets were rare in the Red Army. Soldiers frequently slept outdoors, even during the winter. Food was usually abysmal and often in short supply, especially in 1941 and 1942. The frontoviks detested the rear service troops who did not face the dangers of combat as krysa (rats). The frontovik lived on a diet of black rye bread; canned meats like fish and tushonka (stewed pork); shchi (cabbage soup) and <b>kasha</b> (porridge).”. <b>Kasha</b> and shchi were so common that a popular slogan in the Red Army was “shchi ee <b>kasha,</b> pisha nasha” (“schchi and <b>kasha,</b> that's our fare.”). Chai (hot sugared tea) was an extremely popular beverage together with beer and vodka. Makhorka, a type of cheap tobacco roiled in handmade cigarettes was the standard cigarette.|$|E

25|$|Buckwheat groats are {{commonly}} used in western Asia and eastern Europe. The porridge was common, and is often considered the definitive peasant dish. It is made from roasted groats that are cooked with broth to a texture similar to rice or bulgur. The dish was brought to America by Ukrainian, Russian, and Polish immigrants who called it <b>kasha,</b> and they mixed it with pasta or {{used it as a}} filling for cabbage rolls, knishes, and blintzes, hence buckwheat prepared in this fashion is most commonly called <b>kasha</b> in America. Groats were the most widely used form of buckwheat worldwide during the 20th century, eaten primarily in Estonia, Russia, Ukraine, and Poland, called grechka in Ukrainian or Russian. The groats can also be sprouted and then eaten raw or cooked.|$|E

50|$|A {{corollary}} of <b>Kasha's</b> rule is the Vavilov rule, {{which states}} that the quantum yield of luminescence is generally independent of the excitation wavelength. This {{can be understood as}} a consequence of the tendency - implied by <b>Kasha's</b> rule - for molecules in upper states to relax to the lowest excited state non-radiatively.

25|$|Porridge {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} dishes in the traditional Russian cuisine. Variety of cereals is based on variety of local crops. In Russian, the word <b>kasha</b> refers to any kind of porridge. Russian people have learned to do several varieties of cereals from whole grains to a variety of ways. The most popular cereals are buckwheat, millet, semolina, oats, barley, and rice. These cereals are traditionally cooked in milk, especially for breakfast. People add butter, salt, and sugar to taste.|$|E
25|$|The {{first report}} of the haploid plant was {{published}} by Blakeslee et al. (1922) in Datura stramonium. Subsequently, haploids were reported in many other species. Guha and Maheshwari (1964) developed an anther culture technique {{for the production of}} haploids in the laboratory. Haploid production by wide crossing was reported in barley (<b>Kasha</b> and Kao, 1970) and tobacco (Burk et al., 1979). Tobacco, rapeseed, and barley are the most responsive species for doubled haploid production. Doubled haploid methodologies have now been applied to over 250 species.|$|E
25|$|Polish cuisine {{has evolved}} over the centuries to become very eclectic due to Poland's history. Polish cuisine shares many {{similarities}} with other Central European cuisines, especially German and Austrian as well as Jewish, Belarusian, Ukrainian, Russian, French and Italian culinary traditions. It is rich in meat, especially pork, chicken and beef (depending on the region) and winter vegetables (cabbage in the dish bigos), and spices. It is also characteristic in its use of various kinds of noodles the most notable of which are kluski as well as cereals such as <b>kasha</b> (from the Polish word kasza). Polish cuisine is hearty and uses a lot of cream and eggs. Festive meals such as the meatless Christmas Eve dinner (Wigilia) or Easter breakfast could take days to prepare in their entirety.|$|E

25|$|On 31 August Sudan's army {{reported}} that 3 Russian helicopter crew members had been abducted by gunmen in Nyala, capital of South Darfur, {{just hours after}} Samaritan's Purse aid worker Flavia Wagner who had been kidnapped 18 May was set free.

The governor of South Darfur, Abdel Hamid <b>Kasha,</b> Sudan foreign ministry spokesman Moawiya Osman and Samaritan's Purse’s leader Franklin Graham, and the Russian ambassador to Chad welcomed Flavia’s release, but condemned the kidnap of the three Russians and that of two Jordanian UNAMID police advisers in Darfur, on the 14th. Another Russian helicopter pilot was taken prisoner for four days after landing in South Darfur to take rebels' spokesmen to Chad for alleged peace talks.|$|E
500|$|At {{the age of}} 16, she got a lucky break {{because of}} {{a visit to a}} podiatrist. The doctor had an office at Broadway and 42nd Street, in what had been a fashionable Knickerbocker Hotel suite in the early 1900s, the New York {{residence}} of opera singer Enrico Caruso (1873–1921). So the doctor would often entertain visitors who were there to see the Caruso memorabilia. While she herself was at the office, November met another patient who had contacts in the music industry, and she sang an impromptu audition. The patient was impressed, and put her in touch with one of his contacts, manager Gus Schirmer (of the Schirmer Music publishing family), who was looking for [...] "pretty sopranos" [...] for his summer musicals. Schirmer introduced her to Broadway composer Richard Rodgers, who became her mentor, and through Schirmer, November also auditioned for other producers such as Lawrence <b>Kasha.</b> She obtained work as a performer in the 1963 summer musical season in Dallas, Texas, but despite many auditions, could never land a job in Broadway theatre (according to November, this was because she never had the exact look that a particular show was looking for). [...] Then Schirmer got her a job singing at an industrial musical for Ford Motor Company, where she met many other successful musicians, singers, and composers such as Ray Charles. He began incorporating her into sessions with the Ray Charles Singers, a group of performers with a rotating membership that would sing in close harmonies, often on productions with singer and television personality Perry Como, or as backup singers for other recordings. This launched November's career as a studio singer, as she worked on a contract basis for many different productions. From 1962 to 1967 November would rotate in and out as part of the Ray Charles Singers, sometimes seen on Perry Como's Kraft Music Hall variety program. She can also be heard as a backup singer on some Frank Sinatra recordings, such as the soprano voice in the background of the 1967 song, [...] "The World We Knew".|$|E

25|$|The dipolar {{nature of}} the ground state is {{reflected}} in its deep colour, which is unusual for small unsaturated aromatic compounds. Another notable feature of azulene is that it violates <b>Kasha's</b> rule by exhibiting fluorescence from an upper-excited state (S2 → S0).|$|R
50|$|<b>Kasha's</b> rule {{stipulates}} that higher singlet states would quickly relax by radiationless decay or internal conversion (IC) to S1. Thus, S1 is usually, but not always, the only relevant singlet excited state.

25|$|<b>Kasha's</b> rule {{dictates}} that the quantum yield of luminescence {{is independent of}} the wavelength of exciting radiation.

2500|$|Shchi (cabbage soup) {{had been}} the {{predominant}} first course in Russian cuisine for over a thousand years. Although tastes have changed, it steadily made its way through several epochs. Shchi knew no social class boundaries, {{and even if the}} rich had richer ingredients and the poor made it solely of cabbage and onions, all these [...] "poor" [...] and [...] "rich" [...] variations were cooked in the same tradition. The unique taste of this cabbage soup was from the fact that after cooking it was left to draw (stew) in a Russian stove. The [...] "Spirit of shchi" [...] was inseparable from a Russian izba (log hut). Many Russian proverbs are connected to this soup, such as Shchi da <b>kasha</b> pishcha nasha ( [...] , [...] "Shchi and porridge are our staples").

2500|$|<b>Kasha</b> (Mandarin: jiǎjiè) are rebuses, {{sometimes}} called [...] "phonetic loans". The etymology {{of the characters}} follows one of the patterns above, but the present-day meaning is completely unrelated to this. A character was appropriated to represent a similar-sounding word. For example, [...] in ancient Chinese was originally a pictograph for [...] "wheat". Its syllable was homophonous with the verb meaning [...] "to come", and the character is used for that verb as a result, without any embellishing [...] "meaning" [...] element attached. The character for wheat , originally meant [...] "to come", being a keisei moji having 'foot' at the bottom for its meaning part and [...] "wheat" [...] at the top for sound. The two characters swapped meaning, so today the more common word has the simpler character. This borrowing of sounds has a very long history.|$|E
5000|$|Exceptions to <b>Kasha's</b> rule {{arise when}} there are large energy gaps between excited states. An example is azulene: the {{classical}} {{explanation is that the}} S1 and S2 states lie sufficiently far apart that fluorescence is observed mostly from S2. [...] However, recent research has put forward that {{this may not be the}} case, and that fluorescence is seen from S2 because of crossing in the N-dimensional potential surface allowing very fast internal conversion from S1 to S0.|$|R
