6000|$|... "That I {{fell out}} of the machine?" [...] cried Dick. [...] "There is some mistake here. I have had no fall. When <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> about me?" [...] asked Mollie, {{changing}} cows. Murray {{discovered that}} she was tall and that the big blue print apron shrouded a singularly graceful figure.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you want}} to find that out, you must get it through Florence. You may be quite sure I shall tell her; and I suppose I may be quite sure <b>she</b> will <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b> <b>Does</b> <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> everything?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Fairbrother's countenance fell; {{but with}} that ready {{presence}} of mind, {{which is as}} useful in civil as in military emergencies, he immediately rallied.--"Nothing? True; you mean nothing at first--but when you asked her again, <b>did</b> <b>she</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what ailed her?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>did</b> <b>she</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>you?</b> {{that was}} strange; for my part, I {{never thought of}} {{adverting}} to the subject; when one has {{so many things to}} attend to, one is apt to forget little incidents that are not of primary importance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{since you}} speak of him---- I hadn't meant to, unless you did. I want {{to be fair to}} him. What <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> about him?" [...] Jeff asked confidentially.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, my dear friend; {{and perhaps}} I shall {{ask you to}} help me out of mine before I have done. But never mind that now. What <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> about the adventure?' ...|$|E
6000|$|Cecilia {{shook her}} head. [...] "Thinking, Francine, {{of the new}} life before her--and regretting, I am afraid, that she ever confided her hopes and wishes to me. <b>Did</b> <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> last night what her {{prospects}} are when she leaves school?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Aye, that I <b>did!</b> <b>She</b> wouldn't <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b> There'll be many a {{thing in}} life <b>she</b> won't <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b> I went to let her hear from my lips what I thought {{of her as a}} wife for you. I told her what I thought of a woman who plays the part of a wanton--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wot!" [...] screams Mrs. Prince, {{jumping up}} and waving her arms about. [...] "Wot! Go your own way; I’ll have nothing {{more to do with}} you. And don’t blame me for {{anything}} that happens. It’s a very bad thing to come to a witch for advice and then not to <b>do</b> as <b>she</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you.</b> You ought to know that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was here, in this lane, that I {{was with}} her last, and wished her good-by. <b>She</b> <b>did</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> of my having parted with her, then?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mother Anastasia is very sensible," [...] said I, [...] "and if I were to see her, I {{should be}} happy to express my {{appreciation}} of her good advice upon the subject. And, by the way, <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{that it was necessary}} to wear that hot bonnet while you are working?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Did {{she tell}} you that the poor {{stranger}} was young and pretty-faced, with black moustarches? that his store clothes must have cost a fortin, saying nothing of his gold-lined, broadcloth sarrapper? Did she say that his horse was so lame that when I went to get another he wouldn't WAIT for it? <b>Did</b> <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> WHO he was?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know--I know," [...] {{cried the}} Count, with a troubled look, {{as he passed}} his hand across his brow. [...] "I might have {{expected}} it. She cannot sustain the misery I have brought on her. Oh! why was I prevented from freeing her from such a father. Is she very ill? Did she send for me? <b>Did</b> <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what I am?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I will go {{with you}} certainly, if you wish it," [...] Paul answered, not too cordially, for he did not wish his brother {{to know that it}} was what he had already planned to <b>do.</b> [...] "Did <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that we had already a slight acquaintance?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Lance, [...] "my dear fellow! You {{have stood}} it wisely and bravely so far, {{go on to}} do so. I don't feel the least certain {{that this is not}} mere bullying. <b>She</b> <b>did</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> any particulars?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ay,' murmured {{the sick}} woman, {{relapsing}} into her former drowsy state, 'what about her?--what about--I know!' she cried, jumping fiercely up: her face flushed, {{and her eyes}} starting from her head--'I robbed her, so I <b>did!</b> <b>She</b> wasn't cold--I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>she</b> wasn't cold, when I stole it!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} had, indeed! And {{it will be}} a good thing for you both to have the time for {{clarifying}} your ideas. <b>Did</b> <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> she had been at matins this morning?" [...] A light of laughter trembled in Mrs. Pasmer's eyes, and Mavering could not keep a responsive gleam out of his own. In an instant the dedication of his engagement by morning prayer ceased to be a high and solemn thought, and became deliciously amusing; and this laughing Alice over with her mother did more to realise {{the fact that she was}} his than anything else had yet done.|$|E
60|$|Have we not {{all such}} closets, my jolly friend, {{as well as}} the noble Marquis of Carabas? At night, when all the house is asleep but you, don't you get up and peep into yours? When you in your turn are slumbering, up gets Mrs. Brown from your side, steals downstairs like Amina to her ghoul, clicks open the secret door, and looks into her dark depository. <b>Did</b> <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> of that little affair with Smith long before she knew you? Psha! who knows any one save himself alone? Who, in showing his house to the closest and dearest, doesn't keep back the key of a closet or two? I think of a lovely reader laying down the page and looking over at her {{unconscious}} husband, asleep, perhaps, after dinner. Yes, madam, a closet he hath: and you, who pry into everything, shall never have the key of it. I think of some honest Othello pausing over this very sentence in a railroad carriage, and stealthily gazing at Desdemona opposite to him, innocently administering sandwiches to their little boy--I am trying to turn off the sentence with a joke, you see--I feel it is growing too dreadful, too serious.|$|E
6000|$|... “Oh, {{you know}} about the goats. My dear young Monsieur, I could never tell when she would fling over her pretended {{sweetness}} and put her tongue out at me. <b>Did</b> <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> about a boy, the son of pious and rich parents, whom she tried to lead astray into the wildness of thoughts like her own, till the poor dear child drove her off because she outraged his modesty? I saw him often with his parents at Sunday mass. The grace of God preserved him and made him quite a gentleman in Paris. Perhaps it will touch Rita’s heart, too, some day. But she was awful then. When I wouldn’t listen to her complaints she would say: ‘All right, sister, I would just as soon go clothed in rain and wind.’ And such a bag of bones, too, like the picture of a devil’s imp. Ah, my dear young Monsieur, you don’t know how wicked her heart is. You aren’t bad enough for that yourself. I don’t believe you are evil at all in your innocent little heart. I never heard you jeer at holy things. You are only thoughtless. For instance, I have never seen you make {{the sign of the cross}} in the morning. Why don’t you make a practice of crossing yourself directly you open your eyes. It’s a very good thing. It keeps Satan off for the day.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Grace, bitterly, [...] "I speak them, as {{the parrot}} repeats words {{that he does}} not understand. But Eve Effingham has used these {{languages}} as means, and <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> merely what such a phrase or idiom signifies, but what the greatest writers have thought and written." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, I believe that,' {{she replied}} scornfully; and then, {{gathering}} up her anger, 'D'you {{mean to say}} {{you expect me to}} have her in the house after what <b>she's</b> <b>done?</b> I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> I won't. <b>She's</b> never coming in this house again as long as I live; I'm an honest woman and she isn't. She's a--' Mrs Griffith called her daughter the foulest name that can be applied to her sex.|$|R

"They {{seem to be}} coming," [...] said he, {{speaking}} as calmly as he could, [...] "but we have discovered them in good time, and I shall have some shots at them before they reach here. Let us {{hope that they will}} never get here at all. You two," [...] said he to Mrs. Cliff and Ralph, [...] "are to be under command of Miss Markham. You must <b>do</b> exactly what <b>she</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> to." [...] Then, turning to Edna, he said, [...] "You have your pistol ready?" ...|$|R

In 1978 he moved to Germany performing in folk clubs in Stuttgart and Heidelberg. Moving to West Berlin in 1979, he studied Music Theory at the Hochschule der Kunstler, learnt German, {{and worked as a}} Studio manager and music producer in Recordland, and Musik World Recording Studios. He went on to form the pop music group The Missing Passengers and securing a recording contract with Arista/Ariola, Munich. Achieving success with two original albums in the European Charts. In 1985 the group performed Kiev's hit song <b>Did</b> <b>She</b> <b>Tell</b> <b>You</b> on both the Extratour program Radio Bremen/ARD, and the Musik Convoy program on WDR/ARD.In 1989 Kiev Connolly and The Missing Passengers represented Ireland at the Eurovision Song Contest in Lausanne, Switzerland with Kiev's song The Real Me.

6000|$|... "But if <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that I {{wanted to}} marry her {{for the sake of}} her money, and that she refused me indignantly and scornfully (you need neither start nor blush; nor yet need you prick your {{trembling}} fingers with your needle. That is the plain truth, {{whether you like it or}} not)--if such was not the subject of her august confidences, on what point did they turn? You say you talked the whole night through; what about?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My wife!" [...] the {{sergeant}} exclaimed passionately. [...] "I {{have not seen}} or heard of her for fifteen years. So she came down and told you that. She is a bad lot, {{if ever there was}} one. And so she told you you were my son? You may be, lad, for aught I know; and I should be well content to know that it was so. But what <b>did</b> <b>she</b> come and <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that for? What game is she up to now? I always knew she was up to some mischief. What was her motive in coming down to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that? Just let me know what she said." ...|$|R
5000|$|Famously demanding, with an {{attention}} to detail that sometimes drove costars and directors mad, Dunaway believed she was often mistaken for being as cold and calculating {{as some of the}} women she portrayed. Her clashes with Roman Polanski on the set of Chinatown earned her a reputation for being difficult to work with. Upon the release of the film, Polanski told a reporter for Rolling Stone that he considered Dunaway [...] "a gigantic pain in the ass,” but added that he had [...] "never known an actress to take work as seriously as <b>she</b> <b>does.</b> I <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> <b>she</b> is a maniac.” Bette Davis described Dunaway as the worst person she had ever worked with in an interview with Johnny Carson in 1988, calling her [...] "totally impossible", [...] "uncooperative', and [...] "very unprofessional". Dunaway denied Davis' claims in her autobiography, writing [...] "Watching her, all I could think of was that she seemed like someone caught in a death throe, a final scream against a fate over which no one has control. I was just the target of her blind rage at the one sin Hollywood never forgives in its leading ladies growing old." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Lady,' he said, 'listen. To-night, {{perhaps one}} hour after sundown, perhaps two, perhaps three, Nombe will lead you, {{dressed in a}} certain fashion, from this hut. See now, outside of it there is a tongue of rock up which you may climb unnoted by the little path that runs between those big stones. Look,' and he showed me the place through the door-hole. 'The path ends on a flat boulder {{at the end of}} the rock. There you will take your stand, holding in your right hand a little assegai which will be given to you. Nombe will not {{accompany}} you to the rock, but she will crouch between the stones at the head of the path and perhaps from time to time whisper to you what to <b>do.</b> Thus when <b>she</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you,</b> you must throw the little spear into the air, so that it falls among a number of men gathered in debate who will be seated about twenty paces from the rock. For the rest you are to stand quite still, saying nothing and showing no alarm whatever you may hear or see. Among the men before you may be your friend, Macumazahn, but you must not appear to recognize him, and if he speaks to you, you must make no answer. Even if he should seem to shoot at you, do not be afraid. Do you understand? If so, repeat what I have told you.' I obeyed him and asked what would happen if I did not do these things, or some of them.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wrote to}} her {{on the subject of the}} last {{conversation}} we had together," [...] Frank resumed, in rather a timid voice, [...] "the day before my accident. Perhaps <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> ma'am, of what passed between us. We had had a quarrel; one of many. Some cowardly hand, which we both of us can guess at, had written to her an account of my past life, and she showed me the letter. Then I told her, that if she loved me she never would have showed it me: without any other words of reproof. I bade her farewell. It was not much, the showing that letter; but it was enough. In twenty differences we have had together, she had been unjust and captious, cruel towards me, and too eager, as I thought, for other people's admiration. Had she loved me, it seemed to me Ethel would have shown less vanity and better temper. What was I to expect in life afterwards from a girl who before her marriage used me so? Neither she nor I could be happy. She could be gentle enough, and kind, and anxious to please any man whom she loves, God bless her! As for me, I suppose, I'm not worthy of so much talent and beauty, so we both understood that that was a friendly farewell; and as I have been lying on my bed yonder, thinking, perhaps, I never might leave it, or if I did, that I should like to lead a different sort of life to that which ended in sending me there, my resolve of last month was only confirmed. God forbid that she and I should lead the lives of some folks we know; that Ethel should marry without love, perhaps to fall into it afterwards; and that I, after this awful warning I have had, should be tempted to back into that dreary life I was leading. It was wicked, ma'am, I knew it was; many and many a day I used to say so to myself, and longed to get rid of it. I am a poor weak devil, I know, I am only too easily led into temptation, and I should only make matters worse if I married a woman who cares for the world more than for me, and would not make me happy at home." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{know the}} affection {{you have always}} entertained for Iris. <b>She</b> will <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what <b>she</b> pleases about the past. If <b>she</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> nothing about her late husband, think the worst and {{you will not be}} wrong.

6000|$|Having {{to speak}} of stature, <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that her {{gigantic}} Angel was as tall as Pompey's Pillar; much less that he was twelve cubits, or twelve hundred cubits high; or that his dimensions equalled those of Teneriffe or Atlas;--because these, {{and if they were}} a million times as high it would be the same, are bounded: The expression is, 'His stature reached the sky!' the illimitable firmament!--When the Imagination frames a comparison, if it does not strike on the first presentation, a sense of the truth of the likeness, from the moment that it is perceived, grows--and continues to grow--upon the mind; the resemblance depending less upon outline of form and feature, than upon expression and effect; less upon casual and outstanding, than upon inherent and internal, properties: moreover, the images invariably modify each other.--The law under which the processes of Fancy are carried on is as capricious as the accidents of things, and the effects are surprising, playful, ludicrous, amusing, tender, or pathetic, as the objects happen to be appositely produced or fortunately combined. Fancy depends upon the rapidity and profusion with which she scatters her thoughts and images; trusting that their number, and the felicity with which they are linked together, will make amends for the want of individual value: or she prides herself upon the curious subtilty and the successful elaboration with which she can detect their lurking affinities. If she can win you over to her purpose, and impart to you her feelings, she cares not how unstable or transitory may be her influence, knowing that it will not be out of her power to resume it upon an apt occasion. But the Imagination is conscious of an indestructible dominion;--the Soul may fall away from it, not being able to sustain its grandeur; but, if once felt and acknowledged, by no act of any other faculty of the mind can it be relaxed, impaired, or diminished.--Fancy is given to quicken and to beguile the temporal part of our nature, Imagination to incite and to support the eternal.--Yet is it not the less true that Fancy, as she is an active, is also, under her own laws and in her own spirit, a creative faculty. In what manner Fancy ambitiously aims at a rivalship with Imagination, and Imagination stoops to work with materials of Fancy, might be illustrated from the compositions of all eloquent writers, whether in prose or verse; and chiefly from those of our own Country. Scarcely a page of the impassioned parts of Bishop Taylor's Works can be opened that shall not afford examples.--Referring the Reader to those inestimable volumes, I will content myself with placing a conceit (ascribed to Lord Chesterfield) in contrast with a passage from the 'Paradise Lost:'-- ...|$|R
