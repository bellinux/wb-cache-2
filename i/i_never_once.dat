500|$|... "Mmm Papi" [...] is a latin pop {{song that}} lasts {{for three minutes}} and twenty-two seconds. The song has dancehall {{elements}} and a 1960s go-go vibe, and incorporates into its melody handclaps and a rock guitar. Anna Dimond of TV Guide perceived influences of Madonna's [...] "La Isla Bonita" [...] (1987) in the song, and called it an [...] "ode to the tropical life (and perhaps its masculine fruits)". It {{has been suggested that}} its lyrics deal with either her father Jamie Spears or paparazzi [...] However, this was denied by Morier, who said [...] "the song is definitely not about Adnan and in the whole time I worked with [...] last spring and summer <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>once</b> saw that guy." [...] Morier described [...] "Mmm Papi" [...] as a fun upbeat song, while saying the title [...] "came out of [...] Mmm Papa Luv U." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Dylan Kickham described the song as a [...] "bizarre attempt at combining Latin pop with ’60s psychedelic soul".|$|E
500|$|Rudolph Schnaubelt (1863–1901) was {{an activist}} and the brother-in law of Michael Schwab. He {{was at the}} Haymarket when the bomb exploded. Schnaubelt was indicted with the other {{defendants}} but fled the city and later the country before he could be brought to trial. He was the detectives' lead suspect, and state witness Gilmer testified he saw Schnaubelt throw the bomb, identifying him from a photograph in court. Schnaubelt later sent two letters from London disclaiming all responsibility, writing, [...] "If I had really thrown this bomb, surely I would have {{nothing to be ashamed}} of, but in [...] truth <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>once</b> thought of it." [...] He is the most generally accepted and widely known suspect and figured as the bomb thrower in The Bomb, Frank Harris's 1908 fictionalization of the tragedy. Written from Schnaubelt's point of view, the story opens with him confessing on his deathbed. However, Harris's description was fictional and those who knew Schnaubelt vehemently criticized the book.|$|E
500|$|Walpole {{is quite}} taken by this {{tradition}} and mentions it in several letters to his friends. [...] In {{a letter to}} the Countess of Ailesbury (Lady Caroline Campbell, daughter of John Campbell, 4th Duke of Argyll and widow of Charles Bruce, 4th Earl of Elgin and 3rd Earl of Ailesbury but by this stage married to Hon. H. S. Conway), Walpole with tongue firmly in cheek berates her for not having come to Whichnoure to claim the flitch: [...] "Are you not ashamed, Madam, never to have put in your claim? It is above a year and a day that you have been married, and <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>once</b> heard either of you mention a journey to Whichnoure." [...] Describing the location and explaining why the flitch no longer gets claimed, he writes [...] "... it is a little paradise, and the more like an antique one, as, by all I have said, the married couples seem to be driven out of it." [...] Walpole concludes, [...] "If you love a prospect, or bacon, you will certainly come hither." ...|$|E

500|$|Howlett, like Janet, is Deaf. Unlike Howlett, however, Janet is [...] "quite passive, quiet, {{sweet and}} {{generally}} happy looking after people, especially her boss". As Janet sings, Howlett faced a particular acting challenge. She possesses, she explained, [...] "very little {{understanding of what}} constitutes music, and no idea at all about things like keys, pitch or melody – I even struggle {{with the concept of}} 'high' and 'low' sounds". The song Janet sings—"Only You" [...] by Yazoo—was particularly challenging. Howlett sought help from the composer John Chambers, with whom she had previously worked, and with his help, learnt the song's rhythm and then placed the lyrics relative to it. Chambers then produced a [...] "board of 'tune'", with words sung with a high note placed physically higher on the board, and Howlett tried various methods to train herself to sing different pitches. The whole process took a considerable amount of time, but [...] "In the end, it paid off, because I got the role. It {{was one of the best}} and most welcoming sets I've been on, especially in mainstream filming. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>once</b> felt like a token Deaf, which is rare and beautiful." ...|$|E
2500|$|On Monday, 26 February 2007, Ullrich retired. At {{the press}} conference in Hamburg he said, [...] "Today, I'm ending my career as a {{professional}} cyclist. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>once</b> cheated as a cyclist." [...] He {{said he would be}} an advisor to Team Volksbank.|$|E
2500|$|Sailors of the {{day were}} {{notoriously}} against innovation, and at first the men would not eat the sauerkraut. Cook used a [...] "method <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>once</b> knew to fail with seamen." [...] He ordered it served to himself and the officers, and left an option for crew who wanted some. Within a week of seeing their superiors set a value on it the demand was so great a ration had to be instituted. In other cases, however, Cook was required to resort to traditional naval discipline. [...] "Punished Henry Stephens, Seaman, and Thomas Dunster, Marine, with twelve lashes each for refusing to take their allowance of fresh beef." ...|$|E
60|$|Before I summoned Pesca to my {{assistance}} {{it was necessary}} to see for myself what sort of man I had to deal with. Up to this time <b>I</b> had <b>never</b> <b>once</b> set eyes on Count Fosco.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, for two months, count, {{this good}} fellow never {{took off his}} coat; and I don't think he ever slept an hour at a time. <b>I</b> have <b>never</b> <b>once</b> called {{when he was not}} there to answer." ...|$|R

2500|$|He {{wrote that}} many of his critics mischaracterize the {{argument}} he puts forth in his essay {{in a manner similar to}} what Rosenfeld wrote was an erroneous portrayal in The New York Times. He explains: [...] "Since <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>once</b> referred to 'liberalism', called no one a 'Jewish anti-Semite' or 'self-hating Jew', said nothing about Democrats or the Iraq war, and made no attempt to 'silence' anyone, this Kafkaesque bill of indictment makes me wonder what is at play here – illiteracy, dishonesty, or worse? As Bret Stephens recently put it, 'How does joining a debate become an effort to suppress it?' Rosenfeld denied it, stating that, [...] "Nobody's being silenced.... I think its a red herring to talk about silencing, this debate in fact is evidence of a robust and open discussion".|$|E
2500|$|In August 1968, {{their first}} album Truth was released; by October it {{had risen to}} number 15 on the US albums chart but failed to chart in the UK. The album {{featured}} Beck's masterly guitar technique and manipulated sounds as Stewart's dramatic vocalising tackled the group's varied repertoire of blues, folk, rock, and proto-heavy metal. Stewart also co-wrote three of the songs, and credited the record for helping to develop his vocal abilities and the sandpaper quality in his voice. The group toured America again {{at the end of}} the year to a very strong reception, then suffered from more personnel upheaval (something that would continue throughout Beck's career). In July 1969, Stewart left, following his friend Wood's departure. Stewart later recalled: [...] "It was a great band to sing with but I couldn't take all the aggravation and unfriendliness that developed.... In the two and a half years I was with Beck <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>once</b> looked him in the eye – I always looked at his shirt or something like that." ...|$|E

6000|$|About my {{coming to}} Europe, I {{get more and}} more doubtful, and rather incline to Ceylon again as place of meeting. I am so absurdly well here in the tropics, that it seems like affectation. Yet {{remember}} <b>I</b> have <b>never</b> <b>once</b> stood Sydney. [...] Anyway, I shall have the money for it all ahead, before I think of such a thing.|$|R
6000|$|At this {{a sudden}} gush of shame welled up in {{me at the}} thought that through all my {{troubles}} <b>I</b> had <b>never</b> <b>once</b> remembered the kindnesses of my step-grandfather; that he, too, might be dead. I was so rapt away by the thought that I caught only the last three words of Miss Bullace's murmured aside to Lady Pollacke, viz., [...] "not blush unseen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Dear Joe,' said Dolly, 'I {{always loved}} you--in {{my own heart}} I always did, {{although}} I was so vain and giddy. I hoped you would come back that night. I made quite sure you would. I prayed for it on my knees. Through all these long, long years, <b>I</b> have <b>never</b> <b>once</b> forgotten you, or left off hoping that this happy time might come.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 102. And {{now let me}} {{tell you}} {{something}} of his personal character. You have heard him spoken of as ill-natured, and jealous of his brother artists. I will tell you how jealous he was. I knew him for ten years, and during that time had much familiar intercourse with him. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>once</b> heard him say an unkind thing of a brother artist, and <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>once</b> heard him find a fault with another man's work. I could say this of no other artist whom I have ever known.|$|E

60|$|I was, from {{my first}} {{entering}} into {{the knowledge of}} public matters, and have ever been to this day, a sincere lover of the constitution of my country; zealous for liberty and the protestant interest; but a constant follower of moderate principles, a vigorous opposer of hot measures in all parties. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>once</b> changed my opinion, my principles, or my party: and let what will be said of changing sides, this I maintain, that <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>once</b> deviated from the revolution principles, nor from the doctrine of liberty and property on which it was founded.|$|E
60|$|Nevertheless, I went to Prince Edward Island. In all my {{eighteen}} years <b>I</b> had <b>never</b> <b>once</b> disobeyed Father. He {{is a very}} hard man to disobey. I knew I should {{have to make a}} beginning some time if I wanted to marry Mark, so I saved all my little courage up for that and didn't waste any of it opposing the visit to Aunt Philippa.|$|R
6000|$|Knight showed himself keenly hurt at this. 'Stephen, {{those words}} are untrue and unworthy of any man, {{and they are}} unworthy of you. You know you wrong me.
