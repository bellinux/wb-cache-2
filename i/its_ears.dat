5|$|The bat has a {{distinctive}} swollen, pig-like snout with thin, vertical nostrils. <b>Its</b> <b>ears</b> are relatively large, while its eyes {{are small and}} mostly concealed by fur. Its teeth are typical of an insectivorous bat. The dental formula is 1:1:1:3 in the upper jaw and 2:1:2:3 in the lower jaw, with large upper incisors.|$|E
5|$|Giant otter muzzles {{are short}} and sloping {{and give the}} head a ball-shaped appearance. The ears are small and rounded. The nose (or rhinarium) is {{completely}} covered in fur, with only the two slit-like nostrils visible. The giant otter's highly sensitive whiskers (vibrissae) allow the animal to track changes in water pressure and currents, which aids in detecting prey. The legs are short and stubby and end in large webbed feet tipped with sharp claws. Well suited for an aquatic life, it can close <b>its</b> <b>ears</b> and nose while underwater.|$|E
5|$|The {{temperament}} of the West Highland White Terrier {{can vary}} greatly, with some being friendly towards children, whilst others prefer solitude. It {{will not tolerate}} rough handling such as a child pulling on <b>its</b> <b>ears,</b> and can be both food- and toy-possessive. It is normally independent, assured, and self-confident, and can make a good watchdog. It is a loyal breed that bonds with its owner, but is often always on the move, requiring good exercise (15–30 min). The Westie is highly social and is the most friendly and jolly of all the Scottish breeds of terriers.|$|E

5|$|Equines {{produce a}} number of vocalizations and noises. Loud {{snorting}} is associated with alarm. Squealing is usually made when in pain, but bachelors will also squeal while play fighting. The contact calls of equines vary from the whinnying and nickering of the horse, the barking of plains zebras, and the braying of asses and Grévy's zebras. Equines also communicate with visual displays and the flexibility of their lips allows them to make complex facial expressions. Visual displays also incorporate {{the positions of the}} head, ears and tail. An equine may signal an intention to kick by laying back <b>its</b> <b>ears</b> and sometimes lashing the tail. Flattened ears, bared teeth and abrupt movement of the heads may be used as threatening gestures, particularly among stallions.|$|E
5|$|Past {{experiences}} {{or general}} knowledge {{is often called}} upon in conversation, {{so it is a}} useful context for children to learn words. Recalling past experiences allows the child to call upon their own visual, tactical, oral, and/or auditory references. For example, if a child once went to a zoo and saw an elephant, but did not know the word elephant, an adult could later help the child recall this event, describing the size and color of the animal, how big <b>its</b> <b>ears</b> were, its trunk, and the sound it made, then using the word elephant to refer to the animal. Calling upon prior knowledge is used not only in conversation, but often in book reading as well to help explain what is happening in a story by relating it back to the child's own experiences.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} types of canine ear infections {{are caused by}} microorganisms, {{including}} yeast and bacterial infections. The most common variety of this is Malassezia pachydermatitis. Symptoms can include the dog shaking its head or scratching at <b>its</b> <b>ears</b> more frequently. The ear canal will appear inflamed, a pus-like substance will be discharged in some cases, and the ear will smell quite pungent in most cases. Treatment for the more common causes of otitis externa in dogs often includes oral antibiotics and flushing the ears with an antibacterial solution. In some cases, anti-inflammatory medication is prescribed. Some conditions can increase the chance of ear infections, including living in a humid environment and frequent swimming or bathing without adequate drying of the ear afterwards. Keeping {{the hair on the}} ears short {{can be used as a}} preventative method to ear problems.|$|E

5|$|Two thick {{folds of}} skin {{encircle}} the body {{behind the front}} legs and before the hind legs. The rhino has a smaller fold of skin around its neck. The skin itself is thin, , and in the wild, the rhino appears to have no subcutaneous fat. Hair can range from dense (the most dense hair in young calves) to scarce, and is usually a reddish brown. In the wild, this hair is hard to observe because the rhinos are often covered in mud. In captivity, however, the hair grows out and becomes much shaggier, likely because of less abrasion from walking through vegetation. The rhino has a patch of long hair around <b>its</b> <b>ears</b> and a thick clump of hair {{at the end of}} its tail. Like all rhinos, they have very poor vision. The Sumatran rhinoceros is fast and agile; it climbs mountains easily and comfortably traverses steep slopes and riverbanks.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{the cane}} toad, which secretes a {{poisonous}} liquid from glands in <b>its</b> <b>ears,</b> has also {{appeared on the}} island. In order to prevent further contamination of Iriomote, residents of Ishigaki Island began extermination measures in 2008.|$|E
25|$|When {{trade and}} tourism produce a {{confluence}} of cultures, bringing differing sensibilities regarding blackface into contact with one another, {{the results can be}} jarring. When Japanese toymaker Sanrio Corporation exported a darky-icon character doll (the doll, Bibinba, had fat, pink lips and rings in <b>its</b> <b>ears)</b> in the 1990s, the ensuing controversy prompted Sanrio to halt production.|$|E

25|$|The {{animal is}} easily {{identified}} by its markings, {{most notably the}} light-colored patch that extends from its shoulders to its rear end. The rest of its hair is black, except for the tips of <b>its</b> <b>ears,</b> which, as with other tapirs, are rimmed with white. This pattern is for camouflage; the disrupted coloration {{makes it more difficult}} to recognize it as a tapir, and other animals may mistake it for a large rock rather than prey when it is lying down to sleep.|$|E
25|$|The most iconic {{aspect of}} the Papillon is <b>its</b> <b>ears</b> which are large and well fringed, giving them a {{butterfly}} wing-like appearance. Papillons are particolored or white with patches of any color. An all-white dog or a dog with no white is disqualified from the conformation show ring. A blaze (area of white extending down between the eyes) and noseband is preferred over a solid-colored head, but not required. Nose, eye rims, and lips should be black. Paw pads vary in color from black to pink, depending on the coloring of the dog.|$|E
25|$|The pig {{was moving}} <b>its</b> <b>ears.</b> Since the cat saw it, it {{thought it was}} a mouse and in a rush jumped there. The pig was very frightened and, {{emitting}} loud shouts, ran away to the forest. The wolf, the hare and the fox thought that a great animal or something was coming and, one running faster than the other, they ran away. All the ram's meat was left to the cat. For seven days the cat ate, ate until it was full the spoils of the wolf and the fox.|$|E

25|$|The {{giant panda}} has a body shape typical of bears. It has black fur on <b>its</b> <b>ears,</b> eye patches, muzzle, legs, arms and shoulders. The {{rest of the}} animal's coat is white. Although {{scientists}} {{do not know why}} these unusual bears are black and white, speculation suggests that the bold coloring provides effective camouflage in their shade-dappled snowy and rocky habitat. The giant panda's thick, wooly coat keeps it warm in the cool forests of its habitat. The panda's skull shape is typical of durophagous carnivorans. It has evolved from previous ancestors to exhibit larger molars with increased complexity and expanded temporal fossa. A 110.45kg (243.5lb) giant panda has a 3D canine teeth bite force of 2603.47 newtons and bite force quotient of 292. Another study had a 117.5kg (259lb) giant panda bite of 1298.9 newtons (BFQ 151.4) at canine teeth and 1815.9 newtons (BFQ 141.8) at carnassial teeth.|$|E
25|$|Wolf bounties were {{regularly}} paid in Italy during the 12th and 13th centuries and {{as recently as}} 1950's. Gian Galeazzo Visconti himself offered ten Imperial marks for every wolf killed. 600 wolves are recorded to have been bountied between the 14th and 19th centuries. Presentation of the killed wolf to the authorities was obligatory. The authorities had to give an accurate testimony {{with a description of}} the presented animal (gender, weight, measurements, color, estimated age, etc.) and the symptomatic ascertainment of eventual rabies infections. The wolf's paw was then amputated and/or <b>its</b> <b>ears</b> were sealed in wax {{in order to avoid the}} spoils being represented elsewhere. Only one case of fraudulence in 1834, which was punished by arrest, occurred. Italian wolf hunters lacked the organisation or determination of their French counterparts, having not formed any special hunting teams. Wolves were exterminated from the Alps in the 19th century, though they were never fully exterminated in the peninsula.|$|E
25|$|The {{black-footed ferret}} {{has a long}} slender body with black {{outlines}} such as the feet, ears, parts of the face and its tail. The forehead is arched and broad, and the muzzle is short. It has few whiskers, and <b>its</b> <b>ears</b> are triangular, short, erect and broad at the base. The neck is long and the legs short and stout. The toes are armed with sharp, very slightly arched claws. The feet on both surfaces are covered in hair, even to the soles, thus concealing the claws. It combines several physical features common in both members of the subgenus Gale (least, short-tailed and long-tailed weasels) and Putorius (European and steppe polecats). Its skull resembles that of polecats in its size, massiveness {{and the development of}} its ridges and depressions, though it is distinguished by the extreme degree of constriction behind the orbits where the width of the cranium is much less than that of the muzzle. Though similar in size to polecats, its attenuate body, long neck, very short legs, slim tail, large orbicular ears and close-set pelage is much closer in conformation to weasels and stoats. The dentition of the black-footed ferret closely resembles that of the European and steppe polecat, though the back lower molar is vestigial, with a hemispherical crown which is too small and weak to develop the little cusps which are more apparent in polecats.|$|E

25|$|The chacmools at Chichen Itza {{were found}} in a {{combination}} of chacmool, throne and serpent column; this chacmool-throne-serpent complex was associated with rulership during the Early Postclassic period. The original chacmool described by Le Plongeon in the 19th century included small images of the central Mexican deity Tlaloc on <b>its</b> <b>ear</b> ornaments. Among the Classic period Maya, such Tlaloc imagery was associated with war and human sacrifice. Associations between the rain god, war and human sacrifice may have continued into the Postclassic period {{as demonstrated by the}} chacmool within the Castillo at Chichen Itza, which bears small images of the Maya rain god Chaac on <b>its</b> <b>ear</b> ornaments. The chacmools at Tula, with contextual similarity to those at Chichen Itza, probably also represent war captives.|$|R
500|$|Many rhinogrades {{used their}} nose for locomotion, {{for example the}} [...] "snout leapers" [...] like Hopsorrhinus aureus, whose nasorium was used for jumping, or the [...] "earwings" [...] like Otopteryx, which flew {{backwards}} by flapping <b>its</b> <b>ears</b> and used its nose as a rudder. Some species used their nasorium for catching food, for example by using it to fish or to attract and trap insects. Other species included the fierce Tyrannonasus imperator and the shaggy Mammontops.|$|E
500|$|The Amami rabbit has short {{feet and}} hind legs, a {{somewhat}} bulky body, and rather large and curved claws used for digging and sometimes climbing. <b>Its</b> <b>ears</b> are significantly smaller {{compared to those}} of other hares or rabbits. The pelage is thick, wooly and dark, brown on top and becomes more reddish-brown on the sides. It has heavy, long and very strong claws, being nearly straight on the forefeet and curved on the hindfeet [...] The eyes are also small compared to more common rabbits and hares. The average weight is 2.5–2.8kg.|$|E
