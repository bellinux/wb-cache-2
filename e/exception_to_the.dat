5|$|Soldiers from Palmyra {{even used}} their dialect of Aramaic for inscriptions, in a {{striking}} <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rule that Latin was {{the language of}} the military.|$|E
5|$|Another <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{general rule}} that courts will {{generally}} only judicially review errors {{of law is}} where action is taken or a decision is {{made on the basis}} of no evidence, a lack of sufficient evidence, or an error of material fact. In such situations, intervention by the High Court is warranted as the action or decision is factually unsustainable.|$|E
5|$|Centuries later, {{the region}} around Salerno {{was the only}} <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rule that (except for {{skipping}} units that had regionally fallen out of use) the apothecaries' ounce was subdivided down to the scruple {{in exactly the same}} way as in the Roman system: It divided the ounce into 10drachms.|$|E

5|$|Classifying {{aluminium}} as a metalloid {{has been}} disputed given its many metallic properties. It is therefore, arguably, an <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mnemonic that elements {{adjacent to the}} metal–nonmetal dividing line are metalloids.|$|E
5|$|In Northern Ireland, unionists took <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{appearance}} of McGuinness election posters there given that Northern Ireland citizens were not eligible {{to vote in}} this Republic of Ireland election.

5|$|Judicial Commissioner Menon also {{mentioned}} another <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> justiciability rule: when {{the courts are}} able to isolate a pure question of law from what is seemingly a non-justiciable issue. However, the judge did not explain this exception further, {{and it has not}} yet been applied or discussed in any other Singapore case.|$|E

5|$|Lumina: {{debuted in}} June 2007 with a luxury theme {{including}} the Berlina grille {{and the original}} Calais V seven-spoke alloy wheels.

5|$|The {{diagonal}} {{positioning of}} the metalloids represents an <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> observation that elements with similar properties tend to occur in vertical groups. A related effect {{can be seen in}} other diagonal similarities between some elements and their lower right neighbours, specifically lithium-magnesium, beryllium-aluminium, and boron-silicon. Rayner-Canham has argued that these similarities extend to carbon-phosphorus, nitrogen-sulfur, and into three d-block series.|$|E
5|$|The one <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{compactness}} of {{the quartet}} {{comes in the}} minuet. The minuet's first half is a standard 12 measures, but the second half is an unusually long 44 measures and involves harmonic excursions deep into the flat-side keys. The trio echoes the first and fourth movements by commencing with a B upbeat leading to an E.|$|E

5|$|Upon gaining {{independence}} in 1960, Nigeria made African unity the centrepiece of {{its foreign policy}} and {{played a leading role}} in the fight against the apartheid government in South Africa. One notable <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> African focus was Nigeria's close relationship developed with Israel throughout the 1960s. The latter nation sponsored and oversaw the construction of Nigeria's parliament buildings.|$|E
5|$|A {{promethium}} atom has 61 electrons, {{arranged in}} the configuration 4f56s2. In forming compounds, the atom loses its two outermost electrons {{and one of}} the 4f-electrons, which belongs to an open subshell. The element's atomic radius is the third largest among all the lanthanides but is only slightly greater than those of the neighboring elements. It is the only <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> general trend of the contraction of the atoms with increase of atomic radius (caused by the lanthanide contraction) that is not caused by the filled (or half-filled) 4f-subshell.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{above are}} the fossil-bearing beds of Old Red Sandstones found principally along the Moray Firth coast. The Highlands are generally mountainous {{and the highest}} elevations in the British Isles are found here. Scotland has over 790 islands divided into four main groups: Shetland, Orkney, and the Inner Hebrides and Outer Hebrides. There are numerous bodies of freshwater including Loch Lomond and Loch Ness. Some parts of the coastline consist of machair, a low lying dune pasture land.|$|E

5|$|After {{his escape}} from Detroit, Hines went to Toronto where several other former Confederates lived. Not expecting {{to return to}} the United States, he sent for his wife Nancy. While in Toronto he studied law with General John C. Breckinridge, a former Vice President of the United States. Once U.S. President Andrew Johnson {{declared}} a pardon for most former Confederates, Hines went back to Detroit on July 20, 1865, to sign a loyalty oath to the United States. However, knowing that Union officials in Kentucky would consider him an <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pardon, he remained in Canada until May 1866.|$|E
5|$|An error as to a jurisdictional, or precedent, fact is an <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{general rule}} that the High Court does not judicially review errors of fact. Under the {{threefold}} classification {{of the broad}} grounds of judicial review set out in Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service ("the GCHQ case", 1983) – illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety – an error as to a precedent fact may {{be regarded as a}} form of illegality.|$|E
5|$|Bowman {{argued that}} the {{authorized}} sale of the seeds extinguished the patent, and that Bowman merely used seeds legitimately purchased from the silo. He claimed that the Federal Circuit had created an <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> exhaustion doctrine, and that this decision was properly for Congress to decide. Monsanto {{argued that the}} second-generation seeds were not subject to exhaustion because they had not existed until Bowman created them and had not been sold {{at the time of}} infringement. He noted that even when exhaustion applied, it did not allow one to create new copies of the patented product, which the second-generation seeds were.|$|E

5|$|Compliance {{with the}} law is checked when {{vehicles}} pass through a weigh station, often located at the borders between states or {{on the outskirts of}} major cities, where the vehicle may be weighed and measured. The one <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> formula allows a standard five-axle semi-truck configuration to weigh the maximum legal gross weight. This exception was specifically requested by the American Trucking Associations to allow tank trucks to reach the maximum legal gross weight without violating the bridge formula law.|$|E
5|$|Continued drought, road competition, and {{rationalisation}} of intrastate freight {{operations have}} seen this change in recent years, {{with an average of}} only 6.1 million tonnes of intrastate freight carried from each year between 1996 and 1998; and containers now being the major traffic, with residual cement, logs, quarry, and steel trains operating. By the 1990s road transport has captured most general freight traffic, with less than carload traffic was discontinued in July 2007 {{with the end of the}} Fastrack freight service. An <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> decline is interstate operations, with intermodal container traffic growing due to competition between private operators.|$|E
5|$|Errors as to {{precedent}} facts, {{sometimes called}} jurisdictional facts, in Singapore administrative law are errors committed by public authorities concerning facts that must objectively exist or not exist before the authorities {{have the power}} to take actions or make decisions under legislation. If an error concerning a precedent fact is made, the statutory power has not been exercised lawfully and may be quashed by the High Court if judicial review is applied for by an aggrieved person. The willingness of the Court to review such errors of fact is an <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> general rule that the Court only reviews errors of law.|$|E
