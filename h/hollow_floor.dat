40|$|Abstract. Assembly-box {{concrete}} <b>hollow</b> <b>floor</b> is a {{new kind}} of cellular voided floor structure, in which a lot of prefabricated box-shaped interior forms are placed regularly on the formwork before the floor concrete is cast. The new type of box-shaped filler is termed assembly-box and could behave as load-bearing elements. Such floor system has many advantages, such as low self-weight, good mechanical behavior, equally flexural stiffness in two directions and high voided rate. The characteristic of this floor structure is the combination of precast assembly-box and cast-in orthogonal grids of ribs. For the purpose of understanding the behavior of this floor, a test has been carried out with three scale specimens under vertical loading. All experimental values provide essentially the same result that a typical flexural failure occurred under ultimate load and the structural system of assembly-box hollow could behave like an overall cast-in <b>hollow</b> <b>floor.</b> A part of the top plate in assembly-box could be viewed as the flange of rib beam during the process of structural design...|$|E

Thus, this study aims at assessing the variation in construction cost among various construction methods available for hollow and solid floors in construction projects within Lagos State. The research design for this study was a survey design approach and the population of the study are active professionals (Architects, Civil Engineers, Builders, Quantity Surveyors, Consultant) and contractors because they are the major participants in the construction activities of the construction industry in Lagos State, Nigeria. The research is based on 46 returned questionnaires out of the 60 that was administered. The data from the questionnaires were analyzed using descriptive tools such as frequencies, percentage and mean values. The hypotheses were tested with paired sample t-test and {{it was found that the}} system or method of slab construction well known to the respondents is cast in situ, precast and semi-precast. The study also shows that the cost of in-situ solid slabs are higher than that of hollow slab which is an indication that solid slab construction is more expensive than hollow slab construction provided the hollow slab is a one-way <b>hollow</b> <b>floor</b> and not waffle floor. In pre cast solid slab construction the cost of transportation of units to sites, cost of expertise required in the construction process and the cost of fabrication off site are the three highest and most expensive aspects of precast solid slab while cost of erection and placement and the cost of grouting and topping if required are less expensive. Therefore there is difference in the cost of construction between the solid and hollow slabs but the difference is not appreciable.

40|$|Measurements of the {{vibration}} reduction index (Kij) {{were made in}} full accordance with the standard, ISO 108048 on junctions constructed from 190 mm thick hollow concrete block masonry walls connected to 203 mm (82 ̆ 01 d) thick precast prestressed hollow core slabs, with the objective to collect the data required to determine the Apparent Sound Transmission Class (ASTC) rating of building constructions which use these elements. The vibration reduction index measured in the laboratory was equal to or higher than that predicted using the theory outlined in Annex E of the standard, ISO 15712 - 1 over the frequency range of interest. Based {{on the distribution of}} the velocity levels measured on the concrete masonry walls and the precast <b>hollow</b> core <b>floors,</b> it was determined that these elements behave as homogeneous elements for the purpose of calculating the ASTC rating of this construction. Therefore, {{the results of this study}} suggest that theoretical calculations of {{the vibration}} reduction indices found in Annex E of ISO 15712 can be used to predict the vibration reduction index of other junctions between concrete masonry walls and precast <b>hollow</b> core <b>floors</b> with a mass per area greater than or equal to 323 kg/m 2. Based on the findings from this study, it is expected that constructions of hollow concrete block masonry walls with a mass per unit area greater than 238 kg/m 2 connected to precast <b>hollow</b> core <b>floors</b> with a mass per unit area greater than 323 kg/m 2 will achieve ASTC ratings which are equal to or greater than 47. This report includes examples of calculations of the ASTC ratings for constructions consisting of bare concrete masonry walls connected to bare precast <b>hollow</b> core <b>floors.</b> The examples using the simplified and detailed methods show that constructions of bare (no liners, unpainted) normal weight 190 mm thick hollow concrete block masonry walls connected to bare 203 mm (82 ̆ 01 d) thick precast prestressed hollow core slabs can achieve an ASTC rating of 48 for side-by- side rooms (horizontal transmission) and an ASTC rating of 55 for one-above-the-other rooms (vertical transmission). The installation of linings on the floor, ceiling or walls would increase the ASTC ratings. Although the values of the vibration reduction index which were measured for this study were for junctions with the continuous voids of the hollow core planks oriented perpendicular to the concrete masonry walls, the results may also be used for the case where the voids are oriented parallel to the walls. The vibration reduction indices are expected to be higher for the case where the continuous voids are oriented parallel to the concrete masonry walls and so using vibration reduction index values for the case of voids oriented perpendicular to the concrete masonry walls may yield more conservative values than may be found in practice. The benefit of using the same results for both cases is that it eliminates the risk of using the wrong set of data for the calculation of the ASTC rating.

40|$|Unusually low {{reflectance}} material, {{within which}} depressions known as hollows {{appear to be}} actively forming by sublimation, is {{a major component of}} Mercury's surface geology. The observation that this material is exhumed from depth by large impacts has the intriguing implication that the planet's lower crust or upper mantle contains a significant volatile-rich, low-reflectance layer, the composition of which will be key for developing our understanding of Mercury's geochemical evolution and bulk composition. Hollows provide a means by which the composition of both the volatile and non-volatile components of the low-reflectance material (LRM) can be constrained, as they result from the loss of the volatile component, and any remaining lag can be expected to be formed of the non-volatile component. However, previous work has approached this by investigating the spectral character of hollows as a whole, including that of bright deposits surrounding the hollows, a unit of uncertain character. Here we use high-resolution multispectral images, obtained as the MESSENGER spacecraft approached Mercury at lower altitudes {{in the latter part of}} its mission, to investigate reflectance spectra of inactive <b>hollow</b> <b>floors</b> where sublimation appears to have ceased, and compare this to those of the bright surrounding products and the parent material. This analysis reveals that the final lag after hollow-formation has a flatter spectral slope than that of any other unit on the planet and reflectance approaching that of more space-weathered parent material. This indicates firstly that the volatile material lost has a steeper spectral slope and higher reflectance than the parent material, consistent with (Ca,Mg) sulfides, and secondly, that the low-reflectance component of LRM is non-volatile and may be graphite...|$|R

The female is {{fed by the}} male while incubating a clutch of 2-4 eggs for about 42 days before hatching. The chicks are covered in, at first, white, then creamy down, and fledge in 10-12 weeks. Fledged owls with traces of down may remain {{in the vicinity of}} the nest for several weeks. Breeding is seasonal with most eggs laid in spring from late October to early November.|$|R
