5|$|Bran {{has been}} in a coma {{for more than a month}} since being thrown from the tower by Jaime Lannister. After {{slapping}} his nephew Prince Joffrey for refusing to give his condolences to the Starks, Tyrion Lannister informs his siblings that despite Bran's fall, the boy will survive, much to the <b>dismay</b> <b>of</b> the incestuous Lannister twins.|$|E
5|$|Jane Austen is {{the younger}} {{daughter}} of Reverend George Austen {{and his wife}} and has yet to find a suitable husband. She aspires to be a writer, to the <b>dismay</b> <b>of</b> her mother and proud delight of her father.|$|E
5|$|Louis XVIII chose many centrist cabinets, as {{he wanted}} to appease the populace, much to the <b>dismay</b> <b>of</b> his brother, the ultra-royalist Count of Artois. Louis always dreaded the day he would die, believing that his brother, and heir, Artois, would abandon the centrist {{government}} for an ultra-royalist autocracy, which would not bring favourable results.|$|E
60|$|Tournefort, too, {{at sight}} of the {{prisoner}} had uttered a cry <b>of</b> <b>dismay</b> and <b>of</b> astonishment.|$|R
6000|$|A shade <b>of</b> <b>dismay,</b> almost <b>of</b> fear--the look a timid animal gives when startled--stole {{into her}} eyes. [...] "You ask such odd questions! How can I answer them? I know this--I would {{rather die than}} not. Is that what you mean?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 1. When {{he gave it}} {{the first}} time, he caused his terror and {{severity}} to appear before Moses, to the shaking of his soul and the <b>dismaying</b> <b>of</b> Israel; but when he gave it the second time, he caused all his goodness to pass before Moses, to the comfort of his conscience and the bowing of his heart.|$|R
5|$|An {{estimated}} 2,000–2,400 {{people were}} killed in the Glina massacres. In 1969, a monument was erected and a memorial museum was built to commemorate the victims of the killings. Following the independence of Croatia from Yugoslavia, the monument was removed by Croatian authorities in the town. After the Croatian War of Independence, the local authorities failed to restore it and dismantled it instead. The memorial museum was converted into a generic cultural institution, to the <b>dismay</b> <b>of</b> the local Serbian population.|$|E
5|$|In public, Alexandra was dignified and charming; in private, affectionate and jolly. She enjoyed {{many social}} activities, {{including}} dancing and ice-skating, {{and was an}} expert horsewoman and tandem driver. She also enjoyed hunting, to the <b>dismay</b> <b>of</b> Queen Victoria, who asked her to stop, but without success. Even {{after the birth of}} her first child, she continued to socialise much as before, which led to some friction between the queen and the young couple, exacerbated by Alexandra's loathing of Prussians and the queen's partiality towards them.|$|E
5|$|It was the 1971 film The Panic in Needle Park, {{in which}} he played a heroin addict, that brought Pacino to the {{attention}} of director Francis Ford Coppola, who cast him as Michael Corleone in the blockbuster Mafia film The Godfather (1972). Although several established actorsincluding Jack Nicholson, Robert Redford, Warren Beatty, and little-known Robert De Niroalso tried out for the part, Coppola selected the relatively unknown Pacino, to the <b>dismay</b> <b>of</b> studio executives.|$|E

6000|$|... 1. When {{he gave it}} {{the first}} time, he caused his terror and {{severity}} to appear before Moses, to the shaking of his soul, and the <b>dismaying</b> <b>of</b> Israel (Exo 19:16; Heb 12:18-20). But when he gave it the second time, he caused all his goodness to pass before Moses, to the comfort of his conscience, and the bowing of his heart (Exo 34:8).|$|R
5|$|The first {{manslaughter}} {{charge was}} in March 1888, when Abby H. Corner, a practitioner in Medford, Massachusetts, attended {{to her daughter}} during childbirth; the daughter bled to death and the baby did not survive. The defense argued {{that they might have}} died even with medical attention, and Corner was acquitted. To the <b>dismay</b> <b>of</b> the Christian Scientists' Association (the secretary resigned), Eddy distanced herself from Corner, telling the Boston Globe that Corner had only attended the college for one term and had never entered the obstetrics class.|$|E
5|$|Born in Gothenburg, Sweden, PewDiePie {{originally}} {{pursued a}} degree in industrial economics and technology management at Chalmers University of Technology. In 2010, during his time at the university, he registered a YouTube account under the name PewDiePie. The following year, {{he dropped out of}} Chalmers after becoming disinterested with his degree field, much to the <b>dismay</b> <b>of</b> his parents. After failing to earn an apprenticeship with an advertising agency in Scandinavia, he then decided to focus on creating content for his YouTube channel. In order to fund his videos, PewDiePie began selling prints of his Photoshop art projects and working at a hot dog stand. PewDiePie soon gathered a rapidly increasing online following, and in July 2012, his channel surpassed one million subscribers.|$|E
5|$|Brian ends up exercising {{for hours}} {{with the help}} of Stewie, parodying Rocky Balboa in the movie Rocky IV, but realizes his test is only a few hours away. He becomes {{stressed}} at being late for his exam, so Lois persuades Peter to revive The A-Team one last time and drive Brian to his test, which is successful, and Brian arrives on time. He fails his test, but remains proud of himself for not cheating, much to the <b>dismay</b> <b>of</b> the family, who tells him that he probably should have cheated. Brian tries to reassure them that he finished what he started and labels his pride of that 'something', but the Griffins shoot him down for that.|$|E
60|$|That {{afternoon}} {{three men}} shouldered into Babbitt's {{office with the}} air of a Vigilante committee in frontier days. They were large, resolute, big-jawed men, and they were all high lords in the land of Zenith--Dr. Dilling the surgeon, Charles McKelvey the contractor, and, most <b>dismaying</b> <b>of</b> all, the white-bearded Colonel Rutherford Snow, owner of the Advocate-Times. In their whelming presence Babbitt felt small and insignificant.|$|R
60|$|The child {{stood with}} her lip between her teeth, a look, half, of pure misery and <b>dismay,</b> half <b>of</b> satisfaction, on her pretty sharp face.|$|R
6000|$|The {{intensity}} of her utterance amazed Serviss, and {{he studied her}} profile in silence before he answered. [...] "I think I know what you mean, and I sympathize with you. You're {{too young to be}} troubled by the doubts and <b>dismays</b> <b>of</b> men like Clarke. He is preposterous {{in the face of a}} landscape like this. Let us forget him and his 'isms.'" [...] With these words he straightened in his saddle and lifted his eyes towards the height before them. [...] "Isn't that superb!" ...|$|R
5|$|Despite his {{dissatisfaction with}} McClellan's failure to {{reinforce}} Pope, Lincoln was desperate, and restored him to command of all forces around Washington, to the <b>dismay</b> <b>of</b> {{all in his}} cabinet but Seward. Two days after McClellan's return to command, General Robert E. Lee's forces crossed the Potomac River into Maryland, leading to the Battle of Antietam in September 1862. The ensuing Union victory was among the bloodiest in American history, but it enabled Lincoln to announce that he would issue an Emancipation Proclamation in January. Having composed the Proclamation some time earlier, Lincoln had waited for a military victory to publish it to avoid it being perceived {{as the product of}} desperation.|$|E
5|$|During World WarI, the palace, {{then the}} home of King GeorgeV and Queen Mary, escaped unscathed. Its more {{valuable}} contents were evacuated to Windsor but the royal family remained in situ. The King imposed rationing at the palace, much to the <b>dismay</b> <b>of</b> his guests and household. To the King's later regret, David Lloyd George persuaded him to go further by ostentatiously locking the wine cellars and refraining from alcohol, to {{set a good example}} to the supposedly inebriated working class. The workers continued to imbibe and the King was left unhappy at his enforced abstinence. In 1938, the north-west pavilion, designed by Nash as a conservatory, was converted into a swimming pool.|$|E
5|$|Family feud: According to Zonaras, Odaenathus' nephew misbehaved {{during a}} lion hunt; {{he made the}} first attack and killed the animal to the <b>dismay</b> <b>of</b> the king. Odaenathus warned the nephew who ignored the warning and {{repeated}} the act twice causing the king to deprive him of his horse {{which is a great}} insult in the East. The nephew threatened Odaenathus and was put in chains as a result; Hairan I asked his father to forgive his cousin and his request was granted but as the king was drinking, the nephew approached him with a sword and killed him along with Hairan I. The bodyguard immediately executed the nephew.|$|E
5000|$|The Gryphon {{appears to}} be {{somewhat}} overbearing and dismissive of the obsessions and <b>dismays</b> <b>of</b> other characters, such as the Mock Turtle's sorrow and the Queen of Hearts' executions, neither of which (according to the Gryphon) have any basis in fact. He speaks with a slightly ungrammatical Cockney-like accent and makes demands of the Mock Turtle, which are obeyed despite the latter creature's implicit objections. In addition, he is prone to making cough-like sounds written as [...] "Hjckrrh!", which seem to have little meaning and may be involuntary.|$|R
6000|$|... "Here you are, then no yes I {{do believe}} I've {{forgotten}} it, after all!" [...] cried Jamie, slapping his pockets {{one after the}} other with a <b>dismayed</b> expression <b>of</b> countenance.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} staying with Mrs. Boinville {{for the last}} month; [...] I have escaped, in the society of all that {{philosophy}} and [...] friendship combine, from the <b>dismaying</b> solitude <b>of</b> myself." ...|$|R
5|$|Fearful of Hereford's power, Richard {{unjustly}} {{orders that}} his cousin be {{banished from the}} realm for six years, to the <b>dismay</b> <b>of</b> the House of Commons and many others. Slowly dying of old age, Gaunt's final advice to Richard, that he put aside his favourites and become a just king, falls on deaf ears. Gaunt dies soon after; Richard becomes increasingly dictatorial and prevents Gaunt's vast inheritance from being granted to Bolingbroke; his banishment is converted to life, though his sons remain in the country. In the wake of these troublesome events, Richard leaves England for Ireland, a decision widely considered folly considering the turmoil England is in. Bolingbroke returns to England and many nobleman flock to his banner; Richard is overthrown.|$|E
5|$|In August 1979, {{the band}} entered Wessex Studios to begin {{recording}} London Calling. The Clash asked Guy Stevens {{to produce the}} album, much to the <b>dismay</b> <b>of</b> CBS Records. Stevens had alcohol and drug problems and his production methods were unconventional. During a recording session he swung a ladder and upturned chairs – apparently to create a rock & roll atmosphere. The Clash, especially bassist Paul Simonon, got along well with Stevens, and found Stevens' work to be very helpful and productive to both Simonon's playing and their recording as a band. The album was recorded during a five- to six-week period involving 18-hour days, with many songs recorded {{in one or two}} takes.|$|E
5|$|In the mid 1960s, Sands and its {{adjacent}} properties {{were bought}} by the reclusive businessman Howard Hughes, who built a 500-room tower and modernized the hotel. After the 1970s it fell into decline until its final owner, Sheldon Adelson, {{made the decision to}} shut it down and to build a brand new resort. The last dice in the casino was rolled by Bob Stupak just after 6pm on June 30, 1996. On November 26 of that year, it was finally imploded and demolished, much to the <b>dismay</b> <b>of</b> longtime employees and sentimentalists. Today, The Venetian stands where the Sands once stood.|$|E
60|$|Anna {{burst into}} exclamations <b>of</b> <b>dismay</b> at seeing the {{dripping}} figures.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly Mrs. Crowley {{threw up}} her hands with a gesture <b>of</b> <b>dismay.</b>|$|R
60|$|Such {{were the}} exclamations uttered. And {{there was good}} cause for their consternation and <b>dismay.</b> Instead <b>of</b> the tidy cabin they had {{expected}} to see, nothing but a heap of blackened logs confronted them.|$|R
5|$|Initially, the American embassy {{believed}} the Ngô family's {{claims that the}} regular army {{was responsible for the}} raids. The Voice of America, which was widely listened to in South Vietnam as the only non-Diệmist news source, initially aired Nhu's version of events, much to the <b>dismay</b> <b>of</b> the generals. The American media thought otherwise and began to debunk this theory, pointing out that the Ngô family constantly sought to undermine the army, and that Madame Nhu's joy over the events suggested the family had neither ceded power nor had their hands forced by the military. Furthermore, they identified Nhu's aides at the site, his idiosyncratic style in the announcements supposedly made by the ARVN, {{and the fact that the}} army had little motive to attack the Buddhists.|$|E
5|$|Lou-Ann Poovie (played by Elizabeth MacRae) is Gomer's girlfriend. She debuts in {{the third}} season as a singer for a nightclub, but leaves the job at Gomer's urging to return home to Turtle Creek, North Carolina, and marry her beau Monroe Efford. In a later episode in the same season, she returns to California and reveals that she called the wedding off. At {{the end of the}} episode, she reveals that she wants Gomer to be her boyfriend, to the <b>dismay</b> <b>of</b> Carter and Duke. After she loses her job at the nightclub, Gomer finds her a job as a salesclerk at a record shop.|$|E
5|$|Many women's {{rights activists}} {{who worked with}} Stanton were opposed to the {{publication}} of The Woman's Bible; they felt it would harm the drive for women's suffrage. Although it was never accepted by Bible scholars as a major work, it became a popular best-seller, much to the <b>dismay</b> <b>of</b> suffragists who worked alongside Stanton within the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). Susan B. Anthony tried to calm the younger suffragists, but they issued a formal denunciation of the book, and worked to distance the suffrage movement from Stanton's broader scope which included attacks on traditional religion. Because of the widespread negative reaction, including that of suffragists who had been close to her, publication of the book effectively ended Stanton's influence in the suffrage movement.|$|E
