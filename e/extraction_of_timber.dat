50|$|Reference {{levels have}} to {{eventually}} have national coverage, {{but they may}} be composed from a number of sub-national reference levels. As an example, forest degradation may have a reference emission level for commercial selective logging and one for <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> minor <b>timber</b> and firewood for subsistence use by rural communities. Effectively, every identified driver of deforestation or forest degradation has to be represented in one or more reference emission level(s). Similarly for reference levels for enhancement of carbon stocks, there may be a reference level for plantation timber species and one for natural regeneration, possibly stratified by ecological region or forest type.|$|R
30|$|Environmental impacts {{associated}} with the transportation <b>of</b> <b>timber</b> from forest to sawmills, then sawn timber from sawmills to manufacturing companies, and finally to end-users, consume significant amounts of fossil fuel, and thereby emit greenhouse gas (GHG) to the environment. A study carried out in Swedish wood supply chain showed that transportation <b>of</b> <b>timber</b> from forests to industrial sites consumes more fossil fuels than {{any other part of}} the chain (Lindholm and Berg 2005). The energy used during the transportation system has impacts on the environment due to release of emission with likely effects on global warming, acidification and eutrophication. For example, organic compounds and phosphorus released to water, and emissions of nitrogenous compounds to both air and water, are the most serious environmental impacts. Similarly, road transport <b>of</b> <b>timber</b> account for almost half of the total GHG emissions. In East Norway, GHG emissions from the final felling, <b>extraction</b> and transport <b>of</b> <b>timber,</b> was found to have 17.893  kg CO 2 -equivalents per m 3 <b>of</b> <b>timber</b> delivered to industry gate in 2010 (Timmermann and Dibdiakova 2014). As a result, transportation creates impacts on the atmosphere, land and water resources, and noise pollution.|$|R
50|$|Illegal logging is the harvest, transportation, {{purchase}} or sale {{of timber}} {{in violation of}} laws.

50|$|Most of the Sri Lanka's {{rain forests}} were cleared for plantations, {{originally}} {{for coffee and}} cinchona and then tea and rubber. The remaining forests cover only 4.6 percent of the wet zone. Between 1990-2005, Sri Lanka has showed {{one of the highest}} deforestation rates of primary forests in the world. A survey carried out in 2005 found that 17 of Sri Lanka's frogs have become extinct in the past decade and another 11 species face imminent threat of extinction unless their habitat is secured. These remaining forests exist as highly fragmented patches. Most of them are less than 10 km2 in extent. Poaching and the <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> forest products (<b>timber,</b> firewood, medicinal plants) are a problem in almost all forest reserves.|$|R
40|$|The estuarine {{section of}} the Lower Gordon River is {{approximately}} 38 km long and {{has been used as}} a navigable waterway since its discovery in 1815. Early usage was connected with the <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> valuable <b>timber</b> growing in the area, but as that resource declined tourist cruises took over as the dominant use of the river. In the last decade the tourist industry expanded rapidly, resulting in new, larger and faster boats operating on the river at increased frequencies. This produced a sudden increase in both the size of waves and the frequency of impacts on the banks, which resulted in the rapid erosion of many kilometres of previously stable river bank. As the banks retreated the temperate rainforest lining the river toppled into the water, significantly degrading the aesthetic qualities of this World Heritage listed area. The aims of this thesis, using the Lower Gordon River as an example, were to investigate: Methods of assessing, monitoring and controlling bank erosion by boat-generated waves. The processes of wave erosion of different bank types. The relationship between various wave and sediment characteristics and bank erosion rates...|$|R
50|$|During the 1860s {{the economy}} of the Maroochy region became {{increasingly}} geared towards <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> the bountiful <b>timber</b> in the area. Brisbane timber merchant William Pettigrew, highly influential in the timber trade throughout south-east Queensland established a presence in the region, with depots on both the Maroochy and Mooloolah rivers later establishing a sawmilling complex near the Maroochy's mouth. In the mid 1860s Pettigrew transferred his Maroochy timber lease to James Low. Low established a timber depot opposite and slightly upstream from Dunethin Rock {{on the site of the}} wharf of the original Yandina run, opening a post office in 1868. The word Dunethin is of Aboriginal origin meaning the place of swimming trees, (dhu trees, yungathin, swim), a reference to the logs transported on the river in the area during this period. Until 1970, when Dunethin became the official name, the locality was often referred to as Dunethim.|$|R
50|$|In 1912 and 1924 {{surveyors}} assessed Cooloola's remaining timber resources, and the <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>timber</b> (mainly hardwoods) continued.

40|$|At {{regional}} {{to global}} scales, {{the effects of}} wind energy on the environment often {{are considered to be}} positive, through the production of renewable energy and the potential displacement of mining activities, air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions associated with non-renewable energy sources (see Chapter 2). However, wind-energy facilities have been demonstrated to kill birds and bats and there is evidence that wind-energy development also can result in the loss of habitat for some species. To the extent that we understand how, when, and where wind-energy development most adversely affects organisms and their habitat, {{it will be possible to}} mitigate future impacts through careful siting decisions. In this chapter, we review the effects of wind-energy development on ecosystem structure and functioning, through direct effects of turbines on organisms, and on landscapes through alteration and displacement. We recommend a research and monitoring framework for reducing these impacts. Although the focus of our analysis is the Mid-Atlantic Highlands, we use all available information to assess general impacts. Although other sources of development on sites that are suitable for wind-energy development affect wildlife and their habitats (e. g., mineral <b>extraction,</b> cutting <b>of</b> <b>timber),</b> and there are other sources of anthropogenic mortality to animals, as stated previously, this committee was charged to focus on wind energy, and therefore did not conduct a comprehensive comparative analyses of impact...|$|R

40|$|Where forest {{management}} must rely upon some natural means of regeneration (i. e. natural seedfal 1 or sprouting), the silvicultura 1 methods {{applied to the}} parent stand should be so designed as to establish those ecological conditions which favor regeneration of the desired species. There is no finite number of silvicu 1 tura 1 methods. Rather there is an almost infinite number of possible combinations of cutting methods, aimed at achieving the desired results. Five basic systems, as outlined below, are recognized in this country. 1. Clear Cutting Systems a. Staggered cutting blocks or strips with intervening areas <b>of</b> uncut <b>timber.</b> b. Applied usually to pure even-aged stands where 100 percent of the volume is removed from each cut area. 2. Seed Tree Systems a. Essentially, these are clear cut systems but with good seed producing residuals of the desired species left scattered over the cutting area. b. Usually up to 90 percent of the original stand is removed. 3. Shelterwood Systems a. This involves the gradual <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>timber</b> over some portion of the rotation period. b. While all of the original stand is eventually removed, any single cutting may remove only 25 to 40 percent of the original stand. 4. Selection Systems a. This is a continuous cutting process wherein about 10 percent of the stand is removed with each cut. b. The method encourages a mixed species composition that tends eventually toward an all-aged stand condition. 5. Coppice Systems a. Where regeneration is possible by sprouting from stem or root collar. This system of cutting has some application in: (1) Hardwood management (2) Christmas tree managemen...|$|R

40|$|Illegal <b>extractions</b> <b>of</b> {{renewable}} resources threaten sustainable use of those resources. The world community has recently paid increasing {{attention to the}} issue of illegal logging. This paper tries to explain why it is important to exclude illegally logged timber from the international market by using a stylized model in the literature of trade and {{renewable resources}}. It is shown that a fall in the price <b>of</b> <b>timber</b> may cause a switch of management regime from enforced property rights to open-access, expanding the supply <b>of</b> <b>timber</b> and reducing forest stock. When several countries export <b>timber,</b> an expansion <b>of</b> illegal logging in one country due to a regime switch may also increase illegal logging in other countries. A bilateral agreement between one exporting country and importing countries to exclude illegally logged timber from trade may effectively reduce illegal logging in other countries...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{recent advances}} in nondestructive and semi-destructive techniques {{that are used to}} evaluate the condition and mechanical properties of wood members in structures with emphasis on historic buildings. Traditional methods for assessing the condition <b>of</b> <b>timber</b> are generally nondestructive, but may require probing or removal of small samples for species identification. Nondestructive techniques are useful for rapid screening <b>of</b> <b>timber</b> for potential problem areas or implying internal conditions, but typically are not particularly reliable for identifying material properties. Semi-destructive techniques require <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> a small specimen for subsequent testing to determine elastic and strength parameters while preserving the integrity of the structural member.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} extent <b>of</b> {{compatibility}} <b>of</b> <b>timber</b> and {{non-timber forest product}} (NTFP) extraction in two neotropical localities from biophysical, social, and institutional perspectives: the community concession forests of the Pete´ n, Guatemala, and extractivist communities in northern Bolivia. In both localities, timber is harvested via reduced-impact logging (RIL) practices. In Guatemala, themain NTFP extracted is foliage from the understory xate palm (Chamaedorea spp.); in northern Bolivia, {{the fruits of the}} Brazil nut tree (Bertholletia excelsa). The Guatemalan case suggests a relatively high degree of compatibility due to low timber harvesting intensities, coupled with temporal, spatial, and social segregation <b>of</b> xate <b>extraction</b> in a well-defined land tenure system. In northern Bolivia, forest management regulations pay little attention to NTFPs and land tenure issues and related conflict complicate efforts to limit timber harvesting impacts on Brazil nut trees. The introduction <b>of</b> <b>timber</b> management plans overlain on customary property rights systems in which the <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> Brazil nut is organized could undercut its management system. The two case studies suggest that specific legislative, education, and project interventions may help to promote the compatibility <b>of</b> <b>timber</b> and NTFP <b>extraction</b> and management. These include formal training of foresters on NTFP ecology and management while taking into account the perspectives of multiple stakeholders in the design of management plans.

30|$|Chemical {{treatment}} of biomaterials does not only aid the <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> soluble organic compounds from lignocellulosic materials thereby enhancing chelating efficiency, but also modifies the surface chemical {{properties of the}} final product. Djilali et al. (2012) observed that NaOH treatment <b>of</b> <b>timber</b> sawdust not only permitted the <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> hemicelluloses {{and most of the}} lignin but also allowed the conversion of the polyol structure into a negatively charged cellulose-based material. Dawood and Sen (2012) treated pine cone biomass with HCl and observed that while the surface area increased, the mean particle size decreased when compared to the untreated samples. Therefore, {{treatment of}} lignocellulosic materials with an acid or basic solution will not only modify the chemical composition of the material but also lead to the formation of new functional groups via hydrolysis or saponification of existing chemical compounds (Marshall and Johns 1996; Dhakal et al. 2005; Lu et al. 2009).|$|R
