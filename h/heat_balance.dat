500|$|Although {{cyclones}} take {{an enormous}} toll in lives and personal property, {{they may be}} important factors in the precipitation regimes of places they impact, as they may bring much-needed precipitation to otherwise dry regions. Tropical cyclones also help maintain the global <b>heat</b> <b>balance</b> by moving warm, moist tropical air to the middle latitudes and polar regions, and by regulating the thermohaline circulation through upwelling. [...] The storm surge and winds of hurricanes may be destructive to human-made structures, but they also stir up the waters of coastal estuaries, which are typically important fish breeding locales. Tropical cyclone destruction spurs redevelopment, greatly increasing local property values.|$|E

500|$|A mature {{tropical}} cyclone can release heat {{at a rate}} upwards of 6x1014 watts. Tropical cyclones on the open sea cause large waves, heavy rain, and high winds, disrupting international shipping and, at times, causing shipwrecks. Generally, after its passage, a {{tropical cyclone}} stirs up ocean water, lowering sea surface temperatures behind it. This cool wake can cause the region to be less favorable for a subsequent tropical cyclone. On rare occasions, tropical cyclones may actually do the opposite. 2005's Hurricane Dennis blew warm water behind it, contributing to the unprecedented intensity of Hurricane Emily, which followed it closely. [...] Hurricanes help to maintain the global <b>heat</b> <b>balance</b> by moving warm, moist tropical air to the mid-latitudes and polar regions. Were {{it not for the}} movement of heat poleward (through other means as well as hurricanes), the tropical regions would be unbearably hot.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the transient performance of packed bed heat regenerators when very large temperature differences are involved. The effects of gas temperature {{on the key}} gas physical properties of velocity, density and heat capacity were studied via simulation. Three models were developed and compared. The first model (HRKDV) considers <b>heat</b> <b>balances</b> for both solid and gas phases, the second (HRVDV) considers mass balances {{in addition to the}} <b>heat</b> <b>balances</b> set up in the first model and the third one (HRASO) considers that the only significant rate of accumulation term is that of the energy of the solid phase. The governing partial differential equations were solved by the method of lines with the spatial discretization accomplished by the method of orthogonal collocation. The findings of this work reveal that whereas the effects of large temperature changes on the gas velocity and density are completely negligible, the effects of temperature on the gas heat capacity must be considered "continuously " when large temperature swings occur. Considering the heat capacity as a constant, even at an average value, leads to significant errors in temperature profiles...|$|R
