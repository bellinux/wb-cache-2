The base of the shell is moderately convex. The outer lip is thin, sharp, strongly protractive below the keel, above the latter with a wide, shallow anal sulcus reaching close to the suture. The body is polished, milkwhite. The columella is short, twisted, white, with a well-marked spiral plait near its insertion. The siphonal canal is wide, short, distally funicular, and somewhat recurved.|$|R

40|$|It is {{necessary}} to use an inclined slipway to launch lifeboats in locations {{where there is no}} natural harbour. Slipway stations consist of an initial roller section followed by an inclined keelway, the lifeboat is released {{from the top of the}} slipway and proceeds under its own weight into the water. Contact is between the lifeboat <b>keel</b> and a <b>lined,</b> greased keelway and this that determines the friction along the slipway.

Environmentally conscious lubricants including water and bio-greases are investigated and compared for their effects in reducing slipway panel friction and wear. Experimental data is collected to establish wear mechanisms, wear volumes and friction characteristics for a range of lubricants and environmental contaminants for the two most common lifeboat keelway lining materials.

6000|$|This gentleman believes, that {{subsequently}} to the subsidence {{by which}} the atolls in the Low Archipelago were produced, the whole area has been elevated {{to the amount of}} a few feet; this would indeed be a remarkable fact; but as far as I am able to judge, the grounds of his conclusion are not sufficiently strong. He states that he found in almost every atoll which he visited, the shores of the lagoon raised from eighteen to thirty inches above the sea-level, and containing imbedded Tridacnae and corals standing as they grew; some of the corals were dead in their upper parts, but below a certain line they continued to flourish. In the lagoons, also, he frequently met with clusters of Madrepore, with their extremities standing from one inch to a foot above the surface of the water. Now, these appearances are exactly what I should have expected, without any subsequent elevation having taken place; and I think Mr. Couthouy has not borne in mind the indisputable fact, that corals, when constantly bathed by the surf, can exist at a higher level than in quite tranquil water, as in a lagoon. As long, therefore, as the waves continued at low water to break entirely over parts of the annular reef of an atoll, submerged to a small depth, the corals and shells attached on these parts might continue living at a level above the smooth surface of the lagoon, into which the waves rolled; {{but as soon as the}} outer edge of the reef grew up to its utmost possible height, or if the reef were very broad nearly to that height, the force of the breakers would be checked, and the corals and shells on the inner parts near the lagoon would occasionally be left dry, and thus be partially or wholly destroyed. Even in atolls, which have not lately subsided, if the outer margin of the reef continued to increase in breadth seaward (each fresh zone of corals rising to the same vertical height as at <b>Keeling</b> atoll), the <b>line</b> where the waves broke most heavily would advance outwards, and therefore the corals, which when living near the margin, were washed by the breaking waves during the whole of each tide, would cease being so, and would therefore be left on the backward part of the reef standing exposed and dead. The case of the madrepores in the lagoons with the tops of their branches exposed, seems to be an analogous fact, to the great fields of dead but upright corals in the lagoon of Keeling atoll; a condition of things which I have endeavoured to show, has resulted from the lagoon having become more and more enclosed and choked up with reefs, so that during high winds, the rising of the tide (as observed by the inhabitants) is checked, and the corals, which had formerly grown to the greatest possible height, are occasionally exposed, and thus are killed: and this is a condition of things, towards which almost every atoll in the intervals of its subsidence must be tending. Or if we look to the state of an atoll directly after a subsidence of some fathoms, the waves would roll heavily over the entire circumference of the reef, and the surface of the lagoon would, like the ocean, never be quite at rest, and therefore the corals in the lagoon, from being constantly laved by the rippling water, might extend their branches to a little greater height than they could, when the lagoon became enclosed and protected. Christmas atoll (2 deg N. latitude) which has a very shallow lagoon, and differs in several respects from most atolls, possibly may have been elevated recently; but its highest part appears (Couthouy, page 46) to be only ten feet above the sea-level. The facts of a second class, adduced by Mr. Couthouy, in support of the alleged recent elevation of the Low Archipelago, are not all (especially those referring to a shelf of rock) quite intelligible to me; he believes that certain enormous fragments of rock on the reef, must have been moved into their present position, when the reef was at a lower level; but here again the force of the breakers on any inner point of the reef being diminished by its outward growth without any change in its level, has not, I think, been borne in mind. We should, also, not overlook the occasional agency of waves caused by earthquakes and hurricanes. Mr. Couthouy further argues, that since these great fragments were deposited and fixed on the reef, they have been elevated; he infers this from the greatest amount of erosion not being near their bases, where they are unceasingly washed by the reflux of the tides, but at some height on their sides, near the line of high-water mark, as shown in an accompanying diagram. My former remark again applies here, with this further observation, that as the waves have to roll over a wide space of reef before they reach the fragments, their force must be greatly increased with the increasing depth of water as the tide rises, and therefore I should have expected that the chief line of present erosion would have coincided with the line of high-water mark; and if the reef had grown outwards, that there would have been lines of erosion at greater heights. The conclusion, to which I am finally led by the interesting observations of Mr. Couthouy is, that the atolls in the Low Archipelago have, like the Society Islands, remained at a stationary level for a long period: and this probably is the ordinary course of events, subsidence supervening after long intervals of rest.) ...|$|R

40|$|The author {{presents}} an original algorithm aimed at automatically generating the hull {{shape of a}} sailing yacht starting from an initial set of parameters. The procedure consists of two steps. First one <b>keel</b> <b>line</b> and a Designed Water Line (DWL in the following) are faired according {{to a set of}} parameters, say length of water line, canoe body draft, stem angle and some adimensional coefficients. This information is then used to fair the hull surface, which must in turn fulfil more prerequisites (parameters like displaty cement, floatation area and related coefficients). The hull is defined by means of a B-spline surface, the fairing of which is ensured by allowing for all the imposed objectives and constraints. An optimisation technique based upon the gradient method ensures that a reliable solution is obtained in a very short time. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASV) {{have many}} {{potential}} {{applications in the}} maritime industry and ocean science. To subsist in the ocean space, an ASV must {{have the ability to}} scavenge energy from the surrounding environment. Waves are an abundant source of energy on the ocean surface and a suitable resource for an ASV to scavenge. Flapping foils have been shown to generate thrust in a wavy flow and power in a uniform flow. The aim of this experimental study is to investigate the relationship between flapping foil propulsion and power generation in the context of ASVs. Initial experiments incorporating fully passive flapping foils submerged at the bow and stern of a surface vessel in head waves were performed in a towing tank. The spring-loaded foils were located at the end of rigid pivot arms protruding at the bow and abaft of the vessel. The pivot arms were free to rotate about a location beneath the <b>keel</b> <b>line</b> and restrained by adjustable rotational dampers. In this free condition, wave energy is recovered in the form of work applied by the flapping foils through the rotary dampers which were used to simulate the damping effects of a power take-off device. Thrust was generated under conditions when the pivot arm was fixed. This system, referred to as the Flapping Energy Utilization and Recovery (FLEUR) system, could serve as a dualpurpose wave energy scavenging propulsor and power generator for long-endurance ASVs...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTLarge size ships {{have a very}} {{flexible}} construction resulting in low resonance frequencies of the structural eigen-modes. This feature increases the dynamic response of the structure on short period waves (springing) and on impulsive wave loads (whipping). This dynamic response in its turn increases both the fatigue damage and the ultimate load on the structure; these aspects illustrate the importance of including the dynamic response into the design loads for these ship types. Experiments {{have been carried out}} using a segmented scaled model of a container ship in a Seakeeping Basin. This paper describes the development of the model for these experiments; the choice was made to divide the hull into six rigid segments connected with a flexible beam. In order to model the typical feature of the open structure of the containership that the shear center is well below the <b>keel</b> <b>line</b> of the vessel, the beam was built into the model as low as possible. The model was instrumented with accelerometers and rotation rate gyroscopes on each segment, relative wave height meters and pressure gauges in the bow area. The beam was instrumented with strain gauges to measure the internal loads at the position of each of the cuts. Experiments have been carried out in regular waves at different amplitudes for the same wave period and in long crested irregular waves for a matrix of wave heights and periods. The results of the experiments are compared to results of calculations with a linear model based on potential flow theory that includes the effects of the flexural modes. Some of the tests were repeated with additional links between the segments to increase the model rigidity by several orders of magnitude, in order to compare the loads between a rigid and a flexible model...|$|E
40|$|Prediction of the {{hydrodynamic}} {{forces on}} planing craft by strip method requires the force acting on two-dimensional sections in vertical motion {{on the free}} surface to be known. The motion of a transverse section of a prismatic hull in steady planing corresponds to a constant velocity water entry of a wedge shaped section. The force acting on the wedge section before the chines get wetted is found from {{a consideration of the}} rate of change of the section added mass. The current added mass impact theory does not give a satisfying definition of the change in added mass after chines wetting, and hence predictions of non-constant velocity water entry can not be made accurately. As a consequence, the theory is not applicable for use in prediction of the lifting force on hulls in unsteady planing or on hulls in steady planing with non-straight <b>keel</b> <b>line,</b> i. e. phenomena corresponding to non-constant water entry. Also, in unsteady planing, sections experience exit motion due to the pitch and heave response of the craft. If applying the added mass theory in exit predictions, the resulting force acts in the direction of motion, something in contradiction with intuition and common sense. The work described in this thesis has resulted in a new added mass theory for water entry and exit of transverse sections of typical planing craft. A program of numerical simulations and experiments with wedge shaped sections has been carried out, providing force data for water entry and exit of such bodies to and from the water. Analysis of these data have led to separation of the added mass and damping forces and to the development of quasi-empirical expressions applicable for both constant and non-constant velocity force predictions. Thus the new theory provides a basis for strip method for prediction of the unsteady motion forces of planing craft. Further, the new added mass theory for water entry has been applied to predict the steady planing lift force on slender body hulls, and consistency with published planing data has been found. Also, an empirical aspect ratio correction has been derived, allowing application to large aspect ratio (non-slender) planing hulls...|$|E
