He assisted in the founding of the Australian Democrats political party, and he was the chairman of the meeting in Melbourne in 1977 at which the party was launched. Late in life he watched his wife, Rosa, suffer before her death in 1987, and he became an advocate for voluntary euthanasia. He died in Canberra in 2000.|$|E
25|$|The ANU College of Physical & Mathematical Sciences {{comprises}} the Research Schools of Astronomy & Astrophysics, Chemistry, Earth Sciences, Mathematical Sciences and Physics. Under {{the direction of}} Mark Oliphant, nuclear physics was one the university's most notable early research priorities, leading {{to the construction of}} a 500 megajoule <b>homopolar</b> <b>generator</b> and a 7.7 megaelectronvolts cyclotron in the 1950s. These devices were to be used as part of a 10.6 gigaelectronvolt synchrotron particle accelerator that was never completed, however they remained in use for other research purposes. ANU has been home to eight particle accelerators over the years and operates the 14UD and LINAS accelerators. Brian Schmidt (astrophysicist at Mount Stromlo Observatory) received the 2011 Nobel Prize for Physics for his work on the accelerating expansion of the universe.|$|E
500|$|In 1955, Oliphant {{initiated}} {{the design and}} construction of a 500 megajoule <b>homopolar</b> <b>generator</b> (HPG), the world's largest. This massive machine contained three discs [...] in diameter and weighing [...] He obtained £40,000 (...) initial funding from the Australian Atomic Energy Commission. Completed in 1963, the HPG {{was intended to be}} the power source for a synchrotron, but this was not built. Instead, it was used to power the LT-4 Tokamak and a large-scale railgun that was used as a scientific instrument for experiments with plasma physics. It was decommissioned in 1985.|$|E
40|$|The use of <b>homopolar</b> <b>generators</b> {{operated}} in the pulse mode to heat forging billets offers several possible advantages over present heating methods. Because heating is uniform {{throughout the entire}} cross section, billets can safely be heated to forging temperature in comparatively short times, thus minimizing scale formation. Because energy is stored in the generator, the demand on the utility mains is low and essentially uniform. In this paper, the range of billet sizes and shapes that can be heated using a 75 -MJ power supply are calculated. The power supply consists of six pairs of <b>homopolar</b> <b>generators</b> that can be configured in series, in parallel, or in any of several series-parallel combinations depending on the load requirements...|$|R
50|$|Winston H. Bostick (March 5, 1916 - January 19, 1991) was an American {{physicist}} {{who discovered}} plasmoids, plasma focus, and plasma vortex phenomena. He simulated cosmical astrophysics with laboratory plasma experiments, {{and showed that}} Hubble expansion can be produced with repulsive mutual induction between neighboring galaxies acting as <b>homopolar</b> <b>generators.</b> His work on plasmas provided evidence for finite-sized elementary particles and the composition of strings, {{but this is not}} accepted by mainstream science.|$|R
40|$|<b>Homopolar</b> <b>generators</b> are a {{particular}} class of electrical machines capable of generating DC current {{without the use}} of mechanical commutators or electronic rectifiers. This paper presents an overview of the typical configurations of homopolar DC machines. The paper focuses on generating operation, trying to assess the optimal configuration for a high efficiency generator. Among the possible solutions, a specific configuration which uses permanent magnets for the excitation field was chosen and built to perform a set of experiments...|$|R
2500|$|The <b>homopolar</b> <b>generator,</b> {{the largest}} ever built, was capable of {{supplying}} currents of over 2 megaamperes. Even though it was never used for its intended purpose it ended up being used for numerous research projects requiring an extremely high current source until its disassembly in 1986. One of these projects was the invention {{and development of the}} railgun by John Barber and Richard Marshall. [...] The school also benefited in an indirect way from the construction of the massive generator, the accumulated engineering experience and techniques where later used to build other research equipment around the school including the Plasma Physics H1NF Heliac.

2500|$|During 1950, Sir Mark Oliphant, an Australian {{physicist}} and first {{director of the}} Research School of Physical Sciences at the new Australian National University, initiated the design and construction of the world's largest (500 megajoule) <b>homopolar</b> <b>generator.</b> [...] This machine was operational from 1962 and was later used to power a large-scale railgun that {{was used as a}} scientific experiment.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the years}} of 1831–1832, Michael Faraday {{discovered}} the operating principle of electromagnetic generators. [...] The principle, later called Faraday's law, is that an electromotive force is generated in an electrical conductor that is subjected to a varying magnetic flux, as for example, [...] a wire moving through a magnetic field. [...] He also built the first electromagnetic generator, called the Faraday disk, a type of <b>homopolar</b> <b>generator,</b> using a copper disc rotating between the poles of a horseshoe magnet. [...] It produced a small DC voltage.|$|E
50|$|DC {{homopolar}} {{machines are}} among the oldest electric machines. Michael Faraday made one in 1831. Superconducting DC homopolar machines use superconductors in their stationary field windings and normal conductors in their rotating pickup winding. In 2005 the General Atomics company received a contract {{for the creation of}} a large low speed superconducting homopolar motor for ship propulsion. Superconducting <b>homopolar</b> <b>generators</b> have been considered as pulsed power sources for laser weapon systems. However, homopolar machines have not been practical for most applications.|$|R
50|$|The Faraday disc was {{primarily}} inefficient due to counterflows of current. While current flow was induced directly underneath the magnet, the current would circulate backwards in regions outside {{the influence of}} the magnetic field. This counterflow limits the power output to the pickup wires, and induces waste heating of the copper disc. Later <b>homopolar</b> <b>generators</b> would solve this problem by using an array of magnets arranged around the disc perimeter to maintain a steady field around the circumference, and eliminate areas where counterflow could occur.|$|R
50|$|This {{design was}} inefficient, due to self-cancelling counterflows of current in {{regions of the}} disk that were not under the {{influence}} of the magnetic field. While current was induced directly underneath the magnet, the current would circulate backwards in regions that were outside the influence of the magnetic field. This counterflow limited the power output to the pickup wires, and induced waste heating of the copper disc. Later <b>homopolar</b> <b>generators</b> would solve this problem by using an array of magnets arranged around the disc perimeter to maintain a steady field effect in one current-flow direction.|$|R
2500|$|For much of {{the early}} years {{the focus of a}} large part of the school was designing, re-designing and {{building}} a cyclo-synchrotron that in its final intended form was to produce a beam of 10.6 GeV protons for nuclear physics research. Designed to be a world class research machine it was referred to within the school as [...] "The Big Machine". Due to shifting goalposts and huge costs the cyclo-synchrotron was never completed. The small 7.7 MeV cyclotron designed to function as the proton injector was completed in 1955, and the large <b>homopolar</b> <b>generator</b> intended to power the system was first operated in 1962, but by this time work on [...] "The Big Machine" [...] itself had been abandoned.|$|E
2500|$|A {{motor-generator}} set, or {{the similar}} rotary converter, is not strictly a rectifier {{as it does}} not actually rectify current, but rather generates DC from an AC source. In an [...] "M-G set", the shaft of an AC motor is mechanically coupled {{to that of a}} DC generator. The DC generator produces multiphase alternating currents in its armature windings, which a commutator on the armature shaft converts into a direct current output; or a <b>homopolar</b> <b>generator</b> produces a direct current without the need for a commutator. M-G sets are useful for producing DC for railway traction motors, industrial motors and other high-current applications, and were common in many high-power D.C. uses (for example, carbon-arc lamp projectors for outdoor theaters) before high-power semiconductors became widely available.|$|E

50|$|<b>Homopolar</b> <b>generators</b> {{underwent}} a renaissance in the 1950s {{as a source}} of pulsed power storage. These devices used heavy disks as a form of flywheel to store mechanical energy that could be quickly dumped into an experimental apparatus. An early example of this sort of device was built by Sir Mark Oliphant at the Research School of Physical Sciences and Engineering, Australian National University. It stored up to 500 megajoules of energy and was used as an extremely high-current source for synchrotron experimentation from 1962 until it was disassembled in 1986. Oliphant's construction was capable of supplying currents of up to 2 megaamperes (MA).|$|R
5000|$|In all {{of these}} machines, {{the density of the}} {{particles}} in the plasma is very low, often described as a [...] "poor vacuum". This limits its approach to the triple product along the temperature and time axis. This requires magnetic fields on the order of tens of Teslas, currents in the megaampere, and confinement times on the order of tens of seconds. Generating currents of this magnitude is relatively simple, and a number of devices from large banks of capacitors to <b>homopolar</b> <b>generators</b> have been used. However, generating the required magnetic fields is another issue, generally requiring expensive superconducting magnets. For any given reactor design, the cost is generally dominated by the cost of the magnets.|$|R
50|$|High-acceleration linear motors are {{difficult}} to design {{for a number of}} reasons. They require large amounts of energy in very short periods of time. One rocket launcher design calls for 300 GJ for each launch in the space of less than a second. Normal electrical generators are not designed for this kind of load, but short-term electrical energy storage methods can be used. Capacitors are bulky and expensive but can supply large amounts of energy quickly. <b>Homopolar</b> <b>generators</b> can be used to convert the kinetic energy of a flywheel into electric energy very rapidly. High-acceleration linear motors also require very strong magnetic fields; in fact, the magnetic fields are often too strong to permit the use of superconductors. However, with careful design, this need not be a major problem.|$|R

5000|$|A pure <b>homopolar</b> <b>{{generator}}</b> (PHG) is an electric generator not requiring brushes or electronics or semiconductor {{parts to}} convert torque into direct current. In other words, this <b>homopolar</b> <b>generator</b> only requires theoretical homogeneous or actual (constantly or cyclically) homogenized magnetic field {{to be able}} to produce direct current. The theory of PHG is explained using Maxwell's equations. This term unifies all devices that work in line with this definition. PHG can be represented by patents, which should also work the other way round: US5977684 (A), PV2011-293 (CZ) application number 2011-293, AU5801890 (A).|$|E

40|$|<b>Homopolar</b> <b>generators</b> (HPGs) {{presently}} {{being developed}} at the Center for Electromechanics are capable of delivering megampere pulses of electric current in a controllable manner. One application for these machines is as the power supplies for an industrial welding process. During the past five years, several research projects {{have been carried out}} to explore welding capabilities of HPGs. Among the materials that have been welded are carbon and low alloy steels, several varieties of stainless steels, tool steels, nickel-base and molybdenum-base alloys, aluminum, and several dissimilar-metal couples. Among the shapes that have been welded are bars, sheets, plates, tubes, pipe, angle sections, and rails. The largest cross sections that have been welded to date are 9 sq. in. (2. 9 sq. cm) and the smallest have been less than 0. 3 sq. in. (0. 58 sq. cm). Welding is accomplished in times approximating a second. Unique advantages of the homopolar pulse welding process are that it can scaled upward to indefinitely large cross sections and that it does not impose a sudden load on the mains...|$|R
25|$|The magnet is held {{to prevent}} it from rotating, while the disc is spun on its axis. The result is that the {{galvanometer}} registers a direct current.

The statorette fabrication technique is considered novel and provides means to establish insulation life-temperature profiles on completed electromagnetic components of rotating machines...|$|R

5|$|Electrical {{power is}} usually {{generated}} by electro-mechanical generators driven by steam produced from fossil fuel combustion, or the heat released from nuclear reactions; or {{from other sources}} such as kinetic energy extracted from wind or flowing water. The modern steam turbine invented by Sir Charles Parsons in 1884 today generates about 80 percent of the electric {{power in the world}} using a variety of heat sources. Such generators bear no resemblance to Faraday's <b>homopolar</b> disc <b>generator</b> of 1831, but they still rely on his electromagnetic principle that a conductor linking a changing magnetic field induces a potential difference across its ends. The invention {{in the late nineteenth century}} of the transformer meant that electrical power could be transmitted more efficiently at a higher voltage but lower current. Efficient electrical transmission meant in turn that electricity could be generated at centralised power stations, where it benefited from economies of scale, and then be despatched relatively long distances to where it was needed.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>homopolar</b> <b>generator</b> is a DC {{electrical}} generator comprising an electrically conductive disc or cylinder rotating {{in a plane}} perpendicular to a uniform static magnetic field.

It is also known as a unipolar generator, acyclic generator, disk dynamo, or Faraday disc. The voltage is typically low, on the order of a few volts in the case of small demonstration models, but large research generators can produce hundreds of volts, and some systems have multiple generators in series to produce an even larger voltage. They are unusual in that they can source tremendous electric current, some more than a million amperes, because the <b>homopolar</b> <b>generator</b> can be made to have very low internal resistance.|$|E
