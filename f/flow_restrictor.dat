50|$|The {{required}} pressure for administrating the drug {{comes from the}} elastomeric layer that is molded inside the pump. When the pump is filled the layer is stretched. The elastic constriction drives the liquid through the tubing and eventually through a <b>flow</b> <b>restrictor</b> out into the patient connection. The pressure is consistent until {{near the end of}} the infusion, when there will usually be a pressure spike resulting in a higher flow rate. The accuracy of the flow rate is controlled by a <b>flow</b> <b>restrictor</b> (glass capillary or steel cannula) that is molded into the tubing of the system or placed within the elastomeric reservoir. Elastomeric pumps do not require any electricity and are not gravity driven. When placed above or below the patient, flow rate is typically increased or decreased slightly (head height effect). Filling the pump is done manually through a one-way valve using a syringe or peristaltic repeater pump. Elastomeric pumps are known for their reliability and accurate flow rate. Elastomeric pumps are maintenance free and run independently without any electronics, and are typically single-use disposable. Depending on the pumps's size the drug inside the pump can be delivered over a time spread varying between thirty minutes to seven days.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{sulphur hexafluoride}} (SF 6) tracer {{technique}} enables determination of enteric methane emissions from {{large numbers of}} individual ruminant animals. The objective {{of this research was}} to identify and correct substantial errors within the SF 6 technique. Six experiments were undertaken using respiration chamber, laboratory or SF 6 techniques. Experiment 1 used respiration chambers to demonstrate that the daily pattern of methane emissions from dairy cows was related to their pattern of feed intake. In contrast, the daily emission of SF 6 from these cows was constant and independent of the pattern of methane emission. This finding supports the contention that in order to accurately determine daily methane emissions using the SF 6 technique, it is necessary that gases are collected continuously at a constant rate for 24 h. Since development of the SF 6 technique in 1993, it has been propounded that capillary-tube <b>flow</b> <b>restrictors</b> achieved a constant rate of sample collection into evacuated gas collection canisters. Laboratory experiments 2, 3, 4 and 5 demonstrated that, when capillary-tube <b>flow</b> <b>restrictors</b> are used, the rate of sample collection declined and caused a bias of up to 15. 6 % in calculated methane emissions. This error was caused by an interaction between the declining sample collection rate and the pattern of an animal's methane emission over 24 h. In contrast, orifice plate <b>flow</b> <b>restrictors</b> maintained a constant sample collection rate at canister pressures < 0. 31 atm and thereby minimised the decline in sample collection rate. Experiment 5 also demonstrated that sample collection using orifice plate <b>flow</b> <b>restrictors,</b> combined with initial (< 0. 03 atm) and final (< 0. 49 atm) canister pressures, substantially reduced measurement error. Accuracy of the modified SF 6 technique, incorporating orifice plate <b>flow</b> <b>restrictors</b> for 24 h sample collection, was validated in Experiment 6. The mean (S. D.) methane yield (g CH 4 /kg DMI) of eight cows did not differ (P= 0. 135) when determined using the modified SF 6 technique 22. 3 (1. 44) or chambers 21. 9 (1. 65). In addition, the between-animal coefficient of variation for methane yield determined using the modified SF 6 technique (6. 5 %) was similar to that determined using chambers (7. 5 %). Consequently the modified SF 6 technique enables the statistical power of experiments to be increased or their size decreased. We conclude that the modified SF 6 technique reduced error associated with SF 6 release, sample collection and analysis. It is recommended that the modified SF 6 technique should be used in preference to the original SF 6 technique for determination of enteric methane emissions from ruminants...|$|R

40|$|The present {{paper is}} {{dedicated}} to discuss how dynamic parameters of a hydraulic line intended to transfer hydraulic power from a source of hydraulic power (a hydraulic pump) to an actuating device (a hydraulic motor) can affect operation of an avionic hydraulic drive. Avionic hydraulic drives are operated with fast-varying waveforms of flow intensities and pressures. It is why analysis of most hydraulic drive systems must take account of compressibility of working fluid and elasticity of hydraulic lines. It leads to a wave model for propagation of energy variation down a hydraulic line (a pipe). The paper deals with flow of a compressible liquid via a hydraulic line with flexible walls.

40|$|In {{the area}} of gas analysis, most of the {{attention}} during the past quarter was devoted to gaining an understanding of the operation of the Antek total sulfur analyzer, and making appropriate modifications in the unit. The primary problem is that the resistance of the capillary <b>flow</b> <b>restrictor</b> is not large enough, and the amount of sulfur which reaches the UV-analyzer results in the analyzer becoming saturated. We have added a N{sub 2 } diluent flow downstream of the pyrotube tube which, we believe, will permit the unit to be operated at pressures to about 50 psig. Use of larger diluent flow rates to permit higher pressure operation is not feasible since larger diluent rates increase the back pressure on the quartz pyrotube (which operates at 1050 {degrees}C) to unsafe levels. In the meantime, Antek is studying the redesign of the capillary <b>flow</b> <b>restrictor</b> to provide larger flow resistance. Studies on the regeneration of FeS in the atmospheric pressure reactor were almost completed during the quarter. Only a series of multicycle sulfidation-regeneration tests remains.
