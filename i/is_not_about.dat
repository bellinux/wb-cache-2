5|$|According to Gandhi, {{religion}} <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>about</b> {{what a man}} believes, it {{is about}} how a man lives, how he relates to other people, his conduct towards others, and one's relationship to one's conception of god. It is not important to convert or to join any religion, {{but it is important}} to improve one's way of life and conduct by absorbing ideas from any source and any religion, believed Gandhi.|$|E
5|$|Malcolm {{leaves the}} table {{only to return}} furious; Archie was lying. A heated debate ensues, and the four men wrestle over the bill until Anya tells them that the meal can be free. Malcolm insists it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>about</b> the bill, and fetches a knife and {{chopping}} board. Archie and Malcolm are to play stabscotch, with the winner paying. Malcolm is quick but Archie is slower, repeatedly stabbing himself. Craig pulls the knife from Archie, inadvertently slashing Anya. She collapses as blood splatters. Anya is dead, and Malcolm formulates a story blaming Archie, but Archie has called a prison contact who will remove the body.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, Roger summons all {{the partners}} {{to his office}} to learn the fate of their Jaguar presentation. Don locks eyes with Joan when she joins them, realizing that she has, in fact, slept with Herb. Roger receives the congratulatory confirmation call from Jaguar, and the office erupts in celebration. In Don's office, Peggy informs him she has accepted a job with CGC. He thinks she is asking for a raise and attempts to negotiate salary, but she tells him it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>about</b> money. She holds back tears as he kisses her hand. She {{walks out of the}} office and smiles as she waits for an elevator.|$|E

30|$|After {{reviewing}} the full texts of 65 publications, 59 were excluded. Thirty-two publications <b>were</b> <b>not</b> formal {{reviews of the}} literature (for example they did not describe their search methods). Other reviews were excluded because they <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>about</b> implementation (n =[*] 15); were focused on the measurement properties of PROMs (n =[*] 11) or were about using PROMs in a research context (n-[*]=[*] 1). Of the 15 reviews excluded because they <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>about</b> implementation, 12 focused {{on the impact of}} PROMs, such as whether they improved clinical outcomes or patient satisfaction. The review team were initially uncertain about whether to include these, but ultimately excluded them because they <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>about</b> implementation in routine practice.|$|R

5|$|This is not {{the world}} of Ally McBeal. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>about</b> finding love remedially. This is {{a world in which}} too many of us are asking what use is love if you find it too late. Yet somehow, {{probably}} because the moral judgments are lightly made, superannuated singletons such as myself can look on and see an advertisement for, rather than a warning against, that famously honourable estate—just as we do when we gaze at the more benign marriages of our friends. In Vanity Fair, Thackeray deliberately wrote a novel without a hero. We respond to Cold Feet because it, on the contrary, does not despise its characters.|$|E

25|$|Material cause {{describes}} the material {{out of which}} something is composed. Thus the material cause of a table is wood, and the material cause of a car is rubber and steel. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>about</b> action. It {{does not mean that}} one domino knocks over another domino.|$|E
25|$|Another way of {{thinking}} about it is that the problem <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>about</b> the chance that the other side is black, it's about the chance that you drew the all black card. If you drew a black face, then it's twice as likely that that face belongs to the black card than the mixed card.|$|E
25|$|Geometry <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>about</b> the weight, heat, {{or energy}} of an object.

25|$|In 2009 Richard Nelson {{created a}} one-man drama, the only {{character}} onstage being Humbert speaking from his jail cell. It premiered in London with Brian Cox as Humbert. Cox {{believes that this}} is truer {{to the spirit of}} the book than other stage or film adaptations, since the story <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>about</b> Lolita herself but about Humbert's flawed memories of her.|$|E
25|$|This {{novel is}} based on the idea of {{traveling}} to another time period. However, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>about</b> basic time travel. The author {{is quick to point out}} that the traditional idea of time travel is not possible. Instead, the author uses quantum mechanics to suggest that other universes exist at the same time as ours, each existing in another time and place.|$|E
25|$|Albrekt Larsen has {{advanced}} this explanation by a {{comparative study of}} how trust increased in Denmark and Sweden {{in the latter part}} of the 20th century while it decreased in the US and UK. It is argued that inequality levels influence how citizens imagine the trustworthiness of fellow citizens. In this model social trust <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>about</b> relations to people you meet (as in Putnam's model) but about people you imagine.|$|E

25|$|Colin McGinn {{argues that}} the Chinese room {{provides}} strong evidence that the hard problem of consciousness is fundamentally insoluble. The argument, to be clear, <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>about</b> whether a machine can be conscious, but about whether it (or anything else for that matter) can {{be shown to be}} conscious. It is plain that any other method of probing the occupant of a Chinese room has the same difficulties in principle as exchanging questions and answers in Chinese. It is simply not possible to divine whether a conscious agency or some clever simulation inhabits the room.|$|E
25|$|So, {{while the}} name Packer appears {{many times in}} the book, the only serious comment that the writer makes about the whole affair (and he is right in his comment) is ”In one respect, and in only one I think, he (Packer) has done a service to the game by forcing us all to face the fact cricketers have been abysmally ill-paid.” So, as a whole “The Best Loved Game” <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>about</b> any {{controversial}} issue, it is simply about cricket being part of the English summer.|$|E
25|$|Story Telling-The protagonist, Anna Andrianovna, takes {{great pride}} in {{identifying}} herself as a storyteller and poet. Anna presents her tale as {{the story of her}} daughter, Alyona, and to some extent her son and grandchildren. She even sometimes {{goes so far as to}} write in her own version of Alyona's voice. Though she presents her tale as the story of her children's lives, as the novel progresses, it becomes apparent that the story <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>about</b> Anna's children, but about Anna herself and the way she relates them.|$|E

25|$|PSB, to me, <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>about</b> {{selecting}} individual programme strands here or there, financing {{them from}} some outside source and then foisting them upon commercial networks. Public Service Broadcasting, watched by a healthy number of viewers, with programmes financed {{in proportion to}} their intrinsic needs and not {{the size of the}} audience, can only effectively operate as a network — a network whose aim is to cater for the broadest possible range of interests, popular as well as less popular, a network that measures its success not only by its audience size but by the range of its schedule.|$|E
25|$|Formal {{logic is}} the study of {{inference}} with purely formal content. An inference possesses a purely formal content if it can be expressed as a particular application of a wholly abstract rule, that is, a rule that <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>about</b> any particular thing or property. The works of Aristotle contain the earliest known formal study of logic. Modern formal logic follows and expands on Aristotle. In many definitions of logic, logical inference and inference with purely formal content are the same. This does not render the notion of informal logic vacuous, because no formal logic captures all of the nuances of natural language.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the early}} 1990s, {{any notion of}} lesbian love in a film almost always {{required}} audiences to infer the relationships. The lesbian aesthetic of Queen Christina (1933) with Greta Garbo has been widely noted, even though the film <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>about</b> lesbians. Alfred Hitchcock's Rebecca (1940), {{based on the novel}} by Daphne du Maurier, referred more or less overtly to lesbianism, but the two characters involved were not presented positively: Mrs. Danvers was portrayed as obsessed, neurotic and murderous, while the never-seen Rebecca was described as having been selfish, spiteful and doomed to die. All About Eve (1950) was originally written with the title character as a lesbian but this was very subtle in the final version, with the hint and message apparent to alert viewers.|$|E
