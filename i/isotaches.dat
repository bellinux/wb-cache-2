40|$|It is {{well known}} that there is {{discrepancy}} in the measured field rate and magnitude of consolidation when compared with those estimated from Terzaghi’s theory based on laboratory test results using small soil specimens. The objective of the study is to characterize the compressibility of a marine clay near Chek Lap Kok with emphasis placed on the effect and contribution of the secondary compression of the soil. Various hypotheses and theories regarding the relations between primary consolidation and secondary compression were examined in this study, notably the creep hypotheses A and B and the concept of <b>isotaches.</b> A series of laboratory tests, consisting of oedometer cell, Rowe cell and triaxial cell, was devised to investigate the validity of some proposed hypotheses/theories using the marine clay near Chep Lap Kok. The study focused on the possible occurrence of the secondary compression during the primary consolidation stage and the characteristics of secondary compression under different specimen thicknesses and load increment ratios. To avoid the presumption that secondary compression comes after primary consolidation, Rowe cell and triaxial cell were employed to register the degree of primary consolidation based on the measured excess pore water pressure of the specimen. A main conclusion of the study was that secondary compression occurred in the primary consolidation stage and the extent of which depends on a number of factors such as the thickness of the specimen. The conclusion partly explained the discrepancy between the laboratory and field consolidation behaviour. Recommendations were also given to alert the designers involving in the estimation of consolidation settlement. published_or_final_versionApplied GeosciencesMasterMaster of Scienc...|$|E
40|$|Many {{industrial}} processes {{result in the}} production of silt sized waste materials which may be disposed of by being pumped as a slurry to settling lagoons where the solids settle to form fills which often have a high voids ratio. These are described as hydraulic fills. These processes are commonly found in the coal based power generation and mining and mineral processing industries, amongst others. The geotechnical behaviour of such deposits is of interest with respect to the integrity and safety of the impoundment systems and possible future use and redevelopment of the sites. Such deposits are very difficult to sample and in many cases {{it is almost impossible to}} obtain notionally undisturbed samples, and so it is necessary to prepare samples in the laboratory using techniques which simulate field conditions. The paper describes the results of a series of one dimensional compression tests, up to very high stress levels, on pulverised fuel ash (PFA) and fluorspar mine tailings. Sample preparation methods attempting to recreate the in-situ structure and density are described. The results presented consider the initial 1 -dimensional loading of the initially loose specimens, their unloading response and their creep behaviour. An attempt is made to define the normal consolidation line for these materials and the importance of the initial voids ratio is discussed. A general conceptual model of one dimensional compression behaviour is presented. The secondary compression, or creep, response is discussed, and creep behaviour may be important in considering their behaviour. The creep behaviour displays a linear relation in e-log(t) space. Contours of equal time of creep (<b>isotaches)</b> are suggested which are parallel to the normal consolidation line...|$|E

40|$|Abstract-We {{introduce}} {{a class of}} networks called <b>isotach</b> networks designed {{to reduce the cost}} of synchronization in parallel computations. <b>Isotach</b> networks maintain an invariant that allows each process to control the logical times at which its messages are received and consequently executed.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a new class}} of directory coherence protocols called delta coherence protocols that use network guarantees to support a new and highly concurrent approach to maintain a consistent shared memory. Delta coherence protocols are more concurrent than other coherence protocols in that they allow processes to pipeline memory accesses without violating sequential consistency; support multiple concurrent readers and writers to the same cache block; and allow processes to access multiple shared variables atomically without invalidating the copies held by other processes or otherwise obtaining exclusive access to the referenced variables. Delta protocols include both update and invalidate protocols. In this paper we describe the simplest, most basic delta protocol, an update protocol called the home update protocol. Delta protocols are based on <b>isotach</b> network guarantees. An <b>isotach</b> network maintains a logical time system that allows each process to predict and control the logical time at which its messages are received.

40|$|The {{time and}} strain rate {{dependency}} observed in natural soft clays is formulated {{within the framework}} of conventional elastoplasticity. Creep of soft clays is essentially like the response of an overdamped oscillatory system, i. e., the strain rate decays in an exponential manner. A characteristic strain rate and time relationship is presented based on data from creep tests on a large number of different soft clays. The evolutionary change of strain rate is found to affect the mechanical response of soft clays in an <b>isotach</b> manner. Taking strain rate as another stress-like variable, a loading-isotach (LI) yield curve is proposed, which describes the combined hardening mechanisms of loading and variation of strain rate. Incorporation of this LI yield curve into critical state soil mechanics results in an <b>isotach</b> elastoplastic (IEP) model in triaxial stress-strain-strain rate space, which has been dubbed 'Hunter Clay'. The effects of fabric anisotropy and inter-particle cementation, which are typical features of natural soft clays, are also introduced to produce an advanced hierarchical constitutive model for soft clay. Qualitative predictions are first described and compared with the characteristic behaviour of natural soft clays. Experimental validations using test data for two soft clays are then carried out, and comparisons of the model predictions and experimental data demonstrate the capability of the model in reproducing realistic behaviour of natural soft clays.
