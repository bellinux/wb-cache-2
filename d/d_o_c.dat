60|$|All {{those who}} are {{interested}} in the spread of human culture among the lower animals (and their name is legion) should make a point of not missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the famous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the sobriquet of Garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends and acquaintances Owen Garry. The exhibition, which is the result of years of training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system, comprises, among other achievements, the recitation of verse. Our greatest living phonetic expert (wild horses shall not drag it from us!) has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare the verse recited and has found it bears a striking resemblance (the italics are ours) to the ranns of ancient Celtic bards. We are not speaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with which the writer who conceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym of the Little Sweet Branch has familiarised the bookloving world but rather (as a contributor <b>D.</b> <b>O.</b> <b>C.</b> points out in an interesting communication published by an evening contemporary) of the harsher and more personal note which is found in the satirical effusions of the famous Raftery and of Donal MacConsidine to say nothing of a more modern lyrist at present very much in the public eye. We subjoin a specimen which has been rendered into English by an eminent scholar whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather more than an indication. The metrical system of the canine original, which recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules of the Welsh englyn, is infinitely more complicated but we believe our readers will agree that the spirit has been well caught. Perhaps it should be added that the effect is greatly increased if Owen's verse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour.|$|E

In particular, reconstructions of climate history (including temperature, salinity, and ice volume), ocean paleocirculation patterns, the carbon cycle, paleoproductivity, marine carbonate chemistry, and chemo-stratigraphy have relied on measurements of isotopic and trace element composition of foraminiferal calcium carbon-ate, and variations in these geochemical records through time and space.

The values of dD and <b>d</b> 18 <b>O</b> in fluid samples indicates that solutions at the Lost City field were produced during the serpentinization of basement ultramafic rocks at temperatures higher than 200 °C and at relatively low fluid/rock ratios (< 1).

The isotopic (<b>d</b> 18 <b>O,</b> <b>d</b> 13 <b>C,</b> and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr) and geochemical (Sr/Ca and REE) signatures indicate that, before its submarine discharging at the Lost City field, the fluid filtered through already cold altered outer zones of the Atlantis Massif and cooled via conductive heat loss. During this stage, the fluid could partly dissolve previously deposited carbonates in veins cutting serpentinite at the upper levels of the Atlantis Massif and the carbonate cement of sedimentary breccias underlying the hydrothermal chimneys.

A mobile ad-hoc network alive of mobile nodes that can move freely in an open environment. Communicating nodes in a MANET usually seek the help of other intermediate nodes to establish communication channels. manet contain reactive protocols Aodv is one of popular protocol. Route failure due to motion of nodes and lack of battery power thus route maintance is an important issue. routing is an important function aspect in wireless ad-hoc network that handles discovering and maintaining the path beween nodes within a network. For route maintance the node periodically broadcast hello message to their neighbours. In aodv although benefits of these messages have been proven,many study show some drawback for these message. In paper we optimize the hello interval with different hello loss 2 or 3. The simulation is done on Qualnet. Result analysis determine that Aodv perform better at HI= 3 se...|$|R

40|$|A {{large amount}} of {{research}} is currently being conducted on wine pH because of {{its effect on the}} formation of turbidity in unfined white wines. The haze-forming tendency and the protein profile of an Italian white wine (Erbaluce di Caluso <b>D.</b> <b>O.</b> <b>C.</b> G.), as affected by pH ranging from 3. 00 to 3. 60, a common pH range in wine, were analysed. The results indicated increased heat stability of the wine at lower pH, which was revealed by a lack of haze formation even above 70 °C. The pH increase was accompanied by a progressive shift in the haze formation temperature from 50 – 60 °C to 70 – 80 °C. The electrophoretic protein pattern of the wine was characterised, and proteins derived fromboth yeast and grape tissueswere identified. The statistical analysis of band intensities revealed that the solubility of five yeast and grape protein bands was modified by the pH shift. Most of the proteins involved were determined to be glycosylated, a feature that has been speculated to have an influence on the differential solubility of wine proteins in response to pH...|$|E

40|$|The present work studies {{some aspects}} of the turning process applied on {{hardened}} steel using multilayer coated carbide tools at high cutting speeds. The influence of cutting parameters (vc, f, and depth of cut - <b>d.</b> <b>o.</b> <b>c.)</b> on tool temperature, tool wear, cutting forces, and surface roughness were analyzed. The current literature reports many studies using PcBN on hardened steel, but {{it is also important to}} know the results when using coated carbide tools, mainly for economical reasons. Temperature was measured by a thermocouple positioned at the lowest insert face, underneath it. Temperature near the rake face was calculated using the measured gradient within the insert thickness. To measure the gradient a special technique was used with one embedded thermocouple near the rake face and one underneath. Tool wear measurements demonstrated the capability of such tools in turning hardened steel with reasonable tool life. Forces measured resulted in relatively low values, being the radial component the largest of all. For the different cutting conditions studied, the doc has the greatest influence on force and temperature. Additionally, the best surface roughness values were smaller than 0, 4 µm Ra...|$|E
40|$|Obj e c t i v e: Concern for {{children}} exposed to elemental mercury prompted the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention {{to review the}} sources of elemental mercury exposures in children, describe the location and proportion of children affected, and make recommendations on how to prevent these exposures. In this review, we excluded mercury exposures from coal-burning facilities, dental amalgams, fish consumption, medical waste incinerators, or thimerosal-containing vaccines. Data s <b>o</b> u r <b>c</b> e s: We reviewed federal, state, and regional programs with information on mercury releases along with published reports of children exposed to elemental mercury in the United States. We selected all mercury-related events that were documented to expose (or potentially expose) children. We then explored event characteristics (i. e., the exposure source, location). Data synthesis: Primary exposure locations were at home, at school, and at other locations such as industrial property not adequately remediated or medical facilities. Exposure to small spills from broken thermometers {{was the most common}} scenario; however, reports of such exposures are declining. Discussion a n <b>d</b> <b>c</b> <b>o</b> n <b>c</b> l u s i o n s: Childhood exposures to elemental mercury often result from inappropriate handling or cleanup of spilled mercury. The information reviewed suggests that mos...|$|R
40|$|Background Preclinical work {{suggests}} SRC proteins {{have a role}} in {{the development}} of resistance to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) targeted therapy in metastatic clear-cell renal cancer (mRCC). This hypothesis was tested in this trial using the SRC inhibitor saracatinib and the VEGF inhibitor cediranib. Patients and methods Patients with disease progression after ≥ 1 VEGF-targeted therapy were eligible to participate in this double-blind, randomized (1 : 1) phase II study. The study compared the combination cediranib 30 mg once daily (<b>o.</b> <b>d.)</b> and saracatinib 175 mg <b>o.</b> <b>d.</b> (CS) (n = 69) or cediranib 45 mg <b>o.</b> <b>d.</b> and placebo <b>o.</b> <b>d.</b> (<b>C)</b> (n = 69). Archived tissue was used for biomarker analysis [SRC, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), von Hippel–Lindau, protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 b and hypoxia-inducible factor 2 α : n = 86]. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) by RECIST v 1. 1. Results Between 2010 and 2012, 138 patients were randomized across 16 UK sites. The characteristics of the two groups were well balanced. Partial responses were seen in 13. 0...|$|R
