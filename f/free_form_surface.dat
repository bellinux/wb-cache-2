50|$|In {{automotive}} design, a class A {{surface is}} {{any of a}} set of freeform surfaces of high efficiency and quality. Although, strictly, it is nothing more than saying the surfaces have curvature and tangency alignment - to ideal aesthetical reflection quality, many people interpret class A surfaces to have G2 (or even G3) curvature continuity to one another (see <b>free</b> <b>form</b> <b>surface</b> modelling).|$|E

Rhinoceros' application architecture and open SDK makes it modular and enables the user to customize the interface and create custom commands and menus.

40|$|The {{advance in}} design, and {{manufacturing}} technologies {{has made it}} possible to design, and manufacture products with high degrees of irregularity, such as <b>free</b> <b>form</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Coordinate Measuring Machines (CMMs) are used to examine the conformity of the produced parts with the designer 2 ̆ 7 s intention. The inspection of <b>free</b> <b>form</b> <b>surfaces</b> is a difficult process due to their complexity, and irregularity. Many tasks are performed to ensure a reliable and efficient inspection using CMMs. Sampling is an essential and vital step in inspection planning. It is a major contributor to the CMM measurement uncertainty. This research focuses on developing efficient and reliable approaches to determine the locations of the points to be sampled from <b>free</b> <b>form</b> <b>surfaces</b> using the CMM. Four heuristic algorithms for the sampling of <b>free</b> <b>form</b> <b>surfaces</b> have been developed. Optimal sampling of <b>free</b> <b>form</b> <b>surfaces</b> using Genetic Algorithms has been introduced. An algorithm for the automatic selection of sampling algorithm based on the surface complexity is developed. The developed sampling algorithms have been implemented, and integrated into a computer-aided system for the sampling of <b>free</b> <b>form</b> <b>surfaces.</b> (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

50|$|Freeform {{surface or}} complex {{surfaces}} are widely manufactured nowadays. The industries which most often manufactures free-form surfaces are basically aerospace, automotive, die mold industries, bio medical and power sector for turbine blades manufacturing. Generally 3 or 5 axis CNC milling machine {{is used for}} this purpose. The manufacturing process of <b>free</b> <b>form</b> <b>surface</b> {{is not an easy}} job as the tool path generation in present CAM technology is generally based on geometric computation so tool path are not optimum. The geometry can also be not described explicitly so errors and discontinuities occurrence in the solid structure cannot be avoided. Free-form surfaces are machined with the help of different tool path generation method like adaptive iso-planar tool path generation, constant scallop tool path generation, adaptive iso-parametric method, iso-curvature, isophote and by other methods. The different methods are chosen based on the parameters which is needed to be optimized.|$|E
50|$|CNC {{plunge milling}} {{is often called}} z-axis milling also. In this process, the feed is {{provided}} linearly along the tool axis while doing CNC processing. Plunge milling is very good method for rough machining process of complex shape or free form shapes like impeller parts. In multi axis plunge milling, the optimization of plunge cutter section selection and generating the tool path for <b>free</b> <b>form</b> <b>surface</b> {{is very important to}} improve the efficiency and effectiveness. In plunge milling, after each plunge the milling cutter is offset by some value and then the material surface is removed in the form of lunula. The material removal rate is computed by area of lunula and the feed rate. At the entry and exit of milling cutter, the radial offset has not any influence on the condition of surface. At the maximum cutting velocity, the surface obtained is clean whatever the feed rate per tooth on entry but on exit the high value of feed rate gives the deteriorated surface. The surface roughness value always increases with feed rate in plunge milling.The simulation of dynamic uncut chip thickness which is generated by plunge milling can be done by tracking the position of plunge cutter center. This simulation shows the regenerative effect with variation of phase difference. Then the model of uncut chip thickness and cutting force coefficient with cutting edge radius are entered into time domain model. Finally, with the help of time domain solution the stability of machine and vibrations are estimated.The cutting parameters {{play a key role in}} plunge milling. The cutting force and machine stability both are influenced by machining parameters. Frequency domain model can be used to estimate the machining stability.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the notion of}} <b>free</b> <b>form</b> feature for {{aesthetic}} design is presented. The design of industrial products constituted by <b>free</b> <b>form</b> <b>surfaces</b> is done by using CAD systems representing curves and surfaces by means of NURBS functions, which are usually defined by low level entities that are not intuitive and require some knowledge of the mathematical language. Similarly to the feature-based approach adopted by CAD systems for classical mechanical design, a set of high level modelling entities which provides commonly performed shape modifications has been identified. Particularly, the paper suggests a classification of the so-called detail features for an aesthetic and/or functional characterization of predefined <b>free</b> <b>form</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Feature types are formally described {{by means of an}} analytical definition of the surface modification through deformation and elimination laws.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} study the {{influence}} of end mill tool geometries toward machining performances. In this project, two type of end mill tool have been used which are ball nose end mill and bull nose end mill and two type of tool path have been selected which are one way next and zigzag tool path {{in order to determine}} the effects of both tool and tool path toward machining performances of surface roughness and machining time. The cutting parameter in this project are spindle speed, feed rate and depth of cut. The machine used in this project is Makino KE 55 CNC milling machine. The impact of end mill tool geometry on the surface roughness was determined by the testing the workpiece using Surface Roughness Tester. The machining time was determined by the CATIA V 5 software and by the real machining time. Measurement of surface roughness has indicated that the bull nose end mill gives lower surface roughness compare to ball nose end mill when machine an incline surface. In other hand, ball nose end mill give lower surface roughness for <b>free</b> <b>form</b> <b>surface.</b> For machining time, the real machining time is longer than the machining time by the CATIA. The machining data has indicated that ball nose has longer machining time compare to bull nose end mill for machining time of incline and <b>free</b> <b>form</b> <b>surface.</b> In term of tool path, for incline surface zigzag tool path gives better surface than one way tool path and for <b>free</b> <b>form</b> <b>surface</b> one way gives better surface roughness compare to zigzag tool path.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to rendering triangular algebraic <b>free</b> <b>form</b> <b>surfaces.</b> A hierarchical subdivision of the surface with associated tight bounding volumes provides for quick identification of the surface regions likely to be hit by a ray. For each leaf of the hierarchy an approximation to the corresponding surface region is stored. The approximation is used to compute a good starting point for the iteration, which ensures rapid convergence. Trimming curves are described by a tree of trimming primitives such as squares, circles, polygons and <b>free</b> <b>form</b> curves combined with Boolean operations. For trimmed surfaces an irregular adaptive subdivision is constructed to quickly eliminate all parts outside the trimming curve from consideration during rendering. Cost heuristics are introduced to optimize the rendering time further. 1.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel {{algorithm}} {{to evaluate the}} possible point matches established by the traditional ICP algorithm {{in the process of}} matching two overlapping <b>free</b> <b>form</b> <b>surfaces</b> represented as two sets of unorganised points. While the existing methods mainly use feature matching to establish or evaluate possible correspondences between the surfaces to be matched, our novel approach applies motion consistency to evaluate the possible correspondences. In particular, while the existing methods assume that satisfying local structural constraints is a necessary condition for a pair of points to represent a real correspondence, our novel approach proves that satisfying global rigid motion constraints is a sufficient condition. A comparative study based on real images has shown that the proposed algorithm is accurate and robust for the matching of overlapping <b>free</b> <b>form</b> <b>surfaces.</b> I...|$|R

5000|$|However, {{building}} {{feature recognition}} systems that function effectively on real industrial products has been elusive. A real product {{with hundreds of}} faces and end edges brings almost all the above approaches to a halt due to computational complexity. Furthermore, the features studied in these approaches are usually over simplified. The bulk of the feature recognition literature normally deals with 2.5D features (those made by sweeping a 2D profile along a linear axis). Graph representations, hint definitions or volume decompositions are {{much more difficult to}} define for 3D and <b>free</b> <b>form</b> features.

40|$|AbstractAn {{enhanced}} Force model based Feedrate Scheduling (FFS) {{technique for}} rough cutting of parts with complex <b>free</b> <b>form</b> <b>surfaces</b> in 5 -axis machining is presented. In order {{to estimate the}} cutting forces in complex 5 -axis machining an enhanced solid modeler kernel based model is developed to find the complicated engagement between cutter and workpiece for each cutter location. In this paper, cutter-workpiece engagement model is presented using the commercial Parasolid solid modeler kernel, and then cutting forces are estimated based on the developed model. In this approach, the resultant cutting forces are kept constant on a user defined threshold. The feedrate will be adjusted to keep the resultant cutting forces constant all along the tool path. Therefore, it is shown that this approach allows decreasing the cycling time drastically. The scheduled feedrate in each cutter location is carried out in NC blocks using an off-line postprocessor {{that can be used}} in commercial CAM software.
