I want them to know that I'm down with it if they want me to, but I completely understand if it doesn't necessarily work ... They've got a lot of story lines going on there." [...] But in March 2012, Shonda Rhimes said that there are no plans at the moment for the character to return, [...] "I think it was really nice to hear her appreciating the show. At the same time we are on a track we have been planning. The idea of changing that track is not something we are interested in right now." [...] Three years later, Rhimes said she has completely moved on from the idea of Izzie coming back, “I’m done with that story. I’ve turned that idea over in my mind a thousand times and thought about how it would go. And I don’t think so.” ...|$|E
