5|$|Like many {{residents}} of the rural areas in central Madagascar at that time, Rakoto's brothers played the sodina, an end-blown tube traditionally made of bamboo or reed with three or six finger holes and a thumb hole down its length. One {{of the oldest and}} most iconic musical instruments in Madagascar, it is believed to have arrived on the island with the earliest settlers from Borneo around 2,000 years ago and remains widespread throughout the central highlands. Young Rakoto began playing the sodina when he was seven years old. He honed his skills by listening to village elders' sodina performances, and three years later the boy formed a small musical group called Ambohijatobe that performed locally at traditional festivities. During this period Rakoto had the opportunity to participate in a community musical competition. His competitors, who performed on accordions and guitars, threw stones at Rakoto when <b>he</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>forward</b> to perform on the sodina. Despite being struck in the face he completed his performance and was awarded first prize. In 1935 he was nominated by the local governor to represent his district in a national musical competition organized by the French colonial authority at Mahamasina stadium in Antananarivo. That same year Rakoto was orphaned at the age of 12, preventing him from further pursuing an education in the interest of earning a livelihood. A Frenchman hired the boy to work as an assistant baker until he came of age. Upon reaching adulthood, Rakoto left the bakery to become a metalworker while continuing to perform on the sodina in musical ensembles.|$|E

25|$|Trueman {{played in}} all five Tests against New Zealand in 1958, taking 15 wickets {{in the series}} {{at an average of}} 17.06. This was a wet summer and most of the bowling in the series was done by spinners, but Trueman still managed 5–31 in the first Test at Edgbaston. He pulled off a {{remarkable}} anticipatory catch in the Lord's Test when <b>he</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>forward</b> from his short leg position to catch the ball off a defensive stroke with his hand on the batsman's boot. In the Final Test at the Oval, he made the highest score of his whole Test career with 39 not out in twenty minutes, including three sixes off Alex Moir.|$|E

500|$|Cutts ordered Brigadier-General Archibald Rowe's brigade to attack. The English {{infantry}} {{rose from}} the edge of the Nebel, and silently marched towards Blenheim, a distance of some [...] John Ferguson's Scottish brigade supported Rowe's left, and moved in perfect order towards the barricades between the village and the river, defended by Hautefeuille's dragoons. As the range closed to within , the French fired a deadly volley. Rowe had ordered that there should be no firing from his men until he struck his sword upon the palisades, but as <b>he</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>forward</b> to give the signal, he fell mortally wounded. The survivors of the leading companies closed up the gaps in their torn ranks and rushed forward. Small parties penetrated the defences, but repeated French volleys forced the English back towards the Nebel, sustaining heavy casualties. As the attack faltered, eight squadrons of elite Gens d'Armes, commanded by the veteran Swiss officer, Beat-Jacques von Zurlauben, fell upon the English troops, cutting at the exposed flank of Rowe's own regiment. However, Wilkes' Hessian brigade, lying nearby in the marshy grass at the water's edge, stood firm and repulsed the Gens d'Armes with steady fire, enabling the English and Hessians to re-order and launch another attack.|$|E
2500|$|Chris Jessee, {{a member}} of the Longhorns {{football}} operations staff and Mack Brown’s stepson, stepped onto the field and bent down as if to pick up the bouncing ball. [...] Jessee thought that the ball was an incomplete forward pass and he was making the signal for intentional grounding as <b>he</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>forward.</b> [...] The ball came close to Jessee’s hands but it was not clear if he managed to touch it or if it bounced over his hands cleanly. [...] Texas' Roy Miller slapped the ball, keeping it in-bounds. [...] Aaron Lewis picked up the ball and advanced it 13yards to the Arizona State 44-yard line.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{not known}} to what {{statement}} by Braham Lamb refers in this passage; no document or publication has been identified in which Braham writes of his religion. Nor, as Lamb hints, {{is there any evidence}} of Braham's actual conversion. However the passage is undoubtedly associated with Braham's marriage to (the Gentile) Miss Bolton of Manchester in 1816. This followed a traumatic period for Braham in which his personal affairs were often before the public. Having fallen out with, and abandoned, Nancy Storace, he had travelled to France in 1815 with a Mrs. Wright, whose husband sued him for criminal conversation (and eventually was awarded £1000). While the suit was pending, Braham had the unusual experience of being hissed during a performance of Handel's Israel in Egypt (the very piece cited by Lamb in his 1821 essay), on which <b>he</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>forward</b> and addressed the audience: ...|$|E

2500|$|Born in Kullavik, Sweden, Torsten Billman disliked school, {{with the}} drawing lessons {{as the only}} exception. During a drawing lesson with a {{substitute}} teacher Torsten had {{on a piece of}} blotting paper drawn a detailed composition, which was supposed to represent an Indian with his tent and utensils. [...] "After the teacher had inspected the pictures produced by the class, Torsten was called to his desk. He expected a sympathetic judgment from the teacher; yes, he also hoped that he might impress a certain girl in the class. So <b>he</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>forward</b> fearlessly. He had hardly reached the plattform when he received such a box on the ear that he fell to the floor. As he crestfallen rose to return to his own desk he was further rebuked by the teacher, who ordered him immediately to fling the drawing in the red-hot stove." [...] "It was my first vernissage", said Torsten Billman.|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} speculated that the murder {{was the result of}} a power struggle, a {{financial}} dispute over Burzum records, or an attempt at [...] "outdoing" [...] the stabbing in Lillehammer. Vikernes denies all of these rumours, stating that he killed Euronymous in self-defense: he says that Euronymous had plotted to stun him with an electroshock weapon, tie him up and torture him to death while videotaping the event. Vikernes explains: [...] "If he was talking about it to everybody and anybody I wouldn't have taken it seriously. But he just told a select group of friends, and one of them told me." [...] He said Euronymous planned to use a meeting about an unsigned contract to ambush him. Blackthorn stood outside smoking while Vikernes climbed the stairs to Euronymous' apartment on the fourth floor. Vikernes said he met Euronymous at the door and handed him the contract, but when <b>he</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>forward</b> and confronted Euronymous, Euronymous [...] "panicked" [...] and kicked him in the chest. The two got into a struggle and Vikernes stabbed Euronymous to death. Vikernes contends that most of Euronymous' cut wounds were caused by broken glass he had fallen on during the struggle. After the slaying, Vikernes and Blackthorn drove back to Bergen. On the way, they stopped at a lake where Vikernes disposed of his bloodstained clothes. The self-defense story is doubted by Emperor drummer Faust.|$|E
2500|$|Burke was {{not merely}} {{presenting}} a peace agreement to Parliament; rather, <b>he</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>forward</b> with four reasons against using force, carefully reasoned. He laid out his objections in an orderly manner, focusing on one {{before moving to the}} next. His first concern was that the use of force would have to be temporary, and that the uprisings and objections to British governance in America would not be. Second, Burke worried about the uncertainty surrounding whether Britain would win a conflict in America. [...] "An armament", Burke said, [...] "is not a victory". Third, Burke brought up the issue of impairment; it would do the British Government no good to engage in a scorched earth war and have the object they desired (America) become damaged or even useless. The American colonists could always retreat into the mountains, but the land they left behind would most likely be unusable, whether by accident or design. The fourth and final reason to avoid the use of force was experience; the British had never attempted to rein in an unruly colony by force, and they did not know if it could be done, let alone accomplished thousands of miles away from home. Not only were all of these concerns reasonable, but some turned out to be prophetic—the American colonists did not surrender, even when things looked extremely bleak, and the British were ultimately unsuccessful in their attempts to win a war fought on American soil.|$|E

2500|$|Cowdrey {{replaced}} Trevor Bailey as Peter May's vice-captain for {{the tour}} of Australia. He was not confident that he could lead the veteran England team in May's absence, but this was Bailey's last tour and Cowdrey needed to be tested as a future England captain. The disastrous 1958-59 Ashes series began well enough with Cowdrey scoring of 65 not out, 78 and 100 not out against the state teams, but when deputising as captain Cowdrey was run out by Ian Huntington after <b>he</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>forward</b> after an lbw appeal. Later on the tour he struck 101 runs in 84 minutes with 10 boundaries to win a jovial match against the Prime Minister's XI by four wickets. England lost the first two Tests, but Cowdrey's 100 not out saved the Third Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground, adding 182 with May (92) and spending 80 minutes in the 90s. Cowdrey's 84 could not save the Fourth Test at the Adelaide Oval, and he was bowled by the 'Blond Giant' Gordon Rorke, whose seven foot stride and his long drag took him three yards down the wicket before he released the ball, and Cowdrey joked [...] "I was frightened that he might tread on my toes". The Fifth Test saw Cowdrey in fine form with seven boundaries in his 44, but he was run out when he trotted in for a single, even though the umpire was unsighted by the wicket-keeper Wally Grout. Cowdrey took strike again unaware of his dismissal until {{he was asked to}} depart. England lost the Test as Australia recovered the Ashes 4–0. Cowdrey made only 20 runs (10.00) in the follow up tour of New Zealand, which England won 1–0.|$|E
2500|$|On {{obtaining the}} summit of the ridge the allied column found itself facing the French {{infantry}} line. The French guards rose and advanced towards the crest, whereupon the two forces confronted each other at a distance of 30 paces. The moment was immortalised by Lord Charles Hay of the 1st Regiment of Guards who later wrote that <b>he</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>forward,</b> took out a hip flask and drank with a flourish, shouting out to his opponent, [...] "We are the English Guards, and we hope you will stand till we come up to you, and not swim the Scheldt as you did the Main at Dettingen." [...] He then led his men in three cheers. Voltaire's version of this famous episode has become proverbial. He wrote: [...] "The English officers saluted the French by doffing their hats … [...] the French, returned the greeting. My Lord Charles Hai, captain in the English Guards, cried, 'Gentlemen of the French Guards, fire.' The Comte d'Auteroche, then lieutenant of Grenadiers, shouted, 'Gentlemen, we never fire first; fire yourselves.'" [...] The French were the first to fire, the volley was somewhat ineffective but threw the Third Guards into some confusion and wounded George Churchill, the commander of the guards brigade. Captain Lord Panmure led the unbroken companies of the Third Guards to the flank of the First Guards. Up to this point the British column had not fired a single musket shot, but now the allied infantry poured a devastating discharge into the French. The volley of musketry with the battalion guns delivering numerous rounds of grape-shot, swept away the front rank of the ten battalions of the French first line, killing and wounding between 700–800 men, breaking the Gardes Françaises, while the Gardes Suisses and the four battalions of the Brigade Aubeterre were driven back by the British advance.|$|E
2500|$|Continuing east the MCC team came to Melbourne to play Victoria, a {{stronger}} proposition than South Australia. Their captain was the Australian opener Colin McDonald and their wicket-keeper Len Maddocks {{and the two}} young bowlers Lindsay Kline and Ian Meckiff who had done well on the recent tour of South Africa. With Peter May still resting his knee vice-captain Colin Cowdrey was in charge, winning the toss and electing to bat on a good wicket. Fred Trueman and Frank Tyson were rested and after Adelaide {{it was decided to}} use both spin bowlers again even though it was thought only one would be used the Tests. Peter Richardson was caught off Meckiff's [...] third ball, whose action caused immediate interest. [...] "He bowled fast left-arm over the wicket with one or two really very quick ones which had the suspicion of a throw about them". Arthur Milton gloved a dropped catch going for hook, but settled down with his Gloucestershire team-mate Tom Graveney who was in fine form. [...] "Long Tom" [...] was out l.b.w. trying to pull a ball that stayed low with the score on 54, but Milton (116) added 197 with Raman Subba Row (83). McDonald brought on Kline (3/126), but his Chinaman were expensive and failed to turn. Meckiff removed Subba Row and Colin Cowdrey was run out by Ian Huntington after <b>he</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>forward</b> after an l.b.w. appeal. Tony Lock came in as nightwatchman and belted 44 in under an hour, which was appreciated by the 26,000 crowd more than Trevor Bailey's slow innings. Everybody made double figures except the first and last batsmen and the MCC totalled 396, Meckiff (4/69) being the best of the Victorian bowlers. Brian Statham and Peter Loader opened the bowling, but after [...] "George" [...] bowled opener Neil Crompton Laker and Lock were brought on and each took a wicket, Laker getting McDonald for 53 and Lock Allen Aylett for 23. After the rest day Victoria resumed on 119/3 and Statham demonstrated why his motto was [...] "if they miss, I hit" [...] catching one wicket leg before and clean bowling another five in his 7/47, including Ian Huntington for 73. When asked about the slow pitch he replied [...] "Well, if it's slow you’ve got to bowl faster" [...] With Victoria out for 252 the MCC had a lead of 144 and went for quick runs. Milton was run out by Huntington when sent back by Richardson (40), but Tom Graveney (78 not out) took the score to 149/3 and Cowdrey declared on the fourth morning after the two minutes silence for Remembrance Day. Victoria needed 296 runs in four hours and to McDonald's credit he went for the win, top-scoring with 62. Statham had no luck, Laker and Loader were ill with sun-stroke, but Tony Lock took 6/70, helped by three catches in a row by Milton. He managed to find turn and bounce and won the game by taking two wickets in the last over of the day. The tourists thought Ian Meckiff was a thrower, but not a very good one, no complaint was made and the MCC lost the chance ensure that he did not play in the Tests without too much fuss.|$|E
