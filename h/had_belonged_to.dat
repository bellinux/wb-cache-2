5|$|The Lithuanian {{port city}} of Klaipėda (Memel in German) had {{historically}} {{been a member of}} the German Hanseatic League, and <b>had</b> <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> Germany and East Prussia prior to 1918.

5|$|The Norman Kingdom {{was created}} on Christmas Day, 1130, by RogerII of Sicily, with the {{agreement}} of Pope Innocent II, who united the lands Roger had inherited from his father RogerI of Sicily.

Roger threw his support behind the Antipope AnacletusII, who enthroned him as King of Sicily on Christmas Day 1130.|$|E
5|$|Welsh raids at the {{beginning}} of Stephen's reign had driven Bethune's former canons from Llanthony and the bishop gave them refuge at Hereford before establishing them at a new site near Gloucester. The land the canons were settled on <b>had</b> <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> the diocese, and this led Bethune into conflict with his cathedral chapter, led by their dean, Ralph. Bethune was forced to travel to Pisa to secure an order from Innocent II declaring that the chapter obey their bishop.|$|E
5|$|After the Bolshevik {{revolution}} in October 1917, Russia quickly disintegrated into civil war. Negotiations {{for the release}} of the Romanovs between their Bolshevik (commonly referred to as 'Reds') captors and their extended family, many of whom were prominent members of the royal houses of Europe, stalled. As the Whites (anti-Bolshevik forces, although not necessarily supportive of the Tsar) advanced toward Yekaterinburg, the Reds were in a precarious situation. The Reds knew Yekaterinburg would fall to the better manned and equipped White Army. When the Whites reached Yekaterinburg, the imperial family had simply disappeared. The most widely accepted account was that the family had been murdered. This was due to an investigation by White Army investigator Nicholas Sokolov, who came to the conclusion based on items that <b>had</b> <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> the family being found thrown down a mine shaft at Ganina Yama.|$|E

5|$|Beth Hamedrash was the prototypical American synagogue {{for early}} {{immigrant}} Eastern European Jews, who began entering the United States {{in large numbers}} only in the 1870s. They found the synagogues of the German Jewish immigrants who preceded them to be unfamiliar, both religiously and culturally. Russian Jews in particular had been more excluded from Russian society than were German Jews from German society, for both linguistic and social reasons. Unlike German Jews, the Jews who founded Beth Hamedrash viewed both religion and the synagogue as central to their lives. They attempted to re-create in Beth Hamedrash the kind of synagogue they <b>had</b> <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> in Europe.|$|E

According to the indictment, Moshe Malul and fugitive Vineland Boyz′ member Luis Sandoval, were at the scene when Atias was shot, but another man had pulled the trigger. Itzhak Abergil had offered to help with the slaying during a meeting in Spain, but he did not play a direct role in the killing.|$|E
5|$|The {{conflict}} between Stephen and Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II worsened when both laid their {{claims to the}} historical region of Bessarabia, now known {{under the name of}} Budjak. The region <b>had</b> <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> Wallachia, but later succumbed to Moldavian influence under Petru I of Moldavia and was possibly annexed to Moldavia in the late 14th century by Roman I of Moldavia. Under Alexandru cel Bun, it had {{become an integral part of}} Moldavia and was successfully defended in 1420 against the first Ottoman attempt to capture castle Chilia. The ports of Chilia and Akkerman (Romanian: Cetatea Albă) were essential for Moldavian commerce. The old trade route from Caffa, Akkerman, and Chilia passed through Suceava in Moldavia and Lwow in Poland (now in Ukraine).|$|E
