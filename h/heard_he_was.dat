5|$|As a judge, Parker was {{notable for}} {{independently}} researching each {{case that he}} <b>heard.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> {{generally considered to be}} pro-labor and was an active supporter of social reform legislation, for example upholding a maximum-hours law as constitutional. In the 1902 decision Roberson v. Rochester Folding Box Co, Parker found against a woman whose face had been used in advertisements without her permission, ruling that this use did not violate her common law privacy rights. The decision was unpopular in the press and led to the passage of a privacy law by the New York State Legislature the following year. In the same year, Parker upheld the death sentence given to convicted murderer Martha Place, who became the first woman to be executed by electric chair.|$|E

25|$|From infancy, Rabbi Chaim Ozer {{was weak}} and sickly. However, he was gifted with a {{tremendous}} memory, never forgetting anything he had ever read or <b>heard.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> also a deep thinker who developed clear explanations for every Torah topic he studied. At the age of 9, he was tested by Rabbi Yisroel Salanter, who asked the boy a question in halakha along with his own answer. The little Chaim Ozer refuted the Rav's thesis and cited a different one from the sources, astounding the Rav.|$|E

[...] "When I <b>heard</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> working with Michele Ferrari, I was devastated," [...] LeMond {{was quoted as saying}} of Armstrong. [...] "If Lance is clean, it is the greatest comeback in the history of sports. If he isn't, it would be the greatest fraud." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to Bailey's storyline, which she deemed [...] "not surprising", West stated: [...] "He tells Bailey that it's her {{that will eventually}} be Chief when she’s ready. Miranda's reaction could {{only be described as}} shock. While the other residents were running around trying to get information, she was so busy working on the free clinic project that she hadn’t even <b>heard</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> retiring." [...] The story of the two Amish girls was deemed [...] "a little side story, which was actually quite touching and well written", being praised for the realistic portrayals and the effects the storyline had on Stevens. [...] "I don't think I've ever realized that Callie and Cristina never really interacted before. When they did speak to one another the episode, their personalities clash right away. At first they were snippy to one another but the two bonded after slicing open a runner's legs and then operating on him.", assessed West, in {{response to}} Torres and Yang's arc, which was described as [...] "an obvious parallel {{to the rest of the}} episode". West compared the reaction of Yang and Torres following the proposals, by noting that the former was [...] "surprised and maybe a little bit touched", whereas Torres expressed fear and concern: [...] "She's worried that he's only proposing because he's still getting over the loss of his dad and just needs someone to cling to. I adore George, but he's a mess right now and needs to get stuff straightened out before he makes any lifelong commitments." ...|$|E

500|$|During {{the time}} that the robot is gone, Antimony meets a {{creature}} called Reynardine, who tries to take over her body but, by accident, instead becomes trapped in the body of a stuffed animal she carries; and becomes subject to her command. Because of her relationship with Reynardine and the events with Coyote and Ysengrin, Antimony is nominated to begin training to become a medium, one of the individuals who moderate disputes between the Wood and the Court and communicates with etheric beings, and she decides to return to the woods to speak with Coyote. When Antimony visits Coyote, she learns that in the past Coyote had travelled across the sea to find Renard (called later Reynardine) and Ysengrin and make them into [...] "powerful being" [...] like himself.Antimony: [...] "Why were you looking for Renard in the first place? [...] Why bring him here?"Coyote: [...] "I sought to make him into a powerful being such as myself!" [...] He had given Ysengrin [...] "power over the trees" [...] and given Reynardine the power to take bodies, but bodies that Reynardine took always died after he left themCoyote: [...] "For some reason, when Renard had the ability , any body he took that was not his own would die when it was used up." [...] and Ysengrin was hardly strong enough to stand without the help of Coyote's tree armor. Reynardine had been in love with Antimony's mother, Surma,Coyote: [...] "I wouldn't be surprised if he cared very deeply about you, ! You see, Renard fell desperately in love with Surma!" [...] and had used his power to steal a young man's body and woo Surma; the man died, however, and Reynardine was imprisoned in Gunnerkrigg Court until the events surrounding his first meeting with Antimony.Coyote: [...] " [...] soon runs away!

500|$|Jay-Z {{opened his}} set at Glastonbury 2008 {{with a cover}} of Oasis' song [...] "Wonderwall". When Gallagher {{was asked about the}} {{incident}} he replied, [...] "The way it's played itself out is that I said Jay-Z had no right to play Glastonbury, which is a crock of horseshit. I got off a plane and someone asked me about the fact that Glastonbury hadn't sold {{out for the first time}} in years, and if it was because of Jay-Z. From there it grew into this crap that I was standing on an orange crate at Speakers' Corner saying, 'Gather round, brothers and sisters. Have you heard what's happening at Glastonbury this year?' I have a certain turn of phrase. So if I say, [...] "Chicken sandwiches in McDonald's are just plain fucking wrong," [...] it doesn't mean I'm attacking all chickens or all sandwiches. I've hung out with Jay-Z in Tokyo. I've seen his show. It's not my bag, but it's all right. We have a mutual friend in Chris Martin. So I am a guy who doesn't like hip-hop—shock, horror. I don't dislike rappers or hip-hop or people who like it. I went to the Def Jam tour in Manchester in the '80s when rap was inspirational. Public Enemy were awesome. But it's all about status and bling now, and it doesn't say anything to me." [...] When Jay-Z was asked about Gallagher's comments he said [...] "I haven't spoken to him , I <b>heard</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> reaching out. I don't bear any grudge, it's all good. I just believe in good music and bad music, I've always said that. You look at any interview from the beginning of time, I've always stated that I don't believe in the lines and classifications that people put music in so they can easily define it". When asked who he would be interested in collaborating with in the future, the rapper said, [...] "Anyone. Oasis as well – it doesn't matter to me." ...|$|E
2500|$|As McMahon later stated, [...] "I {{realised}} what I {{wanted to}} do was work with a good synth player [...] – a very good synth player. So I mucked around with a few guys in Sydney but their range was too narrow then I remembered hearing Peter Carolan's playing ten years ago. He was playing a dulcimer in the bush and when I <b>heard</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> now playing synth I knew straight away this was the melody man to compose that key part of Gondwanland." [...] They worked on their first composition, [...] "Pulse," [...] inspired by the sound of a heartbeat.|$|E

2500|$|David Lloyd George said of Gladstone in 1915: [...] "What {{a man he}} was! Head and {{shoulders}} above anyone else I have ever seen in the House of Commons. I did not like him much. He hated Nonconformists and Welsh Nonconformists in particular, {{and he had no}} real sympathy with the working-classes. But he was far and away the best Parliamentary speaker I have ever <b>heard.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> not so good in exposition." [...] Asquithian Liberals continued to advocate traditional Gladstonian policies of sound finance, peaceful foreign relations and the better treatment of Ireland. They often compared Lloyd George unfavourably with Gladstone.|$|E
2500|$|A 2006 {{column in}} the Birmingham News (Alabama) {{reported}} about people who remembered Bush {{when he was in}} Alabama, working for the Blount campaign: [...] "None have specific recollections about Bush and the National Guard. Some <b>heard</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> serving but never saw for themselves." [...] Opinions of him during his time working on the campaign ranged from good (amiable, well liked, and fond of sports) to bad (bragging about drinking and allegations he trashed a cottage where he was living). [...] Winton Blount's son Tom said [...] "He was an attractive person, kind of a 'frat boy.' I didn't like him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cleutin {{returned}} to France {{and continued to}} serve Mary. He fought {{at the battle of}} Dreux in December 1562 and was made a Knight by Charles IX. [...] In September 1562 he was in Heidelberg where his purpose was to declare against the opinion of François de Coligny d'Andelot that the troubles in France were not caused by religion. At the end of 1563 he was to speak to the Pope on behalf of Charles IX of France asking him not to take action against the Protestant Kingdom of Navarre. He became France's diplomat in Rome in January 1564. Brantôme gave a lengthy anecdote of his conduct there as a man of the sword rather than a man of letters, and Lebourier published two of Cleutin's letters to Bernardin Bochetel illustrating his temperament. In March 1565, Thomas Randolph <b>heard</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> in Rome trying to arrange for Mary to marry the Charles IX of France.|$|E

2500|$|Ormandy was {{particularly}} noted for conducting late Romantic and early 20th century music. He particularly favored Bruckner, Debussy, Dvořák, Ravel, Richard Strauss, Tchaikovsky, Sibelius, and transcriptions of Bach. His performances of Beethoven, Brahms, Haydn, and Mozart were considered less successful by some critics, {{especially when he}} applied the lush, so-called [...] "Philadelphia Sound" [...] to them. On the other hand, Donald Peck, principal flute of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, reports that a fellow flutist was won over when Ormandy conducted the Chicago in Beethoven's Ninth Symphony; he told Peck {{that it was the}} greatest Ninth he had ever <b>heard.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> particularly noted as a champion of Sergei Rachmaninoff's music, conducting the premiere of his Symphonic Dances and leading the orchestra in the composer's own recordings of three of his piano concertos in 1939–40. He also directed the American premiere of several symphonies by Dmitri Shostakovich. He made the first recording of Deryck Cooke's first performing edition of the complete Mahler Tenth Symphony, which many critics praised. His recording of Camille Saint-Saëns' Third Symphony received stellar reviews and is held in high regard. He also performed a great deal of American music and gave many premières of works by Samuel Barber, Paul Creston, David Diamond, Howard Hanson, Walter Piston, Ned Rorem, William Schuman, Roger Sessions, Virgil Thomson, and Richard Yardumian.|$|E
