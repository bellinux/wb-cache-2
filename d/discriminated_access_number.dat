50|$|Implementation of split-horizon DNS can be {{accomplished}} with hardware-based separation or by software solutions. Hardware-based implementations run distinct DNS server devices for the desired access granularity within the networks involved. Software solutions use either multiple DNS server processes on the same hardware or special server software with the built-in capability of <b>discriminating</b> <b>access</b> to DNS zone records. The latter is a common feature of many server software implementations of the DNS protocol (cf. Comparison of DNS server software) and is sometimes the implied {{meaning of the term}} split-horizon DNS, since all other forms of implementation can be achieved with any DNS server software.|$|R

50|$|There {{was no way}} {{for these}} small phone {{companies}} to identify the culprits of these hacks. They had no access to local phone company records of calls into their <b>access</b> <b>numbers,</b> {{and even if they}} had access, obtaining such records would be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming. While there was some advancement in tracking down these code hackers in the early 1990s, the problem did not completely disappear until most long distance companies were able to offer standard 1+ dialing without the use of an <b>access</b> <b>number.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Feature Group A: The {{original}} implementation, {{in which}} a user has to dial the local telephone number of a provider's gateway, followed by (usually) a password, then the desired long-distance number. There is a different local <b>access</b> <b>number</b> in each local calling area. This requires no special capability at the local telephone company office as competing long distance providers connected using standard local lines, {{which may or may}} not support caller ID. If a carrier has no local presence, a foreign exchange line is used to reach its nearest point of presence.

5000|$|Dial-around <b>access</b> <b>numbers</b> allow a {{landline}} user {{to call an}} 08 or 09 {{number to}} connect to a service that routes using LCR rather than direct routes.

5000|$|Most modern telephones, both {{mobile and}} fixed, have memory {{locations}} in which telephone numbers can be stored. Some telephones have facilities to make calls through a calling card service whose access details and PIN are also {{stored in the}} telephone's memory. This may be implemented in different ways, often by pressing one button before making a call; some telephones support [...] "chain dialing", allowing additional numbers to be dialed when on a call (e.g., dial a PIN and a second number after connecting to an <b>access</b> <b>number).</b> So long as long enough sequences can be stored {{it is possible to}} store an <b>access</b> <b>number,</b> pause, PIN, and ultimate telephone number in a single normal phone memory location.
