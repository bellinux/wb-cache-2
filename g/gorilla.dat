5|$|Cooper {{had said}} that he thought of King Kong after he had a dream that a giant <b>gorilla</b> was terrorizing New York City. When he woke, he {{recorded}} the idea and used it for the film. He {{was going to have}} a giant <b>gorilla</b> fight a Komodo dragon or other animal, but found that the technique of interlacing that he wanted to use would not provide realistic results.|$|E

50|$|Mountain <b>gorillas</b> are an {{endangered}} species, {{with an estimated}} total population of about 650 individuals. There are no mountain <b>gorillas</b> in captivity. In the 1960s and 1970s, mountain <b>gorillas</b> were captured to begin a population of them in captive facilities. No baby <b>gorillas</b> survived in captivity, and no mountain <b>gorillas</b> are known of that are currently in captivity.|$|R
25|$|<b>Gorillas.</b> Initially, it {{was thought}} that <b>gorillas</b> did not pass the test, but there are now several {{well-documented}} reports of <b>gorillas</b> (such as Koko) passing the test.|$|R
25|$|Furthermore, in 2013, a {{study was}} {{conducted}} in order to better understand the genetic variation in <b>gorillas</b> by using reduced representation sequencing. This study consisted of a sample of 12 western lowland <b>gorillas</b> and two eastern lowland <b>gorillas</b> all in captivity. The study found that western lowland <b>gorillas</b> {{are more likely to be}} heterozygous than homozygous. Most pure (meaning they are not inbred) western lowland <b>gorillas</b> have a hom/het ratio that ranges from 0.5 to 0.7. Therefore, because of variation in these <b>gorillas,</b> it has been concluded that they display a moderate substructure within the western lowland population in general.|$|R

5|$|By this time, Angus Young {{had adopted}} his {{characteristic}} school-uniform stage outfit. The idea was his sister Margaret's. Angus had tried other costumes: Spider-Man, Zorro, a <b>gorilla,</b> and {{a parody of}} Superman, named Super-Ang. In its early days, {{most members of the}} band dressed in some form of glam or satin outfit.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{positive}} {{reception of the}} commercial in the United Kingdom and online, Cadbury Canada arranged to show the advertisements in 850cinemas across Canada throughout November 2007. Further online tie-ins were launched, including an online game and a competition to win a <b>gorilla</b> suit, a purple drum kit and a year's supply of bananas and Cadbury chocolate bars.|$|E
50|$|The show's creators {{have used}} the show to warn about <b>gorillas</b> {{becoming}} a critically endangered species. Money raised from merchandising, charges for SMS voting, and online auctions of paintings and photos of the Prague <b>gorillas</b> {{has been used to}} help wild <b>gorillas</b> in Africa. News about the <b>gorillas</b> supported in Africa is also reported on the project's website.|$|R
40|$|Kahuzi <b>gorillas</b> lived {{without any}} major {{disturbances}} since their habituation started in 1970. The wars from October 1996 to May 1997 and from August 1998 to June 2003 in the East of the Democratic Republic of Congo {{led to a}} large-scale slaughter of <b>gorillas.</b> The {{results of this study}} based on interviews with ex-poachers suggest that when habituated and non-habituated <b>gorillas</b> are exposed to similar poaching-pressures, the habituated <b>gorillas</b> {{are more likely to be}} killed than the non-habituated. The estimated ratio of killed habituated <b>gorillas</b> was as high as 71 % vs. 42 % for non-habituated <b>gorillas.</b> Habituated <b>gorillas</b> were 1. 6 times more susceptible to poaching than their non-habituated counterparts. It is recommended that habituation should not be expanded, although already habituated families should be maintained as such...|$|R
50|$|In the {{alternate}} timeline of the Flashpoint event, Changeling was {{member of the}} hyper-intelligent <b>gorillas</b> attacking in Namibe. When Traci Thirteen freed the citizens, Changeling betrays the <b>gorillas.</b> He turns into an insect and flies inside a <b>Gorilla's</b> head, before turning back into a human, tearing the <b>Gorilla's</b> head apart. He is told by Traci Thirteen {{to take care of}} the citizens.|$|R
5|$|Mulder {{contacts}} Frohike and Byers, who {{say that}} Fairfield {{is known for its}} animal disappearances and UFO sightings. They also mention Ambrose's <b>gorilla,</b> who is known to communicate using American Sign Language. Meanwhile, Scully follows one of Lang's activists as he sneaks into the zoo, running into Meecham inside. The activist attempts to free a tiger, but after a flash of light, the tiger seemingly disappears. The activist is promptly mauled to death, with the killing captured on his night vision camera. When questioned, Lang denies any responsibility for the death. Ambrose introduces the agents to the <b>gorilla,</b> Sophie, who has been cowering in her cage and expresses an apparent fear of light.|$|E
5|$|The genetic {{distance}} between blue and fin whales {{has been compared}} to that between a <b>gorilla</b> and human (3.5 million years on the evolutionary tree.) Nevertheless, hybrid individuals between blue and fin whales with characteristics of both are known to occur with relative frequency in both the North Atlantic and North Pacific.|$|E
5|$|Donkey Kong 64 is a 1999 {{adventure}} platform {{video game}} for the Nintendo 64 console, and {{the first in the}} Donkey Kong series to feature 3D gameplay. As the <b>gorilla</b> Donkey Kong, the player explores the themed levels of an island to collect items and rescue his kidnapped friends from K. Rool. The player completes minigames and puzzles as five playable Kong characters—each with its own special abilities—to receive bananas and other collectibles. In a separate multiplayer mode, up to four players can compete in deathmatch and last man standing games.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} a study {{examining}} the ability of western lowland <b>gorillas</b> to give to and exchange with humans. This involved humans holding objects such as fruit, leaves or peanuts in one hand. Once the <b>gorillas</b> had given twigs to the humans, they would receive one of these objects. If the <b>gorillas</b> did not give them a twig, they would not get their desired object. The <b>gorillas</b> were shown to quickly learn about receiving rewards as mistakes made by the <b>gorillas</b> {{in the beginning of}} the experiments gradually decreased.|$|R

50|$|When day breaks, {{they return}} to the city, {{discovering}} hieroglyphs that say that the people had taught the grey <b>gorillas,</b> a unique species due to the volcanic environment, to guard the mine and kill anyone that approached it. The group suspects that the <b>gorillas</b> turned on their masters but still protect the mine now. They find the diamond mine and Homolka starts to collect large diamonds, but a pack of <b>gorillas</b> appear and kill him. Munro, Karen, and Peter fight off the <b>gorillas</b> and flee deeper into the mine, where they discover Charles' body, holding a giant blue diamond. As Amy helps {{to fend off the}} <b>gorillas,</b> Karen is able to fit the diamond into a portable laser, using it to fire and ward off the <b>gorillas.</b> The volcano begins to erupt, and Munro, Karen, Peter, and Amy escape as the city is flooded with lava, killing the <b>gorillas.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>Gorilla</b> is a British {{advertising}} campaign launched by Cadbury Schweppes in 2007 to promote Cadbury Dairy Milk-brand chocolate. The 90-second television and cinema advertisement, which formed the centrepiece of the £6.2 million campaign, was created {{and directed by}} Juan Cabral and starred actor Garon Michael. The campaign itself, which comprised appearances on billboards, print newspapers and magazines, television and cinema spots, event sponsorships and an internet presence, was handled by advertising agency Fallon London, with the online segment contracted out to Hyper.|$|E
5|$|In May 2007, the {{government}} of Rwanda {{announced that it would}} name a baby <b>gorilla</b> after Irwin as a tribute to his work in wildlife conservation. Also in 2007, the state government of Kerala, India named the Crocodile Rehabilitation and Research Centre at Neyyar Wildlife Sanctuary in his honour; however, Terri objected that this action had been taken without her permission and asked the Kerala government in 2009 to stop using Irwin's name and images – a request with which the state government complied in mid-2009.|$|E
5|$|King Kong is a 2005 epic monster {{adventure}} film co-written, produced, {{and directed}} by Peter Jackson. A remake of the 1933 film of the same name, the film stars Naomi Watts, Jack Black, Adrien Brody, and, through motion capture, Andy Serkis as the title character. Set in 1933, King Kong {{tells the story of}} an ambitious filmmaker who coerces his cast and hired ship crew to travel to the mysterious Skull Island. There they encounter Kong, a legendary giant <b>gorilla,</b> whom they capture and take to New York City.|$|E
2500|$|In both Bwindi and the Virungas, {{groups of}} <b>gorillas</b> that were habituated for {{research}} and ecotourism have higher growth rates than unhabituated <b>gorillas,</b> according to computer modeling of their population dynamics. [...] Habituation means that through repeated, neutral contact with humans, <b>gorillas</b> exhibit normal behavior when people are in proximity. [...] Habituated <b>gorillas</b> are more closely guarded by field staff and they receive veterinary treatment for snares, respiratory disease, and other life-threatening conditions. [...] Nonetheless, researchers recommended that some <b>gorillas</b> remain unhabituated as a bet-hedging strategy against the risk of human pathogens being transmitted throughout the population.|$|R
25|$|Unlike the <b>gorillas</b> {{from the}} Congo {{side of the}} Virungas, the Karisoke area <b>gorillas</b> had never been {{partially}} habituated by Schaller's study; they knew humans only as poachers, and it took longer for Fossey {{to be able to}} study the Karisoke <b>gorillas</b> at a close distance.|$|R
50|$|<b>Gorillas</b> spend {{long hours}} feeding on plant matter every day. Groups are stable apes as they stay {{together}} {{for months and}} years at a time, much like {{the structure of a}} family. In comparison to the Western <b>Gorillas,</b> groups of eastern lowland <b>gorillas</b> are usually larger.|$|R
5|$|Lemurs {{vary greatly}} in size. They include the {{smallest}} primates {{in the world}} and, until recently, also included some of the largest. They currently {{range in size from}} about 30g (1.1oz) for Madame Berthe's mouse lemur (Microcebus berthae) up to 7–9kg (15–20lb) for the indri (Indri indri) and diademed sifaka (Propithecus diadema). When recently extinct species are considered, the size range extended up to that of a <b>gorilla</b> at 160–200kg (350–440lb) for Archaeoindris fontoynonti.|$|E
5|$|Rwanda's economy {{suffered}} heavily {{during the}} 1994 Rwandan Genocide, but has since strengthened. The economy is based mostly on subsistence agriculture. Coffee and tea {{are the major}} cash crops for export. Tourism is a fast-growing sector {{and is now the}} country's leading foreign exchange earner. Rwanda is one of only two countries in which mountain gorillas can be visited safely, and visitors pay for <b>gorilla</b> tracking permits. Music and dance {{are an integral part of}} Rwandan culture, particularly drums and the highly choreographed intore dance. Traditional arts and crafts are produced throughout the country.|$|E
5|$|Shooting {{took place}} over several days at Music Bank, the famous {{rehearsal}} studios in London. Actor Michael spent forty hours practising the drumming beforehand, but with vision inside the suit limited to a camera feed piped to a small screen inside the head, precision was almost impossible. Many takes ended with the wooden drum sticks broken against the rims, sending shards of wood flying off-camera. This, combined with the difficulty of choreographing the delicate movements of the <b>gorilla</b> head with Michael's acting, meant that 35takes were required to produce the final 90-second scene.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} match, {{which was}} not broadcast in the United Kingdom, pitted Crush against the Repo Man. Crush used his size advantage to perform a <b>Gorilla</b> press slam on Repo Man. Repo Man performed a back suplex, but Crush showed no sign that the move affected him. Crush continued to dominate the match with such moves as a belly to belly suplex. Repo Man eventually tried to attack Crush by jumping off the top rope, but Crush caught him and performed the Cranium Crunch to win the match by submission.|$|E
5|$|The third match saw Suzuki-gun's Davey Boy Smith Jr., Lance Archer, Shelton Benjamin, and Takashi Iizuka {{opposing}} Toru Yano and Pro Wrestling Noah representatives Naomichi Marufuji, Mikey Nicholls, and Shane Haste. Smith's powerbomb of Nicholls, Archer's chokeslam of Haste, and Benjamin's super overhead belly-to-belly throw of Marufuji {{were not}} enough for the victory; the opposing team overwhelmed Iizuka with a low blow by Yano, a double-team <b>gorilla</b> press slam by TMDK, and a Tiger Uppercut knee lift by Marufuji. This led to Marufuji scoring a pinfall on Iizuka at 5 minutes and 5 seconds.|$|E
