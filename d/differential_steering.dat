5000|$|The {{improved}} design {{incorporated a}} Continental V-12 [...] air-cooled, AVDS-1790-2 diesel engine, extending operational range to over 300 mi while reducing both refueling and servicing. Power was transmitted through a CD-850-6 cross drive transmission, a combined transmission, <b>differential,</b> <b>steering,</b> and braking unit.|$|E
5000|$|The gearbox {{had five}} forward and one reverse gears. The first gear was for [...] "confined spaces, on steep {{inclines}} or...sharp turns". The transmission {{was the new}} Merrit-Brown Z.5, which offered <b>differential</b> <b>steering</b> without clutching or braking, a major advance on previous designs. It gave the Cromwell superb maneuverability, with only the German Tiger I, using a similar design, able to match it.|$|E

50|$|Previously {{unavailable}} enthusiast driver {{aids are}} now optional, such as Audis Sport Rear <b>Differential,</b> active <b>steering</b> and adaptive damping suspension (part of the Audi Drive Select Package).

50|$|The company {{obtained}} a patent for a tank transmission using controlled <b>differential</b> <b>steering</b> system, {{known as the}} Merritt-Brown system, devised by Dr. H. E. Merritt, Director of Tank Design at Woolwich Arsenal, in 1935.

50|$|The Jiger was {{the first}} {{all-terrain}} vehicle (ATV). It was a six-wheeled amphibious ATV with <b>differential</b> <b>steering</b> via separate throttle control of its dual (left vs right) engines. The first Jigers were built-to-order beginning in 1961 by JGR Gunsport in Toronto and were mass-produced by Jiger Corporation beginning in 1965. Production of the Jiger ended in 1968 due to the financial weakness of the company, despite strong demand. Around 3337 Jigers were built.|$|E
50|$|As a {{farewell}} to the MR2, Toyota produced 1000 limited-production V-Edition cars for Japan and the UK. They are distinguished by different color wheels, titanium interior accents, minor body changes, a helical limited slip <b>differential,</b> and different <b>steering</b> wheel trim.|$|R

Unusually, the suspension subframes are directly connected to the chassis without rubber bushings. An optional head-up display comes with additional M-specific functions such as a gear display, rev counter and Optimum Shift Indicator.|$|R
50|$|The company, Bruce Nodwell Ltd., {{then began}} working on {{designing}} improvements to the powered trailer {{so that it would}} be a self-sufficient unit. The successful trailer was to be modified to include a cab and a <b>steering</b> <b>differential</b> device to make it into a self operating vehicle. Eventually, after a few unsuccessful attempts at finding or building a steering mechanism, the problem was solved by modifying an Oliver Tractor <b>steering</b> <b>differential.</b> The new vehicle was first called the Tracked Truck. However, everyone in the industry knew Bruce, because of his close contact with existing and potential customers, so they called the vehicle the “Nodwell”. Later, the vehicle became known as the Nodwell 110, indicating its payload in 100-pound units.|$|R

Its head and neck access 6 degrees of freedom. It moves using <b>differential</b> <b>steering</b> with two high-torque EC gear-motors, and runs Ubuntu 9.10 on a 1.6Ghz Intel Core Duo. It stands 1.5 m tall and weighs 85 kg. A new, fresh battery allows it to run freely for eight hours.|$|E
5000|$|A {{differentially}} steered robot {{is similar}} to the differential gears used in automobiles in that both the wheels can have different rates of rotations, but unlike the differential gearing system, a differentially steered system will have both the wheels powered. Differential wheeled robots are used extensively in robotics, since their motion is easy to program and can be well controlled. Virtually all consumer robots on the market today use <b>differential</b> <b>steering</b> primarily for its low cost and simplicity.|$|E
50|$|The {{tank was}} {{powered by a}} 570 {{horsepower}} Mitsubishi HM21 WT V12 turbocharged diesel mounted {{at the rear of}} the hull and exhausting through pipes on either side of the rear of the hull. The engine is coupled to a Mitsubishi manual transmission system which uses a controlled <b>differential</b> <b>steering</b> system. The track is driven from the front, and has six rubber road wheels on each side along with three return rollers. The suspension is a torsion bar system with the first, second and sixth road wheel fitted with hydraulic shock absorbers.|$|E
50|$|The K-44 {{features}} a driven double reduction front axle incorporating an interlockable <b>differential.</b> The <b>steering</b> knuckles are attached via bevel roller bearings, while the {{front drive shaft}} uses homokinetic joints. The wheel hubs incorporates planetary gears, which permits a higher ground clearance through {{the inclusion of a}} small differential unit. The front suspension uses 3.5 in wide by 1500 mm long leaf springs and telescopic shock absorbers. The wheel size is 8.0-20", and each wheel is held in place with ten nuts.|$|R
50|$|The car uses a donor pack from a BMW 3 Series.

50|$|The most {{conventional}} steering {{arrangement is}} to turn the front wheels using a hand-operated steering wheel which is positioned {{in front of the}} driver, via the steering column, which may contain universal joints (which may also be part of the collapsible steering column design), to allow it to deviate somewhat from a straight line. Other arrangements are sometimes found on different types of vehicles, for example, a tiller or rear-wheel steering. Tracked vehicles such as bulldozers and tanks usually employ <b>differential</b> <b>steering</b> — that is, the tracks are made to move at different speeds or even in opposite directions, using clutches and brakes, to bring about a change of course or direction.|$|E
50|$|Hydrostatic CVTs {{are common}} in small to {{medium-sized}} agricultural and earthmoving equipment. As the engines in these machines are typically run at constant power settings to provide hydraulic power or to power machinery, losses in mechanical efficiency are offset by enhanced operational efficiency, such as reduced forward-reverse shuttle times in earthmoving operations. Transmission output is varied to control both travel speed and direction. This is particularly beneficial in equipment designed to pivot or skid steer through differential power application as the required <b>differential</b> <b>steering</b> action can easily be supplied by independent CVTs, allowing steering to be accomplished without braking losses or loss of tractive effort and allowing the machine to pivot in place. In mowing or harvesting operations a CVT allows the forward speed of the tractor or combine harvester to be adjusted independently of the engine speed. This allows the operator to slow or accelerate as needed to accommodate variations in thickness of the crop.|$|E

5000|$|If a front-engine {{front-wheel-drive}} layout is {{fitted with}} a four-wheel-drive, plus enthusiast driver aids, such as active front <b>differential,</b> active <b>steering,</b> and ultra-quick electrically adjustable shocks, this somewhat negate the understeer problem and allow the car to perform {{as well as a}} front-engine rear-wheel-drive car. These trick differentials, which are found on the Acura TL SH-AWD and Audi S4 3.0 TFSI quattro, and Audi RS5 4.2 FSI quattro, are heavy, complex, and expensive. While these aids do tame front end plow, cars fitted with these systems are still at a disadvantage when track tested against rear-wheel drive vehicles (including those with added four-wheel drive).|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Biped {{locomotion}} for humanoid robots is {{a challenging}} {{problem that has}} come into prominence in recent years. As the degrees of freedom of a humanoid robot approaches to that of humans, {{the need for a}} better, robust, flexible and simpler maneuverability becomes inevitable for real or realistic environments. This paper presents a new method of controlling the trajectory of a humanoid robot on the basis of <b>differential</b> <b>steering</b> systems. To the best of our knowledge, {{this is the first time}} that such a technique has been applied on humanoid robots. It has been empirically shown that a humanoid robot can plan its trajectory by using the same principle applied in <b>differential</b> <b>steering</b> systems, and the change in its orientation can be easily calculated in degrees. Therefore, this method enables the robot to move in a desired curved-shape trajectory, instead of aligning itself with the target prior to walking or performing more complex and time consuming motions like diagonal walk or sidewalk. This method is also beneficial when further trajectory planning constraints such as obstacle avoidance are considered...|$|E
