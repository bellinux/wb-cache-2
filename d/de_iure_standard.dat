As presumed, the Chinese Constitution <b>de</b> <b>iure</b> does not meet all the {{requirements}} for effective constitution of the modern state and that between the Constitution of the PRC <b>de</b> <b>iure</b> and <b>de</b> facto exists a discrepancy relationship, the thesis aims to individually identify and analyze common constitutional and political elements which collectively create a real form of the Chinese Constitution de facto ("living" Constitution), upon which constitutional mechanisms of Chinese political life are based on. The work consists of three chapters, whereupon the work can be divided into two parts. The first part is the theoretical part, where the first chapter deals with defining the term of Constitution itself, whether from a purely normative point of view, as well as from other approaches, especially those from sociological and political science, which are crucial to properly understand the content of the Constitution de facto. Afterwards there is the categorization of various concepts of the Constitution, followed by the classification of different types of the Constiution [...] . ...|$|R
