40|$|In {{order to}} better {{understand}} the impact of increased loading on roads, studies on tyre-road interaction have gained prominence in recent years. Tyres form an essential <b>interface</b> <b>between</b> <b>vehicles</b> and road pavement surfaces. These are the only parts of the vehicle that are in contact with the road and transmit the vehicle loading to the road surface. The use of the Cartesian coordinate system is convenient in dealing with a uniform/non-uniform tyre load acting over a rectangular area, but few research reports are available that provide any form of theoretical solutions for pavement responses. This paper presents analytical solutions of responses due to rectangular loading acting on the surface of a multi-layered pavement system. The solutions developed incorporate both isotropic and cross-anisotropic material properties. The method followed is based on classical trigonometric integral and Fourier transformation of Navier’s equations. Accuracy and validity of the solutions are verified through comparisons with a proprietary finite element method (FEM) package. For this purpose, a pavement structure composed of five main layers constituted by isotropic and cross-anisotropic (also known as transversely isotropic) material properties is analysed. In order to vary some of the layer properties with depth, the main layers were sub-layered, resulting in a 17 -layer pavement system.

40|$|The {{automotive}} industry use simulation tools {{to improve their}} products and increase the rate of development. In order {{to rely on the}} simulated results, robust and detailed models are necessary to capture behaviours that would be present in a real setting. This is of particular importance when models are used in driving simulators; a tool which today is considered a necessity within motorsport. The driver then need to know that the feedback provided by the model can be trusted so that realism can be maximised. From a vehicle dynamics and driving experience point of view, detailed tyre models are therefore required, since they act as the <b>interface</b> <b>between</b> <b>vehicle</b> and road. In motorsport, tyres are being used at high stress levels for long periods of time, innevitably causing their visco-elastic rubber to change its properties and thereby affect overall vehicle performance. The driver needs to keep that in mind when handling the car, but also engineers when determining an appropriate suspension setup. Acquiring better understanding of how tyre performance evolve during a session will therefore aid in deriving ways of modifying its enabling factors in simulation environments. It has been understood {{that it is important to}} not only consider degradation as abrasive wear, but also as a change of rubber damping and elasticity. Deriving ways of taking this into account was essential for it to provide accurate results. A model consisting of seven submodels has been developed, where one is responsible for distributing the load over the width of the tyre, and one will estimate temperatures of unsprung components that affect tyre performance. The remaining five will model different physical phenomena, which come together to change the car characteristics. It was proven that the subjective experience connected to a change of tyre performance could be replicated in a driving simulator, using the model developed as part of this thesis. The objective comparison was showing similar trends, but would require further tuning and development to reach good correlation...|$|R

As an energy <b>interface</b> <b>between</b> a <b>vehicle</b> and the grid, the bidirectional converter {{plays a crucial role}} in their interaction. Its reliability, safety, cost, efficiency, weight, size, harmonics, and other factors are of essential importance for V 2 G realization, especially for on-board operations.

40|$|Since 2005, NASA's Constellation Program {{has been}} designing, building, and testing the next {{generation}} of launch and space vehicles to carry humans beyond low-Earth orbit (LEO). On October 28, 2009, the Ares Projects successfully launched the first suborbital development flight test of the Ares I crew launch vehicle, Ares I-X, from Kennedy Space Center (KSC). Although the final Constellation Program architecture is under review, data and lessons obtained from Ares I-X can be applied to any launch vehicle. This presentation will discuss the mission background and future impacts of the flight. Ares I is designed to carry up to four astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS). It also can be used with the Ares V cargo launch vehicle for a variety of missions beyond LEO. The Ares I-X development flight test was conceived in 2006 to acquire early engineering, operations, and environment data during liftoff, ascent, and first stage recovery. Engineers are using the test flight data to improve the Ares I design before its critical design review the final review before manufacturing of the flight vehicle begins. The Ares I-X flight test vehicle incorporated a mix of flight and mockup hardware, reflecting a similar length and mass to the operational vehicle. It was powered by a four-segment SRB from the Space Shuttle inventory, and was modified to include a fifth, spacer segment that made the booster approximately {{the same size as the}} five-segment SRB. The Ares I-X flight closely approximated flight conditions the Ares I will experience through Mach 4. 5, performing a first stage separation at an altitude of 125, 000 feet and reaching a maximum dynamic pressure ("Max Q") of approximately 850 pounds per square foot. The Ares I-X Mission Management Office (MMO) was organized functionally to address all the major test elements, including: first stage, avionics, and roll control (Marshall Space Flight Center); upper stage simulator (Glenn Research Center); crew module/launch abort system simulator (Langley Research Center); and ground systems and operations (KSC). <b>Interfaces</b> <b>between</b> <b>vehicle</b> elements and vehicle-ground elements, as well as environment analyses were performed by a systems engineering and integration team at Langley.

40|$|Executive Summary: Airport {{terminals}} curbsides are {{the critical}} <b>interfaces</b> <b>between</b> stand- ing <b>vehicles,</b> moving vehicles and pedestrians, {{acting as the}} capacity buffer between the road delivery system and the airport terminal building. Their design and capacity {{are essential to the}} successful performance of any airport infrastructure and, therefore, impact the quality of passenger experience. The current solution at Portela Airport for taxi service provision on the passengers arrival curbside consists on a set of two parallel lanes next {{to the door of the}} airport terminal, with four spots (two in each lane) for taxis to stop and pick up passengers. Its design turns the service of taxis in the same lane strongly linked, leading to the occurrence of blocking effects among taxis, which also reduces the utility of expanding the number of stop areas. A new solution for taxi service provision was recently proposed by Globalvia. The new service configuration consists of a “spine” parking design for 8 taxis at arrivals, and another one at departures with an identical geometry but for private cars. In both cases, the proposed solution consists of a strip parallel to traffic routes, with parking positions arranged at 45 degrees with respect to the road, aligned parallel to each other. Thus, the vehicles coming from the adjacent track, either being taxis (at airport arrivals) or private vehicles (at airport departures), after stopping, follow a route that is dedicated exclusively to them, creating a traffic flow independent of others, thus minimizing the points of conflict <b>between</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The aim of this work is to study and analyze the viability of the new proposal, comparing its capacity and performance with the solution currently implemented at Portela Airport...|$|R
40|$|The {{utility of}} a {{radiation}} exposure analysis depends {{not only on}} the accuracy of the underlying particle transport code, but also on the accuracy of the geometric representations of both the vehicle used as radiation shielding mass and the phantom representation of the human form. The current NASA/Space Radiation Analysis Group (SRAG) process to determine crew radiation exposure in a vehicle design incorporates both output from an analytic High Z and Energy Particle Transport (HZETRN) code and the properties (i. e., material thicknesses) of a previously processed drawing. This geometry pre-process can be time-consuming, and the results are less accurate than those determined using a Monte Carlo-based particle transport code. The current work aims to improve this process. Although several Monte Carlo programs (FLUKA, Geant 4) are readily available, most use an internal geometry engine. The lack of an interface with the standard CAD formats used by the vehicle designers limits the ability of the user to communicate complex geometries.

The three blended-fuel vehicles were originally equipped with either factory CNG engines or factory gasoline engines that were converted to run CNG fuel. The vehicles were variously modified to operate on blended fuel and were tested using 15 to 50 % blends of hydrogen (by volume). The pure-hydrogen-fueled vehicle was converted from gasoline fuel to operate on 100 % hydrogen.
