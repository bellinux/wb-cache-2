For if the algorithm requires N steps, then b is <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>or</b> <b>equal</b> <b>to</b> F'N+1 which in turn is <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>or</b> <b>equal</b> <b>to</b> φ'N1, where φ is the golden ratio. Since b≥φ'N1, then N1≤logφ'b. Since log10φ>1/5, (N1)/5< log10φ logφ'b = log10b. Thus, N ≤ 5 log10b. Thus, the Euclidean algorithm always needs less than O(h) divisions, where h is the number of digits in the smaller number b.|$|E

This study was performed to determine the prevalence and predictors of the metabolic syndrome in PCOS women in Ahvaz. Subjects and Methods: In an epidemiologic descriptive study, a total number of 53 women who attended the endocrinology clinic in Ahvaz from 2007 through 2008, and were diagnosed as PCOS, according to the Rotterdam criteria, {{were enrolled in the}} study. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was studied {{on the basis of the}} criteria explained by American National Cholesterol Panel (ATP-III criteria) Result: Fifty three women with the mean age of 24 ± 6. 8 years were studied in this research. Prevalence of metabolic syndrome in women of Ahvaz was estimated to be as 13. 5 %, and the prevalence for individual components comprising the metabolic syndrome were: fasting glucose blood concentrations <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>or</b> <b>equals</b> to 110 mg/dl in 4 patient (7. 7 %), hypertension in 4 patients (7. 7 %), waist circumference <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>or</b> <b>equals</b> to 88 cm in 14 patients (34. 1 %), HDL less than 40 mg/dl in 12 patients (24 %), triglyceride <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>or</b> <b>equals</b> to 150 mg/dl in 5 patients (9. 4 %), IFG in 17 patients (32. 7 %), diabetes in 3 patients (5. 8 %) and dislipidemia in 31 patients (60 %).
