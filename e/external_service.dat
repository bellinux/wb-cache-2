In 1961, the GBC formed an <b>external</b> <b>service</b> broadcasting in English, French, Arabic, Swahili, Portuguese, and Hausa. Using four 100-kilowatt transmitters and two 250-kilowatt transmitters, the GBC <b>External</b> <b>Service</b> broadcast 110 hours of Pan-Africanist programming to Africa and Europe each week.|$|E

Sometimes they are directed to an internal service or a more suitable <b>external</b> <b>service.</b> Each police zone maintains a permanent point of contact.

These <b>external</b> <b>services</b> provides the user with a different medium then the game itself, and they therefore work as a complement to the game. This study examines if the use of <b>external</b> <b>services</b> for games is related to lack of information/functions in the game. The study focuses on the case of the recent mobile game Pokémon GO and the external environment surrounding the game. As an example the study focused on the game Pokémon GO and did a case study about this game to try the thesis. ...|$|R
25|$|Radio {{broadcasting}} was, {{until recently}} a government monopoly under the Directorate General of All India Radio—established in 1936 and since 1957 {{also known as}} Akashvani—a government-owned, semicommercial operation of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. From only six stations {{at the time of}} independence, All India Radio's network had expanded by the mid-1990s to 146 AM stations plus a National Channel, the Integrated North-East Service (aimed at tribal groups in northeast India), and the <b>External</b> <b>Service.</b> There are five regional headquarters for All India Radio: the North Zone in New Delhi; the North-East Zone in Guwahati, Assam; the East Zone in Calcutta; the West Zone in Bombay; and the South Zone in Madras. All India Radio covers 99.37% of India's populace.|$|E
2500|$|A border blaster is a {{broadcast}} station that, though not licensed as an <b>external</b> <b>service,</b> is, in practice, used to target another country. [...] The term [...] "border blaster" [...] is of North American origin, and {{usually associated with}} Mexican AM stations covering {{large parts of the}} United States and United States border AM stations covering large parts of Canada. [...] Conceptually similar European broadcasting included some pre–World War II broadcasting towards the United Kingdom, [...] "radio périphérique" [...] around France and the US government funded propaganda station Radio Free Europe targeting eastern Europe.|$|E

The concession for two national DAB multiplexes {{are held by}} Norkring, while the regional blocks are owned by NRK, but the infrastructure is {{owned and operated by}} Norkring. The FM network is created through 1,700 transmitters, which give a 99.5-percent coverage for P1 and significantly less for all other stations. The FM network includes support for Radio Data System. The only AM transmitter still in use is at Ingøy, which broadcasts NRK P1 to the fishing fleet in the Barents Sea. Kvitsøy remains the only shortwave transmitter, broadcasting Polish Radio <b>External</b> <b>Service</b> and Radio Romania International. As of 2010, NRK broadcasts P1, P2, P3, mP3, Alltid Nyheter, Alltid Klassisk and Sápmi on both DAB and FM. Super, Gull, Jazz, Klassisk, Folkemusikk, [...] is broadcast only on DAB. The commercial national stations P4 and Radio Norge and the local stations P5, Radio Norge, NRJ, The Voice are broadcast on both DAB and FM.|$|E
40|$|A workflow-based {{web service}} may use ultra-late binding to invoke <b>external</b> web <b>services</b> to {{concretize}} its implementation at run time. Nonetheless, such <b>external</b> <b>services</b> or {{the availability of}} recently used <b>external</b> <b>services</b> may evolve without prior notification, dynamically triggering the workflow-based service to bind to new replacement <b>external</b> <b>services</b> to continue the current execution. Any integration mismatch may cause a failure. In this paper, we propose Preemptive Regression Testing (PRT), a novel testing approach that addresses this adaptive issue. Whenever such a late-change on the service under regression test is detected, PRT preempts the currently executed regression test suite, searches for additional test cases as fixes, runs these fixes, and then resumes {{the execution of the}} regression test suite from the preemption point. © 2012 IEEE |postprin...|$|R

40|$|Service-oriented systems rely on {{software}} applications that offer services through the orchestration of activities performed by <b>external</b> <b>services</b> procured {{on the fly}} when they are needed. This paper presents an overview of a graph-based framework developed around the notions of service and activity module for supporting the design of service-oriented systems {{in a way that}} is independent of execution languages and deployment platforms. The framework supports both behaviour and quality-of-service constraints for the discovery, ranking and selection of <b>external</b> <b>services.</b> Service instantiation and binding are captured as algebraic operations on configuration graphs. © 2012 Springer-Verlag...|$|R
