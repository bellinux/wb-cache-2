40|$|Abstract. This paper {{shows an}} {{extensive}} software performance analysis of dedicated hash functions, particularly concentrating on Pentium III, {{which is a}} current dominant processor. The targeted hash functions are MD 5, RIPEMD- 128 - 160, SHA- 1 - 256 - 512 and Whirlpool, which fully cover currently used and <b>future</b> <b>promising</b> hashing algorithms. We try to optimize hashing speed not only by carefully arranging pipeline scheduling but also by processing two or even three message blocks in parallel using MMX registers for 32 -bit oriented hash functions. Moreover we thoroughly utilize 64 -bit MMX instructions for maximizing performance of 64 -bit oriented hash functions, SHA- 512 and Whirlpool.

40|$|Diabetic macular edema (DME) is {{the main}} cause of visual {{impairment}} in diabetic patients. The management of DME is complex and often various treatment approaches are needed. At the present time, despite the enthusiasm for evaluating several new treatments for DME, including the intravitreal pharmacologic therapies (e. g., corticosteroids and anti-VEGF drugs), laser photocoagulation still remains the current standard in DME. The purpose of this review is to update our knowledge on laser photocoagulation for DME and describe the developments in laser systems. And we will also discuss the new laser techniques and review the latest results including benefits of combined therapy. In this paper, we briefly summarize the major laser therapeutics for the treatment of diabetic macular edema and allude to some <b>future</b> <b>promising</b> laser therapies...|$|R
