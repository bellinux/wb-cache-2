5|$|The Confederate army {{made several}} other {{attempts}} {{to cross the}} trench during the night but repeatedly failed. Although the confederates could have deployed their infantry over the whole length of the trench, they were unwilling to engage the Muslims at close quarter as the former regarded the latter as superior in hand-to-hand fighting. As the Muslim army was well dug <b>in</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> embankment made from the earth which {{had been taken from}} the ditch and prepared to bombard attackers with stones and arrows, any attack could cause great casualties.|$|E
5|$|The North Koreans were {{apparently}} {{unaware of the}} 1st Battalion withdrawal, because the next morning, July 25, two North Korean battalions in a double envelopment came <b>in</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> positions 1st Battalion held the night before, but in front of Major Gordon E. Murch's 2nd Battalion. There the North Koreans {{were caught in the}} open by the combined fire of American tanks, artillery, and mortar, and the 2nd Battalion's automatic and small arms fire. The North Koreans suffered large numbers of casualties in this attack. Surviving remnants of the two North Koreans battalions withdrew in confusion. The 2nd Battalion took about 30 prisoners.|$|E

5|$|As at Pulo Aura, the Indiamen formed line in {{preparation}} for Linois's attack, and once again Linois refused to engage them directly: Blenheim was a powerful ship capable of inflicting fatal damage on Marengo even if the French managed to defeat her, an uncertain outcome given {{the presence of the}} heavily armed merchant ships. Instead, Linois swung <b>in</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> convoy, hoping to cut off a straggler. These manoeuveres were too complex for the poorly manned Brunswick, and she fell out of the French formation and was soon left behind, disappearing over the horizon. At 17:30, Marengo pulled within range of the rearmost East Indiaman and opened a long-range fire, joined by Belle Poule. The rear ship Cumberland, a veteran of the Battle of Pulo Aura, was unintimidated and returned fire as Blenheim held position so that the convoy passed ahead and the French ships rapidly came up with her. Opening a heavy fire with the main deck guns, Troubridge was able to drive the French ships off, even though his lower deck guns were out of service due to the heavy seas that threatened to flood through the lower gunports. Linois, concerned for the safety of his masts, pressed on all sail and by 18:00 had gone beyond range of Blenheims guns and overtaken the convoy, remaining within sight until nightfall.|$|E

25|$|The game ended 1â€“0, with Brooking stooping to {{head home}} a goal {{he would have}} {{probably}} more easily scored with his feet, as the second division side more than held its own.

25|$|Real Madrid {{use this}} style of play {{extremely}} well because they have very quick players in the likes of Ronaldo, Bale and Benzema of whom can speed <b>in</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> defence and take them on when on the break at a quick pace.

Marcelo and Carvajal are also very quick full backs and so can get forward on the break too and put crosses in the box during attack, while being able to track back quick enough.|$|E

25|$|As the Battle of Kursk {{began on}} July 5, 6th Guards Army was in Voronezh Front, {{defending}} {{the south side}} of the salient, and 90th Guards was in the second echelon of its Army, dug <b>in</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> swampy basin of the Pena River to defend the most likely German axis of attack towards Oboyan. After the first day's fighting, during which XXXXVIII Panzer Corps and part of II SS Panzer Corps had damaged and forced back the Army's first echelon, Gen. N.F. Vatutin, the Front commander, ordered the 1st Tank Army to support the second echelon. Overnight, 6th Tank Corps buttressed the left and center of the division, while 3rd Mechanized Corps also moved up in support. These reinforcements were important, because the 90th Guards had started the battle understrength, having yielded a rifle battalion and part of its artillery to the first echelon.|$|E
25|$|While the Japanese {{began moving}} into {{position}} north of Mission Ridge {{in preparation for}} the main attack, Allied aircraft carried out an air raid at Kagi on 6/7 September, killing two and wounding another two. The following day, a force eight US B-26 Marauders, escorted by four P-40 Kittyhawks, carried out a larger airstrike in support of the Australian ground troops on the track, killing 11 Japanese and wounding another 20. The assault began with a heavy artillery barrage on the 2/27th's positions on 7 September. Under this, the III Battalion, 144th Infantry Regiment, attacked straight up the track and although the assault was held by the defenders from the 2/27th, the Japanese succeeded in partially enveloping the forward Australian battalion. As the Australians were distracted, under the cover of darkness the II Battalion, 144th Infantry Regiment carried out a flanking move to the west towards the Fagume River {{with the help of a}} Papuan guide who helped them rejoin the main track once they had skirted the blocking positions established by the Australians, coming <b>in</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> rear Australian battalion, the 2/16th, effectively cutting off the infantry battalions from their headquarters element. At this time, the Japanese artillery firing from the north switched targets to the 2/16th's positions.|$|E
