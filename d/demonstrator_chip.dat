Each station comprises a pixel detector of 16 cm 2 active area made of an assembly of 10 readout ASICs bump bonded to a 200 μm thick pixel silicon sensor, comprising 18000 pixels of 300 μm× 300 μm.

To date, it is the first silicon tracking system with this time resolution.

Moreover, the radiation level is severe, 2 × 10141 MeVneq. cm- 2 per year of operation. Easy replacement of the GTK stations is foreseen as a design requirement. The amount of material of a single station should also be less than 0. 5 % X 0 to minimize the background, which imposes strong constraints on the mechanics and the cooling system.

Prototype sensors in the ams H 18 180 nm and H 35 350 nm HV-CMOS processes have been manufactured, acting as a potential drop-in replacement for the current ATLAS Pixel sensors, thus leaving higher level processing such as trigger handling to dedicated read-out chips.

40|$|The {{world of}} {{wireless}} communications is under constant change. Radio standards evolve and new standards emerge. More and more functionality {{is put into}} wireless terminals. E. g. mobile phones need to handle both second and third generation mobile telephony as well as Bluetooth, and will soon also support wireless LAN functionality, reception of digital audio and video broadcasting, etc. These developments have lead to an increased interest in software defined radio (SDR), i. e. radio devices that can be reconfigured via software. SDR would provide benefits such as low cost for multi-mode devices, reuse of the same hardware in different products, and increased product life time via software updates. One essential part of any software defined radio is a programmable baseband processor that is flexible enough to handle different types of modulation, different channel coding schemes, and different trade-offs between data rate and mobility. So far, programmable baseband solutions have mostly been used in high end systems such as mobile telephony base stations since the cost and power consumption have been considered too high for handheld terminals. In this work a new low power and low silicon area programmable baseband processor architecture aimed for multi-mode terminals is presented. The architecture {{is based on a}} customized DSP core and a number of hardware accelerators connected via a configurable network. The architecture offers a good tradeoff between flexibility and performance through an optimized instruction set, efficient hardware acceleration of carefully selected functions, low memory cost, and low control overhead. One main contribution of this work is a study of important issues in programmable baseband processing such as software-hardware partitioning, instruction level acceleration, low power design, and memory issues. Further contributions are a unique optimized instruction set architecture, a unique architecture for efficient integration of hardware accelerators in the processor, and mapping of complete baseband applications to the presented architecture.

40|$|Efficient {{programmable}} baseband processors {{are important}} to enable true multi-standard radio platforms as convergence of mobile communication devices and systems requires multi-standard processing devices. The processors do not only need the capability to handle differences in a single standard, often {{there is a great}} need to cover several completely different modulation methods such as OFDM and CDMA with the same processing device. Programmability {{can also be used to}} quickly adapt to new and updated standards within the ever changing wireless communication industry since a pure ASIC solution will not be flexible enough. ASIC solutions for multi-standard baseband processing are also less area efficient than their programmable counterparts since processing resources cannot be efficiently shared between different operations. However, as baseband processing is computationally demanding, traditional DSP architectures cannot be used due to their limited computing capacity. Instead VLIW- and SIMD-based processors are used to provide sufficient computing capacity for baseband applications. The drawback of VLIW-based DSPs is their low power efficiency due to the wide instructions that need to be fetched every clock cycle and their control-path overhead. On the other hand, pure SIMD-based DSPs lack the possibility to perform different concurrent operations. Since memory access power is the dominating part of the power consumption in a processor, other alternatives should be investigated. In this dissertation a new and unique type of processor architecture has been designed that instead of using the traditional architectures has started from the application requirements with efficiency in mind. The architecture is named ``Single Instruction stream Multiple Tasks'', SIMT in short. The SIMT architecture uses the vector nature of most baseband programs to provide a good trade-off between the flexibility of a VLIW processor and the processing efficiency of a SIMD processor. The contributions of this project are the design and research of key architectural components in the SIMT architecture as well as development of design methodologies. Methodologies for accelerator selection are also presented. Furthermore data dependency control and memory management are studied. Architecture and performance characteristics have also been compared between the SIMT and more traditional processor architectures.

This paper describes {{the implementation of a}} new-generation pixel <b>chip</b> <b>demonstrator</b> using a commercial 65 nm CMOS technology and targeting HL-LHC specifications. It was designed as part of the Italian INFN CHIPIX 65 project and in close synergy with the international CERN RD 53 collaboration on 65 nm CMOS. The prototype is composed of a matrix of 64 × 64 pixels with 50 μm × 50 μm cells featuring a compact design, low-noise and low-power performance. The pixel array integrates two different analogue front-end architectures working in parallel, one with asynchronous and one with synchronous hit discriminators. Common characteristics are a compact layout able to fit into half the pixel size, low-noise performance (ENC 99 % efficiency for expected 3 GHz/cm 2 hit rate, 1 MHz trigger rate and 12. 5 μs trigger latency at HL-LHC. Pixels have been organized into regions of 4 × 4 cells and a common synthesized logic shared among all pixels provides a centralized memory for latency buffering, performs the trigger matching and handles the local configuration. The simulated particle inefficiency for this architecture is below 0. 1 % under nominal HL-LHC conditions. All global biases and voltages required by analogue front-ends are generated on-chip using 10 -bit programmable DACs. Bias currents and voltages can be monitored by a 12 -bit ADC. A bandgap voltage reference circuit provides a stable reference voltage for all these blocks. The readout of triggered data is based on replicated FIFOs placed at the chip periphery. Data are finally sent off-chip with 8 b/ 10 b encoding using a high-speed serializer. Triggerless and debug operating modes are also supported. Chip configuration and slow-control are performed through fully-duplex synchronous Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) master/slave transactions. The I/O interface uses custom-designed JEDEC-compliant SLVS transmitters and receivers. All blocks and analogue front-ends have been silicon-proven during a previous prototyping phase and were demonstrated to be radiation tolerant up to 580 Mrad Total Ionizing Dose (TID) or beyond.
