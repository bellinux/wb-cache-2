Liu estimated that the Millennium eruption may released 40 Mt of sulfur dioxide. However, Horn and Schimincke calculated that only 20% of the sulfur in the magma had been degassed, because 80% of all analyses of inclusions and matrix fall below the detection limit of an <b>ion</b> <b>probe.</b> The results of average contents of sulfur in 19 of inclusions are 0.0455%, Horn assumed the contents of sulfur in matrix glass are 0.025% because 250 ppm is detection limit of the <b>ion</b> <b>probe.</b> They concluded that the total sulfur dioxide released from eruption was only 4 ± 1.2 Mt, but Horn suggests that may be excess sulfur accumulated in the vapor phase. Guo calculated the average contents of sulfur in nine glass inclusions and one matrix glass are 0.03% and 0.017%, respectively. The results of Guo are 23.14 Mt of sulfur dioxide released from eruption, and 3.33 Mt of sulfur dioxide input to stratosphere. The sulfur contents in glass inclusions show the reverse correlation with SiO2 concentrations, indicating that sulfur solubility in magma is controlled by magma differentiation process because of the occurrence of the S-rich fluid inclusions.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{unambiguous}} {{consequence of}} the existence of stardust within meteorites came from the laboratory of Edward Anders in Chicago, who found using traditional mass spectrometry that the xenon isotopic abundances contained within an acid-insoluble carbonaceous residue that remained after the meteorite bulk had been dissolved in acids matched almost exactly the predictions for isotopic xenon in red giant stardust. It then seemed certain that stardust grains were contained within Anders' acid-insoluble residue. Finding the actual stardust grains and documenting them was a much harder challenge that required locating the grains and showing that their isotopes matched those within the red-giant star. [...] There followed a decade of intense experimental searching in the attempt to isolate individual grains of those xenon carriers. But what was really needed to discover stardust was a new type of mass spectrometer that could measure the smaller number of atoms in a single grain. Sputtering <b>ion</b> <b>probes</b> were pursued by several laboratories in the attempt to demonstrate such an instrument.

50|$|McCurry used an {{electron}} microprobe {{to analyze the}} volatile in glass inclusion of feldspar. McCurry concluded that Millennium eruption may have released 2000 Mt Cl. Liu used chromatography to analysed the average of volatile of 5 whole-rock samples, and the contents of halogen is 0.08%-0.11%. A more recent and more detailed study by Horn and Schmincke (2000) used an <b>ion</b> <b>probe</b> to analyze the average of volatile in 6 of matrix glass and 19 melt inclusions, and the average of content of Cl in melt inclusions and matrix glass {{were found to be}} 0.4762% and 0.3853%, respectively. Horn and Schmincke concluded that the Millennium eruption may have released 45 ± 10 Mt of Cl. Another author, Guo, who studies petrology and geochemistry, shows the average of contents of Cl in melt inclusions and matrix glass to be 0.45% and 0.33%, respectively. They concluded that Millennium eruption may have released 109.88 Mt of Cl, and 15.82 into the stratosphere. The Cl contents in the melt inclusions {{are similar to those of}} Mayor Island, and higher than those of Tambora (0.211%), Krakatau (0.238%) and Pinatubo (0.88-0.106%). The large difference of results between Guo and Horn is because Guo used higher volume and density of magma.|$|E
50|$|Liu used {{chromatography}} {{to analyze}} the average of volatiles of five pumice and obsidian, finding the fluorine content to be 0.0158-0.0481%. Horn and Schimincke used an <b>ion</b> <b>probe</b> to find an average fluorine content in inclusions of 0.4294%, but fluorine concentrations in matrix glass show a significant bimodal distribution into F-rich (0.3992% F) and F-poor (0.2431% F). In order not to over-estimate syn-eruptive fluorine loss, they considered this bimodal distribution of fluorine for calculating the volatile difference between matrix glass and melt inclusions (4300 ppm F). The volatile loss is approximately 300 ppm F for melt inclusion and F-rich matrix glass (64% proportion of the comenditic magma), whereas it is 1900 ppm F for melt inclusion and F-poor matrix glass (36% proportion of the comenditic magma). Horn concluded that 42 ± 11 Mt of F was released by the eruption. Guo, based on less samples (9 inclusions and 3 matrix glass), calculated that F contents in inclusions and matrix glass are 0.42% and 0.21%, respectively. Guo concluded that 196.8 Mt of fluorine was released from eruption, with 28.34 Mt of F injected into the stratosphere. With magma evolving, halogen contents increase irregularly, parallel to the increase of SiO2 concentrations in glass inclusions The large difference of results between Guo and Horn is because Guo used a higher volume and density of magma, and higher difference contents between matrix glass and inclusions.|$|E

Partitioning data for Ti in anorthite and Al in perovskite are also reported. Where cross-comparisons are possible between electron and <b>ion</b> <b>probe</b> data, agreement is good. Concen-tration variations in anorthite for many elements are beyond {{what can be}} explained by fractional crys-tallization, but show well-defined interelement correlations which could reflect the temperature dependence of the D values or could result from liquid boundary layers. For anorthite our D values for REEs are lower, and they decrease more rapidly with decreasing ionic radius than most in the literature. Most of the older REE D patterns for plagioclase in the literature are too flat because of insufficient purity of mineral separates or because of analytical problems. New <b>ion</b> <b>probe</b> data for minor and trace elements in anorthite from type B CAls permit detailed comparisons with fractional crystallization models based on the measured D values. For most comparisons, models and observations do not agree for amounts of crystallization less than 90 %.

40|$|The Early Eocene Thermal Maximum 2 (ETM 2) at ~ 53. 7 Ma {{is one of}} {{multiple}} hyperthermal events that followed the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM, ~ 56 Ma). The negative carbon excursion and deep ocean carbonate dissolution which occurred during the event imply that a substantial amount (10 3 Gt) of carbon (C) {{was added to the}} ocean-atmosphere system, consequently increasing atmospheric CO 2 (pCO 2 ). This makes the event relevant to the current scenario of anthropogenic CO 2 additions and global change. Resulting changes in ocean stratification and pH, as well as changes in exogenic cycles which supply nutrients to the ocean, may have affected the productivity of marine phytoplankton, especially calcifying phytoplankton. Changes in productivity, in turn, may affect the rate of sequestration of excess CO 2 in the deep ocean and sediments. In order to reconstruct the productivity response by calcareous nannoplankton to ETM 2 in the South Atlantic (Site 1265) and North Pacific (Site 1209), we employ the coccolith Sr/Ca productivity proxy with analysis of well-preserved picked monogeneric populations by <b>ion</b> <b>probe</b> supplemented by analysis of various size fractions of nannofossil sediments by ICP-AES. The former technique of measuring Sr/Ca in selected nannofossil populations using the <b>ion</b> <b>probe</b> circumvents possible contamination with secondary calcite. Avoiding such contamination is important for an accurate interpretation of the nannoplankton productivity record, since diagenetic processes can bias the productivity signal, as we demonstrate for Sr/Ca measurements in the fine (< 20 μm) and other size fractions obtained from bulk sediments from Site 1265. At this site, the paleoproductivity signal as reconstructed from the Sr/Ca appears to be governed by cyclic changes, possibly orbital forcing, resulting in a 20 – 30 % variability in Sr/Ca in dominant genera as obtained by <b>ion</b> <b>probe.</b> The ~ 13 to 21 % increase in Sr/Ca above the cyclic background conditions as measured by <b>ion</b> <b>probe</b> in dominating genera may result from a slightly elevated productivity during ETM 2. This high productivity phase is probably the result of enhanced nutrient supply either from land or from upwelling. The <b>ion</b> <b>probe</b> results show that calcareous nannoplankton productivity was not reduced by environmental conditions accompanying ETM 2 at Site 1265, but imply an overall sustained productivity and potentially a small productivity increase during the extreme climatic conditions of ETM 2 in this portion of the South Atlantic. However, in the open oceanic setting of Site 1209, a significant decrease in dominant genera Sr/Ca is observed, indicating reduced productivity...|$|E
