40|$|Für mehr als 30 Jahre wurden die Arbeitsbeziehungen Schwedens durch das grundlegende Abkommen von Saltsjöbaden aus dem Jahr 1938 geregelt. Das zwischen LO und SAF zentral vereinbarte Abkommen schuf die Grundlage für sozialen Frieden, Kooperation und den Vorrang des Tarifvertrags gegenüber der Gesetzgebung. Mit Beginn der 70 er Jahre wurde dieses Regime bedingt durch wachsende Konfrontation zwischen den Arbeitsmarktparteien und radikale Gesetzesinitiativen zunehmend obsolet. Erst in den 90 er Jahren kam es zu einer Renaissance der Kooperation. Die Basis dafür schuf das 'Industrieabkommen' von 1997. Dieser Aufsatz ist ein systematischer Vergleich der beiden Abkommen in Bezug auf; (1) die Rolle des Staates bei deren Zustandekommen; (2) die Reichweite der Abkommen und ihrer Konsequenzen für die Spitzenverbände LO und SAF; (3) ihren Inhalt; (4) die Folgewirkungen auf andere Arbeitsmarktsegmente; (5) vertrauensvolle Kooperation der Tarifparteien und (6) deren symbolische Bedeutung für die Integration der Gesellschaft. Die Schlussfolgerung dieser Analyse ist, dass die Gemeinsamkeiten der Abkommen gegenüber Unterschieden überwiegen. Insofern ist davon auszugehen, dass das Industrieabkommen ein neues Arbeitsmarktregime in Schweden begründet hat. " (Autorenreferat) "The Saltsjöbaden Agreement of 1938 {{between the}} Swedish Employers' Confederation (SAF) and the Swedish Trade Union Confederation (LO) {{initiated}} a new, epoch {{in the history}} of Swedish industrial relations. It was characterized by labour peace, constructive co-operation, and a strong emphasis on collective bargaining. Around 1970, however, the Saltsjöbaden Regime was superseded by a confrontational regime through a wave of farreaching labour legislation, inspired by a radicalized political climate. Not until the beginning of the 1990 s did a new climate of co-operation emerge on the Swedish labour market. The most important manifestation of this change was the so-called <b>Industrial</b> <b>Agreement</b> of l 997. The aim {{of this article is to}} make a systematic comparison between the two great agreements in terms of (1) the role of the state in the origin of the agreements; (2) The scope of the agreements and their effects LO and SAF; (3) the content of the agreements, (4) effects on other parts of the labour market; (5) institutionalized co-operation and mutual trust; (6) their symbolic relevance for a general spirit of mutual understanding in politics and society.

40|$|In {{twentieth century}} Europe and the USA, {{industrial}} relations, labour, and workers’ rights {{issues have been}} handled through collective bargaining and <b>industrial</b> <b>agreements</b> between firms and unions, {{with varying degrees of}} government intervention from country to country.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} transformation of the industrial relations regime in Sweden during the 1990 s. Four areas are studied; industrial relations of the growing service sector, industrial relations of small enterprises, effects of re-regulation and introduction of competition on industrial relations in telecommunications service and internationalisation of industrial relations in the metal sector, showing that in the 1990 s, the labour market regime of Sweden changed into a new regime, as a result of altered conditions caused by the third industrial revolution. The changes took place within a certain context and were governed by a strong path dependence. The internationalisation or Europeanization of the economy, foremost the upsurge in ingoing foreign direct investments, increased the Swedish industry’s dependence on non-national actors and economy. The employers and the trade unions had strong incentives to come to an agreement (the <b>Industrial</b> <b>Agreement</b> in 1997), to achieve international competitiveness. The increasing dependence on (Western/European) trade and investments caused additional adjustments of industrial relations. The Europeanization of the political decision making process (EU membership) had also an impact, to which was added liberalisation, abandoning monopolies etc, but the effect were not as substantial as that of (economic) internationalisation...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{literature}} shows several {{intellectual capital}} models. Nevertheless, {{there is little}} empirical evidence about the building blocks that form intellectual capital in practice. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to test the widespread categorization of human capital, structural capital, and relational capital with a survey applied to high-technology firms from Spain. Design/methodology/approach – Factor analysis was conducted with a sample of 49 firms (larger than 50 employees). Findings – The results indeed demonstrate the existence of three main components of intellectual capital that, in general, fit the dominant structure proposed by other authors. Research limitations/implications – Before moving into an internationally accepted system for classification and measurement of intellectual capital, future research should seek a geographical and <b>industrial</b> <b>agreement</b> about the main components of this construct. In that direction, our empirical evidence provides only the experience of Spanish high-tech firms; this experience could be different in other countries or industries. Practical implications – In this paper, managers interested in the field can find a useful guidance for structuring an intellectual capital balance sheet, taking the three proposed components as main dimensions, and the items of the survey as a measurement tool for analyzing the intellectual strengths and weaknesses of their firms. Originality/value – Academics can also benefit from this research, taking it as a basis for replication studies about intellectual capital in other countries and/or industries. This article presents one of the first empirical tests of the theoretically accepted components of intellectual capital...|$|E

Second, the shift from routine inspections to a complaints-based inspection strategy has reduced the probability of detection and subsequently encourages employer evasion. Third, the use of prosecution {{as a tool of}} `last resort' has provided little deterrence to employer non-compliance.
