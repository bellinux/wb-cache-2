50|$|Like all Soviet-legacy tanks, the T-72's {{design has}} traded off {{interior}} space {{in return for}} a very small silhouette and efficient use of armour, to the point of replacing the fourth crewman with a mechanical loader. The basic T-72 design has extremely small periscope viewports, even by the constrained standards of battle tanks and the <b>driver's</b> <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> is significantly reduced when his hatch is closed. The steering system is a traditional dual-tiller layout instead of the easier-to-use steering wheel or steering yoke common in modern Western tanks. This set-up requires the near-constant use of both hands, which complicates employment of the seven speed manual transmission.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} improve freeways traffic safety, reduce staff and {{vehicles}} casualties and prevent secondary traffic accidents, the accident site section on freeway is divided into six regions of the warning zone, the upstream transition zone, the buffer zone, the accident zone, the downstream transition zone and the termination zone. Establish the warning zone speed-limit model by considering the relevant factors <b>of</b> <b>driver's</b> <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> and transportation distance of visual cognition and then speed-limit programs are proposed according to the warning area speed-limit model. Speed-limit signs of the warning zone take phased settings based on both of those. The {{results show that the}} proposed warning area speed limit model conforms to the actual need, decision science, and having important practical value for freeway traffic safety...|$|R
50|$|Locomotives {{with high}} {{chimneys}} and low footplates had the additional advantage of keeping smoke and condensing steam above the engine <b>driver's</b> <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision.</b> Grade limitations <b>of</b> railways through hilly terrain required tunnels and overhead bridges imposing a loading gauge limiting {{the height of}} chimneys. Increasing the velocity of steam exhaust tended to both accelerate airflow through the firebox and lift the smoke higher above {{the end of the}} chimney. By the 1830s steam exhaust was directed through a contracted nozzle called a blastpipe to achieve desired velocity through the chimney. Pressure drop through the blastpipe nozzle was subtracted from the boiler pressure available to the steam pistons. Robert Stephenson estimated some locomotives lost half their power through blastpipe back pressure.|$|R
40|$|In city traffic, the driver's visual {{tasks are}} not just limited to observing the road. Visual {{information}} from the driver's immediate vicinity is also important for effective and safe driving. There may be objects of various luminance in the <b>driver's</b> <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision,</b> such as shop windows, conventional billboards and LED billboards. Excessive luminance of surfaces in the road's vicinity, especially at night, may lead to reduced visual performance of drivers. Special hazard comes from LED billboards that, apart from very high luminance levels, also feature large surfaces, high luminance contrast and colour contrast, and whose content (animated or video) is very dynamic.

40|$|The {{increasing}} use {{of personal}} in-car technologies has created more opportunities for driver distraction. Communication and navigational systems exact a high cognitive price for the assistance they provide to the driver. Starting from existing research {{in the areas of}} augmented reality and context-aware systems, this paper proposes a system designed to assist the driver in the primary task while mitigating the effects of secondary systems. The core of the system includes a calculated interruptibility metric, which in conjunction with a driver profile system allows the system to postpone or eliminate secondary tasks when the primary task demands the driver’s full attention. The navigational system’s output is seamlessly integrated into the <b>driver’s</b> <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision,</b> eliminating the need to shift between 2 D and 3 D spatial representations or translate audio information to a spatial context. This paper presents the problem in detail, the proposed solution and excerpts from the software model. ...|$|R
50|$|A large, 8.8-inch {{monitor in}} the center of the {{dashboard}} displays all the information the driver needs, apart from the speedometer and tachometer, which are conventional analog instruments. The monitor is positioned within the <b>driver's</b> <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision,</b> allowing it to be viewed while focusing attention on the road ahead. Controls are operated with a single large, multifunction knob located between the front seats. The control (called the Intuitive Interaction Concept) consists of a combination rotary and push button for selecting functions. Confirmation of the selected mode is displayed on the dash mounted screen. Several hundred functions can be controlled with this device. The concept of operating the Z9, which BMW calls Intuitive Interaction Concept, allows the driver to easily activate functions while driving without the need to constantly examine and manipulate conventional controls. It was an early prototype of the series production iDrive, introduced in 2001 on the BMW 7 Series (E65).|$|R
5000|$|Known within GM as the [...] "Banshee IV", {{this car}} was {{unveiled}} in 1988 [...] the two-door, four-seater Banshee IV had a sleek and sensuous futuristic design. Its fiberglass body was painted bright red, while its triangular hood was matte black. A 230 horsepower fuel-injected, {{single overhead cam}} V8 engine powered the rear wheels. A heads-up display system (HUD) projected information about speed, engine RPM, and fuel level on the windshield in the <b>driver's</b> <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision.</b> The dashboard featured video displays and numerous buttons; the steering wheel alone contained about twenty.

40|$|Modern {{vehicles}} are getting smarter and utilize {{more and more}} the advantages of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). Deployment of upcoming technologies, such as cooperative systems (V 2 X), {{will most likely be}} the key step towards a significant reduction of accidents across the globe. Some of these systems extend <b>driver’s</b> <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision,</b> so the <b>driver</b> can be forewarned against a wide range of threats. Unlike technology, the human processing capacity has remained almost unchanged over centuries. Therefore, it is necessary to bear in mind that drivers have restricted capabilities to process multiple warnings. In this context, an important question arises: How can be V 2 X warnings integrated into the Human Machine Interface (HMI) of vehicles, and what warning policy is needed to ensure high usability, acceptance, efficiency and understanding of such a warning interface from the driver’s point of view. Using a human centered design approach, two concepts of visual driver-vehicle interface for V 2 X warnings were developed and evaluated. One of those interfaces was based on a 1 -stage warning policy and the second one utilized a dynamic 3 -stage warning approach. The research revealed that drivers prefer to have dynamic warnings that correspond with the level of danger to which they are exposed, rather than only one warning displayed in a situation of imminent danger. However, with regards to overall usability score and workload measurements, results showed that the 3 -stage system performed worse in comparison with the 1 -stage system...|$|R
5000|$|Air {{brake systems}} are {{typically}} used on heavy trucks and buses. The system consists of service brakes, parking brakes, a control pedal, and an air storage tank. For the parking brake, there's a disc or drum brake arrangement {{which is designed}} to be held in the 'applied' position by spring pressure. Air pressure must be produced to release these [...] "spring brake" [...] parking brakes. For the service brakes (the ones used while driving for slowing or stopping) to be applied, the brake pedal is pushed, routing the air under pressure (approx [...] or 6.89-8.27 bar) to the brake chamber, causing the brake to be engaged. Most types of truck air brakes are drum brakes, though there is an increasing trend towards the use of disc brakes in this application. The air compressor draws filtered air from the atmosphere and forces it into high-pressure reservoirs at around [...] Most heavy vehicles have a gauge within the driver's view, indicating the availability of air pressure for safe vehicle operation, often including warning tones or lights. A mechanical [...] "wig wag" [...] that automatically drops down into the <b>driver's</b> <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> when the pressure drops below a certain point is also common. Setting of the parking/emergency brake releases the pressurized air in the lines between the compressed air storage tank and the brakes, thus allowing the spring actuated parking brake to engage. A sudden loss of air pressure would result in full spring brake pressure immediately.|$|R

40|$|Patients often {{perceive}} a detachment of the retina as a deterioration of their visus and/or the reduction <b>of</b> their <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision.</b> Whereas the measuring of the visus is an established method {{to assess the}} results in retinal surgery, the assessment <b>of</b> the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> is only <b>of</b> minor importance. The present dissertation introduces a method (the quantitative classification <b>of</b> the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> (QCFV)) {{that allows us to}} exactly quantify the hand-drawn sketches <b>of</b> the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> in the patients’ records. This method was used on a collective of patients who underwent retinal surgery 10 years ago, because it could be expected that the data of these patients’ reports kept in the central archive were as complete as possible. Moreover the results of the quantification <b>of</b> the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> as an objective method to assess the success when operating retinal detachment were compared to the findings of visus-measuring and to the fundoscopic assessment of the reattachment of the retina. First a method was developed with which the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> could be quantified based on the hand-drawn perimetry sketches in the patients’ reports. The examination of quantitative perimetry with defined, differently configured test-fields proved the method to be reliable. So the method is also suitable for the quantification of the perimetric sketches <b>of</b> the visional <b>field.</b> An exemplary collective of patients was used to prove that the all-over development of visus and the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> following an operation of retinal detachment showed similar tendencies (the visus remained unaltered or improved in 67 % of all cases, the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> expanded in 53 %). Although the development of visus and <b>of</b> the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> did not differ when the whole collective was looked at, the development of the visus of individual patients was contrary to that <b>of</b> their <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> in more that 25 % of all cases. Therefore the development of visus and that <b>of</b> the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> are criteria to be looked at independently with each single patient in order to assess the success of an operation. The results show that the total improvement – or in only a few cases the damage – the patient experiences because of an operation of retinal detachment is not sufficiently described by stating the visus or the fundoscopic results showing the reattachment of the retina. For the patient the discernible changes in his <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> are a criterion to judge the operational success. So the quantification <b>of</b> the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> probably makes an important contribution here. In future the evaluation of different parts <b>of</b> the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> should be taken into account...|$|R
