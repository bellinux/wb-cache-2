40|$|Abstract: Visually {{impaired}} {{people have}} difficulty accessing information about public transportation systems. Several {{systems have been}} developed for assisting visually impaired and blind people to use the city bus. Most systems provide only one-way communication and require high-cost and complex equipment. The {{purpose of this study is}} to reduce the difficulties faced by visually impaired people when taking city buses, using an <b>interactive</b> wireless <b>communication</b> system. The system comprised a user module and a bus module to establish a direct one-to-one connection. When the user inputs 4 -digit numbers, the user module immediately sends out the information. If the bus module receives the matched bus number, it buzzes and the warning LED flashes to notify the bus driver that someone is waiting to board on the bus. User tests were conducted by two visually impaired people in a simulated vehicle and a city bus. The success rate of <b>interactive</b> wireless <b>communication,</b> recognizing the arrival of the bus and boarding the correct bus reached 100 % in all of the tests. The <b>interactive</b> wireless <b>communication</b> aid system is a valid and low-cost device fo...|$|R

As more people participated in <b>interactive</b> <b>communication</b> and the many challenges it raised in regard to such communication rights as free of speech, privacy, and freedom of information, they began to develop a growing consciousness of the importance of such rights to their ability to communicate.|$|E

40|$|P 2 P-streaming {{has become}} of high {{interest}} in the last years, since it reduces the load on expensive servers, due to the participation of receivers in the media transmission. In this paper, P 2 P content delivery is {{shown to be a}} promising technique for video group communication, for which the main requirement is low-delay. Combining low-delay encoding and low-delay P 2 P Application Layer Multicast makes it possible to fulfill the delay constraints for <b>interactive</b> group <b>communication</b> applications. For such an application, congestion is a considerable problem, since it causes packet loss or late arrival of the packets, degrading the quality of the service. The results presented in this paper show how rate adaptation in combination with the Scalable Video Coding (SVC) helps to overcome problems in the network, providing a better solution than when non-adaptive single layer coding is transmitted.
