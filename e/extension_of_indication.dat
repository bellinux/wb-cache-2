40|$|Background: Scientific {{and medical}} {{progress}} in oncology {{has led to}} the introduction of new medicines in rapid succession. In addition, the development of new therapy modalities, the so-called "targeted therapies” such as e. g. monoclonal antibodies or tyrosinekinase-inhibitors ("small molecules"), has resulted in swift increases in medicine costs in oncology in hospitals. The fast and, to some extent, uncontrolled implementation of these expensive cancer medicines has affected hospital drug budgets. The development of a Horizon Scanning System (HSS) which aims at identifying and evaluating new drug therapies in oncology early on, i. e. before their routine introduction for cancer treatment, could prepare Austrian hospitals (hospital administrators and drug commissions respectively) for new anticancer medicines, and could contribute to making rational decisions and planning prospective budgets. The main components of such a Horizon Scanning System are the determination of relevant information sources for the systematic identification of emerging anticancer drugs, the establishment of a useful filtering and prioritisation instrument, the set up of a network of Austrian oncologists involved in the Horizon Scanning process and the definition of the parameters and the format of early assessment. Objectives: This project was performed in order to develop a concept for the preparation of a HSS for anticancer drugs in Austria and to test the two important steps of identification and priority setting within a first feasibility study. Methods: A literature and internet search based on the EUnetHTA WP 7 HSS-review (overview of Horizon Scanning activities) was performed to identify existing Horizon Scanning Systems and relevant information sources for new anticancer drugs. Experts from established HSSs, mainly members of EuroScan, were contacted for information about their identification and prioritisation processes. Existing methods were then adapted to the needs of Horizon Scanning in oncology. Clinical experts were involved in the priority-setting process and the selection of new anticancer drugs for performing an early assessment. In a pilot run, we tested the feasibility of the concept. Results: In a time period of three months about sixty selected information sources for oncology were scanned weekly to identify emerging anticancer drugs or drugs with an <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>indication</b> in phase II/ III of clinical testing. Our scanning revealed 116 different anticancer drugs for which we extracted relevant data. Three clinical experts in oncology then independently applied seven prioritisation criteria with an underlying score to the potentially important anticancer drugs. We analysed their preliminary estimations by calculating a mean score. The number of anticancer drugs relevant to the Austrian health care system could thereby be reduced to five, although this result has to be interpreted carefully. Prioritisations by the experts clearly differed. Therefore, a final decision about which anticancer drugs should undergo early assessment was not feasible after calculating a mean score. Instead, a multistage prioritisation process must be used to reach a consensus between oncologists. In addition, our experts have commented on the proposed procedures of drug identification and prioritisation. Their suggestions mainly dealt with how drugs are identified (i. e. more restricted inclusion criteria) and who makes up the expert panel (more experts with expertise in specific tumour entities). Their input could now be used to optimize the Horizon Scanning System and serve as a basis for further discussions. Conclusions: The establishment of a Horizon Scanning System for anticancer drugs is an important tool to prepare Austrian hospitals for new/ emerging medicines. In principle our first experiences with the Horizon Scanning System from the feasibility study were acceptable but several changes, especially regarding the collection of data on anticancer drugs and the priority setting process, were proposed by our experts. The next steps will be to work out an optimized, final concept with various stakeholders (e. g. hospital administrators, clinical experts, drug commissions) in consideration {{of the results of the}} feasibility study. Secondly, the Horizon Scanning System should be made standard practice to regularly provide Austrian hospitals (hospital management and drug commissions) with information about new/ emerging anticancer drugs to support their financial drug budget planning and rational decision making. Third, as an input for the international HTA-community, the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for HTA will join EuroScan in 2008 / 2009...|$|E

40|$|Abstract During {{the last}} years, implant {{dentistry}} has seen an dramatic increase {{as a treatment}} option in oral rehabilitation. This is based {{to a large extent}} on scientific advances and clinical improvements in implantology. The <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>indications</b> has broadened the opprtunities to rehabilitate patients that were formerly considered to posess restricted indications to place implants. Additionally, patient desires (high aesthetic demands, fast prosthetic rehabilitation) were placed more in focus, resulting in new approaches in implant dentistry. As a result, the scientific and clinical community has reached high standards {{and at the same time}} has founded the basis for new opportunities in implantology. The advances are mirrored by a high number of high quality scientific papers, published in conventional and open-access journals. A major shift has thereby been observed in the understanding of implant healing, leading the basis for new implant systems that allow fast rehabilitation protocols.

40|$|Macrolides are a {{group of}} {{antibiotics}} with a distinctive macrocyclic lactone ring combined with sugars (cladinose, desosamine).

Materials and methods: We performed a single center retrospective data analysis of 471 breast cancer patients treated during 2004 – 2010. Data on clinical and pathologic staging, frozen section results, radiological measurements and pathologic examination results were obtained from patient records. Patients were analyzed in two groups. Group A (n = 143) had SNB performed only when the patients fulfilled to the following criteria: breast tumor no greater than 3 cm in diameter, unifocal disease, no pure ductal carcinoma in situ, no history of previous breast or lymph node surgery, and no neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Indications for SNB were extended in Group B (n = 328) so that inflammatory breast cancer and positive lymph nodes became the only exclusion criteria. Results: The rate of SN identification was 97. 9 % in Group A vs. 99. 09 % in Group B (P = 0. 29).

40|$|SummaryThe {{development}} of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) by our {{group has been}} a 20 -year odyssey. In 1993, postmortem studies validated the concept of intravalvular stenting in calcific aortic stenosis. The first prototypes of balloon-expandable valves were tested in an animal model in 2000. The first-in-man implantation was performed in Rouen in 2002, rapidly followed by two prospective series in compassionate cases in our centre. TAVI took flight in 2004 {{in the hands of}} Edwards Lifesciences, with major improvements in devices and approaches. At the same time, the self-expanding CoreValve was launched. Thousands of high-surgical-risk patients were enrolled in feasibility studies, leading to the Conformité Européenne (CE) mark being granted in 2007 for the two devices. A number of postmarketing registries have shown dramatic improvements in procedural and midterm results and decreased complication rates, with more experience and improved technology. The results of the randomized PARTNER study in the USA recently confirmed the important place of TAVI in non-operable and high-surgical-risk patients. To date, more than 50, 000 patients have benefited from TAVI worldwide (2300 patients in 33 centres in France in 2011) and the number is consistently increasing. An optimal multidisciplinary collaboration and formally trained experienced physicians are the keys to success. An <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>indications</b> to lower-risk patients might be expected in the coming years but should be cautiously investigated.

MATERIALS AND METHODS:We retrospectively evaluated Argus implantation results in 17 patients, including 15 post prostatectomy incontinence, one exstrophy-epispadias, and one neurogenic bladder patient. Of 17 patients, 12 had severe (more than 5 pads daily) and 5 had moderate SUI (2 to 5 pads daily). Seven patients had history of previous surgeries. Patients were evaluated pre-operatively with urodynamic study and cystoscopy. RESULTS: After median follow-up of 11. 8 months (range, 3 to 22 months), 9 patients were continent, 7 had mild SUI (1 pad daily), and one had the device removed due to perineal and bladder symptoms. Argus adjustment was done in 10 out of 17 patients; 8 tightening and 2 loosening. In a totally incontinent exstrophy-epispadias patient {{with a history of}} multiple bladder surgeries, continence was achieved after device readjustment. In a patient with neurogenic bladder with a history of cystoplasty, severe SUI changed into a moderate sporadic SUI. In 2 patients, prosthesis infection occurred, which was managed with antibiotics without the need for Argus explantation. CONCLUSION: Argus is a simple and good device to control incontinence in men. It may also be used in exstrophy-epispadias patient who is not a candidate for urinary sphincter implantation. Infection complication may be managed conservatively.

40|$|A {{major problem}} in cancer {{treatment}} is disease recurrence, i. e. {{a situation in which}} the standard procedures turned out to be ineffective and the previously used therapy significantly limits its next use. Vaginal recurrence is found in 2. 4 – 15 % of patients with uterine cancer. For large recurrent tumors radical treatment involves surgical pelvic exenteration. However, indications for this procedure are significantly limited; in addition, it is associated with a high risk of complications and a significantly compromised quality of life. For this reason, brachytherapy and/or another course of radiotherapy are administered, which until recently were used as a further-line treatment option or as palliative care. Over the last few years <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>indications</b> for radiotherapy and brachytherapy has been noted due to the dynamic development of new techniques for planning and conducting treatment. These allow for the irradiation of the target volume which causes radiation-related reactions that are acceptable for the patient while protecting critical organs. The introduction of new therapeutic devices allowed for the use of different treatment techniques, including intensity-modulated radiation therapy, image-guided radiotherapy, RapidArc, tomotherapy, intraoperative radiotherapy and stereotactic body radiotherapy, which contributed to a significant increase in the role of repeat radiotherapy. One needs to remember about the possibilities of systemic treatment, although it is usually palliative in nature. Brachytherapy may be considered for the treatment of recurrent disease if the lesions are located in the region of the vagina or vaginal stump or if infiltration is found in the parametria; in other situations treatment combined with external beam radiotherapy should always be considered. The choice of brachytherapy method depends on the location of the lesion and the extent of infiltration. If the infiltration is up to 5 mm deep, intracavitary brachytherapy is performed. If the infiltration is deeper, the use of interstitial brachytherapy is indicated...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: We {{determined}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} TachoSil (R) in sealing the tract after percutaneous nephrolithotomy compared to nephrostomy tube placement. Materials and Methods: A total of 100 consecutive patients scheduled for percutaneous nephrolithotomy were randomized 1 : 1 to receive a 16 Fr nephrostomy tube (group 1) or TachoSil in the tract (group 2). All patients received a mono-J ureteral catheter. The primary study end points were bleeding and urinary leakage rates. The secondary end points were pain as assessed by the 0 to 10 -point visual analog scale, analgesic requirement and hospital stay. Results: The groups were comparable for preoperative and operative variables. In group 1, 3 patients were excluded intraoperatively because of relevant bleeding, and in group 2, 1 patient was excluded intraoperatively because of hydrothorax. Tract complications were significantly more frequent in group 1 than in group 2 (25. 5 % vs 2 %, p < 0. 001). However, the difference in urinary leakage reached statistical significance (19. 1 % vs 2 %, p = 0. 007), whereas that in perirenal hematoma formation did not (6. 4 % vs 0 %, p = 0. 113). There {{was no difference between}} the groups in mean +/- SD number of analgesic doses (1. 17 +/- 1. 56 vs 1. 20 +/- 1. 69, p = 0. 791) and visual analogue scale scores (4. 77 +/- 2. 28 vs 4. 24 +/- 2. 32, p = 0. 270).

40|$|SummaryBackgroundAn ageing {{population}} and the <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>indications</b> will in all probability result in {{an increasing number of}} cardiac device implantations. MethodsPatients implanted in 2008 and 2009 were identified by means of the French National Hospital Discharge database to establish the implantation rate and the National Health Insurance (NHI) Information System database for patient profiles (76 % of the population). ResultsOf the 64, 306  pacemaker implantations (1003. 7 per million inhabitants [pmi]) in 2009, 21. 4 % were single chamber, 75. 4 % double chamber and 3. 2 % triple chamber (CRT-P). Of the 9028 cardioverter-defibrillator implantations (140. 8 pmi) in 2009, 30. 1 % were single chamber, 27. 5 % double chamber and 42. 5 % triple chamber (CRT-D), accounting for 65 % of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) implants. Among NHI beneficiaries, 58. 6 % of cardioverter-defibrillators were implanted for primary prevention. Between 2008 and 2009, CRT-P implantations increased by 8. 8 % and CRT-D implantations by 29. 3 %. Regional variations in implantation rates were observed regarding single-chamber pacemakers (15 – 33 %) and CRT-D among CRT (46. 2 – 73. 8 %). Pacemaker implantations cost € 158. 4 million overall, 4. 5 % of which was for CRT-P; cardioverter-defibrillator implantations cost € 96 million, 49 % of which was for CRT-D. For NHI beneficiaries, 11. 9 % of CRT-P patients and 6. 5 % of CRT-D patients already had a device of the same type implanted in the 3 preceding years. ConclusionThe results confirm the increase in cardioverter-defibrillator implantations in France. The implantation rate remains lower than that in the USA but falls within the European average.

40|$|Background: The {{current status}} of the {{efficacy}} of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD. and cardiac-resynchronization therapy with implantable defibrillator (CRT-D. in patients with left ventricular dysfunction needs to be clarified. Methods and Results: From the Japanese Cardiac Device Treatment Registry database, a total of 1, 584 patients who had an LVEF ≦ 40 % and had an ICD or CRT-D were selected as subjects in this study. The difference in the clinical characteristics between the primary and secondary prevention groups and the transition <b>of</b> the <b>indications</b> for device implantation over time were examined. Primary prevention gradually increased up to about 50 % in all patients. The implantations of ICD/CRT-D for primary prevention in ischemic hear disease was significantly lower than that in dilated cardiomyopathy (33 % vs 51 %; p < 0. 0001). The number of implantations for CRT-D for primary prevention increased dramatically over a one-year period. Conclusions: In Japan, the implantable defibrillator devices for primary prevention was significantly lower in ischemic heart disease compared with dilated cardiomyopathy. Further, an <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> the <b>indications</b> for ICD/CRT-D implantations has recently been occurring, especially with CRT-D devices for primary prevention...|$|R
40|$|Complement {{activation}} plays a {{major role}} in several renal pathophysiological conditions. The three pathways of complement lead to C 3 activation, followed by the formation of the anaphylatoxin C 5 a and the terminal membrane attack complex (MAC) in blood and at complement activating surfaces, lead to a cascade of events responsible for inflammation and for the induction of cell lysis. In case of ongoing uncontrolled complement activation, endothelial cells activation takes place, leading to events in which at the end thrombotic microangiopathy can occur. Atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is a thrombotic microangiopathy characterized by excessive complement activation on the surface of the microcirculation. It is a severe, rare disease which leads to end-stage renal failure (ESRF) and/or to death in more than 50 % of patients without treatment. In the first decade of the second millennium, huge progress in understanding the aetiology of this disease was made, which paved the way to better treatment. First, protocols of plasma therapy for treatment, prevention of relapses and for renal transplantation in those patients were set up. Secondly, in some severe cases, combined kidney and liver transplantation was reported. Finally, at the end of this decade, the era of complement inhibitors, as anti-C 5 monoclonal antibody (anti-C 5 mAb) began. The past five years have seen growing evidence of the favourable effect of anti-C 5 mAb in aHUS which has made this drug the first-line treatment in this disease. The possible complication of meningococcal infection needs appropriate vaccination before its use. Unfortunately, the worldwide use of anti-C 5 mAb is limited by its very high price. In the future, <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>indications</b> for anti-C 5 mAb use, the elaboration of generics and of mAbs directed towards other complement factors of the terminal pathway of the complement system might succeed in reducing the cost of this new valuable therapeutic approach and render it available worldwide for patients from all social classe...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} years the number of hip arthroplasties is {{constantly}} increased, and an incessant growing demand is expected for the next decades. Considering the increased life expectancy for elderly patients and a larger <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> surgical <b>indications</b> in younger adults, {{the need for an}} appropriate implant choice is now emphasized. Long-term survival implants which can satisfy current patients’ high physical demands are required. Thus, in order to avoid high revision rates of cemented implants described for young and active patients, orthopaedic surgeons’ attention has been focusing on materials used for primary (mechanical) and secondary stability (osteo-integration of components) through the concept of “biological fixation”. The process of bonding osteogenesis in prosthesis using biological fixation could enable a stability which resembles permanent physiological union after fractures in healthy cancellous bone. Hydroxyapatite coating on femoral component of uncemented total hip arthroplasty was proposed {{on the basis of its}} biocompatibility and osteoconductive properties. The aim of this work was to analyze clinical and functional long-term outcomes in patients receiving hip replacement with biological fixation...|$|R
40|$|Until a {{few years}} ago, HIV {{infection}} was considered an exclusion criteria for organ transplantation. However, more recently, because of the significant increase in life expectancy of HIV-infected persons with {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} (HAART), kidney, kidney-pancreas, heart, lung and liver transplantation have been introduced in this patients population in several centers around the world. To evaluate the possible <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> the <b>indications</b> <b>of</b> kidney transplantation to HIV-infected individuals, the Italian National Centre for Transplantation has designed a protocol to be applied on a national basis. Inclusion criteria required a CD 4 count ≥ 200 /mm 3 and undetectable HIV viral load for at least 3 months for patients on HAART. The program was voluntarily adopted by 4 transplant centres. From January 2006 through November 2007 a total of 13 HIV infected patients (9 male and 4 female, mean age 46. 4 years, range 35 - 56) underwent cadaveric kidney transplantation (including two kidney-pancreas and two liver-kidney) after a median waiting time of 142 days (range 58 - 650). Median CD 4 cells count at the time of transplantation was 449 (range 210 - 782) and the HIV-RNA was undetectable in all recipients. HAART was started in all recipients after transplantation and HIV-RNA remain undetectable in all patients. Five patients (38. 4...|$|R
40|$|Background: Articular {{cartilage}} injuries have poor repair capacity, {{leading to}} progressive joint damage, and cannot be restored predictably by either conventional treatments or advanced therapies based on implantation of articular chondrocytes. Compared with articular chondrocytes, chondrocytes {{derived from the}} nasal septum have superior and more reproducible capacity to generate hyaline-like cartilage tissues, with the plasticity {{to adapt to a}} joint environment. We aimed to assess whether engineered autologous nasal chondrocyte-based cartilage grafts allow safe and functional restoration of knee cartilage defects. Methods: In a first-in-human trial, ten patients with symptomatic, post-traumatic, full-thickness cartilage lesions (2 – 6 cm 2) on the femoral condyle or trochlea were treated at University Hospital Basel in Switzerland. Chondrocytes isolated from a 6 mm nasal septum biopsy specimen were expanded and cultured onto collagen membranes to engineer cartilage grafts (30  ×  40  ×  2 mm). The engineered tissues were implanted into the femoral defects via mini-arthrotomy and assessed up to 24 months after surgery. Primary outcomes were feasibility and safety of the procedure. Secondary outcomes included self-assessed clinical scores and MRI-based estimation of morphological and compositional quality of the repair tissue. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT 01605201. The study is ongoing, with an approved extension to 25 patients. Findings: For every patient, it was feasible to manufacture cartilaginous grafts with nasal chondrocytes embedded in an extracellular matrix rich in glycosaminoglycan and type II collagen. Engineered tissues were stable through handling with forceps and could be secured in the injured joints. No adverse reactions were recorded and self-assessed clinical scores for pain, knee function, and quality of life were improved significantly from before surgery to 24 months after surgery. Radiological assessments indicated variable degrees of defect filling and development of repair tissue approaching the composition of native cartilage. Interpretation: Hyaline-like cartilage tissues, engineered from autologous nasal chondrocytes, can be used clinically for repair of articular cartilage defects in the knee. Future studies are warranted to assess efficacy in large controlled trials and to investigate an <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>indications</b> to early degenerative states or to other joints...|$|R
