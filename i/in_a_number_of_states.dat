However the Council is composed to represent the EU's states rather than political parties and the nature of coalition governments <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>states</b> means that individual configurations would vary on which domestic party was assigned the portfolio. However the broad ideological alignment of each state does have a bearing {{on the nature of the}} law the Council produces and the extent to which the link between domestic parties puts pressure on the members in the European Parliament to vote a certain way.|$|E

25|$|The party {{also for}} the first time lost power or lost {{majority}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>states</b> across the country. Following the 1967 elections, Indira Gandhi gradually started moving towards socialist policies. In 1969, she fell out with senior Congress party leaders on a number of issues. Chief among them was the decision by Indira to support V. V. Giri, the independent candidate rather than the official Congress party candidate Neelam Sanjiva Reddy for the vacant position of President of India. The other was the announcement by the prime minister of Bank nationalization without consulting the finance minister, Morarji Desai. These steps culminated in Party president S. Nijalingappa expelling her from the party for indiscipline. Gandhi, in turn floated her own faction of the Congress party and managed to retain most of the Congress MPs on her side with only 65 on the side of Congress (O) faction. The Indira faction, called Congress (R), lost its majority in the parliament but remained in power with the support of regional parties such as DMK. The policies of the Congress under Indira Gandhi, prior to the 1971 elections, also included proposals for the abolition of Privy Purse to former rulers of the Princely states and the 1969 nationalization of the fourteen largest banks in India.|$|E

In general, due to the obscure archaeological picture in 12th-11th century BC Greece, there is a continuing controversy among scholars over whether the impoverished societies that succeeded the Mycenaean palatial states were newcomers or populations that already resided in Mycenaean Greece. Recent archaeological findings tend to favor the latter scenario. Additional theories, concerning natural factors, such as climate change, droughts or earthquakes have also been proposed. The period following the end of Mycenaean Greece, c. 1100-800 BC, is generally termed the [...] "Greek Dark Ages".|$|E
500|$|The {{issue of}} local {{historic}} districts {{and the impact}} on property values is a concern to many homeowners. The effects have been extensively studied using multiple methodologies including before-and-after analysis and evaluating comparable neighborhoods with and without local designation status. [...] Recent factual analysis has been conducted by independent researchers <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>states,</b> including New Jersey, Texas, Indiana, Georgia, Colorado, Maryland, North and South Carolina, Kentucky, Virginia, and elsewhere. As stated by economist Donovan Rypkema, [...] "the results of these studies are remarkably consistent: property values in local historic districts appreciate significantly faster than the market as a whole {{in the vast majority}} of cases and appreciate at rates equivalent to the market in the worst case. Simply put â€“ historic districts enhance property values." [...] In a 2011 study Connecticut Local Historic Districts and Property Values, it was found that [...] "property values in every local historic district saw average increases in value ranging from 4% to over 19% per year." [...] Similarly, in New York City between 1980 and 2000, local historic district properties on a price per square foot basis increased in value significantly more than non-designated properties. [...] Equally important, local historic district property values were found to resist market downturns better than historic non-designated properties. [...] A recent study investigating the data on single-family residential mortgage foreclosures and comparable non-designated neighborhoods found that designated properties were significantly less likely to experience foreclosure. Local historic district designation has proven to protect property values from wild fluctuations and provides stability in the housing market.|$|E

[...] Following its release, the band faced allegations of advocating the use of recreational drugs from Bill Gavin's Record Report, a weekly newsletter circulated to U.S. radio stations. [...] This resulted in [...] "Eight Miles High" [...] being banned <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>states</b> {{within a week of}} the report being published, a factor which contributed to the single's failure to break into the Billboard Top 10. The Byrds and their publicist, Derek Taylor, countered by strenuously denying that the song was drug-related, with Taylor issuing an indignant press release unequivocally stating that the song was about the band's trip to England and not drug use. [...] However, by the early 1980s, both Crosby and Clark were prepared to admit that the song was not entirely as innocent as they had originally declared, with the former stating [...] "Of course it was a drug song! We were stoned when we wrote it." [...] Clark was less blunt, explaining in interview that [...] "it was about a lot of things. It was about the airplane trip to England, it was about drugs, it was about all that. A piece of poetry of that nature is not limited to having it have to be just about airplanes or having it have to be just about drugs. It was inclusive because during those days the new experimenting with all the drugs was a very vogue thing to do." ...|$|E

[...] On the other hand, the article also states that [...] "Although plaintiffs have had piecemeal success in bad-faith cases against Allstate, the insurer points to seven court rulings that have rejected attacks on CCPR. Last December a Montana state court noted that while CCPR practices may be illegal 'if misapplied in a particular case, they nevertheless are neutral with no manifestly illegal purpose.'" [...] While many of the cost-reduction strategies McKinsey recommended at Allstate remain in place, some have been reined in following legal and regulatory challenges in several states.|$|E
2500|$|Denmark was {{the first}} country to {{recognize}} a legal relationship for same-sex couples, establishing [...] "registered partnerships" [...] in 1989.

In 2001, the Netherlands became the first country to permit same-sex marriages.

He still had a sizable number of delegates, and a big win {{in his home state of}} California would deprive Clinton of sufficient support to win the Democratic nomination, possibly bringing about a brokered convention. After nearly a month of intense campaigning and multiple debates between the two candidates, Clinton managed to defeat Brown in this final primary by a margin of 48% to 41%. Although Brown did not win the nomination, he was able to boast of one accomplishment: at the following month's Democratic National Convention, he received the votes of 596 delegates on the first ballot, more than any other candidate but Clinton. He spoke at the convention, and to the national viewing audience, yet without endorsing Clinton, through the device of seconding his own nomination. There was animosity between the Brown and Clinton campaigns, and Brown was the first political figure to criticize Bill Clinton over what became the Whitewater controversy.|$|E
