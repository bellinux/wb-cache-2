It is probably the mostcomprehensive analysis of money since the early writings, among others, ofMarx, Engels, Hilferding, Rosa Luxemburg, and Keynes, all of whom came underNabudere’s cutting edge analysis.

40|$|This {{research}} study focuses upon Credit Cards and a proposed verification method {{to reduce the}} risk of fraudulent use. It is anticipated that the proliferation and growing use of credit cards will require the use of security concepts offering built-in point of use protection that is automatic and reliable. A suggested concept is the use of a combined electronic credit card and a memory device. The proposed verification technique combines a user electronic credit card and memory number along with a simple imprinter which would be operated by the person accepting the credit card. Credit cards have become a widely accepted <b>instrument</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> in the United States, and are a prime mover in the trend toward a 2 ̆ 2 cashless society 2 ̆ 2. It is estimated that there are 300 million cards in use today; growing at a rate of about 20 percent per year. Their increased usage and acceptance portends considerable change in credit instruments of many segments of the business world. It is also anticipated that the problem of theft and unauthorized use will increase in proportion equal to or greater than the card growth. Thus, credit card user verification will become a most important factor in the trend toward a cashless society. In anticipation of the credit card user verification problem, the American Bankers Association established a Credit Card Verification Committee in 1967 under the direction of Mr. Norman McClave, Jr., a Senior Vice President of Chicago Northern Trust Company, and Mr. Bernard Ellis of the American Bankers Association. On July 1, 1967 a Verification Criterion was written. It established two levels of identification, the present 2 ̆ 2 honest face 2 ̆ 2 level which would accept the same risks as are now prevailing using a credit card which carries only a name, and a second level which would minimize or eliminate the risks by introducing an additional verification techinque to be used in conjunction with the present 2 ̆ 2 honest face 2 ̆ 2 level.

40|$|Inaugural lecture [...] Faculty of Law, Rand Afrikaans University, 29 August 1974 The {{principles}} of the modern {{law of negotiable instruments}} are the product of an evolution spanning many centuries. Originally the cambial obligation was based on the contract of exchange. an agreement in terms of which the one party undertook to pay {{a certain amount of money}} to the other party and the latter undertook to repay or cause to be repaid the same amount of money at a different time and place and in a different currency. This contract of exchange was executed by means of a bill of exchange, which can functionally be described as an instrument for the transfer of money. The bill of exchange, or its delivery, had no independent obligatory force. The theory of the law of negotiable instruments, at that stage, centred on the contract of exchange and the medieval writers strove to analyse and classify it within the system of the Roman law of contract. From the 17 th century, the bill of exchange evolved into an <b>instrument</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit.</b> It became a perfectly flexible paper currency adapted to the needs of commerce and the cambial obligation was accordingly founded on the bill itself. Predominant was the idea of a litterarum obligatio. The reaction against the old theory, however. went much too far and the law of bills of exchange was no longer explained in terms of the known concepts of the law of obligations. The Kreationstheorie became popular, resting the cambial obligation not on contract but on the unilateral and abstract promise of the drawer to pay. In the bill, according to this theory, the drawer objectifies his intention to be bound to every factual holder of the instrument. This view dominated judicial thought in Europe during the nineteenth century and found its expression in English decisions then current and still inspires authors of the present day. It is, however, based on a misconception. The Kreationstheorie led to the unavoidable consequence that even a thief or finder of a lost document could, in theory, be a creditor. A corrective was thus necessary and in the effort to find this corrective the modern {{principles of}} the law of negotiable instruments were born. Originally, in terms of the different "theories of property" that developed as a reaction to the Kreationstheorie, the mere signature of the drawer or other party is insufficient to found the cambial obligation. To found this obligation it is necessary also for the holder to acquire ownership of the document. These "theories" were not far removed from the ideas underlying the continental rules that sanction the acquisition of property in movables a non domino. Their present importance is, however, not that they offer an explanation for the creation of the cambial obligation, but that they stress the nexus between holding a bill of exchange and exercising the personal right evidenced by it. The bill of exchange is a negotiable instrument, a Wertpapier. A negotiable instrument is a document in which a personal right is incorporated in such a manner that it can be exercised through possession of the document only. Exercise of the personal right presupposes possession. Hence the axiom of the modern law: das Recht aus dem Papier folgt dem Recht am Papier. But acceptance of this axiom still leaves unexplained the source of the cambial obligation. It is one thing to give the holder in due course, who acquired a non domino, a real right, but entirely another thing to hold the drawer, acceptor or indorser of a lost or stolen document contractually liable. The cardinal objection to the Kreationstheorie is that it elevates a mere signature on a bill of exchange to a declaration of an intention to be bound. The drawer of an instrument who locks it away, has no intention to be bound and makes no such declaration. Nothing can be simpler than this. Any proper theory has to proceed from the normal situation. It can accordingly be stated that the source of the cambial obligation is contract, but a contract whose form is dictated by the character of the bill of exchange as a negotiable instrument. It is thus concluded by delivery, which is directed both at the transfer of a real right to the document and the founding of a personal right on it. Despite the rejection of the Kreationstheorie, with its idea of the direct and abstract promise to pay, it is accepted that the cambial obligation is an abstract obligation. Abstract in the sense that it is autonomous and not dependent on the validity of the causal obligation. Vis-a-vis third parties this abstraction entails the unavailability of defences arising from the causal obligation (material abstraction). The same abstraction is found in the figures of the delegation imparfaite, the credit card, the irrevocable credit and to a lesser extent in the contract of suretyship. Between immediate parties, on the other hand, the cambial obligation is only formally abstract. This implies a shifting of proof. The creditor is discharged of the onus other than that relating to the abstract promise to pay. Between immediate parties the rule is the availability of defences. The cambial obligation is, however, not always founded on contract. The liability of the drawer of a lost or stolen instrument to a holder in due course is not based on contract but on the protection of the legitimate confidence, or estoppel. By drawing, accepting or indorsing, the debtor creates the appearance of being contractually bound. He is held responsible for this appearance when he knowingly or negligently signed the bill of exchange. Having created the appearance of contractual liability, he is deemed to be bound contractually. Estoppel, or the protection of the legimate confidence, not only explains the acquisition of the real and personal rights in and arising from the bill of exchange, but also the principle of the unavailability of defences. Negotiation is in principle the same as cession, but with the difference that the holder in due course obtains the personal right as it is incorporated in the document. The debtor has created the appearance of his being bound strictly according to the tenor of the bill and he is held liable accordingly. This is the sense of the medieval words quod non est in cambia non est in mundo...|$|E

40|$|The bill of {{exchange}} {{is a kind of}} paper in order that its holder shall entitle the debtor named in the document to pay a certain amount of payments.

The bill of exchange is generally a paper on the orders but it can be issued as value paper to a name. It is such promissory notes where the issuer becomes a clause not by order. The bill of exchange though it appears as a means of payment and an instrument for securing the payment it also appears as a means of international payment, because the bill of exchange can become a modern <b>instrument</b> <b>of</b> <b>crediting</b> and payment. With the development <b>of</b> the <b>credit</b> market and the bill of exchange becomes a means for the drawer and the drawee. This means that instead of the bill of exchange to be paid after the expiry of a certain deadline for submission of the bill of exchange the holder may sell or discount, or to pay before the deadline for submission. With this the bill of exchange becomes a toll for discount. Based on this we can conclude that the bill of exchange has the following roles: -bill of exchange serves as a means of credit; -bill of exchange serves as means of payment; -bill of exchange serves as a means for discount by. ...|$|R

As many credit unions seek to provide services comparable to conventional banking institutions, they risk eroding their distinctive co-operative ethos.

In a business climate where many consumers question the societal and/or environmental impact <b>of</b> businesses, <b>credit</b> unions enjoy a distinct competitive advantage.

We identify shocks to the money market by using the recursive relationship between slow moving real activity measures and fast moving financial market activity at the weekly frequency. We find after an unexpected increase {{in the cost of}} funds, primary dealers are unable to offset a reduction in bond financing by maturity substitution. Combined with institutional details, our findings support the existence <b>of</b> a broad <b>credit</b> channel for monetary policy to shadow banking activity. As a result, monetary policy contributes to rollover and credit risk by operating through the total supply of repurchase agreements to primary dealers via both prices and quantities. We conclude from 2001 to 2007, credit-market conditions posed a systemic threat to real activity due to dealers inability to access repurchase agreement liquidity needs at the discount window. Our findings are robust to a range <b>of</b> policy <b>instruments</b> including cost <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> measures and System Open Market Account composition.

40|$|Securitisation in Asia and the Pacific: {{implications}} for liquidity and credit risks 1 A surge in structured finance in Asia and the Pacific {{has been driven}} by the securitisation of consumer loans and mortgages, a largely liquidity transforming activity. The securitisation of corporate debt in the region has so far seen relatively few deals but has a largely untapped potential to enhance the allocation <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> risks. JEL classification: G 150, G 180, G 210 and O 160. In recent years, financial markets in Asia and the Pacific have seen significant growth in the securitisation of domestic assets. 2 This growth has been based largely on the repackaging of residential mortgages and consumer finance assets rather than of corporate debt. In the countries hit by the 1997 Asian crisis, the new laws and regulations that allowed securitisation were in some cases spurred by a need to deal with the flood of non-performing loans that flowed from the crisis. While a few transactions based on corporate debt were undertaken for this purpose, the recovery from the crisis was accompanied by a rise of households as the dominant class of borrowers. Hence, the great bulk of securitisation deals in the region have been based on household debt. In general, there are two main advantages to securitisation. First, it can turn ordinarily illiquid assets into reasonably liquid instruments. Second, it can create <b>instruments</b> <b>of</b> high <b>credit</b> quality out <b>of</b> debt <b>of</b> low <b>credit</b> quality. Since securitisation in the Asia-Pacific region has been based largely on residential mortgages and consumer loans, in relative terms it has tended to enhance liquidity rather than reallocate credit risk. In the next section we explain the basic securitisation techniques. Following this, we provide a brief overview of the growth and composition of securitisation in the Asia-Pacific region. In the third section we consider th...|$|R
