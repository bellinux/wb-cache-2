5000|$|In 2006, an MR-73 {{train was}} tested with a 4-beep <b>door</b> <b>chime,</b> and in 2008, another high-pitched chime was tested. However, these chimes were unpopular so in 2010 a three-note {{sequence}} {{which is essentially}} the same as the first three notes of [...] "Fanfare for the Common Man" [...] was tested, albeit with a voiceover by Michèle Deslauriers saying [...] "Attention, nous fermons les portes" [...] (approximate translation: Attention, we're closing the doors) after the three-note sound was played. The voiceover was soon removed however and since 2012, the MR-73s play the three-note sequence whenever the doors are about to close.|$|E

40|$|A {{common problem}} {{behavior}} in animal shelters is excessive noise from barking, which can regularly exceed 100 dBs. Noise levels in animal shelters are correlated with increased stress in dogs, which {{may lead to}} increased problem behavior {{and a decrease in}} adoption. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the use of respondent conditioning procedures to reduce barking noise level in an animal shelter by pairing a <b>door</b> <b>chime</b> with edible items. Following a baseline and neutral stimulus phase, the <b>door</b> <b>chime</b> was paired with edible items over a period of three weeks. Following this pairing phase, the pairing was stopped to determine if the <b>door</b> <b>chime</b> would act as a conditioned stimulus and reduce barking. These procedures were replicated following an additional baseline phase. Overall, the procedure was effective in reducing the noise level of the kennel area as compared to baseline levels. Implications and future research areas are discusse...|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} customer greeting {{by employees}} at one {{location of a}} sandwich restaurant chain. First, a preintervention analysis was conducted to determine {{the conditions under which}} greeting a customer within 3  s of his or her entry into the restaurant did and did not occur. Results suggested that an appropriate customer greeting was most likely to occur when a <b>door</b> <b>chime</b> was used to indicate that a customer had entered the store and when the store manager was present behind the service counter. Next, a performance improvement intervention, which consisted of the combination of the use of a <b>door</b> <b>chime</b> and manager presence, was evaluated. Results showed that during baseline, a mean of 6 % of customers were greeted; during intervention a mean of 63 % of customers were greeted. The addition of manager-delivered verbal and graphic group feedback resulted in 100 % of customers being greeted across two consecutive sessions...|$|E

50|$|Additional yellow plastic straps (placed {{underneath}} the HVAC units) have been installed in all TR trains in late 2015. Meanwhile, {{it was reported}} that all TR trains were scheduled to be retrofitted with external speakers, together with exterior side destination signs, that announce the destination of the train along with the <b>door</b> <b>chimes,</b> by approximately late 2016. However, as of June 2017, not all TR trains have yet been upgraded with these features.|$|R
50|$|In February 2013, the TTC began a trial phase {{with the}} {{installation}} of exterior <b>door</b> <b>chimes</b> (above each set of doorways) on the TR trains. Set 5461-5466 {{was the first to}} be retrofitted, followed by set 5851-5856 in May 2014. The retrofitted trains have a lower pitched three-tone warning chime (F♯, D♯, B) that plays simultaneously with the warning message inside the train via the public address system, while remaining trains continue to use the higher pitched three-tone warning chime (G, E, C) played inside the train, preceding the warning message.|$|R
50|$|Public Prosecutor Kailash Khanna enters Dhaniram's house exactly at 11.00 pm on 30 June.

So he would not be free before 10.30 or perhaps 11.00 pm. Later when he is shown walking towards Dhanirams' house, a clock in the {{background}} can be heard chiming. One can easily count 11 chimes from the moment Kailash is walking towards Dhaniram's house, till Dhaniram opens the <b>door</b> (<b>chiming</b> stops after that). So the action starts at 11.00 pm.|$|R

2500|$|In 1991, as {{a result}} of lawsuits, {{electronic}} chimes, using a descending three-note arpeggio (either G-E-C ], , or between one or two semitones lower (F♯-D♯-B [...] or F-D-B♭ [...] )) and a flashing pair of orange lights above the doorway, added for the hearing impaired, were tested and gradually introduced system-wide during the 1990s. [...] The Toronto Rocket trains use the same <b>door</b> <b>chimes</b> and flashing orange lights as the older trains do, and also plays the additional voice announcement, [...] "Please stand clear of the doors". Those chimes have become synonymous with the TTC and Toronto {{to the point that the}} CBC Radio One local afternoon show, Here and Now, includes them in its theme music.|$|R

50|$|The T1s {{have a life}} {{expectancy}} {{that allows them to}} remain in service until at least 2026, and the TTC started implementing mid-life technological upgrades for the fleet including the installation of new <b>door</b> <b>chimes</b> (similar to those used on the TR trains) and LED destination signs. Additionally, cars #5162/5163 have been retrofitted with CCTV cameras (5 per car) and external announcements. The TTC also considered upgrading the fleet to run on an automatic train control (ATC) system, which will replace the current wayside signaling system on Lines 1 and 4 in 2017 and is expected to follow suit on Line 2 by 2020 {{with the opening of the}} Scarborough subway extension. However, due to prohibitively expensive costs of such a retrofit, it is unlikely that this will happen in the near future, and the TTC plans to replace all T1 trains with new ATC-compatible equipment instead.|$|R

50|$|In 1985, a new {{generation}} of advanced suburban passenger train was being considered by the State Rail Authority. There was a delay in the construction of these trains, and 56 interim stainless steel air conditioned cars, C3581-3608 and T4247-4274, were built by Goninan, known as the 'Chopper Cars' for their chopper control. These cars trialled several features of the next generation cars, such as fixed seating, <b>door</b> <b>chimes</b> and passenger address systems. They were originally fitted with a push-button feature, to enable passengers to open the doors manually, but this feature was short-lived. They retained the flat ends of the previous Goninan cars, but {{with the addition of a}} fibreglass moulded end piece which was originally white with orange and red stripes (the 'candy' State Rail livery). These ends were later painted grey with a lower yellow section which they retain to this day, and internally the standard grey livery and blue seat upholstery was applied. These cars continue to operate as C sets.|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, one 9-car trainset, {{consisting}} of three trains in 3-car formation, had their traction systems {{replaced with a}} prototype for a chopper traction system manufactured by the Canron company using a Jeumont original design. Trains utilizing the current chopper system produce an unusually loud 5-tone chorus as the train begins its initial acceleration out of the station. The frequencies used (90 Hz, 120 Hz, 180 Hz, 240 Hz, and 360 Hz) just so happen to produce a musically appealing sound that was later incorporated, by popular demand, into the 3-tone <b>door</b> closing <b>chimes</b> of the later MR-73 trains. Two of the three 3-car prototype trains were still in service until 2017, when they were retired along other MR-63s being replaced by Azur trains. The last 3-car prototype train was however retired from service earlier {{than the other two}} and has been used as part of the Just for Laughs festival.|$|R
2500|$|In May 2006, it was {{announced}} that all of the LRVs would be rehabilitated by AnsaldoBreda. The rehabilitation featured many improvements, including enhanced video monitoring of the railcar interiors, an upgraded braking system, rebuilt HVAC systems, rebuilt door systems, a new interior closely representing the agency's new look, upgraded propulsion systems and repairs to the body shells. In addition, the rail cars were to receive new monitoring systems, an automated announcement system calling out stations, new <b>door</b> <b>chimes</b> and interior/exterior LED signage to replace existing roll signs. The total project cost was estimated at $40 million for rehabilitation of the 27 cars. Because the refurbished cars have new car-to-car communications equipment, they are not compatible with unrefurbished cars and cannot run with them on the same train. The project originally planned to use SuperSteel's manufacturing facilities in Schenectady, New York for the overhaul. However, due to the loss of orders and a dip in the economy, SuperSteel closed the facility in April 2009. The closure cost 175 jobs and delayed the rehabilitation. [...] The project later was moved to Gray Manufacturing Industries, located in Hornell, New York. [...] The first two cars were due back in revenue service in July 2010. After a lengthy delay, which put the project years behind the original schedule, the first two cars (fleet numbers 114 and 123) were returned to full revenue service on March 9, 2012, 20 months later than planned. However, the cost of refurbishment per car had since gone up and now averaged $1.7 million per car with an cost of $45 million to complete all cars in the fleet. Three more cars (numbers 110, 111 and 126) were sent out and were expected to be completed before the end of 2012, but did not return to full revenue service until the fall of 2013. On October 1, 2014, car 113 also returned to full revenue service. Since then, 11 more cars (numbers 101, 102, 103, 104, 106, 112, 117, 119, 120, 124 and 125) have returned to full revenue service, bringing the total number of refurbished rail cars to 17 as of September 15, 2017.|$|R
500|$|Presenting {{the episode}} without music was Whedon's way of denying the {{audience}} any comfort, {{forcing them to}} discern their own meanings from the characters' actions and words. As two musicologists write about this absence, [...] "Without music's acoustic balm, all our empathetic attention is on the characters and their state of bewilderment ... Music would provide a conceptualization and a catharsis ... but a catharsis at this point would in some measure trivialize the loss." [...] Television critic Gareth McLean writes that this decision is [...] "a move that makes it more courageous than, for instance, ER. There were no soaring strings or plaintive piano to trigger an emotional response. Instead the soundtrack took in the ambient noises of wind <b>chimes,</b> <b>doors</b> squeaking, footsteps on carpets. Conversations were stilted and awkward, but the spaces in between always mattered." ...|$|R
