40|$|Abstract. Balanced gates are an {{effective}} countermeasure against power analysis attacks {{only if they}} can be guaranteed to maintain their power balance. Traditional testing and reliability methods are used primarily only to ensure the correctness of the logical functionality and not the balance of a circuit. Due to the hardware redundancy in balanced gate designs, there are many faults which can imbalance a balanced gate without causing logical errors. As a result, traditional testing and reliability methods and architectures are unable to test and verify if a gate is completely defect and fault-free and hence balanced. Our simulations show that a few faulty balanced gates can make a circuit as vulnerable to power analysis attacks as a completely imbalanced implementation. This vulnerability opens the possibility of new methods of attacks based on a combination of fault and power attacks. A solution to the vulnerability based on a built-in <b>differential</b> self-balance <b>comparator</b> is presented. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} focused on the {{analysis}} and modeling of coplanar waveguide (CPW) transmission lines loaded with multisection stepped impedance resonators (MS-SIRs), transversely etched on the back substrate side. The considered structure consists of a CPW loaded with a 5 -section SIR (5 S-SIR) with wide (capacitive) central and external sections cascaded with narrow (inductive) sections. The general case of a 5 S-SIR with arbitrary lengths and widths of the different sections is considered. The structure is described by a pair of inductively coupled grounded series resonators coupled to the line through the capacitance of the central 5 S-SIR section. If the structure is symmetric, the transmission coefficient exhibits a single transmission zero. Hence, these structures can be used as notch filters exhibiting wide bandwidths, provided the inductance of the 5 S-SIR can be made small, and the capacitance can be enhanced by virtue of the broadside coupling. However, if symmetry is broken, two notches separated a distance that depends on the level of asymmetry and inductive coupling appear. Therefore, these structures are also useful for the implementation of <b>differential</b> sensors and <b>comparators.</b> The proposed model is validated through parameter extraction and experiment, and a proof-of-concept of a comparator is reported...|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of general charge sampling technique {{is presented in}} this thesis. Charge sampling integrates input current instead of tracking input voltage to realize high speed and low voltage sampling. The analysis focuses {{on the performance of}} general charge sampling circuits for signal capture. The theoretical analysis here can be applied not only for the weak signal capture, but also for the normal signal sampling. Based on a general charge sampling model, the transfer function, the noise performance and the clock jitter tolerance are analyzed and compared to conventional voltage sampling. The results provide a theoretical basis for the charge sampling circuit design. The extended work for an accurate sample-and-hold circuit model with a finite sampling duration is also presented. The results provide a better theoretical basis for understanding and designing a sample-and-hold circuit with finite tracking time, especially when considering the RF sampling (or subsampling) and kT/C noise. A CMOS 6 -switch charge sampler is developed based on the charge sampling principle. With dummy capacitors operating alternatively in positive and negative branches, the resetting phase is embedded in the charging phase. The speed of the sampling is improved. A 500 MS/s charge sampling circuit was implemented in a 0. 25 $mu$m CMOS process and measured. The dynamic range reaches 42 dB within the 250 MHz bandwidth. The power consumption is about 5 mW. Based on the principle of charge sampling, a novel charging FIR filters was suggested and implemented. The proposed FIR filter functions by summing the weighted current signal on a passive capacitor. First, the input signal is weighted by a resistor ladder, whose resistance is decided by the impulse response of the FIR filter. A linear transconductor then converts the weighted voltage to current and charges the capacitor linearly. The hardware cost is not proportional to the tap number in the proposed FIR filter. Two 32 -tap filter prototypes were implemented in the AMS 0. 35 $mu$m CMOS process. For the first filter, the measured sideband attenuation reaches - 60 dB. The group delay is lower than 11 ns. The power consumption is about 35 mW under 3. 3 V supply voltage. For the second one, the measured sideband attenuation is about - 40 dB. The group delay is about 50 ns. The power consumption is about 7 mW under 2 V supply voltage. A <b>differential</b> difference <b>comparator</b> (DDC) is proposed for A/D conversion. The proposed DDC provides easy linear voltage subtraction and comparison functions via current operation. Since there are no feedback loops, the speed of the analog signal subtraction is inherently faster when being used in an analog-to-digital converter. Based the DDC, a CMOS ping-pang mode 200 MS/s 8 bit 2 -step subranging A/D converter was implemented in the AMS 0. 35 $mu$m CMOS process. Because of mismatch, the measured DNL for one branch is about 1. 5 LSB and INL is about 2. 2 LSB at 100 MS/s. The measured spurious free dynamic range at 100 MS/s (one branch) is 51 dB with 50 kHz sine input, while 39. 2 dB at 200 MS/s (two branches) with 600 kHz signal input. The power consumption is 170 mW at 200 MS/s. Some other results on the A/D converters, such as an 80 dB sigma-delta modulator and a programmable A/D converter, are also included in the thesis. These works focus on the feasibility and flexibility study of the sigma-delta and pipelined A/D converters...|$|R
