5|$|By early 2016, delays as {{a result}} of {{overcrowding}} were up to more than 20,000 every month, four times the amount in 2012. The overcrowded trains have resulted in an increase of assaults because of tense commuters. With less platform space, more passengers are forced to be {{on the edge of the}} platform resulting in the <b>increased</b> <b>possibility</b> of passengers falling on the track. One possible solution that the MTA is considering is platform screen doors, which exist on the AirTrain JFK to prevent passengers from falling onto the tracks. In order to prevent hitting passengers who could fall onto the tracks, train operators are being instructed to go into stations at lower speeds. The increased proximity of riders could result in the spread of contagious diseases.|$|E
5|$|Although {{interest}} in the P-class ships and the battlecruiser proposal waned {{for a time in}} late 1937 and early 1938, it was quickly revived on 28 April 1938 with Hitler's public airing of his views on the 1935 Anglo-German Treaty and the consequent <b>increased</b> <b>possibility</b> of war with the United Kingdom. Calling the Naval Staff and Admiral Erich Raeder to him, Hitler laid out his thoughts of a strong navy that could pose enough danger to the British such that they would enter into an alliance with Germany rather than go to war. As decided here, Plan Z entailed two task forces each centered on three H-class battleships and one aircraft carrier, with cruisers and destroyers as escorts. In war, these forces would collaborate with the three battlecruisers by occupying convoy screens while U-boats and {{one or more of the}} O class took out the cargo-carrying merchant ships. The presence of the battlecruisers operating at large would have the secondary effect of forcing the Royal Navy to deploy battleships as convoy escorts, thus weakening any fleet that could engage the Plan Z task forces.|$|E

25|$|This {{design is}} {{intended}} to reduce the occlusion effect. Conversely, because of the <b>increased</b> <b>possibility</b> of feedback, and because an open fit allows low frequency sounds to leak out of the ear canal, they are limited to moderately severe high-frequency losses.|$|E
25|$|Two full decks are dealt between eight players, forming four teams. Team {{members are}} spaced {{so that they}} are not able to see any other hands. The game is usually played to a score of 5,000 or higher. Other than this, the four player rules apply, and any {{variations}} may also be used. There is an <b>increased</b> <b>possibility</b> that when one team declares trump another team may have an equal number of trump also, which may lead to an interesting game. An optional scoring rule rewards 1,000 points for a quadruple pinochle—four jacks of diamonds and four queens of spades in a meld.|$|E
25|$|Cognitive load {{also plays}} a role in ironic control theory. Studies have shown that a greater {{cognitive}} load results in an <b>increased</b> <b>possibility</b> of dream rebound occurring. In other words, when one tries to retain a heavy load of information before going to sleep, there is a high chance of that information manifesting itself within the dream. There is a greater degree of dream rebound in those with a higher cognitive load opposed to those whose load was absent. With the enhancement of a high cognitive load, ironic control theory states thought suppression is more likely to occur and lead to dream rebound.|$|E

25|$|Splenectomy (removal of the spleen) may be {{considered}} in patients who are either unresponsive to steroid treatment, have frequent relapses, or cannot be tapered off steroids after a few months. Platelets which have been bound by antibodies are taken up by macrophages in the spleen (which have Fc receptors), and so removal of the spleen reduces platelet destruction. The procedure is potentially risky in ITP cases due to the <b>increased</b> <b>possibility</b> of significant bleeding during surgery. Durable remission following splenectomy is achieved in 60 to 65 percent of ITP cases, less so in older subjects. The use of splenectomy to treat ITP has diminished since the development of steroid therapy and other pharmaceutical remedies.|$|E
25|$|The {{limitations}} {{based on}} consanguinity derive from {{a policy of}} practical eugenics and reflect the <b>increased</b> <b>possibility</b> that such marriages will produce children {{with a genetic defect}} due to the limitations on their combined gene pool. The limitations based on affinity, by contrast, are predominantly legal and social in origin. The rules relating to affinity reflect the need to minimise the prospects of familial jealousies and dysfunction by preventing the intermarriage of people already related by marriage. Difficult questions arise on whether an adopted child may marry his or her adoptive parents, or the natural children of the adoptive parents. No matter what legislative decisions are taken, there will always be citizens who wish to evade the application of the law. There will be no problem if they relocate and establish a matrimonial home in a state that allows their marriage. But any attempt to evade such laws by going through a ceremony in a state that permits the marriage and then returning to the original state (which will usually be their state of domicile, nationality or habitual residence) will fail, and may even expose the couple to the risk of prosecution for incest or an equivalent offense.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{very common}} for twins to be born at a low birth weight. More than half of twins are born {{weighing}} less than , while the average birth weight of a healthy baby should be around [...] This {{is largely due to}} the fact that twins are typically born premature. Premature birth and low birth weights, especially when under , can increase the risk of several health-related issues, such as vision and hearing loss, mental disabilities, and cerebral palsy. There is an <b>increased</b> <b>possibility</b> of potential complications as the birth weight of the baby decreases.|$|E

Steaming to New London in June, she trained submarine crews there until after Germany collapsed.

2500|$|The {{financial}} cost of trauma includes both {{the amount of}} money spent on treatment and the loss of potential economic gain through absence from work. The average {{financial cost}} for the treatment of traumatic injury in the United States is approximately [...] per person, making it costlier than the treatment of cancer and cardiovascular diseases. One reason for the high cost of the treatment for trauma is the <b>increased</b> <b>possibility</b> of complications, which leads to the need for more interventions. Maintaining a trauma center is costly because they are open continuously and maintain a state of readiness to receive patients, even if there are none. In addition to the direct costs of the treatment, there also is a burden on the economy due to lost wages and productivity, which in 2009, accounted for approximately [...] in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|Eating or {{drinking}} during labour {{is an area}} of ongoing debate. While some have argued that eating in labour has no harmful effects on outcomes, others continue to have concern regarding the <b>increased</b> <b>possibility</b> of an aspiration event (choking on recently eaten foods) {{in the event of an}} emergency delivery due to the increased relaxation of the esophagus in pregnancy, upward pressure of the uterus on the stomach, and the possibility of general anesthetic in the event of an emergency cesarean. A 2013 Cochrane review found that with good obstetrical anaesthesia there is no change in harms from allowing eating and drinking during labour in those who are unlikely to need surgery. They additionally acknowledge that not eating does not mean there is an empty stomach or that its contents are not as acidic. They therefore conclude that [...] "women should be free to eat and drink in labour, or not, as they wish." ...|$|E
