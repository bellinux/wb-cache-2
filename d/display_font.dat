5000|$|Sized between 11 and 13 points (96 dpi), glyphs have {{inconsistent}} stroke weight {{without the}} activation of ClearType.

50|$|Notably, {{the display}} {{adapters}} of early personal computers stored tables of bitmapped font characters in ROM.

Note that [...] Embedded OpenType (EOT) font download does not bring in the entire OpenType font and therefore, the most prominent feature of Open Type, ligature support, does not come with EOT. Trident before version 5.0 supports only EOT. EOT is not sufficient for smartfonts that rely on ligatures.|$|R
50|$|The client {{software}} was updated {{many times in}} the late 1990s. Version 1.49 was final for Windows 3.1, except for a date problem that was fixed in version 1.51. Versions 4.0.11 and 5.0.33 were final for Windows 95 and later. Version 4 had attachments and a spell checker, and <b>displayed</b> <b>fonts</b> and colors. For old messages, it had storage folders, each stored in a separate file containing up to 1000 messages.|$|R
50|$|Friz Quadrata is a glyphic serif {{typeface}} {{designed by}} Ernst Friz and Victor Caruso for Visual Graphics Corporation in 1965. VGC {{worked with the}} International Typeface Corporation to create an additional, bold weight. It is currently available from the ITC and Linotype foundries.

50|$|Eurostile is {{a popular}} <b>display</b> <b>font,</b> {{particularly}} suitable for headings and signs. Its linear nature suggests modern architecture, with an appeal both technical and functional. The squarish shapes with their rounded corners evoke the appearance of television screens of the 1950s and 1960s. It is particularly popular in science fiction artwork and media set or produced in the 1960s and 70s, alongside other graphic design use.|$|E

"Eagle Bold" [...] {{derives from}} the usage of the letters [...] "NRA" [...] from the font Novel Gothic in the {{original}} design of the Blue Eagle logo of the National Recovery Association. When the design was accepted {{it was found that}} the other letters in Novel Gothic were [...] "too eccentric" [...] for use on government posters, and so a new, simpler face was designed by Morris Fuller Benton, the co-designer of Novel Gothic, for use on NRA materials. Naturally, it was named for the NRA eagle. It was an all-capitals <b>display</b> <b>font,</b> cast in sizes from 18 to 96 point, and was available at least into the 1940s.|$|E
50|$|Bembo has itself been digitised, {{first as}} Bembo {{and then in}} a second (generally {{considered}} superior) version as Bembo Book, with a caps-only <b>display</b> <b>font</b> Bembo Titling sold separately. A looser interpretation praised by Carter is Iowan Old Style, designed by John Downer and published by Carter's company Bitstream. With a large x-height and influences of signpainting, it was intended to be particularly readable, especially in book text and (in the bolder weights) on signage. It is a default font in Apple's iBooks application and OS X. Cardo is a loose open-source adaptation of Bembo intended for signage. None of these designs has optical sizes intended for different sizes of text, as Yale has.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} version of GIF was called 87a. In 1989, CompuServe released an enhanced version, called 89a, which added support for animation delays (multiple images {{in a stream}} were already supported in 87a), transparent background colors, and storage of application-specific metadata. The 89a specification also supports incorporating text labels as text (not embedding them in the graphical data), but as there is little control over <b>display</b> <b>fonts,</b> this feature is not widely used. The two versions can be distinguished {{by looking at the}} first six bytes of the file (the [...] "magic number" [...] or signature), which, when interpreted as ASCII, read [...] "GIF87a" [...] and [...] "GIF89a", respectively.|$|R
50|$|Inspired by noticeboards using stencilled {{or plastic}} letters {{from a variety}} of sources, Christian Schwartz created the font 'Local Gothic', which {{randomly}} mixes capitals in the loose style of several popular American <b>display</b> capital <b>fonts,</b> Helvetica Bold among them.|$|R

5000|$|The user {{interface}} for font management has been overhauled in Windows 7. As with Windows Vista, {{the collection of}} installed fonts is displayed in a Windows Explorer window, but fonts that originate from the same font family appear as icons that are represented as stacks that <b>display</b> <b>font</b> previews within the interface. Windows 7 also introduces the option to hide installed fonts; certain fonts are automatically removed from view based on a user's regional settings. An option to manually hide installed fonts is also available. Hidden fonts remain installed but are not enumerated when an application asks {{for a list of}} available fonts, thus reducing the amount of fonts to scroll through within the interface and also reducing memory usage. Windows 7 includes over 40 new fonts, including a new [...] "Gabriola" [...] font.|$|E
5000|$|... 40&times;25 {{characters}} {{in up to}} 16 colors. Each character is a pattern of 8&times;8 dots. The effective screen resolution in this mode is 320&times;200 pixels (a pixel aspect ratio of 1:1.2), though individual pixels cannot be addressed independently. The choice of patterns for any location is thus limited {{to one of the}} 256 available characters, the patterns for which are stored in a ROM chip on the card itself. The <b>display</b> <b>font</b> in text mode (the hardware code page 437 character set) is therefore fixed and cannot be changed (although when using the original IBM CGA, it is possible to select one of two different fonts—normal or thin—by changing a jumper. Many clones didn't offer this possibility). The card has sufficient video RAM for eight different text pages in this mode. BIOS Modes 0 & 1 select 40 column text modes. The difference between these two modes can only be seen on a composite monitor; mode 0 disables the color burst, making colors appear in grayscale. Mode 1 enables the color burst, allowing for color. Mode 0 and Mode 1 are functionally identical on RGB monitors and on later adapters that emulate CGA without supporting composite color output.|$|E
40|$|Invited by the Rector of the Universitatea de Arta si Design (formerly the Cluj-Napoca Academy of Arts loan Andreescu), {{to exhibit}} {{her work and}} give a lecture., The {{exhibition}} was held from 6 - 9 April 2005 in the basement 'Galeria Casa Matei' in Matei Corvin House, a historically important fifteenth century city-centre building. The exhibition title referenced the originator of the alphabet, Masrob Mashtots and the first Armenian printer, Yacob Meghapart. The exhibits included 2 digitally-created display fonts for the Armenian alphabet – these characters were the 'tip of the iceberg' of the project which had traced and analysed the forms from the fifth century AD to the present through pen-drawn variations by Armenian scribes and types cut by the renaissance and later punchcutters in Europe. Also exhibited were a series of 17 framed experimental works that explore the aesthetic qualities {{of some of these}} unfamiliar letterforms in a purely abstract way, creating compositions using traditional craft methods employed by pre-digital age designers. The monochrome experimental pieces were based on the letterforms from her Armenian <b>display</b> <b>font</b> designs. Media: ink, gouache paint, hand-made cartridge paper. The exhibition was opened by Alexandru Alamoreanu, Dean of the Faculty. Puzzovio gave a lecture on her subject the following day. The work was featured on the 'Culture' pages of the daily newspaper 'Adevarul de Cluj' (ISSN 1220 - 3203) [URL] on 7 th April. The weekly journal 'Informatia Cluj' also featured the exhibition. A further review written by Rostas-Peter Emese (in Hungarian) was published on a 'culture' website the same week. The interest generated by this exhibition led to the Armenian government invitation to exhibit in the National Gallery, Armenia.

5000|$|Bitmap font support: DPS {{added the}} ability to map PS fonts onto {{hand-drawn}} bitmap fonts and change {{from one to the}} other on the fly. Adobe PS's ability to <b>display</b> <b>fonts</b> on low resolution devices (significantly less than 300 dpi) was very poor. For example, a NeXT screen used only 96 dpi. This PS limitation was worked around by using hand-built bitmap fonts to provide passable quality. Later implementations of PS (including compatible replacements like Ghostscript) provided anti-aliased fonts on grayscale or colour displays, which significantly improved quality. However, this development was too late to be of much use. Modern displays are still around 100 dpi, but have very much superior font quality without using bitmap fonts.|$|R
