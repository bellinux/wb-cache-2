A <b>dialogue</b> <b>tree</b> offers several dialogue options for the player to select. Through conversation, the player can unlock unique quests and dialogue revealing the lore of Dragon Age. It can also be used to persuade or intimidate other characters. The player often must choose between morally ambiguous options, which result in consequences that affect the game's world and progression, and can even lead to the death of a potential companion.

When they dislike or object to the player's decisions, their approval drops, which can result in a companion leaving the party or even attacking the Warden. Approval points can also be influenced by gifts, which will improve any companion's approval but are each intended for a specific companion. Some gifts, if given to the right character, start a cutscene and can even unlock a quest. A high approval rating improves a companion's morale and gives bonuses to their combat abilities. A significant approval rating also makes it possible for the Warden to pursue a romantic relationship with certain companions.

5000|$|Ultima VII: The Black Gate is {{the first}} game in the {{mainline}} Ultima series to use dialogue trees. The first trilogy only allowed simple interaction while the second trilogy used a keyword-based dialogue. Ultima VII retains the old keywords themselves, but uses a <b>dialogue</b> <b>tree</b> where dialogue options are picked with a mouse rather than entered on keyboard; previously, the players had to learn a keyword from other dialogues, which allowed the player, if so desired, {{to find out the}} keyword from other sources (such as walkthroughs). Now, the keywords only appear when they are actually learned beforehand in the game due to the plot. (For example, [...] "thief caught" [...] dialogue option won't actually appear until a thief is actually caught.) The game also features a lot more dialogue than the previous parts; most of the characters have extensive dialogues.|$|E

Maps are significantly larger than the previous games in the franchise, with the explorable area being 10 {{times larger than the}} previous games. The artificial intelligence (AI) of enemies is enhanced; they are now able to respond to the player's actions more responsively, coordinate tactics, and cooperate with each other. The AI of Drake's companions, including Sam and Sully, are improved and they can assist Nathan in combat situations, though the player can not directly command them. A <b>dialogue</b> <b>tree</b> is introduced, though it does not affect the story's progression. The transition between cutscene and gameplay sequences has been described as [...] "seamless". Extra visual filters and modes, such as a zero-gravity mode, bullet time gameplay, and a cel-shaded artstyle, can be unlocked by using points players collected in the main game.|$|E
500|$|The four collaborated {{to write}} {{numerous}} [...] "minutes of gameplay" [...] documents, which conveyed how the game would feel. Church later gave the example, [...] "You {{hear the sound}} of a security camera swiveling, and then the beep of it acquiring you as a target, so you duck behind the crate and then you hear the door open so you throw a grenade and run out of the way". The documents would [...] "hint" [...] at the gameplay systems involved, and at the emergent possibilities in each situation. Although Neurath was involved in these initial design sessions, he believed that the project [...] "was always Doug Church's vision at heart". Church and Grossman refined several of the team's documents and defined the game's design and direction, and Grossman wrote the game's original design document. Grossman built on ideas that he first explored while writing and designing Ultima Underworld IIs tomb dimension, which he later called a [...] "mini-prototype" [...] for System Shock. These concepts included the minimization of <b>dialogue</b> <b>trees</b> and a greater focus on exploration. The team believed that <b>dialogue</b> <b>trees</b> [...] "broke the fiction" [...] of games; Church later commented that the <b>dialogue</b> <b>trees</b> in the Ultima Underworld series were like separate games in themselves, disconnected from main experience of being immersed in the environment. There were also concerns about realism.|$|R

Many games utilise a form of <b>dialogue</b> <b>tree</b> when conversing with characters within a gaming application, allowing the user to choose their question- s/responses. While this method does provide a dynamic conversation system, it is quite a one-sided level of interactivity with the NPC simply responding to the current question without it a ecting the conversation on a whole. We present a novel dialogue system that explores the emo- tional state of the NPC to provide a more complex form of <b>dialogue</b> <b>tree,</b> termed EDTree (Emotional <b>Dialogue</b> <b>Tree).</b> Based on user actions, the interactions between the user and the NPC are enriched by the emo- tional state of the NPC.

Instead of using complex plan-based reasoning, the dialogue manager uses information about possible interaction structures and information from the specific dialogue situation to manage the dialogue.

40|$|Natural {{language}} interfaces require dialogue {{models that}} allow for robust habitable and efficient interaction. This paper presents such a model for dialogue management for natural language interfaces. The model is based on empirical studies of human computer interaction in various simple service applications. It is shown that for applications belonging to this class the dialogue can be handled using fairly simple means. The interaction can be modeled in a dialogue grammar with information on the functional role of an utterance as conveyed in the linguistic structure. Focusing is handled using dialogue objects recorded in a <b>dialogue</b> <b>tree</b> representing the constituents of the dialogue. The dialogue objects in the <b>dialogue</b> <b>tree</b> can be accessed by the various modules for interpretation generation and background system access. Focused entities are modeled in entities pertaining to objects or sets of objects and related domain concept information; properties of the domain objects. A simple copying principle where a new dialogue object's focal parameters are instantiated with information from the preceding dialogue object accounts for most context dependent utterances. The action {{to be carried out}} by the interface is determined on the basis of how the objects and related properties are specified. This in turn depends on information presented in the user utterance context information from the <b>dialogue</b> <b>tree</b> and information in the domain model. The use of dialogue objects facilitates customization to the sublanguage utilized in a specific application. The framework has successfully been applied to various background systems and interaction modalities.
