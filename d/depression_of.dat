5|$|A riot {{occurred}} here on August 1, 1877, {{in which}} armed citizens fired upon strikers, killing four. Many were injured, including Scranton's mayor.

5|$|An {{official}} opening was planned for 19 July 1919 {{but it was}} delayed until Saturday, 26 July 1919 so that Scouts could participate in the Official Peace Festival commemorating the end of World War I.

Because of limited finances, few improvements were made during the Great <b>Depression</b> <b>of</b> the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|As {{construction}} began, Tenrikyo followers {{founded the}} Oyasato Construction Young Men's Association Hinokishin Corps, which volunteered time and labor {{to help build}} the yakata.

40|$|The study explores whether Cloninger’s {{variables}} {{of personality and}} Alexithymia {{are involved in the}} development <b>of</b> <b>depression,</b> in healthy and oncologic subjects. 124 women participated in the study: 21 with cancer and high levels <b>of</b> <b>depression,</b> 37 with cancer and low levels <b>of</b> <b>depression,</b> 19 healthy with depression, and 47 healthy without depression. The HADS was used to assess depression. Alexithymia was measured by the TAS- 20 and personality variables by the TCI. ANCOVA analyses indicate that subjects with high levels <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> show higher Alexithymia and lower Cooperativeness than subjects with low levels <b>of</b> <b>depression,</b> regardless <b>of</b> having cancer. Moreover, results revealed that healthy subjects with high levels <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> show higher levels of Harm-Avoidance and Self-directedness than the remaining groups. While Alexithymia and low Cooperativeness are vulnerability factors to <b>depression,</b> regardless <b>of</b> the clinical condition, Harm-Avoidance and low Self-directedness arise as risk factors <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> only among healthy women...|$|R

The two companies had spent about US$1.5 million (about $ today) in legal fees fighting each other in various contractual, trademark and patent infringement lawsuits since 1905, but, {{on the advice of}} investors, the two companies merged in 1925 to form the Caterpillar Tractor Co. , Caterpillar Inc. was the 229th largest company in the world.|$|E
5|$|North from Nethermost Pike is the <b>depression</b> <b>of</b> Swallow Scarth, {{above the}} head of Nethermost Cove. From here the ridge climbs again, turning to the west as the long plateau of Helvellyn top is reached. Southwards the ridge steps down over High Crag, and narrows as it swings east around Ruthwaite Cove to Dollywaggon Pike. A heavily eroded path runs along the ridge, but {{actually}} bypasses the top of Nethermost Pike to the west, as it leads to Helvellyn.|$|E

40|$|While {{psychotherapy}} is {{the treatment}} of choice in neurotic situational <b>depressions</b> <b>of</b> older patients, it is not effective enough in endogenous bipolar or monopolar <b>depressions</b> <b>of</b> elderly. These respond better to somatic therapy, mainly pharmacotherapy, or, if necessary, ECT. Experience shows the aged endo-genous depressions respond favorably to tricyclic antidepressants {{as well as to}} mono-amino oxidase inhibitors, although the dosage may have to be kept lower than with younger patients. ECT, if necessary, is well tolerated and effective in aged patients. However, proper precautions have to be taken before this treatment is commenced. Patients with a history or signs of recent coronary thrombosis or decom-pensated heart failure should be excluded. Also, the number of treatments should be kept at a minimum. The individual treatments should be spaced farther apart and so-called "intensive treatment " avoided. If an endogenous depression lasts for more than 2 years and does not respond to any other kind of treat-ment, psychosurgery may have to be considered. Experience has shown that long-lasting, deep <b>depressions</b> <b>of</b> the aged can be helped by this method without any important personality change.

40|$|Depression is {{a leading}} cause of {{disability}} worldwide.

5|$|The fourth {{tropical}} <b>depression</b> <b>of</b> {{the season}} formed {{off the coast}} of Antigua on August 14. Initially, forecasters anticipated the system to intensify into a tropical storm; however, a reconnaissance mission into the depression on August15 revealed that it was poorly organized and was declassified a tropical cyclone. Tropical Depression Four peaked at 35mph (55km/h) and dissipated on August 15.|$|E
5|$|The global {{economic}} <b>depression</b> <b>of</b> the early 1930s affected Ireland less {{because of the}} partial recovery following {{the civil war and}} because industry was protected behind tariff barriers established in the Anglo-Irish Trade War (1932–1938). The need for extra sea capacity was readily met by British and other foreign ships. Foreign ships were used, rather than preserving the home fleet. Banks were reluctant to lend to Irish industry, preferring British government gilts.|$|E
5|$|A low {{pressure}} area that developed over the southern Andaman Sea late in April moved north into the Bay of Bengal becoming the first <b>depression</b> <b>of</b> the year on May 2. The depression intensified {{under the influence of}} a high-level anticyclone and became a cyclonic storm the next day. The storm then turned to the northeast and strengthened into a severe cyclonic storm on May 4. Soon after this, it peaked with winds of 150km/h (90mph) and a well-defined eye formed. The storm made its landfall near Cox's Bazar in easternmost East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) early in the morning of May 7 and dissipated over western Burma that evening.|$|E

5|$|Another {{method that}} has been used to {{establish}} the date of eruption is tree-ring dating. Tree-ring data has shown that a large event interfering with normal tree growth in North America occurred during 1629–1628 (±65 years)BCE. Evidence of a climatic event around 1628BCE has been found in studies of growth <b>depression</b> <b>of</b> European oaks in Ireland and of Scotch pines in Sweden. Bristlecone pine frost rings also indicate a date of 1627BCE, supporting the late 1600sBCE dating. Procedural changes in how ice cores are interpreted would bring that data more in line with the dendrochronological numbers.|$|E
5|$|Arlington was {{established}} in the 1880s by settlers and the area was platted as two towns, Arlington and Haller City. Haller City was absorbed by the larger Arlington, which was incorporated as a city in 1903. During the Great <b>Depression</b> <b>of</b> the 1930s, the Arlington area became home to projects under the direction of federal relief agencies, including a municipal airport that would serve as a naval air station during World War II. Beginning in the 1980s, Arlington experienced the effects of suburbanization, growing by over 450 percent by 2000 and annexing the unincorporated area of Smokey Point to the southwest.|$|E
5|$|Bute died in 1900 and his widow, the Marchioness, {{was given}} a life {{interest}} in Castell Coch; during her mourning, she and her daughter, Lady Margaret Crichton-Stuart, occupied the castle and made occasional visits thereafter. Production in the castle vineyards ceased during the First World War due to the shortages of the sugar needed for the fermentation process, and in 1920 the vineyards were uprooted. John, the 4th Marquess, acquired the castle in 1932 but made little use of it. He also began to reduce the family's investments in South Wales. The coal trade had declined after 1918 and industry had suffered during the <b>depression</b> <b>of</b> the 1920s; by 1938, {{the great majority of}} the family interests, including the coal mines and docks, had been sold off or nationalised.|$|E
