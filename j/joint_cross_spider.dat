50|$|This spider is {{commonly}} known as the St Andrew's <b>Cross</b> <b>spider,</b> due to the construction of bands of silk forming the arms of an X-shaped cross, similar to the one upon which St. Andrew is traditionally said to have been crucified. Termed web decorations or stabilimenta, these bands are thought to increase prey capture in this species, however, in other species they have been found to protect the spider against predators.|$|R

50|$|The {{group is}} {{characterized}} by the production of orb webs with catching threads of cribellate silk (i.e. silk made up of very fine threads produced by combing an initial thread using the spider's calamistrum). Uloborids spin vertical orb webs, very similar in shape to those made by araneids, such as the <b>cross</b> <b>spider.</b> Deinopids initially spin an orb web, which they then suspend between their front legs and use as a net to ensnare prey.|$|R
50|$|Common animals include millipedes, {{carpenter}} bees, {{and many}} different types of bird, insects and spiders. Common insect species include cicadas and giant forest ants (Camponotus gigas). Common spider species include the golden orb-web spider (Nephila pilipes) and the St Andrew's <b>Cross</b> <b>spider</b> (Argiope mangal). The Singapore freshwater crab (Johora singaporensis) is indigenous to Bukit Timah. Reptiles in the reserve include the reticulated python (Python reticulatus), the paradise tree snake (Chrysopelea paradisi) and the common sun skink (Eutropis multifasciata).|$|R
50|$|Argiope aetherea is a common, large orb-web spider (family Araneidae). Like {{other species}} of Argiope, it is {{commonly}} known as the St Andrew's <b>Cross</b> <b>spider,</b> due to the characteristic cross-shaped web decorations female spiders often include in their webs. A. aetherea is similar in appearance to A. keyserlingi, however female A. aetherea are generally larger than A. keyserlingi. Like most orb-web spiders, A. aetherea shows considerable sexual size dimorphism, with females being many times larger than males.|$|R

40|$|Using {{a virtual}} spider robot, we studied {{hypotheses}} about the weaving behaviour of orb spiders. Our model spiders built virtual webs that mimicked perfectly the visual architecture of real webs {{of the garden}} <b>cross</b> <b>spider</b> Araneus diadematus. The matching of capture spiral and auxiliary spiral pitch was an apparently emergent property in both types of web. This validated our interpretation of the garden spider's web-building decision rules, which use strictly local interactions with previously placed threads to generate global architecture...|$|R
40|$|We studied {{physiological}} conditions {{during the}} spinning of dragline silk by the garden <b>cross</b> <b>spider,</b> Araneus diadematus. Silk is converted from the liquid feedstock in the gland into a solid thread via a tapering tubular duct and exits at a spigot.

Thus, it appears that spider silk in vivo, like some industrial polymers in vitro, is spun through an acid bath...|$|R

40|$|Joints as opening-mode {{fractures}} play {{important roles}} {{as indicators of}} tectonic stress fields and as pathways for underground fluid flow. This thesis analytically investigates the relationships among <b>cross</b> <b>joint</b> geometry, orientations and ratios of remote principal stresses, and fluid pressure. Results show that main trends of <b>cross</b> <b>joints</b> are perpendicular to the least far field stresses during <b>cross</b> <b>joint</b> formation, and <b>cross</b> <b>joint</b> paths {{can be used to}} determine relative magnitudes of remote principal stresses. Based on the theoretical derivation, <b>cross</b> <b>joint</b> geometries are grouped into five main categories: curving-parallel, curving-perpendicular, quasi-curving-parallel, quasi-curving-perpendicular and non-curving geometries. By introducing the concepts of effective stress and effective remote principal stress ratio, it is demonstrated that connectivity between <b>cross</b> <b>joints</b> and the pre-existing joint is improved for joints that form under relatively high pore pressures...|$|R
