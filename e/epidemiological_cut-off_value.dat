40|$|Background: Clinical {{breakpoints}} and epidemiological {{cut-off values}} for N. gonorrhoeae azithromycin {{antimicrobial susceptibility testing}} have not been established. This study utilized existing minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) data from CDC’s Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project (GISP) to establish epidemiological cut-off values for azithromycin and N. gonorrhoeae as determined by agar dilution. Methods: MIC distributions for the pooled dataset and each data year (2005 - 2012) were constructed. Epidemiological cut-off values were calculated using two methods. Method 1 considers the wild-type MIC distribution, the modal MIC for the distribution, and the inherent variability of the test (± 1 twofold-dilution). Method 2 defines the <b>epidemiological</b> <b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> as two twofold-dilutions higher than the MIC 50. Results: Taking into consideration the wild-type MIC distributions and the inherent variability of the test, the <b>epidemiological</b> <b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> chosen for the pooled dataset and each data year using Method 1 was ≤ 1. 0 µg/mL. The MIC 50 for the pooled dataset and each data year was 0. 25 µg/mL. Two twofold-dilutions higher than the MIC 50 (0. 25 µg/mL) for the pooled dataset and each data year was 1. 0 µg/mL. Discussion: The epidemiological cut-off values chosen using Methods 1 and 2 (≤ 1. 0 µg/mL) were identical for the pooled dataset and each data year, indicating the <b>epidemiological</b> <b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> has not changed from 2005 - 2012. The <b>epidemiological</b> <b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> for N. gonorrhoeae azithromycin agar dilution antimicrobial susceptibility testing established during this study {{can be used to}} help set clinical breakpoints and identify isolates with reduced susceptibility to azithromycin...|$|E
40|$|Tigecycline is {{a member}} of the new group of glycylcyclines and a {{promising}} new antibiotic of last resort, active against many bacteria including Enterococcus spp. 1, 2 Tigecycline acts in a similar way to tetracyclines by binding to the 30 S subunit of the bacterial ribosome and thus inhibiting protein biosynthesis; 1 however, different binding capacities and kinetics also allow activity against tetracycline-resistant bacteria. 1 Enterococcal iso-lates displaying MICs of tigecycline of 0. 25 mg/L are con-sidered susceptible. 3 The <b>epidemiological</b> <b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> (breakpoint) for tigecycline is. 0. 5 mg/L for enterococci. 3 Here, we report the first case of a tigecycline-resistant Enterococcus from a German hospital patient isolated in 2007.

40|$|Objectives: To {{apply the}} {{normalized}} resistance interpretation (NRI) method to Etest MIC results which have higher precision than conventional log(2) dilution MIC tests {{due to the}} inclusion of intermediate values. If successful, NRI might provide an objective tool for the definition of <b>epidemiological</b> MIC <b>cut-off</b> <b>values.</b> Methods: MICs of tigecycline and other antimicrobial agents were determined for 4771 clinical isolates comprising five Gram-positive and 13 Gram-negative species or species groups using the Etest. Histograms of MIC values were constructed for each species and NRI calculations were applied to them. An upper MIC limit of 2. 5 SD above the theoretical mean of the normalized distribution was used for setting the <b>epidemiological</b> <b>cut-off</b> <b>values.</b> Results: Calculated <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> for wild-type strains were between 0. 11 and 0. 96 mg/L for Gram-positive species, and between 0. 44 and 8. 3 mg/L for Gram-negative species, except for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which had a <b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> of 450 mg/L, consistent with earlier reports {{on the lack of}} activity of tigecycline against this species.

40|$|Two {{laboratories}} {{investigated the}} susceptibility of 106 Aeromonas salmonicida strains (from Denmark, France, Ireland, Norway and Scotland) to erythromycin, gentamicin, oxytetracycline and oxolinic acid using the disc diffusion protocols (M 42 -A) {{published by the}} Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. In studies of susceptibility to florfenicol an additional 15 Canadian strains were included. Comparison of the data generated by the two laboratories demonstrated that for each disc both detected a similar pattern of distribution but {{that there was a}} significant numerical difference in the zone sizes they recorded. Analysis of the extent of this lateral shift between the data generated in two laboratories indicated that the application of a single laboratory-independent <b>epidemiological</b> <b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> for each disc could result in disagreement between the laboratories as to whether a strain should be classified as wild-type or non wild-type.

40|$|International audienceAntimicrobial {{susceptibility}} testing plays a {{key role}} in clinical microbiology. The disk diffusion test dates back to the 1940 s and became standardised from the 1950 s, with the International Collaborative Study (ICS) and National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) as the two major standards. Interlaboratory variation of disk test results was recognised early but has never been dealt with in a satisfactory manner. The error-rate bounded method was described in 1974 and its role is discussed. Species-specific susceptibility interpretation was coined in 1980 for and chloramphenicol. In the late 1970 s, more extensive use of species-specific breakpoints was introduced in Lund (Sweden). At the same time, P. Mouton constructed species-specific regression lines and pointed out the difficulties with narrow ranges of minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values. A more general use of species-specific regression lines was made possible with single-strain regression analysis, using one well-defined strain tested in disk diffusion with a range of disk contents. This method made it possible to calibrate the disk test in an individual laboratory. Other methods to achieve such calibration are also described. A recent method, 'MIC-coloured zone diameter histogram-technique', has proven useful for the validation of species-specific interpretive breakpoints. The microbiological breakpoint proposed by Williams in 1990 has experienced a renaissance with the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) <b>epidemiological</b> <b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> (ECOFF). MIC and zone diameter distributions with accompanying ECOFFs for species-antimicrobial combinations are published on the EUCAST website. A method for the reconstruction of wild-type zone diameter populations, namely normalised resistance interpretation, is described. This method can produce resistance figures that are truly comparable between laboratories...|$|E
40|$|VetCAST is the EUCAST {{sub-committee}} for Veterinary Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing. Its remit is {{to define}} clinical breakpoints (CBPs) for antimicrobial drugs (AMDs) used in veterinary medicine in Europe. This position paper outlines the procedures and reviews scientific options to solve {{challenges for the}} determination of specific CBPs for animal species, drug substances and disease conditions. VetCAST will adopt EUCAST approaches: the initial step will be data assessment; then procedures for decisions on the CBP; and finally the release of recommendations for CBP implementation. The principal challenges anticipated by VetCAST are those associated with the differing modalities of AMD administration, including mass medication, specific long-acting product formulations or local administration. Specific challenges comprise mastitis treatment in dairy cattle, the range of species and within species breed considerations and several other variable factors not relevant to human medicine. Each CBP {{will be based on}} consideration of: (i) an <b>epidemiological</b> <b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> (ECOFF) - the highest MIC that defines {{the upper end of the}} wild-type MIC distribution; (ii) a PK/PD breakpoint obtained from pre-clinical pharmacokinetic data [this PK/PD break-point is the highest possible MIC for which a given percentage of animals in the target population achieves a critical value for the selected PK/PD index (fAUC/MIC or fT > MIC) ] and (iii) when possible, a clinical cut-off, that is the relationship between MIC and clinical cure. For the latter, VetCAST acknowledges the paucity of such data in veterinary medicine. When a CBP cannot be established, VetCAST will recommend use of ECOFF as surrogate. For decision steps, VetCAST will follow EUCAST procedures involving transparency, consensus and independence. VetCAST will ensure freely available dissemination of information, concerning standards, guidelines, ECOFF, PK/PD breakpoints, CBPs and other relevant information for AST implementation. Finally, after establishing a CBP, VetCAST will promulgate expert comments and/or recommendations associated with CBPs to facilitate their sound implementation in a clinical setting. </p...|$|E

Therefore we analysed {{the development of}} resistance in porcine before and after danofloxacin and tylosin treatments at a farrowing farm. Danofloxacin-treated (= 12, group A) and control pigs (= 15, group B) were subsequently treated with tylosin and sampled longitudinally. were isolated and susceptibilities to ciprofloxacin and erythromycin were assessed, isolates were genotyped with PFGE and resistance-related mutations were identified. Isolates from the danofloxacin-treated pigs had more frequently non-wild type MICs (above the <b>epidemiological</b> <b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> (ECOFF)) for ciprofloxacin (< 0. 001) and erythromycin (< 0. 05) than those isolated before danofloxacin or those from the controls. Subsequent tylosin treatment increased proportion of isolates with non-wild type MICs for erythromycin in both group A and B (< 0. 01) and, interestingly, proportion of isolates with non-wild type MICs for ciprofloxacin in group B (< 0. 001) with high MICs (128 μg/ml). PFGE analysis revealed treatments selecting predominant genotypes with variable resistance patterns and decreasing initial diversity of genotypes. The most common genotype had mainly high MICs for ciprofloxacin among danofloxacin-treated pigs but wild type MICs (below the ECOFF) among the controls housed in the same pens. This suggests that the non-wild type isolate was rarely transmitted or outcompeting wild type genotype in the control pigs without selection pressure. Isolates exhibiting non-wild type MICs for ciprofloxacin harboured the C 257 T (Thr- 86 -Ile) mutation in the gene. In conclusion, a high dose of danofloxacin used at the farm did not prevent emergence of isolates with high MICs for ciprofloxacin. After subsequent tylosin treatment isolates had even higher MICs for ciprofloxacin and erythromycin than before the treatment. Therefore, controlled use of antimicrobials in food animal production is essential...|$|E

Isolates were investigated by polymerase chain reaction for aadA, strA, and strB streptomycin resistance genes. Out of 236 Salmonella isolates, 32 (13. 5 %) yielded amplicons for aadA (n¿=¿ 23), strA (n¿=¿ 9), and strB (n¿=¿ 11). None of the 60 Salmonella isolates exhibiting MIC 4 ¿mg/L harbored resistance genes. Of the Salmonella isolates exhibiting MICs 8 ¿mg/L, 16 ¿mg/L, and 32 ¿mg/L, 1. 6 %, 15 %, and 39 %, respectively, tested positive for one or more genes. For most monitoring programs, the streptomycin ECOFF for Salmonella is wild type (WT) = 32 or = 16 ¿mg/L. A cut-off value of WT = 32 ¿mg/L would have misclassified 13. 5 % of the strains as belonging to the WT population, since this proportion of strains harbored resistance genes and exhibited MICs = 32 ¿mg/L. Out of 208 E. coli strains, 80 (38. 5 %) tested positive for aadA (n¿=¿ 69), strA (n¿=¿ 18), and strB (n¿=¿ 31).

This analysis calculated a <b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> of ≤ 0. 25 μg mL- 1 and categorized 33 (56 %) of the isolates as manifesting reduced susceptibility to florfenicol. For the oxytetracycline MIC data the NRI analysis also treated the distribution as bimodal. The distribution of the normalized values for the putative WT observation had a standard deviation of 0. 951 log 2 μg mL- 1. This analysis gave a <b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> of ≤ 0. 5 μg mL- 1 and categorized five isolates (9 %) as manifesting reduced susceptibility to oxytetracycline. The susceptibility testing protocol developed in this study was capable of generating MIC data from all the isolates tested.

The ECOFFs determined were 1. 0 mg/L for ciprofloxacin, 0. 50 mg/L for levofloxacin, 1. 0 mg/L for moxifloxacin, 1. 0 mg/L for erythromycin, 1. 0 mg/L for azithromycin, 0. 50 mg/L for clarithromycin, 1. 0 mg/L for cefotaxime, 0. 032 mg/L for rifampicin, 16 mg/L for tigecycline, and 8 mg/L for doxycycline. CONCLUSION: All isolates were inhibited by low concentrations of the fluoroquinolones and macrolides tested, with somewhat higher MICs for the fluoroquinolones. Rifampicin was found to be the most active against L. pneumophila isolates in vitro. These data can be used as a reference for the detection of resistance in clinical L. pneumophila isolates and as a setting of clinical breakpoints...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{correlations between}} antimicrobial {{use and the}} prevalence of resistance in commensal Escherichia coli isolates from pigs, poultry and cattle, using data from publicly available national or international reports from seven European countries. Methods: The link between the quantities of different classes of antimicrobials administered to food-producing animals per country(expressed in mg/population correction unit) and the prevalence {{of resistance to the}} different antimicrobial classes (interpreted by EUCAST <b>epidemiological</b> <b>cut-off</b> <b>values)</b> in E. coli isolates (4831 isolates in total) was assessed by means of polynomial regression analysis and determination of Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Results: A quadratic regression best fitted the antimicrobial use and antimicrobial resistance data. The coefficient of determination was, in decreasing order, 0. 99 for fluoroquinolones and amphenicols, 0. 94 for third-generation cephalosporins and sulphonamides, 0. 93 for aminopenicillins, 0. 86 for fluoroquinolones, 0. 81 for streptomycin and 0. 80 for gentamicin and tetracycline. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was 1 for amphenicols, 0. 96 for sulphonamides, 0. 93 for streptomycin and tetracycline, 0. 89 for aminopenicillins, 0. 71 for gentamicin and 0. 70 for third-generation cephalosporins. Conclusions: These remarkably high coefficients indicate that, at a national level, the level of use of specific antimicrobials strongly correlates to the level of resistance towards these agents in commensal E. coli isolates in pigs, poultry and cattle. However, data restraints reveal the need for further detail in collection and harmonization of antimicrobial resistance and use data in Europe...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWith the {{emergence}} of reduced susceptibility of Clostridium difficile to metronidazole and vancomycin the value of antimicrobial susceptibility testing has increased. The aim of our study was to evaluate disk diffusion for susceptibility testing of C. difficile by comparing disk diffusion results with MICs from gradient tests and to propose zone diameter breakpoint correlates for the EUCAST <b>epidemiological</b> <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> (ECOFFs) recently published. We tested 211 clinical isolates of C. difficile, from patients with diarrhoea hospitalized at Aarhus and Odense University Hospitals, Denmark. Furthermore, ten clinical isolates of C. difficile from the Anaerobe Reference Laboratory, University Hospital of Wales, with known reduced susceptibility to either metronidazole or vancomycin, were included. Isolates were tested with Etest gradient strips and disk diffusion towards metronidazole, vancomycin and moxifloxacin on Brucella Blood Agar supplemented with hemin and vitamin K. We found an excellent agreement between inhibition zone diameter and MICs. For each MIC value, the inhibition zones varied from 0 to 8 mm, with 93 % of values within 6 mm for metronidazole, 95 % of values within 4 mm for vancomycin, and 98 % of values within 4 mm for moxifloxacin. With proposed zone diameter breakpoints for metronidazole, vancomycin and moxifloxacin of WT ≥ 23 mm, WT ≥ 19 and WT ≥ 20 mm, respectively, we found no very major errors and only major errors below 2 %. In conclusion, we suggest that disk diffusion is an option for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of C. difficile...|$|R
40|$|Although {{guidelines}} {{for the treatment of}} Malassezia furfur fungemia are not yet defined, clinical data suggest that amphotericin B (AmB) is effective for treating systemic infections. In the absence of clinical breakpoints for Malassezia yeasts, <b>epidemiological</b> <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> (ECVs) are useful to discriminate between isolates with and without drug resistance. This study aimed to compare the distribution of minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the ECVs for AmB of both deoxycholate (d-AmB) and liposomal (l-AmB) formulations of M. furfur isolates. The 84 M. furfur strains analyzed, which included 56 from blood, sterile sites and catheters, and 28 from skin, were isolated from patients with bloodstream infections. MICs were determined by the modified broth microdilution method of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). The l-AmB MIC and the ECVs were two-fold lower than those of d-AmB and a lower l-AmB mean MIC value was found for blood isolates than from skin. The ECVs for l-AmB and d-AmB were 8 mg/l and 32 mg/l, respectively. Three strains (3. 6 %) showed l-AmB MIC higher than ECV (MIC > 8 mg/l) of which two were isolated from the catheter tip of patients treated with micafugin, l-Amb and fluconazole, and one from skin. The results showed that the l-AmB might be employed for assessing the in vitro antifungal susceptibility of M. furfur by a modified CLSI protocol and that ECVs might be useful for detecting the emergence of resistance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) are {{the most}} common bovine {{mastitis}} causing bacteria in many countries. It is known that resistance for antimicrobials is in general more common in CoNS than in Staphylococcus aureus but {{little is known about the}} antimicrobial resistance of specific CoNS species. In this study, 400 CoNS isolates from bovine mastitic milk samples were identified to species level using ribotyping and MALDI-TOF MS, and their antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using a commercially available microdilution system. The results were interpreted according to the <b>epidemiological</b> <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> by the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility testing. Results The most common CoNS species were S. simulans, S. epidermidis, S. chromogenes and S. haemolyticus. Penicillin resistance was the most common type of antimicrobial resistance. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most resistant among the four major species. Almost one-third of our S. epidermidis isolates were resistant to > 2 antimicrobials and close to 7  % were multidrug resistant. The majority of S. epidermidis isolates were resistant to benzylpenicillin. On the contrary, only few S. simulans isolates were penicillin-resistant. Phenotypic oxacillin resistance was found in all four main species, and 34  % of the isolates were oxacillin resistant. However, only 21 isolates (5  %) were positive for the mecA gene. Of these, 20 were S. epidermidis and one S. sciuri. mecC positive isolates were not found. Conclusion Staphylococcus epidermidis differed from the three other major CoNS species as resistance to the tested antimicrobials was common, several isolates were multidrug resistant, and 19  % of the isolates carried the mecA gene encoding methicillin resistance...|$|R
40|$|To date {{there are}} no clear {{criteria}} {{to determine whether a}} microbe is susceptible to biocides or not. As a starting point for distinguishing between wild-type and resistant organisms, we set out to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) distributions for four common biocides; triclosan, benzalkonium chloride, chlorhexidine and sodium hypochlorite for 3319 clinical isolates, with a particular focus on Staphylococcus aureus (N =  1635) and Salmonella spp. (N =  901) but also including Escherichia coli (N =  368), Candida albicans (N =  200), Klebsiella pneumoniae (N =  60), Enterobacter spp. (N =  54), Enterococcus faecium (N =  53), and Enterococcus faecalis (N =  56). From these data <b>epidemiological</b> <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> (ECOFFs) are proposed. As would be expected, MBCs were higher than MICs for all biocides. In most cases both values followed a normal distribution. Bimodal distributions, indicating the existence of biocide resistant subpopulations were observed for Enterobacter chlorhexidine susceptibility (both MICs and MBCs) and the susceptibility to triclosan of Enterobacter (MBC), E. coli (MBC and MIC) and S. aureus (MBC and MIC). There is a concern on the potential selection of antibiotic resistance by biocides. Our results indicate however that resistance to biocides and, hence any potential association with antibiotic resistance, is uncommon in natural populations of clinically relevant microorganisms. The work was supported by European Community FP 7 project KBBE- 227258 (BIOHYPO), which is a research project aimed at evaluating the impact of biocide use on the generation of antibiotic resistance.

40|$|Lactic acid {{bacteria}} {{isolated from}} Aloreña table olives throughout fermentation process were resistant {{at least to}} three antibiotics (Casado Muñoz et al., 2014), however they were very sensitive to all biocides tested in this study (MIC below the <b>epidemiological</b> <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> “ECOFF” determined in the present study) except 2 - 15 % of Lc. pseudomesenteroides which were resistant to hexachlorophene and Lb. pentosus to cetrimide and hexadecylpiridinium. To give new insights of how LAB become resistant in a changing environment, the effect of different physico-chemical stresses -including antimicrobials- on phenotypic and genotypic responses of LAB was analyzed in the present study. The results obtained indicated that a similar phenotypic response was obtained under all stress conditions tested (antimicrobials, chemicals and UV light) producing changes in susceptibility patterns of antibiotics (increased MICs for ampicillin, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, teicoplanin and tetracycline, while decreased MICs were shown for clindamycin, erythromycin, streptomycin and trimethoprim {{in the majority of}} strains). By means of statistical analysis, cross resistance between different antibiotics was detected in all stress conditions. However, expression profiles of selected genes involved in stress/resistance (rpsL, recA, uvrB and srtA genes) were different depending on the stress parameter, LAB species and strain, and also the target gene. We can conclude that, in spite of the uniform phenotypic responses to several stresses, the repertoire of induced and repressed genes were different upon the stress parameter and the LAB strain. So, a search for a target to improve stress tolerance of LAB especially those of importance as starter/protective cultures or as probiotics may depend on the individual screening of each strain although, we could predict the antibiotic phenotypic response to all stresses...|$|R

40|$|The susceptibilities of 106 {{strains of}} Aeromonas salmonicida to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (SFT) were {{determined}} in two laboratories using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute's M 42 -A disc diffusion protocols. The data {{generated by the}} use of discs containing 25 μg SFT (SFT 25) allowed the strains to be placed into two groups. Strains in one group (17 strains) generated no inhibition zones and the zones obtained from the other 89 strains were distributed over a wide range but showed no natural division into separate sub-classes. A further investigation performed by one of the participating laboratories, of the susceptibility of 91 of these 106 strains used discs containing 100 μg sulfmethoxazole (SFM 100) and 5 μg trimethoprim (TMP 5). Application of normalised resistance interpretation to these data allowed the estimation of <b>epidemiological</b> <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> for WT strains of ≥ 9 mm for SFM 100 and ≥ 21 mm for TMP 5. This investigation demonstrated the presence of three distinct phenotypic classes, one containing strains manifesting wild type susceptibility to both agents, another containing strains manifesting non-wild type susceptibility to both and a third containing strains manifesting wild type susceptibility with respect to TMP but non-wild type with respect to SFM. Analysis demonstrated the inability of SFT 25 discs to generate data that allowed the separate identification of strains that were fully susceptible to both TMP and SFM from those that were fully susceptible to TMP but were not fully susceptible to SFM. It is recommended that, in investigation of the susceptibility to potentiated sulphonamides of isolates from diseased fish, separate discs, containing the individual components of the mixture, should be employed.
