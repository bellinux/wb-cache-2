5|$|A {{branch to}} Sola has been {{considered}} to allow the trains to operate to Sola and the airport. The line would branch from the Sørland Line south of Gausel, and be built so trains from the branch could run both northwards and southwards. Proposed stations include the airport, Solakrossen, Forus West, Statoil's head office and possibly the shopping center Kvadrat. This would give a travel time of 17 minutes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>airport</b> <b>to</b> the city center, and 10 minutes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>airport</b> <b>to</b> Sandnes. This route has, however, also been proposed {{as part of the}} light rail system. It would give about 2.5 million annual passengers.|$|E

5|$|I-195 was {{constructed}} in three sections. The first section was a connection between MD 295 and the airport. This segment was built as Maryland Route 46 and completed in 1951 shortly after {{the opening of the}} airport, which was originally named Friendship International Airport. The second segment was completed {{at the opposite end of}} the highway in the mid-1970s, connecting U.S. Route 1 (US 1) and I-95 with MD 166 and UMBC. The first two segments were connected when the portion between MD 295 and US 1 {{was constructed}} in the late 1980s. The whole length of the highway was completed and was marked as I-195 in 1990. In 2015, the eastern terminus was cut back <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>airport</b> <b>to</b> MD 170, with the former section between those two points becoming MD 995A.|$|E
5|$|The Silver Line has {{two primary}} goals. The {{first is to}} link Washington, D.C. by rail to Washington Dulles International Airport and the edge cities of Tysons Corner, Reston, Herndon, and Ashburn. The second is to spur urban {{development}} in Tysons Corner and reduce overall reliance on highway traffic in the business district, Virginia's largest and the 12th-largest in the country. The district's area is comparable in size to downtown Washington, D.C., but is rather insulated from its surrounding neighborhoods and has no existing grid pattern in its streets. The Silver Line would also improve public access to the Udvar-Hazy Center, an annex of National Air and Space Museum located near Dulles Airport; Virginia Regional Transit currently runs a shuttle bus <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>airport</b> <b>to</b> Udvar-Hazy.|$|E
