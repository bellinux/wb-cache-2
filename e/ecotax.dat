50|$|An <b>Ecotax</b> (short for {{ecological}} taxation) {{is a tax}} levied on activities which {{are considered to be}} harmful to the environment and is intended to promote environmentally friendly activities via economic incentives. Such a policy can complement or avert the need for regulatory (command and control) approaches. Often, an <b>ecotax</b> policy proposal may attempt to maintain overall tax revenue by proportionately reducing other taxes (e.g. taxes on human labor and renewable resources); such proposals are known as a green tax shift towards ecological taxation. Ecotaxes address the failure of free markets to consider environmental impacts.|$|E

5000|$|However, {{conventional}} regulatory approaches {{can affect}} prices {{in much the}} same way, while lacking the revenue-recycling potential of ecotaxes. Moreover, correctly assessing distributive impact of any tax shift requires an analysis of the specific instrument design features. For example, tax revenue could be redistributed on a per capita basis as part of a basic income scheme; in this case, the poorest would gain what the average citizen pays as ecotaxes, minus their own small contribution (no car, small apartment, ...). This design would be highly progressive. Alternatively, an <b>ecotax</b> can have a [...] "lifeline" [...] design, in which modest consumption levels are priced relatively low (even zero, in the case of water), and higher consumption levels are priced at a higher rate. Furthermore, an <b>ecotax</b> policy package can include revenue recycling to reduce or eliminate any regressivity; an increase in an <b>ecotax</b> could be more than offset by a decrease in a (regressive) payroll or consumption tax. Some proponents claim a second benefit of increased employment or lower health care costs as the market and society adjust to the new fiscal policy (these claims, as with the claim [...] "tax cuts create jobs," [...] are often difficult to prove or disprove even after the fact).|$|E

50|$|One {{issue with}} energy {{rationing}} {{is the cost}} of setting up a rationing schemes. Another criticism is that energy rationing schemes are unworkable and face many practical problems including consumer lawsuits. Due to the general disdain for restrictions that interfere with existing personal freedoms, such as <b>ecotaxes</b> and carbon rationing, energy rationing is not favoured by policy makers to mitigate global warming.|$|R
50|$|Tax shift or Tax swap is {{a change}} in {{taxation}} that eliminates or reduces one or several taxes and establishes or increases others while keeping the overall revenue the same. The term can refer to desired shifts, such as towards Pigovian taxes (typically sin taxes and <b>ecotaxes)</b> as well as (perceived or real) undesired shifts, such as a shift from multi-state corporations to small businesses and families.|$|R

The second adjusted the taxes to favor efficient conventional power plants. The third increased the tax on petroleum. At the same time, income taxes were reduced proportionally so that the total tax burden remained constant.|$|E

There are significant industries for lumber and mineral extraction; the state's resources include gold, coal, silver, talc, and vermiculite. <b>Ecotaxes</b> on resource extraction are numerous. A 1974 state severance tax on coal (which varied from 20 to 30 percent) was upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States in Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana, 453 U.S. 609 (1981).|$|R
50|$|The {{regional}} government of Balearic Islands (then held by an ecosocialist coalition) established an <b>ecotax</b> in 1999. The Balearic Island suffer a high human pressure from tourism, {{that at the}} same time provides the main source of income. The tax (€1.00 per person per day) would be paid by visitors staying at tourist resorts. This was criticized by the conservative opposition as contrary to business interests, and they abolished the tax in 2003 after seizing back the government.|$|E

5000|$|However, {{the most}} common type of {{solution}} is a tacit agreement through the political process. Governments are elected to represent citizens and to strike political compromises between various interests. Normally governments pass laws and regulations to address pollution and other types of environmental harm. These laws and regulations can take the form of [...] "command and control" [...] regulation (such as setting standards, targets, or process requirements), or environmental pricing reform (such as <b>ecotaxes</b> or other Pigovian taxes, tradable pollution permits or the creation of markets for ecological services). The second type of resolution is a purely private agreement between the parties involved.|$|R
500|$|One {{approach}} to this dilemma has been the attempt to [...] "internalize" [...] these [...] "externalities" [...] by using market strategies like <b>ecotaxes</b> and incentives, tradeable permits for carbon, and the encouragement of payment for ecosystem services. Community currencies associated with Local Exchange Trading Systems (LETS), a gift economy and Time Banking have also been promoted {{as a way of}} supporting local economies and the environment. Green economics is another market-based attempt to address issues of equity and the environment. The global recession and a range of associated government policies are likely to bring the biggest annual fall in the world's carbon dioxide emissions in 40 years.|$|R
50|$|Together {{with the}} Green Party of Switzerland, the Social Democrats have common {{environmentalist}} policies, which {{are reflected in}} the expansion of <b>ecotax</b> reforms and increased state support for energy saving measures and renewable energies. The SP is against the construction of new roads where possible and instead proposes to shift the transportation of goods from the roads to the railways and the introduction of a cap and trade and traffic management system when it comes to transportation across the Swiss Alps. Furthermore, the SP stands for an expansion of the public transportation system network and opposes nuclear energy.|$|E
5000|$|The Pigou Club is {{described}} by its creator, economist and blogger N. Gregory Mankiw, as [...] "an elite group of economists and pundits with {{the good sense to}} have publicly advocated higher Pigovian taxes, such as gasoline taxes or carbon taxes." [...] These pundits and economists often advocate lowering other taxes to keep the total amount of taxes collected the same, though many have also proposed dedicating the revenue to other worthwhile projects. A Pigovian tax (also spelled Pigouvian tax, named after economist Arthur Cecil Pigou) is a tax levied to correct the negative externalities (negative side-effects) of a market activity. These ideas are also known as an <b>Ecotax</b> (or green tax shift).|$|E
50|$|A fuel tax (also {{known as}} a petrol, {{gasoline}} or gas tax, or as a fuel duty) is an excise tax imposed {{on the sale of}} fuel. In most countries the fuel tax is imposed on fuels which are intended for transportation. Fuels used to power agricultural vehicles, and/or home heating oil which is similar to diesel are taxed at a different, usually lower rate. The fuel tax receipts are often dedicated or hypothecated to transportation projects so that the fuel tax is considered by many a user fee. In other countries, the fuel tax is a source of general revenue. Sometimes, the fuel tax is used as an <b>ecotax,</b> to promote ecological sustainability. Fuel taxes are often considered regressive taxes.|$|E
40|$|Incitation {{measures}} {{in favour of}} a conservation of genetic diversity for agricultural matters. 2. Analysis of the Belgian agro-environmental measures. The environmental cost of an intensive agriculture can be high. Nevertheless, any policy {{to protect the environment}} and the biological diversity has {{to take into account the}} agricultural sector considering the surface of national territory taken up by cultivated lands. The political authorities are faced with the choke of either to assert the individuel responsability for naturel resources by <b>ecotaxes</b> or to soften, by agroenvironmental measures, the productivist logic of our agriculture by attenuating the most flagrant nuisances to which the general public is the most sensitive. The environmental benefit of the application of agro-environmental measures will depend above all on their impact and on the farmers participation. To know the efficiency of the measures would require the use of tools assessing their impact. Concerning the extent of the adoption of the agro-environmental measures by the agricultural world, it is obvions that it will chiefly be determined by their economic attractivity. As yet, it generally seems low. Concerning the enforcement of <b>ecotaxes,</b> it should be progressive, so as not to penalize farmers which have a vert' narrow margin to manoeuvre in changing their crop management sequence. The objective of a sustainable agriculture would require the setting-up, of three action lines, complementary to the particular measures previously mentioned: the setting-up of instruments to measure biodiversity; the establishment of measures for a financial evaluation of the net cost of agroenvironmental measures; the setting-up of coordinated policies for research and other instruments of agricultural policy...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{develops}} a mathematical programming model {{for assessing the}} impact of Environmental Policy instruments on French winegrowing farm’s adoption of pesticides-saving technologies. We model choices with regards to investment in precision farming and plant protection practices, in a multi-periodic framework with sequential decision, integrating uncertainty on fungal disease pressure and imperfect information on equipment performance. We focus on recursive models maximizing a Utility function. These models are applied on {{a representative sample of}} 534 winegrowers from the French Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN). As expected, both <b>ecotaxes</b> and green subsidies make precision farming equipment more profitable, but the investment rate remains however low and concentrated on basic systems. One explanation is grower’s financial constraint in a context of market crisis and farm indebtedness. Shortcomings and further development of the models are discussed.
