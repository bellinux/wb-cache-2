The river terrapin (Batagur baska), Indian flap-shelled turtles (Lissemys punctata), peacock soft-shelled turtles (Trionyx hurum), yellow monitors (Varanus flavescens), Asian water monitors (Varanus salvator), and Indian pythons (Python molurus) are some resident species.|$|E

5000|$|These geckos are {{frequently}} {{found in the}} pet trade, including corporate chain stores, usually identified only as [...] "house gecko". While there are other species of gecko available under the same common name, the Cosymbotus platyurus is easily identified by the flaps of skin along its sides, making them resemble a miniature flying gecko (Ptychozoon genus). They are easily maintained in a terrarium with frequent misting and insect prey, {{but they are not}} easy to handle. Also, herpetoculturists often use this species in addition to anoles as a feeder lizard for some species of <b>snakes,</b> especially Asian <b>green</b> <b>vine</b> <b>snakes</b> (Ahaetulla prasina).|$|R
5000|$|The Dahong Palay (also spelled Dahon palay or Dahompalay), {{literally}} [...] "rice leaf" [...] in Tagalog, is a single-edged sword {{from the}} Philippines, specifically the Southern Tagalog provinces of Batangas and Mindoro. The sword's name could either be {{a reference to}} the similarity of its shape to the leaves of rice or to local green snakes [...] "dahong palay", purported to be extremely venomous. The snake is probably green specimens of the Philippine Pit Viper, Trimeresurus flavomaculatus, though it is sometimes identified as various relatively harmless <b>green</b> <b>snakes,</b> like <b>vine</b> <b>snakes.</b> The dahong palay was originally used as a farmer's tool, for clearing thick grass growths. However, during the Philippine revolution of 1896, farmers from Batangas soon came to favor it for its slashing and thrusting [...] "feel".|$|R

50|$|Oxybelis is a genus of {{colubrid}} snakes, {{endemic to}} the Americas, which are {{commonly known as}} <b>vine</b> <b>snakes.</b> Though similar in appearance to the Asian species of <b>vine</b> <b>snakes</b> of the genus Ahaetulla, they are not related, and are an example of convergent evolution.|$|R
50|$|Oxybelis fulgidus, {{commonly}} known as the <b>green</b> <b>vine</b> <b>snake</b> or the flatbread snake (not to be confused with Ahaetulla nasuta), is a species of long, slender, arboreal colubrid snake, which is endemic to Central America and northern South America.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>green</b> <b>vine</b> <b>snake</b> (Ahaetulla nasuta) is {{a slender}} green tree snake found in India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Burma, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam. It {{is not to}} be {{confused}} with Oxybelis fulgidus, [...] "green vine snake" [...] found in Central and South America.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>green</b> <b>vine</b> <b>snake</b> is diurnal and mildly venomous. The reptile {{normally}} {{feeds on}} frogs and lizards using its binocular vision to hunt. They are slow moving, relying on camouflaging as a vine in foliage. The snake expands its body when disturbed {{to show a}} black and white scale marking. Also, they may open their mouth in threat display and point their head {{in the direction of the}} perceived threat.|$|E

50|$|Several {{kinds of}} {{reptiles}} and amphibians, including endemic species, inhabit the forest.

Lizards {{that can be seen}} include the green forest lizard (Calotes calotes), Sri Lanka kangaroo-lizard (Otocryptis wiegmanni) and the whistling lizard (Calotes liolepis). Many species of skinks, geckos, frogs and toads also inhabit the forest.|$|E

They may have bidentate tips as in some spp of Natrix. Some snakes, such as the Short Seasnake Lapemis curtus, may have spinelike and juxtaposed scales while others may have large and non-overlapping knobs as in the case of the Javan Mudsnake Xenodermis javanicus.|$|E

50|$|The <b>green</b> <b>vine</b> <b>snake</b> stays high {{on trees}} {{and looks down}} to the ground. When a mouse, lizard or nest is found, the snake follows the prey a short {{distance}} and smells it carefully. If the snake is content with it, it bites into the head and lifts the prey 20 - 40 cm from the ground. With this the snake prevents the prey from using its physical strength. The vine snake has two larger upper teeth {{at the back of}} its mouth; these teeth permit the toxic saliva to penetrate the wounds and to immobilize the prey. Then it is rapidly swallowed. Once the prey is completely in the snake's body, the vine snake searches for a resting place, usually in the highest point of a tree. The venom of Oxybelis fulgidus is fast acting on small animals, but has little or no effect on humans. Envenomation of human beings is rare as the rear fangs require the snake to grab and chew to get its venom in, something most people will not stand for. In the rare instance of human envenomation, slight tingling to temporary numbness {{at the site of the}} bite is reported. As with all venomous creatures, serious allergic reactions are possible so caution should still be taken when handling these snakes.|$|E
