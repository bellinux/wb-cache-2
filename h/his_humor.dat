He joined the Delta Upsilon fraternity {{in his first}} year, and continued to partake in the camaraderie that he had enjoyed at Phillips Exeter while still doing well in school. He did especially well in his English and government classes. <b>His</b> <b>humor</b> and style began to reveal themselves during this time: Benchley was {{often called upon to}} entertain his fraternity brothers, and his impressions of classmates and professors became very popular. His performances gave him some local fame, and most entertainment programs on campus and many off-campus meetings recruited Benchley's talents.|$|E

25|$|Resurrection Blues (2002) is Arthur Miller's {{penultimate}} play. Though Miller was {{not known}} for <b>his</b> <b>humor,</b> this play uses a pointed comedic edge to intensify his observations about the dangers, {{as well as the}} benefits, of blind belief: political, religious, economic and emotional.|$|E

25|$|Steele {{caused some}} {{controversy}} when touring in Europe to support Slow Deep and Hard, thanks to rumors about his {{social and political}} views, with some critics {{going so far as}} to brand him a Nazi sympathizer, even though his bandmate, Josh Silver, is Jewish. Steele suggested that the European press had misunderstood <b>his</b> <b>humor,</b> and that his sarcasm was sometimes lost in translation to print.|$|E
25|$|Moreno's second Hollywood feature, Pepe, {{attempted}} {{to replicate the}} success of his first. The film had cameo appearances by Frank Sinatra, Judy Garland and other stars. <b>His</b> <b>humor,</b> deeply rooted in the Spanish language, did not translate well for the American audience and the movie was a notorious box office disappointment. He still earned a Golden Globe nomination for his part. Later in a 1992 American interview, Moreno cited the language barrier as the biggest impediment to his making it big in the United States.|$|E
25|$|His {{role in the}} Romanian context was {{likened to}} those of Honoré de Balzac in France, Charles Dickens in the United Kingdom, and Nikolai Gogol in the Russian Empire. Literary critic Pompiliu Constantinescu {{credited}} Caragiale's sense of irony with having corrected the tendencies of his day, and, through this, with helping create an urban literature. Caragiale's interest in Realism was however denied by some of his Junimist advocates, who attempted to link his entire work with Maiorescu's guidelines: {{on the basis of}} Schopenhauerian aesthetics, critic Mihail Dragomirescu postulated that <b>his</b> <b>humor</b> was pure, and did not draw on any special circumstance or context.|$|E

25|$|Kailasam's {{life was}} {{dedicated}} to local theater and his contributions revolutionised it. <b>His</b> <b>humor</b> left an impression on Kannadigas. He opposed the company theatre's obsession with mythology and stories of royalty and shied away from loading his plays with music. Instead, he introduced simple, realistic sets. Kailasam chaired the Kannada Sahitya Sammelana held at Madras in 1945. He spent almost 10 years in a place he called 'NOOK'. It was a very dirty place, yet he loved it and wrote many dramas in there. He dictated his stories to his students at the 'NOOK', usually starting after 10 pm. He was a chain smoker.|$|E
500|$|Blumenfeld {{was born}} in Afula, Israel, and moved to Los Angeles {{at the age of}} two with his parents and two older brothers—his family is Reform Jewish. He has {{described}} how he became aware of <b>his</b> <b>humor</b> early on: [...] "I realized I was funny at an early age, I realized I could make people laugh at a later age, and then by college time, I was trying to make jokes in terms of writing".|$|E
500|$|Speaking {{about the}} role his {{education}} had in shaping <b>his</b> <b>humor,</b> Blumenfeld said: [...] "I went to Jewish schools growing up and that's where my sense of humor was cultivated. Everybody was funny." [...] Blumenfeld has said he is influenced by television programs that he watched while growing up, including The Simpsons, Seinfeld, and Saturday Night Live, which he says [...] "taught me how to think ... absurdly ... creatively and originally about jokes that people were making" [...] and make [...] "jokes on jokes". He has cited Larry David as an influence, and also likes Louie and Curb Your Enthusiasm. Blumenfeld has compared the NBC series The Office and Parks and Recreation to Jake and Amir, saying they [...] "have these office workplace dynamics and the situations are funny and the characters are very funny".|$|E

500|$|<b>His</b> <b>humor</b> {{caused him}} trouble {{during his time}} in Washington. He was known to greet {{citizens}} walking by his office on the White House tour by saying to them, [...] "If you look on me as a wild animal, be kind enough to throw peanuts at me". This prompted Wilson to move Marshall's office to the Senate Office building, where {{he would not be}} disturbed by visitors. In response to a proposal to the board of the Smithsonian Institution to send a team to excavate for ruins in Guatemala, Marshall suggested that the team instead excavate around Washington. When asked why, he replied that, judging by the looks of the people walking on the street, {{they should be able to}} find buried cave-men no more than six feet down. The joke was not well received, and he was shut out of board meetings for nearly a year.|$|E
500|$|The couple {{viewed the}} Loew's State {{engagement}} in 1937 as Skelton's big chance. They hired New York comedy writers to prepare {{material for the}} engagement, believing they needed more sophisticated jokes and skits than the routines Skelton normally performed. However, his New York audience did not laugh or applaud until Skelton abandoned the newly written material and began performing the [...] "Doughnut Dunkers" [...] and his older routines. The doughnut-dunking routine also helped Skelton rise to celebrity status. In 1937, while he was entertaining at the Capitol Theater in Washington, D.C., President Franklin D. Roosevelt invited Skelton to perform at a White House luncheon. During one of the official toasts, Skelton grabbed Roosevelt's glass, saying, [...] "Careful what you drink, Mr. President. [...] I got rolled {{in a place like}} this once." [...] <b>His</b> <b>humor</b> appealed to FDR and Skelton became the master of ceremonies for Roosevelt's official birthday celebration for many years afterward.|$|E
500|$|The show {{received}} a mixed reception from media publications. Some media outlets were {{more critical of}} the show and Rock's performance as host. USA Today television critic Robert Bianco wrote, [...] "Loud, snide and dismissive, he wasn't just a disappointment; he ranks {{up there with the}} worst hosts ever." [...] He also called the decision to have several nominees of several technical categories stand on stage embarrassing and disrespectful. Columnist Robert. P. Lawrence of the San Diego Union Tribune commented, [...] "It was a frustratingly average, three-hour-12-minute exhibition of mutual admiration in the inimitable Hollywood style." [...] He later said that despite Rock's edgy and provocative opening, <b>his</b> <b>humor</b> and energy diminished as the night wore on. Vince Horiuchi of The Salt Lake Tribune wrote of Rock's [...] performance, [...] "He was bound by stale jokes (none of the winners [...] "tested positive for steroids"), a rigid opening monologue (he didn't even make reference to his prior controversial comments about the Oscars), and tired comedy bits (Rock playing like Catherine Zeta-Jones with Adam Sandler)." [...] In addition, he also described the cast and production of the ceremony as [...] "moribund" [...] and [...] "clumsy." ...|$|E

500|$|Welles {{considered}} Falstaff to be [...] "Shakespeare's greatest creation" [...] {{and said}} that the role was [...] "the most difficult part I've ever played." [...] Keith Baxter believed that making the film was Welles's life's ambition. Before the 1939 Boston premiere of Five Kings, Welles told journalists [...] "I will play him as a tragic figure. I hope, of course, he will be funny to the audience, just as he was funny to those around him. But <b>his</b> <b>humor</b> and wit were aroused merely {{by the fact that he}} wanted to please the prince. Falstaff, however, had the potential of greatness in him." [...] Reviews for the 1939 play mention Welles' choice to downplay the traditional comedic elements of Falstaff in his performance. This reverence for the character increased over the years and by the time Welles made Chimes at Midnight, his focus was entirely on the relationships between Falstaff, Hal and Henry IV. He believed that the core of the story was [...] "the betrayal of friendship." [...] Welles called Hal's rejection of Falstaff [...] "one of the greatest scenes ever written, so the movie is really a preparation for it. Everything prepares for it." [...] Throughout the film, Hal constantly turns his back on Falstaff, foreshadowing the film's ending.|$|E
500|$|Although {{none of his}} {{features}} display graphic sex scenes, sexuality in Kubrick's films is usually depicted outside matrimonial relationships in hostile situations. Baxter states that Kubrick explores the [...] "furtive and violent side alleys of the sexual experience: voyeurism, domination, bondage and rape" [...] in his films. He further points out that films like A Clockwork Orange are [...] "powerfully homoerotic", from Alex walking about his parents' flat in his Y-fronts, one eye being [...] "made up with doll-like false eyelashes", to his innocent acceptance of the sexual advances of his post-corrective adviser Deltroid (Aubrey Morris). British critic Adrian Turner notes that Kubrick's films appear to be [...] "preoccupied with questions of universal and inherited evil", and Malcolm McDowell referred to <b>his</b> <b>humor</b> as [...] "black as coal", questioning his outlook on humanity. Although {{a few of his}} pictures were obvious satires and black comedies, such as Lolita and Dr. Strangelove, many of his other films also contained less visible elements of satire or irony. His films are unpredictable, examining [...] "the duality and contradictions that exist in all of us". Ciment notes how Kubrick often tried to confound audience expectations by establishing radically different moods from one film to the next, remarking that he was almost [...] "obsessed with contradicting himself, with making each work a critique of the previous one".|$|E
500|$|Mr. Dooley {{would become}} known for <b>his</b> <b>humor,</b> which {{was present in}} many of the Bridgeport columns, but the Pullman pieces were not the only ones to be serious. One had the {{drunkard}} Grady's little girl come shivering to Dooley's door on a winter's night with a can to be filled with beer for her father. Dooley accompanies her home, and tries to beat some decency into the sodden Grady. Another, with Dooley's recollections of a long-ago Christmas in Roscommon, caused Dunne to be brought to tears by his own writing. In another, Dooley joins with Father Kelly, the parish priest, in getting relief for [...] "the man Carey down the street that nobody likes, him being a notorious infidel". Dooley and the priest gather provisions for the atheist, later getting him a job, and endure his speech against the Bible until Kelly cuts him off, [...] "What talk have ye? Go an' starve no more." [...] Although he applauded such acts of individual charity, Dunne through Dooley denigrated charitable organizations, wondering that [...] "a man can square himself with his conscience by giving one thousand dollars to a policeman and telling him to distribute it! Why don't they get the poor up in a cage in Lincoln Park and hand them food {{on the end of a}} window pole, if they're afraid they'll bite" ...|$|E

5000|$|Tosh's Comedy Central {{television}} show Tosh.0 premiered on June 5, 2009, based on showcasing Internet video clips. <b>His</b> mocking <b>humor</b> {{is described as}} [...] "envelope pushing" [...] and frequently features punchlines which are intentionally self-deprecating, racist, sexist, or homophobic. Tosh's explanation of <b>his</b> non-politically correct <b>humor</b> is [...] "I'm not a misogynistic and racist person...But I do find those jokes funny, so I say them." ...|$|R
