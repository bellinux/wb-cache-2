40|$|Fraud {{is always}} a concern when an insurer issues a policy to an assured. An assured can take out {{numerous}} policies and claim indemnity under all the policies, which {{would result in the}} assured receiving more than he is entitled to. Is the fear of fraud justifiable and are such exclusions or limitations in insurance contracts preventing recovery where there is other insurance effective? Further, is there sufficient protection for insurers by way of contribution from other insurers. It is beneficial to look at the history and development of the law of insurance, to understand how the law relating to <b>double</b> <b>insurance</b> has developed and the factors the courts may take into account when deciding such issues. The courts in many jurisdictions have tried to deal with the problems which have arisen as a result of such clauses. The courts have also dealt with {{the question of whether the}} assured is or should be given any protection when <b>double</b> <b>insurance</b> arises, and if so, whether the insurer has to pay out under the <b>insurance</b> <b>policy.</b> However, where there are rateable proportion clauses with other types of clauses, the solution is not that clear. It is quite common for judges, when dealing with such cases, to conclude that the case before it is not a case of <b>double</b> <b>insurance.</b> In some cases, even though the trial judge may hold that the case before him, on the facts, were sufficient to give rise to <b>double</b> <b>insurance,</b> on appeal, the appeal courts have come to the conclusion that the facts of the case do not give rise to one of <b>double</b> <b>insurance.</b> This clearly shows what a difficult concept <b>double</b> <b>insurance</b> is. This has resulted in the courts not actually being able, even till now, to provide any real solid rules or guidelines on <b>double</b> <b>insurance.</b> Further, even though an assured has taken out insurance with numerous insurers he will not be able to recover more than the loss he has actually suffered. This is the general principle of indemnity. The next problem for an assured is then, from which insurer the assured can seek recovery from. Is there a particular order when seeking recovery or can he recover from whichever insurer he chooses? At the moment, the law on this is also unclear. <br/...|$|R

40|$|<b>Insurance</b> <b>policies</b> are {{traditionally}} classified as unilateral or “reverse-unilateral” contracts, a characterization we find largely incorrect, with problematic consequences for adjudication of insurance coverage disputes. In {{addition to the}} general difficulties attending the unilateral classification, the concept as applied to <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> is not only unhelpful but incorrect. <b>Insurance</b> <b>policies</b> are more accurately viewed as bilateral contracts. In addition, the unilateral characterization of <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> introduces error and inconsistency into the litigation of insurance controversies. In particular, the unilateral view tends toward excessive formalism and focus on so-called “conditions” precedent to coverage, eschewing material breach analysis and encouraging needless forfeitures as well as unwisely removing the concept of anticipatory repudiation and corresponding remedy from insurance law. Categorizing <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> as unilateral fails to appreciate the ongoing, iterative nature of <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> and the insurer-policyholder relationship. Recognizing the bilateral nature of <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> holds substantial potential for improving insurance coverage adjudication...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (LL. M. (Estate Law)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. The {{treatment}} of life <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> in deceased estates {{and the effect}} thereof on marriages in community of property {{is the cause of}} various problems for executors. In terms of section 3 (3) of the Estate Duty Act 45 of 1955 life <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> are deemed to be assets of the deceased. Consequently life <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> are reflected in the estate duty addendum of the deceased estate. Life <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> however are not always reflected in the liquidation account of the deceased estate as assets, notwithstanding the fact that life <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> are deemed to be assets for estate duty purposes. In this regard a distinction should be made between two situations: firstly where life <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> are reflected in the liquidation account of the insured estate and secondly where life <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> are not reflected in the liquidation account of the insured. For spouses married in community of property this creates a problem especially when you keep in mind that life <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> are in many instances a person's biggest monetary asset. When life <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> are reflected in the liquidation account of the insured, the surviving spouse has a claim on half of the policy proceeds. When life <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> are not reflected in the liquidation account of the insured, the surviving spouse has no claim on the policy proceeds. The problem that arises in this regard {{is that there is no}} certainty as to what extent life <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> should be included in the calculation of estate duty, and how these policies must be reflected in the estate of the deceased. This uncertainty has been perpetuated by courts. This research will illustrate how the courts came to different conclusions where the facts were more or less similar. Master...|$|R

40|$|Many {{insurance}} law commentators believe that judges should regulate {{the substance of}} <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> by refusing to enforce <b>insurance</b> <b>policy</b> terms that are exploitive or otherwise unfair. The most common guide for the judicial regulation of <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> is the 2 ̆ 2 reasonable expectations doctrine, 2 ̆ 2 which requires courts to disregard coverage restrictions that are beyond insureds 2 ̆ 7 reasonable expectations unless the insurer specifically informed the insured about the restriction {{at the time of}} purchase. This Article argues that although the judiciary has a potential role to play in policing <b>insurance</b> <b>policy</b> terms, that role should not be defined by reference to consumers 2 ̆ 7 reasonable expectations. Instead, by drawing on the parallels between <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> and ordinary consumer products, this Article advances a products liability framework for understanding how and why courts should regulate <b>insurance</b> <b>policies.</b> It proposes that, just as firms that make defective products must pay for the resulting injuries, insurers that issue 2 ̆ 2 defective 2 ̆ 2 <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> should have to provide coverage to insureds. The Article argues that the usefulness of the analogy to products liability law goes well beyond understanding the normative basis for the judicial regulation of <b>insurance</b> <b>policies.</b> Products liability law offers important insights into how courts can efficiently correct failures in insurance markets by encouraging effective disclosure to consumers and appropriately setting penalties so that insurers take an optimal amount of care in drafting policy terms...|$|R

40|$|<b>Insurance</b> <b>policies</b> are {{classified}} as a species of contract. Although this characterization is correct, it is unduly narrow if used as the exclusive lens for assessing <b>insurance</b> <b>policies,</b> which are not merely contracts but also are designed to perform particular risk management, deterrence, and compensation functions important to economic and social ordering. Recognizing this has significant implications regarding {{the manner in which}} <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> are construed in coverage disputes and suggests that policy construction can be improved by not only performing traditional contract analysis of disputed policies but also by appreciating the particular function of the <b>insurance</b> <b>policy</b> in question as part of the insurance product’s larger role as a social and economic instrument or institution. This insight is in some tension with the predominately text-centered approach to <b>insurance</b> <b>policy</b> construction and suggests that much of the contract-based resolution of <b>insurance</b> <b>policy</b> disputes is based on an unduly crabbed view of contract law as well as an impoverished view {{of the degree to which}} the <b>insurance</b> <b>policy</b> is not only a contract and not only a product or a type of private legislation but also part of a web of socioeconomic organization that attempts to manage risk in prudent ways.

40|$|Abstract – The global {{insurance}} industry provides investment and supportive insurance services such as: motor/vehicle, fire, home, personal accident, product liability, public liability and professional indemnity. These services are very beneficial to private individuals and companies and critically {{depend on the}} actual factors and risks involved in the <b>insurance</b> <b>policy.</b> There are risks involved in taking up or embarking on <b>insurance</b> <b>policies.</b> To analyse all the factors involved in providing insurance to individual or companies is a difficult and time consuming job. Through a design-based research approach, this paper therefore proposes an Underwriting Expert System Advisor (UESA) that allows a less experienced individual judge a particular <b>insurance</b> <b>policy</b> before endorsement. The proposed UESA helps an individual calculate all factors and risks involved in taking on a particular <b>insurance</b> <b>policy</b> and advices which policy is best to be chosen in accordance to the individual’s interests and finance ability.
