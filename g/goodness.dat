5|$|Gregory {{was one of}} {{the first}} theologians to argue, in {{opposition}} to Origen, that God is infinite. His main argument for the infinity of God, which can be found in Against Eunomius, is that God's <b>goodness</b> is limitless, and as God's <b>goodness</b> is essential, God is also limitless.|$|E
5|$|By the 19th century, {{emphasis}} on the negative aspects of Cynic philosophy led to the modern understanding of cynicism to mean a disposition of disbelief in the sincerity or <b>goodness</b> of human motives and actions.|$|E
5|$|In {{no part of}} {{the animal}} {{creation}} are the wisdom, the <b>goodness,</b> and the bounty of Providence displayed in a more lively manner than in the structure, formation, and various endowments of the feathered tribes.|$|E
5|$|The medieval {{doctrine}} of divine simplicity also poses problems for religious language. This suggests that God has no accidental properties– these are properties that a being can have {{which do not}} contribute to its essence. If God has no accidental properties, he cannot be as he is traditionally conceived, because properties such as <b>goodness</b> are accidental. If divine simplicity is accepted, then to describe God as good would entail that <b>goodness</b> and God have the same definition. Such limits can also be problematic to religious believers; for example, the Bible regularly ascribes different emotions to God, ascriptions which would be implausible according to the {{doctrine of}} divine simplicity.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Aquinas {{argued that}} {{statements}} about God are analogous to human experience. An analogous term is partly univocal (has only one meaning) and partly equivocal (has {{more than one}} potential meaning) because an analogy {{is in some ways}} the same and in some ways different from the subject. He proposed that those godly qualities which resemble human qualities are described analogously, with reference to human terms; for example, when God is described as good, {{it does not mean that}} God is good in human terms, but that human <b>goodness</b> is used as a reference to describe God's <b>goodness.</b>|$|E
5|$|Thomas Aquinas, a thirteenth-century {{scholastic}} {{philosopher and}} theologian {{heavily influenced by}} Augustine, proposed a form of the Augustinian theodicy in his Summa Theologica. Aquinas began by attempting to establish the existence of God, through his Five Ways, and then attested that God is good and must have a morally sufficient reason for allowing evil to exist. Aquinas proposed that all <b>goodness</b> in the world must exist perfectly in God, and that, existing perfectly, God must be perfectly good. He concluded that God is <b>goodness,</b> {{and that there is}} no evil in God.|$|E
5|$|At the Luthor Mansion, Tess Mercer (Cassidy Freeman) {{is confronted}} by Granny <b>Goodness,</b> who offers her one final chance to join Darkseid's forces to spare her life during the coming destruction. Tess refuses, declaring that, {{just because she}} was born a Luthor, her fate is not sealed. At Watchtower, {{discovering}} that Oliver Queen (Justin Hartley) disabled the organization's satellites, Tess brings up previous satellite footage revealing the planet Apokolips descending toward Earth. Before Tess can warn the team, she is ambushed {{by a group of}} armed men and taken captive. Granny <b>Goodness,</b> Desaad, and Gordon Godfrey meet in their lair. Oliver—possessed by the power of Darkseid—arrives and is instructed to remove Clark's powers with a gold kryptonite wedding ring. At the wedding, Chloe realizes the ring is kryptonite and stops Oliver. Clark helps Oliver overcome Darkseid's control just as Apokolips enters Earth's atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Because {{evolutionary}} naturalism proposes {{an empirical}} account of morality, {{it does not}} require morality to exist objectively; Linville considers the view that this will lead to moral scepticism or antirealism. C. S. Lewis argued that, if evolutionary naturalism is accepted, human morality cannot be described as absolute and objective because moral statements cannot be right or wrong. Despite this, Lewis argued, those who accept evolutionary naturalism still act as if objective moral truths exist, leading Lewis to reject naturalism as incoherent. As an alternative ethical theory, Lewis offered a form of divine command theory which equated God with <b>goodness</b> and treated <b>goodness</b> as an essential part of reality, thus asserting God's existence.|$|E
5|$|God {{in whose}} hands are {{the hearts of}} Kings, who art the consoler of the humble and the {{protector}} of all who hope in thee, grant to our Queen Elizabeth and to the Christian people to celebrate wisely the triumph of thy <b>goodness</b> {{so that they may}} be always renewed to glory through thee, through Jesus Christ our Lord.|$|E
5|$|In battle, Marko used {{not only}} his {{strength}} and prowess but cunning and trickery. Despite his extraordinary qualities he was not depicted as a superhero or a god, but as a mortal man. There were opponents who surpassed him in courage and strength. He was occasionally capricious, short-tempered or cruel, but his predominant traits were honesty, loyalty and fundamental <b>goodness.</b>|$|E
5|$|Men {{are like}} plants: the <b>goodness</b> and flavour {{of the fruit}} {{proceeds}} from the peculiar soil and exposition in which they grow. We are nothing but what we derive from the air we breathe, the climate we inhabit, the government we obey, the system of religion we profess, {{and the nature of}} our employment.|$|E
5|$|Paley {{concludes that}} natural {{theology}} offers many proofs of the <b>goodness</b> of God, though any {{one would be}} sufficient. The many proofs show that the conclusion is stable, and together {{they can make a}} suitable impression on those who study them.|$|E
5|$|Religious {{language}} is a philosophical problem arising from the difficulties in accurately describing God. Because God is generally conceived as incorporeal, infinite, and timeless, ordinary language cannot always apply to that entity. This makes speaking about or attributing properties to God difficult: a religious believer might simultaneously wish to describe God as good, yet also hold that God's <b>goodness</b> is unique and cannot be articulated by human language of <b>goodness.</b> This raises {{the problem of how}} (and whether) God can be meaningfully spoken about at all, which causes problems for religious belief since the ability to describe and talk about God is important in religious life. The French philosopher Simone Weil expressed this problem in her work Waiting for God, in which she outlined her dilemma: she was simultaneously certain of God's love and conscious that she could not adequately describe him.|$|E
5|$|The {{book was}} written {{in the context of the}} natural {{theology}} tradition. In earlier centuries, theologians such as John Ray and William Derham, as well as philosophers of classical times such as Cicero, argued for the existence and <b>goodness</b> of God from the general well-being of living things and the physical world.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} {{colors of}} the University of Houston are scarlet red and albino white. These were the colors of Sam Houston's ancestor, Sir Hugh, and were adopted by UH {{at the same time}} as the official seal. Scarlet red symbolizes courage or inner strength to face the unknown, and white symbolizes the <b>goodness</b> and purity of spirit embodied in helping one's fellow man.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{its history}} Goofus and Gallant has been {{interpreted}} as an effective didactic comic. It {{has been used in}} several studies as a stimulus to prompt children to identify kind and unkind actions, and the characters of Goofus and Gallant, as archetypes of badness and <b>goodness,</b> have been referenced in several works by philosophers.|$|E
5|$|Aquinas {{supported}} Augustine's {{view that}} evil is a privation of <b>goodness,</b> maintaining that evil has existence as a privation intrinsically found in good. The {{existence of this}} evil, Aquinas believed, can be completely explained by free will. Faced with the assertion that humans {{would have been better}} off without free will, he argued that the possibility of sin is necessary for a perfect world, and so individuals are responsible for their sin. Good is the cause of evil, but only owing to fault on the part of the agent. In his theodicy, to say something is evil is to say that it lacks <b>goodness</b> which means that it could not be part of God's creation, because God's creation lacked nothing. Aquinas noted that, although <b>goodness</b> makes evil possible, it does not necessitate evil. This means that God (who is good) is not cast as the cause of evil, because evil arises out of a defect in an agent, and God is seen to be without defect. Philosopher Eleonore Stump, considering Aquinas' commentary on the Book of Job, argues that Aquinas has a positive view of suffering: it is necessary to contrast Earth with heaven and remind humans that they still have the propensity to commit evil. Aquinas believed that evil is acceptable because of the good that comes from it, and that evil can only be justified when it is required in order for good to occur. Attempting to relieve God of responsibility for the occurrence of evil, Aquinas insisted that God merely permits evil to happen, rather than willing it. He recognised the occurrence of what seems to be evil, but did not attribute to it the same level of existence that he attributed to spirituality. Like Augustine, Aquinas asserted that humans bear responsibility for evil owing to their abuse of free will.|$|E
5|$|Being {{exceedingly}} {{alarmed at}} the misery into which I had fallen, {{and much more}} at that which threatened me in view of eternal death, I, duty bound, made it my first business to betake myself to your way, condemning my past life, not without groans and tears. And now, O Lord, what remains to a wretch like me, but instead of defence, earnestly to supplicate you not to judge that fearful abandonment of your Word according to its deserts, from which in your wondrous <b>goodness</b> you have at last delivered me.|$|E
5|$|Maurice's natural <b>goodness</b> never wavers in the story. Unlike Shelley's Frankenstein, which {{suggests}} that environment determines a person's morality, Maurice assumes that people can be innately good. Maurice even forgives Dame Smithson, who stole him from his nurse. The story aims to generate sympathy in its readers. In contrast with other children's stories of its day, it lacks didacticism and draws no clear distinctions between virtue and vice.|$|E
5|$|Original Stories from Real Life; with Conversations Calculated to Regulate the Affections, and Form the Mind to Truth and <b>Goodness</b> is {{the only}} {{complete}} work of children's literature by the 18th-century English feminist author Mary Wollstonecraft. Original Stories begins with a frame story that sketches out the education of two young girls by their maternal teacher Mrs. Mason, followed {{by a series of}} didactic tales. The book was first published by Joseph Johnson in 1788; a second, illustrated edition, with engravings by William Blake, was released in 1791 and remained in print for around a quarter of a century.|$|E
5|$|The play also {{features}} an ambiguous and multifaceted portrayal of scientific knowledge, celebrating it for its humanistic achievements and discoveries, but also warning {{that it can}} do immense harm when {{in the hands of}} the unethical or overambitious. Given these themes, the play is likely Verne's most purely science-fictional work. Structurally, the play evokes the three-part design of Jacques Offenbach's opera The Tales of Hoffmann, in which the hero must choose between love and art. In Journey Through the Impossible, however, the choice is between positive ideals—love, <b>goodness,</b> happiness—and the unbounded scientific ambitions of the sinister Doctor Ox.|$|E
5|$|The seven {{chapters}} of the book cover the origins {{and implementation of the}} school, and other topics in childrearing. Summerhill, founded in the 1920s, is run as a children's democracy under Neill's educational philosophy of self-regulation, where kids choose whether to go to lessons and how they want to live freely without imposing on others. The school makes its rules at a weekly schoolwide meeting where students and teachers each have one vote alike. Neill discarded other pedagogies for one of the innate <b>goodness</b> of the child.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of 1999, Weezer had once again gone their separate ways. Drummer Patrick Wilson resumed his efforts with his side-band The Special <b>Goodness,</b> guitarist Bell worked on his band Space Twins and Welsh toured with Juliana Hatfield. Meanwhile, Cuomo focused his energy on songwriting, crafting 121 songs, nearly half of which would become demos. During this time, he isolated himself and abstained from {{contact with the outside}} world. Cuomo also received braces on his teeth, further damaging his self-esteem. Bell would occasionally visit Cuomo and play songs with him. In turn, Cuomo would eventually reveal songs he was working on to Bell.|$|E
5|$|During the Early Middle Ages, Greek {{classical}} {{learning was}} all but lost to the West. However, contact with the Islamic world, where Greek manuscripts were preserved and expanded, soon led to a massive spate of Latin translations in the 12th century. Europeans were re-introduced to the works of Plato and Aristotle, {{as well as to}} Islamic thought. Christian thinkers of the scholastic school, in particular Peter Abelard (1079 – 1142) and Thomas Aquinas (1225 – 1274), combined Aristotelian classification with Plato's ideas of the <b>goodness</b> of God, and of all potential life forms being present in a perfect creation, to organize all inanimate, animate, and spiritual beings into a huge interconnected system: the scala naturae, or great chain of being.|$|E
5|$|In 1993 the {{evolutionary}} biologist Stephen Jay Gould compared Paley to Voltaire's Doctor Pangloss, {{the man who}} could argue any case (however hopeless). Gould is struck that Paley can claim that even the agonising pain of gallstones or gout could indicate the <b>goodness</b> of a loving God, with the justification that it felt so good when the pain stopped. Gould makes it clear he finds Paley's argument incorrect scientifically, but states that he respects it as a coherent and well-defended philosophy. Gould particularly respects Paley's method of identifying alternative possibilities and then systematically refuting them. Gould notes that Paley envisages a Lamarckist kind of evolution and rebuts it with the observation that men have not lost their nipples through disuse. However, Gould writes, Paley did not manage to think of one more alternative, natural selection, which has no purpose at all but just kills off whatever works less well in every generation.|$|E
5|$|Many {{years prior}} to the game's events, the world was {{controlled}} by King , who ruled the kingdom bearing his name. Originally a kind man, a spell to bring his people prosperity drained his <b>goodness,</b> causing him to turn into a vicious dictator who declared war on the rest of Erion. During his conquests, the Cauldron went wild and destroyed the kingdom in a single night — everyone was cursed and transformed into Pookas, while Valentine's kingdom was reduced to a wasteland. In the aftermath of Valentine's fall, Ragnanival and Ringford had become Erion's most powerful nations, while the other nations have become weak in comparison. At the game's opening, Ragnanival and Ringford are at war over the possession of the Cauldron in the wasteland of Valentine, as each see the Cauldron as too dangerous for the other to possess.|$|E
5|$|Merit is {{connected}} with the notions of purity and <b>goodness.</b> Before Buddhism, merit was used with regard to ancestor worship, but in Buddhism it gained a more general ethical meaning. Merit is a force that results from good deeds done; {{it is capable of}} attracting good circumstances in a person's life, as well as improving the person's mind and inner well-being. Moreover, it affects the next lives to come, as well as the destination a person is reborn. The opposite of merit is demerit (papa), and it is believed that merit is able to weaken demerit. Indeed, merit has even been connected to the path to Nirvana itself, but many scholars say that this refers only to some types of merit.|$|E
5|$|Shaw {{made his}} Broadway debut in 1929, {{when he played}} the murderer Wyndham Brandon in Patrick Hamilton's stage thriller, Rope's End. In 1929, he married Margaret Delamere and lived {{with her in the}} Albany, an {{apartment}} complex off of Piccadilly in London. The two would eventually have a daughter together named Drusilla (born 1932). He returned to the works of William Shakespeare in 1931, playing Claudio in Measure for Measure at London's Fortune Playhouse. In 1932 he once again played Romeo at the Embassy Theatre. Other works around this period included productions of Ivor Novello's Sunshine Sisters in 1933, Double Door alongside actress Sybil Thorndike in 1934, J.M. Barrie's A Kiss for Cinderella in 1937, and Robert Morley's <b>Goodness,</b> How Sad in 1938.|$|E
5|$|Tan {{and four}} blind friends auditioned for the inaugural season of Project SuperStar, but only he was {{accepted}} as a contestant. Throughout the competition, there was extensive debate over whether viewers were voting for him out of sympathy and whether a blind man who could not dance deserved the title. Further controversy arose when his home address was posted online and fans offered him sex services. Nevertheless, he emerged as the male champion and entered the grand final against female champion Kelly Poon. The judges gave Poon more favourable reviews, but Tan garnered 64% of the 533,000 telephone votes. Both finalists also released limited edition singles; Tan's cover of 童话 (Fairytale) by Michael Wong sold 12,239 copies, while Poon's cover of 遗失的美好 (Lost <b>Goodness)</b> by Angela Chang sold 11,319 copies. Thus Tan became the grand champion and was awarded a recording contract with Play Music (later acquired by Warner Music).|$|E
5|$|The fifth book {{returns to}} the subject of faith. Clement argues that truth, justice and <b>goodness</b> can be seen only by the mind, not the eye; faith is a way of {{accessing}} the unseeable. He stresses that knowledge of God can only be achieved through faith once one's moral faults have been corrected. This parallels Clement's earlier insistence that martyrdom can only be achieved by those who practice their faith in Christ through good deeds, not those who simply profess their faith. God transcends matter entirely, and thus the materialist cannot truly come to know God. Although Christ was God incarnate, it is our spiritual, not physical comprehension of him which is important.|$|E
5|$|Under the synthesis, debates {{have become}} less ideological and more methodological. Business cycle modelers {{can be broken}} into two camps: those in favor of {{calibration}} and those in favor of estimation. When models are calibrated, the modeler selects parameter values based on other studies or casual empirical observation. Instead of using statistical diagnostics to evaluate models, the model's operating characteristics determine {{the quality of the}} model. Kydland and Prescott (1982) offered no formal evaluation of their model, but noted how variables like hours worked did not match real data well while the variances of other elements of the model did. When estimation methods are used, models are evaluated based on standard statistical <b>goodness</b> of fit criteria. Calibration is generally associated with real business cycle modelers of the new classical school, but methodological differences cut across ideology. While Lucas, Prescott, and Kydland are calibration advocates, another prominent new classical, Sargent, favors estimation.|$|E
5|$|Verses 4.26–35 {{state that}} the human body has {{fourteen}} nadis (blood vessels), of which three are primary. Sushumna (Sanskrit: सुषुम्णा) is the most important, as it extends all along the spinal cord and reaches into the head, sustaining the whole body. Vishnu is the deity whose power propels Sushumna according to verse 4.31. On {{both sides of the}} Sushumna reside the Ida and Pingala vessels, the former connected to the moon and the latter to the sun. These three drive the three Guṇas (forces behind the innate character) of a being, with Sushumna driving Sattva (<b>goodness),</b> Pingala driving the Rajas (action), and Ida driving the Tamas (destructiveness). These primary vessels are connected to numerous channels inside the human body, which pervade the whole body, and nourish it.|$|E
25|$|Aquinas argued from degree, {{considering}} {{the occurrence of}} degrees of <b>goodness.</b> He believed that things which are called good, must be called good {{in relation to a}} standard of good—a maximum. There must be a maximum <b>goodness</b> that which causes all <b>goodness.</b>|$|E
25|$|Patrick Wilson {{started his}} side-project The Special <b>Goodness</b> in 1996, {{for which he}} sings and plays guitar and bass. In May 2012, he {{released}} his fourth record with The Special <b>Goodness,</b> entitled Natural.|$|E
25|$|Aquinas {{responds}} {{to the problem of}} evil by saying that God allows evil to exist that good may come of it, (for <b>goodness</b> done out of free will is superior than <b>goodness</b> done from biological imperative) but does not personally cause evil Himself.|$|E
25|$|I find {{so much of}} <b>goodness</b> still.|$|E
