[...] They were also active in seeking the vote: in 1913 a delegation of them arrived at the legislature demanding the vote; Sifton asked them [...] "did you ladies wash up your luncheon dishes before you came down here to ask me for the vote? [...] If you haven't you'd better go home because you're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>any</b> votes from me." [...] In October 1914 another delegation arrived, bearing the signatures of 40,000 people. [...] At that time, the Premier agreed that most traditional objections to extension of the franchise were [...] "played out", but expressed concern at the increases that would result {{to the cost of}} elections and uncertainty at whether most of the province's women actually wanted suffrage. [...] In February 1915 a larger delegation arrived at the legislature and occupied the MLAs' seats, demanding that the franchise be extended quickly enough to allow women to vote in the upcoming prohibition referendum; an angry Sifton refused and suggested to the women that if they wanted the vote, they should contact their MLAs and promise that they would use their votes to re-elect them, [...] "which is after all one of the strongest way in which you can appeal to male human nature, as represented in the legislature." [...] Even so, he committed to raising the issue in the legislature after the referendum. [...] On September 17, 1915, he told UFA President James Speakman that he had given instructions for the preparation of a statute [...] "placing men and women in Alberta on the basis of absolute equality so far as Provincial matters are concerned." [...] True to his word, he introduced legislation in the spring of 1916 giving women the vote in all provincial and municipal elections. [...] The Conservatives supported it enthusiastically, and only St. Albert MLA Lucien Boudreau voted against it (though Ribstone Liberal James Gray Turgeon admitted that he was supporting his leader's legislation against his own convictions).|$|E

5000|$|Following {{the release}} of Unity 5, Unity Technologies drew some {{criticism}} for the high volume of quickly produced games published on the Steam distribution platform by inexperienced developers. CEO John Riccitiello {{said in an interview}} that he believes this to be a side-effect of Unity's success in democratizing game development: [...] "If I had my way, I'd like to see 50 million people using Unity - although I don't think we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> there <b>any</b> time soon. I'd like to see high school and college kids using it, people outside the core industry. I think it's sad that most people are consumers of technology and not creators. The world's a better place when people know how to create, not just consume, and that's what we're trying to promote." ...|$|R

2500|$|The Labour Party {{strongly}} opposed the rearmament programme. Clement Attlee said on 21 December 1933: [...] "For our part, we are unalterably opposed to {{anything in the}} nature of rearmament". On 8 March 1934 Attlee said, after Baldwin defended the Air Estimates, [...] "we on our side are out for total disarmament". On 30 July 1934 Labour moved a motion of censure against the government because of its planned expansion of the RAF. Attlee spoke for it: [...] "We deny the need for increased air arms...and we reject altogether the claim of parity". Sir Stafford Cripps also said on this occasion that it was fallacy that Britain could achieve security through increasing air armaments. On 22 May 1935, the day after Hitler had made a speech claiming that German rearmament offered no threat to peace, Attlee asserted that Hitler's speech gave [...] "a chance to call a halt in the armaments race". Attlee also denounced the Defence White Paper of 1937: [...] "I do not believe the Government are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>any</b> safety through these armaments".|$|E

40|$|Americans are profoundly {{divided over}} {{same-sex}} marriage. The regional divide was strikingly {{evident in the}} 2004 elections, where voters in twelve states approved referenda banning such unions, while in Vermont and Massachusetts, two states in which same-sex unions are recognized, the prorecognition factions increased their numbers. (Same-sex unions that are legally equivalent to marriage are also recognized in California and Connecticut.) Each side is now striving for total victory. Proponents of same-sex marriage want a judicial declaration, preferably by the United States Supreme Court, that same-sex marriage is constitutionally required. Opponents want a constitutional amendment banning any state from recognizing such marriage. Neither side is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> its way <b>any</b> time in the foreseeable future. As the recent election results show, Americans bring radically differing values to this question {{in different parts of}} the country. We are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be divided on this issue for a long time. What we need is a way to live together...|$|R
60|$|Lemuel {{said that}} he had never seen Sibyl or Miss Vane since; but he did not make any direct {{response}} to the anxieties his mother had hinted at. Her pride in him, so ignorant of all the reality of his life in the city, crushed him more than the sight and renewed sense of the mean conditions from which he had sprung. What if he should tell her that Miss Carver, whom she did not want him to marry in a hurry, regarded him as a servant, and treated him as she would treat a black man? What if she knew that he was as good as engaged to marry a girl that could no more meet Miss Carver on the same level than she could fly? He could only tell his mother not to feel troubled about him; that he was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> married in <b>any</b> great hurry; and pretend to be sleepy and turn his head away.|$|R
60|$|But {{by and by}} pap got too handy {{with his}} hick'ry, and I couldn't stand it. I was all over welts. He got <b>to</b> <b>going</b> away so much, too, and locking me in. Once he locked me in and was gone three days. It was dreadful lonesome. I judged he had got drownded, and I wasn't ever <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out <b>any</b> more. I was scared. I {{made up my mind}} I would fix up some way to leave there. I had tried <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out of that cabin many a time, but I couldn't find no way. There warn't a window to it big enough for a dog <b>to</b> <b>get</b> through. I couldn't get up the chimbly; it was too narrow. The door was thick, solid oak slabs. Pap was pretty careful not to leave a knife or {{anything}} in the cabin when he was away; I reckon I had hunted the place over as much as a hundred times; well, I was most all the time at it, because it was about the only way to put in the time. But this time I found something at last; I found an old rusty wood-saw without any handle; it was laid in between a rafter and the clapboards of the roof. I greased it up and went to work. There was an old horse-blanket nailed against the logs {{at the far end of}} the cabin behind the table, to keep the wind from blowing through the chinks and putting the candle out. I got under the table and raised the blanket, and went to work to saw a section of the big bottom log out--big enough to let me through. Well, it was a good long job, but I was getting towards the end of it when I heard pap's gun in the woods. I got rid of the signs of my work, and dropped the blanket and hid my saw, and pretty soon pap come in.|$|R
