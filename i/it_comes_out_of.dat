2500|$|... "We {{look upon}} {{authority}} too often and focus {{over and over}} again, for 30 or 40 or 50 years, {{as if there is}} something wrong with authority. We see only the oppressive side of authority. Maybe <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> our history and our background. What we don't see is that freedom is not a concept in which people can do anything they want, be anything they can be. Freedom is about authority. Freedom is about the willingness of every single human being to cede to lawful authority a great deal of discretion about what you do. [...] You have free speech so I can be heard."

60|$|They are terribly {{anxious for}} the villain {{to get his}} bullet, and that I take to be a humane and proper sentiment. They spend freely the ten cents that is not saved without a struggle. <b>It</b> <b>comes</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the candy money, and the money that goes for {{chewing-gum}} and other necessaries of life. They make the sacrifice freely. This is the only school which they are sorry to leave.|$|E

This makes the whole river turbid again after the waters of the two rivers have flowed long enough together to get well mixed, and then it continues turbid {{all the way to the}} sea.

60|$|This is {{an awfully}} queer, old-fashioned town, {{and must have}} been a good deal like Bath in the days of Evelina.

If mining should cease now, the supply of rock spread over those fields would furnish the usual 8,000 car-loads per day to the {{separating}} works during three years. The fields are fenced and watched; and at night they are under the constant inspection of lofty electric searchlight. They contain fifty or sixty million dollars' worth' of diamonds, {{and there is an}} abundance of enterprising thieves around.|$|E

There's no question but {{he is one of the}} best fellows under the sun. He's tremendously energetic, and he has plenty of the kind of sense which we call horse; but he isn't brilliant. No, Tom is not brilliant. I don't think he would get on in a profession, and he's instinctively kept out of everything of the kind. But he has got to do something. What shall he do? He says mineral paint, and really I don't see why he shouldn't.
