40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{performance}} characteristics of a-Si detectors with Ir- 192 gamma source. Imaging {{performance of the}} detector system is evaluated using contrast sensitivity over a range of material thickness of steel, signal to noise ratio, dynamic range and linearity. The radiographic sensitivity was observed over a range of thickness of steel using standard image quality indicators. Quantum efficiency of the scintillator material (CsI) for Ir- 192 and Co- 60 was studied using theoretical models. For Ir- 192 source both theoretical models and experiments were performed to find the minimum and maximum thickness limitation for steel using the a-Si detector system. Various configurations of pipe weld with defects such as lack of <b>fusion,</b> <b>penetration,</b> tungsten inclusion and porosities were studied to evaluate the imaging performance. 1...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTreatment of HSV-infected {{cells with}} 5 – 10 mM β-hydroxynorvaline (Hnv), a {{threonine}} analog, specifically affects herpesvirus DNA replication: both {{the rate of}} and total DNA synthesis are reduced, the former ∼ 15 -fold by Hnv (6 h post-infection) and the latter by 12 -fold (between 3 and 12 h post-infection). The effect on DNA replication was due to inhibition of HSV- 1 thymidine kinase (TK) and DNA polymerase (DP) activities; the former is reduced by 75 % and whereas DP returns to baseline levels (when compared to untreated and/or uninfected cells). Host cell TK and DP activities are unaffected. It is suggested that β-hydroxynorvaline is incorporated into these enzyme(s), either close to or at the active site thus perturbing viral DNA synthesis. β-Hydroxynorvaline should have unique utility as a targeted antiviral compound, acting on both membrane-mediated phenomena (<b>fusion,</b> <b>penetration</b> and attachment) and DNA replication...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{influence}} of the cladding rate on the structure and microhardness parameter of coatings obtained by non-vacuum electron beam treatment of Ni-Cr-Si-B powder mixtures was investigated. Modified layers characterized by the gradient structure and consist of dendritic grains and a eutectic located at the grain boundaries. It {{was found that the}} lowest microhardness level (300 HV) was characteristic of the coatings obtained when the workpiece was moving relative to an electron beam with a speed of 10 mm per second. This treatment regime allowed obtaining high-quality coatings 2. 5 mm in thickness. However, a large thickness of <b>fusion</b> <b>penetration</b> led to the interfusion of the base metal with a coating material and a decrease in the concentration of alloying elements in the coating. Reducing the lifetime of the liquid phase during treatment prevented intensive diffusion processes. Increasing the treatment velocity to 20 mm per second doubled the cladded layer microhardness (up to 650 HV) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} the {{investigation}} of the influence {{of the size of the}} strip electrode on the dilution of the base metal used in the process of submerged arc hardfacing of continuous casting rolls are presented. Increasing the thickness and decreasing the width of the strip electrode (60 ´ 0, 5 mm, 45 ´ 0, 7 mm, 30 ´ 1, 0 mm) results in the changing of the shape and dimensions of the fusion zone of the base metal to enhance the depth and reduce the non-uniformity of <b>fusion</b> <b>penetration.</b> The experimental data show that the dilution ratio of the base metal using the strip electrode 45 ´ 0, 7  mm, containing 13, 5  % chromium, made it possible to obtain more than 11  % chromium in the chemical composition of the third deposited layer. In the process of submerged arc hardfacing increasing the travel speed of the strip electrode (heat source) up to 12 m/hour enhance the dilution ratio of the base metal. Despite this, the chromium content of the third layer is not less than 11  %. At the same time, the improved parameters of the hardfacing process allowed to achieve the better weld shape and to reduce the number of welding defects.

The conventional method for the quality inspection of weld seams is based on the structured light deformation, however, if a weld seam hasn&# 39;t a groove profile, and this method is limited. A new method based on combination of Laws texture energy and structured light is proposed in this paper. A weld seam region and a structured light region are extracted respectively, and then the intersection operation with respect to the two regions can be carried out.

We compared the entry-related events of these two viruses, including receptor binding, envelope <b>fusion,</b> peptidoglycan <b>penetration,</b> and passage through the plasma membrane. The infection-related events are dependent on the multiplicity of infection {{in the case of}} φ 13 but not with φ 6. A temporal increase of host outer membrane permeability to lipophilic ions was observed from 1. 5 to 4 min postinfection in both virus infections. This enhanced permeability period coincided with the fast dilution of octadecyl rhodamine B-labeled virus-associated lipid molecules. This result is in agreement with membrane fusion, and the presence of temporal virus-derived membrane patches on the outer membrane. Similar to φ 6, φ 13 contains a thermosensitive lytic enzyme involved in peptidoglycan penetration. The phage entry also caused a limited depolarization of the plasma membrane.

Alignments of primary amino acid sequences indicate that baculovirus fusion proteins of group I nucleopolyhedroviruses (NPV) form the GP 64 superfamily.

The entry proteins of other baculoviruses, group II NPV and granuloviruses, are class I penetrenes. Results Class III penetrenes encoded by members of the Rhabdoviridae and Herpesviridae have an internal fusion domain comprised of beta sheets, other beta sheet domains, an extended alpha helical domain, a membrane proximal stem domain and a carboxyl terminal anchor. Similar sequences and structural/functional motifs that characterize class III penetrenes are located collinearly in GP 64 of group I baculoviruses and related glycoproteins encoded by thogotoviruses. Structural models based on a prototypic class III penetrene, vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV G), were established for Thogoto virus (THOV) GP and Autographa california multiple NPV (AcMNPV) GP 64 demonstrating feasible cysteine linkages. Glycosylation sites in THOV GP and AcMNPV GP 64 appear in similar model locations to the two glycosylation sites of VSV G.

Fusion, monitored by lipid-mixing, was measured by following the dilution of pyrene-labelled phosphatidylcholine, incorporated in PS vesicles, into unlabelled bilayers. It is demonstrated that lysozyme-induced fusion is pH-dependent and significant fusion is triggered at pH 5 or below. The interaction of lysozyme with the vesicle bilayer was characterized by measuring resonance energy transfer from tryptophane, present in the protein, to pyrene. It is shown that concomitant with fusion, a strong resonance energy transfer signal appears at pH 5 or below. Furthermore, in monolayer experiments it was found that addition of lysozyme to the subphase caused an increase in surface pressure, when the pH was kept below 5. 5. Very low concentrations of lysozyme sufficed to bring about the observed effects.

Accordingly, the backing condition should be carefully selected in welding of a thick plate, because improper backing conditions lead to weld defects. In the job site, a steel backing strip is usually adopted, although it reduces the fatigue strength. No backing conditions or removable backing is recommended to increase the fatigue strength, but selection of the proper backing and welding conditions is complicated. In this study, several backing methods, such as ceramic backing, water-cooled copper backing, and even the use of no backing, were investigated during GMA (Gas Metal Arc) welding of a thick steel plate.

40|$|AbstractE 1 and E 2 are two {{hepatitis}} C {{viral envelope}} glycoproteins that assemble into a heterodimer {{that is essential}} for membrane <b>fusion</b> and <b>penetration</b> into the target cell. Both extracellular and transmembrane (TM) glycoprotein domains contribute to this interaction, but study of TM–TM interactions has been limited because synthesis and structural characterization of these highly hydrophobic segments present significant challenges. In this NMR study, by successful expression and purification of the E 2 transmembrane domain as a fusion construct we have determined the global fold and characterized backbone motions for this peptide incorporated in phospholipid micelles. Backbone resonance frequencies, relaxation rates and solvent exposure measurements concur in showing this domain to adopt a helical conformation, with two helical segments spanning residues 717 – 726 and 732 – 746 connected by an unstructured linker containing the charged residues D 728 and R 730 involved in E 1 binding. Although this linker exhibits increased local motions on the ps timescale, the dominating contribution to its relaxation is the global tumbling motion with an estimated correlation time of 12. 3 ns. The positioning of the helix–linker–helix architecture within the mixed micelle was established by paramagnetic NMR spectroscopy and phospholipid-peptide cross relaxation measurements. These indicate that while the helices traverse the hydrophobic interior of the micelle, the linker lies closer to the micelle perimeter to accommodate its charged residues.

40|$|Entry of ecotropic {{murine leukemia}} virus initiates when the {{envelope}} surface protein recognizes and binds to the virus receptor on host cells. The envelope transmembrane protein then mediates fusion of viral and host cell membranes and penetration into the cytoplasm. Using a genetic selection, we isolated an infectious retrovirus variant containing three changes in the surface protein—histidine 8 to arginine, glutamine 227 to arginine, and aspartate 243 to tyrosine. Single replacement of histidine 8 with arginine (H 8 R) resulted in almost complete loss of infectivity, even though the mutant envelope proteins were stable and efficiently incorporated into virions. Virions carrying H 8 R envelope were proficient at binding cells expressing receptor but failed to induce cell-cell fusion of XC cells, indicating that the histidine at position 8 plays {{an essential role in}} <b>fusion</b> during <b>penetration</b> of the host cell membrane. Thus, {{there is at least one}} domain in SU that is involved in fusion; the fusion functions do not reside exclusively in TM. In contrast, envelope with all three changes induced cell-cell fusion of XC cells and produced virions that were 10, 000 -fold more infectious than those containing only the H 8 R substitution, indicating that changes at positions 227 and 243 can suppress a fusion defect caused by loss of histidine 8 function. Moreover, the other two changes acted synergistically, indicating that both compensate for the loss of the same essential function of histidine 8. The ability of these changes to suppress this fusion defect might provide a means for overcoming postbinding defects found in targeted retroviral vectors for use in human gene therapy...|$|R

40|$|Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) {{infection}} is a multi-step process, first requiring virus binding {{to the host}} cell, followed by fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell plasma membrane. Efficient EBV entry into B cells requires, at the minimum, {{the interaction of the}} EBV-encoded glycoproteins gp 350 with cellular CD 21 and gp 42 with MHC class II proteins. In this study, use of the cholesterol-binding drugs methyl-b-cyclodextrin and nystatin efficiently inhibited EBV infection of target Burkitt’s lymphoma B-cell lines, indicating an important role for cholesterol and suggesting the involvement of lipid rafts in EBV infection. Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) is a gammaherpesvirus whose only natural host is in humans and which is associated with many diseases (Kieff & Rickinson, 2001; Liebowitz, 1998; Longnecker, 1998; Rickinson & Kieff, 2001). EBV is associ-ated with the haematopoietic cancers African Burkitt’s lymphoma, Hodgkin’s lymphoma and certain T-cell lym-phomas, and with the epithelial diseases nasopharyngeal carcinoma, oral hairy leukoplakia and gastric carcinoma. Most humans are asymptomatically infected with EBV during childhood; however, EBV infections during adoles-cence can result in acute infectious mononucleosis. Following lytic infection and immune clearance of the majority of EBV-infected cells, the virus persists latently in B lymphocytes. In vitro, EBV readily infects B cells by a receptor-mediated process (Nemerow & Cooper, 1984; Speck et al., 2000). Binding of gp 350 / 220, the major EBV outer envelope glyco-protein, to the cellular complement receptor CD 21 mediates initial attachment of the virus to B cells (Tanner et al., 1987). Following attachment, viral gp 42 interacts with the EBV coreceptor cellular MHC class II proteins for viral <b>fusion</b> and <b>penetration</b> of cells (Haan et al., 2000; Spriggs et al., 1996; Wang & Hutt-Fletcher, 1998). gp 42 also requires the concerted efforts of the additional viral glycoproteins gH, gL and gB for fusion of the two membranes (Haan et al., 2001...|$|R

The single-particle approach naturally separates the processes of membrane binding and membrane fusion and therefore allows measurement of details that are not available in the bulk assays. We find that the dynamics of lipid mixing during individual Sindbis fusion events is faster than 30 ms. Although neither virus binds membranes at neutral pH, under acidic conditions, the delay between membrane binding and lipid mixing {{is less than half}} a second for nearly all virus-membrane combinations.

40|$|AbstractMany enveloped viruses employ low-pH-triggered {{membrane}} <b>fusion</b> during cell <b>penetration.</b> Solution-based {{in vitro}} assays in which viruses fuse with liposomes have provided {{much of our}} current biochemical understanding of low-pH-triggered viral membrane fusion. Here, we extend this in vitro approach by introducing a fluorescence assay using single particle tracking to observe lipid mixing between individual virus particles (influenza or Sindbis) and supported lipid bilayers. Our single-particle experiments reproduce many of the observations of the solution assays. The single-particle approach naturally separates the processes of membrane binding and membrane fusion and therefore allows measurement of details that are not available in the bulk assays. We find that the dynamics of lipid mixing during individual Sindbis fusion events is faster than 30 ms. Although neither virus binds membranes at neutral pH, under acidic conditions, the delay between membrane binding and lipid mixing {{is less than half}} a second for nearly all virus-membrane combinations. The delay between binding and lipid mixing lengthened only for Sindbis virus at the lowest pH in a cholesterol-dependent manner, highlighting the complex interaction between lipids, virus proteins, and buffer conditions in membrane fusion...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The TOFD {{technique}} is being {{widely used in}} automatic weld inspection to ensure welding quality. Although it reaches high speeds in the inspection, high sizing reliability and low rate of false indications, the classification of defects through ultrasound signals generated by the TOFD {{technique is}} still frequently questioned, because it depends mainly on the knowledge and experience of the operator. The use of computational tools for signal preprocessing and pattern recognition, such as the artificial neural networks, improves the classification reliability of defects detected by this technique. This study shows how to obtain the best hierarchical and non-hierarchical linear classifiers implemented by neural networks, in order to distinguish defects (lack of <b>fusion,</b> lack of <b>penetration</b> and porosity) inserted into the testing pieces during the welding process and detected by the TOFD technique. The position, type and dimension of each inserted defect are known by conventional ultrasonic and radiographic techniques. The Fourier Transform, Wavelet Transform and Savitzky-Golay Filter were used to preprocessing signals acquired during weld inspection by TOFD technique. The results show the remarkable efficiency of welding defect recognition in preprocessed TOFD signals. As whole, the result...|$|R
40|$|Glycoprotein gCl of {{herpes simplex}} virus type 1 (HS'-l) binds {{complement}} component C 3 b. To determine if gCl modifies the interaction of complement with virus-infected cells or cell-free virus, ns-l, a mutant HSV-l strain that does not express gCl at the cell surface and does not bind C 3 b, was compared with its parental strain, NS. Cells infected with the gCl mutant were more susceptible to cytolysis mediated by antibody and complement or complement alone. The gCl or gDl genes were expressed in mammalian cells under the control ofan inducible promoter. Cells induced to express gCl resisted complement cytolysis, while cells expressing gDl did not. gCl modified cytolysis of virus-infected or-transfected cells by blocking alternative complement pathway activation. gCl also modified complement-dependent virus neutralization, which was mediated by inhibiting the classical complement pathway. These results indicate a protective role for gCl on the virion and at the cell surface. The membrane glycoproteins of{{herpes simplex virus}} (HSV) are present on the virus envelope and are expressed on the plasma membrane of infected cells [1]. HSV glycoproteins are involved in virus <b>penetration,</b> <b>fusion</b> with cell membranes...|$|R
