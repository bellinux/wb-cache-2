As conceived, the production VJ 101 D aircraft was to be powered by the Rolls-Royce/MAN Turbo RB153 engine, which was to be equipped with thrust <b>deflection</b> <b>apparatus.</b> During late 1960, EWR presented their VJ 101 D concept to the BMVg.

40|$|A {{prototype}} small photothermal <b>deflection</b> <b>apparatus</b> {{was constructed}} on a laboratory bench. Not including excitation laser, data collection computer, and gas pumps, the apparatus fits {{on a bench}} space with a footprint of about 10 cm × 10 cm. The apparatus lends itself to miniaturization in future assemblies. The apparatus was tested relative to the conventional laboratory-scale photothermal apparatus. Digital filtering procedures developed in this laboratory were used to collect and analyze the data. Numerical simulation of photothermal signal is performed to accurately predict the heat flow process as sample volumes are scaled down. The results show that increased sensitivity is possible with small apparatus configurations. The prototype apparatus also exhibits high linear response with pulsed irradiance for linear absorbers. Future improvements could include miniaturization with robust configuration that will allow for portable use in trace analysis monitoring of atmospheric pollutants...|$|E
40|$|The Road Rater is {{a dynamic}} {{deflection}} measuring apparatus for flexible base pavements. The Road Rater replaces the Benkelman Beam which was last used by the Iowa DOT in 1977. Road Rater test results correlate reasonably well (correlation coefficient = 0. 83) with Benkelman Beam test data. The basic differences between the Road Rater and Benkelman Beam are as follows: 1. The Benkelman Beam uses a static 18, 000 lb. load while the Road Rater uses a dynamic 800 to 2, 000 lb. loading. 2. The Road Rater tests much faster and more economically than the Benkelman Beam. 3. The Road Rater better simulates a moving truck than the Benkelman Beam. The basic operating principle of the Road Rater is to impart a dynamic loading and measure the resultant movement of the pavement with velocity sensors. This data, when properly adjusted for temperature by use of a nomograph included in this report, {{can be used to}} determine pavement life expectancy and estimate overlay thickness required. Road Rater testing will be conducted in the spring, when pavements are in their weakest condition, until seasonal correction factors can be developed. The Road Rater does not have sufficient ram weight to effectively evaluate load carrying capacity of rigid pavements. All rigid pavements react similarly to Road Rater testing and generally deflect from 0. 65 to 1. 30 mils. Research will be contined to evaluate rigid pavements with the Road Rater, however. The Road Rater {{has proven to be a}} reliable, troublefree pavement evaluation machine. The <b>deflection</b> <b>apparatus</b> was originally front-mounted,but was rear-mounted during the winter of 1977 - 78.

40|$|The {{research}} {{reported in}} this dissertation is aimed at development of photothermal deflection detector {{that is consistent with}} constraints imposed by aerosols sampling and analysis. The main objectives of this project are: 1) the design and evaluation of initial apparatus prototypes and 2) a test of the prototype apparatus with surrogate substances using conventional mid-infrared gas lasers. Experimental evaluation of reduced size photothermal apparatus is first performed with gaseous samples. Analysis of trichlorofluoromethane (CFC- 11) and ethanol vapors is performed with both conventional large apparatus and the prototype small apparatus. Comparison studies in terms of photothermal signal from both apparatuses are carried out to examine how apparatus downscaling affects photothermal signal. The main result indicates that the small apparatus performs about the same as the conventional laboratory-size apparatus. For better understanding of heat transport from aerosols collect on a flat substrate and its surrounding media, a numerical methodology based on finite element analysis is used to investigate the heat transfer between aerosol, substrate, and air. The numerical modeling is extended to prediction of photothermal signals from laser excited optical beam deflection due to temperature gradient inside the air above aerosols. The modeling results help to understand how aerosol properties such as size, shape, thermo-optical properties, and particles arrangement affect photothermal signal. The model is also used to investigate the influence of substrate properties on photothermal signal. A photothermal <b>deflection</b> <b>apparatus</b> is then used to examine the potential of mid-infrared photothermal spectroscopy for aerosol analysis. Laboratory-generated ammonium nitrate aerosols are deposited on germanium substrate by using Micro-Orifice Uniform Deposits Impactor (MOUDI). Photothermal spectroscopy, based on optical beam deflection (mirage effect), is used to analyze the collected aerosols. The measurements are carried out in terms of aerosol number concentration and aerosol mass concentration. Based on standard 30 minutes sampling time and 30 L/min flow rate, the limit of detection obtained for our instrument are 18 particles, equivalence of 0. 2 μg m- 3 mass concentrations for 3 μm particles diameter) for aerosol number concentration measurement and 0. 65 μg m- 3 for aerosol mass concentration measurement. Out of curiosity on whether standard materials could be used to calibrate a photothermal lens apparatus without having to make up liquid samples, it was thought that colored glass filters would serve as such standards. Photothermal lens measurements and finite element modeling are used to examine the physical changes taking place in optical filter glasses. Colored-glass and neutral density filters are found to have a strong positive temperature-dependent refractive index change...|$|E

Since that time, van handling has greatly improved, and front suspension parts are no longer overstressed due to improper weight distribution. The Road Rater provides a fast, economical, nondestructive test method to evaluate flexible pavements. Road Rater test data can be used to predict pavement life, set priorities for asphaltic concrete resurfacing, and design asphaltic concrete overlays. Temperature and seasonal variations significantly affect Road Rater deflection readings and must be considered. A nomograph included in this report adjusts for temperature, but does not correct for seasonal effect. Road Rater testing will be conducted in the spring until seasonal correction factors can be developed. The Road Rater has not successfully evaluated rigid pavements, but research will continue in this area. 1. Recommendations for continuing Road Rater research, evaluation and application are as follows:A computer program should be established to reduce Road Rater raw data (Range and Sensor reading) to HR- 178 Road Rater Dynamic Deflections For Determining Structural Rating Of Flexible Pavements mean deflection (mils) and/or structural rating. This computer printout would be similar to present friction testing printouts, and would greatly reduce Road Rater data reduction manpower needs and costs. 2. Seasonal variation study should continue to develop seasonal correction factors. Seasonal test roads will be studied concurrently with routine testing during 1979 to develop this relationship. All Road Rater testing will be conducted in the spring until the seasonal relationship is established. 3. An asphaltic concrete overlay design method should be established based on Road Rater de-flection readings. The AASHTO Interim Guide for Design of Pavement Structures 1972 will be used as a base document for this study. 4. AASHTO Structural numbers should be compared to Road Rater Structural Ratings during 1979 on asphaltic concrete overlay projects. This analysis will enable us to refine Road Rater evaluation of flexible pavements. Roads will be tested before resurfacing and several month...|$|E

It was to investigate different water-cement ratios of cement grouts effecting its flow pattern properties, and thus determinate the conversion point of them among Newtonian fluid, Bingham fluid and Power-law fluid. It confirmed that,when take into accounts of all negative factors possibly affecting the experiment, including asynchronous loading steps, water temperature, <b>apparatus</b> <b>deflection</b> and so on, W/C(water-cement ratio) = 0. 75 is a inflection point,which Power-law fluid converted into Bingham fluid, while at W/C = 1. 25 the cement grouts suffered a conversion from Newtonian fluid to Bingham fluid. This research results supplied, improved and expanded {{the knowledge of the}} flow pattern properties of cement grouts and conversion condition with different water-cement ratios, and so it has important theory meaning and realistic value and may contributes to the engineering practices...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effects of treadmill training on nociceptive sensitivity and immunoreactivity to calcitonin gene-related peptide in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord of diabetic rats. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were divided into three groups: control, diabetic and trained diabetic. Treadmill training was performed for 8 weeks. The blood glucose concentrations and body weight were evaluated 48 h after diabetes induction and every 30 days thereafter. The nociceptive sensitivity was evaluated using the tail-flick apparatus. The animals were then transcardially perfused, and the spinal cords were post-fixed, cryoprotected and sectioned in a cryostat. Immunohistochemistry for calcitonin gene-related peptide analysis was performed on the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. RESULTS: The nociceptive sensitivity analysis revealed that, compared with the control and trained diabetic animals, the latency to tail <b>deflection</b> on the <b>apparatus</b> was longer for the diabetic animals. Optical densitometry demonstrated decreased calcitonin gene-related peptide immunoreactivity in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord in diabetic animals, which was reversed by treadmill training. CONCLUSION: We concluded that treadmill training can alleviate nociceptive hypoalgesia and reverse decreased calcitonin gene-related peptide immunoreactivity in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord of diabetic animals without pharmacological treatment...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} investigates needle insertion through soft tissue, {{enabling the}} development and validation of force models and insertion techniques for accurate needle tip placement. During needle insertion into the prostate, the needle deflects {{en route to the}} target which leads to seed misplacement and suboptimal dose to cancerous cells. Many researchers have studied slow needle insertion speed and axial - needle insertion direction - force distribution and components. However, little work has been performed on stiffer needle material properties, tissue deformation with needle deflection, and normal - perpendicular to needle insertion direction - force distribution. This lack of knowledge have led to tissue deformation, needle deflection, and misplaced target when performing needle insertion procedures. 	This research aims to quantify the impact of an optimized needle grid, insertion techniques, and needle-tissue force interaction leading to needle deflection and phantom deformation. First, an improved grid used to guide the needle was investigated and inserted via different hand insertion techniques to acquire needle deflection. To measure needle <b>deflection,</b> a measurement <b>apparatus</b> with acceptable gauge repeatability and reproducibility (GR&R) and documented accuracy was introduced. Next, stiffer needle properties were explored and inserted at much faster speed via a high-speed device, when compared to hand insertion or current robotic devices. Finally, finite element analysis (FEA) models were developed to predict relative needle-phantom motion using measured force data, while simultaneously obtaining experimental needle deflection and phantom deformation. The needle and phantom FEA models and the normal force distribution on the needle shaft were validated with separate experimental results. Findings from this dissertation include a 40 % decrease in average needle deflection with the improved grid (and the same fast hand insertion technique), in addition to a 60 % decrease in average needle deflection with the stiffer needle at the faster speed (compared to the less stiff needle and slow speed). Also, the needle and phantom FEA models are reasonably accurate to the experimental data, having a difference of 7 % and 18 %, respectively. These findings can be used to improve needle insertion techniques, while understanding force distribution effect on needle bending and compensate during the insertion path...|$|R
