50|$|In 1935, Karl Matthes (German {{physician}} 1905-1962) {{developed the}} first 2-wavelength ear O2 saturation meter {{with red and}} green filters (later switched to red and <b>infrared</b> <b>filters).</b> His meter was the first device to measure O2 saturation.|$|R
40|$|Cooled <b>infrared</b> <b>filters</b> {{have been}} used in {{pressure}} modulation and filter radiometry to measure the dynamics, temperature distribution and concentrations of atmospheric elements in various satellite radiometers. Invariably such instruments use precision <b>infrared</b> bandpass <b>filters</b> and coatings for spectral selction, often operating at cryogenic temperatures. More recent developments in the use of spectrally-selective cooled detectors in focal plane arrays have simplified the optical layout and reduced the component count of radiometers but have placed additional demands on both the spectral and physical performance requirements of the filters. This paper describes and contrasts the more traditional radiometers using discrete detectors with those which use focal plane detector array technology, with particular emphasis on the function of the filters and coatings in the two cases. Additionally we discuss the spectral techniques and materials used to fabricate <b>infrared</b> coatings and <b>filters</b> for use in space optics, and give examples of their application in the fabrication of some demanding long wavelength dichroics and filters. We also discuss the effects of the space environment on the stability and durability of high performance <b>infrared</b> <b>filters</b> and materials exposed to low Earth orbit for 69 months on the NASA Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) ...|$|R
50|$|An <b>infrared</b> <b>filter</b> {{was mounted}} {{just behind the}} lens mount. This {{had to be removed}} in order to fit certain Nikkor lenses, {{including}} the IX-Nikkor lenses designed for the APS format camera.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to visible light filters, {{it also has}} a near <b>infrared</b> <b>filter</b> to help detect clouds; a methane filter in addition the visible color filters. The camera is a [...] "push-broom" [...] type imager, generating an image as the spacecraft turns.|$|E
5000|$|Some camera {{manufacturers}} {{modify their}} products {{to be used as}} astrophotography cameras, such as Canon's EOS 60Da, based on the EOS 60D but with a modified <b>infrared</b> <b>filter</b> and a low-noise sensor with heightened hydrogen-alpha sensitivity for improved capture of red hydrogen emission nebulae.|$|E

50|$|Sigma also {{states that}} the re-design of the shutter has {{eliminated}} the problem of particles flaking off of that mechanism and onto the sensor. Sigma has also revised the <b>infrared</b> <b>filter</b> (dust protector); {{it is now a}} round snap-in design rather than the square, sturdier screw-in version of the SD10.|$|E
5000|$|M8.2 - 2008-09. A {{slightly}} updated {{edition of}} the Leica M8, featuring a quieter shutter, sapphire glass LCD screen cover, new leather coatings, etc. Because both the M8 and M8.2 sensors lack an <b>infrared</b> <b>filter,</b> an IR-cut filter {{in front of the}} lens is required to render some synthetic material colors correctly.|$|E
50|$|The PXL-2000 {{consists}} of a simple aspherical lens, an <b>infrared</b> <b>filter,</b> a CCD image sensor, a custom ASIC (the Sanyo LA 7306M), and an audio cassette mechanism. This is mounted in a plastic housing with a battery compartment and an RF video modulator selectable to either North American television channel 3 or 4. A plastic viewfinder and some control buttons complete the device.|$|E
5000|$|The Princeton Instruments CCD (PI-CCD) {{camera is}} mounted {{on one of the}} side ports. The camera employs a 1340x1300 pixel, thinned, back-illuminated E2V CCD. The 20μm pixels give better spatial {{sampling}} than IFOSC. A set of Ultra-violet, Blue, Violet, Red, <b>Infrared</b> <b>filters</b> identical to those used in IFOSC is available for this instrument. A summary of the instrument parameters are given below: ...|$|R
5000|$|A Bulgarian Air Force MiG-21 {{two-seater}} {{was used}} by the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences to study the solar corona. The MiG-21, flying at 1600-1700 km/h (M=1,4-1,5) at an altitude of 13,000 m, was able to stay in the moon's umbra for 6 min. The photographer, an air force pilot, used two film cameras, both fitted with 200 mm lenses and <b>infrared</b> <b>filters,</b> and one Digital8 video camera.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike most digital cameras, {{there is}} no IR or UV {{filtering}} {{in front of the}} image sensor. This results in a wide spectral response of approximately 1000 nm to 380 nm (infrared to ultraviolet). Suitable external bandpass filters are required to photograph in IR or UV wavelengths. <b>Infrared</b> <b>filters</b> are readily available at low cost from many sources, but ultraviolet filters - and suitable lenses - can be expensive.|$|R
5000|$|Second {{harmonic}} generation {{is used by}} the laser industry to make green 532 nm lasers from a 1064 nm source. The 1064 nm light is fed through a bulk KDP crystal. In high-quality diode lasers the crystal is coated on the output side with an <b>infrared</b> <b>filter</b> to prevent leakage of intense 1064 nm or 808 nm infrared light into the beam. Both of these wavelengths are invisible and do not trigger the defensive [...] "blink-reflex" [...] reaction in the eye and can therefore be a special hazard to the human eyes. Furthermore, some laser safety eyewear intended for argon or other green lasers may filter out the green component (giving a false sense of safety), but transmit the infrared. Nevertheless, some [...] "green laser pointer" [...] products have become available on the market which omit the expensive <b>infrared</b> <b>filter,</b> often without warning. Second {{harmonic generation}} is also used for measuring ultra short pulse width by means of intensity auto-correlation.|$|E
50|$|Some devices {{project a}} second (invisible infrared) beam above the virtual keyboard. The user's finger makes a {{keystroke}} on the virtual keyboard. This breaks the infrared beam and reflects light {{back to the}} projector. The reflected beam passes through an <b>infrared</b> <b>filter</b> to the camera. The camera photographs the angle of incoming infrared light. The sensor chip determines where infrared beam was broken. Software determines the action or character to be generated.|$|E
5000|$|Although the D810A can be {{used for}} normal photography, due to the deep red / near {{infrared}} sensitivity the in-camera white balance may fail in case of fluorescent light or difficult cases with very strong infrared light [...] requiring an external <b>infrared</b> <b>filter.</b> Nikon published an D810A astrophotography guide which recommends live view focussing with 23× enlarged selected areas and a gallery showing the mostly small effects to the color reproduction in [...] "normal" [...] photos.|$|E
5000|$|Special cameras {{often do}} not apply an <b>infrared</b> cut <b>filter</b> or optical low pass filters, thus avoid {{affecting}} the image.|$|R
500|$|Very {{little is}} known of Pallas's surface features. Hubble images from 2007, with a {{resolution}} around [...] per pixel, show pixel-to-pixel variation, but Pallas's albedo of 0.12 placed such features {{at the lower end}} of detectability. There is little variability between lightcurves obtained through visible-light and <b>infrared</b> <b>filters,</b> but there are significant deviations in the ultraviolet, suggesting large surface or compositional features near 285° (75° west longitude). Pallas's rotation appears to be prograde.|$|R
50|$|Among other activities, the SCL {{was made}} {{responsible}} {{for research in}} the detection of aircraft by acoustical and infrared radiation means. Blair had performed his doctoral research in the interaction of electromagnet waves with solid materials, and naturally gave attention {{to this type of}} detection. Initially, attempts were made to detect infrared radiation, either from the heat of aircraft engines or as reflected from large searchlights with <b>infrared</b> <b>filters,</b> as well as from radio signals generated by the engine ignition.|$|R
5000|$|Canon {{announced}} {{a modified version}} of the EOS 60D for astrophotography on April 3, 2012, called the EOS 60Da. The 60Da is the successor to the EOS 20Da. It was expected to cost $1,499. The camera has a modified <b>infrared</b> <b>filter</b> and a low-noise sensor with heightened hydrogen-alpha (H-alpha) sensitivity for improved capture of red hydrogen emission nebulae. [...] The 60Da is three times as sensitive to H-alpha light as the 60D to allow for better images of nebulae.|$|E
50|$|Depending on how {{the camera}} is set up, a new photo can usually be taken every second {{for as long as}} motion/heat events are detected. Some game cameras give the user a choice of {{settings}} for regular camera flash or stealth-like LED flash. LED flash enables the hunter to discreetly image game in the night without a visible flash. This prevents the flash from giving away the hunters position in popular hunting areas. Some models have a manual switch to set an <b>infrared</b> <b>filter</b> for day or night mode.|$|E
5000|$|Projector/Laser {{light curtain}} — A dual {{infrared}} laser device is positioned {{in the top}} middle area of a flat surface. The laser beam sweeps across the surface creating an invisible curtain. The projector, usually an ultra short throw projector) has a built in camera with an <b>infrared</b> <b>filter</b> that scans the projected area. When a pointer, finger or marker disrupts the laser curtain, an X,Y position can be traced. This {{is one of the}} few optical technologies that do not require a reflecting frame in the perimeter of the projected area to work.|$|E
5|$|Most amateurs work at visible wavelengths, {{but a small}} {{minority}} experiment with wavelengths outside the visible spectrum.

40|$|Abstract. The {{proliferation}} of near-infrared (1 – 5 µm) photometric systems {{over the last}} 30 years has made the comparison of photometric results difficult. In an effort to standardize <b>infrared</b> <b>filters</b> in use, the Mauna Kea Observatories near-infrared filter set has been promoted among instrument groups through combined filter production runs. The characteristics of this filter set are summarized, and {{some aspects of the}} filter wavelength definitions, the flux density for zero magnitude, atmospheric extinction coefficients, and color correction to above the atmosphere are discussed. 1...|$|R
