5|$|Microsoft {{introduced}} Windows Server 2012 and its developer preview in the BUILD 2011 {{conference on}} September 9, 2011. However, unlike Windows 8, the developer preview of Windows Server 2012 was only {{made available to}} MSDN subscribers. It included a graphical user interface (GUI) based on Metro <b>design</b> <b>language</b> and a new Server Manager, a graphical application used for server management. On February 16, 2012, Microsoft released an update for developer preview build that extended its expiry date from April 8, 2012 to January 15, 2013.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of Windows Phone, Microsoft {{underwent}} a gradual rebranding of its product range throughout 2011 and 2012—the corporation's logos, products, services and websites adopted the principles and concepts of the Metro <b>design</b> <b>language.</b> Microsoft previewed Windows 8, an operating system designed to power both personal computers and tablet computers, in Taipei in June 2011. A developer preview was released on September 13, {{and was replaced by}} a consumer preview on February 29, 2012. On May 31, 2012, the preview version was released. On June 18, 2012, Microsoft unveiled the Surface, the first computer in the company's history to have its hardware made by Microsoft. On June 25, Microsoft paid US$1.2 billion to buy the social network Yammer. On July 31, 2012, Microsoft launched the Outlook.com webmail service to compete with Gmail. On September 4, 2012, Microsoft released Windows Server 2012.|$|E
25|$|In {{comparison}} to the Polo Mk4, the Polo Vivo has a restyled front bumper and grille, deleted scuff strips on the bumpers and sides of the car, and side indicators relocated from the wing mirrors to the front fenders. This restyling gives the Polo Vivo some {{of the elements of}} the <b>design</b> <b>language</b> used in other contemporary VW models.|$|E

40|$|The {{integration}} of advanced learning technologies in education {{has made the}} design and development of instructional units and courses a complex task. Instructional <b>design</b> <b>languages</b> are proposed as a conceptual tool to achieve more creative design solutions and to enhance communication in design teams. This paper reviews {{the state of the}} art in the development, application, and research concerning the use of <b>design</b> <b>languages</b> in education and e-learning. The review reports on relevant literature and on both theoretical and empirical studies. As basis for further research, the authors propose a taxonomy of <b>design</b> <b>languages</b> and a framework for possible application of <b>design</b> <b>languages</b> in instructional <b>design</b> and e-learning practices...|$|R

25|$|All Windows Phone devices include {{capacitive}} multi-touch screens, FM radios, Wi-Fi, {{and certain}} other features {{included on the}} Zune HD. The user interface of the Zune devices, particularly the Zune HD, served as {{the inspiration for the}} user interface of Windows Phone. Microsoft refers to the <b>design</b> <b>language</b> of this user interface as Metro.|$|E
25|$|Reception of iOS 7 was mixed. The new <b>design</b> <b>language</b> was criticized, with critics {{noting the}} {{implementation}} of design changes rather than actual productivity improvements, and citing examples such as animations delaying access, lack of icon consistency, and buttons being hidden as negative aspects of the user experience. The addition of the Control Center was praised, as were updates to Siri and multitasking. Shortly after release, {{there were reports of}} the new design causing sickness, a trend explained as being caused by animations with similar effects as car sickness.|$|E
25|$|The Macintosh SE was {{released}} {{at the same}} time as the Macintosh II for $2900 (or $3900 with hard drive), as the first compact Mac with a 20MB internal hard drive and an expansion slot. The SE's expansion slot was located inside the case along with the CRT, potentially exposing an upgrader to high voltage. For this reason, Apple recommended users bring their SE to an authorized Apple dealer to have upgrades performed. The SE also updated Jerry Manock and Terry Oyama's original design and shared the Macintosh II's Snow White <b>design</b> <b>language,</b> as well as the new Apple Desktop Bus (ADB) mouse and keyboard that had first appeared on the Apple IIGS some months earlier.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Different <b>design</b> <b>languages</b> {{are used}} for {{hardware}} and software domains. The most popular ones are VHDL and C++. Recently, SystemC language was developed aiming to bridge both domains. In this paper, we compare these <b>design</b> <b>languages</b> by separating and analysing {{the capabilities of the}} different language subsets with respect to the implementation of the different programming paradigms. Our analysis illustrates that the considered <b>design</b> <b>languages</b> show a great deal of similarity, despite different domains of application. We demonstrate the usage of the language subsets in a case study (design of a generic calculator model) ...|$|R

25|$|Windows 8, the {{successor}} to Windows 7, was released generally on October 26, 2012. A number of significant changes were made on Windows 8, including {{the introduction of a}} user interface based around Microsoft's Metro <b>design</b> <b>language</b> with optimizations for touch-based devices such as tablets and all-in-one PCs. These changes include the Start screen, which uses large tiles that are more convenient for touch interactions and allow for the display of continually updated information, and a new class of apps which are designed primarily for use on touch-based devices. Other changes include increased integration with cloud services and other online platforms (such as social networks and Microsoft's own OneDrive (formerly SkyDrive) and Xbox Live services), the Windows Store service for software distribution, and a new variant known as Windows RT for use on devices that utilize the ARM architecture. An update to Windows 8, called Windows 8.1, was released on October 17, 2013, and includes features such as new live tile sizes, deeper OneDrive integration, and many other revisions. Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 has been subject to some criticism, such as removal of the Start menu.|$|E
25|$|The first {{hardware}} revision, the Lisa 2, {{was released}} in January 1984 and was priced between $3,495 and $5,495 US. It was much less expensive than the original model and dropped the Twiggy floppy drives {{in favor of a}} single 400k Sony microfloppy. It was possible to purchase the Lisa 2 with as little as 512k RAM. The Lisa 2/5 consisted of a Lisa 2 bundled with an external 5MB or 10MB hard drive. In 1984, {{at the same time the}} Macintosh was officially announced, Apple offered free upgrades to the Lisa 2/5 to all Lisa 1 owners, by swapping the pair of Twiggy drives for a single 3.5-inch drive, and updating the boot ROM and I/O ROM. In addition, the Lisa 2's new front faceplate was included to accommodate the reconfigured floppy disk drive. With this change, the Lisa 2 had the notable distinction of introducing the new Apple inlaid logo, as well as the first Snow White <b>design</b> <b>language</b> features. The Lisa 2/10 featured a 10MB internal hard drive (but no external parallel port) and a standard configuration of 1MB of RAM.|$|E
25|$|The AL10 RX's new {{exterior}} styling adopts the L-finesse <b>design</b> <b>language,</b> {{and outer}} features include a rear spoiler which hides {{the rear window}} wiper and radio antenna creating a less cluttered appearance. The drag coefficient on the latest RX 350 {{has been reduced to}} 0.33 C'd. Exterior dimensions are increased, with cargo room increased by five percent over the prior generation. For the interior, major standard features include SmartAccess, a keyless entry and start system, electrochromic heated side mirrors, UV reducing exterior glass, Bluetooth, power tilt/telescoping steering wheel, power 10-way driver and passenger seats, sliding and reclining rear seats and a power rear hatch. The instrument cluster's multi-function display uses an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display instead of a thin film transistor (TFT-LCD) display. New cabin technologies include VoiceBox Technologies conversational speech voice recognition system, {{the first of its kind}} in the U.S., which can recognize general speech commands. The new hard disk drive HDD-based navigation system no longer uses a touchscreen, instead replacing it with Lexus' Remote Touch controller, similar in function to a computer mouse, with haptic feedback. Optional accessory features include XM Satellite Radio, a 15-speaker 330-watt Mark Levinson Surround Sound audio system, a dual-screen Rear Seat Entertainment System (RSES), 19-inch wheels, heated and ventilated front seats, power front seat cushion extender, perforated and semi-aniline leather seats, a smog sensor for the HVAC system, power folding side view mirrors, and navigation system. With XM subscription the navigation adds real-time NavTraffic and NavWeather updates.|$|E

40|$|There is {{tremendous}} interest in <b>design</b> <b>languages</b> these days-and more particularly, SystemC and SystemVerilog. Sometimes {{the truth about}} <b>design</b> <b>languages</b> can be obscured by marketing and the press. This panel is meant to deepen the technical understanding of the DATE audience {{on the issue of}} <b>design</b> <b>languages.</b> It contains five technical experts- an academic expert in <b>design</b> <b>languages</b> and SystemC and SystemVerilog in particular; a language expert for each of SystemC and SystemVerilog; and a user expert for these two languages. The language experts have been heavily involved in the specification and evolution of their respective languages. The user experts have been heavily involved in developing use methodologies for these languages within their own design communities, and in applying them to real design problems. The panelists will consider the questions:- what are the key capabilities of these languages and what do they offer to users?- which design problems are they best used for? what is their scope?- how has application of these <b>languages</b> to real <b>design</b> problems improved the productivity of designers {{and the quality of the}} design results?- where should the languages develop further capabilities...|$|R
500|$|In May 2017, Microsoft {{unveiled}} Fluent Design System (previously codenamed [...] "Project Neon"), a revamp of Microsoft <b>Design</b> <b>Language</b> 2 {{that will}} include guidelines for the designs and interactions used within software designed for all Windows 10 devices and platforms. The new <b>design</b> <b>language</b> will include more prominent use of motion, depth, and translucency effects. Microsoft stated that the implementation of this <b>design</b> <b>language</b> would be performed over time, and it had already started to implement elements of it in Creators Update and Fall Creators Update.|$|E
500|$|The {{dashboard}} originally used a layout {{similar to}} Windows 8's [...] "Start screen", with a horizontal-scrolling, tile-based interface. This design was replaced for Xbox Preview Program members in September 2015 {{with the current}} interface, known as [...] "the New Xbox One Experience", which was publicly released {{as part of the}} November 12, 2015 system update.

500|$|The Macintosh Classic was {{the final}} {{adaptation}} of Jerry Manock's and Terry Oyama's Macintosh 128K industrial design, bringing back some elements of the original, while retaining little of the Snow White <b>design</b> <b>language</b> used in the Macintosh SE's design. The only remnant of the SE was the stripe across the front panel (bezel) for the floppy drive; the distinctive front bezel lines of the SE were not used on the Classic, and the vertical lines around its base were replaced by four horizontal vent lines, more reminiscent of the original design. Also, {{the curve of the}} front bezel was increased to the same [...] radial curve as on the front of both the Macintosh LC and Macintosh IIsi. The screen brightness dial on this bezel was also removed in favor of a software control. This broad, curved front bezel became a signature of Apple product design for much of the 1990s.|$|E
500|$|Lexus {{introduced}} a new <b>design</b> <b>language</b> known as [...] "L-finesse" [...] in the mid-2000s with its LF series concepts and the 2006 Lexus GS. L-finesse is represented by three Japanese kanji characters which translate as [...] "Intriguing Elegance, Incisive Simplicity, and Seamless Anticipation". Design characteristics, including a fastback profile, lower-set grille, {{and the use of}} both convex and concave surfaces, are derived from Japanese cultural motifs (e.g. the phrase kirikaeshi in arrowhead shapes). While earlier Lexus models were criticized for reserved and derivative styling, and often mistaken for understated domestic market cars, automotive design analyses described L-finesse as adding a distinctive nature and embrace of Japanese design identity. Opinions varied for L-finesse's debut on the GS; Sports Car Internationals analysis praised the vehicle's in-person appearance; Automobile Magazine criticized the daring of its forward styling, and compared subsequent rival models for design similarities. In 2012, the arrival of the redesigned fourth generation Lexus GS featured the introduction of a spindle-shaped grille design, intended to be used on all forthcoming Lexus models. L-finesse exhibitions were presented at Milan's Salone del Mobile from 2005 through 2009.|$|E
500|$|Xbox One's user {{interface}} uses Microsoft's Fluent Design System; previous iterations of the console's software used the Metro <b>design</b> <b>language.</b> The dashboard {{is divided into}} [...] "Home", [...] "Mixer", [...] "Community", [...] "Entertainment", and [...] "Store" [...] sections, with the [...] "Home" [...] page further divided into [...] "blocks" [...] that can display pinned games/apps, {{as well as other}} content. Pressing the Xbox Guide button opens a sidebar with access to common functions such as the friends list, apps, the user's party, and settings. [...] Users can go back to the dashboard while using games or apps using either the Xbox button on their controller or a voice command; up to four apps can run (either actively or in the background) at once, but only one game can run at a time. Use of Kinect enables the ability to control the console via voice commands. Xbox One's voice control capabilities are similar to, albeit richer than those of Xbox 360. The voice assistant Cortana was added in 2016 to provide expanded voice command functionality with natural language recognition.|$|E

500|$|Toyota {{claims that}} the Aurion is {{designed}} to Australian tastes, {{although it has been}} designed with markets such as Asia in mind. Hogios states that the Aurion follows the traits of current Australian styling, with a tendency to look towards European designs for inspiration. In addition, like its other vehicles of similar vintage, Toyota designed the Aurion within the realm of its [...] "vibrant clarity" [...] <b>design</b> <b>language.</b> According to chief designer Hogios, the car makes particular use of the [...] "vibrant clarity" [...] theory known as [...] "perfect imbalance". This involves body features that act as a counterpoint to other body features. Examples of this include intersecting concave and convex surfaces and vertical sculpted features on the front fascia, which are balanced by the horizontal headlamps. The front-end's [...] "double concave architecture" [...] can also be characterised by its protruding bonnet crease line and deep grille. The same architecture is applied at the rear, with a deep bumper, a clamshell-shaped boot lid that envelops over the flanks, dual exhaust pipes and tail lamps. Design patents were filed on 27 December 2005 at the United States Patent and Trademark Office.|$|E
500|$|Microsoft showcased {{other aspects}} of the new {{operating}} system, to be known as Windows 8, during subsequent presentations. Among these changes (which also included an overhauled interface optimized for use on touch-based devices built around Metro <b>design</b> <b>language)</b> was the introduction of Windows Runtime (WinRT). Software developed using this new architecture could be processor-independent (allowing compatibility with both x86 and ARM-based systems), would emphasize the use of touch input, would run within a sandboxed environment to provide additional security, and be distributed through Windows Store—a store similar to services such as the App Store and Google Play. WinRT was also optimized to provide a more [...] "reliable" [...] experience on ARM-based devices; as such, backward compatibility for Win32 software otherwise compatible with older versions of Windows was intentionally excluded from Windows on ARM. Windows developers indicated that existing Windows applications were not specifically optimized for reliability and energy efficiency on the ARM architecture, and that WinRT was sufficient for providing [...] "full expressive power" [...] for applications, [...] "while avoiding the traps and pitfalls that can potentially reduce the overall experience for consumers." [...] Consequentially, this lack of backwards compatibility would also prevent existing malware from running on the operating system.|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, the Xbox One {{received}} favorable {{reviews from}} critics and reviewers. In its launch review, Polygon gave the Xbox One an 8/10. Its design {{was described as}} [...] "inoffensive" [...] but its larger size noted, while the console's quieter and cooler operation was praised for indicating a potentially higher reliability than Xbox 360 was on-launch. The controller was praised for its battery life and [...] "premium" [...] design, but {{some members of the}} site's staff felt that its shoulder buttons were stiffer than that of previous designs. The design of Xbox One's interface received mixed reviews: noting that it carried over Windows 8's <b>design</b> <b>language,</b> the interface was disfavored for hiding functions under the controller's menu button and for being awkward to use with a controller or motion gestures, seemingly encouraging users to use voice navigation instead. While praised for having more [...] "robust" [...] voice navigation than Xbox 360, they felt that voice navigation still had a [...] "learning curve in understanding what works and what doesn't." [...] Although its user following, Smart Match, and improved voice chat features were noted, Xbox Live was panned for not offering the option on-launch to add a real name to user profiles. Despite a regression in local and network multimedia functionality in comparison to Xbox 360 and how OneGuide interacted with outside set-top boxes (drawing comparisons to the operations of TiVo DVRs), Polygon felt the Xbox One's overall multimedia experience [...] "feels like a major step forward in set-top boxes and makes the Xbox One the obvious center of any living room that has one." ...|$|E
