After the loss Pierroth Jr. berated Gran Markus Jr. over the loss. The fourth match of the night featured brothers Dr. Wagner Jr. and Black Tiger on opposite sides as they each captained a trio. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>and</b> deciding fall Dr. Wagner Jr. pinned Negro Casas to bring the victory for himself, Universo 2000, Juventud Guerrera and Fuerza Guerrera.|$|E

5|$|George is a {{supporting}} character {{who appeared in}} various adaptations of the BBC sitcom Blackadder, played by Hugh Laurie.

Quartz and plagioclase were found mostly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second layer, calcite was found mostly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>third</b> layer, <b>and</b> apatite was found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>third</b> layer <b>and</b> at <b>the</b> bottom of the second layer.|$|R

5|$|Tigers' {{next game}} was played against the Canton Bulldogs, who were coming off their first loss of the season.

5|$|A batting all-rounder, Loxton {{played as}} a {{right-handed}} middle-order batsman and a right-arm fast medium bowler who reinforced the frontline pace attack of Lindwall, Miller and Bill Johnston. When fit, the trio all bowled before Loxton in the Tests. With medium pacer Ernie Toshack and off spinner Ian Johnson also playing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Third</b> <b>and</b> Fourth Tests, Loxton was the sixth bowler. In the Fifth Test, Johnson {{was replaced by}} leg spinner Ring and the injured Toshack {{was replaced by a}} batsman, so Loxton became the fifth bowler. Of the seven regular bowlers, Loxton {{was the only one who}} was not a frontline bowler, and as such he had the worst average, the second-worst economy rate and the third-worst strike rate. Loxton ended the Test series with 144 runs at 48.00 and three wickets at 49.33, having bowled 63 overs. Loxton batted at No.6 or No.7 during the Tests, and was the last batsman in the batting order before the wicket-keeper and the bowlers.|$|E

5|$|A left-handed opening batsman, Morris {{played in}} all five Tests, partnering the {{right-handed}} Sid Barnes in three Tests; Barnes was injured <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Third</b> <b>and</b> Fourth Tests. Barnes {{was unable to}} open in the former and did not play in the latter. Three opening batsmen were taken on the tour, with Bill Brown being the reserve. During the tour matches, which were usually played consecutively with only one or no days between fixtures, Bradman rotated the trio, so one would generally be rested while the other two opened.N- Notable exceptions occurred in the Test series and the opening match against Worcestershire and the clash against the MCC. In those matches, Australia fielded its first-choice team; Brown played out of position in the middle order, while Morris and Barnes opened. A very occasional left-arm unorthodox spin bowler, Morris delivered only 35 overs during the first-class matches, including eight in the Tests. He took two wickets, both outside the Test arena.|$|E
5|$|After holding Michigan State to a three-and-out to {{open the}} third quarter, Alabama scored its fifth {{touchdown}} in six offensive possessions when Marquis Maze scored on a 37-yard Greg McElroy pass. Up by 35 points late in the third, the Crimson Tide pulled many of their starters that resulted in many players seeing action from deep in the depth chart. Eddie Lacy extended the lead to 49–0 with touchdown runs of twelve-yards <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>and</b> 62-yards in the fourth quarter. Michigan State scored their only points late in the fourth on a 49-yard Bennie Fowler touchdown reception from Keith Nichol to make the final score 49–7. The 42-point margin of victory was Alabama's largest in a bowl game since defeating Syracuse 61–6 in the 1953 Orange Bowl.|$|E

Stoke City played one replay in the third round, before beating all opponents in a run which culminated in a 5–0 victory over Bolton Wanderers in the semi-final at Wembley Stadium – the biggest winning margin at Wembley since 1939. Manchester City entered the final as favourites, with Stoke City as underdogs.|$|E

5|$|Brooks {{collected}} a bronze in the medley relay after swimming the freestyle leg in the heats before {{being replaced by}} first-choice Stockwell in the final. Competing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>and</b> final heat, Australia and the United States were equal at the last change before Brooks posted the fastest freestyle leg in the heats, pulling out a 0.40s margin over Tom Jager. Australia again qualified fastest, but the Americans again had more in reserve, having rested all of their first-choice quartet in the heats. Stockwell combined with Kerry, Evans and Glenn Buchanan to finish behind the United States and Canada in the final, missing silver by just 0.02s. Australia improved on their qualifying time by only 0.68s, while the Americans sped up by 5.03s.|$|E
5|$|City were relegated again {{five seasons}} later, but when O'Rourke was reappointed as manager before the 1928–29 season, they broke several club records to earn {{promotion}} back to Division Two.
