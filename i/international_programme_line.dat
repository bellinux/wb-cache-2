2500|$|Students {{enrolled}} in the University of London <b>International</b> <b>Programmes</b> {{are members of the}} University of London. <b>International</b> <b>Programmes</b> Students however, have very limited student representation within the University. There are also differences over the status <b>International</b> <b>Programmes</b> Students have with respect to their lead college. Some institutions co-register their <b>International</b> <b>Programmes</b> Students as college members (e.g. SOAS, LSHTM), in addition to their status as University of London member. However, other colleges deny <b>International</b> <b>Programmes</b> Students membership status and privileges when they are present in London (e.g. LSE). Academics at the University of London are responsible for the academic direction of the <b>International</b> <b>Programmes.</b> When the <b>International</b> <b>Programmes</b> was audited in 2005 by the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA), the auditors concluded that 'broad confidence' could be placed in the University's management and the awards made through the External System ('broad confidence' is [...] "the best verdict any institution can be given by the auditors"). The 'confidence' was once again reiterated in the QAA's 2011 Institutional Audit, attesting {{to the quality of the}} program provision.|$|R
