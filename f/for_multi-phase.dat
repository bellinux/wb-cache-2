40|$|We extend recent {{numerical}} results (Dobbs et. al. 2006) on {{molecular cloud}} formation in spiral galaxies by including a multi-phase medium. The {{addition of a}} hot phase of gas enhances the structure in the cold gas, and significantly increases the fraction of molecular hydrogen that is formed when the cold gas passes through a spiral shock. The difference in structure {{is reflected in the}} mass power spectrum of the molecular clouds, which is steeper <b>for</b> the <b>multi-phase</b> calculations. The increase in molecular gas occurs as the addition of a hot phase leads to higher densities in the cold gas. In particular, cold gas is confined in clumps between the spiral arms and retains a higher molecular fraction. Unlike the single phase results, molecular clouds are present in the inter-arm regions <b>for</b> the <b>multi-phase</b> medium. However the density of the inter-arm molecular hydrogen is generally below that which can be reliably determined from CO measurements. We therefore predict that <b>for</b> a <b>multi-phase</b> medium, there will be low density clouds containing cold atomic and molecular hydrogen, which are potentially entering the spiral arms.

40|$|AbstractThe complex {{interaction}} between the soft and hard constituents hinders to understand the macro-micro stress-strain response of multi-phase steels in detail during sheet forming process.

40|$|Image {{processing}} of X-ray-computed polychromatic cone-beam micro-tomography (μ XCT) data of geological samples mainly involves artefact reduction and phase segmentation. For the former, the main beam-hardening (BH) artefact is removed by applying a best-fit quadratic surface algorithm {{to a given}} image data set (reconstructed slice), which minimizes the BH offsets of the attenuation data points from that surface. A Matlab code for this approach is provided in the Appendix. The final BH-corrected image is extracted from the residual data or from {{the difference between the}} surface elevation values and the original grey-scale values. For the segmentation, we propose a novel least-squares support vector machine (LS-SVM, an algorithm <b>for</b> pixel-based <b>multi-phase</b> classification) approach. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed on BH-corrected and uncorrected samples to show that BH correction is in fact an important prerequisite <b>for</b> accurate <b>multi-phase</b> classification.

Secondly, <b>for</b> <b>multi-phase</b> composites (including two-phase composites with non-aligned inclusions as a special case), direct homogenization schemes might lead to a non-symmetric overall stiffness tensor, while a two-step homogenization procedure gives physically acceptable results. Thirdly, a general procedure allows to formulate the thermo-elastic version of any homogenization model defined by its isothermal strain concentration tensors. For all three subjects, the theory is presented in detail and validated against experimental data or finite element results for numerous composite systems. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
