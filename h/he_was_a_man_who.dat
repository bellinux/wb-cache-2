25|$|Initially {{introduced}} as a supporting {{character in the}} first game, he {{has been one of}} the primary antagonists throughout the series, where he usually manipulates story events behind-the-scenes. Power-hungry, knowledgeable and infinitely cunning, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> sought to replace the entire human race through mass extinction and forced evolution, believing humanity to be an evolutionary dead-end. To this end, he was affiliated with the Umbrella Corporation as one of its most promising researchers, and at the same time participated in illicit activities by going undercover as S.T.A.R.S. captain in Raccoon City. Through the course of much betrayal of his allies to further his own plans, Wesker fakes his death, gains superhuman strength, speed & regeneration from an experimental variant of the Progenitor virus, and works alongside both Umbrella's mysterious rival company and their successors in the field of biological weapons development, TRICELL, until his ultimate defeat in Resident Evil 5.|$|E
25|$|By 1923, during Prohibition, Long Hill was {{attracting}} more {{guests for}} its supply of home-brewed ciders and beers than its sporting facilities. While in 1924, through their mutual acquaintance of Ring Lardner, F. Scott Fitzgerald {{turned up at}} the farm and sparred three rounds with Welsh. In 1924, Welsh was back in court, after {{he was involved in}} a car collision caused by him driving his vehicle {{on the wrong side of}} the road. Welsh began looking for other ventures to take him away from the health farm, and in 1925 he rejoined the US Army, becoming a boxing instructor at the Plattsburg Barracks in upstate New York. While in the forces he placed an advertisement for a manager to run Long Hill, which was accepted by neighbour and friend, Sidky Bey, and his wife Hranoush, known as Madame Bey. With strict curfew hours and a no-alcohol policy, Madame Bey made the farm a success, and Long Hill became an important training venue for New York boxers. But her tenure at the farm ended acrimoniously, over an argument with boxer Battling Siki, who Welsh believed to be a bad influence. After discussing the matter with other boxers, Madame Bey left Long Hill and set up her own rival venue. With Welsh in the Army and Madame Bey gone, the farm fell into disrepair. Bey later recalled Welsh fondly, stating that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> enjoyed having a good time, but was a terrible businessman.|$|E

500|$|Francis Watt, {{writing in}} the Juridical Review, portrays this as Coke's strongest {{characteristic}} as a lawyer: that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> [...] "having once taken up a point or become engaged in a case, believes in it with all his heart and soul, whilst all the time conscious of its weakness, as well as ready to resort to every device to bolster it up". Writers have struggled to reconcile his achievements as a judge surrounding the rejection of executive power {{and the rights of}} man with his tenure as Attorney General, with Gerald P. Bodet noting that his early career as a state prosecutor was one of [...] "arrogance and brutality".|$|E
500|$|During his arraignment, Modell {{uses his}} ability to make the judge let him go. The agents look into Modell's past and find that he failed to enter the FBI after a {{psychological}} examination deemed him to be grossly egocentric and sociopathic. Meanwhile, after writing the word [...] "pass" [...] {{on a piece of}} paper and putting it in his shirt pocket, Modell is able to pass security and enter FBI headquarters. He [...] "pushes" [...] an agent, Holly (Julia Arkos), into pulling up Mulder's file for him. When Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) intervenes, Modell convinces Holly that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> mugged her, causing her to spray Skinner with mace and beat him. Scully is unable to explain how Modell has his power, but now agrees with Mulder's theory that he can push people into doing whatever he wants.|$|E
500|$|Waugh was {{approached}} at the Oberoi by an Indian man, {{who was also}} staying at the hotel. The man called himself [...] "John" [...] and gave no surname. John said <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> had won money betting on cricket and asked Waugh to provide pitch and weather information; he also asked the Australian to reveal inside knowledge about the team, such as tactics and player selections, in exchange for US$4,000. Waugh accepted the money and agreed {{to provide information about}} the pitch and weather, but he refused to divulge the tactics that the Australians intended to use against their opposition, or information on which players would play and what their role would be. Information on pitch conditions provides an insight into the strategies that the team might adopt and which players might be used, and teams will field different players depending on the pitch, as their skills are suited to different conditions. The arrangement with John remained in place {{until the end of the}} 1994–95 Australian summer. Waugh later said that at the time, he did not see anything wrong with his actions, reasoning that the agreement was similar to a player speculating about their form and the playing conditions in a pre-match media interview.|$|E

2500|$|As {{their ancient}} predecessors, swordplay and wrestling were {{commonly}} {{practiced by the}} royalty of Vijayanagara. Krishna Deva Raya {{is said to have}} arranged a duel between a champion swordsman and the prince of Odisha who was known for being an expert with both the sword and dagger. The prince accepted the challenge until he learned he would be fighting one not of royal blood and so killed himself rather than having to “soil his hands”. Fernao Nunes and the Persian envoy Adbur Razzak relate that Deva Raya II survived an assassination attempt “as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> knew how to use both sword and dagger better than anyone in his kingdom, avoided by twists and turns of his body the thrusts aimed at him, freed himself from him, and slew him with a short sword that he had.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Art critic Emily Genauer {{stated that}} Alston [...] "refused to be pigeonholed", {{regarding}} his varied exploration in his artwork. Patron Lemoine Pierce said of Alston's work: [...] "Never {{thought of as}} an innovative artist, Alston generally ignored popular art trends and violated many mainstream art conventions; he produced abstract and figurative paintings often simultaneously, refusing to be stylistically consistent, and during his 40-year career he worked prolifically and unapologetically in both commercial and fine art." [...] Romare Bearden described Alston as [...] "...one of the most versatile artists whose enormous skill {{led him to a}} diversity of styles..." [...] Bearden also describes the professionalism and impact that Alston had on Harlem and the African-American community: [...] "'was a consummate artist and a voice in the development of African American art who never doubted the excellence of all people's sensitivity and creative ability. During his long professional career, Alston significantly enriched the cultural life of Harlem. In a profound sense, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> built bridges between Black artists in varying fields, and between other Americans." [...] Writer June Jordan described Alston as [...] "an American artist of first magnitude, and he is a Black American artist of undisturbed integrity." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1983 Dahl {{reviewed}} Tony Clifton's God Cried, {{a picture}} {{book about the}} siege of West Beirut by the Israeli army during the 1982 Lebanon War. Dahl's review stated that the book would make readers [...] "violently anti-Israeli", writing, [...] "I am not anti-Semitic. I am anti-Israel." [...] Dahl told a reporter in 1983, [...] "There's a trait in the Jewish character that does provoke animosity ... I mean {{there is always a}} reason why anti-anything crops up anywhere; even a stinker like Hitler didn't just pick on them for no reason." [...] Dahl maintained friendships with a number of Jews, including philosopher Sir Isaiah Berlin, who said, [...] "I thought he might say anything. Could have been pro-Arab or pro-Jew. There was no consistent line. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> followed whims, which meant he would blow up in one direction, so to speak." [...] Amelia Foster, director of the Roald Dahl Museum in Great Missenden, states, [...] "This is again an example of how Dahl refused to take anything seriously, even himself. He was very angry at the Israelis. He had a childish reaction {{to what was going on}} in Israel. Dahl wanted to provoke, as he always provoked at dinner. His publisher was a Jew, his agent was a Jew... and he thought nothing but good things of them. He asked me to be his managing director, and I'm Jewish." ...|$|E
2500|$|At 21:04 (UTC+3), on 8 June 2016, two {{perpetrators}} {{dressed in}} suits and ties {{arrived at the}} Max Brenner Cafe in the Sarona Market complex near HaArba'a Street in Tel Aviv. They inspected the area and then sat down on chairs outside, ordering desserts. At 21:27 the perpetrators stood up and fired at the diners until one of the perpetrators' firearms jammed. He slammed the firearm {{on the floor and}} the perpetrators started to run away from the site. The perpetrators wounded 11 people. Four were critically wounded, and later succumbed to their wounds. Two others were in severe condition, two in moderate condition and four in light condition. An additional 14 people suffering from symptoms of anxiety received medical attention at the scene and at the hospitals. The two did not have an escape plan, an official of the Israel Security Agency said, after investigation, that they [...] "trusted in Allah". The perpetrators fled and split up, and at 21:40, one of the perpetrators was wounded and neutralized after a gunfight with a civil guard of Kol Yisrael and was taken to Ichilov Hospital in serious condition. The other unarmed perpetrator ran in a nearby street, near the Tel Aviv Cinematheque. He encountered an off-duty policeman (who was in plainclothes) and asked him for a glass of water and the unsuspecting policeman invited him into his home with his family. The man then rushed {{to the scene of the}} attack, leaving the perpetrator in his home. The family tried to speak to the perpetrator but he didn't respond and was stressed. The wife of the policeman said she didn't suspect anything and that she thought <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> ran from the attack. When the policeman saw the other perpetrator was dressed just like the man he invited into his home, he rushed back to his home and captured the perpetrator who tried to escape. While arresting him, one of the policemen called in to help entered the home with his weapon drawn. When he saw that the perpetrator was already captured, he returned his weapon to its sheath, at which point it discharged a bullet and one of the policemen was wounded from shrapnel.|$|E
