40|$|It is well {{recognized}} {{that there is}} a treatment gap in the management of risk factors in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) - a gap between what is known from published evidence and what is actually practiced. Strategies to address the treatment gap have usually been aimed at the physician and these have often been ineffective. Few strategies have been directed at the patient. Patient-targeted strategies can be subdivided into those that permit the prescribing of medication by allied health professionals and those where allied health staff do not have prescribing rights. Although intuitively it may appear that any program providing attention to patients would result in improvements in risk-factor levels, published work shows that the programs that allow the prescription of drugs have all resulted in significant improvement in coronary risk factor status. By contrast, {{all but one of the}} non-drug prescribing programs failed to improve the risk factor status. The COACH (Coaching patients On Achieving Cardiovascular Health) Program is a novel program using non-drug prescribing health professionals to achieve the target levels for all of the modifiable risk factors in patients with CHD. The COACH Program is a training program for patients with CHD in which a health professional coach trains patients to aggressively pursue the target levels for their particular coronary risk factors. The coach is hospital-based and uses the telephone and mailouts to provide regular coaching sessions to patients after discharge from <b>hospital.</b> <b>Coaching</b> is directed at the patient and not at the treating doctor. Patients are coached to know their risk-factor levels, the target levels for their risk factors, and how to achieve the target levels for their risk factors. Patients are persuaded to go to their own doctor(s) and ask for appropriate prescription of medication(s). Coaching also trains patients to follow appropriate lifestyle measures. The COACH Program has been validated by two randomized controlled trials. The first was a pilot, single-center study in which one coach targeted serum cholesterol as an outcome. Having established the success of the method, a definitive multicenter study was performed in six hospitals, each with its own trained coach, which aimed to improve lipid and other risk factors. This study confirmed that coaching was an independent and significant factor in lowering total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. In addition, coaching resulted in a lower blood pressure, lower intake of dietary saturated fat, lower bodyweight, less anxiety, improved self-perception of health, and lesser symptoms of chest pain and breathlessness at 6 -month follow-up. The COACH Program is a proven, highly effective method of using health professionals, who do not have the authority to prescribe medication, to improve risk status in patients with CHD.

40|$|Aim: To {{identify}} {{barriers to}} medication adherence in chronic heart failure patients during home visits; {{and to find}} solutions to address medication non-adherence. Method: This was an observational study of home visits by the chronic heart failure pharmacist that was made after referral from a multidisciplinary chronic heart failure service. The reasons for medication non-adherence and solutions to overcome them were recorded in 66 consecutive chronic heart failure patients. Barriers to medication adherence and subsequent interventions (education, counselling, motivational interviews), hospital readmissions, length of stay, mortality and cause of death were analysed 3 months after the first home visit. Results: Main reasons for medication non-adherence were poor and/or complex medication instructions (71 %), running out of medications (33 %) and adverse drug reactions (20 %). Interventions included education and counselling (100 %), reducing dosing frequency (64 %) and introducing dose administration aids (32 %). 10 complex chronic heart failure patients (15 %) required multiple home visits, motivational interviews and telephone <b>coaching.</b> <b>Hospital</b> readmissions, average length of stay for readmissions and deaths due to chronic heart failure 3 months after the first home visit were 4. 5 %, 6. 3 days and 3 %, respectively. Conclusion: Multiple strategies were necessary to overcome barriers to medication adherence in chronic heart failure patients. Home visits by the pharmacist optimised medication adherence, thus potentially minimising unplanned hospital admissions. J Pharm Pract Res 2010; 40 : 27 - 30...|$|R
5000|$|The {{role was}} {{originated}} by daytime newcomer, Tyler Christopher {{then known as}} Tyler Baker on July 15, 1996. Christopher tried to audition {{for the role of}} Stone Cates in 1993 but was turned away. In April 1996, Christopher was one of several actors to audition for casting director Mark Teschner. Christopher hired an acting coach to prepare him for the audition and worked regularly with General <b>Hospital's</b> onset acting <b>coach,</b> John Homa. In June 1996, Christopher received a call back to read for executive producer Wendy Riche and was later brought back to screen test with several actors, including Stephen Nichols who would play Stefan. Christopher was hired two days later, signed a three-year contract and filmed his first scenes in late June 1996. In May 1999, rumors circulated that Christopher would not renew his contract which was set to expire in June. The series had also put out a casting call for an actor similar to Christopher which meant he could potentially be replaced. By the time of Christopher's departure, Nikolas had become integral to the series, a recast was very much needed and Christopher was immediately replaced by Colton Scott. Of his casting, Scott said remembered that viewers didn't have any warning. [...] "Tyler was there Monday, and I came in on Tuesday" [...] he said. Though inexperienced, Scott was immediately put the test opposite Nichols, Geary and Francis so he got [...] "very comfortable very quickly." [...] After a year without finding work, Scott's mother wanted him to come home. And he promised her he would he'd get a job in six months. Scott booked the role of Nikolas six months to the day of his promise to his mother. In late March 2003, Scott would vacate the role in the summer of 2003 after failed contract negotiations. According to his official web site, Scott was very upset by the decisions made. At the same time, Christopher also became available {{at the same time and}} it was an opportunity the series couldn't pass up, revealed executive producer, Jill Farren Phelps. In November 2005, Tyler Christopher underwent surgery for a broken arm and Chris Beetem served as a temporary recast starting on December 6 and lasting five episodes.|$|R
40|$|Background: A major national-to-local {{healthcare}} {{quality and}} safety {{goal is to}} reduce hospital readmissions, which are considered preventable patient harm. While the literature shows the impact of using care transitions programs to reduce readmissions, few studies have utilized faith community nurses (FCNs) within care transition programs. An FCN-integrated care transitions program potentially could help fill the gap in community clinical support for chronic illness care. Saint Alphonsus Regional Medical Center (SARMC), a Catholic hospital in Boise, Idaho, sponsors an FCN network within many Southwest Idaho faith communities. This presented a local opportunity to create and test the feasibility of an FCN-integrated care transition pathway, using an evidence-based practice model such as the Care Transitions Intervention (CTI), to impact patient experience and outcomes post-discharge. The purpose of this project was to evaluate the feasibility of using FCNs as <b>hospital</b> CTI Transition <b>Coaches</b> and illuminate facilitators and barriers to their work. Methods: Three FCNs trained to intervene with a targeted group of orthopedic patients, using the CTI model and protocol resources for Care Transitions Coaches, which included a 30 -day patient engagement of a hospital contact, a home visit, and three phone calls. Primary outcomes were to implement an FCN-integrated CTI program, to evaluate both the effectiveness and satisfaction of the FCNs as Transition Coaches, and to quantify adequacy of the hospital support in fulfilling the CTI work and give voice to the facilitators and barriers to FCN-CTI care delivery. Results: Feasibility evaluation was determined by if the CTI model could be implemented using FCNs. Over the time period of August 2015 to January, 2016, 24 patients, aged 65 and older, having total hip or knee surgeries, were enrolled as participants in the project. The FCNs completed the 30 -day CTI follow-up protocol with 18 patients (75 %) with 100 % of the protocol documentation completed (18 / 18 checklist forms), 100 % protocol visits accomplished (90 / 90), and 100 % of Patient Activation Assessments were performed (72 / 72). FCNs reported 99 % of the time (71 / 72 assessment visits) having the resources needed for Coaching. Key facilitators for effective Coaching included a project coordinator to help the FCNs navigate the hospital system and effective communication strategies with staff and providers. Barriers highlighted by the FCNs included poor usability of the personal health record tool, confusing discharge instructions, and challenges with coordinating hospital visits before discharge. The FCNs appeared satisfied that the Transition Coach role falls within FCN scope and standards of practice. They also found the stipend to be a beneficial incentive. Conclusions: Healthcare delivery is transforming from hospital-focused care to community-based care. Providing care transitions resources to ensure healing after hospital discharge and prevent unnecessary readmissions benefits patients and hospitals. This project demonstrated that FCNs can be effective Transition Coaches and successfully implement the CTI model. Although often in unpaid roles in faith communities, the FCNs in this project were remunerated with a stipend. FCNs performing care transitions should be compensated for this value-based work, a trend that will likely be more common as reimbursement for care transitions grows in payer practices...|$|R
