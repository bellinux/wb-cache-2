40|$|The {{need for}} {{replacing}} lead based solder has received great attention among researchers {{because of their}} toxicity. The Sn-Ag-Cu family is the most promising candidate. However, these solder systems need better improvement in terms of controlling their intermetallic formation, growth rate and also their mechanical properties. In this study, the Sn- 3. 5 Ag-l. 0 Cu solder was studied and three different amounts of Zn were added into the solder system. The solder was prepared using powder metallurgy method. It was characterized for their melting temperature, hardness and density. For intermetallic study, the solder was melted at 250 °C on a Cu substrate and placed in an oven at 150 °C until 1000 h. After the aging process, the solder joint was cross-sectioned and analysed under a Scanning Electron Microscope and Energy Dispersive X-ray. The thickness of Cu₆Sn₅ and Cu₃ Sn intermetallics were measured using image J software and their growths kinetic were calculated. The shear <b>joint</b> specimen was <b>aged</b> until 1000 h and the joint strength test was performed using an Instron machine. The addition of Zn has no significant effect on their melting temperature. Density and hardness {{results show that the}} optimum condition in preparation of solder disc was 2 h is mixing time and 14 MPa pressure. The addition of Zn retarded the growth of the intermetallic with 0. 4 wt. % Zn gives the most significant values compared to 0. 1 and 0. 7 wt. % Zn addition. The growth of intermetallic compounds followed a parabolic law, implying that the growth of the intermetallic layer was diffusion control. The addition of 0. 4 wt. % Zn gives the smallest growth constant (k) which are 0. 16 x 10 ⁻¹⁴, 2. 56 x 10 ⁻¹⁴ and 4. 00 x 10 ⁻¹⁴ cm²/s for Cu₆Sn₅, Cu₃Sn and total intermetallic, respectively. Smaller k value indicates that the growth of intermetallic was slower and thus Zn retards the intermetallic growth. The decreasing of solder <b>joint</b> strength as <b>aging</b> <b>time</b> increases can be correlated to the growth of the intermetallic.

On the other hand, fracture elongation shows an opposite trend, suggesting that at <b>aging</b> <b>times</b> above 18 ks, over aging occurs. (2) The fatigue strength lowers with increasing <b>aging</b> <b>time,</b> however, when the <b>aging</b> <b>time</b> is more than 18 ks at 473 K, the fatigue strength remains almost the same.

However, this matter is undertaken perfectly in the present study.

By accepting this procedure, the general model was run with consideration of 4 days and 10 days <b>aging</b> <b>time.</b> Figure  12 presents the value of oil recovery for three models which are run with the <b>aging</b> <b>time</b> of 0, 4, and 10 days, respectively.

For instance, the well water cut is approximately equal for all three models and {{it is a little bit}} larger for the model with 10 days <b>aging</b> <b>time</b> because wettability alteration occurs later. The possible reason for this result may be attributed to the large simulation time which leads the effect of delay in wettability alteration process to be disappeared.

40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the quality characteristics of fermented wine using Nuruk according {{to the type of}} aging container (jar or stainless container) and <b>aging</b> <b>time.</b> Alcohol analysis was initiated at 40. 4 ～ 39. 3 %, and alcohol contents in the jar and stainless container decreased as <b>aging</b> <b>time</b> increased. Volatile acid content slightly increased in the reduced pressure (RP) jar and stainless container and showed a different result in the atmospheric pressure (AP) container. Amount of acetic acid did not change either in the jar or stainless container as <b>aging</b> <b>time</b> increased. In the case of 2 -thiobarbituric acid (TBA), RP was lower than AP after distillation, and TBA value did not change much either in the jar or stainless container. In the case of fusel alcohol by <b>aging</b> <b>time,</b> n-propanol content did not increase either in the jar or stainless container as <b>aging</b> <b>time</b> increased. Iso-butanol content was reduced in the jar but did not change in the stainless container. In the AP container, more aromatic components were measured on the 180 th day of <b>aging</b> <b>time</b> than after distillation. High boiling point aromatic components increased in particular. In the stainless container, more aromatic components were generated on the 180 th day of aging, but their amount was relatively lower than in the jar. In the jar aging sensory test, the sensory score at RP 50 cmHg was highes...|$|R

40|$|The present {{experimental}} investigation aims {{to investigate}} the effect of salt-fog exposition on the mechanical behaviour of composite/metal riveted joints. To this aim, two kinds of joint were exposed to salt-fog environmental conditions according to ASTM B 117 standard, for fifteen weeks. In particular, two composite laminates (i. e. glass fibre and carbon fibre/epoxy composites) were used as composite substrate joined with the metal substrate (i. e. aluminium alloy Al 6060). Single-lap shear tests were carried out in order to evaluate {{the evolution of the}} mechanical performances and the damage mechanisms of the riveted <b>joints</b> during the <b>ageing</b> exposition. The results evidence that the mechanical performances (i. e. maximum load and load-displacement slope) of the hybrid joints progressively decrease at increasing <b>ageing</b> <b>time</b> in the considered exposure time. Moreover, glass fibre/epoxy hybrid composite joint showed a higher sensitivity to degradation in salt-fog environmental condition than carbon fibre/epoxy one. As concerns the damage mechanisms, glass fibre/epoxy hybrid composite joint experienced catastrophic cleavage/net tension failure modes regardless the <b>ageing</b> <b>time</b> whereas the progressive bearing failure was the mechanism observed in carbon fibre/epoxy hybrid composite joint during the entire experimental campaign. Corrosion phenomena not significantly affected degradation performances of both joints...|$|R
