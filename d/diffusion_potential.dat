5000|$|Bernstein's {{work was}} {{concentrated}} {{in the fields of}} neurobiology and biophysics. He is largely recognized for his [...] "membrane hypothesis" [...] in regards to the origin of the [...] "resting potential" [...] and the [...] "action potential" [...] in the nerve. Bernstein (1902, 1912) correctly proposed that excitable cells are surrounded by a membrane selectively permeable to K+ ions at rest and that during excitation the membrane permeability to other ions increases. His [...] "membrane hypothesis" [...] explained the resting potential of nerve and muscle as a <b>diffusion</b> <b>potential</b> set up by the tendency of positively charged ions to diffuse from their high concentration in cytoplasm to their low concentration in the extracellular solution while other ions are held back. During excitation, the internal negativity would be lost transiently as other ions are allowed to diffuse across the membrane, effectively short-circuiting the K+ <b>diffusion</b> <b>potential.</b> In the English-language literature, the words [...] "membrane breakdown" [...] were used to describe Bernstein's view of excitation.

In contrast to conventional diffusion cell setups, the experimental approach was based on embedded ion selective electrodes. A numerical model with coupled Nernst-Planck equations for the most abundant species in the pore solution allowed simulating ion transport processes and the correspondingly arising <b>diffusion</b> <b>potentials.</b> It was found that Portland cement mortar with a water/cement ratio of 0. 6 does not exhibit any significant permselective behaviour – even not in an unsaturated state determined by self-desiccation. Apparently, the stable radius of water-filled capillaries is still large enough to allow ionic transport through those fractions of pore solution that are unaffected by double layer effects.

More specifically, combined effects due to the electrochemical and the thermal <b>diffusion</b> <b>potentials</b> are investigated. A theoretical framework for coupling thermal diffusion, i. e. the Soret effect, with electrochemical diffusion in a multi-ionic system is provided. An explicit form of a definition for the thermal diffusion coefficient in a multicomponent chemical transport model is developed. Chemical transport is linked to an advanced geochemical model, PHREEQC (version 2), in order to include chemical reactions. The effects of the combined <b>diffusion</b> <b>potentials</b> on the reactive transport of multicomponent chemicals are investigated by a series of numerical simulations of coupled thermal, hydraulic and chemical behaviour...|$|R
50|$|Liquid {{junction}} potential {{occurs when}} two electrolytic solutions of different concentrations are {{in contact with}} each other. The more concentrated solution will {{have a tendency to}} diffuse into the comparatively less concentrated one. The rate of diffusion of each ion will be roughly proportional to its speed in an electric field. If the anions diffuse more rapidly than the cations, they will diffuse ahead into the dilute solution, leaving the latter negatively charged and the concentrated solution positively charged. This will result in an electrical double layer of positive and negative charges at the junction of the two solutions. Thus at the point of junction, a potential difference will develop because of the ionic transfer. This potential is called liquid junction potential or <b>diffusion</b> <b>potential</b> which is non-equilibrium potential. The magnitude of the potential depends on the relative speeds of the ions' movement.|$|E
5000|$|The resting {{membrane}} potential {{is not an}} equilibrium potential as it relies on the constant expenditure of energy (for ionic pumps as mentioned above) for its maintenance. It is a dynamic <b>diffusion</b> <b>potential</b> that takes this mechanism into account - wholly unlike the equilibrium potential, which is true no matter {{the nature of the}} system under consideration. The resting {{membrane potential}} is dominated by the ionic species in the system that has the greatest conductance across the membrane. For most cells this is potassium. As potassium is also the ion with the most negative equilibrium potential, usually the resting potential can be no more negative than the potassium equilibrium potential. The resting potential can be calculated with the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz voltage equation using the concentrations of ions as for the equilibrium potential while also including the relative permeabilities of each ionic species. Under normal conditions, it is safe to assume that only potassium, sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl−) ions play large roles for the resting potential: ...|$|E

40|$|Overpotentials {{induced by}} liquid-phase {{composition}} variation can be important when electrochemical devices are operated at high current. The dominant models that describe such ‘diffusion potentials’ are Nernst–Planck (dilute-solution) theory and Onsager–Stefan–Maxwell (concentrated-solution) theory. Nernst–Planck flux laws emerge from Onsager–Stefan–Maxwell {{laws in the}} limit of high electrolyte dilution, and the material properties involved come into agreement. The two models yield different expressions for <b>diffusion</b> <b>potentials</b> in the dilute limit, however, because of a disparity in how electric potential is defined. As applied to lithiumion batteries, concentrated-solution theory employs a voltage measured by a reference electrode reversible to lithium cations; this provides an unambiguous connection to a measurement process, albeit hypothetical on a local scale. After the Nernst–Planck voltage is related to such a properly referenced voltage, the discrepancy in <b>diffusion</b> <b>potentials</b> vanishes. The impact of using Nernst–Planck voltages instead of measurable voltages is illustrated by simulations of a lithium-ion battery. Terminal-to-terminal voltage is relatively unaffected, but the thermal response and internal states change significantly...|$|R

In this paper, the improved C–V measurement is used to characterize the band offsets in a-Si:H/c-Si heterojunctions with a good precision.

Uptake after prolonged incubation periods was osmotically insensitive and represented almost exclusively binding to the vesicles. Extrapolating initial linear uptake to a zero incubation time indicated no binding of the amino acid to the external membrane surface. Sodium did not significantly alter the initial uptake rate. L-Lysine transport represents a carrier mediated uptake in the presence and absence of sodium {{as indicated by the}} transstimulation experiments. The transport mechanism operates stereospecifically and is inhibited by other basic amino acids and L-leucine and L-phenylalanine.

40|$|In the presentarticle, a {{novel model}} of {{artificial}} membranes that provides efficientassistance in teaching {{the origins of}} <b>diffusion</b> <b>potentials</b> is proposed. These membranes are made of polycarbonate filters fixed to 12 -mmplastic rings and then saturated {{with a mixture of}} creosol and n-decane. The electrical resistance and potential difference across these membranescan be easily measured using a low-cost volt-ohm meter and home-madeAg/AgCl electrodes. The advantage of the model is the lack of ionicselectivity of the membrane, which can be modified by the introductionof different ionophores to the organic liquid mixture. A membrane treatedwith the mixture containing valinomycin generates voltages from - 53 to - 25 mV {{in the presence of a}} 10 -fold KCl gradient (in to out) and from- 79 to - 53 mV in the presence of a bi-ionic KCl/NaCl gradient (in toout). This latter bi-ionic gradient potential reverses to a value from + 9 to + 20 mV when monensin is present in the organic liquid mixture. Thus,the model can be build stepwise, i. e. all factors leading to the developmentof <b>diffusion</b> <b>potentials</b> can be introduced sequentially, helpingstudents to understand the quantitative relationships of ionic gradients anddifferential membrane permeability in the generation of cell electrical signals. © 2013 The American Physiological Society.

Studies of the potential step observed at the serosal boundary in the open-circuited state were undertaken {{in an attempt to}} define the factors responsible for its production. Glass micropipettes were used to measure the serosal potential step in bladders exposed on the serosal side to solutions of high potassium or of high potassium and low chloride concentration. Observed potentials exceed the maximum values which would have been expected if the serosal potential step were a potassium or chloride <b>diffusion</b> <b>potential.</b> Measurements of net cation flux exclude the possibility of a <b>diffusion</b> <b>potential</b> at this border due to the passive movement of any anionic species. The observed independence of transbladder potential and short-circuit current from the pH of the serosal medium over a wide range of pH makes it unlikely that the observed serosal potential step is a hydrogen ion <b>diffusion</b> <b>potential.</b> We conclude that the active sodium transport mechanism in toad bladder is "electrogenic.

Compositions of isotonic media have been devised in which the equilibrium Donnan potential, E, varies at constant pHc and in which pHc varies at constant E. Dye fluorescence measurements in these suspensions yield calibrations of + 1. 7 % delta F/mV for diS-C 3 (5) and + 0. 6 % delta F/mV for diI-C 3 (5). While pHo does not affect F of either dye, changes in pHc of 0. 1 unit at constant E cause changes of F equivalent to those induced by 2 [...] 3 mV. Based on these results, a method is given for estimating changes in E from dye fluorescence in experiments in which E and pHc co-vary. The relation of F to E also depends in a complex way on the type and concentration of cells and dye, and the wavelengths employed.
