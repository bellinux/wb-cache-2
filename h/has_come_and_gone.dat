25|$|In March 2014, it was {{announced}} that a Live in Milan CD and DVD package would be released, similar to that of Live in Amsterdam and Live at Wembley before it, documenting a live show from their recent Fortress Tour. It was set for release in June 2014, although the date <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>gone</b> without the release or an official statement. However, Tremonti's brother Michael, who is Alter Bridge's fan liaison, stated on Twitter that the DVD was scrapped due to sound issues.|$|E

25|$|The British Rallycross Grand Prix <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>gone</b> {{in recent}} years, {{but none of}} the modern incarnations have come close to the 'real' Grand Prix, the {{versions}} of the event run at Brands Hatch between 1982 and 1994. The Rallycross Grand Prix was, in essence, an open-house, end of season, free for all. If you had a Rallycross car and fancied racing in the Grand Prix, you could make your entry and have a go. This led to some wonderful events and the chance to see unusual cars and star drivers; Denis Marcel's beautiful Matra Murena, unlikely and surprisingly fast NSUs from Norway, Stig Blomqvist wheeling out his privately owned Audi Quattro, sportscar ace Cor Euser doing a great job in a MG Metro 6R4, etc. The Grand Prix was different; it stood out from the crowd and appealed to competitors because it wasn’t just another event. Being Brands Hatch helped, geographically it was good and the circuit put all of its marketing and PR effort into making something of the event.|$|E

500|$|Kīlauea {{has a large}} summit caldera, {{measuring}} [...] with walls up to [...] high, breached by {{lava flows}} on the southwestern side. It is unknown if the caldera was always there {{or if it is}} a relatively recent feature, and it is possible that it <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>gone</b> throughout Kīlauea's eruptive history; what is known is that it likely formed over several centuries, with its construction estimated to have begun about 500 years ago, and that its present form was finalized by a particularly powerful eruption in 1790. A major feature within the caldera is Halemaumau Crater, a large pit crater and one of Kīlauea's most historically active eruption centers. The crater is approximately [...] in diameter and [...] deep, but its form has varied widely through its eruptive history; the floor of the Halemaumau Crater is now mostly covered by flows from its most recent eruption, in 1974.|$|E
