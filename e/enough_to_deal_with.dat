The vampire later explains to Gordon that hunters killed his nest, and {{now he wants to}} rebuild his family. Though Dixon had planned on using Gordon as food, the hunter's continuous taunting prompts him to feed him his blood.

5|$|With {{war with}} Germany now a reality, Menzies sent Richard Casey to London to seek reassurances about the defence of Australia {{in the event}} that Australian forces were sent to Europe or the Middle East. In November, Australia and New Zealand were given reassurances that Singapore {{would not be allowed to}} fall, and that in the event of war with Japan, the defence of the Far East would take {{priority}} over the Mediterranean. This seemed possible as the Kriegsmarine, the German navy, was relatively small and France was an ally. Bruce, now Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, and Casey met with British Cabinet ministers on 20 November and left with the impression that, despite the reassurances, the Royal Navy was not strong <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> simultaneous crises in Europe, the Mediterranean and the Far East.|$|E
5|$|The story's {{main part}} {{takes place in}} {{what seems to be}} a normal high school, but in fact all took place in the school term {{previous}} to Little Busters!, and Riki and Rin are reliving it in an artificial world created by the other members of the Little Busters. They, and the other main characters, were involved in a bus accident during a field trip, and only the two of them will survive. Kyousuke and the others created the artificial world to make them strong <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> what will happen when they awaken in the real world. This was caused by a ripple effect based on all of their desires to save Riki and Rin. The world loops, but though they forget what happens, Riki and Rin do grow stronger, and Kyousuke hopes that they will eventually be strong enough to leave the world. They do manage to survive and get away from the crash site before Riki collapses because he has narcolepsy. Riki vows to fight against his narcoleptic condition, which was the reason why he was only able to save Rin and merely get away from the explosion before collapsing.|$|E

25|$|West Midlands Police {{struggled}} {{to operate on}} the estate due to recurring incidents and also incidents where officers were attacked by youths. The lack of law enforcement led to the residents feeling intimidated and helpless on the estate. In the 1980s, the police tried an alternative approach called Community Policing where hot spots for crime were tackled with more officers. The scheme received national attention but was considered to not be drastic <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> the problems on the estate. By 1992, 41% of residents said they were victims of crime and 55% said they were afraid to go out at night.|$|E
25|$|Despite the win, and two wins in the NASCAR Busch Series in 1988 and 1989 {{driving for}} Highline Racing, Hillin's career took a downturn; {{he would later}} say he was not mature <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> the {{pressures}} of being a NASCAR winner. He left the Stavola Brothers team after the 1990 season; he started the 1991 season qualifying a backup car for Moroso Racing fastest in third-round time trials for the Daytona 500. A seventh-place finish in the 500 won Hillin the team's regular ride, however after ten races a lack of sponsorship forced the team to cut back its schedule, and Hillin was released; After two races with Jimmy Means Racing, Hillin was named as substitute driver for Kyle Petty, who had broken his leg {{earlier in the year}} in a wreck at Talladega; he drove eight races in the Team SABCO No. 42 before Petty returned.|$|E

500|$|By 1990, the L/44 was not {{considered}} powerful <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> future Soviet armour, which stimulated an effort by Rheinmetall to develop a better main armament. This first involved a [...] tank gun named Neue Panzerkanone 140 ("new tank gun 140"), but later turned into a compromise {{which led to the}} development of an advanced 120mm gun, the L/55, based on the same internal geometry as the L/44 and installed in the same breech and mount. The L/55 is [...] longer, giving increased muzzle velocity to ammunition fired through it. As the L/55 retains the same barrel geometry, it can fire the same ammunition as the L/44.|$|E
500|$|Noel Murray from The A.V. Club graded {{the episode}} with an A-; he praised the [...] "fine job" [...] of director/writer Akiva Goldsman, and thought the climax was [...] "extraordinarily well-shot and performed". IGN's Ramsey Isler rated the episode 9.2/10, writing that it [...] "is {{a classic example}} of a story you have to be patient with. This was an episode with a compelling, {{shocking}} start that kept us hooked well <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> some slow points {{in the rest of the}} first half-hour.

500|$|Nonetheless, the {{treaties}} were also subject to {{past and present}} criticism. The countries subject to {{the treaties}} saw it as limiting their sovereignty and infringing their right for self-determination, as the League was allowed to influence national, religious and educational policy in those countries, and suggesting {{that they were not}} competent <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> their internal matters. Further criticism centered on the treaties not being obligatory for the established countries (like France, Germany, United Kingdom or Russia). The Western countries, who dictated the treaties {{in the aftermath of the}} First World War, saw minority safeguards as unnecessary for themselves, and trusted that they could fulfill the [...] "standard of civilization". It was the new Central and Eastern European countries that were not trusted to respect those rights, and, of course, Bolshevik Russia, still in the throes of the Russian Revolution, was a separate case.|$|E
500|$|The {{experience}} of the M3 in the North African Campaign was completely different. The gun was not powerful <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> late production German Panzer III and IV tanks. After the nearly disastrous Battle of Kasserine Pass in February 1943, reports {{from some of the}} involved units mentioned 37mm projectiles [...] "bouncing off like marbles" [...] from the turret and front armor of German medium tanks and proclaimed the gun [...] "useless unless you have gun crews with the guts to stand and shoot from 100yards". The Army was initially uncertain if these reports reflected the obsolescence of the weapon, or whether unrefined tactics and lack of experience were to blame. Yet, on 26 May 1943, a new organization had the M3 replaced by the 57mm Gun M1 (the U.S.-produced version of the British 6-pounder gun), with Dodge 1½ ton trucks as prime movers. Only by spring 1944 did the 57mm gun reach the battlefield in large numbers.|$|E
500|$|Unlike Stewart, who {{essentially}} hosted The Daily Show as himself, Colbert {{developed a}} correspondent character for his {{pieces on the}} series. Colbert has described his correspondent character as [...] "a fool who has {{spent a lot of}} his life playing not the fool– one who is able to cover it at least well <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> the subjects that he deals with". Colbert was frequently pitted against knowledgeable interview subjects, or against Stewart in scripted exchanges, with the resultant dialogue demonstrating the character's lack of knowledge of whatever subject he is discussing. Colbert also made generous use of humorous fallacies of logic in explaining his point of view on any topic. Other Daily Show correspondents have adopted a similar style; former correspondent Rob Corddry recalls that when he and Ed Helms first joined the show's cast in 2002, they [...] "just imitated Stephen Colbert for a year or two". Correspondent Aasif Mandvi has stated [...] "I just decided I was going to do my best Stephen Colbert impression".|$|E
50|$|Only in {{the spring}} of 366 had Valens {{assembled}} <b>enough</b> troops <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> Procopius effectively. Marching out from Ancyra through Pessinus, Valens proceeded into Phrygia where he defeated Procopius's general Gomoarius at the Battle of Thyatira. He then met Procopius himself at Nacoleia and convinced his troops to desert him. Procopius was executed on 27 May and his head sent to Valentinian in Trier for inspection.|$|R
50|$|The EdB was {{established}} on 24 August 1998 {{in compliance with}} the deposit and depositor protection law (EAEG).

In 2008 the fund did not have <b>enough</b> assets <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> the claims resulting from Lehman Brothers and the German state stepped in by providing a SoFFin guarantee enabling the institution to raise 6.7 Billion Euros on the bond market.|$|R
5000|$|Planners {{claim the}} Battlegroups have <b>enough</b> range <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> all those tasks, {{although}} such tasks {{ought to be}} limited in [...] "size and intensity" [...] due to the small nature of the groups. Such missions may include conflict prevention, evacuation, aid deliverance or initial stabilisation. In general these would fall into three categories; brief support of existing troops, rapid deployment preparing the ground for larger forces or small-scale rapid response missions.|$|R
500|$|The Quadrophenia tour {{started in}} Stoke on Trent in October and was {{immediately}} beset with problems. Daltrey resisted Townshend's wish to add Joe Cocker's keyboardist Chris Stainton (who played on the album) to the touring band. As a compromise, Townshend assembled the keyboard and synthesizer parts on backing tapes, as such a strategy had been successful with [...] "Baba O'Riley" [...] and [...] "Won't Get Fooled Again". Unfortunately, the technology was not sophisticated <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> {{the demands of the}} music; added to this issue, tour rehearsals had been interrupted due to an argument that culminated in Daltrey punching Townshend and knocking him out cold. At a gig in Newcastle, the tapes completely malfunctioned, and an enraged Townshend dragged sound-man Bob Pridden on-stage, screamed at him, kicked all the amps over and partially destroyed the backing tapes. The show was abandoned for an [...] "oldies" [...] set, {{at the end of which}} Townshend smashed his guitar and Moon kicked over his drumkit. The Independent described this gig as one of the worst of all time. The US tour started on 20 November at the Cow Palace in Daly City, California; Moon passed out during [...] "Won't Get Fooled Again" [...] and during [...] "Magic Bus". Townshend asked the audience, [...] "Can anyone play the drums?—I mean somebody good." [...] An audience member, Scot Halpin, filled in for the rest of the show. After a show in Montreal, the band (except for Daltrey, who retired to bed early) caused so much damage to their hotel room, including destroying an antique painting and ramming a marble table through a wall, that federal law enforcement arrested them.|$|E
2500|$|The {{controversy}} {{sparked a}} debate over press standards in Ireland, with the Labour Party Senator Kathleen O'Meara calling {{for the establishment of}} a Press Council to monitor standards in the print media. The then Minister for Justice, Michael McDowell, stated that the print media coverage of Mr Lawlor's death was [...] "grossly offensive, cruel and lacking in foundation and fact", and that defamation was not <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> this kind of posthumous coverage. He said that legislation was being drafted to establish an appropriate press complaints council.|$|E
2500|$|After the 11 September {{terrorist}} {{attacks against the}} United States, the UK Parliament was recalled, and a solemn five-hour emergency sitting of the House of Commons debated the crisis. Jonathan Sayeed said that military might alone would not be <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> the problem. [...] "There {{has to be some}} understanding why there is such hatred for so many institutions within the United States. Unless we deal with some of the deep-seated causes, then more terrorists will come to the fore."

2500|$|Gray was {{especially}} {{critical of the}} justice system, which he saw as not doing <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> criminals. Thus, some of his storylines featured people taking the law into their own hands. This happened as early as 1927 in an adventure named [...] "The Haunted House". Annie is kidnapped by a gangster called Mister Mack. Warbucks rescues her and takes Mack and his gang into custody. He then contacts a local senator who owes him a favor. Warbucks persuades the politician to use his influence with the judge {{and make sure that}} the trial goes their way and that Mack and his men get their just deserts. Annie questions the use of such methods but concludes, [...] "With all th' crooks usin' pull an' money to get off, I guess 'bout th' only way to get 'em punished is for honest police like Daddy to use pull an' money an' gun-men, too, an' beat them at their own game." ...|$|E
2500|$|The focus {{areas for}} global warming {{politics}} are Adaptation, Mitigation, Finance, Technology and Losses which are well quantified and studied but {{the urgency of}} the global warming challenge combined with the implication to almost every facet of a nation-state's economic interests places significant burdens on the established largely-voluntary global institutions that have developed over the last century; institutions that have been unable to effectively reshape themselves and move fast <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> this unique challenge. [...] Rapidly developing countries who see traditional energy sources as a means to fuel their development, well funded aggressive environmental lobbying groups and an established fossil fuel energy paradigm boasting a mature and sophisticated political lobbying infrastructure all combine to make global warming politics extremely polarized. [...] Distrust between developed and developing countries at most international conferences that seek to address the topic add to the challenges. [...] Further adding to the complexity is the advent of the Internet and the development of media technologies like blogs and other mechanisms for disseminating information that enable the exponential growth in production and dissemination of competing points of view which make it nearly impossible for the development and dissemination of an objective view into the enormity of the subject matter and its politics.|$|E
2500|$|Long also {{suspected}} that Titanics breakup {{may have begun}} with the premature failure of the ship's after expansion joint, and ultimately exacerbated {{the loss of life}} by causing Titanic to sink faster than anticipated. In 2006, the History Channel sponsored dives on Titanics younger sister ship, , which verified that the design of Britannics expansion joints was superior to that incorporated in the Titanic. To further explore Long's theory, the History Channel commissioned a new computer simulation by JMS Engineering. The simulation, whose results were featured in the 2007 documentary Titanic's Achilles Heel, partially refuted Long's suspicions by demonstrating that Titanics expansion joints were strong <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> any and all stresses the ship could reasonably be expected to encounter in service and, during the sinking, actually outperformed their design specifications. But, most important is that the expansion joints were part of the superstructure, which was situated above the strength deck (B-deck) and therefore above the top of the structural hull girder. Thus, the expansion joints had no meaning for the support of the hull. [...] They played no role in the breaking of the hull. [...] They simply opened up and parted as the hull flexed or broke beneath them.|$|E
