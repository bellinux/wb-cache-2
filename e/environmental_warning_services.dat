40|$|Linking {{tropical}} cyclone activity with {{anthropogenic climate change}} is subject to on-going debate. However, modelling studies consistently have projected that climate change {{is likely to increase}} the intensity of cyclones and the related rainfall rates in the future. A precautionary approach to this possibility is to adapt to the adverse effects of the changing climate by improving early <b>warning</b> <b>services</b> for cyclones as a ‘no or low-regrets’ option. Given limited funding resources, assessments of economic efficiency will be necessary, and values for benefits are an essential input. This paper aims to estimate the benefits to households of an improved cyclone <b>warning</b> <b>service</b> in Vietnam. Choice experiment surveys with 1014 respondents were designed and conducted to inform this paper. The benefit estimates of the maximal improvements in a number of attributes of cyclone <b>warning</b> <b>services</b> (i. e. forecasting accuracy, frequency of update, and mobile phone based warnings) are approximately USD 7. 1 – 8. 1 per household, which would be an upper bound estimate. Results from the marginal willingness to pay for the attributes suggest that investments should be dedicated to improvements in the accuracy of warning information and a <b>warning</b> <b>service</b> based on mobile phone short message...|$|R

40|$|Pressure on {{government}} budgets {{has made it}} more important to quantify the value of public goods, e. g. tropical cyclone <b>warning</b> <b>services,</b> to society as a whole. Based on a stated preference survey, in which respondents could indicate the amount of their willingness to pay (WTP), this study elicited values for an improved cyclone <b>warning</b> <b>service</b> in Vietnam. To examine motives or reasons behind respondents 2 ̆ 7 WTP, respondents were requested to allocate 10 points among different types of values, including self-interest motivated value (termed use value), and values {{with respect to the}} interests of others (altruistic value) and future generations (bequest value). The more influential the value, the higher the point is scored. Use value, which was scored the highest mean point of 4. 1 out of 10, is the most important motive for valuing improvements in cyclone <b>warning</b> <b>services.</b> Altruistic and bequest values were given similar points, approximately 2. 9 and 3. 0, respectively. This study empirically demonstrates that respondents hold not only self-interest motivated value, but also altruistic and bequest values. Given the importance of non-use values, i. e. altruistic and bequest values, economic assessments focusing on only use value would underestimate the benefits of an improved cyclone <b>warning</b> <b>service</b> to society...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{technical}} options for warning of surface water flooding in England andWales and {{presents the results}} of an Environment Agency funded project. Following the extensive surface water flooding experienced in summer 2007 a rainfall threshold-based Extreme Rainfall Alert (ERA) was piloted by the Met Office and Environment Agency providing initial steps towards the establishment of a warning for some types of surface water flooding. The findings of this paper are based primarily on feedback on technical options from a range of professionals involved in flood forecasting and warning and flood risk management, about the current alerts and about the potential options for developing a more targeted surface water flood <b>warning</b> <b>service.</b> Providing surface water flooding warnings presents a set of technical, forecasting and warning challenges related to the rapid onset of flooding, the localised nature of the flooding, and the linking of rainfall and flood forecasts to flood likelihood and impact on the ground. Some examples of rainfall alerting and surface water flood <b>warning</b> <b>services</b> from other countries are evaluated, as well as a small number of recently implemented local services in England and Wales. Various potential options for implementation of a service are then explored and assessed. The paper concludes that development of a surface water flood <b>warning</b> <b>service</b> for England and Wales is feasible and is likely to be useful to emergency responders and operational agencies, although developing such a service for the pluvial components of this type of flooding is likely to be feasible sooner than for other components of surface water flooding such as that caused by sewers. A targeted surface water flood <b>warning</b> <b>service</b> could be developed for professional emergency responders in the first instance rather than for the public for whom such a service without further operational testing and piloting would be premature...|$|R

500|$|A {{storm in}} 1859 {{that caused the}} loss of the Royal Charter {{inspired}} FitzRoy to develop charts to allow predictions to be made, which he called [...] "forecasting the weather", thus coining the term [...] "weather forecast".
