40|$|AbstractMisfolded tau {{proteins}} {{are characteristic}} of tauopathies, but the isoform composition of tau inclusions varies by tauopathy. Using aggregates of the longest tau isoform (containing 4 microtubule-binding repeats and 4 -repeat tau), we recently described a direct mechanism of toxicity that involves exposure of the N-terminal phosphatase-activating domain (PAD) in tau, which triggers a signaling pathway that disrupts axonal transport. However, the impact of aggregation on <b>PAD</b> <b>exposure</b> for other tau isoforms was unexplored. Here, results from immunochemical assays indicate that aggregation-induced increases in <b>PAD</b> <b>exposure</b> and oligomerization are common features among all tau isoforms. The extent of <b>PAD</b> <b>exposure</b> and oligomerization was larger for tau aggregates composed of 4 -repeat isoforms compared with those made of 3 -repeat isoforms. Most important, aggregates of all isoforms exhibited enough <b>PAD</b> <b>exposure</b> to significantly impair axonal transport in the squid axoplasm. We also show that <b>PAD</b> <b>exposure</b> and oligomerization represent common pathological characteristics in multiple tauopathies. Collectively, these results suggest a mechanism of toxicity common to each tau isoform that likely contributes to degeneration in different tauopathies...|$|R

40|$|Aggregated {{filamentous}} {{forms of}} hyperphosphorylated tau (a microtubule-associated protein) represent pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease (AD) and other tauopathies. While axonal transport dysfunction {{is thought to}} represent a primary pathogenic factor in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases, the direct molecular link between pathogenic forms of tau and deficits in axonal transport remain unclear. Recently, we demonstrated that filamentous, but not soluble, forms of wild-type tau inhibit anterograde, kinesin-based fast axonal transport (FAT) by activating axonal protein phosphatase 1 (PP 1) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK 3), independent of microtubule binding. Here, we demonstrate that amino acids 2 - 18 of tau, comprising a phosphatase-activating domain (PAD), are necessary and sufficient for activation of this pathway in axoplasms isolated from squid giant axons. Various pathogenic forms of tau displaying increased <b>exposure</b> of <b>PAD</b> inhibited anterograde FAT in squid axoplasm. Importantly, immunohistochemical studies using a novel PAD-specific monoclonal antibody in human postmortem tissue indicated that increased <b>PAD</b> <b>exposure</b> represents an early pathogenic event in AD that closely associates in time with AT 8 immunoreactivity, an early marker of pathological tau. We propose a model of pathogenesis in which disease-associated changes in tau conformation lead to increased <b>exposure</b> of <b>PAD,</b> activation of PP 1 -GSK 3, and inhibition of FAT. Results from these studies reveal a novel role for tau in modulating axonal phosphotransferases and provide a molecular basis for a toxic gain-of-function associated with pathogenic forms of tau...|$|R

40|$|Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease (AD) {{and other}} tauopathies are {{characterized}} by fibrillar inclusions composed of the microtubule-associated protein, tau. Recently, we demonstrated that the N-terminus of tau (amino acids [aa] 2 - 18) in filamentous aggregates or N-terminal tau isoforms activate a signaling cascade involving protein phosphatase 1 and glycogen synthase kinase 3 that results in inhibition of anterograde fast axonal transport (FAT). We have termed the functional motif comprised of aa 2 - 18 in tau the phosphatase-activating domain (PAD). Here, we show that phosphorylation of tau at tyrosine 18, which is a fyn phosphorylation site within PAD, prevents inhibition of anterograde FAT induced by both filamentous tau and 6 D tau. Moreover, Fyn-mediated phosphorylation of tyrosine 18 is reduced in disease-associated forms of tau (e. g., tau filaments). A novel PAD-specific monoclonal antibody revealed that <b>exposure</b> of <b>PAD</b> in tau occurs before and more frequently than tyrosine 18 phosphorylation {{in the evolution of}} tangle formation in AD. These results indicate that N-terminal phosphorylation may constitute a regulatory mechanism that controls tau-mediated inhibition of anterograde FAT in AD...|$|R
40|$|AbstractConformational changes {{involving}} the amino terminus of the tau protein {{are among the}} earliest alterations associated with tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies. This region of tau contains a phosphatase-activating domain (PAD) that is aberrantly exposed in pathological forms of the protein, an event {{that is associated with}} disruptions in anterograde fast axonal transport. We utilized four antibodies that recognize the amino terminus of tau, TNT 1, TNT 2 (a novel antibody), Tau 12, and Tau 13, to further study this important region. Using scanning alanine mutations in recombinant tau proteins, we refined the epitopes of each antibody. We examined the antibodies' relative abilities to specifically label pathological tau in non-denaturing and denaturing assays to gain insight into some of the mechanistic details of <b>PAD</b> <b>exposure.</b> We then determined the pattern of tau pathology labeled by each antibody in human hippocampal sections at various disease stages in order to characterize <b>PAD</b> <b>exposure</b> in the context of disease progression. The characteristics of reactivity for the antibodies fell into two groups. TNT 1 and TNT 2 recognized epitopes within amino acids 7 – 12 and specifically identified recombinant tau aggregates and pathological tau from Alzheimer's disease brains in a conformation-dependent manner. These antibodies labeled early pre-tangle pathology from neurons in early Braak stages and colocalized with thiazine red, a marker of fibrillar pathology, in classic neurofibrillary tangles. However, late tangles were negative for TNT 1 and TNT 2 indicating a loss of the epitope in later stages of tangle evolution. In contrast, Tau 12 and Tau 13 both identified discontinuous epitopes in the amino terminus and were unable to differentiate between normal and pathological tau in biochemical and tissue immunohistological assays. Despite the close proximity of these epitopes, the antibodies demonstrated remarkably different abilities to identify pathological changes in tau indicating that detection of conformational alterations involving <b>PAD</b> <b>exposure</b> is not achieved by all N-terminal tau antibodies and that a relatively discrete region of the N-terminus (i. e., amino acids 7 – 12, the TNT 1 and TNT 2 epitope) is central to the differences between normal and pathological tau. The appearance of PAD in early tau pathology and its disappearance in late-stage tangles suggest that toxic forms of tau are associated with the earliest forms of tau deposits. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that the TNT antibodies are useful markers for early conformational display of PAD and provide information regarding conformational changes that have potential implications in the toxic mechanisms of tau pathology...|$|R
40|$|Twelve {{workers from}} a coke plant in The Netherlands {{participated in an}} {{intensive}} skin monitoring programme combined with personal air sampling and biological monitoring during five consecutive eight hour workshifts. The {{purpose of the study}} was to make a quantitative assessment of both the dermal and respiratory intake of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Pyrene was used as a marker compound for both dermal and respiratory exposure to PAHs. The biological measure for the internal exposure to PAHs was urinary 1 -OH-pyrene concentration. Measurements on <b>exposure</b> <b>pads</b> at six skin sites showed that mean total skin contamination of the 12 workers ranged between 21 and 166 micrograms pyrene a day. The dermal uptake of pyrene ranged between 4 and 34 micrograms/day, which was about 20 % of the pyrene contamination on skin. The mean concentration of total pyrene in the breathing zone air of the 12 coke oven workers ranged from 0. 1 to 5. 4 micrograms/m 3. The mean respiratory uptake of pyrene varied between 0. 5 and 32. 2 micrograms/day. Based on the estimates of the dermal and respiratory pyrene uptake it is concluded that an average 75 % (range 28 %- 95 %, n = 12) of the total absorbed amount of pyrene enters the body through the skin. Because of the difference in the pyrene:benzo(a) pyrene ratio between the air samples and the skin contamination samples, the dermal uptake of benzo(a) pyrene was also estimated. This was about 51 % of the total absorbed amount (range 8 %- 92 %, n = 12). The total excreted amount of urinary 1 -OH-pyrene as a result of exposure to PAHs during the five consecutive workshifts varied between 36 and 239 nmol. A multiple regression model of the mass balance between pyrene dose (both dermal and respiratory) and 1 -OH-pyrene excretion confirmed the relevance of the dermal exposure route. The variation in urinary 1 -OH-pyrene excretion was determined more by the dermal pyrene dose than by the respiratory dose. The model showed an estimate of the percentage of the absorbed amount of pyrene that is metabolised and excreted as 1 -OH-pyrene in urine. For the 12 workers this percentage varied between 13 % and 49 % depending on smoking habits and consumption of alcohol. The results of this study indicate that among coke oven workers, the skin is the main route of uptake of PAHs. Preventive measures to reduce exposure to PAHs should be focused more on the reduction of dermal contamination by PAHs than on the reduction of inhaled dose...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn Alzheimer's disease (AD), tau {{undergoes}} numerous modifications, including increased phosphorylation at serine- 422 (pS 422). In {{the human}} brain, pS 422 tau protein {{is found in}} prodromal AD, correlates well with cognitive decline and neuropil thread pathology, and appears associated with increased oligomer formation and exposure of the N-terminal phosphatase-activating domain (PAD). However, whether S 422 phosphorylation contributes to toxic mechanisms associated with disease-related forms of tau remains unknown. Here, we report that S 422 -pseudophosphorylated tau (S 422 E) lengthens the nucleation phase of aggregation without altering the extent of aggregation or the types of aggregates formed. When compared to unmodified tau aggregates, the S 422 E modification significantly increased the amount of SDS-stable tau dimers, despite similar levels of immunoreactivity with an oligomer-selective antibody (TOC 1) and another antibody that reports <b>PAD</b> <b>exposure</b> (TNT 1). Vesicle motility assays in isolated squid axoplasm further revealed that S 422 E tau monomers inhibited anterograde, kinesin- 1 dependent fast axonal transport (FAT). Unexpectedly, and unlike unmodified tau aggregates, which selectively inhibit anterograde FAT, aggregates composed of S 422 E tau were found to inhibit both anterograde and retrograde FAT. Highlighting the relevance of these findings to human disease, pS 422 tau was found to colocalize with tau oligomers and with a fraction of tau showing increased <b>PAD</b> <b>exposure</b> in the human AD brain. This study identifies novel effects of pS 422 on tau biochemical properties, including prolonged nucleation and enhanced dimer formation, which correlate with a distinct inhibitory effect on FAT. Taken together, these findings identify a novel mechanistic basis by which pS 422 confers upon tau a toxic effect that may directly contribute to axonal dysfunction in AD and other tauopathies...|$|R
40|$|Five commercially {{available}} insect sprays were applied {{in a model}} room. Spraying was performed {{in accordance with the}} manufacturers' instructions and in an overdosed manner in order to simulate worst-case conditions or an unforeseeable Misuse. In addition, we examined electro-vaporizers. The Respicon (TM) aerosol monitoring system was applied to determine inhalation exposure. During normal spraying (10 seconds) and during the following 2 - 3 minutes, exposure concentrations ranged from 70 to 590 mu g/m(3) for the pyrethroids tetramethrin, d-phenothrin, cyfluthrin, bloallethrin, and the pyrethrins. Calculated inhalable doses were 2 - 16 mu g. A concentration of approximately 850 mu g chlorpyrifos/m(3) (inhalable dose: approximately 20 mu g) was determined when the "Contra insect fly spray" was applied. Highest exposure concentrations (1100 - 2100 mu g/m(3)) were measured for piperonyl butoxide (PBO), corresponding to an inhalation intake of 30 - 60 mu g. When simulating worst-case conditions, exposure concentrations of 200 - 3400 mu g/m(3) and inhalable doses of 10 - 210 mu g were determined for the various active substances. Highest concentrations (4800 - 8000 mu g/m(3)) were measured for PBO (inhalable: 290 - 480 mu g). By applying the electro-vaporizer "Nexa Lotte" plug-in mosquito killer concentrations for d-allethrin were in the range of 5 - 12 mu g/m(3) and 0. 5 - 2 mu g/m(3) for PBO while with the "Paral" plug-in mosquito killer concentrations of 0. 4 - 5 mu g/m(3) for pyrethrins and 1 - 7 mu g/m(3) for PBO were measured. Potential dermal exposures were determined using <b>exposure</b> <b>pads.</b> Between 80 and 1000 mu g active substance (tetramethrin, phenothrin, cyfluthrin, bioallethrin, pyrethrins, chlorpyrifos) were deposited on the clothing of the total body surface area of the spray user. Highest levels (up to 3000 mu g) were determined for PBO. Worst-case uses of the sprays led to 5 - 9 times higher concentrations. Also a 2 -hour stay nearby an operating electro-vaporizer led to a contamination of the clothing (total amounts on the whole body were 450 mu g d-allethrin and 50 mu g PBO for "Nexa Lotte" plug-in mosquito killer and 80 mu g pyrethrins and 190 mu g PBO for "Paral" plug-in mosquito killer). Human blomonitoring data revealed urine concentrations of the metabolite (E) -trans-chrysanthemum dicarboxylic acid ((E) -trans-CDCA) between 1. 7 mu g/l and 7. 1 mu g/l after 5 minutes of exposure to the different sprays. Also the use of electro-vaporizers led to (E) -trans-CDCA concentrations in the urine in the range of 1. 0 mu g/l to 6. 2 mu g/l (1 - 3 hours exposure period). The exposure data presented can be used for performing human risk assessment when these biocidal products were applied indoors.

40|$|The conjugative {{transfer}} of the Streptococcus faecalis plasmid pAD 1 {{is characterized by a}} 10, 000 -fold increase in frequency following sex pheromone (cAD 1) induction. Before the increase in plasmid transfer, donor cells synthesize a proteinaceous adhesin that facilitates the formation of mating aggregates. Four novel surface proteins appearing after <b>exposure</b> of <b>pAD</b> 1 -containing cells to sex pheromone have been identified. Thirty minutes after induction, a 130 -kilodalton (kDa) protein was detectable by Western blotting. A 74 -kDa protein, the major species present, and a pair of bands at 153 and 157 kDa were evident 45 min after induction. Induced cells containing another conjugative S. faecalis plasmid, pPD 1, gave rise to three high-molecular-weight proteins of the same size (130, 153, and 157 kDa) as those synthesized by pAD 1 -containing cells. These proteins cross-reacted with antisera raised against induced cells containing pAD 1.

ResultsOf 350 students, 244 students agreed that they had some knowledge about PAD. More students in their clinical years (3 – 5) had heard about PAD compared to students in their basic science years (1 – 2; 76. 5 % versus 65. 4 %, respectively); however, the overall scores were low for both groups for recognition of PAD symptoms (mean scores, 2. 83 out of 7 for students in years 3 – 5 versus 1. 81 for students in years 1 – 2; p <  0. 001). The scores of the knowledge of risk factors were 4. 86 and 2. 77 out of 7 for students in years 3 – 5 and 1 – 2, respectively (p <  0. 001); the scores of preventive measures were 4. 28 and 3. 13 out of 6 for students in years 3 – 5 and 1 – 2 years, respectively (p <  0. 001); and the scores of treatments and complications were 4. 41 and 3. 57 out of 6 for students in years 3 – 5 and 1 – 2 years, respectively (p <  0. 001).

40|$|Objective: Defibrillation pads {{are used}} {{routinely}} at both cardiac arrests and cardioversion procedures. There are currently no evidence-based guidelines on how often pads should be replaced, {{although it has}} been suggested that they should be changed as often as every three shocks to maintain optimal performance. Previously, we have shown that on <b>exposure</b> to air, <b>pad</b> mass diminishes over time due to evaporation—an effect likely to lead to poorer conduction between skin and paddle. This prospective study was designed to determine if evaporation is accelerated by the passage of a defibrillation current and to formulate evidence-based guidelines for defibrillation pad replacement. Materials and methods: 3 M defibrillation pads (2346 N) were collected from acute wards and emergency departments in two hospitals in the UK over a 2 month period. The duration of exposure to air, number and energy of shocks, and type of procedure were recorded. When no longer required, pad masses were determined and the loss of pad mass due to evaporation calculated. Results: 26 pairs of pads were collected from 14 cardiac arrests and 12 cardioversions. The total defibrillation energy used ranged from 150 to 5080 J and evaporative drying time from 4 to 38 min. The rate of evaporation from these pads (86. 1 mg min? 1) was not significantly different from pads previously studied on volunteers in the absence of a defibrillation current (99. 4 mg min? 1). Of the defibrillation pads exposed to air for less than 30 min, in only one of 49 pads was the loss of mass due to evaporation consistent with a significant increase in transthoracic impedance (TTI). Correspondingly, of two pads used for more than 30 min, both attained a mass consistent with a significant increase in TTI. Conclusions: Defibrillation pads can be used for up to 30 min without evaporation causing a clinically significant increase in TTI. The passage of a defibrillation current across pads does not further accelerate water loss...|$|R

A number of interventions to reduce low back pain in commercial motor vehicle operators have focused on reducing exposures to wholebody vibration (WBV). Objective. An intervention to be evaluated for the trucking industry is an air-filled ballistic seat pad designed to reduce exposure to WBV. The effectiveness of the seat pad in semi-trucks {{has not yet been}} established. Results from a previous pilot study involving 12 -ton and 16 -ton vibratory rollers used by Seattle Public Utility drivers suggest that the seat pad is not effective at very low speeds (1 - 3 mph). Methods. The current study measures, characterizes and compares WBV exposures in nine truck drivers who operated their trucks over the same roads. WBV exposures were compared between their existing air-suspension seat and the air-filled ballistic seat pad which sat on top of their existing seat. This study uses a Wilcoxon signed rank test to compare the seat pad’s effectiveness in reducing WBV exposures relative to their existing air-suspension seat. Results. Overall, the truck drivers' vibration exposures were above daily vibration action values set by the International Standards Organization (ISO) and the air-filled ballistic seat pad did not significantly reduce WBV exposures relative to the WBV exposures experienced with their existing air-suspension seat. Conclusions. In the semi-trucks evaluated in this study, the air-filled ballistic seat pad was not effective in reducing WBV <b>exposures.</b> The seat <b>pad</b> {{has been shown to be}} effective in reducing WBV exposures in public transportation buses and cars. The answer for why the air-filled seat pads were not effective in semi-trucks may lie in a future analysis of the power spectral densities, which shows the vibration exposures as a function of frequency. Buses and cars produce more high frequency vibration energy, and the air-filled seat pad has been shown to be effective in these vehicles when travelling at moderate to high speeds. Trucks may produce less high frequency vibration energy, and this may have diminished the air-filled seat pad’s effectiveness in the semi-truck evaluated in this study...|$|R
