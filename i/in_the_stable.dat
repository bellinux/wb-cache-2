5|$|In October 1887, Bury {{arrived in}} Bow, London, and found work selling sawdust for James Martin, {{who appears to}} have run a brothel at 80 Quickett Street, Bow. Initially, Bury lived <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stable,</b> but later moved into the house. There, he met Ellen Elliot, who was {{employed}} by Martin as a servant and probably a prostitute.|$|E
5|$|Mike Rotunda, who portrayed Schyster, and Ted DiBiase {{continue}} to be close friends in real life, and they have reunited on several occasions following the disbanding of Money Inc. In 1994, DiBiase formed the Million Dollar Corporation, a stable of heel wrestlers. Schyster {{was one of the}} first wrestlers to join the group and remained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stable</b> until leaving the WWF in 1995. In 1996, DiBiase and Rotunda (the latter as V.K. Wallstreet) were briefly together again in World Championship Wrestling as members of the New World Order.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the areas}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stable</b> court are {{available}} for hire for charitable fund raising. The Long Room, which was refurbished in 1992 and now has {{the character of a}} large country house drawing room, can hold 150people. The former saddle room is now a dining room. The carriage room and adjoining buildings have been converted into the Wolf Room, which has a movable stage and audio-visual facilities. It can seat 200people and contains eight black-chalk pictures of birds by Joseph Wolf. The chapel is usually reserved for the family but in December each year it is used for carol concerts to raise money for charity.|$|E

5|$|The Debian project handles {{security}} {{through public}} disclosure {{rather than through}} obscurity. Debian security advisories are compatible with the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures dictionary, are usually coordinated with other free software vendors and are published the same day a vulnerability is made public.

5|$|The Shortest Way {{with the}} Dissenters; or, Proposals for the Establishment of the Church is a {{pamphlet}} consisting of twenty-nine pages. It opens with the fable of the Cock and the Horses. The Cock, lacking any perch <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stable,</b> {{is forced to}} rest on the ground and in fear of the Horses moving around and stepping on him, advises: “Pray, Gentlefolks! let us stand still! for fear we should tread upon one another!” The speaker then applies this to the contemporary situation, with the Cock representing the Dissenters.|$|E
5|$|The {{family and}} {{household}} slaves resided {{on the second}} floor of the mansion, while others lived <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stable.</b> As with everywhere else had they lived, she cared nothing about public life, and instead worked with Eliza and the other servants to create a home that welcomed extended family members and personal friends of the Houstons. Houston would occasionally hire out some of his labor force. The first child born in the Texas governor's mansion was also the last of the Houston children; Temple Lea Houston was delivered on August 12, 1860. This last birth left the 41-year-old Margaret debilitated for almost two weeks, with a watchful Houston constantly by her side.|$|E

5|$|The {{early part}} of the story {{provides}} an anthropological view of the culture of the Tombs, and through them, of the Kargish lands as a whole. The reader is shown that the true names of people have no particular significance in the Kargish lands, whereas in the Archipelago they grant power over the thing being named; nonetheless, the critical moment in which Tenar recalls her true name has been described as influencing other works such as Hayao Miyazaki's 2001 film Spirited Away. Scholars have described Le Guin's depiction of Kargish culture as a subtle critique, particularly of the powers of the Tombs, which give nothing in return for their worship. Much of the {{early part of}} the novel describes the life that Tenar leads <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stable</b> world of the Tombs. Ged's arrival acts as a turning point, and the rest of the book explores the possibility of change, and introduces different perspectives on the internal world of the novel.|$|E
25|$|As RAO is {{primarily}} a management condition, primary treatment is managemental. Where possible, the horse should be turned out to pasture.

25|$|If {{this is not}} practical, certain {{alterations}} to stable routine may be effective. The aim is to minimise {{dust and}} maximise air quality <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stable.</b> This may be achieved by soaking hay or feeding a dust-free alternative (such as haylage). The length of time to soak hay for the maximum benefit is debated; however, approximately 30 minutes {{appears to be the}} current consensus.|$|E
25|$|The focus {{therefore}} {{shifted to}} a separate individual born at the same time, in a neighbouring stable. When Jesus appears in the film (first, as a baby <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stable,</b> {{and then later on}} the Mount, speaking the Beatitudes), he is played straight (by actor Kenneth Colley) and portrayed with respect. The comedy begins when members of the crowd mishear his statements of peace, love, and tolerance ("I think he said, 'Blessed are the cheesemakers'").|$|E

25|$|Kappa {{are also}} said to victimize animals, {{especially}} horses and cows. The motif of the kappa trying to drown a horse is found all over Japan.

This usually takes place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stable</b> where the kappa attempted to attack the horse, which is considered the place where the kappa is most vulnerable.|$|E
25|$|On 30 August, a {{thoroughbred}} racehorse at Randwick Racecourse {{returned a}} preliminary positive test for EI, although {{did not have}} any symptoms of infection. Track work was cancelled and the stables were locked down. Tests confirmed that eight race horses <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stable</b> had EI and the racecourse was quarantined for two months. This brought the number of confirmed infections to 488 on 41 properties, plus another 1,646 suspected infections on 100 properties. The first infection in Brisbane was confirmed, increasing the number of quarantine zones in Queensland to five.|$|E

Initially wrestling under the sumo name of Umenotani Otomatsu, he officially took on the Umegatani Tōtarō name before his fourth basho as an ōzeki in January 1902. He met Hitachiyama in May 1903 when both ōzeki were undefeated. The clash caused great excitement throughout Japan. Although Umegatani lost the match, after the tournament both he and Hitachiyama were promoted to yokozuna, Umegatani's promotion being awarded at Hitachiyama's insistence.|$|E

25|$|Masatomi Ikeda {{was born}} in Tokyo, Japan. He was already {{interested}} in budō and sports in general {{when he was young}} which resulted in achieving a 5th dan in sumo and 4th dan in judo. Until he started with Aikido in 1958, judo played an essential role in his life. In 1960 he enlisted into the dojo of Hiroshi Tada (9th dan Aikikai). He started intensively practising budō, and especially aikido. He trained himself in judo in the Kodokan Institute and at the dojo of Dokkyo High School.

25|$|To reduce {{errors in}} sensing {{attitude}} and velocity, designers cut friction {{to a minimum}} in the platform gyros and accelerometers by floating the bearings on a thin film of dry nitrogen. The nitrogen was supplied from a sphere holding 2 cu ft (56.6 l) of gas at 3,000 psig (pounds per square inch gauge, i.e. psi above one atmosphere) (20,7 MPa). This sphere is 21inches (0,53 m) in diameter and is mounted at location 22, {{to the left of}} the ST-124-M3. Gas from the supply sphere passes through a filter, a pressure regulator, and a heat exchanger before flowing through the bearings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stable</b> platform.|$|E

Inspecting the presents left by the three wise men for something to eat, the baby Jesus touches the donkey's ear and its character is transformed.
