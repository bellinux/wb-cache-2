25|$|Air-cured {{tobacco is}} hung in well-ventilated barns and allowed to <b>dry</b> <b>over</b> a period of four to eight weeks. Air-cured tobacco is low in sugar, which gives the tobacco smoke a light, mild flavor, and high in nicotine. Cigar and burley tobaccos are 'dark' air-cured.|$|E
25|$|Snails usually prefer juicy {{leaves and}} {{vegetables}} over dry ones. If snails are fed vegetable trimmings, damaged fruit, and cooked potatoes, uneaten food must be promptly removed {{as it will}} quickly spoil. Bran may be supplied that is wet or sprinkled <b>dry</b> <b>over</b> leafy vegetables. The diet may consist of 20% wheat bran while 80% is fruit and vegetable material. Some growers use oats, corn meal, soybean meal, or chicken mash. Laying mash provides calcium, as does crushed oyster shells. Snails also may eat materials such as cardboard (but do not purposely feed it to them); they can eat through shipping cartons and escape. Snails may sometimes eat, within a 24-hour period, food equal to 10%, and occasionally as much as 20%, of their body weight. Active snails deprived of food will lose {{more than one-third of}} their weight before they starve to death—a process that takes 8 to 12 weeks. Estivating snails can survive much longer.|$|E
500|$|The {{technique}} for producing black tea was first {{developed during the}} late Ming Dynasty Wuyishan, Fujian either resulting from the over-oxidation of tea-leaves during the manufacture of oolong tea [...] or indirectly from the methods of manufacturing green and white teas. In the early 1600s, tea producers in the Wuyi Mountains began kneading the sun-withered tea leaves to macerate them, then allowed them to dry under the sun, thus reaching full oxidation and producing [...] "Gongfu" [...] black tea (工夫紅茶). When there was insufficient sun and temperatures were low, the withered leaves would be processed indoors in warmed rooms and allowed to fully oxidize, then smoked <b>dry</b> <b>over</b> pine fires thus producing lapsang souchong. According to oral traditions of the region, the discovery of lapsang souchong processing was due to military troops passing through a Wuyi's tea factory during {{the last years of}} the Ming Dynasty, causing delays to tea leaf processing thus resulting in a completely oxidized leaf that the producer salvaged by drying over a fire built from pine branches. By the Qing Dynasty, both lapsang souchong and gongfu black tea were well recognized in China and noted in [...] "Records on Yiwu mountain" [...] (武夷山志) by the scholar Dong Tiangong (董天工).|$|E

2500|$|From 1965–68, eastern Australia {{was again}} greatly {{affected}} by drought. Conditions had been <b>dry</b> <b>over</b> {{the centre of}} the continent since 1957 but spread elsewhere during the summer of 1964/1965. This drought contributed to the 1967 Tasmanian fires in which 62people died in one day and 1,400 homes were lost.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do, my boy? That's soon said. I'll {{make things}} square and {{straight}} at Stoney Creek. I'll send for Hamilton, {{and make him}} interim commander-in-chief. I'll write two letters--one to the gentleman {{in charge of the}} district, telling him of my movements; the other (containing a screed of formal instructions) to the miserable mortal who shall succeed me here. I'll take the best canoe in our store, load it with provisions, put you carefully in the middle of it, stick Jacques in the bow and myself in the stern, and start, two weeks hence, neck and crop, head over heels, through thick and thin, wet and <b>dry,</b> <b>over</b> portage, river, fall, and lake, for Red River settlement!" ...|$|E
60|$|You know I {{have told}} you, again and again, that {{the soul of}} Greece is her veracity; that what to other nations were fables and symbolisms, to her became living facts--living gods. The fall of Greece was instant when her gods again became fables. The Apollo Belvedere {{is the work of}} a {{sculptor}} to whom Apollonism is merely an elegant idea on which to exhibit his own skill. He does not himself feel for an instant that the handsome man in the unintelligible attitude,[AM] with drapery hung over his left arm, as it would be hung to <b>dry</b> <b>over</b> a clothes-line, is the Power of the Sun. But the Florentine believes in Apollo with his whole mind, and is trying to explain his strength in every touch.|$|E

60|$|But, as {{if there}} were a curse upon him that he should never rest again, his drowsy senses would not lose their consciousness. He had no more {{influence}} with them, in this regard, than if they had been another man's. It was not that they forced him to take note of present sounds and objects, but {{that they would not be}} diverted from the whole hurried vision of his journey. It was constantly before him all at once. She stood there, with her dark disdainful eyes again upon him; and he was riding on nevertheless, through town and country, light and darkness, wet weather and <b>dry,</b> <b>over</b> road and pavement, hill and valley, height and hollow, jaded and scared by the monotony of bells and wheels, and horses' feet, and no rest.|$|E
60|$|The {{gardens of}} Clavering Park were removed some three {{hundred yards from}} the large, square, sombre-looking stone mansion which was the country-house of Sir Hugh Clavering, the {{eleventh}} baronet of that name; and in these gardens, which had but little of beauty to recommend them, I will introduce my readers to two of the personages with whom I wish to make them acquainted in the following story. It was now the end of August, and the parterres, beds, and bits of lawn were dry, disfigured, and almost ugly, from the effects of a long drought. In gardens to which care and labor are given abundantly, flower-beds will be pretty, and grass will be green, let the weather be what it may; but care and labor were but scantily bestowed on the Clavering Gardens, and everything was yellow, adust, harsh, and <b>dry.</b> <b>Over</b> the burnt turf toward a gate that led to the house, a lady was walking, and by her side there walked a gentleman.|$|E
6000|$|During {{three days}} of the stormiest weather, we were given the {{privilege}} of the berth-deck (at other times strictly interdicted), where we were permitted to spread our jackets, and take a nap in {{the morning after the}} eight hours' night exposure. But this privilege was but a beggarly one, indeed. Not to speak of our jackets--used for blankets--being soaking wet, the spray, coming down the hatchways, kept the planks of the berth-deck itself constantly wet; whereas, had we been permitted our hammocks, we might have swung <b>dry</b> <b>over</b> all this deluge. But we endeavoured to make ourselves as warm and comfortable as possible, chiefly by close stowing, so as to generate a little steam, {{in the absence of any}} fire-side warmth. You have seen, perhaps, the way in which they box up subjects intended to illustrate the winter lectures of a professor of surgery. Just so we laid; heel and point, face to back, dove-tailed into each other at every ham and knee. The wet of our jackets, thus densely packed, would soon begin to distill. But it was like pouring hot water on you to keep you from freezing. It was like being [...] "packed" [...] between the soaked sheets in a Water-cure Establishment.|$|E

6000|$|So poor anglers are in sore straits. Unless a man be {{rich and}} can pay great rents, {{he may not}} fish, in England, and hence spring the discontents of the times, for the angler is full of content, if he do but take trout, but if he be driven from the waterside, he falls, perchance, into evil company, and cries out to divide the {{property}} of the gentle folk. As many now do, even among Parliament, men, whom you loved not, Father Isaak, neither do I love them more than Reason and Scripture bid each of us be kindly to his neighbour. But, behold, the causes of the ill content are not yet all expressed, for even where a man hath licence to fish, he will hardly take trout in our age, unless he be all the more cunning. For the fish, harried this way and that by so many of your disciples, is exceeding shy and artful, nor will he bite at a fly unless it falleth lightly, just above his mouth, and floateth <b>dry</b> <b>over</b> him, {{for all the world like}} the natural ephemeris. And we may no longer angle with worm for him, nor with penk or minnow, nor with the natural fly, as was your manner, but only with the artificial, for the more difficulty the more diversion. For my part I may cry, like Viator in your book, 'Master, I can neither catch with the first nor second Angle: I have no fortune.' ...|$|E

5000|$|Certain breweries, however, {{maintained}} the smoked beer tradition {{by continuing to}} use malt which had been <b>dried</b> <b>over</b> open flames. Two brewpubs in Bamberg, Germany - Schlenkerla and Spezial - have continued smoked beer production for nearly two centuries. Both are still in operation today, alongside seven other breweries in the same town. Both <b>dry</b> their malt <b>over</b> fires made from beechwood logs, and produce several varieties of Rauchbier ("smoke beer" [...] in German).|$|R
