One of the telltale characteristics of a Verneuil crystal is curved growth lines (curved striae) formed as the cylindrical boule grows upwards in an environment with a high thermal gradient; the <b>equivalent</b> <b>lines</b> in natural crystals are parallel.

So early as 1904 KOrber had declared a complete change in the principles of administration to be essential if the machinery of State were to continue working. After seven years of inaction, however, this imperial rescript was pitched in a far lower key. The continuous progress of society, it said, had made increased demands on the administration, that is to say, it was assumed that reform was not demanded so much by the defects of the administration but by the progress of the times, not because the administration was bad, but because life was better. It was an attempt to reform the administration without first reforming the State on <b>equivalent</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|E

40|$|F {{or most of}} its 90 -year existence, the Statistics of Income (SOI) Division of the Internal Revenue Service and its {{predecessor}} organizations have used data provided by taxpayers on Forms 1040 to ful-fill the legal mandate to produce statistics on the opera-tion of the individual income tax system. It was not un-til Tax Year 1989 that SOI started using the Information Returns Master File (IRMF), which contains electronic documents filed by the payers of income to individuals, to add further details to the tax return information. To date, the SOI Bulletin has featured articles on the dis-tribution of salaries and wages from Forms W- 2 [1] and the accumulation of assets in Individual Retirement Ac-counts from Forms 5498 [2], based on this rich source of administrative data. In this paper, the authors make a modest proposal for another set of statistics that could be produced from the IRMF which would shed light {{not only on the}} operation of the individual income tax and the Social Security tax systems, but also on the interac-tion of the two systems. The paper illustrates some of the analysis that could be produced with this file. 	 Components of the Social Security Impact Figure 1 starts from the total income of everybody touched by the Social Security system, either as a payer of Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) or Self-Employment Contributions Act (SECA) taxes, or as a recipient of Social Security benefits. The first line shows total income, which, for filers of tax returns, is the sum of all sources of income as shown on line 22 of Form 1040, or the <b>equivalent</b> <b>lines</b> of Forms 1040 -A and 1040 -EZ. For the purpose of this chart, the taxable portion of Social Security benefits has been excluded. One of the advantages of working with information documents is that they enable SOI to show information on individuals who have not filed (and may never file) income tax returns for a given year. For these indi-viduals, total income can be computed by adding sala-ries and wages from Forms W- 2, gambling winnings from Forms W- 2 G, and nonemployee compensation, unemployment compensation, rents, royalties, inter-est, dividends, and pension distributions from variou...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. We give a {{counterexample}} to a conjecture by Wild about binary matroids. We connect two <b>equivalent</b> <b>lines</b> {{of research}} in matroid theory: a simple type of basis-exchange property and restrictions on the cardinalities of intersections of circuits and cocircuits. Finally, we characterize direct sums of series-parallel networks by a simple basis-exchange property. In [9], Wild proposed a characterization of binary matroids. In order to state his conjecture compactly, we recall his notation. (We also use standard matroid notation and terminology as found, for example, in [6].) For a basis B of a matroid M and an element x in the matroid, R(x → B) denotes the set of all elements y ∈ B so that (B − y) ∪ x is a basis of M. Informally, R(x → B) is the set of elements of B that can be replaced by x. Thus if x is in B, the set R(x → B) is the singleton {x}; if x is not in B, the set R(x → B) consists of all elements in the fundamental circuit, C(x, B), of x with respect to B, except for x itself. Wild observed that every binary matroid M satisfies the following property: For all bases B and elements x, y of M, if R(x → B) = R(y → B), then x and y are either equal or parallel. He conjectured that this property characterizes binary matroids. We present a counterexample. Our counterexample, M, is simpler to describe via its dual M ∗. Let M ∗ be the matroid on {a, a ′, b, b ′, c, c ′, d, d ′} whose underlying simple matroid is the 4 -point line (i. e., U 2, 4) and for which {a, a ′}, {b, b ′}, {c, c ′}, and {d, d ′} are parallel classes. (Thus M is simple and representable over every field other than GF (2).) The automorphism group of M is transitive on the bases, so it suffices to show that for a particular basis B of M and the two elements x, y of M not in B, R(x → B) and R(y → B) are unequal (thus proving the condition above for this non-binary matroid). Let B be the basis {a′, b ′, c, c ′, d, d ′} of M. To find R(a → B), w...|$|E

Galactic Centre (GC) OH/IR stars can be, {{based on}} the {{expansion}} velocities of their circumstellar shells, {{divided into two groups}} which are kinematically different and therefore are believed to have evolved from different stellar populations. Aims. To study the metallicity distribution of the OH/IR stars population in the GC on basis of a theoretical relation between EW(Na), EW(Ca) and EW(CO) and the metallicity. Methods. For 70 OH/IR stars in the GC, we obtained near-IR spectra. The <b>equivalent</b> <b>line</b> widths of Nai, Cai, 12 CO(2, 0) and the curvature of the spectrum around 1. 6 µm due to water absorption are determined. Results. The near-IR spectrum of OH/IR stars is influenced by several physical processes. OH/IR stars are variable stars suffering high mass-loss rates. The dust that is formed around the stars strongly influences the near-IR spectra and reduces the <b>equivalent</b> <b>line</b> widths of Nai, Cai. A similar effect is caused by the water content in the outer atmosphere of the OH/IR star. Because of these effects, it is not possible with our low resolution near-infrared spectroscopy to determine the metallicities of these stars...|$|R

We demonstrate that the structure of FACs formed during the expansion phase and associated with the substorm current wedge is significantly more complex than a simple <b>equivalent</b> <b>line</b> current model comprising a downward FAC {{in the east and}} upward FAC in the west. This two-dimensional view demonstrates that azimuthal bands of upward and downward FACs with periodic structuring in latitude form across midnight and can span up to 8 h of magnetic local time.

In addition, we demonstrate that the upward FAC elements of the structured SCW are spatially very well correlated with discrete aurora during the substorm expansion phase and that discrete changes in the FAC topology are observed in the late growth phase prior to auroral substorm expansion phase onset. These observations have important implications for determining how the magnetosphere and ionosphere couple during the late growth phase and expansion phase, as well as providing important constraints on the magnetospheric generator of the FACs comprising the SCW...|$|R
