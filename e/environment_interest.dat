40|$|Even in {{the face}} of a {{continuously}} changing economic <b>environment,</b> <b>interest</b> rates often remain unadjusted for long periods. When rates are moved, the norm is for a series of small unidirectional discrete basis-point changes. To explain these phenomena we suggest a two-equation system combining a “long-run ” equation explaining a binary decision to change or not change the interest-rate, and a “short-run ” one based on a simple monetary policy rule. We account for unobserved heterogeneity in both equations, applying the model to unique unit-record level data on the voting preferences of Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members.

To this end, we propose a three yield-curve model, one for discounting cash flows, one for calculating LIBOR deposit rates {{and one for}} calculating coupon rates of government bonds. The derivation of the yield curves from observed data is presented, and the option prices on a swap or a government bond are studied. A one-factor quadratic Gaussian model is proposed as a specific model, and is shown to provide a very good fit to the current Japanese low-interest-rate <b>environment.</b> <b>Interest</b> rates, Pricing model, Yield curves,...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In a {{distributed}} virtual <b>environment</b> <b>interest</b> management schemes {{attempt to}} ensure virtual world objects exchange messages {{only if they}} are interacting. This provides an opportunity to allow such systems to scale to support many hundreds, even thousands, of virtual world objects by reducing the need to send and process unnecessary messages. However, arriving at the optimum configuration for the interest management scheme is a challenging and complex problem. The customary approach is to configure parameters in an adhoc manner (supported by experience). However, such an approach is unlikely to yield optimum system performance. Here we propose a means of finding optimal parameter values by way of a simulation tool equipped with evolutionary optimization capabilities. We provide a series of experiments that indicate that our simulator can aid in configuring interest management schemes to gain better system performance. D I...|$|E

40|$|This report {{analyses}} some of {{the reasons}} mentioned in the literature as to why central banks change interest rates at discrete intervals {{in the face of a}} continuously changing <b>environment</b> (<b>interest</b> rate stepping) and why they seem to prefer to implement changes in a series of small steps (interest rate smoothing). Despite the fact that both seem difficult to explain within the certainty equivalent optimal control framework frequently used to study monetary policy, it appears that modifying {{some of the}} assumptions of these models go a long way in explaining these phenomena. In particular, replacing the assumption that all uncertainty takes the form of additive shocks with known probability distributions with perhaps more realistic ways to model uncertainty will often yield stepping and smoothing as features of an optimal interest rate rule.

However, although the interest margin of the local banking sector has been reducing in the past four years, the operating profit has risen since 2002. This paper tries to examine the credit environment of Macao and the ways for the Macao banking sector to weather these influences and sustain its profitability. It is found that banks in Macao, like their counterparts in advanced economies, have diversified into areas of personal finance which are fee- or commission-based, and become relatively less dependent on traditional credit operations...|$|E

A multi-method approach, using both quantitative and qualitative paradigms was used to investigate differences in classroom climate perception by Year 6 primary (10 -year-old) pupils in a stratified sample of schools from State, Church and Independent sectors. Classroom climate was measured along the nine factors of Clarity, Environment, Fairness, Interest, Order, Participation, Safety, Standards and Support. Results showed that, overall and in the State and Church sectors, Maltese pupils had a higher perception of positive classroom climate, most strongly in the dimension of Fairness, Clarity, and Safety dimensions.

Therefore, dispersal of native and invasive horticultural plants can be understood by considering the decisions/choices of consumers who decide which plants to purchase from retailers. In contrast to previous studies on invasive and native plants, this study uses an experimental auction to elicit consumers’ willingness to pay (WTP) for labeled native and invasive attributes. Results from a censored random effect model show that consumers’ WTP for plants decreases when the plants are labeled as invasive and increases when plants are labeled as native. The study finds that consumers discount an invasive attribute more for native than for non-native plants. Consumers’ sociodemographics and attitudes—age, income, gender, concern about <b>environment,</b> <b>interest</b> in plant quality, ease of care and sensitivity to price—significantly alter consumer’s WTP for native and invasive attributes. The implications of this study are notable given the consumers’ increasing concern about the environment and recent debate over sustainable labeling of plants by the horticulture industry. native plants, invasive plants, willingness to pay, labeling, auction, marketing, Consumer/Household Economics, Demand and Price Analysis,...|$|E

Active packaging systems are developed with the goal of extending shelf life for foods and increasing the period of time that the food is high quality. Developments in active packaging have led to advances in many areas, including delayed oxidation and controlled respiration rate, microbial growth, and moisture migration. Active packaging technologies include some physical, chemical, or biological action which changes interactions between a package, product, and/or headspace of the package {{in order to get a}} desired outcome. Active packaging systems discussed include oxygen scavengers, carbon dioxide scavengers and emitters, moisture control agents, flavour/odour absorbers and releasers   and antimicrobial packaging technologies.

Respondents were asked about their perceptions about relative harm of snuff compared to cigarettes, and their interest in switching to snuff if informed it was 99 % less harmful than cigarettes. Results: About 49. 7 % of exclusive cigarette smokers believed that snuff was equally as harmful as cigarettes; 12. 9 % thought snuff was more harmful; 5. 7 % thought snuff was less harmful; while 31. 8 % did not know if there was a difference in harm between snuff and cigarettes.

However, the contamination of groundwater resources by MOs has a limited evidence base compared to other freshwater resources. Of particular concern are newly ‘emerging contaminants’ such as pharmaceuticals and lifestyle compounds, particularly those with potential endocrine disrupting properties. While groundwater often has a high degree of protection from pollution due to physical, chemical and biological attenuation processes in the subsurface compared to surface aquatic environments, trace concentrations of a large range of compounds are still detected in groundwater and in some cases may persist for decades due to the long residence times of groundwater systems. This study provides the first national-scale assessment of micro-organic compounds in groundwater in England and Wales. A large set of monitoring data was analysed to determine the relative occurrence and detected concentrations of different groups of compounds and to determine relationships with land-use, aquifer type and groundwater vulnerability.
