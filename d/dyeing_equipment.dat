50|$|Just before 6:00 PM on June 15, 1911 {{a machine}} {{on the fourth}} floor overheated, {{starting}} a fire. The mill had a modern fire sprinkler system, but the water pumps failed and the entire complex burnt down. Though it was fully insured, Fries decided not to rebuild and instead reinvested in the Mayo Mill, transferring his employees and resources there. All 60 of the company houses were put on logs and rolled by mules and horses to Mayodan. The church was dismantled and its lumber was used for construction in Mayodan. In 1916, Fries briefly returned {{to the site of the}} mill to dismantle the <b>dyeing</b> <b>equipment</b> for use in the Mayo Mill.|$|E

With {{computer control}} system, temperature and pressure was controlled accurately in dyeing process. As key components of the supercritical <b>dyeing</b> <b>equipment,</b> the coloring matter kettle and the segregator had {{a close relationship with}} the dyeing process. The finite element analysis software ANSYS was used to analyze the static stress of supercritical <b>dyeing</b> <b>equipment.</b> The model of the coloring matter kettle and the segregator were established, and the static stress analysis result of the coloring matter kettle and the segregator were obtained. These models not only confirmed the safety of the <b>dyeing</b> <b>equipment,</b> but also offered related parameters and provided the methods for improving the efficiency of <b>dyeing</b> <b>equipment</b> design...|$|E
40|$|A {{common goal}} of all dyers {{is to achieve}} uniform dyeings. Much atten-tion {{therefore}} {{is given to the}} develop-ment of dye formulas that consistently result in uniform distribution of dye in the textile substrate being dyed. But no matter how well a given formula behaves during its development in lab-oratory <b>dyeing</b> <b>equipment,</b> that formula may fail in the production environment. Often the reason for such failure is found in the irregular dyebath flow through the textile mass in production dyeing machines. A theoretical kinetic basis for the influence of dyebath flow on dyeing uniformity is reviewed...|$|E

40|$|The dyeing of textile {{materials}} is the most critical process in cloth production because of the strict technological requirements. In addition to the technical aspect, there have been increasing concerns over how to minimize the negative environmental impact of the dyeing industry. The emissions of pollutants are mainly caused by frequent cleaning operations which are necessary for initializing the <b>dyeing</b> <b>equipment,</b> as well as idled production capacity which leads to discharge of unconsumed chemicals. Motivated by these facts, we propose a methodology to reduce the pollutant emissions by means of systematic production scheduling. Firstly, we build a three-objective scheduling model that incorporates both the traditional tardiness objective and the environmentally-related objectives. A mixed-integer programming formulation is also provided to accurately define the problem. Then, we present a novel solution method for the sustainable scheduling problem, namely, a multi-objective genetic algorithm with tabu-enhanced iterated greedy local search strategy (MOGA-TIG). Finally, we conduct extensive computational experiments to investigate the actual performance of the MOGA-TIG. Based on a fair comparison with two state-of-the-art multi-objective optimizers, it is concluded that the MOGA-TIG is able to achieve satisfactory solution quality within tight computational time budget for the studied scheduling problem...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} years textile {{industries}} have focused their attention {{on the development of}} innovative environmental friendly processes and on the improvement of product quality. The use of ultrasounds (US) waves to improve dyeing processes of natural fibers has been investigated since the begin of fifties; it was shown that US are effective to reduce temperature and operative time of the dyeing. In particular this improvement is very important for natural fibers since reduction of temperature and dyeing time helps in maintaining optimal fiber properties. The tests, carried out in the frame of the Piemonte Regional Project INTEXUSA (INnovation in TEXtile productions by UltraSound Application), were aimed at evaluating the influence of the system geometry on the ultrasound waves propagation in a water-based medium. These runs were performed by monitoring the system with an Ultrasonic Energy Meter (by PPB Megasonics) to evaluate the cavitation energy distribution inside a dyeing prototypal equipment operating with different liquor depths. The main goal of this study was addressed to analyze the influence of the liquid depth on the cavitation phenomena, whose output can be useful to determine an optimal geometric configuration in a novel <b>dyeing</b> <b>equipment</b> provided by US transducers and minimize liquor ratio...|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} the textile {{industry}} has focused its attention both on the research of environmentally friendly processes and on the necessity of increasing the product quality. Recently, the use of ultrasounds (US) in dyeing has brought to valuable results, especially with natural fibres, where it was shown that dyeing at lower temperatures with an overall better quality of the final product is possible. The new process can be considered ready for an industrial application transfer. In {{the frame of the}} Regional Project INTEXUSA (INnovation in TEXtile productions by UltraSound Application) the study of the ultrasonic field in a water medium, inside a <b>dyeing</b> prototype <b>equipment,</b> was carried out by using a cavitometer (Ultrasonic Energy Meter, by PPB Megasonics) to measure the local cavitation energy and its spatial distribution. The tests were aimed at evaluating the influence of the operative conditions, typical of dyeing (such as temperature, internal liquor circulation, liquor ratio, distance from the US emitting device), on the US field. The same apparatus, where several dyeing processes are studied, was used for this investigation. The graphical visualization of the US field was carried out by integrating the measured data by means of Matlab softwar...|$|R

40|$|Fact {{sheet on}} an {{analysis}} system for dyebath {{processes in the}} carpet manufacturing industry written for the NICE 3 Program. The Georgia Institute of Technology (G. I. T.) has developed an effective automated dyebath analysis and reuse system that improves the energy, environmental, and economic performance of dyehouse batch operations. The new system enables dyeing solutions to be accurately monitored and adjusted for reuse. According to industry estimates, 160 pounds of water are used to produce each pound of textile product. The current wasteful batch dyeing process requires all water and residual chemicals, {{as well as the}} energy required to heat the mixture for dyeing, to be dumped after one application. Spent dyebaths can only be reused after they are sampled, analyzed, and reconstituted, a process requiring labor and expertise that are unavailable in the dyehouses. Therefore, successful commercial reuse depends on an automated analysis system that precisely analyzes dyebath samples in real-time and provides for reconstitution and reuse. If fully implemented throughout the carpet industry, this innovation is expected to reduce energy consumption by 3. 6 trillion Btu/year. Waste and cost savings will also be substantial. Though this project was developed for nylon carpet dyeing, the technology holds promise for widespread implementation in carpet manufacturing. In addition, it offers several opportunities involving other textile products, fiber types, dye classes, and <b>dyeing</b> <b>equipment...</b>|$|E
30|$|To {{evaluate}} and {{make use of}} RhB-ME based mito-thermometry, we applied it to study the thermogenesis of BA. For thermogenic studies of BAT or BA, calorimeter and oxygen consumption rate (OCR) have been frequently used to evaluate heat production (Clark et al. 1986; Wikstrom et al. 2014), but both are indirect and might be cumbersome (Cannon and Nedergaard 2004). Although the genetically coded thermometry is versatile for organelle targeting, due to low transfection efficiency of BA, {{it is difficult to}} be used for collecting large-scale datasets, which are usually necessary for experiments with large variations. Since {{there is no need for}} transfection, injection, or elaborate <b>equipment,</b> <b>dyes</b> (Arai et al. 2015; Homma et al. 2015) and RhB-ME-based mito-thermometry demonstrated in this study make it easier for large-scale data acquisition, and are capable of detecting thermogenic responses at mitochondrial level.|$|R
