25|$|The {{island was}} adjoined to the {{mainland}} of Australia {{until the end of}} the last glacial period about 10,000 years ago. Much of the island is composed of Jurassic <b>dolerite</b> intrusions (upwellings of magma) through other rock types, sometimes forming large columnar joints. Tasmania has the world's largest areas of <b>dolerite,</b> with many distinctive mountains and cliffs formed from this rock type. The central plateau and the southeast portions of the island are mostly <b>dolerite.</b> Mount Wellington above Hobart is a good example, showing distinct columns known as the Organ Pipes.|$|E
25|$|A <b>dolerite</b> dyke of Ordovician age intrudes the melange at Trwyn y Gorlech in {{the north}} whilst an olivine <b>dolerite</b> dyke of Tertiary age is seen at Cafn Enlli in the southeast. Further dykes occur in the cliffs at Ogof y Gaseg and at Ogof Hir.|$|E
25|$|Two {{separate}} {{periods of}} Whin <b>dolerite</b> injection are confirmed by studies of vitrinite reflectance over the Alston Block where two periods of Whin contact metamorphism have been recognized. The two periods of Whin <b>dolerite</b> emplacement {{form part of}} the end-Carboniferous earth movements in northern England. They can be shown to have occurred between a period of compression from a W-SW direction and later gentle doming of the Alston Block near the Westphalian-Stephanian boundary, dated about 300-295 Ma.|$|E
40|$|The mean {{direction}} of magnetization of samples collected from nine sites in the Umkondo lavas shows no significant difference {{from that of the}} Umkondo <b>dolerites</b> after demagnetization in alternating magnetic fields. This supports the contention of geologists that the <b>dolerites</b> are the intrusive phase of the lavas. The lavas exhibit considerably greater dispersion than the <b>dolerites</b> and it seems possible that the sampling of' the latter may have been insufficient to average out secular variation. The combined data for the lavas and the <b>dolerites</b> gives an estimate of the angular dispersion of the geomagnetic field in Umkondo times which is in good agreement with that calculated for the present field...|$|R

25|$|The {{quartzite}} and <b>dolerite</b> {{areas in}} the higher mountains show evidence of glaciation, and much of Australia's glaciated landscape is found on the Central Plateau and the Southwest. Cradle Mountain, another <b>dolerite</b> peak, for example, was a nunatak. The combination of these different rock types offers incredible scenery, much of it distinct from any other region of the world. In the far southwest corner of the state, the geology is almost completely quartzite, which gives the mountains the false impression of having snow-capped peaks year round.|$|E

40|$|The Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP), {{representing}} one of {{most extensive}} flood basalt regions of all time, {{is linked to}} the opening of the Atlantic Ocean at the Triassic-Jurassic transition ca. 200 Ma ago. CAMP rocks from Suriname and West Africa, two areas {{on opposite sides of the}} present-day Atlantic, were studied to examine magma evolution in a regional context and to explore the extent to which they have a common petrogenetic heritage. A detailed petrographic and geochemical investigation was performed on <b>dolerites</b> from Suriname, the Ivory Coast and Burkina Faso with the objective of characterizing their sources. Dykes in Suriname and the Ivory Coast are mainly tholeiitic basalts, while sills in Burkina Faso are mostly basaltic-andesites with tholeiitic as well as calc-alkaline affinities. The Suriname rocks are slightly more evolved (Mg#= 34 - 46) than the Ivory Coast <b>dolerites</b> (Mg#= 43 - 51), whereas the Burkina Faso <b>dolerites</b> include the least evolved compositions (Mg#= 45 - 66). Petrographic and geochemical observations suggest that moderate crustal contamination could have occurred during magma evolution. A geographic subdivision into high-Ti (1. 93 - 3. 70 wt. % TiO 2) and low low-Ti (0. 91 - 1. 18 wt. %) <b>dolerites</b> is consistent with a similar compositional grouping in other parts of the CAMP. However, overall geochemical characteristics tend to be distinct. The Suriname and Ivory Coast <b>dolerites</b> fall in a narrow zone of high-Ti magmatism along the margins of the present-day Atlantic Ocean, where preferential upwelling shortly before initial rifting has been proposed. According to trace-element signatures and results from partial melting models, the mantle sources of the Suriname and Ivory Coast <b>dolerites</b> were different from those of the Burkina Faso rocks. Minor differences in trace-element signatures point to inhomogeneity of sources and variations in melting conditions on regional as well as local scales. Relatively deep melting of a garnet-rich source with primitive-mantle like composition is inferred for the Suriname and Ivory Coast <b>dolerites,</b> whereas the Burkina Faso <b>dolerites</b> originated by shallower melting of a more spinel-rich source that might have been affected by subduction-type enrichment. Chemostratigraphic criteria, used in correlations of northern CAMP basalts, are not directly applicable to southern counterparts on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} the quartz <b>dolerites</b> has been {{attacked}} {{by a number of}} methods, yet much remains to be discovered regarding the differentiation of these rocks. Chemical methods and mineralogical studies, particularly with regard to the pyroxenes, have thrown much light upon the problem, but the extreme uniformity of the <b>dolerites</b> still remains unexplained, and makes the matter of attack on their genesis difficult...|$|R
25|$|Dykes of {{lamprophyre}} {{and more}} rarely <b>dolerite</b> are exposed {{in many parts}} of Orkney. They trend mainly NE-SW to N-S and are dated as Late Permian, associated with a period of crustal extension.|$|E

25|$|Northumberland has {{a diverse}} {{physical}} geography. It {{is low and}} flat near the North Sea coast and increasingly mountainous toward the northwest. The Cheviot Hills, in the northwest of the county, consist mainly of resistant Devonian granite and andesite lava. A second area of igneous rock underlies the Whin Sill (on which Hadrian's Wall runs), an intrusion of Carboniferous <b>dolerite.</b> Both ridges support a rather bare moorland landscape. Either side of the Whin Sill the county lies on Carboniferous Limestone, giving some areas of karst landscape. Lying {{off the coast of}} Northumberland are the Farne Islands, another <b>dolerite</b> outcrop, famous for their bird life.|$|E
25|$|Assam and {{adjoining}} regions have evidences {{of human}} settlements {{from all the}} periods of the Stone ages. The hills {{at the height of}} 1,500–2,000 feet (460 to 615m) were popular habitats probably due to availability of exposed <b>dolerite</b> basalt, useful for tool-making.|$|E
25|$|In the {{southern}} midlands {{as far south}} as Hobart, the <b>dolerite</b> is underlaid by sandstone and similar sedimentary stones.

The Svecofennian Loftahammar gabbro (Rb—Sr {{isochron}} age 1, 694 - 106 year) and Jotnian <b>dolerites</b> (K—Ar isochron age 1, 245 106 year) in Sweden {{were found}} to have palaeomagnetic pole positions in close agreement with poles from other Svecofennian rocks in Sweden and Jotnian <b>dolerites</b> in Finland, respectively.

A reconstruction of the position of the Baltic Shield during the (1, 900 — 1, 200) 10 6 -year interval, based on available pole positions, indicates that the Baltic shield was close to Greenland and the North American Shield and reveals a contiguity of North Atlantic geologic-geochronological zones until 1, 200 106 year ago...|$|R

25|$|Towards {{the close}} of Carboniferous Period some 295 million years ago (Ma), crustal {{extension}} caused by movement of the Earth’s tectonic plates allowed the emplacement of igneous intrusions of magma across much of northern England of a suite of tholeiitic <b>dolerite</b> intrusions.
