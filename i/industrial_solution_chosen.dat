40|$|An {{offering}} {{describes the}} elements through which {{a company can}} provide value for its customers. In the present study, we focus on an <b>industrial</b> <b>solution</b> provider's offering and its formulation by reviewing the solution business, services marketing, and project business literature, as well as conducting a case study. Based on our results, we propose a dynamic <b>industrial</b> <b>solution</b> offering (DISO) with two special characteristics that comprise dynamism and completeness. Furthermore, we propose a framework for DISO that contains three components that comprise relational, financial, and performance. We also present evidence for a new service category within <b>industrial</b> <b>solution</b> business: services supporting mutual action. An <b>industrial</b> <b>solution</b> business addresses collaboration with customers, and we regard this aspect as an element in the dynamic <b>industrial</b> <b>solution</b> offering. Finally, we found three main managerial issues to help build solution mindset that comprise collaboration with customers, organization-wide customer orientation, and effective service-driven organization...|$|R

40|$|The {{business}} logic {{in the manufacturing}} industry {{has changed in the}} 21 st century. In the current industrial market, manufacturers are driven to provide more comprehensive offerings that go beyond the traditional product-orientation by providing capacity and availability for their customers. From incidental merchandise, services have become the core of manufacturers’ offerings with long-lasting service agreements over the life-cycles of their products. This change is driven both by the need of providers to grow and gain competitive advantage and by increased customer demand caused by customers’ outsourcing trends. The three key drivers for manufacturers’ service strategies are outsourcing trends, saturation of the installed base, and commoditization in product markets. Thus, manufacturers focus on providing <b>industrial</b> <b>solutions</b> which are delivered through relational processes with customers by using solution-driven business models. In the management of marketing activities, this can be regarded as closer customer relationships, service-dominant {{business logic}}, and collaboration in solving customers’ problems. However, there are few studies on comprehensive conceptualizations of a solution offering that include different elements and their roles, especially in the context of capital goods industry. Also the transition process needs further studies in a real life context. This study explores the transition process of an industrial company from product to solution business and, as an aid to managing the solution business, explicates the structure and management of an <b>industrial</b> <b>solution</b> offering. There are two themes, the industrial transition process and <b>industrial</b> <b>solution</b> offering. Regarding the industrial transition process, the aim is to understand the supplier view on the process and its execution and to determine the challenges related to the transition process. The <b>industrial</b> <b>solution</b> offering is discussed by its elements and characteristics, as well as management. Furthermore, a special type of build-own-operate-transfer business model is presented and its suitability in the industrial context analyzed. The study includes findings achieved by qualitative methods and from four case companies. Based on the results, it is tentatively suggested that in the <b>industrial</b> <b>solution</b> business, the transition from product to solution business is not a linear project but an evolving process that varies according to customer needs, which suggests that companies need to possess an ability to develop new business models for different customer needs. The <b>industrial</b> <b>solution</b> offering is dynamic as it evolves in collaboration according to the prevailing and latent customer needs, which suggest restructuring of the organization from a product-centric to a customer-centric one. Furthermore, based on the findings, the concept of <b>industrial</b> <b>solutions</b> is defined as an ongoing relational process to satisfy a customer’s particular business or operational requirements, and the concept of <b>industrial</b> <b>solution</b> offering as an entity comprising the customized goods, services, collaboration, and finance needed to fulfill the <b>industrial</b> <b>solution.</b> Finally, the study offers several managerial implications for industrial managers involved in the transition and management of the solution business and its offering...|$|R
