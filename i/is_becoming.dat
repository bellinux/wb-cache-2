5|$|Ben Nevis <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> {{popular with}} ski mountaineers and boarders. The Red Burn (Allt Coire na h-Urcaire) {{just to the}} North of the tourist path gives the easiest descent, but {{most if not all}} of the easier gullies on the North Face have been skied, as has the slope once adorned by the abseil poles into Coire Leis. No 4 gully is {{probably}} the most skied. Although Tower scoop makes it a no-fall zone, Tower Gully <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> popular, especially in May and June when there is spring snow.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years, Tokyo Narita Airport {{had been the}} main hub of International and Freight flights. Nowadays, Tokyo Haneda Airport <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> an International Hub because it {{is closer to the}} Tokyo metropolis.|$|E
5|$|Kuala Lumpur also <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> {{the centre}} for new media, {{innovation}} and creative industry {{development in the}} region and hosts the international creative industry event, Kreative.Asia.|$|E

50|$|By 1943 it <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> {{obvious to}} the German army that {{conventional}} anti-tank gun design had reached its practical limits. Traditional high-velocity guns that relied on kinetic energy to defeat heavily armored targets <b>were</b> <b>becoming</b> so bulky {{in order to}} deal with the new generation of tanks that they <b>were</b> <b>becoming</b> too heavy for front line use, and too expensive to produce.|$|R
50|$|Some {{applications}} <b>are</b> <b>becoming</b> {{more relevant}} to our time period as advances in technology progress. Astroengineering projects like orbital towers (or orbital elevators) <b>are</b> <b>becoming</b> more technically feasible due to such technological advances.|$|R
5|$|Although space vector {{pulse-width}} modulation (SVPWM) <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> increasingly popular, sinusoidal PWM (SPWM) is {{the most}} straightforward method used to vary drives' motor voltage (or current) and frequency. With SPWM control (see Fig. 1), quasi-sinusoidal, variable-pulse-width output is constructed from intersections of a saw-toothed carrier signal with a modulating sinusoidal signal which is variable in operating frequency {{as well as in}} voltage (or current).|$|E
5|$|Clindamycin may {{be useful}} in skin and soft tissue infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA); many strains of MRSA are still {{susceptible}} to clindamycin; however, in the United States spreading from the West Coast eastwards, MRSA <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> increasingly resistant.|$|E
5|$|Ethnic {{heritage}} cooking, both Sephardic and Ashkenazi, {{has made}} a comeback with the growing acceptance of the heterogeneous society. Apart from home cooking, many ethnic foods are now available in street markets, supermarkets and restaurants, or are served at weddings and bar mitzvahs, and people increasingly eat foods from ethnic backgrounds other than their own. Overlap and combinations of foods from different ethnic groups <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> standard as a multi-ethnic food culture develops.|$|E
60|$|She <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> quieter. He {{thanked the}} God of mercy that {{at last she}} <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> quieter. His head felt so strange and blazed. Still he held her close, with {{trembling}} arms. His blood seemed very strong, enveloping her.|$|R

40|$|While industrialized {{countries}} <b>are</b> <b>becoming</b> service economies, all countries <b>are</b> <b>becoming</b> global. As competition becomes more global, understanding and accommodating {{the needs of}} international customers with different cultural backgrounds has become increasingly important. This study highlights cross-cultural perceptions of service problems in the tourist industry...|$|R
5|$|Every year it <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> {{more and}} more {{difficult}} for football clubs of any standing to meet their friendly engagements and even arrange friendly matches. The consequence is that at the last moment, through cup-tie interference, clubs are compelled to take on teams who will not attract the public.|$|E
5|$|Fast pace {{of life in}} Viet Nam {{during the}} decades of {{integration}} and development witnesses {{the changes in the}} traditional ao dai. This {{does not mean that the}} traditional ao dai is disappearing from Vietnamese life. Yet, it <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> more adaptable to these modern days.|$|E
5|$|However, {{adaptation}} {{to climate change}} has been demonstrated in many cases. These are usually due to a shift in coral and zooxanthellae genotypes. These shifts in allele frequency have progressed toward more tolerant types of zooxanthellae. Scientists found that a certain scleractinian zooxanthella <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> more common where sea temperature is high. Symbionts able to tolerate warmer water seem to photosynthesise more slowly, implying an evolutionary trade-off.|$|E
50|$|Alternative {{energy sources}} <b>are</b> <b>becoming</b> less costly.|$|R
50|$|Environmental issues <b>are</b> <b>becoming</b> more {{politically}} sensitive.|$|R
50|$|Chrono-Quartz watches <b>are</b> <b>becoming</b> {{collectible}} {{and examples}} in excellent original condition are fetching prices {{in excess of}} $1500 - $2000. Condition of the watches is important as spares such as circuits and motors <b>are</b> <b>becoming</b> sought after and servicing can become expensive if new parts are required.|$|R
5|$|In Asia, {{the species}} {{has been found}} in Japan, Taiwan, Polynesia, Java, and Sri Lanka. In Japan, the fungus <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> more scarce as its natural habits are decreasing. Several Australian field guides have {{reported}} the species from that country. The fungus has also been recorded several times from Brazil. Mycena chlorophos was one of several fungi featured in a set of postage stamps issued in Samoa in 1985.|$|E
5|$|In Melbourne, a {{traditional}} and authentic Nativity Scene <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> very popular at St. Elizabeth’s Parish, Dandenong North. This annual Australian Nativity Scene creator and artist Wilson Fernandez {{has been building}} and creating the traditional nativity scenes since 2004 at St. Elizabeth’s Parish.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) puts NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) {{in charge}} of {{reducing}} the fictional sketch comedy show The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordans (TGS) carbon footprint. Meanwhile, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) learns her apartment <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> a condominium and tries to kick out the resident above her (Corddry). At the same time, Jack and Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) reevaluate fatherhood.|$|E
50|$|In English, {{the terms}} {{miscegenation}} and amalgamation {{were used for}} unions between the races. These terms are now often considered offensive and <b>are</b> <b>becoming</b> obsolete. The terms mixed-race, biracial or multiracial <b>are</b> <b>becoming</b> generally accepted. In other languages, translations of miscegenation did not become politically incorrect.|$|R
50|$|Previous to 1852, Fedotov's {{behaviour}} was {{not considered}} too far out of line, although he showed some signs of depression. He <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> withdrawn, suffered from headaches, and was aging rapidly; his eyesight <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> worse. He <b>was</b> always concerned about money and was working too hard.|$|R
25|$|Electrical sockets with {{included}} RCDs <b>are</b> <b>becoming</b> common.|$|R
5|$|In {{traditional}} times, Māori had a rich {{knowledge of}} the cabbage tree, including spiritual, ecological and many practical aspects of its use. While much of that specialised knowledge was lost after the European settlement of New Zealand, {{the use of the}} tree as food and medicine has persisted, and the use of its fibres for weaving <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> more common.|$|E
5|$|Les Amis {{says it is}} {{too late}} to save the sector of Bersée, which was removed from the race because of its {{dangerous}} state in 2007. The situation <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> critical, it says, at the Pont Gibus at Wallers, at Mons-en-Pévèle, Pont Thibaut at Ennevelin, the pavé of the Duclos-Lassalle section at Cysoing, and at Camphin-en-Pévèle.|$|E
5|$|The Emperor first {{appeared}} in The Empire Strikes Back. He appears in hologram form to address Darth Vader, his Sith apprentice. He tells Vader that Luke Skywalker <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> {{a serious threat to}} the Empire and must not become a Jedi. Vader convinces him that Luke would be a great asset if turned to the dark side.|$|E

5|$|The Main Stand {{houses the}} VIP area, {{directors}} box and various suites. The Tranmere suite {{was added to}} the Main Stand in 1988, with the Dixie Dean suite, Bunny Bell bar and Dave Russell restaurant added soon after. The 40-year-old structure <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> increasingly expensive to repair.|$|E
5|$|The West Kootenay, however, is {{transitioning}} from a coal-mining to a tourism-based economy, and {{the rest}} of the Kootenay region is also starting to do so. The economy of southeastern British Columbia <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> increasingly reliant on tourism, and several Canadian national and state parks have already been established, and several national forests in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|The {{cohabitation}} lifestyle <b>is</b> <b>becoming</b> {{more popular}} in today's generation. It is more convenient for couples {{not to get}} married {{because it can be}} cheaper and simpler. As divorce rates rise in society, the desire to get married is less attractive for couples uncertain of their long-term plans.|$|E

40|$|There are a {{range of}} major {{industry}} factors placing upward pressure on the energy intensity of primary copper production. Copper ore grades are declining, mines <b>are</b> <b>becoming</b> deeper and deposits <b>are</b> <b>becoming</b> more complex. However, {{at the same time}} the individual processes employed during mining, mineral processing and metal production <b>are</b> <b>becoming</b> more efficient. Given these competing trends, a good question to ask: has the rate of innovation by engineers and the research community been exceeding the upward pressure on energy intensity created by trends at the mine-sites...|$|R
