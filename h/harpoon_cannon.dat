500|$|Commercial whaling was {{historically}} {{important as}} an industry well throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Whaling {{was at that time}} a sizable European industry with ships from Britain, France, Spain, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Germany, sometimes collaborating to hunt whales in the Arctic. By the early 1790s, whalers, namely the British (Australian) and Americans, started to focus efforts in the South Pacific; in the mid 1900s, over 50,000 humpback whale were taken from the South Pacific. At its height in the 1880s, U.S. profits turned to USD10,000,000, equivalent to USD225,000,000 today. Commonly exploited species included arctic whales such as the gray whale, right whale, and bowhead whale because they were close to the main whaling ports, like New Bedford. After those stocks were depleted, rorquals in the South Pacific were targeted by nearly all whaling organizations; however, they often out-swam whaling vessels. Whaling rorquals was not effective until the <b>harpoon</b> <b>cannon</b> was invented in the late 1860s. Whaling basically stopped when stocks of all species were depleted to a point that they could not be harvested on a commercial scale. Whaling was controlled in 1982 when the International Whaling Commission (IWC) placed a moratorium setting catch limits to protect species from dying out from over-exploitation, and eventually banned it: ...|$|E

50|$|Svend Foyn (July 9, 1809 - November 30, 1894) was a Norwegian whaling, {{shipping}} magnate and philanthropist. He pioneered revolutionary {{methods for}} hunting and processing whales. Svend Foyn introduced the modern <b>harpoon</b> <b>cannon</b> and brought whaling {{into a modern}} age.|$|E
50|$|Modern minke whaling is {{conducted}} by many small to medium-sized fishing boats {{in spring and}} summer seasons. These vessels are equipped with a 50 mm or 60 mm <b>harpoon</b> <b>cannon</b> and penthrite grenade tipped harpoons designed to explode inside the whale.

2500|$|Norwegian-style modern whaling, {{based on}} the use of {{power-driven}} vessels, <b>cannons</b> and exploding <b>harpoons,</b> was introduced in the Meiji period largely through the efforts of Jūrō Oka who is considered the [...] "father of modern Japanese whaling". Oka traveled the world gathering information about whaling practices including to Norway for <b>harpoons,</b> <b>cannons</b> and expertise. He also established the first modern whaling company in Japan in 1899, Nihon Enyo Gyogyo K.K. which took its first whale on February 4, 1900, with a Norwegian gunner, Morten Pedersen.|$|R
50|$|In mid-July 1976, the Canadian Greenpeace {{deployed}} a {{newly acquired}} ship, an ex-minesweeper called the James Bay, {{to confront the}} Dalniy Vostok factory ship and its catcher fleet once again. The activists found the Russian whalers midway between California and Hawaii. However, this time the whalers did not fire their <b>harpoon</b> <b>cannons.</b> Instead, the Russian fleet retreated and Greenpeace chased the whalers for two days and nights before being forced to return to Hawaii for refueling. After replenishing their fuel and supplies, the activists found and disrupted the Russian fleet again and chased the whalers northward {{as far as their}} fuel permitted.|$|R
50|$|In 1898, Jūrō Oka (father {{of modern}} Japanese whaling) toured {{the world to}} learn about modern whaling. He {{traveled}} to Norway for <b>harpoons</b> and <b>cannons,</b> and returned to Japan to establish its first modern whaling company, Nihon Enyo Gyogyo K.K. (later named Toyo Hogei K.K.). February 4, 1900, Oka's Norwegian gunner, Morten Pedersen, shot the first whale. Pedersen had previously worked with the Russians and was employed with a lucrative three-year contract. Other Norwegian whalers found employment with Japanese companies as well. Norwegian newspapers expressed concerns over {{the creation of a}} fierce foreign competitor with Norwegian assistance.|$|R

50|$|A <b>harpoon</b> <b>cannon</b> is a whaling {{implement}} {{developed in}} the late 19th century and most used in the 20th century. It would be mounted on the bow of a whale catcher, where it could be easily aimed with a wide field of view at the target. Powered by black powder and later, smokeless powder, it would generally fire a large steel harpoon, either solid steel (cold harpoon) or fitted with an exploding black powder, or later, penthrite (PETN) grenade.|$|E

40|$|Whaling for {{humpback}} whales, Megaptera novaeangliae, in the North At- lantic Ocean {{has occurred}} in various forms (e. g. for local subsistence, for oil to be sold commercially, using hand <b>harpoons</b> and deck-mounted <b>cannons,</b> using oar-driven open boats and modern powered catcher boats) from the early 1600 ’s to the present. Several previous attempts to estimate the total numbers of humpback whales removed were considered close to comprehensive, but some uncertainties remained. Moreover, the statistical uncertainty was not consistently presented with the previous estimates. Therefore, we have pursued several avenues of additional data collection and conducted further analyses to close outstanding data gaps and address remaining issues. Our new estimates of landings and total removals of humpback whales from the North Atlantic are 21, 476 (SE= 214) and 30, 842 (SE= 655), respectively. These results include statistical uncertainty, reflect new data and improved analysis methods, and take account of some fisheries for which estimates had not been made previously. The new estimates are not sufficiently different from previous ones to resolve the major inconsistencies and discrepancies encountered in efforts to determine the conservation status of humpback whale populations in the North Atlantic...|$|R

50|$|Whale hunting {{became an}} {{important}} industry around 1900. At first slow whales were caught by men hurling harpoons from small open boats. Mechanization copied from Norway brought in cannon-fired harpoons, strong cables, and steam winches mounted on maneuverable, steam-powered catcher boats. They made possible the targeting of large and fast-swimming whale species that were taken to shore-based stations for processing. The invention of the <b>harpoon</b> <b>cannon</b> in the 1860s and the westward expansion of the Scandinavian industry that resulted from the rapid depletion of their local stocks resulted {{in the emergence of}} the modern whaling industry in off Newfoundland and Labrador. The industry was highly cyclical, with well-defined catch peaks in 1903-05, 1925-30, 1945-51, and 1966-72, after which world-wide bans shut it down.|$|E
50|$|With this development, he {{launched}} Norway {{into a new}} and profitable industry. After years of perfecting a cannon that could fire a grenade and harpoon simultaneously, Foyn finally managed to catch 30 whales in 1868. These increased efficiency and volume, enabling the harvest not only {{of all of the}} species that had been hunted for, but also the largest species which had eluded all previous hunting technologies. The whaling industry was in decline when Foyn first began his development of the bow-mounted <b>harpoon</b> <b>cannon.</b> Foyn's eventual successful development of the cannon, in combination with fast and sleek steam-powered catcher vessels, ushered in a modern whaling industry that was to become dominated first by the Norwegians, then the British and finally the Russians and Japanese.|$|E
5000|$|A Newfoundland whaling {{company began}} {{catching}} [...] "little piked whales" [...] (minke whales) off northeastern Newfoundland in 1947, taking 16 {{in its first}} year and 41 in 1948. A total of 812 minke whales were caught off Newfoundland between 1947 and 1972, with a peak of 97 in 1972. They were captured by one to three 12.2 to 15.2 m wood-hulled vessels that had a 50 mm <b>harpoon</b> <b>cannon</b> mounted on their bows. Whales were towed to a shore station for flensing. They were first caught in Conception, Bonavista, and Trinity bays, but later catches (1966 to 1972) were mainly made in Trinity Bay itself. The season extended from May to September (rarely October), with peak catches being made in June and July. A small number - 51 between 1962 and 1967 - were also caught off Nova Scotia, with the season lasting from June to August.|$|E
50|$|On June 27, 1975, {{members of}} Canadian Greenpeace {{took the first}} ever direct action against whalers who were {{actively}} whaling near the Mendocino Ridge about 40 miles west of California. The Greenpeace activists navigated small inflatable Zodiac boats between the Russian whalers of the Dalniy Vostok fleet and the hunted whales. The tactic was intended to prevent the whaling ship gunner from firing the <b>harpoon</b> <b>cannon</b> due {{to the risk of}} accidentally striking and harming one of the activists. However, the Russian catcher ship Vlastny fired directly over the heads of Robert Hunter and activist Paul Watson. The event was filmed by Greenpeace and later broadcast in the United States by the CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite and other major television networks. The activists were unable to stop the Russian whalers but the airing of this event on television was significant in raising public awareness by making the Save the Whales movement front-page news for the first time.|$|E

5000|$|Minke whales {{were first}} {{exploited}} by Greenlanders off western Greenland in 1948, when a fishing vessel mounted with a <b>harpoon</b> <b>cannon</b> began catching them. This vessel averaged 18 whales per annum (range four to 32), before being joined by three other vessels in 1958. The {{number of vessels}} participating in the hunt each year increased rapidly, rising from 18 in 1963, to 25 in 1964, and to 45 in 1965. The peak was reached in 1968 and 1969, with 56 vessels active in both years. From 1970 to 1976 the average fluctuated between about 30 and 45 vessels. A total of 3,434 minke whales were taken off western Greenland between 1948 and 1976, with a peak of 315 reached in 1968. The vast majority of these whales were taken by fishing vessels normally targeting cod, shrimp, or salmon, but an increasing number in later years were caught using {{a number of small}} boats with out-board motors, armed with high-powered rifles for killing the whale and hand-held harpoons and floating bladders to secure them; walkie-talkies were used for coordination. Usage of this method, called a [...] "collective catch", increased from a catch of just one whale in 1970 to 59 in 1975.|$|E
