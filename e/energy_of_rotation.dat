50|$|The {{thermal process}} in the vortex tube can be {{estimated}} in the following way: 1) The adiabatic expansion of the incoming gas, which cools the gas and turns its heat energy into the kinetic <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation.</b> The total enthalpy (which {{is the sum of}} the enthalpy and the kinetic energy), however, is being conserved. 2) The peripheric rotating gas flow moves towards the hot outlet. Here the heat recuperation effect takes place between the quickly rotating peripheric flow and the opposite slowly rotating axial flow. Here the heat transfers from axial flow to the peripheric one. 3) The kinetic <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> turns into the heat energy by the means of the viscous dissipation. The temperature of the gas rises. As the total enthalpy has been increased during the heat recuperation process, this temperature is higher than the incoming gas. 4) Some of the hot gas leaves the hot outlet, carrying away the excess heat. 5) The rest of the gas turns towards the cold outlet. As it passes its way to the cold outlet, its heat energy is transferred to the peripheric flow. Although the temperature at the axis and at the periphery is about the same everywhere, the rotation is slower at the axis, so the total enthalpy is lower as well. 6) The low total enthalpy cooled gas from the axial flow leaves the cold outlet.|$|E
50|$|The {{specific}} strength is a material's strength (force {{per unit area}} at failure) divided by its density. It {{is also known as}} the strength-to-weight ratio or strength/weight ratio. In fiber or textile applications, tenacity is the usual measure of {{specific strength}}. The SI unit for specific strength is Pa m3/kg, or N·m/kg, which is dimensionally equivalent to m2/s2, though the latter form is rarely used.

40|$|We {{study the}} linear {{stability}} of weakly magnetized differentially rotating plasmas in both collisionless kinetic theory and Braginskii's theory of collisional, magnetized plasmas. We {{focus on the}} very weakly magnetized limit that is important for understanding how astrophysical magnetic fields originate and are amplified at high redshift. We show that the single instability of fluid theory - the magnetorotational instability mediated by magnetic tension - is replaced by two distinct instabilities, one associated with ions and one with electrons. Each of these has {{a different way of}} tapping into the free <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> differential <b>rotation.</b> The ion instability is driven by viscous transport of momentum across magnetic field lines due to a finite ion cyclotron frequency (gyroviscosity); the fastest growing modes have wavelengths significantly longer than MHD and Hall MHD predictions. The electron instability is a whistler mode driven unstable by the temperature anisotropy generated by differential rotation; the growth time can be orders of magnitude shorter than the rotation period. The electron instability {{is an example of a}} broader class of instabilities that tap into the free <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> differential <b>rotation</b> or shear via the temperature anisotropy they generate. We briefly discuss the application of our results to the stability of planar shear flows and show that such flows are linearly overstable in the presence of fluid gyroviscosity.

5000|$|As to {{rotation}} {{about an}} atom's axis (again, whether the atom is bound or free), its <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> {{is proportional to}} the moment of inertia for the atom, which is extremely small compared to moments of inertia of collections of atoms. This is because almost all of the mass of a single atom is concentrated in its nucleus, which has a radius too small to give a significant moment of inertia. In contrast, the spacing of quantum energy levels for a rotating object is inversely proportional to its moment of inertia, and so this spacing becomes very large for objects with very small moments of inertia. For these reasons, the contribution from rotation of atoms on their axes is essentially zero in monatomic gases, because the energy spacing of the associated quantum levels is too large for significant thermal energy to be stored in rotation of systems with such small moments of inertia. For similar reasons, axial rotation around bonds joining atoms in diatomic gases (or along the linear axis in a linear molecule of any length) can also be neglected as a possible [...] "degree of freedom" [...] as well, since such rotation is similar to rotation of monatomic atoms, and so occurs about an axis with a moment of inertia too small to be able to store significant heat energy.|$|E

40|$|A weak-field local MHD {{instability}} that is {{of importance}} to accretion disks is examined.

In particular, all Keplerian disks are unstable in the presence of any weak poloidal field, with the ratio of the maximum growth rate to disk angular velocity given by 3 / 4. The maximum growth rate of any weak field configuration that is not purely toroidal is given by the local Oort A-value of the disk. The behavior is studied by using a form of the dynamical Hill equations.

The finite-element approach and an algorithm for {{the solution of}} corresponding problems are developed and implemented in a code FIDESYS.

Various problems on stress-induced nucleation and evolution of martensitic variants in nanosize samples are solved, including a rectangular sample with single and multiple circular or elliptical nanovoids (with and without surface tension), as well as nanotube and beam. Importance of finite strain formulation is demonstrated. In particular, for the case when structural instability (buckling) of a beam is caused by phase transformation, for a geometrically linear formulation, phase transformation is suppressed. This is because finite <b>rotation</b> increases the <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> the system, while in a geometrically nonlinear theory <b>energy</b> is independent <b>of</b> <b>rotation.</b> Similar phase field and numerical approaches can be applied for twinning, dislocations, and reconstructive transformations...|$|R
