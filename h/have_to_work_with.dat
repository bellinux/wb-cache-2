Brazilian universities now have the capacity to develop nanoscale materials for drug delivery, he says, but ‘our domestic pharmaceutical companies don’t have internal capabilities in research and development, so we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> them to push new products and processes out to market’.|$|E
25|$|Matthew Sykes (Caan), {{a police}} detective, loses his partner Bill Tuggle (Brown) in a shootout; the detectives {{had been trying}} to stop two Newcomer criminals murdering another Newcomer named Porter at a grocery, in what {{appeared}} to be a robbery. The next day, Sykes' superior Captain Warner (McCarthy), informs his squad that they will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> the newly promoted Newcomer detective Sam Francisco (Patinkin). Although biased, Sykes enlists to work with Francisco to investigate a similar homicide with a Newcomer named Warren Hubely, feeling that if he investigates that crime, he will also find opportunities to investigate his partner's death (which he is officially forbidden to do).|$|E

They have to act this way, because of the co-operative relationships they necessarily <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> in the division of labour. People have to conform to them, whether they like it or not. If they take on a role, they have to fulfill the packet of tasks {{which is part of the}} job.|$|E

25|$|People {{often say}} that {{machines}} enslave man and that technology dehumanises society, {{but they are}} wrong! It is the manufacturer that enslaves man. It is to the manufacturer that man is condemned to a life sentence of forced labour. The manufacturer enslaves man, but robots free us. The only reason that technology is dehumanising society is because humans still <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> the machines used for forced labour, or because they must clock in to where the forced labour takes place. That is the problem, humans and machines should not be mixed together. Humans are designed to spend their time in places of fulfilment, while machines are designed to function in the workplace, {{under the supervision of}} robots and computers.|$|E
500|$|Del Toro {{acknowledged}} this message's simplicity, {{but said}} {{he would have liked to}} have seen adventure films with similar morals when he was a child. The film's ten primary characters all have [...] "little arcs" [...] conducive to this idea; del Toro stated: [...] "I think that's a great message to give kids… 'That guy you were beating the shit out of ten minutes ago? That's the guy you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> five minutes later.' That's life… We can only be complete when we work together." [...] The director noted that Hellboy and The Devil's Backbone told the same message, though the latter conveyed it in a very different way.|$|E
500|$|Incorporating Nixon {{into the}} plot was accidental; Moffat {{wanted to set}} the story during the moon landing and looked up the United States {{president}} during the time. He was initially disappointed that {{it was such a}} [...] "rubbish one" [...] and briefly considered using a generic, unnamed president, such as the one seen in [...] "The Sound of Drums". However, he thought it [...] "didn't feel right for a story partly about real events" [...] and realized it could be fun to use Nixon. He believed there was something [...] "comically awkward" [...] about him, and it would be interesting for the Doctor to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> someone he did not like.

500|$|English writer Brian Sibley found Travers still gun-shy {{from her}} {{experiences}} with Disney {{when he was}} hired in the 1980s to write a possible Mary Poppins sequel. Sibley reported that Travers told him, [...] "I could only agree if I could do {{it on my own}} terms. I'd <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> someone I trust." [...] Regardless, while watching the original film together—the first time Travers had seen it since the premiere—she became excited at times and thought certain aspects were excellent, while others were unappealing. The sequel never went to production, and when approached to do a stage adaptation in the 1990s, she only acquiesced on the condition that English-born writers and no one from the film production were to be directly involved with the musical's development.|$|E
500|$|The song's {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Anthony Mandler, and shot on an indoor soundstage in Castaic, California on April 23, 2008. The concept for the video was [...] "high-end erotica". In an interview with James Montgomery for MTV News whilst on set of the music video, Levine provided a summary of what the video would entail, saying: [...] "It's this kind of ultra-glamorous, photography-based, late-'70s/ early-'80s situation. It's really stylish and really beautiful... It's the most choreographed thing I've ever done, because usually I just {{get up there and}} screw around. But with Rihanna, it's completely different and so cool." [...] In response, Rihanna continued to say that [...] "I don't do a lot of videos where I have so much chemistry with the other artist, and this is only my second duet in a video... It's really intense, because you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> each other so much. It's new for me, but I'm enjoying it." ...|$|E
500|$|Producer Marc E. Platt {{contacted}} actor Ryan Gosling about Drive early on. Platt explained: [...] "I {{have this}} list that I've created of very talented individuals whose work inspire me [...] writers, directors, actors whom I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> before I go onto another career {{or do something}} else with my life." [...] Near the top of Platt's list was Gosling, who, despite having starred in several films of diverse genres, had never starred in anything like Drive. He had {{always been interested in}} doing an action-oriented project. Gosling claimed that he was simply put off from the genre, believing that the action films of today focused more on stunts instead of characters. Despite this, Platt heard back from the actor around 48 hours later. Gosling has stated that his strong attraction to the plot led him to take on the leading role of the unnamed driver, saying that he was drawn to the [...] "very strong character" [...] at its core, as well as the [...] "powerful" [...] romance.|$|E

She wanted to work with him since she heard [...] "Let Me Love You" [...] (2004) by Mario, which Ne-Yo wrote. When the production for A Girl like Me started, she considered working with him. She said, [...] "So for the second album, I was like, 'You know what? I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> that guy Ne-Yo.' So we went into the studio and we started working on this song." [...] Ne-Yo and Norwegian production duo Mikkel S. Eriksen and Tor Erik Hermansen collectively known as StarGate wrote [...] "Unfaithful", which Rihanna said was [...] "new ground for [...] " [...] because it was a ballad. It was produced by StarGate while Debbie Mounsey served as a production assistant. [...] "Unfaithful" [...] was recorded by Eriksen, Al Hemberger, Malcolm Pollack and Tiger Stylz at Battery and Avatar Studios in New York City, Loft Recording Studios in Bronxville and Digital Insight Recording Studios in Las Vegas. It was mixed by Phil Tan and Makeba Riddick provided the vocal production.|$|E
500|$|Alec Hanley Bemis of LA Weekly highly criticized Spears and {{the music}} video. He thought that the singer's [...] "lack of musical talent" [...] had begun to affect her career, after Dark was {{selected}} {{as the director of the}} video. Bemis commented, however, that Spears' already had [...] "a history of questionable decisions", and cited her Rolling Stone photoshoot done in early 1999, which was condemned by the American Family Association, as an example. [...] He continued to state that the plotline set the singer [...] "on the fast track to adulthood" [...] and questioned, [...] "who's in bed with Britney now? While a TV tabloid recently reported that an old bayou beau in Louisiana has mother Spears’ approval, fantasizing fans want to believe Britney‘s dallying with that braided moppet from N’Sync or a member of the Backstreet Boys. But the only verifiable fact we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> is that Spears has started running with a darker L.A. crowd." [...] Bemis finished his review saying that [...] "no avant-garde film techniques [...] But Britney's lips glisten so... Speaking frankly, this light in our lives hurts us, from the fire in our loins to the bottom of our broken hearts." ...|$|E
500|$|After the {{accession}} of Henry II, Nigel {{was summoned}} to reorganize the Exchequer, or treasury, that {{was responsible for the}} production of the government's financial records, including the Pipe Rolls. The king had to ask Nigel several times to return before the bishop agreed, and one reason for Nigel's reluctance may have been that he would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> Robert, Earl of Leicester, one of the Beaumonts, who had been responsible for turning Stephen against Nigel's family in 1139. Another of Nigel's colleagues in the administration was a layman, Richard de Lucy, who served as a justice until 1178. Nigel was the only surviving minister of Henry I, and his knowledge of the Exchequer was needed to help reorganize the revenues of the king and restore administrative practices lost during Stephen's reign. The lone pipe roll to survive from Henry I's reign, for the year 1130, may be Nigel's own copy, brought with him to the Exchequer when he returned under Henry II. [...] Nigel was able to increase the revenues compared to what had been collected under Stephen, but he was unable to quickly return them to the amounts collected under Henry I. It may have been Nigel who urged the king to attempt to recover estates that had been alienated during Stephen's reign.|$|E

Before a reopening date could be set, the operator would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> the land owner and their insurance company. Due to risk of rock and tree fall on much of the sloped land, the operator has not been able to assess the damage fully, but announced that [...] "it's not going to be a quick fix". Much of the damage is worse than initially thought, and the lift's 36-tonne haul rope will have to be replaced. Many of the trees will have to be felled, and fire breaks cut by the firefighters have also caused much damage. The operator has laid of 30 staff, many of whom were on fixed-term contracts.|$|E
2500|$|Moore-Bick {{is seen as}} aloof {{and lacking}} empathy; he {{concerned}} residents by suggesting only the technical causes of the fire would be investigated. Dent Coad said she still had less than “total confidence” in Moore-Bick, but “we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> the system we have, unfortunately.” Sources close to the inquiry suggest Moore-Bick is thinking of proposing an advisory panel. He is also inclined to recommend a two-stage inquiry: the first stage investigating the immediate causes of the fire, the second investigating broader issues over a longer period. Dent Coad said {{there must be a}} legal commitment to a second stage. [...] "We need to look at all the broader issues. One of the concerns about a two part inquiry – like with Hillsborough – is if it’s held off for too long and then it doesn’t happen at all, so that's a concern."
