40|$|Several {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} to evaluate the cost of meat and poultry product recalls to food firms. The goal of this analysis is to formally test whether or not subsequent recalls are associated with less negative stock price returns, and {{whether or not there is}} a difference in the magnitude of returns between a first, second, and third or more recall. This is completed through an event study analysis. Results indicate that recurring recall events affecting a firm within 12 months of the first recall incident are indeed associated with less impactful negative outcomes. On average, initial recall events are associated with short-term reductions in shareholder wealth of up to $ 236 million, 5 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> the <b>recall</b> announcement, while no negative reactions are found for subsequent <b>recall</b> events <b>after</b> the initial <b>recall</b> announcement date...|$|R

On 21 October 2016, the CNE suspended the referendum only days before preliminary signature-gatherings were to be held. The CNE blamed alleged voter fraud as the reason for the cancellation of the referendum.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} that regulate B cell {{memory and the}} rapid recall response to antigen remain poorly defined. This study focuses on the rapid expression of B cell memory upon antigen recall in vivo, and the replenishment of quiescent B cell memory that follows. Based on expression of CD 138 and B 220, we reveal a unique and major subtype of antigen-specific memory B cells (B 220 �CD 138 �) that are distinct from antibody-secreting B cells (B 220 �/�CD 138 �) and B 220 �CD 138 � memory B cells. These nonsecreting somatically mutated B 220 � memory responders rapidly dominate the splenic response and comprise � 95 % of antigen-specific memory B cells that migrate to the bone marrow. By <b>day</b> 42 <b>after</b> <b>recall,</b> the predominant quiescent memory B cell population in the spleen (75 – 85 %) and the bone marrow (� 95 %) expresses the B 220 � phenotype. Upon adoptive transfer, B 220 � memory B cells proliferate {{to a lesser degree}} but produce greater amounts of antibody than their B 220 � counterparts. The pattern of cellular differentiation after transfer indicates that B 220 � memory B cells act as stable self-replenishing intermediates that arise from B 220 � memory B cells and produce antibody-secreting cells on rechallenge with antigen. Cell surface phenotype and Ig isotype expression divide the B 220 � compartment into two main subsets with distinct patterns of integrin and coreceptor expression. Thus, we identify new cellular components of B cell memory and propose a model for long-term protective immunity that is regulated by a complex balance of committed memory B cells with subspecialized immune function.

40|$|This article {{presents}} two studies that investigated {{the impact of}} the retrieval of self-defining memories on individuals' sense of self. Participants recalled positive and/or negative self-defining memories, rated memory characteristics and completed measures focusing on different self-aspects. Study 1 found that participants reported higher state self-esteem <b>after</b> <b>recalling</b> a positive memory than <b>after</b> <b>recalling</b> a negative one. They also reported lower negative self-consistency and higher state self-concept clarity and positive self-consistency, but this result became non-significant after controlling for state self-esteem. Study 2 found that participants reported higher state self-esteem, a marginally higher proportion of recreation/exploration, goals and a marginally lower proportion of achievement goals <b>after</b> <b>recalling</b> a positive memory than <b>after</b> <b>recalling</b> a negative one. They also reported a higher proportion of self-cognitions referring to emotional states <b>after</b> <b>recalling</b> memories from which they had not abstracted meaning than <b>after</b> <b>recalling</b> memories from which they had done this. These findings suggest that the retrieval of vivid, emotional and highly self-relevant memories may be accompanied by the activation of specific self-representations or working selves.

50|$|He {{returned}} to Stevenage {{at the end}} of his loan agreement at Aldershot, and made one appearance as a second-half substitute in a home game against Leyton Orient on 2 February 2013. However, just two weeks later, López was again loaned out, this time joining League Two side Barnet on a one-month loan deal. He made his debut when he started Barnet's home game against Rochdale on 23 February, playing the whole match in a 0-0 draw. Three days later, he got the final touch on a shot from Edgar Davids against Southend United that resulted in a goal, although the goal was ultimately awarded to Davids. López scored a second-half hat-trick in Barnet's 4-1 home victory over Morecambe on 9 March 2013. He scored three times in five games during the brief loan spell, before being recalled by his parent club on 13 March, due to Stevenage suffering from a host of injuries and suspensions. Just three <b>days</b> <b>after</b> being <b>recalled,</b> on 16 March, he scored a hat-trick, his second within the space of a week, as Stevenage secured a 4-0 home victory over Sheffield United. The game was also Lopez's first start for the club. He made ten appearances for Stevenage during the season, scoring three goals, although his season ended prematurely after receiving a red card following an altercation with Alan McCormack of Swindon Town on 20 April 2013. In the 2013-14 season, he made four appearances for Stevenage between August and October, three as substitute, before joining Barnet on loan again on 10 October. His first and second goals on his return to the Bees came in a 3-0 FA Cup qualifying win over Concord Rangers on 26 October. He joined the Bees on loan again on 23 January until the end of the 2013-14 season. The loan spell was cut short on 16 April due to injury. Across his two loan spells at Barnet in 2013-14, he scored four goals in 16 games in all competitions. On 17 May 2014, López was released by Stevenage.|$|R
40|$|Although {{immunization}} with {{tetanus toxoid}} cannot {{be expected to}} produce an adequate permanent immunity, a number of investigators have confirmed and extended the observation of Ramon 3 {{to the effect that}} an organism, once immunized, will respond to further injections of toxoid with an accelerated and increased antitoxin production. That this response to the "injection de rappel " does occur has been adequately and clearly demonstrated, but it has not been entirely proved that this recall response takes place rapidly enough to provide effective protection against infection with tetanus. It was the purpose of this investigation to add to the available information on this point. Materials and methods The subjects of this investigation were 42 students of Yale University, all in general good health, who had been immunized against tetanus, either because they had a definite history of serum sickness or were known to be allergic to other substances, and hence, presumably, to horse serum. The age range was from 18 to 21 years. These subjects had received two 1 cc. doses of commercial tetanus toxoid, alum precipitated (APT). The interval between the two doses averaged 63 + 8 days. The recall injection was given after 283 i 28 days. The variation in this interval {{is due to the fact}} that primary immunization was done routinely rather than experimentally, and hence occurred through the year. The procedure in these tests was essentially as follows: After a 10 cc. specimen of blood was removed for titration of residual antitoxin, the subject was given a recall dose of 1 cc. APT intramuscularly. Blood samples for antitoxin titration were again taken on the 5 th and 10 th <b>days</b> <b>after</b> the <b>recall</b> injection. A 5 -day interval was selected because Cowles' has shown that most subjects then have their first significant rise in antitoxin.

5000|$|On 6 December 2008, as a precautionary measure, the Food Safety Authority {{initiated}} a product recall of all Irish pork and bacon products {{which had been}} produced since 1 September 2008. This {{was due to the}} presence of dioxin in a small sample of Irish pork and bacon products which was confirmed on Saturday, 6 December. The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (DAFF) identified the source of the contaminant as one animal feed plant which had supplied 10 Irish pig farms which, in turn, account for 8 per cent of the total supply of pigs in Ireland. Restrictions were immediately placed on these farms to prohibit their animals from entering the food chain. According to the Chief Medical Officer in the Department of Health and Children, [...] "Any risk that arises to health from having consumed Irish pork products prior to the product recall is extremely low and the public should not be concerned" [...] This was a view endorsed by the European Food Safety Authority, and the UK Food Safety Authority.Irish pork and bacon products returned to the shelves four <b>days</b> <b>after</b> the <b>recall,</b> with a new label authorised by DAFF confirming the products were free from any contaminant.The pork recall generated considerable publicity around the world and the actions of the FSAI in instigating a complete recall, in spite of the financial implications to the sector, were widely praised. According to one BBC commentator [...] "the episode has shown the Irish food industry is really about food safety even where it demands painful disclosure and economic loss."The impact on the sales of Irish pork and bacon products in the key UK market in 2009 were subsequently described as [...] "slight and temporary" [...] with trade figures up to August 2009 showing a year-on-year rise of 9 per cent.Imports countries worldwide quickly returned to sourcing Irish pork, with all but China to lift their suspension, with progress expected there by mid-2010.|$|R
