40|$|Fading {{is nothing}} but the {{degradation}} in signal strength and occurs mainly due to reflectionsfrom a stratified atmosphere or from surface land along the path. Such fading also causes multipath effectswhich result in constructive or destructive interference {{in the level of}} the incoming signal. Multipath fadingvaries with path length, frequency, climate and terrain. In dry, windy, mountainous areas, the multiple pathphenomenon is virtually non-existent. Flat terrain along a path tends to increase the <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>fading.</b> Fading is prominent in hot, humid coastal regions. In this paper Rayleigh Multipath fading channels isconsidered and the performance analysis of it is done using Rectangular QAM schemes like 16 QAM, 64 QAM and 128 QAM using the Simulink tool...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we review the most {{peculiar}} and interesting information-theoretic and communications features <b>of</b> <b>fading</b> channels. We first describe the statistical models <b>of</b> <b>fading</b> channels which are frequently {{used in the}} analysis and design of communication systems. Next, {{we focus on the}} information theory <b>of</b> <b>fading</b> channels, by emphasizing capacity as the most important performance measure. Both single-user and multiuser transmission are examined. Further, we describe how the structure <b>of</b> <b>fading</b> channels impacts code design, and finally overview equalization <b>of</b> <b>fading</b> multipath channels.

The behaviour effects robustness of communication system {{and needs to}} be considered in system design as it influences the required link budget fade margin. This paper introduces a new simplified model <b>of</b> <b>fade</b> depth scaling as a function of bandwidth. It is based on higher number of measurements compared to preceding works. As a result, thorough exploration <b>of</b> <b>fade</b> depth dependency on frequency and distance has been conducted. The results provide more insight into the issue <b>of</b> <b>fade</b> depth scaling, which can be used in the design of wideband wireless communication systems. © 2010 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|Diversity is a {{well-known}} means to counter the detrimental effect <b>of</b> <b>fading.</b> Against this background, space-time codes {{have been designed to}} facilitate transmit diversity with a suitable receiver. Furthermore, space-time codes combined with OFDM allow for the utilization of frequency selective channels. However, a general assumption underlying the design of space-time codes is the time-invariance of the channel, which is violated in a high mobility environment. Large Doppler spread causing rapidly time-varying channels can be compensated at the receiver by sectorized antennas, which restrict the angle <b>of</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> imping waves to a finite range. Compared to an omnidirectional antenna, the resulting Doppler spread of a sector antenna and the channel’s time-variance are reduced. In this paper, we demonstrate the benefits of Doppler compensating sectorized antennas for space-time coded OFDM. 1...|$|R

40|$|In free-space optical {{communication}} links, atmospheric turbulence causes fluctuations {{in both the}} intensity and the phase of received light signal, impairing link performance. In this paper, we describe several communication techniques to mitigate turbulence-induced intensity fluctuations, that is signal fading.
