25|$|Once all the {{preparations}} are made, battle begins. Turn order is decided by a countdown based on agility, last move used and formation. A player character may select from {{as many as}} eight different skills: one normal skill for each item, and, if they are well trained with that item and the OverDrive Gauge is sufficiently filled, a secondary, more interesting OverSkill. Using a skill, however, reduces <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>more</b> times that item can be used, as Riviera employs a Fire Emblem-styled system of item endurance allowing the item to be used only a certain amount of times before it breaks entirely. The OverDrive Gauge fills throughout battle, as characters receive and deal damage, and with certain skills. At various levels, characters can use different skills, because certain skills require more of the gauge be filled. There are five levels of skills for player characters: Level 0 skills that may be used whenever and without training; Levels 1 through 3 skills, which require training and deplete that amount of the OverDrive Gauge; and Execution Level skills that may be used at any level of OverDrive Gauge fullness, but will shatter the gauge for the battle, and are only obtained through the story. Enemies have a similar gauge with three levels: Normal, Rage and Max. At Normal they may only use normal attacks. At Rage they may use Rage and Normal attacks, but the latter depletes the gauge. At Max, they may use all three, but only Max skills will deplete the gauge, and will deplete it fully. Enemies also have Etc. attacks, ranging from healing to transformation, that may be used at any time.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{develop a}} {{theoretical}} framework to characterize the hardness of indexing data sets on block-access memory devices like hard disks.

We identify two measures of efficiency for an indexing scheme on a workload: storage redundancy, r (<b>how</b> <b>many</b> times each item in the data set is stored), and access overhead, A (<b>how</b> <b>many</b> times <b>more</b> blocks than necessary does a query retrieve) ...|$|R

[...] To Bathurst, however, [...] "it is tempting to see Stroma's abandonment as the result of some appalling trauma. Abandonment is always taken as a sign of failure, a collective death... But Stroma does not feel sad. True, there is sorrow in seeing the once meticulous vegetable patches turned over to weeds, or wondering <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>more</b> winters the box beds will stand before they start to rot.
