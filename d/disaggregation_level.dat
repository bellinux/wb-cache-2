40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to assess {{inflation}} forecasting acurracy over the short-term horizon using Consumer Price Index (CPI) disaggregated data. That is, aggregating forecasts is compared with aggregate forecasting. In particular, three questions are addressed: i) one should bottom-up or not, ii) how bottom one should go and iii) how one should model at the bottom. In contrast with the literature, di erent levels of data dis-aggregation are allowed, namely a higher <b>disaggregation</b> <b>level</b> than the one considered up to now. Moreover, both univariate and multivariate models are considered, such as SARIMA and SARIMAX models with dynamic common factors. An out-of-sample forecast comparison (up to twelve months ahead) is done using Portuguese CPI dataset. Aggregating the forecasts seems to be better than aggregate forecasting up to a five-months ahead horizon. Moreover, this improvement increases with the <b>disaggregation</b> <b>level</b> and the multivariate modelling outperforms the univariate one in the very short-run. ...|$|E

40|$|CGEMs {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{potentially}} powerful tools for simulating policies. However, a major restriction they face is them needing a huge number of parameters that are not always available, and even at times impossible to obtain. When CGEMs are applied to trade, Armington elasticities of substitution are one of those key sets. The common practice among CGEMs builders has been to impose these values, either at will or by using those stemming from other existing research. There is general consensus, however, that econometrically estimated parameters for each case study would substantially improve the robustness of results. Unfortunately, most of the so obtained elasticities are considered underestimates of both the real and theoretically expected parameters. This gave rise to a growing concern on the eventual role played by methodological and empirical issues in this matter. There are some findings that have generated a quite general consensus among researchers, related to the type of datasets used; the <b>disaggregation</b> <b>levels</b> at which goods are defined and the origins of imported varieties are considered; the frequency of data; among others. ...|$|R

By analyzing each end-use, this paper enables a more precise understanding of the impact of these factors. The activity effect was the main determinant of the increase in energy consumption for all end-uses except for air conditioning, for which the equipment rate effect was the main factor. Structural changes in the service sector primarily impacted energy consumption for space heating and cooking. Improvements in productivity limited the growth of energy consumption for all end-uses except for cooking. Finally, energy efficiency improvements mainly affected space-heating energy use.

Most of the studies on this issue have tested the convergence separately between countries, regions and industries and have reached different conclusions. For example, some studies found {{a greater degree of}} convergence at the aggregate (country) level than at the disaggregate (regions and industry) level, while others have found the opposite. For instance, Sondermann (2014) found no convergence at the aggregate level but did find strong evidence of convergence at the disaggregate level for some sectors. Conversely, Bernard and Jones (1996) found convergence at the aggregate level but not at the disaggregate. Furthermore, the results of productivity convergence at different <b>disaggregation</b> <b>levels</b> of sectors and NUTS (Nomenclature of Units for Territorial Statistics) also differ from one study to another. 4 The speed of convergence could also be different because of heterogeneity in labour productivity at different levels of aggregation. For example, in the case of EU economies, regions are more integrated than countries and industries. Therefore, one can expect to find a different speed of convergence across countries, regions and industries. Since there are a much larger number of regional borders than a number of national borders in EU economies, this might be the reason for having different speeds of convergence across different levels. Therefore, the current study will extend the analysis of productivity convergence at all three levels: countries, regions and industry simultaneously.|$|R
40|$|A dynamic energy-economic CGE {{model is}} used to analyse how {{sensitive}} simulation results are to alternative values assumed by several types of elasticity of substitution. Substitutability in the energy mix is analysed by {{taking into account the}} nest structure of the CGE model in the energy module.

The simulation exercise reveals that the model produces highly differentiated results when different sets of elasticity parameters are adopted. A reduction in the flexibility of energy substitution possibilities makes abatement efforts more expensive at the general level. Moreover, this restriction generates changes in the distribution of costs associated with abatement efforts across regions.

40|$|We {{previously}} {{developed a}} spatially explicit, individual-based model (IBM) evaluating the bio-economic efficiency of fishing vessel movements between regions {{according to the}} catching and targeting of different species based on the most recent high resolution spatial fishery data. The main purpose was to test the effects of alternative fishing effort allocation scenarios related to fuel consumption, energy efficiency (value per litre of fuel), sustainable fish stock harvesting, and profitability of the fisheries. The assumption here was constant underlying resource availability. Now, an advanced version couples the vessel model to selected size-based population models and considers the underlying resource dynamics in the distribution and density patterns of the targeted stocks for the cases of Danish and German vessels harvesting the North Sea and Baltic fish stocks. The stochastic fishing process includes direct and local depletion by stock that is specific to the vessel catching power, which {{is proportional to the}} encountered size-based population on the visited ground and is based on stock assessment and research survey data. The impact of the potential fishing effort displacement by vessels on the fish stocks, with resulting fishing mortality, and the vessels’ economic consequences are evaluated on high spatial and seasonal <b>disaggregation</b> <b>levels</b> by simulating different individual choices of vessel speed, fishing grounds and ports. All tested scenarios led to increased overall energy efficiency, except for the fishing closures that increased fuel consumption and costs for most of the vessels due to increased travel distance. On an individual scale, the simulations led to gains and losses due to either the technical interactions between vessels exploiting the same stocks or to the alteration of individual fishing patterns. We demonstrate that integrating the spatial activity of vessels and local fish stock abundance dynamics allow for interactions and more realistic predictions of fishermen behaviour, revenues and stock abundance...|$|R

Recent studies have been increasingly focusing on subnational scales, often relying on domestic freight data. In this perspective, this article analyses the uncertainties of the French domestic road freight survey, road being by far the most common mode of transport in the country. Based on a statistical analysis of the survey, we propose a model to estimate the uncertainty of any given domestic road transport flow. We also assess uncertainty reduction when averaging the flows over several years, and obtain for instance a 30 % reduction for a 3 -year average. We then study the impact of the uncertainties on regional material flow studies such as the Economy-Wide Material Flow Analysis of the Bourgogne region. Overall the case studies advocate for a systematic assessment of freight uncertainties, as neither the <b>disaggregation</b> <b>level</b> nor the quantities traded are good enough predictors.

Using the non-accelerated filer (smaller public company) setting, where nonprofessional investors are likely to consume unaudited internal control reports in their investing judgments and decisions, I examine two facets of internal control disclosure formats: presentation salience and disaggregation of material weaknesses. A 2 x 2 between-participants behavioral experiment was conducted with internal control presentation salience (bulleted vs. in-text) and <b>disaggregation</b> <b>level</b> (a single material weakness vs. a combination of multiple control deficiencies that is a material weakness). I find that nonprofessional investors reward companies that disclose internal control weaknesses more saliently. The results also indicate that disaggregation interacts with salience in that it increases the effect of salience on investing judgments such that salient (stealth) disclosure of a combination of control deficiencies is viewed more positively (negatively) than salient (stealth) disclosure of a material weakness. These findings are contrary to Rennekamp (2012) who finds that processing fluency in bad news leads to more negative investment judgements. Additional analyses indicated that the results related to management trust and credibility are consistent with prior literature.
