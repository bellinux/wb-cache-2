5|$|A URN is a URI that {{identifies}} a resource by {{name in a}} particular namespace. A URN {{may be used to}} talk about a resource without implying its location or how to access it. For example, in the International Standard Book Number (ISBN) system, ISBN 0-486-27557-4 identifies a specific edition of Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet. The URN for that edition would be urn:isbn:0-486-27557-4. To <b>gain</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> book, its location is needed, for which a URL would have to be specified.|$|E

Perhaps the capture of Lissus rekindled in Philip hopes of an Italian invasion. However the loss of his fleet meant that Philip would be dependent on Carthage for passage to and from Italy, making the prospect of invasion considerably less appealing.|$|E

5|$|Almost {{nothing is}} {{recorded}} {{of the first}} twenty years of Egbert's reign, apart from campaigns against the Cornish in the 810s. The historian Richard Abels argues that {{the silence of the}} Anglo-Saxon Chronicle was probably intentional, concealing Egbert's purge of Beorhtric's magnates and suppression of rival royal lines. Relations between Mercian kings and their Kentish subjects were distant. Kentish ealdormen did not attend the court of King Coenwulf, who quarrelled with Archbishop Wulfred of Canterbury (805–832) over the control of Kentish monasteries; Coenwulf's primary concern seems to have been to <b>gain</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wealth of Kent. His successors Ceolwulf I (821–23) and Beornwulf (823–26) restored relations with Archbishop Wulfred, and Beornwulf appointed a sub-king of Kent, Baldred.|$|E

It is typically used to plug a Macbook into an office setting (printer, monitor, keyboard) or to provide additional ports not available in the Macbook Air. A review in The Register said it was compact and useful, but Windows users should consider a USB 3.0 dock. The Register and CNET disagreed on whether it was competitively priced. Reviews in TechRadar and Macworld gave it 4 out of 5 stars.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Skinner {{visits the}} Lone Gunmen, who are {{monitoring}} UFO {{activity in the}} United States {{in the hopes of}} tracking down Mulder.

Meanwhile, Doggett has gathered enough evidence to track Mulder's whereabouts before his so-called abduction, discovering that Mulder was dying and had his name engraved in his family's gravestone to mark his death in 2000. Later on, more evidence of high UFO activity in Clifton, Arizona is found by The Lone Gunmen. Concurrently, Doggett receives information about Gibson Praise (Jeff Gulka) when someone slips his file under his door.|$|E

Since 2006 the Bolivian government have nationalized oil and gas projects and is keeping a tight control over mining its lithium reserves. Already the Japanese and South Korean governments, as well as companies from these two countries and France, have offered technical assistance to develop Bolivia's lithium reserves and are seeking to <b>gain</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lithium resources through a mining and industrialization model suitable to Bolivian interests.|$|E
5|$|Synthetic diamond {{is already}} used as {{radiation}} detection device. It is radiation hard {{and has a}} wide bandgap of 5.5 eV (at room temperature). Diamond is also distinguished from most other semiconductors {{by the lack of}} a stable native oxide. This makes it difficult to fabricate surface MOS devices, but it does create the potential for UV radiation to <b>gain</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> active semiconductor without absorption in a surface layer. Because of these properties, it is employed in applications such as the BaBar detector at the Stanford Linear Accelerator and BOLD (Blind to the Optical Light Detectors for VUV solar observations). A diamond VUV detector recently was used in the European LYRA program.|$|E

The gates of Drypeak are found unmanned, much to Shanti's disgust, the Agent and her charge are also attacked by rogue Shaper creations.

He also states that Barzahl has died. Zakary and the population of Drypeak behave suspiciously. Shanti is shadowed by an armed guard against her will. She instructs the apprentice, who is not guarded, to explore Drypeak and beyond in order to discover the truth behind the colony and Barzahl's disappearance.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the game}} was never completed, {{only a small portion}} of the {{intended}} gameplay exists. During the playable segment, Mustafa, through conversations with other detainees, discovers that another detainee is planning an escape but needs a pair of pliers to make the attempt. Mustafa must join a work detail to <b>gain</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pliers, hide the pliers in a garbage can to prevent them from being found during a search, recover them at night (which requires Mustafa to find a way to pry open the area that the garbage cans are stored in), and deliver them to the other detainee. The playable section ends when Mustafa delivers the pliers. Other interactions during the playable section include speaking with a detainee who, after complaining that a guard threw her copy of the Quran to the ground, mentions the existence of a partially built tunnel from a previous escape attempt.|$|E
