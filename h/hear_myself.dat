500|$|Leeds midfielder Albert Johanneson {{would become}} the first black player to play in an FA Cup final. However, before walking out onto the pitch Johanneson {{suffered}} racial abuse: “When we walked out, all I could hear was a cacophony of Zulu-like noises coming from the terraces. It was dreadful, I could barely <b>hear</b> <b>myself</b> think for those screams. I wanted to run back down the tunnel." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Lee, {{the album}} was fun {{but not in a}} [...] "poppy way" [...] and the band enjoyed its recording. She was {{inspired}} by her relationship with Evanescence's fans: [...] "I can really <b>hear</b> <b>myself</b> singing about my relationship with Evanescence and with the fans. There's always one big relationship on a record that I sing about the most. I feel like my big relationship on this album [...] with Evanescence itself, and with the fans. I think lyrically you're hearing a lot about a relationship, a struggle with a relationship or love in a relationship, and mostly I'm singing about that." ...|$|E
500|$|Eric B. and Rakim met in 1985 after Eric B. {{looked for}} a rapper to {{complement}} his turntable work at the New York City radio station WBLS. After Rakim responded to Eric B.'s search for [...] "New York's top MC", Eric B's friend and roommate Marley Marl allowed him to use his home studio. The first track they recorded, [...] "Eric B. Is President", was released as a single on the independent Zakia Records in 1986. After Def Jam Recordings founder Russell Simmons heard the single, the duo were signed to Island Records and began recording the album in Manhattan's Power Play Studios in early 1987. Rakim wrote his songs in approximately one hour while listening to the beat. He then recorded his vocals in the booth by reading his lyrics from a paper. In 2006, Rakim revealed, [...] "When I hear my first album today I <b>hear</b> <b>myself</b> reading my rhymes but I'm my worst critic." [...] The duo completed the album in one week. They {{have said that they}} worked in 48-hour shifts and recorded in single takes in order complete the album within budget. In a 2008 interview with AllHipHop, Eric B. stated, [...] "o sit here and say we put together this calculated album to be a great album would be a lie. We were just doing records that felt good." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] I said, {{with a deep}} breath, [...] "if those I don't {{care for}} call me so behind my back, let me at least have the {{pleasure}} of <b>hearing</b> <b>myself</b> called so by those I love, like you, Elsie." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Honestly speaking," [...] M. de Bellegarde went on, [...] "there is {{something}} absurd {{to me in}} <b>hearing</b> <b>myself</b> make you these offers. They represent {{a great deal of}} goodwill, but they represent little else. You are a successful man and I am a failure, and it's a turning of the tables to talk as if I could lend you a hand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{that is his}} loss, not mine," [...] {{answered}} the Rocket. [...] "I {{am not going to}} stop talking to him merely because he pays no attention. I like <b>hearing</b> <b>myself</b> talk. It is one of my greatest pleasures. I often have long conversations all by myself, and I am so clever that sometimes I don't understand a single word of what I am saying." ...|$|R
500|$|A Perfect Circle was {{originally}} conceived by Billy Howerdel, a former guitar technician for Nine Inch Nails, The Smashing Pumpkins, Fishbone and Tool. Howerdel met singer Maynard James Keenan in 1992, when Tool was opening for Fishbone, {{and the two}} became friends. Three years later, Keenan offered Howerdel, who was looking for lodging, a room in his North Hollywood home. This provided Howerdel {{the opportunity to play}} demos of his music for Keenan. Pleased with what he heard, Keenan remarked, [...] "I can <b>hear</b> <b>myself</b> singing [...]" [...] Although he originally desired a female vocalist, Howerdel agreed that Keenan would be a good fit, and A Perfect Circle was formed a short time later. The two rounded out the band's initial lineup with bassist and violinist Paz Lenchantin, former Failure guitarist Troy Van Leeuwen, and Primus drummer Tim Alexander. The band played their first show at LA's Viper Club Reception in August 1999, followed by a larger-scale, more widely publicized show at the Coachella Festival the following October. While initially in talks to release the album on Volcano Records - Tool's record label - Keenan stated that they instead chose to go with Virgin Records, who Keenan felt better understood that Keenan meant for the band to be an equally important band to Tool, not a minor side project. After the initial shows and securing a record deal, the band entered the studio to begin work on their first album. Alexander was soon replaced with Josh Freese, who previously worked with Howerdel on the Guns N' Roses album Chinese Democracy, with Alexander's only studio contribution being drums on the album version of the song [...] "The Hollow".|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the {{relationship}} between Francesa and Russo, Francesa said, [...] "It was an arranged marriage and almost a quickie divorce." [...] Russo admitted that such a proposition of breaking up between the two would have been celebrated in 1992. [...] However, Russo said in an interview, [...] "I think that, in the long term, the station sees us as a tandem and {{would not want to}} break the brand up... And to tell you the truth, after almost 20 years together, Mike and I are like a married couple: It would be too hard to leave him. I never thought I would <b>hear</b> <b>myself</b> say this, but it would feel very strange to be on the air without him." ...|$|E
2500|$|During August 2010, Blasko {{recorded}} an album, Seeker Lover Keeper, in New York for {{the group}} {{of the same name}} with fellow founding members and Australian singer-songwriters, Sally Seltmann and Holly Throsby. The group's debut album peaked at No.3 on the ARIA Albums Charts in June 2011, Blasko's highest chart entry. The trio embarked on a national tour to promote the album in June and July that year. Of the album's 12 tracks each of the artists had an equal share of four tracks, however Blasko takes lead vocal on five tracks including [...] "Rely on Me" [...] written by Throsby, Blasko described [...] "I was reluctant to do it but the girls kept asking me. I couldn't <b>hear</b> <b>myself</b> singing that one until Holly made me do it. I enjoyed it because the song has real generosity to it". Greenberg felt Blasko's lead vocals were on the [...] "most memorable tracks, using her signature form of lilting power". By year's end all three artists had returned to their respective solo careers.|$|E
5000|$|... “I never {{imagined}} that I {{would make it}} this big. My dream was only simple. To be heard on radio in our province. I never wanted anything else because <b>hearing</b> <b>myself</b> talk on air was enough for me. When I finally did, I used to record my own audio clip and listen to it at home. To become a famous broadcaster was farthest from my mind. I never planned it.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Alex {{considers}} {{whether or}} not he and Bree will have children, inspired by Bree holding Guidice's biological second daughter. The novel ends with Alex asking his therapist Adele Finaly if he will ever outgrow or solve his problem in life, that he is a cop which endangers his, his friends', and his family's lives. She asks Cross what he thinks he should do. [...] "Keep showing up here until I'm so sick of <b>hearing</b> <b>myself</b> talk that I finally make a change." [...] Adele says that eventually he may solve that problem.|$|R
6000|$|At twenty-five {{past six}} I {{turned on the}} hot water in the bath, and covertly {{swallowed}} a small glass of brandy. I then said, [...] "Half-past six; time for little boys to be in bed." [...] I said it in the matter-of-fact voice of one made free of the company of parents, as if I had said it often before, {{and would have to}} say it often again, and as if there was nothing particularly delicious to me in <b>hearing</b> <b>myself</b> say it. I tried to say it in that way.|$|R
2500|$|The {{band played}} only two gigs in 1995. This allowed Duritz {{to write a}} set of songs that became the band's second album, Recovering the Satellites. [...] Released October 15, 1996, it was heavier than August and Everything After, perhaps due to the {{addition}} of second guitarist Dan Vickrey, who had joined in early 1994. A response to the sudden fame that [...] "Mr. Jones" [...] had brought, it contains lyrics such as [...] "These days I feel like I'm fading away / Like sometimes when I <b>hear</b> <b>myself</b> on the radio" [...] (from [...] "Have You Seen Me Lately?") and [...] "Gonna get back to basics / Guess I'll start it up again" [...] (from [...] "Recovering the Satellites"). Dealing with the theme of Duritz's unease with his newfound fame, the album was described as [...] "a concept album of sorts about {{trying to pick up}} the pieces of a family, a social life and a psyche shattered by fame." [...] This album contained the hit single [...] "A Long December" [...] which received medium to heavy FM airplay.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{legacies}} {{include the}} parents' beliefs in Freemasonry, Republicanism with elements of Anarchism and Marxism. Austere freethinkers with an intense {{hatred of the}} ruling National Fascist Party, Eva and Mario also refused to give their sons any education in the Catholic Faith or any other religion. Italo attended the English nursery school St George's College, followed by a Protestant elementary private school run by Waldensians. His secondary schooling, with a classical lyceum curriculum, was completed at the state-run Liceo Gian Domenico Cassini where, at his parents' request, he was exempted from religion classes but frequently asked to justify his anti-conformism to teachers, janitors, and fellow pupils. In his mature years, Calvino described the experience as having made him [...] "tolerant of others' opinions, particularly {{in the field of}} religion, remembering how irksome it was to <b>hear</b> <b>myself</b> mocked because I did not follow the majority's beliefs". In 1938, Eugenio Scalfari, who went on to found the weekly magazine L'Espresso and La Repubblica, a major Italian newspaper, came from Civitavecchia to join the same class though a year younger, and they shared the same desk. The two teenagers formed a lasting friendship, Calvino attributing his political awakening to their university discussions. Seated together [...] "on a huge flat stone {{in the middle of a}} stream near our land", he and Scalfari founded the MUL (University Liberal Movement).|$|E

5000|$|In 1995 Winger {{decided to}} take a hiatus from acting. In 2002 she said, [...] "I wanted out for years. I got sick of <b>hearing</b> <b>myself</b> say I wanted to quit. It's like opening an {{interview}} with 'I hate interviews!' Well, get out! I stopped reading scripts and stopped caring. People said, 'We miss you so much.' But in the last six years, tell me a film that I should have been in. The few I can think of, the actress was so perfect". After making Forget Paris in 1995 she was absent from the screen for six years before returning in 2001 with Big Bad Love, written and directed by her husband, Arliss Howard, and also marking Winger's debut as a producer.|$|R

After the song {{was recorded}} Becker and Fagen decided to add a saxophone solo and asked their producer, Gary Katz, to arrange for Pete Christlieb to record the solo. At the time, neither Becker nor Fagen knew Christlieb by name, only by his reputation as a musician on Johnny Carson's Tonight Show. Christlieb went to the studio and recorded the solo after taping the show one evening. [...] "They told me to play what I felt. Hey, I'm a jazz musician, that's what I do ... so I recorded my first solo ... we listened back and they said it was great. I recorded a second take and that's the one they used.
