40|$|This paper {{focused on}} a review of {{international}} experiences on <b>fuel</b> <b>economy</b> <b>standard</b> based on technologies available.

It is known that road transport, particularly private cars are responsible for large, and increasing share of transport fuel use and emissions. With the implementation of <b>fuel</b> <b>economy</b> <b>standard</b> and label for motor vehicles, it will reduce the risks of increasing dependency on petroleum-based fuel and will increase the profit to consumers. The GHG emissions, which causing global warming, air pollution, diseases, etc. can be reduced as well. In this regard, advanced technologies such as, engine, transmission, and vehicle technologies may brought significant consumers and social benefits.

40|$|Currently, the {{transportation}} sector alone consumes more than 40 % {{of the total}} energy consumption in Malaysia. Developed {{countries around the world}} have implemented a <b>fuel</b> <b>economy</b> <b>standard</b> for motor-vehicles. This paper attempts to predict the amount of fuel savings and the subsequent economic and environmental impact in {{the transportation}} sector by implementing a minimum <b>fuel</b> <b>economy</b> <b>standard</b> for personal vehicles in Malaysia. The calculations are based on the growth of vehicle ownership data in Malaysia. The ownership of private vehicles in Malaysia has rapidly risen from 2, 553, 574 in 1995 to 6, 941, 996 in 2006. By implementing the program in 2010 about 15 Gl of fuel can be saved {{by the end of the}} year 2018. This correlates to about RM 42 billion (1 US$ = RM 3. 5) in bill savings and 36 million tones of carbon dioxide reductions.

40|$|The US {{government}} criticized Japanese environmental policies, {{which promoted}} eco-friendly car (eco-car) purchases via {{measures such as}} tax exemptions and subsidies, as disguised forms of protection by arguing that the <b>fuel</b> <b>economy</b> <b>standard</b> for the subsidy qualification {{was designed to be}} more beneficial to domestic firms. This paper examines Japanese environmental policies from 2005 - 2009 to assess {{whether or not they were}} adequately formulated from an environmental perspective. The analysis compares the outcomes between the actual <b>fuel</b> <b>economy</b> <b>standard</b> for subsidy qualification introduced in Japan and an alternative standard suggested by the US government. Simulation results based on the structural econometric model of multi-product oligopolistic competition show that although both alternative and actual standards are comparable for the average <b>fuel</b> <b>economy</b> of new cars sold, the former is inefficient in improving the <b>fuel</b> <b>economy</b> because it requires much larger subsidies to achieve the same average <b>fuel</b> <b>economy</b> level as that of the latter...|$|R

25|$|In the US, {{transportation}} by car {{is guided}} {{more by the}} government than by an invisible hand. Roads and the interstate highway system were built by local, {{state and federal governments}} and paid for by income taxes, property taxes, fuel taxes, and tolls.

US <b>fuel</b> <b>economy</b> <b>standards</b> exist but are not high enough to have effect. There is also a gas guzzler tax of limited scope.

50|$|In 2009, Oge’s office, in {{conjunction}} with the National Highway Safety Administration and the State of California, began negotiating new vehicle emissions and <b>fuel</b> <b>economy</b> regulations with automakers.

California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, along with governors from 13 other states, stated that the EPA's actions ignored federal law, and that existing California standards (adopted by many states in addition to California) were almost twice {{as effective as the}} proposed federal standards.

40|$|Abstract: The U. S. Congress {{recently}} amended <b>fuel</b> <b>economy</b> {{regulations on}} new passenger vehicles. The new corporate average <b>fuel</b> <b>economy</b> (CAFE) <b>standard,</b> effective in model year 2011, establishes an individual <b>fuel</b> <b>economy</b> target for each vehicle, based on vehicle footprint such that manufacturers that produce larger vehicles can meet lower <b>fuel</b> <b>economy</b> <b>standard.</b> Using detailed model-level {{data on the}} vehicles produced since the new CAFE standard was adopted, this paper employs an empirically estimated medium-run model to study the equilibrium effects of the 2011 CAFE reform. I identify and model heterogeneity across firms based on their most recent compliance behavior under the new CAFE. After controlling for the overall fleet <b>fuel</b> <b>economy</b> performance, simulation {{results suggest that the}} profit impacts of the CAFE reform fall almost entirely on historically unconstrained firms. Furthermore, results suggest that the perverse incentive for firms to increase vehicle size is clearly present, though the extent is rather limited. Finally, accounting for the shifts in the composition of the vehicle fleet and more finely detailed compositional changes across vehicle classes, one can expect the CAFE reform to {{have a positive effect on}} accident safety...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} project applies a hybrid energy-economy model {{to compare the}} cost-effectiveness of different climate change mitigation policies for the United States. Five policies are compared: (1) a technology regulation phasing out coal and natural gas generation, (2) Clean Electricity Standard, (3) Corporate Average <b>Fuel</b> <b>Economy</b> <b>Standard,</b> (4) Vehicles Emissions Standard, (5) economy-wide GHG tax. The cost of these policies is estimated using three different methodologies. The first methodology is the techno-economic cost (TEC) measure, representing a ‘bottom-up’ or engineering costing methodology. The second methodology is the perceived private cost (PPC) measure, representing the ‘top-down’ or economist costing methodology. The third methodology uses the previous two methods to make a “best estimate” of welfare costs, called the expected resource cost. Going by the expected resource cost measure, the study finds an economy-wide GHG tax is {{a quarter of the}} cost of two policy scenarios that implement tradable performance standards in the electricity and transportation sectors. For the electricity sector policies, the study finds that the clean electricity standard is 50 % less costly than a technology regulation phasing out conventional coal and natural gas generation. For the transportation policies, the study finds that the Vehicle Emissions Standard is 15 % less costly than the Corporate Average <b>Fuel</b> <b>Economy</b> <b>Standard...</b>|$|R
