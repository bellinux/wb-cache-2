25|$|In late April, the WHO {{announced}} a new $5.5 billion, 6-year cooperative plan (called the 2013–18 Polio Eradication and Endgame Strategic Plan) to eradicate polio from its last reservoirs. The plan called for mass immunization campaigns in the three remaining endemic countries, and also dictated a switch to <b>inactivated</b> <b>virus</b> injections, to avoid {{the risk of the}} vaccine-derived outbreaks that occasionally occur from use of the live-virus oral vaccine.|$|E
25|$|In 1955, in {{a tragedy}} {{known as the}} Cutter incident, Cutter Laboratories {{produced}} 120,000 doses of the Salk polio vaccine that inadvertently contained some live polio virus along with <b>inactivated</b> <b>virus.</b> This vaccine caused 40,000 cases of polio, 53 cases of paralysis, and five deaths. The disease spread through the recipients' families, creating a polio epidemic {{that led to a}} further 113 cases of paralytic polio and another five deaths. It {{was one of the worst}} pharmaceutical disasters in US history.|$|E

50|$|The {{vaccines}} {{are relatively}} safe. Pain and redness may {{occur at the}} site of injection. As of 2015, 15 different vaccines are available: some are based on recombinant DNA techniques, others weakened virus, and others <b>inactivated</b> <b>virus.</b>|$|E
50|$|While other 2009 H1N1 {{vaccines}} {{have been}} developed, {{the use of}} a proprietary immunologic adjuvant is claimed to boost the potency of the body’s immune response, meaning that only a quarter of the <b>inactivated</b> <b>virus</b> is needed.|$|E
50|$|TIV induces {{protection}} after injection (typically intramuscular, though subcutaneous and intradermal routes {{can also}} be protective) based on an immune response to the antigens present on the <b>inactivated</b> <b>virus,</b> while cold-adapted LAIV works by establishing infection in the nasal passages.|$|E
40|$|Substances were {{evaluated}} for their relative potencies in <b>inactivating</b> Junin <b>virus,</b> Escherichia coli, and spores of Bacillus subtilis. Under {{the conditions of}} our test, glutaraldehyde was the most efficient agent among all substances currently recommended for disinfecting and sterilizing medical devices. Either copper or iron ions by themselves were able to <b>inactivate</b> <b>virus</b> with an efficiency {{similar to that of}} substances currently used for disinfection and sterilization. The microbicidal effect of metals, however, was enhanced further by the addition of peroxide. The mixtures of copper and peroxide described here were more efficient than glutaraldehyde in <b>inactivating</b> <b>viruses</b> and bacteria. The addition of a metal chelator to metal-peroxide mixtures further increased the microbicidal potency of the reagent. The formulations described in this study should be harmless to people but able to quickly and efficiently <b>inactivate</b> microorganisms, particularly <b>viruses...</b>|$|R

50|$|The first vaccine against TBE was {{prepared}} in 1937 in {{the brains of}} mice. Some 20 years later TBE vaccines derived from cell cultures (chicken embryo fibroblast cells) were developed and used for active immunization in humans in the former Soviet Union. Later, a purified, <b>inactivated</b> <b>virus</b> vaccine was developed which {{proved to be more}} immunogenic than previous TBE vaccines.|$|E
50|$|Severe {{side effects}} are very rare. Pain {{at the site}} of {{injection}} occurs in about 15% of children and half of adults. Most hepatitis A vaccines contain <b>inactivated</b> <b>virus</b> while a few contain weakened virus. The ones with weakened virus are not recommended during pregnancy or in those with poor immune function. A few formulations combine hepatitis A with either hepatitis B or typhoid vaccine.|$|E
50|$|A {{solution}} of glutaraldehyde, typically of 10% w/w, is sold under various trade names to remove common and plantar warts.

50|$|Although {{it poses}} a hurdle by <b>inactivating</b> <b>viruses,</b> the patient's immune system can also {{act as an}} ally against tumors; {{infection}} attracts {{the attention of the}} immune system to the tumour and may help to generate useful and long-lasting antitumor immunity. This essentially produces a personalised Cancer vaccine.|$|R

40|$|Intranasal {{immunization}} with <b>inactivated</b> influenza <b>virus</b> vaccine {{can provide}} protective immunity, whereas many other antigens are less effective when used for mucosal immunization. To determine whether influenza virus could enhance immune responses to an antigen coadministered to a mucosal surface, we studied the intranasal immunization of mice {{with a mixture}} of simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) virus-like particles (VLPs) and <b>inactivated</b> influenza <b>virus.</b> Compared to mice immunized with SHIV VLPs alone, mice coimmunized with SHIV VLPs and <b>inactivated</b> influenza <b>virus</b> showed significant increases in serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) and mucosal IgA antibodies specific to the human immunodeficiency virus envelope protein, neutralizing activities, numbers of gamma interferon- and interleukin 4 -secreting lymphocytes, and cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte activities. The levels of enhancement of immune response by coimmunization with <b>inactivated</b> influenza <b>virus</b> were equivalent to those induced by inclusion of immunostimulatory CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG DNA). We also observed that SHIV VLPs bind to influenza virus virions, forming mixed aggregates. These results indicate that <b>inactivated</b> influenza <b>virus</b> can play a role as a mucosal adjuvant to coadministered antigens...|$|R

50|$|The second <b>inactivated</b> <b>virus</b> vaccine was {{developed}} in 1952 by Jonas Salk at the University of Pittsburgh, and announced to the world on 12 April 1955. The Salk vaccine, or inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV), is based on poliovirus grown in a type of monkey kidney tissue culture (vero cell line), which is chemically inactivated with formalin. After two doses of IPV (given by injection), 90 {{percent or more of}} individuals develop protective antibody to all three serotypes of poliovirus, and at least 99 percent are immune to poliovirus following three doses.|$|E
5000|$|MedImmune is {{one company}} that {{manufactures}} LAIV, which it sells under the trade name [...] "FluMist" [...] in the United States and [...] "Fluenz" [...] in Europe. For the 2010-2011 flu season, FluMist {{was the only}} LAIV approved by the FDA {{for use in the}} USA. All other FDA-approved lots were <b>inactivated</b> <b>virus</b> vaccines. In September 2009 a LAIV intranasal vaccine for the novel H1N1 influenza virus was approved and the seasonal intranasal vaccine was approved by the European Medicines Agency for use in the European Union in 2011, though distribution would not likely begin until 2012.|$|E
50|$|Even {{though the}} virus in LAIV is {{attenuated}} (low in virulence), {{it is still a}} living virus, and may cause an infection with complications in people with weakened immune systems or other underlying medical conditions. As of 2010, LAIV is recommended only for people 2-49 years of age, and is not recommended for people who have a weakened immune system, for pregnant women, or for people with certain chronic diseases. In contrast, <b>inactivated</b> <b>virus</b> vaccines contain no living virus, and cannot cause a live infection. Persons receiving LAIV may shed small amounts of the vaccine virus during the first week. People coming in contact with the vaccinated person are not considered to be at risk, unless their immune systems are severely weakened (for example, bone marrow transplant recipients).|$|E

40|$|Abstract High {{pressure}} processing (HPP) is an increas-ingly popular non-thermal {{food processing}} technology. Study of HPP’s potential to <b>inactivate</b> foodborne <b>viruses</b> has defined general pressure levels required to <b>inactivate</b> hepa-titis A <b>virus,</b> norovirus surrogates, and human norovirus itself within {{foods such as}} shellfish and produce. The sen-sitivity {{of a number of}} different picornaviruses to HPP is variable. Experiments suggest that HPP <b>inactivates</b> <b>viruses</b> via denaturation of capsid proteins which render the virus incapable of binding to its receptor on the surface of its host cell. Beyond the primary consideration of treatment pressure level, the effects of extending treatment times, temperature of initial pressure application, and matrix composition have been identified as critical parameters for designing HPP inactivation strategies. Research described here can serve as a preliminary guide to whether a current commercial process could be effective against HuNoV or HAV...|$|R
50|$|Regarding cell therapy, Advanced Cell Technology, {{now called}} Ocata Therapeutics, has {{completed}} Phase I/II multicenter clinical trial using retinal cells derived from {{human embryonic stem}} cells (hESCs) to treat patients with Stargardt. After treating and collecting data on 18 patients, Advanced Cell was given approval to test its stem cell therapy on patients with 20/100 vision. In October 2014, {{the results of the}} Phase I/II clinical trial were published in the Lancet.Gene therapy trials are also on-going. During gene therapy, a working copy of the ABCA4 gene is incorporated in a lentivirus (an <b>inactivated</b> <b>virus</b> derived from HIV which transports the working copy of the gene) and injected into the eye through a subretinal injection. It is hoped that such injection, if performed early enough, could prevent the progression of the disease.|$|E
5000|$|EHV-4 is {{an upper}} {{respiratory}} disease {{restricted to the}} infection of the respiratory tract epithelium and its associated lymph nodes. EHV 4 and its close relative EHV 1 are clinically and pathologically indistinguishable and are the primary pathogens that causing respiratory tract disease in young horses from weanling to 2 years of age. Incubation period of Equine Herpiesvirus is 2-10 days. Symptoms include fever (38.9-41.7 °C), loss of appetite, and a nasal discharge giving it the nickname [...] "snots". Without antibiotic treatment, {{the damage to the}} respiratory mucosal barrier predisposes infected horses to secondary infections and the involvement of the lower airways (ex. bronchiolitis or pneumonia); Increasing the duration, severity and the mortality of the disease. [...] EHV-4 rarely causes abortion in infected pregnant mares unlike its EHV-1 counterpart. [...] Although there is no specific treatment for the disease once a horse is infected, vaccination against EHV-1 and EHV-4 is recommended as part of preventative herd health for those at high risk of infection. Multiple vaccines are available (Duvaxyn EHV1,4, EquiGuard, EquiVac EHV-1/4, etc.), most in an <b>inactivated</b> <b>virus</b> form.|$|E
50|$|For the inactivated vaccines, {{the virus}} is grown by injecting it, along with some antibiotics, into fertilized chicken eggs. About one to two eggs are needed to make each dose of vaccine. The virus {{replicates}} within the allantois of the embryo, which {{is the equivalent of}} the placenta in mammals. The fluid in this structure is removed and the virus purified from this fluid by methods such as filtration or centrifugation. The purified viruses are then inactivated ("killed") {{with a small amount of}} a disinfectant. The <b>inactivated</b> <b>virus</b> is treated with detergent to break up the virus into particles, and the broken capsule segments and released proteins are concentrated by centrifugation. The final preparation is suspended in sterile phosphate buffered saline ready for injection. This vaccine mainly contains the killed virus but might also contain tiny amounts of egg protein and the antibiotics, disinfectant and detergent used in the manufacturing process. In multi-dose versions of the vaccine, the preservative thimerosal is added to prevent growth of bacteria. In some versions of the vaccine used in Europe and Canada, such as Arepanrix and Fluad, an adjuvant is also added, this contains a fish oil called squalene, vitamin E and an emulsifier called polysorbate 80.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Interferon {{does not}} <b>inactivate</b> <b>viruses</b> or viral RNA. Virus growth is {{inhibited}} in interferon-treated cells, {{but apart from}} conferring resistance to virus growth, no other effect of interferon on cells has been definitely shown to take place. Interferon binds to cells even in the cold, but a period of incuba-tion at 370 C is required for development of antiviral activity. Cytoplasmic uptake of interferon has not been unequivocally demonstrated. Studies with antimetabolites indicate that the antiviral action of interferon requires host RNA and protein synthesis. Experiments with 2 -mercapto-l(f- 4 -pyridethyl) benzimidazole (MPB) suggest that an additional step is required between the binding and the synthesis of macromolecules. Interferon {{does not affect the}} adsorption, penetration, or uncoating of RNA or DNA viruses, but viral RNA synthesis is inhibited in cells infected with RNA viruses. The main action of interferon appears to be the inhibition of the translation of virus genetic informa-tion probably by inhibiting the initiation of virus protein synthesis. Interferon does not directly <b>inactivate</b> <b>virus</b> particles. It blocks an intracellula...|$|R
