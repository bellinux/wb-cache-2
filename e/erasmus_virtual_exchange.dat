Welch wrote an article for Huffington Post about his friend J. Christopher Stevens, a U.S. Ambassador who was killed in Benghazi, Libya, in September 2012. He wrote about Stevens’ humility and commitment to respectful dialogue and the potential of <b>virtual</b> <b>exchange</b> programs to build off of and extend that legacy. That article caught the attention of the family of Ambassador Stevens and they began working with the <b>Virtual</b> <b>Exchange</b> Coalition to scale up <b>Virtual</b> <b>Exchange</b> programs between youth in the US and the Middle East. That effort ultimately led to the establishment of the J. Christopher Stevens <b>Virtual</b> <b>Exchange</b> Initiative. That initiative is now managed by the Aspen Institute with support from public and private partners and was publicly announced by President Obama in 2015. It aims to connect 1 million young people from the US and the Middle East and North Africa by 2020 through <b>virtual</b> <b>exchange</b> programs.|$|R

This paper will describe a <b>virtual</b> <b>exchange</b> where over 800 students from Japan, Colombia and one class from Taiwan; used English to communicate asynchronously {{with each other}} over a nine week period. Participants exchanged information in English about their lives and cultures through text and video using discussion forums on Moodle. A survey of participants after {{the conclusion of the}} exchange revealed that participants found the exchange useful for practicing English and motivating for improving their English language skills. They also felt that they had learnt about the partner country and that their interest in the partner country had increased. The Moodle site used for the <b>Virtual</b> <b>Exchange</b> was found to be relatively easy to use and the exchange was not overly time consuming. This study also identifies some areas to improve future <b>exchanges,</b> while recommending <b>Virtual</b> <b>Exchange</b> as a real communication and language practice platform for students of foreign languages around the world...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Occupational {{therapy is}} practiced in 50 + {{countries}}, but many countries have few therapists and scarce resources for ongoing professional development. At the WFOT Congress in May 2010, {{the need to}} offer knowledge transfer (KT) opportunities to occupational therapists unable to attend such events was clear, and as Congress is only once every 4 years, even those able to attend wanted more frequent contact with international colleagues. Objectives: The OT 24 -Hour <b>Virtual</b> <b>Exchange</b> - a free 24 - hour online conference- was designed to address these 2 KT concerns. Approach: Six therapists from 4 countries met online 5 times over 4 months to organize the 1 st OT <b>Virtual</b> <b>Exchange</b> conference on Oct. 27, 2010 (World OT Day). Results: There were 24 + speakers from 8 countries and 1000 + attendees from 30 countries, which was framed as the “ 1 st OT conference you can attend in your pajamas”. Diverse topics included: virtual worlds, transition planning for adolescents, adapted hiking equipment, OT models, disaster response, social media use after brain injury, military OT and the therapeutic potential of dance. The Exchange was promoted with both traditional methods and social media. Conclusions: Keylessons learned: work lean, use appropriate technologies, tap peoples’ passions, use well‐connected people and extend their reach with social media, failure is not an option, recycling is good, have fun. A second Exchange is planned for World OT Day 2011. We will discuss these lessons and survey results from the 2010 and 2011 <b>Virtual</b> <b>Exchange...</b>|$|R
