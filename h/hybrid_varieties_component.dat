40|$|An {{assessment}} of hybrid winter wheat {{was carried out}} over three seasons to determine the commercial potential of <b>hybrid</b> <b>varieties</b> under Irish conditions. The studies {{examined the effects of}} reduced seeding rate on hybrid grain yield and quality in comparison to pure-line varieties. A comparison of the <b>hybrid</b> <b>varieties</b> available was also carried out and the higher yielding hybrids were then compared with the best pure-line varieties in terms of grain yield and quality, and response to fungicide. The results indicated that in good sowing conditions hybrids can give greater yields than pure-line varieties at reduced seeding rates, but the effect is not large or consistent. There was generally no effect of seeding rate on the grain quality of <b>hybrid</b> <b>varieties</b> but crop lodging occurred in one season at high seeding rates. Of the <b>hybrid</b> <b>varieties</b> examined, Mercury and Hyno Esta were the two better varieties in terms of grain yield; there was little difference between the hybrids examined in terms of grain quality. The best <b>hybrid</b> <b>varieties</b> did not give consistently higher yields or quality than the best pure-line varieties and exhibited a similar response to fungicide application as the pure-line varieties. It is concluded that when the price differential between seed of pure-line <b>varieties</b> and <b>hybrid</b> <b>varieties</b> is taken into account, the winter wheat <b>hybrid</b> <b>varieties</b> currently available do not offer any economic advantages to commercial growers at the present time.

40|$|Hybrid {{breeding}} utilizes {{the advantages}} characterizing F 1 plants in a targeted manner: Vigour, uniformity, and {{a combination of}} all dominant traits of the parental lines. It gives breeders secure licences, as farmers can not save seed from <b>hybrid</b> <b>varieties</b> with a view to replanting. Regarding rye, the current advantages of <b>hybrid</b> <b>varieties</b> are primarily the higher yields but also improved resistances to lodging and sprouting. However, farmers can only benefit from higher yields if the limited market for organic rye in Switzerland can be expanded. The currently available <b>hybrid</b> rye <b>varieties</b> have higher susceptibility to leaf rust and ergot infections. The criticism of hybrid breeding and <b>hybrid</b> <b>varieties</b> concerns four areas: Firstly, the area of intrinsic quality: There are concerns, especially in the biodynamic movement, that continued inbreeding and pollen sterility as part of the breeding process will lead to losses regarding the more subtle ripening and nutritional qualities. This poses the question of adequate research methods. There is still considerable need for research. Secondly, the area of socio-economics: The fact that seed from <b>hybrid</b> <b>varieties</b> can not be saved and replanted leads to greater dependence on breeders and seed producers {{on the part of the}} farmers. At present this is not regarded as a problem in Switzerland as most farmers purchase new seed every year in any case but in the long term it renders agriculture liable to corruption. Thirdly, the ethical field: Some people have concerns regarding the breeders’ intervention into the flowering biology of the relevant cereal species. These interventions are at variance with the basic ethical-philosophical tenets of organic agriculture. Moreover, the fact that the <b>hybrid</b> <b>varieties</b> can not be saved and replanted effectively constitutes “patent protection” and promotes the ethically questionable change in meaning of seed from a cultural asset to a mere means of production. Fourthly: <b>Hybrid</b> <b>varieties</b> of self-sterile plants (e. g. rye) are genetically more vulnerable to environmental influences which were not considered during selection. This point is less relevant as regards self-fertile plants (oilseed rape, barley, wheat) as even today’s pureline varieties are already very uniform. It must be noted that amongst all <b>hybrid</b> <b>varieties</b> which are based on male sterility many so-called “different” varieties may share the same cytoplasm. As the criticisms regarding dependencies and genetic vulnerability only concern the future and the ethical concerns are not shared by everyone, it is the quality issue which is of particular relevance regarding the pending decision on whether or not to ban <b>hybrid</b> <b>varieties</b> in organic bread cereal production in Switzerland. Further research is essential. However, if one is to wait for the relevant results before taking a decision, this will certainly be too late. It would be more realistic to integrate a review clause into a potential decision to refrain from the use of <b>hybrid</b> <b>varieties.</b> Abstaining from the use of <b>hybrid</b> <b>varieties</b> in organic bread cereal production in Switzerland would give a clear signal to upstream and downstream sectors (breeders/trade and consumers respectively) that organic farming strives to consider long-term and future aspects of independence, quality, and diversity and that it would be ready to forego current agronomic advantages to this end. This would need to be clearly communicated to the trade sector when it comes to discussions on market prices. ...|$|R

Leaf area index, chlorophyll status, and photosynthetic rate of flag leaf, postheading crop growth rate, shoot reserve translocation, source-sink relation and yield, and its attributes of each variety were comprehensively analyzed. Both <b>hybrid</b> <b>varieties</b> outyielded the inbred. However, the <b>hybrids</b> and inbred <b>varieties</b> exhibited statistically identical yield in late planting. Both hybrids accumulated higher amount of biomass before heading and exhibited greater remobilization of assimilates to the grain in early plantings compared to the inbred variety.
