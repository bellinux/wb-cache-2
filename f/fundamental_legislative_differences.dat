Although the primary focus here is on the experience of a single state, the lessons to be learned from this case have national and international implications because Michigan is a leader in brownfield programs. The paper begins with a review of the general policy context in which state brownfield policy is made. Particular attention is given to the widespread dissatisfaction of a variety of stakeholders with long dominant federal programs in the area of environmental cleanups. The second section outlines a number of <b>fundamental</b> <b>legislative</b> and administrative changes that have been implemented in Michigan environmental policy over the past decade. Section three reviews the broad literature on issue framing and considers how it might help identify the specific mechanisms by which the innovative brownfield program was adopted.

The {{embezzlement}} of public funds prevents the realization of fundamental social rights and delays national develop- ment prevent inhibiting the real access to citizenship. Brazil needs to face the paradox of being the eighth world’s largest economy, and having low human development indexes. Social justice does not coexist with impunity. Public funds, paid by taxpayers, sidetracked by corruption schemes, fail to reach the investments in the enlargement of public health, education, security and infrastructure. Moreover, the opportunity of corruption increases corruption when there is impunity. To reduce corruption levels in Brazil, it is urgent to think about legal system improvement alternatives, a task which is also entrusted to the academy. Although positive law does not change social reality, the lack of appropriate legal mechanisms prevents the equating of part of the Brazilian’s society problems, such as corruption. In the extrapenal sphere, beginning with constitutional law, it is important to emphasize the need to improve issues such as the strengthening of internal and external controls, reforming constitutional institutions, such as the Courts of Auditors. In addi- tion, the enlargement of transparency and social control of the prosecution performance in infra constitutional sphere requires <b>fundamental</b> <b>legislative</b> reforms, in order to provide for the realization of the human rights enshrined in the 1988 Constitution...|$|R

This is not a consequence of 'technological lag', but a combination of political, cultural and economic factors.

Third, differences in industry organisation account for more DNA paternity tests per capita in the US. Unlike the Australian market, the US market is characteristically divided between tests done for government agencies and those for private individuals.

40|$|The {{social norms}} {{approach}} is an increasingly popular intervention for substance use {{that has been}} used extensively in the American college system. It operates by correcting normative misperceptions individuals hold about their peers. However, there have been few direct comparisons of substance use misperceptions between student populations in different European countries. The current study sought to address this through use of a survey of substance use and normative beliefs at universities in five European countries. Students at each site were invited to take part in an online survey that included items on personal substance use and the perceived use of peers. A total sample of 6404 students was obtained. Mann-Whitney and χ 2 analysis were used to demonstrate an apparent misperception effect, with the majority of students at each site significantly (p< 0. 05) overestimating the substance use of their peers. This study suggests that students in Europe are prone to misperceiving the substance use of their peers {{in a manner similar to}} their American college counterparts, despite the cultural and <b>legislative</b> <b>differences</b> between these settings.

The aim {{of this study was to}} provide the first assessment of exposure to phthalates and DINCH in the general Australian population. De-identified urine specimens stratified by age and sex were obtained from a community-based pathology laboratory and pooled (n = 24 pools of 100). Concentrations of free and total species were measured using online solid phase extraction isotope dilution high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Concentrations ranged from 2. 4 to 71. 9 ng/mL for metabolites of di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate, and from < 0. 5 to 775 ng/mL for all other metabolites. Our data suggest that phthalate metabolites concentrations in Australia were at least two times higher than in the United States and Germany; and may be related to <b>legislative</b> <b>differences</b> among countries. DINCH metabolite concentrations were comparatively low and consistent with the limited data available.

Since December 1999 these processes were developing with especially high speed after adoption of Presidential Decree "On emergency actions aimed at acceleration of reorganization of agricultural sector of economics", which has become <b>fundamental</b> <b>legislative</b> act in conducting land and agricultural reforms. During {{the first year after}} adoption of the abovementioned decree, there started development of land market, which ought to have included: private property for land, legislative protection of land rent, possibilities of free transfers of ownership rights for land from one market subject to another (purchasing and selling of land), as its components. Namely for solving this task, which is important for completion of land reform, Ukrainian Parliament has imposed moratorium that is still in force. First of all in this context, it is necessary to develop institutional background for ownership and selling of land and its main components - cadastre and register of land plots. The task of cadastre - description of physical characteristics of land plots, the register - description of their legal status. It is impossible do develop land market that is civilized and understandable for society without introduction of unified system of land registration. Incompleteness of agricultural transformation led to development of land market under conditions of insufficient legislative regulation. In Ukraine processes purchasing and selling of agricultural lands are developing spontaneously, enlargement and consolidation led to development of extra large agricultural companies that are increasingly influencing situation in agricultural sector, but also in social and economic situation in the country.

40|$|The current {{approach}} to administering the taxation laws by the New Zealand (Inland Revenue) {{is founded on}} the responsive regulation model. Under this model, the administrators' approach reflects the posture adopted by the taxpayer. Thus, {{the focus is on}} extending assistance to compliant taxpayers and punishing recalcitrant taxpayers. If is thought that this model most effectively encourages voluntary compliance by taxpayers and thereby enhances fhe efficiency of tax administration. Notably, this model has been borrowed from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) where it was introduced some years prior to the New Zealand experiment. Pursuant to the model, both the Australian and New Zealand tax administrators describe their relationship with the profession as collaborative or even a partnership. This is in contrast to historical precedents where typically the relationship has been cast as adversarial. The move from an adversarial relationship to a partnership raises many theoretical issues that need to be carefully managed. In particular, issues relating to conflicts of interest, lack of transparency, consistency in application and regulatory capture are conceivable. Nevertheless, there is some evidence to suggest that the partnership model has been better received in New Zealand, at least relative to the Australian experience, which has been more problematic.

Internationally, {{there have been reports}} of adults’ alcohol consumption at school events in the presence of children. The aim of this research was to identify the conditions under which Australian schools are required to apply for a liquor licence and the associated prevalence of liquor licences for these events where children were likely to be present. Methods A document review was conducted to examine temporary liquor licensing legislation. Quantitative analysis was used to examine relevant licensing data. Coding criteria was developed to determine school type, student year levels and the likely presence of children. Results Four jurisdictions provided data on 1817 relevant licences. The average annual licences/ 100 schools was highest amongst Independent schools followed by Catholic and public (government) schools. The rates were highest in Queensland and Victoria where children were present at 61 % and 32 % of events respectively. Conclusions While there are <b>legislative</b> <b>differences</b> across jurisdictions, the prevalence of adults’ alcohol use at school events in the presence of children may reflect the various education department policies and principals’ and school communities’ beliefs and attitudes.

40|$|Most Australian States and Territories have {{legislation}} compelling {{teachers to}} report suspicions {{that a child}} has been or {{is likely to be}} abused or neglected. However, these 'mandatory reporting' laws have significant differences, so teachers in different States and Territories may have quite different legislative duties to report suspected child abuse and neglect. It is important that teachers have an accurate understanding of what they are and are not required to report under the relevant legislation. Legislators and policymakers should also be aware of the differences between laws in Australian jurisdictions to inform ongoing evaluation of their jurisdiction's legal framework; the current contrast between jurisdictions, and particularly the absence in Western Australia of mandatory reporting legislation, recently prompted the Commonwealth Attorney-General to endorse substantial equality in legislation concerning child protection. The {{purpose of this article is}} first to introduce the broad context of mandatory reporting laws before detailing the legislative reporting obligations of Australian teachers. This synthesis reveals some significant differences in the laws between jurisdictions, thus raising questions for legislators and policymakers. Policy-based reporting obligations, which operate in two States instead of legislative reporting duties, are noted. Questions about future legislative directions are raised, based on current <b>legislative</b> <b>differences,</b> the issue of whether legislative reporting duties are more appropriate and effective in practice than policy-based reporting duties, and the absence of research into teacher knowledge of law and policy and into teacher reporting practice. It is recommended that research be undertaken to help answer these pressing questions...|$|R
