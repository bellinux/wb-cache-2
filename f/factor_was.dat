5|$|In {{its first}} season, First Tennessee Park {{developed}} {{a reputation as a}} pitcher's park. In 2015, its park factors were significantly lower than those at other ballparks in the Pacific Coast League (PCL) and across Triple-A baseball. The park had the lowest run and home-run factors of all 30Triple-A teams, and its hits <b>factor</b> <b>was</b> the fifth-lowest in Triple-A and the fourth-lowest in the PCL. In 2016, the park had the lowest home-run factors in Triple-A, its runs <b>factor</b> <b>was</b> the sixth-lowest in Triple-A and fifth-lowest in the PCL, and its hits <b>factor</b> <b>was</b> the seventh-lowest in Triple-A and the sixth-lowest in the PCL.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{many factors}} were {{important}} in arranging royal marriages. One such <b>factor</b> <b>was</b> {{the amount of}} territory that the other royal family governed or controlled. Another, related <b>factor</b> <b>was</b> {{the stability of the}} control exerted over that territory: when there was territorial instability in a royal family, other royalty would be less inclined to marry into that family. Another <b>factor</b> <b>was</b> political alliance: marriage was an important way to bind together royal families and their countries during peace and war and could justify many important political decisions.|$|E
5|$|For {{the second}} year in a row, The X <b>Factor</b> <b>was</b> {{sponsored}} by TalkTalk, as part of a three-year sponsorship deal thought to be worth £20million, including sponsorship of the show, the 2011 live tour and rights to online clips. TalkTalk enlisted series 6 contestants Jedward to launch its interactive initiative on 17 August 2010. Viewers were invited to record a video of themselves performing karaoke in front of a TalkTalk bright lights backdrop, and clips were screened as part of TalkTalk's sponsorship break bumpers. In Ireland, where the series was broadcast on TV3, The X <b>Factor</b> <b>was</b> sponsored by Dominos Pizza.|$|E

40|$|<b>Factoring</b> <b>is</b> a {{financial}} tool, which allows companies to gain money before the maturity of the invoices issued by them. <b>Factoring</b> can <b>be</b> provided as a regression or non-recourse.

5|$|According {{to other}} reports, a {{motivating}} <b>factor</b> <b>was</b> {{the desire to}} establish a historic district in Ypsilanti, to prevent the city from replacing historic buildings on North Huron Street and in Depot Town with new construction. A group of Ypsilantians applied to the state for funding to publish a guidebook to the city's historic homes, and were told that no money was available for that purpose, but that there was funding available to stage a festival. A $15,000 grant from the state helped to fund the 1979 Ypsilanti Yesteryear Heritage Festival.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} component to the Holocaust in Lithuania {{was that the}} occupying Nazi German administration fanned antisemitism by blaming the Soviet regime's recent annexation of Lithuania, a year earlier, on the Jewish community. Another significant <b>factor</b> <b>was</b> the large {{extent to which the}} Nazis' design drew upon the physical organization, preparation and execution of their orders by local Lithuanian auxiliaries of the Nazi occupation regime.|$|E
5|$|Another <b>factor</b> <b>was</b> {{the weather}} within the {{operational}} theater. The cyclical monsoon patterns {{meant that the}} weather was deplorable for flight operations eight {{months of the year}} (from late September to early May) when rain and fog tended to conceal targets. Lack of adequate all-weather and night-bombing capability made it necessary for the majority of U.S. missions to be conducted during daylight hours, thereby easing the burden on the air defense forces of North Vietnam.|$|E

Schaefer stood by Welles and opposed the board of governors. When RKO still delayed the film's release Welles offered to buy the film for $1 million and the studio finally agreed to release the film on May 1.|$|E
5|$|The {{coenzyme}} NAD {{was first}} {{discovered by the}} British biochemists Arthur Harden and William John Young in 1906. They noticed that adding boiled and filtered yeast extract greatly accelerated alcoholic fermentation in unboiled yeast extracts. They called the unidentified factor responsible for this effect a coferment. Through a long and difficult purification from yeast extracts, this heat-stable <b>factor</b> <b>was</b> identified as a nucleotide sugar phosphate by Hans von Euler-Chelpin. In 1936, the German scientist Otto Heinrich Warburg showed {{the function of the}} nucleotide coenzyme in hydride transfer and identified the nicotinamide portion as the site of redox reactions.|$|E
5000|$|The differencebetween {{the safety}} factor and design factor (design safety <b>factor)</b> <b>is</b> as follows: The safety <b>factor</b> <b>is</b> {{how much the}} {{designed}} part actually {{will be able to}} withstand (first [...] "use" [...] from above). The design <b>factor</b> <b>is</b> what the item is required to be able to withstand (second [...] "use"). The design <b>factor</b> <b>is</b> defined for an application (generally provided in advance and often set by regulatory code or policy) and is not an actual calculation, the safety <b>factor</b> <b>is</b> a ratio of maximum strength to intended load for the actual item that was designed.|$|R

5|$|What {{followed}} next is {{not entirely}} clear, but Heraclius certainly won a crushing victory over Shahrbaraz {{in the fall of}} 622. The key <b>factor</b> <b>was</b> Heraclius' discovery of Persian forces hidden in ambush and responding by feigning retreat during the battle. The Persians left their cover to chase the Byzantines, whereupon Heraclius' elite Optimatoi assaulted the pursuing Persians, causing them to flee. Thus he saved Anatolia from the Persians. Heraclius had to return to Constantinople, however, to deal with the threat posed to his Balkan domains by the Avars, so he left his army to winter in Pontus.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} factors contributed to the {{collapse}} of this initial resistance and to nearly all non-Muslim majority princely states agreeing to accede to India. An important <b>factor</b> <b>was</b> the lack of unity among the princes. The smaller states did not trust the larger states to protect their interests, and many Hindu rulers did not trust Muslim princes, in particular Hamidullah Khan, the Nawab of Bhopal and a leading proponent of independence, whom they viewed as an agent for Pakistan. Others, believing integration to be inevitable, sought to build bridges with the Congress, hoping thereby to gain a say in shaping the final settlement. The resultant inability to present a united front or agree on a common position significantly reduced their bargaining power in negotiations with the Congress. The decision by the Muslim League {{to stay out of the}} Constituent Assembly was also fatal to the princes' plan to build an alliance with it to counter the Congress, and attempts to boycott the Constituent Assembly altogether failed on 28 April 1947, when the states of Baroda, Bikaner, Cochin, Gwalior, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Patiala and Rewa took their seats in the Assembly.|$|E

5|$|According to Baley, {{political}} and economic factors prompted two Hedgpeth and two Baley families to leave northwestern Missouri for California in early 1858. One <b>factor</b> <b>was</b> {{the enactment of the}} Kansas-Nebraska Act, which admitted Nebraska into the Union as a free territory and granted Kansas the right to decide on the legality of slavery within the state. The resulting tensions between pro-slavery and anti-slavery groups fueled conflict near the Missouri state line, affecting its western counties, including Nodaway, where the Baleys and Hedgpeths lived. In Baley's opinion, the financial Panic of 1857 further contributed to instability in the region, driving many mid-westerners to seek a better life in California. The combined Baley-Hedgpeth outfits were led by a forty-four-year-old veteran of the Black Hawk War, Gillum Baley, and comprised eight Murphy wagons, sixty-two oxen, seventy-five head of cattle, and several riding horses. They employed half-a-dozen grubstakers to tend their stock.|$|E
5|$|After {{the line}} had {{been relegated to}} a branch line, traffic fell considerably. Another <b>factor</b> <b>was</b> car traffic, which {{did not exist in}} Flekkefjord until 1918, but {{thereafter}} became widespread. After the war, Class 20 steam locomotives were used on the line. During the 1940, several railcars of Class 87 were taken into use, and soon all passenger trains were operated using such units. From 1956 to 1966, also Class 86 units were used on the line, but the narrow profile of the tunnels made operations problematic. Class 87 remained in service until 1981, when used Class 89 units were bought from Sweden. At first, two Y7 units were brought to Norway on 23 January and taken into service on 24 February. After they proved to work well, NSB bought them for 95,000 Swedish kronor plus freight. Two more units were bought in 1986.|$|E
5|$|Another <b>factor</b> <b>was</b> that, {{in early}} May 1944, an {{uncontrolled}} agent based in Spain (who sold fictional intelligence to the Germans) had passed on {{details of a}} meeting in Gibraltar between several high-ranking Allied officers. Documents found after the war indicate that the Germans found this information suspect, and may have treated Montgomery's appearance as equally so. Although double agents received several urgent requests from the Abwehr about his whereabouts {{it does not appear}} that this information was passed on to the German command in France. According to captured enemy generals, German intelligence believed that it was Montgomery, though they still guessed that it was a feint. The Bodyguard deception had confused the German command as to Allied intentions and the apparent arrival of Montgomery in Gibraltar added little to the picture.|$|E

(1) is used to indicate that all <b>factors</b> <b>are</b> at their lowest (or first) values.|$|R
5|$|Another {{important}} <b>factor</b> <b>was</b> {{the development}} in the late 18th and early 19th centuries of museums with large natural history collections. These museums received specimens from collectors {{around the world and}} served as centers for the study of comparative anatomy and morphology. These disciplines played key roles {{in the development of a}} more technically sophisticated form of natural history. One of the first and most important examples was the Museum of Natural History in Paris, which was at the center of many of the developments in natural history during the first decades of the 19th century. It was founded in 1793 by an act of the French National Assembly, and was based on an extensive royal collection plus the private collections of aristocrats confiscated during the French revolution, and expanded by material seized in French military conquests during the Napoleonic Wars. The Paris museum was the professional base for Cuvier, and his professional rival Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire. The English anatomists Robert Grant and Richard Owen both spent time studying there. Owen would go on to become the leading British morphologist while working at the museum of the Royal College of Surgeons.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1970s, foreign work (such as the Bosporus Bridge in Turkey, {{completed}} 1974) was accelerating while domestic {{orders were}} receding, {{according to the}} company's annual report of 1975. By 1980, foreign work {{accounted for more than}} 50% of Hochtief's business. A major <b>factor</b> <b>was</b> the contract for King Abdulaziz International Airport (completed 1981), the largest airport in Saudi Arabia, and the most valuable contract Hochtief had ever been involved with. The architecture of the airport is highly rated aesthetically, and it has several unusual features, including Terminal Three, used only during the Hajj, reserved for pilgrims travelling to Mecca. It has a tent-shaped fibreglass roof, contains a mosque, can accommodate 80,000 travellers at once, and {{is believed to be the}} largest terminal in the world.|$|E
5|$|From 1848 {{to the end}} of the 19th century, local Polish and Czech people co-operated, united {{against the}} Germanizing tendencies of the Austrian Empire and later of Austria-Hungary. At the end of the century, ethnic {{tensions}} arose as the area's economic significance grew. This growth caused a wave of immigration from Galicia. About 60,000 people arrived between 1880 and 1910. The new immigrants were Polish and poor, about half of them being illiterate. They worked in coal mining and metallurgy. For these people the most important <b>factor</b> <b>was</b> material well-being; they cared little about the homeland from which they had fled. Almost all of them assimilated into the Czech population. Many of them settled in Ostrava (west of the ethnic border), as heavy industry was spread through the whole western part of Cieszyn Silesia. Even today, ethnographers find that about 25,000 people in Ostrava (about 8% of the population) have Polish surnames.|$|E
