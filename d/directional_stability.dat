5|$|In 1947, {{before the}} flight {{testing of the}} prototypes was completed, 30 {{production}} aircraft were ordered. They incorporated an ejection seat and a redesigned vertical stabilizer {{as well as two}} auxiliary fins, one towards the tip {{on each side of the}} tailplane in an attempt to improve the <b>directional</b> <b>stability</b> of the aircraft. The fuselage was lengthened to fit additional equipment and the wing had fillets added at the rear junction with the fuselage.|$|E
5|$|Cheyenne {{prototype}} #6 (s/n 66-8831) began conducting weapons {{testing at}} Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona, demonstrating {{the ability for}} the gunner and pilot to accurately fire on separate targets on each side on the helicopter. Towards the end of 1970, the Army funded work on TOW missile guidance and night sighting systems. Prototypes #6 and #9 were also tested and evaluated at Yuma Proving Ground from 30 January to 23 December 1971, to determine if stability and control systems were sufficient. Deficiencies were identified in lateral <b>directional</b> <b>stability,</b> uncommanded motion during maneuvering, high vibration, and poor directional control during sidewards flying.|$|E
5|$|The tests {{conducted}} {{in preparation for}} the parade revealed a number of flaws in the design including poor <b>directional</b> <b>stability,</b> a cramped cockpit without heating or ventilation, poor access to the engine, inadequate fuel capacity, compounded by the lack of a fuel gauge, and poor elevator control forces. Five aircraft were modified to correct these issues before resuming the factory's testing in late 1946. The modifications were not entirely successful and the lateral stability was now too great and the elevator forces remained too weak. Engine problems, however, plagued the tests as the first prototype alone required four engine changes.|$|E
40|$|It is {{endeavored}} in {{this report}} to give a full outline {{of the problem of}} airplane stability and to classify the proposed solutions systematically. Longitudinal stability, which can be studied separately, is considered first. The combination of lateral and <b>directional</b> <b>stabilities,</b> which cannot be separated, will be dealt with later...|$|R
5000|$|An {{aircraft}} stabilizer is an aerodynamic surface, typically {{including one}} or more movable control surfaces, that provides longitudinal (pitch) and/or <b>directional</b> (yaw) <b>stability</b> and control. A stabilizer can feature a fixed or adjustable structure on which any movable control surfaces are hinged, or it can itself be a fully movable surface such as a stabilator. Depending on the context, [...] "stabilizer" [...] may sometimes describe only the front {{part of the overall}} surface.|$|R
50|$|A {{vertical}} stabilizer provides <b>directional</b> (or yaw) <b>stability</b> and usually comprises a fixed fin and movable control rudder hinged to its rear edge. Less commonly, {{there is no}} hinge and the whole fin surface is pivoted for both stability and control.|$|R
5|$|A {{factor that}} {{influences}} the <b>directional</b> <b>stability</b> of a bike is wheelbase, the horizontal {{distance between the}} ground contact points of {{the front and rear}} wheels. For a given displacement of the front wheel, due to some disturbance, the angle of the resulting path from the original is inversely proportional to wheelbase. Also, the radius of curvature for a given steer angle and lean angle is proportional to the wheelbase. Finally, the wheelbase increases when the bike is leaned and steered. In the extreme, when the lean angle is 90°, and the bike is steered in the direction of that lean, the wheelbase is increased by the radius of the front and rear wheels.|$|E
5|$|<b>Directional</b> <b>stability</b> was {{achieved}} by four fixed vanes, two vertical and two horizontal, attached {{at the rear of}} the gas-bag, and by a long vertical vane running along the main axis of the gas-bag from the centre of the elliptical frame to its rear. Horizontal motion was controlled by the movement of a balanced rudder at the rear of an empennage on a long boom, mounted below the gas-bag and aft of the gondola (see lead image). The empennage consisted of vertical and horizontal vanes arranged like the fletching of an arrow, behind which the vertical rudder was mounted. During a refit in 1907 the vertical vanes of the empennage were modified, as is shown in the accompanying illustration.|$|E
5|$|The trainer {{version of}} the AV-8B is the TAV-8B, seating two pilots in tandem. Among other changes, the forward {{fuselage}} features a 3ft 11in (1.19m) extension to accommodate the second cockpit. To compensate for the slight loss of <b>directional</b> <b>stability,</b> the vertical stabilizer's area was enlarged through increases in chord (length of the stabilizer's root) and height. USMC TAV-8Bs feature the AV-8B's digital cockpit and new systems, but have only two hardpoints and are not combat capable. Initial TAV-8Bs were powered by a 21,450lbf (95.4kN) F402-RR-406A engine, while later examples were fitted with the 23,000lbf (105.8kN) F402-RR-408A. In the early 2000s, 17 TAV-8Bs were upgraded to include a night-attack capability, the F402-RR-408 engine, and software and structural changes.|$|E
40|$|Currently, <b>directional</b> and <b>stability</b> {{control systems}} (rudders and flaps) of {{high speed craft}} (HSC) are made by steel {{box-shaped}} elements. This is mainly caused by the high hydrodynamic stresses applied on these elements due to the high cruising speed of HSC. In {{order to reduce the}} weight of these elements and to increase the resistance to external corrosive action, innovative manufacturing technologies and new materials are studied. In this paper, innovative hybrid steel-composite rudder are presented to use in high speed craft...|$|R
40|$|The {{modification}} of a C- 8 A (De Havilland Buffalo) aircraft to a STOL configuration is discussed. The modification {{consisted of the}} installation of an augmentor-wing jet flap system. System design requirements were investigated for the lateral and directional flight control systems, the lateral and <b>directional</b> axes <b>stability</b> augmentation systems, the engine and Pegasus nozzle control systems, and the hydraulic systems. Operational techniques for STOL landings, control of engine failures, and pilot techniques for improving engine-out go-around performance were examined. Design changes have been identified to correct deficiencies {{in areas of the}} airplane control sytems and to improve the airplane flying qualities...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation has}} been made {{to determine the effects of}} vertical fins near the nose of the fuselage on the <b>directional</b> and dsmping-in-yaw <b>stability</b> derivatives of a swept-wing airplane model. The investigation included measurements of these characteristics for the model oscillating about a vertical axis in a steady airstresn. The results of this investigation showed that, for angles of attack up to at least 12 °, fins placed above the fuselage nose decreased the directional stabillty but increased the damping in yaw of the model in both the steady-state and oscillatory conditions because of the sidewash acting on the tail as welIlas the direct lift of the fins. Also, fins placed above the fuselage nose were more effective in increasing the steady-state or oscillatory damping in yaw than the addition of an equal * amount of area at the vertical tail. Fins pticed below the nose of the fuselage decreased the <b>directional</b> a <b>stability</b> snd increased the damping in yaw to a lesser extent than fins placed above the fuselage nose in the steady-state condition but reduced the dsmoim in v“awin the oscillator condition.

5|$|As the TR-1 engines {{originally}} {{intended for the}} Su-9 were not yet ready for flight testing in late 1945, Pavel Sukhoi suggested substituting a pair of Jumo 004 engines and this was approved on 15 December. The full-scale mockup {{was found to be}} acceptable on 16 February 1946 and the Council of People's Commissars issued an order on 26 February that the manufacturer's flight testing was to begin on 1 November. This goal was not met because the OKB was heavily committed to other projects like the trainer version of the Tupolev Tu-2 bomber, inexperience with JATO units, and late delivery of RD-10 engines. The first prototype was completed in mid-October and made its first flight on 13 November. The test pilots found the aircraft easy to fly, but the control forces were very high at speed and it lacked enough <b>directional</b> <b>stability.</b> Enlarging the vertical stabilizer cured this last problem and hydraulic boosters were fitted for the control system.|$|E
25|$|A keel may {{be fitted}} on a hull to {{increase}} the transverse stability, <b>directional</b> <b>stability</b> or to create lift.|$|E
25|$|The {{crash was}} caused by turbulence-induced {{structural}} failure. Due to buffeting stresses, the stabilizer shaft broke and the B-52's vertical stabilizer came off the plane. It was found 1.5 miles (2.4km) from where the plane struck the mountain side. With {{the loss of the}} vertical stabilizer, the aircraft had lost its <b>directional</b> <b>stability</b> and rolled uncontrollably.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a semi-active differential, called MRF LSD (MagnetoRheological Fluid Limited Slip Differential) that allows to bias torque between the driving wheels. It {{is based on}} the magnetorheological (MR) fluid employment, that allows to change, in a controlled manner, the differential locking torque and, consequently, the torque bias ratio. The device is an adaptive one and allows to obtain an asymmetric torque distribution in order to improve vehicle handling. The device modelling and the control algorithm, realized for this activity, are described. The illustrated results highlight the advantages that are attainable regarding <b>directional</b> behaviour, <b>stability</b> and traction for a front wheel drive (FWD) vehicle. A comparison with a traditional passive limited slip differential has been conducted...|$|R
40|$|The lateral {{directional}} characteristics of an F- 18 aircraft was investigated. Aerodynamic derivatives associated with pure roll rate, or the 'p' derivatives were obtained. The model is described and the procedures {{used to obtain}} and correct the data, and a graphical presentation of the results are presented. These results include graphs of the lateral <b>directional</b> static <b>stability</b> derivatives versus angle of attack, and the lateral directional force and moment coefficients versus nondimensional roll rate. Results are presented for several configurations including complete, complete without vertical tails, complete without horizontal tails, fuselage wing and fuselage alone. Each of these configuations was tested with and without wing leading edge extensions. The basic control surfaces were deflected {{and the results were}} investigated...|$|R
40|$|The curved flow {{capability}} of a stability wind tunnel {{was used to}} investigate the lateral directional characteristics of an F- 18 aircraft. The model is described and the procedures used to obtain and correct the data and a graphical presentation of the results are presented. The results include graphs of lateral directional derivatives versus sideslip or static plots, the lateral <b>directional</b> static <b>stability</b> derivatives versus angle of attack, and finally the lateral directional derivatives versus nondimensional yaw rate for different angles of attack and sideslip. Results are presented for several configurations including complete, complete without vertical tails, complete without horizontal tails, fuselage wing and fuselage alone.

25|$|Production was slow, so {{that many}} were {{obsolete}} {{almost as soon}} as they reached their units. They were difficult to fly because of the aforementioned poor <b>directional</b> <b>stability.</b> Recovery from a spin was a matter of luck. Another reason it was unpopular with pilots was that, until the final batch, the armament was positioned out of their reach, making it impossible to clear stoppages while airborne.|$|E
25|$|The first {{prototype}} flew on 7 March 1957, revealing poor <b>directional</b> <b>stability</b> {{which led}} to a taller vertical fin, and later to hexagonal auxiliary fins at the tips of the tailplane. Entering production at Zavod (factory) No.64, Voronezh in 1957, the initial three aircraft were delivered with Kuznetsov NK-4 engines, due to non-availability of the Ivchenko AI-20 engines. From 1958, production aircraft were delivered with the Ivchenko AI-20A engines which boasted a longer service life and comparable performance compared to the Kuznetsov engines.|$|E
25|$|The KDW was {{essentially}} the D.I {{with a small}} increase in wingspan and mounted on a twin-float chassis. To counteract the keel effect resulting from the floats, which were below the aircraft's centre of gravity, vertical tailfin area was added below and later above the fuselage. Even with the added tailfin area, the aircraft's lateral stabilityits tendency to return from a bank to vertical flightwas below par. Moreover, the deep fuselage tended to blanket the small tailfin and rudder, making <b>directional</b> <b>stability</b> and control very poor.|$|E
25|$|The {{selected}} pilots {{trained on}} the F-100A at Edwards Air Force Base and George Air Force Base in California and then at Palmdale Air Force Base for training with the actual RF-100As they would be deployed with. Flight tests revealed that the RF-100A in its intended operational fit of four external tanks was lacking in <b>directional</b> and longitudinal <b>stability,</b> requiring careful handling and close attention to speed limitations for the drop tanks.|$|R
50|$|<b>Directional</b> or {{weathercock}} <b>stability</b> {{is concerned}} with the static stability of the airplane about the z axis. Just {{as in the case of}} longitudinal stability it is desirable that the aircraft should tend to return to an equilibrium condition when subjected to some form of yawing disturbance. For this the slope of the yawing moment curve must be positive.An airplane possessing this mode of stability will always point towards the relative wind, hence the name weathercock stability.|$|R
40|$|The slow {{development}} of {{active safety systems}} of the automobile all-wheel drive vehicles {{is the cause of}} lack of researches in the field of power distribution under the specific conditions of movement. The purpose of work is to develop methods to control a curvilinear motion of 4 x 4 cars with a link to the rear axle that provides the increase in <b>directional</b> and trajectory <b>stability</b> of the car. The paper analyses the known methods to increase wheeled vehicles movement stability. It also offers a method for power flow redistribution in the transmission of the car 4 x 4 with a link to the rear axle, providing the increase in <b>directional</b> and trajectory <b>stability</b> of the car. To study the performance and effectiveness of the proposed method a mathematical model of the moving car 4 x 4 with a link to the rear axle is developed. Simulation methods allowed us to establish the following: 1. for car 4 x 4 with redistribution of torque between the driving axles in the range of 100 : 0 - 50 : 50 and with redistribution of torque between the wheels of the rear axle in the range of 0 : 100 the most effective are the stabilization algorithms used in combination “Lowing power consumption of the engine +Creation of stabilizing the moment due to the redistribution of torque on different wheels", providing the increase in <b>directional</b> and trajectory <b>stability</b> by 12 [...] . 93 %; 2. for car 4 x 4 with redistribution of torque between the driving axles in the range 100 : 0 - 0 : 100 and with redistribution of torque between the wheels of the rear axle in the range of 0 : 100 the best option is a combination of algorithms "Lowing power consumption of the engine + Creation of stabilizing moment due to redistribution of torques on different wheels", providing the increase in <b>directional</b> and trajectory <b>stability</b> by 27 [...] . 93 %. A comparative analysis of algorithms efficiency of dynamic stabilization system operation for two-axle wheeled vehicles depending on the torque redistribution between the driving axles in the range 100 : 0 - 0 : 100 and 100 : 0 - 50 : 50 shows that the efficiency of 100 : 0 - 0 : 100 control options in a turn is higher (up to 12 %), than in case of 100 : 0 - 50 : 50 because of the great range of torque regulation on driving axles. </p...|$|R
25|$|From 17 June 1942, a Rotachute Mark III was air-towed {{behind a}} Tiger Moth on a 300ft (91.4 m) tow line. After two towed flights, the Rotachute was {{released}} {{at an altitude}} of 200ft (61 m) and made the first manned free flight and controlled landing. Further free flights were made from altitudes up to 3,900ft (1,189 m). On 1 July 1942, AFEE moved its main base from Ringway to RAF Sherburn-in-Elmet. Additional <b>directional</b> <b>stability</b> was achieved in the Rotachute Mark IV, that introduced endplates onto the rigid tailplanes.|$|E
25|$|The {{prototype}} {{was built}} and first flown in early 1936 (registration SP-AXY), {{funded by the}} Polish division of Osram factory. The plane did not appear a successful design, though. Test revealed lack of <b>directional</b> <b>stability,</b> therefore its rudder was much enlarged, the wings were fitted with fixed slats and a windshield was redesigned. It did not improve the situation much, and in 1937-1938 the prototype was rebuilt and fitted with stronger 60hp Avia 3 engine in a lengthened nose, while the vertical stabilizer and rudder were made smaller. Most significant feature became a front windshield with a negative slope.|$|E
25|$|An {{integrated}} system has several technical advantages {{in comparison to}} towed barges. Traditionally tugs, being short in length, have to operate at relatively high Froude numbers resulting in high wave making resistance and the barges, being towed in the tugs' wake, have skegs that improve <b>directional</b> <b>stability</b> but increase drag. Positioning the tug behind the barge in a stern notch improves the hydrodynamic efficiency of the combination, resulting in significant reductions in the total resistance. In addition the tug, operating {{in the wake of}} the barge, has better control over the combination and thus improves seaworthiness and maneuverability in comparison to the traditional towing arrangement.|$|E
40|$|The {{notion of}} {{principal}} configuration of immersions of surfaces into R 3, due to Sotomayor and Gutierrez [16] for lines of curvature and umbilics, is extended {{to that of}} mean directional configuration for immersed surfaces in R 4. This configuration consists on the families of mean directionally curved lines, along which the second fundamental form points {{in the direction of}} the mean curvature vector, and their singularities, called here H-singularities. The concepts of H-singularities and periodic mean directionally curved lines are studied here in detail. Also the notion of principal structural stability of immersions of surfaces into R 3 is extended to that of mean <b>directional</b> structural <b>stability,</b> for the case of sur-faces in R 4.

However, {{they do not have}} details of linkage connections or structure compliance. The models have been validated repeatedly by manufacturers for reproducing overall vehicle motions needed to evaluate handling, <b>directional</b> and roll <b>stability,</b> braking, and acceleration. On the other hand, they do not include component details needed to determine durability, fatigue, or high-frequency vibrations.|$|R
25|$|The D.8 was a {{tailless}} four bay unstaggered biplane {{with its}} wings swept at 32°. Its constant chord wings were built up around two spruce spars, the forward one forming the leading edge. To help achieve stability the incidence and interplane gap decreased outboard, the former becoming negative. This washout on tips well behind {{the centre of}} gravity provided longitudinal stability {{in the same way}} as a conventional tailplane, set at lower incidence than the wings. Camber increased outwards. Simple, near parallel, pairs of interplane struts joined the spars. The outer interplane struts were enclosed with fabric, forming fixed side curtains that provided <b>directional</b> (yaw) <b>stability.</b> Wing tip elevons were used for control, operated by a pair of levers, one either side of the pilot. The D.8 initially used just a pair of these, mounted on the upper wing, a rectangular cutout in the side curtains allowing for their movement as on the D.5. Large parts of the aircraft were built by Short Brothers.|$|R
25|$|A {{classical}} hunting oscillation is a swaying {{motion of}} a railway vehicle (often called truck hunting) {{caused by the}} coning action on which the <b>directional</b> <b>stability</b> of an adhesion railway depends. It arises from the interaction of adhesion forces and inertial forces. At low speed, adhesion dominates but, as the speed increases, the adhesion forces and inertial forces become comparable in magnitude and the oscillation begins at a critical speed. Above this speed, the motion can be violent, damaging track and wheels and potentially causing derailment. The problem does not occur on systems with a differential because the action depends on both wheels of a wheelset rotating at the same angular rate, although differentials tend to be rare, and conventional trains have their wheels fixed to the axles in pairs instead.|$|E
25|$|Modern dory {{designers}} include Phil Bolger of Gloucester and John Welsford of New Zealand. Most modern dories {{are about}} 15–16 feet long, built of lightweight plywood, fastened by fibreglass tape and epoxy resin. They are much lighter than traditional dories and {{compensate for the}} lack of initial stability by having slightly wider bottoms and very low (8inch high) seats and are fitted with skegs for <b>directional</b> <b>stability.</b> Welsford recommends the carrying of a water container on a rope that can be thrown to either the bow or stern to adjust trim in different sea conditions. Unlike a conventional wide bottom dinghy it is dangerous to sit or stand in the extreme ends due to the minimal displacement. Modern designs, like their traditional counterparts, gain significant stability when heavily laden amidships.|$|E
25|$|The {{hull of the}} Contessa 32 is {{generally}} seen as a cross between older and newer designs. She has the well ballasted keel, low centre of gravity, and narrow beam of traditional English cutters, but has a fin keel characteristic of newer, lighter racing yachts. The narrow beam and substantial ballast provide {{a high degree of}} positive stability, with an AVS of 155°, although due to her small size the STIX is only 33. If knocked down or capsized, the Contessa readily rights herself. Because it is shorter than a full-length keel, a fin keel creates less drag. The blending of the keel into the hull forward captures the lateral stability of a full keel, and with the cut away aft portion lends greater responsiveness to the helm. While the skeg bestows additional lateral resistance to the hull aft producing <b>directional</b> <b>stability,</b> its robust design also supports and protects the rudder.|$|E
40|$|AbstractAs to {{guarantee}} flight safety when system failures occur, modern fly-by-wire flight control systems for commercial aircraft incorporate reconfiguration control modes. While relaxed static stabilities (RSS) are utilized on most new designed fly-by-wire airliners, the flying qualities design {{become a major}} concern when reconfiguration flight control laws are developed. The aim {{of this paper is}} to analyze the reduction of flying qualities when reconfiguration laws are activated. Longitudinal and lateral-directional control laws, along with their alternative and direct modes, were developed for a commercial aircraft with relaxed longitudinal and <b>directional</b> static <b>stabilities.</b> Flying qualities assessment with reconfiguration laws were carried out based on the handling qualities rating method (HQRM), which has certification levels connected to military specifications such as MIL-STD- 1797 A. The analysis indicated that short period mode and Dutch roll mode are most affected in the downgrade of flight control law. It is suggested that qualities of these modes should be guaranteed as priority when reconfiguration laws are designed...|$|R

Static bifurcation in feedback systems {{is linked to}} degeneracies in the system zero dynamics.
