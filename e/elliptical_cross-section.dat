40|$|Cylindrical metal shells with <b>elliptical</b> <b>cross-sections</b> {{are gaining}} {{increasing}} popularity as hollow sections {{due to their}} unique aesthetic appearance and different geometric properties about their two principal axes, with one axis exhibiting properties that are significantly more favourable than the other under flexure. However, in comparison with other hollow geometries, <b>elliptical</b> <b>cross-sections</b> have only recently begun receiving significant research attention. This is partly because even simple analytical treatments inevitably encounter cumbersome elliptical integrals that have no closed-form solutions, a problem now attenuated by powerful modern computing capabilities. A recent computational study investigated the nonlinear buckling resistance of perfect elastic circular cylindrical shells under uniform bending, establishing four distinct length-dependent domains of behaviour and characterising these in compact form using specially chosen dimensionless parameters. The present study extends this work to cylinders with <b>elliptical</b> <b>cross-sections</b> under bending about both principal axes. The same qualitative domains of length-dependent nonlinear elastic behaviour are found as for circular cylinders, but requiring a different algebraic characterisation that takes account of the varying elliptical radii. On the basis of computational results, a reference equation for the moment governing the ‘Brazier’ ovalisation cross-sectional failure mode for long elliptical thin-walled cylinders is deduced and presented for publication for the first time...|$|R

40|$|The {{molecular}} {{origin of}} the stress in entangled polymers is reconsidered here, in order to ascertain {{whether or not the}} pressure that the confined chain exerts on its 'tube of constraints' should be accounted for.

The analysis shows that the pressure terms significantly contribute to the stress provided flow or deformation creates a long-lasting local anisotropy of the chain confinement. The effects of such anisotropy is described by means of <b>elliptical</b> <b>cross-sections</b> of the constraining tubes. The new expression for the stress tensor thus obtained properly degenerates into the classical one for circular cross sections. It is also shown that the stress-optical law remains obeyed.
