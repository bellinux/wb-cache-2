25|$|In pre-modern times, {{environmental}} issues were not widely discussed, though Ashoka banned {{the burning of}} forests and promoted the planting of trees in his edicts. Bhikkhu Bodhi, an American Theravada monk, has been outspoken {{about the issue of}} environmental crisis. Bodhi holds that the root of the current ecological crisis is the belief that increased production and consumption to satisfy our material and sensual desires leads to well being. The subjugation of nature is directly opposed to the Buddhist view of non-harming and dwelling in nature. Buddhist activists such as Ajahn Pongsak in Thailand and the Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement have worked for reforestation and environmental protection. The Dalai Lama also professes the close relationship of human beings and nature, saying that since humans come from nature, {{there is no point in}} going against it. He advocates that a clean environment should be considered a basic human right and that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>our</b> <b>responsibility</b> as humans to ensure that we do all we can to pass on a healthy world to those who come after us.|$|E

The truth is that fate simply cannot <b>be</b> known because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> as though <b>it</b> <b>is</b> decided behind the stage. Therefore, the attitude of surrender to all conditions is actually wrong – and is not justified in the Wayang. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> precisely by assuming responsibility for the things around us that we encounter what has been determined for us, we find our own duties by behaving in a way that is appropriate for whatever <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>our</b> <b>responsibilities</b> demand from us”.|$|R
