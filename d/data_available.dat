5|$|According to {{specialist}} Gabriel Defert on {{the basis}} of statistical <b>data</b> <b>available</b> from the Portuguese and Indonesian authorities, and from the Catholic Church, between December 1975 and December 1981, approximately 308,000 Timorese lost their lives; this constituted about 44% of the pre-invasion population. Similarly Indonesian Professor George Aditjondro, formerly of Salatiga University in Java, concluded from his study of Indonesian Army data that in fact 300,000 Timorese had been killed {{in the early years of}} the occupation.|$|E

5|$|Many {{hundreds}} of smaller {{members of the}} family, some only a few meters across, have been discovered since {{the launch of the}} SOHO satellite in 1995. None of these smaller comets have survived its perihelion passage. Larger sungrazers such as the Great Comet of 1843 and C/2011 W3 (Lovejoy) have survived their perihelion passage.

5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{assessed}} the Galapagos shark as near threatened, as its low reproductive rate limits {{its capacity to}} withstand population depletion. There is no specific utilization <b>data</b> <b>available,</b> though this species is certainly caught by commercial fisheries operating across many parts of its range. The meat {{is said to be}} of excellent quality. While still common at areas such as Hawaii, the Galapagos shark may have been extirpated from sites around Central America and its fragmented distribution means other regional populations may also be at risk. The populations at the Kermadec and Galapagos Islands are protected within marine reserves.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of such tools {{has been driven}} by the large amount of genomic and proteomic <b>data</b> <b>available</b> for a variety of organisms, including the human genome. It is simply impossible to study all proteins experimentally, hence only a few are subjected to laboratory experiments while computational tools are used to extrapolate to similar proteins. Such homologous proteins can be efficiently identified in distantly related organisms by sequence alignment. Genome and gene sequences can be searched by a variety of tools for certain properties. Sequence profiling tools can find restriction enzyme sites, open reading frames in nucleotide sequences, and predict secondary structures. Phylogenetic trees can be constructed and evolutionary hypotheses developed using special software like ClustalW regarding the ancestry of modern organisms and the genes they express. The field of bioinformatics is now indispensable for the analysis of genes and proteins.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} {{originally}} broadcast on the digital channel BBC Three from 11 pm on Tuesday, 28 October 2008, after the {{broadcast of the}} second episode on BBC One. The episode would later be repeated on BBC One on Monday, 3 November 2008 during the 9 pm to 10 pm time slot, except in Northern Ireland, where it was withheld until 10:35 pm. There is no ratings <b>data</b> <b>available</b> for the BBC Three broadcast. On the BBC One broadcast, the episode was seen by 5.2 million viewers, an improvement of 140,000 from the previous episode, with a 21.6 per cent audience share, winning its time slot against the return of detective series Taggart on ITV1, and other terrestrial channels. According to the Broadcasters' Audience Research Board, the episode received final viewing figures of 5.59 million, making the episode the 17th most seen broadcast on BBC One, and 32nd in overall television the week it was shown.|$|E

5|$|There is no census <b>data</b> <b>available</b> on {{demographic}} {{history or}} trends for Shaktism or other traditions within Hinduism. Estimates vary {{on the relative}} number of adherents in Shaktism compared to other traditions of Hinduism. According to a 2010 estimate by Johnson and Grim, the Shaktism tradition is the smaller group with about 30 million or 3.2% of Hindus. In contrast, Galvin Flood states that Shaivism and Shaktism traditions are difficult to separate, as many Shaiva Hindus revere the goddess Shakti regularly. The denominations of Hinduism, states Julius Lipner, are unlike those found in major religions of the world, because Hindu denominations are fuzzy with individuals revering gods and goddesses henotheistically, with many Shaiva and Vaishnava adherents recognizing Sri (Lakshmi), Parvati, Saraswati {{and other aspects of}} the goddess Devi. Similarly, Shakta Hindus revere Shiva and goddesses such as Parvati (such as Durga, Radha, Sita and others) and Saraswati important in Shaiva and Vaishnava traditions.|$|E
5|$|There {{is no one}} way to do Archaeoastronomy. The {{divisions}} between archaeoastronomers tend not to be between the physical scientists and the social scientists. Instead it tends to depend on the location of kind of <b>data</b> <b>available</b> to the researcher. In the Old World, there is little data but the sites themselves; in the New World, the sites were supplemented by ethnographic and historic data. The effects of the isolated development of archaeoastronomy in different places can still often be seen in research today. Research methods can be classified as falling into one of two approaches, though more recent projects often use techniques from both categories.|$|E
5|$|Traffic is {{regularly}} counted {{by means of}} a traffic census at toll stations and reported by Hrvatske autoceste. The reported traffic volume gradually decreases as the motorway chainage increases and as it passes by various major destinations and the interchanges that serve them. Thus the greatest volume of traffic is registered along Zagreb bypass, especially the JankomirLučko section, with 41,549vehicle annual average daily traffic (AADT). The busiest tolled section of the motorway is Ivanja RekaRugvica with 27,049AADT and 34,543vehicle average summer daily traffic (ASDT) figures. The traffic volume gradually decreases from that section eastward to the eastern terminus of the motorway, where the lowest AADT and ASDT figures are recorded. The traffic volume decrease is somewhat more pronounced at interchanges serving Slavonski Brod and the A5 motorway (Sredanci). The seasonal traffic volume variation ranges from a 28% increase on the busiest, Ivanja RekaRugvica, section to a 75% volume increase, as measured on the ŽupanjaSpačva section. Average summer season traffic volume increase on the motorway is 55%. The AADT/ASDT ratio analysis does not include Zagreb bypass, as there are no ASDT <b>data</b> <b>available</b> for the bypass.|$|E
