5|$|Doxorubicin is {{commonly}} used to treat some leukemias and Hodgkin's lymphoma, as well as cancers of the bladder, breast, stomach, lung, ovaries, thyroid, soft tissue sarcoma, multiple myeloma, and others. Commonly used doxorubicin-containing regimens are AC (adriamycin, cyclophosphamide), TAC (taxotere, AC), ABVD (Adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, <b>dacarbazine),</b> BEACOPP, CHOP (cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) and FAC (5-fluorouracil, adriamycin, cyclophosphamide).|$|E
25|$|Various {{chemotherapy}} agents, including temozolomide, <b>dacarbazine</b> (also termed DTIC), immunotherapy (with interleukin-2 (IL-2) or interferon (IFN)), as well {{as local}} perfusion, are used by different centers. The overall success in metastatic melanoma is quite limited.|$|E
25|$|In June 2011, a {{clinical}} trial of ipilimumab plus <b>dacarbazine</b> combined this immune system booster with the standard chemotherapy drug that targets cell division. It showed an increase in median survival for these late stage patients to 11 months instead of the 9 months normally seen. Researchers were also hopeful that perhaps 10â€“20% of patients could live a long time. Some serious side-effects of revving up the immune system were seen in some patients. A course of treatment costs $120,000. The drug's brandname is Yervoy.|$|E
25|$|The subtypes of alkylating {{agents are}} the {{nitrogen}} mustards, nitrosoureas, tetrazines, aziridines, cisplatins and derivatives, and non-classical alkylating agents. Nitrogen mustards include mechlorethamine, cyclophosphamide, melphalan, chlorambucil, ifosfamide and busulfan. Nitrosoureas include N-Nitroso-N-methylurea (MNU), carmustine (BCNU), lomustine (CCNU) and semustine (MeCCNU), fotemustine and streptozotocin. Tetrazines include <b>dacarbazine,</b> mitozolomide and temozolomide. Aziridines include thiotepa, mytomycin and diaziquone (AZQ). Cisplatin and derivatives include cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin. They impair cell function by forming covalent bonds with the amino, carboxyl, sulfhydryl, and phosphate groups in biologically important molecules. Non-classical alkylating agents include procarbazine and hexamethylmelamine.|$|E
5000|$|Some sources {{explicitly}} {{exclude the}} triazenes (<b>dacarbazine,</b> mitozolomide, temozolomide) from the nonclassical category. However, other sources list <b>dacarbazine</b> as nonclassical, and some include temozolomide.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dacarbazine</b> was {{developed}} by Y. Fulmer Shealy, PhD at Southern Research Institute in Birmingham, Alabama. Research was funded by a U.S. federal grant. <b>Dacarbazine</b> gained FDA approval in May 1975 as DTIC-Dome. The drug was initially marketed by Bayer.|$|E

50|$|Temozolomide is a prodrug and an imidazotetrazine {{derivative}} of the alkylating agent <b>dacarbazine.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dacarbazine</b> is bioactivated in liver by {{demethylation}} to [...] "MTIC" [...] {{and then}} to diazomethane, which is an alkylating agent.|$|E
50|$|As of mid-2006, <b>dacarbazine</b> is {{commonly}} used as a single agent {{in the treatment of}} metastatic melanoma, and as part of the ABVD chemotherapy regimen to treat Hodgkin's lymphoma, and in the MAID regimen for sarcoma. <b>Dacarbazine</b> was proven to be just as efficacious as procarbazine in the German trial for paediatric Hodgkin's lymphoma, without the teratogenic effects. Thus COPDAC has replaced the former COPP regime in children for TG2 & 3 following OEPA.|$|E
50|$|A phase III trial (vs <b>dacarbazine)</b> in {{patients}} with previously untreated metastatic melanoma showed an improved rates of overall and progression-free survival.|$|E
50|$|Bayer {{continues}} to supply DTIC-Dome. There are also generic versions of <b>dacarbazine</b> available from APP, Bedford, Mayne Pharma (now Hospira) and Teva.|$|E
50|$|The Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare {{has sent}} out a black box warning and {{suggests}} avoiding <b>dacarbazine</b> due to liver problems.|$|E
50|$|Treatment is by {{chemotherapy}} with streptozocin, <b>dacarbazine,</b> doxorubicin or by 'watchful waiting' {{and surgical}} debulking via Whipple procedure and other resections of the gastrointestinal organs affected.|$|E
50|$|The ECHELON-1 phase 3 trial {{compared}} brentuximab vedotin with bleomycin both {{in combination}} with adriamycin, vinblastine, <b>dacarbazine</b> (AVD) chemotherapy as a firstline treatment for advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma.|$|E
50|$|Like many {{chemotherapy}} drugs, <b>dacarbazine</b> {{may have}} numerous serious side effects, because it interferes with normal cell growth {{as well as}} cancer cell growth. Among the most serious possible side effects are birth defects to children conceived or carried during treatment; sterility, possibly permanent; or immune suppression (reduced ability to fight infection or disease). <b>Dacarbazine</b> {{is considered to be}} highly emetogenic, and most patients will be pre-medicated with dexamethasone and antiemetic drugs like 5-HT3 antagonist (e.g., ondansetron) and/or NK1 receptor antagonist (e.g., aprepitant). Other significant side effects include headache, fatigue and occasionally diarrhea.|$|E

50|$|In 2015 (after phase III study {{comparing}} with <b>dacarbazine)</b> the US FDA approved trabectedin (Yondelis) for {{the treatment}} of liposarcoma and leiomyosarcoma that is either unresectable or has metastasized. Patients must have received prior chemotherapy with an anthracycline.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dacarbazine</b> (DTIC), {{also known}} as {{imidazole}} carboxamide, is a chemotherapy medication used {{in the treatment of}} melanoma and Hodgkin's lymphoma. For Hodgkin's it is often used together with vinblastine, bleomycin, and doxorubicin. It is given by injection into a vein.|$|E
50|$|Melanoma of {{the skin}} and eye, {{together}} with <b>dacarbazine</b> and interferon-alpha in combination chemotherapy. During preclinical trials it also shown some potential promise (in combination chemotherapy with cisplatin and gemcitabine or with cisplatin and irinotecan) for experimental non-squamous cell lung cancer.|$|E
50|$|Some {{anti-cancer}} medications {{are called}} triazenes because they contain a triazene functional group. The triazenes are {{a group of}} alkylating agents used to treat cancer. Examples include <b>dacarbazine</b> and temozolamide. They work by methylating guanine at the O-6 and N-7 position.|$|E

Clockwise from center: bleomycin, an antitumor antibiotic; vincristine, a spindle poison; <b>dacarbazine,</b> an alkylating agent; cyclophosphamide, a nitrogen mustard; doxorubicin, an anthracycline; and etoposide, a topoisomerase inhibitor.|$|E
5000|$|A phase III trial {{funded by}} Millennium Pharmaceuticals has the {{objective}} of comparing ABVD (a combination of the chemotherapy drugs doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and <b>dacarbazine)</b> versus brentuximab vedotin in combination with AVD (doxorubicin, vinblastine, and <b>dacarbazine)</b> for treatment of classical Hodgkin lymphoma is ongoing. A previously completed phase I study demonstrated that {{a greater number of}} patients experienced pulmonary toxicity with brentuximab vedotin-ABVD than with ABVD alone. Pulmonary fibrosis is a classical adverse effect of bleomycin; however, the incidence of pulmonary fibrosis in the brentuximab vedotin-ABVD arm was higher than the expected historical rate with ABVD alone. Overall, 24 out of 25 patients treated with brentuximab vedotin and AVD achieved complete remission but further studies are required to find progression-free survival time and measure the effectiveness of this new combination therapy.|$|E
50|$|Common {{side effects}} include loss of appetite, vomiting, low {{white blood cell}} count, and low platelets. Other serious side effects include liver {{problems}} and allergic reactions. It is unclear if use in pregnancy is safe for the baby. <b>Dacarbazine</b> is in the alkylating agent and purine analog families of medication.|$|E
50|$|In December 2015, {{the company}} {{announced}} that the mutant-NRAS melanoma trial was successful. In the trial, those receiving binimetinib had a median progression-free survival of 2.8 months versus 1.5 months for those on the standard <b>dacarbazine</b> treatment. NDA submitted Jun 2016, and the FDA should decide by 30 June 2017.|$|E
50|$|In July 2015 selumetinib failed a Phase III trial testing {{whether the}} drug {{significantly}} prolonged {{the survival of}} patients in a study on melanoma originating in the eye. In the 152-patient trial, a combination of selumetinib and <b>dacarbazine</b> failed to improve progression-free survival compared with just the old drug alone.|$|E
50|$|On January 28, 2016 the US FDA {{approved}} Halaven for {{the treatment}} of inoperable liposarcoma in patients who received prior chemotherapy that contained an anthracycline drug. A phase III trial reported: With Halaven the median overall survival for patients with liposarcoma was 15.6 months, compared to 8.4 months for patients treated with <b>dacarbazine.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Dacarbazine</b> {{works by}} methylating guanine at the O-6 and N-7 positions. Guanine {{is one of}} the four {{nucleotides}} that makes up DNA. The alkylated DNA strands stick together such that cell division becomes impossible. This affects cancer cells more than healthy cells because cancer cells divide faster. Unfortunately however, some of the healthy cells will still be damaged.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dacarbazine</b> was {{approved}} {{for medical use}} in the United States in 1975. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about 7.45 to 18.24 USD per 200 mg vial. In the United Kingdom this dose costs the NHS about 7.50 pounds.|$|E
50|$|Often, {{the patient}} {{is known to have}} a {{tendency}} towards thrombosis, although Budd-Chiari syndrome can also be the first symptom of such a tendency. Examples of genetic tendencies include protein C deficiency, protein S deficiency, the Factor V Leiden mutation, hereditary anti-thrombin deficiency and prothrombin mutation G20210A. An important non-genetic risk factor is the use of estrogen-containing (combined) forms of hormonal contraception. Other risk factors include the antiphospholipid syndrome, aspergillosis, BehÃ§et's disease, <b>dacarbazine,</b> pregnancy, and trauma.|$|E
50|$|Fotemustine is a {{nitrosourea}} {{alkylating agent}} approved {{for use in}} the treatment of metastasising melanoma. A study has shown that fotemustine produces improved response rates and but does not increase survival (over <b>dacarbazine</b> in the treatment of disseminated cutaneous melanoma. Median survival was 7.3 months with fotemustine versus 5.6 months with DTIC (P=.067). There was also toxicity prevalence in fotemustine arm. The main toxicity was grade 3 to 4 neutropenia (51% with fotemustine v 5% with DTIC) and thrombocytopenia (43% v 6%, respectively).|$|E

50|$|Adjuvant {{chemotherapy}} {{has been}} used in malignant melanoma, but there is little hard evidence to use chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting. However, melanoma is not a chemotherapy-resistant malignancy. <b>Dacarbazine,</b> temozolomide, and cisplatin all have a reproducible 10-20% response rate in metastatic melanoma.; however, these responses are often short-lived and almost never complete. Multiple studies have shown that adjuvant radiotherapy improves local recurrence rates in high-risk melanoma patients. The studies include at least two M.D. Anderson cancer center studies. However, none of the studies showed that adjuvant radiotherapy had a statistically significant survival benefit.|$|E
