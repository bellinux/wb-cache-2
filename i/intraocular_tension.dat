40|$|Introduction. Penetrated {{injuries}} are most difficult injuries of the eye. Intraocular foreign body (IOFB) may lodge {{in any of}} the structures it encounters, from anterior chamber to the retina and choroid. Notable effects caused by foreign body injury include traumatic cataract, vitreous liquefaction, retinal and subretinal hemorrhages, retinal detachment and development of endophtalmitis. Case Outline. A 49 ­year­old man sustained injury of the right eye with a piece of metal wire. On admission visual acuity was VOD: 1. 0 and lower <b>intraocular</b> <b>tension</b> TOD= 6 mmHg (10 ­ 22 mmHg). Corneal entry wound was noticed near limb on 11 h with a prominating foreign body of 18 mm in length that passed through the iris, lens and vitreous. X­ray findings confirmed existence of a large foreign body extending along {{the entire length of the}} globe. IOFB removal was done with anatomic forceps. On postoperative detailed clinical examination we observed retinal rupture in the upper temporal quadrant fitting in the area of the IOFB damaged retina. Laser photocoagulation of retinal tear (laser retinal barrage) was done. Visual acuity on discharge was the same (1. 0) and <b>intraocular</b> <b>tension</b> was within normal limits (10 mmHg). Conclusion. Penetrated injury of eye requires detailed examination of all eye structures, beginning from the anterior to posterior segment. Timely diagnosed ruptures of the posterior segment of eye before the development of traumatic cataract, and adequate therapeutic procedures prevent serious complications of IOFB penetrated eye injury such as retinal detachment and permanent reduction of visual acuity...|$|E

40|$|Primary empty sella is {{frequently}} seen in middle-aged women. It is widely accepted {{that patients with}} this disease are indicated for surgical treatment if their visual field or acuity has been disturbed.

In two cases of this disease with a chief complaint of frequent headaches in the early morning, we recently performed extradural intrasellar plugging (Guiot's technique) via transsphenoidal approach. The results of this operation were excellent with complete disappearance of headaches. The conclusions may be summarized as follows : 1) Extradural intrasellar plugging is recommended in cases of progressive headaches especially early in the morning. 2) A tendency to headache early in the morning is thought to be due to physiological intracranial hypertension in REM sleep. 3) Before surgery, differential diagnosis of this condition from glaucoma or migraine should be made by confirming that the <b>intraocular</b> <b>tension</b> is mormal and that headache is not relieved by flunarizine therapy...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} latanoprost versus timolol for primary open angle glaucoma(POAG) and ocular hypertension(OHT). METHODS: This was an evidence-based medicine science study. Pertinent studies of randomized controlled trial(RCT) were identified through searches of PubMed, Medline, CNKI and China Biology Medicine disc. The intensive searching by hand and internet was also designed. According to inclusion and exclusion criteria, the study object was limited. Quality of literatures were evaluated by experienced researchers according to the Jadad Score.

40|$|Introduction. An intraocular {{foreign body}} may traumatize the eye mechanically, {{introduce}} infection or exert other toxic {{effects on the}} intraocular structures. Removal of a metallic intraocular foreign bodies (IOFB) use an internal (vitrectomy followed by forceps or internal magnet use) or external approach (large electromagnet). Outline of Cases. A 51 -year-old man sustained injury of the left eye by a metal foreign body. On admission visual acuity was normal (VOS= 1. 0) and <b>intraocular</b> <b>tension</b> was within normal limits (TOS= 10 mmHg). Nasal scleral entry wound was noticed. Ultrasound of the left eye was done, which confirmed existence of IOFB laying nasally, next to the ciliary body. Extraction of IOFB with a big electric magnet was done. Visual acuity on discharge was the same (VOS= 1. 0). Another man, aged 30 years, came to the clinic after injury of the left eye by a foreign body. On admission visual acuity was VOS=L+P+ (light and projection), TOS= 44 mmHg (higher), traumatic cataract, scleral entry wound, corneal edema, existence of IOFB and initial endophtalmitis. Lensectomia and vitrectomia via pars plana with IOFB extraction were done. Visual acuity on discharge was VOS= 5 / 60 with + 6. 50 Dsph = 0. 3 - 0. 4; TOS= 17 mmHg. Conclusion. Magnet removal is indicated in patients when IOFB is laying free in the vitreous body or stopped near the entry wound during injury without other complications. Internal approach - pars plana vitrectomy with forceps removal is used when IOFB is stuck either on the peripheral or posterior part of the retina or if {{there are some of}} aforementioned complications...|$|E
40|$|This {{meeting had}} as its theme the {{importance}} of good communications between workers in different disciplines. Papers and demonstrations were presented {{on a range of}} topics as apparently unrelated as the <b>intraocular</b> pressure, the <b>tension</b> of nitrogen in blood, and the experimental production of mesothelial tumours. In his introduction Dr J C Gilson showed how these were some recent end-products of research into pneumoconiosis. The work of the Pneumoconiosis Research Unit was centred round the properties of airborne dust and the acute and long-term effects of its inhalation. Studies ranged from the immunological responses of coal workers to surveys of men in some of the world's major asbestos fields; the latter were selected on account of the exposure to dust differing from that of workers in the UK in being confined to a single type of fibre. One link between the different studies was the features of the chest radiographs. For rounded opacities these were now read using the ILO Classification which was largely developed at the Unit; Dr Gilson demonstrated a recent extension to include the irregular opacities which are associated with exposure to asbestos...|$|R
40|$|AIM—To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} acute changes in intraocular pressure on the oxygen tension {{in the vicinity of}} the optic nerve head under control conditions and after intravenous administration of 500  mg of the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor dorzolamide.  METHODS—Domestic pigs were used as experimental animals. Oxygen tension was measured by means of a polarographic electrode in the vitreous 0. 5  mm anterior to the optic disc. This entity is called the optic nerve oxygen <b>tension.</b> <b>Intraocular</b> pressure was controlled by a hypodermic needle inserted into the anterior chamber and connected to a saline reservoir.  RESULTS—When the intraocular pressure was clamped at 20  cm H 2 O optic nerve oxygen tension was 20  (5)  mm Hg (n= 8). Intravenous administration of dorzolamide caused an increase in optic nerve oxygen tension of 43  (8) % (n= 6). Both before and after administration of dorzolamide optic nerve oxygen tension was unaffected by changes in intraocular pressure, as long as this pressure remained below 60  cm H 2 O. At intraocular pressures of 60  cm H 2 O and below, dorzolamide significantly increased optic nerve oxygen tension.  CONCLUSION—Intravenous administration of 500  mg dorzolamide increases the oxygen tension at the optic nerve head during acute increases in intraocular pressure. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurposeTo {{determine}} whether the combination of topical, intracameral and facial nerve blocks would produce adequate analgesia for repair of open globe injuries without increasing <b>intraocular</b> <b>tension.</b> MethodsA comparison of combined O’Brien’s block (facial nerve block), topical ropivacaine and intracameral lignocaine versus peribulbar block in 100 randomly selected cases of traumatic corneal rupture. Patients were randomly divided in two groups of 50 each based on those receiving the combined approach (Group T) and those undergoing peribulbar block (Group P). Patients were excluded if there was rupture with significant scleral extension, the interval between trauma and presentation greater than 2 h, presence of hypopyon, rupture with significant corneal oedema, expulsion of intraocular contents with a collapsed globe and monocular cases. The effect of the anaesthetic was compared by patient comfort and surgeon comfort, the incidence of vitreous prolapse and the requirement of incremental sedation. The Student’s “t” test, the “Z” test, and Chi Square tests were used where appropriate. P 0. 05). The average surgeon comfort and patient comfort between groups were similar (P> 0. 05, both comparisons). Incremental sedation was required in 16 % of patients in Group T compared to 8 % in Group P (P= 0. 218363). The total sedation dosage required for each group was similar. The incidence of vitreous prolapse was statistically significantly higher by 14 % in Group P compared to Group T (P= 0. 03731). ConclusionsOur combined technique proved as efficacious as peribulbar block in providing adequate local anaesthesia and reducing the incidence of vitreous prolapse. We recommend greater use of this technique for repair of open globe injuries especially in locations where full time anaesthesia services are not available...|$|E
40|$|Endothelin- 1 (ET- 1), {{a potent}} {{vasoconstrictor}} peptide, {{is involved in}} several functions of eye pathophysiology, such as regulation of <b>intraocular</b> <b>tension</b> and retinal reactive vasoconstriction. As ET- 1 pro-inflammatory and fibrosing activity is emerging in different fields of pathology, we investigated the expression of ET- 1 and endothelin-converting enzyme- 1 (ECE- 1) in chalazia, granulomatous lesions of the eyelid. ET- 1 and ECE- 1 were analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in twenty surgically removed chalazia, with regard to expression in eyelid structures and inflammatory infiltrate. Phenotype of ET- 1 expressing inflammatory cells was established by double immunofluorescence. The cellular localization of prepro-ET- 1 (pp-ET- 1) mRNA and ECE- 1 mRNA was studied by nonisotopic in situ hybridization (ISH). Neutrophils (PMNs), macrophages and T-lymphocytes were scattered in stroma, around alveoli and grouped in lipogranulomas. PMNs, macrophages, basal epithelium of meibomian adenomers and central ducts immunostained for ET- 1. ECE- 1 protein was found in meibomian adenomers, conjunctival epithelium, tarsal mucous glands and in inflammatory cells. Hybridization signals for pp-ET- 1 mRNA and ECE- 1 mRNA were recognized in healthy and degenerating meibomian ducts, adenomers, inflammatory cells, {{as well as in}} vessel walls. ECE- 1 mRNA was also present in conjunctival epithelium and Henle's crypts. Our findings suggest that the multifunctional peptide ET- 1 may have a role in molecular genesis of tissue damage in chalazia. ET- 1 cytokine activity is likely to support the migration of inflammatory cells and the setting of lipogranulomas; ET- 1 stimulation might contribute to proliferation of fibroblasts and collagen synthesis. ET- 1 upregulation on meibomian adenomers and ducts may further enhance granulomas formation by stimulating lipid release...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY The first {{cases of}} pseudoexfoliation {{of the lens}} {{to be found in}} Australian Aborigines are reported. The {{prevalence}} rate in the communities in central Australia is 1 - 3 % and for those 61 years and older is 16 - 3 %. Within the limits of our assessment glaucoma was an associated finding in 8 * 1 % of these cases. A high incidence of old trachoma, previous trauma, and Labrador kerato-pathy was also noted in these people. Pseudoexfoliation of the lens (PXF) is a degenera-tive ocular condition, characterised by the deposition of a fluffy white material on the anterior lens capsule and on the surfaces of the anterior chamber, especially the pupil margin. It is often associated with the dispersion of pigment granules on the corneal endothelium and the trabecular meshwork, and with chronic open-angle glaucoma. The incidence of PXF has been found to vary greatly in different races and different geographical areas (Duke-Elder, 1969; Aasved, 1969). This paper reports the first documented cases of PXF among Australian Aborigines, and presents the prevalence rate for this condition as it occurs in central Australia. The patients were identified during examinations undertaken by the National Trachoma and Eye Health Programme, which is assessing the ocular status of Aboriginal com-munities. Materials and methods A routine ocular examination under field conditions was performed on most members of Aboriginal communities in northern South Australia (see map). Visual acuity was assessed, and anterior segment examination for trachoma grading was made, using a x 3 loupe. If ocular disease was identified, the patient was examined on the slit lamp and ophthalmoscopy was done. <b>Intraocular</b> <b>tension</b> was measured by Goldmann applanation tonometr...|$|E
40|$|Background: The German {{statutory}} {{health insurance}} (GKV) reimburses all {{health care services}} that are deemed sufficient, appropriate, and efficient. According to the German Medical Association (BÄK), individual health services (IGeL) are services that are not under liability of the GKV, medically necessary or recommendable or at least justifiable. They have to be explicitly requested by the patient {{and have to be}} paid out of pocket. Research questions: The following questions regarding IGeL in the outpatient health care of GKV insurants are addressed in the present report: What is the empirical evidence regarding offers, utilization, practice, acceptance, and the relation between physician and patient, as well as the economic relevance of IGeL? What ethical, social, and legal aspects are related to IGeL? For two of the most common IGeL, the screening for glaucoma and the screening for ovarian and endometrial cancer by vaginal ultrasound (VUS), the following questions are addressed: What is the evidence for the clinical effectiveness? Are there sub-populations for whom screening might be beneficial? Methods: The evaluation is divided into two parts. For the first part a systematic literature review of primary studies and publications concerning ethical, social and legal aspects is performed. In the second part, rapid assessments of the clinical effectiveness for the two examples, glaucoma and VUS screening, are prepared. Therefore, in a first step, HTA-reports and systematic reviews are searched, followed by a search for original studies published {{after the end of the}} research period of the most recent HTA-report included. Results: 29 studies were included for the first question. Between 19 and 53 % of GKV members receive IGeL offers, of which three-quarters are realised. 16 to 19 % of the insurants ask actively for IGeL. <b>Intraocular</b> <b>tension</b> measurement is the most common single IGeL service, accounting for up to 40 % of the offers. It is followed by ultrasound assessments with up to 25 % of the offers. Cancer screening and blood or laboratory services are also frequent and represent a major proportion of the demand. The ethical, social, and legal aspects discussed in the context of IGeL concern eight subject areas: 1. autonomous patient decisions versus obtrusion, 2. commercialization of medicine, 3. duty of patient information, 4. benefit, evidence, and (quality) control, 5. role and relation of physicians and patients, 6. relation to the GKV, 7. social inequality, 8. formally correct performance. For glaucoma screening, no randomized controlled trial (RCT) is identified that shows a patient relevant benefit. For VUS three RCT are included. However, they do not yet present mortality data concerning screened and non-screened persons. VUS screening shows a high degree of over-diagnosis in turn leading to invasive interventions. To diagnose one invasive carcinoma, 30 to 35 surgical procedures are necessary. Conclusion: IGeL are a relevant factor in the German statutory health care system. To provide more transparency, the requests for evidence-based and independent patient information should be considered. Whether official positive and negative-lists could be an appropriate instrument to give guidance to patients and physicians, should be examined. Generally, IGeL must be seen in the broader context of the discussions about the future design and development of the German health care system...|$|E
