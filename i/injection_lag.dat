40|$|Rate-of-{{discharge}} curves {{that show}} the discharge characteristics of an injection system having a very short fuel passage are presented. The rate of discharge closely follows the rate of displacement of the injection-pump plunger for open nozzles in which the maximum calculated pressures at the orifice do not exceed a certain value, which {{is dependent on the}} particular injection pump. With small orifices and high pump speeds, the rate of discharge does not follow the rate of plunger displacement because the higher discharge pressure results in increased leakage with corresponding decrease in discharge rate. The rate of discharge is not directly related to the rate of plunger displacement with automatic injection valves having closed nozzles. The types of pump check valve tested did not control the rate of cut-off or the discharge rate but they did affect the <b>injection</b> <b>lag.</b> Use of the short fuel passage eliminated the formation of secondary discharges...|$|E
40|$|Assessment of <b>injection</b> <b>lag</b> {{transport}} and uniformity of direct injection boom sprayer {{is an important}} issue for successful variable rate spraying technology. To estimate the boom lag {{transport and}} pressure loss, a numerical model is formulated on the basis of fluid hydrodynamic conservation equations. The software is implemented in visual basic. To solve the pressure â€“ velocities equations, control volume finite element method (CV) is used to delimit elementary volumes of the boom. Linearization of the conservation laws is ensured by considering discrete form of the equations and calculating velocity and pressure step by step throughout the whole boom. The flow behaviour is simulated into a boom section divided into N elementary volumes, each of them including one nozzle. To test the model, three boom diameters (5, 6 and 8 mm) and two chemical viscosities (10 - 6 and 10 - 5 m 2 /s) were used. Experimental trials are carried out on boom having 2. 5 m length (5 nozzles) for measuring pressure gradient and lag transport. Results showed that the model can predict the pressure losses and the lag transport accurately (error within 5 %) to optimize boom designs...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} common rail system's {{injection}} timing and rail pressure on high-power diesel's fuel economy and emission characteristics {{has been studied}} through tests. The experimental results show that with the rail pressure increasing, fuel economy and smoke are improving, while NOx is deteriorating. However, as rail pressure very high, the improving trends of smoke and fuel economy are not obvious terribly, and even at low load condition, the economy will decline instead. With injection timing delayed, NOx is reducing while smoke and fuel economy are augmenting at the conditions of high load. However, at the low load conditions, with <b>injection</b> timing <b>lagging,</b> smoke and NOx will decline simultaneously...|$|R
40|$|Carbon {{capture and}} storage (CCS) -Capturing CO 2 {{released}} from industrial sources and storing it underground in deep geological layers- {{is a top}} priority to contribute significantly to the reduction of atmospheric {{emissions of greenhouse gases}} [1]. Basically, by storing CO 2 underground, the carbon released through oil, gas and coal is returned back to where it was originated. This allows us to continue fossil fuel supply by the current consumption rate for decades. Among all CO 2 storage sites in the world, Sleipner field is selected as the candidate storage site for this study. This is because of availability of both seismic data and well measurements such as pressure and injection rate. In addition, the Sleipner reservoir pressure and temperature are not far from the critical point and the effects of a designed injected stream can be observed with small variations in injection parameters. Existing compositional models for the Utsira formation where the CO 2 is currently injected for the purpose of storage will be used to simulate the mentioned techniques. Providing the safe and long term storage requires the ability to combine reservoir characterization, monitoring technology, smart wells and innovative flooding techniques in cross-disciplinary reservoir management projects [2]. The {{purpose of this study is}} to apply the reservoir management techniques that are implemented in production of oil and gas reserves to the practice of CO 2 storage in saline aquifers. We propose a new <b>injection</b> strategy called <b>LAG</b> <b>injection</b> inspired from WAG injection that distribute CO 2 plume distribution equally through the aquifer and consequently improve storage capacity and sweep efficiency. Combination of this new injection pattern with different well configurations, different cyclic alternating injection time, and simultaneous <b>LAG</b> <b>injection</b> can enhance storage capacity dramatically. The best cases show considerable increment of 81 % in storage capacity and 70 % in sweep efficiency dramatically. </p...|$|R
5000|$|This engine uses Toyota's D-4D Common Rail fuel {{injection}} technology operating at ultra high pressures {{of up to}} 135 mpa (1350 bar or about 19,580 psi) which is about 8 {{times more than the}} pressure of conventional {{fuel injection}} systems within a [...] "common rail" [...] that feeds the injectors on all four cylinders. This is combined with a 32-bit ECU which controls fuel quantity, valve-timing, and boost pressure at different engine parameters resulting in best fuel economy and also full utilization of power during acceleration. Pilot injection is also utilized by the common rail fuel system to smooth engine operation. Small amounts of fuel are introduced into the combustion chamber prior to the main <b>injection</b> event, reducing <b>lag</b> time and promoting more continuous and complete combustion. Exterior and interior engine noise is also reduced.|$|R
40|$|The i. v. and i. m. dose {{pharmacokinetics}} of ceftazidime 1 g b. i. d. {{were investigated}} in steady state in 52 consecutive cases of hospitalised patients with underlying diseases and serious supervening bacterial infections. Following i. v. bolus injection, serum concentrations of greater than 4 mg/l persisted for 8 h in all patients. Compared to values found in younger patients studied previously, clearance was markedly reduced in the elderly, t 1 / 2 beta more than doubled, the area under the curve four times enlarged and the apparent volume of distribution reduced. The values obtained in serum after i. m. injection were similar, though the peak concentration was delayed by about 2 h. The serum uptake was approximately 70 %, and serum concentration {{was greater than}} 4 mg/l for 8 h. The concentrations in tissue fluid after i. v. administration {{were similar to those}} in serum, but the penetration into tissue fluid was slower and only 20 % of that reported previously for young people. The elimination was slow, with greater than 4 mg/l maintained for 7 h. Tissue concentrations after i. m. injection were almost comparable with those after i. v. <b>injection,</b> but <b>lagged</b> behind by about 1 h. In conclusion, suitable concentrations in blood and tissue are attained with 1 g ceftazidime b. i. d., whether administered by the i. v. or i. m. route...|$|R
40|$|Earlier {{systems for}} direct {{injection}} of {{plant protection products}} (PPP) did not satisfy the requirements of practical farming because of time lag between dosing of PPP and its application and because of cleaning problems. To offer solutions in this respect, a prototype field sprayer with direct injection for site-specific application was conceived, constructed and tested. This prototype has three separate nozzle lines, {{each with its own}} direct injection unit capable of preloading with individual spray mixture so that no time lag occurs in application. Calculated were the theoretically achievable working widths possible with the applied direct injection dosing pumps. Test stand measurements were carried out to determine dosing precision. The results show that good dosing precision is achieved in the different settings. Hereby, attention should be paid to the working range of the dosing pumps. The results show that practically-applicable systems for direct <b>injection</b> without time <b>lag</b> based on the developed prototype are possible offering the ability to apply PPP more precisely and site-specifically...|$|R
40|$|Background Ocular {{manifestations of}} thyroid {{dysfunction}} constitute a wide clinical spectrum ranging from minor ocular discomfort, lid retraction, lid <b>lag</b> and ocular <b>injection,</b> to sight threatening eyeball protusion and optic nerve compression. Thyroid-related eye disorders are most {{commonly associated with}} Graves' disease, and this most frequently occurs {{in the setting of}} hyperthyroidism. However, in 10 % of cases, typical eye signs have also been reported in euthyroid and hypothyroid states. The severity of thyroid eye disease has been linked to cigarette smoking. There is very little data specifically reporting the ocular manifestations of thyroid disease among black African patients and there is no known report from Nigeria. This pilot study therefore focused on documenting the ocular signs accompanying thyroid dysfunction in a black African population. Aim To evaluate the pattern of ocular complications, among patients treated for thyroid disorders, in a major Nigerian teaching hospital. Results A total of 75 patients with thyroid dysfunction, were evaluated, comprising 63 females and 12 males. There was a very low prevalence of smoking among patients (< 5 %). Graves' disease was the commonest thyroid disorder, representing 70 % of cases. Seventy-eight percent of patients were hyperthyroid, 11. 8 % were euthyroid and only 9. 8 % of patients were hypothyroid. Commonest systemic symptoms were neck swelling (68. 6 %), weight loss (63. 8 %), tremors (60. 9 %) and palpitations (59. 4 %). Two-thirds of patients reported ocular symptoms consisting mainly of painless eye swelling (66. 7 %) and ocular irritation (58 %). Conjunctival <b>injection,</b> lid <b>lag</b> and lid retraction were the commonest ocular signs. Chemosis, severe proptosis and ocular motility disorder were very rare. Optic neuropathy was found in 4 patients but was related to pre-existing glaucoma. Majority of patients required only ocular emollients and tear supplements. Conclusion Severe ocular complications of thyroid disorders were uncommon in this cross-section of Nigerian patients. This may be linked to the very low prevalence of cigarette smoking among Nigerians or genetic and environmental factors linked to their African heritage...|$|R
5000|$|... "We {{provide the}} first {{characterization}} of myonectin, with in vitro and in vivo {{evidence that it}} is a novel myokine with important metabolic function. Unlike the other CTRPs characterized to date, myonectin (CTRP15) is expressed and secreted predominantly by skeletal muscle.... (Our) results suggest that myonectin is a nutrient-responsive metabolic regulator secreted by skeletal muscle in response to changes in cellular energy state resulting from glucose or fatty acid fluxes. Many metabolically relevant secreted proteins (e.g. adiponectin, leptin, resistin, and RBP) and the signaling pathways they regulate in tissues are known to be dysregulated in the condition of obesity. The reduction in expression and circulating levels of myonectin in the obese state may represent yet another component of the complex metabolic circuitry dysregulated by excess caloric intake. Although exercise has long been known to have profound positive impacts on systemic insulin sensitivity and energy balance, the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. That voluntary exercise dramatically increases the expression and circulating levels of myonectin to promote fatty acid uptake into cells may underlie one of the beneficial effects of physical exercise.... A modest rise in the circulating levels of myonectin resulting from recombinant protein administration is sufficient to lower serum NEFA without altering serum triglyceride levels. Unlike CTRP1, CTRP3 and CTRP12, injection of recombinant myonectin into mice appears to have no glucose-lowering effect. Reduction in circulating NEFA is not due to suppression of adipose tissue lipolysis; rather, it results from increased fatty acid uptake by adipocytes and hepatocytes. Although the myonectin-mediated enhancement of lipid uptake in vitro appears modest (25-50%), in fact, the magnitude of this effect is comparable with cells stimulated with 50 nM insulin, a saturating dose that leads to maximum increase in fatty acid uptake.... In accordance with myonectin mediating its metabolic effect through a transcriptional mechanism, a reduction in circulating NEFA in mice occurred only 2 h after recombinant protein <b>injection,</b> a <b>lag</b> period presumably required for mRNA and protein synthesis." ...|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{consequences}} ofintroducing human recombinant transforming growth factor 01 (hrTGF-i 61) into synovial tissue of the rat, to begin {{to better understand the}} significance of the fact that biologically active TGF- 0 is found in human arthritic synovial effusions. Within 4 - 6 h after the intra-articular <b>injection</b> of 1 <b>lAg</b> ofhrTGF-f 31 into rat kneejoints, extensive recruitment of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) was observed. Cytochemistry and high resolution histological techniques were used to quantitate the influx of PMNs, which peaked 6 h postinjection. In a Boyden chamber assay, hrTGF-/ 31 at 1 - 10 fg/ml elicited a chemotactic response from PMNs greater in magnitude than that evoked by FMLP, establishing that TGF- 01 is an effective chemotactic agent for PMNs in vitro as well as in vivo. That PMNs may represent an important source of TGF- 0 in inflammatory infiltrates was strongly suggested by a demonstration that stored TGF-/ 31 was secreted during phorbol myristate acetate-stimulated degranulation in vitro. Acid/ethanol extracts of human PMNs assayed by ELISA contained an average of 355 ng of TGF/ail per 109 cells potentially available for secretion during degranulation of PMNs. [3 H]Thymidine incorporation in vivo and autoradiography of tissue sections revealed that widespread cell proliferation was triggered by TGF- 01 injection. Synovial lining cells and cells located deep within the subsynovial connective tissue were identified as sources of at least som...|$|R
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of EntomologyGerald R. ReeckJohn C. ReeseSalivary {{secretions}} are a {{key component}} of aphid-plant interactions. Aphidsâ€™ salivary proteins interact with plant tissues, gaining access to phloem sap and eliciting responses which may benefit the insect. In an effort to isolate and identify key components in salivary secretions, we created a salivary gland cDNA library. Several thousand randomly selected cDNA clones were sequenced. We grouped these sequences into 1769 sets of essentially identical sequences, or clusters. About 22 % of the clusters matched clearly to (non-aphid) proteins of known function. Among our cDNAs, we have identified putative oxido-reductases and hydrolases that may be involved in the insect's attack on plant tissue. C 002 represents an abundant transcript among the genes expressed in the salivary glands. This cDNA encodes a novel protein that fails to match to proteins outside of aphids and is of unknown function. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry localized C 002 in the same sub-set of cells within the principal salivary gland. C 002 protein was detected in fava beans that were exposed to aphids, verifying that C 002 protein is a secreted protein. Injection of siC 002 -RNA caused depletion of C 002 transcript levels dramatically over a 3 day period after <b>injection.</b> With a <b>lag</b> of 1 â€“ 2 days, the siC 002 -RNA injected insects died, on average 8 days before the death of control insects injected with siRNA for green fluorescent protein. It appears, therefore, that siRNA injections of adults will be a useful tool in studying the roles of individual transcripts in aphid salivary glands...|$|R
40|$|To {{characterize}} {{the relationship between}} the pharmacokinetics and the acid inhibitory effect of ranitidine during prolonged dosing {{on the basis of a}} physiologic indirect-response model. Multiple doses of ranitidine were administered to 18 patients in an intensive care unit in an open randomized trial. All patients received an initial intravenous dose of 50 mg ranitidine; after 12 hours repeated injections (50 mg every 6 hours) or a primed continuous infusion (50 mg plus 0. 125 mg/kg/h) was administered. Intragastric pH was monitored continuously for at least 42 hours. After the initial <b>injection</b> a time <b>lag</b> was observed between the increase of plasma concentration and the increase of pH. With the indirect-response model the rate of onset of effect (kout) could be estimated adequately by relating the inhibitory effect on acid secretion to the concentration according to a sigmoid Emax model. For administration of a single dose, estimated pharmacodynamic parameters were 4. 5 +/- 0. 9 h(- 1) for kout, 1. 4 +/- 0. 1 for baseline pH, 0. 051 +/- 0. 012 mg/L for 50 % inhibition constant, and 7. 0 +/- 1. 5 for Hill factor (mean +/- SEM; n = 18). Tolerance developed during subsequent dosing that could be described as a linear increase (beta) of 50 % inhibition constant with time (beta = 0. 0030 and 0. 0045 mg/L/h for repeated and continuous administration, respectively). Conclusions: The developed physiologic indirect-response model may be used to quantify the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship of ranitidine during single and multiple dosing. During prolonged intravenous dosing, tolerance developed within 42 hours and could be characterized on the basis of the developed indirect-response mode...|$|R
