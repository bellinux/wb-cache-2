40|$|The {{fabrication}} of a steel drum (or steelpan), especially {{the sinking of}} the drum head by hand with a hammer, has been examined in detail utilizing light metallography (LM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Residual microstructures corresponding to reductions in thickness of up to 50 % {{at the bottom of the}} drum-head indicate that dislocation densities in the low carbon (0. 04 to 0. 09 % C), ferritic steels, can exceed 1010 cm – 2. This substructure in conjunction with a grain structure consisting of elongated grains produces hardness increases of up to 45 % at the bottom of the drum head. The heat treatment (or “burning”) of the Caribbean steel drum is an essential stage in the fabrication process and has been found to involve strain aging, which increases the hardness by an additional 5 to 20 %. This is especially prominent in drum steels containing from 0. 04 to 0. 09 % C. ^ The strain aging combined with the strain hardening applied to the drum head sinking and note fabrication process, produces a requisite elastic-plastic interaction which allows for multi-harmonic tuning and the creation of the unique chromatic tones and harmonic overtones which are characteristic of the various instruments. These unique features of note vibrations were observed by comparing impact hardness profiles with the corresponding static Vickers hardness measurements for actual, tuned notes and the same, corresponding notes extracted from the drum head, respectively. Elastic-plastic and plastic hardness profiles were compared in unique color maps. ^ In an effort to understand the influence of deformation on the sound of the steel drum, circular disks simulating free, ideal notes, and utilizing 316 stainless steel plates (0. 05 % C), were cold rolled to reductions up to 40 %. Disks were hung on a wire through a hole drilled on the edge of the disk, and hit with a heavy (tungsten alloy) mallet to record the acoustic sound spectra. ^ Requisite amounts of carbon interact with dislocations in deformed <b>drum</b> <b>steel</b> composing the note platform for the Caribbean steel drum to produce complex, non-linear behavior, especially notable in harmonic frequency spectra. Experiments on flat, circular disks prepared from high-quality, low-carbon (0. 04 wt. % C) <b>drum</b> <b>steel</b> illustrate harmonic spectrum changes and frequency peak splitting which is related to characteristic deformation (or strain); which in turn is related to dislocation density.

40|$|The <b>steel</b> <b>drum</b> bears an indexical {{relationship}} to notions of 'Caribbean identity' that correspond with fun, sun, and relaxation. These associations {{grow out of}} media representations in film, music, and the American tourist industries. Musicians in Pittsburgh and elsewhere around the world, however, use the <b>steel</b> <b>drum</b> in their own ways, expanding the types of music the <b>steel</b> <b>drum</b> is heard playing. While some still choose to use the <b>steel</b> <b>drum,</b> or <b>steel</b> pan as it is also known, in what is perceived as authentic Caribbean steelband music, others have found ways of incorporating it {{into a variety of}} musical genres such as jazz fusion. Music venues, audience perceptions, and performance opportunities determine the ways the <b>steel</b> <b>drum</b> is played and expressed in old and new forms. As the home of steel pan makers and many steel pan musicians, Pittsburgh plays a significant role in these exchanges. Ethnographic material from the Steel City reveals that expectations of authenticity influence the reception of steel pan music. World music education curriculums and multicultural programming in the region shape the instrument's identity as well. This thesis analyzes the complex ways the <b>steel</b> <b>drum</b> is imbued with notions of "Caribbeanness" and how musicians perform on this instrument within and beyond these cultural parameters...|$|R
