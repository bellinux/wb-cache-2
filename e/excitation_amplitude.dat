By analysing the cantilever vibration in the frequency domain, one obtains information about the stiffness and the damping of the whole mechanical system, consisting of the flexural beam clamped {{at one end and}} the sensor tip at the other end in force interaction with the sample surface. Variation of the cantilever-sample distance of the <b>excitation</b> <b>amplitude</b> changes the range of the tip-sample distance covered during the vibration cycles and consequently the section of the non-linear force interaction curve that is probed. Starting from high static loads and small excitation amplitudes, the contact resonance frequencies shift to lower values when the <b>excitation</b> <b>amplitude</b> is increased or when the static cantilever force is decreased. A further increase of the <b>excitation</b> <b>amplitude</b> leads to asymmetric resonance peaks, showing hysteresis when the direction of the excit ation changed.

As in this earlier study we identify the spontaneous creation of localized excitations with a discontinuity in the partition function. The fact that this phenomenon is retained in the saturable DNLS is non-trivial, since {{in contrast to the}} cubic DNLS whose nonlinear character is enhanced as the <b>excitation</b> <b>amplitude</b> increases, the saturable DNLS in fact becomes increasingly linear as the <b>excitation</b> <b>amplitude</b> increases.

40|$|Abstract. This study {{deals with}} the {{nonlinear}} dynamics associated with large deformation of a beam sliding on two-knife edge supports under external excitation. The beam {{is referred to as}} a Gospodnetic–Frisch-Fay beam, after the researchers who reported its static deformation in closed form. The freedom of the beam to slide on its supports imparts a nonlinear characteristic to the force-deflection response. The restoring elastic force of the beam possesses characteristics {{similar to those of the}} roll-restoring moment of ships. The Gospodnetic–Frisch-Fay exact solution is given in terms of elliptic functions. A curve fit of the exact solution up to eleventh-order is constructed to establish the governing equation of motion under external excitation. The dynamic stability of the unperturbed beam is examined for the damped and undamped cases. The undamped case reveals periodic orbits and one homoclinic orbit depending on the value of the initial conditions. The response to a sinusoidal excitation at a frequency below the linear natural frequency is numer-ically estimated for different <b>excitation</b> <b>amplitude</b> and different values of initial conditions covered by the area of the homoclinic orbit. The safe basins of attrac-tion are plotted for different values of <b>excitation</b> <b>amplitude.</b> It is found that the safe region of operation is reduced as the <b>excitation</b> <b>amplitude</b> increases...|$|E
40|$|This {{experimental}} investigation {{reveals the}} lock-on phenomena of cavity flows under periodic excitations. All the experiments {{were conducted in}} a recirculating water channel. The LDV system and the laser-light sheet technique are employed to perform the quantitative velocity measurements and the qualitative flow visualization, respectively. The Reynolds number, based on the momentum thickness at the upstream edge of the cavity, is kept around 152. An oscillating flat plate, situated above the cavity, generates the periodic perturbations. Depending upon the excitation amplitudes, several lock-on regions of the cavity shear layer are found when the excitation frequency ratio varies from 0. 28 to 2. 0. Also, the frequency bandwidth of each lock-on region becomes wider as the <b>excitation</b> <b>amplitude</b> increases. As the <b>excitation</b> <b>amplitude</b> increases beyond a threshold value (0. 78 mm), the number of lock-on regions increases. Moreover, when the <b>excitation</b> <b>amplitude</b> exceeds 0. 78 mm, the lock-on regions centered at 0. 7 fo and fo merge into each other. Here fo is the natural instability of the cavity shear layer. Unlike that of the oscillating cylinder, the side-wise expansion of each lock-on region is relatively mild. Slimmer lock-on regions may be caused by the robustness of the self-excited oscillation within the cavity...|$|E

40|$|AbstractExperiments {{examining}} the excitation of the quadrupolar n = 0, K = 1 to 6 resonances for the ion reserpine in a linear ion trap {{have been shown}} to produce resonance shifts that were dependent upon either or both of the <b>excitation</b> <b>amplitude</b> and trap pressure (Collings, B. A.; Douglas, D. J. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom., 2000, 11, 1016 – 1022). The extent of this dependency was determined by {{examining the}} effects of each parameter using an ion trajectory simulator. The simulations indicated that it is the change in <b>excitation</b> <b>amplitude</b> that is mostly responsible for the resonance shifts with a minor dependency upon the trapping pressure. It was found that the higher excitation amplitudes required to observe the higher order resonances resulted in greater shifts relative to the theoretical resonances predicted for an <b>excitation</b> <b>amplitude</b> of zero volts. The nature of these shifts can be understood by examining the equations of motion for an ion trapped in a quadrupolar potential during the excitation process. Rearrangement of the equations of motion lead to a Mathieu stability diagram in which the coordinate and ordinate variables are dependent upon the excitation frequency and amplitude. In such a diagram the resonances occur in the regions of instability. The calculated resonance shifts showed good correlation with the experimental and simulation results...|$|E
