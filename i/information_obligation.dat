5000|$|In Cases E-15/15 and 16/15, Vienna Life and Swiss Life, the Court {{ruled on}} the {{interpretation}} of Directive 2002/83/EC concerning life assurance. It held that Article 36(1) of the Directive does not address legal transactions according to which an existing unit-linked life assurance policy is transferred via a purchase agreement {{from one person to}} another where the insured risk, namely the insured person, under the assurance policy remains the same. Furthermore, a transfer of a unit-linked life assurance policy does not constitute a change in the policy conditions under Article 36(2) unless the terms of an assurance policy are also amended, thereby altering the balance of rights and obligations of the parties to an assurance contract. With regard to the referring court’s further questions on specific information duties under the Directive, the Court found, first, that if a “change in the policy conditions” within the meaning of the Directive has taken place, the referring court needs to consider whether the information listed in Annex III(B)(b)(2) was provided to the second-hand policy holder in a clear, accurate and complete manner and in an official language of the EEA State of commitment. Second, it is of no significance for the <b>information</b> <b>obligation</b> of the assurance undertaking whether the former policy holder was an undertaking and the new policy holder is a consumer, unless this difference has led to an amendment to the terms of the assurance contract. Neither is it of significance whether or not the original policy holder disclosed information about himself so that his own risk or investor profile could be assessed. As to the referring court’s question whether Annex III to the Directive has been correctly transposed into Liechtenstein law, the Court held that directives must be implemented into the national legal order of the EEA States with unquestionable binding force and the specificity, precision and clarity necessary to satisfy the requirements of legal certainty. Furthermore, national courts are bound to interpret national law in conformity with EEA law. Under Article 34 SCA, the Court has jurisdiction to give advisory opinions on {{the interpretation of}} the EEA Agreement upon the request of national courts. After the Court has rendered its judgment, it falls to the referring court to interpret national law in light of the Court’s findings. In cases where a harmonious interpretation of national law is not sufficient to achieve the result sought by the relevant EEA rule, that matter can be brought before the Court under the procedure prescribed by Article 31 SCA.|$|E

40|$|The key {{objective}} of the paper is to identify and assess the administrative burdens for businesses in Bulgaria according to the selected national laws related to the EU Internal Market. The study relies on objective data and analytical frameworks {{with a view to}} identify and assess the <b>information</b> <b>obligations</b> stemming from selected laws and regulations, including national rules implementing or transposing European legislation. This is an important step in strengthening Bulgaria’s national policy on better regulation for businesses. <b>Information</b> <b>obligations</b> are those arising from regulation to provide information and data to the public sector or third parties. Administrative burdens represent the “extra” administrative costs linked to collecting and providing information that businesses would not normally have to do {{in the absence of a}} legal obligation. While regulation is important and necessary, these additional costs represent a burden for businesses. It is a burden for business both in terms of money and time, which diverts resources from productive investments and generally discourages entrepreneurship. The methodology used in the paper is based on the Standard Cost Model for Estimating Administrative Costs established for assessing administrative costs imposed by the EU legislation. The paper is developed taking into account the findings of the OECD and the European Commission. The study outlines the results of the administrative costs and administrative burdens for businesses in Bulgaria of totally measured 742 <b>information</b> <b>obligations</b> (IOs) in 16 national laws and regulations to them in 9 selected priority areas during 2013. Even though the study is limited to specific legal acts and to an assessment of costs to business, the results are helpful in understanding the mechanisms by which the administrative costs and administrative burdens accrue. All IOs identified and verified in the paper, related both to national rules implementing or transposing European legislation, are distinguished by specific laws and by specific priority areas. The data collection methods include interviews with business entities (field work) and expert assessments. The results obtained from the study show that more than half of all IOs examined in the paper are concentrated in three selected national laws – the Medicinal Products in Human Medicine Act, the Law on Statistics and the Law on Technical Requirements for Products and Conformity Assessment. More than half of all IOs are associated with implementation of national requirements related to the EU Internal Market. As concerns the value of the administrative burden, the highest share of administrative burden of all identified and evaluated IOs is observed under the Excise Duties and Tax Warehouses Act and the Law on Support for Farmers. The lowest share of the administrative burden of all IOs is found under those laws where the identified and assessed IOs are only a few (the Law on Social Assistance, the Bulgarian Chamber of Builders Act, the Independent Assessors Act and the Cadastre and Land Registry Act) ...|$|R

30|$|The European {{chemicals}} regulation REACH 1907 / 2006 /EC [1] {{introduced a}} new communication duty concerning substances of very high concern (SVHCs) in articles (Art. 33). SVHCs are chemicals which are carcinogenic, mutagenic, toxic for reproduction, or very critical for the environment because they are persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT), or very persistent and very bioaccumulative (vPvB) or which cause concern for other reasons such as endocrine disruptors ([1] Art. 57). They {{are listed in the}} so-called candidate list [2] which is updated twice a year (last update 12 / 01 / 2017 with a total of 173 entries) and which should include all relevant currently known SVHCs by 2020 [3]. According to Art. 33 (2), consumers have the right to receive information from the suppliers of an article who is “any producer or importer of an article, distributor or other actor in the supply chain placing an article on the market” [1 Art. 3 (33)] about the presence of any SVHC. This applies for SVHCs that exceed a threshold of 0.1 % (weight/weight) in an article in terms of REACH, in a subassembly of an article [4, 5] or in its packaging. Information shall be provided within a time period of 45  days upon receipt free of charge. This <b>information</b> <b>obligation</b> is a very important element in the REACH regulation with the ambitious goal to minimize adverse effects for the consumer and the environment by increasing transparency and awareness on SVHCs in consumer articles, by helping the interested consumers to make informed purchasing decisions and by ensuring a safe use of articles, and it supports the efforts by producers to substitute SVHCs by less dangerous chemicals.|$|E
40|$|In {{traditional}} commercial transactions, {{consumers are}} usually {{regarded as the}} vulnerable party. 1 This vulnerability is, arguably, more pronounced in e-commerce due to the way this particular kind of business is conducted, and this creates additional complications that do not exist in a traditional trade transaction. E-consumer concerns can be reduced by creating an appropriate legal environment, including the introduction of consumer protection regulations. Most developed countries, such as the United Kingdom, have realised that empowering consumers is important for fostering the e-commerce market. 2 However, in developing countries, the lack of consumer protection regulations for e-commerce {{is one of the}} main barriers to the progression of e-commerce. Saudi Arabia is one country affected by a lack of efficient protection for e-consumers. 3 This lack of efficiency is attributed to the ambiguity of current measures available for protecting e-consumers; current measures are based on basic consumer protection principles gleaned from Sharia and some other standard regulations that are used for protecting e-consumers. In the context of e-commerce, these general rules require further explanation and clarification. 4 Therefore, the overriding objective of this research is to address the need for e-consumer protection regulations in Saudi Arabia by proposing a legal framework that might be used to provide efficient protection. This research identifies areas that contribute to the ambiguity of current measures, including a lack of clear unified regulations for e-consumer protection, and a lack of clear provisions in specific areas including: <b>information</b> <b>obligation,</b> the right to cancel, and rights of redress. In order to address these needs, a legal framework is suggested.

40|$|Ecologically {{sustainable}} development {{has become a}} major feature of legal systems at the international, national and local levels throughout the world. In Australia, governments have responded to environmental crises by enacting legislation imposing obligations and restrictions over privately-owned land. Whilst these obligations and restrictions may well be necessary to achieve sustainability, the approach to management of information concerning these instruments is problematic. For example, management of <b>information</b> concerning <b>obligations</b> and restrictions in Queensland is fragmented, with some instruments registered or recorded on the land title register, some on external registers, and some information only available in the legislation itself. This approach is used in most Australian jurisdictions. This fragmented approach has led to two separate but interconnected problems. First, the Torrens system is no longer meeting its goal of providing a complete and accurate picture of title. Second, this uncoordinated approach to the management of land titles, and obligations and restrictions on land use, has created a barrier to sustainable management of natural resources. This is because compliance with environmental laws is impaired in the absence of easily accessible and accurate information. These problems demonstrate a clear need for reform in this area. To determine how <b>information</b> concerning these <b>obligations</b> and restrictions may be most effectively managed, this thesis will apply a comparative methodology and consider three case studies, which each utilise different models for management of this information. These jurisdictions will be assessed according to a set of guidelines for comparison to identify which features of their systems provide for effective management of <b>information</b> concerning <b>obligations</b> and restrictions on title and use. Based on this comparison, this thesis will devise a series of recommendations for an effective system for the management of <b>information</b> concerning <b>obligations</b> and restrictions on land title and use, taking into account any potential legal issues and barriers to implementation.
