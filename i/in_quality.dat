5|$|The late stelae at Seibal show {{a marked}} {{reduction}} <b>in</b> <b>quality</b> over {{a span of}} about forty years, {{with the loss of}} Classic Period traits, and bearing flatter and cruder representations than earlier stelae.

5|$|A {{considerable}} leap <b>in</b> <b>quality</b> {{is evident}} here, {{compared to the}} Apostles {{of the church of}} Santa Maria dei Miracoli that had been carved just a few years earlier. The cycle of the Caesars is not only considerably grander in size but also a notable qualitative improvement over the previous production. The presence of these Caesars on the façade of the Loggia in Brescia is testament of an architectural and figurative leap, a full expression of classical art that has climbed from the earlier experiments at the Miracoli. Cairano, through the creation of the cycle and subsequent architectural ornamentation of the Loggia palazzo, becomes the fulcrum of commissions, both public and private, from Brescians keen to show off their descent from ancient Rome and to ride the wave of the local Renaissance.|$|E

40|$|Knowledge of {{determinants}} of change <b>in</b> diet <b>quality</b> is needed, {{but it is}} relatively limited to date and mostly available from cross-sectional studies. We investigated longitudinal change <b>in</b> diet <b>quality</b> and its associations with period of birth (birth cohort) and socio-demographic and lifestyle characteristics. We used dietary intake data collected by FFQ in 1992, 1996, and 2007 from a population-based random sample of adults comprising 1511 men and women aged 25 - 75 y at baseline and applied generalized estimating equations to examine {{determinants of}} long-term change <b>in</b> diet <b>quality,</b> calculated using a diet quality index reflecting dietary guidelines for Australian adults. Information on socio-demographic and lifestyle factors was derived from self-reported questionnaires. Multivariable models, stratified by sex, were adjusted for confounders. We showed {{that there was an}} overall increase <b>in</b> diet <b>quality</b> <b>in</b> both men and women, but scores related to intake of fruit (men only), cereals, and food variety decreased during a 15 -y follow-up. Younger age, higher occupational level (men only), and low to medium level of physical activity and hormone replacement therapy use in women were independently associated with greater improvement <b>in</b> diet <b>quality</b> over time (P < 0. 05). In conclusion, despite an overall improvement <b>in</b> diet <b>quality</b> over time, this study suggests that efforts to further improve diet <b>quality</b> <b>in</b> Australia should focus on increasing consumption of fruit, cereals, and a greater variety of foods. More evidence from studies that assess change <b>in</b> dietary <b>quality</b> <b>in</b> longitudinal studies is needed to corroborate these findings...|$|R
5|$|A {{variety of}} psychoactive {{drugs and alcohol}} have notable effects on consciousness. These range from a simple dulling of {{awareness}} produced by sedatives, to increases in the intensity of sensory qualities produced by stimulants, cannabis, empathogens–entactogens such as MDMA ("Ecstasy"), or most notably by the class of drugs known as psychedelics. LSD, mescaline, psilocybin, Dimethyltryptamine, and others in this group can produce major distortions of perception, including hallucinations; some users even describe their drug-induced experiences as mystical or spiritual <b>in</b> <b>quality.</b> The brain mechanisms underlying these effects are not as well understood as those induced by use of alcohol, but there is substantial evidence that alterations in the brain system that uses the chemical neurotransmitter serotonin play an essential role.|$|E
