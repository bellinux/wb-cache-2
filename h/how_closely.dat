5|$|In biology, a hybrid, or crossbreed, is {{the result}} of {{combining}} the qualities of two organisms of different breeds, varieties, species or genera through sexual reproduction. Hybrids are not always intermediates between their parents (such as in blending inheritance), but can show hybrid vigour, often growing larger or taller than either parent. The concept of a hybrid is interpreted differently in animal and plant breeding, where there is interest in the individual parentage. In genetics, attention is focused on the numbers of chromosomes. In taxonomy, a key question is <b>how</b> <b>closely</b> related the parent species are.|$|E
5|$|One {{measure of}} an instrument's {{usefulness}} {{is to see}} <b>how</b> <b>closely</b> it agrees with another similar instrument that has been validated against information from a clinical interview by a trained clinician. In this respect, the BDI-II is positively correlated with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale with a Pearson r of 0.71, showing good agreement. The test was also shown {{to have a high}} one-week test–retest reliability (Pearson r =0.93), suggesting that it was not overly sensitive to daily variations in mood. The test also has high internal consistency (α=.91).|$|E

Schaller and Fossey were instrumental in dispelling the public perception of gorillas as brutes, by demonstrably establishing the deep compassion and social intelligence evident among gorillas, and <b>how</b> very <b>closely</b> their behavior parallels that of humans.|$|R

5|$|Sea snakes were {{at first}} {{regarded}} as a unified and separate family, the Hydrophiidae, that later came to comprise two subfamilies: the Hydrophiinae, or true/aquatic sea snakes (now 16genera with 57species), and the more primitive Laticaudinae, or sea kraits (one genus, Laticauda, with five species). Eventually, as it became clear just <b>how</b> <b>closely</b> related the sea snakes are to the elapids, the taxonomic situation became less well-defined. Some taxonomists responded by moving the sea snakes to the Elapidae, thereby creating the subfamilies Elapinae, Hydrophiinae, and Laticaudinae, although the latter may be omitted if Laticauda {{is included in the}} Hydrophiinae. No one has yet been able to convincingly work out the phylogenetic relationships between the various elapid subgroups, and the situation is still unclear. Therefore, others opted to either continue to work with the older traditional arrangements, if only for practical reasons, or to lump all of the genera together in the Elapidae, with no taxonomic subdivisions, to reflect the work that remains to be done.|$|E
5|$|The chased hare {{will then}} run at around 40–45km/h (24–26mph) {{and the course}} will last around 35–40seconds over 0.5km (0.3 miles). The greyhounds which pursue the hare will, being faster, start {{to catch up with}} it. As greyhounds are much larger than hares but less agile, they find it {{difficult}} to follow the hares' sharp turns which they make to evade the dogs. This agility gives the hare an important and often crucial advantage as it seeks to escape. Under some coursing club rules, the dogs are awarded points on how many times they can turn the hare, and <b>how</b> <b>closely</b> they force the hare's progress. In the UK, the contest between the greyhounds was usually judged from horseback, and the winning greyhound proceeded to the next round of a knock-out tournament. The 2003 UK coursing season ran from 1 October to 28 February.|$|E
5|$|The minimum {{information}} produced from a successful structural alignment {{is a set}} of residues that are considered equivalent between the structures. This set of equivalences is then typically used to superpose the three-dimensional coordinates for each input structure. (Note that one input element may be fixed as a reference and therefore its superposed coordinates do not change.) The fitted structures can be used to calculate mutual RMSD values, as well as other more sophisticated measures of structural similarity such as the global distance test (GDT, the metric used in CASP). The structural alignment also implies a corresponding one-dimensional sequence alignment from which a sequence identity, or the percentage of residues that are identical between the input structures, can be calculated as a measure of <b>how</b> <b>closely</b> the two sequences are related.|$|E
40|$|The Candle Flames in Microgravity (CFM) {{experiment}} {{was designed to}} study how long candle flames can be sustained in microgravity, how the flames behave prior to extinction, and the <b>how</b> two <b>closely</b> spaced candle flames behave. The scientists hope that one day the results will help resolve age-old questions regarding the effects of gravity on certain types of flames (low momentum diffusion flames, or candle flames) {{and their ability to}} burn without the presence of gravity. This information will provide a better understanding of fires on spacecraft and could lead to advances in fire detection and extinction techniques...|$|R
40|$|Plasma {{enhanced}} chemical {{vapour deposition}} (PECVD) {{can be used to}} fabricate surfaces {{with a wide range of}} physical and chemical properties and are used in a variety of applications. Despite this, the mechanisms by which PECVD films grow are not well understood. Moreover, the species which contribute to film growth can be considered quite differently depending on the process. Particularly for functionalized plasma polymer films, the growth mechanisms are considered with respect to the chemistry of the depositing species, ignoring the physics of plasmas. Here we analyse the role ions play in the deposition of three common classes of depositing plasmas, and <b>how</b> these <b>closely</b> related fields treat ions very differently...|$|R

5|$|In {{an effort}} to confuse the Russians, the {{combined}} fleet made a feint westward toward Odessa on 8 October before turning east to Kinburn. The combined French and British fleet arrived off Kinburn on 14 October. That night, a force of nine gunboats escorted transports carrying 8,000 men, led by François Achille Bazaine, who were landed behind the forts, further up the peninsula. The gunboat force was commanded by Rear Admiral Houston Stewart, who ordered his crews to hold their fire in the darkness unless {{they were able to}} clearly see a Russian target. The Russians did not launch a counterattack on the landing, allowing the French and British soldiers to dig trench positions while the gunboats shelled the main fort, albeit ineffectively. By the morning of the 17th, the soldiers had completed significant entrenchments, with French troops facing the fortifications and British troops manning the outward defences against a possible Russian attempt to relieve the garrison. By this time, the French had begun building sapping trenches, which then came under fire from the Russian fortress. In the meantime, {{on the night of the}} 16th, a French vessel had taken depth soundings close to the main fort to determine <b>how</b> <b>closely</b> the ships could approach it. Throughout this time, heavy seas prevented the fleet from launching a sustained bombardment of the Russian positions.|$|E

40|$|We outline {{a vision}} for {{computational}} se-mantics in which formal compositional semantics is combined with a powerful, structured lexical semantics derived from distributional statistics. We consider how existing work (Lewis and Steedman, 2013) could be extended with a much richer lexical semantics using recent techniques for modelling processes (Scaria et al., 2013) —for example, learning that visit-ing events start with arriving and end with leaving. We show <b>how</b> to <b>closely</b> inte-grate this information with theories of for-mal semantics, allowing complex compo-sitional inferences such as is visiting→has arrived in but will leave, which requires interpreting both the function and content words. This will allow machine reading systems to understand not just what has happened, but when...|$|R

30|$|To a {{considerable}} extent, individual species demography followed the stand-level patterns closely. Nearly all species’ growth rates were elevated during the drought, declined {{until the early}} 1990 s, then stabilized or increased, and the same held for mortality rates of larger trees. Saplings, however, were much different, displaying no consistent mortality trend. This {{is based on the}} hierarchical model using piecewise regression, so we consider <b>closely</b> <b>how</b> it should be interpreted.|$|R
