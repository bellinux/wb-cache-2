50|$|The <b>European</b> Documentation and <b>Information</b> <b>Centre,</b> {{abbreviated}} CEDI (Centre Européen de Documentation et d'Information), was {{a former}} think tank founded in 1952 {{on the occasion of}} an international congress held in Santander, Spain. The objective of the organization was to unite various European conservative and Christian Democratic political organizations which formed in several Western European states during postwar reconstruction, the emerging Cold War and the beginnings of what would later be called European integration. During the 1950s and the 1960s, the CEDI was an important contact pool for European politicians. During its early years the CEDI's ideology and program was dominated by its first president, Otto von Habsburg, son of the last emperor of Austria. It was dissolved in 1990 following the collapse of the Iron Curtain.|$|R

In his own words, von Merkatz's political aim was the [...] "conservative rebirth of the Christian occident", whereby conservativism was understood by him not as an eligible political concept, but as an integral feature of personality.

40|$|In 1980, {{some major}} <b>European</b> {{scientific}} <b>information</b> <b>centres</b> established the "System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe" (SIGLE) {{to provide access}} to European grey literature and to improve bibliographic coverage. August 23, 2006, the Luxemburg Register of Commerce and Societies published the liquidation of the association EAGLE that produced the SIGLE database until 2005. Nevertheless, the former EAGLE member consented to preserve the European co-operation for grey literature and to transform the 1980 model into a sustainable network in the emerging environment of open access to scientific information. The first step was to archive the SIGLE records in an open and freely searchable database, conform to the OAI metadata harvesting protocol. The French INIST developed OpenSIGLE based on MIT software (DSpace) and loaded most of the SIGLE records in a simplified XML format. The communication provides an overview of the short history of SIGLE and EAGLE and describes how this unique resource was moved from a traditional host to an open access environment, giving the database a new look while preserving essential features characteristic for SIGLE.
