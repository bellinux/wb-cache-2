5|$|On announcing {{its plans}} for Steam Direct, Valve {{suggested}} the fee {{would be in}} the range of $100–5,000, meant to encourage earnest software submissions to the service and weed out poor quality titles that are treated as shovelware, improving the discovery pipeline to Steam's customers. Smaller developers raised concerns about the Direct fee harming them, and excluding potentially good indie games from reaching the Steam marketplace. Valve opted to set the Direct fee at $100 after reviewing concerns from the community, recognizing the need to keep this at a low amount for small developers, and outlining plans to improve their discovery algorithms and inject more human involvement to help these. Valve then refunds the fee should the game exceed $1,000 in sales. In the process of transitioning from Greenlight to Direct, Valve mass-approved most of the 3,400 remaining titles that were still in Greenlight, though the company noted that not all of these were at a state to be published. Valve anticipated that the volume of new games added to the service would further increase with Direct in place. Some groups, such as publisher Raw Fury Games and crowd funding/investment site Fig, <b>have</b> <b>offered</b> <b>to</b> pay the Direct fee for indie developers who can not afford it.|$|E

Few <b>have</b> <b>offered</b> <b>to</b> compensate those sterilized, however, citing that few are likely still living (and would of course have no affected offspring) and that inadequate records remain by which to verify them. At least one compensation case, Poe v. Lynchburg Training School & Hospital (1981), was filed in the courts {{on the grounds that}} the sterilization law was unconstitutional. It was rejected because the law was no longer in effect at the time of the filing. However, the petitioners were granted some compensation because the stipulations of the law itself, which required informing the patients about their operations, had not been carried out in many cases.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, Delaware North {{sued the}} NPS in the United States Court of Claims for breach of contract, {{claiming}} that the contract with Yosemite Hospitality excluded intellectual property from the asset purchasing clause, and demanded a payment for the property to be determined in court. Delaware North initially asserted the fair market value of its properties to be $51 million. When it offered for bid the contract to operate these facilities, the National Park Service estimated {{the value of the}} intangible assets at $3.5 million. Delaware North claimed to <b>have</b> <b>offered</b> <b>to</b> temporarily license the trademarks while the dispute is resolved, but claims that the government did not respond. The dispute gained national attention after it was publicized in an issue of Outside magazine, which led to the Sierra Club issuing a petition requesting that Delaware North drop the lawsuit.|$|E

500|$|A {{meeting was}} held over the Easter weekend in 1928 by the Cinque Ports Flying Club. Pleasure flights were given for {{a cost of}} 5/-. An unverified report stated that one person was {{dissatisfied}} with two circuits of the airfield. The pilot is said to <b>have</b> <b>offered</b> <b>to</b> take him up again, which was accepted. On this second flight various aerobatics were flown and the hapless passenger {{was said to have}} been left incapable of expressing himself coherently. Among the pilots attending were Geoffrey de Havilland and his son. Other activities included some air racing and a guess the altitude competition. In May a Notice to Airmen said that the scheme for aircraft reporting that they were crossing the Channel was being extended. Lympne was to remain the reporting place on the English side but, in Belgium and France, the Ostend and St Inglevert airfields were joined by semaphore stations at Village de Baracques, Calais and Cap d’Alprech, Boulogne. On 17 May, Lady Heath landed at Lympne after crossing the Channel during her [...] flight to Croydon from Cape Town, South Africa. She was flying an Avro Avian III which had been taken out to South Africa by ship. In August, the AuxAF held their annual Air Defence Exercises. Both 600 (City of London) and 601 (County of London) Squadrons AuxAF were based a Lympne {{for the duration of the}} exercise. They were operating Avro 504N and de Havilland DH.9A aircraft. Towards the end of the camp Chancellor of the Exchequer Winston Churchill and Under Secretary of State for Air Sir Philip Sassoon inspected both squadrons and were entertained at a dinner. On 18 September, Juan de la Cierva departed from Lympne in an Autogyro, making the first flight between London and Paris in this type of aircraft and the first flight across the Channel by autogyro in the process. In November, a Handley Page W.10 of Imperial Airways diverted to Lympne in a gale with three passengers suffering from airsickness. Once landed the aircraft was briefly lifted from the ground in a gust whilst ground handling staff were taking it to a hangar. Winds of [...] were recorded.|$|E

2500|$|... "Three {{organizations}} {{are involved in}} trying to force me off land I legally own — Stephenville Town Council: Stephenville Chamber of Commerce: and Stephenville Lions Club. It was the Chamber of Commerce in 1957 that called for the setting up of a civic park at Long Gull Pond. It is a whisper campaign, to make people believe I am {{standing in the way of}} progress, that I am stubbornly refusing to sell my land thus robbing the people of the west coast their own born-right to boil the kettle on their chosen spot of summer scenery. This argument is full of holes. Firstly, I have stated publicly that a first rate section of my land including frontage along the beach of the pond has been reserved and placed solely at the disposal of all comers without cost. I <b>have</b> <b>offered</b> <b>to</b> make such an arrangement permanent by entering into a proper contract with the appropriate authority. This fact, plus the fact that land is still available elsewhere on the pond, shows that more than just a park is involved.|$|E
2500|$|Archibald further {{increased}} his power by {{his marriage to}} the widow and heiress Joanna de Moravia in 1362. Joanna de Moravia {{was the daughter of}} Maurice de Moravia, Earl of Strathearn and Joanna Menteith, daughter to Fause Menteith Archibald is said to <b>have</b> <b>offered</b> <b>to</b> fight five English knights in single combat for her hand. [...] The Lady of Bothwell and heiress to the de Moravia dynasty, Joanna brought with her large estates and lordships throughout Scotland, which Archibald claimed de jure uxoris. This included the semi-ruined Bothwell Castle, which he promptly started to rebuild. The marriage was a device of the king to ensure that the Moray inheritance would be passed into safe (and loyal) hands. Since the death of Joanna's first husband, Sir Thomas de Moravia, the Lord of Bothwell, in 1361, she and her widowed mother had been wards of the court. Joanna was declared to be not only heiress of her father's unentailed lands, but also those of her first husband. The estates stretched from Aberdeenshire, Moray and Ross in the north, to Lanarkshire and Roxburghshire in the south. Although Douglas did not inherit his wife's father's Earldom of Strathearn, Douglas would be able to use his new-found kindred ties to the advantage of the King in the centre of the kingdom.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{responses}} {{to her voice}} emphasise her breathy sensuality. Another powerful feature was the sense of longing, in songs such as [...] "I Just Don't Know What to Do with Myself" [...] and [...] "Goin' Back". The uniqueness of Springfield's voice was described by Bacharach: [...] "You could hear just three notes and {{you knew it was}} Dusty". Wexler declared, [...] "er particular hallmark was a haunting sexual vulnerability in her voice, and she may have had the most impeccable intonation of any singer I ever heard". Greil Marcus of Rolling Stone captured Springfield's technique as [...] "a soft, sensual box (voice) that allowed her to combine syllables until they turned into pure cream." [...] She had a finely tuned musical ear and extraordinary control of tone. She sang in a variety of styles, mostly pop, soul, folk, Latin, and rock'n'roll. Being able to wrap her voice around difficult material, her repertoire included songs that their writers ordinarily would <b>have</b> <b>offered</b> <b>to</b> black vocalists. In the 1960s, on several occasions, she performed as the only white singer on all-black bills. Her soul orientation was so convincing that early in her solo career, US listeners who had only heard her music on radio or records sometimes assumed that she was African American. Later, a considerable number of critics observed that she sounded black and American or made a point of saying she did not.|$|E
