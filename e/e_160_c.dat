40|$|The studied {{area is a}} 130 km long fast {{spreading}} graben in Central Greece. Its complex geodynamical setting {{includes both}} {{the presence of a}} subduction slab at depth responsible for the recent (Quaternary) volcanic activity in the area and the western termination of a tectonic lineament of regional importance (the North-Anatolian fault). A high geothermal gradient is made evident by the presence of many thermal springs with temperatures from 19 to 82 C, that discharge along the normal faults bordering the graben. In the period 2004 e 2012, 58 gas and 69 water samples were collected and their chemical and isotopic analysis revealed a wide range of compositions. Two main groups of thermal waters can be distinguished {{on the basis of their}} chemical composition. The first, represented by dilute waters (E. C. < 0. 6 mS/cm) of the westernmost sites, is characterised by the presence of CH 4 -rich and mixed N 2 eCH 4 gases. The second displays higher salinities (E. C. from 12 to 56 mS/cm) due to mixing with a modified marine component. Reservoir temperatures of 150 <b>e</b> <b>160</b> <b>C</b> were estimated with cationic geothermometers at the easternmost sites. Along the graben, from west to east, the gas composition changes from CH 4 - to CO 2 -dominated through mixed N 2 eCH 4 and N 2 eCO 2 compositions, while at the same time the He isotopic composi- tion goes from typical crustal values (< 0. 1 R/RA) up to 0. 87 R/RA, showing in the easternmost sites a small (3 e 11...|$|E

Interestingly, using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), martensitic laths close to the fatigue crack walls or to the fracture surfaces of the specimens tested in vacuum are found to have transformed into very fine equiaxed subgrains.

Epidemiological {{studies have suggested that}} the difference in the timing of cancer onset in response to exogenous DNA damage is likely attributable to genetic variations, such as those associated with base excision repair genes. To test this long-standing hypothesis and elucidate how a genetic variation in the base excision repair gene flap endonuclease 1 (FEN 1) results in susceptibility to environment insults and causes cancer, we established a mutant mouse model carrying a point mutation (<b>E</b> <b>160</b> D) in Fen 1.

Two individuals carrying a homozygous substitution of the conserved arginine at position 160 by cysteine (R <b>160</b> <b>C)</b> manifest septo-optic dysplasia (SOD), a condition characterised by pituitary abnormalities associated with midline telencephalic structure defects and optic nerve hypoplasia. We have generated two knock-in mouse models containing either the I 26 T or R <b>160</b> <b>C</b> substitution in the genomic locus. Hesx 1 I 26 T/I 26 T embryos show pituitary defects comparable with Hesx 1 −/− mouse mutants, with frequent occurrence of ocular abnormalities, although the telencephalon develops normally.

40|$|The {{nef gene}} {{contributes}} to the replication of primate lentiviruses by altering the trafficking of cellular proteins involved in adaptive immunity (class I and II major histocompatibility complex [MHC]) and viral transmission (CD 4 and DC-SIGN). A conserved acidic leucine-based sequence (<b>E</b> <b>160</b> xxxLL) within human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) Nef binds to the cellular adaptor protein (AP) complexes, which mediate protein sorting into endosomal vesicles. The leucine residues in this motif are required for the down-regulation of CD 4 and for the up-regulation of DC-SIGN and the invariant chain of MHC class II, but {{the role of the}} acidic residue is unclear. Here, substitution of <b>E</b> <b>160</b> with uncharged residues impaired the ability of Nef to up-regulate the expression of the invariant chain and DC-SIGN at the cell surface, whereas substitution with a basic residue was required for a similar effect on the down-regulation of CD 4. All substitutions of <b>E</b> <b>160</b> relieved the Nef-mediated block to transferrin uptake. <b>E</b> <b>160</b> was required for the efficient interaction of Nef with AP- 1 and AP- 3 and for the stabilization of these complexes on endosomal membranes in living cells. Systematic mutation of the ExxxLL sequence together with correlation of binding and functional data leads to the hypotheses that AP- 1 and AP- 3 are major cofactors for the effect of Nef on the trafficking of transferrin, are less important but contribute to the modulation of the invariant chain and DC-SIGN, and are least critical for the modulation of CD 4.

40|$|The {{homeobox}} gene Hesx 1 /HESX 1 has {{been implicated in}} the establishment of anterior pattern in the central nervous system (CNS) in a number of vertebrate species. Its role in pituitary development has been documented through loss-of-function studies in the mouse. A homozygous missense point mutation resulting in a single amino acid substitution, Arg 160 Cys (R <b>160</b> <b>C),</b> is associated with a heritable form of the human condition of septo-optic dysplasia (SOD). We have examined the phenotype of affected members in this pedigree in more detail and demonstrate {{for the first time a}} genetic basis for midline defects associated with an undescended or ectopic posterior pituitary. A similar structural pituitary abnormality was observed in a second patient heterozygous for another mutation in HESX 1, Ser 170 Leu (S 170 L). Association of S 170 L with a pituitary phenotype may be a direct consequence of the HESX 1 mutation since S 170 L is also associated with a dominant familial form of pituitary disease. However, a third mutation in HESX 1, Asn 125 Ser (N 125 S), occurs at a high frequency in the Afro-Caribbean population and may therefore reflect a population-specific polymorphism. To investigate the molecular basis for these clinical phenotypes, we have examined the impact of these mutations on the regulatory functions of HESX 1. We show that Hesx 1 is a promoter-specific transcriptional repressor with a minimal 36 amino acid repression domain which can mediate promoter-specific repression by suppressing the activity of homeodomain-containing activator proteins. Mutations in HESX 1 associated with pituitary disease appear to modulate the DNA-binding affinity of HESX 1 rather than its transcriptional activity. Wild-type HESX 1 binds a dimeric homeodomain site with high affinity (K(d) 31 nM) whilst HESX 1 (S 170 L) binds with a 5 -fold lower activity (K(d) 150 nM) and HESX 1 (R <b>160</b> <b>C)</b> does not bind at all. Although HESX 1 (R <b>160</b> <b>C)</b> has only been shown to be associated with the SOD phenotype in children homozygous for the mutation, HESX 1 (R <b>160</b> <b>C)</b> can inhibit DNA binding by wild-type HESX 1 both in vitro and in vivo in cell culture. This dominant negative activity of HESX 1 (R <b>160</b> <b>C)</b> is mediated by the Hesx 1 repression domain, supporting the idea that the repression domain is implicated in interactions between homeodomain proteins. Our data suggest a possible molecular paradigm for the dominant inheritance observed in some pituitary disorders...|$|R

40|$|HYPONASTIC LEAVES 1 (HYL 1) is an {{important}} regulator of microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis. Incurvature of rosette leaves in loss-of-function mutants of HYL 1 implicates the regulation of leaf flatness by HYL 1 via miRNA pathways. Recent studies have identified jba- 1 D, jaw- 1 D, and oe- <b>160</b> <b>c,</b> the dominant mutants of MIR 166 g, MIR 319 a, and MIR <b>160</b> <b>c</b> genes, respectively, which display three types of leaf curvature. However, it remains unclear whether or how HYL 1 controls leaf flatness through the pathways mediated by these miRNAs. To define which miRNAs and target genes {{are relevant to the}} hyl 1 phenotype in terms of leaf incurvature, the effects of three mutated MIRNA genes and their targets on the direction and extent of leaf curvature in hyl 1 mutants were examined. The genetic analysis shows that the hyl 1 phenotype is strongly rescued by jba- 1 D, but not by jaw- 1 D or oe- <b>160</b> <b>c,</b> whereas the mutant phenotypes of jba- 1 D, jaw- 1 D, or oe- <b>160</b> <b>c</b> leaves are compromised by the hyl 1 allele. Expression analysis indicates that reduced accumulation of miR 166, rather than of miR 319 a or miR 160, causes incurvature of hyl 1 leaves, and that miR 319 a-targeted TCP 3 positively regulates the adaxial identity gene PHABULOSA while miR 160 -targeted ARF 16 negatively regulates the abaxial identity gene FILAMENTOUS FLOWER. In these cases, the direction and extent of leaf incurvature are associated with the expression ratio of adaxial to abaxial genes (adaxial to abaxial ratio). HYL 1 regulates the balance between adaxial and abaxial identity and modulates leaf flatness by preventing leaf incurvature, wavy margins, and downward curvature. It is concluded that HYL 1 monitors the roles of miR 165 / 166, miR 319 a, and miR 160 in leaf flattening through the relative activities of adaxial and abaxial identity genes, thus playing an essential role in leaf development...|$|R
