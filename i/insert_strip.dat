40|$|Abstract. Effect of Si {{content of}} Al-Si matrix on roll cast wire <b>inserted</b> <b>strip</b> was {{investigated}} in this paper. 99. 5 %Al, Al- 4 %Si, Al- 12 %Si and Al- 18 %Si were used as matrix. Slit depth of the nozzle, superheat of melt, wire-diameter and roll speed {{was chosen as the}} casting parameters, too. Addition of the Si was useful to prevent the reaction between the matrix and the wire. A downward melt drag twin roll caster could cast the wire <b>inserted</b> <b>strip</b> of the Al-Si matrix of which Si content was ranging up to 18 %. Composite strip, which matrix was hyper eutectic Al- 18 %Si, could be cast at the speeds up to 20 m/min. The gap between the wire and matrix became thin when the superheat was high. When the slit depth of the nozzle was too shallow, the wire could not be <b>inserted</b> in the <b>strip.</b> The thickness of the wire <b>inserted</b> <b>strip</b> became thinner as the roll speed became higher...|$|R

40|$|A helical {{wire antenna}} with a two-wavelength {{circumference}} is analysed {{using the method}} of moments. The helix radiates a circularly polarized (CP) wave in the conical-beam mode. A 10 % axial ratio bandwidth is obtained with a gain of approximately 6. 5 dB for a right-hand CP wave.

40|$|Abstract—The etching error causes serious {{frequency}} drift of a microstrip stepped-impedance resonator (SIR). This paper proposes a novel microstrip quarter-wave SIR structure, which is insensitive to fabrication tolerances. <b>Inserting</b> several ground <b>strips</b> in the low-impedance {{section of the}} resonator keeps the impedance ratio almost constant in spite of inaccurate fabrication. As an additional benefit, the resonator size would be miniaturized because the characteristic impedance of the microstrip line in the low-impedance section is mainly controlled by the signal <b>strips</b> and the <b>inserted</b> ground <b>strips</b> in a coplanar manner. The concepts and characteristics of this modified resonator structure are discussed in detail. The filters constructed by the conventional microstrip SIR were also designed and fabricated at the same frequency band to compare with the proposed ones. Measured results show that each proposed filter has compact size, wide stopband, and high tolerance to fabrication errors. Two four-pole cross-coupled filters were designed and fabricated to demonstrate the feasibility. Index Terms—Cross-coupled filter, fabrication tolerance, ground strip, spurious response, stepped-impedance resonator (SIR), transmission zero. I...|$|R

40|$|Heat {{transfer}} enhancement {{has been}} always a significantly interesting topic {{in order to}} develop high efficient, low cost, light weight, and small heat exchangers. The energy cost and environmental issue are also encouraging researchers to achieve better performance than the existing designs. Two of the most effective ways to achieve higher heat transfer rate in heat exchangers are using different kinds of inserts and modifying the heat exchanger tubes. There are different kinds of inserts employed in the heat exchanger tubes such as helical/twisted tapes, coiled wires, ribs/fins/baffles, and winglets. This paper presents an overview about the early studies on the improvement of the performance of thermal systems by using different kinds of <b>inserts.</b> Louvered <b>strip</b> <b>insert</b> had better function in backward flow compared to forward one. Modifying the shape of twisted tapes led to a higher efficiency in most of the cases excpet for perforated twisted tape and notched twisted tape. Combination of various inserts and tube with artificial roughness provided promising results. In case of using various propeller types, heat transfer enhancement was dependent on higher number of blades and blade angle and lower pitch ratio...|$|R
