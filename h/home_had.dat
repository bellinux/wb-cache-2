5|$|A pretrial show cause {{hearing in}} the Green case began in January 1996, with Green {{represented}} by Dennis Moore and Kevin Moriarty.

The defense also attempted to attribute Farrar's poisoning to Tim, who did much of the cooking in the household.|$|E
5|$|Hawes {{remained}} at Nelly's Ford until May 1865.

5|$|It is {{probably}} worth noting, {{if only to}} avoid confusion, that such claims (much like those made by spiritualists that conjurors were unable to explain the phenomena) were often unfounded. For example, spiritualists claimed that Robert-Houdin {{had been unable to}} explain what happened at a Home seance, and critics claimed that <b>Home</b> <b>had</b> refused an invitation to perform in front of Robert-Houdin. There is, however, not a shred of evidence for either of these claims.|$|E
5|$|Most ancient Egyptians were farmers {{tied to the}} land. Their {{dwellings}} were {{restricted to}} immediate family members, and were constructed of mud-brick designed to remain cool {{in the heat of}} the day. Each <b>home</b> <b>had</b> a kitchen with an open roof, which contained a grindstone for milling grain and a small oven for baking the bread.

He was unable to accept invitations to other countries, however, because the Nigerian government revoked his passport due to his support for Biafra.|$|E

5|$|While Roddenberry, Kelley and Nimoy {{gave their}} {{approval}} to the revised script, Paramount {{was concerned that}} the film would go over-budget as written and ordered cuts. Shatner's envisioned angels and demons at the film's climax were converted to rock monsters that the false god would animate from the earth. Shatner wanted six of the creatures, but was forced to accept just one. Concerned that the franchise's momentum following The Voyage <b>Home</b> <b>had</b> disappeared, Paramount rushed the film into production in late 1988 despite the writers' strike cutting into pre-production.|$|E

5|$|Hunter {{was born}} in Rothesay, at 7 Tower Street, on the Isle of Bute. The date was 7 August 1877. He was the {{youngest}} child of five, born to William and Jeanie (née Stewart) Hunter. George, as he was then known, showed an aptitude for drawing when very young {{and when he was}} about thirteen, his mother arranged for him to have painting lessons with a lady acquaintance. In February 1892, Hunter's elder sister Catherine died. Shortly after, in March, another elder sibling, James, also died. Both were in their early twenties. It is thought they may have been victims of an influenza pandemic. William, the father, and Jeanie, seem already to have contemplated emigrating, because a <b>home</b> <b>had</b> been sold. Evidently, the tragic deaths sealed the matter, and the remaining family departed for California via New York on 1 September 1892, aboard the SS Ethiopia.|$|E
5|$|In the {{accordion}} experiment, Home {{sat at a}} table, with Crookes and another observer {{on either side of}} him, each with a foot on one of Home's feet.

The accordion was reported to have played musical sounds. However, the amount of light in the room was not stated, and {{the accordion}} was not observed in good light. According to Frank Podmore there was no evidence the accordion played at all, as the keys were not observed to have moved. Podmore suggested the musical sounds could have come from an automatic instrument that <b>Home</b> <b>had</b> concealed.|$|E

Relatively few households (27.8%) had toilet facilities.

The mobile home was located on the Greater Leech Lake Indian Reservation near Squaw Lake in Itasca County, Minnesota. Bryan's mobile <b>home,</b> <b>had</b> it not been on the reservation, would have been subject to taxes from Itasca County. In June 1972, Itasca County notified Bryan that the mobile home was subject to US$147.95 in taxes. The Bryans could not afford to pay the tax, and contacted the Leech Lake Reservation Legal Services Project (Legal Services) for help, noting that the mobile home was on Indian land.|$|E
