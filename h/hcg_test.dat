In order to investigate the relationship between IGF-I, GH and testosterone, we examined 12 male subjects with various clinical conditions (classical GH deficiency (CGHD, N = 5), non-classical GH deficiency (NCGHD, N = 7), short idiopathic stature (N = 6), nutritional obesity (N = 8), GH-treated CGHD (N = 4), GH-treated NCGHD (N = 5) and normal stature (N = 7)) in which, for evaluation of hypogonadism (i. e. the absence of one or both testes from the scrotal sac), human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) tests were performed, We measured IGF-I, total and free testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) by radioimmunoassays before and 48 and 96 h after the start of the test. The values of IGF-I were lower (0. 001 < p < 0. 005) in CGHD and NCGHD than in the other groups. In comparison to basal levels, IGF-I values increased (0. 005 < p < 0. 05) both 48 and 96 h after the start of the <b>hCG</b> <b>test</b> in short idiopathic and normal stature children and in GH-treated subjects with NCGHD, but only 96 h in subjects with untreated NCGHD and GH-treated CGHD. No difference was demonstrated in basal values of total testosterone among any of the groups, while basal free testosterone levels were higher (0. 001 < p < 0. 05) in GH-treated subjects with NCGHD than in all the other groups except nutritional obesity: furthermore, free testosterone was higher ip < 0. 05) in nutritional obesity than in CGHD, The values of total and free testosterone obtained both 48 and 96 h after the start of the <b>hCG</b> <b>test</b> were higher (0. 001 < p < 0. 05) than basal values in all groups. The DHEAS values did not show any significant change during the <b>hCG</b> <b>test.</b> Basal values were higher (0. 01 < p < 0. 05) in nutritional obesity than in the other groups. Considering all groups, chonological age, bone age and bone age/chronological age ratio were correlated with basal free testosterone, IGF-I and DHEAS levels (0. 001 < p < 0. 05). while basal free testosterone and IGF-I values were correlated with DHEAS levels (p < 0. 005 and < 0. 01, respectively), In conclusion, our study during the <b>hCG</b> <b>test</b> in boys with various clinical conditions demonstrated an increase in IGF-I concentrations only in those boys with sufficient GH secretion or GH replacement therapy, These findings indicate that both sex steroids and GH are necessary to allow for the pubertal increase in IGF-I levels...|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Transvaginal {{sonography}} {{and human}} chorionic gonadotropin (<b>hCG)</b> <b>testing</b> are cornerstones of modern clinical practice in cases with the suspected ectopic pregnancy. In unclear cases, if the level of hCG is above the discriminatory zones, the use of uterine curettage is recommended. There is an increasing concern that strict observation of the guidelines would potentially harm otherwise normal early intrauterine pregnancies in certain cases. Case Outline. A 35 -year-old woman was admitted to hospital due to a severe lower abdominal pain. Based on the positive pregnancy test and sonographic exams which failed to demonstrate intrauterine pregnancy, the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy was presumed. Laparoscopy revealed ruptured corpus luteum cyst and the diagnosis was confirmed on histopathological finding. Postoperatively, normal intrauterine gestation was visualized. Conclusion. Since the diagnosis of early pregnancy and its complications can be misleading, in unclear cases, we support the expectative “wait and see” management consisting of serial <b>hCG</b> <b>testing</b> and repeated ultrasound examinations. Avoidance of uterine curettage in such unclear cases would further reduce the possibility of normal early pregnancy interruption...|$|R

40|$|Qualitative point-of-care (POC) 2 human {{chorionic}} gonad-otropin (hCG) {{testing is}} routinely performed on urine sam-ples {{obtained in the}} EmergencyDepartment (ED) or before surgery to rule out pregnancy and prevent fetal injury or death. Because potentially harmful treatments are allowed to proceed {{on the basis of}} a negative <b>hCG</b> <b>test</b> result, false-negative results can have disastrous consequences. We recently evaluated the performance of 11 com-mon qualitative POC hCG devices and determined that 9 of the 11 devices were susceptible to false-negative re-sults caused by hCG core fragment (hCGcf) (1). Although that study highlighted important limitations of these devices in a research laboratory setting, it was un-clear whether users experience false negatives in clinical practice. We performed a search of the FDA’s Manufac-turer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database using the search term “MAUDEpregnancy false negative ” (2). Our findings are shown in Figure 1. Seven hundred seven reports described false-negative POC hCG results in women shown to be pregnant at the time of testing. Ninety-one different POC hCG devices were described from 14 manufacturers, including 10 of the 11 devices evaluated in our initial screening study. On the basis of the descriptions in the MAUDE report, false negatives were subdivided by potential cause unknown, likely hCGcf hook effect, and likely limit of detection. One hundred forty-two reports were likely due to hCGcf hook effect, and 10 (7 %) of those were asso-ciated with adverse outcomes. Although the exact cause of the false-negative results cannot be conclusively estab-lished, interference by high concentrations of hCGcf potentially occurred in 200 patients. It is virtually certain that many more false-negative test results have adversely affected patient management but have gone unreported. Furthermore, these false-negative results occurred with many of the currently available devices, indicating that this problem is not lim-ited to a single manufacturer or a period of time in the past but represents a much larger public health issue that must be addressed.

Nevertheless, there remains the rare inherit possibility of embryo splitting that can result in monozygotic twins leading to high-order multiples. Also, when a patient is found to have a higher gestation than the number of embryos transferred it calls into question the IVF facility’s competency and credibility. The case report presented such a rare phenomenon of embryo splitting and the clinical consequences precipitated from it. In the patient, two blastocysts were transferred 5 days after transvaginal oocyte retrieval. The pregnancy confirming <b>hCG</b> <b>test</b> did not predict high-order multiples in this case.

Methods: In this purpose, 152 samples obtained from women and 44 samples from men were analysed by both tests during the follow-up of pregnancy termination, gestational trophoblastic disease and malignancies. The intermediate precision of the Roche test was also investigated on a pool with a low hCG concentration. Results and conclusions: The hCG concentrations measured with the Roche test were slightly lower compared with the Siemens assay; mean biases of − 34. 2 % and − 8 % were respectively obtained for hCG values ≤ 100 UI/L and higher than 100 UI/L. The overall agreement between both assays was 96. 1 % for women and 97. 7 % for men. By using an upper reference limit of 3. 2 UI/L for women and 1. 6 UI/L for men, the Roche test demonstrated a respective concordance of 98. 7 % and 100 %. This test also yielded an excellent precision with a coefficient of variation of 2. 8 % at a mean hCG concentration of 7 UI/L. SCOPUS: no. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the ectopic pregnancy rate among symptom-free women {{at increased risk}} undergoing a screening program involving transvaginal sonography and serum <b>hCG</b> <b>testing.</b> METHODS: Consecutive symptom-free women {{at increased risk for}} ectopic pregnancy were studied prospectively by transvaginal sonography and serum hCG measurement to detect ectopic pregnancy before the onset of symptoms. RESULTS: Between September 1993 and May 1996, 143 symptom-free pregnant women with pregnancies of a gestational age of less than 7 weeks were screened. Eight had ectopic pregnancies, 129 had intrauterine pregnancies, and six had trophoblast in regression. Among the eight women with ectopic pregnancies, one was initially diagnosed as having an intrauterine pregnancy. This women returned 1 week later with abdominal pain, and an ectopic pregnancy with intra-abdominal bleeding was found. Ectopic pregnancies were present in 5. 6 % (95 % confidence interval 2. 5 %, 10. 7 %) of the women screened. This was significantly lower than reported in a previous study. CONCLUSION: The ectopic pregnancy rate in the population that was offered screening was low. Thus, it is questionable whether the possible benefits (prevention of complications and reassurance of the woman) outweigh possible detriments (false-positive diagnosis, financial costs, and emotional stress that could be induced by screenin...|$|R
