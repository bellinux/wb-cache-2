5|$|Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough (née Jenyns, spelt Jennings in {{most modern}} references; 5 June 1660 (Old Style)– 18 October 1744) rose {{to be one}} of the most {{influential}} women of her time through her close friendship with Queen Anne of Great Britain. Sarah's friendship and influence with Princess Anne was widely known, and leading public figures often turned their attentions to her in the hope that she would influence Anne to comply with requests. As a result, by the time Anne became queen, Sarah’s knowledge of government, and <b>intimacy</b> <b>with</b> the Queen, had made her a powerful friend and a dangerous enemy.|$|E
5|$|The Queen lavished {{upon her}} {{favourite}} the royal manor of Woodstock {{and the promise}} of a fine palace commemorative of his great victory at Blenheim; but since her accession her relationship with Sarah had become progressively distant. The Duke and Duchess had risen to greatness not least because of their <b>intimacy</b> <b>with</b> Anne, but the Duchess's relentless campaign against the Tories (Sarah was a firm Whig), isolated her from the Queen whose natural inclinations lay with the Tories, the staunch supporters of the Church of England. For her part, Anne, now Queen and no longer the timid adolescent so easily dominated by her more beautiful friend, had grown tired of Sarah's tactless political hectoring and increasingly haughty manner which, in the coming years, were to destroy their friendship and undermine the position of her husband.|$|E
5|$|Sarah's frankness and {{indifference}} for rank, so admired by Anne earlier in their friendship, was now {{seen to be}} intrusive. Unlike most women of the time—many of whom did not have influence with their own husbands—Sarah had a powerful <b>intimacy</b> <b>with</b> the two most powerful men in the country, Marlborough and Godolphin. Godolphin, though a great friend of Sarah's, had even considered refusing high office after Anne's accession, preferring to live quietly {{and away from the}} political side of Sarah, who was bossy, interfering, and presumed to tell him what to do when Marlborough was away. Sarah, although a woman in a man's world of national and international politics, was always ready to give her advice; express her opinions; antagonize with outspoken censure; and insist on having her say on every possible occasion. However, she had a charm and vivaciousness which was admired by many; and she could easily delight those she met with her wit.|$|E

5|$|Shaw wrote The Christening, {{his only}} novel, in 1975. It centres around Miles Madgwick, who {{believes}} that he is bisexual but is too timid to find out through physical intercourse, so he instead describes his most intimate thoughts in his diary. He then meets a married woman named Alice and her son, Rodney; he comes to identify with Rodney's childhood innocence, and in Alice sees a symbol both {{of his mother and}} a heterosexual lover. Alice starts to tire of her husband and grow fonder of Madgwick, who experiences mixed emotions in his continued interactions with her and Rodney. One night, Rodney stays overnight at Madgwick's house and, when he takes the boy home in a taxicab, the driver observes their strange behaviour and accuses Madgwick of being a pederast. When Alice asks Madgwick to become the godfather to her new child, the driver threatens to expose Madgwick, creating a conflict between losing his first feelings of <b>intimacy</b> <b>with</b> others or facing humiliation and ridicule at the driver's exposure.|$|E
5|$|It is {{certainly}} obvious that Jocelin {{was one of}} the most respected figures in the kingdom. In this era, the Pope appointed Jocelin Judge-delegate (of the Papacy) more times than any other cleric in the kingdom. As a bishop and an ex-abbot, various bishoprics and monasteries called him in to mediate disputes, as evidenced by his frequent appearance as a witness in dispute settlements, such as the dispute between Arbroath Abbey and the Bishopric of St Andrews, and a dispute between Jedburgh Abbey and Dryburgh Abbey. Jocelin had the respect of the secular elite too. He witnessed 24 royal charters and 40 non-royal charters, including charters issued by David, Earl of Huntingdon (the brother of King William), Donnchadh, Earl of Carrick, and Alan Fitzwalter, High Steward of Scotland. Jocelin had been with King William when he visited the English court in 1186, and again accompanied the king to England when the king travelled to Woodstock near Oxford to marry Ermengarde de Beaumont on 5 September 1186. The marriage was blessed by Bishop Jocelin in their chamber, and it was to Jocelin's escort that King William entrusted her for the journey to Scotland. When a son was born to William and Ermengarde, the future King Alexander II, it was Jocelin who performed the baptism. In April 1194, Jocelin again travelled to England in King William's company when William was visiting King Richard I. Jocelin's <b>intimacy</b> <b>with</b> the king would be the key to earning his patronage, thus making possible the legacy that Jocelin would leave to Glasgow.|$|E

60|$|I {{spent two}} years rather in {{wandering}} up and down than travelling; for though I had no mind to serve, yet I could not find in my heart to leave Germany; and I had obtained some so very close <b>intimacies</b> <b>with</b> the general officers that I was often in the army, and sometimes they did me the honour to bring me into their councils of war.|$|R
30|$|The {{informants}} {{were involved}} in various types of cross-border <b>intimacies</b> <b>with</b> Chinese men. Some women who first migrated for job opportunities and then married Chinese men, and others migrated for marriage. Some registered their marriages, but others did not; some lived in cities, while others lived in villages; and some resided on the Chinese {{side of the border}} and others on the Vietnamese side. The situation of Vietnamese brides even varied from case to case for those who lived in the same community.|$|R
50|$|Prince Aage {{carried on}} a passionate flirtation with Princess Marie Bonaparte, the wife of his cousin Prince George of Greece and Denmark, who had also enjoyed <b>intimacies</b> <b>with</b> his father. In neither case does it appear that Prince George objected, or felt obliged to give the matter any attention. In 1909 Prince Aage joined the Danish Army, and by 1913 had risen {{to the rank of}} lieutenant. During World War I he served as an {{observer}} in Italy for a year. Returning home to Denmark he was promoted to captain.|$|R

25|$|Relationship based models give {{importance}} to the relationships that help children reach and master early developmental milestones.

25|$|Throughout {{the reign}} of Paul I, Czartoryski was in high favour and on the closest terms of <b>intimacy</b> <b>with</b> the Tsar, who in December 1798 {{appointed}} him ambassador {{to the court of}} Charles Emmanuel IV of Sardinia. On reaching Italy, Czartoryski found that that monarch was a king without a kingdom, so that the outcome of his first diplomatic mission was a pleasant tour through Italy to Naples, the acquisition of the Italian language, and a careful exploration of the antiquities of Rome.|$|E

25|$|Professor George Buchanan Gray of Mansfield College, Oxford, in {{the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries, wrote that the Israelite men's {{participation}} in the sacrificial feasts followed their <b>intimacy</b> <b>with</b> the women, who then naturally invited their paramours to their feasts, which, according to custom, were sacrificial occasions. Gray considered {{that it would have}} been in accord with the sentiment of early Israelites to worship the Moabite god on his own territory. Similalry, Professor Frymer-Kensky of Chicago University wrote that the cataclysm began with a dinner invitation from the Moabite women, who perhaps wanted to be friendly with the people whom Balaam had tried, but failed, to curse.|$|E
25|$|Müller {{was born}} in Berlin. It was {{intended}} that he should study Protestant theology, but from 1798 he devoted himself in Göttingen {{to the study of}} law, philosophy, and natural science. He was a student of Gustav Hugo. Returning to Berlin, he was persuaded by his friend Friedrich von Gentz to take up political science. He had early formed a close <b>intimacy</b> <b>with</b> Gentz, his elder by 15 years; and this connection exercised an important influence both on his material circumstances and his mental development in after life. The two men differed widely in character and in their fundamental principles, but agreed, at least in their later period, in their practical political aims, and the friendship was only terminated by death.|$|E
25|$|Letters and {{drafts of}} poems suggest that Keats first met Frances (Fanny) Brawne between September and November 1818. It {{is likely that}} the 18-year-old Brawne visited the Dilke family at Wentworth Place before she lived there. She was born in the hamlet of West End (now in the {{district}} of West Hampstead), on 9 August 1800. Like Keats's grandfather, her grandfather kept a London inn, and both lost several family members to tuberculosis. She shared her first name with both Keats's sister and mother, and had a talent for dress-making and languages as well as a natural theatrical bent. During November 1818 she developed an <b>intimacy</b> <b>with</b> Keats, but it was shadowed by the illness of Tom Keats, whom John was nursing through this period.|$|E

25|$|Desmond Morris {{suggested}} in his 1967 popular-science book The Naked Ape {{that the female}} orgasm evolved to encourage physical <b>intimacy</b> <b>with</b> a male partner and help reinforce the pair bond. Morris suggested that the relative difficulty in achieving female orgasm, {{in comparison to the}} male's, might be favorable in Darwinian evolution by leading the female to select mates who bear qualities like patience, care, imagination, intelligence, as opposed to qualities like size and aggression, which pertain to mate selection in other primates. Such advantageous qualities thereby become accentuated within the species, driven by the differences between male and female orgasm. If males were motivated by, and taken to the point of, orgasm {{in the same way as}} females, those advantageous qualities would not be needed, since self-interest would be enough.|$|E
25|$|People with NPD tend {{to exaggerate}} {{their skills and}} accomplishments {{as well as their}} level of <b>intimacy</b> <b>with</b> people they {{consider}} to be high-status. Their sense of superiority may cause them to monopolize conversations and to become impatient or disdainful when others talk about themselves. In the course of a conversation, they may purposefully or unknowingly disparage or devalue the other person by overemphasizing their own success. When they are aware that their statements have hurt someone else, they tend to react with contempt and to view it as a sign of weakness. When their own ego is wounded by a real or perceived criticism, their anger can be disproportionate to the situation, but typically, their actions and responses are deliberate and calculated. Despite occasional flare-ups of insecurity, their self-image is primarily stable (i.e., overinflated).|$|E
25|$|Until {{their first}} act of sexual intercourse, {{adolescents}} generally see virginity {{in one of}} the following ways: as a gift, a stigma, or a normal step in development. Girls typically think of virginity as a gift, while boys think of virginity as a stigma. In interviews, girls said that they viewed giving someone their virginity as like giving them a very special gift. Because of this, they often expected something in return such as increased emotional <b>intimacy</b> <b>with</b> their partners or the virginity of their partner. However, they often felt disempowered because of this; they often did not feel like they actually received what they expected in return and this made them feel like they had less power in their relationship. They felt that they had given something up and did not feel like this action was recognized.|$|E
5000|$|Writing for Allmusic, {{music critic}} Michael G. Nastos {{wrote of the}} album: [...] "A duet {{recording}} between pianist Bill Evans and guitarist Jim Hall is one that should retain high expectations to match melodic and harmonic <b>intimacies</b> <b>with</b> brilliant spontaneous musicianship. Where this recording delivers that supposition {{is in the details}} and intricacy with which Evans and Hall work, guided by simple framings of standard songs made into personal statements that include no small amounts of innovation... At only 32 and a half minutes, it's disappointing there are no bonus tracks and/or additional material for a CD-length reissue, but Intermodulation still remains a precious set of music from these two great modern jazz musicians." ...|$|R
60|$|Now here a {{very useful}} moral may be deduced. Ladies, take care how you permit yourselves to fall into <b>intimacies</b> <b>with</b> unknown gentlemen on your travels. It is not {{pleasant}} to be spoken of as this man was speaking of Miss Baker and her niece. The truth was, that a more punctilious person in her money dealings than Miss Baker never carried a purse. She had not allowed Mr. M'Gabbery so much as to lay out on her behalf a single piastre for oranges on the road. Nor had he been their sole companion on their journey through the desert. They had come to Jerusalem with a gentleman and his wife: Mr. M'Gabbery had been kindly allowed to join them.|$|R
60|$|Armine's term {{likewise}} ended, and his examination {{being over}} with much credit, he wished for {{nothing better than}} to resume the pursuits he had long shared with Fordham. He had not Jock's facility in forming <b>intimacies</b> <b>with</b> youths of his own age. His development was too exclusively on the spiritual and intellectual side to attract ordinary lads, and his home gave him sufficient interests outside his studies; and thus Fordham was still his sole, as well as his earliest, friend outside the family. Their intercourse had never received the check that circumstances had interposed between others of the two families, Armine had spent part of almost all his vacations with the Evelyns, the correspondence had been a great solace to the invalid, and the friendship grew yearly more equal.|$|R
25|$|In {{this society}} he soon became known to and patronized {{by people of}} the first rank, and was in names or <b>intimacy</b> <b>with</b> many of them; {{particularly}} the Earl of Burlington, so well known for his taste in the fine arts, especially architecture. For him he painted, among others, a large picture {{of the royal family}} of England: in the middle compartment are all the younger branches of the family on a very large canvas, and on one hand above the door a half length of her majesty Queen Caroline; the picture of the king was intended to fill the niche opposite to it, but Mr. Aikman's death happening before it was begun, the place for it is left blank. This picture came into the possession of the Duke of Devonshire, whose father married Lady Mary Boyle, daughter and only child to the Earl of Burlington.|$|E
25|$|The Bhagavata Purana {{played a}} key role in the history of Indian theatre, music and dance, {{particularly}} through the tradition of Ras and Leela. These are dramatic enactments about Krishna's childhood, teenage and adult life. The themes range from his innocent frolics as a child, to his expressing his confusion and doubts about approaching girls, to him wooing and romancing gopis (girls in the cow herding community) who meet him secretly thus getting in trouble with their parents, to his <b>intimacy</b> <b>with</b> beloved Radha, to his playing flute while saving the world from all sorts of troubles and thus preserving the dharma. Some of the text's legends have inspired secondary theatre literature such as the eroticism in Gita Govinda. While Indian dance and music theatre traces its origins to the ancient Sama Veda and Natyasastra texts, the Bhagavata Purana and other Krishna-related texts such as Harivamsa and Vishnu have inspired numerous choreographic themes.|$|E
25|$|By 1666 Behn {{had become}} {{attached}} to the court, possibly through the influence of Thomas Culpeper and other associates. The Second Anglo-Dutch War had broken out between England and the Netherlands in 1665, and she was recruited as a political spy in Antwerp on behalf of King Charles II, possibly {{under the auspices of}} courtier Thomas Killigrew. This is the first well-documented account we have of her activities. Her code name {{is said to have been}} Astrea, a name under which she later published many of her writings. Her chief role was to establish an <b>intimacy</b> <b>with</b> William Scot, son of Thomas Scot, a regicide who had been executed in 1660. Scot was believed to be ready to become a spy in the English service and to report on the doings of the English exiles who were plotting against the King. Behn arrived in Bruges in July 1666, probably with two others, as London was wracked with plague and fire. Behn's job was to turn Scot into a double agent, but there is evidence that Scot betrayed her to the Dutch.|$|E
