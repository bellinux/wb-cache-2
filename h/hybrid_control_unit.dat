40|$|Abstract—Fault {{detection}} determines faultexistence and detecting time. This paper discusses two layered {{fault detection}} methods {{to enhance the}} reliability and safety. Two layered fault detection methods consist of fault detection methods of component level controllers and system level controllers. Component level controllers detect faults by using limit checking, model-based detection, and data-driven detection and system level controllers execute detection by stability analysis which can detect unknown changes. System level controllers compare detection results via stability with fault signals from lower level controllers. This paper addresses fault detection methods via stability and suggests fault detection criteria in nonlinear systems. The fault detection method applies tothe <b>hybrid</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> of a military hybrid electric vehicleso that the <b>hybrid</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> can detect faults of the traction motor...|$|E

40|$|City {{pollution}} {{is a very}} important issue which effects our daily life and our health. Commercial trucks which run diesel engines are responsible for most of the pollution in our cities. With new intelligent plug-in hybrid technology fuel consumption can be reduced by more than a half. By reducing fuel consumption internal combustion engine emissions decrease. The IPHEV also has an integrated GPS system which can track the vehicle and work with the onboard computer system to automatically turn off the diesel engine and switch to pure electric mode when the vehicle enters the city center or a designated green zone. The electric motor uses a LiFePO 4 battery which has a range of 35 to 65 km.

25|$|The Prius Plug-in {{has three}} drive modes, all-electric (EV), and two hybrid modes: Eco and Power. The EV mode is user-selectable and when running in this mode the <b>hybrid</b> engine <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> (ECU) {{operates}} the vehicle using only the larger motor-generator (MG2) if pre-determined parameters are satisfied, such as sufficient battery {{state of charge}} (SOC) and vehicle speed within EV mode range. The Eco mode is designed to maximize fuel savings for any driving conditions, and modifies or smoothes out the electronic throttle control program to reduce throttle response, reducing the throttle opening to a maximum of 11.6%, and also modifies the operation of the air conditioning system. As an additional benefit, the Eco mode improves performance in low-traction conditions because the reduced output helps to minimize wheel skidding such as those caused by ice and snow. Power mode increases throttle response in the middle range more than normal.|$|R

SiC devices are expected to help <b>hybrid</b> vehicle power <b>control</b> <b>units</b> (PCUs) produce higher power in a more compact size as SiC can withstand higher voltages and temperatures (above 300 °C) than silicon with less power loss. The improvement of interconnection technologies is increasingly becoming a top priority, particularly for the operation of SiC devices at relatively high temperatures.

The performance of the proposed strategy should be effectively evaluated using a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation model of a semi-active suspension system based on the fuzzy <b>hybrid</b> <b>control</b> strategy prior to real vehicle implementations.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop {{parallel}} hybrid tractor. The hybrid tractor was constructed by adding major components of a hybrid driving system on a tractor. The tractor has 71 kW engine power and the major components included an EMG (electric motor/generator), an inverter, batteries, a battery management system (BMS), and a <b>hybrid</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> (HCU). The hybrid tractor had three control modes: idle, power assist, and battery charge and it were determined by the workload which estimated by measuring engine rotational speed. Performance of the hybrid tractor was evaluated through the field tests of plowing. Performance tests were conducted by comparing the hybrid tractor and the conventional one, and one hybrid tractor was used for the experiment. The hybrid tractor used the hybrid system for the control of EMG, and the conventional tractor was driven by the engine not using the hybrid system. Performances of the hybrid tractor and the conventional tractor were similar at M 2 which is low speed condition and it could work with low load, but the performance of the hybrid tractor was better than one of the conventional tractor at higher load condition (M 3, M 4). Fuel efficiency of the hybrid tractor at M 2 was similar with the one of the conventional tractor, but it was lower at M 3 and M 4 than the one of the conventional tractor by 74 %. Considering all results of this study, the developed parallel hybrid tractor is feasible to improve plowing performance of the conventional tractor...|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work {{was to investigate the}} impact of different hybridization concepts and levels of hybridization on fuel economy of a standard road vehicle where both conventional and non-conventional hybrid architectures are treated exactly in the same way {{from the point of view}} of overall energy flow optimization. Hybrid component models were developed and presented in detail as well as the simulations results mainly for NEDC cycle. The analysis was performed on four different parallel hybrid powertrain concepts: Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV), High Speed Flywheel Hybrid Vehicle (HSF-HV), Hydraulic Hybrid Vehicle (HHV) and Pneumatic Hybrid Vehicle (PHV). In order to perform equitable analysis of different hybrid systems, comparison was performed also on the basis of the same usable system energy storage capacity (i. e. 625 kJ for HEV, HSF and the HHV) but in the case of pneumatic hybrid systems maximal storage capacity was limited by the size of the systems in order to comply with the packaging requirements of the vehicle. The simulations were performed within the IAV Gmbh - VeLoDyn software simulator based on Matlab / Simulink software package. Advanced cycle independent control strategy (ECMS) was implemented into the <b>hybrid</b> supervisory <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> in order to solve power management problem for all hybrid powertrain solutions. In order to maintain State of Charge within desired boundaries during different cycles and to facilitate easy implementation and recalibration of the control strategy for very different hybrid systems, Charge Sustaining Algorithm was added into the ECMS framework. Also, a Variable Shift Pattern VSP-ECMS algorithm was proposed as an extension of ECMS capabilities so as to include gear selection into the determination of minimal (energy) cost function of the hybrid system. Further, cycle-based energetic analysis was performed in all the simulated cases, and the results have been reported in the corresponding chapters...|$|R
