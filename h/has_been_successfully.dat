5|$|A {{successful}} {{test for}} beryllium in air and on surfaces has been recently developed and published {{as an international}} voluntary consensus standard ASTM D7202. The procedure uses dilute ammonium bifluoride for dissolution and fluorescence detection with beryllium bound to sulfonated hydroxybenzoquinoline, allowing up to 100 times more sensitive detection than the recommended limit for beryllium concentration in the workplace. Fluorescence increases with increasing beryllium concentration. The new procedure <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>successfully</b> tested {{on a variety of}} surfaces and is effective for the dissolution and ultratrace detection of refractory beryllium oxide and siliceous beryllium (ASTM D7458).|$|E
5|$|Before the war, Brihannala {{asks the}} chariot to be {{directed}} to a shami tree (prosopis cineraria) where the Pandavas' divine weapons are hidden. The 13th year ends on that day and Brihannala regains his form of Arjuna. On realising who Brihannala is, Uttara Kumara is happy to serve him. Arjuna then uses the Sammohanastra weapon, which puts the Kaurava army to sleep. The cattle is rescued and the Pandavas declare that their 13 year exile <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>successfully</b> completed. Krishna visits Matsya and the marriage of Uttaraa with Abhimanyu is finalised.|$|E
5|$|Populations of pest insects can {{sometimes}} be dramatically reduced by the release of sterile individuals. This involves the mass rearing of a pest, sterilising it by means of X-rays or some other means, and releasing it into a wild population. It is particularly useful where a female only mates once and where the insect does not disperse widely. This technique <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>successfully</b> used against the New World screw-worm fly, some species of tsetse fly, tropical fruit flies, the pink bollworm and the codling moth, among others.|$|E

5|$|Banksia acanthopoda {{is little}} known in cultivation, {{although}} it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>successfully</b> grown and propagated at The Banksia Farm in Mount Barker, Western Australia, {{and at the}} Royal Botanic Gardens in Cranbourne, Melbourne. It is a sprawling and untidy shrub, but its habit can be improved by pruning. Its prominent yellow flower heads appear from July to October in cultivation, and have potential {{for use in the}} cut flower industry. It prefers a well-drained soil in full sun or light shade, and will tolerate dry conditions once established. Propagation is by seed; seeds take three to five weeks to germinate, and have a germination rate of 80 to 90 percent.|$|E
5|$|Different tammar {{populations have}} {{varying levels of}} {{resistance}} to sodium fluoroacetate. Mainland Western tammars {{appear to be the}} most resistant, while those on Kangaroo Island are much more vulnerable. Tammars from New Zealand are also vulnerable, as the poison <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>successfully</b> used to control their populations. Tammars from East and West Wallabi Islands and Garden Island, which do not have plants containing sodium fluoroacetate, are less resistant than mainland Western tammars but are more resistant than those from Kangaroo Island. This suggests that tammars originated in South Australia and developed a resistance to sodium fluoroacetate when they reached Western Australia, where the poison is found in plants.|$|E
5|$|Malaria <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>successfully</b> {{eliminated}} or {{greatly reduced}} in certain areas. Malaria was once {{common in the}} United States and southern Europe, but vector control programs, {{in conjunction with the}} monitoring and treatment of infected humans, eliminated it from those regions. Several factors contributed, such as the draining of wetland breeding grounds for agriculture and other changes in water management practices, and advances in sanitation, including greater use of glass windows and screens in dwellings. Malaria was eliminated from most parts of the USA in the early 20th century by such methods, {{and the use of the}} pesticide DDT and other means eliminated it from the remaining pockets in the South in the 1950s as part of the National Malaria Eradication Program. Bill Gates has said that he thinks global eradication is possible by 2040.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the easier}} Western species to grow, Banksia lemanniana has some horticultural {{potential}} in its attractive chocolate buds, green-yellow hanging flower spikes and large grey spikes with prominent follicles. It generally grows quite quickly, but nevertheless takes {{five to six}} years to flower from seed. It prefers a more alkaline rocky or sandy soil, with a nominal pH range from 6 to 7.5. It favours a sunny position and good drainage, and <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>successfully</b> cultivated in more humid climates on Australia's east coast. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 27 to 43 days to germinate.|$|E
5|$|Several {{therapeutic}} {{approaches are}} in use or under investigation {{to treat the}} most common serpinopathy: antitrypsin deficiency. Antitrypsin augmentation therapy is approved for severe antitrypsin deficiency-related pulmonary emphysema. In this therapy, antitrypsin is purified from the plasma of blood donors and administered intravenously (first marketed as Prolastin). To treat severe antitrypsin deficiency-related disease, lung and liver transplantation has proven effective. In animal models, gene targeting in {{induced pluripotent stem cells}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>successfully</b> used to correct an antitrypsin polymerisation defect and to restore the ability of the mammalian liver to secrete active antitrypsin. Small molecules have also been developed that block antitrypsin polymerisation in vitro.|$|E
5|$|The Lord Howe Island {{stick insect}} {{disappeared}} from the main island soon after the introduction of rats in 1918. In 2001 a tiny population was discovered in a single Melaleuca howeana shrub {{on the slopes of}} Ball's Pyramid, <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>successfully</b> bred in captivity, and is nearing re-introduction to the main island. The Lord Howe stag beetle is a colourful endemic beetle seen during summer months. Another endemic invertebrate, the Lord Howe flax snail (or Lord Howe Placostylus), has also been affected by the introduction of rats. Once common, the species is now endangered and a captive breeding program is under way to save the snail from extinction.|$|E

5|$|The blue {{wildebeest}} is {{native to}} Angola, Botswana, Kenya, Mozambique, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Today it is extinct in Malawi, but <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>successfully</b> reintroduced in Namibia. The southern limit of the blue wildebeest range is the Orange River, while the western limit is bounded by Lake Victoria and Mt Kenya. The blue wildebeest is widespread and is being introduced into private game farms, reserves and conservancies. For this reason, the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) rates the blue wildebeest as being of Least Concern. The population has been estimated to be around {{one and a half}} million and the population trend is stable.|$|E
5|$|The blue {{wildebeest}} is {{native to}} eastern and southern Africa. Its range includes Kenya, Tanzania, Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, South Africa, Swaziland and Angola. It is no longer found in Malawi but <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>successfully</b> reintroduced into Namibia. Blue wildebeest are mainly found in short grass plains bordering bush-covered acacia savannas, thriving {{in areas that are}} neither too wet nor too dry. They can be found in habitats that vary from overgrazed areas with dense bush to open woodland floodplains. In East Africa, the blue wildebeest is the most abundant big game species, both in population and biomass. It is a notable feature of the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania, the Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya and the Liuwa Plain National Park in Zambia.|$|E
5|$|Narcosis {{results from}} {{breathing}} gases under elevated pressure, {{and may be}} classified by the principal gas involved. The noble gases, except helium and probably neon, as well as nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen cause a decrement in mental function, but their effect on psychomotor function (processes affecting the coordination of sensory or cognitive processes and motor activity) varies widely. The effects of carbon dioxide consistently result in a diminution of mental and psychomotor function. The noble gases argon, krypton, and xenon are more narcotic than nitrogen at a given pressure, and xenon has so much anesthetic activity {{that it is a}} usable anesthetic at 80% concentration and normal atmospheric pressure. Xenon has historically been too expensive to be used very much in practice, but it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>successfully</b> used for surgical operations, and xenon anesthesia systems are still being proposed and designed.|$|E
