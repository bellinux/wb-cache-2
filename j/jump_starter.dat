50|$|Jump {{starters}} using {{lithium-ion batteries}} began {{appearing in the}} marketplace in 2013. Most lithium <b>jump</b> <b>starter</b> brands use a high discharge lithium polymer or lithium-ion battery. Lithium jump starters are extremely compact and lightweight (as much as 90% smaller than its lead-acid equivalents).|$|E
5000|$|In the 2014 {{election}} cycle, McKenzie was the Democratic nominee in Michigan's 11th congressional district. When {{he launched}} his campaign in late October 2013, former Congressman Patrick Murphy (PA-D) referred to McKenzie as [...] "a fantastic candidate -- a top-tier {{candidate for the}} DCCC (Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee) -- and he'll be an even better congressman...He'll {{be one of the}} top 10 recruits in the country for the DCCC." [...] In December 2013, the DCCC added McKenzie to its elite <b>jump</b> <b>starter</b> program. McKenzie won the Democratic nomination in the primary on August 5, 2014. In late September 2014, The Hill named McKenzie one of five sleeper races to watch in the country. The DCCC had reserved 1 million dollars in media ad buys for McKenzie for the general election. McKenzie lost in the general election to David Trott, by a margin of 140,435 votes to 101,681 votes (56.2% to 40.7%). The 2014 election cycle had the worst voter turnout in 72 years in America, which contributed to a crushing blow for Democrats across the country.|$|E
50|$|<b>Jump</b> <b>starters</b> are {{portable}} battery devices {{that allow for}} jump starting of vehicles. These devices operate similar to jumper cables but do not require an additional vehicle to provide the power needed to boost the dead vehicle battery. <b>Jump</b> <b>starters</b> come in various sizes (typically rated in Amps). Most <b>jump</b> <b>starters</b> {{on the market today}} use lead-acid batteries and claim 400 to 1700 Amps ratings. The main disadvantage of lead-acid <b>jump</b> <b>starters</b> is weight, size and battery chemistry. Lead-acid <b>jump</b> <b>starters</b> can be extremely heavy and large, making them less than convenient when transporting between vehicles. Lead-acid batteries may self-discharge develop a condition called sulfating, which permanently loses battery capacity. It is entirely possible to destroy a new lead-acid battery within months that will require a replacement.|$|R
50|$|A hand-portable battery, {{equipped}} with attached cables and charger, {{can be used}} similarly to another vehicle's battery.A self-contained jump box contains a battery and connects directly to the battery of the engine that needs a boost. Portable boosters may automatically sense the battery's polarity prior to sending power to the vehicle, eliminating the damage that can result from reversing the connection. There are various portable <b>jump</b> <b>starters</b> that are multi-functional {{and can be used}} to charge other electronic devices as well.|$|R
50|$|In Game 1, the Orioles <b>jumped</b> on Oakland <b>starter</b> Vida Blue and {{reliever}} Horacio Piña {{for four}} {{runs in the}} bottom of the first inning. Jim Palmer pitched a 5-hit shutout as the Orioles won, 6-0.|$|R
25|$|In Game 3, Cubs pitcher Ed Reulbach {{scattered}} six hits as Chicago <b>jumped</b> on Tiger <b>starter</b> Ed Siever {{for four}} runs on seven hits in only four innings. Johnny Evers had three hits, including two doubles, as the Cubs took a 2–0 {{lead in the}} series.|$|R
25|$|Against Canada on March 9, Italy {{pulled off}} one of the more {{surprising}} upsets in the 2009 WBC, winning 6–2, and eliminating the heavily favored Canadian team. Italy led 3–0 heading into the fourth inning, until Canada <b>jumped</b> on <b>starter</b> Dan Serafini for two runs. With the bases loaded and only one out, reliever Chris Cooper struck out Peter Orr, then got Chris Barnwell to fly out to center to end the threat, and keep Italy in the lead. In all, Italy's bullpen pitched six innings without giving up a run.|$|R
50|$|The Mets <b>jumped</b> on Cardinals <b>starter</b> Darryl Kile {{right from}} the outset. Rookie Timo Pérez led off {{the game with a}} double into the right field corner, and {{following}} a walk to Edgardo Alfonzo, scored on a double by Mike Piazza. A Robin Ventura sacrifice fly would plate Alfonzo, and the Mets were off and running.|$|R
40|$|Growing the {{business}} inorganically {{is a very}} attractive option {{for a lot of}} companies. The trouble is mergers and acquisitions (M&A) are not <b>jump</b> <b>starters</b> or quick fix solutions in most cases. In 2011 alone there were M&A transactions that were in the range of USD $ 2. 18 trillion (merger market, 2011) Looking at the sheer size of M&A deals one wonders if it is as attractive at all in reality? Based on significant M&A analysis over the last 40 years it is estimated that about 45 - 82 % of the M&A transactions fail. ((cf. Kitching, 1967; Jensen & Ruback, 1983; Hunt, 1990; Jarrell & Poulsen, 1994; Mueller, 2003). So the obvious question is why some of the M&A deals succeed? There has not been much research around identifying the causes and failures of these big M&A deals. The biggest issue with merger transactions is the case of integration issues apart from identifying the right targets at the right price. (Christensen et al, 2011) This paper aims to {{look at one of the}} game changing acquisitions in the A&D industry history – Merger between Boeing and Mc Donnell Douglas. A marriage between a largely civilian company with a defence firm. Did this merger successful in achieve transformational growth or was it more of an alliance fixed by the US government in a political move to preserve the dominance of the US players in defence industry on the wave of consolidation...|$|R
50|$|In 1931, he {{lost the}} Trophy in {{dramatic}} circumstances to his younger brother George. The race was held on the Detroit River and was billed as a match race between the Wood brothers and English (sic) racing driver and record-breaker Kaye Don, driving Miss England II. Before an estimated crowd of over a million spectators (one of the largest crowds for a sporting event ever), Don won the first heat of the race. In the second heat, Wood was leading Don, when Miss England II suddenly flipped over rounding one of the turns, fortunately without injury to Don and his co-driver. Gar Wood finished the race first, but both he and Don were disqualified because they had <b>jumped</b> the <b>starter's</b> gun by seven seconds. George Wood completed the final race to win the trophy.|$|R
50|$|The Mets would {{once again}} stake {{themselves}} {{to an early}} lead, <b>jumping</b> on Cardinals <b>starter</b> Pat Hentgen in the first inning. Again it was Timo Pérez sparking the Mets, singling under the glove of Édgar Rentería, stealing second base and moving to third when catcher Carlos Hernández's throw went into center field. Edgardo Alfonzo would single home Perez. Following a walk to Mike Piazza, Robin Ventura would single home Alfonzo for the Mets' second run. The Mets would add a third run on a fielder's choice by Todd Zeile.|$|R
50|$|The Cardinals gave starter Danny Cox a quick 4-0 lead by <b>jumping</b> on Giants <b>starter</b> Atlee Hammaker in the second. Singles by Terry Pendleton, Tony Peña and Willie McGee {{produced}} the first run and José Oquendo, who had hit only one home run {{during the regular}} season, drilled a three-run shot to left. St. Louis added two more runs in the sixth on a two-run single by Tommy Herr. Cox went the distance, scattering eight hits and striking out five. The victory gave the Cardinals their third pennant in six years and fifteenth overall. The only downside in the victory was Pendleton suffering a strained ribcage while running the bases, which limited his availability in the World Series.|$|R
50|$|In 1931, a race on the Detroit River {{was billed}} as a match between the Wood brothers, Gar (in the new Miss America IX) and George (in the {{previous}} years Miss America VIII), and the Englishman Kaye Don, driving Miss England II. In front of an estimated crowd of over a million spectators, Don won the first heat of the race. Miss America IX had suffered hull damage from Miss Englands wake and, despite overnight repairs, she was barely ready the next day. Wood requested a delay to allow the repairs to be completed, something {{to which he had}} previously conceded. Don stuck to the rules, which according to one author still rankled with some Americans in 2003. Miss America IX made it to the second heat, but only by Wood racing flat-out to the start line. Wood had a narrow lead over Don when Miss England II suddenly flipped over rounding one of the turns, fortunately without injury to Don and his co-driver. Wood finished the race, but both he and Don were disqualified because they had <b>jumped</b> the <b>starters</b> gun by seven seconds. George Wood completed the final race to win the trophy.|$|R
5000|$|In 1931 Don was {{selected}} {{to compete in the}} Harmsworth Trophy Race on the Detroit River. Billed as a match between the Wood brothers, Gar (in the new Miss America IX) and George (in last years Miss America VIII), and the [...] "Englishman" [...] Kaye Don, driving Lord Wakefields powerboat Miss England II. While preparing for the race, Gar Wood became the first man to exceed 100 mi/h km/h limit on water but three days later, Kaye Don became a new water speed world record holder by beating Wood by just 1.25 mi/h km/h. Before an estimated crowd of over a million spectators, Don also won the first heat of the race. Miss America IX had suffered hull damage from pounding through Miss Englands wake. Despite working overnight, she was barely ready the next day and Wood requested a delay to allow repairs to be completed, something hed previously been known to concede to. Don stuck to the rules though, a matter which still rankles with some today. Miss America IX made it to the second heat, but only by Wood racing flat-out to the start line, a mistake that cost him dearly later on. During another close race, Wood was leading Don when Miss England II suddenly flipped over rounding one of the turns, fortunately without injury to Don and his co-driver. Gar Wood finished the race first, but both he and Don were disqualified because they had <b>jumped</b> the <b>starters</b> gun by seven seconds. George Wood completed the final race to win the trophy.|$|R
