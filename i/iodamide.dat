50|$|The company {{founded by}} Elio Bracco was {{established}} in 1927 in Milan with the name Società Italiana Prodotti E Merck, to produce, package and sell the chemical products of the German company E. Merck. It had just five employees.In 1934 Fulvio Bracco, Elio’s son, officially joined the company which, the same year, began marketing Cebion, an innovative product based on vitamin C, recently discovered by Hungarian professor Szent-Györgyi. In 1962 Bracco researchers created the first contrast agent based on their original research: <b>iodamide,</b> a product with very high tolerability.On 17 March 1977 Diana Bracco, Fulvio’s daughter, was appointed Bracco General Manager.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} {{diagnostic}} image quality between three different water soluble iodinated contrast media in hysterosalpingography (HSG). Material and method: In a prospective randomised study of 204 patients, the diagnostic quality of images obtained after hysterosalpingography were evaluated using Iopramide (106 patients) and Ioxaglate (98 patients). 114 {{patients who had}} undergone HSG examination using <b>Iodamide</b> were analysed retrospectively. Image quality was assessed by three radiologists independently based on an objective set of criteria. The obtained results were statistically analysed using Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U test. Results: Visualisation of fimbrial rugae was significantly better with Iopramide and Ioxaglate than <b>Iodamide.</b> All contrast media provided acceptable diagnostic image quality with regard to uterine, fallopian tubes outline and peritoneal spill. Uterine opacification was noted to be too dense in all three contrast media and not optimal {{for the assessment of}} intrauterine pathology. Higher incidence of contrast intravasation was noted in the <b>Iodamide</b> group. Similarly, the numbers of patients diagnosed with bilateral blocked fallopian tubes were also higher in the <b>Iodamide</b> group. Conclusion: HSG using low osmolar contrast media (Iopramide and Ioxaglate) demonstrated diagnostic image qualities similar to HSG using conventional high osmolar contrast media (<b>Iodamide).</b> However, all three contrast medi...|$|E
40|$|A {{double-blind}} {{comparison of}} meglumine <b>iodamide</b> and Renografin 60 (52 % meglumine diatrizoate and 8 % sodium diatrizoate) for bolus excretory urography was performed. Doses of 0. 8 cc/kg. {{to a maximum}} of 55 cc were administered to fifty patients, twenty-five receiving each drug. There is a suggestion that <b>iodamide</b> may be superior to diatrizoate in pyelocalyceal opacification while being equal to diatrizoate in parenchymal opacification and in types and severity of side-effects...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{intravenous}} administration of ionic contrast media on local release of prostacyclin (PGI 2) {{was investigated in}} man. <b>Iodamide</b> and ioxaglate, high- and low-osmolality contrast media, respectively, both significantly increased PGI 2 levels {{at the site of}} injection. <b>Iodamide</b> was the most active, whereas an identical volume of isotonic saline had no effect. This study suggests that local formation of PGI 2 may adequately reflect the degree of endothelial irritation that is caused by contrast media and that depends in part on their osmolality. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Vascular endothelial {{injuries}} {{induced by}} intravascular administration of radiographic contrast agents may be clinically {{relevant to the}} development of thrombosis and platelet activation. In this connection, we investigated the in vitro effects induced by <b>iodamide,</b> iopamidol, and ioxaglate on vascular endothelial ADPase activity and tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) release in bovine aortic endothelium, in order to extend knowledge required to evaluate endothelial compatibility of radiographic contrast media. Undiluted and Tris-diluted contrast agent formulations were employed, and mannitol and sucrose hyperosmolar solutions were used as comparison. Results demonstrated that the high-osmolar ionic contrast agent <b>iodamide,</b> and to a lesser extent, the low-osmolar nonionic agent iopamidol, stimulated endothelial ADPase activity of the aortic endothelium; the low-osmolar ionic agent ioxaglate left endothelial ADPase activity unchanged. Furthermore, the diluted formulations of <b>iodamide</b> and iopamidol, as well as high-osmolar mannitol and sucrose solutions, were devoid of activity in ADPase. This suggests that the endothelial ADPase stimulation induced by both radiographic contrast media was a hyperosmolar-independent pharmacodynamic activity. Iopamidol and ioxaglate reduced endogenous t-PA release from bovine aortic endothelium only in undiluted formulation, while <b>iodamide</b> showed this inhibiting action in both diluted and undiluted formulations. No effect was observed when using mannitol solutions at different osmolarity values. Our in vitro findings agree with published data on the different thrombotic tendency attributed to the contrast agents used, suggesting endothelial enzymatic activities (ADPase and t-PA release) as suitable tools for evaluating endothelial vessel wall compatibility with radiographic contrast media...|$|E
40|$|A {{simple method}} to {{visualize}} the rat kidney is described. Under ether anesthesia 0. 2 ml ofmeglumine <b>iodamide</b> (64. 9 %, solution of 3 -acetamide-methyl- 5 -acetamide- 2, 4, 6 -triiodobenzoic acid) for 100 gm of body weight is injected by the percutaneous transcardiac way. Satisfactory pyelogram is obtained in rats by this way. The immediate film reveals nephrogram and those taken between 5 and 15 minutes after the injection give pyelogram...|$|E
40|$|Drip {{infusion}} pyelography {{was performed}} with 100 ml of a 64. 9 per cent methylglucamine <b>iodamide</b> solution diluted {{with the same}} volume of a 5 per cent glucose solution in 96 cases in which visualization by routine intravenous pyelography was unsatisfactory or entirely absent, and its diagnostic contribution and safety were studied. By this technique better urograms were obtained than those by routine intravenous pyelography. Fine urograms could be obtained even in cases with ureteral obstruction, in post-operative cases of uretero-vesical anastomosis or in cases of children. This was quite helpful because retrograde pyelography was impossible {{in any of these}} cases. Diagnostic urograms were obtained in about 50 per cent of the cases with unilateral renal disease in which visualization was unsatisfactory or absent by routine intravenous pyelography, and in 43 per cent of the cases with renal impairment with BUN less than 40 mg/dl. In these cases, therefore, retrograde pyelography was omitted. Regarding safety, there were no severe side effects and the influence on pulse, blood pressure, BUN, serum electrolytes and renal function was slight. Particularly it was relatively safe in the cases with renal insufficiency. It can be concluded, accordingly, that drip infusion pyelography with 100 ml of a 64. 9 per cent <b>iodamide</b> solution is safe and it can be regarded as an excellent technique of urography...|$|E
40|$|Drip {{infusion}} pyelography (DIP) {{was carried}} out with 200 ml of Conraxin D (a 32. 45 per cent methylglucamine <b>iodamide</b> solution) in 72 cases including 13 cases of renal insufficiency, and its diagnostic availability and safety were studied. As for the diagnostic availability, a good urogram was obtained in about 60 per cent of the cases, when total renal function was normal, and in 75 per cent of the {{cases in which the}} BUN was 25 to 40 mg/ 100 ml and the serum creatinine value was 2. 0 to 3. 5 mg/ 100 ml, so that retrograde pyelography could be omitted in these cases. As for the safety, side effects were encountered in 37. 5 per cent of the cases, though they were not serious. The effect on the cardiovascular system was examined by means of changes in the blood pressure and pulse, but almost no effect was observed. It showed no marked effect on the renal function, serum electrolytes and liver functions. This was true even in all the cases of renal insufficiency. From these facts, Conraxin D is believed to be a contrast medium which can safely be used for DIP. Other favorable aspects of Conraxin D are that it {{does not need to be}} diluted before DIP, and rapid drip infusion can easily be carried out being finished within 10 minutes, even if a relatively narrow needle of 19 gauge is used, because of its low viscosity as 1. 72 cps at 25 ℃, so it is suitable for DIP. Conraxin D is, therefore, quite suitable for DIP...|$|E
