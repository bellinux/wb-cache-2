40|$|Purpose- The aim of {{this study}} is to examine whether {{frequency}} of audit <b>committee</b> <b>meetings</b> and attendance in audit committee are associated with accrual earnings management. Design/methodology/approach- The sample of the study is 14 companies under the Industrial Goods sub-sector listed under the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) for the years 2012 - 2014. Modified Jones Model (1995) was used to measure earnings management proxied by discretionary accruals. Findings- The findings show that frequency of audit <b>committee</b> <b>meetings</b> and attendance during the meetings negatively and significantly associated with discretionary accruals. Theoretical implications- This study extends the previous related literature by examining the association between audit <b>committee</b> <b>meetings</b> and attendance and earnings management. Practical implications- Regulators might use the findings of the study to regulate and further control the attendance of audit committee members during audit <b>committee</b> <b>meetings.</b> Originality/value- This paper uses agency theory to provide empirical evidence on the importance of frequent audit <b>committee</b> <b>meetings</b> and higher attendance in audit <b>committee</b> <b>meetings...</b>|$|R

40|$|This study {{contributes}} to the policy debate about independent audit committees by examining the occurrence and consequences of CEO attendance-by-invitation at audit <b>committee</b> <b>meetings.</b> We investigate {{whether this is a}} way for powerful CEOs to exert their influence over audit committee matters or an informal channel for information sharing between management and audit committees. We find that CEO attendance-by-invitation at audit <b>committee</b> <b>meetings</b> is positively related to firm complexity and firm governance practices, and is associated with lower earnings opacity. These results are consistent with CEO attendance-by-invitation at audit <b>committee</b> <b>meetings</b> enhancing information sharing between firm management and audit committees. Thus, this study identifies significant benefits from allowing CEOs to act as informal advisors at audit <b>committee</b> <b>meetings...</b>|$|R
