25|$|The lipids {{found in}} <b>green</b> <b>coffee</b> include: {{linoleic}} acid, palmitic acid, oleic acid, stearic acid, arachidic acid, diterpenes, triglycerides, unsaturated long-chain fatty acids, esters, and amides. The total content of lipids in dried <b>green</b> <b>coffee</b> is between 11.7 and 14 g/100 g. Lipids are {{present on the}} surface and in the interior matrix of <b>green</b> <b>coffee</b> beans. On the surface, they include derivatives of carboxylic acid-5-hydroxytryptamides with an amide bond to fatty acids (unsaturated C6 to C24) making up to 3% of total lipid content or 1200 to 1400 microgram/g dried <b>green</b> <b>coffee</b> bean. Such compounds form a wax-like cover {{on the surface of the}} coffee bean (200 to 300mg lipids/100g dried <b>green</b> <b>coffee</b> bean) protecting the interior matrix against oxidation and insects. Further, such molecules have antioxidative activity due to their chemical structure. Lipids of the interior tissue are triglycerides, linoleic acid (46% of total free lipids), palmitic acid (30% to 35% of total free lipids), and esters. Arabica beans have a higher content of lipids (13.5 to 17.4g lipids/100g dried <b>green</b> <b>coffee</b> beans) than robustas (9.8 to 10.7g lipids/100g dried <b>green</b> <b>coffee</b> beans). The content of diterpenes is about 20% of the lipid fraction. The diterpenes found in <b>green</b> <b>coffee</b> include cafestol, kahweol and 16-O-methylcafestol. Some of these diterpenes have been shown in in vitro experiments to protect liver tissue against chemical oxidation. In coffee oil from <b>green</b> <b>coffee</b> beans the diterpenes are esterified with saturated long chain fatty acids.|$|E
25|$|When <b>green</b> <b>coffee</b> {{beans are}} roasted, other {{molecules}} with the typical pleasant aroma of coffee are generated, {{which are not}} present in fresh <b>green</b> <b>coffee.</b> During roasting, the {{major part of the}} unpleasant-tasting volatile compounds are neutralised. Unfortunately, other important molecules such as antioxidants and vitamins present in <b>green</b> <b>coffee</b> are destroyed. Volatile compounds with nauseating odor for humans have been identified, including acetic acid (pungent, unpleasant odor), propionic acid (odor of sour milk, or butter), butanoic acid (odor of rancid butter, present in <b>green</b> <b>coffee</b> with 2mg/100g coffee beans), pentanoic acid (unpleasant fruity flavor, present in <b>green</b> <b>coffee</b> at 40mg/100g in coffee beans), hexanoic acid (fatty-rancid odor), heptanoic acid (fatty odor), octanoic acid (repulsive oily rancid odor); nonanoic acid (mild nut-like fatty odor); decanoic acid (sour repulsive odor), and derivatives of such fatty acids – 3-methyl-valeric acid (sour, green-herbaceous, unpleasant odor), acetaldehyde (pungent-nauseating odor, even when highly diluted, present in dried <b>green</b> <b>coffee</b> beans at concentrations of about 5mg/kg), propanal (choking effect on respiratory system, penetrating-nauseating), butanal (nauseating effect, present in dried <b>green</b> <b>coffee</b> beans at 2 to 7mg/kg), or pentanal (very repulsive nauseating effect).|$|E
25|$|Carbohydrates make {{up about}} 50% of the dry weight of <b>green</b> <b>coffee</b> beans. The {{carbohydrate}} fraction of <b>green</b> <b>coffee</b> is dominated by polysaccharides, such as arabinogalactan, galactomannan, and cellulose, contributing to the tasteless flavor of <b>green</b> <b>coffee.</b> Arabinogalactan makes up to 17% of dry weight of <b>green</b> <b>coffee</b> beans, with a molecular weight of 90 kDa to 200 kDa. It is composed of beta-1-3-linked galactan main chains, with frequent members of arabinose (pentose) and galactose (hexose) residues at the side chains comprising immunomodulating properties by stimulating the cellular defense system (Th-1 response) of the body. Mature brown to yellow coffee beans contain fewer residues of galactose and arabinose at the side chain of the polysaccharides, making the <b>green</b> <b>coffee</b> bean more resistant to physical breakdown and less soluble in water. The molecular weight of the arabinogalactan in coffee is higher than in most other plants, improving the cellular defense system of the digestive tract compared to arabinogalactan with lower molecular weight. Free monosaccharides are present in mature brown to yellow-green coffee beans. The free part of monosaccharides contains sucrose (gluco-fructose) up to 9000mg/100g of arabica <b>green</b> <b>coffee</b> bean, a lower amount in robustas, i.e. 4500mg/100g. In arabica <b>green</b> <b>coffee</b> beans, the content of free glucose was 30 to 38mg/100g, free fructose 23 to 30mg/100g; free galactose 35mg/100g and mannitol 50mg/100g dried coffee beans, respectively. Mannitol is a powerful scavenger for hydroxyl radicals, which are generated during the peroxidation of lipids in biological membranes.|$|E

25|$|Proteins {{account for}} 8% to 12% of dried <b>green</b> <b>coffee</b> beans. A {{majority}} of the proteins are of the 11-S storage kind (alpha – component of 32 kDa, beta – component of 22 kDa), {{most of which are}} degraded to free amino acids during maturation of <b>green</b> <b>coffee</b> beans. Further, 11-S storage proteins are degraded to their individual amino acids under roasting temperature, thus are an additional source of bitter components due to generation of Maillard reaction products. High temperature and oxygen concentration and low pH degrade 11-S storage proteins of <b>green</b> <b>coffee</b> beans to low-molecular-weight peptides and amino acids. The degradation is accelerated in the presence of organic acids such as chlorogenic acids and their derivatives. Other proteins include enzymes, such as catalase and polyphenol oxidase, which are important for the maturation of <b>green</b> <b>coffee</b> beans. Mature coffee contains free amino acids (4.0mg amino acid/g robusta coffee and up to 4.5mg amino acid/g arabica coffee). In Coffea arabica, alanine is the amino acid with the highest concentration, i.e. 1.2mg/g, followed by asparagine of 0.66mg/g, whereas in C. robusta, alanine is present at a concentration of 0.8mg/g and asparagine at 0.36mg/g. The free hydrophobic amino acids in fresh <b>green</b> <b>coffee</b> beans contribute to the unpleasant taste, making it impossible to prepare a desirable beverage with such compounds. In fresh <b>green</b> <b>coffee</b> from Peru, these concentrations have been determined as: isoleucine 81mg/kg, leucine 100mg/kg, valine 93mg/kg, tyrosine 81mg/kg, phenylalanine 133mg/kg. The concentration of gamma-aminobutyric acid (a neurotransmitter) has been determined between 143mg/kg and 703mg/kg in <b>green</b> <b>coffee</b> beans from Tanzania. Roasted coffee beans do not contain any free amino acids; the amino acids in <b>green</b> <b>coffee</b> beans are degraded under roasting temperature to Maillard products (reaction products between the aldehyde group of sugar and the alpha-amino group of the amino acids). Further, diketopiperazines, e.g. cyclo(proline-proline), cyclo(proline-leucine), and cyclo(proline-isoleucine), are generated from the corresponding amino acids, and are the major source of the bitter taste of roasted coffee. The bitter flavor of diketopiperazines is perceptible at around 20mg/liter of water. The content of diketopiperazines in espresso is about 20 to 30mg, which is responsible for its bitterness.|$|E
25|$|Trigonelline (N-methyl-nicotinate) is a {{derivative}} of vitamin B6 {{that is not}} as bitter as caffeine. In <b>green</b> <b>coffee</b> beans, the content is between 0.6% and 1.0%. At a roasting temperature of , 85% of the trigonelline is degraded to nicotinic acid, leaving small amounts of the unchanged molecule in the roasted beans. In <b>green</b> <b>coffee</b> beans, trigonelline is synthesized from nicotinic acid (pyridinium-3-carboxylic acid) by methylation from methionine, a sulfur-containing amino acid. Mutagenic activity of trigonelline has been reported.|$|E

25|$|Next, {{the coffee}} is sorted, and labeled as <b>green</b> <b>coffee.</b> Another {{way to let}} the coffee seeds dry is to let them sit on a {{concrete}} patio and rake over them in the sunlight. Some companies use cylinders to pump in heated air to dry the coffee seeds, though this is generally in places where the humidity is very high.|$|E
25|$|Chlorogenic acids {{belong to}} a group of {{compounds}} known as phenolic acids, which are antioxidants. The content of chlorogenic acids in dried <b>green</b> <b>coffee</b> beans of robusta is 65mg/g and of arabica 140mg/g, depending on the timing of harvesting. At roasting temperature, more than 70% of chlorogenic acids are destroyed, leaving a residue less than 30mg/g in the roasted coffee bean. In contrast to <b>green</b> <b>coffee,</b> green tea contains an average of 85mg/g polyphenols. These chlorogenic acids could be a valuable, inexpensive source of antioxidants. Chlorogenic acids are homologous compounds comprising caffeic acid, ferulic acid and 3,4-dimethoxycinnamic acid, which are connected by an ester bond to the hydroxyl groups of quinic acid. The antioxidant capacity of chlorogenic acid is more potent than of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) or mannitol, which is a selective hydroxy-radical scavenger. Chlorogenic acids have a bitter taste in low concentrations such as 50mg/l water. At higher concentrations of 1g/l water, they have a sour taste. Chlorogenic acids increase the solubility of caffeine and are important modulators of taste.|$|E

25|$|Coffee {{berries and}} their seeds undergo several {{processes}} {{before they become}} the familiar roasted coffee. Berries have been traditionally selectively picked by hand; a labor-intensive method, it involves the selection of only the berries {{at the peak of}} ripeness. More commonly, crops are strip picked, where all berries are harvested simultaneously regardless of ripeness by person or machine. After picking, <b>green</b> <b>coffee</b> is processed by one of two methods—the dry process method, simpler and less labor-intensive as the berries can be strip picked, and the wet process method, which incorporates fermentation into the process and yields a mild coffee.|$|E
25|$|The {{next step}} in the process is the {{roasting}} of the <b>green</b> <b>coffee.</b> Coffee is usually sold in a roasted state, and with rare exceptions all coffee is roasted before it is consumed. It can be sold roasted by the supplier, or it can be home roasted. The roasting process influences the taste of the beverage by changing the coffee bean both physically and chemically. The bean decreases in weight as moisture is lost and increases in volume, causing it to become less dense. The density of the bean also influences the strength of the coffee and requirements for packaging.|$|E

25|$|The {{advantages}} of supercritical fluid extraction (compared with liquid extraction) {{are that it}} is relatively rapid because of the low viscosities and high diffusivities associated with supercritical fluids. The extraction can be selective to some extent by controlling {{the density of the}} medium, and the extracted material is easily recovered by simply depressurizing, allowing the supercritical fluid to return to gas phase and evaporate leaving little or no solvent residues. Carbon dioxide is the most common supercritical solvent. It is used on a large scale for the decaffeination of <b>green</b> <b>coffee</b> beans, the extraction of hops for beer production, and the production of essential oils and pharmaceutical products from plants. A few laboratory test methods include the use of supercritical fluid extraction as an extraction method instead of using traditional solvents.|$|E

25|$|The {{precursor}} of the Folger Coffee Company {{was founded in}} 1850 in San Francisco, California, U.S., as the Pioneer Steam Coffee and Spice Mills. The owner, William H. Bovee, saw an opportunity to produce roasted and ground coffee ready for brewing. Before that, Californians had to purchase <b>green</b> <b>coffee</b> beans, and roast and grind them on their own. To help build his mill, Bovee hired James A. Folger as a carpenter. James had arrived from Nantucket Island {{at the age of}} 15 with his two older brothers during the California Gold Rush. In the 1850s, kerosene began to offer a cheaper alternative to whale oil, which had been Nantucket's life-blood, resulting in the re-purposing of many of its ships to bring coffee from South America to San Francisco. After working at Bovee’s mill for nearly a year, James had saved enough money to stake a claim in the company and headed out to mine for gold. He agreed to carry along samples of coffee and spices, taking orders from grocery stores along the way. Upon his return to San Francisco in 1865, James became a full partner of The Pioneer Steam Coffee and Spice Mills. In 1872, he bought out the other partners and renamed the company to J.A. Folger & Co.|$|E
2500|$|Caffeine (1,3,7-trimethyl-xanthine) is the {{alkaloid}} most {{present in}} green and roasted coffee beans. The content of caffeine is between 1.0% and 2.5% by weight of dry <b>green</b> <b>coffee</b> beans. The content of caffeine {{does not change}} during maturation of <b>green</b> <b>coffee</b> beans. Lower concentrations of theophylline, theobromine, paraxanthine, liberine, and methylliberine can be found. The concentration of theophylline, an alkaloid noted for its presence in green tea, is reduced during the roasting process, usually about 15 minutes at , whereas the concentrations of most other alkaloids are not changed.
