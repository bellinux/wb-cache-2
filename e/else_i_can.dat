As {{for me and my}} companions, we were so awe-struck yet amused at these comical shapes, that we could not move or speak until they themselves seemed to flit about in a sort of wavering dance, and then vanish, one by one.|$|E

He stated: “I’ve never had, never sought, never received citizenship of another country but out of an abundance of caution I wrote to the Greek embassy and Cypriot high commission saying essentially, ‘I’ve never been a citizen, I don’t want to be, so if there’s any question that I could be, I renounce any rights to be’. I don’t know what <b>else</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do in the circumstances.” He added that he had not received replies to these enquiries. Later he said he had renounced Greek citizenship but, on finding he might be British, he had sought clarification from British authorities. On 19 August, he announced that British authorities had confirmed he is a British Overseas citizen, a lesser form of British nationality. He stated that he would not resign from the Parliament, but would await a High Court decision. Together with that of Nash, Xenophon's case was referred to the Court on 4 September.|$|E

Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine said that [...] "the breezy island vibe and soft demeanor of 'Eh, Eh (Nothing <b>Else</b> <b>I</b> <b>Can</b> Say)' is hard to buy when sandwiched between songs like 'Poker Face' and 'Beautiful, Dirty, Rich.'" [...] In another article analysing about the music videos released by Gaga, Oscar Moralde from Slant Magazine noted that [...] "Eh, Eh" [...] as a track [...] "is an intriguing case: rather than the tech-assisted sexy-androgynous dance pop that dominates a good chunk of The Fame, it and its sister tracks 'Brown Eyes' and 'Again Again' are evidence of a stripped-down, simpler, sincere Gaga.|$|E
