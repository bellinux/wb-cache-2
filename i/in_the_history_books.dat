25|$|For a {{long while}} Birkenshaw's {{performances}} for Leicestershire were rather disappointing. In his first six years at the club he never took more than 27 wickets in a season, {{and he had to}} rely on some useful lower-order contributions with the bat to keep his place in the side. He earned a place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>books</b> by playing (exclusively as a batsman) in the pioneering Midlands Knock-Out Cup limited-overs tournament in 1962.

Losses continued to mount for the Suns as their losing streak reached an astonishing 21 matches and began to put coach Guy McKenna's future in question. The Gold Coast showed faith in McKenna by re-signing him for a further two years during the losing streak.

25|$|The {{foundation}} {{was laid}} for the 1979/80 season, one that goes down <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>books</b> as the club's greatest. Stan Davis {{took over the}} reigns of the first eleven, and immediately led them to a long-awaited premiership. Bowling first, Jungwirth's 4/39 help dismiss Ainslie Park for just 124, which was passed {{for the loss of}} just 3 wickets, with John Chapman making 66. But a middle order collapse saw them lose 7/49, and with the final spread over 3 days, the game was far from won. But Max Summers and Stan Davis shared a last wicket stand of 83 to take the game away from the opposition, and they went on to win by 10 wickets. The club achieved its only senior trifecta, with the 2nd and 3rd elevens also victorious. And capping off a stunning season, were victories to both under 12s sides that included future stars in Michael and Cameron Day, Colin Dorning, Tony Sturesteps, Darren Peters, Brendan Baker and Greg Creber.|$|E

But during the season he was still able to play another 28 games for Feyenoord, where he scored a total of 12 goals, and thereby {{qualified}} to become the top scorer of Feyenoord. With his good performance on the field, he helped Feyenoord to achieve a fourth place in the Eredivisie, and qualify the club to play the final in the Dutch cup. The final was played as a double match, and clearly lost with a total score of 6–1 to Ajax, but Tomasson left a mark of his name <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>books,</b> by scoring the one and only goal for Feyenoord. During the World Championships 2010, he was unfortunately hit by another serious injury, that spoiled his first half of the 2010–11 season for Feyenoord. According to the medical staff at Feyenoord, the injury was a lot worse than original thought. When they tried to get him ready for a game at 15 August, the injury had not entirely healed; and after a too hard training session, it therefore reappeared at its previous strength. Based upon further examination of the injury, the coach now feared that Tomasson only would be ready to play his first game of the season in January 2011.|$|E

500|$|After days {{of media}} speculation, it was {{confirmed}} on September 6, 2007 that Spears {{would open the}} 2007 MTV Video Music Awards at the Pearl Theatre in the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas on September 9, 2007. It was also announced {{that she was going}} to perform [...] "Gimme More", with a magic act from illusionist Criss Angel in some parts of the performance. However, the bit is thought to have been rejected by the show's organisers at the last minute. The performance began with Spears lip synching the first lines of Elvis Presley's 1958 song [...] "Trouble". [...] "Gimme More" [...] began, and the camera panned out to reveal Spears wearing a black, jewel-encrusted bikini and black boots. She was accompanied by male and female dancers dressed in black outfits. Several pole dancers danced in smaller stages around the audience. The performance was universally panned by critics. Jeff Leeds of The New York Times said that [...] "no one was prepared for Sunday night's fiasco, in which a listless Ms. Spears teetered through her dance steps and mouthed only occasional words in a wan attempt to lip-synch her new single". Vinay Menon of the Toronto Star commented Spears [...] "looked hopelessly dazed. She was wearing the expression of somebody who had been deposited at the Palms Casino Resort by a tornado, one that promptly twisted away, taking her clothing and sense of purpose. [...] lumbering, in slow motion, as if somebody had poured cement into her streetwalker boots". David Willis of BBC stated her performance would [...] "go down <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>books</b> as being one of the worst to grace the MTV Awards".|$|E
