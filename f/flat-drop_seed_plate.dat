40|$|Abstract. This {{study was}} carried out to analyze the dynamic {{characteristics}} of the <b>seed</b> <b>plate</b> which is {{the main part of}} the vacuum precision planter. The vacuum precision planter is a working machine which is attached to a tractor. The vacuum pump is operated by PTO-shaft which rotates in three types; 540 rpm (9 Hz), 750 rpm(12. 5 Hz) and 1, 000 rpm(16 Hz). Seeds are sucked into the holes of the <b>seed</b> <b>plate</b> by vacuum, and then they are transported by rotation. At that time, the mode shape of <b>seed</b> <b>plate</b> is important because dynamic characteristics of the <b>seed</b> <b>plate</b> decide <b>seeding</b> rates. If the natural frequency of <b>seed</b> <b>plate</b> corresponds with the frequency of PTO-shaft, the resonance occurs. For this reason, modal analysis of the <b>seed</b> <b>plate</b> was made with FlexPDE(PDE solutions, inc) and ANSYS(ANSYS, inc). Mode shape was observed for 5 th mode. First, modal analysis of the <b>seed</b> <b>plate</b> was performed by FlexPDE. According to the result of FlexPDE, natural frequency of each mode was obtained 35. 7 Hz, 35. 8 Hz, 45. 3 Hz, 60. 8 Hz and 61. 0 Hz respectively. The other modal analysis of the <b>seed</b> <b>plate</b> was performed by ANSYS. As a result of the ANSYS analysis, natural frequency of each mode was obtained 35. 6 Hz, 36. 0 Hz, 45. 6 Hz, 60. 9 Hz and 61. 1 Hz respectively. The results of the FlexPDE and ANSYS were similar. Natural frequency of the <b>seed</b> <b>plate</b> was confirmed by the above results. So, it was confirmed that the resonance didn't happen by comparing the frequency of PTO-shaft and natural frequency of <b>seed</b> <b>plate.</b> In conclusion, the vacuum precision planter is expected to efficiently sow...|$|R
40|$|Background For {{study with}} obligate anaerobes, inoculated plates {{containing}} suitable reduced media need handling and incubation under strict anaerobic condition. Instead of ensuring a confined oxygen free chamber for placing <b>seeded</b> <b>plates,</b> same purpose may {{be achieved by}} creating total air barrier to the surface. Method Upper moist surface of freshly prepared anaerobic media in Petri plates were intimately covered with very thin transparent bacteriological inert sterile polyester sheets. Stock culture of Bacteroides fragilis, ATCC 23745 and Clostridium sporogenes, ATCC 11437 were grown in cooked meat broth and then sub-cultured on respective plates, after lifting the cover sheets. Sheets were again covered and incubated at 37 o C ordinary incubator. To perform antimicrobial susceptibility test, similarly covered <b>seeded</b> <b>plates</b> with well inoculums were inverted en-block after stripping sides {{with the help of}} a spatula.

40|$|Several {{factors are}} known to {{increase}} the noise and variability of cell-based assays used for high-throughput screening. In par-ticular, edge effects can result in anunacceptably highplate rejection rate in screening runs. In an effort tominimize these vari-ations, the authors analyzed {{a number of factors}} that could contribute to edge effects in cell-based assays. They found that pre-incubation of newly <b>seeded</b> <b>plates</b> in ambient conditions (air at room temperature) resulted in even distribution of the cells in eachwell. In contrast, when newly seeded plateswere placed directly in theCO 2 incubator, an uneven distribution of cells oc-curred inwells around the plate periphery, resulting in increased edge effect. Here, the authors show that the simple, inexpen-sive approach of incubating newly <b>seeded</b> <b>plates</b> at room temperature before placing them in a 37 ° C CO 2 incubator yields a significant reduction in edge effect.

40|$|The use of <b>seed</b> <b>plates</b> during {{directional}} solidification (DS) of Quasimono silicon ingots causes additional yield losses compared to standard multi-crystalline ingots {{due to an}} increased area of low minority carrier lifetime ("red-zone") in the bottom region. This effect is attributed in literature mainly to iron impurities which are contaminating the seed crystal during heat up and afterwards the as-grown ingot during solidification. However, the contamination mechanisms itself are still not completely understood. Therefore, in this work the seed contamination mechanisms by iron and their effect on the lifetime distribution in the bottom region of Quasimono silicon ingots were investigated. For this purpose special crystal growth experiments in a laboratory-scale DS furnace were carried out by using diffusion barriers at the crucible/seed and seed/melt interfaces in order to separate the different contamination paths. The {{results show that the}} iron diffusion path from the crucible into the <b>seed</b> <b>plates</b> plays an important role. But in addition to this it will be demonstrated that an even more important iron contamination path is by gas phase transport from furnace parts via the furnace atmosphere to the seed crystals...|$|R

40|$|On {{the basis}} of their {{susceptibility}} to ampicillin, strains of Haemophilus influenzae can be divided into three types: type 1 are normally susceptible strains, type 2 produce stable spheroplasts from low inocula, and type 3 are β-lactamase producers. Because of the production of spheroplasts, standard broth and agar dilution techniques have failed to differentiate between the responses of type 2 and 3 strains to ampicillin, or to identify the superiority of cefuroxime over ampicillin against the β-lactamase-producing strains. Disk susceptibility tests with heavily <b>seeded</b> <b>plates</b> were also difficult to interpret. To overcome these problems, we developed a medium that supports the growth of H. influenzae, but not survival of spheroplasts, thereby reducing the complicating influence of spheroplast formation. Utilization of the medium made it possible to identify β-lactamase-producing strains via both minimal inhibitory concentration and disk susceptibility techniques, as well as the superiority of cefuroxime over ampicillin against such strains. In vivo experiments showed that cefuroxime and ampicillin are equally active against infections with type 1 and 2 strains, but that cefuroxime is superior to ampicillin against infections with type 3 β-lactamase-producing strains...|$|R

Phage levels were still very low (1 plaque-forming unit on AM 1 per 10 induced cells) in induced lysates of R 1 cultures.
