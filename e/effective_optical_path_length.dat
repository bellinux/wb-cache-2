The modulation pattern of absorption is produced in the 3 D plot as scanning the thicknesses of both layers as a result of modulation of interference between incoming and reflected light, which can be secured by changing the <b>effective</b> <b>optical</b> <b>path</b> <b>length</b> between two electrodes of a photovoltaic device.

40|$|Sensing {{chirality}} is {{of fundamental}} importance to many fields, including analytical and biological chemistry, pharmacology, and fundamental physics. Recent developments have extended optical chiral sensing using microwaves, fs pulses, superchiral light, and photoionization. The {{most widely used}} methods are the traditional methods of circular dichroism and optical rotation (OR). However, chiral signals are typically very weak, and their measurement is limited by larger time-dependent backgrounds and by imperfect and slow subtraction procedures. Here, we demonstrate a pulsed-laser bowtie-cavity-enhanced polarimeter with counter-propagating beams, which solves these background problems: the chiral signals are enhanced {{by the number of}} cavity passes; the effects of linear birefringence are suppressed by a large induced intracavity Faraday rotation; and rapid signal reversals are effected by reversing the Faraday rotation and subtracting signals from the counter-propagating beams. These advantages allow measurements of absolute chiral signals in environments where background subtractions are not feasible: we measure optical rotation from chiral vapour in open air, and from chiral liquids in the evanescent wave (EW) produced by total internal reflection at a prism surface. EW-OR of (+) -maltodextrin and (-) -fructose solutions confirm the Drude-Condon model for Maxwell's equations in isotropic optically active media. In particular, the <b>effective</b> <b>optical</b> rotation <b>path</b> <b>length,</b> near index matching, is equal to the Goos-Hänchen shift of the EW. The limits of this polarimeter, when using a continuous-wave laser locked to a stable high-finesse cavity, should match sensitivity measurements for linear birefringence (3 × 10 ^- 13 rad), which is several orders of magnitude more sensitive than current chiral detection limits, transforming the power of chiral sensing in many fields...|$|R

A key benefit of laser-based cell lysis is the very limited zone (less than 5  μm) of lysis. A second asset is the rapid cell lysis times (approx. microseconds). These features enable two analytes, fluorescein and Oregon Green, from a cell to be electrophoretically separated in the channel in which cell lysis occurred.

The effects of the distance between source and detector, and of the optical properties of the probed tissues, on the sensitivity of the optical measurement to deep layers of the adult head were investigated. The spatial sensitivity profiles of photons in the head, the so-called banana shape, and the partial mean optical path lengths in the skin-scalp and brain tissues were calculated, so that the contribution of different parts of the head to near-infrared spectroscopy signals could be examined.

A sensitivity improvement technique is proposed for a class of bulk-glass optical current sensors that employ a ferromagnetic field concentrator. The total <b>effective</b> <b>optical</b> <b>path</b> <b>length</b> is demonstrated theoretically to be an invariant regardless of the bulk glass thickness and consequently independent {{of the size of the}} concentrator gap opening. Thus, if the magnetic field is increased by reducing the gap size, the eventual Faraday rotation for a given electric current can be increased proportionally, leading to an improved device sensitivity. The dependence of the gap magnetic field on gap size is calculated with an equivalent circuit model, and this analytical treatment is compared with a dedicated finite element computer package. By taking account of various types of optical power losses present in the bulk glass, the above formulated gap dependence of magnetic field is used to aid a realistic assessment of device sensitivity and this serves as a tool to design and analyze practical bulk-glass optical current sensors.

Two kinds of metal reflectors are fabricated: the conventional planar reflectors by evaporated Al and the novel scattering reflectors by self assembled Ag nanoparticles. We find that the thickness dependence of rear SiO 2 layer (from 8 nm – 134 nm) on photocurrent shows an asymmetry for planar and scattering reflectors, moreover, the scattering reflectors perform {{much better than the}} planar reflectors under all tested SiO 2 thicknesses. A maximum current enhancement (calculated from wavelength 900 nm to 1200 nm) of 12. 1 % is presented for planar reflector with 134 nm SiO 2 film, and 18. 4 % for scattering reflector with the optimized 19 nm rear SiO 2 film.

The instrument is well suited for use in either cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) [in which one pulses an incident light beam and measures the rate of decay of light in the cavity] or integrated cavity output spectroscopy (ICOS) [in which one uses a continuous-wave incident light beam and measures the power of light in the cavity as a function of wavelength]. Typically, in optical absorption spectroscopy, one seeks to measure absorption of a beam of light in a substance (usually a gas or liquid) in a sample cell. In CRDS or ICOS, the sample cell is placed in (or consists of) an optical cavity, so that one can utilize multiple reflections of the beam to increase the <b>effective</b> <b>optical</b> <b>path</b> <b>length</b> through the absorbing substance and thereby increase the sensitivity for measuring absorption.

The ICAM can produce an <b>effective</b> <b>optical</b> <b>path</b> <b>length</b> up to several meters. As a consequence, {{it is capable of}} measuring absorption coefficients as low as 0. 001 m- 1. The early version of the ICAM was used previously to measure the absorption spectrum of pure water over the 380 - 700 nm range. To extend its range into the ultraviolet, several modifications have been completed. The preliminary tests showed that the modified ICAM was able to measure the absorption of pure water for the wavelength down to 300 nm. After extensive experimental investigation and analysis, we found that the absorption of Spectralon???? (the highly diffusive and reflective material used to build the ICAM) has a higher impact on measurements of absorption in the UV range than we had expected. Observations of high values for pure water absorption in the UV, specifically between 300 and 360 nm, are a consequence of absorption by the Spectralon????. These results indicated that even more serious modifications were required (e. g. Spectralon???? can not be used for a cavity in the UV). Consequently, we developed a new diffuse reflecting material and used fused silica powder (sub-micron level) sealed inside a quartz cell to replace the inner Spectralon???? cavity of the ICAM. The new data is in excellent agreement with the Pope and Fry data (380 - 600 nm) and fills the gap between the 320 nm data of Quickenden and Irvin and 380 nm data of Pope and Fry.

However, reducing material thickness typically lowers optical absorption, leading to lower cell efficiency. One proven method for enhancing absorption in a thin device is by texturing interfaces, typically achieved in the top transparent conducting oxide (TCO) of a thin-film design. This works by scattering transmitted light and therefore increasing its <b>effective</b> <b>optical</b> <b>path</b> <b>length</b> within the absorber layer. However, introducing rough surfaces to a PV device can lead to fabrication issues and also increases surface recombination which is detrimental to the electrical characteristics of the end device. In recent years, possible alternatives to reliance on random texturing have been found through the use of optimized diffraction gratings and the plasmonic effects of metal nanoparticles. In this work, comprehensive optical characterization has been carried out on a range of samples using traditional and novel techniques. In particular, a custom built wavelength and angle resolved scattering (WARS) measurement system has been developed and used to determine key characteristics that would remain undetected by conventional measurements. The investigation of several commercial and experimental TCO films has been carried out and clear links between topography and optical characteristics have been determined. These textured surfaces have also been modelled using finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations which have shown good agreement with measurement results. This has allowed for further investigation of the effects of TCO topography through simulation which has revealed that scattering is best enhanced by increasing the aspect ratio of the texture rather than the overall scale. Periodic arrays of silver nanoparticles incorporated into a thin-film solar cell back-reflector design have also been extensively characterized and modelled and shown to provide scattering through both diffraction and plasmonic mechanisms, leading to an increase in useful absorption by up to 140 % in comparison to a planar device...|$|E
40|$|Solar {{energy is}} the most {{abundant}} source of renewable energy available. The relatively high cost prevents solar photovoltaic (PV) from replacing fossil fuel on a larger scale. In solar PV power generation the cost is reduced with more efficient PV technologies. In this dissertation, methods to improve PV conversion efficiency with holographic optical components are discussed. The tandem multiple-junction approach has achieved very high conversion efficiency. However {{it is impossible to}} manufacture tandem PV cells at a low cost due to stringent fabrication standards and limited material types that satisfy lattice compatibility. Current produced by the tandem multi-junction PV cell is limited by the lowest junction due to series connection. Spectrum-splitting is a lateral multi-junction concept that is free of lattice and current matching constraints. Each PV cell can be optimized towards full absorption of a spectral band with tailored light-trapping schemes. Holographic optical components are designed to achieve spectrum-splitting PV energy conversion. The incident solar spectrum is separated onto multiple PV cells that are matched to the corresponding spectral band. Holographic spectrum-splitting can take advantage of existing and future low-cost technologies that produces high efficiency thin-film solar cells. Spectrum-splitting optical systems are designed and analyzed with both transmission and reflection holographic optical components. Prototype holograms are fabricated and high optical efficiency is achieved. Light-trapping in PV cells increases the effective optical path-length in the semiconductor material leading to improved absorption and conversion efficiency. It has been shown that the <b>effective</b> <b>optical</b> <b>path</b> <b>length</b> can be increased by a factor of 4 n 2 using diffusive surfaces. Ultra-light-trapping can be achieved with optical filters that limit the escape angle of the diffused light.

Results from an experimental reflection hologram are used to model the absorption enhancement factor for a silicon solar cell and light-trapping filter.

40|$|This system {{presented}} in this thesis report will be put into practice in a sensory system for dental drilling. The aim of this system is to provide real-time feedback to the practitioner about the anatomical structure in close vicinity of the drill bit. Therefore, the system {{has to deal with}} in vivo, in situ bone tissue, bone tissue within a living organism that cannot be removed from the human body for analysis. Hence, non-destructive biopsy is desired. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) imaging is able to provide optical biopsy at a high resolution and in real time. With the use of Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), e. g. blood vessels, nerves and sinuses close to the drill can be detected before the drill bit does damage to these vulnerable anatomical structures. Silicon process technology offers a promising platform for a relatively cheap Time-Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (TD-OCT) system. A first step into the direction of a single-chip TD-OCT system is the development of a thermally excited Optical Delay Line (ODL) or Thermo-Optical Delay Line (TODL). This thesis project is dedicated to the characterisation of the TODL in order to find the voltage excitation waveform that results in a linear variation in <b>effective</b> <b>optical</b> <b>path</b> <b>length.</b> By making use of the models, non-linearites can be compensated and the limited bandwidth can be extended by pre-emphasis of the voltage excitation waveform. Two models are presented, based on the general heat equation for conduction. One model utilizes Fourier analysis to solve the heat equation and is a linear model by definition. The second model uses numerical methods and is able to incorporate non-linearities, such as relations for thermal conductivity, diffusivity and the variation of the refractive index of silicon as a function of temperature. Measurements are conducted to verify the modeling. The linear model has been shown to perform poorly. The non-linear model was able to compensate for the non-linearities mentioned. However, first results showed that the TODL was behaving slightly slower than expected. The non-linear model was corrected for this behaviour by scalling down the relation for thermal diffusivity. The corrected non-linear model achieved a linear variation of the effective optical path lenght over a scanning range of 200 ?m at a line scanning rate of 10 kHz.

The major drawbacks of using such techniques to decrease intrinsic solar cell loss mechanisms are twofold: first, {{it is difficult to}} maintain partially populated states using QDs due to a quick thermal extraction of carriers; second, QDs have a weak absorption which necessitates a near-perfect control of QD growth mechanisms to carefully ensure a balance between dot size and density. One avenue for improving absorption into QDs is to utilize a thin cell with a back surface reflector in order to increase the <b>effective</b> <b>optical</b> <b>path</b> <b>length</b> (OPL) of light through the QD region, which has the potential to increase absorption into QD states. One method for the processing of thin solar cells that has been experimentally demonstrated on large 4 - 6 ” wafers is epitaxial lift-off, which takes advantage of an inverted growth and a wet chemical etch of a sacrificial release layer to remove the substrate. In this thesis, 0. 25 cm 2 InAs/GaAs QD cells were grown on 4 ” wafers, fabricated, and processed by epitaxial lift off, creating thin and flexible devices. Materials and optical characterization techniques such as atomic force microscopy and photoluminescence were used on test structures prior to and following ELO, and analysis indicated that QD optical coherence and material quality after ELO processing were preserved, although non-uniform. This was concluded to be caused by the radial thermal profile of the growth reactor, through which spatial dependence led to local variations in QD quality and size across the 4 ” wafer, indicative of the high temperature sensitivity of QDs. Transmission electron microscopy measurements were used to investigate defects and dislocations throughout the QD device structure that would impact performance, and showed a higher concentration of defects in regions of the wafer subject to a higher temperature during growth. A similar pattern of radial dependence was observed in solar cell devices by electrical characterization. Current-voltage measurements under one-sun AM 0 illumination were taken on several cells around the wafer, showing a statistical variation in solar cell device metrics dependent on wafer position. Spectral responsivity measurements show an established cavity mode pattern in sub-host bandgap wavelengths, which is discussed as an enhancement due to the thinning of the device. Integrated external quantum efficiency shows a QD contribution to the short circuit current density of 0. 23 mA/cm 2. In addition to optical, materials, and electrical characterization, QD and baseline ELO devices were exposed to alpha radiation to gauge the effects of a harmful environment on cell performance. The QD device exhibited a remaining factor increase of 2 % (absolute) in conversion efficiency over the baseline device at an end of life alpha particle fluence of 5 x 109 α/cm 2 /s. In addition, linear temperature coefficients for solar cell figures of merit were extracted as a function of increasing α fluence. At a fluence of 5 x 108 α/cm 2 /s, the QD device showed an efficiency temperature coefficient 0. 2 %/°C higher (absolute) than the baseline, indicating that the inclusion of QDs could improve the radiation and temperature tolerance of solar cell devices used for space applications...|$|E
50|$|<b>Optical</b> <b>path</b> <b>length</b> (OPL) is {{the product}} of the {{geometric}} length d of the path light follows through a system, and the index of refraction of the medium through which it propagates,This is an important concept in optics because it determines the phase of the light and governs interference and diffraction of light as it propagates. According to Fermat's principle, light rays can be characterized as those curves that optimize the <b>optical</b> <b>path</b> <b>length.</b>|$|R

There is however a wavelength dependent component to the atmospheric turbulence, which can introduce <b>optical</b> <b>path</b> <b>length</b> errors when observing at a wavelength {{different from that of}} the fringe sensing camera. Water vapor in particular is highly dispersive and its effect must be taken into account for high-precision infrared interferometric observations as described previously for VLTI/MIDI or the Keck Interferometer Nuller.
