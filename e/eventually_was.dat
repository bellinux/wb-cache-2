5|$|The {{disadvantages}} of the turbine were eventually overcome. The solution which <b>eventually</b> <b>was</b> generally adopted was the geared turbine, where gearing reduced the rotation {{rate of the}} propellers and hence increased efficiency. This solution required technical precision in the gears and hence was difficult to implement.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{governing}} {{of skiing}} in Canada was {{split between the}} Canadian Amateur Ski Association (CASA) and the Western Canada Amateur Ski Association (WCASA). Nelsen was the latter's president, and after years of rivalry, which even {{reached the point where}} they did not recognize each other, Nelsen <b>eventually</b> <b>was</b> part of the negotiation for an amalgamation which took into consideration the needs of the western clubs. Nelsen subsequently became vice-president of CASA from 1934.|$|E
5|$|A {{complication}} arose when Venancio Sanchez of St. Augustine {{purchased for}} US$400 a half {{share in the}} old Fornells grant from another surviving heir, who lived in Havana. A feud quickly developed between Sanchez and the Davises, with Sanchez demanding {{a division of the}} property, and the Davises refusing to acknowledge that Sanchez had any claim to the island. The Davises had hoped that a restored lighthouse would be the centerpiece of their town, but all attempts to repair the lighthouse failed while the war was on. Shortly {{after the end of the}} war, the Davises gave up on Key Biscayne and moved to Texas. Their older son Edmund J. Davis <b>eventually</b> <b>was</b> elected as governor there.|$|E

5|$|After {{leaving the}} WWF in 1990, Smith {{was married to}} a man named Harvey Zitron. Zitron was sentenced to 81 months in federal prison for 10 counts of filing false tax returns, {{identity}} theft and access device fraud.

During the midst of their title reign, despite being billed as villains, Demolition's popularity with fans continued to grow, and the tag team <b>eventually</b> <b>was</b> turned face 3 months after SummerSlam at the 1988 Survivor Series.|$|E
5|$|King Edward died in 1553, {{followed}} by the accession of Mary I of England, who opposed the Protestant reformers. Vermigli was placed under house arrest for six months, and his Catholic opponents at Oxford would likely have had him executed, as Cranmer <b>eventually</b> <b>was</b> in 1556. Despite this risk, he agreed to a public disputation with Cranmer against the new Catholic establishment, but this never came to fruition because Cranmer was imprisoned. Vermigli was able to receive permission from the Privy Council to leave England, and was advised by Cranmer to do so.|$|E

5|$|Sharp's {{political}} {{service was}} interrupted by the War of 1812. On September 18, 1812, he enlisted as a private in the Kentucky militia, serving under Lieutenant Colonel Young Ewing. Twelve days later, in a rapid rise even for the militia, {{he was promoted to}} major and made a part of Ewing's staff. Ewing's unit was put under the command of general Samuel Hopkins during his ineffective expedition against the Shawnee. In total, the expedition lasted forty-two days and never engaged the enemy. Sharp recognized the value of a record of military service in Kentucky politics, however; he was <b>eventually</b> <b>was</b> promoted to the rank of colonel.|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{heaviest}} fighting took place near {{the intersection of}} Wschodnia and Południowa (now Rewolucji 1905 r.) streets (where four barricades were located), near the Scheibler factory in the Źródliska park and on the Rokociny road (al. Piłsudskiego). The Rokociny area was manned by a 3,000-strong worker militia, which <b>eventually</b> <b>was</b> forced to retreat to the Źródliska park. The insurgents had no organized agenda, and commonly fought under red standards; common demands were the improvement of workers' living conditions and greater rights for the Polish population. On 23 June (or as late as 26 June – sources vary) the Tsar signed a decree of martial law in the city.|$|E
5|$|The {{next two}} seasons {{would be a}} {{regression}} for both the team and Sanchez as they failed to reach the playoffs. Fans and media critics called for a struggling Sanchez to be benched. He <b>eventually</b> <b>was</b> replaced {{towards the end of}} the 2012 season by Greg McElroy. Sanchez suffered a season-ending shoulder injury during the preseason in 2013; he was released after the season concluded and was subsequently signed by the Philadelphia Eagles. When Philadelphia's starter Nick Foles went down with an injury, Sanchez started the second half of the season for the Eagles, where he set career highs in completion percentage and passer rating, while also passing for 2,418 yards despite only starting 8 games.|$|E

5|$|Union {{infantry}} attacked {{from the}} east side of the battlefield, while most of the cavalry attacked from the south and west. Capehart's brigade attacked from the southwest, and <b>eventually</b> <b>was</b> on the extreme western side of the battlefield. At times, the cavalry fought dismounted, with their horses led at a safe distance behind. The opposing forces were always within range of the Union cavalry carbines, keeping the weapon's seven-shot advantage—and not enabling the Confederate infantry to utilize the advantage of their longer range weapons.|$|E
5|$|When {{games for}} the 2001 college {{football}} season were scheduled, Virginia Tech was picked to host the annual Black Coaches & Administrators Classic, the opening game of the national Division I-A season. Georgia Tech was picked as the opponent, but {{on the day of}} the game, severe lightning storms hit the Blacksburg, Virginia area.

5|$|While {{scholars}} {{have proposed a}} number of hypotheses {{to explain why the}} poem was written, a definitive answer to this question remains elusive. But regardless of Proba's intent, there is evidence that the poem was widely circulated, and it <b>eventually</b> <b>was</b> used in schools to teach the tenets of Christianity, alongside Augustine of Hippo's De Doctrina Christiana. Critical reception to the poem, however, was more mixed. A pseudonymous work purportedly by Pope Gelasius I disparaged the poem, deeming it apocryphal. Many also believe that St. Jerome disliked the poem. At the same time, others like Isidore of Seville, Petrarch, and Giovanni Boccaccio wrote highly of Proba. During the 19th and 20th centuries the poem was criticized as being of poor quality, but recent {{scholars have}} written more positively about it.|$|E
