5|$|The {{preference}} for sons over daughters in India {{is rooted in}} social, economic and religious reasons. Women are often believed to be of a lower value in society due to their non-breadwinner status. Financial support, old age security, property inheritance, dowry and beliefs surrounding religious duties all contribute to the preference of sons over daughters. One {{of the main reasons}} behind the preference of sons is the potential burden of having to find grooms for daughters. Families of women in India often <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> dowry and all expenses related to marriage in order to marry off a daughter, which increases the cost associated with having a daughter.|$|E
5|$|After a {{long night}} of drinking, Homer and Grampa awaken and {{discover}} that they bought the pub from Tom O'Flanagan during the previous night's binge, much to their shock and dismay. They rename the bar and try to continue running it but get no business and {{have to find a}} way to market their unwelcoming business. Homer gets help from Moe Szyslak, who suggests that they allow people to do illegal things in their pub. They find out that smoking is now banned from Irish pubs and Moe urges the Simpsons to turn it into a smokeasy. They do a roaring trade, but are closed down by the Irish authorities. As a punishment, Homer and Grampa are deported back to America and <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> small fine. Chief Wiggum arrives to bring them back to the U.S., but accidentally hits himself with his nightstick and then Maces and Tasers himself.|$|E

25|$|Non-Muslims {{would also}} <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> {{traditional}} special tax known as jizya. Under Maududi's Islamic state, this tax would {{be applicable to}} all able-bodied non-Muslim men—elderly, children and women being exempt—in return from their exemption from military service, (which all adult Muslim men would be subject to). Those who {{serve in the military}} are exempted. Non-Muslims would also be barred from holding certain high level offices in the Islamic state. Jizya is thus seen as a tax paid in return for protection from foreign invasion, but also as a symbol of Islamic sovereignty.|$|E

25|$|Public {{universities}} in Germany are {{funded by the}} federal states and do not charge tuition fees. However, all enrolled students do <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> semester fee (Semesterbeitrag). This fee consists of an administrative fee for the university (only {{in some of the}} states), a fee for Studentenwerk, which is a statutory student affairs organization, a fee for the university's AStA (Allgemeiner Studentenausschuss, students' government) and Studentenschaft (students' union), at many universities a fee for public transportation, and possibly more fees as decided by the university's students' parliament (e.g., for a cooperation with a local theater granting free entry for students). Summed up, the semester fee usually ranges between €150 and €350.|$|E
25|$|Harvest was in {{the late}} spring and during the dry summer months. Nomadic Amorites from the {{northwest}} would pasture their flocks of sheep and goats to graze on the stubble and be watered from the river and irrigation canals. For this privilege, they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> tax in wool, meat, milk, and cheese to the temples, who would distribute these products to the bureaucracy and priesthood. In good years, all would go well, but in bad years, wild winter pastures would be in short supply, nomads would seek to pasture their flocks in the grain fields, and conflicts with farmers would result. It {{would appear that the}} subsidizing of southern populations by the import of wheat from the north of the Empire temporarily overcame this problem, and it seems to have allowed economic recovery and a growing population within this region.|$|E
25|$|Both {{boys and}} girls could {{experience}} sexual harassment although girls experienced it more frequently. Members of the school community sexually harassed girls in and around school. Jobless men, unmarried men looking for partners or sex, and married men looking for sex, sexually harassed girls {{on their way to}} and from school. In some cases, this could involve sexual assault and rape. Girls in the 10 to 19 year age group were most affected. Rape perpetrators could be diverse men in the community or men passing through the community. When rape occurred at home, perpetrators included uncles, cousins, fathers and stepfathers. Girls could be abducted for marriage which meant the man did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> bride price. Some compensation might be paid to the girl's parents so they would acknowledge the marriage. Parents could arrange an early or forced marriage against the girl's wishes to continue her education.|$|E

During the climax of Tsubasa, Watanuki and Syaoran <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> price to survive Fei-Wang's dying curse with Watanuki's price being able to stay in the shop. From this he becomes the new master of the shop and takes up Yūko's job of granting wishes to the shop's customers during the last volume from xxxHolic subtitled xxxHolic Rō. His personality changes as he adopts some of Yūko's quirks and habits. He works with help from Domeki who brings him materials from outside. Over the following years, Watanuki's powers become stronger since he retains his ability to see spirits. His lifespan also increases, though he has the appearance of a teenager. More than a hundred years after taking over the shop, Watanuki's powers grow strong enough to allow him to leave the shop, but he decides to remain there and continue to fulfill the promise he made to Yūko.|$|E
25|$|Like his renowned British tenor {{predecessors}} Sims Reeves and Edward Lloyd, Coates had a famously protective wife. Moore {{refers to}} Coates' home life as serene, with an adorable spouse, sons and daughters; but he thought, despite Coates's good humour, {{he was not}} a happy person because he {{was too much of a}} worrier. Coates developed financial headaches, too. He wasted a good deal of money in a legal case that he launched against the Performing Right Society, in which he argued that he should not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> royalty to perform music in public which had been brought to him in manuscript, and which therefore, by agreeing to sing it, Coates had encouraged the publishers to publish. He lost the case, and it preyed on his mind and finances for long after, though he refused offers of financial support from other singers. In his last years he thought of going back on the stage and started to slim, but he was seized with anaemia and became permanently confined to bed, frustrated at being unable to assist his country as the Second World War took hold. In July 1940, Gerald Moore presented a half-hour broadcast in tribute to their work together, and received a last letter from him in friendship and gratitude.|$|E
