50|$|In the United States, {{the reasons}} the CDC is recommending the {{detection}} of carbapenem resistance or carbapenemase production only for Klebsiella spp. and E. coli are: this facilitates performing the test in the microbiology laboratory {{without the use of}} molecular methods, and these organisms represent the majority of CREs encountered in the United States. <b>Effective</b> <b>sterilization</b> and decontamination procedures are important to keep the infection rate of this antibiotic-resistant strain, CRKP, as low as possible.|$|E
50|$|It {{is never}} {{possible}} {{to prove that}} all organisms have been destroyed, as the likelihood of survival of an individual microorganism is never zero. So SAL is used to express the probability of the survival. For example, medical device manufacturers design their sterilization processes for an extremely low SAL, such as 10−6, which is a 1 in 1,000,000 chance of a non-sterile unit. SAL also describes the killing efficacy of a sterilization process. A very <b>effective</b> <b>sterilization</b> process has a very low SAL.|$|E
50|$|There {{are four}} main {{ways in which}} such items can be sterilized: {{autoclave}} (by using high-pressure steam), dry heat (in an oven), by using chemical sterilants such as glutaraldehydes or formaldehyde solutions or by radiation (with the help of physical agents). The first two are the most used methods of sterilizations mainly because of their accessibility and availability. Steam sterilization {{is one of the}} most effective types of sterilizations, if done correctly which is often hard to achieve. Instruments that are used in health care facilities are usually sterilized with this method. The general rule in this case is that in order to perform an <b>effective</b> <b>sterilization,</b> the steam must get into contact with all the surfaces that are meant to be disinfected. On the other hand, dry heat sterilization, which is performed with the help of an oven, is also an accessible type of sterilization, although it can only be used to disinfect instruments that are made of metal or glass. The very high temperatures needed to perform sterilization in this way are able to melt the instruments that are not made of glass or metal.|$|E

40|$|Advanced {{biomaterials}} {{and sophisticated}} processing technologies aim to fabricate tissue-engineering scaffolds that can predictably interact within a biological environment at a cellular level. Sterilization of such scaffolds {{is at the}} core of patient safety and is an important regulatory issue that needs to be addressed prior to clinical translation. In addition, it is crucial that meticulously engineered micro- and nano- structures are preserved after sterilization. Conventional sterilization methods involving heat, steam and radiation are not compatible with engineered polymeric systems because of scaffold degradation and loss of architecture. Using electrospun scaffolds made from polycaprolactone (PCL), a low melting polymer, and employing spores of Bacillus atrophaeus as biological indicators, we compared ethylene oxide, autoclaving and 80 % ethanol to a known chemical sterilant, peracetic acid (PAA), for their ability to sterilize as well as their effects on scaffold properties.

40|$|BACKGROUND: There is a {{need for}} cheap and efficacious wound {{dressings}} in developing countries.

As a natural product, banana leaves are heavily contaminated with various pathogens that must be removed before they can be used as wound dressings, but <b>effective</b> <b>sterilization</b> methods that do not affect the beneficial wound-dressing properties of banana leaves have not been described. OBJECTIVES: To study different sterilization methods and determine which can be used on banana leaves without affecting their beneficial wound-dressing properties.

40|$|Background: Acinetobacter baumannii complex (A. baumannii) {{has been}} {{isolated}} worldwide. The rapid spread of multidrug-resistant A. baumannii complex (MDRAB) in clinical settings has made choosing an appropriate antibiotic to treat these infections and executing contact precautions difficult for clinicians. Although controlling {{the transmission of}} MDRAB is {{a high priority for}} institutions, there is little information about MDRAB control. Therefore, this study evaluated infection control measures for A. baumannii infections, clusters and outbreaks in the literature. Methods: We performed a review of OVID Medline (from 1980 to 2015), and analyzed the literature. Results: We propose that both infection control programs and antibiotic control programs are essential for control of MDRAB. The first, effective control of MDRAB infections, requires compliance with a series of infection control methods including strict environmental cleaning, <b>effective</b> <b>sterilization</b> of reusable medical equipment, concentration on proper hand hygiene practices, and use of contact precautions, together with appropriate administrative guidance. The second strategy, effective antibiotic control programs to decrease A. baumannii, is also of paramount importance.

40|$|We have {{developed}} an effective post-PCR sterilization process and have applied the procedure to a diagnostic assay for HIV- 1. The method, {{which is based on}} isopsoralen photochemistry, satisfies both the inactivation and hybridization requirements of a practical sterilization process. The key feature of the technique is the use of isopsoralen compounds which form covalent photochemical adducts with DNA. These covalent adducts prevent subsequent extension of previously amplified sequences (amplicons) by Taq polymerase. Isopsoralens have minimal inhibitory effect on the PCR, are activated by long wavelength ultraviolet light, provide sufficient numbers of covalent adducts to impart <b>effective</b> <b>sterilization,</b> modify the amplified sequence such that it remains single-stranded, and have little effect on subsequent hybridization. The sterilization procedure can be applied to a closed system and is suitable for use with commonly used detection formats.

For this purpose, the experimental design methodology was employed to evaluate the effects of pressure (8 – 28  MPa), depressurization rate (1 – 11  MPa min− 1) and pressure cycling (1 – 5 cycles) on the microorganism inactivation using the static-synthetic method in a variable-volume reactor. The number of pressure cycles and system pressure showed a significant influence on E.  coli inactivation with supercritical CO 2, indicating that {{the increase in the number}} of pressure cycles and system pressure improve inactivation efficiency. Microbial inactivation followed first order reaction kinetics, where the rates increased with increasing pressure from 8 to 16  MPa. The decimal reduction times (D) ranged from 1. 03 to 5. 35  min.
