25|$|Vincent's DNA mutates as {{the season}} progresses, as he becomes more beast-like. He begins {{experiencing}} black-outs, which J.T. associates with Catherine's interference. Cat and Vincent will stop at nothing to see each other, however. Assistant District Attorney Gabriel Lowen visits Cat's precinct to investigate the beast-like attack {{in the city and}} over time he reveals that not only <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>know</b> about Muirfield but that he shares the same ability as Vincent. At first an enemy, Gabriel goes on to become an ally to Vincent {{by the end of the}} first season and suggests he has found a cure to the virus inflicted on them by Muirfield. Vincent ultimately wonders if he wants to be cured or not.|$|E

2500|$|Adding to the {{atmosphere}} were the considerable pre-fight theatrics and name calling. Ali portrayed Frazier as a [...] "dumb tool of the white establishment". [...] "Frazier is too ugly to be champ", Ali said. [...] "Frazier is too dumb to be champ." [...] Ali also frequently called Frazier an [...] "Uncle Tom". Dave Wolf, who worked in Frazier's camp, recalled that, [...] "Ali was saying 'the only people rooting for Joe Frazier are white people in suits, Alabama sheriffs, {{and members of the}} Ku Klux Klan. I'm fighting for the little man in the ghetto.' Joe was sitting there, smashing his fist into the palm of his hand, saying, 'What the fuck <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>know</b> about the ghetto? ...|$|E
2500|$|By {{the second}} half of the 18th century Philadelphia had {{developed}} an upper-class society. Many of the families that made up the upper class could trace their lineage to the earliest Quaker settlers, though many of these had subsequently joined the Church of England or Presbyterian denominations. The Philadelphia upper class was exclusive; what mattered was a person's family, not a person's wealth. Inheritance was better than self-made wealth. In the late 19th century Mark Twain observed, [...] "In Boston they ask how much <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>know.</b> In New York, how much is he worth. In Philadelphia, who were his parents." [...] A person could not enter Philadelphia society by acquisition of wealth, but their offspring, if they grew up well and married into the right family, could create a new lineage if the family stayed respectable.|$|E
2500|$|.....think of the {{following}} use of language: I send someone shopping. I give him a slip marked 'five red apples'. He takes the slip to the shopkeeper, who opens the drawer marked 'apples', then he looks up the word 'red' in a table and finds a colour sample opposite it; then he says the series of cardinal numbers—I assume that he knows them by heart—up to the word 'five' and for each number he takes an apple of the same colour as the sample out of the drawer.—It is in this and similar ways that one operates with words—"But how <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>know</b> where and how he is to look up the word 'red' and what he is {{to do with the}} word 'five'?" [...] Well, I assume that he acts as I have described. Explanations come to an end somewhere.—But what is {{the meaning of the word}} 'five'? No such thing was in question here, only how the word 'five' is used.|$|E

Michael Weatherly disclosed, [...] "The way this season is ending, and what's gonna happen with Ziva and Tony and Rivkin, it's pretty massive and explosive, and it's gonna span four episodes." [...] De Pablo added, [...] "We could not be farther away from kissing. I'm telling you, it's not 'I hate you' [...] anger; it's 'I want to kill you' anger. Like, 'I want to shoot you in the head, but instead I'm gonna put my gun on your knee' anger….He does something to her that is almost unforgivable. However, the reason he does it is because he truly believes it's going to help her. Little <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>know</b> that he almost kills her." [...] When asked how the storyline would affect Tony and Ziva's interactions, Tadros replied, [...] "I think that love can hurt and heal. In this case, we'll have opportunity to see both of those things take place. I don't want to say too much, but... I think it will only make their connection stronger, as they learn {{a lot more about}} each other." ...|$|E
2500|$|Njegoš left Cetinje {{in early}} 1833 {{and set out}} on the long journey to Saint Petersburg. He hoped to be granted a meeting with Russian Emperor (czar) Nicholas I and consecrated as Metropolitan of Cetinje by the Holy Synod. Such a move was {{considered}} highly unusual at the time, as a vladika was traditionally consecrated by the Patriarch of Peć either in Patriarchal Monastery of Peć or in Sremski Karlovci, not Saint Petersburg. According to church canon, a vladika could not be any younger than thirty, a prerequisite that the twenty-year-old Njegoš clearly failed to meet. As such, he chose to have his consecration occur in Saint Petersburg out of political necessity, as he desperately needed the czar to bend church canons in his favour in order to acquire total legitimacy at home and brush aside any theological objections. On his way to Saint Petersburg, Njegoš made stops in several Austrian cities. In Vienna, he met famed Serbian language reformer Vuk Stefanović Karadžić. Karadžić was greatly impressed with Njegoš, and in a letter to poet Lukijan Mušicki, he wrote: [...] "Petar Petrović is not yet twenty years old, but is taller and more handsome than any grenadier in Vienna. Not only <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>know</b> Serbian very well to read and write, but he also composes fine verse. He thinks that there is no finer language in the world than our popular tongue (and he's right to think so, even if it were not true)." [...] Njegoš arrived in Saint Petersburg in March 1833 and was consecrated. After the ceremony, the czar granted Njegoš a total of 36,000 rubles, 15,000 of which were to make up for his travel expenses. Standing next to Njegoš as he gave his speech, the czar is said to have commented: [...] "My word, you're bigger than I am." [...] Grateful, the young vladika replied: [...] "Only God is bigger than the Russian czar!" [...] The czar promised Njegoš that Russia would intervene on Montenegro's behalf as if it were one of its own gubernias, while the Holy Synod vowed to provide all the necessary equipment and funds needed to maintain regular religious services in the country.|$|E
