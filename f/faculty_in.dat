5|$|The {{following}} season, {{there was}} a renewal of football at Maryland. Fullback Grenville Lewis was elected as team captain and head coach. He instituted a strict physical training regimen involving calisthenics and long-distance running, and banned smoking, drinking, and eating pie during the football season. This was unpopular with the team, but Lewis was embraced by the students and <b>faculty.</b> <b>In</b> the game to decide the state championship, Maryland Agricultural faced Maryland-Baltimore. Late in the scoreless game, the Aggies pushed to their opponents' two-yard line. With darkness approaching and Maryland Agricultural having difficulty scoring, the referee called the game. It became clear that Maryland-Baltimore had sneaked three extra players onto the field, but the referee refused to award the Aggies the win.

5|$|With {{the death}} of his last {{contemporary}} on the <b>faculty</b> <b>in</b> 1845, Tucker resigned his professorship and moved to Philadelphia, where he enjoyed the availability of more libraries, meetings at the American Philosophical Society and a reunion with his friend Robley Dunglison. Nevertheless, there were drawbacks – for one, the lack of accommodation that slaveholding had brought him—he had emancipated all five of his slaves upon his departure from Charlottesville. He later expressed doubt about the wisdom of the latter decision when he learned that three of them had, by law, been exiled from Virginia, and shortly thereafter died. As well, the two freed slaves who accompanied him to Philadelphia immediately deserted their posts upon arrival there.|$|E

5|$|Roberts {{found it}} {{difficult}} to both study and play hockey, but praised the support of his classmates and the <b>faculty</b> <b>in</b> helping him earn his degree. He had to complete an extra year of schooling after failing his second year, but graduated from McGill in 1916. Following an 18-goal season in 1915–16, he left Montreal to take up practice in British Columbia. Roberts continued his hockey career and joined the Vancouver Millionaires of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA). He led the PCHA in scoring with 43 goals – in 23 games – and was named a league all-star on left wing. His medical career took him to Seattle and as a result, he joined the Seattle Metropolitans for the 1917–18 PCHA season. He retired in 1918 to focus on his medical career in the Howe Sound region of British Columbia, but was lured back to the PCHA by the Millionaires for the 1919–20 season.
