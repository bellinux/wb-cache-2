The new <b>fuel</b> <b>systems</b> provided a significant increase in performance over conventional gasoline <b>fuel</b> <b>systems</b> and eliminated carburetor float problems caused by aggressive combat flying.

40|$|Two {{new methods}} for the {{simulation}} of gas turbine <b>fuel</b> <b>systems,</b> {{one based on}} an inter-component volume (ICV) method, and the other based on the iterative Newton Raphson (NR) method, have been developed in this study. They are able to simulate the performance behaviour {{of each of the}} hydraulic components such as pumps, valves, metering unit of a <b>fuel</b> <b>system,</b> using physics-based models, which potentially offer more accurate results compared with those using transfer functions. A transient performance simulation system has been set up for gas turbine engines based on an inter-component volume (ICV). A proportional- integral (PI) control strategy is used for the simulation of engine control systems. An integrated engine and its control and hydraulic <b>fuel</b> <b>systems</b> has been set up to investigate their coupling effect during engine transient processes. The developed simulation methods and the systems have been applied to a model turbojet and a model turboshaft gas turbine engine to demonstrate the effectiveness of both two methods. The comparison between the results of engines with and without the ICV method simulated <b>fuel</b> <b>system</b> models shows that the delay of the engine transient response due to the inclusion of the <b>fuel</b> <b>system</b> components and introduced inter-component volumes is noticeable, although relatively small. The comparison of two developed methods applied to engine <b>fuel</b> <b>system</b> simulation demonstrate that both methods introduce delay effect to the engine transient response but the NR method is ahead than the ICV method due to the omission of inter-component volumes on engine <b>fuel</b> <b>system</b> simulation. The developed simulation methods are generic and {{can be applied to the}} performance simulation of any other gas turbines and their control and <b>fuel</b> <b>systems.</b> A sensitivity analysis of <b>fuel</b> <b>system</b> key parameters that may affect the engine transient behaviours has also been achieved and represented in this thesis. Three sets of <b>fuel</b> <b>system</b> key parameters have been introduced to investigate their sensitivities, which are, the volumes introduced for ICV method applied to <b>fuel</b> <b>system</b> simulation; the time constants introduced into those first order lags tosimulate the valve movements delay and fuel spray delay effect; and the <b>fuel</b> <b>system</b> key performance and structural parameters...|$|R

2500|$|<b>Fuel</b> <b>systems</b> on {{the modern}} diesel engine were not {{designed}} to accommodate biodiesel, while many heavy duty engines are able to run with biodiesel blends e.g. B20. Traditional direct injection <b>fuel</b> <b>systems</b> operate at roughly 3,000 psi at the injector tip while the modern common rail <b>fuel</b> <b>system</b> operates upwards of 30,000 PSI at the injector tip. Components are designed to operate at a great temperature range, from below freezing to over [...] Diesel fuel is expected to burn efficiently and produce as few emissions as possible. As emission standards are being introduced to diesel engines the need to control harmful emissions is being designed into the parameters of diesel engine <b>fuel</b> <b>systems.</b> The traditional inline injection system is more forgiving to poorer quality fuels {{as opposed to the}} common rail <b>fuel</b> <b>system.</b> The higher pressures and tighter tolerances of the common rail system allows for greater control over atomization and injection timing. This control of atomization as well as combustion allows for greater efficiency of modern diesel engines as well as greater control over emissions. Components within a diesel <b>fuel</b> <b>system</b> interact with the fuel in a way to ensure efficient operation of the <b>fuel</b> <b>system</b> and so the engine. If an out-of-specification fuel is introduced to a system that has specific parameters of operation, then the integrity of the overall <b>fuel</b> <b>system</b> may be compromised. Some of these parameters such as spray pattern and atomization are directly related to injection timing.|$|R

40|$|While solar <b>fuel</b> <b>systems</b> offer {{tremendous}} {{potential to}} address global clean energy needs, most existing analyses {{have focused on}} the feasibility of large centralized systems and applications. Not much research exists on the feasibility of distributed solar <b>fuel</b> <b>systems.</b> This thesis is an attempt to understand the larger context of solar <b>fuel</b> <b>systems,</b> to examine the case for going distributed and to critically analyze a distributed solar <b>fuel</b> <b>system</b> available today {{in the context of a}} specific application. In doing so, this thesis seeks to a) provide a baseline analysis for the economic feasibility of a distributed solar <b>fuel</b> <b>system</b> based on state-of-the-art technology b) draw some general conclusions about the nature of such systems in order to provide guidance to those engaged in the development of the next generation of solar <b>fuel</b> <b>systems.</b> This study also compares the chosen baseline solar <b>fuel</b> <b>system</b> with a traditional fossil fuel-based alternative and undertakes a cost-to-emissions trade-off analysis. A key finding of this thesis is that for solar <b>fuel</b> <b>systems</b> to be viable, cost and efficiency improvements in individual sub-systems won't be sufficient. Due attention needs to be given to bring down cost of the entire system. Another key finding is that if carbon emissions are considered as a decision-making criterion in addition to cost, even at current cost levels photovoltaic hydrogen systems compare favorably with existing fossil fuel-based alternatives such as diesel generators. by Alex Thomas.
