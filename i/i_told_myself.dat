I found it where they told me I would, but it was among 27,000 others, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> that here, Niven, were 27,000 reasons why you should keep your mouth shut after the war.|$|E
500|$|Feng {{also participated}} in the women's team {{competition}} with Li Jiawei and Wang Yuegu. They were beaten 0–3 by Japan in the semifinals, but took the bronze medal by edging out South Korea 3–0. Feng defeated Kim Kyung Ah 11–9, 11–8, 4–11, 13–11, Li also successfully fended off Seok Ha Jung 11–5, 11–8, 6–11, 11–8. Li and Wang then succeeded in the doubles game against Seok and Dang Ye Seo 11–9, 11–6, 6–11, 11–5. This {{marked the first time}} Singapore had won more than one medal at an Olympic Games. Feng commented: [...] "Against Japan, we gave ourselves too much pressure and lost the psychological battle. After that, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> that I must prepare myself well mentally and it's only when I do what I'm capable of that I can win." ...|$|E
500|$|In the 2008–09 season, Nasri {{appeared}} in only three matches {{with the national}} team. After playing against Lithuania on 28 March 2009, the midfielder went uncapped for the almost {{a year and a}} half. During the 2009–10 season, Nasri grew weary of his chances of appearing with the team at the 2010 FIFA World Cup. In the end, he did not appear with the team, failing to make the 23-man squad or even the preliminary squad. Nasri admitted he took the non-call up hard, recalling, [...] "Not being one of those 23 names, it was difficult." [...] The player also viewed the non-invite from a positive perspective, stating, [...] "But maybe it was for the best in the end, and not just because France had a horrible World Cup. It helped me as a person. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> I need to work harder, to make sure I don't miss the next one." ...|$|E

500|$|Davis {{received}} everyday {{playing time}} in 2012, starting at first base, at designated hitter, {{and in the}} outfield throughout the season. On May 6, in a 17-inning, 9-6 victory over the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park, Davis went hitless in eight at bats, but ended up being the winning pitcher. His feat {{was the first of}} its kind since Rube Waddell achieved it on July 4, 1905. Davis was the designated hitter until he was pressed into service as a relief pitcher in the 16th inning after Showalter had depleted the Orioles' bullpen. He struck out two batters and did not allow a run in his two innings of mound work. He was the first position player in the American League (AL) to be the winning pitcher in a game since Rocky Colavito on August 25, 1968, and the first to pitch for the Orioles since Manny Alexander on April 19, 1996. He and losing pitcher Darnell McDonald were the first position players on opposing teams in the same contest to each work in relief since Ty Cobb and George Sisler on October 4, 1925, and the first where both earned pitching decisions since Sam Mertes and Jesse Burkett on September 28, 1902. Davis described his outing: [...] "After the first inning, I was just trying to get it over the plate, and I was like, 'This is a lot harder than it looks.' <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> to start using my legs so I didn't blow my arm out or anything like that. But in all seriousness, to get a win like that here, to end a road trip like this, it's huge. Neither team wanted to lose today, especially when it goes to extra innings. I mean, they would have pulled people out of the stands to finish that game. It's just a huge win for us." ...|$|E
2500|$|Early in the 2000 season, Maddux {{was asked}} by sportswriter Bob Nightengale {{what had been the}} most memorable at-bat of his {{pitching}} career. Maddux said it was striking out Dave Martinez to end a regular season game. Nightengale was surprised Maddux hadn't picked a postseason game, or a more famous player. Maddux explained: [...] "I remember that one because he got a hit off me in the same situation (full count, bases loaded, two out in the 9th inning) seven years earlier. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> if I ever got in the same situation again, I'll pitch him differently. It took me seven years, but I got him." ...|$|E

He told me there would be no deal because [...] Arafat would not sign. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> that {{there was nothing to be}} done – these right-wingers were simply insane. I had no doubt that there would be a deal and the problems would be resolved. History proved that Sharon was right and I was wrong. In matters relating to security, that moved me to the right. Very far to the right...When there is a terrorist attack, I am [...] Lieberman. Sometimes to the right of Lieberman. For two days I really love Lieberman. But afterward I come back to reality.

2500|$|Rebecca {{has also}} {{recovered}} from an eating disorder, which she developed at around {{the age of}} 18. [...] "Every time I looked in the mirror, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> 'My goodness, how fat. You look terrible today.' It never seemed to get any better, and I felt worse and worse," [...] she writes. Reading a magazine story about a woman's struggle with an eating disorder prompted Barlow to follow the same path. She ate very little and worked out [...] "for {{two or three hours}} per day". Eventually she reached emotional exhaustion. [...] "When I was nineteen, I found myself one day with my cheek pressed against the cold tile of the bathroom floor, with nothing left to give, no energy no hope: I was done trying. As I lay there, God touched my heart. He revealed to me that all my destructive efforts to shrink my body were not making me feel any better about myself [...] I was so completely grateful for His healing that I pledged on that spot to love and serve Him {{for the rest of my}} life." ...|$|E
2500|$|Halep {{began the}} year as the Romanian No. 2, ranked No. 47 in the world, 20 places behind Sorana Cîrstea. Her first three tournaments, ASB Classic, Hobart International and Australian Open, ended in defeats. Her first major tournament {{breakthrough}} came at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia in May, gaining three of the biggest victories of her career. Halep defeated two-time Grand Slam champion Svetlana Kuznetsova, world No. 4 Agnieszka Radwańska, and two-time tournament champion and former world No. 1 Jelena Janković (but saved 2 match points) to reach the semifinals, where she was defeated soundly by eventual champion Serena Williams in straight sets. She later said that [...] "What changed was that I allowed myself to be relaxed on the court by taking the pressure off. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> to enjoy it and play with pleasure." [...] At the French Open, Halep suffered her second successive first-round exit at a Grand Slam, falling to Carla Suárez Navarro, despite taking the first set comfortably. She rebounded well, however, going on to win her first two WTA titles back-to-back, first at the Nürnberger Versicherungscup in June, where she defeated Andrea Petkovic in the final, {{and then at the}} Topshelf Open, where she defeated world No. 11 Roberta Vinci with the loss of just one game in the second round, before defeating Kirsten Flipkens in the final. She became the first Romanian tennis player to win back-to-back tournaments on different surfaces. She claimed her first Grand Slam match win of the year at Wimbledon, defeating Olga Govortsova of Belarus, before falling to Li Na in three sets. After Wimbledon, in July, Halep entered the top-30 rankings for the first time.|$|E

Then I walked out, closing the sitting-room door behind me,--out into the {{corridor}} {{and up the stairs}} into my own room. Then I locked and bolted my own door and looked at my watch. It was a quarter to three. I took a Bradshaw from my bookcase, packed a few clothes myself, set an alarm clock for seven o'clock in the morning, and turned into bed. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> that I would not think. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> that there was no such person in the world as Felicia, that she had never lived, that she was only part of this nightmare from which I was freeing myself! <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>myself</b> that I would go to sleep, and I stayed awake until daylight.
