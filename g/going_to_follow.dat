5|$|A Nightmare on Elm Street was {{originally}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> the same design as Platinum Dunes' other remake, Friday the 13th, with the writers taking {{what they thought}} were the best elements {{from each of the}} films and creating a single storyline with them. Eventually, they decided to use Craven's original storyline, and try to create a scarier film. That being, they decided to remove the one-line quipping Freddy, who had become less scary and more comical over the years, and bring him back to a darker nature; this included developing the character as a true child molester, something that Craven wanted to do originally in 1984 but changed to a child killer instead.|$|E
5|$|Field's {{government}} {{was startled by}} Britain's announcement in October 1963 that Nyasaland would become fully independent on 6 July 1964. While no date was set for Northern Rhodesian statehood, it was generally surmised that it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> shortly thereafter. Smith was promptly sent to London, where he held a round of inconclusive Southern Rhodesian independence talks with the new British Prime Minister, Sir Alec Douglas-Home. Around the same time, the presence and significance of Section 111 of the 1961 constitution emerged in Southern Rhodesia, prompting speculation in political circles that a future British government might, if it were so inclined, go against previous conventions by legislating for Salisbury without its consent, withdrawing devolved powers or otherwise altering the Southern Rhodesian constitution. Fearing what the Labour Party might do if it won the next British general election (which was projected for late 1964), the Southern Rhodesians stepped up their efforts, hoping to win independence before Britain went to the polls, and preferably not after Nyasaland. The Federation dissolved as scheduled {{at the end of}} 1963.|$|E

In the first verse, a disinterested Duff sings that she is eager to speak her mind and [...] "yield to her every desire". In the chorus, she sings that her {{confidence}} has strained her relationships with her friends. In the second verse, she sings of being over her depression. An [...] "angry guitar" [...] and a [...] "goth piano" [...] interrupts the song in its bridge. Duff sings that she is only listening to herself from now on.

40|$|Learners of English often face {{difficulty}} {{in finding the}} exact way of using the future auxiliaries will, shall and be <b>going</b> <b>to.</b> Some {{of them do not}} even recognize that these auxiliaries are not only tense markers (although their status is still debated) but are representatives of modal auxiliaries, as well. The aim of my thesis is to help learners of English clarify the main aspects of the use of these auxiliaries. First and foremost, I would like {{to call attention to the}} historical aspects of analysing will, shall and be <b>going</b> <b>to.</b> <b>Following</b> that, the relation of these auxiliaries will be investigated with respect to tense markers and modal auxiliaries, mainly from a syntactic perspective.

500|$|Manuela Sáenz is the General's long-time lover, {{his last}} {{since the death}} of his wife, 27years earlier. Her {{character}} is based on Simón Bolívar's historical mistress Doña Manuela Sáenz de Thorne, whom Bolívar dubbed [...] "the liberator of the liberator" [...] after she helped save him from an assassination attempt on the night of September 25, 1828. García Márquez's fictional portrait stimulated a reassessment of this historical figure, who is increasingly seen, according to Venezuelan historian Denzil Romero, [...] "not just as a mistress but as the intelligent, independent, forceful woman she was". In the novel, she is described as [...] "the bold Quiteña who loved him but was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> him to his death". The General leaves Manuela Sáenz behind, but throughout the novel he writes to her on his journey. She also attempts to write letters to him with news of the political situation, but the mail carriers have been instructed not to accept her letters. Like the historical figure on whom she is based, the fictional Manuela Sáenz is married to Dr. James Thorne, an English physician twice her age. The historical Manuela Sáenz left Thorne after Bolívar wrote declaring his undying love for her. In the novel she is characterized as astute and indomitable, with [...] "irresistible grace, a sense of power, and unbounded tenacity".|$|E
500|$|On November 10, 1960 {{the second}} International Conference of the Communist and Workers' Parties was convened. As Hoxha recalled, [...] "In his speech Khrushchev {{expressed}} the revisionist views completely and attacked the Communist Party of China and the Party of Labour of Albania, {{as well as}} those who were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> these parties, but without mentioning any names... wanted to keep all the communist and workers' parties of the world under his conductor's baton, under his dictate." [...] On November 12 a private meeting was held between members of the Albanian delegation including Hoxha and members of the Soviet leadership, which [...] "showed that no compromise between them was possible." [...] During the meeting Hoxha noted that [...] " [...] has asked to whom the Albanian army will be loyal. This question he addressed to our generals at the airport, in the presence of one of your generals. Our officers replied that our army would be loyal to Marxism-Leninism, to the Party of Labour and socialism." [...] Khrushchev replied, [...] "If our ambassador said such a thing, he was foolish." [...] Hoxha in turn replied, [...] "He was no fool. He committed this 'foolishness' following the Bucharest Meeting." [...] The subject eventually came to the Vlora naval base, which was the subject of a Soviet–Albanian dispute to become acute months later. Khrushchev threatened Hoxha, saying, [...] "We can dismantle the base if you like." [...] Hoxha replied, [...] "If you dismantle the base you will be making a big mistake. We have fought empty-bellied and bare-footed, but have never kowtowed to anybody." [...] As the meeting's atmosphere became increasingly hostile Khrushchev declared, [...] "You flare up in anger. You spat on me; no one can talk to you." [...] The meeting ended after Kapo declared, [...] "I do not agree that the talks should be conducted like this." ...|$|E
500|$|The Final Fantasy VI poem {{follows the}} journey of Terra Branford, [...] "the heroine born with the gift of magic". The poem explores the stages of her life through the game, as she escapes from slavery, faces her amnesia, discovers the source of her powers, and saves {{the world from the}} insane Kefka Palazzo. Final Fantasy VI was the first Final Fantasy game that Wanamo had played, and he wanted {{to tell the story of}} the game as it felt to him. Wanamo has {{described}} the arrangement as the most difficult one he had done to date. Originally, the poem was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> the story of the group of heroes, before Wanamo made Terra the focus, and ended up dropping the themes of the other heroes due to length. The Final Fantasy X piano concerto was arranged by Hamauzu not to tell the story of the game, but to express the [...] "continuum" [...] of the series through the lens of the game. While inspired by the game's story, Hamauzu also drew inspiration from the rest of the franchise to make the concerto more than [...] "a series of separate scenes and stories". He feels that a hallmark of Böcker's concerts is that they are not limited to directly translating the original works, but instead tie them to a wider creative process. Valtonen created the three movements of the Final Fantasy VII symphony to show three aspects of the game's setting. The first movement, [...] "Nibelheim Incident", follows the villain Sephiroth in his journey through the game; the second, [...] "Words Drowned by Fireworks", explores the relationship between Cloud Strife, Aerith Gainsborough, and Tifa Lockhart; while the third movement, [...] "The Planet's Crisis", depicts the final clash between Cloud and Sephiroth. He tried to [...] "bring out both the darkest moments as well as the heart" [...] of the game.|$|E

Amazingly, Pouget managed to get his troops across the bridge with minimal loss.

[...] Pouget obeyed and, after a climb, led his men within 40 paces of the castle. The castle, now garrisoned by men of the Jordis Infantry Regiment, suddenly erupted in flame and the blast of musketry cut down many French soldiers. Unhit, Pouget noticed that the deadliest fire came from a barred and loopholed window above the castle gate. He directed his men to silence the Austrian fire, but within ten minutes, three officers and 53 carabiniers were down. As the Austrians shot down the leading carabinier company, the rest of his light infantrymen waited in a column, unable to fire. Losses mounted alarmingly, and Pouget finally sent for a Lieutenant Guyot who was known as a crack shot. Guyot managed to get within five meters of the deadly window and began firing shots as fast as loaded muskets could be handed to him. Seeing his example, others began doing the same and the fire from the window began to slacken. Sappers rushed forward and began swinging their axes at the gate while other men entered the castle through the cellar ventilators and fought their way inside. Soon after the sappers smashed in the gate, the garrison was quickly rounded up and captured.|$|E
