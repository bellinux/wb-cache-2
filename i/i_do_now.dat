500|$|When Dewey Phillips first aired [...] "That's All Right" [...] on Memphis radio, many {{listeners}} who {{contacted the}} station by phone and telegram {{to ask for}} it again assumed that its singer was black. From {{the beginning of his}} national fame, Presley expressed respect for African American performers and their music, and disregard for the norms of segregation and racial prejudice then prevalent in the South. Interviewed in 1956, he recalled how in his childhood he would listen to blues musician Arthur Crudup—the originator of [...] "That's All Right"—"bang his box the way <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>now,</b> and I said if I ever got to the place where I could feel all old Arthur felt, I'd be a music man like nobody ever saw." [...] The Memphis World, an African American newspaper, reported that Presley, [...] "the rock 'n' roll phenomenon", [...] "cracked Memphis's segregation laws" [...] by attending the local amusement park on what was designated as its [...] "colored night". Such statements and actions led Presley to be generally hailed in the black community during the early days of his stardom. By contrast, many white adults, according to Billboards Arnold Shaw, [...] "did not like him, and condemned him as depraved. Anti-negro prejudice doubtless figured in adult antagonism. Regardless of whether parents were aware of the Negro sexual origins of the phrase 'rock 'n' roll', Presley impressed them as the visual and aural embodiment of sex." ...|$|E
500|$|One dispute {{among the}} founders of Century 21 – Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, Reg Hill and John Read – emerged from the filming of other scenes, {{including}} {{one in which the}} character of Lise Hartman bathes in a shower. Read, the director of photography, had complied with Parrish's instructions to light the sequence in silhouette. Anderson, who had intended the scene to display full-frontal nudity from actress Loni von Friedl, demanded a re-shoot, insisting that Read honour his obligations not just to Parrish as director but also to his Century 21 partners. According to Sylvia Anderson, [...] "Gerry was very keen to show that {{he was part of the}} 'Swinging Sixties' and felt that seeing a detailed nude shot – as he visualised it – was more 'with it' than the more subdued version." [...] Anderson clashed with Read and Parrish for a second time when special effects shots of Phoenix were filmed with a hand-held camera: [...] "I knew enough about space travel to know that in a vacuum a spacecraft will travel as straight as a die... told me that people were not familiar with space travel and therefore they would expect to see this kind of movement." [...] Refusing to re-film the scenes on the basis that Parrish's instructions had precedence over Anderson's, Read resigned from both Century 21 and the production of Doppelgänger at the Andersons' and Hill's request. Anderson elaborated: [...] "Clearly John was in a difficult position. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>now</b> understand how he must have felt, but in my heart I feel he couldn't play a double role." ...|$|E

2500|$|Residente {{originally}} {{studied to}} be an accountant, and Visitante finished a computer science degree. An art course prompted Residente {{to pursue a career}} as a multimedia designer, and Visitante became a full-time musician and producer. [...] Residente states that his degree in design has influenced his musical style: [...] "What I used to do with my visual art is the same thing <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>now</b> with my lyrics. [...] My songs are descriptive, very visual." [...] Besides this, Residente was a fan of what was then called [...] "underground rap" [...] in Puerto Rico, and started to earn a reputation as a lyricist (Residente says, with some embarrassment, that his moniker at the time was [...] "El Déspota", or [...] "The Despot"). Meanwhile, Visitante participated in Bayanga, a rock and Brazilian batucada group. [...] After Residente finished studying in Georgia at the Savannah College of Art and Design and earned a [...] master of fine arts in animation, illustration, sequential art and film, he returned to Puerto Rico. Soon after, both of them started working on their music. They claim they initially did it as a joke, but they still managed to get some of their songs heard throughout Puerto Rico. [...] They began recording music together in 2004, with the idea of hosting their work on a website, beginning with two demos ("La Tripleta" [...] and [...] "La Aguacatona"). [...] Within a year, the duo began looking for a record label to distribute their music commercially. [...] They decided to pursue a deal at White Lion Records, because Tego Calderón was on the label, whom the two admired.|$|E
2500|$|In {{spite of}} the facts that Nat King Cole had the #7 song in 1959, and the #1 song in 1921, and Chuck Berry had a major hit with [...] "Maybellene" [...] in 1955, in the United States in the 1950s legal {{segregation}} and discrimination against African Americans was common, especially in the Deep South. Presley would nevertheless publicly cite his debt to African American music, pointing to artists such as B. B. King, Arthur [...] "Big Boy" [...] Crudup, Ivory Joe Hunter, and Fats Domino. The reporter who conducted Presley's first interview in New York City in 1956 noted that he named blues singers who [...] "obviously {{meant a lot to}} him. [...] was very surprised to hear him talk about the black performers down there and about how he tried to carry on their music." [...] Later that year in Charlotte, North Carolina, Presley was quoted as saying: [...] "The colored folks been singing it and playing it just like I’m doin' now, man, for more years than I know. They played it like that in their shanties and in their juke joints and nobody paid it no mind 'til I goosed it up. I got it from them. Down in Tupelo, Mississippi, I used to hear old Arthur Crudup bang his box the way <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>now</b> and I said if I ever got to a place I could feel all old Arthur felt, I'd be a music man like nobody ever saw." [...] Little Richard said of Presley: [...] "He was an integrator. Elvis was a blessing. They wouldn't let black music through. He opened the door for black music." [...] B. B. King said he began to respect Presley after he did Arthur [...] "Big Boy" [...] Crudup material and that after he met him, he thought the singer really was something else and was someone whose music was growing all the time right up to his death.|$|E
