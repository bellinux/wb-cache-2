5|$|In December 2012 Clinton {{was hospitalized}} {{for a few}} days for {{treatment}} of a blood clot in her right transverse venous sinus. Her doctors had discovered the clot during a <b>follow-up</b> <b>examination</b> for a concussion she had sustained when she fainted and fell nearly three weeks earlier, as a result of severe dehydration from a viral intestinal ailment acquired during a trip to Europe. The clot, which caused no immediate neurological injury, was treated with anticoagulant medication and her doctors have said she has made a full recovery.|$|E
500|$|On 13 June, the Crown Prince left Potsdam for London {{to attend}} his mother-in-law's Golden Jubilee and to consult Mackenzie. He never {{saw his father}} alive again. He was {{accompanied}} by Victoria and their three younger daughters, along with Gerhardt; on 29 June, Mackenzie {{reported that he had}} successfully operated at his Harley Street clinic, and had removed [...] "nearly the entire growth." [...] Frederick spent July with his family at Norris Castle on the Isle of Wight. However, when Frederick visited Mackenzie's office on 2 August for a <b>follow-up</b> <b>examination,</b> the growth had reappeared, necessitating its cauterisation the same day, and again on 8 August - an ominous indication that it was indeed malignant. Felix Semon, a distinguished German throat specialist with a practice in England, and who had been closely following Frederick's case, submitted a report to the German Foreign Secretary in which he strongly criticised Mackenzie's cauterisations, and gave his opinion that the growth, if not malignant, was suspect, and should continue to be biopsied and examined. On 9 August, Frederick travelled to Braemar in the Scottish Highlands with Dr. Mark Hovell, a senior surgeon at the Throat Hospital in London. Although a further examination by Mackenzie on 20 August revealed no sign of a recurrent growth, Frederick said he had the [...] "constant feeling" [...] of something [...] "not right inside"; [...] nonetheless, he requested Queen Victoria to knight Mackenzie, who duly received a knighthood in September.|$|E

40|$|The {{primary goal}} of <b>follow-up</b> <b>examinations</b> in {{cutaneous}} melanoma is to detect development of second melanomas or tumor recurrences in an early phase of development. Early detection of recurrences has prognostic impact for the patients. More than 80 % of all recurrences are primarily detected during <b>follow-up</b> <b>examinations</b> when a structured stage-adapted schedule is applied. In the majority of cases, recurrences are detected by physical examinations. Lymph node ultrasound enables early detection of locoregional recurrences before they become palpable and represents a sensitive examination method. Further imaging techniques in primary tumors are dispensable. In primary melanomas and particularly in those with a tumor thickness of less than 1 mm a reduction of the kind and frequency of technical examinations can be recommended according to recent publications. Hence the costs of <b>follow-up</b> <b>examinations</b> can be reduced clearly without increased risk for the patients. In stage III patients an intensified schedule including imaging techniques can help in increasing the early detection of recurrences...|$|R

30|$|In summary, {{based on}} the above, {{postoperative}} follow-up methods for DFSP were as follows: In FS-DFSP cases, the rate of distant metastasis was high, so postoperative detection of distant metastasis was essential. Furthermore, since there was a tendency to metastasize to extrapulmonary sites, <b>follow-up</b> <b>examinations</b> such as abdominal CT or ultrasonography were required, {{taking into account the}} potential for extrapulmonary metastasis. In O-DFSP cases, <b>follow-up</b> <b>examinations</b> for all cases were not necessary, considering the low rate of distant metastasis of 0.4 – 1.6  %. However, regular follow-up was recommended for large tumors with potential for FS-DFSP.|$|R

50|$|The {{definitive}} {{diagnosis of}} brain tumor {{can only be}} confirmed by histological examination of tumor tissue samples obtained either by means of brain biopsy or open surgery. The histological examination is essential for determining the appropriate treatment and the correct prognosis.

30|$|To {{establish}} {{a standard of}} reference, the results of CIM and PET were finally verified by an interdisciplinary tumor board. For verification of the lesion status, all staging and <b>follow-up</b> <b>examinations,</b> histopathology of biopsies, and clinical data including the serial <b>follow-up</b> <b>examinations</b> were used. All patients underwent regular follow-up investigations, including physical examinations, blood tests, chest X-ray, and ultrasound quarterly during the first year, half yearly during the second year, and once a year thereafter. Suspicion of relapse was confirmed by biopsy and histopathological examination.

50|$|Post-operative {{care for}} {{patients}} with blast-related ocular trauma occurs in tertiary care facilities. Patients with closed globe injuries require observation and <b>follow-up</b> <b>examination</b> with an optometrist, including slit lamp microscope and dilated fundus inspection. Those who have been treated for open-globe repairs often experience a delay of post-operative treatment that ranges from 10-14 days after injury.

50|$|Tumour {{localization}} may {{be extremely}} difficult. Barium swallow and <b>follow-up</b> <b>examination</b> of the intestine may occasionally show the tumor. Capsule video endoscopy {{has recently been}} used to localize the tumor. Often laparotomy is the definitive way to localize the tumour.Another form of localizing a tumor is the Octreoscan. A tracer agent of Indium 111 is injected into a vein where then the tumors absorb the radionuclide Indium 111 and become visible on the scanner. Only the tumors absorb the somatostatin agent Indium 111 making the scan highly effective.|$|E

The National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program, a national initiative focused on increasing access to cervical and breast cancer screening for underserved women followed more than 10,000 participants who had two or more abnormal Pap test results. They found 56% of these patients did not follow-up with a recommended cervical examination, and 27.7% of this group received no <b>follow-up</b> <b>examination</b> whatsoever.
