The doctrine of exemption/frustration/force majeure {{is very important in}} the area of contract and commercial law, it is a doctrine deeply rooted in fairness and allows a party to be excused from performing an obligation in a contract if {{at the conclusion of the}} contract an inhibition beyond the foreseeable control of the party happens to render the performance of the contract impossible. However, it is not easy to effectively streamline this doctrine and properly determine its applications. It has been observed in this thesis that, the doctrines of exemption/frustration /force majeure are not exactly the same; this thesis explores in details severally and jointly the various differences and similarities in the interpretations and applications of these impossibility doctrines. For instance, the open and flexible use of words in the definition of this doctrine under the CISG and the UNIDROIT Principles left much to be desired. Thus, it is one of the succinct arguments of this thesis that couching international law in loose words will work against the uniformity of application of this law, due to the different interpretations national law courts will be subjecting it to. This among other issues retarded the growth and development of the doctrine of exemption and force majeure. Furthermore, English law stance on the doctrine of frustration which can be gleaned from both the Sale of Goods Act of 1979 and the Common law are far from being adequate and need to be updated. This thesis therefore incisively laid bare the applications, interpretations and way forward for the doctrine of exemption/frustration/force majeure under the legal instruments of focus of this work. The thesis also comparatively compares the relationship between the doctrine of frustration/force majeure/exemption and other related doctrines like mistake, termination, avoidance, risk, and hardship. The thesis is concluded with a Draft Model <b>Frustration</b> <b>Clause</b> (DMFC) which is an attempt to rise above the status quo doctrine of frustration in the extant laws and develop a <b>frustration</b> <b>clause</b> that will be able to provide answers to the many flaws that trail these laws. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the darkest}} depths of a {{corporate}} merger agreement lies the MAC clause, a term that permits the acquirer {{to walk away from}} a transaction if, between signing and closing, the target company experiences a 2 ̆ 2 Material Adverse Change. 2 ̆ 2 Multibillion-dollar deals rise or fall based on the anticipated interpretation of a MAC clause, and invocation of the clause in a sensitive transaction could trigger the collapse of the global financial system. In short, the MAC clause is the most important contract term of our time. And yet [...] due to an almost total lack of case law [...] no one knows what it means. In this Article I explain the MAC clause using a new conceptual tool for drafting and interpreting contracts, the 2 ̆ 2 standard clause analysis. 2 ̆ 2 For any default rule of contract law, practitioners can be expected to develop a 2 ̆ 2 standard clause analog 2 ̆ 2 in order to easily contract around the default. Given this relationship between default rules and their standard clause analogs, if one is given, the other can be deduced. This is the 2 ̆ 2 standard clause analysis, 2 ̆ 2 and it can be used in two ways, which I call 2 ̆ 2 forward 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 reverse. 2 ̆ 2 In a forward standard clause analysis, one begins with a default rule and advances to its standard clause analog. The forward standard clause analysis can be used to predict the existence of standard clause analogs that have yet to be observed. And in a reverse standard clause analysis, one begins with a standard clause and advances to the default rule with which it is associated. The reverse analysis is a powerful method for interpreting contract terms. After introducing and describing the standard clause analysis, I put it to practical use. I begin by applying the forward analysis to the common law doctrine of frustration, and predict that a 2 ̆ 2 <b>frustration</b> <b>clause</b> 2 ̆ 2 exists, or will soon come into being, and that it would resemble a reverse Force Majeure clause and be found in relatively high-value contracts. These predictions are then confirmed with several examples of frustration clauses observed in the real world: the Morals clause, the Walkaway clause, and, most notably, the MAC clause. Then I apply the reverse analysis to the MAC clause and show it to be a standard clause analog of the frustration doctrine that alters the default rule by (a) permitting excuse {{on the basis of a}} significant (but less than total) loss in contractual value, (b) excusing the acquirer based on frustration of a 2 ̆ 2 secondary 2 ̆ 2 (as opposed to its 2 ̆ 2 primary 2 ̆ 2) purpose, and (c) shifting major exogenous risks (such as an economic recession or a natural disaster) from the target to the acquirer. I conclude with a case study to demonstrate the difference between the MAC clause and the default frustration doctrine: Bank of America 2 ̆ 7 s recent 50 billion acquisition of Merrill Lynch in late 2008. During the brief three-month period between signing and closing, Merrill lost an astounding 15 billion, but the conventional wisdom [...] shared by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, among others [...] is that Merrill 2 ̆ 7 s loss clearly failed to trigger the MAC clause. I disagree. While the default frustration doctrine would not have offered any relief, Bank of America may well have had viable grounds to invoke the MAC clause, properly understood, and walk away from the Merrill deal...|$|E
