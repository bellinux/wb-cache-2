40|$|Acid rain is {{a general}} term used to {{describe}} either wet or <b>dry</b> <b>acidic</b> <b>deposition.</b> Wet acidic deposition is what is {{commonly referred to as}} acid rain {{as it is in the}} form of rain, snow or fog. Dry deposition can be equally as important as wet deposition, but is in the form of acidic gases and particles. Scientists prefer to use the term acid deposition in referring to acid rain, as it includes both wet and dry deposition. All rain is naturally acidic with a pH of around 5. 5. The majority of the acid rain that falls in the United States has a pH of 4. 3 (www. epa. gov/airmarkets/acidrain). It is difficult to measure the percentage of acid that is in the form of wet deposition, as when rain falls it can mix with dry deposition. Acid rain is formed mainly by the combustion of fossil fuels, specifically coal and oil and smelting of iron ores that release pollutants into the atmosphere. Acid rain is formed through two main sources. The sources are categorized as primary and secondary pollutants. Primary pollutants are from industrial and domestic human activities and include sulfur dioxide (SO 2), and nitric oxides (NOx). Secondary pollutants are formed by chemical reactions in the atmosphere with primary pollutants. The most importan...|$|E
40|$|AbstractData from {{bi-weekly}} passive samplers from 18 of {{the longest}} operating National Atmospheric Deposition Program’s (NADP) Ammonia Monitoring Network (AMoN) sites (most operating from 2008 to 2015) show that concentrations of NH 3 have been increasing (p-value <  0. 0001) over large regions of the USA. This trend is occurring at a seasonal and annual level of aggregation. Using random coefficient models (RCM), the mean slope for the 18 sites combined shows an increase of NH 3 concentration of + 7 % per year, with a 95 % confidence interval (C. I.) from + 5 % to + 9 % per year. Travel blank corrected data using the same approach show increasing NH 3 concentrations of + 9 % (95 % C. I.  + 5 % to + 13 %) per year. During a comparable period (2008 – 2014) NADP precipitation chemistry sites in the same regions show significant increasing (p-value =  0. 0001) precipitation NH 4 + concentrations trends for all sites combined of + 5 % (95 % C. I.  + 3 % to + 7 %) per year. Emissions inventory data for the study period show nearly constant rates of NH 3 emissions, but large reductions in NOx and SO 2 emissions. Seasonal air quality data from the Clean Air Status and Trends Network (CASTNET) sites in these regions show significant declines in atmospheric particulate SO 42 − and NH 4 +, and particulate NO 3 − plus HNO 3 (total NO 3 −) during the same period. Less formation of acidic SO 4 and NO 3, due to reduced SO 2 and NOx emissions, provide less substrate to interact with NH 3 and form particulate ammonium species. Thus, concentrations of NH 3 can increase in the atmosphere even if emissions remain constant. A likely result may be more localized deposition of NH 3, {{as opposed to the}} more long-range transport and deposition of ammonium nitrate (NH 4 NO 3) and sulfate (NH 4) 2 SO 4). Additionally, the spatial distribution of wet and <b>dry</b> <b>acidic</b> <b>deposition</b> will be impacted...|$|E

Although there are many reasons why these damages understate the full extent oflosses to both current users and others, this research represents one of the initial attempts to quantify one type of cost associated with the <b>acidic</b> <b>deposition</b> problem. Key words: acid rain damages, pollution costs, recreational resource valuation, travel cost model. Although scientists have been aware for many years that precipitation in certain areas of the world is relatively acidic, attention has fo-cused recently on the acid precipitation (more correctly, <b>acidic</b> <b>deposition)</b> problem as the result of two important research findings (Cowling). One was the fairly widespread evi-dence correlating <b>acidic</b> <b>deposition</b> with acid-ification of surface waters and the loss of aquatic life.

The {{goal was to}} investigate changes in the community structure of soil fauna in study sites receiving different amounts of <b>acidic</b> <b>deposition</b> for several decades and the possible relationships between these changes and physico-chemical properties of soil. The study revealed {{significant differences in the}} numbers of soil animals among the three study sites. The sharply differentiated pattern of soil macroinvertebrate fauna seems closely linked to soil chemistry. Significant correlations of the abundance of soil macroinvertebrates with soil parameters suggest that their populations could have been affected by <b>acidic</b> <b>deposition</b> in the region. Abundance of total soil macroinvertebrates decreased with the increased cumulative loading of <b>acidic</b> <b>deposition.</b> Among the groups most sensitive to deposition were: earthworms gastropods, dipteran larvae, termites, and predatory beetles.

40|$|Episodic {{acidification}} of streams, {{identified in}} the late 1980 s {{as one of the}} most significant environmental problems caused by <b>acidic</b> <b>deposition,</b> had not been evaluated since the early 1990 s despite decreasing levels of <b>acidic</b> <b>deposition</b> over the past decade. This analysis indicates that episodic acidification of streams in upland regions in the northeastern United States persists, and is likely to be much more widespread than chronic acidification. Depletion of exchangeable Ca in the mineral soil has decreased the neutralization capacity of soils and increased the role of the surface organic horizon in the neutralization of acidic soil water during episodes.

40|$|Abstract. Alpine/subalpine {{ecosystems}} in Rocky Mountain National Park may {{be sensitive}} to atmospherically derived <b>acidic</b> <b>deposition.</b> Two- and three-component hydrograph separation analyses and correlation analyses were performed for six basins to provide insight into streamflow generation during snowmelt and to assess basin sensitivity to <b>acidic</b> <b>deposition.</b> Three-component hydrograph separation results for five basins showed that streamflow contained from 42 to 57 % direct snowmelt runoff, 37 to 54 % subsurface water, and 4 to 13 % direct rain runoff for the May through October 1994 study period. Subsurface contributions were 89 % of total flow for the sixth basin. The reliability of hydrograph separation model assumptions was explored. Subsurface flow {{was positively correlated with}} the amount of surficial material in a basin and was negatively correlated with basin slope.

We evaluated, through meta-analysis, {{the magnitude of the}} effects of <b>acidic</b> <b>deposition,</b> nitrogen deposition, increased ozone levels, elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide, and drought on fine roots and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) characteristics. Ectomycorrhizal colonization was an unsuitable parameter for environmental change, but fine root length and biomass could be useful. <b>Acidic</b> <b>deposition</b> had a significantly negative impact on fine roots, root length being more sensitive than root biomass. There were no significant effects of nitrogen deposition or elevated tropospheric ozone on the quantitative root parameters. Elevated CO 2 had a significant positive effect. Drought had a significantly negative effect on fine root biomass. The negative effect of <b>acidic</b> <b>deposition</b> and the positive effect of elevated CO 2 increased over time, indicating that effects were persistent contrary the other factors. The meta-analysis also showed that experimental conditions, including both laboratory and field experiments, were a major source of variation.

40|$|Environmental {{response}} to <b>acidic</b> <b>deposition</b> occurs through the vehicle of water {{movement in the}} ecosystem. As {{a part of the}} environmental studies for <b>acidic</b> <b>deposition</b> in the ecosystem, output-based hydrologic classification was done from basin hydrologies based on the distribution of the baseflow, snowmelt, and the direct runoff sources. Because of the differences in the flow paths and exposure duration, those components were assumed to represent distinct geochemical responses. As a first step, user-friendly software has been developed to calculate the baseflow based on the separation of annual hydrographs. It also generates the hydrograph for visual analysis using trial separation slope. After the software was completed, about 1200 stream flow gauging stations in Northeastern U. S. were accessed for flow separation and other hydrologic characteristics. At the final stage, based on the output from the streamflow analysis, cluster analysis was performed to classify the streamflow behaviors in terms of acidic inflow. The output from the cluster analysis shows more efficient regional boundaries of the subregions than the current regional boundaries used by U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (U. S. E. P.
