40|$|AbstractFinite element (FE) {{calculations}} {{are used}} to develop a comprehensive understanding of the dynamic response of sandwich beams subjected to underwater blast loading, including the effects of fluid–structure interaction. Design maps are constructed to show the regimes of behaviour over {{a broad range of}} loading intensity, sandwich panel geometry and material strength. Over the entire range of parameters investigated, the time-scale associated with the initial fluid–structure interaction phase up to the instant of first cavitation in the fluid is much smaller than the time-scales associated with the core compression and the bending/stretching responses of the sandwich beam. Consequently, this initial fluid–structure interaction phase decouples from the subsequent phases of response. Four regimes of behaviour exist: the period of sandwich core compression either couples or decouples with the period of the beam bending, and the core either densifies partially or fully. These regimes of behaviour are charted on maps using axes of blast impulse and core strength. The simulations indicate that continued loading by the fluid during the core compression phase and the beam bending/stretching phase cannot be neglected. Consequently, analyses that neglect full fluid–structure interaction during the structural responses provide only estimates of performance metrics such as back <b>face</b> <b>deflection</b> and reaction forces at the supports. The calculations here also indicate that appropriately designed sandwich beams undergo significantly smaller back face deflections and exert smaller support forces than monolithic beams of equal mass. The optimum transverse core strength is determined for minimizing the back <b>face</b> <b>deflection</b> or support reactions at a given blast impulse. Typically, the transverse core strength that minimizes back <b>face</b> <b>deflection</b> is 40 % below the value that minimizes the support reaction. Moreover, the optimal core strength depends upon the level of blast impulse, with higher strength cores required for higher intensity blasts...|$|E

Neutral plane deflection w 0 N is corrected from the solution of a supplementary problem. Here the total correction over <b>face</b> <b>deflection</b> is about 0.66 giving a value of 4.46 which is very close to the exact value 4.49.

30|$|In Kirchhoff’s {{theory and}} shear {{deformation}} theories including the widely used FSDT, vertical deflection w 0 (average displacement in Reissner’s sixth-order theory) is {{same in the}} face parallel planes. However, it is known physically that neutral plane deflection has {{to be higher than}} <b>face</b> <b>deflection.</b> This {{is due to the fact}} that an elastic medium is on either side of the neutral plane, whereas it is on one side of each of the top and bottom faces. Proper estimation of neutral plane deflection is dependent on normal strain εz ignored in Kirchhoff’s theory and shear deformation theories. In an earlier investigation (Vijayakumar 2011 a), it is shown that the expansion of displacements in polynomials of thickness coordinate z is not adequate to properly estimate face and neutral plane deflections. This fact is overlooked in the analysis of even isotropic homogeneous plates through the widely used FSDT and other shear deformation theories. A solution to a supplementary problem is required to obtain neutral plane deflection. It is, however, observed that the error in the estimation of <b>face</b> <b>deflection</b> is much higher than that of neutral plane deflection. However, it is desirable to provide uniform approximation to deformations through thickness of the plate. It appears to the author’s knowledge that no suitable 2 -D modeling which gives more or less the same percentage of approximation to thickness-wise distribution of a displacement variable is reported until now. Proper higher-order theories are to reduce only maximum error in the estimation of a physical variable to a desirable level.|$|E

With reference to numerical values reported in Lewinski’s article, the above correction is less than 1.23 in Reissner’s 12 th-order and other higher-order theories. It clearly shows that shear deformation theories and other higher-order theories do not lead to the solutions of bending problems. It is to be noted that vertical deflection w 0 from FSDT is usually considered to be w 0 N, but its estimated value (3.69) of the deflection parameter is much nearer the w 0 F.|$|E

The process of light induced frustrating etching, where light from a laser is used to inhibit the etching of iron doped lithium niobate, {{is the subject of}} a detailed investigation so a better understanding of the process can be developed. The process was found to be dependent upon illumination and etch times, iron dopant levels, and irradiance levels. Analysis of the structures formed revealed that they were resistant to the etchant used and were positively charged. Two dimensional Fourier transform analysis of images obtained were used to confirm that the structures preferentially propagated along 3 directions each 120 o apart. A novel electro-optically controlled domain-engineered total internal reflection switch and beam deflector is also reported. Device construction uses electric field poling of lithium niobate to create two parallel but oppositely oriented domains. When an electric field is applied across the interface between these domains a change in the refractive index of equal magnitude but of opposite sign is induced. If light incident on this interface sees a sufficient difference in refractive index it can be total internally reflected. The total internal reflection switch shows high contrast ratio switching of greater than 20 dB and is less wavelength dependent than other electro-optic switches, such as the Pockels cell. The beam deflector can produce large angular deflections, which are increased by faceting of the output <b>face.</b> <b>Deflections</b> of greater than 18 o have been demonstrated using this technique.

This is likely to persist even in higher-order approximations. This deficiency is rectified earlier (briefly described and used later in the present analysis) through solution of an auxiliary bending problem (Vijayakumar 2013). This auxiliary problem is based on consideration of the influence of σ z [...] = ± zq/ 2 satisfying face load conditions and associated constant transverse shear stresses on the preliminary solutions of primary bending problems. These transverse stresses are treated as virtual quantities since they do not participate in the static in-plane equilibrium equations as the above-mentioned virtual incremental displacements in the application of principle of virtual work.

40|$|Abstract The dynamic {{behavior}} of {{two types of}} sandwich composites made of E-Glass Vinyl-Ester (EVE) facesheets and Corecell ™ A-series foam with a polyurea interlayer was studied using a shock tube apparatus. The materials, {{as well as the}} core layer arrangements, were identical, with the only difference arising in the location of the polyurea interlayer. The foam core itself was layered with monoton-ically increasing wave impedance of the core layers, with the lowest wave impedance facing the shock loading. For configuration 1, the polyurea interlayer was placed behind the front facesheet, in front of the foam core, while in configuration 2 it was placed behind the foam core, in front of the back facesheet. A high-speed side-view camera, along with a high-speed back-view 3 -D Digital Image Correlation (DIC) system, was utilized to capture the real time deformation process as well as mechanisms of failure. Post mortem analysis was also carried out to evaluate the overall blast performance of these two configurations.

Thermo-dynamic compressive experiments were undertaken using a Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar apparatus in conjunction with an induction heater. This data in combination with quasi-static data collected at the University of Connecticut was used to construct a Johnson-Cook constitutive model of the steel. The results show an increase in yield strength as strain rate increases and a decrease as temperature increases. The steel also undergoes strain hardening that decreases as temperature increases. ^ The shock experiments on the graded, corrugated steel panels were conducted using a shock tube apparatus in combination with a Photron SA 1 digital high speed camera and PCB pressure transducers. Various combinations of corrugation gradation were tested {{in order to understand}} the effects of gradation on the shock response of corrugated panels.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Sandwich plates used {{in marine}} {{structures}} {{are made of}} laminated face sheets bonded to a structural foam core. Low-velocity impact by a stiff indenter may cause local <b>deflection</b> of the <b>face</b> sheet and permanent deformation or crushing of an underlying volume of the foam core. Upon unloading, the face sheet tends to spring back, while the permanent strain in the core gives rise to residual stresses that may nucleate local interfacial cracks. Extension of such interfacial cracks by applied loads can compromise structural integrity. This article examines the protective effect of thin, ductile interlayers, inserted between the face sheet and the foam core, that absorb the <b>face</b> sheet <b>deflection</b> and thus prevent or reduce the extent of damage to the foam core. Finite element solutions are obtained for a stiff, incompressible, and very ductile polyurethane (PUR) interlayer, and also for a compliant and compressible elastomeric foam (EF) layer, in a sandwich plate made of quasi-isotropic AS 4 / 3501 - 6 laminated face sheets and H 100 PVC core. Loading is applied by a concentrated force acting on a rigid cylindrical indenter. Results show that the PUR interlayer better supports the impacted face sheet than does the foam core or the EF interlayer. The PUR layer also reduces the extent of permanent deformation of the foam core. At a given magnitude of applied load, the energy release rate for cracks extended by residual stresses at the interface between the foam core and either interlayer is much lower than that at the interface between the face sheet and the foam core in the conventional design.

40|$|AbstractThe {{mechanical}} {{response and}} fracture of metal sandwich panels subjected to multiple impulsive pressure loads (shocks) were investigated for panels with honeycomb and folded plate core constructions. The structural performance of panels with specific core configurations under multiple impulsive pressure loads is quantified by the maximum transverse <b>deflection</b> of the <b>face</b> sheets and the core crushing strain at mid-span of the panels. A limited set of simulations {{was carried out}} to find the optimum core density of a square honeycomb core sandwich panels under two shocks. The panels with a relative core density of 4 %– 5 % are shown to have minimum <b>face</b> sheet <b>deflection</b> for the loading conditions considered here. This {{was consistent with the}} findings related to the sandwich panel response subjected to a single intense shock. Comparison of these results showed that optimized sandwich panels outperform solid plates under shock loading. An empirical method for prediction of the deflection and fracture of sandwich panels under two consecutive shocks – based on finding an effective peak over-pressure – was provided. Moreover, a limited number of simulations related to response and fracture of sandwich panels under multiple shocks with different material properties were performed to highlight the role of metal strength and ductility. In this set of simulations, square honeycomb sandwich panels made of four steels representing a relatively wide range of strength, strain hardening and ductility values were studied. For panels clamped at their edge, the observed failure mechanisms are core failure, top face failure and tearing at or close to the clamped edge. Failure diagrams for sandwich panels were constructed which reveal the fracture and failure mechanisms under various shock intensities for panels subjected to up to three consecutive shocks. The results complement previous studies on the behavior and fracture of these panels under high intensity dynamic loading and further highlights the potential of these panels for development of threat-resistant structural systems...|$|R
40|$|The dynamic {{response}} of filled corrugated steel sandwich panels was investigated under combined extremes of blast loading and high temperature heating. The {{objective of this}} project was to study blast mitigation and the thermo-mechanical {{response of}} panels using a polymer based syntactic foam and mortar as a filler material. These materials were selected due to their thermal resistivity. In this study, silicone resin (with an operating temperature range between - 53 °C to 232 °C) and two types of glass bubbles were selected as materials to develop a heat resistive syntactic foam. The mechanical properties of the foam were investigated, in ambient temperatures, before and after high-temperature heat treatment (of 500 °C), by quasi-static compression experiments. It was observed that plateau stress increases after introduction of glass bubbles in silicone, enhancing the energy absorption properties for both specimens with and without heat treatment. To produce repeatable blast loading, a shock tube was utilized. Pressure history was recorded using pressure transducers located in the shock tube muzzle. High speed photo-optical methods utilizing Digital Image Correlation (DIC) coupled with optical band-pass filters and high-intensity light source, were utilized to obtain the real-time deformation at high temperature while a third camera captured side-view deformation images. The shock pressure profiles and DIC analysis were used to obtain the impulse imparted to the specimen, transient deflection, in plane strain and out-of-plane velocity of the back face sheet. Shock tube experiments were performed to investigate the blast response of corrugated steel sandwich panels filled with a silicone based syntactic foam filler at room and high temperature. It was observed that using the syntactic foam as a filler material, decreased the front face and back face deflections by 42 % and 27 %, respectively, compared to an empty panel. The highest impulse was imparted on the specimen at room temperature and subsequently lower impulses with increasing temperature. Due to increasing ductility in steel with high temperature, the specimens demonstrated an increase in back <b>face</b> <b>deflection,</b> in-plane strain and out-of-plane velocity with increasing temperatures with weld failure being the primary form of core damage. High temperature blast experiments were also performed on mortar filled corrugated steel sandwich panels. Mortar is a common building material that can withstand extreme temperatures. It was observed cement based mortars are thermally resilient enough {{to be used as}} a filler material for high temperature applications. The highest impulse was imparted on the specimen at room temperature and subsequently lower impulses with increasing temperature. A temperature difference of at least 300 ºC was observed across the thickness of the specimen for all heating conditions. Due to increasing ductility in steel with high temperature, the specimens demonstrated an increase in back <b>face</b> <b>deflection,</b> in-plane strain and out-of-plane velocity with increasing temperatures with weld failure being the primary form of core damage. ...|$|E

As such, estimation of in-plane stresses, thereby, in-plane displacements, are not dependent on w 0. The support condition w 0 = 0 along the plate edge does not play any role in the estimation of in-plane displacements. In fact, Kirchhoff’s theory gives only a lower bound for α for the validity of small deformation theory. Validity of its application is a questionable proposition for small values of α even slightly higher than this lower bound since the theory gives highly constrained solutions for displacements. Shear deformations are included in FSDT in which face shear conditions are not satisfied and Reissner’s theory in which edge condition on w 0 is not satisfied. Both of these theories give {{more or less the same}} maximum vertical deflection. It shows that satisfying either edge condition on w 0 or face shear conditions has equal effect on deformations. In each of these theories, both conditions are satisfied only in the limit. Limiting process, however, nullifies the effect due to the applied or reactive edge stress τ xy [...] in the bending problem. Moreover, linear variation of σ z [...] in z is neglected in constitutive relations.

Exceptional levels of protection are provided by controlling the damage and deformation mechanisms over several length scales.

Dyneema® panels approximately 2. 2 mm thick were impacted with a fully instrumented hemi-spherical impactor at velocities of 3. 38 m/s. Full field deformation of the panels was captured through digital image correlation (DIC). The {{results indicate that the}} cross-ply laminate [0 °/ 90 °] had the largest back <b>face</b> <b>deflection,</b> whilst quasi-isotropic architectures restricted and reduced the central deflection by an average of 43 %. In the case of the [0 °/ 90 °] panel, the deformation mechanisms were dominated by large amounts of in-plane shear with limited load transfer from primary fibres. Conversely, the failure of the quasi-isotropic panels were dominated by large amounts of panel buckling over various length scales. The observed mechanisms of deformation with increasing length scale were; through thickness fibre compression, fibre micro-buckling, fibre re-orientation with large matrix deformation, lamina kink band formation, and laminate buckling. The helicoidal panels showed that bend-twist and extension-twist coupling were important factors in controlling clamped boundary conditions and the laminate buckling/wrinkling shape. Further examination of the impact zone indicated that the damage mechanisms appear to be fibre orientation dependent, with quasi-isotropic laminates having up to 37. 5 % smaller impact damage zones compared with [0 °/ 90 °]. The experimental observations highlight the importance of fibre orientation in controlling the deformation mechanisms under dynamic impact, in particular limiting the shear deformation of Dyneema® panels...|$|E

They are subject to uncontrolled microclimatic variations that include weekly heating periods. The actual amount of these variations, as well as the consequence on the panel deformations, are insufficiently known. Such information is particularly required when a painted panel needs to be transported, either to be displayed in a different place like a museum or to a workshop for restoration, in order to assess the risk resulting from the change of ambient conditions and make the appropriate decision for their preventive conservation. The panel called "Le Couronnement d'Epines", about 500 years old, is made of 3 horizontal boards assembled through a pair of vertical crossbars. It is on display in the choir of Saint Didier church, Avignon, south of France, and presents a satisfactory conservation state. Our study focused on the upper board.

We also introduce optical method based on 3 D image correlation that we used for external shape measurements. The analysis of the shape, together with the observation of anatomical orientation of two wood samples, allowed estimating the board position in the stem. The deflection was simulated numerically using a 1 D version of the code TransPore, which models the heat and mass transfer through the panel and the hygromechanical response of the wood.

40|$|Industries {{nowadays}} demand {{lightweight and}} space-saving solutions such as sandwich panels that offer high strength-to-weight ratios. In general, sandwich panels consist of homogeneous core material that carries a shear force and face plates that carry a bending moment. The web-core sandwich panel has an inhomogeneous core as {{it consists of}} unidirectional web plates that are periodically distributed and connected to the face plates by laser stake-welded T-joints. The joint has two crack-like notches {{on each side of}} the weld. When the panel bends, the out-of-plane shear deformation opposite to the web direction causes local bending of the joined plates in the vicinity of the weld. This leads to tension at one notch tip and compression at the other. The fatigue crack initiates at the tensile tip and propagates through the weld under cyclic loading until the plates are separated and the sandwich effect is lost. The thesis investigates the fatigue resistance of laser stake-welded T-joints in the web-core panels under out-of-plane loading, i. e. lateral loading. The bending of the joined plates in panels can cause contact between the surfaces of the compressive notch. It is determined that the contact causes an increase of the stiffness of the T-joint in the case of significant <b>face</b> plate <b>deflection</b> since it results in a large rotation of the joint. The increase in the stiffness of the joint needs to be considered in the assessment of the global response of the panel, which defines the displacements that are imposed as the loads in the local strength assessment of the joint. If panel contains a low-stiffness filling material inside the voids, the contribution of the material increases the shear stiffness of the panel and reduces the deformation of the joint. Thus, under the same external loading, the filling prolongs the fatigue life of the panel. The evaluation of the J-integral at the tips of the notches, modelled using statistically mean notch depth values, gave agreement on the fatigue strengths between all the series that were investigated at five million load cycles. The agreement is obtained regardless of plate thicknesses, the type of loading or whether the filling material is present. Good agreement with other steel joints is also demonstrated at five million load cycles. However, the slope of the fatigue resistance curve varies, depending mainly on the load type, i. e. tension or bending. The research determined that the slope depends on the distribution of the maximum principal stress in the vicinity of the notch tip. When the stress is characterized by a dimensionless gradient, evaluated in the stress direction, the slope-gradient relation appears linear. The gradient shows sensitivity towards the loading type and the plate thickness effect...|$|R

Ill. (some col.) Steel sandwich panels with integrated structural and thermal insulating performance offer several advantages over conventional construction methods for residential roofs. These advantages include improved energy efficiency, reduced construction time, architectural benefits, and amenability to other energy-saving {{technologies such as}} integrated solar photovoltaic panels. Traditional foam core panels are unsuitable for roofs, however, because they rely on the core material (which has low stiffness and is subject to creep) for long-term structural performance. This work focuses on an alternative solution, web core panels, consisting of foam-filled panels with interior webs, with or without an additional insulating layer. The structural performance of web core panels {{is provided by the}} face sheets and webs. The core is used both as an insulating material and to strengthen the thin sheet metal components against local buckling failure. The webs, in particular, must be thin and widely-spaced to minimize their impact on thermal performance. As a result, they are subject to a variety of potential local failure modes that limit the range of feasible roof designs. The influence of the core material on local failure modes is examined in this work. Models are developed by treating the webs as plates on a Pasternak elastic foundation, with expressions for the foundation constants derived using energy methods. The models are validated through finite element analysis and prototype testing. The factors that limit the range of feasible web core designs are investigated. The limiting factors for design are thermal performance, panel <b>deflection,</b> <b>face</b> sheet buckling, and shear buckling of the webs. Thermal performance is particularly limiting due to the high thermal conductivity of the steel webs, and large panel depths are generally required. Panel depth can be reduced by using a web material with lower thermal conductivity, such as stainless steel, or by providing an external insulating layer. Design procedures are developed for panels with and without an external insulating layer and used to investigate the tradeoff between panel depth and weight. Based on minimum weight design, panels with stainless steel webs are recommended, especially as the applied load and R-value requirements increase...|$|R

Due to the increased threat of damage to civilian and defense structures in the form of terrorist attacks and blast loading, a comprehensive understanding on blast mitigation of composites and sandwich structures, as well as an optimal design, is essential. ^ The dynamic behavior of various sandwich composites made of E-glass Vinyl-Ester (EVE) facesheets and Corecell ™ A-series styrene acrylonitrile (SAN) foam core was studied using a shock tube apparatus. The overall specimen dimensions were held constant for all core configurations studied, more specifically the foam core thickness. Prior to shock tube testing, the quasi-static and dynamic constitutive behavior of the facesheets (tensile/compressive) and foam (compressive) was evaluated. During the shock tube testing, a high-speed photography system was utilized to capture the real-time deformation process, as well as mechanisms of failure. In the later studies, high-speed photography was coupled with the optical technique of 3 -D Digital Image Correlation (DIC) to obtain the real-time, full-field deformation process, including the out-of-plane deflection and velocity, as well as in-plane strain. Post-mortem analysis was also carried out to evaluate the overall blast performance of these configurations. ^ First, shock tube experiments were performed to study the dynamic response of sandwich panels with E-glass Vinyl-Ester (EVE) composite facesheets and stepwise graded styrene acrylonitrile (SAN) foam cores. Two types of core configurations, with identical areal density, were subjected to the shock wave loading. The core layers were arranged according to the density of the respective foam; configuration 1 consisted of low / middle / high density foams and configuration 2 consisted of middle / low / high density foams. The method to calculate the incident and reflected energies of the shock wave, as well as the deformation energy of the specimen, were proposed based on the shock wave pressure profiles and the high-speed deflection images that were obtained. The experimental results showed that configuration 1 outperformed configuration 2 in regards to their blast resistance. Significant core material compression was observed in configuration 1, while in configuration 2 the core layers disintegrated and the front skin (blast side) fractured into two pieces along the midsection. The foam core compression in configuration 1 reduced the dynamic pressures seen on the back facesheet, and thus limited the total amount of damage imparted on the specimen. The estimated energies were then calculated for both configurations. The total energy difference between the incident and reflected energies was almost identical, even though the deformation energy for configuration 2 was larger. ^ Since it was observed that a stepwise graded foam core allows for more compression in the core, thus reducing dynamic pressures seen on the back facesheet, and limiting the total amount of damage imparted on the specimen, the study was then continued to investigate the influence of the number of foam core layers, as well as material interfaces, on the dynamic response of sandwich structures. Four types of core configurations were subjected to the shock wave loading. The foam core was monotonically graded based on increasing acoustic wave impedance, with the foam core layer of lowest wave impedance facing the blast. The specimen dimensions were held constant for all core configurations, while the number of core layers varied, resulting in specimens with one layer, two layer, three layer, and four layers of foam core gradation. The results indicated that even though each configuration allowed for a stepwise compression of the core, the number of core layers has an influence on the dynamic response of the structure under blast loading. More specifically, by increasing the number of monotonically graded layers, the acoustic wave impedance mismatch between successive layers is reduced. Therefore, the strength of the initial shock wave (stress wave) can be weakened by the time it reaches the back facesheet, resulting in lower back <b>face</b> <b>deflection,</b> in-plane strain, and velocity. More importantly, the overall damage imparted on the structure can be reduced and structural integrity can be maintained. ^ Due to the fact that higher levels of core gradation helped maintain structural integrity and improved the overall blast performance of sandwich structures, the study was then continued to investigate the blast response of sandwich structures with a functionally graded core and polyurea (PU) interlayer, and more importantly how the location of this polyurea interlayer affects the overall behavior and blast performance. Two types of core configurations were subjected to shock wave loading. The materials, as well as the core layer arrangements, were identical, with the only difference arising in the location of the polyurea interlayer. The foam core itself was layered with monotonically increasing wave impedance of the core layers, with the lowest wave impedance facing the shock loading. For configuration 1, the polyurea interlayer was placed behind the front facesheet, in front of the foam core, while in configuration 2 it was placed behind the foam core, in front of the back facesheet. The results indicated that applying polyurea behind the foam core and in front of the back facesheet will reduce the back <b>face</b> <b>deflection,</b> particle velocity, and in-plane strain, thus improving the overall blast performance and maintaining structural integrity. ^ Since an optimized core configuration was determined, the study was continued to investigate the relationship between the weight of the panel and its overall blast performance. Two types of core configuration were subjected to shock wave loading. The materials, as well as the core layer arrangements, and overall specimen dimensions were identical, with the only difference appearing in the core layers; one configuration utilized equivalent core layer thickness, while the other configuration utilized equivalent core layer mass. The foam core itself was layered based on monotonically increasing the acoustic wave impedance of the core layers, with the lowest wave impedance facing the shock loading. The results indicated that with a decrease in areal density of ∼ 1 kg/m 2 (5 %) from the sandwich composites with equivalent core layer thickness to the sandwich composites with equivalent core layer mass, an increase in deflection (20 %), in-plain strain (8 %) and velocity (8 %) was observed. ^ Finally, since an optimal core configuration was developed to better mitigate blast loadings, and an in-depth study was performed on the relationship between the weight of the panel and its overall blast performance, the research was continued with composite facesheet designs to better mitigate impact and blast loadings. Two types of core configurations were subjected to shock wave loading. The core material and thickness, as well as overall specimen dimensions were held constant, with the only difference arising in the resin system used during the infusion. The non-core-shell rubber toughened resin system (Non-CSR) consisted of a Vinyl-Ester resin only; while the CSR toughened resin consisted of the same Vinyl-Ester resin, but with Kane Ace MX- 153 nano-scale core-shell rubber particles added to the mixture. Results indicated that adding nano-scale core-shell rubber (CSR) particles to sandwich composites, aids in dispersing the initial shock wave loading, thus reducing the overall deflection, strain, and velocity and improving the overall blast resistance of the structure. ...|$|E
40|$|Blast loading {{events that}} arise from the {{detonation}} of explosives pose a severe threat {{to the lives of}} civilians and military personnel alike. Such dangers typical of a detonation event include {{but are not limited to}} an intense, sudden initial pressure spike, extreme temperatures due to the burning of gases released by the explosive, and damage to the integrity of surrounding structures. It is therefore the purpose of the studies detailed in this manuscript to investigate various methods of mitigating the dangers posed by shock loading, as well as to investigate a novel impact mitigation device. ^ To address the danger presented by high velocity glass fragments generated by windows that have failed due to shock loading, a study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of coated laminated safety glass panels’ ability to contain glass fragments when subject to shock loading over a range of temperature conditions. Using a shock tube apparatus, fully clamped specimens were loaded under room temperature (25 °C), low temperatures (- 10 and 0 °C), and high temperatures (50, 80, 110 °C). For each experiment, the incident and reflected shock wave pressure profiles were recorded and three-dimensional Digital Image Correlation was used to analyze high-speed images and compute the full-field deformation, in-plane strains, and velocities during the blast-loading event. A post-mortem study of the sandwich specimen was performed to investigate the effectiveness of such materials under different temperatures to withstand these shock loads. The composite panel showed great endurance during the blast loading for temperatures from 0 to 80 °C, however was unable to contain glass fragments at - 10 °C and 110 °C. ^ A new system was designed to mitigate the impact forces during a collision using shock loading. The device consists of a cylindrical composite bladder sealed on one end by an inflation valve and on the other by an aluminum sheet of variable thickness. The bladder is pressurized and as an impactor nears the device, it strikes a striker-needle which ruptures the aluminum sheet, thus producing a shockwave just prior to impact. This produced shock wave decelerates the impactor and creates momentum (impulse) opposing that impulse transmitted from the impactor. Drop weight experiments were performed to show the applicability of this anti-shock device in reducing the momentum of the incoming body. A range of variables including needle length, bladder pressure, impact velocity, and drop mass were tested to better understand the processes involved. Time lapse photography coupled with 2 D Digital Image Correlation (DIC) was used to obtain the striker full field motion data during the drop-weight experiments. It was found that the device effectively mitigates impact for higher impact velocities and for higher bladder pressures, decreasing peak loads during impact by up to 58 % and energy imparted on the structure by 40 %. ^ An experimental study was also conducted to examine the induced pressure from the interaction of a planar shock front and perforated plates under fixed and free-standing boundary conditions using the shock-tube facility. Two series of experiments with variations in the blockage ratio, net hydraulic diameter, shapes, and sizes of the orifices, were conducted. During each experiment, pressure histories caused by the interaction of the incident shock wave with the plates were recorded. During the fluid structure interaction time, the side-view images of the targets were recorded using a single high-speed camera to identify the motion response of each plate configuration. The influence of varying the incident shock wave Mach number on the pressure profile was examined under clamped boundary conditions. The experimental results show that as the blockage ratio of the freestanding perforated plate decreased from 100 % to 65 %, the reflected peak pressure decreased by 26 %, and the maximum impulse imparted to the perforated plate decreased by 33 %. During the fluid-structure interaction process, as the blockage ratio of the freestanding perforated plate decreased from 100 % to 65 %, the plate’s momentum, velocity and kinetic energy decreased by approximately 60 %, 61 %, and 84 % respectively. ^ Finally, investigations were conducted to investigate the performance of different surface roughness (Ra) of 1018 mild low carbon steel panels under blast loading. Specimens were machined to have three different surface finishes of 0. 8, 1. 4, and 5. 0 µm. The shock tube apparatus was utilized to generate controlled blast loadings on simply supported specimens. For each experiment, incident and reflected shock wave pressure profiles were recorded, and three-dimensional Digital Image Correlation was used to analyze high-speed images and compute the full-field deformation, in-plane strains, and velocities during the blast loading event. In addition, another high speed camera was utilized to record the side-view deformation images and this information was used to validate the data obtained from the 3 D stereovision DIC technique. The results indicated that the impulse imparted to the plate decreased as the surface roughness increased from 0. 8 µm to 5. 0 µm. Due to this impulse reduction along with high surface roughness, the plates demonstrated a decrease in back <b>face</b> <b>deflection,</b> in-plane strain and out-of-plane velocity. ...|$|E
