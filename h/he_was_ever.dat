Although Carter's colleagues responded positively to the selection, the Fox Network wanted someone younger {{to take the lead}} part. Fox asked William Hurt to play the lead role, but after finding out that Hurt had no interest in acting on television, Henriksen got the part.|$|E
5|$|Wighard (or Wigheard; died between 664 and 667) was {{a medieval}} Archbishop-elect of Canterbury. What {{little is known}} about him comes from 8th-century writer Bede, but {{inconsistencies}} between various works have led to confusion about the exact circumstances of Wighard's election and whether <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> confirmed in that office. What is clear is that he died in Rome after travelling there for confirmation by the papacy of his elevation to the archbishopric. His death allowed Pope Vitalian to select the next archbishop from amongst the clergy in Rome.|$|E

25|$|In later years, Jefferson {{refused to}} serve as a godparent for infants being baptized, because he did not believe in the dogma of the Trinity. Despite {{testimony}} of Jefferson's church attendance, {{there is no evidence that}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> confirmed or was a communicant.|$|E
25|$|Medwin's {{regiment}} was disbanded {{at the end}} of 1818 and Medwin went on to half-pay {{attached to}} a regiment of the Life Guards until 1831, when he sold his commission.

25|$|The {{evidence}} whether Wren was a speculative freemason is {{the subject}} of the Prestonian Lecture of 2011, which concludes on the evidence of two obituaries and Aubrey's memoirs, with supporting materials, that he did indeed attend the closed meeting in 1691, probably of the Lodge of Antiquity, but that there is nothing to suggest that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> a Grand Officer as claimed by Anderson.|$|E
25|$|Mormaer Ailín I of Lennox, also Alún or Alwin, ruled Lennox {{sometime}} before 1178. He is an obscure figure, known only in two sources, and remains characterless. It {{is not certain}} that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> recognized as a Mormaer of Lennox, although one source does call him that. In the 1170s, Lennox was in the nominal possession of David, the brother of King William I. David was given the territory as a fief of the crown in 1178.|$|E
25|$|Following the 1996 {{murder of}} {{journalist}} Veronica Guerin, the Dáil {{set up the}} Criminal Assets Bureau, to seize assets {{of those who were}} both convicted of crimes, and also seemingly had no obvious means of income. The CAB was set up to focus mainly on high-profile drug dealers, but had an open approach to all convicted criminals. Cahill denied that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> involved in drug dealing, however his brother Peter was convicted of supplying heroin in the 1980s.|$|E

25|$|He often {{spent much}} time at the clavier, picking out thirds, which <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> striking, and his {{pleasure}} showed that it sounded good.... In the fourth year of his age his father, for a game as it were, began to teach him a few minuets and pieces at the clavier.... He could play it faultlessly and with the greatest delicacy, and keeping exactly in time.... At the age of five, he was already composing little pieces, which he played to his father who wrote them down.|$|E
25|$|In 1793, Sir John Scott was {{promoted}} {{to the office of}} Attorney-General, in which it fell to him to conduct the memorable prosecutions for high treason against British sympathizers with French republicanism, amongst others, against the celebrated Horne Tooke. These prosecutions, in most cases, were no doubt instigated by Sir John Scott, and were the most important proceedings in which <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> professionally engaged. He has left on record, in his Anecdote Book, a defence of his conduct in regard to them.|$|E
25|$|He {{presented}} {{himself as a}} patrician, as the last Edwardian, as a Whig (in the tradition of his wife's family), as a romantic Tory, as intellectual, as a man shaped by the comradeship of the trenches and by the slump of the 1930s, as a shrewd man of business of bourgeois Scottish stock, and as a venerable elder statesman at home with modern youth. There was something in all these views, which he did little to discourage, and which commanded public respect into the early 1960s. Whether <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> a mainstream Conservative, rather than a skillful exponent of the postwar consensus, is more doubtful.|$|E

25|$|Officially, Daniil died at 1 AM on November 17, 1962 (1960 in some sources), at Aiud prison hospital, having {{suffered}} a stroke that left him comatose—afflictions which, in themselves, {{seem to suggest that}} he had been severely beaten in confinement. Prison records have it that, since 1959, he had been under medical supervision for hypertonia. However, it is unlikely that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> administered the medicine specified in his chart, which appears to have been forged and backdated. The hieromonk's body {{is said to have been}} dumped at the nearby Trei Plopi burial site, an iron spike driven through his heart by prison guards who meant to certify Tudor's death.|$|E
25|$|Because {{there is}} no {{reference}} in any source prior to this work to this figure named Pharamond, who is placed prior to Chlodio (that is, before ca. 428), scholars consider him a legendary rather than historical figure. As {{a matter of fact}} in several sources, for example Gregory of Tours, multiple kings are attested to rule simultaneously in later times. It is thus a dubious matter to assume that, even if Pharamond existed, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> recognized as sole king. The first king of the Franks who may have been close to this position was Clovis I, but after his death his empire was divided again amongst his sons, who ruled again simultaneously.|$|E
25|$|Mills remarked after Deshler's death:I may pause {{here and}} pay a passing tribute {{to the memory of}} our fallen chief. He was brave, generous and kind, even to a fault.

Amongst the host of brave hearts that were offered the altar of {{sacrifice}} for their country on that beautiful Sabath, there perished not one, noble, braver, or better than his. He lived beloved, and fell lamented and mourned by every officer and man of his command.|$|E

25|$|During their investigation, Allen confides in Terry {{about how}} he ran a college dating service in his past, though he denies that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> a pimp. When they both get to Allen's house, Terry {{develops}} a slight crush on Allen's future wife Sheila (Eva Mendes), while not believing she is truly with Allen because of her beauty. When they visit Allen's ex-girlfriend, Christinth, to gain their police evidence, {{she and her husband}} wants him to have sex with her. When Sheila tells Allen that she is pregnant, he reverts to his dark personality, and so she kicks him out of their house. Meanwhile, Terry unsuccessfully attempts to reconnect with his ex-fiancée Francine (Lindsay Sloane), who had walked out on him due to his furious attitude.|$|E
25|$|Petre {{certainly}} did not obtain his many important commissions {{because of a lack}} of competing architects. The equally versatile R. A. Lawson was responsible for several important buildings in the city including the neoclassical ANZ Bank building and the Gothic revival Presbyterian First Church. W. B. Armson designed the Italian Renaissance Bank of New Zealand building in 1879, and George Troup was responsible for the magnificent Dunedin Railway Station. Nor did Petre obtain work, with the possible exception of the Sacred Heart Basilica at Wellington, because of his family connections. On the contrary, his Catholicism, at the height of the British Empire, possibly lost him more ecclesiastical commissions than those for which <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> engaged. What stood out was his engineer's practicalities at overcoming almost impossible difficulties. St. Joseph's Cathedral was built not only on the side of a hill, but also in a gully. His pioneering work with concrete and steel was of enormous value in a country where earthquakes were a constant risk.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Dutch embassy diplomat Herman Knippenberg was {{investigating}} {{the murders of}} Bintanja and Hemker. Knippenberg had some knowledge of, and had possibly even met Sobhraj, although the latter's true identity was still unknown to the diplomat, who continued gathering evidence. With {{the help of a}} neighbour of Sobhraj, Knippenberg built a case against him. Knippenberg was eventually given police permission to search Sobhraj's apartment, a full month after the suspect had left the country. Knippenberg found evidence, including victims' documents and passports, as well as poisons and syringes. The trio's next stop was Malaysia, where Chowdhury was sent to steal gems. Chowdhury was observed delivering the gems to Sobhraj. This was the last time <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>ever</b> seen, and neither Chowdhury nor his remains were ever found. It is believed that Sobhraj murdered his former accomplice before leaving Malaysia to continue his and Leclerc's roles as gem salesmen in Geneva. A source later claimed to have sighted Chowdhury in Germany, the claim appeared unsubstantiated. The search for Chowdhury continues.|$|E
