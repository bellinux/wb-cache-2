5000|$|An {{interlocutory}} {{appeal is}} a highly unusual type of appeal which can be filed before a case is concluded in the trial divisions of the Superior Court (Law or Chancery Divisions or the Family, <b>General</b> Equity, <b>Probate</b> or Foreclosure Parts). Usually, litigants can only appeal a Final Order of a Court in which one or more parties have [...] "lost" [...] and wish to have 3 (usually more experienced) judges rule on their case. Usually, interlocutory appeals are only accepted if the issue being appealed is dispositive of the entire case. A common example would be a criminal {{case in which the}} trial judge has ruled certain evidence, usually drugs, is admissible against the defendant. If the evidence is ruled to be inadmissible, the entire case would be usually be dismissed under the Exclusionary Rule. Therefore, it is efficient to have the issue decided by the appeals court before a trial, after which there may be a successful appeal to have the entire case dismissed -- wasting much time and money in the process. (If the prosecutor loses an exclusionary case, that would almost always be a Final Order and the prosecutor would have 45 days to appeal -- the same as any other litigant.) ...|$|R
