500|$|Handel's biographer Jonathan Keates writes that: [...] "From [...] Handel {{learned not}} only a great <b>deal</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> line and shape of an aria, about strong, adventurous bass lines and solid choral writing, but also about those delicacies of {{instrumental}} colouring which he later perfected in his own style". Handel's musical development also benefited from an early and lasting friendship with Georg Philipp Telemann, whom he met in 1700. In February 1702 Handel enrolled at the University of Halle, perhaps intending to study law. In March he took up the post of organist at Halle's Calvinist cathedral (Domkirche), a prestigious appointment for one so young and indicative of his burgeoning musical reputation in the city.|$|E
500|$|Although {{they came}} to learn a great <b>deal</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> game, neither Kotok nor McCarthy were known as chess players. Mikhail Botvinnik, three times world chess champion, wrote in his book Computers, Chess and Long-Range Planning that the Kotok–McCarthy program's [...] "rule for rejecting moves was so {{constituted}} that the machine threw the baby out with the bath water." [...] The program drew criticism from Richard Greenblatt, who later wrote Mac Hack, which beat a person in tournament play, and more recently, from Hans Berliner, when he looked back on it in 2005. During the Cold War, Kotok-McCarthy played (and lost to) the best Russian chess program in the first match between computer programs.|$|E
500|$|The use of {{satellite}} tracking is teaching scientists a great <b>deal</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> way albatrosses forage {{across the ocean}} to find food. They undertake no annual migration, but disperse widely after breeding—Southern Hemisphere species often undertake [...] trips. There is also evidence of separate ranges for different species at sea. A comparison of the foraging niches of two related species that breed on Campbell Island, the Campbell albatross and the grey-headed albatross, showed the Campbell albatross primarily fed over the Campbell Plateau whereas the grey-headed albatross fed in more pelagic, oceanic waters. Wandering albatrosses also react strongly to bathymetry, feeding only in waters deeper than 1000m (3281ft); so rigidly did the satellite plots match this contour that one scientist remarked, [...] "It almost appears as if the birds notice and obey a 'No Entry' sign where the water shallows to less than 1000m". There is also evidence of different ranges for the two sexes of the same species; a study of Tristan albatrosses breeding on Gough Island showed that males foraged {{to the west of}} Gough and females to the east.|$|E
