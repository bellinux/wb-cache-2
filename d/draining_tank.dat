40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} of flows involving moving boundaries are challenging {{as they need}} to address the location and the conditions of the interface that interacts with the flow field. We have developed a unified, marker-based approach, which can treat moving solid and multiphase fluid dynamics using adaptively refined Cartesian grids. The interfaces separating the fluid phases are modeled using a continuous interface method, while the noslip condition on solid interfaces is imposed by a sharp interface method. A smoothly varying Heaviside-like function is used for handling discontinuous material properties between fluids and for identifying the solid-fluid interface location. Furthermore, a distance-based formulation is adopted to treat solid-fluid interface intersections. A domain decomposition method via Hilbert space filling curves and preconditioned multigrid solvers are incorporated into the staggered grid arrangement for scalar and velocity variables. To highlight the performance of the present approach, case studies are conducted for (i) interface shapes, residual volumes, formation of sloshes and corresponding wave periods in <b>draining</b> <b>tank</b> with different control parameters and flow regimes, (ii) fluid dynamics around a flapping airfoil, and (iii) fluid flow around complex solid geometries...|$|E
40|$|A {{reference}} {{design of}} the fluid fuel circuit and the emergency draining system has to be defined and optimized {{in the frame of}} the SAMOFAR project, together with the interaction phenomena between the reactor and the chemical plant. The present deliverable is divided in two main parts dedicated to the fuel salt circuit and the draining system. Each part comprises three sections: - a first section named ‘Feedback from EVOL and previous studies: list of identified constraints’ explains the constraints leading to some design options on the basis of past studies (typically from the EVOL project and some previous MSFR parametric studies); - a second section named ‘Proposition of initial reference design’ proposes a preliminary design, based on the constraints identified, {{to be used as a}} basis for the optimization studies foreseen in the SAMOFAR project. This design is not fixed: it will be optimized and will evolve all along the project as will this deliverable itself; - a third section named ‘Developments and studies in the frame of SAMOFAR’ in which all the partners involved in the WP 1 will list the studies that are undertaken during the project. Deliverable 1. 1 presents the initial reference design and operation procedures of the MSFR proposed by CNRS and the other partners of WP 1 at the beginning of the project. The fuel circuit is enclosed in an internal vessel which serves as the container for the fuel salt, with 16 cooling sectors arranged circumferentially in the vessel, inserted from the top. This design results from previous physical and safety preliminary studies and aims at minimizing the fuel leakage occurrences and optimizing the use of the liquid salt both as fuel and coolant. The proposed design for the emergency draining system is based on the same idea, with a vessel containing the drained fuel salt with cooling rods to control the salt temperature on the short to long term. Such rods contain an inert salt used for its thermal inertia. The <b>draining</b> <b>tank</b> geometry has been defined in order to ensure a subcritical configuration in any situation. During the project, this description will be continuously updated by including all improvements and recommendations from the other work packages. This deliverable will thus be a living document, to follow this evolution all along the project...|$|E

40|$|The Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) is an 8 MW reactor {{that was}} {{operated}} at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) from 1965 through 1969. The reactor used a unique liquid salt fuel, {{composed of a}} mixture of LIF, BeF{sub 2 }, ZrF{sub 4 }, and UF{sub 4 }, and operated at temperatures above 600 {degrees}C. The primary fuel salt circulation system consisted of the reactor vessel, a single fuel salt pump, and a single primary heat exchanger. Heat was transferred from the fuel salt to a coolant salt circuit in the primary heat exchanger. The coolant salt {{was similar to the}} fuel salt, except that it contains only LiF (66 %) and BeF, (34 %). The coolant salt passed from the primary heat exchanger to an air-cooled radiator and a coolant salt pump, and then returned to the primary heat exchanger. Each of the salt loops was provided with <b>drain</b> <b>tanks,</b> located such that the salt could be drained out of either circuit by gravity. A single <b>drain</b> <b>tank</b> was provided for the non-radioactive coolant salt. Two <b>drain</b> <b>tanks</b> were provided for the fuel salt. Since the fuel salt contained radioactive fuel, fission products, and activation products, and since the reactor was designed such that the fuel salt could be drained immediately into the <b>drain</b> <b>tanks</b> {{in the event of a}} problem in the fuel salt loop, the fuel salt <b>drain</b> <b>tanks</b> were provided with a system to remove the heat generated by radioactive decay. A third <b>drain</b> <b>tank</b> connected to the fuel salt loop was provided for a batch of flush salt. This batch of salt, similar in composition to the coolant salt, was used to condition the fuel salt loop after it had been exposed to air and to flush the fuel salt loop of residual fuel salt prior to accessing the reactor circuit for maintenance or experimental activities.

40|$|A {{criticality}} analysis of Molten Salt Reactor (MSR) safety systems {{is carried out}} in this research. These systems are design {{to work in the}} event of an accident scenario, where a solid freeze plug (frozen fuel salt) melts, and the fuel salts volume drains into a number of storage tanks of non-critical geometry. For the purpose of this research, MONK Version 9 A Monte Carlo Program by ANSWERS Software Service was used to carry out the {{criticality analysis}} for the <b>drain</b> <b>tanks</b> using the design geometry and specifications of the Molten Salt Research Experiment (MSRE) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Tennessee-USA.

40|$|The Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory {{has been}} shut down since December 1969, at which time the molten salt mixture of LiF-BeF{sub 2 }-ZrF{sub 4 }-{sup 233 }UF{sub 4 } (64. 5 - 30. 3 - 5. 0 - 0. 13 mol%) was {{transferred}} to fuel salt <b>drain</b> <b>tanks</b> for storage. In the late 1980 s, increased radiation {{in one of the}} gas lines from the <b>drain</b> <b>tank</b> was attributed to {sup 233 }UF{sub 6 }. In 1994 two gas samples were withdraw (from a gas line in the Vent House connecting to the <b>drain</b> <b>tanks)</b> and analyzed. Surprisingly, 350 mm Hg of F{sub 2 }, 70 mm Hg of UF{sub 6 }, and smaller amounts of other gases were found in both of the samples. To remote this gas from above the <b>drain</b> <b>tanks</b> and all of the associated piping, the reactive gas removal system (RGRS) was designed. This report details the laboratory testing of the RGRS, using natural uranium, prior to its implementation at the MSRE facility. The testing was performed to ensure that the equipment functioned properly and was sufficient to perform the task while minimizing exposure to personnel. In addition, the laboratory work provided the research and development effort necessary to maximize the performance of the system. Throughout this work technicians and staff who were to be involved in RGRS operation at the MSRE site worked directly with the research staff in completing the laboratory testing phase.

40|$|Three-dimensional {{distribution}} calculations {{are performed}} for the ITER-FEAT vacuum vessel, the connected {{pressure suppression pool}} and <b>drain</b> <b>tank.</b> An ex-vessel/first-wall coolant leak without plasma shutdown is simulated. The steam, hydrogen, and air sources for this sequence are taken from best-estimate MELCOR calculations. The time- and space-dependent gas distribution in the system is calculated using the verified three-dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics code GASFLOW. A new extended version of GASFLOW has been developed to model the ITER-FEAT specific phenomena in adequate detail. During the accident sequence, hydrogen initially appears only in the vacuum vessel due to the steam/beryllium reaction. After failure of the burst membranes, steam and hydrogen flow from the vacuum vessel through the connecting lines to the suppression pool and the <b>drain</b> <b>tank.</b> Because of the ongoing steam condensation occurring in the suppression pool, the pressure there remains permanently at a lower level {{compared to the other}} components, resulting in a continuous flow of steam and noncondensable gases into this volume. Since no steam condensation is modeled in the <b>drain</b> <b>tank,</b> almost all H_ 2 and N_ 2 accumulate in the suppression pool cover gas volume. After 10, 500 s of steam flow, also air starts entering the vacuum vessel, with the basic mechanisms remaining the same. Consequently, an accumulation of N_ 2 and O_ 2 takes place in the suppression pool cover gas. Combustible and explosive H_ 2 -O_ 2 -N_ 2 mixtures exist after 13, 600 s, and at 21, 000 s a stoichiometric H_ 2 /O_ 2 ratio has formed, involving 14 kg of hydrogen. Contrary to the situation in the suppression pool with its significant hydrogen risk, only inert, steam dominated mixtures without hazard potential develop in the vacuum vessel and the <b>drain</b> <b>tank.</b> Various passive mitigation measures could be considered to reduce or completely remove the hydrogen risk in the suppression pool.

40|$|The Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) site {{is located}} in Tennessee, on the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Oak Ridge Reservation (ORR), south of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) main plant across Haw Ridge in Melton Valley. The MSRE was run by ORNL to {{demonstrate}} the desirable features of the molten-salt concept in a practical reactor that could be operated safely and reliably. It introduced {{the idea of a}} homogeneous reactor using fuel salt media and graphite moderation for power and breeder reactors. The MSRE reactor and associated components are located in cells beneath the floor in the high-bay area of Building 7503 (Figure 1). The reactor was operated from June 1965 to December 1969. When the reactor was shut down, fuel salt was drained from the reactor circuit to two <b>drain</b> <b>tanks.</b> A ''clean'' salt was then circulated through the reactor as a decontamination measure and drained to a third <b>drain</b> <b>tank.</b> When operations ceased, the fuel and flush salts were allowed t o cool and solidify in the <b>drain</b> <b>tanks.</b> At shutdown, the MSRE facility complex was placed in a surveillance and maintenance program. As a result of the S&M program, it was discovered in 1994 that gaseous uranium (233 U/ 232 U) hexafluoride (UF 6) had moved throughout the MSRE process systems. The UF 6 was generated when radiolysis of the fluorine salts caused the individual constituents to dissociate to their component atoms, including free fluorine. Some of the free fluorine combined with uranium fluorides (UF 4) in the salt to form UF 6. UF 6 is gaseous at slightly above ambient temperatures; thus, periodic heating of the fuel salts (which was intended to remedy the radiolysis problems) and simple diffusion had allowed the UF 6 {{to move out of the}} salt and into the process systems of MSRE...|$|R

40|$|The Molten Salt Reactor Experiment Facility (MSRE) {{operated}} from 1965 to 1969. The fuel was a {{molten salt}} that flowed through the reactor core {{which consisted of}} uranium tetrafluoride with molten lithium and beryllium salt used as the coolant. In 1968 the fuel was switched from {sup 235 }U to {sup 233 }U. The Molten Salt Reactor Experiment was canceled in 1969 at which time approximately 4800 kg of salt {{was transferred to the}} fuel <b>drain</b> <b>tanks.</b> There was about 36. 3 kg of uranium, 675 grams of plutonium and various fission products present in the fuel salt. The salt was allowed to solidify in the fuel <b>drain</b> <b>tanks.</b> The salt was heated on a yearly basis to recombine the fluorine gas with the uranium salt mixture. In March 1994, a gas sample was taken from the off gas system that indicated {sup 233 }U had migrated from the fuel <b>drain</b> <b>tank</b> system to the off gas system. It was found that approximately 2. 6 kg of uranium had migrated to the Auxiliary Charcoal Bed (ACB). The ACB is located in the concrete-lined charcoal bed cell which is below ground level located outside the MSRE building. Therefore, there was a concern for the potential of a nuclear criticality accident, although water would have to leak into the chamber for a criticality accident to occur. Unstable carbon/fluorine compounds were also formed when the fluorine reacted with the charcoal in the charcoal bed. The purpose of the proposed measurement system was to perform an accountability measurement to determine the fissile mass of {sup 233 }U in the primary vessel. The contents of the primary containment assembly will then be transferred to three smaller containers for long term storage. Calculations were performed using MCNP-DSP to determine the configuration of the measurement system. The information obtained from the time signatures can then be compared to the measurement data to determine the amount of {sup 233 }U present in the primary containment assembly...|$|R
