25|$|More fossils were {{recovered}} in great abundance in New York in the 19th century, {{and elsewhere in}} eastern Eurasia and North America. Today, Eurypterus {{remains one of the}} most commonly found and best known <b>eurypterid</b> genera, comprising more than 95% of all known <b>eurypterid</b> fossils.|$|E
25|$|There are fifteen species {{belonging}} to the genus Eurypterus, {{the most common of}} which is Eurypterus remipes, the first <b>eurypterid</b> fossil discovered and the state fossil of New York.|$|E
25|$|Eurypterus was {{the first}} {{recognized}} taxon of eurypterids and is the most common. As a consequence, nearly every remotely similar <b>eurypterid</b> in the 19th century was classified under the genus (except for the distinctive {{members of the family}} Pterygotidae and Stylonuridae). The genus was eventually split into several genera as the science of taxonomy developed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Eurypterids</b> have {{traditionally}} been regarded as close relatives of horseshoe crabs (Xiphosura), together forming a group called Merostomata. Subsequent studies placed <b>eurypterids</b> closer to the arachnids in a group called Metastomata.|$|R
50|$|Pterygotidae are an extinct {{family of}} <b>eurypterids.</b> They {{were members of}} the {{superfamily}} Pterygotioidea, and were the only <b>eurypterids</b> to have a truly worldwide distribution, and include the largest arthropods to have ever lived.|$|R
25|$|Eurypterus {{are very}} common fossils in their regions of occurrence, {{millions}} of specimens are {{possible in a}} given area, though access to the rock formations may be difficult. Most fossil <b>eurypterids</b> are the disjointed shed exoskeleton (known as exuviae) of individuals after molting (ecdysis). Some are complete but are most probably exuviae as well. Fossils of the actual remains of <b>eurypterids</b> (i.e. their carcasses) are relatively rare. Fossil <b>eurypterids</b> are often deposited in characteristic windrows, probably a result of wave and wind action.|$|R
25|$|The {{ancestors}} of Eurypterus {{were believed to}} have originated from Baltica (eastern Laurussia, modern western Eurasia) based on the earliest recorded fossils. During the Silurian, they spread to Laurentia (western Laurussia, modern North America) when the two continents began to collide. They rapidly colonized the continent as invasive species, becoming the most dominant <b>eurypterid</b> in the region. This accounts for why {{they are the most}} commonly found genus of eurypterids today. Eurypterus (and other members of Eurypteroidea), however, were unable to cross vast expanses of oceans between the two supercontinents during the Silurian. Their range were thus limited to the coastlines and the large, shallow, and hypersaline inland seas of Laurussia.|$|E
500|$|These {{depend on}} {{individual}} sub-groups' environments. Modern terrestrial chelicerates generally have both book lungs, which deliver oxygen and remove waste gases via the blood, and tracheae, which {{do the same}} without using the blood as a transport system. The living horseshoe crabs are aquatic and have book gills that lie in a horizontal plane. For a long time {{it was assumed that}} the extinct eurypterids had gills, but the fossil evidence was ambiguous. However, a fossil of the [...] long <b>eurypterid</b> Onychopterella, from the Late Ordovician period, has what appear to be three pairs of vertically oriented book gills whose internal structure is very similar to that of scorpions' book lungs.|$|E
500|$|There {{are large}} {{gaps in the}} chelicerates' fossil record because, like all arthropods, their exoskeletons are organic and hence their fossils are rare except in a few lagerstätten where {{conditions}} were exceptionally suited to preserving fairly soft tissues. The Burgess shale animals Sanctacaris and Sidneyia from about [...] have been classified as chelicerates, the former because of its pattern of tagmosis (how the segments are grouped, especially in the head) and the latter because its appendages resemble those of the Xiphosura (horseshoe crabs). However, cladistic analyses that consider wider ranges of characteristics place neither as chelicerates. There is debate about whether Fuxianhuia from earlier in the Cambrian period, about , was a chelicerate. Another Cambrian fossil, Kodymirus, was originally classified as an aglaspid but {{may have been a}} <b>eurypterid</b> and therefore a chelicerate. If any of these was closely related to chelicerates, there is a gap of at least 43million years in the record between true chelicerates and their nearest not-quite chelicerate relatives.|$|E

2500|$|Eurypterus ( [...] ) is an extinct genus of <b>eurypterid,</b> a {{group of}} organisms {{commonly}} called [...] "sea scorpions". The genus lived during the Silurian period, from around 432 to 418 million years ago. Eurypterus {{is by far the}} most well-studied and well-known <b>eurypterid</b> and its fossil specimens probably represent more than 90 % of all known <b>eurypterid</b> specimens.|$|E
2500|$|Less {{ambiguous}} {{than the}} above ichnogenera, are the traces {{left behind by}} invertebrates such as Hibbertopterus, a giant [...] "sea scorpion" [...] or <b>eurypterid</b> of the early Paleozoic era. This marine arthropod produced a spectacular hibbertopteroid track preserved in Scotland.|$|E
2500|$|However, De Kay thought Eurypterus was a branchiopod (a {{group of}} {{crustaceans}} [...] which include fairy shrimps and water fleas). Soon after, Eurypterus lacustris was also discovered in New York in 1835 by the paleontologist Richard Harlan. Another species {{was discovered in}} Estonia in 1858 by Jan Nieszkowski. He considered it {{to be of the}} same species as the first discovery (E.remipes); it is now known as Eurypterus tetragonophthalmus. These specimens from Estonia are often of extraordinary quality, retaining the actual cuticle of their exoskeletons. In 1898, the Swedish paleontologist Gerhard Holm separated these fossils from the bedrock with acids. Holm was then able to examine the almost perfectly preserved fragments under a microscope. His remarkable study led to the modern breakthrough on <b>eurypterid</b> morphology.|$|E
