5000|$|Alpha-toxin {{has been}} shown {{to play a role in}} {{pathogenesis}} of disease, as hla knockout strains show reductions in invasiveness and virulence. [...] The dosage of toxin can result in two different modes of activity. Low concentrations of toxin bind to specific, <b>but</b> <b>unidentified,</b> cell surface receptors and form the heptameric pores. This pore allows the exchange of monovalent ions, resulting in DNA fragmentation and eventually apoptosis. [...] Higher concentrations result in the toxin absorbing nonspecifically to the lipid bilayer and forming large, Ca2+ permissive pores. This in turn results in massive necrosis and other secondary cellular reactions triggered by the uncontrolled Ca2+ influx.|$|R

30|$|Schifferstein and Blok (2002) {{describe}} the potential mechanisms {{through which the}} thematic associations of an odor may influence consumer behavior. If a stimulus scent is unconsciously detected, odor priming will increase the accessibility of knowledge related to the stimulus. If the scent is consciously detected <b>but</b> <b>unidentified,</b> then the processes of trying to place the scent will generate associations—some correct and related to the stimulus, others incorrectly associated with the stimulus, as the actual identity of the scent remains unknown. Finally, a scent may be consciously detected and identified, {{in which case the}} scent activates only one’s true associations with the stimulus, which in turn may generate search behavior for related products.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} testing the stability of regression parameters in regression lines of different populations when some additional, <b>but</b> <b>unidentified,</b> data sets from those populations are available. The standard test (To) discards the additional data and tests the stability, of the regression parameters using only the data sets from identified Iopulations. We propose two test procedures (T 1 and T 2) utilizing all the available data, because the additional data may contain information about {{the parameters of the}} regression lines which are tested for stability. A power comparison among the tests is also presented. It is shown that T 1 always has larger power than To. In certain situations T 2 has the largest power...|$|R

40|$|The {{electronic}} {{absorption spectra}} of isolated protonated {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon}} molecules, (PAH) H+, are unknown. Recent interest in the absorption spectra of these stable closed-shell molecules arises from the hypothesis {{that they may be}} carriers of the long-known <b>but</b> <b>unidentified</b> Diffuse Interstellar Bands (DIBs) occurring in the visible to infrared spectral range (400 - 1300 nm). We report here the first experimental detection of the electronic spectrum of protonated naphthalene, the simplest (PAH) H+, in the 500 nm region, providing compelling spectroscopic support for the hypothesis that (PAH) H+ might indeed be carriers of the DIBs. The large protonation-induced shift in the transition energy (> 40 %) from the transition of isoelectronic neutral naphthalene (312 nm) is rationalized by a charge transfer state, which is only accessible in the protonated species...|$|R

40|$|In a novel {{approach}} in observational high-energy gamma-ray astronomy, observations carried out by imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes provide necessary templates to pinpoint the nature of intriguing, yet unidentified EGRET gamma-ray sources. Using GeV-photons detected by CGRO EGRET and taking advantage of high spatial resolution images from H. E. S. S. observations, {{we were able to}} shed new light on the EGRET observed gamma-ray emission in the Kookaburra complex, whose previous coverage in the literature is some-what contradictory. 3 EGJ 1420 - 6038 very likely accounts for two GeV gamma-ray sources (E> 1 GeV), both in positional coincidence with the recently reported pulsar wind nebulae (PWN) by HESS in the Kookaburra/Rabbit complex. PWN associations at VHE energies, supported by accumulating evidence from observations in the radio and X-ray band, are indicative for the PSR/plerionic origin of spatially coincident, <b>but</b> still <b>unidentified</b> Galactic gamma-ray sources from EGRET. This not only supports the already suggested connection between variable, <b>but</b> <b>unidentified</b> low-latitude gamma-ray sources with pulsar wind nebulae (3 EGJ 1420 - 6038 has been suggested as PWN candidate previously), it also documents the ability of resolving apparently confused EGRET sources by connecting the GeV emission as measured from a large-aperture space-based gamma-ray instrument with narrow field-of-view but superior spatial resolution observations by ground-based atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes, a very promising identification technique for achieving convincing individual source identifications in the era of GLAST-LAT...|$|R
