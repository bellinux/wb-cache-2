He came in and I knew he wasn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> {{straight}} into the side but I was hoping he was going to develop and evolve and give us another option down the right-hand side.However, it hasn't quite worked out and he has gone back to his parent club which is the best thing for everybody." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite {{consistent}} performances, by December 2005 he {{had lost}} his place and there was speculation that he had fallen out with Taylor and wanted to leave; this was strongly denied by the player: [...] "I'm shocked that people are saying I want to go. I'm very happy here. ... It's taken me long enough to get to Hull so I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> out after a few months, or whatever." [...] In the following six weeks he made only two brief substitute appearances– in five months with the club he played 18 games in the Championship without scoring – and the strength of Hull's squad was such that he could not be guaranteed regular first-team football.|$|E
500|$|Classmates {{believed}} [...] "the plays {{were really}} morbid and grotesque." [...] Ian MacFarlane, Cho's former classmate, stated that, [...] "when we read Cho's plays, {{it was like}} something out of a nightmare. The plays had really twisted, macabre violence that used weapons I wouldn't have even thought of." [...] When Stephen Davis, a senior who was also in Cho's class, read Richard McBeef, he turned to his roommate and said, [...] "This is the kind of guy who is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> into a classroom and start shooting people." [...] Anna Brown, another student in the class, sometimes joked with her friends that Cho was [...] "the kind of guy who might go on a rampage killing." ...|$|E

50|$|It was {{originally}} predicted to take {{several days before}} the mine was safe enough for rescuers to enter, as the gases inside were feared to be explosive. Initially testing at the mine ventilation shaft was hindered by heavy clouds, preventing helicopter access, and staff were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> in over rough terrain, as the shaft does not have road access.|$|R
500|$|When Connor {{realized}} that the Birmingham jail was full, on May 3 he changed police tactics to keep protesters out of the downtown business area. Another thousand students gathered at the church and left to walk across Kelly Ingram Park while chanting, [...] "We're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk,</b> walk, walk. Freedom... freedom... freedom." [...] As the demonstrators left the church, police warned them to stop and turn back, [...] "or you'll get wet". When they continued, Connor ordered the city's fire hoses, set {{at a level that}} would peel bark off a tree or separate bricks from mortar, to be turned on the children. Boys' shirts were ripped off, and young women were pushed over the tops of cars by the force of the water. When the students crouched or fell, the blasts of water rolled them down the asphalt streets and concrete sidewalks. Connor allowed white spectators to push forward, shouting, [...] "Let those people come forward, sergeant. I want 'em to see the dogs work." ...|$|E
500|$|When Elaine finally arrives, she {{explains}} that Kramer promised her a lift if she would wait in his car for two minutes. He returned over twenty minutes later, and the car had been towed for being illegally parked. She was eventually forced {{to walk to the}} restaurant. Alton, returning from the bathroom, greets Elaine and tells Jerry and [...] "chorus boy" [...] George {{that they are going to}} a Pakistani restaurant five blocks away. On their way out, they notice it is snowing. Jerry knows snow would ruin his suede jacket and asks Alton if they can take a cab, but Alton replies that it is only a few blocks away. George suggests that Jerry could turn the jacket inside out, but because of the candy stripe lining, Alton notices and tells him to turn it back, saying he looks [...] "like a damn fool" [...] and that he's [...] "not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> down the street with me and my daughter dressed like that." [...] George then reminds Jerry that the restaurant is only a few blocks away; Jerry, reluctantly, puts his jacket back to normal.|$|E
500|$|In the {{conclusion}} of the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] segment Weiss spoke about Arya's story, saying [...] "Arya is in danger, she's got an open wound in her stomach, and the one person who has protected her to this point unfortunately gets murdered. The fact that the Many-Faced God gets {{the people who have been}} promised to him really makes you think that there's almost an inevitability about what happens to people who run afoul of the Faceless Men, as Arya has done." [...] Weiss continued about the final part of the sequence, [...] "Arya's telling Jaqen by putting the face on the wall that 'this account is settled, and we're good here, and now I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> away,' and I think she knows what the answer's going to be. The implication, obviously, is that Jaqen was, on some level, rooting for the outcome that he got. He may be [...] "no one," [...] but there's still enough of a person left in him to respect, and admire who this girl is and what she's become. Arya finally tells us something that we've kind of known all along, that she's not no one, she's Arya Stark of Winterfell." ...|$|E

Living in {{the midst}} of you, this way; this charming, quiet, serious family life; fraternizing with Charlotte and Gertrude; calling upon twenty young ladies and <b>going</b> out <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> with them; sitting with you in the evening on the piazza and {{listening}} to the crickets, and <b>going</b> <b>to</b> bed at ten o'clock." ...|$|R

500|$|In September 2014, {{talking about}} whether {{the ending of the}} season would also be a {{satisfying}} end to the series, Bell said [...] "we're not thinking of it as a series finale as much as a season finale ... I think we have some momentum coming in [...] and I think we pick up on it. I'm optimistic that we can keep the plane in the air a little longer." [...] He also talked {{about whether the}} themes of family and connectedness from the first season would be re-explored in the second, saying [...] "What we always look for are the human elements in the big story. That's what television does well, it makes you care about people, and whether it's literal family or anytime you have a team of people working together, it takes on some sort of family metaphor." [...] Bell reiterated the idea of family following the end of the season, saying [...] "In many ways, the whole metaphor {{at the heart of the}} show is family—you've got Coulson and May and then a bunch of younger people, and it allows us to play out different dynamics; literally, this season, we had Skye's biological parents versus her surrogate parents. And at the same time, we had Skye growing up. We had her going from a slightly sulky hacker season one to training to become an agent to becoming our first full-fledged superhero and so as we grow up, we separate from our parents... In our minds, her mom wasn't a villain so much; she was an antagonist, but if you look at why she feels the way she does, Jiaying really earned that position." [...] Discussing the reveal that Skye is actually Daisy Johnson, Maurissa Tancharoen explained thatJohnson is a character that we always liked. We always knew there was a potential to evolve Skye into something else. It took a little bit of time, but we were happy when we were able to land on Daisy Johnson, and actually have that work in our mythology. But as with everything that we do on the show, we pull from the properties, and we do our own spin to it. So we are kind of merging a few concepts and storylines. We've spent a season and a half with Skye. We've seen her evolve as a person, we've grown to like her as a person, we've seen her evolve as an agent. And now, finally bringing her to her origin story—I think there's just a lot more emotional weight to it, because you already know her as just Skye, and now she will have this ability that she may not understand, that she may not want ... We're going to focus on Skye, and how that affects the people around her, and how the relationships may shift. Because we've seen through the course of our series so far; we've spoken about how S.H.I.E.L.D. treats gifteds or views them, and they're categorized, things like that. What does that mean when one of your own is now considered someone with an ability? How do you categorize her?Whedon elaborated that [...] "We're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> her through the steps of discovering what this really means, and coming to terms with it. All that stuff is really interesting to us, and in television, because we have time to explore, we can take her origin on all sorts of different paths." [...] Additionally, Whedon talked about how the character would be referred to on the show after the reveal, saying, [...] "She's still Skye, because she thinks she's Skye. I think her dad thinks she's Daisy, and we'll see if she ever gets to the point where she believes that that's something that she would want to call herself. But right now, she has her own identity." ...|$|E

5000|$|Janssen {{has become}} an {{excellent}} control pitcher, walking only 1.6 batters per 9 innings in 2012. He has emphasized a low walk rate in becoming a successful pitcher: [...] "I pride myself, as much as I can, in not walking hitters. ... I can live with giving up hits—they're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen—but <b>walks</b> are tougher <b>to</b> swallow." ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{the same}} Entertainment Weekly article, Corgan {{disclosed}} that {{things went wrong}} {{at some of the}} very first recording sessions. [...] "...it was like, 'What do you mean the guitar's out of tune? What do you mean I have to be there at 11? What do you mean I can't order $100 of lobster every day?' I mean, like, bad. But it was too late. It was already public. The album was going out. So I did what I always did: try {{to make the best of}} a situation and start covering up. Put on a good face. And honestly, I'm glad the thing didn't sell, because if it had sold well it would have been really tough. I would look like I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> away from something that I'd just built." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I just couldn't {{believe there}} was no flag", Clark said after the game, in {{reference}} to Davis' contact with him. [...] "I mean, I just assumed it would be thrown. When I heard the crowd cheering, I gave the ref an earful. I'm not saying that cost us the game. I don't think any of the calls would have changed anything because the 49ers have a better team. But there were some calls out there we should have had." [...] "I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> out of here crying", Redskins coach Joe Gibbs added. [...] "We got beat fair and square. I did think {{there were some things}} called wrong. Rice outweighs Darrell Green by 20 pounds and gets 15 yards (for Green's flinging tackle). That's hard to understand." [...] Rypien added [...] "I don't think the score was any indication of how the game was played. We have nothing to be ashamed about other than the score. You look at 28-10 and it looks like they pretty much handled us, but all of you that watched the game know that it's a different story. We had our chances. We had our shots. We just didn't make the plays we had to." ...|$|E
2500|$|Project {{costs were}} between US$1.2 and $1.3 million, necessitating ABC's {{financial}} support (and with it, their demand of a safety harness). [...] "I'd dare say that {{never in the}} history of the circus industry has there been one event that costs this much," [...] said Wallenda. [...] The production was a serious financial strain on Wallenda. [...] "It's been a tough situation all around", he said a week before the event, blaming the lingering fight over the safety harness for inhibiting sponsorship deals. [...] When production costs ran over the original estimate of $1 million, he appealed to the public for help using the fundraising website Indiegogo. [...] He eventually met his goal of $50,000. [...] Additionally, Niagara Falls, Ontario, mayor Jim Diodati asked local businesses to chip in, saying he hoped to raise $250,000. [...] Ultimately, he helped generate about $200,000 of support from local business associations. [...] The main causes of the overrun were the need to produce two custom cables – one for the performance and a shorter one for practice – and the need to hire a new helicopter company to set up the cable at the last minute, after the original one discovered they did not hold the necessary licenses. [...] After the event, Wallenda said he had probably lost money on the event; however, he added, it was [...] "clearly worth it" [...] in the long term. [...] With all but one bill accounted for, Wallenda said he lost less than $50,000 on the event. [...] The fundraising, combined with several contractors lowering their bills, helped him get close to budget. [...] "I think people still have the impression that Nik Wallenda is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> away from this thing making millions of dollars, but that's not the case," [...] he commented.|$|E
