30|$|It is also {{possible}} {{to make use of}} a <b>central</b> <b>unit</b> (Figure 5 c), with sufficient memory available to store all routing entries, for the routing of the packets to the different subtrees. The <b>central</b> <b>unit</b> can immediately forward the packet to the correct sink. This technique requires the communication of the routing tables of each sink towards the <b>central</b> <b>unit.</b> This can be preferred if there already exists a <b>central</b> <b>unit</b> to gather the data collected by the different sinks.|$|R
50|$|A {{digital system}} usually {{requires}} a <b>central</b> <b>unit</b> to generate digital address and command signals, most <b>central</b> <b>units</b> also incorporate {{one or more}} locomotive controllers and a booster unit to generate the power necessary to run locomotives. <b>Central</b> <b>units</b> also have connections for additional controllers and accessory switch boxes, as well as connections for computer control and interfaces with other digital controllers.|$|R

50|$|Bi-directional {{data bus}} signal is {{available}} in SX-bus of the <b>central</b> <b>unit.</b> Standard connectors of SX bus are 5 pin DIN 45500 plugs and sockets. The topology of bus connections is free and Selectrix accessories can be connected together in closed circle, chained or daisy chain style. SX bus accepts any type of Selectrix accessories apart from system boosters. For connecting boosters to the <b>central</b> <b>unit</b> or to each other Selectrix systems have a dedicated PX-bus available. SX-bus signal of the first SX bus (in case the <b>central</b> <b>unit</b> {{has more than one}} SX bus available) {{is available in}} the track also and connected through two cables directly from <b>central</b> <b>unit</b> (or booster) to the track.|$|R
50|$|Similar to DYSEAC the TX-2 {{separately}} programmed devices {{can operate}} simultaneously, increasing throughput.

Based on user's requirements and general requirements for electronic security system, circuit diagrams of the <b>central</b> <b>unit's</b> motherboard and power supply with a function of backup power supply are designed. The work also includes layout of a keyboard and LCD display. Printed circuit boards are designed, produced and assembled. The device is set to work.

40|$|Synchronisation {{mechanisms}} are essential in distributed simulation. Some systems rely on <b>central</b> <b>units</b> {{to control the}} simulation but <b>central</b> <b>units</b> {{are known to be}} bottlenecks [10]. If we want to avoid using a <b>central</b> <b>unit</b> to optimise the simulation speed, we lose the capacity to act on the simulation at a global scale. Being able to act on the entire simulation is an important feature which allows to dynamically load-balance a distributed simulation. While some local partitioning algorithms exist [12], their lack of global view reduces their efficiency. Running a global partitioning algorithm without <b>central</b> <b>unit</b> requires a synchronisation of all logical processes (LPs) at the same step. We introduce in this paper two algorithms allowing to synchronise logical processes in a distributed simulation without any <b>central</b> <b>unit.</b> The first algorithm requires the knowledge of some topological properties of the network while the second algorithm works without any requirement. The algorithms are detailed and compared against each other. An evaluation shows the benefits of using a global dynamic load-balancing for distributed simulations...|$|R

40|$|This article aims {{to analyze}} how {{agreement}} regarding the <b>central</b> <b>unit</b> (macrostructure) influ-ences agreement when establishing rhetorical relations (microstructure). To do so, the authors conducted an empirical study of abstracts from research articles in three domains (medicine, ter-minology, and science) {{in the framework}} of Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST). The results help to establish a new criteria to be used in RST-based annotation methodology of rhetorical rela-tions.

40|$|Four {{generations of}} {{conjugated}} dendrimers that contain 1, 3, 5 -tris(distyrylbenzenyl) benzene cores, stilbene dendrons, and t-butyl surface {{groups have been}} synthesized. The dendrimers were synthesized by coupling benzylphosphonate-focused dendrons with 1, 3, 5 -tris(4 -formylstilbenyl) benzene to give the dendrimers in yields in the range 60 - 82 %. We have probed the optoelectronic properties of the dendrimers by electrochemistry, photoluminescence, and in light-emitting device structures. {{we have found that}} the degree of aggregation is strongly generation dependent. We compared the properties of these benzene-centered dendrimers with an equivalent family of dendrimers that differs only in having a nitrogen atom as the <b>central</b> <b>unit.</b> We found that the aggregation of dendrimers was strongly dependent on the degree of delocalization across the <b>central</b> <b>unit.</b> the dendrimers with the benzene <b>central</b> <b>unit,</b> which have three localized distyrylbenzene chromophores, were found to aggregate more strongly in the solid state that those with nitrogen as the <b>central</b> <b>unit.</b> In the latter case the electroactive component is comprised of all three distyrylbenzene units and the nitrogen atom...|$|R
