5|$|Instead of anticoagulation, a {{follow-up}} imaging test (typically ultrasound) about one-week post-diagnosis {{is an option}} for those with an acute isolated distal DVT without a <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> extension; if the clot does not grow, the ACCP does not recommend anticoagulation. This technique can benefit those at a <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> bleeding. Patients may choose anticoagulation over serial imaging, however, to avoid the inconvenience of another scan if concerns {{about the risk of}} bleeding are insignificant. When applied to symptomatic patients with a negative initial ultrasound result, serial testing is inefficient and not cost effective.|$|E

5|$|People with SCI are at {{especially}} <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> respiratory {{and cardiovascular}} problems, so hospital staff must be watchful to avoid them. Respiratory problems (especially pneumonia) {{are the leading}} cause of death in people with SCI, followed by infections, usually of pressure sores, urinary tract infections and respiratory infections. Pneumonia can be accompanied by shortness of breath, fever, and anxiety.|$|E
5|$|On 8 January 2015, it was {{announced}} by Grimsby Town director John Fenty that a financial backer had offered the club to pay his full wages {{in order to bring}} Evans to the Conference Premier club. Having held a board meeting along with team manager Paul Hurst it was decided that the move would be of too <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> the club. Grimsby had previously employed Clayton McDonald, the fellow footballer and friend of Evans who was acquitted in the same case, during the 2013–14 season.|$|E

The World Health Organization has achieved some success with improved treatment regimens, and a small decrease in case numbers.

5|$|Although {{regulation}} reducing lead {{in products}} has greatly reduced exposure {{in the developed}} world since the 1970s, lead is still allowed in products in many developing countries. In all countries that have banned leaded gasoline, average blood lead levels have fallen sharply. However, some developing countries still allow leaded gasoline, which is the primary source of lead exposure in most developing countries. Beyond exposure from gasoline, the frequent use of pesticides in developing countries adds a risk of lead exposure and subsequent poisoning. Poor children in developing countries are at especially <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> lead poisoning. Of North American children, 7% have blood lead levels above 10 μg/dL, whereas among Central and South American children, the percentage is 33 to 34%. About one fifth of the world's disease burden from lead poisoning occurs in the Western Pacific, and another fifth is in Southeast Asia.|$|E
5|$|The Mantoux {{tuberculin}} {{skin test}} {{is often used}} to screen people at <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> TB. Those who have been previously immunized may have a false-positive test result. The test may be falsely negative in those with sarcoidosis, Hodgkin's lymphoma, malnutrition, and most notably, active tuberculosis. Interferon gamma release assays, on a blood sample, are recommended in those who are positive to the Mantoux test. These are not affected by immunization or most environmental mycobacteria, so they generate fewer false-positive results. However, they are affected by M. szulgai, M. marinum, and M. kansasii. IGRAs may increase sensitivity when used in addition to the skin test, but may be less sensitive than the skin test when used alone.|$|E
40|$|The overall aim of {{the thesis}} was to add some pieces to the {{etiological}} puzzle of LCPD with special focus on vascular origin and hyperactivity. Furthermore we wanted to evaluate some consequences of LCPD in adulthood. Swedish registry data were used to identify a cohort of patients with the diagnosis of LCPD. This cohort was compared with a general population– based cohort without LCPD to assess the relative risk of cardiovascular diseases, blood or coagulation defects, injury, ADHD, depression and mortality. In a clinical study we assessed health-related quality of life (EQ- 5 D- 3 L), physical activity level (IPAQ) and screened for ADHD (ASRSv 1. 1) in 116 patients {{with a history of}} LCPD who were diagnosed or treated in Uppsala University Hospital between 1978 and 1995. The results confirmed our hypothesis: Patients with a history of LCPD had a 1. 7 -fold <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> of cardiovascular diseases, and a 1. 4 -fold <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> blood or coagulation defects compared with gender- and age-matched individuals without LCPD. We found a 1. 2 -fold <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> injuries requiring hospital admission than in gender- and age-matched individuals without LCPD. The risk was more pronounced among females. Furthermore, we found a 1. 5 -fold <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> ADHD. Stratified analysis revealed a 2. 1 -fold <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> ADHD among females with LCPD than among females without LCPD. The <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> depression was 1. 3 -fold higher, and more pronounced among females with LCPD. Patients with LCPD had a slightly <b>higher</b> mortality <b>risk</b> with <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> death from suicide and cardiovascular causes. Patients with a history of LCPD reported a lower health-related quality of life and were more physically active than the Swedish population norm. 28 % of 116 patients were likely to have ADHD or had already been diagnosed with ADHD. Both vascular and blood diseases could be present even in childhood and could, in combination with hyperactive behavior pattern and a high physical activity level, contribute to the etiology of LCPD. The lower health-related quality of life and <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> depression might reflect the mental burden of LCPD. Patients with LCPD have a <b>higher</b> mortality <b>risk</b> with <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> death from suicide and cardiovascular causes...|$|R
