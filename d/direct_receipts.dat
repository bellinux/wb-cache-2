The material used this research Bali Cows breeders of Sub-District Suai, 135 Bali Cows breeders total population cattle 982 cows. The method used the reseach survey is interviewed respondents. and sampling in proportional sampling means sampling based on certain considerations, based on the amount of Balinese cattle rearing in each village in 7 districts. Sample used 11. Primary data was obtained by direct observation of the activities of Bali Cows and interviews with respondents, using questionnaires. Secondary data is obtained the office Village or related institutions. Identification breeders is needed to know the social breeders include name, age, occupation, responsibility of family and business livestock this need to know because it is very closely related to the activities of cultivation of cattle. Samples were taken by 135 respondents from Debus, Loro, Mane Ikun, Babo, Asu Mate and Asurai villages in Sub-District Suai worked on cultivation and fattening cows. The results showed that the value of cattle in one year ago. The benefits gained by cattle ranchers in SubDistrict Suai, increase in cattle value increased a year later. From the data of 135 respondents known the number of calves 269, female 460 and male 253 of the total number of cows 982 tail. Based on these data, the average number of breeder cows is calf 2, 1, female 3. 4 and male 1. 9. If the parent price is $ 75, buy $. 25 and male $ 40 then total of the initial asset value of the year average cow per breeder is $ 3, 535. The highest value of a female cow is $ 2. 25, because all breeders maintain a female cow of 3 - 4 head and the lowest is the cattle value of the seedlings of $. 525. Total receipts by breeders with total explicit costs. The average income of breeder cattle breeding is $ 2, 278. 4 (<b>direct</b> <b>receipts,</b> indirect receipts), less explicit cost of $ 63. 6 so that the average income earned by farmers is $ 2214. 8. From the results of the study concluded that the cost incurred for the livestock business for one year of $ 1, 703. 6. The output value obtained during the maintenance period is $ 2, 278. 4.

40|$|Dissemination of {{carbapenem}} resistance among pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria is {{a looming}} medical emergency. Efficient spread of resistance {{within and between}} bacterial species is facilitated by mobile genetic elements. We hypothesized that wastewater contributes to the dissemination of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE), and studied this through a cross-sectional observational study of wastewater in the East of England. We isolated clinically relevant species of CPE in untreated and treated wastewater, confirming that waste treatment does not prevent release of CPE into the environment. We observed that CPE-positive plants were restricted to those in <b>direct</b> <b>receipt</b> of hospital waste, suggesting that hospital effluent {{may play a role}} in disseminating carbapenem resistance. We postulated that plasmids carrying carbapenemase genes were exchanged between bacterial hosts in sewage, and used short-read (Illumina) and long-read (MinION) technologies to characterize plasmids encoding resistance to antimicrobials and heavy metals. We demonstrated that different CPE species (Enterobacter kobei and Raoultella ornithinolytica) isolated from wastewater from the same treatment plant shared two plasmids of 63 and 280 kb. The former plasmid conferred resistance to carbapenems (bla_OXA- 48), and the latter to numerous drug classes and heavy metals. We also report the complete genome sequence for Enterobacter kobei. Small, portable sequencing instruments such as the MinION have the potential to improve the quality of information gathered on antimicrobial resistance in the environment.

40|$|Research {{indicates}} that many factors may impede teachers 2 ̆ 7 {{ability to develop}} caring relationships with students such as the school environment (Schaps, 2009), lack of cultural understanding (Thompson, 1998), the teacher 2 ̆ 7 s beliefs and attitudes about care (Goldstein, 2002), and personal experience of being cared for (Noddings, 1984). Yet, little research exists on how schools can address these and other potential limiting factors {{in order to help}} teachers cultivate caring relationships with students. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine how one school in India, which claims to emphasize the importance of the teacher-student relationship, develops and supports teachers 2 ̆ 7 capacities to create caring relationships with students. The hope was that the outcomes might provide insight for policy-makers, school administrators, and teachers about what is needed to best support teachers in their relationships with students. The research site for this study was a pre-Kindergarten through 12 th grade private school in India. The choice of India as a cultural context stemmed from the historical precedence of the importance of the teacher-student relationship. A mixed-methods descriptive case study served as the design for this study. Qualitative methods included interviews of teachers, administrators, and students, classroom and event observations, and document analysis. Quantitative methods included surveys of teachers and students. The qualitative data were analyzed using Noddings 2 ̆ 7 (1984) four methods for teaching care (modeling, dialogue, practice, and confirmation) with other themes added as needed. Descriptive statistics and factor analyses of both surveys were used to triangulate and expand upon the qualitative data.

40|$|The {{development}} of a medical risk management programme based on the aviation safety approach and its implementation in a large ambulatory healthcare organisation is described. The following key safety principles were applied: (1) errors inevitably occur and usually derive from faulty system design, not from negligence; (2) accident prevention should be an ongoing process based on open and full reporting; (3) major accidents are only the "tip of the iceberg" of processes that indicate possibilities for organisational learning. Reporting physicians were granted immunity, which encouraged open reporting of errors. A telephone "hotline" served the medical staff for <b>direct</b> reporting and <b>receipt</b> of emotional support and medical guidance. Any adverse event which had learning potential was debriefed, while focusing on the human cause of error within a systemic context. Specific recommendations were formulated to rectify processes conducive to error when failures were identified.

5|$|The {{head of the}} {{delegation}} to Riel was Gabriel Dumont, a respected buffalo hunter {{and leader of the}} Saint-Laurent Métis who had known Riel in Manitoba. James Isbister was the lone Anglo-Métis delegate. Riel was easily swayed to support their cause—which was perhaps not surprising in view of Riel's continuing conviction that he was the divinely selected leader of the Métis and the prophet of a new form of Christianity. Riel also intended to use the new position of influence to pursue his own land claims in Manitoba. The party departed 4 June, and arrived back at Batoche on 5 July. Upon his arrival Métis and English settlers alike formed an initially favourable impression of Riel following a series of speeches in which he advocated moderation and a reasoned approach. During June 1884, the Plains Cree leaders Big Bear and Poundmaker were independently formulating their complaints, and subsequently held meetings with Riel. However, the Native grievances were quite {{different from those of the}} settlers, and nothing was then resolved. Inspired by Riel, Honoré Jackson and representatives of other communities set about drafting a petition, and Jackson on 28 July released a manifesto detailing grievances and the settler's objectives. A joint English-Métis central committee with Jackson acting as secretary worked to reconcile proposals from different communities. In the interim, Riel's support began to waver. As Riel's religious pronouncements became increasingly heretical the clergy distanced themselves, and father Alexis André cautioned Riel against mixing religion and politics. Also, in response to bribes by territorial lieutenant-governor and Indian commissioner Edgar Dewdney, local English-language newspapers adopted an editorial stance critical of Riel. Nevertheless, the work continued, and on 16 December Riel forwarded the committee's petition to the government, along with the suggestion that delegates be sent to Ottawa to engage in <b>direct</b> negotiation. <b>Receipt</b> of the petition was acknowledged by Joseph-Adolphe Chapleau, Macdonald's Secretary of State, although Macdonald himself would later deny having ever seen it. By then many original followers had left; only 250 remained at Batoche when it fell in May 1885.|$|R

40|$|SummaryIntroductionThe {{treatment}} of {{total hip arthroplasty}} (THA) infections is long and costly. However, the number of studies in the literature analysing the real cost of THA revision {{in relation to their}} etiology, including infection, is limited. The aim of this retrospective {{study was to determine the}} cost of revision of infected THA and to compare these costs to those of primary THA and revision of non-infected THA. Materials and methodsWe performed a retrospective cost analysis for the year  2006 using an identical analytic accounting system in each hospital department (according to internal criteria) based on allotment of <b>direct</b> costs and <b>receipts</b> for each department. From January to December  2006, 424  primary THA, 57  non-infected THA revisions and 40  THA revisions due to infection were performed. The different cost areas of the patient's treatment were identified. This included preoperative medical work-up, medicosurgical management during hospital stay, a second stay in an orthopedic rehabilitation hospital (ORH) and post-hospitalisation antibiotic therapy after revision due to infection, as well as home-based hospitalisation (HH) costs, if this was the selected alternative option. We used the national health insurance fee schedule found in the “Common classification of medical procedures” and the “General nomenclature of professional procedures” applicable in France since September 1, 2005. Hospital costs included direct costs (hospital overhead costs) and indirect costs, (medical, surgical, technical settings and net general service expenses). The calculation of HH costs and ORH costs were based on the average daily charge of these departments. The cost of primary THA was used as the reference. We then compared our surgical costs with those found for the corresponding comparable hospital stay groups (Groupes homogènes de séjour). ResultsThe average hospital stay (AHS) was 7. 5 ± 1. 8  days for primary THA, 8. 9 ± 2. 2  days for non-infected revisions and 30. 6 ± 14. 9  days for revisions due to infection. The rate of transfer to a rehabilitation hospital (ORH) was 55 % for primary THA, 77 % in non infected revision cases and 65 % in revisions due to infection. Moreover, 30 % of these infected THA were prescribed HH. Non-infected THA revisions cost 1. 4 times more than primary THA. THA revisions due to infection cost 3. 6 times more than primary THA. DiscussionThe economic impact of THA infections is considerable. The extra costs are mainly due to an extended hospital stay and to longer rehabilitation consuming significant substantial human and material resources. ConclusionThe cost of treating infected THA is high. Treatment strategies should therefore be optimised to increase the success rate and minimise total costs. Level of evidenceLevel IV.

London: Zed Press ISBN 1 85649 041 6; 1 85649 042 4 The book, a landmark in dissent against the conflagration {{that has become}} the war in Iraq, collated works from scholars throughout the world who sought to penetrate the rhetoric of war, and understand its economic and political causes. In this chapter I sought to give meaning to the idea that the war had economic causes, going however beyond simplistic formulations of direct and immediate economic interest. The First Gulf War, as we now know it to have been, was not just about oil. It was, I argued in this chapter, about the disintegration of the entire postwar order. This order, although it was established by military victory and defeat, rested on profound economic relations, most notably hegemony over surplus profit arising from three principal sources: *the technical superprofit arising from the superior productivity of the ‘advanced’ countries as a whole, in the appropriation of which the USA and Germany established dominance during the long decline of UK hegemony *commercial superprofit enjoyed within the ‘spheres of influence’ of the victorious powers, domination over the world market as a whole having been fragmented by the Russian and Chinese revolutions and subsequently (to a lesser degree) the realisation of colonial independence and the formation of the non-aligned bloc – as expressed in the suspension until 1982 of the project of constructing the WTO *the financial superprofit enjoyed in partnership by the victorious powers and expressed (including the relation of forces within the partnership) in the Bretton Woods settlement The chapter argued that the war was provoked, fundamentally, by the decline in the relative productive advantage with which the US emerged from WWII, provoked primarily by the rise of Japan and Germany and expressed in the inexorably growing US deficit. The US, I argued, had been driven to try and reconstruct the world order {{in such a way as}} to claw back this loss through an ever-growing monopoly of the second two sources of superprofit – commercial and financial superprofit. The maintenance of these depended on the direct assertion of political and specifically military force – the true driver behind the USA’s ever more violent military stance in world politics. This reorganisation however had provoked an extremely rapid rise in poverty, as the US sought to compensate both for its trade deficit, and for its weaknesses vis-à-vis its rivals (Germany and Japan) by ramping up its <b>direct</b> and indirect <b>receipts</b> from the third world. This drastic impoverishment was creating the crises of governance that drove the US to re-enforce its flagging hegemony by more and more directly interventionist means. ...|$|R
40|$|The Model State Vital Statistics Act is a {{document}} {{designed to be}} used by State Registrars of Vital Statistics and State Legislators when considering revision of the Vital Statistics laws. The main objectives of the 1977 Revision of the Model Act are: (1) To incorporate current social customs and practices and current technology into the policies and Procedures of the vital statistics system in the various States; (2) to promote the uniformity of these policies and procedures to the end that all vital records will be readily acceptable in all places as prima facie evidence of the facts therein recorded: (3) to enhance the level of comparability of vital statistics data among the various States; and (4) to minimize duplication within the vital statistics system and thereby achieve maximum administrative economy. The historical philosophy of the vital statistics systems in the United States is that vital events be registered only in the State in which they occur. This concept is maintained in this Revision of the Model Act. The jurisdiction of the State Registrar extends only to boundaries of his State and standards for registration may be set and enforced only for those events occurring within those boundaries. This is a very important concept in maintaining the validity of vital records in their use for legal purposes. If it is to be respected, the appropriate procedures for recording birth and death information for United States citizens born or dying in foreign countries and certification of birth information for aliens adopted by United States citizens must continue to be the responsibility of those Federal Agencies which retain jurisdiction over recording these events. While this revision of the Model Act does not constitute an abrupt departure from earlier Model Vital Statistics Acts, there are several modifications that should be noted. The most significant change relates to the establishment of a centralized system for the collection, processing, registration and certification of vital records in each State, whereby all vital events are reported directly to the State Office of Vital Statistics. However, the Model Act contains authorization for local offices to perform those functions the State Registrar may <b>direct,</b> including the <b>receipt</b> and processing of vital records and the issuance of certified copies, when such offices can be shown to be an aid to efficient and effective operation of the system. The Model Act further provides for the options of allowing such local offices to work with records only for their designated geographic area or to be given access to the entire State file and allowing them to issue certified copies with- out regard to where the event occurred within the State. The important concept, however, is that these offices are part of the State Office of Vital Statistics and are under the direct control of the State Registrar. "May 1978.
