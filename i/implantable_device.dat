40|$|With {{the cost}} of {{healthcare}} in the U.

The two most promising ways of achieving this are through developments in <b>implantable</b> <b>devices</b> for monitoring and treating patients outside of clinical settings and through better point-of-care diagnostics tools. The {{first part of this}} dissertation focuses on the development of a potentially <b>implantable</b> autonomous <b>device</b> for the prevention of late-phase hemorrhagic shock (HS), {{the leading cause of death}} for people with traumatic injuries. We demonstrate that such a device can continuously monitor vasopressin levels, an indicator of late-phase HS, and release vasopressin automatically when levels drop below a certain threshold in order to help stabilize the situation. We also discuss the possibility of using a nonenzymatic glucose fuel cell unit, instead of a lithium battery, in order to increase the <b>implantable</b> <b>device's</b> lifetime. Novel power sources are important in the development of low-power long-term <b>implantable</b> <b>devices,</b> and we propose several non-enzymatic fuel cells that can be used as coating layers on current <b>implantable</b> <b>devices</b> or as stand-alone power sources. We show that such glucose fuel cell can produce 16 [MICRO SIGN]W cm- 3 of power and can be integrated in <b>implantable</b> <b>devices</b> such as the one for preventing late-phase HS. In the second part of the dissertation, we discuss the development of a platform for colorimetric biomarker detection on a smartphone. This platform consists of a smartphone accessory that allows uniform and repeatable image acquisition of a colorimetric test strip and an app that analyzes parameters such as hue, saturation and luminosity of the test area, quantifies the biomarker levels and displays the value on the screen.
