5|$|After the Conquest of California {{during the}} ongoing Mexican-American War, American {{settlers}} {{began to move}} to the newly seized land. This created a demand for Oregonian wheat, proceeds from the sale barrels of flour amounted to $10 per keg in 1847. The start of the Gold Rush caused an immense rise in demand for various products in Californian markets. Economic transactions with the pioneer settlements of Oregon increased greatly, with the number of visiting vessels in 1849 was triple that of the previous eight years. Between 1848 and 1851 Oregon lumber and wheat sent to the new markets fetched rates two to three times higher than in 1847. Significant amounts of <b>gold</b> <b>dust</b> began to circulate in the Willamette Valley, though impurities were common. The Oregon Exchange Company was authorized by the legislature to begin producing Beaver Coins in early 1849, though production began on 10 March, a week after the dissolution of the Provisional Government.|$|E

25|$|Gold nuggets {{were the}} {{exclusive}} {{property of the}} mansa, and were illegal to trade within his borders. All gold was immediately {{handed over to the}} imperial treasury in return for an equal value of <b>gold</b> <b>dust.</b> <b>Gold</b> <b>dust</b> had been weighed and bagged for use at least since the time of the Ghana Empire. Mali borrowed the practice to stem inflation of the substance, since it was so prominent in the region. The most common measure for gold within the realm was the ambiguous mithqal (4.5grams of gold). This term was used interchangeably with dinar, though it is unclear if coined currency was used in the empire. <b>Gold</b> <b>dust</b> was used all over the empire, but was not valued equally in all regions.|$|E

40|$|Using spin waves we {{directly}} {{probe the}} interface of an exchange biased Ni_ 80 Fe_ 20 /Ir_ 25 Mn_ 75 film {{which has been}} modified {{by the presence of}} an Au dusting layer. Combining this experimental data with a discretised simulation model, parameters relating to interface exchange coupling and modification of interface magnetisation are determined. Exchange coupling is found to be relatively uniform as gold thickness is increased, and undergoes a sudden drop at 1. 5 Å of gold. Interface magnetisation decreases {{as a function of the}} <b>gold</b> <b>dusting</b> thickness. Antiparallel alignment of the ferromagnet and antiferromagnet supress the interface magnetisation compared to when they are in parallel alignment. These findings imply that the interface region has specific magnetisation states which depend on the ferromagnet orientation...|$|R

60|$|So they {{returned}} to the room, which had been swept and garnished in their absence. No sooner had they entered it than the door opened and through it came long lines of Asiki priests, each of whom staggered beneath the weight of a hide bag that he bore upon his shoulder, which bags they piled up about the stone altar. Then, as though at some signal, each priest opened the mouth of his bag and Alan saw that they wee filled with <b>gold,</b> <b>gold</b> in <b>dust,</b> <b>gold</b> in nuggets, gold in vessels perfect or broken; more gold than Alan had ever seen before.|$|R

60|$|As {{they drew}} near to this wondrous and ghostly looking object Rachel saw piled around and beyond it many {{precious}} things. There was <b>gold</b> in <b>dust</b> and heaps, and rings and nuggets; there were shining stones, {{red and green}} and white, that she knew were jewels; there were tusks of ivory and carvings in ivory; there were karosses and furs mouldering to decay; there were grotesque gods, fetishes of wood and stone.|$|R

25|$|When {{new areas}} were explored, {{it was usually}} the gold (placer and then lode) and then silver that were taken into {{possession}} and extracted first.

25|$|The {{original}} narrative can {{be found}} in the rambling chronicle El Carnero of Juan Rodriguez Freyle. According to Freyle, zipa of the Muisca, in a ritual at Lake Guatavita near present-day Bogotá, was said to be covered with <b>gold</b> <b>dust,</b> which he then washed off in the lake while his attendants threw trinkets made of gold, emeralds, and precious stones into the lake.|$|E
25|$|A UK tour {{to promote}} Rendezvous {{in the autumn}} of 1977 marked her final public appearances. The closing night at the Royalty Theatre in London on 27 November 1977 was {{recorded}} for a live album, <b>Gold</b> <b>Dust,</b> which, because of technical problems in the recording of the electric guitar, was belatedly released in 1998 after most of the guitars had been re-recorded by Jerry Donahue.|$|E

5|$|William Monahan's screenplay, {{based on}} the novel of the same name by David Ignatius, {{examines}} contemporary tension between Western and Arab societies and the comparative effectiveness of technological and human counter-intelligence methods. The film was shot largely on location in the United States and Morocco, after authorities in Dubai refused permission to film there because of the script's political themes. The film's photography sought to emphasize the contrast between the <b>gold</b> and <b>dust</b> of the desert and Arab cities, and the blue and gray of bureaucracy and Washington. Accordingly, they used natural light wherever possible. Marc Streitenfeld arranged the musical score.|$|R
60|$|Thus {{the weeks}} {{went on and}} soon, {{although}} they sold few of the pearls, and those the smallest, for of the larger gems they said little or nothing, they began to grow rich, and to hoard up such a weight of <b>gold</b> in <b>dust</b> and nuggets, and so many precious things, that they scarcely knew {{what they should do}} with them. Still Tat seemed to be a peaceful city, or at the least none tried to rob or molest them, perhaps because a rumour was abroad that these strangers who had come out of the Unknown were under the protection of some god.|$|R

25|$|In Greek mythology, Colchis was the {{location}} of the Golden Fleece sought by Jason and the Argonauts in Apollonius Rhodius' epic tale Argonautica. The incorporation of the Golden Fleece into the myth may have derived from the local practice of using fleeces to sift <b>gold</b> <b>dust</b> from rivers. Known to its natives as Egrisi or Lazica, Colchis was also the battlefield of the Lazic War fought between the Byzantine Empire and Sassanid Persia.|$|E
25|$|Baruch's tomb is a {{mile away}} from that of Ezekiel, near Mashhad Ali; and a Jewish rabbinic source {{reported}} that a strange plant, the leaves of which are sprinkled with <b>gold</b> <b>dust,</b> grows on it. According to the Syriac Apocalypse of Baruch, he was translated to paradise in his mortal body. The same is stated in Derekh Eretz Zuta (i.) of Ebed-Melech. Those who regard Baruch and Ebed-melech as identical find this deduction is evident.|$|E
25|$|A one-disc {{compilation}} of Denny's solo BBC recordings {{was released on}} Strange Fruit Records as The BBC Sessions 1971–1973 in 1997 that due to rights issues was withdrawn {{on the day of}} release, thereby creating a highly collectible disc (up until the release of the comprehensive Live at the BBC box set in 2007). This release was quickly followed in 1998 when Denny's final performance at the Royalty Theatre, entitled <b>Gold</b> <b>Dust,</b> was issued on CD.|$|E

25|$|Such methods {{could be}} very {{effective}} in opencast mining, but fire-setting was very dangerous when used in underground workings. They were made redundant {{with the introduction of}} explosives, although hydraulic mining is still used on alluvial tin ores. They were also used to produce a controlled supply to wash the crushed ore. It is highly likely that they also developed water-powered stamp mills to crush hard ore, which could be washed to collect the heavy <b>gold</b> <b>dust.</b>|$|E
25|$|Mining in Egypt {{occurred}} in the earliest dynasties. The gold mines of Nubia were among {{the largest and most}} extensive of any in Ancient Egypt. These mines are described by the Greek author Diodorus Siculus, who mentions fire-setting as one method used to break down the hard rock holding the gold. One of the complexes is shown in one of the earliest known maps. The miners crushed the ore and ground it to a fine powder before washing the powder for the <b>gold</b> <b>dust.</b>|$|E
