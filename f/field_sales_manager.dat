5000|$|Five major {{activities}} {{are involved in}} staffing a sales force. They must be divided into related steps. The first step is plan the recruiting and selection process. The responsibilities associated with this step are generally assigned to top sales executives, the <b>field</b> <b>sales</b> <b>manager</b> or the human resources manager. [...] The company wants {{to determine the number}} and type of people needed, which involves analyzing the market and the job and preparing a written job description. The qualifications of the job must be established to fill the job. Second, the recruiting phase includes identifying sources of recruits that are consistent with the type of person desired, selecting the source to be used and contacting the recruits. You need to weigh out the options and evaluate its potential effectiveness versus its costs. Third, select the most qualified applicants. The selection phase has three steps, in the planning phase there may be qualifications specified and in the first step it is necessary to design a system for measuring the recruits against the standards from the planning phase. Then the system must be put into effect with the new applicants and then making the actual selection is the final step. The fourth activity is to hire those people who have been selected. Just because one makes an offer doesn’t mean that the job is done. One must convince a recruit that the job offers everything that they need and want to get them to join a company or at least consider it. The fifth activity is to assimilate the new hires into the company. This is done by placing them under direction of an employee in the firm and possibly giving them a mentor to help them feel comfortable working in the firm and going through the training programs.|$|E
40|$|Advances in {{communication}} {{and information technology}} have fundamentally changed managerial monitoring. No longer is the <b>field</b> <b>sales</b> <b>manager</b> cut off from his geographically dispersed sales personnel as e-monitoring allows continual rather than intermittent views {{of a wide range}} of indicators with copious detail. Given this change in monitoring, we examined the possible effect it may have on customer orientation. Conceptually, customer orientation levels should be enhanced when e-monitoring purposes serve informational purposes and be impeded with controlling purposes. We gathered responses from field salespeople employed in the manufacturing sector and found some support for these expected effects. Customer orientation levels are higher when the predominant purpose of e-monitoring is to provide information. Thus efforts on the part of the manager to clarify the fact that e-monitoring is predominantly serving informational purposes will be worthwhile. Contrary to expectations our HLM moderator analyses indicate the reaction to either control or inform purposes in a very bureaucratic culture is less dramatic than that expressed in a less bureaucratic one. In low –rather than high -bureaucratic cultural contexts, informing attributions help and controlling hurt customer orientation. A firm which is not highly bureaucratic but uses e-monitoring as a control mechanism, then it may be giving mixed messages to the salesperson with a resultant level of confusion and lack of customer-orientation. A firm which is not highly bureaucratic and uses e-monitoring to empower or inform may be more focused and effective in gaining higher levels of customer orientation from their field salespeople...|$|E

40|$|Purpose - This paper aims to {{find out}} what characterises {{salespeople}} in the most effective salesforce in Spain. Design/methodology/approach - An empirical analysis has been done with 108 <b>field</b> <b>sales</b> <b>managers</b> from different sectors of activity to determine the conditions of the salesperson's control, professionalism and behaviour that affect his/her performance and the effectiveness of companies. A structural equations model or second generation multivariate model was used - PLS. Findings - The results show that more effective salesforces are controlled through behaviour control systems, salespersons in this team identify with the company's strategic objectives and an important part of their remuneration is based on a fixed salary. Research limitations/implications - First, the information has been gathered on a unique hierarchical level - team managers. Second, the company's activity sector and the type of salesperson can modify the results. Finally, the size of the sample has limited the potential application of specific statistical techniques and even the generalisation of the results. Practical implications - <b>Field</b> <b>sales</b> <b>managers</b> must help to define the salespeople's tasks to reach the company's objectives in the most effective way. This situation implies, logically, that control is exerted over behaviour {{and to a lesser extent}} over the results achieved by the salesperson. Originality/value - The paper determines those variables which allow companies, and especially those persons holding responsibility in the salesforce, to increase their effectiveness. The objective enriches the knowledge on sales effectiveness and also applies, in the Spanish case, a study methodology that has been applied in other countrie...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{describe}} different strategic roles of the <b>sales</b> <b>manager</b> in key account management. This thesis looks at the different strategic roles of the key account management (KAM) {{from the perspective of}} the <b>sales</b> <b>manager.</b> Previous researches have mainly based on fact that <b>sales</b> <b>manager</b> responds to top-management, and key account <b>manager</b> responds to <b>sales</b> <b>manager.</b> <b>Sales</b> <b>manager</b> is typically seen as key account manager’s direct superior and at the same time, <b>sales</b> <b>manager</b> is responsible for key account manager’s performance to the top-management. According Flaherty and others (2012) sales literature follows a top-down approach and based on sales management specific behaviors to improve poor performance. Nevertheless, today’s research has had more nuances that <b>sales</b> <b>manager’s</b> and key account managers job is more collaboration. Reality of today’s <b>sales</b> <b>manager</b> role have changed from top-down, leader-centered paradigm to more like collaboration which comes a vast network of complex relationships (Flaherty and others 2012). This thesis tries to show that <b>sales</b> <b>manager’s</b> role is not only to be key account managers superior. Key account <b>manager’s</b> and <b>sales</b> <b>manager’s</b> dynamic relationship is unnerved in previous researches. Actually, key account <b>manager</b> and <b>sales</b> <b>manager</b> has intense interaction and the information flows one to another and also they both effect on each other’s performance. <b>Sales</b> <b>manager</b> and key account manager, as a conclusion, can be seen as team more than monitored — supervisor partners. According Flaherty and others (2012) reality of today’s <b>sales</b> <b>manager</b> role have changed from top-down, leader- centered paradigm to more like collaboration which comes a vast network of complex relationships. The findings from the interview shows the same; all the interviewees said that nowadays <b>sales</b> <b>managers</b> should collaborate with KAMs. Still, there are seen the effect of regulations, rules and laws which change the style of leadership. Also <b>sales</b> <b>manager</b> take part on operative work. The previous academic literature stated that <b>sales</b> <b>manager</b> position is like invisible. That means <b>sales</b> <b>manager</b> won’t take part that much on operative work. In every interview the result was that operative work with customers is one part of every <b>sales</b> <b>manager</b> job in practice. Motivating KAMs to perform better is important. In a sales oriented organizations everybody knows how much the expected sales target are for KAM’s and at the same time <b>sales</b> <b>manager</b> need to provide all the needed rules that KAM’s could achieve those sales targets. Also this thesis finds out that organizational culture could effect on <b>sales</b> <b>manager’s</b> performance. It could create boundaries between <b>sales</b> <b>manager</b> and KAM but also it could provide framework which help everyday operations in the organization...|$|R

40|$|The {{pursuit of}} {{superior}} salesperson performance {{and higher levels}} of sales organization effectiveness is a growing management priority. Management control is an important antecedent to several aspects of salesperson performance and organizational effectiveness. However, prior research has neglected two important issues. First, the impact of market orientation on <b>sales</b> <b>manager</b> control approaches has not been previously considered. Second, <b>sales</b> <b>manager</b> competencies in behavior-based control have not been examined, as research has focused on the level and form of control. Market orientation and the critical sales skills required of salespeople have strong antecedent relationships with <b>sales</b> <b>manager</b> control. Also, <b>sales</b> <b>manager</b> control competencies {{play a significant role in}} shaping salesperson performance, and the impact of control competencies is larger than control level. <b>Sales</b> <b>manager</b> control competencies play an important mediating role between <b>sales</b> <b>manager</b> control level and salesperson performance and sales organization effectiveness. Our findings are based on a study of British companies in which five hundred <b>sales</b> <b>managers</b> were sent surveys and 300 usable responses (a response rate of 60 %) were returned, Three important implications derived from this study include: (1) <b>sales</b> <b>managers</b> need to translate market orientation into sales force behaviors; (2) control strategy should be aligned with sales force priorities; and (3) time and resources should be invested in training <b>sales</b> <b>managers.</b> (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{research}} a <b>sales</b> <b>manager’s</b> social network and demonstrate that <b>sales</b> <b>managers</b> who are central in closure structures of an advice network achieve high sales performance. Considering the results obtained and the discussion provided in the hypotheses presentation, we argue that <b>sales</b> <b>managers</b> must have accurate perceptions of their network. Two different networks were analyzed: friendship and advice; and we also considered two different views of network structure that claim to make an impact on performance and, to explore this claim, we examined whether <b>sales</b> <b>managers,</b> in order to improve sales performance, develop either a highly cohesive network or one containing structural holes. Census data was collected from over 500 personnel of an agricultural input retailer with 23 divisions. Estimates from a sample of 101 <b>sales</b> <b>managers</b> demonstrated, in the advice network, how important a highly cohesive structure is to a <b>sales</b> <b>manager’s</b> performance. These results suggest that firms should encourage contacts among their personnel to disseminate and share technical and commercial information. By stimulating cohesive structures of contacts for the purpose of receiving advice, firms create an environment for <b>sales</b> <b>managers</b> to develop relationships of trust in which social norms prevail.

40|$|Fluctuation poses an {{extremely}} important problem in the <b>field</b> of <b>sales</b> management and, therefore, {{it is necessary to}} research continually its impact on the company as a whole.

Results of research conducted on a sample of <b>sales</b> <b>managers</b> show their belief in the honesty of reasons reported by the sales staff for leaving the company, the importance of financial factors as well as numerous material and non-material instruments of motivation employed in order to keep the fluctuation under control because it creates expenses for the company and increases their own workload, among other reasons. Most sales staff reported a wish for career advancement as their primary motivation for changing jobs, claiming that they are prepared to inform their superiors of that decision without hiding the real reasons etc. From this research it is possible to observe both perspectives – that of <b>sales</b> <b>managers</b> as well as that of the sales staff they manage.
