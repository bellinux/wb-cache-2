5|$|New {{classical}} economics <b>had</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> {{the inherent}} contradiction of the neoclassical synthesis: Walrasian microeconomics with market clearing and general equilibrium could {{not lead to}} Keynesian macroeconomics where markets failed to clear. New Keynesians recognized this paradox, but, while the new classicals abandoned Keynes, new Keynesians abandoned Walras and market clearing.|$|E
5|$|The {{calculations}} given above produce {{dates in}} radiocarbon years: i.e. dates {{that represent the}} age the sample {{would be if the}} / ratio had been constant historically. Although Libby <b>had</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> as early as 1955 the possibility that this assumption was incorrect, it was not until discrepancies began to accumulate between measured ages and known historical dates for artefacts that it became clear that a correction would need to be applied to radiocarbon ages to obtain calendar dates.|$|E
5|$|From the 1890s through 1906, Tesla spent a {{great deal}} of his time and fortune on a series of {{projects}} trying to develop the transmission of electrical power without wires. It was an expansion of his idea of using coils to transmit power he had been demonstrating in wireless lighting. He could see this as not only a way to transmit large amounts of power around the world but also, as he <b>had</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> in his earlier lectures, a way to transmit worldwide communications.|$|E

5|$|Macrae, Ismay and Churchill all saw fit {{to record}} these {{arguments}} over the technical issue of stickiness. As Eden <b>had</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out,</b> {{there was a}} lot at stake. The British infantry and Home Guard had little with which to put up a fight against tanks and to any who had witnessed trials of Molotov Cocktails and SIP grenades it was evident that they could do little to a modern tank other than to provide a blinding pall of smoke. What was needed was a hand weapon to deliver a coup de grâce by punching through the armoured plate. The sticky bomb could do the job and little else was available.|$|E
5|$|The hearing never occurred, as {{the black}} militiamen, outnumbered and outgunned, refused to attend court. This upset the white mob, which {{expected}} an apology. Butler demanded that the militiamen give one, {{and as part of}} the apology, surrender their arms. Those who attempted to mediate found that neither Butler nor the armed men who backed him were interested in compromise. If the militiamen surrendered their arms, they would be helpless before the mob; if they did not, Butler and his men would use force. Butler brought additional men in from Georgia, and the augmented armed mob, including Tillman, went to confront the militiamen, who were barricaded in their drill room, above a local store. Shots were fired, and after one white man was killed, the rest stormed the room and captured about thirty of the militia. Five were murdered as having white enemies; among the dead was a town constable who had arrested white men. The rest were allowed to flee, with shots fired after them. At least seven black militiamen were killed in the incident. On the way home to Edgefield, Tillman and others had a meal to celebrate the events at the home of the man who <b>had</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> which African Americans should be shot.|$|E

NISA and NSA were accused of neglect because they did not instruct TEPCO to implement the necessary measures.|$|E
25|$|The {{current flag}} {{was used by}} the Georgian {{patriotic}} movement following the country's independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. By the late 1990s, the design had become widely known as the Georgian historical national flag as vexillologists <b>had</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> the red-on-white Jerusalem cross shown as the flag of Tbilisi in a 14th-century map by Domenico and Francesco Pizzigano.|$|E
25|$|Cockcroft had {{stated that}} they were {{receiving}} too few neutrons from the device to measure their spectrum or their direction.

25|$|Other bodies {{such as the}} Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (ISPCC; before 1956 the NSPCC) {{were also}} {{involved}} in sending needy children to the institutions, for want of alternatives.

In the 1940s the Society <b>had</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that higher social welfare payments to poor families would be cheaper than paying the capitation amounts to industrial schools.|$|E
25|$|Henry Cavendish in 1784 (in an {{unpublished}} manuscript) and Johann Georg von Soldner in 1801 (published in 1804) <b>had</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that Newtonian gravity {{predicts that}} starlight will bend around a massive object. The same value as Soldner's {{was calculated by}} Einstein in 1911 based on the equivalence principle alone. However, Einstein noted in 1915 {{in the process of}} completing general relativity, that his (and thus Soldner's) 1911 result is only half of the correct value. Einstein became the first to calculate the correct value for light bending.|$|E

25|$|In 2010, {{following}} the $39 billion 2G spectrum scam, Etisalat DB, the Indian {{subsidiary of the}} company, was stopped from buying a stake in a Chennai-based company due to objections raised by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). Etisalat DB {{was not allowed to}} buy back the 5.27 per cent stake held by Chennai-based Genex Exim Ventures since the home ministry raised objections based largely on security concerns. The MHA <b>had</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> four issues that needed to be resolved before allowing the company to come into Etisalat DB, a company that got scarce 2G spectrum at allegedly throwaway prices.|$|E
25|$|Brandeis was {{becoming}} increasingly conscious of and hostile to powerful corporations and {{the trend toward}} bigness in American industry and finance. He argued bigness conflicted with efficiency and added {{a new dimension to}} the Efficiency Movement of the Progressive Era. As early as 1895 he <b>had</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> the harm that giant corporations could do to competitors, customers, and their own workers. The growth of industrialization was creating mammoth companies which he felt threatened the well-being of millions of Americans. Although the Sherman Anti-Trust Act was enacted in 1890, {{it was not until the}} 20th century that there was any major effort to apply it.|$|E
25|$|There were {{questions}} about the actual content of the map. Witten <b>had</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that it bore strong resemblances to a map made in the 1430s by Italian mariner Andrea Bianco, but others found some of {{the similarities and differences}} very strange—the map cuts off Africa where Bianco's map has a page fold, but distorts shapes, and includes major revisions in the far east and west. The most surprising revision is that, unlike, for example, the famous Cantino World Map, the Vinland Map depicts Greenland as an island, remarkably close to the correct shape and orientation (while Norway, of which Greenland was just a colony, is wildly inaccurate) although contemporary Scandinavian accounts—including the work of Claudius Clavus in the 1420s—depict Greenland as a peninsula joined to northern Russia. For practical purposes, Arctic sea ice may have made this description true, and Greenland is not known to have been successfully circumnavigated until the 20th century. Skelton wondered also whether the revisions in the far east were meant to represent Japan—they seem to show not only Honshu, but also Hokkaido and Sakhalin, omitted even from Oriental maps in the 15th century.|$|E

25|$|PAF {{fighter pilots}} {{were sent to}} West Pakistan via Burma on 8 December and 9 December {{when it became clear}} at least 36 hours of {{uninterrupted}} work was needed to fix the runways and the ack-ack units were unable to keep the IAF away. Pakistani authorities claimed that between 4–15 December the IAF lost 22 to 24 aircraft (7 to the PAF and the rest to ack-ack units). The IAF records 19 aircraft lost in East Pakistan, 3 in air combat, 6 to accidents and the rest to ack-ack, while 5 Sabres were shot down by IAF planes. After the liberation of Dhaka, 13 airframes were found at the Tejgaon airport by the Mitro Bahini in various states of sabotage. 2 T-33 trainers were inoperable, but 8 Sabres were made operational later. 5 of these frames were incorporated in the Bangladesh Air Force in 1972. Pakistan Armed Forces Headquarters had issued orders to blow up the aircraft, but Air Commodore Enam <b>had</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that the sight of burning planes would demoralize the Pakistani troops defending Dacca. Therefore, PAF personnel destroyed the ammunition stocks and sabotaged the electric and hydraulic systems of the aircraft on 15 December.|$|E
25|$|Al-Shehhi {{returned}} to Miami on 2 May. That day, Atta and Jarrah were together, about 30 {{miles to the}} north, visiting a Department of Motor Vehicles office in Lauderdale Lakes, Florida, to get Florida driver's licenses. In mid-July 2001, some of the hijackers {{and members of the}} Hamburg cell gathered near Salou, Spain, for a period of a few days up to a couple of weeks. Since hotel records are sparse during some of that time, it is thought that they may have spent considerable time in and around safe houses related to the al-Qaeda leader in Spain, Imad Yarkas. After 9/11, Spanish investigators followed the trails backwards, and the events they uncovered were chronicled in the Spanish nationwide newspaper El País. Witnesses told Spanish investigators they saw a man who resembled al-Shehhi on 17 July 2001 at the Universal Studios PortAventura theme park next to Salou, Spain. The visitor, who was accompanied by two men, inquired about rides at the customer service counter. Witnesses indicated these companions resembled Ziad Jarrah, the later pilot on United Airlines Flight 93, and Said Bahaji, a then 26-year-old German-Moroccan member of the al-Qaeda cell in Hamburg. Back in Germany, it had been Bahaji's 1999 wedding during which al-Shehhi was filmed. Other witnesses elsewhere <b>had</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> Bahaji from photos, as one of the men they saw in Spain. But Bahaji bore a resemblance in appearance to Atta, who was traced to the same areas in Spain via hotel and travel records.|$|E
25|$|Starting in June 2006, Senior Vice President Richard M. Bowen III, {{the chief}} {{underwriter}} of Citigroup's Consumer Lending Group, began warning {{the board of}} directors about the extreme risks being taken on by the mortgage operation that could potentially result in massive losses. The group bought and sold $90 billion of residential mortgages annually. Bowen's responsibility was essentially to serve as the quality control supervisor ensuring the unit's creditworthiness. When Bowen first blew the whistle in 2006, 60% of the mortgages were defective. The amount of bad mortgages began increasing throughout 2007 and eventually exceeded 80% of the volume. Many of the mortgages were not only defective, but were fraudulent. Bowen attempted to rouse the board via weekly reports and other communications. On November 3, 2007, Bowen emailed Citigroup Chairman Robert Rubin and the bank's chief financial officer, head auditor and the chief risk management officer to again expose the risk and potential losses, claiming that the group's internal controls had broken down and requesting an outside investigation of his business unit. The subsequent investigation revealed that at the Consumer Lending Group had suffered a breakdown of internal controls since 2005. Regardless of the findings of the investigation, Bowen's charges were ignored, despite the fact that withholding such information from shareholders violated the Sarbanes–Oxley Act (SOX), which he <b>had</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out.</b> Citigroup CEO Charles Prince signed a certification that the bank was in compliance with SOX despite Bowen revealing this wasn't so. Citigroup eventually stripped Bowen of most of his responsibilities and informing him that his physical presence was no longer required at the bank. The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission asked him to testify about Citigroup's role in the mortgage crisis, and he did so, appearing {{as one of the first}} witnesses before the Commission in April 2010.|$|E
