25|$|In {{spite of}} Can-Car's success in other markets, {{as early as}} 1981 the {{government}} had considered selling UTDC to the private sector. Their concern was that without a manufacturing business, UTDC would {{find it difficult to}} make enough income to justify its Kingston operations. If the company did start a manufacturing side, it would be inappropriate for the company to remain government owned. The Can-Car deal put this on <b>hold</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> time.|$|E
25|$|With {{full-time}} assistant {{coaching and}} {{graduate school at}} Hofstra, jiu-jitsu {{had to be put}} on <b>hold</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while. While coaching, Weidman trained for the Olympic trials. When his dream was not attained, Weidman had to decide if he wanted to continue training for the world teams and Olympics or give MMA a shot. Toribio brought Weidman to Ray Longo's MMA Academy and introduced Weidman to Longo. With his noticeable technique and skills, Weidman was encouraged to train full-time to fight. In 2011, Longo and Weidman LAW MMA opened, where they are instructors, owners and operators in Garden City, New York.|$|E

25|$|During {{this period}} Westinghouse {{continued}} to pour money and engineering resources into {{the goal of}} building a completely integrated AC system, obtaining the Sawyer–Man lamp by buying Consolidated Electric Light, developing components such as an induction meter, and obtaining the rights to inventor Nikola Tesla's brushless AC induction motor along with patents for {{a new type of}} electric power distribution, polyphase alternating current. The acquisition of a feasible AC motor gave Westinghouse a key patent for his system, but the financial strain of buying up patents and hiring the engineers needed to build it meant development of Tesla's motor had to be put on <b>hold</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while.|$|E
25|$|Originally named RMS Port Kingston, she {{was built}} by Alexander Stephen and Sons of Govan on the River Clyde. She had been ordered by the Imperial Direct West Mail Company of Bristol, who were a {{subsidiary}} of Elder Dempster Shipping Limited. She was intended for the Bristol to Kingston, Jamaica route, which {{she was able to}} cover in ten and a half days. She had accommodation for 277 first class, 97-second and 141 third class passengers on four decks and had a crew of 135. Besides carrying mail, she had a <b>hold</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> cargo of fruit. Port Kingston survived the 1907 Kingston earthquake and although beached, was successfully refloated. She was laid-up in 1910.|$|E
25|$|On {{the first}} drive of the game, the Huskies easily moved {{forward on the}} Irish defense, however, were held without scoring when quarterback, Isaiah Stanback's pass to Craig Chambers was fumbled on the goal line and {{recovered}} by the Irish. The Irish didn't score on their first drive when the <b>hold</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> field goal attempt was botched. However, on their next drive the D.J. Fitzpatrick kicked a 25-yard field goal for the only score of the first quarter. In the second quarter, Evan Knudson tied the game on a 27-yard field goal. On the next drive, Darius Walker ran for a 17-yard touchdown, giving the Irish a 9-3 lead after a missed extra point. Fitzpatrick kicked another field goal of 39-yards to end scoring {{in the first half}} with the Irish leading 12-3.|$|E

25|$|Besides, Landale {{was one of}} {{the leading}} {{businessmen}} in the colony who repeatedly opposed the introduction of income tax. As early as during the Second World War, the government proposed for the introduction of the tax to support the British war effort in Europe and to subsidise the local defence budget. Landale {{was one of the}} members who were appointed to the War Revenue Committee by the government in October 1939, which was tasked to offer advice on the proposed new tax. The Committee later submitted its report in February 1940 in which Landale and other members expressed strong reservations about the tax proposal. Despite of their reservations, the government eventually managed to secure the support of the Committee to introduce the income tax in April 1940, having promised that the tax, as an interim measure to generate war revenue, would be repealed after the war. Ironically, although the government did repeal the tax after the war as promised, the tax was soon re-introduced in 1947, a move which was strongly opposed by Landale and other unofficial members of the Legislative Council. In response to the tax proposal, Landale requested that it should be put on <b>hold</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> year to have sufficient time for further review, but his request was turned down by the government. After heated debates, the bill to reintroduce the tax was read a third time and was passed in the Legislative Council in May 1947, notwithstanding that it was rarely voted against by three unofficial members, namely Chau Tsun-nin, Chau Sik-nin and Leo d'Almada e Castro. Landale, however, was compelled to vote for the Bill during the division.|$|E
500|$|By May 1910 Stravinsky was {{discussing}} his idea with Nicholas Roerich, the foremost Russian expert on folk art and ancient rituals. Roerich {{had a reputation}} as an artist and mystic, and had provided the stage designs for Diaghilev's 1909 production of the Polovtsian Dances. The pair quickly agreed on a working title, [...] "The Great Sacrifice" [...] (Russian: Velikaia zhertva); Diaghilev gave his blessing to the work, although the collaboration was put on <b>hold</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> year while Stravinsky was occupied with his second major commission for Diaghilev, the ballet Petrushka.|$|E
500|$|After the foundry {{closed in}} 1986, Diffie {{declared}} bankruptcy {{and sold the}} studio out of financial necessity. He also divorced his wife, who left with their two children. Diffie spent several months {{in a state of}} depression before deciding to move to Nashville, Tennessee. There, he took a job at Gibson Guitar Corporation. While at Gibson, he contacted a songwriter and recorded more demos, including songs that would later be recorded by Ricky Van Shelton, Billy Dean, Alabama, and The Forester Sisters. By mid-1989, he quit working at the company in order to record demos full-time. Diffie also met Debbie, who would later become his second wife. That same year, Diffie was contacted by Bob Montgomery, a songwriter and record producer known for working with Buddy Holly. Montgomery, who was then the vice president of A at Epic Records, said that he wanted to sign Diffie to a contract with the label, but had to put the singer on <b>hold</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> year. In the meantime, Holly Dunn released [...] "There Goes My Heart Again", which Diffie co-wrote and sang the backing vocals. Following this song's chart success, Diffie signed with Epic in early 1990.|$|E

500|$|Honeyslug and Hogg {{entered the}} game into the Eurogamer Indie Showcase and Independent Games Festival halfway through 2010 and {{spent two weeks}} {{polishing}} a rough draft. They then put the game on <b>hold</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> year starting in 2011 while they developed another game, Frobisher Says. Digital Trends described the other game as containing [...] "the DNA of Hogg's artistic vision for Hohokum". Hogg described the team's working relationship as informal and their decision-making as fully collaborative, particularly in {{the feel of the}} game world. For instance, Hogg would give unplanned drawings to Haggett, who would work the art into the game, or Haggett would envision something and ask Haggett to make it [...] "look nice". Hogg was not as involved in the [...] "nitty-gritty of gameplay and puzzle mechanics" [...] due to his skill set. His interest in mixed metaphors and making the familiar seem unfamiliar is one of the game's guiding philosophies. The name of the snakelike Long Mover is a reference to a snake in a skit by British comedy troupe The Mighty Boosh. It was chosen to be purposefully more ambiguous than a specific, existing creature, and to have mythical connotations. The game's title is based on a misspelling of the Hohokam American Southwest archaeological culture.|$|E

2500|$|Asana is thus {{a posture}} that one can <b>hold</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> period of time, staying relaxed, steady, {{comfortable}} and motionless. Patanjali does not list any specific asana, except the terse suggestion, [...] "posture one can hold with comfort and motionlessness". Āraṇya translates verse II.47 of Yoga sutra as, [...] "asanas are perfected over time by relaxation of effort with meditation on the infinite"; this combination and practice stops the quivering of body. The posture that causes pain or restlessness is not a yogic posture. Other secondary texts studying Patanjali's sutra state that one requirement of correct posture is to keep breast, neck and head erect (proper spinal posture).|$|E
2500|$|If {{a trustee}} has broken a duty {{owed to the}} trust, there are three main remedies. First, {{specific}} performance may generally be awarded {{in cases where the}} beneficiary merely wishes to compel a trustee to follow the trust's terms, or to prevent an anticipated breach. Second, for losses, beneficiaries may claim compensation. The applicable principles are disputed, given the historical language of requiring a trustee to [...] "account" [...] for things which go wrong. One view suggested that at the very moment a trustee breaches a duty, for instance by making an erroneous investment without considering relevant matters, beneficiaries have a right to see the trust accounts are surcharged, to erase the transpiring loss (and [...] "falsified" [...] to restore to the trust fund unauthorised gains). In Target Holdings Ltd v Redferns the argument was taken to a new level, where a solicitor (a fiduciary, like a trustee) was given £1.5m by Target Holdings Ltd to <b>hold</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> loan for some property developers, but released the money before it was meant to (when purchase of the development property was completed). The money did reach the developers, but the venture was a flop, and money lost. Target Holdings Ltd attempted to sue Redferns for the whole sum, but the House of Lords held that the loss was caused by the venture flop, not the solicitor's action outside instructions. It was, however, observed that the common law rules of remoteness would not apply. Similarly in Swindle v Harrison a solicitor, Mr Swindle, could not be sued for the loss of Ms Harrison's second home's value after he gave her negligent and dishonest advice about loans, because she would have taken the loan and made the purchase anyway, and the house value drop was unrelated to his breach of duty.|$|E
