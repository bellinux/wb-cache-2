5|$|Two Air Corps historians {{state that}} no {{evidence}} exists that the Navy {{was behind the}} order. One explained that Craig believed the Air Corps violated War Department policy on publicity, while the second asserted that Craig was unhappy about not being provided details of the mission before it was publicly announced, and thus issued the order to ensure full notification before granting exceptions to the restriction. Deputy chief of staff Embick made {{the claim that the}} restriction had been issued only as a safety measure. Greer, however, in his history of Air Corps doctrine, firmly attributes the restriction to the Navy, noting that in November 1938 it achieved a new modification of the <b>Joint</b> <b>Action</b> statement specifically granting it the authorization for long-range land-based flights that the Army was denied, and immediately prepared six major bases to conduct them. A fourth historian, in a biography of Arnold, stated that the restriction had actually been promulgated on 1 September 1936, at the insistence of the Navy, but was not enforced by Craig until after the Rex incident.|$|E
5|$|Theodotus' {{success was}} not to be completed, however as in early summer 830, a fleet from the Umayyad Emirate of Córdoba in al-Andalus, under Asbagh ibn Wakil, arrived in Sicily despite the {{political}} difference and rivalry between Abbasid Caliphate and the Umayyad Emirate of Cordoba, the latter sent military assistance for Aghlabids to conquer Sicily although the Aghlabids was clearly serving under Abbasid interest. Ibn Kathir recorded that 300 ships of Umayyad and Aghlabids joint forces were present. Theodotus did not confront them, hoping that they would depart after raiding, but the beleaguered garrison at Mineo managed to get into contact with the raiders and proposed <b>joint</b> <b>action.</b> The Andalusians agreed, provided that Asbagh was recognized as the overall commander, and together with fresh troops from Ifriqiya marched on Mineo. Unable to confront them, Theodotus retreated to Enna and the siege of Mineo was broken (July or August 830). The combined Ifriqiyan and Andalusian army then torched Mineo and laid siege to another town, possibly Calloniana (modern Barrafranca). However, once again a plague broke out in their camp, killing Asbagh and many others. The town fell later, in autumn, but the Arabs' numbers were so depleted that they had to abandon it and retreat west. Theodotus launched a pursuit and inflicted heavy casualties, so that most of the Andalusians departed the island. However, Theodotus too was killed at this time, possibly in one of these skirmishes.|$|E

40|$|Learning in {{coordination}} games {{has been}} extensively studied in the game theory and multi-agent learning literature. Most of this work has considered a low number of agents and/or states (typically two agent, two action games). When the number of states and/or <b>joint</b> <b>actions</b> increases, standard approaches for multi-agent learning have difficulties coping with {{a high number of}} agents due to the combinatorial explosion in the number of <b>joint</b> <b>actions</b> and <b>joint</b> states. In real-world applications, this is a common setting though. This paper introduces a methodology for learning to coordinate in stochastic games with many agents. More specifically, we introduce a structure where some agents have knowledge about <b>joint</b> <b>actions</b> and how they have performed in the past. We empirically investigate this method for multiagent learning in a typical stochastic game involving a high number of agents. Experimental results show that the additional information and structure is translated into earlier and higher levels of coordination and thus to higher payoffs...|$|R

40|$|Studies {{investigating}} <b>joint</b> <b>actions</b> {{have suggested}} {{a central role}} for the putative mirror neuron system (pMNS) because of the close link between perception and action provided by these brain regions [1, 2, 3]. In contrast, our previous {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) experiment demonstrated that the BOLD response of the pMNS does not suggest that it directly integrates observed and executed <b>actions</b> during <b>joint</b> <b>actions</b> [4]. To test whether the pMNS might contribute indirectly to the integration process by sending information to brain areas responsible for this integration (integration network), here we used Granger causality mapping (GCM) [5]. We explored the directional information flow between the anterior sites of the pMNS and previously identified integrative brain regions. We found that the left BA 44 sent more information than it received to both the integration network (left thalamus, right middle occipital gyrus and cerebellum) and more posterior nodes of the pMNS (BA 2). Thus, during <b>joint</b> <b>actions,</b> two anatomically separate networks therefore seem effectively connected and the information flow is predominantly from anterior to posterior areas of the brain. These findings suggest that the pMNS is involved indirectly in <b>joint</b> <b>actions</b> by transforming observed and executed actions into a common code and is part of a generative model that could predict the future somatosensory and visual consequences o...|$|R
