25|$|Greece has {{district}} heating {{mainly in the}} Province of Western Macedonia, Central Macedonia and the Peloponnese Province. The largest system is the city of Ptolemaida, where there are five power plants (thermal power stations or TPS in particular) providing heat {{to the majority of}} the largest towns and cities of the area and some villages. The first small installation took place in Ptolemaida in 1960, offering heating to Proastio village of Eordaea using the TPS of Ptolemaida. Today District <b>heating</b> <b>installations</b> are also available in Kozani, Ptolemaida, Amyntaio, Philotas, Serres and Megalopolis using nearby power plants. In Serres the power plant is a Hi-Efficiency CHP Plant using natural gas, while coal is the primary fuel for all other {{district heating}} networks.|$|E
25|$|Research {{has shown}} that the direct rebound effects for energy {{services}} is lower at high income levels, due to less price sensitivity. Studies have found that own-price elasticity of gas consumption by UK households was two times greater for households in the lowest income decile when compared to the highest decile. Studies have also observed higher rebounds in low-income houses for improvements in heating technology. Evaluation methods have also been used to assess the scale of rebound effects from efficient <b>heating</b> <b>installations</b> in lower income homes in the United Kingdom. This research found that direct effects are close to 100% in many cases. High income households in developed countries are likely to set the temperature at the optimum comfort level, regardless of the cost – therefore any cost reduction does not result in increased heating, for it was already optimal. But low-income households are more price sensitive, and have made thermal sacrifices due to the cost of heating. In this case, a high direct rebound is likely. This analogy can be extended to most household energy consumption.|$|E

40|$|This paper applies a semi-parametric {{approach}} to estimating a generalised model of investments in <b>heating</b> <b>installations.</b> The {{results suggest that}} marginal costs of investments in <b>heating</b> <b>installations</b> increase quickly at small investment levels, whereas the increase slows down at higher investment levels. Therefore, standard parametric adjustment cost models are probably biased such that they underestimate the costs of small investments and overestimate the costs of large investments. Results also show that investments in <b>heating</b> <b>installations</b> are very responsive to changes in energy prices. Therefore, an energy tax may be an effective instrument to encourage investments in new energy-saving <b>heating</b> <b>installations.</b> Copyright 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. ...|$|E
