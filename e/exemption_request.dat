Because organizational vaccination rates remained below target levels, influenza vaccination was made a condition of employment for all employees in 2008. Medical or religious <b>exemptions</b> could be <b>requested.</b> Predetermined medical contraindications include hypersensitivity to eggs, prior hypersensitivity reaction to influenza vaccine, and history of Guillan-Barre ́ syndrome. Medical <b>exemption</b> <b>requests</b> were reviewed by occupational health nurses and their medical directors.
