5|$|For {{the past}} ten years, the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) has been {{assisting}} Zimbabwe's farmers to adopt conservation agriculture techniques, a sustainable method of farming that can help increase yields. By applying the three principles of minimum soil disturbance, legume-based cropping {{and the use of}} organic mulch, <b>farmers</b> <b>can</b> improve infiltration, reduce evaporation and soil erosion, and build up organic soil content.|$|E
5|$|Both {{farmers and}} {{scientists}} must continually {{draw on the}} irreplaceable resource of genetic diversity to ensure productive harvests. While genetic variability provides farmers with plants that have a higher resilience to pests and diseases and allows scientists access to a more diverse genome than {{can be found in}} highly selected crops. The breeding of monocultural crops steadily reduces genetic diversity as desirable traits are selected, and undesirable traits are removed. <b>Farmers</b> <b>can</b> increase within-crop diversity to some extent by planting mixtures of crop varieties; they can further increase in-field diversity by polycultural practices such as intercropping and companion planting.|$|E

25|$|In 2011, {{property}} {{tax relief for}} 3,723 approved residential properties of Lakeland School District was set at $91. In 2009, the Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief from gambling for the Lakeland School District was $95 per approved permanent primary residence. In the district, 3,588 property owners applied for the tax relief. The relief was subtracted from the total annual school {{property tax}} bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. <b>Farmers</b> <b>can</b> qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes.

50|$|Most of {{the tanks}} are natural {{and do not}} involve heavy cost for their construction. Even an {{individual}} <b>farmer</b> <b>can</b> have his own tank. Tanks are generally constructed on rocky bed and have longer life span. In many tanks, fishing is also carried on. This supplements both the food resources and income of the farmer.|$|R
25|$|Within countries, {{capital and}} labor can be reinvested and reemployed to produce {{different}} outputs.

25|$|Scholars {{have argued}} that in farming systems where men {{do most of the}} {{agriculture}} work, a second wife can be an economic burden rather than an asset. In order to feed an additional wife, the husband must either work harder himself or he must hire laborers to do part of the work. In such regions, polygyny is either non-existent or is a luxury which only a small minority of rich <b>farmers</b> <b>can</b> indulge.|$|E

5000|$|It is very {{important}} to have planting equipment that can properly penetrate through the residue, into the soil and prepare a good seedbed. Switching to no-till reduces the maximum amount of power needed from farm tractors, which means that a <b>farmer</b> <b>can</b> farm under no-till with a smaller tractor than under tilling. [...] Using a smaller, lighter tractor has the added benefit of reducing compaction.|$|R
25|$|The outlay {{of money}} on {{equipment}} varies greatly. Some items commonly found on Christmas tree farms are insecticide sprayers, tractors, and shaper sheers. Mechanized planters, {{at a cost of}} about US$4,000, are not essential but a work-saving luxury for farmers. <b>Farmers</b> <b>can</b> purchase seedlings, the lifeblood of a Christmas tree farm, from nurseries. One farmer in Oregon purchased seedlings for between US$200–300 per 1,000plants. The farmer, a wholesaler, sold his final products for about $20each; after the cost of the trees and other expenses, a profit of $2–3per tree.|$|E
25|$|<b>Farmers</b> <b>can</b> use weather {{derivatives}} {{to hedge}} against poor harvests caused by failing rains {{during the growing}} period, excessive rain during harvesting, high winds in case of plantations or temperature variabilities in case of greenhouse crops; theme parks may want to insure against rainy weekends during peak summer seasons; and gas and power companies may use heating degree days (HDD) or cooling degree days (CDD) contracts to smooth earnings. A sports event managing company may wish to hedge the loss by entering into a weather derivative contract because if it rains {{the day of the}} sporting event, fewer tickets will be sold.|$|E
25|$|Wind {{power is}} a for-profit {{enterprise}} between land owners and wind farm operators. Texas <b>farmers</b> <b>can</b> lease their land to wind developers for either a set rental per turbine or for {{a small percentage of}} gross annual revenue from the project. This offers farmers a fresh revenue stream without impacting traditional farming and grazing practices. Although leasing arrangements vary widely, the U. S. Government Accountability Office reported in 2004 that a farmer who leases land to a wind project developer can generally obtain royalties of $3,000 to $5,000 per turbine per year in lease payments. These figures are rising as larger wind turbines are being produced and installed.|$|E

25|$|A {{buffer strip}} {{is an area}} of land {{maintained}} in permanent vegetation that helps to control air, soil, and water quality, along with other environmental problems, dealing primarily on land that is used in agriculture. Buffer strips trap sediment, and enhance filtration of nutrients and pesticides by slowing down runoff that could enter the local surface waters. The root systems of the planted vegetation in these buffers hold soil particles together which alleviate the soil of wind erosion and stabilize stream banks providing protection against substantial erosion and landslides. <b>Farmers</b> <b>can</b> also use buffer strips to square up existing crop fields to provide safety for equipment while also farming more efficiently.|$|E
25|$|The recent {{moves away}} from {{intervention}} buying, subsidies for specific crops, reductions in export subsidies, have changed the situation somewhat. In the past years intervention has been reduced or abolished in all sectors. After two decades of significant CAP reforms, <b>farmers</b> <b>can</b> now respond to market signals and increase production {{to react to the}} higher prices. Although the new decoupled payments were aimed at environmental measures, many farmers have found that without these payments their businesses {{would not be able to}} survive. With food prices dropping over the past thirty years in real terms, many products have been making less than their cost of production when sold at the farm gate.|$|E
25|$|The {{ecological}} and financial importance of natural pollination by insects to agricultural crops, improving their quality and quantity, {{becomes more and}} more appreciated and has given rise to new financial opportunities. The vicinity of a forest or wild grasslands with native pollinators near agricultural crops, such as apples, almonds or coffee can improve their yield by about 20%. The benefits of native pollinators may result in forest owners demanding payment for their contribution in the improved crop results– a simple example of the economic value of ecological services. <b>Farmers</b> <b>can</b> also raise native crops in order to promote native bee pollinator species as shown with L. vierecki in Delaware and L. leucozonium in southwest Virginia.|$|E
