30|$|Considering the CVs {{in section}} B, groups of {{respondents}} were {{ranked in the}} order in which mathematics was in use based on section B items of the questionnaire. Accordingly, the group consisting of students who had industrial training (SHIT, CV =  8.9) was ranked first, followed by the group for the mathematics engineering technician educators (METE, CV =  14.1), and then the group for the <b>electrical</b> <b>engineering</b> <b>technician</b> educators (EETE, CV =  14.1) while the group civil engineering technician educators (CETE, CV =  29.6) ranked last. Details of the assessment of section B based on CVs for other groups are presented in Table 1.|$|E
30|$|The {{observed}} {{value of the}} F-statistic was 6.71, while its corresponding tabulated value at the significance level α[*]=[*] 0.05 was 3.00. Thus, the null hypothesis was rejected, indicating {{the existence of a}} statistically significant difference in the mathematics taught to the civil, the electrical, and the mechanical engineering technical students with regard to relevance to the industries in Uganda of specific topics taught. Further analysis showed that the source of the statistical significance observed was due to the difference between the pairs of the groups: civil <b>engineering</b> <b>technicians</b> working in industries against <b>electrical</b> <b>engineering</b> <b>technicians</b> working in industries (CETI, EETI) and civil <b>engineering</b> <b>technicians</b> working in industries against mechanical <b>engineering</b> <b>technicians</b> working in industries (CETI, METI).|$|R

40|$|MTech. in Business Administration (MBA) Universities of {{technology}} and institutions {{of technology}} produce <b>electrical</b> <b>engineering</b> <b>technicians</b> and technologists who expect to be employed in the <b>electrical</b> <b>engineering</b> industry. One {{of the reasons for}} a shortage of skills is the perception that the engineering industry has concerns regarding the quality of qualified students from universities of technology, because graduates struggle to meet the expectations of the industry. The industry expects them to possess basic skills, which can be utilised immediately. Technological advancement is ongoing and appears that the curricula of tertiary institutions are not keeping abreast of changes. This study aims to establish the perception of the engineering industry of the quality of <b>electrical</b> <b>engineering</b> graduates leaving universities of technology in order to evaluate their employability. Universities of technology should regard industry as their main client, supplying firms with the type of product they need...|$|R
30|$|With {{respect to}} {{relevance}} to industry, while the mathematical {{view of the}} <b>engineering</b> <b>technicians</b> working in industry could significantly differ {{from that of the}} mathematics educators, there could exist a difference among the mathematical views of the civil, <b>electrical,</b> and mechanical <b>engineering</b> <b>technicians</b> working in industry (Markes 2006). Similarly, the views of the civil, <b>electrical,</b> and mechanical <b>engineering</b> mathematics educators might also differ. Further, {{on the question of the}} relevance of the mathematics taught to the needs of the industries, it is deemed in the study that there exists a difference in view of those students who have had and those who have not had practical industrial experience.|$|R

30|$|The {{hypotheses}} H 07 and H 08 were however rejected.
