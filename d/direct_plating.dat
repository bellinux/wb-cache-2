Quantification of Escherichia coli O 157 is also desirable. In two separate experiments, detection and enumeration of a nalidixic acid-resistant strain of E. coli O 157 in bovine feces {{was assessed by}} culture on MacConkey agar supplemented with nalidixic acid (MACnal) and compared to overnight broth enrichment followed by immunomagnetic separation (IMS) and to <b>direct</b> <b>plating</b> of dilutions of bovine feces onto sorbitol MacConkey agar containing cefixime and tellurite (SMACct). The sensitivity of detection of E. coli O 157 by both <b>direct</b> <b>plating</b> and IMS was highly dependent upon the initial concentration of the target organism in the sample. Sensitivity of detection by IMS was poor below 100 CFU/g but was better, and not affected by initial E. coli O 157 numbers, above this concentration. Sensitivity of detection of E. coli O 157 in bovine feces at low initial concentrations is very poor for both <b>direct</b> <b>plating</b> and IMS. <b>Direct</b> <b>plating</b> of dilutions of bovine feces on SMACct {{can be used to}} determine the magnitude of fecal E. coli excretion among cattle excreting greater than 100 CFU/g.

40|$|The {{nature of}} the cell surface {{components}} involved in donor cell clumping (Clu+) {{and the relationship of}} Clu+ to high frequency conjugal transfer of lactose utilization (Lac) in Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ML 3 was examined. Lactose positive (Lac+), Clu+ transconjugants, containing a novel 104 kilobase Lac plasmid, were obtained by mating ML 3 with LM 2301. When used as Lac+ donors in second round matings, these transconjugants transferred Lac at high frequencies ranging from 10 - 2 to 10 - 4 transconjugants per donor CFU. Treatment of donor cells with EDTA and EGTA containing solutions or proteolytic enzymes (proteinase K and chymotrypsin A) resulted in a loss of Clu+. By using a <b>direct</b> <b>plate</b> conjugation technique, these treatments also decreased the capacity for transferring Lac at high frequency. Analysis of cell-surface proteins by SOS-PAGE identified a novel protein of approximately 125 kDa which was present in Clu+ transconjugants, but not in non-clumping transconjugants. These results suggest that Clu+ is required for high frequency Lac transfer in ML 3 transconjugants, and at least one large protein is involved in Clu+.

Methods and Results: Two <b>direct</b> <b>plating</b> tools, the spiral plate count method (SPCM) and the hydrophobic grid membrane filtration (HGMF) method, were adapted to support quantification of Salmonella during poultry processing. Test samples consisted of 180 broiler carcasses from a commercial abattoir, 60 from each of three points in the processing line [pre-insideâoutside bird wash (pre- IOBW), prechill and postchill]. The SPCM was used to estimate Salmonella load in pre-IOBW rinses, while HGMF was used to estimate Salmonella levels in prechill and postchill rinses. Carcass rinses were also evaluated for Salmonella prevalence by enrichment methods.
