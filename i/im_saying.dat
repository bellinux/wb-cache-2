Taylor, assistant superintendent for curriculum, assessment and special programs; Marilyn J. Cain, assistant superintendent for elementary education; and Johannah M. Vanatta, assistant superintendent for secondary education.With the new contracts, Taylors salary will {{rise from the}} current $111,800 to $141,930 in July 2019; Vanattas will increase from $109,300 to $139,110.Cain — who intends to retire {{at the end of}} the 2017-18 school year, according to her contract — will see her pay increase from $139,400 to $147,358 during her final year.Over the course of their five-year contracts, Taylor and Vanatta will get 27-percent raises over their current salaries. Cain will see about a 6-percent increase over the three years of her deal.Board member Jeffrey A. Meyer voted against the contracts for Vanatta and Taylor but approved the three-year deal for Cain. He was the only member to vote against the contracts.“I just think the contract is on the rich side of the fence,” he said, adding, “I dont object to anyone trying to better themselves or provide for their family. All <b>Im</b> <b>saying</b> is enough is enough.”Board member Kathy A. Reid noted that Meyer had missed the discussion of the contracts during executive session, when the meetings are not public. Board member Annette Giovengo Nolish abstained on the contract vote and declined to explain afterwards, calling it a personnel matter.Assistant superintendents from districts of similar size in the county made an average of $127,872 last school year, according to a survey done by the district, North Hills spokeswoman Amanda Hartle said.Cain has worked all of her 47 years in education with North Hills.

Fortunately everybody (in the play) is incredibly talented (and) really lovely people too and it has been an incredible learning experience for me. Its not my responsibility to draw (the audience) in, I just have to play the character.

I feel rejuvenated by it, I feel excited again. Youre very much alive, youre very much in the moment, so I feel Im really living.After I released my solo record I felt really disappointed, I believed in the record I made but if you dont have the back-up of your record company investing and marketing it. Its a really tough job and because I wrote the whole thing I really believed in this record, as did Nellee Hooper, I was jaded and disappointed.Last year I decided Im not doing music until Im excited again, then this came along and also I did end up making another record which Ill release at some point. Its just being mastered, its a lovely album; I didnt write this one, this is old songs and I have to sort out my situation- I dont want the same problem as before.I think everybodys enjoyed doing their own thing.
