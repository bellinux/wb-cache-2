40|$|Recent {{failures}} and severe corrosion distress of post-tensioned (PT) bridges in Florida have revealed corrosion of the 7 -wire strands in tendons. Post-tensioned <b>duct</b> <b>assemblies</b> are fitted with multiple 7 -wire steel strands and ducts are subsequently filled with grout. During construction, {{the length of}} time from the moment in which the strands have been inserted into the ducts, until the ducts are grouted, {{is referred to as the}} `ungrouted 2 ̆ 7 period. During this phase, the steel strands are vulnerable to corrosion and consequently the length of this period is restricted (typically to 7 days) by construction guidelines. This investigation focuses on determining the extent of corrosion that may take place during that period, but limited to strands that were in the unstressed condition. Visual inspections and tensile testing were used to identify trends in corrosion development. Corrosion induced cracking mechanisms were also investigated via wire bending and metallographic cross section evaluation. Corrosion damage on unstressed strands during ungrouted periods of durations in the order of those otherwise currently prescribed did not appear to seriously degrade mechanical performance as measured by standardized tests. However the presence of stress in the ungrouted period, as is normally the case, may activate other mechanisms (e. g., EAC) that require further investigation. As expected in the unstressed condition, no evidence of transverse cracking was observed...|$|R
40|$|This project’s sponsor is Swanton Pacific Railroad, a 1 / 3 scale {{railroad}} in Santa Cruz, CA. Our {{team was}} given the task of upgrading a maintenance cart used to clear debris from the track and level the gravel ballast during maintenance projects. Our focus was to upgrade the blowing system used to clear any debris. The current system used is a hydraulic fan with a single length of ducting serving as its outlet. Our solution is to mount two Stihl backpack leaf blowers to manufactured saddles and mount the assembly to the cart {{in place of the}} hydraulic fan. Ducting is run in a front and rear assembly, each being fed by one leaf blower. The front ducting splits into two sections and terminate in 3 D printed nozzles designed for this project. Its purpose is to blow debris out from between the tracks. The rear <b>ducting</b> <b>assembly</b> splits and is routed off the sides of the cart to blow debris further away from the track. The entire project is then mounted in place to the maintenance cart. The assembly holding the leaf blowers in place is designed to be easily removable and the leaf blowers can both be removed for use by an individual.

40|$|The National Ignition Facility (NIF) {{will house}} a 2 MJ Nd:glass laser {{system to be}} used for a broad range of {{inertial}} confinement fusion experiments. This record high energy laser output will be initiated by a single low energy, fiber -based master oscillator which will be appropriately shaped in time and frequency prior to being split into 48 beams for intermediate amplification. These 48 intermediate energy beams will feed the 192 main amplifier chains. We report on the baseline design and test results for an amplifier subsystem in the intermediate amplifiers. The subsystem is based on a diode pumped, Nd:glass regenerative amplifier. The amplifier is comprised fo a linear, folded, TEM{sub 00 }, 4. 5 m long cavity and represents the highest gain (approximately 10 {sup 7 }) component in the NIF laser system. Two fundamentally important requirements for this amplifier include output energy of 20 mJ and square pulse distortion of less than 1. 45. With a single 48 bar 4. 5 kW peak power diode array and lens <b>duct</b> <b>assembly</b> we pump a 5 mm diameter X 50 mm long Nd-doped, phosphate glass rod, and amplify the mode matched, temporally shaped (approximately 20 ns in duration) oscillator seed pulse to 25 mJof output energy with a very acceptable square pulse distortion of 1. 44.

40|$|System {{level testing}} {{of the space shuttle}} orbiter's {{development}} flash evaporator system (FES) was performed in a thermal vacuum chamber capable of simulating ambient ascent, orbital, and entry temperature and pressure profiles. The test article included the evaporator assembly, high load and topping exhaust <b>duct</b> and nozzle <b>assemblies,</b> and feedwater supply assembly. Steady state and transient heat load, water pressure/temperature and ambient pressure/temperature profiles were imposed by especially designed supporting test hardware. Testing in 1978 verified evaporator and duct heater thermal design, determined FES performance boundaries, and assessed topping evaporator plume characteristics. Testing in 1979 combined the FES with the other systems in the orbiter active thermal control subsystem (ATCS). The FES met or exceeded all nominal and contingency performance requirements during operation with the integrated ATCS. During both tests stability problems were encountered during steady state operations which resulted in subsequent design changes to the water spray nozzle and valve plate assemblies...|$|R
40|$|Tight {{junctions}} (TJs) play a {{key role}} in mediating paracellular ion reabsorption in the kidney. The paracellular pathway in the collecting duct of the kidney is a predominant route for transepithelial chloride reabsorption that determines the extracellular NaCl content and the blood pressure. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the paracellular chloride reabsorption in the collecting duct are not understood. Here we showed that in mouse kidney collecting duct cells, claudin- 4 functioned as a Cl– channel. A positively charged lysine residue at position 65 of claudin- 4 was critical for its anion selectivity. Claudin- 4 was observed to interact with claudin- 8 using several criteria. In the collecting <b>duct</b> cells, the <b>assembly</b> of claudin- 4 into TJ strands required its interaction with claudin- 8. Depletion of claudin- 8 resulted in the loss of paracellular chloride conductance, through a mechanism involving its recruitment of claudin- 4 during TJ assembly. Together, our data show that claudin- 4 interacts with claudin- 8 and that their association is required for the anion-selective paracellular pathway in the collecting duct, suggesting a mechanism for coupling chloride reabsorption with sodium reabsorption in the collecting duct...|$|R
40|$|Advanced nuclear {{reactors}} offer safe, clean, and reliable energy {{at the global}} scale. The development of such devices relies heavily upon computational models, from the pre-conceptual stages through detailed design, licensing, and operation. An integrated reactor modeling framework that enables seamless communication, coupling, automation, and continuous development brings significant new capabilities and efficiencies {{to the practice of}} reactor design. In such a system, key performance metrics (e. g., optimal fuel management, peak cladding temperature in design-basis accidents, levelized cost of electricity) can be explicitly linked to design inputs (e. g., <b>assembly</b> <b>duct</b> thickness, tolerances), enabling an exceptional level of design consistency. Coupled with high-performance computing, thousands of integrated cases can be executed simultaneously to analyze the full system, perform complete sensitivity studies, and efficiently and robustly evaluate various design tradeoffs. TerraPower has developed such a tool—the Advanced Reactor Modeling Interface (ARMI) code system—and has deployed it to support the TerraPower Traveling Wave Reactor design and other innovative energy products currently under development. The ARMI code system employs pre-existing tools with strong pedigrees alongside many new physics and data management modules necessary for innovative design. Verification and validation against previous and new physical measurements, which remain an essential element of any sound design, are being carried out. This paper summarizes the integrated core engineering tools and practices in production at TerraPower...|$|R
5000|$|After the 1967 Trans-Am {{campaign}} with the 4-Bbl induction system producing more horsepower than the competing auto makers' 8-Bbl systems, for 1968 Chevrolet developed a factory 'cross-ram' aluminum intake-manifold package using two Holley [...] mechanical secondary carburetors for Trans-Am racing. It was available only as off-road service parts purchased over the Chevrolet dealership parts counter. With the Chevrolet '140 1st-design off-road cam, the package increased a stock 302's horsepower from [...] to approximately [...] Chevrolet {{went so far}} as to carry the positive crankcase ventilation (PCV) system over to the cross-ram induction system to retain emissions compliance mandated for US-produced cars beginning in 1967, that also provided full-throttle crankcase pressure venting to the intake air to burn its vapors. Engines prepared for competition use were capable of producing [...] with little more than the 8-Bbl induction, ported heads with higher pressure valvesprings, roller rocker arms, and the '754 2nd-design road-race cam. 1967/1968 models' cowl-induction system had an enclosed air-cleaner <b>assembly</b> <b>ducted</b> from its passenger side into the firewall cowl above the heater core. In 1969, factory Z/28's could be ordered with the ZL-1 aluminum-block 427 adaption of the 1967 L-88 427 Corvette cowl-induction 'ZL-2' hood available for both single and dual four-barrel induction systems that were sealed to the air cleaner base ensuring dense cooler, high-pressure, oxygen-laiden air from the center of the base of the windshield was supplied to the engine for combustion smoothness and maximum power production. Another popular service-parts-only component used on the 302 was the magnetic-pulse Delco transistor-ignition ball-bearing distributor. Introduced in 1963 on Pontiac's 389 and 421 drag racing engines, General Motors fitted it to the 1966? Z/28 before they used it on the L88 [...] Corvette. It eliminated the production breaker-point ignition allowing greater spark energy and more stable ignition timing at all engine speeds including idle. This was one of the least talked about yet most transformative and comprehensive performance and durability upgrades of its time. Many of the 302s off-road service parts were the development work of racers like Roger Penske. Every part in a SCCA Trans-Am engine had to be available through local Chevrolet parts departments to encourage their use by anyone who wanted them.|$|R
40|$|A 1 OOOMWth liquid-salt cooled thermal {{spectrum}} reactor was designed {{with a long}} fuel cycle, and high core exit temperature. These features are desirable in a reactor designed to provide process heat applications such as oil refinery needs of heat and electricity. The reactor uses the binary salt NaF-BeF₂ as the primary coolant, and uses U-Zr-H as fuel and to provide neutron moderation. Design options were studied under the constraints of maximum fuel temperature of 720 [degree]C, and a vessel wall temperature similar to today's reactors (i. e. limited to 430 [degree]C). The selected design achieves a core power density of 26. 35 kW/ 1 and can achieve a 10 year core lifetime before refueling. The core has a pressure drop of 1. 03 MPa, and uses a hexagonal lattice with small, 7 mm outer diameter fuel pins. The pins are arranged in a tight 1. 08 pitch-to-diameter ratio, and use wire wrap spacers and <b>assembly</b> <b>ducts</b> for mechanical support. Silicon carbide is used for cladding, and the fuel-clad gap is filled with a low-melting point liquid metal {{to act as a}} thermal bond between the fuel and the cladding. The core is encircled with two rows of reflector assemblies and one row of thermal shield assemblies. A layer of graphite provides thermal insulation to the reactor vessel. (cont.) The primary coolant is coupled to a CO₂ power cycle via heat exchangers located above the core in the same vessel. The reactor vessel is 8. 5 m in diameter and 15. 3 m tall, which achieves the goal of a vessel that can be produced off-site and transported via barge, but not by truck or train. The intermediate heat exchanger is designed with 1 cm outer diameter tubing with internal helical ribs. The tubes are arranged in a square array with a pitch to diameter ratio of 1. 2. With a core exit temperature of 570 [degree]C, the supercritical CO₂ power conversion system achieves, according to previous studies at MIT, a net efficiency of 45. 7 %. A comparison is made to other integral medium reactors (i. e those with the heat exchanger and the core in the same vessel). This reactor has the advantage of low pressure and high thermal conversion ratio compared to the IRIS water cooled reactor. by Joshua Whitman. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Closed-Brayton-cycle {{conversion}} {{technology has}} been identified as an excellent candidate for nuclear electric propulsion (NEP) power conversion systems. Advantages include high efficiency, long life, and high power density for power levels from about 10 kWe to 1 MWe, and beyond. An additional benefit for Brayton is the potential for the alternator to deliver very high voltage as required by the electric thrusters, minimizing the mass and power losses associated with the power management and distribution (PMAD). To accelerate Brayton technology development for NEP, the NASA Glenn Research Center is developing a low-power NEP power systems testbed that utilizes an existing 2 - kWe Brayton power conversion unit (PCU) from previous solar dynamic technology efforts. The PCU includes a turboalternator, a recuperator, and a gas cooler connected by gas <b>ducts.</b> The rotating <b>assembly</b> is supported by gas foil bearings and consists of a turbine, a compressor, a thrust rotor, and an alternator on a single shaft. The alternator produces alternating-current power that is rectified to 120 -V direct-current power by the PMAD unit. The NEP power systems testbed will be utilized to conduct future investigations of operational control methods, high-voltage PMAD, electric thruster interactions, and advanced heat rejection techniques. The PCU was tested in Glenn s Vacuum Facility 6. The Brayton PCU was modified from its original solar dynamic configuration by the removal of the heat receiver and retrofitting of the electrical resistance gas heater to simulate the thermal input of a steady-state nuclear source. Then, the Brayton PCU was installed in the 3 -m test port of Vacuum Facility 6, as shown. A series of tests were performed between June and August of 2002 that resulted in a total PCU operational time of about 24 hr. An initial test sequence on June 17 determined that the reconfigured unit was fully operational. Ensuing tests provided the operational data needed to characterize PCU performance over its full operating range. The primary test variables used in operating the Brayton PCU were heater input power and rotor speed. Testing demonstrated a maximum steady-state alternating-current power output of 1835 W at a gas heater power of 9000 W and a rotor speed of 52000 rpm. The corresponding measured turbine inlet gas temperature was 1076 K, and the compressor inlet gas temperature was 282 K. When insulation losses from the gas heater were neglected, the Brayton cycle efficiency for the maximum power point was calculated to be 24 percent. The net direct-current power output was 1750 W, indicating a PMAD efficiency of about 95 percent...|$|R
