6000|$|... "Monsieur de Tressan," [...] {{he called}} impressively, [...] "to your dying day--and {{that will be}} none so distant--shall you regret <b>it</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not hear me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll {{be in an}} odd {{position}} for speaking of <b>it</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> really go in. You deny that you've declined," [...] said Mrs. Brook; [...] "which means then that you've allowed our friend to hope." ...|$|E
60|$|MRS GILBEY. It's a {{much nicer}} name than Juggins. I think I'll call <b>you</b> by <b>it,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>dont</b> mind.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why {{not sign}} them? You can't really {{suppose that the}} {{property}} is your own. You could not even get <b>it</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> think so.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I know <b>it.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> {{not love}} me, {{you would not}} take all this trouble to try to crush me. But this {{conversation}} is very long; shall we {{put an end to}} it?" ...|$|R
60|$|Dom. I'm {{resolved}} to forswear <b>it,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> Let me advise you better, colonel, than to accuse a church-man to a church-man; {{in the common}} cause we are all of a piece; we hang together.|$|E
6000|$|... "Bad as can be," [...] {{returned}} Mat, gruffly. [...] "Don't you {{say another}} word to me about <b>it.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> we part company again. Talk of something else. Anything you like; and the sooner the better." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Don't {{agree to}} it, though, {{because you think}} I like <b>it,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not. Consider how you will get on with grandmamma and the children. She makes promises; but as to trusting her not to spoil Helen--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The world can't be hollow!" [...] {{he said to}} Margaret {{the next}} morning. [...] "It can't be filled with air, or nothing, and my ray would not {{illuminate}} air or nothing. I cannot understand <b>it.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not see what I see, I should think I was going crazy." ...|$|R
60|$|MARGARET. I {{think you}} had better leave us to fight <b>it</b> out, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>dont</b> mind.|$|R
50|$|One {{interesting}} little quirk to {{the game}} was that, {{it was possible to}} bomb your own ship as you took off from <b>it.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> this, when <b>you</b> returned it would no longer be there (having sunk, presumably) and being unable to land on it your plane would just continue flying until it ran out of fuel and crashed.|$|R
6000|$|... "If it will comfort {{you to say}} so, you may say <b>it.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not {{perceive}} that the mistake made between us has been as much your mistake as mine, and has injured me more than it has injured you, I will not remind you of it,--will never remind you of it after this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wouldn't leave a {{word out}} of it. You'll spoil <b>it</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> for the {{interest}} of the story is more in the minds than in the actions of the people, and it will be all a muddle if you don't explain as you go on," [...] said Meg, who firmly believed that this book was the most remarkable novel ever written.|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{will never}} do, will never do," [...] she said. [...] "Get {{angry with him}} if you choose, but don't show <b>it.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> that, you may crash him too low or bounce him too high, and, in either case, he may be off before you know it. It is {{too early in the}} game to show him that he has made you angry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{very kind}} of you to say that, and to feel it; and I know that you would not say <b>it</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not feel it," [...] replied Theodora. [...] "But still, I think it would be better that we should come to see you at a time when you are less engaged; perhaps you will take Colonel Campian down some day and give him some shooting." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's not {{the sort}} of thing to tell 'em," [...] remarked Henry, as, with his napkin over his arm, he leant against one of the pillars of the verandah, and sipped the glass of Burgundy I had poured out for him; [...] "and they wouldn't believe <b>it</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> tell 'em, not one of 'em. But it's the truth, for all that. Without the clothes they couldn't do it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Cer'nly not. 'Cause why? Firstly, you couldn't say {{it at all}} till you'd learned Arabic," [...] {{returned}} Molloy; [...] "secondly--if I may {{be allowed}} for to follow suit an' sermonise--'cause <b>you</b> shouldn't say <b>it</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> could; an', thirdly, 'cause you'd be a most awful Jack-ass to say <b>it</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> Now, <b>it's</b> my advice, boys, that we go to sleep, for we won't have an easy day of <b>it</b> to-morrow, <b>if</b> I may judge from to-day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Wallace, [...] "because I don't {{take him}} for any {{advantage}} to myself, {{but only to}} prevent your allowing him to make trouble. If you make noise and disturbance with him, it is your fault, and you lose the squirrel as the penalty for <b>it.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> your duty and make no trouble with him, then {{he would not be}} forfeited." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How can you tell? How can you {{prevent its}} coming to that, except by loving {{the man you}} do marry? You don't care two straws for Mr. Gilmore; and I cannot {{understand}} how {{you can have the}} courage to think of becoming his wife. Let us go home. You have asked my advice, and you've got <b>it.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not take it, I will endeavour to forget that I gave it you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} know who did <b>it.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> beg him to tell, Dan. It's so hard to have 'em all hate me for nothing. I don't think I can bear it much longer. If I had any place to go to, I'd run away, though I love Plumfield dearly; but I'm not brave and big like you, so I must stay and wait till some one shows them that I haven't lied." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I'm {{not saying}} go out an' <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> strap <b>it</b> up before you smack it up." [...] (Missy Elliott) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Please freight it with {{a couple}} of thousand-dollar bills and let <b>it</b> go. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> I wont never annoy <b>you</b> no more. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>dont</b> <b>you</b> will be sorry.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't be afraid," [...] {{the letter}} said, [...] "It will <b>do</b> <b>you</b> no harm. Resist it when <b>it</b> comes. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> <b>you</b> {{will get the}} better of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{it seems}} he can believe {{anything}} of me. I shall begin to think soon that I did take them, myself,--or, at any rate, that I ought to have done so. I wonder what you three women think of <b>it.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> think I've got 'em, don't scruple to say so. I'm quite used to it, and it won't hurt me any further." [...] The ladies again laughed. [...] "You must have your suspicions," [...] continued he.|$|E
6000|$|... “Because I want you, {{when you}} {{grow up to be a}} man, to be bound by your {{agreements}}. Men will hold you to your agreements when you are a man, and I want you to be accustomed to it while you are a boy. I should rather give up twice as much land as your garden, than take yours away from you now; but I must do <b>it</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not get it in good order before the time is out.” ...|$|E
6000|$|Torrance checked {{him with}} a lifted hand. [...] "That is not what I mean. It is {{fortunate}} {{for most of us}} that women of her kind believe the best of us and can forgive a good deal. I am not speaking generally: do you know any special reason--one that may make trouble for both of you? It's a plain question, and you understand <b>it.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> we'll go into the thing right now, and then, if it can be got over, never mention it again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will not}} touch your key or your money, sir. Pray don't {{ask me to}} <b>do</b> <b>it</b> again. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> I must go and call your brother." ...|$|R
30|$|<b>It</b> is fine <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> {{not want}} to go.|$|R
6000|$|... “Yes,” said Nettie, {{glancing at}} Tony. “It hurts me, but <b>it’s</b> necessary. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not believe me ask {{the man who}} sent his friend to meet the man he dared not face.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay!" [...] he {{interrupted}} energetically, [...] "I will distress myself on your account, my Margot. Listen, dear, I have not spoken {{of these things}} to you before; something always seemed to stop me when I wished to question you. But, somehow, I feel as if I could not go away and leave you now without asking you one question. [...] . You need not answer <b>it</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not wish," [...] he added, as he noted a sudden hard look, almost of apprehension, darting through her eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Observe, Sir, {{what will}} be the event of your {{discarding}} these poor men, all of them diserving better treatment from you: they will come to Paris begging all their way, and show the whole town, English, French, and strangers, an example of your Cruelty, their Religion being all their offence; do you think, Sir, your Protestants will believe you the better protestant for <b>it?</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> I am affraid you will find yourself mistaken; it will be a handle for your enemies to represent you a hippocrite in your religion and Cruel in your nature, and show the world what those who serve you are to expect.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh no," [...] said North, concernedly, [...] "we {{were never}} {{as bad as}} that. We did have a variety troupe up from the city three or four nights, but they weren't stars by as far as light can travel in the same length of time. I always like a few home comforts even when I'm {{roughing}} it. But don't tell me you prefer {{to stay in the}} city during summer. I don't believe <b>it.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> why did you spend your summers there for the last four years, even sneaking away from town on a night train, and refusing to tell your friends where this Arcadian village was?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{something}} {{that there can be}} no mistake about, that is all, a speaking message from yourself. But don't give <b>it</b> me <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not like; perhaps you had rather not!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It does. I wouldn't need {{to suffer}} <b>it</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were <b>doing</b> {{business}} in Cripple. I can't leave go your Johnny-cake and pie; 'tis {{the kind that}} mother didn't make--for she was Irish." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do wish it," [...] she said, [...] "and {{everyone}} will be {{so happy to see}} you. They would think <b>it</b> strange <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not come, for {{everyone will}} know by then that you have returned." ...|$|R
