On April 19, 2008, {{he participated in}} a match to crown the inaugural NWE Cruiserweight Champion, losing to Juventud Guerrera in a match that also included Matt Cross and Pac. The following day Super Nova defeated Pac. By mid-2008, Super Nova left CMLL to work with NWE and {{to work on the}} Mexican independent circuit. He toured with NWE throughout 2008, at one point teaming with Último Dragón to defeat Dark Dragon and Spade-O. In late 2008 Super Nova began working for the newly formed Perros del Mal Producciones wrestling promotion, teaming with Black Spirit and Turbo on Los Perros' debut show to defeat Black Thunder, Cerebro Negro and X-Fly. Throughout 2009 Super Nova made regular appearances for both NWE and Perros del Mal Producciones. On November 13, 2011, Super Nova won a six-way elimination match to become the new Perros <b>del</b> Mal <b>Light</b> Heavyweight Champion. When Super Nova's brother, El Texano, Jr., jumped from CMLL to Perros del Mal Producciones in November 2011, both of the brothers joined Los Perros del Mal at an International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG) event on December 8. However, this partnership was soon forgotten as El Texano, Jr. went on to form a new stable named El Consejo. On March 10, El Texano, Jr. helped Super Nova retain the Perros <b>del</b> Mal <b>Light</b> Heavyweight Championship against Daga and afterward invited him to join El Consejo. Super Nova, however, refused the offer, saying he did not need anyone's help.

40|$|Accurate {{perception}} of position and self-movement {{is a critical}} factor for many tasks in aviation; particularly low-level flight, take off and landing. An especially demanding task of this kind is that of deck landings for rotary-wing aircraft, which are often conducted during the night. During night operations, ship-based lighting is used to assist the aircrew and flight-deck staff {{in the conduct of}} take-off and landing. While reasonably effective, the lighting systems currently employed by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) were not designed specifically with the aim of enhancing aircrew visual perception. In two experiments a deck-edge <b>light</b> (<b>DEL)</b> system which provides a richer visual cueing environment for the aircrew than traditional point-source lighting systems was investigated in terms of its potential benefits for aircrew visual perception. These experiments could reveal no clear performance advantage for DELs over standard point-source lights. In both experiments, participants were asked to make ratings of their confidence in their judgments. Only a very weak relationship was found between accuracy and confidence, suggesting that care should be exercised when subjective ratings are interpreted in place of performance data. Further investigation is required {{in order to understand the}} potential of DEL systems for enhancing the safety of night operations. RELEASE LIMITATION Approved for public releas...|$|R
5000|$|Going against {{previous}} stereotype, Mayo {{accepted the}} supporting role of unsympathetic, gold-digger Marie Derry in William Wyler's drama The Best Years of Our Lives (1946). Her performance drew favorable reviews from critics, {{as the film}} also became the highest-grossing film inside the US since Gone with the Wind. At the zenith of her career, Mayo {{was seen as the}} quintessential voluptuous Hollywood beauty. It was said that she [...] "looked like a pinup painting come to life". According to widely published reports from the late 1940s, the Sultan of Morocco declared her beauty to be [...] "tangible proof of the existence of God." [...] She would continue a series of dramatic performances in the late 1940s in films such as Smart Girls Don't Talk (1948). Virginia Mayo was a constant fixture in the movie theaters in 1949 as she co-starred in many movies all released that year. Among them were Flaxy Martin, opposite Joel McCrea in the western Colorado Territory, co-starred with future United States President Ronald Reagan in The Girl from Jones Beach, and with comedian Milton Berle in Always Leave Them Laughing. Mixing drama with comedy roles all year, Mayo received rave reviews for her performance alongside James Cagney and Edmond O'Brien in 1949's White Heat and received equally impressive reviews for co-starring with George Raft in Roy <b>Del</b> Ruth's Red <b>Light</b> that same year. In a later interview, Mayo admitted she was frightened by Cagney as the psychotic gunman in White Heat because he was so realistic.|$|R
40|$|Misfolding and {{degradation}} of CFTR {{is the cause}} of disease in patients with the most prevalent CFTR mutation, an in-frame deletion of phenylalanine (F 508 del), located in the first nucleotide-binding domain of human CFTR (hNBD 1). Studies of (F 508 del) CFTR cellular folding suggest that both intra- and inter-domain folding is impaired. (F 508 del) CFTR is a temperature-sensitive mutant, that is, lowering growth temperature, improves both export, and plasma membrane residence times. Yet, paradoxically, F 508 del does not alter the fold of isolated hNBD 1 nor did it seem to perturb its unfolding transition in previous isothermal chemical denaturation studies. We therefore studied the in vitro thermal unfolding of matched hNBD 1 constructs ±F 508 <b>del</b> to shed <b>light</b> on the defective folding mechanism and the basis for the thermal instability of (F 508 del) CFTR. Using primarily differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and circular dichroism, we show for all hNBD 1 pairs studied, that F 508 del lowers the unfolding transition temperature (Tm) by 6 – 7 °C and that unfolding occurs via a kinetically-controlled, irreversible transition in isolated monomers. A thermal unfolding mechanism is derived from nonlinear least squares fitting of comprehensive DSC data sets. All data are consistent with a simple three-state thermal unfolding mechanism for hNBD 1 ± F 508 del: N(±MgATP) ⇄ IT(±MgATP) → AT → (AT) n. The equilibrium unfolding to intermediate, IT, is followed by the rate-determining, irreversible formation of a partially folded, aggregation-prone, monomeric state, AT, for which aggregation to (AT) n and further unfolding occur with no detectable heat change. Fitted parameters indicate that F 508 del thermodynamically destabilizes the native state, N, and accelerates the formation of AT...|$|R

His first major appearance for IWRG, came on March 4, 2011 at IWRG's annual Guerrea del Golfo event, Golden Magic, Eterno and Freelance lost to the team of Carta Brava Jr., El Pollo Asesino and El Fresero Jr. A month later he wrestled on IWRG's annual Guerra Revolucionaria show, teaming with fellow rookies Black Sky and Dinamic Black as they lost to the team of Oficial Fierro, Hammer and Magnifico, two falls to one. He also branched out and worked for other Mexican promotions, such as Los Perros del Mal, working that promotion's third anniversary show on May 29, 2011 where he, El Angel, Hagen and Skayde lost to Ek Balam, Guerrero Negro and La Ola Maldita (Maldito Jr. and Samoth). His first real success as Golden Magic came {{when he won the}} 15th Torneo FILL (short for Futuro Idolos de Lucha Libre, [...] "Future Idols of Wrestling", IWRG's wrestling school) by defeating wrestlers such as Alan Extreme, Centvrión, Dinamic Black and Eterno. Golden Magic followed this up by also winning the 17th Torneo FILL outlasting 15 other wrestlers including Kortiz and Taurus. On September 8, 2011 Golden Magic was one of eight participants in a tournament for the vacant IWRG Intercontinental Welterweight Championship. He defeated Trauma II in the first round, Apolo Estrada Jr. in the second round and finally Bestia 666 to become the new Welterweight Champion, marking the first championship victory of his wrestling career. GOlden Magic teamed up with other IWRG mid-card tecnicos like Dinamic Black, Veneno, El Pantera and El Hijo del Pantera to form a group called Los Revolucionarios ("The Revolutionaries). Golden Magic, Veneno and Dinamic Black represented Los Revolucionarios in a one night Trios tournament, defeatingLas Ladies de Naucalpan (Bugambilia del Norte, La Diva Salvaje and Miss Gaviota) but lost to Los Oficiales (Oficial 911, Oficial AK-47 & Oficial Spartan) in the finals of the tournament. He had his first successful Welterweight title defense on September 29, 2011 when he defeated Carta Brava Jr. at Arena Naucalpan The following month he also made a successful title defense against Bestia 666. On November 3, 2011 Golden Magic was one of 10 men to put his mask on the line in the 2011 El Castillo del Terror ("Castle of Terror") event along with King Drako, Carta Brava Jr., El Hijo de L.A. Park, El Hijo de Máscara Año 2000, Machin, Oficial 911, Oficial Spartan, Super Nova and Zumbi. The match came down to Golden Magic and King Drako as everyone else had escaped the cage, when Golden Magic left as well King Drako was forced to unmask and Golden Magic was given credit with the Lucha de Apuesta, or [...] "bet match", victory. A few weeks later he challenged for the Perros <b>del</b> Mal <b>Light</b> Heavyweight Championship, in a match that saw Super Nova take the victory over Bestia 666. On December 22, 2011, at IWRG's Arena Naucalpan 34th Anniversary Show Golden Magic lost the IWRG Intercontinental Welterweight Championship to Eterno in a match where Eterno's WWS Welterweight Championship was also on the line.|$|R

Wanting {{to start from}} scratch, {{he came up with}} the {{character}} of Leo, a masked técnico (fan favorite) dancer and one half of the tag team Los Strippers with Riveiro. The tag team achieved only limited success, often working opening matches at events. On June 6, 2010, Carrera took part in Perros del Mal's storyline invasion of Mexico's biggest promotion, AAA. For the appearance he was repackaged as Bestia 666 with a character and face paint inspired by Damián 666, in the process revealing the relation between the two. Under his new character, Bestia 666 was quickly accepted into the rudo (villainous) stable Los Perros del Mal, which also included the likes of Damián 666, Halloween, L.A. Park, X-Fly and the group's leader, El Hijo del Perro Aguayo. With his tag team with Riveiro behind him, Bestia 666 began regularly teaming with X-Fly and on September 4 the two entered a tournament to determine the first ever Independent Wrestling League (IWL) Tag Team Champions. On November 28, Bestia 666 and X-Fly defeated Las Hermanos Trauma (Trauma I and Trauma II) in a tournament final to become the first IWL Tag Team Champions. A week later Perros del Mal Producciones crowned their first ever champion, the Perros del Mal Extremo Champion; the nine-way match, which also included Bestia 666, was won by his tag team partner and best friend X-Fly. On January 15, 2011, Bestia 666 made his wrestling debut for AAA, teaming with Damián 666 and Halloween as a member of both Los Perros del Mal and La Sociedad, in a six-man tag team match, where they were defeated by Los Psycho Circus (Monster Clown, Murder Clown and Psycho Clown). Bestia 666 also represented Los Perros del Mal in International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG), where he, Damián 666 and X-Fly unsuccessfully challenged for the IWRG Intercontinental Trios Championship on four separate occasions between January and July. On July 24, Perros del Mal Producciones crowned their first ever Light Heavyweight Champion in a six-way match, where Bestia 666 ended up defeating Black Fire, Peligro, Pesadilla, Tony Rivera and Zumbi to win the title. During IWRG's La Jaula de la Muerte ("The Cage of Death") show on August 28, Bestia 666, Damián 666 and X-Fly defeated Los Psycho Circus, Los Temerarios (Black Terry, Durok and Machin) and Los Villanos (Kortiz, Ray Mendoza Jr. and Villano IV) in a steel cage match to win the IWRG Intercontinental Trios Championship. On October 5, IWL announced that since Bestia 666 and X-Fly had defended the IWL Tag Team Championship without the promotion's authorization, they would no longer recognize the title, which would be replaced by the new IWL International Tag Team Championship. Later that month, Bestia was invited for a tryout with WWE, during the promotion's tour of Mexico. Bestia appeared on the October 21 edition of WWE SmackDown as one of Cody Rhodes' [...] "baggers", taking an RKO from Randy Orton. On November 13, Bestia 666 lost the Perros <b>del</b> Mal <b>Light</b> Heavyweight Championship to Super Nova in a six-way elimination match, which also included Eterno, Diva Salvaje, Golden Magic and Tony Rivera. On December 1, Bestia, Damián and X-Fly lost the IWRG Intercontinental Trios Championship to Los Capos Jr. (Cien Caras Jr., El Hijo de Máscara Año 2000 and Máscara Año 2000 Jr.).
