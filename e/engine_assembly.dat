Unveiled by Her Majesty, the plant produces 2.0-litre 4-cylinder Ingenium diesel and petrol engines. Having already been expanded once before, in 2015 {{it was announced}} that the factory would be doubling in size to 200,000 sq m (2,152,782 sq ft), costing $450 million. This expansion would see the workforce double from 700 to 1,400.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the high quality of his steam engines, sales {{increased}} a great deal and it became apparent that a new <b>engine</b> <b>assembly</b> shop was required. Murray designed this himself, and produced a huge three-storeyed circular building known as the Round Foundry. This contained a centrally mounted steam engine to power all of the machines in the building. Murray also built a house for himself adjoining the works. The design of this was pioneering, as each room was heated by steam pipes, so that it became known locally as Steam Hall.|$|E

25|$|Production {{of these}} engines {{originally}} {{took place at}} Rover's satellite factory (and ex-Bristol Hercules engine plant) at Acocks Green in Birmingham whilst vehicle assembly {{took place at the}} main Rover works at Solihull. After Land Rover was created as a distinct division with British Leyland in 1979 production of Rover cars at Solihull ceased in 1982. A new <b>engine</b> <b>assembly</b> line was built in the space vacated by the car lines and engine production started at Solihull in 1983. The engine line at Solihull closed in 2007 when Land Rover began using Ford and Jaguar engines built at Dagenham (diesel engines) and Bridgend (petrol engines).|$|E
25|$|The AEW.7 version {{would have}} seen the ventral radome {{containing}} the AN/APS-20 radar removed and replaced with a dorsal rotating dome or 'rotodome', similar to that used on the US Grumman E-2 Hawkeye, carrying a newly developed FMICW radar system. To accommodate a new installation {{of the size of the}} rotodome, together with its position right at the rear of the aircraft, the intention was to rebuild the rear fuselage with the single tailfin being substituted by a twin tail arrangement, as well as the wingspan being increased to 60ft (18.3m). The rotodome was designed to be moveable on its installation, able to tip backwards to allow the radar beam to operate clear of interference from the Gannet's propellers, negating the need to replace the Double Mamba with a turbofan <b>engine</b> <b>assembly.</b> In the end, this proposal was not proceeded with.|$|E

2500|$|All VAM engines were of AMC design, but {{built in}} at the Lerma, Estado de México <b>engine</b> <b>assembly</b> plant.

The V8 and four cylinder engines were not available in Mexico.|$|E
2500|$|The {{cause of}} the {{explosion}} was revealed to be a catastrophic failure of the engine's third stage turbine disk, resulting from a loss of operating clearance between the disk and the third stage inner sealing ring. Improper positioning of the turbine rotor, use of the wrong type of tool and worn parts included in the <b>engine</b> <b>assembly</b> process were blamed for that loss of clearance. The CAB accident report states that the inspector on duty during the reinstallation of the turbine rotor [...] "signed off on work he had not inspected".|$|E

50|$|Design {{engineers}} {{have found the}} combination of electroless nickel’s functional properties to be very appealing for aerospace use. Due to the obvious reliability issues associated with this market segment, a long term, thorough evaluation of electroless nickel has been on going and had made for slow progress. Successful testing and application {{for a number of}} years resulted in a better understanding of when and how to specify electroless nickel. It is widely used in <b>engine</b> <b>assemblies,</b> servo valves, landing gear, turbine blades and the like. Unlike hard chrome, compressive stressed high phosphorus deposits do not significantly reduce the fatigue strength of these critical components. For this reason and reasons stated above, its continued application appears secure.|$|R
