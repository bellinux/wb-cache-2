40|$|Transparent and {{electrically}} conductive composite silica films were fabricated on glass and hydrophilic SiOx/silicon substrates by incorporation of individual graphene oxide sheets into silica sols followed by spin-coating, chemical reduction, and thermal curing. The resulting films {{were characterized by}} SEM, AFM, TEM, low-angle X-ray reflectivity, XPS, UV−vis spectroscopy, and electrical conductivity measurements. The electrical conductivity of the films compared favorably to those of composite thin films of carbon nanotubes in silica. <b>Electrically</b> <b>conductive</b> <b>glass</b> is used in {{a broad range of}} applications such as in solar reflecting windshields, 1 self-cleaning windows, 2 electrostatic charge-dissipating coat-ings, 3, 4 solar cells, 5, 6 and sensor devices. 7, 8 Typically, to render it conductive, a substrate is coated with carbon or metal oxide films such as indium tin oxide (ITO) or aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO). 2, 7, 9 - 24 However, the conventional fabrication processes for coating these carbon or metal oxide films such as magnetron sputtering deposi-tion, 11 - 18 cathodic arc plasma deposition, 19, 20 chemical vapo...|$|E
40|$|Tin oxide (SnO~) thick {{films have}} been {{prepared}} on glass urfaces from organometallic tin resinate solutions, and their photoelectrochemical properties have been studied. The antimony-doped tin oxide film showed similar photo-electrochemical properties {{to those of the}} n-SnO 2 single crystal electrode. No anodic dark current was observed for the electrolysis of water up to the bias potential of 2. 0 V vs. SCE and saturation currents were observed upon illumination. These and other results indicate that SnO ~ films prepared from the resinate show purer semiconducting properties with less degenerate nergy levels than those prepared from aqueous SnC 14. Possible reasons are discussed from experimental observations. Tin oxide films on glass have been used widely as an <b>electrically</b> <b>conductive</b> <b>glass.</b> Some of the methods used for producing SnO 2 films on glass include oxida-tion of deposited tin on glass, precipitation of tin hy-droxides w i th ammonium hydroxide followed by washing, drying, and heating, chemical vapor deposi-tion of SnC 14 onto heated substrates, and d-c glow dis...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Doctoral) [...] İzmir Institute of Technology, Mechanical Engineering, İzmir, 2008 Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves: 174 - 185) Text in English; Abstract: Turkish and Englishxx, 185 leavesThis study {{focuses on}} development and characterization of thermosetting resin based nanocomposites containing multi and double walled carbon nanotubes {{with and without}} amine functional groups (MWCNT, DWCNTs, MWCNT-NH 2 and DWCNTNH 2). A novel 3 -roll milling technique was conducted to prepare the resin suspensions with carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Rheological measurements performed on the resin suspensions showed that addition of very low contents (0. 05, 0. 1 and 0. 3 wt. %) of MWCNTs and MWCNT-NH 2 affected the flow characteristic of the resin, significantly. Further, the curing behavior of a vinylester-polyester hybrid resin suspensions containing 0. 3 wt % of MWCNTs and MWCNT-NH 2 was intensively studied. It was found that regardless of amine groups, presence of CNTs affected the polymerization of the hybrid matrix resin. Final individual fractional conversion rates of styrene and vinylester monomers {{were found to be}} vastly dependent on the type of CNTs. Glass transition temperature (Tg) values of the nanocomposites with MWCNTs and MWCNTNH 2 were found to increase with filler content. Moreover, nanocomposites containing MWCNTs and MWCNT-NH 2 were found to possess higher tensile strength, elastic modulus as well as fracture toughness and fracture energy as compared to the neat hybrid resin. On the other hand, electrical properties of the nanocomposites were also investigated and it was found that nanocomposites with MWCNTs exhibited the lowest percolation threshold value. In addition, nanocomposites with amino functionalized CNTs were found to exhibit lower electrical conductivity as compared to those with untreated CNTs. Nanocomposites with AC electric field induced aligned CNTs were also prepared. Finally, based on the findings obtained for CNT/ resin suspensions, as a case study, <b>electrically</b> <b>conductive</b> <b>glass</b> fiber reinforced composite laminates were successfully produced, using the CNT modified resin suspensions as matrix material, via Vacuum Assisted Resin Transfer Molding (VARTM) and Resin Transfer Molding (RTM) methods...|$|E
