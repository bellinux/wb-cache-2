2500|$|An Australian {{workplace}} agreement (AWA) was {{a type of}} formalised <b>individual</b> <b>agreement</b> negotiated {{between an}} employer and employee in Australia that existed for a short number {{of years in the}} 2000s. Employers could offer a [...] "take it or leave it" [...] AWA as a condition of employment. They were registered by the Employment Advocate and did not require a dispute resolution procedure. These agreements operated only at the federal level. AWAs were individual written agreements on terms and conditions of employment between an employer and employee in Australia, under the Workplace Relations Act 1996. An AWA could override employment conditions in state or territory laws except those relating to occupational health and safety, workers’ compensation, or training arrangements. An AWA was required to meet only the most minimal Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard. Agreements were not required to include effective dispute resolution procedures, and could not include prohibited content. Agreements were for a maximum of five years; approved, promoted and registered by the Workplace Authority; operated to the exclusion of any award; and prohibited industrial action regarding details in the agreement {{for the life of the}} agreement. The introduction of AWAs was a very controversial industrial relations issue in Australia.|$|E

40|$|International studies almost uniformly {{conclude}} that union members receive higher wages than their non-union counterparts. This study investigates differences between collective and individual salaries using the New Zealand State Services Commission's Human Resources Capability Survey 2005. It explores {{the impact of}} collective bargaining on pay by controlling for {{a large number of}} employee and employer characteristics. As very little research has been carried out on the subject in New Zealand, I focused on the international literature in order to identify the major factors that explain the magnitude of union/non-union wage differential. Major industrial changes, which have shaped the NZ public service bargaining structure and its outcomes are identified. A range of statistical tests are used to examine the pay differences between collective and <b>individual</b> <b>agreements</b> in New Zealand public service. I, first, carry out basic comparisons of the average collective and individual wages across gender, employment type, occupations, ethnicity, age, employer size and tenure, followed by numerous multivariate regressions to work out the true contributing factors to the union/non-union wage differential. Finally, I analyze the results in the unique NZ context to allow new ideas and theory to emerge and compare it to international trends. Looking at the basic comparisons, I found that, in the New Zealand public service, employees on <b>individual</b> <b>agreements</b> earn significantly higher wages then those who are covered by collective agreements. However, multivariate analyses have revealed a different picture. The study found that occupational composition is the largest contributor to the variability in collective/individual pay in NZPS. With the exception of the senior, high skilled and specialised employees, no pay differential was found between collective or <b>individual</b> <b>agreements</b> in the New Zealand public service...|$|R
50|$|As {{there is}} no legal source for {{abortion}}s, abortion practitioners ask {{for as much as}} they think a woman can pay.

Women who are poor go to a worse clinic with an inexperienced operator. The doctors make an <b>individual</b> <b>agreement</b> with each woman.

40|$|Australia, {{in common}} with many other industrialised {{countries}} in the 1990 s, has experienced a shift towards individualism in labour law and labour market regulation. This {{has been part of}} a wider change as governments have opened up domestic markets to international competition, while rethinking the protections provided by the welfare state. Business has demanded deregulation of all kinds but particularly in the labour market, with the aim of achieving greater flexibility and efficiency in the utilisation of labour. The debate over the reform of industrial relations institutions and processes in Australia has been conducted in terms of ‘enterprise bargaining’, a diffuse term which means (depending on the position of the speaker) either collective bargaining involving national unions but with outcomes tailored to specific workplaces, or firm-specific bargaining by internal enterprise-based parties with minimal involvement from ‘external’ bodies such as unions. During the last decade the debate has moved from an assumption of collective bargaining with union involvement, to the view that agreements should be primarily individual in nature. Legislation has mirrored this debate, with increasing emphasis being given to <b>individual</b> <b>agreements.</b> Hence the legal relationship between collective and <b>individual</b> <b>agreements</b> is of major importance in contemporary Australian labour law...|$|R
