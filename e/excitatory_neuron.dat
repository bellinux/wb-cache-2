5|$|The {{brain is}} {{composed}} {{of a network of}} neurons that transmit signals by propagating nerve impulses. The propagation of this impulse from one neuron to another is typically controlled by neurotransmitters, though there are also electrical pathways between some neurons. Neurotransmitters can inhibit impulse firing (primarily done by γ-aminobutyric acid, or GABA) or they can excite the neuron into firing (primarily done by glutamate). A neuron that releases inhibitory neurotransmitters from its terminals is called an inhibitory neuron, while one that releases excitatory neurotransmitters is an <b>excitatory</b> <b>neuron.</b> When the normal balance between inhibition and excitation is significantly disrupted in {{all or part of the}} brain, a seizure can occur. The GABA system is an important target for anticonvulsant drugs, since seizures may be discouraged by increasing GABA synthesis, decreasing its breakdown, or enhancing its effect on neurons.|$|E
5|$|The {{property}} that makes neurons unique is {{their ability to}} send signals to specific target cells over long distances. They send these signals {{by means of an}} axon, which is a thin protoplasmic fiber that extends from the cell body and projects, usually with numerous branches, to other areas, sometimes nearby, sometimes in distant parts of the brain or body. The length of an axon can be extraordinary: for example, if a pyramidal cell, (an <b>excitatory</b> <b>neuron)</b> of the cerebral cortex were magnified so that its cell body became the size of a human body, its axon, equally magnified, would become a cable a few centimeters in diameter, extending more than a kilometer. These axons transmit signals in the form of electrochemical pulses called action potentials, which last less than a thousandth of a second and travel along the axon at speeds of 1–100 meters per second. Some neurons emit action potentials constantly, at rates of 10–100 per second, usually in irregular patterns; other neurons are quiet most of the time, but occasionally emit a burst of action potentials.|$|E

However, the precise functional significance of this well-established orderly neuronal migration remains largely unclear. Here, {{we show that}} strong electrical synapses selectively form between RGPs and their newborn progeny and between sister <b>excitatory</b> <b>neurons</b> in ontogenetic radial clones at the embryonic stage. Interestingly, the preferential electrical coupling between sister <b>excitatory</b> <b>neurons,</b> but not that between RGP and newborn progeny, is eliminated in mice lacking REELIN or upon clonal depletion of DISABLED- 1, which compromises the inside-out radial neuronal migration pattern in the developing neocortex. Moreover, increased levels of Ephrin-A ligand or receptor that laterally disperse sister <b>excitatory</b> <b>neurons</b> also disrupt preferential electrical coupling between radially aligned sister <b>excitatory</b> <b>neurons.</b> These results suggest that RGP-guided inside-out radial neuronal migration facilitates the initial assembly of lineage-dependent precise columnar microcircuits in the neocortex...|$|R

50|$|The {{firing of}} an action potential, and {{consequently}} the release of neurotransmitters, occurs by this gating mechanism. In synaptic gating, in order for an action potential to occur, there must {{be more than one}} input to produce a single output in the neuron being gated. The interaction between these sets of neurons creates a biological AND gate. The neuron being gated is bistable and must be brought to the up state before it can fire an action potential. When this bistable neuron is in the up state, the gate is open. A gatekeeper neuron is responsible for stimulating the bistable neuron by shifting it from a down state to an up state and thus, opening the gate. Once the gate is open, an <b>excitatory</b> <b>neuron</b> can cause the bistable neuron to further depolarize and reach threshold causing and action potential to occur. If the gatekeeper does not shift the bistable neuron from down to up, the <b>excitatory</b> <b>neuron</b> {{will not be able to}} fire an action potential in the bistable neuron. Both the gatekeeper neuron and <b>excitatory</b> <b>neuron</b> are necessary to fire an action potential in the bistable neuron, but neither is sufficient to do so alone.|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe {{nervous system}} adapts to {{experience}} by inducing a transcriptional program that controls {{important aspects of}} synaptic plasticity. Although the molecular mechanisms of experience-dependent plasticity are well characterized in <b>excitatory</b> <b>neurons,</b> the mechanisms that regulate this process in inhibitory neurons are only poorly understood. Here, we describe a transcriptional program that is induced by neuronal activity in inhibitory neurons. We find that, while neuronal activity induces expression of early-response transcription factors such as Npas 4 in both <b>excitatory</b> and inhibitory <b>neurons,</b> Npas 4 activates distinct programs of late-response genes in inhibitory and <b>excitatory</b> <b>neurons.</b> These late-response genes differentially regulate synaptic input to {{these two types of}} neurons, promoting inhibition onto <b>excitatory</b> <b>neurons</b> while inducing excitation onto inhibitory neurons. These findings suggest that the functional outcomes of activity-induced transcriptional responses are adapted in a cell-type-specific manner to achieve a circuit-wide homeostatic response...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{work has}} shown that {{networks}} of neurons with two coupled layers of <b>excitatory</b> and inhibitory <b>neurons</b> can reveal oscillatory activity. For example, Borgers and Kopell (2003) have shown that oscillations occur when the <b>excitatory</b> <b>neurons</b> receive a sufficiently large input. A constant drive to the <b>excitatory</b> <b>neurons</b> is sufficient for oscillatory activity. Other studies (Doiron, Chacron, Maler, Longtin, & Bastian, 2003; Doiron, Lindner, Longtin, Maler, & Bastian, 2004) have shown that networks of neurons with two coupled layers of <b>excitatory</b> and inhibitory <b>neurons</b> reveal oscillatory activity only if the <b>excitatory</b> <b>neurons</b> receive correlated input, regardless {{of the amount of}} excitatory input. In this study, we show that these apparently contradictory results {{can be explained by the}} behavior of a single model operating in different regimes of parameter space. Moreover, we show that adding dynamic synapses in the inhibitory feedback loop provides a robust network behavior over a broad range of stimulus intensities, contrary to that of previous models. A remarkable property of the introduction of dynamic synapses is that the activity of the network reveals synchronized oscillatory components in the case of correlated input, but also reflects the temporal behavior of the input signal to the <b>excitatory</b> <b>neurons.</b> This allows the network to encode both the temporal characteristics of the input and the presence of spatial correlations in the input simultaneously...|$|R

In epilepsy the resistance of excitatory neurons to fire during this period is decreased. This may occur due to changes in ion channels or inhibitory neurons not functioning properly. This then results in a specific area from which seizures may develop, known as a [...] "seizure focus". Following an injury to the brain, another mechanism of epilepsy may be the up regulation of excitatory circuits or down regulation of inhibitory circuits. These secondary epilepsies occur through processes known as epileptogenesis. Failure of the blood-brain barrier may also be a causal mechanism.|$|E

40|$|SummaryHomeostatic {{regulation}} {{has been}} shown to restore cortical activity in vivo following sensory deprivation, but it is unclear whether this recovery is uniform across all cells or specific to a subset of the network. To address this issue, we used chronic calcium imaging in behaving adult mice to examine the activity of individual <b>excitatory</b> and inhibitory <b>neurons</b> in the same region of the layer 2 / 3 monocular visual cortex following enucleation. We found that only a fraction of <b>excitatory</b> <b>neurons</b> homeostatically recover activity after deprivation and inhibitory neurons show no recovery.

40|$|SummaryThe hippocampus, {{as part of}} the {{cerebral}} cortex, is essential for memory formation and spatial navigation. Although it has been extensively studied, especially as a model system for neurophysiology, the cellular processes involved in constructing and organizing the hippocampus remain largely unclear. Here, we show that clonally related <b>excitatory</b> <b>neurons</b> in the developing hippocampus are progressively organized into discrete horizontal, but not vertical, clusters in the stratum pyramidale, as revealed by both cell-type-specific retroviral labeling and mosaic analysis with double markers (MADM). Moreover, distinct from those in the neocortex, sister <b>excitatory</b> <b>neurons</b> in the cornu ammonis 1 region of the hippocampus rarely develop electrical or chemical synapses with each other.

40|$|SummaryThe primate dorsolateral {{prefrontal cortex}} (DLPFC) and {{anterior}} cingulate cortex (ACC) focus attention on relevant signals and suppress noise in cognitive tasks. However, their synaptic interactions and unique roles in cognitive control are unknown. We report that two distinct pathways to DLPFC area 9, one from the neighboring area 46 and the other from the functionally distinct ACC, similarly innervate <b>excitatory</b> <b>neurons</b> associated with selecting relevant stimuli. However, ACC has more prevalent and larger synapses with inhibitory neurons and preferentially innervates calbindin inhibitory neurons, which reduce noise by inhibiting <b>excitatory</b> <b>neurons.</b> In contrast, area 46 mostly innervates calretinin inhibitory <b>neurons,</b> which disinhibit <b>excitatory</b> <b>neurons.</b> These synaptic specializations suggest that ACC has a greater impact in reducing noise in dorsolateral areas during challenging cognitive tasks involving conflict, error, or reversing decisions, mechanisms that are disrupted in schizophrenia.

40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} {{coexistence}} of multiple periodic solutions for an analogue of the integrate-and-fire neuron model of two-neuron recurrent inhibitory loops with delayed feedback, which incorporates the firing process and absolute refractory period. Upon receiving an excitatory {{signal from the}} <b>excitatory</b> <b>neuron,</b> the inhibitory neuron emits a spike with a pattern-related delay, {{in addition to the}} synaptic delay. We present a theoretical framework to view the inhibitory signal from the inhibitory neuron as a self-feedback of the <b>excitatory</b> <b>neuron</b> with this additional delay. Our analysis shows that the inhibitory feedbacks with firing and the absolute refractory period can generate four basic types of oscillations, and the complicated interaction among these basic oscilla-tions leads to a large class of periodic patterns and the occurrence of multistability in the recurrent inhibitory loop. We also introduce the average time of convergence to a periodic pattern to deter-mine which periodic patterns have the potential to be used for neural information transmission and cognition processing in the nervous system...|$|E

Mouse Disc 1 has been implicated in brain development, mainly in the proliferation, differentiation, lamination, neurite outgrowth and synapse formation and maintenance of cortical <b>excitatory</b> <b>neurons.</b> Here, the effects of two loss-of-function point mutations in the mouse Disc 1 sequence (Q 31 L and L 100 P) on cortical inhibitory interneurons were investigated. None of the mutations affected the overall number of interneurons. However, the 100 P, but not the 31 L, mutation resulted in a significant decrease in the numbers of interneurons expressing parvalbumin mRNA and protein across the sensory cortex. To investigate role of Disc 1 in regulation of parvalbumin expression, mouse wild-type Disc- 1 or the 100 P mutant form were electroporated in utero into cortical <b>excitatory</b> <b>neurons.</b> Overexpression of wild-type Disc 1 in these cells caused increased densities of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons in the electroporated area and in areas connected with it, whereas expression of Disc 1 - 100 P did not. We conclude that the 100 P mutation prevents expression of parvalbumin by a normally sized cohort of interneurons and that altering Disc 1 function in cortical <b>excitatory</b> <b>neurons</b> indirectly affects parvalbumin expression by cortical interneurons, perhaps as a result of altered functional input from the <b>excitatory</b> <b>neurons...</b>|$|R

For an inhibitory-excitatory (IE) synaptic coupling, the approach to a partially synchronized state is shown to vary qualitatively depending on whether the input is less or more than a critical value.
