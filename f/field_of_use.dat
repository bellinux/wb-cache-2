2500|$|LGE’s {{argument}} for non-exhaustion sought {{to invoke the}} doctrine of General Talking Pictures Corp. v. Western Electric Co. In that case, the patentee had granted no license for “commercial” amplifiers. [...] Therefore, when a manufacturer licensed only in the “non-commercial” <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> sold an amplifier to an accused infringer, who knowingly resold it in the commercial market, the manufacturer “could not convey to [...] what both knew it was not authorized to sell.” By parity of reasoning, LGE said, it had licensed Intel only {{in the field of}} manufacturing microprocessor products for combination with specified products and not with other products.

2500|$|Flook's {{method was}} {{identical}} to previous systems {{except for the}} mathematical algorithm. In fact, although the patent examiner and the Supreme Court opinions assumed that Flook had originated the mathematical technique, someone else had published it {{a number of years}} earlier. In Gottschalk v. Benson, the court had ruled that the discovery of a new formula is not patentable. This case differed from Benson by including a specific application—catalytic conversion of hydrocarbons—for the formula as a claim limitation (a so-called <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> limitation). The patent examiner rejected the patent application as [...] "in practical effect" [...] a claim to the formula or its mathematics. When the decision was appealed, the Board of Appeals of the Patent and Trademark Office sustained the examiner's rejection.|$|E
