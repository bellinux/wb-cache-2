After 1880, the population declined due to large steamships now being used for the sealing fishery.

40|$|A closed {{fishing season}} {{is arguably the}} most {{important}} fisheries regulation measure implemented by the government of India in the new millennium. Applied mainly to the <b>inshore</b> trawl <b>fishing</b> <b>fleet,</b> the planners' intention was a safe-guarding of capture fisheries. This article, which is based on fieldwork in seven harbour locations, considers the socio-economic consequences of the closed fishing season for trawler fishermen in the state of Tamil Nadu. It concludes that the success of the ban is based on cooperation between government and local fisher associations, and on broad agreement as to its necessity. Those who are impacted most by the implementation of the closed fishing season are lower-class workers and traders lacking opportunities for alternative employment.

40|$|The Newfoundland and Labrador <b>inshore</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>fleet</b> is in {{a unique}} {{situation}} in that they fish up to 350 miles offshore. The industry evolved from a fleet fishing for cod in short trips close to home, until the collapse of that species in 1992, to a fleet fishing multiple species wherever they can. Unfortunately, the small fishing boat regulation did not evolve with the vessels. This gave rise, because {{of a number of}} factors, to vessels becoming wider and higher but not longer. In an effort to design a vessel more appropriate for the conditions and species being harvested an unrestricted vessel was designed for the fleet under a separate project (Friis, et al. 2007). [...] This thesis describes the results of experiments conducted on this unrestricted vessel. The thesis looks specifically at four different bulbous bow options and how they compare to a conventional bow. Resistance, self-propulsion and head seas resistance, pitch and heave motion experiments were completed for the thesis. The intent is to contribute to the general knowledge of bulbous bow design for fishing vessels in Newfoundland and Labrador...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{identifies}} the possible {{effects of climate}} change on fish stocks important for the Norwegian fishing fleet along with information on the Norwegian harvest pattern in the past can tell us something about the consequences of a changing climate for the fishing fleet. A survey the Directorate of Fisheries’s landings and settlement register are performed on a subsample of the Norwegian fishing fleet consisting of factory trawlers, other trawlers, large conventional fishing vessels and small inshore fishing vessels. The relative importance fish stocks and harvest areas are described for the period 2000 - 2006. We combine the information retrieved in the previous sections and try to say something about the fishing fleet’s ability to cope with change. The trawlers and the large conventional vessels specialize in targeting the large fish stocks, such as cod saithe and haddock, and as the stocks are expected to gain from higher ocean temperatures and expand their area of distribution, the ocean going vessels will also benefit from this. The <b>inshore</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>fleet</b> also target the same fish stocks, but are more limited in their ability to take advantage of expansions off shore. However, the coastal fishing fleet is a very diverse group, harvesting a number of alternative species living in different coastal areas and can be expected to take advantage of new species entering the ecosystem following a warmer climate...|$|E

40|$|Information on the {{distribution}} and intensity of <b>inshore</b> <b>fishing</b> activity is needed to inform marine spatial planning and to assess fisheries interactions with the environment and other industries. Although fishing vessels under 15 m (overall length) account for 98. 4 % (2011 value) {{by the number of}} the European <b>fleet,</b> information on <b>inshore</b> <b>fishing</b> activity in Europe is very limited as there is no statutory satellite monitoring of smaller vessels (< 15 m length before 2012, < 12 m thereafter). Here, we develop, present, and apply a method which uses sightings-per-unit-effort (SPUE) estimates calculated from fisheries enforcement data to describe {{the distribution}} and intensity of <b>inshore</b> <b>fishing</b> activity off the coasts of England and Wales. For the larger inshore vessels, the SPUE estimates of activity were validated with vessel monitoring system (VMS) data and showed good agreement at the scale of analysis. Fishing activity estimates from SPUE are presented with an assessment of uncertainty, to account for spatial differences in enforcement activity. Our estimates of the distribution and intensity of <b>inshore</b> <b>fishing</b> activity and will complement estimates of offshore fishing activity based on VMS...|$|R

A wide variety of seabirds roost and nest on the island but feed on schools of fish and squid. This diversity reflects the mixing of tropical species with temperate species and the range of marine environments present.|$|R
40|$|<b>Inshore</b> <b>fishing,</b> by boats under 10 m, {{has a long}} {{tradition}} on the coasts of England but its role in the contemporary communities is not well understood, and increasingly policy makers have become focused on trying to find ways to improve its environmental, social and ecological sustainability. This paper reports on a research project that sought, through case studies on the English coast, to explore the socio-cultural role that <b>inshore</b> <b>fishing</b> plays and how policies could be developed to enhance its contributions. <b>Inshore</b> <b>fishing</b> was found to be highly valued not only for its importance in supporting livelihoods, but also in the creation of place identities tied to fishing as an occupation and the ecological opportunities for fishing that are available at the different localities. Findings are discussed in the context of harnessing these attributes for fostering sustainable fishing communities, underpinned by strengthening the ties between the catch and the locality...|$|R

The project has involved a range of research projects, regeneration activities and case studies across southern England, northern France, Flanders and the southern Netherlands.
