5|$|In {{the sixth}} match, Ric Flair defended the WWE Intercontinental Championship against Triple H inside a Steel Cage, which gained 83% of the vote. During the match, Triple H sent Flair head-first into the steel cage, bloodying Flair's from the head. In one point, Triple H {{retrieved}} a steel chain, {{wrapped it around}} <b>his</b> <b>fist</b> <b>and</b> attempted a diving fist drop from the top turnbuckle. However, Flair countered, raising his foot to Triple H's face and performed a series of knife edged chops. Triple H controlled most of the match, until he attempted to apply the figure four leglock, a signature move of Flair's, resulting in Flair sending him towards the steel cage. After that, Flair bit Triple H's head, bloodying him from his forehead, this often results when a wrestler is trapped, either {{in a corner of}} the ring or in a submission hold, as a desperation move. The match ended when Flair reversed a Pedigree with a back body drop and hit Triple H with a steel chair thrice, allowing Flair to escape through the steel cage door to win the match and retain his Intercontinental title.|$|E
25|$|Germany's {{opponent}} in the semifinals was Italy. The Italians had the better chances to score but Lehmann made several spectacular saves, including one in extra time where he dived out of goal to intercept an Italian player who had broken loose from the defence, punching the ball clear with <b>his</b> <b>fist</b> <b>and</b> temporarily knocking out the Italian in the process. He allowed two goals within a minute of each other {{with only a few}} seconds remaining in extra time, which put Italy into the World Cup final. The retiring Oliver Kahn was given the honour of starting in the third place play-off match, an offer made by Lehmann himself. Kahn was made captain for that game due to the injury to Michael Ballack. Germany defeated Portugal 3–1 for the third place (bronze) medals.|$|E
25|$|On May 16, 1562, Adham Khan, Akbar's {{general and}} foster brother, was defenestrated twice for murdering a rival general, Ataga Khan, {{who had been}} {{recently}} promoted by Akbar. Akbar was woken up in the tumult after the murder. He struck Adham Khan down personally with <b>his</b> <b>fist</b> <b>and</b> immediately ordered his defenestration by royal order. The first time, his legs were broken {{as a result of}} the 12 meter fall from the ramparts of Agra Fort but he remained alive. Akbar, in a rare act of cruelty probably exacerbated by his anger at the loss of his favorite general, ordered his defenestration a second time, killing him. Adham Khan had wrongly counted on the influence of his mother and Akbar's wet nurse, Maham Anga, to save him as she was almost an unofficial regent in the days of Akbar's youth. Akbar personally informed Maham Anga of her son's death, to which she famously commented, 'You have done well.' She died 40 days later of acute depression.|$|E

500|$|In {{the first}} days of the cartoon's existence, Jack often commented on alcohol, his lack of a job, and his wife. In recent years, the cartoon has taken a {{politically}} correct tone, except on occasion. After the Sept. 11 attacks, Sourdough Jack was pictured shaking <b>his</b> <b>fist</b> <b>and</b> saying, [...] "It's time to terrorize the terrorists!" [...] About that time, the original Sourdough Jack drawings that had been reproduced since 1952 were replaced by new drawings made in a similar style. This was required due to the growing fuzziness of the reproduced image and the transition to digital newspaper production.|$|E
500|$|Paul had a {{reputation}} as a physically tough player and inspirational captain. Team-mate Ken Barnes described him as a player who was [...] "more about power than guile", and called him a [...] "born leader" [...] who was [...] "brilliant in the air". Paul's approach to captaincy was to ensure that every player gave as much effort as possible, mixing the respect of his colleagues with the occasional attempt to frighten them into action; in the tunnel prior to the 1956 FA Cup Final his last action before leading out his team was to hold up <b>his</b> <b>fist</b> <b>and</b> shout [...] "If we don't fucking win, you'll get some of this".|$|E
500|$|When this failed, {{it seems}} Sejanus turned his {{attention}} toward eliminating Drusus. By AD 23 the enmity {{between the two men}} had reached a critical point. During an argument Drusus had struck the prefect with <b>his</b> <b>fist,</b> <b>and</b> he openly lamented that [...] "a stranger was invited to assist in the government while the emperor's son was alive". With Tiberius already in his sixties, there was a real possibility of Drusus succeeding his father in the near future. To secure his position, Sejanus secretly plotted against Drusus and seduced his wife Livilla. With her as an accomplice, Drusus was slowly poisoned and died of seemingly natural causes on September 13, AD 23.|$|E

500|$|In 1951, Bouchard was {{involved}} in a legal first when he was a defendant in a lawsuit brought by a New York Rangers fan. The fan claimed Bouchard had struck him with his stick when he was waving to a friend watching the game on TV. Bouchard said the fan had actually raised his fist towards a fellow Canadiens player who was being taken off the ice with an injury and his stick hit the fan accidentally as he tried to ward off the blow. In what may have been the first time in legal history, evidence was taken during a trial from someone witnessing an event on a television as the fan's friend testified he'd seen Bouchard strike the blow. Bouchard won the case when Otis Guernsey, president of Abercrombie and Fitch, who was at the game testified he heard [...] "vile language" [...] and saw the fan raise <b>his</b> <b>fist</b> <b>and</b> not wave.|$|E
500|$|British Railways laid on 38 special {{trains to}} take some 19,000 {{supporters}} to London, {{the first of which}} arrived at St Pancras station from Manchester Central shortly after 3a.m. For the first time, the official programmes were on sale from early morning in an attempt to thwart sellers of unofficial versions. The Birmingham Mail set up a temporary press in a Wembley car park to produce a special edition of their Saturday sports paper, the Sports Argus, on blue paper rather than the usual pink. As the teams prepared in the dressing rooms, the crowd was led in communal singing, including songs with resonance for each of the two teams, [...] "She's a lassie from Lancashire" [...] and [...] "Keep right on {{to the end of the}} road", and the hymn [...] "Abide with Me", traditionally sung before every FA Cup final. As the teams emerged from the tunnel, Manchester City captain Roy Paul seized one last opportunity to stir emotion within the players by stopping, raising <b>his</b> <b>fist</b> <b>and</b> shouting [...] "If we don't fucking win, you'll get some of this".|$|E
500|$|By {{this time}} the enmity between Drusus and Sejanus had reached a {{critical}} point: Drusus had struck the prefect with <b>his</b> <b>fist,</b> <b>and</b> openly lamented that [...] "a stranger was invited {{to assist in the}} government while the emperor's son was alive". According to Levick, there is nothing to suggest bad relations between the two before this point, especially not as far back as 14, during their expedition to Pannonia. She says, however, {{it may have been the}} clash between theatrical claqueurs and the Praetorian Guard in 15 that began the quarrel, but not enough is known to say for certain. Of more concern to Drusus was, perhaps, that in 20 his father mentioned Sejanus to the Senate in terms that treated him as his partner in power. For Drusus, the heir of that exact position, this was a legitimate cause for concern. [...] At the time, Tiberius was in his sixties, so there was a realistic possibility of Drusus succeeding his father in the near future. In the account of Tacitus, Sejanus began plotting against Drusus in secrecy to secure his position.|$|E

500|$|Edge and Mick Foley versus Tommy Dreamer and Terry Funk {{was next}} {{in what was}} a Hardcore Tag Team match. Before the match began Edge and Foley entered the ring, {{accompanied}} by Lita and Dreamer and Funk entered the ring, accompanied by Beulah McGillicutty, which turned the match into a Hardcore six-person tag-team match. Despite McGillicutty and Lita being added to the match, they {{stayed out of the}} action for most of the contest. Funk was taken backstage halfway through the match as Foley wrapped barbed wire around <b>his</b> <b>fist</b> <b>and</b> raked it across the forehead and eyes of Funk. Funk later returned to the match, hitting Edge and Foley with a Barbed Wire Bat. Funk then set the bat on fire and left it at ringside. Funk hit Foley, and Foley fell onto a Barbed Wire Board. Foley's shirt was on fire, but was put out by a ringside attendant. Dreamer and Funk got the upper-hand after Dreamer DDT'd Edge. Dreamer then locked a Modified Crossface onto Edge, using Barbed wire against Edge's face. Lita broke the hold up only to have Dreamer give her the Spicolli Driver. Edge blindsided Dreamer wrapping Barbed Wire around his head, before dropping him with the Inverted DDT. McGillicutty entered the ring to check on Dreamer, but Edge speared McGillicutty and pinned her with a cover that resembled the [...] "legs up" [...] version of the missionary position.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the night}} of November 26, 1943, the Enterprise {{introduced}} the experiment in the co-operative control of Avengers and Hellcats for night fighting, when the three-plane team from the ship broke up {{a large group of}} land-based bombers attacking Task Group TG 50.2. O'Hare volunteered to lead this mission to conduct the first-ever Navy nighttime fighter attack from an aircraft carrier to intercept a large force of enemy torpedo bombers. When the call came to man the fighters, Butch O'Hare was eating. He grabbed up part of his supper in <b>his</b> <b>fist</b> <b>and</b> started running for the ready room. He was dressed in loose marine coveralls. The night fighter unit consisting of 1 VT and 2 VF was catapulted between 17:58 and 18:01. The pilots for this flight were Butch O'Hare and Ensign Warren Andrew [...] "Andy" [...] Skon of VF-2 in F6Fs and the Squadron Commander of VT-6, LCDR John C. Phillips in a TBF1-C. The crew of the TBF torpedo plane consisted of LTJG Hazen B. Rand, a radar specialist and Alvin Kernan, A. B., AOM1/c. The 'Black Panthers', as the night fighters were dubbed, took off before dusk and flew out into the incoming mass of Japanese planes.|$|E
2500|$|Wallenda did not falter or totter in the {{slightest}} during his walk, nor did he stop to do any extra tricks during the walk (as he often does). Talking to ABC reporters live, {{as he entered the}} final phase of the trip he admitted, [...] "I'm drained... My hands are going numb. I feel like I'm getting weak." [...] Later he said, [...] "my forearm just started to cramp worse than it ever has been before", attributing it the stress of the day. Near the end, he stopped, got down on one knee, and blew a kiss to the crowd. He got up, pumped <b>his</b> <b>fist,</b> <b>and</b> ran the final few steps. He completed the crossing at 10:41p.m. EDT, 25 minutes after he started. In so doing, Wallenda became the first person to cross directly over Niagara Falls on a high-wire. In the 1800s, a few tightrope walkers had crossed over the Niagara Gorge down river, but none had ever crossed directly over the Falls. He also set the world record for longest walk over a waterfall. [...] Prior to Wallenda, the last person to cross the river on tightrope was James Hardy in 1896. According to Wallenda, it was the longest unsupported tightrope walk in history. [...] He carried his passport on the trip and was required to present it to Canadian border guards waiting for him upon his arrival on the Canadian side of the falls.|$|E
