However in the medical domain obtaining structured data can be difficult as the most natural, expressive and comprehensive way to record a clinical <b>encounter</b> <b>is</b> <b>through</b> natural language. The task of creating structured data from naturally expressed information is known as information extraction. Specialised areas of medicine use their own language and data structures; the translation process has unique challenges, and often requires a fresh approach. This research is devoted to creating a novel semi-automated method for generating codified auditing data from clinical notes recorded in a neurosurgical department in an Australian teaching hospital.

40|$|Since {{the early}} days of the atomic age, there has been a need to {{determine}} accurately the radiological exposure to man from internally deposited radionuclides. Publications dating back to 19641 - 4 document numerous internal exposures and elimination pathways for a variety of radionuclides including activation and fission products as well as actinides. Initially, the predominant path of elimination for the majority of the radionuclides <b>encountered</b> <b>was</b> <b>through</b> the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and into the feces. Only a few specific radionuclides including isotopes of hydrogen, iodine, mercury, cesium and molybdenum-technetium were found in the urine in easily detectable quantities. All the other radionuclides were eliminated so exclusively by way of the GI tract that the nuclide could not be detected in the urine in a 1000 -minute count on a 24 -hour sample by gamma spectrometry. An accidental exposure to plutonium involving 78 individuals yielded only 6 urine samples that contained detectable activity; while 68 fecal samples from 22 individuals showed easily detectable levels of plutonium. As pointed out previously, 1 the experimental data shows that the path for clearance of most radionuclides that are inhaled or ingested is more dependent on the physical characteristics of the particles than on the chemical characteristics of the radionuclides.

5000|$|Sexual {{scripting}} {{suggests the}} importance of meanings and symbols in human sexuality. According to Gagnon and Simon, scripts can <b>be</b> layered <b>through</b> three dimensions: 'cultural scenarios', 'interpersonal scenarios', and 'intrapsychic scenarios'. Sexual feeling does not simply happen from within the body but needs meanings and symbols which provide cues and clues to enable sexualities to develop. Cultural scenarios are linked to different historical periods and social change; scripts can be shown to change {{with the arrival of}} HIV/AIDS in the 1980s, for example (Epstein, Lauman ...). Interpersonal scenarios <b>are</b> linked to <b>encounters</b> and interactions (for example in rape, as illustrated in the early work of Stevi Jackson). And intra-psychic scenarios indicate the ways in which personal sexual 'turn ons' and imageries grow. Sexual scripts can be seen as providing guidelines for appropriate sexual behaviour and sexual encounters, as sexual behaviour and <b>encounters</b> <b>are</b> learned <b>through</b> culture and others in interactions. It can be linked to theories of sexual desire but is critical of the tendency to stress the purely biological aspects of desire.|$|R

In Glassground, {{a heightened sense of}} the liminal spaces we often <b>encounter</b> <b>is</b> conveyed <b>through</b> the diffusion of light and shadow on natural and man-made surfaces, and natural effects such as reflection. Glassground invites visitors into a contemplative, observant, and sensory relationship with a transparent building and its situation in nature; the experience is not unlike that of Houghton's as an artist in residence [...] Amidst shifting conditions, multiple viewpoints and contrasting terrain, visitors become aware of the subjective processes through which they engage with the external world, with rural buildings and places; how they move between external and internal spaces, and how they remember such journeys and places.|$|R

40|$|Objectives. Errors in {{eyewitness}} accounts can occur when a witness comes {{into contact with}} post-event ‘misinformation’. A common way to <b>encounter</b> misinformation <b>is</b> <b>through</b> face-to-face interaction, in particular, via conversation with other individuals who also witnessed the crime. The current research compares this kind of misinformation with the non-social post-event narrative method typically employed in laboratory studies. Method. Young (17 – 33 years) and older (58 – 80 years) adults viewed a simulated crime event on video and were later exposed to four items of misinformation about it. The misinformation items were either introduced {{as part of a}} discussion about the event with a confederate or were embedded within a written narrative about the event that participants were asked to read. A questionnaire containing 20 items about the event was given to participants before and after the experimental manipulation. Results. Participants were less accurate than controls on questionnaire items after encountering misinformation. More importantly, misinformation <b>encountered</b> socially <b>was</b> significantly more misleading than misinformation from a non-social source. This was true for both young and older adults. Conclusion. Misinformation encountered socially produced more errors than misinformation from a non-social source. This finding has implications both for applied (forensic) and theoretical understanding of eyewitness memory...|$|R
