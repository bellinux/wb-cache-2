50|$|Observe point Y, {{somewhere to}} the left of P on the graph. If a section of the {{redundant}} agricultural labor force (PQ) is removed from the total agricultural labor force (OP) and absorbed into the <b>industrial</b> <b>sector,</b> then the labor force remaining in the <b>industrial</b> <b>sector</b> is represented by the point Y. Now, the output produced by the remaining labor force is represented by YZ and the real income of this labor force is given by XY. The difference of the two terms yields the total agricultural surplus of the economy. It is important to understand that this surplus is produced by the reallocation of labor such that it is absorbed by the <b>industrial</b> <b>sector.</b> This can be seen as deployment of hidden rural savings for the expansion of the <b>industrial</b> <b>sector.</b> Hence, we can understand the contribution of the agricultural sector to the expansion of <b>industrial</b> <b>sector</b> by this allocation of redundant labor force and the agricultural surplus that results from it.|$|R
