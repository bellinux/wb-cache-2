40|$|Aboriginal {{participation}} {{is a key}} component of environmental assessment (EA), and is recognized in various policy processes concerning natural resources development across Canada. Despite the recognition of the participation of Aboriginal peoples as foundational to effective EA, there are long-standing concerns about the limited influence of Aboriginal communities on decisions about developments on their traditional lands. The recent push for more effective and meaningful Aboriginal engagement in development decisions arises, in part, from increased industry and regulatory demand for the streamlining of EA to achieve a more efficient and timely EA process. Notwithstanding the increasing scholarly and policy literature on Aboriginal participation <b>in</b> <b>EA,</b> little research exists on viable solutions to advance meaningful Aboriginal participation <b>in</b> <b>EA</b> whilst maintaining a degree of process efficiency to support timely EA decisions about resource development. This thesis draws on the experiences from industry, government and Aboriginal communities involved <b>in</b> <b>EA</b> for mineral resource development in northwest Saskatchewan, Canada and case studies <b>in</b> international <b>EA</b> practices, to advance the effectiveness of Aboriginal participation <b>in</b> <b>EA.</b> Effectiveness is defined as participation that is both meaningful to those affected and efficient for those seeking development approvals. The research methodology includes the review of scholarly and policy research, several legal and EA case reviews and semi-structured interviews. First, this thesis examined the evolution of participation <b>in</b> <b>EA</b> <b>in</b> Canada, {{and the extent to which}} scholarly research has contributed to solutions for meaningful Aboriginal participation amidst increasing demands for a regulatory process that is more efficient and with shorter timelines for participation and decision-making. Second, attention is focused on the underlying practice-based challenges to meaningful and efficient Aboriginal participation <b>in</b> <b>EA,</b> explored through semi-structured interviews and a case study of <b>EA</b> <b>in</b> northwest Saskatchewan, and adopting a policy community model. Third, drawing on the international literature, case experience, and lessons from northwest Saskatchewan, reforms and enhancements to the current EA system are proposed to help ensure meaningful and efficient participation of Aboriginal peoples <b>in</b> <b>EA</b> processes. The thesis concludes with a discussion of the main findings, addresses specific recommendations to advance Aboriginal participation <b>in</b> <b>EA</b> for uranium development in northwest Saskatchewan, and identifies opportunities for future policy and scholarly research. Results of this research indicate that many of the challenges are multi-dimensional, and of considerable concern to both meaningful and efficient Aboriginal participation <b>in</b> <b>EA.</b> Understanding the nature of these underlying challenges requires increasing attention to the needs, expectations, roles and responsibilities of key actors engaged <b>in</b> the <b>EA</b> policy community, and exploring the much needed institutional and process reforms are critical to advancing meaningful Aboriginal participation <b>in</b> <b>EA</b> without compromising timely decisions for development proponents...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{hepatocyte}} {{growth factor}} (HGF) receptor, Met, has established oncogenic properties; however, its expression and function <b>in</b> esophageal adenocarcinoma (<b>EA)</b> remain poorly understood. We aimed {{to determine the}} expression and potential alterations in Met expression <b>in</b> <b>EA.</b> Met expression was investigated in surgical specimens of EA, Barrett's esophagus (BE), and normal esophagus (NE) using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Met expression, phosphorylation, {{and the effect of}} COX- 2 inhibition on expression were examined <b>in</b> <b>EA</b> cell lines. IHC demonstrated intense Met immunoreactivity in all (100 %) EA and dysplastic BE specimens. In contrast, minimal immunostaining was observed in BE without dysplasia or NE specimens. Met mRNA and protein levels were increased <b>in</b> three <b>EA</b> cell lines, and Met protein was phosphorylated in the absence of serum. Sequence analysis found the kinase domain of c-met to be wild type <b>in</b> all three <b>EA</b> cell lines. HGF mRNA expression was identified <b>in</b> two <b>EA</b> cell lines. <b>In</b> COX- 2 -overexpressing cells, COX- 2 inhibition decreased Met expression. Met is consistently overexpressed <b>in</b> <b>EA</b> surgical specimens and <b>in</b> three <b>EA</b> cell lines. Met dysregulation occurs early in Barrett's dysplasia to adenocarcinoma sequence. Future study of Met inhibition as a potential biologic therapy for EA is warranted...|$|R

50|$|There {{is special}} {{interest}} in understanding the mechanism underlying class I monomers self-assembly that leads to formation of tough, ordered amphipathic rodlet monolayers, due to their intrinsic properties and due to substantial information available from several characterisation studies of the class I hydrophobins EAS and DewA. These mechanisms have been greatly studied by targeted mutagenesis {{in an effort to}} identify the key amino acid sequence regions driving rodlet self-assembly.A model for the monomeric form of EAS was proposed by Kwan et al. (2006) from structural data obtained from NMR spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction experiments that indicated the presence of four-stranded, antiparallel β-barrel core structure <b>in</b> <b>EAS</b> that allows monomer linking through backbone H-bonding. There are secondary elements around this β-barrel core like the Cys3-Cys4 and Cys7-Cys8 loops. This model is consistent with the amyloid-like structure that class I rodlets form, in which the β-strands are oriented perpendicular to the cross-β scaffold axis of the fibre.|$|E
