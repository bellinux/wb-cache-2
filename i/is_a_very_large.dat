Periodically the three student councils, along with the Etoiles, meet in the Astraea Joint Student Council. The Astraea Hill school system employs the Scottish system of grade numbering.

However there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>large</b> Batch almost {{in the middle of}} Camerton that is now a designated Local Nature Reserve. The Batch was bare, like the Paulton ones until, according to locals, the wife of the owner of Camerton Court decided to pay for it to be planted with trees to improve the view. There are small batches at Clutton, east of Radford Hill and at Greyfields, High Littleton.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} and pelvic fins are {{broad and}} rounded and are thickly muscled. The two similarly-sized dorsal fins are placed well {{back on the}} body. The anal fin is low and positioned {{just in front of}} the caudal fin. The caudal fin has only an upper lobe, which contains a prominent ventral notch near the tip and is angled almost horizontally relative to the body. Adult epaulette sharks are beige to brownish above with many widely spaced brown spots and subtle darker bands. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>large</b> black spot ringed in white located behind each pectoral fin; this pair of spots are the origin of this shark's common name. Juveniles have alternating light and dark bands over their body and fins, which break up as they mature. Epaulette sharks are typically 7090cm (2735 in) long; the maximum reported length is 107cm (42in).|$|E
5|$|This {{work was}} {{discovered}} by Gotthold Ephraim Lessing in a Greek manuscript consisting of a poem of 44 lines, in the Herzog August Library in Wolfenbüttel, Germany in 1773. It is addressed to Eratosthenes and the mathematicians in Alexandria. Archimedes challenges them to count the numbers of cattle in the Herd of the Sun by solving a number of simultaneous Diophantine equations. There is a more difficult version {{of the problem in}} which some of the answers are required to be square numbers. This version of the problem was first solved by A. Amthor in 1880, and the answer <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>large</b> number, approximately 7.760271.|$|E

5|$|The desert nomads {{were also}} traders. The Sahara <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>large</b> expanse of land {{stretching}} from the Atlantic rim to Egypt. Trade routes were developed linking the Sahel in the south with the fertile Mediterranean region {{to the north and}} large numbers of camels were used to carry valuable goods across the desert interior. The Tuareg were traders and the goods transported traditionally included slaves, ivory and gold going northwards and salt going southwards. Berbers with knowledge of the region were employed to guide the caravans between the various oases and wells. Several million slaves may have been taken northwards across the Sahara between the 8th and 18th centuries. Traditional means of overland transport declined with the advent of motor vehicles, shipping and air freight, but caravans still travel along routes between Agadez and Bilma and between Timbuktu and Taoudenni carrying salt from the interior to desert-edge communities.|$|E

25|$|There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>large</b> danger with glacier travel, {{with even}} short treks across the ice.

25|$|Birthday {{celebrations}} {{are often}} associated with large increases in alcohol consumption.

The excavations at Spong Hill, for example, revealed over 2,000 cremations and inhumations in what <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>large</b> early cemetery. However, when the period of use is taken into account (over 200 years) and its size, it is presumed {{to be a major}} cemetery for the entire area and not just one village, it does point to a smaller rather than large number of original immigrants of 20,000.|$|E
