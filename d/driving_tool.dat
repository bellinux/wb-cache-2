50|$|The {{friction}} pile driving process starts by laying the grout shoe {{at the proper}} location and inserting the spigot end of the pile shaft into the conical point. The pile is kept in place {{by a series of}} keeper plates within the conical grout shoe. As the pile is driven the conical grout shoe creates an annulus between the pile shaft and the surrounding soils. This annulus is immediately and consistently filled with a sand grout that is pumped down the pile shaft and exits within spaced between the keeper fins in the conical points. The breaker hammer <b>driving</b> <b>tool</b> is fitted with a special grout box adapter to allow the grout to flow from the grout pump through the <b>driving</b> <b>tool</b> down into the upper most pile shaft. The pumping rate of the grout should slightly exceed the take rate of the grout. In softer soils the grout takes tend to be higher due to outward bulging of the grout column.|$|E

50|$|An {{impact socket}} wrench is a {{cylindrical}} shaped tool {{with a female}} opening to fit over a nut or bolt head, and is most commonly 6-point hexagonal shaped; generally used with the assist of a power tool such as an Impact wrench or hydraulic torque wrench. Sizes range from the very small, to massive sizes weighing hundreds of pounds each. Impact sockets typically connect with the <b>driving</b> <b>tool</b> {{by way of a}} male to female square drive connection (or less commonly a spline drive connection). The use of power tools and ratchet wrenches with sockets makes tightening and removing bolts incredibly easy over alternative methods like combination wrenches and other manual methods.|$|E
5000|$|Socket {{wrenches}} {{are most}} commonly hexagonal, or more {{commonly referred to}} as [...] "6-point" [...] in lay terms. Sockets are driven by being attached to the <b>driving</b> <b>tool</b> via a male/female square connection fitting (called the square drive). Standard sizes of square drives around the world include 1/4", 3/8", 1/2", 3/4", 1", 1-1/2", 2-1/2" [...] and 3-1/2" [...] square drive sizes (a de facto international standard with no metric equivalents) along with some lesser used drivers such as 5/8" [...] square drive, and both #4 and #5 spline drives specified in ANSI B107 specifications. This wide range of square drive sizes provides {{for a wide variety of}} socket types and sizes to suit small to very large nuts and bolts. Some square drivers have a through hole to attach the socket to the driver (using a retaining ring with o-ring and pin type, or single piece molded retaining rings), a locking pin, or friction ball. Some common hand ratchets employ a quick release button on their top for quick socket release of smaller sockets.The tool chosen to drive the socket wrench ultimately supplies the mechanical advantage needed by the user to provide the torque needed to loosen or tighten the fastener as may be required. Larger drivers are typically used with higher torque, while smaller drivers are used for convenience in smaller low torque applications. Given the limits of human strength and fatigue, torque above 600 ft-lbs of torque will generally involve some kind of power assist, instead of the user simply pushing on the handle of a wrench. Very large sockets and drivers are typically powered by hydraulics to achieve torque.|$|E

Probably, a combination of angiogenic and analgesic effects explains the overall outcomes on the target tissues [7, 8, 19 – 23].

Following illusory tool use, tactile perception was recalibrated on this stationary arm, and with equal magnitude as physical use.

40|$|The {{ability of}} {{localized}} surface plasmons to squeeze light and engineer nanoscale electromagnetic fields through electron-photon coupling at dimensions below the wavelength has turned plasmonics into a <b>driving</b> <b>tool</b> {{in a variety}} of technological applications, targeting novel and more efficient optoelectronic processes. In this context, the development of active control of plasmon excitations is a major fundamental and practical challenge. We propose a mechanism for fast and active control of the optical response of metallic nanostructures based on exploiting quantum effects in subnanometric plasmonic gaps. By applying an external dc bias across a narrow gap, a substantial change in the tunneling conductance across the junction can be induced at optical frequencies, which modifies the plasmonic resonances of the system in a reversible manner. We demonstrate the feasibility of the concept using time-dependent density functional theory calculations. Thus, along with two-dimensional structures, metal nanoparticle plasmonics can benefit from the reversibility, fast response time, and versatility of an active control strategy based on applied bias.

30|$|This section {{reviews the}} extant {{literature}} on the two aspects of transparency such as predictability and accountability practices and FTA trade policy measures. The discussion also explains how these measures are <b>driving</b> <b>tools</b> for growth. Transparency applies to the count of interconnected efforts, enclosing how policy is nurtured and implemented. Also, transparency can signify different things to various groups and perhaps essential for various causes (Williams 2015) and explain the “release of information by institutions that is relevant to evaluating those institutions” (Florini et al. 2000, p. 5). Thus, transparency is the obtainability of information about an institution or actor authorizing external actors to oversee the internal functioning or accomplishments of that institution (Grimmelikhuijsen and Meijer 2012). Further, transparency has been developed to impart information among border management agencies, traders, international manufacturers, importers, and international governments (Turnes and Ernst 2015). Transparency functions well in the trading process to which translucency supplements more aims in dispensing information as well as escalating ideas on the aim of trading policy rules (Collins-Williams and Wolfe 2010).|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to fabricate and characterize an adaptive optofluidic lens device with aberration control. In this work, an electric field is employed as a <b>driving</b> <b>tool</b> to manipulate the liquid-liquid interface for suppressing spherical aberration by using a single flat unstructured electrode. The equilibrium lens meniscus profiles are determined by the balance of Laplace pressure and Maxwell stress. It involves understanding the response of a liquid drop under the influence of electric field and further discerning the optimum drop shapes which would yield the best optical performance. First, lenses are characterized by capturing the side view images of meniscus profiles and calculating the Longitudinal spherical aberration (LSA) by geometrical ray tracing. Subsequently, ray tracing analysis of optically measured lens profiles is performed on Zemax for numerically computing the Zernike spherical aberration (ZSA) coefficients and other standard optical metrics. Next, all-electrically controlled optofluidic lens device with EW-based pressure controller and electrically adjustable lens shape is designed and fabricated. The optical performance of lens device is evaluated by experimentally measuring the ZSA coefficients by using a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor (SHWS). The measured range of EW-tunability of focal length and spherical aberration is 10. 1 mm to 26. 76 mm and 0. 059 waves to 0. 003 waves respectively...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} studies two computational techniques that improve the practical performance of existing implementations of interior point methods for linear programming. Both {{are based on}} the concept of symmetric neighbourhood as the <b>driving</b> <b>tool</b> for the analysis of the good performance of some practical algorithms. The symmetric neighbourhood adds explicit upper bounds on the complementarity pairs, besides the lower bound already present in the common N− 1 neighbourhood. This allows the algorithm to keep under control the spread among complementarity pairs and reduce it with the barrier parameter μ. We show that a long-step feasible algorithm based on this neighbourhood is globally convergent and converges in O(nL) iterations. The use of the symmetric neighbourhood and the recent theoretical under- standing of the behaviour of Mehrotra’s corrector direction motivate the introduction of a weighting mechanism that can be applied to any corrector direction, whether originating from Mehrotra’s predictor–corrector algorithm or as part of the multiple centrality correctors technique. Such modification in the way a correction is applied aims to ensure that any computed search direction can positively contribute to a successful iteration by increasing the overall stepsize, thus avoid- ing the case that a corrector is rejected. The usefulness of the weighting strategy is documented through complete numerical experiments on various sets of publicly available test problems. The implementation within the hopdm interior point code shows remarkable time savings for large-scale linear programming problems. The second technique develops an efficient way of constructing a starting point for structured large-scale stochastic linear programs. We generate a computation- ally viable warm-start point by solving to low accuracy a stochastic problem of much smaller dimension. The reduced problem is the deterministic equivalent program corresponding to an event tree composed of a restricted number of scenarios. The solution to the reduced problem is then expanded {{to the size of the}} problem instance, and used to initialise the interior point algorithm. We present theoretical conditions that the warm-start iterate has to satisfy in order to be successful. We implemented this technique in both the hopdm and the oops frameworks, and its performance is verified through a series of tests on problem instances coming from various stochastic programming sources.

40|$|Publisher横浜Student final reports Group 14 Nowadays, there're {{more and}} more elderly {{people all over the}} world, {{especially}} in developed countries. Japan, {{one of the most striking}} nations in Asia, can't avert this kind of inevitable trend and just sit on the sidelines. Faced with the circumstances that the number of aged drivers in Japan is ever-increasing, we've perceived the importance of taking the issue into consideration seriously. In other words, the reason why we chose the subject to investigate is not only based on potential prospect of capitalist economies, but in an effort to reinforce the driving security for elderly people. We've perceived the fact that the number of traffic accidents is increasing significantly with more aged drivers, a phenomenon which may have something to do with the current law in Japan. According to the law, those who over 70 can update their driver licences with little difficulty, merely by attending some training courses. This has resulted in rising rates of accidents, dangers looming ahead. Surprisingly, we found in our interview results that automobile makers and insurance companies don't have any business model for senior drivers on hand. The elderly, however, are fully aware of the decline in driving ability and the prolongation in reaction time. They responded that they need an easy and enjoyable <b>driving</b> <b>tool.</b> We managed to deal with the problem mentioned above and try our best to find a resolution by developing our product, meanwhile using Customer Value Chain Analysis to confirm the connections of products and its stakeholders. We found that our stakeholders are senior drivers and their families, another person, advertiser, mobile phone carrier, mobile application provider. Once we have clarified our stakeholders, we're able to progress step by step. The mission of our business is to eliminate traffic accidents directly associated with aged driving. To achieve it, we set our goal to offer the safety-security information assisting senior drivers with a brief glasses tool which linked a mobile phone (Eye-Vision). We believe the technical device will surely make a difference. In financial prospect, we get an income by displaying an advertisement when it displays safety-security information, which ought to cover relevant costs. To make Eye-Vision to the market, we still have to go through validation and verification test, in order to make sure the efficiency of this system. One of the key points we have to test is that this system has no interference to the drivers while they are driving, while providing them supporting information of the road and traffic condition...|$|E

40|$|University rankings {{during last}} decade became {{extremely}} popular and “fashionable” topic for general discussions {{and also for}} academic researches. As Hazelkorn mentioned in her recently published book (2011), “there is a growing obsession with university rankings around the world. What started as an academic exercise in the early 20 th century in the US became a commercial ‘information’ service for students in the 1980 s and the progenitor of a ‘reputation race’ with geo-political implications today”. Also there is strong critique of the general idea of ranking regarding educational institutions and the existing methodologies of evaluation {{of the quality of}} university performance - “many of institutional leaders set rankings as their benchmark in their vision or master plan for the university. Nevertheless, academics are quite skeptical of rankings because they believe that they mislead higher education institutions as well as have enormous methodological limitations”(Shin, Toutkoushian, Teichler, 2011). Our idea is to look at rankings as a certain innovative technology, which enforces dramatic changes of university education in the context of globalization and helps to create global hierarchy of academic institutions. The creation of global educational space, started in the last decades of the 20 th century, provoked numerous challenges for national universities as the centre of producing of the certain type of cultural identity (Readings, 1996). In situation of these changes, rankings become <b>driving</b> <b>tools</b> for university managers how to reform the university. They also shape the concept of “world class university”(Salmi, 2009) as the ideal model (in Weberian sense) of university in contemporary situation. Our idea is to analyze and to compare 3 variants of such academic hierarchies, based in 2011 on the most influential university rankings: 1) Academic ranking of world universities (ARWU); 2) Times higher education world university rankings and 3) QS World University Rankings.

Second, it will use clinical information to measure how well this model is able to predict post-operation results in refractive surgery, attempting to meet clinical standards of error. The model of the crystalline lens proposed within this thesis is shown to be valid, as {{it is able to}} both reproduce individual patient's optical information, and correctly predicts the optical results of a refractive surgery of an individual human eye within clinical standards of error...|$|R
