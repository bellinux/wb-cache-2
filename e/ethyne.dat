40|$|Photosynthesis, which {{depends on}} light-driven energy and {{electron}} transfer in assemblies of porphyrins, chlorophylls, and carotenoids, {{is just one}} example of the many complex natural systems of photobiology. A fuller understanding of the spectroscopy and photophysics of simple aromatic molecules is central to elucidating photochemical processes in the more sophisticated assemblies of photobiology. Moreover, developing a better grasp of the photophysics of simple aromatic molecules will also enhance our ability to create and improve practical applications in photochemical energy conversion, molecular nanophotonics, and molecular electronics. In this Account, we present a concerted experimental and theoretical study of aromatic <b>ethynes,</b> aromatic nitriles, and fluorinated benzenes, illustrating the important roles that the low-lying 3 ̆c 03 ̆c 3 * state plays in the electronic relaxation of these aromatic compounds. Diphenylacetylene, 4 -dialkylaminobenzonitriles, 4 -dialkylaminobenzethynes, and fluorinated benzenes exhibit fluorescence that strongly quenches as the excitation energy is increased for gas-phase systems and at elevated temperatures in solution. Much of this interesting photophysical behavior {{can be attributed to the}} presence of a dark intermediate state that crosses the fluorescent 3 ̆c 03 ̆c 0 * state. Our quantum chemistry calculations, as well as time-resolved laser spectroscopies, indicate that this dark intermediate state is the 3 ̆c 03 ̆c 3 * state that arises from the promotion of an electron from the 3 ̆c 0 orbital of the phenyl ring to the 3 ̆c 3 * orbital localized in the CtX group (where X is CH and N) or on the CsX group (where X is a halogen). These crossings not only lead to the strong excitation energy and temperature dependence of fluorescence but also induce highly interesting 3 ̆c 03 ̆c 3 *-mediated intramolecular charge transfer in 4 -dialkylaminobenzonitriles. Most previous studies on the excited-state dynamics of organic molecules have examined aromatic hydrocarbons, nitrogen heterocycles, aromatic carbonyl compounds, and polyenes, which have low-lying excited states of 3 ̆c 03 ̆c 0 * character (hydrocarbons and polyenes) or n 3 ̆c 0 * and 3 ̆c 03 ̆c 0 * character (carbonyls and N-heterocycles). These studies have revealed important involvement of selection rules (promoting vibrational modes and spin-orbit coupling) and Franck-Condon factors for radiationless transitions, which have important effects on photophysical properties. The recent experimental and time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations of aromatic <b>ethynes,</b> nitriles, and perfluorinated benzenes described in this Account demonstrate the importance of the bound excited state of a 3 ̆c 03 ̆c 3 * configuration in these molecules.

40|$|The work {{detailed}} {{in this thesis}} concerns organic thin films synthesised either using R. F. inductively coupled plasmas excited in unsaturated monomers containing either fluorine or a nitrile group, or else irradiating the said monomers in vacuo using ultraviolet light. The effect of the following parameters on the composition {{and structure of the}} resultant films was determined using ESCA/XPS : a) power input to the R. F. plasma system, b) photon flux during UV irradiation, c) monomer type (including structural isomerism), and d) monomer flow rate. Relative system deposition rates were rationalised in terms of Yasuda's parameter, W/FM, which was found to hold true qualitatively, if not quantitatively. Introduction of halogen vapour to the plasma system in the presence of nitrile monomers physically decreased the glow volume. Analysis by ESCA and UV absorption spectroscopy revealed the presence of ionic halogen species in the resultant films. An overall decrease in deposition rate of the system was also observed. A similar result for the latter was seen for UV irradiation in the presence of iodine. The results were rationalised by assigning a free radical mechanism for both plasma and photochemical film deposition which is inhibited by halogens. Films formed by irradiation at > 200 nm were found to have differing chemical compositions compared to those obtained in the vacuum ultraviolet (< 200 nm). This result was attributed to the differing photochemistries occurring in the two wavelength regions. Reference to the gas-phase photochemical literature enabled identification of the likely intermediates and term states involved, including 1, 1 and 1, 2 molecular elimination from ethylenic monomers in the vacuum UV to give the respective <b>ethynes,</b> together with secondary photolysis products. Consequently a mechanism for surface photopolymerisation was outlined which was compared with that proposed for plasma polymerisation, both of which involve vibrationally excited ground states for the monomers studied...|$|R

50|$|A {{series of}} ab initio studies of Si2H2 {{is an example}} of how ab initio {{computational}} chemistry can predict new structures that are subsequently confirmed by experiment. They go back over 20 years, and most of the main conclusions were reached by 1995. The methods used were mostly post-Hartree - Fock, particularly configuration interaction (CI) and coupled cluster (CC). Initially the question was whether disilyne, Si2H2 had the same structure as <b>ethyne</b> (acetylene), C2H2. In early studies, by Binkley and Lischka and Kohler, it became clear that linear Si2H2 was a transition structure between two equivalent trans-bent structures and that the ground state was predicted to be a four-membered ring bent in a 'butterfly' structure with hydrogen atoms bridged between the two silicon atoms. Interest then moved to look at whether structures equivalent to vinylidene (Si=SiH2) existed. This structure is predicted to be a local minimum, i. e. an isomer of Si2H2, lying higher in energy than the ground state but below the energy of the trans-bent isomer. Then a new isomer with an unusual structure was predicted by Brenda Colegrove in Henry F. Schaefer, III's group. It requires post-Hartree - Fock methods to obtain a local minimum for this structure. It does not exist on the Hartree - Fock energy hypersurface. The new isomer is a planar structure with one bridging hydrogen atom and one terminal hydrogen atom, cis to the bridging atom. Its energy is above the ground state but below that of the other isomers. Similar results were later obtained for Ge2H2.Al2H2 and Ga2H2 have exactly the same isomers, in spite of having two electrons less than the Group 14 molecules.The only difference is that the four-membered ring ground state is planar and not bent. The cis-mono-bridged and vinylidene-like isomers are present. Experimental work on these molecules is not easy, but matrix isolation spectroscopy of the products of the reaction of hydrogen atoms and silicon and aluminium surfaces has found the ground state ring structures and the cis-mono-bridged structures for Si2H2 and Al2H2. Theoretical predictions of the vibrational frequencies were crucial in understanding the experimental observations of the spectra of a mixture of compounds. This may appear to be an obscure area of chemistry, but the differences between carbon and silicon chemistry is always a lively question, as are the differences between group 13 and group 14 (mainly the B and C differences). The silicon and germanium compounds were the subject of a Journal of Chemical Education article.|$|E
