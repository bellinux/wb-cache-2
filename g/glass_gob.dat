5000|$|Experiments {{carried out}} by Ma et al. yield the {{following}} results:“The higher the temperature, the smaller the wetting angle between <b>glass</b> <b>gob</b> and substrate could be observed. This indicates that severe interface chemical reaction occurred and resulted {{in the loss of}} transparency in glass appearance. The wetting experiment in nitrogen ambient improved the sticking situation. The combination of chemically stable substrates and coatings, such as Sapphire (substrate) / GaN (film) and Glass (substrate) / Al2O3 (film) can achieve the best antistick propose. The precious metal films such as PtIr(Platinum, Iridium) coated on the ceramic substrates can effectively reduce the interface reaction between the glass and substrates.” ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{computer vision system}} for measuring the weight of <b>gobs</b> during a <b>glass</b> forming process, and a control strategy to correct automatically any weight deviation from a given set-point. During the formation of molten <b>glass</b> <b>gobs,</b> several noise sources can cause a deviation in the weight from a predefined reference value. Among them, there is a random white-noise disturbance caused {{by the lack of}} synchronisation of mechanical devices, the periodic disturbances due to changes in the spinning direction of the tube inside the feeder, and some long-term drifts caused by variations in temperature and viscosity of the raw <b>glass</b> material. The <b>gob</b> weight measurement system developed is based on a monochrome CCD high-resolution camera and photo-detector for synchronising the frame acquisition. The molten glass provides the illumination, so a high contrast image is obtained with a bright object and dark background. Several image-processing algorithms are presented for reliable area estimation. Assuming that the gob is a symmetric geometry of revolution and uniform mass density, the proposed system estimates the weight of gobs with accuracy better than ± 0. 75 %. A learning weight control strategy is proposed based on a PI-repetitive control scheme. The weight deviation from a set point is used as a control signal to adjust the glass flow into the feeder. This regulation scheme allows effective weight control, cancelling mid and long-term effects. The tracking error, ± 1. 5 %, means a reduction of 40 % when compared with a traditional PI controller...|$|R
40|$|The {{sticking}} {{behavior of}} various mold materials and coatings for hot glass melt forming processes, like, e. g. glass container manufacturing, was investigated {{using a new}} testing procedure. The mold material specimens under test were subjected to frequent contact with hot viscous <b>glass</b> <b>gobs</b> in a pressing process with presetting well defined non-isothermal pressing parameters to simulate industrial working conditions. Three different glass compositions were used in this investigation, soda-lime silicate glass, lead crystal glass, and borosilicate glass. The sticking characteristics of the tested mold materials and coatings were described by two quantities, a »dasia« lower »psila« and an »dasia« upper »psila« sticking temperature, which are specific for each mold material and type of glass in the non-isothermal pressing process. The »dasia« lower »psila« sticking temperatures of uncoated mold materials were found to depend monotonically on the thermal effusivity (heat penetration coefficient) of the bulk mold materials. All of the coating materials applied to various substrate mold materials were found to reduce the »dasia« lower »psila« sticking temperature {{as compared to the}} uncoated materials. Most of the coating materials were found to reduce also the »dasia« upper »psila« sticking temperature...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The glass {{molding process}} is {{considered}} {{to have a great}} potential for the mass production of aspherical glass lenses with high precision and low cost. However, glass molding has a serious problem of mold sticking with glass which needs to be resolved. This research investigates the interface reaction between glass and mold by high temperature wetting experiment, which provides the reference for the designing anti-stick coatings. The SUMITA K-PSK 200 optical glass gobs with low Tg were used in this study. The influence of operation temperature, ambient gas, substrate materials, and thin film composition on wettability of glass at high temperature were studied. The results show that the higher the temperature, the smaller the wetting angle between <b>glass</b> <b>gob</b> and substrate could be observed. This indicates that severe interface chemical reaction occured and resulted in the loss of transparency in glass appearance. The wetting experiment in nitrogen ambient improved the sticking situation. The combination of chemically stable substrates and coatings, suc...|$|E
40|$|Aspherical glass lenses are {{increasingly}} being used in consumer products like high power laser generators, digital cameras, projectors and scientific instruments. However, conventional manufacturing processes are not suitable for medium to high volume production of aspherical glass optical elements. Recently, compression molding {{has emerged as a}} promising alternative in which a <b>glass</b> <b>gob</b> or blank is pressed in a single operation into the shape of a finished lens. Annealing of the formed lens is required to achieve optical quality. The process is net shape, environment friendly and suitable for high volume production. Further implementation of this innovative process is hindered by technical challenges associated with curve conformance, tooling cost and mold life. This dissertation research seeks a fundamental understanding of the lens molding process by adopting a combined experimental, analytical and numerical Finite Element Method (FEM) approach. Preliminary experiments were performed involving molding of a test aspherical glass lens on a commercial lens molding machine to study process capability to manufacture an optic component within the desired specifications. Experiments were also performed to determine the effect of different molding parameter...|$|E
40|$|During a glass {{forming process}} in {{industrial}} glass manufacturing, a <b>glass</b> <b>gob</b> that comes {{directly from the}} furnace is forced into a desired shape. In general, practical experiments with glass forming are considerably expensive, whereas the majority has to be performed under complicated circumstances, e. g. high temperatures. In addition, the glass industry is fairly secretive about experimental data. Therefore, computer simulation models are required {{to gain a better}} understanding and improvement of glass forming processes. The glass forming process simulation models considered revolve around three coupled, principal physical problems. These are successively a flow problem for the motion of glass and air, an energy problem for the energy exchange in glass, air and equipment, and an interface problem for the location of the interfaces between glass and air. The boundary value problems are discretised by means of finite element methods and a suitable time discretisation scheme. Subsequently, an iterative solver with preconditioning is applied to solve the resulting systems of equations for each successive time step. Unfortunately, problems regarding the solver performance occur for flow problems in TNO Glas...|$|E
5000|$|The {{technology}} {{involved in}} this case concerned the manufacture of glass containers—notably, the [...] "gob feeder" [...] machinery for manufacturing jars, bottles, and other <b>glass</b> containers. The <b>gob</b> feed type of machine automatically makes glass containers by dropping a <b>gob</b> of molten <b>glass</b> through a hole into molds in a forming machine, {{the size and shape of}} the glass delivered being controlled by a mechanism known as a feeder machine; the feeder and the forming machine together constitute one fully automatic unit. At the time of the suit, Hartford-Empire Company owned or controlled all of the gob feeding patents in the glass container industry, and its business was the exploitation of these patents. Another type of machine is known as the [...] "suction" [...] machine, and it automatically sucks molten glass into a mold for blowing bottles.|$|R
