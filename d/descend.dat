5|$|According to Clan MacLeod tradition, Leod {{inherited}} {{some of his}} lands from {{a foster}} father, who was a sheriff of the Hebridean island of Skye; other lands he inherited from his father-in-law, {{who was also a}} lord on Skye.

Two of these sons founded the two main branches of MacLeods; branches which exist to this day—Tormod (from whom the MacLeods of Harris and Dunvegan <b>descend)</b> and Torquil (from whom the MacLeods of Lewis <b>descend).</b> The traditional belief that Torquil was a son has also been challenged; the current understanding is that he was a great-grandson of Leod.
