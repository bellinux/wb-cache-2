40|$|The {{amount of}} multidistrict {{litigation}} (MDL) {{in the federal}} courts is skyrocketing, particularly {{in the areas of}} mass torts and products liability. One significant reason for the explosion of MDL has been the difficulty of maintaining nationwide or multistate class actions in these areas, {{due in large part to}} the choice-of-law problems created by operation of many different states 2 ̆ 7 laws to plaintiffs 2 ̆ 7 claims. One comparative benefit of MDL is that individual cases within the consolidated pretrial proceedings retain their 2 ̆ 2 choice-of-law identity 2 ̆ 2 [...] that is, that transfer of a case into a pending MDL does not change the choice-of-law rules that would otherwise apply to a plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s case had it proceeded in its original home forum. In other words, the case carries the choice-of-law rules of the original forum state with it into the MDL. Because MDL is purportedly a consolidation only for pretrial proceedings, unlike a class action, the application of different choice-of-law rules to different plaintiffs 2 ̆ 7 claims does not render the MDL proceeding itself infeasible. This framework, however, is in disarray due to the advent and increasing popularity of a practice called 2 ̆ 2 <b>direct</b> <b>filing.</b> 2 ̆ 2 In <b>direct</b> <b>filing,</b> plaintiffs bypass the transfer process and file their cases directly into an MDL court. Amid the growing popularity of this practice, the question of what choice-of-law rules ought to apply to direct-filed cases has been left unaddressed. This paper seeks to expose and resolve the problem by permitting <b>direct</b> <b>filing,</b> but requiring plaintiffs to declare a proper home district whose choice-of-law rules would apply to their claims. Such an approach would both preserve the efficiency benefits of <b>direct</b> <b>filing,</b> and be consistent with the values of federalism and litigant autonomy underlying the choice-of-law framework in diversity cases...|$|R

50|$|SanDisk/Fusion-io's NVMFS file system, {{formerly}} known as <b>Direct</b> <b>File</b> System (DFS), accesses flash memory via a virtual flash storage layer instead of using the traditional block layer API. This file system has two main novel features. First, it lays out files directly in a very large virtual storage address space. Second, it leverages the virtual flash storage layer to perform block allocations and atomic updates. As a result, NVMFS performs better and is much simpler than a traditional Unix file system with similar functionalities. Additionally, this approach avoids the log-on-log performance issues triggered by log-structured file systems. Microbenchmark results show that NVMFS can deliver 94,000 I/O operations per second (IOPS) for direct reads and 71,000 IOPS for direct writes with the virtualized flash storage layer {{on top of a}} first-generation Fusion-io ioDrive. For direct access performance, NVMFS is consistently better than ext3 on the same platform, sometimes by 20%. For buffered access performance, NVMFS is also consistently better than ext3, and sometimes by over 149%. Application benchmarks show that NVMFS outperforms ext3 by 7% to 250% while requiring less CPU power. Additionally, I/O latency is lower with NVMFS compared to ext3.|$|E
