2500|$|Diagnosis is {{difficult}} as CSF culture is positive {{in less than}} half of cases, and therefore a large proportion of cases are treated on the basis of clinical suspicion alone. [...] PCR of CSF does not significantly improve the microbiology yield; culture remains the most sensitive method and a minimum of 5 ml (preferably 20 ml) of CSF should be sent for analysis. [...] TB cerebritis (or TB of the brain) may require brain biopsy {{in order to make the}} diagnosis, because the CSF is commonly normal: this is not always available and even when it is, some clinicians would debate whether it is justified putting a patient through such an invasive and potentially dangerous procedure when a trial of anti-TB therapy may yield the same answer; probably the only justification for brain biopsy is when <b>drug-resistant</b> <b>TB</b> is suspected.|$|E

In addition, it is mandatory to tackle the social determinants and socio-economic barriers favouring the MDR-TB, otherwise it will not be possible to reach the planned goals as well as TB Elimination...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Recently, {{resistance}} to additional first-line and injectable drugs {{was reported to}} be an independent risk factor for adverse outcomes in multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) patients. The aim {{of the present study was}} to confirm these observations in MDR-TB patients without HIV infection. MDR-TB patients treated at a tertiary referral hospital in South Korea between January 1996 and December 2005 were included. The unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios of adverse treatment outcome were calculated for {{resistance to}} each drug and combination of drugs using simple or multiple logistic regressions. None of the resistance to additional first-line or injectable drugs was associated with higher odds for adverse treatment outcome in 155 MDR but nonextensively <b>drug-resistant</b> (non-XDR) <b>TB</b> patients. However, streptomycin resistance was associated with 12 times the odds for adverse treatment outcome in 42 extensively <b>drug-resistant</b> (XDR) <b>TB</b> patients. Neither combinations of first-line drugs nor those of injectable drugs were associated with increased odds for adverse treatment outcomes in non-XDR MDR-TB patients or XDR-TB patients. Only streptomycin resistance among the first-line or injectable drugs was associated with adverse treatment outcomes in extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis patients without HIV infection...|$|R

50|$|TB was {{considered}} one of the most prevalent diseases, and did not have a cure until the discovery of Streptomycin by Selman Waksman in 1943. However, the bacteria soon developed resistance.
