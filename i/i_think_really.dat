500|$|In {{addition}} to writing her own lyrics, Hamasaki has also involved herself in {{other aspects of}} production such as artistic direction. Though Max Matsuura is officially credited as the producer of her records, he said of Hamasaki, [...] "Ayu is a very meticulous worker behind the scenes. A lot of the work she does by herself is more in the producer's arena. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>really</b> we should say 'Produced by yumi amasaki'." [...] Until her single [...] "M", however, Hamasaki left the task of composing to her staff; as she has explained, [...] "I'm not a professional; I lack even basic knowledge about writing music." [...] However, she started to compose her own melodies after her staff had failed to compose a tune for [...] "M" [...] that appealed to her. Wanting to produce works faithful to her visions, Hamasaki took control of most aspects of her artistry. I Am... is representative of this stage in Hamasaki's career; she directed the production of its songs, videos, and artwork. She began to compose less after I Am...: whereas nearly all of I Am... was her work, only nine of Rainbows fifteen tracks were composed by her. She was even less involved {{in the composition of}} subsequent albums, composing two tracks on Memorial Address, three on My Story, and one on (Miss)understood; since Secret, none of the songs on her studio albums have listed her as a composer. With later albums, Hamasaki also began to delegate to her staff tasks she had once handled herself. Hamasaki cites Madonna, soul musicians Babyface and En Vogue, and rock bands Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple as her influences and states that she admires Michelle Branch, Kid Rock, Joan Osborne, Seiko Matsuda, Rie Miyazawa, and Keiko Yamada; these diverse influences have led to the variety of her own music. Hamasaki began commissioning remixes of her songs early in her career, and this practice also influenced the diversity of her music. Found on many of her records, these remixes span different genres of electronic dance music including Eurobeat, house, and trance, as well as acoustic genres such as classical and traditional Chinese music. She has employed Western as well as Japanese musicians; among those she has worked with are Above & Beyond, the Lamoureux Orchestra of France, and traditional Chinese music ensemble Princess China Music Orchestra. Hamasaki has released more than a hundred original songs; through them, she has covered a wide range of musical styles, such as dance, metal, R, progressive rock, pop, and classical. She uses different instruments and techniques including piano, orchestra, gospel choirs, guitars, traditional Japanese strings, music boxes, and effects such as yells, claps, and scratching.|$|E

In {{an interview on}} 1985, Butler suggested that this trauma partly comes from attempts to forget America's dark past: [...] "I think most people don’t know or don’t realize that at least 10 million blacks were killed just {{on the way to}} this country, just during the middle passage....They don’t really want to hear it partly because it makes whites feel guilty." [...] In a later interview with Randall Kenan, Butler explained how debilitating this trauma has been for Americans, especially for African Americans, as symbolized by the loss of her protagonist’s left arm: [...] "I couldn’t really let [...] come all the way back. I couldn’t let her return to what she was, I couldn’t let her come back whole and , <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>really</b> symbolizes her not coming back whole.

[...] Félix da Costa stated he was returning to Macau because of its iconic status and still had knowledge of the track despite having not driven on the circuit in the last four years. When asked if he felt he could achieve the victory, he replied [...] "yes and no" [...] because of not having had experience in Formula Three cars for the previous three years, but said he would give it an attempt and would be pleased to secure a top-five finishing position. The track's fastest lap record holder Sérgio Sette Câmara said it was [...] "amazing" [...] to compete in the event, revealing that he would carry the experience he had from the previous year and was confident in his car's set-up.|$|E

60|$|Another {{group of}} very {{interesting}} {{fish out of}} water are the flying gurnards, common enough in the Mediterranean and the tropical Atlantic. They are much heavier and bigger creatures than the true flying fish of the herring type, being often {{a foot and a half}} long, and their wings are much larger in proportion, though not, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>really</b> so powerful as those of their pretty little silvery rivals. All the flying fish fly only of necessity, not from choice. They leave the water when pursued by their enemies, or when frightened by the rapid approach of a big steamer. So swiftly do they fly, however, that they can far outstrip a ship going at the rate of ten knots an hour; and I have often watched one keep ahead of a great Pacific liner under full steam for many minutes together in quick successive flights of three or four hundred feet each. Oddly enough, they can fly further against the wind than before it--a fact acknowledged even by the spectacled Germans themselves, and very hard indeed to reconcile with the orthodox belief that they are not flying at all, but only jumping. I don't know whether the flying gurnards are good eating or not; but the silvery flying fish are caught for market (sad desecration of the poetry of nature!) in the Windward Islands, and when nicely fried in egg and bread-crumb are really quite as good for practical purposes as smelts or whiting or any other prosaic European substitute.|$|E

6000|$|The Opera bustled {{off without}} any {{remarkable}} music, and, {{so far as}} I understand the language, no poetry; and except the coup d'œil, which was magnificent, it was poor work.

It had very little the air of a place of such resort, being kept in a garret above a coach-house. Here some twenty or thirty odd volumes were produced by an old woman, but nothing that was mercantile, so I left them for Lorenzo's learned friends.

6000|$|It is {{essential}} to emphasise this consciousness of the thing under discussion in connection {{with two or three}} words that are, as it were, the key-words of this war. One of them is the word [...] "barbarian." [...] The Prussians apply it to the Russians: the Russians apply it to the Prussians. Both, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>really</b> mean something that really exists, name or no name. Both mean different things. And if we ask what these different things are, we shall understand why England and France prefer Russia; and consider Prussia the really dangerous barbarian of the two. To begin with, it goes so much deeper even than atrocities; of which, in the past at least, all the three Empires of Central Europe have partaken pretty equally, as they partook of Poland. An English writer, seeking to avert the war by warnings against Russian influence, said that the flogged backs of Polish women stood between us and the Alliance. But not long before, the flogging of women by an Austrian general led to that officer being thrashed in the streets of London by Barclay and Perkins' draymen. And as for the third power, the Prussians, it seems clear that they have treated Belgian women in a style compared with which flogging might be called an official formality. But, as I say, something much deeper than any such recrimination lies behind {{the use of the word}} on either side. When the German Emperor complains of our allying ourselves with a barbaric and half-oriental power he is not (I assure you) shedding tears over the grave of Kosciusko. And when I say (as I do most heartily) that the German Emperor is a barbarian, I am not merely expressing any prejudices I may have against the profanation of churches or of children. My countrymen and I mean a certain and intelligible thing when we call the Prussians barbarians. It is quite different from the thing attributed to Russians; and it could not possibly be attributed to Russians. It is very important that the neutral world should understand what this thing is.|$|E
6000|$|I won't {{take time}} {{to tell you how}} touched I freshly am by the {{constancy}} with which you send me these wonderful books of yours--I am too impatient to let you know how wonderful I find the last. I bare my head before the immense ability of it--before the high intensity with which your talent keeps itself interesting and which has made me absorb the so full-bodied thing in deep and prolonged gustatory draughts. I am of my nature and by the effect of my own [...] "preoccupations" [...] a critical, a non-naïf, a questioning, worrying reader--and more than ever so at this end of time, when I jib altogether and utterly at the [...] "fiction of the day" [...] and find no company but yours and that, in a degree, of one or two others possible. To read a novel at all I perform afresh, to my sense, the act of writing it, that is of re-handling the subject according to my own lights and over-scoring the author's form and pressure with my own vision and understanding of the way--this, of course I mean, when I see a subject in what he has done and feel its appeal to me as one: which I fear I very often don't. This produces reflections and reserves--it's the very measure of my attention and my interest; but there's nobody who makes these particular reactions less matter for me than you do, as they occur--who makes the whole apple-cart so run away that I don't care if I don't upset it and only want to stand out of its path and see it go. This is because you have so positive a process and method of your own (rare and almost sole performer to this tune roundabout us--in fact absolutely sole by the force of your exhibition) that there's an anxious joy in seeing what it does for you and with you. I find you perverse and I find you, on a whole side, unconscious, as I can only call it, but my point is that with this heart-breaking leak even sometimes so nearly playing the devil with the boat your talent remains so savoury and what you do so substantial. I adore a rounded objectivity, a completely and patiently achieved one, and what I mean by your perversity and your leak is that your attachment to the autobiographic form for the kind of thing undertaken, the whole expression of actuality, [...] "up to date," [...] affects me as sacrificing what I hold most dear, a precious effect of perspective, indispensable, by my fond measure, to beauty and authenticity. Where there needn't so much be question of that, as in your hero's rich and roaring impressionism, his expression of his own experience, intensity and avidity as a whole, you are magnificent, there your ability prodigiously triumphs and I grovel before you. This is the way to take your book, I think--with Stratton's own picture (I mean of himself and his immediate world felt and seen with such exasperated and oh such simplified impatiences) as its subject exclusively. So taken it's admirably sustained, and the life and force and wit and humour, the imagination and arrogance and genius with which you keep it up, are tremendous and all your own. I think this projection of Stratton's rage of reflections and observations and world-visions is in its vividness and humour and general bigness of attack, a most masterly thing to have done. His South Africa etc. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>really</b> sublime, and I can do beautifully with him and his 'ideas' altogether--he is, and they are, an immense success. Where I find myself doubting is where I gather that you yourself see your subject more particularly--and where I rather feel it escape me. That is, to put it simply--for I didn't mean to draw this out so much, and it's 2 o'clock a.m.!--the hero's prodigiously clever, foreshortened, impressionising report of the heroine and the relation (which last is, I take it, for you, the subject) doesn't affect me as the real vessel of truth about them; in short, with all the beauty you have put into it--and much of it, especially at the last, is admirably beautiful--I don't care a fig for the hero's report as an account of the matter. You didn't mean a sentimental 'love story' I take it--you meant ever so much more--and your way strikes me as not the way to give the truth about the woman of our hour. I don't think you get her, or at any rate give her, and all through one hears your remarkable--your wonderful!--reporting manner and voice (up to last week, up to last night,) and not, by my persuasion, hers. In those letters she writes at the last it's for me all Stratton, all masculinity and intellectual superiority (of the most real,) all a more dazzling journalistic talent than I observe any woman anywhere (with all respect to the cleverness they exhibit) putting on record. It isn't in these terms of immediate--that is of her pretended own immediate irony and own comprehensive consciousness, that I see the woman made real at all; and by so much it is that I should be moved to take, as I say, such liberties of reconstruction. But I don't in the least want to take them, as I still more emphatically say--for what you have done has held me deliciously intent and made me feel anew with thanks to the great Author of all things what an invaluable form and inestimable art it is! Go on, go on and do it as you like, so long as you keep doing it; your faculty is of the highest price, your temper and your hand form one of the choicest treasures of the time; my effusive remarks are but the sign of my helpless subjection and impotent envy, and I am yours, my dear Wells, all gratefully and faithfully, ...|$|E
