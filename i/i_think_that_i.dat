500|$|The popular {{appeal of}} this simple poem is likely {{the source of}} its {{endurance}} despite the continuing negative opinion of the poem's merits from scholars and critics. [...] According to Robert Holliday, Kilmer's friend and editor, [...] "Trees" [...] speaks [...] "with authentic song to the simplest of hearts" [...] and that [...] "(t)he exquisite title poem now so universally known, made his reputation {{more than all the}} rest he had written put together. That impeccable lyric which made for immediate widespread popularity." [...] Its popularity has also led to parodies of the poem—some by noted poets and writers. [...] The pattern of its first lines (<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> shall never see / A poem lovely as a tree.) is of seemingly simple rhyme and meter and easy to mimic along with the poem's choice of metaphors. [...] One of the best known parodies is [...] "Song of the Open Road" [...] by American humorist and poet Ogden Nash (1902–1971): ...|$|E

Club {{suggested}} that the influence of Endtroducing..... {{may have had a}} negative effect on the album itself, saying that it [...] "has been partially diluted by the symphonic beat-collage culture it helped spawn." [...] The album's acclaim set considerably high standards for future releases by DJ Shadow, and he has expressed his dissatisfaction with being expected to [...] "repeat Endtroducing..... over and over again". Despite this, DJ Shadow {{has made it clear that}} he views the album in a positive light and denies any pressure that may have come about as a result of the album's praise: [...] "...people always seem to suggest that there's this pressure, and that Endtroducing..... is some kind of albatross, and I've just honestly never felt that way. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have a healthy enough respect for the lineage of the music and how rare it is that you can connect with an audience. If that will always be 'the record' then so be it, that's cool." [...] As of April 26, 2005, Endtroducing..... has sold upwards of 290,000 copies in the United States alone.|$|E

500|$|When Johnston {{was up for}} {{re-election}} in 1877, {{he was involved in}} the controversial Texas-Pacific Bill, a battle between Northern and Southern railroad interests. Johnston was opposed to Tom Scott's Texas and Pacific Railway, and the bill, which favored Scott's interests. Scott was trying to persuade Southern states to accept his railroad so that they would subsequently appoint senators who would vote for the bill. Johnston's seat was vulnerable if Scott succeeded in influencing the Virginia legislature, as it was known that he opposed the bill. As Johnston wrote in a letter, [...] "...what I have done about the Pacific road is before the people and I cannot recall it if I would. It would not be policy to retreat from my position nor am I inclined to do so, if was policy. I thought & <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was right & am therefore ready to take the consequences. I intend to fight it out on that line." [...] William Mahone worked to prevent his re-election. Most Southern states went along with Scott, but Virginia and Louisiana did not, and Johnston was re-elected.|$|E
500|$|... 2003 {{marked a}} {{significant}} {{turning point in}} Sarsgaard's career, when he starred in the feature film Shattered Glass. He depicted journalist Charles Lane, the lead editor of The New Republic. Shattered Glass {{is based on the}} real events of journalist Stephen Glass' career at The New Republic during the mid-1990s and his fall when his widespread journalistic fraud is exposed. During promotion of the film, Sarsgaard noted of his portrayal of Lane: [...] "I just wanted to get his perspective on the actual events. [...] <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> tried to have some respect for myself and that way you're respecting the real person you're playing. I've done it a number of times. And it's always a little bit confusing. The {{best thing to do is}} just to ignore the fact, I think, that you're playing somebody who is a real life character." [...] According to the San Diego Union-Tribune, [...] "Peter Sarsgaard is appealingly level, a stolid straight-shooter as Lane". A reviewer from the Chicago Tribune noted that Sarsgaard plays Lane with [...] "great subtlety and grace". The newspaper concluded with, [...] "The character doesn't seethe with personal resentment; when he does a slow burn, he conveys a much deeper sense of a man's value system being violated past the breaking point." [...] Sarsgaard's performance in the film earned him his first Golden Globe Award nomination and an Independent Spirit Award nomination.|$|E

They can write and record at any moment in time, they can get Ray Luzier in to play drums and I can take it {{for a week or two}} and write vocals or sing it. So it's as easy as them kind of recording everything, which is actually probably tough because they're constantly working with Scott on Stone Temple Pilot stuff. So the band is always there, you know what I mean, we're alive, we talk, Dean and I are constantly in communication. Ray Luzier, every time I see him he's like [...] "Man that Army of Anyone record is still, people still come up to me and talk about that Army of Anyone record".
