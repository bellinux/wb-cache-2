5|$|Arctic terns are {{long-lived}} birds, {{with many}} reaching fifteen to {{thirty years of}} age. They eat mainly fish and small marine invertebrates. The species <b>is</b> <b>abundant,</b> with an estimated one million individuals.

5|$|Carbon is {{the fourth}} most {{abundant}} chemical element in the universe by mass after hydrogen, helium, and oxygen. Carbon <b>is</b> <b>abundant</b> in the Sun, stars, comets, and in the atmospheres of most planets. Some meteorites contain microscopic diamonds that were formed when the solar system was still a protoplanetary disk. Microscopic diamonds may also be formed by the intense pressure and high temperature at the sites of meteorite impacts.|$|E

5|$|Palaces {{are usually}} {{arranged}} around {{one or more}} courtyards, with their façades facing inwards; some examples are adorned with sculpture. Some palaces possess associated hieroglyphic descriptions that identify them as the royal residences of named rulers. There <b>is</b> <b>abundant</b> evidence that palaces were far more than simple elite residences, and that a range of courtly activities took place in them, including audiences, formal receptions, and important rituals.|$|E
5|$|The Sawtooth Mountains {{were last}} {{extensively}} glaciated in the Pleistocene, but glaciers probably existed during the Little Ice Age, which ended around 1850AD. Evidence of past glaciation <b>is</b> <b>abundant</b> in the Sawtooth, White Cloud, Boulder, and Smoky mountains, {{as well as}} the north and east-facing slopes of the Albion, Raft River, and Soldier mountains. Remnants of the glaciers include glacial lakes, moraines, horns, hanging valleys, cirques, and arêtes.|$|E

5|$|Ditton is {{situated}} between the Lower Weald and the Chalk (North) Downs. The parish encompasses the Lower Greensand strata, where a formation of hard sandy limestone {{known as the}} Hythe Beds <b>is</b> <b>abundant.</b> From this formation ragstone is obtained. Kentish ragstone was a historically important building material in south east England. The Romans used ragstone {{in the construction of}} London and villas in the south-east. Medieval builders used ragstone to build churches, civic buildings, houses and bridges over local rivers. The predominance of ragstone beds in the locality gave Ditton a legacy of quarrying which continues today.|$|E
5|$|Food {{items include}} snails, worms, small crustaceans, flies and beetles. The {{proportions}} of each prey species vary with season and locality. Amphipod larvae {{are important in}} Ireland and Scotland, crustaceans in Norway, and the mollusc Assiminea grayana in the Netherlands. Small fish are occasionally eaten, and in hard weather pipits may scavenge for other food, including human food litter. There is little competition from other species for food, since rocky beach specialists like the purple sandpiper take slightly larger food items, and may wade in deeper water. When food <b>is</b> <b>abundant,</b> meadow pipits may also feed on the shore, but are driven away by the Eurasian rock pipits when there is less prey available.|$|E
5|$|In {{the great}} {{majority}} of cells, smooth ER regions are scarce and are often partly smooth and partly rough. They are sometimes called transitional ER because they contain ER exit sites from which transport vesicles carrying newly synthesized proteins and lipids bud off for transport to the Golgi apparatus. In certain specialized cells, however, the smooth ER <b>is</b> <b>abundant</b> and has additional functions. The smooth ER of these specialized cells functions in diverse metabolic processes, including synthesis of lipids, metabolism of carbohydrates, and detoxification of drugs and poisons.|$|E

5|$|Macroolithus rugustus <b>is</b> <b>abundant</b> in the Nemegt Formation, {{which dates}} to the late Campanian to early Maastrichtian. This {{formation}} represents depositions of a meandering river. Well-preserved dinosaur remains are common in the Nemegt Formation, including oviraptorosaurs, titanosaurs, troodontids, tyrannosaurs, ankylosaurs, pachycephalosaurs, hadrosaurs, ornithomimosaurs, alvarezsaurs, and therizinosaurs. Remains of small animals are relatively rare, but several types of birds are known from Nemegt, {{as well as several}} types of multituberculate mammals. Other fossil eggs from the Nemegt Formation include Ovaloolithus, Spheroolithus, Elongatoolithus, and Laevisoolithus.|$|E
5|$|Most {{grasshoppers}} are polyphagous, eating vegetation {{from multiple}} plant sources, {{but some are}} omnivorous and also eat animal tissue and animal faeces. In general their preference is for grasses, including many cereals grown as crops. The digestive system is typical of insects, with Malpighian tubules discharging into the midgut. Carbohydrates are digested mainly in the crop, while proteins are digested in the ceca of the midgut. Saliva <b>is</b> <b>abundant</b> but largely free of enzymes, helping to move food and Malpighian secretions along the gut. Some grasshoppers possess cellulase, which by softening plant cell walls makes plant cell contents accessible to other digestive enzymes.|$|E
5|$|Neon <b>is</b> <b>abundant</b> on a {{universal}} scale; {{it is the}} fifth most abundant chemical element in the universe by mass, after hydrogen, helium, oxygen, and carbon (see chemical element). Its relative rarity on Earth, like that of helium, is due to its relative lightness, high vapor pressure at very low temperatures, and chemical inertness, all properties which tend {{to keep it from}} being trapped in the condensing gas and dust clouds that formed the smaller and warmer solid planets like Earth.|$|E

5|$|Ranging {{behavior}} can also exhibit seasonal variability. During the hot, wet season, females range widely, either {{alone or in}} groups of up to six individuals. In the cool, dry season, smaller core groups stabilize in order to occupy concentrated areas. Therefore, during seasons when fruit <b>is</b> <b>abundant,</b> subgroups are larger while scarcity is met with more solitary behavior. This suggests that although their feeding ecology is inflexible, being tied to widely distributed, patchy, and sometimes scarce fruit, ruffed lemurs instead adapt the social system in order to survive.|$|E
5|$|Several Omphalotus {{species with}} similar bioluminescent {{properties}} occur worldwide, {{all of which}} are presumed poisonous. The best known are the North American jack o'lantern mushroom (O.olearius) and the tsukiyotake (O.japonicus (Kawam.) Kirchm. & O.K. Mill. (formerly known as Lampteromyces japonicus (Kawam.) Sing.), found in Japan and eastern Asia. A 2004 molecular study shows the ghost fungus to be most closely related to the western jack o'lantern mushroom (O.olivascens), which <b>is</b> <b>abundant</b> in Southern and Central California. Miller notes that the colours and shades of the ghost fungus most closely resemble this species.|$|E
5|$|Since 1996, the Natal {{red rock}} hare has been rated {{as a species}} ofleast concernon theIUCN Red Listof Endangered Species.
