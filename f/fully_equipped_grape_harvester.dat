40|$|This study {{presents}} the results of research carried out on a Sicilian wine farm in order to demonstrate the economic convenience of the mechanized harvest. After the determination of the minimum optimal farm size that justifies the introduction of <b>grape</b> <b>harvester</b> in the farm, it has been estimated production cost and the relative profitability of two wine grape cultivars (Chardonnay and Nero d’Avola), comparing three hypotheses of harvest: manual, with farm property <b>grape</b> <b>harvester</b> and with rented <b>grape</b> <b>harvester.</b> The economic analysis shows that the introduction of the <b>grape</b> <b>harvester</b> in the wine farm is justified in large sized farms. However, even in small farms the use of rented <b>grape</b> <b>harvester</b> decreases the harvest costs, increasing profit and achieving a cost advantage for the wine-producer farm...|$|R
50|$|Braud {{was founded}} in 1870 in St Mars La Jaille in France; at the time Braud was {{manufacturing}} threshing machines. In 1908 Braud produced the first power-driven thresher and in 1927 the first thresher made completely with metal.Braud acquired a strong position in the French combine harvester market, reaching 1.600 units sold in 1968; in the European crisis of the ’70 Braud lost 45% and focused production on <b>grape</b> <b>harvesters.</b> In 1975 Braud produced its first <b>grape</b> <b>harvester,</b> model 1020; {{this was followed by}} 1040, the best selling <b>grape</b> <b>harvester</b> with over 2000 units sold in 4 years.Braud soon became the leader in self-propelled <b>grape</b> <b>harvester,</b> with 60% of market share in France and 50% worldwide. In 1983 Braud produced 670 grape harvesters.In 1984 Fiatagri acquired 75% of Braud.|$|R

40|$|Harvester bin dynamic {{weighing}} systems {{are affected by}} a number of sources of variation such as field slopes and load displacement. In <b>grape</b> <b>harvesters,</b> the nature of the material (wine grapes and wine grape juice) and its relative composition can vary significantly. Laboratory tests were carried out using hydrogel spheres and water to simulate field dynamic conditions during harvest. This paper quantifies the sources of variation, submitting an instrumented <b>grape</b> <b>harvester</b> to graduated inclination under shaking conditions. Load displacement is characterized using image analysis from recorded movies on four different pitch axis motions of the machine: front to horizontal, horizontal to rear, rear to horizontal and horizontal to front.

40|$|Dynamic {{weighing}} systems based on load cells {{are commonly used}} to estimate crop yields in the field. There is lack of data, however, regarding the accuracy of such {{weighing systems}} mounted on harvesting machinery, especially on that used to collect high value crops such as fruits and vegetables. Certainly, dynamic weighing systems mounted on the bins of <b>grape</b> <b>harvesters</b> {{are affected by the}} displacement of the load inside the bin when moving over terrain of changing topography. In this work, the load that would be registered in a <b>grape</b> <b>harvester</b> bin by a dynamic weighing system based on the use of a load cell was inferred by using the discrete element method (DEM). DEM is a numerical technique capable of accurately describing the behaviour of granular materials under dynamic situations and it has been proven to provide successful predictions in many different scenarios. In this work, different DEM models of a <b>grape</b> <b>harvester</b> bin were developed contemplating different influencing factors. Results obtained from these models were used to infer the output given by the load cell of a real bin. The mass detected by the load cell when the bin was inclined depended strongly on the distribution of the load within the bin, but was underestimated in all scenarios. The distribution of the load was found to be dependent on the inclination of the bin caused by the topography of the terrain, but also by the history of inclination (inclination rate, presence of static periods, etc.) since the effect of the inertia of the particles (i. e., representing the grapes) was not negligible. Some recommendations are given to try to improve the accuracy of crop load measurement in the field...|$|R
