5|$|An {{isolated}} {{population in}} Crimea <b>has</b> <b>sometimes</b> been separated as T. v. tauricus, {{but this is}} not considered to be a valid form. Mistle thrush fossils have been found in Pleistocene deposits from Poland and Sicily.|$|E
5|$|Art <b>has</b> <b>sometimes</b> {{stimulated the}} {{development}} of mathematics, as when Brunelleschi's theory of perspective in architecture and painting started a cycle of research {{that led to the}} work of Brook Taylor and Johann Heinrich Lambert on the mathematical foundations of perspective drawing, and ultimately to the mathematics of projective geometry of Girard Desargues and Jean-Victor Poncelet.|$|E

5|$|Because LARP {{involves}} a controlled artificial environment within which people interact, it <b>has</b> <b>sometimes</b> {{been used as}} a research tool to test theories in social fields such as economics or law. For example, LARP has been used to study the application of game theory to the development of criminal law.|$|E
5|$|Brideshead Revisited (1981), {{based on}} Waugh's novel; a miniseries {{enormously}} popular in Britain and America, the film <b>has</b> <b>sometimes</b> {{been seen as}} drawing unwanted attention to Oxford's stereotypical reputation as a playground for the upper class. It stars Jeremy Irons and most college shots are of Christ Church and Hertford.|$|E
5|$|Bromine <b>has</b> <b>sometimes</b> been {{considered}} to be possibly essential in humans, but this is supported by only limited circumstantial evidence, and no clear biological role. As a pharmaceutical, the simple bromide ion (Brâˆ’) has inhibitory effects on the central nervous system, and bromide salts were once a major medical sedative, before replacement by shorter-acting drugs. They retain niche uses as antiepileptics.|$|E

5|$|Congress <b>has</b> <b>sometimes</b> {{gotten around}} the Tenth Amendment by invoking the Commerce Clause in Article One or by {{threatening}} to withhold funding for a federal program from noncooperative States, as in South Dakota v. Dole (1987).|$|E
5|$|Hard rock <b>has</b> <b>sometimes</b> been {{labelled}} cock {{rock for}} {{its emphasis on}} overt masculinity and sexuality and because it has historically been predominantly performed and consumed by men: {{in the case of}} its audience, particularly white, working-class adolescents.|$|E
5|$|The {{brown creeper}} <b>has</b> <b>sometimes</b> been {{considered}} to be a subspecies of Eurasian treecreeper, but has closer affinities to short-toed treecreeper, and is normally now treated as a full species. Hodgson's treecreeper is a more recent proposed split following studies of its cytochrome b mtDNA sequence and song structure that indicate that it may well be a distinct species from C. familiaris.|$|E

5|$|The exact {{parentage}} of Domentziolus is unclear: Phocas had two known brothers, Comentiolus {{and another}} also named Domentziolus, who <b>has</b> <b>sometimes</b> been suggested as the younger Domentziolus's father. Shortly after the accession of Phocas, in 603, the younger Domentziolus {{was raised to}} the titles of vir gloriosissimus, patricius and curopalates.|$|E
5|$|The {{researches}} of John Harvey {{have uncovered}} {{the names of}} many English medieval architects, and by tracing stylistic characteristics, it <b>has</b> <b>sometimes</b> proved possible to track their careers from one building to another. Leading architects were highly paid - especially those employed in the King's works - and they can often be identified from regular payments in cathedral accounts.|$|E
5|$|The term fluffernutter <b>has</b> <b>sometimes</b> {{been used}} disparagingly to {{describe}} something that lacks substance and has minimal to no cultural value. On the other hand, some writers look on Fluffernutters and marshmallow fluff {{as a source}} of childhood nostalgia and regional pride.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{his entire}} tenure in Congress, Paul has {{represented}} his district {{as a member}} of the Republican Party. However, he has frequently taken positions in direct opposition to the other members and the leadership of the party, and he <b>has</b> <b>sometimes</b> publicly questioned whether he really belonged in the party.|$|E
5|$|A typical McKinsey {{engagement}} {{can last}} {{between two and}} twelve months and involves three to six McKinsey consultants. An engagement is usually managed by a generalist that covers the region the client's headquarters are located in and specialists that have either an industry or functional expertise. Unlike some competing consulting firms, McKinsey does not hold a policy against working for multiple competing companies (although individual consultants are barred from doing so). This <b>has</b> <b>sometimes</b> led to accusations of sharing confidential information or re-packaging a competitor's tactics as best practices.|$|E
5|$|Although {{this bird}} eats rice on the {{wintering}} grounds, {{where it can}} make up nearly 40% of its diet, it takes mainly waste and residues from cropping and threshing, not harvestable grain. It <b>has</b> <b>sometimes</b> been viewed as a pest, but the deeper water and presence of invertebrate prey in the economically important early winter period means that the wader has little effect on crop yield.|$|E

5|$|Charles XI <b>has</b> <b>sometimes</b> been {{described}} in Sweden as {{the greatest of all}} the Swedish kings, except for Gustavus II Adolphus, unduly eclipsed by his father and his son. In {{the first half of the}} 20th century, the view of him changed and he was regarded as dependent, uncertain, and easily influenced by others. In the most recent book, Rystads biography from 2003, the king is again characterized as a strong-willed shaper of Sweden through economic reforms and achievement of financial and military stability and strength.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his large}} number of works on Christian themes, Britten <b>has</b> <b>sometimes</b> been thought of as agnostic. Pears said that when they met in 1937 {{he was not sure}} whether or not Britten would have {{described}} himself as a Christian. In the 1960s Britten called himself a dedicated Christian, though sympathetic to the radical views propounded by the Bishop of Woolwich in Honest to God. Politically, Britten was on the left. He told Pears that he always voted either Liberal or Labour and could not imagine ever voting Conservative, but he was never a member of any party, except the Peace Pledge Union.|$|E
5|$|During the Suez Crisis of 1956, future Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson eased {{tensions}} {{by proposing}} {{the inception of}} the United Nations Peacekeeping Force, for which he was awarded the 1957 Nobel Peace Prize. As this was the first UN peacekeeping mission, Pearson is often credited as the inventor of the concept. Canada has since served in over 50 peacekeeping missions, including every UN peacekeeping effort until 1989, and has since maintained forces in international missions in Rwanda, the former Yugoslavia, and elsewhere; Canada <b>has</b> <b>sometimes</b> faced controversy over its involvement in foreign countries, notably in the 1993 Somalia Affair.|$|E
