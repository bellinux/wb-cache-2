How to Measure Migrations of Health Workers Between Public and NGO Care Providers on a Cross-Country Basis William R. Palmquist Chair of the Supervisory Committee: Professor Matthew Sparke Department of Geography This thesis {{reviews the}} {{question}} of whether the health services provided by Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) lead to <b>internal</b> brain <b>drains</b> of health workers out of public health systems, within individual countries. Studies that measure <b>internal</b> brain <b>drains</b> are reviewed in migration and public / global health literatures. Methods for measuring <b>internal</b> brain <b>drains</b> of health workers from public providers are considered, along with models to establish causal links between the recruitment of skilled workers by NGOs, and public sector employment levels. Existing secondary datasets are analyzed to reveal the absence of indicators that measure this study’s key variables. The lack of proxies for variables of interest makes it impossible to determine whether <b>internal</b> brain <b>drain</b> processes are occurring on a cross-country basis, without collecting primary data. Looking beyond present constraints, this thesis considers alternative ways to measure <b>internal</b> brain <b>drains,</b> as well as directions for future research.

In contract o circuit-evel models, the so-called <b>internal</b> <b>drain</b> voltage is solved analytically in terms of the terminal voltages. The resulting compact model thus combines the benefits of short comutation times and robustness of explicitly formulated models with accuracy.

40|$|In this paper, {{a surface}} potential-based compact model is {{described}} for high-voltage LDMOS transistors. This model combines the low-voltage MOS region with the high-voltage drift region of an LDMOS transistor. The model includes {{the effect of}} the gate extending over the drift region as well as its temperature behavior and geometry scaling. In contrast to subcircuit models, the model has no internal node, since the so-called <b>internal</b> <b>drain</b> voltage is explicitly expressed in terms of the external terminal voltages. By use of an explicit formulation of the surface potential, the dc model thus combines the benefits of short computation times and robustness with accuracy. A comparison with dc measurements shows that the dc model provides an accurate description in all regimes of operation, ranging from subthreshold to super-threshold. In addition, a nodal charge model is derived, to account for the time-dependent behavior of the device. Capacitances obtained from high-frequency measurements show a good agreement with those obtained from the nodal charge model. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, the biggest gold outflow in a generation posed a doublebarreled threat to American finance: An <b>internal</b> <b>drain</b> of currency from the banking system and an external drain of gold to Europe. The Federal Reserve System, newly authorized by Congress on December 23, 1913, remained on the sidelines {{during the summer of}} 1914, a victim of political and administrative delays. The absence of an operational central bank encouraged Treasury Secretary William G. McAdoo to improvise the modern principle of aiming an independent weapon at each policy target. He employed a form of capital controls to deal with the external threat, shutting the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) for more than four months to prevent Europeans from selling their American securities and demanding gold in return. And he invoked the emergency currency provisions of the Aldrich-Vreeland Act to deal with the internal threat, allowing banks to issue national bank notes, an important form of currency in pre-Federal Reserve days, without the normal requirement that the currency be secured by U.

40|$|Bias {{circuits}} often {{affect the}} instantaneous bandwidth (the bandwidth {{of the signal}} that is taken through the PA at a given time) over which a pre-distorter can linearize the transmitter’s output signal. The resulting nonlinearity is difficult to remove completely even by most advanced pre- distortion techniques. In order {{to keep up with}} the increasing data rates in telecom industry, there is a desire to increase the mentioned bandwidth. This thesis describes clearly the effects of bias circuit which causes the baseband currents to generate significant variations in the baseband voltages at the transistor terminals. This paper proposes internal decoupling (large capacitance inside the drain package of the transistor) to lessen baseband resonance problem by moving the resonance to much lower frequency with a weaken amplitude. It also proposes the use of snubber circuit to attenuate the weak resonance. Two models of packaged RF power transistor were available. These were identical except that one had <b>internal</b> <b>drain</b> baseband decoupling and the other not. Both were internally pre-matched Si LDMOS transistors designed mainly for class AB operation in the 1. 8 GHz band. The transistor with internal decoupling seems to alleviate the baseband impedance variation problem thus making it easier to pre-distort. Simulation result gave a baseband impedance of 0. 3 Ω at 11 MHz and 11 Ω at 194 MHz for the transistor with internal decoupling and for the standard transistor respectively. The measurement results gave 2 Ω(manufacturers measured with un-optimized board and it was 16 Ω) at 242 MHz and 4 Ω at 164 MHz again for the transistor with internal decoupling and for the standard transistor respectively. For RF performance, both transistors were designed for best efficiency and gave 58 % for the transistor with internal decoupling and 55 % for the standard transistor.

40|$|To {{enhance the}} {{drivability}} and increase safety {{a major part}} of Scania’svehicles is fitted with a retarder. The retarder is a complementary brake system that assists the vehicles mechanical brakes. When running a retarder some oil leakage can occur. The main source to the leakage is oil sump ventilation but there is also some contribution from the solenoid valve block that controls the retarder. Test results from the test rig shows that with rather simple methods the oil leakage in form of oil mist can be captured. The efficiency of for instance concept 1 with half the volume and a chicane interior was as high as 99 to 100 %. For the concept 2 with the expanded metal filter the efficiency was in the order of 96 to 100 %. From testing it has also become clear {{that there is a problem}} to feed the oil back into the oil sump. Initial tests shows that the retarder is rather sensitive regarding the placing of the feedback channel. It is considered that the best option is to only use the feedback channel that enters the <b>internal</b> <b>drain</b> of the retarder. Measurements show that the airflow in the tube from the accumulator could reach velocities up to 67 m/s. It is considered that the best solution is to have two separate chambers, one for the accumulator and one for the oil sump ventilation, the safety valve and the proportion valve. The reason for this is that the combination of oil in a chamber together with high airflow from the accumulator is disastrous and the retarder leaks far worse compared to original. The conclusion is therefore that it is important to separate air from the accumulator from places where oil can occur. Tests also revealed that the size of an external volume is not of any great importance when it comes to colleting oil. There was no significant difference in between of using a volume of 0. 64 l or 0. 19 l. However regarding overfilling it is favorable to have a larger volume since this increases the retarder’s capability to withstand oil leakage when it is overfilled...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Dutch {{municipalities}} have a {{legal duty}} in groundwater management. Adequate and effective management of horizontal subsurface drainage systems is important in fulfilling this duty. The service life time of these systems have to be optimized. Financial resources should be used efficiently. Only since a few years there is a proactive attitude towards management and maintenance of subsurface drainage systems. There is still little experience on how to manage and maintain urban subsurface drainage systems. Current knowledge on system behavior, failure mechanisms and effectiveness of maintenance is mainly based on research to field drainage in agricultural context. More fundamental knowledge on these topics is {{required in order to}} assess which maintenance and monitoring efforts are suitable for adequate system management. Approach My research focused on municipally managed, horizontal subsurface drainage systems (mainly installed in the sewer trench). System failure processes, possible locations of system failure, effectiveness of maintenance by jet-flushing and required monitoring and inspection efforts are studied. The knowledge is gained by execution of a detailed case study to two different system types located in the municipality of Utrecht. A predominantly submerged and a predominantly dry system. Past system state inspection and system behavior monitoring data are studied. Time series are analyzed with time series analyses tool Menyanthes. In the context of this research project, an extensive system behavior monitoring campaign is executed in the case systems. Furthermore, several inspection techniques including CCTV camera inspection are applied Results - Knowledge on failure mechanisms. The major failure mechanism observed in the case systems was the formation of ochre. Ochre contamination, a dynamic process, can lead to major problems with high groundwater tables. - Insight in location of failure. Results from this research show that besides problems in the drain-soil interface focused on in literature, internal network clogging can also be a major driver for system failure. - Insight in effectiveness of maintenance by jet-flushing. Jet-flushing appeared to be primary effective in removal of ochre blockages from the <b>internal</b> <b>drain</b> cross-sections. Time-scale of re-clogging is however short. Within several months, the effect can be negated. - A possible approach in system investigation and assessment. Based on the obtained experience in inspecting and monitoring the case systems, an approach in system investigation and assessment is developed. The approach is presented in a decision tree-like scheme. The scheme can be used {{for the development of a}} management and maintenance plan for a particular system. Recommendation for future research This research can be considered as initiating research. New questions arose during the research. Permanently submerged (modern) subsurface drainage systems are not yet studied in detail. Some processes are not fully understood yet. Further research is therefore recommended.

There was a clear understanding that the outfalls were too high to allow proper drainage by gravity, and two possible solutions were considered.

40|$|Abstract: The {{history of}} {{alluvial}} fan and terrace formation within {{a stretch of}} the Ouarzazate basin along the southern margin of the Central High Atlas is reconstructed using geomorphological and 10 Be terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide (TCN) methods. Alluvial fan and terrace incision was controlled partially by a drop in base level during the Pliocene or early Pleistocene as the outlet channel, the Draa river, progressively cut through the Anti-Atlas {{to the south of}} the Ouarzazate foreland basin, the drainage of which started to become external after a long period of <b>internal</b> <b>drained</b> conditions. The alluvial fans and terrace surfaces have abandonment ages that date to at least the past four glacial cycles. Their formation was strongly modulated by climate on glacial–interglacial time scales as base level dropped. This demonstrates a strong climatic control on sediment transfer and landscape denudation during the Quaternary and provides a model for understanding sediment transfer in other intracontinental mountain belts. Furthermore, these data show that mean rates of fluvial incision in this region range between 0. 3 and 1. 0 mm a 1 for {{the latter part of the}} Quaternary.

25|$|Some work {{continued}} until 1775, consisting largely of raising river banks, making drains deeper, and extending the drains {{that had been}} created. However, the system was inadequate, as there were large areas that remained under water near Leven, {{in the north of}} the area, and at Weel, to the east of Beverley. Flooding during the winter months was still a regular problem, because the drains could not cope with rain from the low-lying carrs, when they were full with water from higher ground to the north of Holderness. The engineer William Jessop spent a month investigating the problems, studying some , and presented a report in July 1786. Further survey work was then carried out by George Plummer, and formed the basis for Jessop's detailed plan, which was agreed in 1787. He produced specifications for drains, embankments, dams and tunnels, with the overriding principle that the water from the uplands to the north should be kept entirely separate from the <b>internal</b> <b>drains</b> of the area.
