40|$|Purpose: This paper {{presents}} the mechanical and metallurgical characteristics of laser weldments for automotive steels with high strength ranging from 370 MPa to 1500 MPa. Design/methodology/approach: Butt <b>joint</b> <b>welding</b> {{was conducted on}} high strength steel sheets by using a CO 2 laser with 6 kW output power. For sound welds with full penetration, the proper welding conditions were chosen and the cross-sectional bead shape, tensile strength, hardness profile and micro-structure were evaluated for each case. Findings: Laser welding {{is known to be}} a low heat input process because of its high heat density and welding speed. But for laser welding of ultra high strength steel with strength over 780 MPa, micro-structural softening was observed in the HAZ (heat affected zone), resulting from dissolved martensite. Practical implications: The tensile strength reduction in laser welding of ultra high strength steed should be considered in the design of car body structures. The HAZ softening that occurs in butt <b>joint</b> <b>welding</b> can reduce the tensile shear strength for overlap joint welds, which are predominantly mostly used in the BIW (body-in-white) structure.
