40|$|Ethnopharmacological relevance: Equisetum giganteum L and Copaifera {{reticulate}} Ducke {{have been}} traditionally used by {{women of the}} Tacana tribe in the Bolivian Amazonas for genital hygiene and for treatment of genital infection/inflammation. Aim of the study: To assess the ability of <b>extracts</b> <b>from</b> <b>Equisetum</b> giganteum L and Copaifera reticulate Ducke to block genital viral infection by herpes simplex virus type 2. Materials and Methods: Equisetum giganteum L and Copaifera reticulate Ducke were collected from the Amazon region of La Paz, Bolivia. Extracts were prepared and screened for anti-viral activity against herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV- 2) using both in vitro and in in vivo models of infection. Results: Equisetum giganteum L and Copaifera reticulate Ducke efficiently blocked HSV- 2 infection of cell cultures without major cell cytotoxic effects. Extracts of Equisetum giganteum L and Copaifera reticulate Ducke could prevent HSV- 2 disease development when administered together with virus in a mouse model of genital HSV- 2 infection. In vitro analyses revealed that both plant extracts exerted their anti-HSV- 2 effects by interfering with viral cell attachment and entry, but could not block viral replication post entry. Conclusions: These studies show that extracts of Equisetum giganteum L and Copaifera reticulate Ducke have potent antiviral activities against HSV- 2 comparable to those two previously identified plants, Croton lechleri Mull. Arg. and Uncaria tomentosa (Willd. ex Schult.) DC. These studies confirm that plants used by the Tacana tribe could be explored further {{for the development of}} novel topical antiviral microbicides...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to verify if chronic {{administration}} of the hydroalcoholic <b>extract</b> of stems <b>from</b> <b>Equisetum</b> arvense (HAE) reverses the cognitive impairment in aged rats, as well as, evaluates it in vitro antioxidant properties. Chronic administration of HAE at dose of 50 mg/kg, i. p., improved both short- and long-term retention of inhibitory avoidance task and ameliorated the cognitive performance in reference and working memory version of the Morris Water Maze. No {{differences were found between}} all three groups of young controls, aged controls and EHA-treated animals with regard to the open field and elevated plus maze tests. Indeed, no toxicity manifestations were observed during treatment. in vitro assays revealed that HAE diminished the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances as well as nitrite formation, but did not alter catalase activity. Thus, the cognitive enhancement effects of the HAE may be attributed, at least in part, to it antioxidant action. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

40|$|Styrylpyrone synthase was {{detected}} in cell free <b>extracts</b> <b>from</b> gametophytes of <b>Equisetum</b> arvense. This new enzyme catalyses {{the formation of}} styrylpyrones from malonyl-CoA and hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA precursors. A standard enzyme assay was established. The enzyme activity was characterized in partially purified protein extracts. p-Coumaroyl-CoA was accepted as substrate at pH 6. 0 - 8. 5 in various buffer systems {{with the formation of}} bisnoryangonin, and optimum enzyme activity was observed in potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7. 5. Caffeoyl-CoA was accepted as substrate only in potassium phosphate buffer at pH 6. 0 - 7. 5 with formation of hispidin; optimum enzymeactivity was observed at pH 7. 0. The apparent K(m) values were 220 mu m for caffeoyl-CoA and 230 mu m for p-coumaroyl-CoA. The temperature optimum of the enzyme activity was 37 degree for bisnoryangonin and 30 degree for hispidin formation. Molecular weight determination by FPLC indicated that this protein has a native molecular weight of ca 56 - 77 kDa. Styrylpyrones accumulate in rhizomes of sporophytes and gametophytes of E. arvense as major constitutive metabolites. In these organs no flavonoids could be detected. In green sprouts, styrylpyrone accumulation is only detected as a local response to mechanical wounding or microbial attack, and flavonoids are accumulated as major polyketide metabolites. Thus, chalcone synthase is active in the sporophytes and might have developed in the course of evolution from styrylpyrone synthase present in the more primitive gametophytes...|$|R

40|$|Silica is {{the second}} most {{abundant}} biomineral being exceeded in nature only by biogenic CaCO 3. Many land plants (such as rice, cereals, cucumber, etc.) deposit silica in significant amounts to reinforce their tissues and as a systematic response to pathogen attack. One of the most ancient species of living vascular plants, Equisetum arvense is also able to take up and accumulate silica {{in all parts of the}} plant. Numerous methods have been developed for elimination of the organic material and/or metal ions present in plant material to isolate biogenic silica.
