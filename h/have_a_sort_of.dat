500|$|Shackleton's February 1907 {{announcement}} {{that he intended}} to base his expedition at the old Discovery headquarters was noted by Scott, whose own future Antarctic plans were at that stage unannounced. In a letter to Shackleton, Scott claimed priority rights to McMurdo Sound. [...] "I feel I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> right to my own field of work," [...] he wrote, adding: [...] "anyone who has had to do with exploration will regard this region primarily as mine". He concluded by reminding Shackleton of his duty of loyalty towards his former commander.|$|E
500|$|At Mulhouse, Wenger was {{managed by}} Paul Frantz, {{who also had}} a {{profound}} impact on his career. It was he who formalised Wenger's beliefs on the importance of nutrition, isometrics and working on a player's strong points. Wenger played in midfield for Mulhouse, often positioned on the right. In their final game of the 1974–75 season, the club beat AS Nancy to avoid relegation, but shortly afterwards, Frantz resigned. Wenger also made the decision to leave, as the regular commutes to Mulhouse from Strasbourg overwhelmed him. In 1975, he rekindled his friendship with Hild and signed for amateur club ASPV Strasbourg (Vauban). Hild needed a midfielder [...] "who could organise play and also <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> hold over the team" [...] and decided to recruit Wenger. Vauban was formed in 1971 and made steady progress up the French football league system thereafter; Wenger's three seasons at the club culminated with promotion to the third division.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with MistaJam, Tempah cites Dizzee Rascal and So Solid Crew as influences for the album, who've influenced him since his childhood. He also told Capital that Daft Punk influenced the album. Speaking about the album title Demonstration, Tinie {{said that it was}} about him compromising to make an album that was both true to where he came from and follows the trappings of mainstream hip hop: [...] "Anyone who wants to take inspiration from it can <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> example based on my experiences of how to do this. So basically, do something that still nods to where you've come from, still feels very London, still feels very British, but kind of meets the criteria of what a mainstream record needs." [...] He also commented oh how things change when signing with a record label and how the process of making albums: [...] "The first time around, you don't really know. All you do is you get this record deal and you're like whoa! Like, I'm signed! This is amazing! And you're just recording {{and before you know it}} the album's done. This time around, I had to think about so much more things, you know: edits, production things that I didn't like, going back and forth on mixing.... I was very hands-on this time." ...|$|E

500|$|The lyrics on {{the rock}} album {{tried to focus on}} [...] "general themes that {{everyone}} can get their hands on", while the acoustic had introspective lyrics that are [...] "vulnerable and revealing", with things Grohl [...] "wouldn't say out loud, wouldn't even admit to myself." [...] Grohl declared that [...] "when you're writing songs that <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> anthemic quality, you can't really go lighthearted and sing about bullshit. You have to dig into a deeper place to find the words", and that [...] "I don't know what it is about, this album, that makes it sound more heartfelt or deeper or more emotional, but when I listen to it, it really is." [...] These include [...] "Friend of a Friend", a song which Grohl wrote in the 1990s about himself and his former Nirvana bandmate Kurt Cobain during the time they shared an apartment together in 1990, and [...] "Still", talking about a suicide Grohl saw when he was ten in Virginia, by a boy who jumped on the train tracks. Much of the album's theme and content, including the title, came after Grohl spent time on the campaign trail with John Kerry during the 2004 presidential election. [...] "We'd pull in to small towns, and thousands of people would come to be rescued by this man", said Grohl. [...] "It's not a political record, but what I saw inspired me." ...|$|E
500|$|Another early {{influence}} was William Morris. In Vaughan Williams's words, [...] "It was now that Holst discovered {{the feeling of}} unity with his fellow men which made him afterwards a great teacher. A sense of comradeship rather than political conviction led him, while still a student, to join the Kelmscott House Socialist Club in Hammersmith." [...] At Kelmscott House, Morris's home, Holst attended lectures by his host and Bernard Shaw. His own socialism was moderate in character, but he enjoyed the club for its good company and his admiration of Morris as a man. His ideals were influenced by Morris's but had a different emphasis. Morris had written, [...] "I do not want art for a few any more than education for a few, or freedom for a few. I want all persons to be educated according to their capacity, not according {{to the amount of}} money which their parents happen to have". Holst said, [...] "'Aristocracy in art'—art is not for all but only for the chosen few—but the only way to find those few is to bring art to everyone—then the artists <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> masonic signal by which they recognise each other in the crowd." [...] He was invited to conduct the Hammersmith Socialist Choir, teaching them madrigals by Thomas Morley, choruses by Purcell, and works by Mozart, Wagner and himself. One of his choristers was (Emily) Isobel Harrison (1876–1969), a beautiful soprano two years his junior. He fell in love with her; she was at first unimpressed by him, but she came round and they were engaged, though with no immediate prospect of marriage given Holst's tiny income.|$|E

2500|$|The coinage of {{the word}} [...] "stagflation" [...] is {{attributed}} to him. Speaking in the House of Commons on 17 November 1965, he said: [...] "We now have the worst of both worlds — not just inflation {{on the one side}} or stagnation on the other, but both of them together. We <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> 'stagflation' situation. And history, in modern terms, is indeed being made." ...|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} on William F. Buckley's Firing Line program, Ervin suggested that people in public life need to have more [...] "backbone", and Buckley playfully suggested Gordon Liddy as a model to which Ervin responded, [...] "Well, Gordon Liddy has {{a little too much}} backbone. I'll have to admit that I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> sneaking admiration for a fellow like Gordon Liddy that does have an excess of backbone. His backbone exceeds his intelligence, really." ...|$|E

[...] He believes that [...] "it comes down to, if you don't <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> indignance {{when you see}} atrocities committed, you're not communing with the same humanity that I am." [...] While some of his lyrics are reminiscent of political slogans, such as [...] "Rights for Gays", he comments that his intention was to follow some social idioms [...] "through to [...] absurd conclusions where interesting things {{are more likely to}} happen. That's when the politics of aesthetics it's not in the protest lyrics." [...] On the song [...] "Cop Killer", he explains, [...] "I'm not talking about shooting or killing a human being, I'm talking about ... the cops in our heads, the cops that are everything other than us, everything inhuman, that would put us to work towards an end other than each other." ...|$|E
