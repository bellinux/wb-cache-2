40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to discuss and problematize how {{teachers}} <b>in</b> <b>civics</b> <b>in</b> upper secondary school construct drama, and how it relates to teaching, and students’ knowledge formation <b>in</b> <b>civics.</b> A study like this is important as the aesthetic subjects are becoming more prominent in young people’s everyday life at the same time as school by recent reformations is increasing the adjustment to efficiency and measurability. The theoretical framework is built on discursive psychology, which emanates from social constructionist and poststructuralist theory. Data consists of interviews with four upper secondary teachers <b>in</b> <b>civics.</b> Findings show that drama can be a valuable resource for teaching and learning civics, but also a problem when it comes to assessment. The position of the student as an object, teaching as entertainment and the domination of text is also discussed and problematized. Findings are considered as problematic as drama <b>in</b> <b>civics,</b> <b>in</b> relation to assessment, rather enhances a text-focused three-subject school than offering an alternative challeng...|$|R

5|$|Boyce was a multi-millionaire by {{the early}} 1900s and by 1909 became more {{interested}} <b>in</b> <b>civic</b> affairs and less in finance. He also began to travel, often as part of hunting expeditions. He leased hunting lodges at Fort Sisseton, South Dakota, where he had hunted as a young man. He often hosted friends and relatives, especially his son, for activities such as hunting, fishing, dinner, poker, and plentiful liquor. These changes {{may have been in}} part caused by the destruction of his Ottawa mansion by fire in early 1908, which was soon rebuilt, followed three months later by the sale of his Marseilles paper mill due to a new law that prevented railroads from negotiating with shippers, and his September 1908 announcement that he and his wife, Mary Jane, were separating.|$|E

He advocated a larger facility for the hospital, a cause in which he was eventually successful, though building did not commence until 1934 and he was still fundraising as Prime Minister. Stating that he was painfully aware of the defects of his own education, he played a part in the establishment of the University of Birmingham, of which Mason Science College became a part.

5|$|Keenly {{interested}} in the well-being of citizens and affairs related {{to the development of}} the growing town, he was nominated for and eventually elected to Edmonton Town Council as an alderman in 1903, finishing first of nine candidates, with 421 votes. His term was to last two years, but was truncated by a year by Edmonton's incorporation as a city, which meant that the entire city council was elected afresh in the 1904 election. In that election he was again elected to a two-year term, finishing first of seventeen candidates, but this time resigned one year into his term in order to run for mayor in the 1905 election. May's time on council included the time in which Alberta was incorporated as a province; as an alderman he voiced his support for a lavish celebration to be in Edmonton, which was to be the capital city of the new province. While sitting on council, he also voted against a proposed bylaw that would have permitted suffrage for women <b>in</b> <b>civic</b> elections; he had initially voted in favour of the law, but had later reconsidered and reversed his vote, effectively killing the bill.

5|$|South Asian music {{places a}} special {{emphasis}} on drumming, which is freed from the primary time-keeping function of drumming found in {{other part of the}} world. In North India, secular processional bands play an important role <b>in</b> <b>civic</b> festival parades and the bārāt processions leading a groom's wedding party to the bride's home or the hall where a wedding is held. These bands vary in makeup, depending on the means of the families employing them and according to changing fashions over time, but the core instrumentation is a small group of percussionists, usually playing a frame drum (ḍaphalā), a gong, and a pair of kettledrums (nagāṛā). Better-off families will add shawms (shehnai) to the percussion, while the most affluent who also prefer a more modern or fashionable image may replace the traditional ensemble with a brass band. The Karnatic music of southern India includes a tradition of instrumental temple music in the state of Kerala, called kṣētram vādyam. It includes three main genres, all focussed on rhythm and featuring unpitched percussion. Thayambaka in particular is a virtuoso genre for unpitched percussion only: a solo double-headed cylindrical drum called chenda, played with a pair of sticks, and accompanied by other chenda and elathalam (pairs of cymbals). The other two genres, panchavadyam and pandi melam add wind instruments to the ensemble, but only as accompaniment to the primary drums and cymbals. A panchavadyam piece typically lasts about an hour, while a pandi melam performance may be as long as four hours.|$|E
