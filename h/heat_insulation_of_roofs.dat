Due to e. g. population growth and higher comfort requirements it is highly likely that this energy consumption will continue to increase.

Therefore a scenario-analysis is conducted using the EPB-software Flanders and a self-designed Excel file for calculating the most important profitability criteria.

The house is constituted of two floors and {{was designed to be}} energy efficient by integrating some passive techniques: overhangs, an Earth-to-Air Heat Exchanger (EAHX), thermal <b>insulation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>roof</b> and external walls. Most of these systems are unusual in Marrakech buildings; thus the objective of this work is to study their effects on the house cooling and heating loads. The modeling of the house is a multi-zone one and it was carried out during one year. The effects of the passive systems on air temperature in the building, as well as on its cooling/heating load, are analyzed through the modeling of 5 cases. The first case is the real house and the others correspond to the lack of one of the system (i. e. the overhang along the south facade in the second floor, thermal <b>insulation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>roof</b> and thermal <b>insulation</b> <b>of</b> external walls), the fifth case correspond to the lack of all the systems (“standard house”). The results show that some of these systems reduce the maximum temperature, while some others act only on the minimum temperature by increasing it. The first systems reduce the cooling load and are very efficient in summer (this is the case, especially, <b>of</b> the thermal <b>insulation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>roof).</b> The other systems reduce the heating load and have a small effect on the cooling load.
