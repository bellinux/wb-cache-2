40|$|Abstract: Cinematic {{tradition}} {{suggests that}} Hollywood films, like plays, {{are divided into}} acts. Thompson (1999) streamlined the conception of this largescale film structure by suggesting that most films are composed of four acts of generally equal length—the setup, the complicating action, the development, and the climax (often including an epilog). These acts {{are based on the}} structure of the narrative, and would not necessarily have a physical manifestation in shots and transitions. Nonetheless, exploring a sample of 150 Hollywood style films from 1935 to 2005, this article demonstrates that acts shape shot lengths and transitions. Dividing films into quarters, we found that shots are longer at quarter boundaries and generally shorter near the middle of each quarter. Moreover, aside from the beginnings and ends of films, the article shows that fades, dissolves, and other non-cut transitions are more common <b>in</b> <b>the</b> third and less common <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>quarters</b> of films...|$|R

The defense also dominated the quarter and did not allow FAU a single third down conversion during the period. In the third, Foster connected on a 46-yard field goal and early <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>quarter</b> Kenyan Drake scored on an eight-yard touchdown run for a 40–0 lead. With the game in hand, Alabama played many of their backups in the second half. As such, late <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>quarter</b> the Crimson Tide shutout streak that stretched back to {{the third quarter of}} their week one victory over Michigan ended when the Owls' Graham Wilbert threw a six-yard touchdown pass to Alex Deleon that made the final score 40–7.|$|E
