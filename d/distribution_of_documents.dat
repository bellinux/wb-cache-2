Responding to the leak, The Heartland Institute said one of the documents released, a two-page 'Strategy Memo', had been forged. Gleick denied forging the document. Gleick described his actions as [...] "a serious lapse of my own and professional judgment and ethics" [...] and said that he [...] "deeply regrethis own actions in this case" [...] and [...] "offerhis personal apologies to all those affected". He stated that [...] "My judgment was blinded by my frustration with the ongoing efforts - often anonymous, well-funded, and coordinated - to attack climate science and scientists and prevent this debate, and by the lack of transparency of the organizations involved." [...] On February 24 he wrote to the board of the Pacific Institute requesting a [...] "temporary short-term leave of absence" [...] from the Institute. The Board of Directors stated it was [...] "deeply concerned regarding recent events" [...] involving Gleick and the Heartland documents, and appointed a new Acting Executive Director on February 27.

40|$|Query-independent {{features}} (also called document priors), such as {{the number}} of incoming links to a document, its Page-Rank, or the type of its associated URL, have been successfully integrated into Web Information Retrieval systems in order to enhance the retrieval effectiveness. The combination <b>of</b> several <b>document</b> priors could further enhance the retrieval performance. However, most current combination of priors approaches are based on heuristics, and often ignore the possible dependence between the document priors. In this paper, we present a novel and robust method for conditionally combining document priors in a principled way. The approach adjusts the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>document</b> priors for one source of evidence according to the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>document</b> priors for other sources of evidence. We investigate the retrieval performance attainable by our combination of priors method, in comparison to the use of single priors and to a heuristic combination <b>of</b> <b>document</b> priors method, which assumes that document priors are independent. Furthermore, we investigate how sensitive the proposed method is to the training data. Using two standard Web test collections, including the large-scale. GOV 2 test collection, we find that some <b>of</b> the <b>document</b> priors used in our experiments, have a considerably high correlation, suggesting that the dependency between documents priors should indeed be taken into account. Through extensive experiments on these two large-scale collections, we observe that our proposed conditional combination method is overall effective and robust. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceFor {{large-scale}} category systems, such as Directory Mozilla, which {{consist of}} tens of thousand categories, it has been empirically verified in earlier studies that the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> among categories can be modeled as a power-law distribution. It implies that a significant fraction of categories, referred to as rare categories, have very few documents assigned to them. This characteristic of the data {{makes it harder for}} learning algorithms to learn effective decision boundaries which can correctly detect such categories in the test set. In this work, we exploit the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> among categories to (i) derive an upper bound on the accuracy of any classifier, and (ii) propose a ranking-based algorithm which aims to maximize this upper bound. The empirical evaluation on publicly available large-scale datasets demonstrate that the proposed method not only achieves higher accuracy but also much higher coverage of rare categories as compared to state-of-the-art methods...|$|E

40|$|Time is an {{important}} relevance signal when searching streams of social media posts. The <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>document</b> timestamps {{from the results of}} an initial query can be leveraged to infer the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> relevant <b>documents,</b> which can then be used to rerank the initial results. Previous experiments have shown that kernel density estimation is a simple yet effective implementation of this idea. This paper explores an alternative approach to mining temporal signals with recurrent neural networks. Our intuition is that neural networks provide a more expressive framework to capture the temporal coherence <b>of</b> neighboring <b>documents</b> in time. To our knowledge, we are the first to integrate lexical and temporal signals in an end-to-end neural network architecture, in which existing neural ranking models are used to generate query-document similarity vectors that feed into a bidirectional LSTM layer for temporal modeling. Our results are mixed: existing neural models for document ranking alone yield limited improvements over simple baselines, but the integration of lexical and temporal signals yield significant improvements over competitive temporal baselines.
