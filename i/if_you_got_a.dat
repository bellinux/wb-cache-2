2500|$|When CNN {{presenter}} Jeff Greenfield {{was asked}} why Chomsky was never on his show, {{he claimed that}} Chomsky might [...] "be {{one of the leading}} intellectuals who can't talk on television. [...] <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> 22-minute show, and a guy takes five minutes to warm up, [...] he's out". Greenfield described this need to [...] "say things between two commercials" [...] as the media's requirement for [...] "concision". Chomsky has elaborated on this, saying that [...] "the beauty of [...] is that you can only repeat conventional thoughts. If you repeat conventional thoughts, you require zero evidence, like saying Osama Bin Laden is a bad guy, no evidence is required. However, if you say something that is true, although not a conventional truth, like the United States attacked South Vietnam, people are going to rightfully want evidence, {{and a whole lot of}} it, as they should. The format of the shows do not allow this type of evidence which is one of the reasons concision is critical." [...] He's continued that if the media were better propagandists they would invite dissidents to speak more often because the time restraint would stop them from properly explaining their radical views and they [...] "would sound like they were from Neptune." [...] For this reason, Chomsky rejects many offers to appear on TV, preferring the written medium.|$|E

5000|$|Nevertheless, Goldman {{began to}} work with Marciano. Goldman {{believed}} that a trainer should not interfere with a fighter's natural style, but rather refine and improve it. Accordingly, he {{did not try to}} turn him into a slick jabbing boxer. He also sought to turn Marciano's shortcomings into advantages. His adage was: [...] "If you got a tall fighter, make him taller. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> short fighter make him shorter." [...] With Marciano, Goldman made him shorter by teaching him to fight out of crouch. By having him stoop low Goldman made the already low target offered by Marciano that much harder to hit.|$|E
