25|$|Conservative Judaism {{believes}} in a Messiah {{and in a}} rebuilt Temple, but {{does not believe in}} the restoration of sacrifices. Accordingly, Conservative Judaism's Committee on Jewish Law and Standards has modified the prayers. Conservative prayerbooks call for the restoration of Temple, but <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>ask</b> for resumption of sacrifices. The Orthodox study session on sacrifices in the daily morning service has been replaced with the Talmudic passages teaching that deeds of loving-kindness now atone for sin.|$|E

We do not see how you could. We <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>ask</b> it.|$|E

This sentence prevented his ever applying again to any of Mississippi's all-white colleges. Roberts was given five years' probation and freed. In 2005, when an investigation was re-opened into the case, Roberts testified under oath that Kennard was innocent: [...] "Kennard <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>ask</b> me to steal, Kennard <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>ask</b> me {{to break into the}} co-op, Kennard <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>ask</b> me to <b>do</b> anything illegal." ...|$|R
25|$|Street vendors crowd Eje 1 North and {{the side}} streets on either side in both the La Lagunilla and Tepito neighborhoods. Those closest to the fixed market {{buildings}} often sell items similar to that which is inside, and those located near the formal occasion shops emulate these as well. This informal market has grown such that vendors with stalls and vehicles now routinely block several of the main avenue’s six lanes. The problem begins from Comonfort Street, two blocks from Paseo de la Reforma. Here, vendors have taken over the lane dedicated to buses, with stands selling clothing, food, unlicensed CDs and DVDs and more. In some side streets, traffic is cut in half and in the smallest, there is no passage of vehicular traffic at all on weekends. In total, there are eleven city blocks severely affected by this. Cuauhtémoc borough authorities state {{that they do not}} have enough personnel to effect an eviction of the vendors. Earlier attempts to do this have resulted in threats to administration officials. Another issue is that many roving vendors sell beer and customers in the market proper can be seen drinking their purchases as they walk through the aisles. The most popular form of buying beer here is a “michelada” with a large bottle of beer (940ml) called a caguama emptied into a large cup and mixed with lime juice, salt and sometimes chili pepper and Worcestershire sauce. These vendors <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>ask</b> for proof of age. This informal market has made La Lagunilla one of the main centers for the production and sale of bootlegged CDs and DVDs.|$|E

500|$|Simple and brief, {{services}} are {{performed in the}} temples, generally twice per day, and are composed of two forms of worship: [...] "The General Operation", which consists of the transmission of the fluid to the churchgoers, and [...] "The Reading" [...] of Antoine's writings. Members who performed the services wear an entirely black dress, as sign of an intense involvement in the religion; they are not paid. Temples are also the place of consultations of a healer by people who wish to obtain a request, frequently related to health. Antoinist celebrations include Christian holidays and other three days that commemorate the founding couple and {{the dedication of the}} first temple. Registered as organism of public utility in Belgium and as religious association in France, the religion is directed by a college composed of the most active members called desservants. It is financed by anonymous donations and <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>ask</b> for money from its followers. In France, the cult classification of Antoinism in the 1995 Parliamentary Report was criticized by the sociologists who studied the religious group, and many people involved in the anti-cults fight did not report cultic deviances.|$|E

In {{his own words}} from the preface: these plays were [...] "aimed at {{carrying}} on the West-Penwith tradition of turning local folk tales into plays for Christmas acting. What they took over from these guise-dance drolls, as they were called, was their love of the local speech and their readiness to break here and there into rhyme or song". And of the music he says [...] "the simple airs <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>ask</b> for accompaniment or for trained voices to do them justice. They are only a slight extension of the music that West-Penwith voices will put into the dialogue." ...|$|E

The Ritualists <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>ask</b> to interfere with devotion of others ….only to be allowed, in their worship of God, to use a Ritual which a few years ago no one disputed." [...] As Fr. Enraght was imprisoned over the Christmas period, he was gratified to receive letters of support and goodwill from his own and former parishioners around the country, as well as Christmas cards from children in Bordesley.|$|E

However, if so specified, these products can be identical to number plates sold by approved RNPS registered supplier. Many of these companies <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>ask</b> customers to prove ownership of the registration they are purchasing, and try {{to circumvent the law}} by placing disclaimers on their websites. Despite these disclaimers, it is still not legal to produce any registration plates without seeing proof of identity of the purchaser (such as a driving licence), and proof of their connection to the registration (such as a V5C or retention certificate).|$|E

But take away Scotland Yard!" [...] When asked in 1919 about the Covenant of the League of Nations Morley said: [...] "I have not read it, and I don't intend to read it. It's not worth the paper it's written on. To the end of time it'll always be a case of 'Thy head or my head'. I've no faith in these schemes". When a prominent Liberal praised someone as [...] "a good European" [...] Morley remarked: [...] "When I lay me down at night or rise in the morning I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>ask</b> myself if I am a good European".

2500|$|The National Organization for Non-Parents (N.O.N.) {{was begun}} in Palo Alto, CA by Ellen Peck and Shirley Radl in 1972. [...] N.O.N. {{was formed to}} advance the notion {{that men and women}} could choose not to have children—to be childfree. [...] Changing its name to the National Alliance for Optional Parenthood, it {{continued}} into the early 1980s both as a support group for those making the decision to be childfree and an advocacy group fighting pronatalism (attitudes/advertising/etc. promoting or glorifying parenthood). [...] According to its bylaws, the purpose of the National Alliance for Optional Parenthood was to educate the public on non-parenthood as a valid lifestyle option, support those who choose not to have children, promote awareness of the overpopulation problem, and assist other groups that advanced the goals of the organization. N.O.N.'s offices were located in Reisterstown, MD; then Baltimore, MD; and, ultimately, in Washington, D.C. N.O.N. designated August 1 as Non-Parents' Day.Just as people with children come from all shades of the political spectrum and temper their beliefs accordingly, so do the childfree. For example, while some childfree people think of government welfare to parents as [...] "lifestyle subsidies," [...] others accept the need to assist such individuals but think that their lifestyle should be equally compensated. Still others accept the need to help out such individuals and also <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>ask</b> for subsidies of their own.|$|E
