5|$|The main {{production}} company behind Audition was the Japanese company Omega Project. Omega were originally behind {{the production of}} Hideo Nakata's film Ring; {{this was a great}} success in Japan and, subsequently, the rest of Asia. Omega had problems setting up the release of Ring in Korea and had the company AFDF Korea work on a Korean re-adaptation of the Ring. The following year, in 1998, Omega partnered again with AFDF Korea and other production companies including Creators Company Connection, Film Face, and Bodysonic to make the adaptation of Ryū Murakami's 1997 novel Audition. Omega wanted to create a film different than supernatural-themed Ring, and chose to adapt Murakami's novel, which lacked this trait. To attempt something different, they hired a screenwriter (Daisuke Tengan) and a director (Takashi Miike) who were not known <b>for</b> <b>working</b> on horror films. Prior to Audition, Tengan was best known as a screenwriter <b>for</b> <b>working</b> with his father (Shohei Imamura) on The Eel, which won the Palme d'Or in 1997.|$|E

50|$|In theory, though, it is {{possible}} in Norwegian to make words {{as long as one}} wants; for instance, menneskerettighetsorganisasjonssekretæren (the secretary of a human rights organization), menneskerettighetsorganisasjonssekretærkurset (the course <b>for</b> secretaries <b>working</b> <b>for</b> human rights organizations), menneskerettighetsorganisasjonssekretærkursmateriellet (the material for a course <b>for</b> secretaries <b>working</b> <b>for</b> human rights organizations), and so on, are possible. The reason is that compounds are, unlike in English, mostly closed in Norwegian (skolebuss vs. school bus). Definite articles are also suffixed instead of being separate words (bussen vs. the bus), which may lengthen nouns by an additional two-three letters.|$|R
