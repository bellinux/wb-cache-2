In the light of recent skills policy developments in England and drawing upon the findings of an empirical qualitative study of specific workforce development initiatives and previous research, this paper identifies and analyses key factors that facilitate and/or hinder effective higher education-employer engagement activities. The lessons learned and suggested recommendations will be of interest and value to both higher education institutions and employers in establishing and, more importantly, sustaining, effective workforce development partnerships...|$|E
40|$|The {{connections}} between chess and knowledge management, chess and military strategy, chess and skills development, chess and decision-making ability, chess and personality development are concepts {{that have been}} researched for a long time. The actuality of our presentation and recommendations {{is supported by the}} explosive development of infocommunication technologies of our times. Thanks to the outstanding information-technological background of chess, the efficiency of chess education has significantly improved. As a result, skills, personality, and the methods of developing the decision-making ability can be elaborated relatively easily, as well as they can be applied effectively. In our presentation we would like to share some possibilities and results of research connected to the application of chess in <b>education,</b> <b>in</b> <b>skills</b> development, in personality development and in the developement of decision-making ability, all of which can also be successfully applied in the field of human resources...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Since {{the modern}} state's {{emergence}} {{in the sixteenth}} century, theorists have articulated various approaches to understanding the development of different countries, {{the relative importance of}} the role of the state and markets in development, and the models and strategies of development that countries should follow. Of these approaches, the developmental-state thesis (and world systems theory) has been more useful in explaining the state's important role in economic growth and industrialization, particularly in East Asia and Latin America after World War II. Developmental states refer to countries that, compared to Western industrial countries, achieved “late development” (White & Wade, 1988 b: 1). They include capitalist countries, such as Germany, Japan, Russia, South Korea, and Taiwan, and socialist countries, such as China, the former Soviet Union, and North Korea. Despite the severe challenges posed by the fi nancial globalization crisis that took place in Asia in 1997, this statist approach is still useful in explaining the intertwined interactions of the state and markets for development and competition within and between national borders. This chapter fi rst introduces major theoretical frameworks for understanding development, the state, and markets. They include the theories of modernization, dependency, the world system, and the developmental state. The discussion focuses on the latter and the role of <b>education</b> <b>in</b> <b>skills</b> formation in developmental states. Second, the chapter examines challenges to the developmental-state thesis, both theoretically, in the literature of globalization, and practically, as exemplifi ed by the 1997 economic crisis in Asia. Third, the chapter uses the cases of Japan as a capitalist developmental state and China as a socialist counterpart to illustrate the continuing signifi cance of the state, markets, and education in nation-building and rebuilding and how states have used the economic and sociopolitical tasks of education for the cause of development. Finally, the chapter discusses the complex relationship between globalization and nationalism in development...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a classical-Marxian macroeconomic model {{to examine the}} growth and distributional consequences of education. First, the role of <b>education</b> <b>in</b> <b>skill</b> formation is considered and it is shown that an expansion <b>in</b> <b>education</b> will promote growth and have beneficial distributional effects within the working class, but it will redistribute income from workers to capitalists. Second, the model is extended analyze the broader political economic consequences of education on class relations and class conflict. The model suggests {{the importance of a}} progressive type of education rather than one which weakens the power workers, for it allows for equitable growth outcomes which improve the position of workers as a whole and reduces inequality within workers. Finally, the model shows that education leads to multiple equilibria and it stresses the importance of providing suitable incentives to workers for taking advantage of greater education access, without which the economy can be caught in a low-skill trap.

40|$|Abstract: Background: Cancer {{management}} is increasingly being delivered within a multidisciplinary team (MDT) environment, involving several highly skilled professionals. There {{is therefore a}} good indication {{of the importance of}} good and effective communication skills within these collaborative care teams. Aim: The study examined the process of communication, information transfer and collaboration among the MDT in cancer management. Methods: A quantitative descriptive survey using a semi structured questionnaire was administered to Forty five (45) multidisciplinary health professionals. Data collected was analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Scientists (SPSS) version 18. 0 and discussions were based on the responses from the participants. Results: More than half (54. 5 %) of the respondents used verbal communication whiles 31. 8 % described telephone as the most difficult mode of communication for them. Lack of additional <b>education</b> <b>in</b> communication <b>skills</b> was identified among 75 % of the respondents. There were 29. 5 % of the respondents who indicated that Staff especially the seniors show disrespect to the juniors. In all, 34 % of the participants had no idea about whether protocols or guidelines in communication existed. Conclusion: There was a high level collaboration level among the MDT involved in the management of cancer. Most of these professionals however, had no further <b>education</b> <b>in</b> communication <b>skills</b> and several recommendations wer...|$|R
40|$|Paediatric care places great {{demands on}} {{interpersonal}} communication skills, especially {{as regards the}} handling of psychosocial issues. Recent shifts in paediatric morbidity and increases in patient empowerment furthermore emphasize the need for continuing paediatric <b>education</b> <b>in</b> communication <b>skills.</b> It is, however, debatable, whether after residency paediatric education can influence paediatrician performance. This study evaluated {{the effects of a}} 5 -day experiential communication training by means of a pre-test/post-test control group design. A total of 21 consulting paediatricians (10 experimental, I 1 control group paediatricians) videotaped two series or consecutive outpatient encounters. Compared with the untrained control group, trained paediatricians asked more psychosocial questions and looked at the patients and their parents more often. In addition, they gave patients and parents more room to talk. No difference was found in the length of the outpatient visits. Conclusion: Paediatric education after residency influences paediatricians' verbal and nonverbal communication skills positively, especially as regards handling psychosocial issues. On the basis of these findings, it appears worthwhile to encourage continuing paediatric <b>education</b> <b>in</b> interpersonal communication <b>skills...</b>|$|R
