2500|$|The {{push for}} VSU has been {{strongly}} resisted by the Australian National Union of Students and trade unions. NUS views {{the argument that}} not all students benefit from student membership as fallacious, claiming that there is [...] an <b>indirect</b> <b>benefit</b> for students generally. It describes pro-VSU positions as being analogous to voluntary taxation; particularly given that, if membership was voluntary, there would be {{opportunities for students to}} enjoy student organisation services without having to pay for them. The argument runs that student services would still be demanded under VSU, and the charges for them would still have to be levied by universities; but students would lose oversight of the allocation and direction of those funds. In recognition of this, the Howard Government's proposed legislation includes provisions that fine universities for not refunding student services charges.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Indirect</b> <b>benefits</b> {{increase}} genetic {{fitness for}} the offspring, and thereby increase the parents' inclusive fitness. When {{it appears that}} the choosy sex does not receive direct benefits from his or her mate, <b>indirect</b> <b>benefits</b> may be the payoff for being selective. These <b>indirect</b> <b>benefits</b> may include high-quality genes for their offspring (known as adaptive <b>indirect</b> <b>benefits)</b> or genes that make their offspring more attractive (known as arbitrary <b>indirect</b> <b>benefits).</b>|$|R
40|$|Sexual {{selection}} theory {{assumes that}} maximizing fitness {{is the ultimate}} goal in every mating decision. Fitness can be maximized directly by {{increasing the number of}} offspring (direct benefits) or indirectly by maximizing offspring’s lifetime reproductive success (<b>indirect</b> <b>benefits).</b> Whereas there is considerable evidence in the literature for the influence of mating decisions on direct <b>benefits,</b> <b>indirect</b> <b>benefits</b> have been more elusive. Here, we review the variables that influence mating decisions made by females of freshwater fish and how these affect their fitness directly, as well as indirectly. Females enhance their fitness by matching their mating decisions to current environmental conditions, using a wide range of pre- and post-copulation mechanisms that enable them to maximize benefits from mating. Male sexual traits and courtship displays are signals used by females as a way of assessing male quality in terms of both direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>benefits.</b> Polyandry is very common among freshwater fish species, and <b>indirect</b> <b>benefits</b> have been hypothesized as drivers of its predominance. Despite intensive theoretical work, and multiple suggestions of the effects of <b>indirect</b> <b>benefits,</b> to date no study has been able to demonstrate experimentally the existence of <b>indirect</b> <b>benefits</b> in freshwater fish species. Additionally, most studies of direct benefits measure short-term benefits of mating decisions. In both cases, lifetime reproductive success is not assessed. Therefore, we are led to conclude that evidence as to whether female mating decisions result in direct and/or <b>indirect</b> <b>benefits</b> in freshwater fish species is still lacking. These results should be considered in light of the ongoing debate about the significance of <b>indirect</b> <b>benefits</b> in female mating decisions. # 2006 The Author...|$|R

60|$|The second {{benefit to}} be {{expected}} from giving to women the free use of their faculties, by leaving them the free choice of their employments, and opening to them the same field of occupation and the same prizes and encouragements as to other human beings, would be that of doubling the mass of mental faculties available for the higher service of humanity. Where there is now one person qualified to benefit mankind and promote the general improvement, as a public teacher, or an administrator of some branch of public or social affairs, there would then be a chance of two. Mental superiority of any kind is at present everywhere so much below the demand; {{there is such a}} deficiency of persons competent to do excellently anything which it requires any considerable amount of ability to do; that the loss to the world, by refusing to make use of one-half of the whole quantity of talent it possesses, is extremely serious. It is true that this amount of mental power is not totally lost. Much of it is employed, and would in any case be employed, in domestic management, and in the few other occupations open to women; and from the remainder <b>indirect</b> <b>benefit</b> is in many individual cases obtained, through the personal influence of individual women over individual men. But these benefits are partial; their range is extremely circumscribed; and if they must be admitted, on the one hand, as a deduction from the amount of fresh social power that would be acquired by giving freedom to one-half of the whole sum of human intellect, there must be added, on the other, the benefit of the stimulus that would be given to the intellect of men by the competition; or (to use a more true expression) by the necessity that would be imposed on them of deserving precedency before they could expect to obtain it.|$|E

40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{foundation of}} sexually antagonistic coevolution is that females suffer a net fitness cost through {{their interactions with}} males. The empirical prediction is that direct costs to female lifetime fecundity will exceed <b>indirect</b> <b>benefits</b> despite a possible increase in the genetic quality of offspring. Although direct costs of males have been repeatedly shown, to date no study has comprehensively tested whether females are compensated for this direct harm through <b>indirect</b> <b>benefits.</b> Here we use experimental evolution {{to show that a}} mutation giving Drosophila melanogaster females nearly complete resistance to the direct costs of male courtship and remating, but which also excluded almost all <b>indirect</b> <b>benefits,</b> is strongly favoured by selection. We estimated the selection coefficient favouring the resistance allele to be + 20 %. These results demonstrate that any <b>indirect</b> <b>benefits</b> that females accrued were not sufficient to counter-balance the direct costs of males, and reinforce a large body of past studies by verifying interlocus sexual conflict in this model syste...|$|R

These studies suggest that a quantitative genetic approach can illuminate this long-standing problem and that alternative models for the evolution of mate preferences should be tested in wild populations...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, I use 10 {{populations of}} Drosophila melanogaster, each fixed for a {{different}} visible recessive mutation to investigate two outstanding issues in sexual selection research.

Cross-environment correlations were not conducive to <b>indirect</b> <b>benefits</b> following colonization of a novel environment. Second, to investigate the contribution of variable search effort to variance among males in mating success, I conducted mate choice trials to compare the relative mating success of mutant males in small vs. large arenas. Sexual selection against mutant males was stronger when search effort was included than when it was excluded, indicating that varying ability to find mates may increase the strength of selection against deleterious alleles...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} the expected {{economic benefits of}} cholesterol lowering for adult men with significant elevations of total serum cholesterol (above 260 mg/dl), incorporating estimates of direct benefits from anticipated reductions in lifetime expenditures for medical care, and estimates of <b>indirect</b> <b>benefits</b> related to extension of work-life secondary to reductions in morbidity and premature mortality. Our findings yield discounted lifetime direct benefits of a 15 per cent reduction in total serum cholesterol of $ 3 to $ 208 per person, and discounted lifetime <b>indirect</b> <b>benefits</b> of $ 1 to $ 8, 946. Benefits increase with an individual's initial cholesterol level and decrease with {{the age at which}} an intervention is initiated. Economic benefits increase approximately twofold in the presence of other coronary risk factors, such as cigarette smoking and hypertension. Results suggest that cholesterol-lowering interventions, no matter what their cost, are unlikely to result in substantial direct savings to the health care system. However, the <b>indirect</b> <b>benefits</b> of intervention are quite high for young and middle-aged adults, as well as for those with severe elevations of cholesterol or with additional coronary risk factors...|$|R
40|$|We {{advance a}} {{framework}} for understanding why and how gossip may promote generosity and cooperation, especially in situations that can result in greater <b>indirect</b> <b>benefits</b> from others. Drawing on evolutionary theory, we derive novel hypotheses about how two reliably recurring properties of human social networks - they are "small" and contain fewer well-connected people - provide insight about when people may maximize <b>indirect</b> <b>benefits</b> of generosity. Across three studies, we find support for the hypothesis that people increase their generosity when the recipient (or an observer) is connected and can gossip {{to at least one}} or many others whom they might interact with in the future. Moreover, reputational concern, rather than expected <b>indirect</b> <b>benefits</b> from one's future partners, primarily mediated this observed gossip-based generosity, and the mediation effect of reputational concern was statistically more pronounced for proselfs than for prosocials. We discuss the importance of these findings in the context of evolutionary perspectives on human cooperation, along with some novel insights about how properties of social networks influence social behavior...|$|R
