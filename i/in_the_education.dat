Engaging <b>the</b> m-learning services <b>in</b> <b>the</b> higher <b>education</b> could improve <b>the</b> availability of <b>education.</b> This study aims to develop a theoretical model for explaining and predicting student acceptance and use of m-learning services <b>in</b> <b>the</b> higher <b>education</b> environment. Students’ perspective {{is very important to}} investigate the use behavior of m-learning <b>in</b> <b>the</b> higher <b>education</b> environment. Findings of the study suggest that the behavior intention to use the m-learning by students <b>in</b> <b>the</b> higher <b>education</b> environment have positive influence on the use behavior. Consequently, the availability of facilitating conditions is an important to influence students’ use behavior. The study suggests several factors as important determinants of the behavior intention to use <b>the</b> m-learning <b>in</b> <b>the</b> higher <b>education</b> environment. Specifically, behavior intension to use appears to be adopted and facilitated by the usefulness of m-learning services, so more usefulness of m-learning leads to more acceptances among students <b>in</b> <b>the</b> higher <b>education.</b> Besides, <b>the</b> perceived service quality is important role <b>in</b> determining <b>the</b> level of behavior intention to use...|$|R
5|$|Education {{in early}} modern Scotland {{includes}} {{all forms of}} education within the modern borders of Scotland, {{between the end of}} the Middle Ages in the late fifteenth century and the beginnings of the Enlightenment in the mid-eighteenth century. By the sixteenth century such formal educational institutions as grammar schools, petty schools and sewing schools for girls were established in Scotland, while children of the nobility often studied under private tutors. Scotland had three universities, but the curriculum was limited and Scottish scholars had to go abroad to gain second degrees. These contacts were {{one of the most important}} ways in which the new ideas of Humanism were brought into Scottish intellectual life. Humanist concern with education and Latin culminated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Education</b> Act 1496.|$|E

Willis went on to win a full four-year term on the court in 1928, and distinguished himself by revising Thornton on the Law of Oil and Gas, a six-volume law reference.

5|$|As {{part of the}} 2013 budget the Dunderdale {{government}} announced that the province's four English school boards would be consolidated into one, while the one French school board would remain as is. The number of school boards in the province had been reduced in 2004, from 10 boards to five. Since that time student enrolment in Newfoundland and Labrador had declined by 14,000, or 17 per cent. The government faced criticism for the amalgamation from people <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>education</b> system but despite this Minister Clyde Jackman announced {{the appointment of a}} transition team for the amalgamation on April 24, 2013, with a plan to have the new school board in place for September of that year.

However, the minister said there would be no reduction in the allocation of regular classroom teachers, and Jackman stated that Newfoundland and Labrador had the best student-teacher ratio in the country.|$|E
5|$|The Ministry of Education, Research and Culture has the {{jurisdiction}} of educational responsibility in the Faroe Islands. Since the Faroe Islands is a constituent country of the Danish Realm, education in the Faroe Islands is influenced and has similarities with the Danish educational system; there is an agreement on educational cooperation between the Faroe Islands and Denmark. In 2012 the public spending on education was 8.1% of GDP.

5|$|The Pictish and Cumbric {{languages}} {{were replaced}} by Gaelic, Old English and later Norse, with Gaelic emerging as the major cultural language. From the eleventh century French was adopted in the court and in the late Middle Ages, Scots, derived from Old English, became dominant, with Gaelic largely confined to the Highlands. Christianity brought Latin, written culture and monasteries as centres of learning. From the twelfth century, educational opportunities widened and a growth of lay education cumulated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Education</b> Act 1496. Until in the fifteenth century, when Scotland gained three universities, Scots pursuing higher education had to travel to England or the continent, where some gained an international reputation. Literature survives in all the major languages present in the early Middle Ages, with Scots emerging as a major literary language from John Barbour's Brus (1375), developing a culture of poetry by court makars, and later major works of prose. Art from the early Middle Ages survives in carving, in metalwork, and elaborate illuminated books, which contributed {{to the development of}} the wider insular style. Much of the finest later work has not survived, but there are a few key examples, particularly of work commissioned in the Netherlands. Scotland had a musical tradition, with secular music composed and performed by bards and from the thirteenth century, church music increasingly influenced by continental and English forms.|$|E
