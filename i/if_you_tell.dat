500|$|Bush {{continued}} {{to serve on}} the NACA through 1948 and expressed annoyance with aircraft companies for delaying development of a turbojet engine because of the huge expense of research and development as well as retooling from older piston engines. He was similarly disappointed with the automobile industry, which showed no interest in his proposals for more fuel-efficient engines. General Motors told him that [...] "even if it were a better engine, [...] would not be interested in it." [...] Bush likewise deplored trends in advertising. [...] "Madison Avenue believes," [...] he said, [...] "that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> the public something absurd, but do it enough times, the public will ultimately register it in its stock of accepted verities." ...|$|E
500|$|Bono {{continued}} making crank {{calls as}} MacPhisto, but the targets {{changed with the}} location of each concert. Many of them were local politicians that Bono wished to mock by engaging them in character as the devil. He enjoyed making these calls, saying, [...] "When you're dressed as the Devil, your conversation is immediately loaded, so <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> somebody you really like what they're doing, you know it's not a compliment." [...] The band intended for MacPhisto to add humour while making a point. Said the Edge, [...] "That character was a great device for saying {{the opposite of what}} you meant. It made the point so easily and with real humor." [...] A female Cardiff fan who was pulled on-stage questioned Bono's motives for dressing as the devil, prompting the singer to compare his act to the plot of the C. S. Lewis novel The Screwtape Letters.|$|E

He was on the balcony where this elderly woman was serving boiled shrimp. Coach Dodd said, ‘Y”know, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> that lady her hair looks nice, you’re {{not going to run}} out of boiled shrimp all night, and what’ve you done? Something honest, fair and nice. Do that and people are going to want to do something nice for you.’ ...|$|E

2500|$|Seo: That is not so. Our {{country is}} in fact former Koguryŏ, {{and that is why}} it is named Koryŏ and has a capital at P'yŏngyang. If you want to discuss {{territorial}} boundaries, the Eastern Capital of your country is within our borders.... Moreover, the land {{on both sides of the}} Yalu River is also within our borders, but the Jurchens have now stolen it.... <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> us to drive out the Jurchens, recover our former territory, construct fortresses, and open the roads, then how could we dare not to have [...] relations?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{before the}} {{findings}} of the inquiry into Wright's death were released in September 2010, Ulster Television News broadcast a report regarding the question of collusion. South Belfast UDA brigadier Jackie McDonald explained to Ulster Television's Live Tonight the UVF's mindset at the time Wright was threatened with execution by the CLMC in 1996, [...] "It was obvious he [...] was doing his own thing and going his own way. I think he had become such an embarrassment to the UVF that they had to send word to him {{to get out of the}} country – that's when the LVF was formed, that's when the breakaway group appeared." [...] When asked by the interviewer whether or not the CLMC had actually been prepared to carry out the death threat against Wright McDonald replied, [...] "You have to be prepared to kill people <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> them to do something and they don't do it – something of that magnitude. If you say they had to go and they don't go – the defiance alone, it doesn't leave many alternatives". McDonald expressed his personal belief that there had probably been no state collusion in Wright's death. Equally dismissive of the allegations of collusion, Willie Gallagher of the Republican Socialist Movement offered the suggestion that had the INLA not killed Wright, he would have been released from prison shortly afterwards. Once free, Wright would have continued to conduct and orchestrate his murder campaign against nationalists.|$|E
