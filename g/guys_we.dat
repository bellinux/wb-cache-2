[...] "The <b>guys</b> <b>we</b> [...] recruited, most of them weren't very highly ranked," [...] Stevens says. [...] "They had very good high school careers or careers at other places (transfers), but {{for one reason or}} the other they weren't seen as great players. But they all had intangibles." [...] Stevens puts a strong {{emphasis}} on education and has said he would only recruit a [...] "one and done" [...] player if he was committed to getting his degree while playing professionally.|$|E
500|$|To {{revive the}} fervor of punk, which the band felt was being {{distorted}} by new wave, the Idles sought {{to look as}} intimidating as possible. They shaved their heads, grew mohawks and wore various punk accessories. Nelson and MacKaye even drove thumbtacks into the soles of their boots so they would make an [...] "ominous clacking" [...] sound when they walked. The band's visual presentation was at odds with their demeanor; according to MacKaye, [...] "In our shows and within our own community, we were totally goofy <b>guys.</b> <b>We</b> were painfully honest — we didn't shoplift, we didn't vandalize, we didn't spray-paint. [...] We don't do anything — everybody just hates us {{because of the way}} we look".|$|E
500|$|The Cambridge {{crew was}} [...] "slightly heavier" [...] than their opponents, {{weighing}} in {{at a ceremony}} at City Hall overseen by Boris Johnson at [...] more per rower than Oxford. Thirteen of the eighteen competitors were British, the highest proportion for a decade. Of the two crews, Cambridge featured three returning Blues to Oxford's one. Oxford University Boat Club's president Ben Myers suggested [...] "we're home-grown <b>guys,</b> <b>we</b> know about the Boat Race and we're keen". Oxford were coached once again by Sean Bowden, who set their boat up as [...] "tandem rigged" [...] (where two consecutive crew row {{on the same side}} of the boat), the first time such a configuration had been used in the Boat Race since 1975. Steve Trapmore was making his debut as Cambridge's coach. Oxford's stroke, Simon Hislop, had recovered from testicular cancer in time to participate in the race.|$|E

500|$|Flo & Eddie (singers Howard Kaylan and Mark Volman) {{arrived at}} the end of {{recording}} time when the band thought all the tracks were finalised. When they learned of the vocal duo's purpose, [...] "they weren't really up for it," [...] said Kaylan: the two veterans [...] "represented establishment... e literally felt like, {{for the first time as}} session <b>guys,</b> <b>we</b> were proving ourselves". In the end, however, the band members warmed to the pair, and concluded a successful session. [...] "We did the three or four cuts that Todd had brought us up to do, and we shook hands with everybody," [...] Kaylan recalled, but as they were preparing to leave, Rundgren asked them to listen to the album's planned single. After [...] "Love My Way" [...] played, Kaylan and Volman excitedly insisted that they be allowed to record some vocals for it. [...] "We have got to sing on this one," [...] Kaylan recalls thinking. [...] "If we don't sing on this one, we're not gonna sing on the hit. This is the fucking hit!" [...] The background vocals that Flo & Eddie ultimately contributed ended up being considered one of the highlights of their lengthy career.|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Zack Handlen {{reviewed}} the episode for The A.V. Club in April, 2010. He thought that the Ferengi were a [...] "one note" [...] opponent for the crew, but that in this episode they weren't as bad as they were in [...] "". He thought that the plot made the crew look a little silly, saying [...] "Put it this way: if somebody showed up at your door and said, [...] "Hey, we want to give you this weapon you used to murder a bunch of <b>guys</b> <b>we</b> knew years ago," [...] wouldn't you be a little suspicious?" [...] He gave the episode an overall mark of C+. James Hunt reviewed the episode for the website [...] "Den of Geek" [...] in November 2012, and said that it was the best episode of the series up until that point. He thought that little touches such as the Stargazer using the movie-era effect for warp drive was a cute touch as it was meant to be an older ship than the Enterprise but also pointed out that [...] "it also means that the Picard Manoeuvre is completely invalidated, because you literally see the ship move from point A to B before the original disappears". He felt that the conflict between Picard and Bok was well realised, and that the characterisation was good.|$|E

2500|$|Politically, Parker {{describes}} himself as libertarian, as does his partner Matt Stone. Parker summed up his views with the comment, [...] "What we're sick of—and it's getting even worse—is: you either like Michael Moore or you wanna fuckin' go overseas and shoot Iraqis. There can't be a middle ground. Basically, if you think Michael Moore's full of shit, then you are a super-Christian right-wing whatever.

BioWare considered his backstory and motivations, but could not elaborate in the games due to this narrative technique.|$|E

2500|$|Writing about {{attempts}} by CAMERA {{to get a}} local Pasadena, California church to cancel an appearance by Palestinian activist Reverend Naim Ateek, Rob Eshman, Editor-in-Chief of The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles, wrote: [...] "I'm always leery when Jewish groups ride in {{from out of town}} to try to save us from the bad <b>guys.</b> <b>We</b> have plenty of sharp-eyed Jewish defense groups locally who can tussle on our behalf. It's just a bit condescending to think we rubes, out in America's second-largest Jewish city, don't know how and when to fight. Or whom." [...] Eshman later clarified that his criticism was directed specifically at CAMERA's handling of the Ateek visit, and not toward the organization in general. [...] "I think CAMERA, which in so many cases I find useful and correct, is in this case making things worse," [...] he wrote.|$|E
2500|$|The race {{restarted}} with 129 laps {{to go and}} a multi-car wreck {{brought out}} the seventh caution of the race. It started when Busch spun out and collected Brad Keselowski. Matt Kenseth, Paul Menard, Ryan Blaney, Jimmie Johnson and Elliott all suffered damage in the wreck. Busch said afterwards {{that he thought he}} [...] "just missed the bottom groove by a few inches, got loose and the wreck was on. The way that our car was restarting it felt comfortable, it felt good. That inside with the rosin and the VHT, if you don’t hit it exactly right you lose a lot of time. I tried {{to make up for it}} and got loose. I feel really bad for the Monster Energy <b>guys.</b> <b>We</b> had a win in our sights and I just drove the car at 101 percent instead of that 99 that I probably needed to be at."

2500|$|Then {{came the}} match between Nash and Hogan on the January 4, 1999, episode of Nitro. The match was {{originally}} advertised as a Starrcade rematch between Nash and Goldberg. As a result, the Georgia Dome in Atlanta {{was a complete}} sellout, with over 40,000 people watching live expecting to see the rematch. Throughout the broadcast the announcers hyped the main event as being the [...] "biggest match {{in the history of}} our sport" [...] and said that [...] "unlike the other <b>guys,</b> <b>we</b> have a real main event". Instead, Goldberg was forced to forgo his title match after being kayfabe arrested by the police for stalking Miss Elizabeth and was replaced by Hogan. Hogan faked a punch on Nash and then poked him in the chest. Nash overselled the poke in the chest by forcefully falling to the mat and allowing Hogan to pin him for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. The nWo hugged in the ring immediately afterwards until Goldberg made his way down the stage along with Lex Luger, only to have Luger blindside him and Hall taser him with a shock stick once again, just like at Starrcade. This incident has since gone down in wrestling lore as the [...] "Fingerpoke of Doom". This bait-and-switch damaged the credibility of the company as a whole, having failed to present the advertised match and using underhand tactics to sell out the arena for that night's telecast. On the same episode of Nitro, Tony Schiavone, under direction from Bischoff, revealed that Mick Foley won the WWF Title at a taped edition of Raw and mocked the WWF for making what he implied was a bad business decision (sarcastically saying [...] "huh, that's gonna put some butts in the seats"). [...] Nielsen ratings indicated that over 300,000 households changed the channel to watch the victory and shifted the ratings for the night in the WWF's favor.|$|E
