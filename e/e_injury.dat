40|$|It is well {{established}} that mechanical ventilation can injure the lung, producing an entity known as ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). There are various forms of VILI, including volutrauma (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>injury</b> caused by overdistending the lung), atelectrauma (injury due to repeated opening/closing of lung units), and biotrauma (release of mediators that can induce lung injury or aggravate pre-existing injury, potentially leading to multiple organ failure).

40|$|Managing injury risk is {{important}} for maximising athlete availability and performance. Although athletes are inherently predisposed to musculoskeletal injuries by participating in sports, etiology models have illustrated how susceptibility is influenced by repeat interactions between the athlete (i. e. intrinsic factors) and environmental stimuli (i. e. extrinsic factors). Such models also reveal that the likelihood of an injury emerging across time {{is related to the}} interconnectedness of multipe factors cumulating in a pattern of either positive (i. e. increased fitness) or negative adaptation (i. <b>e.</b> <b>injury).</b> The process of repeatedly exposing athletes to workloads in order to promote positive adaptations whilst minimisinginjury risk can be difficult to manage. Etiology models have highlighted that preventing injuries in sport, as opposed to reducing injury risk, is likely impossible given our inability to appreciate the interactions of the factors at play. Given these uncertainties, practitioners {{need to be able to}} design, deliver, and monitor risk management strategies that ensure a low susceptibility to injury is maintained during pursuits to enhance performance.

40|$|AbstractThe {{mammalian}} neocortex {{is established}} from neural stem and progenitor cells that utilize specific transcriptional {{and environmental factors}} to create functional neurons and astrocytes. Here, we examined the mechanism of Sox 2 action during neocortical neurogenesis and gliogenesis. We established a robust Sox 2 expression in neural stem and progenitor cells within the ventricular zone, which persisted until the cells exited the cell cycle. Overexpression of constitutively active Sox 2 in neural progenitors resulted in upregulation of Notch 1, recombination signal-sequence binding protein-J (RBP-J) and hairy enhancer of split 5 (Hes 5) transcripts and the Sox 2 high mobility group (HMG) domain seemed sufficient to confer these effects. While Sox 2 overexpression permitted the differentiation of progenitors into astroglia, it inhibited neurogenesis, unless the Notch pathway was blocked. Moreover, neuronal precursors engaged a serine protease(s) to eliminate the overexpressed Sox 2 protein and relieve the repression of neurogenesis. Glial precursors and differentiated astrocytes, on the other hand, maintained Sox 2 expression until they reached a quiescent state. Sox 2 expression was re-activated by signals that triggered astrocytic proliferation (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>injury,</b> mitogenic and gliogenic factors). Taken together, Sox 2 appears to act upstream of the Notch signaling pathway to maintain the cell proliferative potential and to ensure the generation of sufficient cell numbers and phenotypes in the developing neocortex...|$|E

40|$|The {{concepts}} of Athletic Identity (Brewer, Van Raalte, & Linder, 1993) and identity (Erikson, 1950, 1968) both carry notions {{of having a}} clear sense of self definition. Applied practitioners in elite professional football settings (e. g. Holt & Dunn, 2004; Harwood, 2008; Nesti & Littlewood, 2010; Nesti, 2013) have championed the notion that individuals who possess {{a clear sense of}} self, (generally) cope with the demanding nature of first team football, and the daily challenges that arise from their chosen profession (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>injury,</b> de-selection). Conversely, a small number of researchers have consistently argued that professional football club culture may not support the development of a clear sense of identity in (young) players, as it has been described as espousing notions of power, dominance, authority and insecurity (see e. g.

In this paper, we present recommendations made to the WHO by the ICD revision's Quality and Safety Topic Advisory Group (Q&S TAG) for a new conceptual approach to capturing healthcare-related harms and injuries in ICD-coded data. The Q&S TAG has grouped causes of healthcare-related harm and injuries into four categories that relate to the source of the event: (a) medications and substances, (b) procedures, (c) devices and (d) other aspects of care. Under the proposed multiple coding approach, one of these sources of harm must be coded as part of a cluster of three codes to depict, respectively, a healthcare activity as a 'source' of harm, a 'mode or mechanism' of harm and a consequence of the event summarized by these codes (i. <b>e.</b> <b>injury</b> or harm). Use of this framework depends on the implementation of a new and potentially powerful code-clustering mechanism in ICD- 11.

40|$|A safety climate {{survey was}} {{conducted}} in three Australian construction industry organizations. Workers' perceptions of their supervisors' safety response (SSR) and co-workers' safety response (CSR) were measured as facets of group safety climate. A two-dimensional schema was developed based upon the strength {{and the level of}} group safety climate. The resulting framework was used to position the 40 workgroups included in the sample within one of four group safety climate types. A non-parametric Kruskal Wallis test revealed that workgroups in which members share a strong consensus that co-workers should treat safety as a priority had a significantly lower injury frequency rate than other workgroups in the sample. While {{no significant differences between the}} injury frequency rates of workgroups positioned in the four safety climate types were found for the other facets of group safety climate, workgroups with strong and high (i. e. strongly supportive) safety climates related to supervisors' safety expectations and co-workers' actual safety behaviour reported injury frequency rates on average two-thirds the magnitude of the remaining workgroups in the sample. Although limited by the reliance on retrospective and insensitive measurement for the dependent variable (i. <b>e.</b> <b>injury</b> frequency rates), the research provides preliminary evidence for the importance of considering both the strength and level of group safety climates in the construction industry.

We aimed to study cold-induced damage (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>injury</b> {{as a consequence}} of hypothermia itself and not cold ischemia) in proximal tubular cells (PTC) in various preservation solutions presently applied and to clarify the role of mitochondria in this injury. Primary cultures of rat PTC were incubated at 4 degrees C for 24 h in culture medium, UW, Euro-Collins or HTK solution with and without the iron chelator desferal and rewarmed at 37 degrees C in culture medium. Cell damage, morphology, and apoptosis were studied and mitochondrial membrane potential was assessed by fluorescence microscopy. Cold incubation of PTC in culture medium followed by rewarming caused marked cell damage compared to warm incubation alone (LDH release 39 +/- 10 % vs. 1. 6 +/- 0. 3 %). Cold-induced damage was aggravated in all preservation solutions (LDH release 85 +/- 2 % for UW; similar in Euro-Collins and HTK). After rewarming, cells showed features suggestive for apoptosis. Desferal prevented cell injury in all solutions (e. g., 8 +/- 2 % for UW). Mitochondrial membrane potential was lost during rewarming and this loss could also be inhibited by desferal. Trifluoperazine, which is known to inhibit mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), was able to prevent cold-induced injury (LDH 85 +/- 5 % vs. 12 +/- 2 %). We conclude that cold-induced injury occurs in PTC and is aggravated by UW, Euro-Collins, and HTK solution. Iron-dependent MPT is suggested {{to play a role in}} this damage.

40|$|In 1999 {{there were}} 450 {{fatalities}} due to road crashes in Riyadh, {{the capital of}} Saudi Arabia, of which 130 were pedestrians. Hence, every forth person killed on the roads is a pedestrian. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate pedestrian-vehicle crashes in this fast-growing city with two objectives in mind: to analyze pedestrian collisions with regard to their causes, characteristics, location of injury on the victim's body, and most common patterns and to determine the potential for use of the odds ratio technique in the analysis of stratified contingency tables. Data from 638 pedestrian-vehicle crashes reported by police, during the period 1997 - 1999, were used. A systematic sampling technique was followed in which every third record was used. The analysis showed that the pedestrian fatality rate per 105 population is 2. 8. The rates were relatively high within the childhood (1 - 9 years) and young adult (10 - 19 years) groups, and the old-age groups (60 - > 80 years), which indicate that young as well as the elderly people in this city are more likely to be involved in fatal accidents of this type than are those in other age groups. The analysis revealed that 77. 1 % of pedestrians were probably struck while crossing a roadway either not in a crosswalk or where no crosswalk existed. In addition, the distribution of injuries on the victims' bodies was determined from hospital records. More than one-third of the fatal injuries were located on the head and chest. An attempt was made to conduct an association analysis between crash severity (i. <b>e.</b> <b>injury</b> or fatal) and some of the study variables using chi-square and odds ratio techniques. The categorical nature of the data helped in using these analytical techniques. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|While {{there are}} {{numerous}} health benefits that result from engaging in athletics, sport participation also comes with an intrinsic risk of injury. In {{order to understand the}} injury process (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>injury</b> risk factors and recovery variables), researchers have used various models to conceptualize preinjury risk factors and postinjury response. Although personality factors, stress, coping skills, emotional response, and other factors have been studied, self-compassion is a relatively new construct to the western world that has not been examined in the injured athlete population. Self-compassion requires being kind to oneself and taking a nonjudgmental approach to one 2 ̆ 7 s suffering. High self-compassion is related to cognitive flexibility and low levels of anxiety, depression, and stress. In addition, social support {{has been found to be}} a moderating factor of negative life stress and promotes psychological well-being, variables that may impact injury recovery. The current pilot study examines the level of self-compassion and its relationship to level of social support of injured athletes. The two hypotheses are as follows: injured athletes will have a lower level of self-compassion in comparison to the overall athlete population and among injured athletes there will be a positive relationship between level of self-compassion and perceived social support. Through electronic distribution to Division I athletes at a Midwest university, seven injured and 31 non-injured athletes completed the Self-Compassion Scale and the Multidemensional Scale of Perceived Social Support. The results indicated no significant difference in level of self-compassion between injured and non-injured athletes. In addition, self-compassion and perceived social support of injured athletes was not significantly correlated, but were significantly correlated for non-injured athletes and combined injured and non-injured athletes. Although the hypotheses of this pilot study were not supported, the significant relationship between self-compassion and perceived social support found in the non-injured and combined groups support future research with injured athletes as the results were likely limited by the small sample size...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Serious {{injuries}} {{have been}} stated {{as a public health}} priority in the UK. However, {{there appears to be a}} lack of information on population-based rates of serious injury (as defined by a recognised taxonomy of injury severity) at national level from either official statistics or research papers. We aim to address this through a search and review of literature primarily focused within the UK and Europe. Methods The review summarizes research papers on the subject of population based injury epidemiology published from 1970 to 2008. We examined critically methodological approaches in measuring injury incident rates including data sources, description of the injury pyramid, matching numerator and denominator populations as well as the relationship between injury and socioeconomic status. Results National representative rates come from research papers using official statistics sources, often focusing on mortality data alone. Few studies present data from the perspective of an injury pyramid or using a standardized measure of injury severity, i. <b>e.</b> <b>Injury</b> Severity Score (ISS). The population movement that may result in a possible numerator – denominator mismatch has been acknowledged in five research studies and in official statistics. The epidemiological profile shows over the past decades in UK and Europe a decrease in injury death rates. No major trauma population based rates are available within well defined populations across UK over recent time periods. Both fatal and non-fatal injury rates occurred more frequently in males than females with higher rates in males up to 65 years, then in females over 65 years. Road traffic crashes and falls are predominant injury mechanisms. Whereas a straightforward inverse association between injury death rates and socio-economic status has been observed, the evidence of socioeconomic inequalities in non-fatal injuries rates has not been wholly consistent. Conclusion New methodological approaches should be developed to deal with the study design inconsistencies and the knowledge gaps identified across this review. Trauma registries contain injury data from hospitals within larger regions and code injury by Abbreviated Injury Scale enabling information on severity; these may be reliable data sources to improve understanding of injury epidemiology. </p...|$|E

Results : 684 (76. 35 &#x 0025;) male and 212 (23. 66 &#x 0025;) female patients with mean age of 41. 74 &#x 00 B 1; 16. 53 years and 38. 56 &#x 00 B 1; 15. 86 years respectively were studied. Two hundred forty-two (27 &#x 0025;) patients were from hilly districts of eastern Nepal. Fall from height [in 350 (39 &#x 0025;) patients] was the commonest mode of spinal injury. Six hundred thirty-six (71 &#x 0025;) patients presented with a neurological deficit. Seven hundred thirty-three (85 &#x 0025;) patients were treated conservatively, compared to 163 (15 &#x 0025;) surgically treated patients. One hundred forty-six (22 &#x 0025;) patients were treated with operative interventions {{in the last five}} years. Conclusion : The study shows that the most vulnerable group for spine injury was the group of patients of productive age with late presentation (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>injury</b> hospital duration - 41. 64 &#x 00 B 1; 54. 24 hours) without proper pre-hospital management. The treatment modalities have changed (from conservative to surgical) {{in this part of the}} world. These specific observations help us in further planning for preventive measures and management in our setting...|$|E
40|$|Spinal {{cord injury}} (SCI) {{results in a}} well-orchestrated {{inflammatory}} response which causes secondary tissue damage. Activated macrophages contribute to this cytotoxic response, which includes damage to neurons, glia and myelin, and tissue loss that worsens functional outcomes after SCI. However, activated macrophages in the spinal cord under other conditions are not cytotoxic, such as after intraspinal injection of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), a potent demyelinating agent. Recovery from SCI may be optimized by reducing the detrimental effects of macrophages while promoting their beneficial ones. Therefore, I compared spinal cord tissue, as well as purified macrophages, from mice after SCI (cytotoxic response) and intraspinal LPC injection (non-cytotoxic response). As a first step {{to carry out this}} work, I characterized the injury parameters for SCI contusion injury (i. <b>e.</b> <b>injury</b> force and spinal cord displacement) in mice using the Infinite Horizons impactor (Chapter 2). This lesioning model was used in other work for the thesis. The role T cells may play in mediating macrophage activation after LPC microinjection and SCI was also assessed using Nude mice (Chapter 3). Next, Affymetrix GeneChip analysis was carried out on spinal cord tissue obtained {{at the peak of the}} macrophage response after SCI and intraspinal LPC injection to identify potential candidate genes that may control the divergent inflammatory responses (Chapter 4). Several potential genes were identified. I next characterized the expression and role of one of these genes, MAPK activated protein kinase 2 (MK 2), and showed that it mediates secondary tissue damage after SCI via several mechanisms (Chapter 5). The differences in gene expression profiles of macrophages purified from the spinal cord after SCI and LPC-injection were also assessed (Chapter 6). This microarray analysis of macrophages led to the identification of 10 novel candidate genes, two of which were validated at the protein level. Finally, I also examined the expression and role of secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) in SCI (Chapter 7). Using a combination of knockout/overexpressing transgenic mice and recombinant SLPI, I found that SLPI mediates protective anti-inflammatory effects after SCI. In conclusion, work done for this thesis has led to the identification of several novel molecules that influence the inflammatory response after injury and thus have led to the identification of potentially novel targets for the development of pharmacological approaches to treat acute SCI...|$|E
40|$|Mortality {{data are}} {{routinely}} tabulated utilizing a single underlying {{cause of death}} which identifies only one cause that is considered to have initiated {{the sequence of events}} leading to death. However, seldom is there a single factor involved in a death and often other diseases or conditions are contributory, such as diabetes and heart disease. The practice of publishing single cause of death data results in much loss of information as to factors involved in the death. For injuries this has been even more problematic because two types of ICD- 9 codes are used to describe injuries, one which describes the nature of the <b>injury</b> (<b>e.</b> g., head <b>injury),</b> and the other which describes the mechanism of the <b>injury</b> (<b>e.</b> g., fall). By convention only the external cause (e. g., fall) is routinely published. 1, 2 Multiple cause of death information is obtained from death certificates and can be coded using several different automated coding systems (ACME, TRANSAX, MICAR, etc.) that are described elsewhere. 3 The implementation of automated multiple cause of death coding allows for: 1) the coding of all the reported conditions on the death certificate and, 2) the utilization of a set of standardized coding rules for determining the Underlying Cause of Death thereby increasing consistency of death certificate coding. In the United States, the routine coding o...|$|R
40|$|Liability of {{air traffic}} {{participants}} {{in case of}} bird strike is very complex matter from different aspects. This kind of liability varies from case to case. From human aspect, in the extreme situation, bird strike accident may cause higher degree consequences i. <b>e.</b> <b>injuries</b> or death of persons (passengers, crew members or, in case of the hardest accidents, third persons on the ground). From financial point of view, there are different direct and indirect costs, profit losses and goodwill loss. Therefore, these circumstances may have great and very significant influence on further market position of air traffic participants, and especially on future reliance of their users. On one side, the first party who may suffer significant material damage in case of bird strike is aircraft operator. Therefore, an owner of aircraft, or an aircraft operator, is entitled to demand reparation for caused damage in out of court negotiation process or by legal proceedings. On the other side, the first party to which damage compensation claim will be put is airport operator. During above mentioned processes, a liability of air traffic participant may be established. However, an airport operator has on its disposal {{a broad spectrum of}} different possibilities to escape liability, or at least a part of it. This paper tries to explain how to do that...|$|R
40|$|Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) {{activity}} {{is the most}} frequently relied upon reference standard for monitoring liver injury in humans and nonclinical species. However, limitations of ALT include a lack of specificity for diagnosing liver <b>injury</b> (<b>e.</b> g., present in muscle and the gastrointestinal tract), its inability to monitor certain types of hepatic <b>injury</b> (<b>e.</b> g., biliary <b>injury),</b> and ambiguity with respect to interpretation of modest or transient elevations (< 3 × upper limit of normal). As an initial step to both understand and qualify additional biomarkers of hepatotoxic-ity that may add value to ALT, three novel candidates have been evaluated in 34 acute toxicity rat studies: (1) alpha-glutathione S-transferase (GSTA), (2) arginase 1 (ARG 1), and (3) 4 -hydroxy-phenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPD). The performance of each bio-marker was assessed for its diagnostic ability to accurately detect hepatocellular <b>injury</b> (i. <b>e.,</b> microscopic histopathology), singularly or in combination with ALT. All three biomarkers, either alone or in combination with ALT, improved specificity when compared with ALT alone. Hepatocellular necrosis and/or degeneration were detected by all three biomarkers {{in the majority of}} animals. ARG 1 and HPD were also sensitive in detecting single-cell necrosis in the absence of more extensive hepatocellular necrosis/degeneration. ARG 1 showed the best sensitivity for detecting biliary injury with or without ALT. All the biomarkers were able to detect biliary injury with single-cell necrosis. Taken together, these novel live...|$|R
