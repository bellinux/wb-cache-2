As much as I'd read the script and theorized and practiced philosophy, I knew in that moment that I was so not ready for death." [...] For his various characters, the actor assumed a {{different}} posture for each persona. As the conquistador, Jackman was upright and forward-leaning to evoke an unstoppable nature. As the scientist, the actor hunched over with a dedicated focus on his character's work, being weighed down by the [...] "world on his shoulders." [...] As the space traveler, Jackman practiced the state of zen but also exhibited a continued persistence in his endeavor.|$|E

[...] On a later trip to India she apologised for her behaviour, admitting that her remarks to Shetty {{could be seen as}} racist. In a video on the BBC News website, Goody said: ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2013, Mark Walport, the UK Government Chief Scientific Adviser {{and head}} of the Government Office for Science, had this to say: [...] "My view scientifically is {{absolutely}} clear: homoeopathy is nonsense, it is non-science. My advice to ministers is clear: that there is no science in homoeopathy. The most it can have is a placebo effect – it is then a political decision whether they spend money on it or not." [...] His predecessor, John Beddington, referring to his views on homeopathy being [...] "fundamentally ignored" [...] by the Government, said: [...] "The only one [...] <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>was</b> homoeopathy, which is mad. It has no underpinning of scientific basis. In fact, all the science points {{to the fact that it}} is not at all sensible. The clear evidence is saying this is wrong, but homoeopathy is still used on the NHS." ...|$|E

2500|$|Reading about Grandin renewed Gerson Saines' [...] "energy, {{motivation}} and spirit" [...] {{in coping with}} her son's condition. [...] "Temple's story brought me hope and (her mother)'s story gave me direction and purpose," [...] Gerson Saines said in a later interview. [...] "Parents {{of a child with}} autism everywhere need to hear it, functionally and spiritually. I knew this story had to be told and given my access as a talent representative in the entertainment industry, I felt it was my responsibility to make that happen." [...] Through Grandin's agent, Gerson Saines asked to meet Grandin for lunch. [...] "She came in wearing her cowgirl shirt—-in her very Temple way, in her very Temple walk. I realized that there were people staring at her, and in a different lifetime I might have been one of them, but all <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>was,</b> 'I can't believe how lucky I am to be here.

60|$|In my town house, in Oakland, I {{finished}} {{the stock of}} liquor and wilfully refused to purchase more. It was no use, because, unfortunately, there remained {{in the bottom of}} the liquor cabinet a case of beer. In vain I tried to write. Now beer is a poor substitute for strong waters: besides, I didn't like beer, yet all <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>was</b> that beer so singularly accessible {{in the bottom of the}} cabinet. Not until I had drunk a pint of it did the words begin to reel off, and the thousand were reeled off to the tune of numerous pints. The worst of it was that the beer caused me severe heart-burn; but despite the discomfort I soon finished off the case.|$|E

He looks one. And then, when he began to preach, it was maddening. I felt all the time that he could say {{something}} helpful, if he only would. But he didn't. It was all about the sufficiency of grace,--whatever that may be. He didn't explain it. He didn't give me one notion as to how to cope a little better with the frightful complexities of the modern lives we live, or how to stop quarrelling with Phil when he stays at the office and is late for dinner." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{heard them}} at high words {{on my way}} upstairs, and waited {{a little on the}} landing. The Captain was in one of his furious rages; Mr. Varleigh was firm and cool as usual. After {{listening}} for a minute or so, I heard enough (in my opinion) to justify me in entering the room. I caught my master in the act of lifting his cane--threatening to strike Mr. Varleigh. He instantly dropped his hand, and turned on me in a fury at my intrusion. Taking no notice of this outbreak of temper, I gave him his friend's card, and went out. A talk followed in voices too low for me to hear outside the room, and then the Captain approached the door. I got out of his way, feeling very uneasy about what was to come next. I could not presume to question Mr. Varleigh. The only thing <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>was</b> to tell the young lady's aunt what I had seen and heard, and to plead with Miss Laroche herself to make peace between them. When I inquired for the ladies at their lodgings, I was told that they had left Maplesworth.|$|E

I wanted to get into Ferguson's--everybody in Madison knew about Ferguson's, what a grand store it was,--but I couldn't. And after a while I got a place at the embroidery counter at Pratt's. That's a department store, too, you know. It looked fine, but it wasn't long before I fell wise to a few things." [...] (She relapsed into slang occasionally.) [...] "Have you ever tried to stand on your feet for nine hours, where you couldn't sit down for a minute? Say, when Florry Kinsley and me--she was the girl I roomed with--would get home at night, often we'd just lie down and laugh and cry, we were so tired, and our feet hurt so. We were too used up sometimes to get up and cook supper on the little stove we had. And sitting around a back bedroom all evening was worse than Madison. We'd go out, tired as we were, and walk the streets." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{then try}} the next word in my {{specimen}} page of Curtis; {{but there is}} no 'Phalangium' at all in Loudon's index. And now I have neither time nor mind for more search, but will give, in due place, such account as I can {9} of my own dwarf branched lily, which I shall call St. Bruno's, as well as this Liliastrum--no offence to the saint, I hope. For it grows very gloriously on the limestones of Savoy, presumably, therefore, at the Grande Chartreuse; though I did not notice it there, and made a very unmonkish use of it when I gathered it last:--There was a pretty young English lady at the table-d'hôte, in the Hotel du Mont Blanc at St. Martin's,[3] and I wanted to get speech of her, and didn't know how. So all <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>was</b> to go half-way up the Aiguille de Varens, to gather St. Bruno's lilies; and I made a great cluster of them, and put wild roses all around them as I came down. I never saw anything so lovely; and I thought to present this to her before dinner,--but when I got down, she had gone away to Chamouni. My Fors always treated me like that, in affairs of the heart.|$|E

60|$|I {{had been}} for some hours {{extremely}} pressed by the necessities of nature; which was no wonder, it being almost two days since I had last disburdened myself. I was under great difficulties between urgency and shame. The best expedient <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of,</b> <b>was</b> to creep into my house, which I accordingly did; and shutting the gate after me, I {{went as far as}} the length of my chain would suffer, and discharged my body of that uneasy load. But this was the only time I was ever guilty of so uncleanly an action; for which I cannot but hope the candid reader will give some allowance, after he has maturely and impartially considered my case, and the distress I was in. From this time my constant practice was, as soon as I rose, to perform that business in open air, at the full extent of my chain; and due care was taken every morning before company came, that the offensive matter should be carried off in wheel-barrows, by two servants appointed for that purpose. I would not have dwelt so long upon a circumstance that, perhaps, at first sight, may appear not very momentous, if I had not thought it necessary to justify my character, in point of cleanliness, to the world; which, I am told, some of my maligners have been pleased, upon this and other occasions, to call in question.|$|E
