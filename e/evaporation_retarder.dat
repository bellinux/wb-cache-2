It is also used in lubricating oils, and as a solvent <b>evaporation</b> <b>retarder</b> in paint removers. Its amide is used as an anti-foaming agent in detergents, floor polishes and dripless candles. Reduction of behenic acid yields behenyl alcohol.|$|E
40|$|The {{long-term}} deflection {{behavior of}} long-span prestressed concrete box girder bridges has often deceived engineers monitoring the deflections. Measuring small deflections {{over the first}} few years, the engineer is tempted to extrapolate and optimistically expect the deflections to remain small, only to be unpleasantly surprised when, after several years, the deflections suddenly accelerate. Without realistic calculations, one may even misinterpret the reasons for such a sudden acceleration of deflection and undertake inappropriate corrective actions that may induce excessive bending moments, overstressing the bridge, and possibly causing serious damage. In these box girder bridges, the top slab typically has a uniform or nearly uniform thickness of about 200 mm (8 in.), while the bottom slab thickness can vary from about 200 mm (8 in.) at midspan to 1 m (3. 3 ft) (or greater) at the supports. For a concrete slab, the rate of drying (and therefore the rate of shrinkage and drying creep) is roughly inversely proportional to the square of its thickness 1 - 6 and is further affected by differences in the temperature and relative humidity at its two surfaces. These differences are further magnified by solar heating on some exterior surfaces {{as well as by}} installation of an <b>evaporation</b> <b>retarder</b> (for example, an asphalt wearing course) on the top slab. Although analysis methods for redundant structures with differential creep and shrinkage in the cross sections are well known, 7 - 9 creep and shrinkage effects on prestressed concrete box girder bridges are usually analyzed assuming the shrinkage strain and cree...|$|E
