Lyrically, {{the song is}} about how Aguilera wishes to [...] "wipe the slate clean" [...] with a former lover and [...] "reconcile an old romance". She knows that she has wronged him, but is asking {{to be given a}} second chance. Andrew Hampp for Billboard noted that this sentiment is revealed by Aguilera in the lyrics [...] "If I could do undo that I hurt you/ I would do anything for us to make it through". The song begins with the chords of a piano as Aguilera sings [...] "I know there's hurt/ I know there's pain/ But people change/ Lord, knows I've been no saint/ In my own way/ Regret choices I've made/ How I <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> I'm sorry?/ How <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> I'm sorry?." [...] On the chorus, the lyrics are hopeful that she can right any wrongs she may have committed: [...] "Draw me a smile, and save me tonight/ I'll be your blank page waiting for you to bring me to life/ Paint me a heart, let me be your art/ I am a blank page waiting for life to start/ Let our hearts start and beat as one together/ Let our hearts start and beat as one forever". The arrangement of the minimalist piano composition is [...] "fiery" [...] yet [...] "spare". Aside from garnering innumerable comparisons to Aguilera's own song [...] "Beautiful", the composition of [...] "Blank Page" [...] was subject to critique by Jim Farber writing for New York Daily News. He criticised the song for replicating the structure and lyrical content of [...] "Someone Like You", a song performed by English singer-songwriter Adele: ...|$|E

During filming of a flying stunt, one of the wires that was tied to Hrithik Roshan broke, causing him to fall 50 feet, though he landed safely on a shop's canopy. Hrithik {{described}} the incident as a [...] "freak accident", stating, [...] "I was skydiving to my death till I fell on a six-feet-long canopy of a shop that was out because of the slight drizzle. The canopy had iron rods. But I missed those rods too. What <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>say?</b> I guess the right word to describe the situation would be jadoo (magic)." [...] Roshan also suffered other injuries during the film's production. He tore the hamstring in his right leg during a circus scene, singed his hair while running through fire in another action scene, and broke his thumb and toe during strenuous training for the wirework.|$|E
500|$|TV Guide {{referred}} to Todd as a breakout character. At {{the height of}} his popularity, which was called [...] "Todd-mania" [...] and [...] "the Todd Manning phenomenon", Howarth was disturbed that so many women were attracted to Todd and that the show's writers had begun to redeem the character. [...] In a September 1995 interview with The Hollywood Reporter, the publication stated that Howarth was troubled that [...] "his villainous character became such a fan favorite". In October 1995, Howarth told SOD, [...] "People have {{come up to me and}} said, 'My 7-year-old loves you.' What <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> to that? I'm not going to tell them, 'Don't let your 7-year-old watch TV.' But I have to say, it's disturbing." [...] He gave credit to the show's writers for Todd's popularity, saying that the rapists' trial was well constructed and added, [...] "I think, right now, we're just riding the wave of something that started last summer. Beyond that, I don't really know why people like Todd".|$|E

2500|$|Howarth {{went on to}} say Todd and Marty {{suddenly}} bonding did {{not make}} sense and that he could not, in good conscience, promote the story of Todd Lord, who had become a likeable character. [...] "If the rape had been an unrealistic, soapy thing, then it wouldn't matter. But because it was so in-depth and so brutal, to show Todd and Marty having drinks together in Rodi's [...] to show Marty feeling safe and comfortable with Todd [...] is bizarre," [...] he said.
