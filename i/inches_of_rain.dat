It was dry between July and October 2013. A mid-20th-century report estimated that the rate of seepage of water from the surface into mine workings was 8.11 gallons per minute per <b>inch</b> <b>of</b> <b>rain.</b> The report estimated that the rate of seepage of water from the streambed into mine workings was 15.20 gallons per minute per <b>inch</b> <b>of</b> <b>rain.</b>|$|R

A 1952 report estimated {{that the rate of}} surface seepage into mine workings was 8.35 gallons per minute per <b>inch</b> <b>of</b> <b>rain.</b> The report also estimated that the rate of streambed seepage into mine workings was 17.86 gallons per minute per <b>inch</b> <b>of</b> <b>rain.</b> In 2002, the pH of the creek ranged from 4.8 to 5.5, with an average of 5.05.|$|R
5|$|July 18, 2015: Some of Hurricane Dolores's {{moisture}} and remnants were directed into Arizona, bringing showers and thunderstorms. Up to 1 <b>inch</b> <b>of</b> <b>rain</b> {{was recorded in}} some places. The heavy rain triggered some flash floods and mudslides near Phoenix.|$|R
5|$|The {{remnants}} of Dean eventually moved up into Oklahoma, where it caused heavy rainfall, forcing roads to close and rescues to be made.

About 2 <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> <b>rain</b> fell in the state as well. Strong rip currents and waves caused about a dozen swimmers to be rescued at Daytona Beach. Damage totaled to no more than $25,800 (2017 USD).|$|E
5|$|Precipitation, {{especially}} rain, has {{a dramatic}} effect on agriculture. All plants {{need at least}} some water to survive, therefore rain (being {{the most effective means}} of watering) is important to agriculture. While a regular rain pattern is usually vital to healthy plants, {{too much or too little}} rainfall can be harmful, even devastating to crops. Drought can kill crops and increase erosion, while overly wet weather can cause harmful fungus growth. Plants need varying amounts of rainfall to survive. For example, certain cacti require small amounts of water, while tropical plants may need up to hundreds of <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> <b>rain</b> per year to survive.|$|E
2500|$|In {{terms of}} precipitation, Barrow has a desert climate, and averages less than [...] "rainfall equivalent" [...] per year.

50|$|Rimed snow {{refers to}} snowflakes that are {{partially}} or completely coated in tiny frozen water droplets called 'rime'. Rime forms on a snowflake when {{it passes through}} a super-cooled cloud. Snowflakes that are heavily rimed typically produce very heavy and wet snow, with snow to liquid ratios in the 5-1 (i.e. five <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> snow per <b>inch</b> <b>of</b> <b>rain)</b> to 9-1 range.|$|R
5000|$|In Dominica, {{the storm}} {{produced}} intermittent rainfall and gusty winds but no major damage. to Anguilla, damage was minor to moderate.

[...] Those islands was mildly affected by Georges.|$|R

50|$|Rains {{are due to}} {{southwest}} monsoons. The typical monsoon season {{goes from}} 15 June till mid-September, contributing 32-35 <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> annual <b>rains.</b> 95% <b>of</b> <b>rains</b> occur during monsoon season.|$|R
25|$|From June 19–20, 2012, Duluth {{suffered}} the worst flood in its history, caused by nine <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> <b>rain</b> {{throughout the course}} of thirty hours. Combined with its rocky sediments, hard soil and 43 streams and creeks, the city could not handle the massive rainfall.|$|E
25|$|During {{the summer}} of 2016, the road was closed on several {{occasions}} due to the Soberanes Fire.

25|$|On February 28, 2011, the North Fork Creek, part {{of which}} runs beneath the Lehman's store, overflowed its banks, flash {{flooding}} the store. The 50-year flood was caused by thawing temperatures, an ice and snow pack that clogged a five-foot culvert that drained water away from the store site, and a storm that brought 1/2 <b>inch</b> <b>of</b> <b>rain</b> in less than 15 minutes.|$|R

25|$|The Highlands Gallery {{contains}} {{native plants}} from South to Central America. Its plants collect {{moisture from the}} air, and from water that drips from the trees above. Due to its drastically higher elevation (3,000–10,000 feet), this room is kept cooler than the Lowlands Gallery (around 65°F) and is kept {{at a very high}} level of humidity {{through the use of a}} misting system, as the Highland Tropics typically receive 200 <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> <b>rain</b> per year.|$|E
50|$|On June 22, 1999, a 24-year-old {{medical student}} from Michigan {{apparently}} {{set out from}} a remote trailhead where his rental car was found.
