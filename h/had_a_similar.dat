5|$|Morocco <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> {{effect on}} Rix {{as it did}} on many artists who visited. Paintings were created in high-keyed colours that {{captured}} the intense north African light, and most works focussed on the figures, dress and activity of the people, or the local architecture.|$|E
5|$|Pokémon Colosseum was {{developed}} by the Japanese game developer Genius Sonority, and published by Nintendo. Just as Nintendo 64 predecessors Pokémon Stadium and Pokémon Stadium 2 had served as home console counterparts to the first- and second-generation handheld titles, Colosseum <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> role for the third generation.|$|E
5|$|The mosque at Ajdabiya in Libya <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> plan, {{although}} {{it did not have}} the same monumental entrance. Like the Mahdiya mosque, for the same ideological reasons, the Ajdabiya mosque did not have a minaret.|$|E

5|$|A 2011 genetic {{study showed}} that two {{examined}} specimens of the Columbian mammoth were grouped within a subclade of woolly mammoths. This suggests that the two populations interbred and produced fertile offspring. A North American type formerly referred to as M. jeffersonii may be a hybrid between the two species. A 2015 study suggested that the animals in the range where M. columbi and M. primigenius overlapped formed a metapopulation of hybrids with varying morphology. It also suggested that Eurasian M. primigenius <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> relationship with M. trogontherii, in areas where their range overlapped.|$|E
5|$|Genes {{related to}} FLCN and {{diseases}} similar to BHD {{have been found}} in dogs, fruit flies, rats, and mice. In German Shepherd dogs, missense mutations in the canine ortholog of FLCN cause a similar phenotype to human BHD—kidney cancers (in this case, mutifocal renal cystadenocarcinoma) and skin tumors (nodular dermatofibrosis). They <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> pattern of tumorigenesis to human BHD in that the skin lesions were heterozygous for the FLCN mutation and the renal tumors were likely caused by loss of heterozygosity. Female German shepherds with a FLCN mutation are also prone to uterine leiomyomas.|$|E
5|$|Gerardo Mazzetta {{and colleagues}} (1998) {{propose that the}} horns might also {{have been used to}} injure or kill small prey. Though horn cores are blunt, they may have <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> form to modern bovid horns if there was a keratinous covering. However, this would be the only {{reported}} example of horns being used as hunting weapons in animals.|$|E

5|$|Head pain {{occurs in}} 50–75% {{of all cases}} of {{vertebral}} artery dissection. It tends to be located {{at the back of}} the head, either on the affected side or in the middle, and develops gradually. It is either dull or pressure-like in character or throbbing. About half of those with VAD consider the headache distinct, while the remainder have <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> headache before. It is suspected that VAD with headache as the only symptom is fairly common; 8% of all cases of vertebral and carotid dissection are diagnosed on the basis of pain alone.|$|E
5|$|Jobs {{unveiled}} the iPad 2 at a March 2, 2011, press conference. About 33% thinner {{than its predecessor}} and 15% lighter, the iPad 2 has a better processor, a dual core Apple A5 that Apple says is {{twice as fast as}} its predecessor for CPU operations and up to nine times as fast for GPU operations. The iPad 2 includes front and back cameras that support the FaceTime videophone application, as well as a three-axis gyroscope. It retained the original's 10‑hour battery life and <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> pricing scheme.|$|E
5|$|Lemaire {{has since}} re-entered retirement, and was {{replaced}} by former Florida head coach Peter DeBoer on July 19, 2011. The team showed greater offensive prowess during the 2011–12 season, employing a more aggressive forecheck centered on Ilya Kovalchuk. Under DeBoer's system, according to Lamoriello, the Devils' defenseman were often sent into the offensive zone to apply pressure on the opposing team's defense. After DeBoer's dismissal, Adam Oates <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> approach improving the Devils' offense, investing on the versatility of the forwards.|$|E

5|$|Oesau was aged 30 at {{the time}} of his death. He had a total of 127 kills gained over 300 missions. 27 were Spitfires, 14 four-engined bombers, 44 were scored on the Eastern Front and 9 in the Spanish Civil War. In {{recognition}} of his record, JG 1 received the title Oesau in honor of its fallen Geschwaderkommodore. Only Werner Mölders <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> honor with JG 51 Mölders. Walter Oesau is buried in Meldorf, close to his birthplace and the town museum (Dithmarscher Landesmuseum) has documented his last journey in pictures.|$|E
5|$|One {{interpretation}} on how megalodon appeared {{was that}} it was a robust-looking shark, and may have <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> build to the great white shark. The jaws may have been blunter and wider than the great white, and the fins would have also been similar in shape, though thicker due to its size. It may have had a pig-eyed appearance, in that it had deep-set and small eyes.|$|E
5|$|One species, {{the cattle}} egret, was {{historically}} an African bird. In the 20th century this bird colonized North America {{and is now}} found throughout the lower 48 states of the United States. The cattle egret is the only Old World bird to establish itself in North America in historical times without being introduced by humans. As such, it is not marked as introduced on this list. Neither is the glossy ibis, which probably <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> history.|$|E

5|$|Russell T Davies {{scrapped}} a {{glass bowl}} storyline for the Partners in Crime slot in Series 4, as he decided {{this would make}} the story too contained, and that wasn't the tone he wanted. In his book The Writer's Tale, Davies remarked that he was glad he abandoned the idea, because The Simpsons Movie <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> premise.|$|E
5|$|Russell was a {{prominent}} businessman, well respected among his peers and the community. Waddell was co-owner of the firm Morehead, Waddell & Co. After Morehead was bought out and retired, Waddell merged his company with Russell's, changing the name to Waddell & Russell. In 1855 they took on a new partner, Alexander Majors, and founded the company of Russell, Majors & Waddell. They held government contracts for delivering army supplies to the western frontier, and Russell <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> idea for contracts with the U.S. Government for fast mail delivery.|$|E

A television show within the canon of Canadian teen vampire film My Babysitter's a Vampire and the television series sequel called Dusk is a parody of Twilight.|$|E
5|$|The German Type IXA {{submarine}} was a sub-class of the German Type IX submarine {{built for}} Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine between 1937 and 1938. These U-boats were designed between 1935 and 1936 and {{were intended to}} be fairly large ocean-going submarines. The inspiration for the Type IXA submarine came from the German Type IA submarine, which <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> diving depth and identical submerged horsepower.|$|E
5|$|The {{house was}} {{substantially}} remodelled in 1684, following Henry Hare's {{marriage to the}} dowager Duchess of Somerset, {{and much of the}} existing south facade dates from this time. The facade's central tower with a belvedere is a motif of the English Renaissance of the late 16th/early 17th centuries. Hatfield House, also close to London, <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> central tower constructed in 1611, as does Blickling Hall in Norfolk, built circa 1616.|$|E
