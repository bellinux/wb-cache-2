He ran for 300yards <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>two</b> starts against Ohio State, {{which is the most}} by a Northwestern quarterback in successive contests. He was named the team's offensive big playmaker for the game.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} University of Minnesota, Grant was {{selected}} {{in both the}} NFL and NBA Draft. He was selected {{in the first round}} (fourteenth overall) of the 1950 NFL Draft by the Philadelphia Eagles and fourth round (forty-second overall) selection of the Minneapolis Lakers in the 1950 NBA draft. He played thirty-five games during the 1949–50 NBA season and signed with the Lakers for the 1950–51 NBA season. He chose to continue his basketball career with the Lakers because they were local and because he was offered a raise to stay for the season. Grant's close personal friend, Sid Hartman, was the Lakers' general manager, which may have influenced his decision to remain with the team. He averaged 2.6 points per game <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>two</b> seasons as a reserve with the Lakers and {{was a member of the}} 1950 championship team.|$|E
50|$|Tabares {{moved to}} Spain in January 2006, joining Segunda División club CD Castellón and scoring 20 league goals <b>in</b> <b>his</b> first <b>two</b> full seasons combined.

5|$|After {{starting}} a July 4 {{game against the}} Braves (which he won), Richard was sent into the bullpen to add Tom Griffin into the Astros' starting rotation. He made three relief appearances against the Montreal Expos before making a start against the Los Angeles Dodgers on July 27. Four days later, Richard threw his first shutout against the Dodgers, in which he gave up just five hits and struck out nine batters. Nineteen days later, Richard pitched another complete game, this time giving up two runs while striking out nine and walking three batters. He concluded the season with six wins and two losses in 16 total games, 10 of which he started. He finished with a 4.00ERA, and struck out 75batters in 72innings. He walked 38batters, giving him a ratio of 4.75walks per nine innings, which was lower than the ratio he had had <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>two</b> previous minor league seasons.|$|E
5|$|As a writer, Sorabji is {{best known}} for his music criticism, the bulk of which is {{contained}} in the books Around Music (1932) and Mi contra fa: The Immoralisings of a Machiavellian Musician (1947). He contributed to various well-known publications dealing with music in England, including The New Age, The New English Weekly, The Musical Times and Musical Opinion. He revised some of those articles and included them <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>two</b> books. His writings also devote attention to various non-musical issues: he was, among other things, a critic of British rule in India and a proponent of birth control and legalised abortion. Being homosexual at a time when homosexual acts were illegal in England, he wrote of the biological and social realities that homosexuals faced during much of his lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Barnes {{was still}} {{unavailable}} for the Fourth Test, but Brown was not recalled to open with Morris; instead, Hassett {{was promoted to}} open with Morris, while the teenaged Harvey came into the middle-order. Although Hassett failed with only 13 and 17 <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>two</b> innings, Harvey struck 112 in the first innings, before Australia chased down 404 {{on the final day}} to set a world record for the highest successful run-chase in Test cricket and won by seven wickets.|$|E

5|$|Chopin {{took the}} new salon genre of the nocturne, invented by the Irish {{composer}} John Field, {{to a deeper}} level of sophistication. He {{was the first to}} write ballades and scherzi as individual concert pieces. He essentially established a new genre with his own set of free-standing preludes (Op.28, published 1839). He exploited the poetic potential of the concept of the concert étude, already being developed in the 1820s and 1830s by Liszt, Clementi and Moscheles, <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>two</b> sets of studies (Op.10 published in 1833, Op.25 in 1837).|$|E
5|$|Gilchrist's form dipped momentarily, {{with a rare}} king pair (two golden {{ducks in}} the same match) in the Second Test in Kolkata and just two runs <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>two</b> innings in Chennai. He was out LBW four {{consecutive}} {{times in the last}} two Tests, three of these to Harbhajan Singh, who took 32 wickets in the series to end Australia's run by inflicting a 2–1 series loss. His one-day form remained strong, with 172 runs at 43.00 in the ODI series in India, as Australia bounced back to win the series 3–2. During this series he captained the ODI team for the first time, winning all three of the matches under his captaincy.|$|E
5|$|Having {{been a fan}} of Kōji Yakusho's acting, Miike made it a {{priority}} that he be cast in the leading role. In addition, he sought younger actors to play the assassins, in particular Sousuke Takaoka and Takayuki Yamada, with whom Miike had worked <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>two</b> films, Crows Zero (2007) and its sequel Crows Zero 2 (2009). The film's screenplay was written by Daisuke Tengan, who had also written the screenplay for Miike's film Audition (1999).|$|E

5|$|He {{started his}} {{professional}} career at Hartlepool United in February 1978, {{after failing to}} win a contract at Chesterfield. He was coached by Billy Horner to become a strong centre-forward, using his natural strength and power to retain possession in attacking positions. Financial difficulties forced the club to sell him on to Leyton Orient for £25,000 in March 1982. After failing to impress <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>two</b> years in London, he was moved on to York City for £15,000 in March 1984. He played seven games in the club's Fourth Division title winning season in 1983–84, before transferring to Scunthorpe United for £40,000 in March 1986. He did not settle at the club, but in the summer he {{was fortunate enough to}} win a £60,000 move up through three tiers to First Division side Coventry City.|$|E
5|$|Karthik {{steadily}} {{ascended the}} youth ranks. He made his debut for Tamil Nadu Under-14s in early 1999, and after scoring 78 and 26 <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>two</b> interstate matches, {{was promoted to}} the Under-16 team in November, still less than 14 and half years old. After spending the entire 19992000 season in the Under-16s, {{he was promoted to}} the Under-19 team {{at the start of the}} 200001 season, aged 15 years and 3 months, despite scoring only 52 runs at 10.40 at Under-16 level and still being eligible for that age group. The selectors’ decision did not result in increased productivity from Karthik; he scored 133 runs at 22.16 in seven innings with a top-score of 39, and was demoted back to the Under-16s in November, and responded immediately with 124 in his first innings against Karnataka. He added two further fifties in the season, including a 99 against Kerala. Karthik ended with 367 runs at 52.42 for the season.|$|E
5|$|Kartik struggled, taking 2/129 against East {{and then}} 0/178 {{in the first}} innings as North Zone {{accumulated}} 8/690 declared. He then had to endure the humiliation of not being trusted to bowl in the second innings as North reached 8/233. In the last match against South, Kartik could only aggregate 1/87. Although Kartik had scored 45 and 27 <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>two</b> innings, he totalled only three Duleep Trophy wickets {{at an average of}} 131.33. The selectors were unsatisfied by these performances, and despite a shoulder injury to Kumble, Kartik was discarded as India hosted Australia in the 2001 Border Gavaskar Trophy. Harbhajan was recalled and took 32 wickets at 17 to engineer an Indian series win and permanently establish himself as India's leading spinner alongside Kumble. Kartik played in one more match for Railways {{at the end of the}} season, and his poor season continued, managing only a total of 2/152, although he did score 79 with the bat.|$|E
