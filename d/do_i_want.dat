25|$|The fact of {{the matter}} is that we’re in our thirties now and that breakup {{happened}} ten years ago. As a human being you just don't want that kind of karma. We did a lot of shit talking, and they did a lot of shit talking, so I just called everybody up and invited them to my house and said ‘hey, listen, we’re in our thirties now, I’m sorry for whatever I said, I'm sure you guys didn’t mean what you said–you guys were upset because I split up the band and we were upset because of whatever. Let’s be friends again. But <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to reunite and play fucking 15-year old songs? Well, it would be like asking you, ‘do you want to get back together with your first girlfriend?’ You learn some amazing things together, but I just shudder at the thought. We were a band that went out on top, which is good, but it’s just a coincidence. We were also a band that had been together for seven years, and for six of those years played to nobody and had a great time but were also on the verge of splitting up many times before that. It’s an old relationship. People would like to think of it as unfinished business because to them we went out when we were most popular, but that has nothing to do with the creative element. As far as the creative element went, it very much was finished business. That’s why I ended the band! Now, thank god, fucking ten years later, we're not holding a grudge and we’re all cool with it. People pick up on the difference of attitude and think 'oh, this could mean a possible reunion', but that’s just them projecting their own desires upon us.|$|E
500|$|After {{the film}} was {{released}} and was criticized, Ben Affleck said that the film inspired him {{to take on the}} role of Batman in , saying; [...] "That’s the movie I want to <b>do.</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> {{to be a part of}} that [...] Part of it was I wanted for once to get one of these movies and do it right—to do a good version. I hate Daredevil so much." ...|$|E

On selecting Elba, del Toro stated: [...] "This is a {{movie where}} I have {{had to deal with}} more dialogue than ever, and the way I cast the movie was—who <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to hear say these things? Who <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> Charlie Hunnam to go against? Who can really tell Charlie Hunnam 'sit down and listen'?" [...] In another interview, the director said: [...] "I wanted to have Idris not be the blonde, square-jawed, Anglo, super hip marine that knows [...] I wanted somebody that could bring a lot of authority, but that you could feel {{the weight of the world}} on his shoulders. When I watched Luther, that's the essence of the character… Luther is carrying literally the evils of the world on his shoulders. He's doing penance for all humanity… Idris is one of those actors that is capable of embodying humanity, in almost like a Rodin sculpture-type, larger than life, almost like a Russian realism statue, you know, big hands, all the turmoil of humanity in his eyes. I wanted somebody that you could have doubts internally, and very few guys can do that." [...] To prepare for the role, Elba watched footage of politicians David Cameron and Barack Obama, as well as Russell Crowe in Gladiator and Mel Gibson in Braveheart. Del Toro initially offered the role to Tom Cruise, who declined because of scheduling conflicts.|$|E

500|$|... "It adapts {{with the}} show, I {{think in the}} context of a live show it's {{important}} to have something that lives and breathes with the show. One of the challenges that I posed to the production team was ... if we decided to play something different, if we decided to extend a part, whatever we decide to <b>do,</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> the artwork to change with the performance. So it needs to be malleable ... It's as much a piece of art as the music is, so we want it to be compelling and fit with the overall kind of aesthetic of what the band is up to right at this moment." ...|$|E
500|$|His {{appointment}} {{to command the}} 6th Division meant that Mackay led its—and the Australian Army's—first battles of the war. Doubts about Mackay's ability soon disappeared with {{the commitment of the}} division to Operation Compass. During the Battle of Bardia, in Libya in January 1941, the 6th Division captured the fortified town along with 36,000 Italian prisoners. For this success, Mackay was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE). In a war of rapid movement over long distances, Mackay demonstrated careful planning and recognised the need to reinforce success. He also impressed others with the way he cared for soldiers' lives. [...] "Not only <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> Tobruk quickly", he told his brigadiers before the battle, [...] "but I also want it cheaply". The victory at Bardia was followed by successes at Tobruk, Derna and Benghazi.|$|E
500|$|Timberlake {{described}} [...] "SexyBack" [...] as [...] "an experiment gone {{right from}} the sort of synthesizer influence to the distorted vocals", adding that it was [...] "one of the songs that the more you listen to it its just hook after hook after hook. Its {{just one of those}} 'flow off the top of your head' tracks, in terms of melody. We wanted to keep it loose and not too rehearsed, it's one of those very experimental records though." [...] Timberlake revealed that he went [...] "left", regarding going more rock, not in how he developed the song, but in the way he sang the song. [...] "I wanted to sing the song like a rock and roll singer, not an R singer. That's the approach." [...] The day before recording, Timberlake and Timbaland had listened to David Bowie's [...] "Rebel Rebel" [...] and the Rapture's [...] "House of Jealous Lovers". Timberlake wanted to achieve the songs' [...] "raw energy". Timberlake said that he modeled himself on Bowie and Prince, and described the song as Bowie and David Byrne [...] "covering" [...] James Brown's 1970 song [...] "Sex Machine". Timberlake said that the song [...] "doesn't qualify as rock or straight funk" [...] and that he was happy with the description [...] "club funk". He was [...] "keen for a new musical direction" [...] following the release of his first album, Justified. [...] "I listened to the radio for a few months and thought, 'All this sounds like shit, what <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to hear?'. That's really all I did. Everything's [...] got so repetitive, everything sounds the same. I had to create something unique otherwise there's no point putting it out." ...|$|E

500|$|In June 2002, {{cast members}} from Holby City and Casualty competed against the EastEnders cast {{for the first}} Sport Relief fundraiser, in a segment dubbed [...] "Sport in the Square". The teams competed in events such as taxi pulling, melon tossing and a beer keg relay. The {{competition}} was televised on BBC One, and the event as a whole raised £10million. In October 2003, BBC One aired a [...] "Kenyon Confronts" [...] documentary by Panorama reporter Paul Kenyon, investigating hospitals run by the Private Finance Initiative. He discovered many problems within the hospitals, which were dramatised by the Holby City cast in specially commissioned scenes. March 2004 saw the station air the documentary [...] "Making It at Holby", {{as part of a}} BBC initiative to develop new acting talent. The documentary followed the casting process of Holby City and Casualty, from the audition stages to the filming of the selected actors' first scenes. Young explained his casting criteria, revealing: [...] "I try to put my head into the head of a viewer and ask: <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to spend three years in the life of this person?" [...] 17 November 2006 Children in Need charity telethon included a segment featuring the Holby City cast performing a comical version of [...] "Hung Up" [...] by Madonna. 16 November 2007 Children in Need appeal again contained a musical performance from Holby City cast members. Sharon D Clarke, backed by Nadine Lewington, Rakie Ayola and Phoebe Thomas performed a soul version of Aretha Franklin's signature song, [...] "Respect". On 28 June 2008, Holby City stars competed against their Casualty counterparts in a special charity edition of BBC Two game-show The Weakest Link. Holby City and Casualty cast members united on 20 February 2010, performing a dance rendition of [...] "Jai Ho" [...] for Let's Dance for Sport Relief.|$|E

Shortly thereafter, Ortiz began boxing at the insistence of his father, an alcoholic who often beat his children following his wife's departure. In an interview, Victor said, [...] "I hated that lady. I drew her a card once with a little rose on it and I gave it to her. She just threw it down and said 'What <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> that shit for?' That's when I picked up boxing. Then my Dad started screwing up, drinking." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Lisa-Joy Zgorski of the National Science Foundation, Steven Vogt was asked {{what he thought about}} the chances of life existing on Gliese 581g.

Personally, given the ubiquity and propensity of life to flourish wherever it can, I would say that... the chances of life on this planet are 100%. I have almost no doubt about it."

2500|$|Around this time, Bankhead {{began to}} attract a passionate and highly loyal {{following}} of gay men, some of whom she employed as help when her lifestyle began to take a toll on her, affectionately calling them her [...] "caddies". Though she had long struggled with addiction, her condition now worsened – she began taking dangerous cocktails of drugs to fall asleep, and her maid had to tape her arms down to prevent her from consuming pills during her periods of intermittent wakefulness. In her later years, Bankhead had serious accidents and several psychotic episodes from sleep deprivation and hypnotic drug abuse. Though she always hated being alone, her struggle with loneliness began to lapse into a depression. In 1956, playing the truth game with Tennessee Williams, she confessed, [...] "I’m fifty-four, and I wish always, always, for death. I’ve always wanted death.

2500|$|Ueda {{stated that}} the final game, as of June 2016, still {{represents}} the initial vision he had for The Last Guardian at its onset. The transition from the PlayStation 3 to 4 only improved how the game looked, but did not change how it played. Ueda stressed it was important during the extended development cycle to keep the question [...] "what kind of game <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to play?" [...] at the forefront, and {{to remember that the}} game needed to be targeted to players experiencing the title for the first time rather than developers that had played it through over and over. Digital Foundry, in comparing the game from its initial Target Render from 2008, the 2009 trailer, the 2015 trailer, and the final game, found very few changes in the game's structure and nature, while observing several improvements and changes made to the rendering systems.|$|E
2500|$|Joey Ramone stated [...] "I {{spent most}} of the early 70s {{listening}} to Slade Alive! thinking to myself, [...] "Wow – this is what I want to <b>do.</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to make that kind of intensity for myself. A couple of years later I was at CBGB's doing my best Noddy Holder." [...] Steve Jones of Sex Pistols stated [...] "Slade never compromised. We always had the feeling that they were on our side. I don't know but I think we were right." [...] NME commented on Slade's legacy in a review of a greatest hits album, [...] "They embodied the glorious absurdity of the greatest pop, in the sideburns, the mirrored top hat and Dave Hill's pudding bowl haircut. As such they were the simplest, most effective possible, riposte to prog rock's bloated pretensions and pseudo-intellect." [...] In 1981, Adam and the Ants' lead guitarist and co-songwriter Marco Pirroni stated that he was greatly influenced by the first gig he ever attended which was Slade at Wembley Pool in 1973.|$|E

2500|$|Elliott's BMX {{career was}} {{relatively}} short, lasting only six years. Elliott retired from twenty-inch BMX racing {{early in the}} 1986 season, right after the ABA Supernationals (which were held on January 26 and 27). Explaining the reason for her decision, Elliott said [...] "I <b>did</b> all <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to <b>do.</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to quit last year, but I thought about getting ABA No. 1 {{two years in a}} row.

2500|$|Of his {{direction}} of the film, Bakshi stated, [...] "My approach to animation as a director is live action. I don't approach it in the traditional animation ways. None of our characters get up and sing, because that's {{not the type of}} picture I'm trying to <b>do.</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> people to believe my characters are real, and it's hard to believe they're real if they start walking down the street singing." [...] Bakshi wanted the film to be the antithesis of any animated film produced by the Walt Disney Company. Accordingly, Fritz the Cat includes two satirical references to Disney. In one scene, silhouettes of Mickey Mouse, Daisy Duck, and Donald Duck are shown cheering on the United States Air Force as it drops napalm on a black neighborhood during a riot. Another scene features a reference to the [...] "Pink Elephants on Parade" [...] sequence from Dumbo. A sequence of the camera panning across a garbage heap in an abandoned lot in Harlem sets up a visual device which recurs in Hey Good Lookin'.|$|E
2500|$|On September 29, 2010, astronomers {{using the}} Keck Observatory {{proposed}} two additional planets, Gliese 581f and Gliese 581g, both in nearly circular orbits based on {{analysis of a}} combination of data sets from the HARPS and HIRES instruments. The proposed planet Gliese 581f was thought to be a 7 Earth-mass planet in a 433-day orbit and too cold to support liquid water. The candidate planet Gliese 581g attracted more attention: nicknamed Zarmina by one of its discoverers, the predicted mass of Gliese 581g was between 3 and 4 Earth-masses, with an orbital period of 37 days. The orbital distance was calculated to be well within the star's habitable zone, though the planet was expected to be tidally locked with one side of the planet always facing the star. In an interview with Lisa-Joy Zgorski of the National Science Foundation, Steven Vogt was asked what he thought about the chances of life existing on Gliese 581g. Vogt was optimistic: [...] "I'm not a biologist, nor <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to play one on TV.

[...] On March 2, 2009 Limbaugh said on his radio show that Steele is not fit to lead the Republican Party, asking of him [...] "Why do you claim to lead the Republican Party when you seem obsessed with seeing to it President Obama succeeds?" [...] After the show Steele called Limbaugh to apologize, saying [...] "I have {{enormous}} respect for Rush Limbaugh. I was {{maybe a little bit}} inarticulate. There was no attempt on my part to diminish his voice or his leadership. I went back at that tape and I realized words that I said weren't what I was thinking. It {{was one of those things}} where I thinking I was saying one thing, and it came out differently. What I was trying to say was a lot of people want to make Rush the scapegoat, the bogeyman, and he's not."
