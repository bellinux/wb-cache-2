50|$|The fate of Bennett's {{estate is}} uncertain, with two probate records issued. The first <b>granted</b> <b>probate</b> on 1 February 1898 to Henry Hewitt Bridgman with the estate valued at £463 19s. 6d. A second record of 1899 <b>grants</b> <b>probate</b> to Edward Jones Trustram, solicitor, the {{attorney}} of Aimée Guilbert, spinster. By this second probate, the estate had dwindled to just £88 9s. 6d. A {{notice in the}} London Gazette of 29 September 1899 asking all creditors of the estate to contact Trustram states that Aimée Guilbert was named executrix in the will.|$|R
50|$|In English law, a grant ad colligenda bona is {{sometimes}} applied for by parties {{interested in the}} administration of a deceased person's estate. The grant is useful where it has not been possible to <b>grant</b> <b>probate</b> in solemn form; for example, because there is a dispute over the validity of the will. Unlike an ordinary executor or administrator, someone with a grant ad colligenda cannot make any distribution of the estate's assets. His role is to protect the assets of the estate while the dispute surrounding the will is resolved.|$|E
50|$|The term also {{applied to}} one of the English provincial courts of Canterbury and York having {{jurisdiction}} over the estates of deceased persons. They had jurisdiction to <b>grant</b> <b>probate</b> or administration where the diocesan courts could not entertain the case owing to the deceased having died possessed of goods above a set value in each of two or more dioceses. The jurisdiction of the prerogative courts was transferred to the Court of Probate in 1857 by the Court of Probate Act 1857, and is now vested in the Family Division of the High Court of Justice by the Judicature Act.|$|E
40|$|The evidentiary {{threshold}} of proving a will {{is a necessary}} consequence of the place of wills as an exercise of testamentary freedom in the common law.

5000|$|Every {{year from}} 1858, volumes of short {{summaries}} of <b>grants</b> of <b>probate</b> and of {{letters of administration}} were created, in alphabetical order by surname. For each <b>grant</b> of <b>probate,</b> these include the name, address, and occupation (or other description) of the deceased, the place and date of the death, the date on which <b>probate</b> was <b>granted</b> {{and the value of}} the estate, and the names and addresses of any executors.|$|R
25|$|The <b>granting</b> of <b>probate</b> is {{the first}} step in the legal process of {{administering}} the estate of a deceased person, resolving all claims and distributing the deceased person's property under a will. A probate court decides the legal validity of a testator's (deceased person's) will and grants its approval, also known as <b>granting</b> <b>probate,</b> to the executor. The probated will then becomes a legal instrument that may be enforced by the executor in the law courts if necessary. A probate also officially appoints the executor (or personal representative), generally named in the will, as having legal power to dispose of the testator's assets in the manner specified in the testator's will. However, through the probate process, a will may be contested.|$|R

Her obituary in the Zoophilist declared that 'as {{a woman of the}} people, she exercised a great influence over the working classes... We shall miss her courageous and outspoken advocacy… her racy and eloquent speeches'. Her belongings were left to Rosetta Blanche Vincent, spinster, of Church House, Uckfield, Sussex, who was <b>granted</b> <b>probate</b> on the will as sole executrix.|$|R

50|$|In August 1467 Paston and Fastolf's former chaplain, Thomas Howes, were <b>granted</b> <b>probate</b> of Fastolf's will. Howes then {{defected}} to the trustees {{who had been}} appointed under Fastolf's written will, and who were continuing to oppose the Paston family's claims. In October 1468 several of these trustees, including Howes and William Yelverton, sold Caister to John Mowbray, 4th Duke of Norfolk, whose father, John Mowbray, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, had attempted to seize it in 1461. In August 1469 Norfolk laid siege to Caister Castle, and after five weeks Paston's younger brother, John, was forced to surrender it.|$|R
50|$|Otherwise, courts may grant {{leave to}} {{applicants}} to swear {{that a person}} is dead (within or after the seven-year period). For example, an executor may make such an application so they can be <b>granted</b> <b>probate</b> for the will. This kind of application would only be made sooner than seven years where death is probable, but not definitive (such as an unrecovered plane crash at sea), following an inquest (see below). Such an application is specific to the court where it is made—thus separate applications must be made at a coroner's inquest, for proceedings under the Matrimonial Causes and Civil Partnership Acts (for remarriage), for probate, and under the Social Security Act.|$|R

25|$|Only the executor(s) of a Will {{can apply}} for a <b>Grant</b> of <b>Probate.</b> It {{is the duty of}} the executor(s) of the will to obtain probate in a timely manner.

25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} types of grants of representation, each one designed to cover a particular circumstance. The most common cover the two most common situations—either the deceased died leaving a valid will or they did not. If someone left a valid will, it is more than likely that the grant is a <b>grant</b> of <b>probate.</b> If there was no will, the grant required {{is likely to be a}} grant of administration. There are many other grants that can be required in certain circumstances, and many have technical Latin names, but the general public is most likely to encounter <b>grants</b> of <b>probate</b> or administration. If an estate has a value of less than £5,000.00 or if all assets are held jointly and therefore pass by survivorship, for example to a surviving spouse, a grant is not usually required.|$|R
50|$|The Court of Probate Act 1857 {{transferred}} {{responsibility for}} the <b>granting</b> of <b>probate,</b> and letters of administration, from the ecclesiastical courts of England and Wales to a new civil Court of Probate.

5|$|As Lucan's {{bankruptcy}} proceeded, in August 1975 his creditors {{were informed}} that the missing earl had unsecured debts of £45,000 and preferential liabilities for £1,326. His assets were estimated at £22,632. The family silver was sold in March 1976 for around £30,000. His remaining debts were repaid by the Lucan family trust {{in the years immediately}} following his disappearance. His family was <b>granted</b> <b>probate</b> over his estate in 1999, but no death certificate was issued, and his heir, George Bingham, Lord Bingham, was refused permission to take his father's title and seat in the House of Lords. Following the passage of the Presumption of Death Act 2013, Bingham began a new attempt to have his father declared dead, which proved successful in a High Court hearing at the Rolls Building on 3 February 2016. He therefore inherited his father's title, becoming the 8th Earl of Lucan.|$|R
50|$|Malory died on 14 March 1471 and {{was buried}} in Christ Church Greyfriars, near Newgate Prison. His interment there {{suggests}} that his misdeeds (whatever they really amounted to) had been forgiven and that he possessed some wealth. However, it was certified at the <b>granting</b> of <b>probate</b> that he owned little wealth of his own, having settled his estate on his son in 1462.|$|R
50|$|After {{his death}} his will was missing but his daughter, Charlotte Sugden, {{was able to}} {{recollect}} {{the contents of a}} most intricate document, and in the action of Sugden v. Lord Saint Leonards (L.R. 1 P.D. 154) the Court of Chancery accepted her evidence and <b>granted</b> <b>probate,</b> admitting into the probate a paper propounded as containing the provisions of the lost will. This decision established the proposition that the contents of a lost will, that can be proven to have existed, may be proved by secondary evidence, even of a single witness. Charlotte Sugden submitted sworn testimony that Lord Saint Leonards was in the habit of reading his will every night, such that his daughter had to listen to it and over some years memorised it. This decision became a well known fact and narrow precedent in legal circles, departing from provisions of the Wills Act 1837 which remained the principal legislation governing an area shaped by equity (law) and later by common law.|$|R
