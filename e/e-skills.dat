40|$|Magister Commercii (Information Management) - MCom(IM) The {{development}} of the Internet and other {{information and communication technologies}} (ICT) in recent decades represents a material foundation for a networked society and the emergence of new economies (Knowledge Society) and is now directly affecting individuals and whole societies. ICT is now an indisputable component of addressing the major issues of equity, sustainability and global competitiveness. Being still in its early developmental phase in many developing countries (such as South Africa), Knowledge Society requires profoundly new ways of thinking, working and living, which includes building of new capacities for the entire nation. These capacities are inter alia inevitably {{associated with the use of}} ICT and are often referred to as <b>e-skills.</b> These skills broadly described as the ability to develop and use ICT to adequately participate in an environment increasingly dominated by access to electronically enabled information and a well-developed ability to synthesise this into effective and relevant knowledge. In order to address a considerable deficiency in <b>e-skills</b> (estimated shortage of 70000 e-skilled people), the South African government through the Department of Communication has established the <b>e-Skills</b> Institute (e-SI) with the mandate to concentrate on the {{development of}} adequate skills to allow its citizens to improve their capacities to use all forms of ICT at work, in their education, in their personal lives and in their governance. In this regard, the e-SI is also responsible for creating appropriate policies which should be linked to other relevant national (e. g. Medium Term Strategic Framework (MTSF), 2009 – 2014) and international (e. g. UN Millennium Development Goals - MDGs) developmental strategies. However, while participating in the {{development of the}} current national <b>e-skills</b> policy (the National <b>e-Skills</b> Plan of Action – NeSPA 1), the author realised that there were not readily available guidelines or frameworks that could advise policy development in this area. It seems that much space in the policy development is left to the policy-makers own values, experience, expertise, judgement, the influence of lobbyists and pressure groups, pragmatism, or based on the resources available, than on evidence. Thus, this study set the following objectives:  To understand the theoretical and contextual background of policy-making;  To explore existing policy-making frameworks that might be relevant to <b>e-skills</b> policy-making;  To identify and classify <b>e-skills</b> related elements obtained from pertinent literature;  To verify these policy-making elements by interviewing experienced policy-makers in the fields of ICT and e-skills;  To suggest a framework for <b>e-skills</b> policy-making in the South African developmental context; and  To explain the use of the elements within the proposed <b>e-skills</b> policy-making framework. These objectives were achieved by reviewing the pertinent literature, which led to the construction of the conceptual model for <b>e-skills</b> policy-making in South Africa. This model consists of eight elements: (i) Context-related awareness, (ii) Collaborative <b>e-skills</b> ecology, (iii) Excellence education for all, (iv) Futures of ICT capabilities and knowledge infrastructure, (v) Research and development, (vi) Cost and affordability, (vii) E-inclusion and (viii) Monitoring and evaluation. This model was subsequently empirically tested using the Interpretive hermeneutic research approach by interviewing a number of policy-makers in the fields of <b>e-skills</b> or broader field of ICT policy-making. The empirical findings confirmed validity of the above <b>e-skills</b> policy-making elements but also elicited two new elements: (ix) Integration and systemic approach and (x) Aggregation. Consequently, these elements were assembled together into a framework for <b>e-skills</b> policy-making in South Africa. In order to make the proposed <b>e-skills</b> policy-making framework operational, the next step of this study was to relate this framework to the policy-making processes. This was done by positioning elements of <b>e-skills</b> policy-making framework within the EU "Policy making 3. 0 " process model. The main contribution of this study is seen in the fact that it brings a novel <b>e-skills</b> policy-making framework particularly design for the South African context but keeping in mind that it can possibly be used in other similar developing countries. Theoretically, this study has added to the academic understanding of significance of certain concepts for <b>e-skills</b> policy-making derived from the pertinent literature but also those identified empirically by this research. Now this study can be used for a practical implementation and also as a base for further academic research. This study also has some limitations mainly seen through a fairly small research sample caused by absence or unavailability of experienced policy-makers. However, it is believed that this limitation did not limit validity of results and the practical and academic contribution of this study...|$|E

40|$|M. Tech. Business Information SystemsInformation and {{communications}} technology (ICT) {{has proved to}} be a significant tool for both private and public sectors in the enhancement of service delivery. Organisations need to identify the socio-economic, political and technological needs that would help them to strengthen their business positions in order to remain competitive in the globalised economy. To achieve this goal, organisations need to accelerate the ICT skills (<b>e-skills)</b> development within their settings. However, there is a general lack of <b>e-skills</b> within South Africa. Further still, there is also lack of standards that could be followed in the development of these skills. This calls for a contextualised framework to guide <b>e-skills</b> development within the South African private and public sectors.

40|$|There is {{widespread}} {{agreement of the}} importance of information and communication technolo-gies (ICT) in building equitable prosperity and globally competitive economies. Effective use of these technologies, however, requires building new capacities and skills, here referred to as <b>e-skills,</b> not only in the working force but the entire population. These skills are in very short sup-ply all over the developing world, and are of particular concern in South Africa. In order to ap-propriately address this issue, South African government has taken a systematic and systemic ap-proach, to address the matter and has developed an approach involving a number of stakeholders from all spheres of government, business, education, civil society and organized labor. That effort led to the <b>e-Skills</b> Summit (2010), which provided the guidelines for the creation of the national <b>e-skills</b> policy named the National <b>e-Skills</b> Plan of Action (NeSPA).

40|$|The {{intersection}} {{of business and}} IT in an organisation requires people with diverse business- and technology-related competences and skills, {{commonly referred to as}} ‘e-competences’ and ‘e-skills’. The positioning of these competences within an IT function in an organisation is (arguably) well defined, but their place in other areas of business managerial concern in an organisation, such as business processes or organisational strategy, is still not sufficiently clear. As <b>e-skills</b> and e-competences are inevitably {{associated with the use of}} organisational information systems (IS), this paper reports an initial study aimed at positioning these competences and skills within an organisation from an IS perspective. The positioning was done by examining models of IS, e-competences and <b>e-skills</b> and identifying their possible areas of intersection, which resulted in mapping these competences and skills to the areas of managerial concern in an organisation – as seen from an IS perspective. This mapping has revealed an initial understanding of how business value, here seen as business benefits, is created by using the <b>e-skills</b> and e-competences (supposedly) possessed by employees throughout an organisation.

40|$|Magister Commercii (Information Management) - MCom(IM) The {{high rate}} of youth {{unemployment}} is a global phenomenon and a worrying factor. This contradicted the opportunity presented by the ICT sector, which requires <b>e-skills,</b> particularly e-literacy/or digital literacy skills in the entire sectors of the economy, not only ICT. Ala-Mutka (2011) defines e-literacy skills as the "basic technical use of computers and the internet". ICT skills are viewed as essential in the modern day world {{in order to improve}} individual’s chances of securing and keeping employment. Various initiatives to improve youth employability in South Africa, particularly those that are studying TVET colleges or those have already graduated. Various approaches have been adopted such envisaged by the White Paper for Post-School Education and Training of 2013 i. e. preparation for workplace, self-employment through close cooperation of TVET colleges and industry (DHET, 2013). Employers assume that graduates are familiar with computer and Internet usage. Thus, the study set the following objectives: • To understand the theoretical and contextual background of promoting employability; • To explore existing employability frameworks that might be relevant for promoting employability; • To identify and categorize the factors that are relevant for promoting employability obtained from pertinent literature; • To validate these factors by interviewing key TVET stakeholders and ICT experts; • To propose an employability framework customized for the South African context; and • To explain the use of these factors within the proposed employability framework. The objectives were realised by reviewing pertinent literature, which {{led to the development of}} an employability conceptual research framework for South Africa. A conceptual research framework that consists of five factors from the <b>e-skills</b> national curriculum competency framework: (i) <b>e-skills</b> for service delivery; (ii) <b>e-skills</b> for new jobs; (iii) <b>e-skills</b> for existing jobs; (iv) self-employment; and (v) ICT practitioner skills. In-terms of <b>e-skills</b> levels i. e. ICT user skills, e-business skills and ICT practitioner skills. The first three sets of <b>e-skills</b> are associated with ICT user skill, <b>e-skills</b> for self-employment are associated with e-business skills and then ICT practitioner skills. This conceptual research framework was subsequently empirically verified using an interpretive approach by interviewing key TVET stakeholders and an ICT expert. The empirical findings affirmed the validity of the above-mentioned employability factors but also uncovered two additional factors: (iv) practical experience and infrastructure. These factors were subsequently incorporated into the final employability framework for South Africa. The main contribution of this study is the fact that it brings a new employability framework for TVET colleges for the South African context, with the hope that it can be applicable in similar environments in the developing context. There are some limitations in the present study due to a small research sample that was caused by the unavailability of employed graduates. However, it is believed that this limitation did not deem the results and the academic and practical contribution of the study invalid...|$|E
