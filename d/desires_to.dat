While being driven home by Erik, Brendon asks Erik to fight McGuirk as revenge, but Erik denies his request and suggests he take his mind off the topic by playing a car game. Eventually, Brendon decides to apologize to McGuirk for his behavior, and the two reconcile.

40|$|Studies {{indicate}} that while suppressing smoking thoughts increases subsequent smoking, {{it may have}} no impact on <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> smoke. However, previous research has examined suppression of general smoking thoughts rather than thoughts specifically related <b>to</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> smoke. The present study investigated whether suppression of thoughts of <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> smoke results in subsequently elevated ratings of <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> smoke. An experimental study {{examined the effects of}} suppressing thoughts of <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> smoke, versus expressing thoughts of <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> smoke, versus a control group thinking about anything, on ratings of <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> smoke and tobacco withdrawal symptoms at four time points (before manipulations, just after manipulations, 5 min after, 10 min after). In addition, effects of suppressing thoughts of <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> smoke on subsequent reports of thoughts of <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> smoke were examined. Suppressing the thoughts of <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> smoke caused thought rebound (i. e., greater subsequent reports of thoughts of <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> smoke). However, compared with control groups, this suppression did not elevate subsequent ratings of <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> smoke. Suppressing the thoughts of <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> smoke does not elevate subsequent ratings of this desire. Increased cigarette consumption following suppression of smoking thoughts may be mediated by mechanisms other than increased <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> smoke...|$|R

The sage feels insulted seeing the taboo offering, and curses the king to be a rakshasa.|$|E
5|$|The poem is {{critical}} of the corruption Coleridge sees within his own government, but it still displays his loyalty and devotion to England. The poem operates in a circular pattern with its beginning and ending at the Stowey dell. By introducing the historically real possibility of an invasion of England, the narrator announces his determination to protect his family and the dell, along with his fellow Britons. Throughout the poem, {{there is also an}} emphasis on the simple life and the narrator <b>desires</b> <b>to</b> return to his previous idyllic lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|When Macbeth {{returns to}} the witches later in the play, they show him an {{apparition}} of the murdered Banquo, along with eight kings of his family, descending through Fleance. King James, on the throne when Macbeth was written, was the ninth Stuart king. This scene thus suggests strong support for James' right to the throne by lineage, and for audiences of Shakespeare's day, was a tangible fulfilment of the witches' prophecy. The apparition is also deeply unsettling to Macbeth, who not only wants the throne for himself, but also <b>desires</b> <b>to</b> father a line of kings.|$|E

5|$|As with A Wizard of Earthsea, The Tombs of Atuan is a bildungsroman or coming-of-age story, {{this time}} from the {{perspective}} of a female character, Tenar. Though she nominally has a position of high authority, Tenar feels trapped by her duties as priestess, and <b>desires</b> <b>to</b> escape to a place where she can make her own choices. In contrast to Ged, whose journey was chiefly a private quest, Tenar's choices have direct social consequences. While Ged's growth is traced through the various adventures he experiences in the first volume of the series, Tenar's development is shown through her exploration of her own domain. The labyrinth, in particular, with its twists and turns, is a metaphor for Tenar's exploration of her own thoughts. In this reading of the novel, the labyrinth symbolizes the imprisonment of the women, and the darkness and unacknowledged thoughts within Tenar, which she begins to struggle through after feeling guilt over killing the prisoners sent to her.|$|E

It soon became the one absorbing object of Henry's <b>desires</b> <b>to</b> annul his marriage to Queen Catherine so he {{would be free to}} marry Anne. When it became clear that Pope Clement VII would not annul the marriage, the breaking of the Catholic Church's power in England began. In 1532, Henry granted Anne the Marquessate of Pembroke.|$|E

She meets a homeless man, who closely resembles Jack, {{who is about to}} commit a crime by smashing a window. The man <b>desires</b> <b>to</b> go to prison, believing it to be the only way that he will have food and shelter. The girl recognizes the opportunity and plans to pay him for taking the place of her fiancée in prison. The man consents and the heiress concocts a clever substitution that proves successful via change of clothes. Jack, now free, confronts the aunt—who believes that his reappearance is a ghostly one. The aunt confesses that the baron's wounds were self-inflicted and the circumstantial evidence that the servant and policeman had seen was an erroneous. The substitute convict is pardoned and released from prison without the swap ever being known. For his plot, the French baron is convicted for perjury and sent to the state prison.|$|E

5|$|Life {{expectancy}} in HD {{is generally}} around 20years following {{the onset of}} visible symptoms. Most life-threatening complications result from muscle coordination and, to a lesser extent, behavioral changes induced by declining cognitive function. The largest risk is pneumonia, which causes death in one third of those with HD. As the ability to synchronize movements deteriorates, difficulty clearing the lungs and {{an increased risk of}} aspirating food or drink both increase the risk of contracting pneumonia. The second greatest risk is heart disease, which causes almost a quarter of fatalities of those with HD. Suicide is the third greatest cause of fatalities, with 7.3% of those with HD taking their own lives and up to 27% attempting to do so. It is unclear to what extent suicidal thoughts are influenced by behavioral symptoms, as they signify sufferers' <b>desires</b> <b>to</b> avoid the later stages of the disease. Other associated risks include choking, physical injury from falls, and malnutrition.|$|E

40|$|Is <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> eat in {{response}} to positive emotions an 'obese' eating style: a style more prevalent in people with obesity? In other words: Is Kummerspeck (German: sorrow-fat) for some people a misnomer? This question was addressed in three studies on women. Study 1 (n = 188) tested the moderator effect of subjective well-being on the association of BMI with the scale on <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> eat {{in response}} to negative emotions (DEBQ-E). Study 2 tested in women (n = 832) whether items on <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> eat {{in response to}} positive emotions loaded on the same factor as those in response to negative emotions and body mass. Study 3 assessed in the total sample (n = 203) and an overweight subsample (n = 40) a) whether self-reported <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> eat in response to positive emotions predicted actual food intake and b) whether this also held true over and above self-reported <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> eat in response to negative emotions. Study 1 showed only for women with low positive affect a significant positive association of BMI with DEBQ-E. In Study 2, only items on <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> eat in response to negative emotions loaded on the same factor as BMI. Study 3 : In the total sample, the significant effect on food intake of the scale on <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> eat in response to positive emotions disappeared when a scale on <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> eat in response to negative emotions {{was added to the}} model. In the overweight-subsample there was only an effect on food intake for <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> eat in response to negative emotions. It is concluded that only <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> eat in response to negative emotions is an 'obese' eating style, suggesting that Kummerspeck is not a misnomer...|$|R
