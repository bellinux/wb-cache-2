5|$|In 1678 a local innkeeper, John Barnes was hanged {{after being}} {{found guilty of}} <b>highway</b> <b>robbery.</b> He had waylaid, {{with the help of}} accomplices, a coach {{travelling}} from Exeter to London and made off with about £600 but he was recognised by the guards from Exeter, where he had been a taverner.|$|E
5|$|Offenses where impalement was {{occasionally}} employed include: {{contempt for}} the state's responsibility for safe roads and trade routes by committing <b>highway</b> <b>robbery</b> or grave robbery, violating state policies or monopolies, or subverting standards for trade. Offenders have also been impaled {{for a variety of}} cultural, sexual and religious reasons.|$|E

5000|$|Plunkett and Maclaine were {{responsible}} for around 20 <b>highway</b> <b>robberies</b> in six months, often in the then-relatively untamed Hyde Park. Amongst their victims were Horace Walpole and Lord Elgington. The thieves were always restrained and courteous, earning Maclaine the sobriquet [...] "gentleman highwayman". The proceeds enabled him to live the high life.|$|R

5|$|The 1773 {{papers of}} George III contain details of Pitfour {{accompanying}} Lord Justice Clerk Thomas Miller on the Northern Circuit {{from the end}} of April until 20 May. Among the cases heard were the trial of a servant accused of murdering another servant on Skye, and the case of Edward Shaw McIntosh, a Borlum gentleman of rank who together with his brother and some of their servants was accused of several instances of housebreaking which had escalated to murder and <b>highway</b> <b>robbery.</b> Some of the gang was caught, but McIntosh remained an outlaw.|$|E
5|$|Another local {{man called}} Tom Austin was hanged in August 1694. He {{inherited}} a farm {{with an annual}} income of £80 and then married {{the daughter of a}} neighbouring farmer with a dowry of £800. He lived an extravagant lifestyle and spent all of his money. His farm, having been neglected could not provide sufficient income for him and he borrowed a lot of money from neighbours and friends. He then turned to <b>highway</b> <b>robbery</b> and was moderately successful for a time. He shot Sir Zachary Wilmott during a robbery on the road between Wellington and Taunton. The proceeds from his crimes supported him for a time but in the long term he was unable to clear his debts. In 1694, following a row with his wife, he went to visit his uncle. His uncle was not at home and he killed his aunt and her five children and took around £60 from the house. On returning home he was asked about the bloodstains on his clothes by his wife. He then killed her and his two children. His uncle who dropped in to visit him on his way home knocked Tom Austin unconscious and he was arrested and later hung at Exeter Jail.|$|E
5|$|During {{his early}} years as a practising barrister, Garrow was {{particularly}} noted for his aggressive and confrontational style of cross-examination. When James Wingrove was charged with theft and violence {{in the course of}} a <b>highway</b> <b>robbery</b> in 1784, Garrow's cross-examination of William Grove (who acted as a witness and the person charging Wingrove) got him to admit that he was perjuring himself in an attempt to get a reward, and that Wingrove had not robbed the two injured parties. Garrow showed a dislike of most thief-takers, of which Grove was one, although he did not treat the Bow Street Runners and other professionals with contempt. His dislike of such men was highlighted in his defence of three men in 1788 for theft; they were charged with assaulting John Troughton, putting him in fear of his life, and stealing his hat. The issue was whether the assault put him in fear of his life, or whether he was exaggerating to claim a reward, which could not be claimed for simple theft. Garrow established that Troughton was uncertain about how he lost his hat, despite his attempts to claim that the defendants knocked it off him, and after four witnesses gave character evidence the defendants were found not guilty.|$|E

50|$|By {{this time}} James Snook {{was already a}} wanted man, in {{connection}} with several <b>highway</b> <b>robberies</b> between Bath and Salisbury. He had also indicted for horse-stealing at the Old Bailey in 1799, under, what is assumed to be, his full name of James Blackman Snooks. For this charge he was acquitted, {{due to lack of}} firm evidence.|$|R
25|$|Thomas Bell, {{brother of}} John, also played for Dartford and All-England. In 1762, Thomas Bell was {{condemned}} to death at Maidstone Assizes for <b>highway</b> <b>robbery,</b> but was later reprieved. Nothing more {{is known of}} him.|$|E
25|$|In 1929, Floyd {{was wanted}} in {{numerous}} cases. On March 9, {{he was arrested}} in Kansas City on investigation, and again on May 6 for vagrancy and suspicion of <b>highway</b> <b>robbery,</b> but he was released the next day. Two days later, {{he was arrested in}} Pueblo, Colorado, and charged with vagrancy. He was fined $50.00 and sentenced to 60 days in jail.|$|E
25|$|In 1774, when Squire fled a ransacked house, he ran {{straight}} into {{several members of}} the local constabulary and was arrested for <b>highway</b> <b>robbery.</b> This was actually a lucky break. By escaping through the front door, which opened onto the highway, he avoided a more serious charge of stealing. Although Squire was sentenced to be transported to America for 7 years, he elected to serve in the army and returned to Kingston as a free man within 4 years.|$|E

50|$|Upon Otto's {{death at}} the nearby Harzburg in 1218, Harly Castle passed to his Welf heirs. At the 1290 Imperial diet in Erfurt, the Hildesheim prince-bishop Siegfried II of Querfurt accused Duke Henry I of Brunswick of using its {{favourable}} location for ambushes and <b>highway</b> <b>robberies</b> of bypassing merchants. He had the castle besieged for several months and eventually completely slighted.|$|R
25|$|Kelly {{was arrested}} the {{following}} day for <b>highway</b> <b>robbery</b> and locked up overnight in Benalla. He appeared in court the following morning, but Sergeant Whelan, despite using an interpreter to translate Fook's account, requested a remand to allow time to find another interpreter. Kelly was held for four days and appearing in court on 20 October, was again remanded after the police failed to produce an interpreter. The charge was dismissed on 26 October and he was released.|$|E
25|$|A siege {{was only}} worth {{undertaking}} if the attacker had previously ensured he had legal authority and {{had asked the}} state sovereign or even the emperor for permission. This was only possible where there had been actual or fabricated violations of the law, such as <b>highway</b> <b>robbery,</b> forgery or murder. The hands {{of those who had}} sworn allegiance to the sovereign were then tied; for legal reasons they could not {{come to the aid of}} the attacked lord. In such cases, taking final refuge in the main tower was almost pointless.|$|E
25|$|Adam {{was rewarded}} {{for his part}} in Richard II's surrender, {{imprisonment}} and fall by being granted the living of Kemsing and Seal, and later made a prebend in the church of Bangor. These nicely supplemented his professional legal income and status. However one living, his title to the prebend of Llandygwydd in Cardiganshire given under the college of Abergwili, was contested by one Walter Jakes, alias Ampney, who had obtained it by exchange in 1399. The two were in an affray, in Westminster, in November 1400, which resulted in charges being brought against Adam and his company for <b>highway</b> <b>robbery.</b> The outcome is unknown, however it did not immediately limit his legal activities, as he continued as a lawyer.|$|E
5000|$|From Megiddo {{he moved}} to the command of Acre Prison. In 1931 Duff became {{commander}} of Tulkarm district which was rife with feuds, <b>highway</b> <b>robberies</b> and attacks on Jewish colonies. According to his account he retired the following year due to severe recurrences of malaria. Other sources say he was dismissed for the ill treatment of prisoners and that his name was the source of the slang expression [...] "to duff up" [...] someone.|$|R

50|$|Plunketts Creek in Lycoming County {{bears the}} name of Col. William Plunkett. He reputedly died aged around 100 at Sunbury (Pennsylvania), quite blind, and was buried there in 1791. But if this is true, and {{if he were the}} same man, he must already have been 60 {{at the time of the}} <b>highway</b> <b>robberies</b> on Hounslow Heath, and almost 85 when {{commanding}} the Northumberland Militia. The facts can be reconciled if the estimate of his age at death is exaggerated.|$|R
25|$|Average living {{conditions}} in the increasingly impoverished rural villages were very bad and the exploited peasants resorted to various forms of resistance, most often running away from particularly abusive landlords. Some villages or areas engaged in collectively refusing to perform the prescribed duties, or, rarely in ethnically Polish lands, armed rebellions. The Kostka-Napierski Uprising took place in 1651, there were rebellions in the Podhale region in 1670 and in other regions in 1735–38. In Silesia the ethnically Polish peasantry rebelled during 1722–29 and in 1750 around Pszczyna, when the Prussian army was brought to bear. <b>Highway</b> <b>robbery</b> band activity was another form of peasant resistance; some of its leaders, especially from mountainous regions, have become immortalized in folk tales.|$|E
25|$|Hudud is an Islamic concept: punishments which under Islamic law (Shariah) are {{mandated}} {{and fixed}} by God. The Shariah divided offenses into those against God and those against man. Crimes against God violated His Hudud, or 'boundaries'. These punishments were {{specified by the}} Quran, {{and in some instances}} by the Sunnah. They are namely for adultery, fornication, homosexuality, illegal sex by a slave girl, accusing someone of illicit sex but failing to present four male Muslim eyewitnesses, apostasy, consuming intoxicants, outrage (e.g. rebellion against the lawful Caliph, other forms of mischief against the Muslim state, or <b>highway</b> <b>robbery),</b> robbery and theft. The crimes against hudud cannot be pardoned by the victim or by the state, and the punishments must be carried out in public.|$|E
25|$|Historian Waddy W. Moore uses {{court records}} {{to show that}} on the sparsely settled Arkansas {{frontier}} lawlessness was common. He distinguished two types of crimes: unprofessional (dueling, crimes of drunkenness, selling whiskey to the Indians, cutting trees on federal land) and professional (rustling, <b>highway</b> <b>robbery,</b> counterfeiting). Criminals found many opportunities to rob pioneer families of their possessions, while the few underfunded lawmen had great difficulty detecting, arresting, holding, and convicting wrongdoers. Bandits, typically in groups of two or three, rarely attacked stagecoaches with a guard carrying a sawed-off, double-barreled shotgun; it proved less risky to rob teamsters, people on foot, and solitary horsemen, while bank robberies themselves were harder to pull off due {{to the security of}} the establishment. According also to historian Brian Robb, the earliest form of organized crime in America was born from the gangs of the Old West.|$|E
5000|$|Following the robbery, the {{government}} offered a £50 reward for the culprit's apprehension, and McPherson left Queensland for New South Wales, {{with the aim}} of joining up with a bushranging gang, that included Ben Hall, Frank Gardiner, John Gilbert and John Dunn. [...] McPherson is said to have committed <b>highway</b> <b>robberies</b> on his way to find the gang, and to have combined his father's given and mother's maiden name to create the alias John Bruce. Other aliases included Mar, Kerr, Scotia and Scotchie.|$|R
500|$|Several {{newspapers}} {{suggested that}} on 6and7May, he committed two <b>highway</b> <b>robberies</b> near Epping.

[...] The horses were suspected as belonging to [...] "highwaymen" [...] and King was arrested for questioning, but was later released without charge. [...] Morris's killing unleashed a flood of Turpin reports, and a reward of £200 was offered for his capture.|$|R

25|$|Meanwhile, Henry's son Hal is joking, drinking, and thieving with Falstaff and his associates. He likes Falstaff {{but makes}} no pretense at being like him. He enjoys {{insulting}} his dissolute friend and makes sport of him by joining in Poins’ plot to disguise themselves and rob and terrify Falstaff and three friends of loot they have stolen in a <b>highway</b> <b>robbery,</b> purely {{for the fun of}} watching Falstaff lie about it later, after which Hal returns the stolen money. Rather early in the play, in fact, Hal informs us that his riotous time will soon come to a close, and he will re-assume his rightful high place in affairs by showing himself worthy to his father and others through some (unspecified) noble exploits. Hal believes that this sudden change of manner will amount to a greater reward and acknowledgment of prince-ship, and in turn earn him respect from the members of the court.|$|E
500|$|Although {{limiting}} his own jurisdiction, in 1342 voivode Thomas Szécsényi {{recognized the}} right of Transylvanian noblemen to judge legal cases of peasants owning parcels in their estates, [...] "with the exception of three cases, such as robbery, <b>highway</b> <b>robbery,</b> and violent trespass". This concession was confirmed in 1365 by King Louis I of Hungary. Furthermore, the monarchs granted jus gladii (the right to the application of capital punishment) {{to more and more}} nobles {{in the course of the}} same century.|$|E
500|$|Vigilante {{justice in}} Helena {{followed}} a pattern {{similar to that}} of Alder Gulch. [...] Immediately after Keene's hanging, leading members of the Helena community established the Helena Committee of Safety, akin to the Vigilance Committee of Alder Gulch. [...] Although no records of the committee's membership or bylaws exist, Nathaniel Langford, who had been asked to lead the organization but declined (he did serve on its Executive Committee), reflected in his book Vigilante Days and Ways, that crimes of horse stealing, murder, and <b>highway</b> <b>robbery</b> would be punishable by death.|$|E
50|$|All {{manner of}} criminals stayed at Newgate. Some {{committed}} acts of petty crime and theft, {{breaking and entering}} homes or committing <b>highway</b> <b>robberies,</b> while others performed serious crimes such as rapes and murders. The number of prisoners in Newgate for specific types of crime often grew and fell, reflecting public anxieties of the time. For example, towards {{the tail end of}} Edward I's reign, there was a rise in street robberies. As such, the punishment for drawing out a dagger was 15 days in Newgate; injuring someone meant 40 days in the prison.|$|R
50|$|Phoolan {{learned how}} to use a rifle from Vikram, and participated in the gang's {{activities}} across Bundelkhand, which straddles the border between Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. These activities consisted of attacking and looting villages where upper-caste people lived, kidnapping relatively prosperous people for ransom, and committing occasional <b>highway</b> <b>robberies</b> which targeted flashy cars. Phoolan was the only woman member of that gang of dacoits. After every crime, she would visit a Durga temple and thank the Goddess for her protection. The gang's main hideouts were in the ravines of the Chambal River.|$|R

He was also involved in legal and illegal diamond buying in the diamond fields, horse theft and <b>highway</b> <b>robberies.</b> He was caught and sentenced several times for these crimes, but, always managed to escape somehow and claimed that no prison cell could hold him. It appears {{that a lot of}} these activities were on behalf of the British government and he was released without blowing his cover.|$|R
