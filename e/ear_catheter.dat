40|$|The {{efficacy}} of the urea dilution technique for estimating empty body composition of pigs weighing 50 kg was evaluated in experiment 1 (Exp. 1). Blood samples were collected via <b>ear</b> <b>catheter</b> before and at various times (3 to 90 minutes) after urea infusion for plasma urea analysis. Urea space was related (P 3 ̆c. 05) to chemically-determined total empty body components with few exceptions. Inclusion of additional independent variables with urea space improved the estimation of empty body components. Two experiments were conducted to investigate the interrelationships between amino acids and digestible energy (DE) in pigs weighing 20 to 50 kg. In Exp. 2, diets containing three lysine (Lys) levels that were either adjusted (1. 50, 2. 35 and 3. 20 g/Mcal DE) for five DE levels (3. 00 to 4. 00 Mcal/kg) or unadjusted (. 45,. 71 and. 96...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of the urea dilution technique in estimating the empty body composition of pigs weighing 50 kg was evaluated in three trials using 17 contemporary (Large White x Landrace x Hampshire x Duroc) and 8 Nebraska Gene Pool x contemporary pigs. Blood samples were collected via <b>ear</b> <b>catheter</b> before infusion (- 60, - 30 and 0 min) and at various times (3 to 90 min) after urea infusion (2. 16 mmol/kg live BW), and analyzed for plasma urea. Backfat thickness of live pigs from the contemporary line was measured ultrasonically. Pigs then were killed by euthanasic injection. and total bodies (with gastrointestinal contents removed) were analyzed for water, protein and fat. In Trials 1 and 2, there were linear relationships (P c. OOl) between chemically determined body water and fat and between body water and protein. Urea space was related (P c. OS) to empty body components with few exceptions, but regression coefficients for urea space in Trial 3 were {{different from those of}} Trials 1 and 2. Inclusion of additional independent variables with urea space improved estimation of empty body components. Although backfat alone did not estimate empty body components (except fat) as well as urea space alone, the addition of other common independent variables resulted in better estimates using backfat than urea space. The results of this experiment indicate that the urea dilution technique can be used to estimate the body composition of growing pigs. However, the accuracy obtained depended on the population of pigs being investigated and was no greater than the accuracy with appropriate equations based on backfat...|$|E

Into one ear vein, an average dose of 16  mCi of 99 mTc-anti-RAGE F(ab′) 2 was injected, and from the {{opposite}} ear vein, 1 -ml samples were withdrawn at 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300, and 360  min. From each tube, 50  μl was pipetted into pre-weighed tubes and counted in a gamma well counter. The counts vs. time were averaged for each time point and plotted. These pigs were also used for in vivo imaging and ex vivo well counting and histology.|$|R
30|$|To {{observe the}} in vivo MRI effect of lymph node, T 2 -weighted MRI was {{performed}} in normal healthy New Zealand White rabbits weighing 3.3 kg. The rabbits were anesthetized with an injection of pentobarbital (1 M). The PHEA-C 16 -iron oxide (0.45 mmol Fe, 25.13 mg Fe) was administered into a marginal vein of the rabbit's <b>ear</b> through the <b>catheter.</b> The T 2 -weighted MRI images were obtained before administration and 20 min after administration of the PHEA-C 16 -iron oxide nanoparticles. The T 2 -weighted MR imaging of the lymph node was performed with a turbo spin echo technique. The sequence parameters were 5, 383 ms of TR, 79.4 ms of TE, 1 -mm thickness, and 112 -mm FOV. The rabbit was sacrificed immediately after MR imaging test for the confirmation of PHEA-C 16 -iron oxide nanoparticles taken up by lymph node. The specimens was fixed in 10 % formalin for 24 h and embedded in paraffin. Prussian blue staining was performed on 5 -μm thick sections: the preparations were treated {{with a mixture of}} equal parts of 20 % hydrochloric acid and 10 % potassium ferrocyanide solution for 20 min and counterstained with nuclear fast red for 5 min. The principle of this method is that the ferric iron (Fe 3 +) in the tissue combines with the ferrocyanide and results in the formation of a bright blue pigment called Prussian blue.|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjective: Neutrophil transendothelial migration, a {{key feature}} of {{skeletal}} muscle ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury, is {{mediated by the}} platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule- 1 (PECAM- 1). Peroxynitrite anion, a toxic product of neutrophil superoxide anion and nitric oxide, contributes to oxidative skeletal muscle injury and can be quantified by measurement of protein tyrosine nitration after I/R. This study hypothesizes that administration of the PECAM- 1 /IgG antibody chimera will inhibit peroxynitrite-mediated injury after I/R. Methods: The study was composed of five groups: an I/R group (n = 4), a sham treatment group anesthetic control (n = 3), a treatment group receiving the PECAM- 1 /immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody chimera with I/R (n = 9), a treatment group receiving human IgG with I/R as an antibody control (n = 6), and a treatment group receiving normal saline solution with I/R as a vehicle control (n = 5). The right hind limb in male New Zealand white rabbits was rendered ischemic by occluding the iliac and femoral arteries for 3 hours, followed by 2 hours of reperfusion (I/R). Sham-treated rabbits underwent arterial dissection without arterial occlusion. PECAM- 1 /IgG–treated rabbits and IgG-treated rabbits received an infusion of 1 mg/kg in normal saline solution 20 mL via an <b>ear</b> vein <b>catheter</b> during the last 5 minutes of ischemia and the first 15 minutes of reperfusion. Saline solution–treated rabbits similarly received normal saline solution 20 mL. The anterior tibialis muscle was harvested after reperfusion. Immunohistochemical staining for nitrotyrosine was performed with monoclonal antinitrotyrosine antibodies and fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies. Computed morphometric study was performed to calculate relative fluorescence scores for each histologic section. Averaged fluorescence scores were analyzed by {{one-way analysis of variance}} with Bonferroni post hoc comparison. Results: The averaged fluorescence scores (mean ± SEM) for the sham-treated (2. 88 ± 0. 78) and PECAM- 1 /IgG–treated (6. 16 ± 0. 43) groups demonstrated a significant reduction in quantitative fluorescence compared with the IgG- (15. 17 ± 2. 01) and saline solution–treated (17. 46 ± 3. 71) control groups, and the I/R-treated (18. 52 ± 3. 00) group, (P <. 05). Conclusions: These results suggest that PECAM- 1 /IgG diminishes peroxynitrite-mediated oxidative skeletal muscle injury by inhibiting neutrophil transendothelial migration and may therefore prove a useful therapeutic agent in the treatment of reperfusion injury.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this clinical study was to establish {{for the first time}} a quantitative assessment of analgesia under practice common general anaesthesia of pigs induced by Ketamine-Azaperone using electromyography (EMG) to record the Nociceptive Flexor Reflex (NFR) but also using Elektroencephalography (EEG) to derive the Bispectral Index (BIS), both under surveillance of the previous traditional pain specific defense behaviour. In case of suitability the NFR should be applied also to test the Interdigital Claw Reflex (ZKR) which is in practice commonly used to assertain surgical tolerance before operations. Furthermore, the possibility to control the consciousness in pigs with aid of the BIS should be investigated for the first time, too. With the NFR and the blood levels of Ketamine, Norketamine and Azaperone it should be checked, if Cortisol can function as a reliable parameter for pain or stress during Ketamine-Azaperone-anaesthesia. Possible negative side effects of the anaesthesia on heart, cardiovascular system and respiration, particularly the risk of catalepsis by Ketamine should be controlled in addition. As a model for monitoring somatic and visceral analgesia the castration of 30 clinically healthy male pigs with a body weight between 42 and 60 kg was used. As somatic and visceral pain stimuli served the incision of the scrotal skin, of the tunica vaginalis and of the testis, the draw, the squeezing and the cutting off the spermatic cord with an emasculator, and finally the disinfection of the wound. The general anaesthesia was induced with an initial intramuscular dose of 20 mg/kg Ketamine (Ursotamine®) and 2 mg/kg Azaperone (Stresnil®). Right after laying down the NFR was recorded every minute using the EMG of the deltoid muscle. Additional records were taken exactly at the time of a certain manipulation or a specific pain stimulus. The stimulation of the NFR was performed by electric irritation of the ulnar nerve distal from the carpal joint. The irritation consisted of five terms of 0. 5 s distance, each, with five square impulses of 1 ms duration and a distance of 4 ms. The strength of irritation was limited to 45 mA. The threshold for nociception of 40 µV was determined from the arithmetic mean of the baseline-rushing (15 µV) plus it´s sixfold standard deviation. For control of consciousness and/or analgesia the BIS was evaluated from current EEG derivation of the frontal region. The serum concentrations of Cortisol, Ketamine and Azaperone were determined in 13 pigs with <b>ear</b> vein <b>catheters</b> before and during surgery, and up to four hours afterwards with the Liquid Chromatography coupled Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS). The pain-specific defense behaviour was evaluated using a standardized semi-quantitative scoring on the basis of defense-movements and vocalization. The lack of both is defined as surgical tolerance (Score 0). The ZKR was manually tested as common in practice. The vital parameters oxygen saturation, end-tidal carbon dioxide saturation, heart rate, mean arterial pressure and respiratory rate were currently recorded using the usual surveillance equipment in human anaesthesiology. To control catalepsis the EMG was also currently recorded from the deltoid muscle using another record channel. As an important result the NFR monitoring demonstrated that the initial dosage of Ketamine-Azaperone interrupts the conduction of pain signals to the effectors (muscles) following somatic as well as visceral pain stimuli. Related to surgical tolerance (Score 0) the test sensitivity and specifity of the NFR were 93 % and 98 %. Post operationem, up to two hours after inducing anaesthesia (maximum time of recording), a significant pain relief (74 µV) was also shown by NFR, corresponding with Score 1. The persistent high BIS values over time showed that this monitoring was not suited to estimate the state of analgesia and of consciousness in pigs. The vital parameters and Cortisol were also inappropiate indicators for analgesia. The test sensitivity and specifity of the ZKR with regard to the NFR-threshold (40 µV) were 92 % and 89 %. The EMG-values for control of catalepsis remained persistently on the low level of the baseline-rushing. All pigs demonstrated in accordance with this clinically an atonic muscle tone. Even with repeated post-dosing of Ketamine (up to 60 mg/kg in total) no negative side effects were observed regarding the vital parameters. Only the respiratory rate during the monitoring was marginally above the reference range due to the central-stimulating effect of Ketamine...|$|R
