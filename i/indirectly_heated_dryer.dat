40|$|The {{objective}} of this report is to demonstrate that a thorough assessment of {{the risks associated with}} the operation of the Rust Geotech patented VAC*TRAX mobile treatment unit (MTU) has been performed and documented. The MTU was developed to treat mixed wastes at the US Department of Energy (DOE) Albuquerque Operations Office sites. The MTU uses an <b>indirectly</b> <b>heated,</b> batch vacuum <b>dryer</b> to thermally desorb organic compounds from mixed wastes. This process hazards analysis evaluated 102 potential hazards. The three significant hazards identified involved the inclusion of oxygen in a process that also included an ignition source and fuel. Changes to the design of the MTU were made concurrent with the hazard identification and analysis; all hazards with initial risk rankings of 1 or 2 were reduced to acceptable risk rankings of 3 or 4. The overall risk to any population group from operation of the MTU was determined to be very low; the MTU is classified as a Radiological Facility with low hazards...|$|R

50|$|The {{rotary dryer}} {{is a type}} of {{industrial}} dryer employed to reduce or minimize the liquid moisture content of the material it is handling by bringing it into direct contact with a <b>heated</b> gas. The <b>dryer</b> is made up of a large, rotating cylindrical tube, usually supported by concrete columns or steel beams. The dryer slopes slightly so that the discharge end is lower than the material feed end in order to convey the material through the dryer under gravity. Material to be dried enters the dryer, and as the dryer rotates, the material is lifted up by a series of internal fins lining the inner wall of the dryer. When the material gets high enough to roll back off the fins, it falls back {{down to the bottom of}} the dryer, passing through the hot gas stream as it falls. This gas stream can either be moving toward the discharge end from the feed end (known as co-current flow), or toward the feed end from the discharge end (known as counter-current flow). The gas stream can be made up of a mixture of air and combustion gases from a burner, in which case the dryer is called a direct <b>heated</b> <b>dryer.</b> Alternatively, the gas stream may consist of air or another (sometimes inert) gas that is preheated. When the gas stream is preheated by some means where burner combustion gases do not enter the dryer, the dryer known as an indirect-heated type. Often, indirect <b>heated</b> <b>dryers</b> are used when product contamination is a concern. In some cases, a combination of direct-indirect <b>heated</b> rotary <b>dryers</b> are also available to improve the overall efficiency.|$|R

50|$|In-storage drying methods {{refers to}} those grain is dried {{and stored in}} the same container. Low-temperature drying, also known as near-ambient drying, is one of in-storage drying methods. There are four major factors which {{influence}} low temperature drying: the variability of weather, the harvest moisture content, the air flow in the storage bin {{and the amount of}} heated air. Most low-temperature dryers are built to dry grain as slowly as possible, while in the same time less spoilage on the grain. It is suggested that low temperature drying system is better operated when the average daily temperature is between 30 °C and 50 °C. Rather than control the drying air temperature, the low-temperature drying focuses on the relative humidity in order to achieve equilibrium moisture content (EMC) in all grain layers. Low-temperature drying process usually takes 5 days to several months depends on several important variables: weather, airflow, initial moisture content and amount of heat used. Among which, airflow is the key factor. Without appropriate airflow rate, spoilage will occur before drying is completed. By using heated air (LP heat, electric heat and solar heat), the relative humidity of the drying air is better controlled to achieve the desired moisture content. Usually, <b>heated</b> air <b>dryer</b> is used when the relative humidity larger than 70%. In electric <b>heat</b> <b>dryers,</b> an electrical resistant heater is usually placed before the fan to heat the airstream. In some case, a humidistat is employed to control the heater. In solar <b>heat</b> <b>dryers,</b> the drying air passes through the solar collector first to be heated (usually 10 to 12 °F rise), then enters the bin through the fan and motor. The advantages of in-storage low temperature drying are quick filling, high quality product, less equipment requirement; while the disadvantages are long drying time, electrical demand if using electric heat, high management skills and uncertain harvest moisture content.|$|R
