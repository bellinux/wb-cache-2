2500|$|If {{there are}} no NPV {{positive}} opportunities, i.e. projects where returns exceed the <b>hurdle</b> <b>rate,</b> and excess cash surplus is not needed, then – finance theory suggests – management should return {{some or all of}} the excess cash to shareholders as dividends.

For example, shareholders of a [...] "growth stock", expect that the company will, almost by definition, retain most of the excess cash surplus so as to fund future projects internally to help increase the value of the firm.|$|E
2500|$|Management must {{identify}} the [...] "optimal mix" [...] of financing – the capital structure {{that results in}} maximum firm value, (See Balance sheet, WACC) but must also take other factors into account (see trade-off theory below). Financing a project through debt results in a liability or obligation that must be serviced, thus entailing cash flow implications independent of the project's degree of success. Equity financing is less risky with respect to cash flow commitments, but results in a dilution of share ownership, control and earnings. The cost of equity (see CAPM and APT) is also typically higher {{than the cost of}} debt - which is, additionally, a deductible expense – and so equity financing may result in an increased <b>hurdle</b> <b>rate</b> which may offset any reduction in cash flow risk.|$|E

5000|$|A {{risk premium}} {{can also be}} {{attached}} to the <b>hurdle</b> <b>rate</b> if management feels that specific opportunities inherently contain more risk than others that could be pursued with the same resources. A common method for evaluating a <b>hurdle</b> <b>rate</b> is to apply the discounted cash flow method to the project, which is used in net present value models.

40|$|Too narrow a {{focus on}} {{overcoming}} organisational obstacles such as financial <b>hurdle</b> <b>rates</b> can often obstruct effective evaluation of investment in information technology (IT). To clear the <b>hurdle</b> <b>rates</b> with a minimum amount of organisational disturbance, evaluation procedures are often distorted.

In this paper, Barbara Farbey, David Targett and Frank Land focus {{on the need for}} a comprehensive search for benefits of IT investment and the placing of all those benefits firmly on the management agenda. Doing so makes it more likely that the benefits will be achieved and also brings several other advantages to the organisation. They present three models of frameworks as a basis for the search. The first is strategic, the second organisational and the third technological. In each case they have filled the frameworks with benefits of IT investment which they have recorded over several years of research, in different projects. They do not see the filled frameworks as definitive. Instead they see them as pointers to places where benefits might reasonably be looked for and a starting point for a pragmatic dialogue. ...|$|R
40|$|Rising elderly life expectancies {{imply the}} need to {{accumulate}} sufficient savings for retirement. This paper investigates the role of recent changes in the investment menu of the Singaporean Central Provident Fund (CPF) system. Our research explores the investment patterns of CPF participants and articulates their implications for policymakers. We find that most investors use their money for housing purchase and default the remainder to the CPF investment pool. The bulk of non-housing saving sits in bank accounts paying a low return. A fraction of workers does elect outside investment products, with high-income earners and males taking more risk than low-income earners and females. Since workers who default their money to the CPF fund receive a guaranteed 2. 5 % return on the Ordinary Account and 4 % on the Special Account, <b>hurdle</b> <b>rates</b> for money market and equity funds are substantial. These high <b>hurdle</b> <b>rates</b> help explain why few CPF account holders invest outside the default government in-vestment pool, though inertia probably explains why many employees let their funds sit in bank accounts earning low interest rates.

We conclude that the case for the Energy Paradox is weaker than has previously been believed. ...|$|R
