25|$|From a {{macroscopic}} perspective, {{in classical}} thermodynamics the entropy is {{interpreted as a}} state function of a thermodynamic system: that is, a property depending only on {{the current state of}} the system, independent of how that state came to be achieved. In any process where the system gives up energy ΔE, and its entropy falls by ΔS, a quantity at least TR ΔS of that energy must be given up to the system's surroundings as unusable <b>heat</b> (<b>TR</b> is the temperature of the system's external surroundings). Otherwise the process cannot go forward. In classical thermodynamics, the entropy of a system is defined only if it is in thermodynamic equilibrium.|$|E
40|$|The various {{allotropic}} {{modifications of}} selenium are reviewed. The phase change from amorphous to crystalline hexagonal {{form and the}} effect of heat treatments in the manufacture of selenium rectifiers is discussed. Two temperature zones are of paramount importance: one in the vicinity of 100 ~ C for optimum nucleation; and the second one close to the melting point (ca. 217 ~ C) for maximum crystal growth. It is shown that selenium will undergo grain growth displaying micro-structures similar to that encountered in metals. Very large grains can be obtained by prolonged <b>heat</b> <b>tr</b> ment. The phase change from the hexagonal to the amorphous form of selenium is also considered. Grain growth is very rapid just below the "melting point. " The grains, which enlarge in cross-section at the expense of their neighbors, have a characteristic robin's egg blue color under polarized light microscopy. At a further stage in their development, these polygonal grains elongate into biconvex-shaped grains surrounded by the amorphous phase, and then gradually dissolve and lose their identities. Photomicrographs of selenium at various stages of grain growth are presented...|$|E
40|$|The {{operator}} e −tA and the <b>heat</b> trace <b>Tr</b> e −tA, for t> 0, are {{investigated in}} the case when A is an elliptic differential operator on a manifold with conical singularities. Under a certain spectral condition (parameter–ellipticity) we obtain a full asymptotic expansion in t of the heat trace as t → 0 +. As in the smooth compact case, the problem is reduced to {{the investigation of the}} resolvent (A − λ) − 1. The main step will consist in approximating this operator family by a parametrix to A − λ using a suitable parameter–dependent calculus...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{uncertainty}} {{analysis of the}} temperature–resistance (TR) data of the newly developed temperature sensing fabric (TSF), which is a double-layer knitted structure fabricated on an electronic flat-bed knitting machine, made of polyester as a basal yarn, and embedded with fine metallic wire as sensing element. The measurement principle of the TSF is identical to temperature resistance detector (RTD); that is, change in resistance due to change in temperature. The regression uncertainty (uncertainty within repeats) and repeatability uncertainty (uncertainty among repeats) were estimated by analysing more than 300 TR experimental repeats of 50 TSF samples. The experiments were performed under dynamic heating and cooling environments on a purpose-built test rig within the temperature range of 20 – 50 °C. The continuous experimental data was recorded through LabVIEW-based graphical user interface. The result showed that temperature and resistance values were not only repeatable but reproducible, with only minor variations. The regression uncertainty {{was found to be}} less than ± 0. 3 °C; the TSF sample made of Ni and W wires showed regression uncertainty of ± 0. 18 °C). The cooling TR data showed considerably reduced values (± 0. 07 °C) of uncertainty in comparison with the <b>heating</b> <b>TR</b> data (± 0. 24 °C). The repeatability uncertainty was found to be less than ± 0. 5 °C. By increasing the number of samples and repeats, the uncertainties may be reduced further. The TSF could be used for continuous measurement of the temperature profile {{on the surface of the}} human body...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: To {{investigate}} the possible role of testicular orphan receptors (TR) TR 2, TR 3, and TR 4 {{in the process}} of germ cell apoptosis in the heat-treated testis of monkey, we have examined the spatiotemporal expression of the 3 TR mRNAs in relation to p 53 mRNA levels in the monkey testis by in situ hybridization and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction techniques. The results showed that TR 2 mRNA was confined to spermatocytes; TR 4 and TR 3 mRNAs were expressed in both spermatocytes and spermatids. The heat treatment did not change TR 2 mRNA level but significantly reduced TR 4 mRNA expression in spermatocytes on days 3 and 8 after the <b>heat</b> treatment. <b>TR</b> 3 mRNA expression was affected by the heat treatment in a time-dependent manner, with the lowest level on day 30 after the heat shock. Low to moderate signal for p 53 mRNA was detected in spermatocytes before treatment, which increased dramatically on days 3, 8, and 30 after the heat shock. The coincident expression of the testicular TR 3 and p 53 mRNA, spatially and time dependently, implied that the decrease in TR 3 expression in the heat-treated testis might be closely related to the p 53 signal pathway, whereas the temporal decrease in TR 4 production in the testis at the early stage indicated that this orphan receptor might be also involved in germ cell apoptosis. The data suggest that TR 3, TR 4, and p 53 could be important regulators of germ cell apoptosis induced by the <b>heat</b> treatment, whereas <b>TR</b> 2 might not be a key regulator in this process...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the neuroendocrine stress {{response}} to heat stress in trained (TR) versus untrained (UT) individuals may assist {{in identifying the}} mechanisms behind improved thermotolerance in TR individuals.

However, the impact of Tre on the stress hormones in TR and UT individuals is unclear.

40|$|Deep low dispersion, short {{wavelength}} IUE {{observations of}} 69 F dwarfs were studied by overexposing the long wavelength {{end of the}} SWP camera by up to 100 times {{in order to bring}} up the weak chromospheric and transition region (TR) emission lines. All but one of the stars observed shows evidence for stellar activity, as defined by the presence of large C II and C IV surface fluxes, with fluxes greater than 100, 000 ergs/sqcm/sec. There is no correlation between surface flux and the stellar rotation rate in the early F dwarfs. The TR surface fluxes increase systematically with decreasing B-V color, with no evidence for any decrease in the activity as the convection zones become very small. It is argued that there is a fundamental difference in the atmospheric heating mechanisms between early F dwarfs and solar-like stars. The <b>heating</b> of the <b>TR</b> in the early F dwarfs may be dominated by acoustic heating...|$|R
40|$|NASA has {{traditionally}} sought {{to reduce the}} likelihood of a single cell thermal runaway (TR) in their aerospace batteries to an absolute minimum by employing rigorous screening program of the cells. There was generally a belief that TR propagation resulting in catastrophic failure of the battery was a forgone conclusion for densely packed aerospace lithium-ion batteries. As it turns out, {{this may not be the}} case. An increasing number of purportedly TR propagation-resistant batteries are appearing among NASA partners in the commercial sector and the Department of Defense. In the recent update of the battery safety standard (JSC 20793) to address this paradigm shift, the NASA community included requirements for assessing TR severity and identifying simple, low-cost severity reduction measures. Unfortunately, there are no best-practice guidelines for this work in the Agency, so the first project team attempting to meet these requirements would have an undue burden placed upon them. A NASA engineering Safety Center (NESC) team set out to perform pathfinding activities for meeting those requirements. This presentation will provide contextual background to this effort, as well as initial results in attempting to model and simulate <b>TR</b> <b>heat</b> transfer and propagation within battery designs...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{randomized}} phase III {{trials have}} indicated that hyperthermia combined with radiation leads to significantly better tumour control of certain malignancies than does radiotherapy alone. Yet, the full capacity of such combined treatments {{might not have been}} optimally exploited as in vitro data indicate that repeated heating of cells can result in either the development of a transient heat resistance (thermotolerance) and/or the selection/induction of a stable heat resistant cell population. Although the mechanism of thermotolerance and its effect on thermo-radiotherapy has been studied extensively, little data are available on the mechanism of stable heat resistance and its impact on combined heat and radiation treatments. In the current study, a comprehensive analysis was made of the differences and similarities between thermotolerance (TT) and stable <b>heat</b> resistance (<b>TR)</b> in terms of the mechanism of resistance to the direct toxic action of heat {{and in terms of the}} impact on the extent of thermal radiosensitization. Using heat resistant mutants previously derived from a murine radiation-induced fibrosarcoma (RIF-I), it was observed that these cells were resistant to protein denaturation and aggregation in the cytoplasmic/membrane compartment (measured by ESR (electron spin resonance) analysis and by in situ thermal denaturation of the foreign firefly luciferase targeted to the cytoplasm) but not in the nuclear compartment (measured by TX- 100 insoluble nuclear proteins and by in situ thermal denaturation of luciferase targeted to the nucleus). RIF- 1 -TT cells, in contrast, were resistant for all endpoints tested. The lack of protection of nuclear heat damage in the RIF-TR cells could not be explained by a failure of one or more of the HSP 70 isoforms to enter the nuclei of these cells. In relation to the absence or presence of heat resistance in the nucleus, the extent of heat radiosensitization was reduced in RIF- 1 -TT but not RIF-TR cells. This implies that resistance for heat killing is not necessarily accompanied by a reduction in the ability of heat to enhance the cellular radiosensitivity. The data indicate that the mechanism leading to permanent resistance after repeated heating and the mechanism causing thermotolerance may share common features but are in part different...|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} the protective effect of {{heat shock protein}} (HSP) 70 on the acute lung injury (ALI) of rats with heat stroke. Methods Sixty four rats were randomly (by employing a random number table) assigned into a sham-heated group (Sham group), heat stress group (HS group), and HS plus gluttamine treatment group (HS+GLN group) and HS plus quercet in treatment group (HS+QU group), 16 each. All rats were housed in a artificial climate chamber, with the rats in the sham groups exposed to a temperature of 23 ℃ and humidity of 55 %± 5 %, while the rats of HS, HS+GLN and HS+QU groups to an ambient temperature of 39 ℃ and humidity of 65 %. During heat stress or sham <b>heating,</b> rectal temperature (<b>Tr),</b> systolic blood pressure (SBP) and pulse rate (PR) were monitored to observe the difference in heat stress response among the groups. The time {{point at which the}} SBP started to drop from the peak level was taken as the point of HS onset. At the onset of HS, heat exposure was terminated, then the rats were immediately removed from the chamber, and returned to room temperature. The rats were scarified 0 h and 6 h after HS onset respectively. After bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected, the lungs of all animals were harvested for pathological examination of lung injury. The concentrations of IL- 1 β, TNF-α and IL- 6 in BALF and HSP 70 in lung homogenate were measured by using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay kit. Results Compared with HS and HS+QU groups, the rats in HS+GLN group required significantly greater heat load to induce HS (P< 0. 001), and had longer survival time span after HS onset. Compared with Sham group, the concentration of HSP 70 in lung homogenate in HS group increased in a time-dependent manner (P< 0. 001). In comparison with HS group, the concentration of HSP 70 in lung homogenate from HS+GLN group was significantly elevated at each time point (P< 0. 001), while the treatment with QU significantly inhibited the expression of HSP 70 (P< 0. 001). The concentration of IL- 1 β, TNF-α and IL- 6 in BALF significantly decreased in HS+GLN group compared with those in HS group and HS+QU group (P< 0. 001). The pathological results showed that the lung injury was milder in HS+GLN group, while the opposite in HS+QU group. Conclusion HSP 70 could protect HS rats against ALI by enhancing their thermo-tolerance and inhibiting inflammatory response. 		 		DOI: 10. 11855 /j. issn. 0577 - 7402. 2017. 04. 0...|$|R
