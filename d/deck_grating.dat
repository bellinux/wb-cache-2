40|$|Fiber {{reinforced}} polymers (FRP) {{have become}} more popular construction materials {{in the last decade}} due to the reduction of material costs. The installation and performance evaluation of the first FRP-wrapped balsa wood bridge in Louisiana is described in this document. A comprehensive instrumentation and loading test scheme is discussed and details are illustrated. The selected bridge structure in this demonstration project will potentially provide a new approach to enhancing the transportation infrastructure in Louisiana. The test bridge is the Pierre Part Bridge located on route LA 70 in Assumption Parish, LADOTD District 61. The instrumentation consisted of regular strain gauges, fiber optic strain and temperature sensors, accelerometers, and acoustic emission sensors. The measured results from each of the gauges are summarized, and comparisons are made between the finite element models of the bridge structure and the field test results. Before placing the instrumentation on the field bridge, extensive laboratory explorations and numerical analysis were conducted and the research results have been documented in this report. Several years after the bridge had been opened to traffic, a delamination in one of the panels was observed. The deck was removed and replaced with a new <b>deck</b> <b>grating.</b> After a visual inspection and discussion with the fabricator, it turned out that a shifting on th...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{consists}} of study results {{of exposure to}} high frequency noise at metalworking workplaces. The study was carried out using objective methods (measurements of parameters characterizing the noise) and subjective studies (questionnaire survey). Metalworking workplaces were located in a steel structure (e. g. <b>deck</b> <b>gratings)</b> of the manufacturing plant. The results are equivalent sound pressure levels in the 1 / 3 octave frequency bands with center frequencies from 10 kHz to 40 kHz in reference to an 8 -hour workday equal to approximately 81 – 105 dB at most of the tested workplaces and exceed permissible values. The questionnaire survey of annoyance high frequency noise (i. e. in the audible frequency and low ultrasound range) was conducted among 52 operators of machines. Most of the workers describe the noise as: buzzing, insistent, whistling and high-pitched squeaky. Respondents specify the noise levels occurring at workplaces as: loud, impeding communication, highly strenuous and tiring...|$|R

40|$|Replacement of {{the steel}} <b>grating</b> <b>deck</b> on the lift span of the Morrison Bridge in Portland, OR, will utilize glass fiber {{reinforced}} polymer (FRP) panels to address ongoing maintenance issues of the deteriorated existing deck, improve driver safety and introduce bridge water runoff treatment. This report outlines the testing methods and results of an experimental program aimed primarily at evaluating a new open cell deck. While most FRP panels are connected via shear studs that are grouted within isolated pockets, the panels in this case were bolted directly to the steel stringers. Two different FRP deck options were evaluated for comparison: one with open cells and the other with more conventional closed box extrusions. The objective was to evaluate the strength of the FRP to steel stringer connection with individual bolt connection tests, the strength and fatigue resistance of the FRP decks themselves, and the relative lateral stiffness contribution of the panels. Additional related tests were also included t...|$|R

The objective was to evaluate the strength of the FRP to steel stringer connection with individual bolt connection tests, the strength and fatigue resistance of the FRP decks themselves, and the relative lateral stiffness contribution of the panels. Additional related tests were also included to complement the research effort such as the inclusion of tests on a closed box deck removed from the Broadway Bridge in Portland, OR, and strength tests of a retrofit attachment option of FRP deck to stringer using bolted clamps. While the monotonic, flexural, and shear strength of the deck exceeded the design values, the associated failure mode of the open cell panels was consistently via shear flow through the stem near the top flange. The residual displacement of failed FRP decks was found to be minimal, which would make visual identification of failed panels without applied load difficult in the field. Fatigue strength evaluation was conducted with two different protocols, where one was run to over 6 million cycles based on AASHTO defined loading and the other to 2 million cycles with higher than AASHTO defined loading. Fatigue failure was observed in only one specimen that was subjected to the higher loading condition, providing a sense of fatigue life of this material. Fatigue failure mode initiated in flexural fiber rupture, which was different to monotonic tests under the same loading configurations. Bolted deck to steel stringer connection tests indicated failure modes in the FRP with strength values that were in certain configurations well below the strength of the bolts. For cases where the bolted FRP deck was counted on to provide lateral stiffness, such as the case in the raised configuration of the bascule span, the closed cell was found to have approximately twice the stiffness. The results of these tests provide valuable data that can be applied to FRP bridge deck designs that utilize bolted connections and open and closed cell deck configurations under high traffic volumes...|$|R
