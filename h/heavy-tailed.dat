25|$|A {{large number}} of {{procedures}} {{have been developed for}} parameter estimation and inference in linear regression. These methods differ in computational simplicity of algorithms, presence of a closed-form solution, robustness with respect to <b>heavy-tailed</b> distributions, and theoretical assumptions needed to validate desirable statistical properties such as consistency and asymptotic efficiency.|$|E
25|$|Outliers {{can occur}} by chance in any distribution, {{but they often}} {{indicate}} either measurement error or that the population has a <b>heavy-tailed</b> distribution. In the former case one wishes to discard them or use statistics that are robust to outliers, while {{in the latter case}} they indicate that the distribution has high skewness and that one should be very cautious in using tools or intuitions that assume a normal distribution. A frequent cause of outliers is a mixture of two distributions, which may be two distinct sub-populations, or may indicate 'correct trial' versus 'measurement error'; this is modeled by a mixture model.|$|E
25|$|For {{practical}} purposes, different {{measures of}} location and dispersion are often compared {{on the basis}} of how well the corresponding population values can be estimated from a sample of data. The median, estimated using the sample median, has good properties in this regard. While it is not usually optimal if a given population distribution is assumed, its properties are always reasonably good. For example, a comparison of the efficiency of candidate estimators shows that the sample mean is more statistically efficient than the sample median when data are uncontaminated by data from <b>heavy-tailed</b> distributions or from mixtures of distributions, but less efficient otherwise, and that the efficiency of the sample median is higher than that {{for a wide range of}} distributions. More specifically, the median has a 64% efficiency compared to the minimum-variance mean (for large normal samples), which is to say the variance of the median will be ~50% greater than the variance of the mean—see asymptotic efficiency and references therein.|$|E
2500|$|The {{standard}} deviation and the expected absolute deviation can both {{be used as}} an indicator of the [...] "spread" [...] of a distribution. [...] The {{standard deviation}} is more amenable to algebraic manipulation than the expected absolute deviation, and, together with variance and its generalization covariance, is used frequently in theoretical statistics; however the expected absolute deviation tends to be more robust as it is less sensitive to outliers arising from measurement anomalies or an unduly <b>heavy-tailed</b> distribution.|$|E
2500|$|The {{value of}} the normal {{distribution}} is practically zero when the value [...] lies {{more than a few}} standard deviations away from the mean. Therefore, it may not be an appropriate model when one expects a significant fraction of outliers—values that lie many standard deviations away from the mean—and least squares and other statistical inference methods that are optimal for normally distributed variables often become highly unreliable when applied to such data. In those cases, a more <b>heavy-tailed</b> distribution should be assumed and the appropriate robust statistical inference methods applied.|$|E
50|$|All long-tailed {{distributions}} are <b>heavy-tailed,</b> but {{the converse}} is false, {{and it is}} possible to construct <b>heavy-tailed</b> distributions that are not long-tailed.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} {{important}} subclasses of <b>heavy-tailed</b> distributions: the fat-tailed distributions, the long-tailed distributions and the subexponential distributions. In practice, all commonly used <b>heavy-tailed</b> distributions {{belong to the}} subexponential class.|$|E
50|$|All {{commonly}} used <b>heavy-tailed</b> distributions are subexponential.|$|E
5000|$|A fat-tailed {{distribution}} is a distribution {{for which the}} probability density function, for large x, goes to zero as a power [...] Since such a power is always bounded below by the probability density function of an exponential distribution, fat-tailed distributions are always <b>heavy-tailed.</b> Some distributions, however, have a tail which goes to zero slower than an exponential function (meaning they are <b>heavy-tailed),</b> but faster than a power (meaning they are not fat-tailed). An example is the log-normal distribution. Many other <b>heavy-tailed</b> distributions such as the log-logistic and Pareto distribution are however also fat-tailed.|$|E
50|$|One simple {{example of}} a <b>heavy-tailed</b> {{distribution}} is the Pareto distribution.|$|E

50|$|<b>Heavy-tailed</b> {{distributions}} {{have been}} observed in many natural phenomena including both physical and sociological phenomena. Mandelbrot established the use of <b>heavy-tailed</b> distributions to model real-world fractal phenomena, e.g. Stock markets, earthquakes, climate, and the weather.Ethernet, WWW, SS7, TCP, FTP, TELNET and VBR video (digitised video of the type that is transmitted over ATM networks) traffic is self-similar.|$|E
5000|$|There {{is still}} some {{discrepancy}} {{over the use of}} the term <b>heavy-tailed.</b> There are two other definitions in use. Some authors use the term to refer to those distributions which do not have all their power moments finite; and some others to those distributions that do not have a finite variance. The definition given in this article is the most general in use, and includes all distributions encompassed by the alternative definitions, as well as those distributions such as log-normal that possess all their power moments, yet which are generally acknowledged to be <b>heavy-tailed.</b> (Occasionally, <b>heavy-tailed</b> is used for any distribution that has heavier tails than the normal distribution.) ...|$|E
50|$|Bandwidth {{selection}} for kernel density estimation of <b>heavy-tailed</b> distributions {{is said to}} be relatively difficult.|$|E
50|$|Many {{processes}} are technically long-range dependent but not self-similar. The {{differences between these}} two phenomena are subtle. <b>Heavy-tailed</b> refers to a probability distribution, and long-range dependent refers to a property of a time series and so these should be used with care and a distinction should be made. The terms are distinct although superpositions of samples from <b>heavy-tailed</b> distributions aggregate to form long-range dependent time series.|$|E

50|$|The {{ability to}} {{accurately}} forecast request patterns {{is an important}} requirement of capacity planning. A practical consequence of burstiness and <b>heavy-tailed</b> and correlated arrivals is difficulty in capacity planning.|$|E
50|$|Previous {{analytic}} {{work done}} in Internet studies adopted assumptions such as exponentially-distributed packet inter-arrivals, and conclusions reached under such assumptions may be misleading or incorrect {{in the presence of}} <b>heavy-tailed</b> distributions.|$|E
50|$|A long-tailed or <b>heavy-tailed</b> {{probability}} distribution {{is one that}} assigns relatively high probabilities to regions far from the mean or median. A more formal mathematical definition is given below. In the context of teletraffic engineering a number of quantities of interest {{have been shown to}} have a long-tailed distribution. For example, if we consider the sizes of files transferred from a web-server, then, to a good degree of accuracy, the distribution is <b>heavy-tailed,</b> that is, there are a large number of small files transferred but, crucially, the number of very large files transferred remains a major component of the volume downloaded.|$|E
5000|$|Often {{the ratio}} {{distributions}} are <b>heavy-tailed,</b> {{and it may}} be difficult to work with such distributions and develop an associated statistical test.A method based on the median has been suggested as a [...] "work-around".|$|E

50|$|Methods {{to fit a}} phase type {{distribution}} to data can be classified as maximum likelihood methods or moment matching methods. Fitting a phase type {{distribution to}} <b>heavy-tailed</b> distributions {{has been shown to}} be practical in some situations.|$|E
50|$|Some of {{them can}} even {{probably}} learn mixtures of <b>heavy-tailed</b> distributions including those withinfinite variance (see links to papers below).In this setting, EM based methods would not work, since the Expectation step would diverge due to presence ofoutliers.|$|E
50|$|Herein a <b>heavy-tailed</b> Student-t {{distribution}} (with one-degree of freedom, {{which is}} the same as a Cauchy distribution) is used to measure similarities between low-dimensional points in order to allow dissimilar objects to be modeled far apart in the map.|$|E
50|$|In some situations, the {{increase}} in precision for larger sample sizes is minimal, or even non-existent. This can result from the presence of systematic errors or strong dependence in the data, or if the data follows a <b>heavy-tailed</b> distribution.|$|E
