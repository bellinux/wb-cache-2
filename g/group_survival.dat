25|$|It is also {{typical for}} {{biological}} functions to be modulated by or synchronized to external events or conditions. The circadian rhythm and synchronization of mating behaviour to planetary cues are examples. In {{the case of}} ageing seen as a biological function, the caloric restriction effect may well {{be an example of}} the ageing function being modulated in order to optimize organism lifespan in response to external conditions. Temporary extension of lifespan under famine conditions would aid in <b>group</b> <b>survival</b> because extending lifespan, combined with less-frequent reproduction, would reduce the resources required to maintain a given population.|$|E
500|$|Common {{attachment}} behaviours and emotions, {{displayed in}} most social primates including humans, are adaptive. The long-term evolution {{of these species}} has involved selection for social behaviors that make individual or <b>group</b> <b>survival</b> more likely. The commonly observed attachment behaviour of toddlers staying near familiar people would have had safety advantages in the environment of early adaptation, and has similar advantages today. Bowlby saw the environment of early adaptation as similar to current hunter-gatherer societies. There is a survival advantage in the capacity to sense possibly dangerous conditions such as unfamiliarity, being alone, or rapid approach. According to Bowlby, proximity-seeking to the attachment figure {{in the face of}} threat is the [...] "set-goal" [...] of the attachment behavioural system.|$|E

The methodology for <b>grouped</b> <b>survival</b> data is based on life tables, where the times are grouped in k intervals, and we fit discrete lifetime {{regression model}}s to the data. The model parameters are estimated by maximum likelihood and jackknife methods. To detect influential observations in the proposed model, diagnostic measures based on case deletion, so-called global influence, and influence measures based on small perturbations in the data or in the model, referred to as local influence, are used. In addition to these measures, the total local influence and influential estimates are also used. We conduct Monte Carlo simulation studies to assess the finite sample behavior of the maximum likelihood estimators of the proposed model for <b>grouped</b> <b>survival.</b> A real data set is analyzed using a regression model for grouped data...|$|R

In some situations, event times might be censored into different, possibly overlapping intervals of variable widths; however, in other situations, information is available for all units at the same observed visit time. In the latter cases, interval-censored data are termed <b>grouped</b> <b>survival</b> data. Here we present alternative approaches for analyzing interval-censored data. We illustrate these techniques using a survival data set involving mango tree lifetimes. This study {{is an example of}} <b>grouped</b> <b>survival</b> data.

2500|$|The World Bank {{has long}} been criticized by {{non-governmental}} organizations, such as the indigenous rights <b>group</b> <b>Survival</b> International, and academics, including its former Chief Economist Joseph Stiglitz, Henry Hazlitt and Ludwig Von Mises. Henry Hazlitt argued that the World Bank along with the monetary system it was designed within would promote world inflation and [...] "a world in which international trade is State-dominated" [...] when they were being advocated. Stiglitz argued that the so-called free market reform policies that the Bank advocates are often harmful to economic development if implemented badly, too quickly ("shock therapy"), in the wrong sequence or in weak, uncompetitive economies. Similarly, Carmine Guerriero notices that these reforms have introduced in developing countries regulatory institutions typical of the common law legal tradition because allegedly more efficient according to the legal origins theory. The latter however has been fiercely criticized since {{it does not take}} into account that the legal institutions transplanted during the European colonization have been then reformed. This issue makes the legal origins theory's inference unreliable and the Work Bank reforms detrimental.|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{regression}} models are evaluated for <b>grouped</b> <b>survival</b> data when {{the effect of}} censoring time is considered in the model and the regression structure is modeled through four link functions. The methodology for <b>grouped</b> <b>survival</b> data is based on life tables, and the times are grouped in k intervals so that ties are eliminated. Thus, the data modeling is performed by considering the discrete models of lifetime regression. The model parameters are estimated by using the maximum likelihood and jackknife methods. To detect influential observations in the proposed models, diagnostic measures based on case deletion, which are denominated global influence, and influence measures based on small perturbations in the data or in the model, referred to as local influence, are used. In addition to those measures, the local influence and the total influential estimate are also employed. Various simulation studies are performed and compared {{to the performance of}} the four link functions of the {{regression models}} for <b>grouped</b> <b>survival</b> data for different parameter settings, sample sizes and numbers of intervals. Finally, a data set is analyzed by using the proposed regression models. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
