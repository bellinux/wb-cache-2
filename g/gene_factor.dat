5000|$|HOX B6 gene is only {{expressed}} in erythoid progenitor cells, {{which are the}} precursor to red blood cells used for transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide throughout the body. During development, {{the formation of the}} HOX <b>gene</b> <b>factor</b> happens in the first stages of fetal development, namely soon after the establishment of the mesoderm, which is the “middle layer” of the future embryo. However, HOX B6 is only expressed once the undifferentiated stem cells of the embryo distinguish themselves into the erythpoietic phase. The research has shown that HOX B6 is not {{expressed in}} hematopoietic stem cells located in the red bone marrow, which are the precursor cells to all types of blood cells, or primordial germ cells (PGCs), the precursor to cells passed on in each generation. [...] Since it is a transcriptional factor, HOX B6 regulates erythpoigenesis (red blood cell formation) using mRNA as the basis for certain protein productions. The specific <b>gene</b> <b>factor</b> for erytopoigenesis has relatively been unobserved in the scientific community, and no known diseases have been associated with a defect HOX B6 gene. However, it has been shown in correlation with major skeletal deformations.|$|E
50|$|The {{first two}} STAT {{proteins}} {{were identified in}} the interferon system. There are seven mammalian STAT family members that have been identified: STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, STAT4, STAT5 (STAT5A and STAT5B), and STAT6. STAT1 homodimers are involved in type II interferon signalling, and bind to the GAS (Interferon-Gamma Activated Sequence) promoter to induce expression of ISG (Interferon Stimulated Genes). In type I interferon signaling, STAT1-STAT2 heterodimer combines with IRF9 (Interferon Response Factor) to form ISGF3 (Interferon Stimulated <b>Gene</b> <b>Factor),</b> which binds to the ISRE (Interferon-Stimulated Response Element) promoter to induce ISG expression.|$|E

IL-28A and IL-28B belong to the type III interferon family of cytokines and are highly similar (in amino acid sequence) to IL-29.

40|$|Murine polyoma virus (MPyV) {{is a small}} DNA {{virus that}} induces tumors in {{multiple}} tissues of infected host. In this investigation, we show that cell lines derived from wild type virus-induced breast tumors are resistant to the growth inhibitory action of interferon β (IFN-β). Furthermore, replication of heterologous viruses such as vesicular stomatitis virus and encephalomyocarditis virus was not inhibited by IFN-β in these cells. This effect was due to inhibition of IFN-stimulated gene expression by viral T antigen. Activation of IFN-stimulated <b>gene</b> <b>factor</b> 3 was inhibited in cells derived from a tumor induced by wild-type MPyV but not those from a mutant that lacks the pRB binding site of the large T antigen. Similarly IFN-γ-inducible gene expression was also inhibited in cells transformed by wild-type virus.

40|$|In myeloid {{dendritic}} cells, {{activation of}} the IL- 27 p 28 gene is selectively induced by ligands of TLR 4 or TLR 3, both coupled to the Toll/IL- 1 R-related domain-containing adaptor-inducing IFN/IFN regulatory factor (IRF) 3 pathway. In response to both ligands, autocrine type 1 IFN production was required for optimal IL- 27 p 28 expression. Type I IFN signaling was necessary for sustained IRF 1 activation and formation of the IRF 9 -containing IFN-stimulated <b>gene</b> <b>factor</b> 3 complex. Indeed, we demonstrated that IRF 1 and IRF 9 are sequentially activated and recruited to the IL- 27 p 28 IFN-stimulated regulatory element site. Involvement of IRF 1 and IRF 9 in the induction of IL- 27 p 28 was confirmed in vitro and upon in vivo exposure to TLR ligands. Thus, in response to TLR 4 or TLR 3 ligation, the initial induction of the IL- 27 p 28 gene depends on the recruitment of IRF 1 and IRF 3, whereas transcriptional amplification requires recruitment of the IFN-stimulated <b>gene</b> <b>factor</b> 3 complex.

Concurrent with the widely accepted diathesis-stress model, if an individual has a predisposition towards developing addictions, this alone will not cause problems. It is encountering a stress in the environment that causes the addiction to manifest. Experience with trauma appears to make someone more prone to addictions, especially “severe childhood stress”. Examples such as physical or sexual abuse, and unpredictable expectations and behavior of parents, increase a person's risk for developing addiction.|$|R

This array was further used to study the kinetics of transcription <b>factor</b> <b>gene</b> expression change of dark-grown seedlings in response to blue light {{and the role of}} specific photoreceptors in this blue-light regulation. The expression of about 20 % of those transcription <b>factor</b> <b>genes</b> are responsive to blue-light exposure, with 249 and 115 genes up or down-regulated, respectively. A large portion of blue-light-responsive transcription <b>factor</b> <b>genes</b> exhibited very rapid expression changes in response to blue light, earlier than the bulk of blue-light-regulated genes. This result suggests the involvement of transcription cascades in blue-light control of genome expression.
