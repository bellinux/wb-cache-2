40|$|At {{the turn}} of the century, only {{pendulum}} apparatuses and torsion balances were available for general exploration work. Both of these early techniques were cumbersome and time-consuming. It was no wonder that the development of the <b>gravity</b> <b>meter</b> was welcomed with a universal sigh of relief. By 1935 potential field measurements with <b>gravity</b> <b>meters</b> supplanted gradient measurements with torsion balances. Potential field measurements are generally characterized by three types: absolute - measurements are made in fundamental units, traceable to national standards of length and time at each observation site; relative with absolute scale - differences in gravity are measured in fundamental units traceable to national standards of length and time; and relative - differences in gravity are measured with arbitrary scale. Improvements in the design of <b>gravity</b> <b>meters</b> since their introduction has led to a significant reduction in size and greatly increased precision. As the precision increased, applications expanded to include the measurement of crustal motion, the search for non-Newtonian forces, archeology, and civil engineering. Apart from enhancements to the astatic <b>gravity</b> <b>meter,</b> few developments in hardware were achieved. One of these was the vibrating string <b>gravity</b> <b>meter</b> which was developed in the 1950 s and was employed briefly for marine and borehole applications. Another is the cryogenic <b>gravity</b> <b>meter</b> which utilizes the stability of superconducting current to achieve a relative instrument with extremely low drift suitable for tidal and secular gravity measurements.

40|$|<b>Gravity</b> <b>meters</b> are {{commonly}} used to map spatial changes in the earth’s gravity, achieving resolution of parts per billion on microgravity surveys. The application of gravity surveys to monitor change and recent improvements in gravity instrumentation will be summarized. The use of gravity to track the progress of a waterflood in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, provides a 4 D Gravity case history. The surface gravity change caused by the injection of water into the gas cap is measured annually and compared to the expected change calculated from the reservoir model. Monitoring injected products using non-intrusive, inexpensive surface gravity measurements provides an effective “early warning system ” for injection and sequestration projects. A recent borehole gravity survey in Hanford, Washington, demonstrates the ability to measure bulk densities using a borehole gravimeter. The applications include geotechnical studies at waste disposal sites, bridges and structures, locating and monitoring thief zones in reservoirs, and grade control in iron mines.

Kunming GS 15 <b>gravity</b> <b>meter</b> from 2007 continuous gravity observation has been carried out with the sampling rate of the pressure observation. In this study, we first compare the effects of 4 types of <b>gravity</b> <b>meter</b> and 3 different types of stations on the gravity observed seasonal gravity signals. It is indicated that the observed seasonal gravity signal of the cave is only 1 / 10, and there is a constant temperature and constant pressure device. Compared with the same time, the gravity signal of the gravity signal is about 100 times smaller. The influence of the pressure load of the <b>gravity</b> <b>meter</b> is tested by using the theory of pressure. The results show that only the actual value of 2 cpd - 3 cpd pressure load varies from - 0. 395 to - 0. 280 × 10 - 8 ms- 2, and the 1 cpd to 1 cpm periodic partial type <b>gravity</b> <b>meter</b> is also in accordance with the law of gravity and air pressure.

40|$|International audienceWe {{acquired}} {{continuous series}} of microgravity measurements using several Scintrex CG- 3 M <b>gravity</b> <b>meters</b> {{for several weeks}} in 1997. The meters with 1 mGal resolution were installed {{side by side in}} a stable reference station at the ORSTOM research centre to perform identical data acquisition. We present and compare the instrumental responses obtained for the various <b>gravity</b> <b>meters</b> (measurement series of gravity field, standard deviation, internal temperature, tilts) and analyse their correlation with simultaneous recordings of meteorological parameters. The data have been processed in order to (1) establish the mid-to long-term relative stability and the accuracy of the instruments, (2) estimate the contribution of instrumental effects to gravity data measurements and (3) quantify the amplitude of the time variations of the gravity field that might be detected with such instruments. This study emphasizes the sensitivity of some instrumental responses of the Scintrex CG- 3 M <b>gravity</b> <b>meters</b> (such as internal temperature or tilt) to local atmospheric-pressure variations. This sensitivity can lead to non-negligible perturbations of the gravity measurements through automatic corrections applied in real-time mode by the integrated software. We show that most of these instrumental artefacts can be easily removed in data post-processing by using simultaneous atmospheric-pressure data. After removal of an accurate Earth tide model, the instrumental drift and the instrumental effects, the temporal series are compared by computing differential signals. These residual signals obtained {{over a period of several}} weeks exhibit the following characteristics: (1) the gravity residuals have a maximum amplitude ranging from 5 to 10 mGal and from 10 to 15 μGal for filtered and unfiltered data, respectively; and (2) the standard error, tilts and internal temperature measurements of the various <b>gravity</b> <b>meters</b> are very consistent; their respective residual amplitudes are ± 2 mGal, ± 3 arcsec and ± 0. 05 mK. In order to calibrate the <b>gravity</b> <b>meters</b> precisely in the measurement range used in this study, we have measured a calibration line established in the framework of the fourth intercomparison of absolute and relative <b>gravity</b> <b>meters.</b> This calibration was achieved with an accuracy of 5 μGal. This result is consistent with other field tests already performed with such <b>gravity</b> <b>meters.</b> In addition, we also checked the accuracy of the tilt sensors by increasing the electronic read-out by a factor of 10. The tilt response of the whole <b>gravity</b> <b>meter</b> to a small induced inclinometric variation indicates that the precision of the tilt measurements is about a few tenths of an arc second. This study reveals that temporal variations of the gravity field could potentially be detected in the field with an accuracy of about 5 – 15 mGal by permanent networks of Scintrex CG- 3 M <b>gravity</b> <b>meters</b> set up a few kilometres apart. This result is of particular interest in field surveys of temporal gravity changes related to some environmental or geodynamical processes, where the expected gravity variations are greater than a few tens of mGal. In particular, in volcanological applications, the continuous monitoring of active volcanoes with such permanent networks of <b>gravity</b> <b>meters</b> co-located with subcentimetre-accuracy GPS receivers should be very helpful to understand internal magmatic processes better and to detect possible gravity and inclinometric signals occurring during pre-eruptive phases.

40|$|Abstract. The precise {{calibration}} {{of relative}} <b>gravity</b> <b>meters</b> {{is essential for}} the accuracy of gravimetric surveys. We show that in the new Zugspitze cali-bration system established in 2004 – 2005 excellent accuracies of the linear calibration factor of relative <b>gravity</b> <b>meters</b> in the range of 1 – 2 * 10 - 5 can be obtained. The calibration system is particularly useful for the precise calibration of Scintrex linear quartz <b>gravity</b> <b>meters.</b> The key advantages of the new calibration system are (a) the large gravity range of up to 528 mGal and (b) the short transport time of instruments by cable cars between the ab-solute gravity reference stations. This allows im-proving the accuracy of the Scintrex relative gra-vimetric observations by carrying out numerous ties over large gravity differences in a day or less. We study the accuracy and repeatability of Scintrex CG 3 and CG 5 calibration observations and the influence of seasonal effects due to environmental mass changes based on a time series of 57 calibra-tion experiments over a period of 22 months.

40|$|Using a <b>dynamic</b> <b>gravity</b> equation, we {{show that}} the {{national}} product differentiation model explains food and agricultural trade more properly, while the product differentiation model is more appropriate to explain large-scale manufacturing trade. In this context, our result is {{not consistent with the}} one found by Head and Ries (2001) in the short-run. The intuitive explanation for this result is that inward foreign direct investment can occur through either merger or acquisition in the short-run. Second, the pattern of bilateral trade could quickly adjust to changes in relative income between countries. Furthermore, we illustrate the positive impacts of world income growth on bilateral trade, which is in sharp contrast with the conventional analysis. This reveals yet another way to test the pattern of bilateral trade. <b>dynamic</b> <b>gravity</b> equation, national product differentiation, product differentiation, world income growth, International Relations/Trade,...|$|R
40|$|Groundwater {{provides}} a fundamental resource for modern life. Throughout the world, groundwater is managed by storing (recharging) it underground in natural aquifers for future withdrawal and consumptive use. In Arizona, over 4 million people benefit from managed aquifer storage, but little effort {{is made to}} track the movement of recharged water through the subsurface. Motivated by current limitations {{in our ability to}} monitor percolation and groundwater movement at the scale of a recharge facility, an effort to collect time-lapse gravity data was carried out at the Southern Avra Valley Storage and Recovery Project (SAVSARP) operated by the City of Tucson, Arizona. In addition to collecting water-level data 12 wells, there were three primary gravity experiments: (1) five continuously-recording <b>gravity</b> <b>meters</b> (2 iGrav superconducting <b>gravity</b> <b>meters</b> and 3 gPhone <b>gravity</b> <b>meters)</b> were installed semi-permanently in control buildings adjacent to the recharge basins, (2) absolute gravity measurements were made at nine locations over a 17 month period, and (3) three relative-gravity campaigns were carried out on a network of 70 stations. This large-scale controlled experiment, with known infiltration and pumping rates, resulted {{in one of the most}} comprehensive datasets of its kind. Gravity data led to several hydrologic insights, both through direct measurement and modeling. First, the infiltration rate could be estimated accurately based on the initial rate of gravity change during infiltration, regardless of the specific yield. Using two <b>gravity</b> <b>meters,</b> the depth, and therefore speed, of the wetting front beneath a recharge basin was observed, including the time at which the water table was reached. Spatial maps of gravity change from relative gravity surveys show areas where infiltration efficiency is highest, and where groundwater accumulates; storage accumulated preferentially to the west of the recharge basins, away from pumping wells. Such information would be valuable for planning the location of pumping wells at a new facility. Gravity data were useful for calibration of a Modflow-NWT groundwater-flow model using the Unsaturated Zone Flow package to simulate recharge; the reduction in the posterior parameter distribution compared to the a priori estimate was substantial and similar to head data. In contrast to model-simulated head data, model-simulated gravity data were less sensitive to more distant model elements and more effective for calibration of a superposition-type model. Observed head data had a strong regional signal reflecting basin-scale conditions with only minor variation associated with individual recharge basins, and were therefore of limited usefulness for model calibration. Together, the methods developed by the study and interpretations they made possible suggest that gravity data are an effective way to better understand large-scale infiltration and groundwater movement...|$|R
