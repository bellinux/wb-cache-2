5|$|Although he {{continued}} to use rotoscoping in American Pop, Hey Good Lookin', and Fire and Ice, Bakshi later regretted his use of rotoscoping, stating that he <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a mistake to trace the source footage rather than {{using it as a}} guide.|$|E
5|$|While Queen Maya <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{the time}} to give birth, {{she went to the}} Lumbini park outside the Kapilavastu city. She stood under a plaksa tree, holding one branch with her right hand, and she gave birth to a son, Prince Siddhartha. The story on the panels {{continues}} until the prince becomes the Buddha.|$|E
5|$|After Quatermass and the Pit Kneale <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> time to {{rest the}} character. By the early 1970s he had decided there were new avenues to explore, and the BBC planned a fourth Quatermass serial in 1972. The BBC did not proceed with the project, and Kneale's scripts were {{produced}} in 1979 as a four-part serial for Thames Television titled Quatermass.|$|E
5000|$|An August-September 2006 Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research poll on {{abortion}} {{to save the}} life of the mother found that 20% of Nicaraguans <b>felt</b> strongly <b>that</b> <b>it</b> should <b>be</b> [...] "legal", 49% <b>felt</b> somewhat <b>that</b> <b>it</b> should <b>be</b> [...] "legal", 18% <b>felt</b> strongly <b>that</b> <b>it</b> should <b>be</b> [...] "illegal", and 10% <b>felt</b> somewhat <b>that</b> <b>it</b> should <b>be</b> [...] "illegal".|$|R

5000|$|Nicaragua: An August-September 2006 Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research poll on the {{legality}} of abortion to save a woman's life found that 20% of respondents <b>felt</b> strongly <b>that</b> <b>it</b> should <b>be</b> [...] "legal", 49% <b>felt</b> somewhat <b>that</b> <b>it</b> should <b>be</b> [...] "legal", 18% <b>felt</b> strongly <b>that</b> <b>it</b> should <b>be</b> [...] "illegal", and 10% <b>felt</b> somewhat <b>that</b> <b>it</b> should <b>be</b> [...] "illegal".|$|R
5|$|Although Brumund's {{publication}} included {{drawings of}} Borobudur, the Batavia Society still <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> incomplete. In April 1873, van Kinsbergen {{set off to}} the monument. Cleaning, digging and other technical difficulties delayed his start in taking pictures until August that year. The wet monsoon season further hampered his work, resulting {{in a series of}} only 43 photographs taken between August to December. The Society was disappointed with the number of photographs, although satisfied with the printing and artistic quality.|$|E
5|$|Bohr became {{convinced}} that light behaved like both waves and particles, and in 1927, experiments confirmed the de Broglie hypothesis that matter (like electrons) also behaved like waves. He conceived the philosophical principle of complementarity: that items could have apparently mutually exclusive properties, such as being a wave or a stream of particles, depending on the experimental framework. He <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not fully understood by professional philosophers.|$|E
5|$|In {{regards to}} the English dub, Shinkai {{did not feel that}} he could judge the quality of the voice acting since he could not speak English natively. He <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> good due to the {{feedback}} he had received and because he could feel the emotion in the characters' voices. However, he noted that the experience would be different for viewers and that the final judgment could only be made by English-speaking audiences.|$|E
30|$|Sabha: My friend left me alone. She told me: “Proceed by yourself”. But I <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{very hard}} for me. Anyway, at night, I wrote the shown parts of the story on paper.|$|R
50|$|Following {{on almost}} {{immediately}} from {{the events of}} Seduced by Moonlight, A Stroke of Midnight begins with Merry and the Ravens attending {{a press conference in}} the sithen. This is highly unusual as the home of the sidhe is usually off-limits to the human press. However, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> more secure than holding the conference elsewhere.|$|R
5000|$|Vaughan Healey of Cyclic Defrost <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> [...] "a deceptively dense album: full of laddish appeal but {{balanced}} by peculiar turns, strong production values and a lyrical depth" [...] with its tracks [...] "structured around sophisticated metaphor and clever metre" [...] and [...] "it continues the Obese tradition of releasing idiosyncratic, upfront local hiphop." ...|$|R
5|$|In {{the weeks}} {{following}} the release, Howse worked on updates {{to stabilize the}} game and provide a better experience for players. In addition, he plans to add new features, such as a friendly mode; another mode that allows people to set up teams; and {{a way for the}} player to choose a server to play on. Howse said that two major gaming companies had approached him to buy Slither.io. He had considered the idea, since he <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> stressful to maintain the game.|$|E
5|$|Kana Hanazawa {{stated that}} she was happy to have been {{selected}} to be in Steins;Gate as she <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not common {{to be able to}} play a part in a serious game. She also thought that the game gives the player more of a thrilling sensation rather than a frightening one and it entices the player to continue reading.|$|E
5|$|Skirth {{gave the}} memoir to his {{daughter}} Jean in 1975, two years {{before his death in}} 1977 Although for many years she found it too upsetting to read in full, she <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a story that should be shared with others, and in 1999 she donated four of the five ring binders, containing the bulk of the memoir but excluding its more personal sections, to the Imperial War Museum in London, where they remain to this day.|$|E
5000|$|... "The Village Green Preservation Society" [...] {{generally}} received positive reviews. Rolling Stone magazine {{praised the}} songs vocals {{and stated that}} [...] "the tune, the rhythm, are more of a delight with each verse". AllMusic's Stewart Mason <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> the song was [...] "one of Davies' sweetest creations", but <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> overrated and not as successful lyrically as 1967's [...] "Autumn Almanac".|$|R
5000|$|November 18, 2016: Yousef Taha officially {{announced}} that he left the country back to his hometown Kuwait, thereby ending his PBA career. Taha, though not officially retiring, said that he left for personal reasons and [...] "he <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> best for him to not continue his PBA career". Taha played for five different teams in his 4 seasons in the league.|$|R

5|$|The League Cup {{was clearly}} not one of Ferguson's main {{priorities}} of the season, as he used it to blood the younger and less-known players. After being swept aside {{in the third round}} by Ipswich Town – a team {{at the bottom of the}} First Division – Ferguson came under intense scrutiny for fielding a reshuffled squad. However, the manager <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> at the time, an unwanted domestic distraction.|$|E
5|$|The book {{became a}} bestseller and was well {{received}} by {{graduates of the}} est training. Reviewers generally commented that the book was favorable to Erhard, {{and a number of}} critics <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> unduly so, or lacked objectivity, citing Bartley's close relationship to Erhard. Responses to the writing were mixed; while some reviewers found it well written and entertaining, others felt the tone was too slick, promotional, or hagiographic.|$|E
5|$|Written by Ben Aaronovitch, {{this story}} {{concerned}} privatisation. This idea was submitted in May 1987, the then script editor Andrew Cartmel liked {{some of the}} concepts, but he <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> generally inappropriate for Doctor Who, {{and that there were}} too many supporting characters. However, Andrew Cartmel encouraged Ben Aaronovitch to pitch more stories, and led to the story Remembrance of the Daleks.|$|E

30|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{problems}} with the antibiotic trials in COPD exacerbations; particularly with issues of lack of placebo control, poorly defined patient groups, lack of follow-up data and the endpoints measured [78, 79]. In many trials <b>it</b> has <b>been</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not ethical to withhold antibiotics (i.e. use a placebo) so typically designs have compared one antibiotic with another [78, 80].|$|R
5|$|During the 1920s, Victoria had repressive and {{restrictive}} drinking laws, {{including the}} notorious six o'clock closing. Blamey took {{the position that}} it was the job of the police to enforce the laws, even if they did not support them. Many members of the public did not agree with this attitude, maintaining that the police should not uphold such laws. Almost as controversially, Blamey drew a sharp distinction between his personal life and his job. His presence in a hotel after closing time was always welcome, as it meant that drinking could continue, for it was known {{that it would not be}} raided while he was there; but other citizens <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> unjust when they were arrested for breaking the same laws.|$|E
5|$|Gary Steinman of Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine {{said that}} the lack of a plotline gave the player no {{incentive}} to keep playing through what he felt was a poor combat system. Both of those criticisms were repeated by Electronic Gaming Monthlys Sam Kennedy in his review. RPGamer's Bilyk felt that the smaller plots, while sometimes simplistic and not focused on the player, were enjoyable experiences. IGN's Smith concluded that while he enjoyed the game, he <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not a complete game like Secret of Mana, but instead a collection of fun experiences.|$|E
5|$|Historians are {{agreed that}} the {{introduction}} and conclusion were added by a different author {{than that of the}} Libellus. Who that was, however, is open to debate. The historian C. W. David <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{based on the work of}} the chronicler Symeon of Durham, which thus made a credible date for the creation sometime between 1109 and 1129. David also felt that the Vita was used by a later work of Symeon's, the Historia Regum. Offler, however, felt that although Symeon knew of the Libellus, there was no evidence that he used the Vita, which would leave the author of the Vita unclear.|$|E
50|$|At first, Wau Animation {{planned to}} make Ejen Ali as a feature-film project, {{but because of}} {{difficulties}} securing investment and after discussing with many parties and some feedbacks, they <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a loss if they only produce a single movie as the concept is so wide. They planned to develop this series at least until 5 seasons, then the films will follow.|$|R

5|$|In February 2009, Telltale Games {{renamed the}} game from its initial release title of Sam & Max: Season One to Sam & Max Save the World. Telltale's public {{relations}} spokeswoman, Emily Morganti, explained that while Season One was thought to communicate the game's episodic nature to potential consumers, the company <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> nondescript {{in relation to the}} game's story. The message accompanied the announcement of an Xbox Live Arcade version of the game, which had been subject to media speculation since February 2007. Both Windows and Wii versions of the game are to be republished using the new title.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} segment, Burns and Smithers {{go down to}} the lab during Homer's nightmare. The animators decided to make the {{animation}} a bit more impressive, and decided to do the concave and convex images of Burns and Smithers. Even though it was tough and took up more time, the producers <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a necessary tour-de-force. Originally, Homer's robotic voice was done post-animation in order to avoid stress on the voice actor. One of the writers who created the Davy Crockett joke thought it was so funny that he actually mimicked the actions of Mr. Burns putting on Homer's brain in the writing room; the producers thought that it was hilarious, so they decided to add it into the episode.|$|E
5|$|Lambert had a {{different}} visual aspect of the song on her mind. She <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> more about ecstasy, especially a sexual one, and how it related to religious ecstasy. She listened to the song with Madonna {{a number of times}} and together decided to include the ecstasy part. A sub-plot about Madonna as a homicide witness was included, which became the trigger for the sexual and religious ecstasy. Actor Leon Robinson was hired {{to play the role of}} a saint; the part was inspired by Martin de Porres, the patron saint of mixed-race people and all those seeking interracial harmony.|$|E
