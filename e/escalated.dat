Patients and methods: Economic evaluation of flexible-dose fesoterodine in newly diagnosed patients, including two treatment groups: standard <b>escalating</b> from 4 to 8 mg or fast <b>escalating</b> to 8 mg. Costs were estimated from health care resources utilization related to OAB, and were expressed in 2015 Euros. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) {{were obtained from}} overactive bladder questionnaire-short form. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were carried out. Results: Three hundred and ninety symptomatic OAB patients treated with fesoterodine and newly diagnosed (141 in fast <b>escalating</b> group and 249 in standard <b>escalating)</b> were analyzed. Adjusted health care total costs were not statistically different; difference −€ 4. 1 (confidence interval: − 153. 3; 25. 1) P= 0. 842. QALYs were higher in fast <b>escalating</b> to high dose vs standard <b>escalating</b> group, resulting in a cost of −€ 16, 020 /QALY gained for fast <b>escalating</b> vs standard <b>escalating</b> group. Conclusion: When the cost-effectiveness threshold is set at a maximum value of € 30, 000 /QALY gained, fesoterodine fast <b>escalating</b> group was cost-effective vs standard <b>escalating</b> group 67. 6 % of the time. The treatment with fesoterodine, in female patients newly diagnosed, fast <b>escalating</b> to 8 mg was a cost-effective option relative to <b>escalating</b> traditionally from 4 to 8  mg, {{in the management of}} OAB in routine clinical practice, from the Spanish National Health System perspective.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to better {{understand}} whether emotional aspects affect entrepreneurs’ and owner-managers’ decisions in investment situations when escalation of commitment can be observed and where the level of uncertainty was also added to the emotional aspect. The study was performed using conjoint analysis (a. k. a stated preference technique) and yielded following results: positive emotions (self-confidence, challenge, and hope) increase the decision-maker’s propensity to <b>escalate</b> commitment. Negative emotions (embarrassment and strain) do not, on the other hand, make the entrepreneur prone to <b>escalate.</b> The result remains the same for all positive emotions where an increasing level of uncertainty tends to make the entrepreneur more prone to <b>escalate.</b> Strain and embarrassment, under high uncertainty, decrease the tendency to <b>escalate.</b> All results are significant except for frustration that does not show any significant relationship. The combination of cognitive decision theories and emotional theories enhances our knowledge about the emotive side of entrepreneurs’ motives to <b>escalate.</b> The results also enable us to supplement and refine existing theories on self-justification.
