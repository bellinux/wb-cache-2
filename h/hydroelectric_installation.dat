5000|$|To South African Minister of Defence P.W. Botha it {{was evident}} that the MPLA had gained the upper hand; in a memo dated late June 1975 he {{observed}} that the MPLA could [...] "for all intends and purposes be considered the presumptive ultimate rulers of Angola...only drastic and unforeseeable developments could alter such an income." [...] Skirmishes at the Calueque hydroelectric dam, which supplied electricity to South West Africa, gave Botha the opportunity to escalate the SADF's involvement in Angola. On August 9, a thousand South African troops crossed into Angola and occupied Calueque. While their public objective was to protect the <b>hydroelectric</b> <b>installation</b> and the lives of the civilian engineers employed there, the SADF was also intent on searching out PLAN cadres and weakening FAPLA. A decisive turning point in the Angolan conflict was the South African decision on October 25 to commit 2,500 of its own troops to battle. Larger quantities of more sophisticated arms had been delivered to FAPLA by this point, such as T-34-85 tanks, wheeled armoured personnel carriers, towed rocket launchers, and field guns. While most of this hardware was antiquated, it proved extremely effective, given {{the fact that most of}} FAPLA's opponents consisted of disorganised, under-equipped militias. In early October, FAPLA launched a major combined arms offensive on UNITA's national headquarters at Nova Lisboa, which was only repelled with considerable difficulty and assistance from a small team of SADF advisers. It became evident to the SADF that neither UNITA or the FNLA possessed armies capable of taking and holding territory, as their fighting strength depended on militias which excelled only in guerrilla warfare. South Africa would need its own combat troops to not only defend its allies, but carry out a decisive counter-offensive against FAPLA. This proposal was approved by the South African government on the condition that only a small, covert task force would be permitted. SADF personnel participating in offensive operations were told to pose as mercenaries. They were stripped of any identifiable equipment, including their dog tags, and re-issued with nondescript uniforms and weapons impossible to trace.|$|E

40|$|For generations {{water has}} been used as a source of energy by {{industry}} and by a limited number of utility companies. In the continental United States, most rivers and streams capable of producing huge amounts of hydroelectric power have been harnessed; however, this does not preclude the possibility of using mini-hydroelectric power as a source of energy supply for home or farm. Harnessing a stream for hydroelectric power is a major undertaking. Careful planning is necessary if a successful and economical power plant is to result. State water laws and environmental concerns must be determined. Precise field data must be gathered to compare the amount of power that can be expected from a <b>hydroelectric</b> <b>installation</b> to the electrical requirements of the home or farm. Then detailed plans that consider both construction and maintenance can be drawn up. Perhaps the greatest mistake made when considering small hydroelectric installations is the overestimation of a proposed plant’s capability. This bulletin will help you start the planning of a small power plant on a given stream of water. One of the first steps in planning is to measure the power potential of the stream. The amount of power that can be obtained from a stream depends on:- the amount of water flow- the height which the water falls (head) - the efficiency of the plant to convert mechanical energy to electrical energy. State water laws and environmental concerns must be determined. Harnessing a stream for hydroelectric power is a major undertaking.

40|$|A common {{phenomenon}} in Francis turbines is draft tube surge. In these fixed-bladed machines, a strong runner outlet swirl can develop under off-design conditions. The {{action of the}} diffuser, {{and in particular the}} draft tube elbow, on the rotating flow field induces synchronous pressure and discharge fluctuations. These low frequency disturbances are of special interest, because they can easily propagate throughout the whole hydraulic system. The dynamic response of the system to the natural excitations can inhibit the normal usage of the powerplant. If the natural excitation occurs at frequencies close to an eigenfrequency of the hydraulic system, an important amplification of the hydraulic fluctuations can be expected. Passive measures, such as air admission or minor design modifications, are commonly taken as a last resort to try to reduce these phenomena. This work explores an active control approach to alleviate the problem. It is shown that the hydroacoustic fluctuations in a hydraulic installation can strongly be reduced by "injecting" the inverse signal of the turbine's natural excitation. While the main theme is the application of the active control approach to improve the operation stability of Francis turbines, the scope of this study is larger and addresses the following scientific topics: Modeling of an <b>hydroelectric</b> <b>installation</b> The dynamic behavior of an installation is studied based on an one-dimensional model. A compilation of the basic modeling tools was done. Using these tools, the dynamic model of a hydraulic installation and an external hydroacoustical source is presented. It is used to explain how the overall hydroacoustic fluctuations can be reduced using a hydraulic exciter mounted in the wall of a draft tube's cone. Improving the operation stability by active control The hydraulic fluctuations associated with off-design operating conditions of Francis turbines are often very periodic and characterized by the presence of a dominant frequency component. The aim is to cancel out this component for which the amplitudes are often excessive. An active control system, composed of a hydraulic exciter and its controller, has been developed for a Francis turbine. The exciter employs a pulsed flow injection in the draft tube to generate an antiexcitation at a given frequency, which is then synchronized with the turbine's natural excitation. A self-tuning extremum control algorithm optimizes the operating parameters of the exciter to minimize the overall fluctuations in the hydraulic installation. Laboratory tests show the efficiency of the active control system. The amplitude of the pressure and discharge fluctuations at the dominant frequency component are reduced to background noise levels. Multiple configurations of the exciter have been tested. A spectral analysis of the pressure fluctuations is presented, the system's energy balance has been performed and the control algorithm of the system is analysed. The energy balance is very encouraging: the exciter system needed only about 1  percent of the hydraulic power of the Francis turbine. Prediction of the operation stability of turbines based on model tests Laboratory tests on a scale model, homologous to the turbine, are an indispensable step {{in the development of a}} hydroelectric powerplant. Unlike the static characteristics, the dynamic behavior of a turbine installation is difficult to predict. An original identification method of the dynamic characteristics of a model turbine is proposed. The method is verified on a theoretical case study and experimentally tested. It constitutes the basis of the prediction of the operation stability of the powerplant based on model tests...|$|E
