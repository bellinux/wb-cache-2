40|$|International audienceSignificant {{progress}} has been made in high-quality hair rendering, but it remains difficult to choose parameter values that reproduce a given real hair appearance. In particular, for applications such as games where naive users want to create their own avatars, tuning complex parameters is not practical. Our approach analyses a single <b>flash</b> <b>photograph</b> and estimates model parameters that reproduce the visual likeness of the observed hair. The estimated parameters include color absorptions, three reflectance lobe parameters of a multiple-scattering rendering model, and a geometric noise parameter. We use a novel melanin-based model to capture the natural subspace of hair absorption parameters. At its core, the method assumes that images of hair with similar color distributions are also similar in appearance. This allows us to recast the issue as an image retrieval problem where the photo is matched with a dataset of rendered images; we thus also match the model parameters used to generate these images. An earth-mover's distance is used between luminance-weighted color distributions to gauge similarity. We conduct a perceptual experiment to evaluate this metric in the context of hair appearance and demonstrate the method on 64 photographs, showing that it can achieve a visual likeness for a large variety of input photos...|$|E

50|$|In <b>flash</b> <b>photographs,</b> {{odd-eyed}} cats typically show a red-eye {{effect in}} the blue eye, {{but not in the}} other eye. This is due to the combined effect of the (normal) presence of a tapetum lucidum in both eyes and the absence of melanin in the blue eye. The tapetum lucidum produces eyeshine in both eyes, but in the non-blue eye a layer of melanin over the tapetum lucidum selectively removes some colors of light.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a novel {{technique}} that enables capturing of detailed 3 D models from <b>flash</b> <b>photographs</b> integrating shading and silhouette cues. Our main contribution is an optimization framework which not only captures subtle surface details but also handles changes in topology. To incorporate normals estimated from shading, we employ a mesh-based deformable model using deformation gradient. This method is capable of manipulating precise geometry and, in fact, it outperforms previous methods {{in terms of both}} accuracy and efficiency. To adapt the topology of the mesh, we convert the mesh into an implicit surface representation and then back to a mesh representation. This simple procedure removes self-intersecting regions of the mesh and solves the topology problem effectively. In addition to the algorithm, we introduce a hand-held setup to achieve multi-view photometric stereo. The key idea is to acquire <b>flash</b> <b>photographs</b> {{from a wide range of}} positions in order to obtain a sufficient lighting variation even with a standard flash unit attached to the camera. Experimental results showed that our method can capture detailed shapes of various objects and cope with topology changes well. 1...|$|R

25|$|Cats, {{like dogs}} {{and many other}} animals, have a tapetum lucidum, which is a {{reflective}} layer behind the retina that sends light that passes through the retina back into the eye. While this improves {{the ability to see}} in darkness, it appears to reduce net visual acuity, thus detracting when light is abundant. In very bright light, the slit-like pupil closes very narrowly over the eye, reducing the amount of light on the sensitive retina, and improving depth of field. Big cats have pupils that contract to a round point. The tapetum and other mechanisms give the cat a minimum light detection threshold up to seven times lower than that of humans. Variation in color of cats' eyes in <b>flash</b> <b>photographs</b> is largely due to the reflection of the flash by the tapetum.|$|R

40|$|The {{structure}} of the wake behind a kestrel in medium-speed flight down a 36 m length of corridor was analysed qualitatively and quantitatively by stereophoto-grammetry of multiple <b>flash</b> <b>photographs</b> of the motion of small soap-covered helium bubbles.

The upstroke is therefore aerodynamically active and the circulation appears to remain constant along the wing whose geometry is altered {{during the course of the}} wing-stroke. It is argued that the flight kinematics, and so the wake structure, of the kestrel may be typical of flapping flight at medium speeds and a flight model based on this wake geometry is presented. Rough estimates of the rate of momentum generated in the wake balance the weight almost exactly and a direct estimate of the induced power requirement from the wake measurements is obtained. The significance of these results for the various alternative aerodynamic descriptions and energetic predictions of models of flapping animal flight is briefly assessed...|$|R

40|$|Falling {{water drops}} from a {{dripping}} faucet, illuminated from above, exhibit {{a row of}} bright strips of light, a few centimeters apart at a fixed distance below the faucet. <b>Flash</b> <b>photographs</b> of the drops {{show that they are}} oblate in shape when the flashes occur and the bright flashes of light originate {{from the edge of the}} drop that is on the opposite of the overhead light source. Here we show that that the spots result from the same internal reflection that gives rise to the rainbow in a cloud of spherical drops. The periodic flashes reflect the capillary oscillations of the liquid drop between alternating prolate and oblate shapes and the dramatic enhancement in the oblate phase result from a combination of several optical effects. Ray tracing analysis shows that the flashes occur when the rainbow angle, which is 42 deg in spherical drops, but sweeps over a wide range between 35 deg and 65 deg for typical ellipsoidal drops and the intensity of the caustic is strongly enhanced in the oblate phase. This phenomenon can be seen in all brightly lit water sprays with millimeter size drops and is responsible for their white color...|$|R

To test how far this ability extends into the periphery, we tested, ten human subjects in a 180 deg panoramic viewing theatre. 1400 highly varied photographs (37. 5 deg high by 25 deg wide) were flashed for 28 ms, and subjects were asked to release a button if the image included an animal. Image position varied randomly from trial to trial with nine possible positions covering the entire horizontal extent of the visual field. Performance was remarkably good and decreased linearly with eccentricity from 93. 3 for central presentations, to 60. 4 for images centred at 75 deg, a remarkable result given the very low ganglion cell densities so far in the periphery.

50|$|Cats {{and dogs}} {{with a blue}} eye color may display both eyeshine and red-eye effect. Both species have a tapetum lucidum, so their pupils may display eyeshine. In <b>flash</b> color <b>photographs,</b> however, {{individuals}} with blue eyes may also display a distinctive red eyeshine. Individuals with heterochromia may display red eyeshine in the blue eye and normal yellow/green/blue/white eyeshine in the other eye. These include odd-eyed cats and bi-eyed dogs. The red-eye effect is independent of the eyeshine: in some photographs of individuals with a tapetum lucidum and heterochromia, the eyeshine is dim, yet the pupil of the blue eye still appears red. This is most apparent when the individual is not looking into the camera because the tapetum lucidum is far less extensive than the retina.|$|R

As with most predators, their eyes face forward, affording depth perception at the expense of field of view. Field of view is largely dependent upon the placement of the eyes, but may also be related to the eye's construction. Instead of the fovea, which gives humans sharp central vision, cats have a central band known as the visual streak. Cats can see some colors, and can tell the difference between red, blue and yellow lights, as well as between red and green lights. Cats are able to distinguish between blues and violets better than between colors near the red end of the spectrum. A 2014 study found that, along with several other mammals, cats lenses transmit significant amounts of ultraviolet (UVA 315-400 nm) light, which suggests that they possess sensitivity to this part of the spectrum.|$|R

40|$|Subliminal Messaging in Multimodal Newspaper Editing The Case of the 2008 US Presidential Election on the Front Pages of the New York Times and the Washington Post Anna Bianco Abstract The {{front page}} of a {{newspaper}} generally contains what its editor considers {{to be the most}} important “news of the day”. The front page is known to be a multimodal setting for a whole series of headings, subtitles, articles, reports, news <b>flashes,</b> <b>photographs</b> and other images that are placed together in apparently random fashion. The readership knows little about this layout structure that goes much beyond a general awareness that the most important news is “carried” in a top/central position on the page with large-print headlines, whereas the less important topics are below to one side (and sometimes centrally) in a smaller type size. Specialists in news reading and writing, for their part, know that there is much more to a page and that the multimodal choice of similar topics and related structures also constitute what is known as “newsworthiness”. A few other studies have also looked at the “less important” items reported on the front page and have shown that even unrelated items are actually carriers of the same message or theme as the main items, though without the readers being consciously aware of what is going on. These “unrelated” news items or “implicit topics” are in fact non-casual subliminal messages chosen and designed by the editorial staff as an intrinsic part of the theme of the page as a whole. This paper therefore intends to explore how subliminal messaging was actually used by the New York Times and the Washington Post during last year’s US Presidential election campaign. The conclusions to be drawn about this sort of editorial manipulation and subjective reporting, especially during key ideological moments like political elections, will hopefully provide enhance our critical awareness and further debate...|$|R
