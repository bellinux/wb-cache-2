This {{was to be a}} radical {{departure}} from the <b>defense</b> <b>in</b> <b>depth</b> plans used in the invasions of Peleliu, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa. Instead, everything was staked on the beachhead; more than 3,000 kamikazes would be sent to attack the amphibious transports before troops and cargo were disembarked on the beach.|$|E
5|$|The {{town was}} well defended and fortified, as Navarro had {{prepared}} a <b>defense</b> <b>in</b> <b>depth</b> with several concentric rings of trenches, barricades and fortifications. However, {{unknown to the}} defenders, the insurrectionists had with them significant supplies of dynamite and foreign experts from other guerrilla wars, including Boer Gen. Ben Viljoen and the grandson of the famous Italian revolutionary Giuseppe Garibaldi II (news dispatches from the battle also mention {{the participation of the}} future star of many Hollywood Westerns, Tom Mix). In order to counteract the formidable defenses, the rebels developed an effective strategy that managed to circumvent Navarro's well-placed machine-gun nests and street barricades. Rather than attacking through the streets, the rebels used the dynamite to blow the walls of the adobe houses that were huddled up next to each other, which allowed them to proceed through the city house by house.|$|E
25|$|In 1953 Swiss {{policy was}} formalized to place greater {{emphasis}} on {{the defense of the}} borders and population centers, and to extend the concept of <b>defense</b> <b>in</b> <b>depth,</b> pioneered in the Redoubt, to the entire Swiss territory. This corresponded to an unspoken reliance on cooperation with NATO to secure the flanks of Swiss territory and to resupply Swiss forces, which already purchased equipment from members of NATO. The Redoubt, with its determinedly neutralist connotations, lost priority.|$|E
50|$|After reverses on {{the eastern}} front in 1942, there were calls in early 1943 for the {{construction}} of fortifications and <b>defenses</b> <b>in</b> <b>depth</b> along the Dnieper river. After the Battle of Kursk and the invasion of Italy, there was a need to both conserve forces in the east and shift to defensive operations. Adolf Hitler ordered the construction of the defensive lines in August 1943; with this, he accepted the abandonment of any further offensive strategy in the east.|$|R
50|$|The XYZ Line, or Matallana Line, was {{a system}} of fortifications built during the Spanish Civil War in order to defend {{the capital of the}} Second Spanish Republic in Valencia, Spain. Unlike the Maginot Line, or the Iron Belt ("Cinturón de Hierro") of Bilbao, which were {{expensive}} systems of fortifications and bunkers made of reinforced concrete, the XYZ Line was a simpler system of <b>defenses</b> <b>in</b> <b>depth</b> consisting of trenches and bunkers that took advantage {{of some of the most}} difficult terrain in Spain in the Iberian System ranges to the north and northeast of Valencia. The defenses were built to withstand bombardment by either heavy artillery or 1,000-pound aerial bombs.|$|R

It was some time before Rokossovsky could knock it into shape as a front-line formation, forcing him to remove many senior, ex-NKVD officers. From 28 February the 70th Army took part in both offensive and defensive operations to the northwest of Kursk. Central Front exploited a gap between the weak Second German Army and the Second Panzer Army, but was brought to a halt by the spring rasputitsa, German reserves released by their evacuation of the Rzhev Salient, and the German counter-offensive to the south. The Front's armies created <b>defenses</b> <b>in</b> <b>depth</b> during the lull in operations during the spring.|$|R
25|$|Operation Yoav {{was headed}} by the Southern Front {{commander}} Yigal Allon. Committed to Yoav were three infantry and one armoured brigades, who were given the task of breaking through the Egyptian lines. The Egyptian positions were badly weakened {{by the lack of}} a <b>defense</b> <b>in</b> <b>depth,</b> which meant that once the IDF had broken through the Egyptian lines, there was little to stop them. The operation was a huge success, shattering the Egyptian ranks and forcing the Egyptian Army from the northern Negev, Beersheba and Ashdod.|$|E
25|$|Swiss policy {{during the}} Cold War adopted a more {{aggressive}} defense of the borders, relying less on a retreat to the mountains. While Switzerland was again surrounded by an alliance, NATO was not considered a threat to Swiss national existence. The Swiss strategy sought to exact a high price from any direct ground attack on Swiss territory. Control of the Alpine crossings remained a cornerstone of the Swiss strategy of neutrality. The dense network of passive and active barriers and large and small fortifications allowed considerable flexibility in the disposition of Swiss forces, and represented an almost optimal scenario of <b>defense</b> <b>in</b> <b>depth.</b>|$|E
500|$|As the Empire's frontiers receded to the Rhine, Switzerland {{once again}} became a border area. Its {{defenses}} were strengthened, especially under Diocletian and Constantine, who rebuilt {{the roads and}} built castles (castra) alongside. Numerous fortifications were built along the Rhine border and further south, providing for a <b>defense</b> <b>in</b> <b>depth.</b> The border fortifications were completed by Valentinian I in 371, who established a chain of watchtowers along the Rhine from Lake Constance to Basel, with each tower no more than [...] away from the next one.|$|E

50|$|Pershing {{decided to}} strike his {{heaviest}} blow in a zone about 20 mi wide between the Heights of the Meuse {{on the east}} and {{the western edge of the}} high, rough, and densely wooded Argonne Forest. This is difficult terrain, broken by a central north-south ridge that dominates the valleys of the Meuse and Aire rivers. Three heavily fortified places - Montfaucon, Cunel, and Barricourt - as well as numerous strong points barred the way to penetration of the elaborate German <b>defenses</b> <b>in</b> <b>depth</b> that extended behind the entire front. This fortified system consisted of three main defense lines backed up by a fourth line less well-constructed. Pershing hoped to launch an attack with enough momentum to drive through these lines into the open area beyond, where his troops could then strike at the exposed German flanks and, in a coordinated drive with the French Fourth Army coming up on the left, could cut the Sedan-Mézières railroad.|$|R
500|$|MacArthur was {{promoted}} to brigadier general on 26 June. In late June, the 42nd Division was shifted to Châlons-en-Champagne to oppose the impending German Champagne-Marne Offensive. Général d'Armée Henri Gouraud of the French Fourth Army elected to meet the attack with a <b>defense</b> <b>in</b> <b>depth,</b> holding the front line area as thinly as possible and meeting the German attack on his second line of defense. His plan succeeded, and MacArthur was awarded a second Silver Star. The 42nd Division participated in the subsequent Allied counter-offensive, and MacArthur was awarded a third Silver Star on 29 July. Two days later, Menoher relieved Brigadier General Robert A.

500|$|The German {{defensive}} preparations and {{the lack}} of any <b>defense</b> <b>in</b> <b>depth</b> indicated that their plan was to stop the invasion at the beaches. Four lines of obstacles were constructed in the intertidal zone. The first, a non-contiguous line with a small gap in the middle of Dog White and a larger gap across the whole of Easy Red, was [...] out from the highwater line and consisted of 200 Belgian Gates with mines lashed to the uprights. [...] behind these was a continuous line of logs driven into the sand pointing seaward, every third one capped with an anti-tank mine. Another [...] shoreward of this line was a continuous line of 450 ramps sloping towards the shore, also with mines attached and designed to force flat-bottomed landing craft to ride up and either flip or detonate the mine. The final line of obstacles was a continuous line of hedgehogs [...] from the shoreline. The area between the shingle bank and the bluffs was both wired and mined, and mines were also scattered on the bluff slopes.|$|E
2500|$|However, the Border Line fortifications shared common faults, {{including}} less-than-thorough {{attention to}} details of armor and protection, and a forward-facing position {{that left the}} positions vulnerable to direct return fire. [...] By comparison with the Maginot Line, the positions were less well-protected and lacked the ability to fire laterally {{along the line of}} attack from a sheltered location.

5000|$|At {{the start}} of World War I {{strategy}} was dominated by the offensive thinking {{that had been in}} vogue since 1870, despite the more recent experiences of the Second Boer War (1899-1902) and Russo-Japanese War (1904-05), where the machine gun demonstrated its defensive capabilities. By the end of 1914, the Western Front was a stalemate and all ability to maneuver strategically was lost. The combatants resorted to a [...] "strategy of attrition". The German battle at Verdun, the British on the Somme and at Passchendaele were among the first wide-scale battles intended to wear down the enemy. Attrition was time-consuming so the duration of World War I battles often stretched to weeks and months. The problem with attrition was that the use of fortified <b>defenses</b> <b>in</b> <b>depth</b> generally required a ratio of ten attackers to one defender, or a level of artillery support which was simply not feasible until late 1917, for any reasonable chance of victory. The ability of the defender to move troops using interior lines prevented the possibility of fully exploiting any breakthrough with the level of technology then attainable.|$|R
5000|$|Operation Veritable was {{designed}} to bring the 21st Army Group {{to the west bank}} of the Rhine River, the last natural obstacle before entering Germany. Initially scheduled for December 1944, the operation was delayed until February by the German Ardennes Offensive. Plans were developed to breach three successive defensive lines: the outpost screen; a formidable section of the Siegfried Line running through the Hochwald Forest; and finally the Hochwald Layback covering the approach to the ultimate objective of Xanten. The first phase began on 8 February 1945, with the 2nd Division's advance following up one of the largest artillery barrages seen on the Western Front. The Germans had prepared significant <b>defenses</b> <b>in</b> <b>depth,</b> both within the outpost screen and the Siegfried Line itself, [...] and to add to the Canadians' difficulties, constant rain and cold weather obscured the battlefield. However, by the end of the first day, the 2nd Division had captured their objectives—the fortified towns of Wyler and Den Heuvel. On 11 February, the division moved southeast to assist XXX British Corps in their assault on Moyland Wood.|$|R
2500|$|While drawing {{inspiration}} from the <b>defense</b> <b>in</b> the Battle of Peleliu, Kuribayashi designed a defense that broke with Japanese military doctrine. Rather than establishing his defenses on the beach to face the landings directly, he created strong, mutually supporting <b>defenses</b> <b>in</b> <b>depth</b> using static and heavy weapons such as heavy machine guns and artillery. Takeichi Nishi's armored tanks were {{to be used as}} camouflaged artillery positions. Because the tunnel linking the mountain to the main forces was never completed, Kuribayashi organized the southern area of the island in and around Mount Suribachi as a semi-independent sector, with his main defensive zone built up in the north. The expected American naval and air bombardment further prompted the creation of an extensive system of tunnels that connected the prepared positions, so that a pillbox that had been cleared could be reoccupied. This network of bunkers and pillboxes favored the defense. For instance, The Nanpo Bunker (Southern Area Islands Naval Air HQ), which was located east of Airfield Number 2, had enough food, water and ammo for the Japanese [...] to hold out for three months. The bunker was 90 feet deep and had tunnels running in various directions. Approximately 500 55-gallon drums filled with water, kerosene, and fuel oil for generators were located inside the complex. Gasoline powered generators allowed for radios and lighting to be operated underground.|$|R

2500|$|The 1st Army Corps led {{the attack}} against the Colmar Pocket on January 20, 1945. [...] Fighting in {{woodlands}} and dense urban areas, the 1st Army Corps attack stalled after the first day, meeting a German <b>defense</b> <b>in</b> <b>depth</b> and attracting German 19.

[...] By {{the end of the}} month, however, other attacks by U.S. and French forces against the Colmar Pocket had forced the Germans to redistribute their troops, and an early February attack by the 1st Army Corps moved north through weak German resistance, reaching the bridge over the Rhine at Chalampé and making contact with the U.S. XXI Corps at Rouffach, south of Colmar. [...] The final German forces in the 1st Army Corps area retreated over the Rhine into Baden on February 9, 1945. [...] Thereafter, the thrust of the Allied offensive moved to the north, and the 1st Army Corps was assigned the defense of the Rhine River from the area south of Strasbourg to the Swiss frontier until mid-April 1945.|$|E
2500|$|Initially, the {{opposition}} in the 6th U.S. Army Group's sector was stiffer than that facing the 12th U.S. Army Group. The German forces there were simply in less disarray than those to the north. Nevertheless, the 7th Army broke out of its Rhine bridgehead, just south of Frankfurt, on 28 March, employing elements of three corps—the XV Corps to the north, the XXI Corps in the center, and the VI Corps to the south. The XV Corps′ 45th Infantry Division fought for six days before taking the city of Aschaffenburg, [...] east of the Rhine, on 3 April. To the south, elements of the VI Corps met unexpectedly fierce resistance at Heilbronn, [...] into the German rear. Despite a wide armored thrust to envelop the enemy defenses, it took nine days of intense fighting to bring Heilbronn fully under American control. Still, by 11 April 7th Army had penetrated the German <b>defenses</b> <b>in</b> <b>depth,</b> especially <b>in</b> the north, {{and was ready to}} begin its wheeling movement southeast and south.

This advance was met with stiff resistance from the LTTE. It took the two divisions almost a month to cover the 12-mile stretch. From this lateral line, the 53rd Division, consisting of Special Forces commanded by Brigadier Janaka Perera and deputy commander Colonel (later Major General) Gamini Hettiarachchi broke out and launched a narrow frontal attack that headed directly {{to the east of}} Jaffna town, capturing key crossroads along the way. The 53rd Division consisted of the 534 Independent Brigade (commanded by Colonel Percy Fernando), 531 Air Mobile Brigade (commanded by Colonel Hiran Halangoda), 533 Armored Brigade (commanded by Colonel Gamini Balsooriya) and 532 Infantry Brigade (commanded by Colonel Lucky Rajasinghe).

Mean depth of interpretation was compared between sessions that were identified beforehand as either high-alliance or low-alliance sessions using the Helping Alliance Questionnaire (HAq-II: Luborsky et al., 1996). Results indicated that defensive functioning was correlated to <b>defense</b> interpretation <b>depth</b> <b>in</b> low-alliance sessions. Moreover, mean depth of interpretation was also higher in low-alliance sessions, pointing to the possible "destabilizing" effects that these interpretations may have on both defensive functioning and the therapeutic alliance.
