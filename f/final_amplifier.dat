2500|$|The {{discovery}} in 1912 of the amplifying {{ability of the}} Audion vacuum tube, invented in 1906 by Lee De Forest, solved these problems. [...] The vacuum tube feedback oscillator, invented in 1912 by Edwin Armstrong and Alexander Meissner, was a cheap source of continuous waves and could be easily modulated to make an AM transmitter. [...] Modulation {{did not have to}} be done at the output but could be applied to the signal before the <b>final</b> <b>amplifier</b> tube, so the microphone or other audio source didn't have to handle high power. [...] Wartime research greatly advanced the art of AM modulation, and after the war the availability of cheap tubes sparked a great increase in the number of radio stations experimenting with AM transmission of news or music. [...] The vacuum tube was responsible for the rise of AM radio broadcasting around 1920, the first electronic mass entertainment medium. [...] Amplitude modulation was virtually the only type used for radio broadcasting until FM broadcasting began after World War 2.|$|E
2500|$|The Novice class {{created by}} the 1951 {{decision}} was the entry-level license; it remained the primary entry license until the Morse code requirement was eliminated for Technician licenses in 1990. [...] On HF it permitted code transmissions only, with a maximum power of 75 watts, (input to the transmitter's <b>final</b> <b>amplifier</b> stage) on limited segments of the 80, 40 and 15 meter bands, and on VHF, both code and voice privileges on 145–147MHz. [...] Initially, they were also limited to crystal control of the transmitting frequency, a restriction that was lifted in 1972. At the same time, the Novice CW bands were shifted on the 40m band {{and access to the}} 2m voice/code was revoked and a code segment on the 10m band was added. To qualify for a Novice license, a candidate would have to pass a 5 word-per-minute (WPM) Morse code test (send and receive) and a 25- (later 30-) question multiple-choice test. [...] The Novice Class license was valid for one year, as it was intended only as an entry level; within the year, the Novice was expected to move up to General (or Conditional). Under incentive licensing in the 60s, the term of the Novice class was extended to two years. In 1978 the Novice changed into a renewable license with the same five-year validity as other classes.|$|E

This computer used magnetic amplifiers, not transistors, because the transistors then available had highly variable characteristics and were not sufficiently reliable. The magnetic amplifiers were based on tiny magnetic cores with two wire windings.

The beam load is up to 150 kW for the RFQ and up to 750 kW for the two drift tube tanks. An additional 36 MHz debuncher in the transfer line to the Synchrotron (SIS) will need 120 kW pulse power. We decided to fulfil these demands with amplifiers of only two power classes, namely three amplifiers with 2 MW and six amplifiers with 200 kW pulse output power.
