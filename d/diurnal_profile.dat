50|$|Studies {{on people}} {{show that the}} HPA axis is {{activated}} in different ways during chronic stress {{depending on the type}} of stressor, the person's response to the stressor and other factors. Stressors that are uncontrollable, threaten physical integrity, or involve trauma tend to have a high, flat <b>diurnal</b> <b>profile</b> of cortisol release (with lower-than-normal levels of cortisol in the morning and higher-than-normal levels in the evening) resulting in a high overall level of daily cortisol release. On the other hand, controllable stressors tend to produce higher-than-normal morning cortisol. Stress hormone release tends to decline gradually after a stressor occurs. In post-traumatic stress disorder there appears to be lower-than-normal cortisol release, and it is thought that a blunted hormonal response to stress may predispose a person to develop PTSD.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Working {{on large}} scale {{construction}} sites {{have been shown}} to have severe health consequences in terms of increased risk of hospitalization and disability retirement compared to construction work in general. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate whether large scale construction work involving 12 -h workdays and extended workweeks leads to insufficient recovery measured as increased catabolic and decreased anabolic metabolism. METHODS: The study group comprised 40 male construction workers of which 21 had 12 -h workdays and extended workweeks (56 h/workweek). The comparison group consisted of 19 male construction workers, who worked regular hours (37 h/week, weekends off). Measurements of concentrations of cortisol in saliva and free testosterone and glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA(1 c)) in blood were made in a repeated measures design during 2 workweeks for both groups supplemented with 1 week off for construction workers with extended workweeks. RESULTS: The <b>diurnal</b> <b>profile</b> of concentrations of salivary cortisol for construction workers with extended workweeks differed from the <b>diurnal</b> <b>profile</b> of salivary cortisol for those with regular work schedules (P < 0. 001). The construction workers with extended workweeks tended to have 15 % [95 % CI - 3 %; 37 %] higher concentrations of free testosterone in serum compared to construction workers with regular work schedules (P = 0. 09). There were no differences between the two groups with respect to concentrations of HbA(1 c). There was no increasing trend in concentrations of cortisol or decreasing trend in concentrations of testosterone during the extended workweek. The <b>diurnal</b> <b>profile</b> for concentrations of cortisol differed between workdays and days off for construction workers with extended workweeks (P = 0. 003). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we observed no indications of insufficient recovery in terms of increased catabolic or decreased anabolic metabolism in construction workers with 12 -h workdays and extended workweeks compared to construction workers with regular work schedules...|$|E

40|$|A 12 -hour <b>diurnal</b> <b>profile</b> of salivary free {{cortisol}} {{was measured}} in healthy adults (n= 40) on two consecutive days. Samples were collected at timed intervals synchronised to awakening. The mean profile is characterised by a marked increase in cortisol concentration following awakening, peaking after about 30 min, and a subsequent decline over {{the remainder of the}} day. Thus two components of the diurnal cycle were examined: a) the first 45 min post-awakening (the awakening cortisol response) and b) the underlying 12 h profile from immediately until 12 h post awakening (but without the awakening response). Both of these components were analysed in two ways such as to provide an indication of overall cortisol concentration and the degree of change in cortisol concentration, i. e. the rise for the awakening response and the diurnal decline. Both components of the cortisol <b>diurnal</b> <b>profile</b> were negatively correlated with awakening time. Thus, those subjects who awoke earliest had higher levels of cortisol over the 45 min following awakening as well as {{throughout the rest of the}} day. They also displayed a more marked diurnal decline to be convergent with late awakeners at the end of diurnal measurement, 12 h following awakening. Hence the diurnal cortisol cycle, which is synchronised to awakening, is significantly related to awakening time. These findings support the notion of a close association between suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) control of both awakening and cortisol secretory activity...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Previous {{data from}} our group {{and others have}} shown that salivary {{alpha-amylase}} activity increases in response to stress. It {{has been suggested that}} salivary alpha-amylase may be a marker for adrenergic activity. Less is known about other determinants of salivary alpha-amylase activation. The objective of the current study was to describe the diurnal pattern of salivary amylase and its determinants. Methods: Saliva samples were collected immediately after waking-up, 30 and 60 min later, and each full hour between 0900 and 2000 h by 76 healthy volunteers (44 women, 32 men). Compliance was controlled by electronic monitors. In order to control factors which might influence the <b>diurnal</b> <b>profile</b> of salivary alpha-amylase (such as momentary stress, mood, food, or body activity), at each sampling time point the subjects filled out a diary examining the activities they had carried out during the previous hour. Results: Salivary alpha-amylase activity shows a distinct <b>diurnal</b> <b>profile</b> pattern with a pronounced decrease within 60 min after awakening and a steady increase of activity {{during the course of the}} day. Mixed models showed a relative independence of diurnal salivary alpha-amylase from momentary stress and other factors, but significant associations with chronic stress and mood. Conclusions: Our results suggest that diurnal profiles of salivary alpha-amylase are relatively robust against momentary influences and therefore may prove useful in the assessment of sympathetic nervous system activity.

40|$|A long-term, high time-resolution {{volatile}} organic compound (VOC) data set from a ground site that experiences urban, rural, and marine influences in the Northeastern United States is presented. A proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometer (PTR-MS) was used to quantify 15 VOCs: a marine tracer dimethyl sulfide (DMS), a biomass burning tracer acetonitrile, biogenic compounds (monoterpenes, isoprene), oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs: methyl vinyl ketone (MVK) plus methacrolein (MACR), methanol, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), acetaldehyde, and acetic acid), and aromatic compounds (benzene, toluene, C 8 and C 9 aromatics). Time series, overall and seasonal medians, with 10 th and 90 th percentiles, seasonal mean <b>diurnal</b> <b>profiles,</b> and inter-annual comparisons of mean summer and winter <b>diurnal</b> <b>profiles</b> are shown. Methanol and acetone exhibit the highest overall median mixing ratios 1. 44 and 1. 02 ppbv, respectively. Comparing the mean <b>diurnal</b> <b>profiles</b> of less well understood compounds (e. g., MEK) with better known compounds (e. g., isoprene, monoterpenes, and MVK + MACR) that undergo various controls on their atmospheric mixing ratios provides insight into possible sources of the lesser known compounds.

Methanol exhibits an initial early morning release in summer unlike any other OVOC (or isoprene) and a dramatic late afternoon mixing ratio increase in spring.

40|$|Introduction Several {{theories}} {{have emerged in}} recent years suggesting that neuroendocrinological alterations, mainly changes in cortisol, could be of importance {{with respect to the}} link between chronic stress and disease. This study investigated possible deviations in the <b>diurnal</b> cortisol <b>profiles</b> of patients with clinically diagnosed stress-related exhaustion (exhaustion disorder – ED) compared with healthy controls. Material and methods Salivary cortisol samples taken at home in the morning directly after waking up, 30 min later, and in the evening were compared between ED patients (N = 122; 25 % men) and healthy controls (N = 98; 44 % men). Follow-up measurements were performed after 6 months (79 patients) and 12 months (68 patients) of the treatment. Results There were no clear differences in <b>diurnal</b> salivary cortisol <b>profiles</b> between the patients and healthy controls. Moreover, salivary cortisol levels and <b>diurnal</b> <b>profiles</b> did not change significantly during the treatment in the patient group. There was some indication of a smaller cortisol awakening response in the male patients compared to the male controls, but the difference appeared to be mainly related to the antidepressant use. Conclusions <b>Diurnal</b> salivary cortisol <b>profiles,</b> at least as measured in this study, give a rather poor reflection of the prolonged stress exposure experienced by patients with ED. Such basal salivary cortisol measurements do not seem suitable as biomarkers for stress-related conditions such as ED or burnout, or as an aid to assess the effects of prolonged stress load in a routine clinical practice...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} if cynical hostility {{is associated with}} alterations in diurnal profiles of cortisol. Hostility {{has been linked to}} cardiovascular disease but the biological mechanisms mediating this association remain unknown. METHODS: Up to 18 measures of salivary cortisol taken over 3 days were obtained from each of 936 participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). Cynical hostility was measured using an eight-item subscale of the Cook-Medley Hostility Scale. Cortisol profiles were modeled using regression spline models that incorporated random parameters for subject-specific effects. Models were adjusted for race, sex, age, socioeconomic position, and lifestyle factors. The association of cynical hostility with key features of the cortisol <b>diurnal</b> <b>profile,</b> both in the full sample and important subsamples, was examined. RESULTS: Waking cortisol levels as well as the extent of the morning surge in cortisol levels did not differ significantly across tertiles of cynical hostility. Respondents in the lowest tertile of cynical hostility experienced a 22 % sharper decline in salivary cortisol (age- and sex-adjusted slope of - 0. 49 microg/dL per hour) than respondents in the highest tertile (- 0. 40 microg/dL per hour, p for difference =. 0004). Intertertile differences in these parameters remained unaltered after further adjustment for potential confounders. This pattern of differences in cortisol <b>diurnal</b> <b>profile</b> tended to be related in a dose-response way to level of cynical hostility, and persisted in stratified analyses. Conclusions: Cynical hostility is associated with the declining phase of the awakening cortisol response. The implications of this for cardiovascular and other health outcomes remain to be determined...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: This analytical, {{retrospective}} {{study was designed}} to select cut-off thresholds of mean GH levels during a <b>diurnal</b> <b>profile</b> and nadir GH levels after oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) according to age to diagnose surgical remission of acromegaly. METHODS: One hundred forty-one patients (76 women, aged 44 +/- 15 years and 65 men, aged 43 +/- 13 years) were included in this study. For the purpose of this study, remission was based on insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) levels in the normal range for age. Diagnostic accuracy was analysed by receiving-operator characteristics (ROC) curves in the entire series, and in young (20 - 40 years), middle-aged (41 - 60 years) and older patients (> 60 years), separately. RESULTS: Sixty patients (42. 6 %) had normal IGF-I levels after surgery. In the entire series, in young and in middle-aged patients, the ROC analysis showed that optimum cut-off for mean GH levels was 2. 3 microg/l (diagnostic accuracy range, 94 - 97 %) whereas that for nadir GH after OGTT were, respectively, 0. 85, 0. 9 and 0. 8 microg/l (diagnostic accuracy range, 90 - 95 %). In the older patients, the optimum cut-off selected for mean GH levels was 1. 4 microg/l and that for nadir GH after OGTT was 0. 5 microg/l (diagnostic accuracy, 100 % for both). The comparative analysis of the ROC curves did not show any significant difference between mean GH and nadir GH after OGTT (P = 0. 21). CONCLUSIONS: The criteria currently accepted for diagnosing post-surgical remission of acromegaly have high diagnostic accuracy only in the patients aged below 60 years. In older patients, lower cut-offs (i. e. = 1. 4 microg/l for fasting GH and = 0. 5 microg/l for nadir GH after OGTT) predict normal IGF-I levels. Mean GH levels during a <b>diurnal</b> <b>profile</b> have similar diagnostic accuracy of nadir GH levels after OGTT. This suggests that OGTT is not necessary to establish surgical cure...|$|E

Older participants had a significantly higher cortisol area under the curve (AUC), lower overall DHEA levels, lower DHEA AUC, a decreased diurnal slope of decline and increased cortisol:DHEA ratio. Lower diurnal cortisol levels were associated with poorer performance on the Berg Balance Scale and lower handgrip strength, and those with a flattened DHEA <b>diurnal</b> <b>profile</b> reported less independence in carrying out daily tasks. These associations withstood adjustment for age. In conclusion, this study suggests an association between cortisol, DHEA, ageing and physical function...|$|E

Recent evidence suggests that accounting for these differences, known as one’s chronotype, results in significantly different <b>diurnal</b> performance <b>profiles.</b> However, there is limited research investigating multiple measures of performance simultaneously over the course of a socially constrained day.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Elevated fasting and {{postprandial}} triglycerides (TG) {{are established}} {{risk factors for}} Coronary Heart Disease (CHD). Usually, fasting plasma TG are measured, although TG are mainly produced in a postprandial state. Our objective was to investigate <b>diurnal</b> TG <b>profiles</b> using serial capillary TG measurements, in normolipidemic healthy males. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-eight, non-obese, non-smoking males (range: 20 - 55 years, mean age: 32 +/- 12 years), measured diurnal capillary TG, at six fixed timepoints during the day on three different days and recorded their food intake. Insulin sensitivity was estimated by HOMA. <b>Diurnal</b> capillary TG <b>profiles</b> were calculated as integrated area under the mean capillary TG curve (TGc-AUC). RESULTS: All subjects had normal fasting plasma TG and cholesterol. The average TGc-AUC was 23. 6 +/- 6. 7 mmol h L- 1. Significant correlations with TGc-AUC were: fasting insulin (r = 0. 40, P < 0. 005), HOMA (r = 0. 32, P < 0. 05), relative fat mass (r = 0. 31, P < 0. 05), dietary protein-(r = 0. 31, P < 0. 05) and saturated fat intake (r = 0. 30, P < 0. 05). Age was not associated to diurnal triglyceridemia. After subdividing the group into quartiles {{on the base of}} TGc-AUC, {{differences were found between the}} highest (n = 12) and lowest quartile (n = 12) for: fasting capillary TG, fasting insulin, HOMA and systolic blood pressure. Fasting plasma TG and dietary intake were not different. CONCLUSION: <b>Diurnal</b> TG <b>profiles</b> in healthy normolipidemic males are not age-dependent, but are associated to insulin sensitivity, fat mass and diet. <b>Diurnal</b> capillary TG <b>profiles</b> may be a valuable additional tool in estimating a risk profile for CHD since significant differences in diurnal TG are not always reflected by elevated fasting plasma T...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to show that a {{photochemical}} box model could describe the air pollution <b>diurnal</b> <b>profiles</b> within a typical street canyon in the city of Athens. As sophisticated three-dimensional dispersion models are computationally expensive and they cannot serve to simulate pollution levels in the scale of an urban street canyon, a suitably modified three-layer photochemical box model was applied. A street canyon of Athens with heavy traffic was chosen to apply the aforementioned model. The model was used to calculate pollutant concentrations during two days with meteorological conditions favoring pollutant accumulation. Road traffic emissions were calculated based on existing traffic load measurements. Meteorological data, as well as various pollutant concentrations, in order to compare with the model results, were provided by available measurements. The calculated concentrations were found to be in good agreement with measured concentration levels and show that, when traffic load and traffic composition data are available, this model can be used to predict pollution episodes. It is noteworthy that high concentrations persisted, even after additional traffic restriction measures were taken on the second day because of the high pollution levels.
