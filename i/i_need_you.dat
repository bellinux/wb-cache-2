Its arrangement is built on piano chords and guitar melodies, and features Carey's pastor Clarence Keaton, who recites two Biblical verses during the song's introduction and bridge.

500|$|Before late 1958, {{rather than}} unified pop and country singles charts, Billboard {{had as many}} as four charts for each, {{separately}} ranking records according to sales, jukebox play, jockey spins (i.e., airplay), and, in the case of pop, a general [...] "Top 100". Billboard now regards the sales charts as definitive for the period. Widely cited chart statistician Joel Whitburn accords historical releases the highest ranking they achieved among the separate charts. Presley discographer Ernst Jorgensen refers only to the Top 100 chart for pop hits. All of the 1956–58 songs listed here as number one US pop hits reached the top of both the sales and with three exceptions, the Top 100 charts: [...] "I Want You, <b>I</b> <b>Need</b> <b>You,</b> I Love You" [...] (three), [...] "Hound Dog" [...] (two, behind its flip side, [...] "Don't Be Cruel"), and [...] "Hard Headed Woman" [...] (two).|$|E

It is composed in the key of A minor, with Gaga's vocal range spanning from the low-note of E3 to the high-note of C5. The song follows in the chord progression of Am–C–F–C–G in the verses and F–G–Am–C–F–G–E–Am in the chorus. The song opens with Gaga singing {{a portion of the}} chorus, then transitioning into the [...] "Rah-rah--ah-ah-ah, Roma-roma-ma, Gaga-ooh-la-la" [...] hook, which—according to an interview Gaga gave for the Carpool Karaoke segment of The Late Late Show with James Corden in 2016—is an abbreviation of the word [...] "romance". It is followed by the sound of drum beats and keyboards. After the first verse, the pre-chorus follows, with Gaga voicing the lines, [...] "You know that I want you, And you know that <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>you,</b> I want your bad, your bad romance". The full-throated chorus then follows, where she sings, [...] "I want your love, And I want your revenge, You and me could write a bad romance ... Caught in a bad romance".|$|E

He had previously performed on unofficial remixes of Rihanna's [...] "We Found Love" [...] and [...] "Where Have You Been". The official remix of [...] "Diamonds", which featured rapper Kanye West, {{was released on}} November 16 as a digital download via SoundCloud and iTunes. West's verse starts {{at the beginning of}} the remix, as he raps lines such as [...] "We the cause of all the commotion / Your mouth runnin' by where is you goin?". He also quotes the theme song from The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, while proclaiming to be [...] "on his Brad Pitt". MTV News' James Montgomery wrote that [...] "there's certainly no shortage of Kanye's patented swagger, and the new remix also adds some clubby wallop to the laid-back track." [...] Henna Kathiya of MTV Rapfix remarked that West adds [...] "some classic Ye flavor" [...] to the original song. On December 4, a new remix leaked online. It featured Eve, who rapped lines such as, [...] "You glisten so beautiful, priceless/ Listen to me, <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>you</b> to know/ How you can change my whole world." ...|$|E
500|$|Over ominous keys, a {{keyboard}} opening and a repeating drum loop {{in the first}} verse, Beyoncé sings about how her relationship turned sour and puts all her cards on the table, [...] "I told you how you hurt me, baby / But you don't care / Now I'm crying and deserted, baby / But you don't care / Ain't nobody tell me this is love / You're immune to all my pain / <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>you</b> to tell me this love / You don't care, well, that's OK". While singing {{the first and second}} verses, she pulls out the power in her lower register. Each time, her voice slowly builds until the commanding chorus is reached, where towards the end, she sings, [...] "la la la", in a muted saxophone line. Her voice expresses anger as she sings the chorus lines. In the second verse, Beyoncé continues the [...] "wild-eyed pleas", as stated by Guerra and sings the lines, [...] "Even since you knew your power / you made me cry / And now every time our love goes sour / you won't sympathize". Her raw vocals then punch through most powerfully at the second chorus leading up to the bridge. After the bridge, Beyoncé, this time, scats the chorus alongside a multi-octave guitar solo.|$|E
500|$|Rich Juzwiak {{noted that}} Beyoncé [...] "ecstatically and hyperactively" [...] changes keys four {{times during the}} entire song. As stated by Scott Shetler of PopCrush, she {{constantly}} sings praises of her love interest in the first verse where she also seemingly sends him subtle digs as he did not give her his full attention in the past, this being illustrated in lyrics such as, [...] "after fighting through my fears [...] finally you've put me first." [...] The chorus, complimented with sweet backing harmonies, then arrives, with Beyoncé chanting, [...] "Baby it's you, you're the one I love / You're the one I need / You're the only one I see / Come on baby it's you / You're the one that gives your all / You're the one I can always call / When <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>you</b> make everything stop / Finally you put my love on top." [...] The chorus carries the final two minutes of the song through four key changes, proceeding to D♭, then to D, E♭ and finally to [...] E. This was highlighted by Henderson who wrote that [...] "the spirit carries both her and the song into a Stevie Wonder-reminiscent climax of continually rising key changes." [...] In this way, the word [...] "baby" [...] is said about 24 times throughout the song. As soon as the synthesizers drop out, the song fades out almost instantaneously.|$|E

500|$|... "Carry Out" [...] is one {{of twelve}} songs written and {{produced}} by Timbaland and J-Roc for Timbaland's third studio album Shock Value II (2009). Justin Timberlake, Attitude and Jim Beanz, notable collaborators with Timbaland, also assisted {{in the writing of}} the song. Timbaland, in an interview with MTV's Shaheem Reed and Gil Kaufman, stated that he favored this song over other recordings because the process for creating the song was similar to those of other collaborations they have done. Timberlake would come into the studio and listen to the track. Afterwards, he would then compose the lyrics in his head. Upon explaining their method of making music, Timbaland stated that: [...] "We got a chemistry that cannot be described. People ask, 'Well, what are you and Justin like?' Can't tell you what it's like — it's a chemistry that can't be described. Something you would have to see for yourself and be, like, 'Them two got magic'." [...] Timbaland stated that the song resembles a [...] "2010 version" [...] of Snoop Dogg's [...] "Drop It Like It's Hot", produced by The Neptunes. He also revealed that the intention of the song was to provide a different slang for women: [...] "Instead of 'Your phat butt' or 'Your big breasts,' we say, 'Oh, <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>you.</b> Can I be your carry out? Be my carry out. I want you to be my dinner, my leftovers, my everything.' It's a different slang. We're grown men, I wanna be subliminal to females. Like, 'Oooh, carry out? That's kinda sexy'." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Clocks" [...] {{has been}} {{regarded}} as one of the finest achievements of Coldplay; the song's piano progression remains the band's signature creation. According to The New York Times, the opening piano arpeggios of [...] "Clocks" [...] have been widely sampled. Also, many of the songs in X feature influences from [...] "Clocks". Brian Cohen of Billboard magazine noted that [...] "Clocks" [...] served as a [...] "launching pad" [...] for songs featured in X, [...] "several of which echo that track either in structure or feel." [...] "Speed of Sound", the first single from Coldplay's third album, X, is similar to [...] "Clocks", in that the two songs have the same descending chord progression. According to The New York Times, American singer Jordin Sparks's 2008 single [...] "No Air" [...] "breathes life into the overfamiliar piano line" [...] from [...] "Clocks". The song [...] "Should I Go" [...] by American singer Brandy, from her album Afrodisiac, samples the piano riff of [...] "Clocks", as does Mexican singer Alejandro Fernández's 2007 single [...] "Te Voy A Perder". In 2009, French DJ David Guetta in collaboration with Kelly Rowland released the song [...] "When Love Takes Over", which has a piano introduction like that of [...] "Clocks". A riff similar to [...] "Clocks" [...] was also used for the 2009 song [...] "Shining Down" [...] by Chicagoan hip hop artist Lupe Fiasco and featuring Matthew Santos. An analogous riff can also be heard in the DJ Cahill Remix of the Agnes song <b>I</b> <b>Need</b> <b>You</b> Now. Rolling Stone ranked [...] "Clocks" [...] #490 of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time in 2010.|$|E
