60|$|With {{respect to}} birds {{in a state}} of nature, the first and most obvious {{supposition}} which will occur to everyone is that the female at the proper season accepts the first male whom she may encounter; but she has at least the opportunity for exerting a choice, as she is almost invariably pursued by many males. Audubon—and we must remember that he spent a long life in prowling about the forests of the United States and observing the birds—does not doubt that the female deliberately chooses her mate; thus, speaking of a woodpecker, he says the hen is followed by half-a-dozen gay suitors, who continue performing strange antics, “until a marked preference is shewn for one.” The female of the red-winged starling (Agelæus phœniceus) is likewise pursued by several males, “until, becoming fatigued, she alights, receives their addresses, and soon makes a choice.” He <b>describes</b> <b>also</b> how several male nightjars repeatedly plunge through the air with astonishing rapidity, suddenly turning, and thus making a singular noise; “but no sooner has the female made her choice, than the other males are driven away.” With one of the vultures (Cathartes aura) of the United States, parties of eight or ten or more males and females assemble on fallen logs, “exhibiting the strongest desire to please mutually,” and after many caresses, each male leads off his partner on the wing. Audubon likewise carefully observed the wild flocks of Canada geese (Anser Canadensis), and gives a graphic description of their love-antics; he says that the birds which had been previously mated “renewed their courtship as early as the month of January, while the others would be contending or coquetting for hours every day, until all seemed satisfied with the choice they had made, after which, although they remained together, any person could easily perceive that they were careful to keep in pairs. I have observed also that the older the birds, the shorter were the preliminaries of their courtship. The bachelors and old maids, whether in regret, or not caring to be disturbed by the bustle, quietly moved aside and lay down at some distance from the rest.”[166] Many similar statements with respect to other birds could be cited from this same observer.|$|E

5000|$|According to Karlyn Crowley, a {{contributing}} author for Rethinking Women's and Gender Studies, rarely are {{issues related to}} spirituality and religion seriously addressed, which she argues can lead to multiple consequences that impact the field. In her chapter titled Secularity, she observes that the resulting dynamic is one of [...] "bifurcation" [...] where secularity is privileged as being more progressive. Crowley claims, [...] "By not interrogating these categories of {{the good and the}} bad religions, the secular and the religious, and the racial, cultural, and colonialist impulses at work, WGS often succumbs to two main secular narratives: (1) spirituality/religion is seemingly absent or neglected while signifying certain normative assumptions; (2) spirituality/religion is placed into easy binarisms and dismissed" [...] (2012, 248). The dismissals and unexamined presuppositions that Crowley <b>describes</b> <b>also</b> reveals what she notes as leading to barriers. She suggests these barriers prevent one from at least engaging with ideas that could potentially inspire different ways of approaching issues connected to social change and to social justice.|$|E

The apparent plague of poverty that Dickens <b>describes</b> <b>also</b> conveyed to his middle-class readers {{how much of the}} London population was stricken with poverty and disease. Nonetheless, in Oliver Twist, he delivers a somewhat mixed message about social caste and social injustice. Oliver's illegitimate workhouse origins place him at the nadir of society; as an orphan without friends, he is routinely despised. His [...] "sturdy spirit" [...] keeps him alive despite the torment he must endure. Most of his associates, however, deserve their place among society's dregs and seem very much at home in the depths. Noah Claypole, a charity boy like Oliver, is idle, stupid, and cowardly; Sikes is a thug; Fagin lives by corrupting children, and the Artful Dodger seems born for a life of crime. Many of the middle-class people Oliver encounters—Mrs. Sowerberry, Mr. Bumble, and the savagely hypocritical [...] "gentlemen" [...] of the workhouse board, for example—are, if anything, worse.|$|E

Dirk Albert Hooijer studied the fauna from the cave and found Dama and Capra to have been predominant. Neolithic finds included a long, denticulated, lustrous blade.

5000|$|According to Duquesne, the Muisca used {{devised a}} Priest's Century by scaling up The Priest's Year by gueta (20 times 37 months; 740) which {{approximately}} equals 60 Gregorian years. The same scholar {{referred to a}} Common Century (siglo vulgar) comprising 20 times 20 months. Pedro Simón's differences on the accounts of the mythical arrival of Bochica to the Muisca territory brings clues {{about the nature of}} the Priest's Century. According Simón, the century (edad) corresponded to 70 (setenta) years, however, Izquierdo suggests that such a value is typo of 60 (sesenta) years, which is a value that better matches the entire calendar's description. Besides de centuries, the chronicles describe further periods of time: the Astronomical Revolution as called by Duquesne, corresponds to 5 Priest's Years or 185 sinodical months, comprising so a quarter of a Priest's Century. Simón <b>describes</b> <b>also</b> an additional time period named the Bxogonoa which corresponds to 5 Priest's Centuries.

5000|$|In the Greco-Roman world, {{the mystery}} {{religions}} were those that required initiation, as distinguished from public rites that {{were open to}} all; the Greek word for [...] "mystery", mysterion, comes from mystēs, [...] "initiate." [...] (The contemporary English meaning of [...] "something unknown or hard to know" [...] developed from the secrecy surrounding the arcane knowledge promised by these religions.) The most famous of the ancient mysteries, {{and the most important}} in Classical Greece, were the Eleusinian Mysteries. The mysteries known as Orphic, Dionysian or Bacchic pertained to the god Dionysus and his [...] "prophet" [...] Orpheus. In the Hellenistic period under Roman rule, the mysteries of Isis, Mithras, and Cybele were disseminated around the Mediterranean and as far north as Roman Britain. Apuleius, a 2nd-century Roman writer, described an initiation into the mysteries of Isis. The initiation was preceded by a normal bathing in the public baths and a ceremonial sprinkling by the priest, after which the candidate was given secret instructions in the temple of Isis.

In chapters 14 and 15 he returns to his favourite sculpture, enumerating several statues which would nowadays be completely unknown, among which Apollo of Salamis and the statue of Phryne, made by Praxiteles.
