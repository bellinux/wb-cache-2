40|$|Concentrations of {{different}} {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAH), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and polychlorinated phenols (PCPh) were measured at 7 sites in Baden-Wuerttemberg during 1987 - 1989. At {{the same time the}} <b>dust</b> <b>immission</b> has been followed. Even at the sampling site with the highest dusts load, determined values clearly fall below preventive <b>dust</b> <b>immission</b> limits. Concentration of PAH, PCB and PCPh are largely local and time dependent. However, the general concentration level is definitely lower than in North Rhine-Westphalia and the Lower Main region. The seasonal dependency of PCB concentration points to contaminated soils as an emission source. From the similar concentration pattern of pentachlorinated phenol at all sampling stations it is assumed that this component is released by evaporation from contaminated materials.
