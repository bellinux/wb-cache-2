2500|$|On May 28, Minogue's 45th birthday, she {{announced}} the buzz single [...] "Skirt", {{and it was}} made available on Beatport on June 24. Whilst the track attracted positive commentary from critics, mainly for Minogue's newly experimented sound of electronic dance music, she revealed {{that it would not}} feature on the then-upcoming studio album. In February 2014, Minogue confirmed Furler as the album's executive co-producer's. Minogue stated in an interview with American website Idolator that [...] "I got on with her so well... <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> would executive-produce. I was hoping she would say yes. I didn’t know if it was something she had done or was interested in, or if maybe she just preferred writing and doing her own music." [...] That same month, she commented to American Billboard magazine; [...] "I felt like I needed a new landscape, and once you've got your feet on the ground you're raring to go. [...] So far the support has been great, and it's just another part of this amalgamation of 'new' that I had wished for and was struck by." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{turned over}} some more photographs, and <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had always lived at Grimwinter.|$|E
60|$|As {{she was in}} such a {{communicative}} humour, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> {{had dreamed}} at all that night.|$|E
60|$|HIGGINS. You didn't. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her.</b> <b>If</b> you'd known <b>her</b> you wouldn't have <b>asked</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R

6000|$|I visited {{my former}} Love [...] As she lay by <b>her</b> husband's side; <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> life pleased <b>her,</b> now She was {{rid of a}} poet wrung in brow, [...] And crazed with the ills he eyed; ...|$|R
60|$|Then, after apologising {{for putting}} so many {{questions}} to her, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> could tell me her name.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs. Lynde {{was awful}} mad {{the other day}} because <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> was alive in Noah's time. I dident mean to hurt her feelings. I just wanted to know. Was she, Anne? ...|$|E
60|$|Then <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> {{liked to}} hear stories; this also puzzled her, and after some cross-questioning I {{discovered}} {{that she had never}} heard a story, and did not know what it meant.|$|E
6000|$|Airy, fairy Lilian, [...] Flitting, fairy Lilian, [...] When <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> she love me, [...] Claps {{her tiny}} hands above me, [...] Laughing all she can; [...] She'll {{not tell me}} if she love me, [...] Cruel little Lilian.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes," [...] said Mr. Spillikins. And he {{realized}} that he had actually drifted off the topic of Dulphemia, a thing that had never happened to him before. [...] "I was going to say that at one of the meetings, you know, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> might call her Dulphemia." ...|$|R
60|$|On Monday {{at breakfast}} <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> casually <b>if</b> she had yet found a Gretchen.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not yet, sir," [...] said Lister, quietly. [...] "I met Miss Hyslop soon {{before your}} boat arrived. Perhaps I ought {{to tell you}} <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> would marry me if we floated the wreck." ...|$|E
6000|$|And little Cynthia? Did she suspect? She {{looked very}} tired and ill, I thought. The {{heaviness}} and languor of her manner were very marked. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> were feeling ill, and she answered frankly: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "However, {{pretty soon}} they {{contrived}} to fasten up the curtain, {{and then they}} could see out a little over our shoulders. The girl sat directly behind me. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> could see, {{and she said she}} could, very well.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> {{that were}} not our destination? On her motioning Yes, with the same hasty gesture as before, I stopped an empty coach that was coming by, and we got into it. When <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> where the coachman was to drive, she answered, 'Anywhere near Golden Square! And quick!'--then shrunk into a corner, with one {{trembling}} hand before her face, and the other making the former gesture, {{as if she could}} not bear a voice.|$|R
5000|$|Judith Alexander, {{herself an}} amazing personality, {{took me to}} meet Nellie Mae in May, 1980. Nellie Mae was {{welcoming}} and kind person. I saw this scrap of wood that she had paintedto look like a fish. <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> can buy it. She said {{that she wanted to}} get her nephew a shirt and tie for his birthday. I offered her $30.00 and she accepted.(Sandy Seawright, former contributor Atlanta Art Papers, personal memory, January 24, 2017) ...|$|R
60|$|She {{had a way}} {{of passing}} her hands over and under one another as she spoke, that was not only tidy but propitiatory; so <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> might look at her little sitting-room? She willingly replied Yes, and we went into it together: she leaving the door open, with an eye as I {{understood}} to the social proprieties. The door opening at once into the room without any intervening entry, even scandal must have been silenced by the precaution.|$|R
60|$|However, a Wooster's word is his bond. Woosters may quail, {{but they}} do not edge out. Only the keenest ear could have {{detected}} the tremor in the voice as <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> would care to come out for half an hour.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{never spoke}} but once, and <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> {{felt a little}} more easy, {{and she told me}} to hold my stupid tongue. Oh, Miss B., I never thought to have seen this day!" [...] And the water-works again began to play.|$|E
6000|$|One day being discoursing {{with her}} upon the {{extremities}} they suffered, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> could describe {{by what she}} felt {{what it was to}} starve, and how it appeared? She told me she believed she could, and she told her tale very distinctly thus: ...|$|E
30|$|<b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> <b>her</b> parishioners {{had urged}} {{to come here}} to get the {{official}} recognition from the sect. She replied no, that she wasn’t sure if any of them even knew she had come. Eager not to leave me with the impression that the whole thing had been meaningless, however, she quickly added: “But I’m really glad I came, anyway. I feel I’ve gotten a new awareness from this, and I want to try my hardest when I go back to the temple now”.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sir, as {{we pushed}} off I felt somehow {{responsible}} like, and although I'd told the boys before that one reef would be enough, I made 'em put in another before I hoisted the sail. There warn't many boats out, {{for there was}} more sea on than most visitors care to face; but once fairly outside we went along through it splendid. When we got {{within a mile of}} Fley, <b>I</b> <b>asks</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> we should turn, or go on for a bit farther.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{know she}} shrinks from seeing any one, Adam. It {{is not only}} you--some fatal {{influence}} seems to have shut up her heart against her fellow-creatures. She has scarcely said anything more than 'No' either to me or the chaplain. Three or four days ago, before you were mentioned to <b>her,</b> when <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> there was any one of her family whom {{she would like to}} see--to whom she could open her mind--she said, with a violent shudder, 'Tell them not to come near me--I won't see any of them.'" ...|$|R
60|$|As I {{jumped from}} my machine and {{approached}} her {{she turned her}} head and looked at me. She was a pale girl, and her face was troubled. When <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had hurt herself, she spoke to me without the slightest embarrassment or hesitation.|$|E
60|$|On the {{outskirts}} of the crowd I met Susan, who was almost overpowered with joy at seeing me safe again. I shook her by the hand, but, without replying to her warm-hearted protestations of thankfulness and delight, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had seen Miss Havelot.|$|E
6000|$|The {{professor}} nodded significantly across Mrs. Makely to me, {{and then}} frowned {{and shook his}} head. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> knew what he meant. [...] "Why, didn't you know that spiritualism was that poor man's foible? He lost his son in a railroad accident, and ever since--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{confidence}} {{which my}} daughter has placed in me goes no further than this. She maintains an obstinate silence, when <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> she can explain {{the disappearance of the}} Diamond. She refuses, with tears, when I appeal to her to speak out for my sake. 'The day will come when you will know why I am careless about being suspected, and why I am silent even to you. I have done much to make my mother pity me--nothing to make my mother blush for me.' Those are my daughter's own words.|$|R
6000|$|... "Madam, her fortune {{has been}} the only thing I have had to regret about <b>her.</b> But <b>I</b> must <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> she will not think the {{sacrifice}} greater than I am worthy of." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It’s coming off, then," [...] said Mr. Tillotson, {{brightening}} visibly. [...] "If {{you will}} wait a minute—if {{the girl is}} in <b>I</b> will <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> she will go and get us something to drink." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{think that}} if one's a sentient being one can make the distinction. I'm a good deal like Henrietta. The other day when <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> wished to marry she said: 'Not till I've seen Europe!' I too don't wish to marry till I've seen Europe." ...|$|E
60|$|W.A.--Ay, ay, there {{began our}} dialogue. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> would {{be married to}} me our way. She asked me what way that was; I told her {{marriage}} was appointed by God; and here we had a strange talk together, indeed, as ever man and wife had, I believe.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> {{had read}} Moody's Ship of Souls, {{but she had}} not. I searched her out further. She liked Browning, and was {{especially}} fond of The Ring and the Book. This {{was the key to}} her. She cared only for healthful literature--for the literature that exposits the vital lies of life.|$|E
60|$|To this Mrs. Ambient {{had made}} answer {{that it would}} be very awkward when he was about fifteen; and <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> husband <b>if</b> it was his opinion in general, then, that young people should not read novels.|$|R
6000|$|... "By Jove!" [...] Spillikins said to Philippa Furlong next morning, in {{explaining}} what had happened, [...] "she was awfully nice about it. I think {{she must have}} guessed, in a way, don't you, what I was going to say? But at any rate she was awfully nice--let me say everything I wanted, and when I explained what a fool I was, she said she didn't think I was half such a fool as people thought me. But it's all right. It turns out that she isn't thinking of getting married. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> might always go on thinking of her, and she said I might." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing at all," [...] he answered, [...] "except {{to sit in}} {{a corner}} of the room, as far from me as possible, and answer the {{questions}} which <b>I</b> shall <b>ask</b> <b>her,</b> <b>if</b> she be able. You will do that?" [...] turning suddenly towards her.|$|R
