40|$|We {{analysed}} retrospectively {{the results}} obtained during 3 years {{in the treatment of}} thyrotoxicosis with 131 -iodine. A group of 32 patients, including 21 Graves' diseases, 10 multinodular toxic <b>goitres</b> and 1 toxic adenoma has been collected. The therapeutic efficacy of one dose of radioiodine, assessed after 6 months was 100 % in toxic multinodular <b>goitres</b> and 57 % in Graves' diseases. No acute complications were observed. The best radiosensitivity of toxic multinodular <b>goitres</b> compared with diffuse <b>goitres</b> is probably due to the mechanisms themselves of thyrotoxicosis in these diseases.

5|$|The {{presence}} and {{diseases of the}} thyroid have been noted and treated for thousands of years, although the gland itself has only been described and named since the renaissance. The first recorded mention of the thyroid {{is in terms of}} <b>goitre</b> in Chinese texts circa 2700 BCE, of which there is general agreement. In 1600 BCE burnt sponge and seaweed were used within China for the treatment of goitres, a practice which has developed {{in many parts of the}} world. In Ayurvedic medicine, the book Sushruta Samhita written about 1400 BCE describes hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism and <b>goitre.</b> Aristotle and Xenophon in the fifth century BCE describe cases of Grave's disease, which receives its name over two millennia later owing to descriptions provided by Robert James Graves in 1834, Hippocrates and Plato in the fourth century BCE provided some of the first descriptions of the gland itself, proposing its function as a salivary gland. Pliny the Elder in the first century BCE referred to epidemics of <b>goitre</b> in the Alps and proposed treatment with burnt seaweed, a practice also referred to by Galen in the second century, referred to burnt sponge for the treatment of <b>goitre.</b>|$|E
5|$|Disorders of {{the thyroid}} are functional–caused by {{dysfunction}} {{in the production}} of hormones, and nodes and tumors either benign or malignant. Functional disorders can cause inflammation as can some other forms of thyroiditis. Functional disorders can result in the overproduction or underproduction of hormones.

5|$|Excessive {{production}} of the thyroid hormones is called hyperthyroidism, which is most commonly a result of Graves' disease, a toxic multinodular <b>goitre,</b> a solitary thyroid adenoma, or inflammation. Other causes include drug-induced excess of iodine, particularly from amiodarone, an antiarrhythmic medication; an excess caused by the preferential uptake of iodine by the thyroid following iodinated contrast imaging; or from pituitary adenomas which may cause an over{{production of}} thyroid stimulating hormone. Hyperthyroidism often causes a variety of non-specific symptoms including weight loss, increased appetite, insomnia, decreased tolerance of heat, tremor, palpitations, anxiety and nervousness. In some cases it can cause chest pain, diarrhoea, hair loss and muscle weakness. Such symptoms may be managed temporarily with drugs such as beta blockers.|$|E

5|$|Ultrasound of {{the thyroid}} {{may be used}} to reveal whether {{structures}} are solid or filled with fluid, helping to differentiate between nodules and <b>goitres</b> and cysts. It may also help differentiate between malignant and benign lesions. A fine needle aspiration biopsy may be taken concurrently of thyroid tissue to determine the nature of a lesion. These biopsies are then sent for histopathology and cytology. When further imaging is required, a radiolabelled iodine-123 or technetium-99 uptake scan may take place. This can determine {{the size and shape of}} lesions, reveal whether nodules or <b>goitres</b> are metabolically active, and reveal and monitor sites of thyroid disease or cancer deposits outside the thyroid.|$|R
5|$|In {{areas where}} there is little iodine in the diet, {{typically}} remote inland areas and semi-arid equatorial climates where no marine foods are eaten, iodine deficiency gives rise to hypothyroidism, symptoms of which are extreme fatigue, <b>goitre,</b> mental slowing, depression, weight gain, and low basal body temperatures. Iodine deficiency {{is the leading cause}} of preventable intellectual disability, a result that occurs primarily when babies or small children are rendered hypothyroidic by a lack of the element. The addition of iodine to table salt has largely eliminated this problem in the wealthier nations, but iodine deficiency remains a serious public health problem today in the developing world. Iodine deficiency is also a problem in certain areas of Europe. Information processing, fine motor skills, and visual problem solving are improved by iodine repletion in moderately iodine-deficient children.|$|E

40|$|Measurement of prevertebral {{soft tissue}} is {{commonly}} used to assess prevertebral abnormalities, such as retropharyngeal abscess or injury to the cervical spine. In the presence of <b>goitres,</b> the widened prevertebral tissue seen on plain lateral neck radiograph may be diagnostic of an enlarged tubercle of Zuckerkandl (ZT), which {{may be responsible for}} most pressure symptoms. The aim {{of this study was to}} substantiate the value of plain lateral neck radiographs in preoperative demonstration of enlarged ZT. Methods: Fifty patients who underwent thyroid surgery between June and December 2000 were included in this prospective, non-randomized study. Measurements of prevertebral soft tissue were taken at C 4, C 5 and C 6, and were correlated with the weight of <b>goitres</b> and the grades of changes in the ZTs. Results: Of patients, 44 % had large <b>goitres</b> weighing more than 100 g; 52 % of ZTs were classified as grade 3. Of the large ZTs, 82 % were associated with large <b>goitres</b> and, of these, 88 % were associated with significant pressure symptoms. Prevertebral measurements were abnormal, particularly at C 4, C 5 and C 6. The most promising predictor of the presence of an enlarged ZT is the measurement taken at C 4 (p < 0. 05). The ratio of the prevertebral space to the vertebral body (PVS/VB) in grade 3 ZT was also increased at C 4, C 5 and C 6. However, these ratios were not statistically significant. A measurement of prevertebral soft tissue, particularly at C 4, greater than 16. 5 mm correlates 100 % with an enlarged grade 3 ZT. Conclusions: The results of this study support the concept that the plain radiograph shows significant widening of the lateral neck in the presence of an enlarged ZT. Plain lateral radiography is a simple procedure that could provide valuable information for preoperative assessment of an enlarged ZT, particularly in patients with large <b>goitres</b> who have significant pressure symptoms...|$|R

5|$|Some {{table salt}} sold for {{consumption}} contain additives which address {{a variety of}} health concerns, especially in the developing world. The identities and amounts of additives vary widely from country to country. Iodine is an important micronutrient for humans, and a deficiency of the element can cause lowered production of thyroxine (hypothyroidism) and enlargement of the thyroid gland (endemic <b>goitre)</b> in adults or cretinism in children. Iodized salt {{has been used to}} correct these conditions since 1924 and consists of table salt mixed with a minute amount of potassium iodide, sodium iodide or sodium iodate. A small amount of dextrose may also be added to stabilize the iodine. Iodine deficiency affects about two billion people around the world and is the leading preventable cause of mental retardation. Iodized table salt has significantly reduced disorders of iodine deficiency in countries where it is used.|$|E
5|$|Graves' {{disease is}} an {{autoimmune}} disorder {{that is the}} most common cause of hyperthyroidism. In Graves' disease, for an unknown reason autoantibodies develop against the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor. These antibodies activate the receptor, leading to development of a <b>goitre</b> and symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as heat intolerance, weight loss, diarrhoea and palpitations. Occasionally such antibodies block but do not activate the receptor, leading to symptoms associated with hypothyroidism. In addition, gradual protrusion of the eyes may occur, called Graves' ophthalmopathy, as may swelling of the front of the shins. Graves' disease can be diagnosed by the presence of pathomnomonic features such as involvement of the eyes and shins, or isolation of autoantibodies, or by results of a radiolabelled uptake scan. Graves' disease is treated with anti-thyroid drugs such as propylthiouracil, which decrease the production of thyroid hormones, but hold a high rate of relapse. If there is no involvement of the eyes, then use of radioactive isotopes to ablate the gland may be considered. Surgical removal of the gland with subsequent thyroid hormone replacement may be considered, however this will not control symptoms associated with the eye or skin.|$|E
5|$|Iodine is an {{essential}} element for life and is the heaviest element commonly needed by living organisms. (Lanthanum and the other lanthanides, as well as tungsten, are used by a few microorganisms.) It {{is required for the}} synthesis of the growth-regulating thyroid hormones thyroxine and triiodothyronine (T4 and T3 respectively, named after their number of iodine atoms). A deficiency of iodine leads to decreased production of T3 and T4 and a concomitant enlargement of the thyroid tissue in an attempt to obtain more iodine, causing the disease known as simple <b>goitre.</b> The major form of thyroid hormone in the blood is thyroxine (T4), which has a longer half-life than T3. In humans, the ratio of T4 to T3 released into the blood is between 14:1 and 20:1. T4 is converted to the active T3 (three to four times more potent than T4) within cells by deiodinases (5'-iodinase). These are further processed by decarboxylation and deiodination to produce iodothyronamine (T1a) and thyronamine (T0a'). All three isoforms of the deiodinases are selenium-containing enzymes; thus dietary selenium is essential for T3 production.|$|E

40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONAlthough most {{retrosternal}} <b>goitres</b> can {{be removed}} through a standard collar incision, some cases require extra-cervical incisions for complete resection. We report a new technique to remove large retrosternal <b>goitres</b> without extra-cervical incisions. PRESENTATION OF CASEWe present two cases in which a US Army-Navy (Parker-Langenback) retractor was used to deliver large retrosternal components into the cervical incisions. DISCUSSIONThis technique is useful {{in cases where the}} retrosternal component extends {{beyond the reach of the}} exploring finger and a well-developed plane can be developed between the gland and surrounding tissue. CONCLUSIONThe cervical leverage technique allows removal of a large retrosternal component through a cervical incision, thereby avoiding the attendant morbidity of a thoracotomy or median sternotomy. It should not be used if there is suspected neoplastic disease, dense adherence to or invasion of surrounding intra-thoracic structures...|$|R
5|$|The thyroid {{itself is}} {{examined}} by {{observation of the}} gland and surrounding neck for swelling or enlargement. It is then felt, usually from behind, and a person is often asked to swallow to better feel the gland against the fingers of the examiner. The gland moves {{up and down with}} swallowing because of its attachments to the thyroid and cricoid cartilages. In a healthy person the gland is not visible yet is palpable as a soft mass. Examination of the thyroid gland includes the search for abnormal masses and the assessment of overall thyroid size. The character of the thyroid, swellings, nodules, and their consistency may all be able to be felt. If a <b>goitre</b> is present, an examiner may also feel down the neck consider tapping {{the upper part of the}} chest to check for extension. Further tests may include raising the arms (Pemberton's sign), listening to the gland with a stethoscope for bruits, testing of reflexes, and palpation of the lymph nodes in the head and neck. A medical examination of the thyroid will also include observation of the person as a whole, to look for systemic signs such as weight gain or loss, hair loss, and signs in other locations – such as protrusion of the eyes or swelling of the calves in Grave's disease.|$|E

Seven patients were asymptomatic and CT failed to reveal any evidence of tracheal compression in six. In the remaining patient, however, CT revealed gross narrowing and urgent surgery was performed. When compared with CT, chest/thoracic inlet radiographs were misleading in 48 % of patients, with tracheal narrowing being overestimated and underestimated.
