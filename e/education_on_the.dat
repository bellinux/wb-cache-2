5|$|Following President John F. Kennedy's September 1962 speech, {{in which}} he {{described}} his goal of accomplishing a manned space flight to the moon {{by the end of}} the decade, the space program grew in importance and scope in Central Florida because of its proximity to Cape Canaveral. Prominent residents and local leaders began lobbying the Florida State Legislature to increase access to higher <b>education</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Space Coast. With the help of former State Senate President William A. Shands and Senator Beth Johnson, the legislature passed and Governor Farris Bryant signed into law Senate Bill No. 125 on June 10, 1963, which authorized the Florida Board of Regents to create a new state university in East Central Florida. The university was founded as a non-segregated and coeducational university, with the mission of educating students for promising space-age careers in engineering and other technological professions.|$|E
5|$|Tucker {{was educated}} in Bermuda {{primarily}} by a tutor engaged from Great Britain {{and also by}} Josiah Meigs. His assigned reading included Tom Jones, The Vicar of Wakefield, and Arabian Nights, among the mainstays of an <b>education</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> American continent. At age fifteen he helped form a literary club, the Calliopean Society; Meigs later became a professor and reprised {{the name of the}} club at Yale. Tucker at age 16 began to read the law under a successful and prosperous lawyer, George Bascomb. At Bascomb's death, the firm's clients urged Tucker to assume their representation, but feeling quite unqualified, he declined, deciding to begin plans for a career in the United States.|$|E
5|$|With no {{counterpart}} to the south, the Kansas Turnpike ended {{at the state}} line, at an at-grade intersection with E0010 Road. Just across the state line was an oat field, into which many inattentive motorists crashed. This abrupt end became nationally famous after Wyoming governor Milward L. Simpson and his wife crashed in mid-1957. The oat farmer plowed the field to provide a safer landing, and the KTA was persuaded to install a huge wooden barrier {{at the end of}} the highway. However, within a day, three more drivers had crashed and destroyed the barrier, so the KTA closed the turnpike south of the South Haven interchange. KTA provided the state of Oklahoma with financial aid to construct its portion of a temporary road leading to the interchange. The lack of continuity in the highway was one of the primary reasons that the road did not generate much revenue in the years following the opening; another reason was a lack of <b>education</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> part of motorists as to the concept of a toll road.|$|E
