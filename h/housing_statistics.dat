50|$|The two first male censuses was {{conducted}} during the 1660s and 1701. Later statistical censuses were held in 1769, 1815, 1835, 1845, and 1855. Norway's first nominative, complete census was taken in 1801, when Norway still was ruled by the Oldenburg dynasty of Denmark-Norway. The scope of the census followed the de jure principle, so military persons should be included as well as foreigners if they were residents. The 1801, 1865, 1900 and 1910 censuses are transcribed and made searchable on the internet. The census records are made publicly available when 100 years have passed. Since 1900, a census has been conducted every ten years. (However, the 1940 census was postponed to 1946, and the census after 1990 came in 2001.) Since 2001 the population census has been combined with the <b>housing</b> <b>statistics.</b> The 2001 questionnaire only asked about households and who was living in them, while no questionnaires will be mailed out for the 2011 census, since the administrative data on households is sufficient.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, the {{analysis}} of real estate markets has been intensified. Indeed, the demand for high quality statistics on national, euro area and EU real estate market supply and demand conditions has increased, in particular for changes in residential and commercial property prices over time. The considerable progress achieved in this area, both from the methodological and practical compilation point of view, addressed the basic requirements of availability of, residential property price indices. Similarly, work is in progress {{to set up the}} reference framework for the production of commercial property price indicators. Whilst real estate price statistics are relevant in their own, their usefulness is amplified when considering them in relation to other macroeconomic indicators such as national accounts (in particular sector accounts and financial accounts) and consumer price statistics. In addition, information on <b>housing</b> <b>statistics</b> in a broader sense encompasses other statistical sources than price statistics (national accounts, housing censuses, etc.).

40|$|All {{countries}} in transition experienced increases in inequality. They have also undertaken massive privatization of key asset housing, often on give-away terms. Are these two phenomena related? Has {{transfer of ownership}} rights to residents slowed down the inequality increases or it pushed it up? Surprisingly little is known in this area. This paper attempts to provide empirical evidence to start answering these questions. It shows how housing privatization affected the distribution of personal wealth and inequality in current consumption based on recent representative household surveys from three transition countries: Poland, Russia and Serbia. Survey data are compared with figures derived from national accounts and <b>housing</b> <b>statistics.</b> Contrary to common belief and some earlier evidence of strong equalizing effect of housing distribution in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, the paper finds that the contribution of housing to the overall inequality levels is not strong, and is not universally progressive.

40|$|Abstract The methods {{regarding}} {{housing policy}} have significantly changed over time. The market {{has gone from}} a welfare orientated approach, characterized by state subsidies and dominance in public housing companies to a more market orientated advance signified by increased competition and business driven housing policies. The {{aim of this study}} is to examine how this policy shift and the increased confidence in the markets capacity to solve issues in the housing sector have effected municipal conditions and methods for supplying housing. The analysis is delimited towards the two municipalities Umeå and Storuman in Sweden too examine how the change in housing policies have affected regions with different local conditions. The study has primarily made use of qualitative data gathering through semi structural interviews with officials and politicians but also includes <b>housing</b> <b>statistics</b> for each municipality. The results show that the influence of capital and the private sector have become increasingly more prominent since the policy shift and as a result local conditions and shortcomings on the market have a bigger impact on the effectiveness of different housing methods. Storumans housing market is characterized by weak market values and investment difficulties while Umeås primary problem consist of resource shortage in the planning sector as well as outdrawn political processes and conflicts of interest...|$|E
40|$|Belgium is {{a federal}} state with three regions. Since 1980, housing policy has come within the remit of the regions. Flanders is {{the largest of the}} three Belgian regions and one of the wealthiest regions of Europe. From earlier {{research}} we know that average housing quality and affordability in Flanders are good but that for a significant fraction of the population the constitutional right to decent and affordable housing is not realised. In this paper we add an international perspective to this research. We use EU-SILC data and available <b>housing</b> <b>statistics</b> to compare housing quality and affordability in Flanders with the other two Belgian regions and other European countries. We also investigate differences between socio-economic groups in each region. The paper concludes by setting out a number of hypotheses that seek to explain the observed discrepancies. A significant factor is that owner-occupied housing has long been a pillar of the welfare state in Belgium. A large number of households, however, that do not have the opportunity or do not wish to invest in owner-occupied housing, are left out in the cold. Individuals on low incomes who are at risk of poverty and households with only one adult have particular problems with housing quality and affordability. status: publishe...|$|E
