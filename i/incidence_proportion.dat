40|$|Background: Risk {{minimization}} measures (RMM) {{were implemented}} from February 2011 in the European Union to address risks of superinfection, off-label use {{and lack of}} efficacy associated with tigecycline. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate RMM effectiveness by describing prescription patterns among adults and children treated with any dose of tigecycline for any indication pre- and post-RMM implementation; <b>incidence</b> <b>proportions</b> of superinfection and lack of efficacy among adults treated with approved doses of tigecycline for complicated intra-abdominal infection and complicated skin and soft tissue infection were also evaluated. Methods: This was an observational, retrospective chart-abstraction study, including charts from 777 patients (399 pre-RMM, 378 post-RMM) at 13 sites across Austria, Germany, Italy, Greece and the United Kingdom (UK). Potential superinfection and lack of efficacy cases among those using tigecycline for on-label indication, age, dose, and duration were adjudicated. The distribution of indications for tigecycline was analyzed overall (i. e. across both study periods) and stratified by study period. Numbers and <b>incidence</b> <b>proportions</b> of superinfection and lack of efficacy cases (potential and adjudicated) were calculated overall and by study period. Results: Off-label use (indication or age) decreased from 54. 2 % [95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) : 49. 0, 59. 3 %] pre-RMM to 35. 7 % (95 % CI 30. 4, 41. 2 %) post-RMM. Overall, 45. 7 % (95 % CI 41. 9, 49. 5 %) of patients were prescribed tigecycline off-label; the most commonly reported off-label indications were characterized as “other” (25. 5 %), hospital acquired pneumonia (8. 2 %), other pneumonia (6. 3 %), bacteremia (5. 2 %) and diabetic foot infection (1. 5 %). Across study periods, <b>incidence</b> <b>proportions</b> of definite or probable superinfection and lack of efficacy in adults treated for approved indications, authorized treatment doses and duration were 4. 5 % (95 % CI 2. 1, 8. 4 %) and 5. 5 % (95 % CI 2. 8, 9. 7 %), respectively. Conclusions: Off-label use of tigecycline decreased following RMM implementation. Overall <b>incidence</b> <b>proportions</b> of definite or probable superinfection and lack of efficacy were low.

40|$|Background: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is {{a serious}} {{complication}} of critical illness with both attributed morbidity and mortality at short-term and long-term. The incidence of AKI reported in critically ill patients varies substantially with the population evaluated and the definitions used. We aimed to assess which of the AKI definitions (RIFLE, AKIN or KDIGO) with or without urine output criteria recognizes AKI most frequently and quickest. Additionally, we conducted a review on the comparison of <b>incidence</b> <b>proportions</b> of varying AKI definitions in populations of critically ill patients. Methods: We included all patients with index admissions to our intensive care unit (ICU) from January 1 (st), 2014 until June 11 th, 2014 to determine the incidence and onset of AKI by RIFLE, AKIN and KDIGO during the first 7 days of ICU admission. We conducted a sensitive search using PubMed evaluating the comparison of RIFLE, AKIN and KDIGO in critically ill patients Results: AKI <b>incidence</b> <b>proportions</b> were 15, 21 and 20 % respectively using serum creatinine criteria of RIFLE, AKIN and KDIGO. Adding urine output criteria increased AKI <b>incidence</b> <b>proportions</b> to 35, 38 and 38 % using RIFLE, AKIN and KDIGO definitions. Urine output criteria detected AKI in patients without AKI at ICU admission in a median of 13 h (IQR 7 - 22 h; using RIFLE definition) after admission compared to a median of 24 h using serum creatinine criteria (IQR 24 - 48 h). In the literature a large heterogeneity exists in patients included, AKI definition used, reference or baseline serum creatinine used, and whether urine output in the staging of AKI is used. Conclusion: AKIN and KDIGO criteria detect more patients with AKI compared to RIFLE criteria. Addition of urine output criteria detect patients with AKI 11 h earlier than serum creatinine criteria and may double AKI incidences in critically ill patients. This could explain the large heterogeneity observed in literature...|$|R
50|$|Cumulative {{incidence}} {{is defined}} as the probability that a particular event, such as occurrence of a particular disease, has occurred before a given time. It is equivalent to the incidence, calculated using a period of time during which all of the individuals in the population are considered to be at risk for the outcome. It is sometimes also referred to as the <b>incidence</b> <b>proportion.</b>|$|E
50|$|Performance {{indicators}} are typically quantified, with measurable descriptors like ratio, <b>incidence,</b> <b>proportion,</b> or percentage, to demonstrate progress. When establishing progress between reporting periods, an indicator may also express measurement by using {{words such as}} the change in, or the difference to describe values for particular reporting periods. By contrast, an outcome might measure the 'number of cases correctly resolved during the time period or the percentage by which the number increased this reporting period {{as compared to the}} previous period.' Thus, if a transportation system outcome indicator measures the percentage of roads in good condition, the transportation system outcome would be that roads be in acceptable and durable condition.|$|E
50|$|The {{incidence}} rate {{is the number}} of new cases per population at risk in a given time period. When the denominator is the sum of the person-time of the at risk population, it is also known as the incidence density rate or person-time {{incidence rate}}. In the same example as above, the incidence rate is 14 cases per 1000 person-years, because the <b>incidence</b> <b>proportion</b> (28 per 1,000) is divided by the number of years (two). Using person-time rather than just time handles situations where the amount of observation time differs between people, or when the population at risk varies with time. Use of this measure implies the assumption that the incidence rate is constant over different periods of time, such that for an incidence rate of 14 per 1000 persons-years, 14 cases would be expected for 1000 persons observed for 1 year or 50 persons observed for 20 years.|$|E

40|$|To {{complement}} traditional influenza surveillance {{with data}} on disease occurrence {{not only among}} care-seeking individuals, the Swedish Institute for Communicable Disease Control (SMI) has tested an Internet-based monitoring system (IMS) with self-recruited volunteers submitting weekly on-line reports about their health in the preceding week, upon weekly reminders. We evaluated IMS acceptability and to which extent participants represented the Swedish population. We also studied the agreement of data on influenza-like illness (ILI) occurrence from IMS with data from a previously evaluated population-based system (PBS) with an actively recruited random sample of the population who spontaneously report disease onsets in real-time via telephone/Internet, and with traditional general practitioner based sentinel and virological influenza surveillance, in the 2011 - 2012 and 2012 - 2013 influenza seasons. We assessed acceptability by calculating the participation proportion in an invited IMS-sample and the weekly reporting proportion of enrolled self-recruited IMS participants. We compared distributions of socio-demographic indicators of self-recruited IMS participants to the general Swedish population using chi-square tests. Finally, we assessed the agreement of weekly <b>incidence</b> <b>proportions</b> (%) of ILI in IMS and PBS with cross-correlation analyses. Among 2, 511 invited persons, 166 (6. 6 %) {{agreed to participate in}} the IMS. In each season, 2, 552 and 2, 486 self-recruited persons participated in the IMS respectively. The weekly reporting proportion among self-recruited participants decreased from 87 % to 23 % (2011 - 2012) and 82 % to 45 % (2012 - 2013). Women, highly educated, and middle-aged persons were overrepresented among self-recruited IMS participants (p< 0. 01). IMS (invited and self-recruited) and PBS weekly <b>incidence</b> <b>proportions</b> correlated strongest when no lags were applied (r = 0. 71 and r = 0. 69, p< 0. 05). This evaluation revealed socio-demographic misrepresentation and limited compliance among the self-recruited IMS participants. Yet, IMS offered a reasonable representation of the temporal ILI pattern in the community overall during the 2011 - 2012 and 2012 - 2013 influenza seasons and could be a simple tool for collecting community-based ILI data...|$|R

40|$|Hypothesis Older age, male sex, and low yearly {{hospital}} {{volume of}} cholecystectomy {{may increase the}} risk of bile duct injury (BDI), whereas the use of intraoperative cholangiography may decrease the risk. The incidence of BDI at cholecystectomy may have increased after the introduction of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Design Nationwide population-based study of all cholecystectomies registered in the Swedish Inpatient Registry from 1987 through 2001. Setting All hospitals performing inpatient cholecystectomies in Sweden. Patients Cholecystectomies were identified using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth and 10 th Revisions surgical procedure codes. After exclusion of patients with hepatobiliary and pancreatic malignancies, patients with codes indicating reconstructive bile duct operations within 1 year after cholecystectomy were considered BDI cases. Risk factors for BDI were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression. The <b>incidence</b> <b>proportion</b> of BDI was calculated by dividing the number of cases by the number of cholecystectomies. Main Outcome Measures Relative risks were estimated using odds ratios with 95 % confidence intervals, and <b>incidence</b> <b>proportion</b> was used to describe incidence. Results Among 152 776 cholecystectomies, 613 reconstructed BDIs (0. 40 %) were identified. Older age and male sex were positively associated with BDI, whereas intraoperative cholangiography was negatively associated with BDI. The <b>incidence</b> <b>proportion</b> of BDI was 0. 40 % from 1987 to 1990, decreased to 0. 32 % from 1991 to 1995, and increased to 0. 47 % from 1996 to 2001. The mean yearly hospital volume did not affect the risk of BDI. Conclusions Older age and male sex increased the risk of BDI, whereas intraoperative cholangiography was protective.

40|$|Purpose]The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the impact of risk communication about bisphosphonate (BP) -related osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) on the number of reported cases to the Drug Adverse Reactions Reporting System and on the <b>incidence</b> <b>proportion</b> of ONJ in a hospital-based cohort study in Japan. [Method]We conducted a survey of the safety information on BP-related ONJ available from regulatory authorities, pharmaceutical manufacturers and academic associations. We also performed a trend analysis of a dataset from the Drug Adverse Reactions Reporting System and a sub-analysis, using previously constructed data from a retrospective cohort study. [Results]Risk communication from pharmaceutical manufacturers and academic associations began within 1 year after revisions were made to the package inserts, in October 2006. Twenty times more cases of ONJ have been reported to regulatory authority since 2007, compared with the period before 2007. In our cohort, the <b>incidence</b> <b>proportion</b> of ONJ during and after 2009 was four times greater than before 2009. During this period, BPs were frequently prescribed, whereas there was no increase in the use of alternative agents, such as selective estrogen receptor modulators.

The recreational activity and sport of surfing has grown dramatically since the 1960 s, but scientific research has been poorly mirrored in comparison with most other mainstream sports. Purpose: To identify the incidence, severity, location, type, and mechanism of acute injuries in recreational and competitive surfers over a 12 -month period. Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study. Methods: An online survey using an open-source survey application was utilized. The survey consisted of 2 primary sections: Section 1 included demographic information and participation levels (age, height, weight, hours surfed, competitive level); section 2 incorporated injury type, mechanism, severity, and injury management. Results: A total of 1348 participants (91. 3 % males; 43. 1 % competitive surfers) were included in data analysis. A total of 512 acute injuries were classified as major, providing an <b>incidence</b> <b>proportion</b> of 0. 38 (CI, 0. 35 - 0. 41) acute injuries per year. The incidence rate was calculated to be 1. 79 (CI, 1. 67 - 1. 92) major injuries per 1000 hours of surfing. The shoulder, ankle, and head/face regions had the highest frequencies of acute injury, representing 16. 4 %, 14. 6 %, and 13. 3 %, respectively. Injuries were predominantly of muscular, joint, and skin origin, representing 30. 3 %, 27. 7 %, and 18. 9 %, respectively. Skin injuries were primarily a result of direct trauma, while joint and muscular injuries were mainly a result of maneuvers performed and repetitive actions. Key risk factors that increased the incidence of sustaining an acute injury included competitive status, hours surfed (. 6. 5 hours/week), {{and the ability to}} perform aerial maneuvers. The <b>incidence</b> <b>proportion</b> for surfers completing aerial maneuvers was calculated to be 0. 48 (CI, 0. 39 - 0. 58) major injuries per year, this being the highest <b>incidence</b> <b>proportion</b> irrespective of competitive status.

40|$|Objective:Ventilator-associated event {{surveillance}} {{was introduced}} in the National Healthcare Safety Network in 2013, replacing surveillance for ventilator-associated pneumonia in adult inpatient locations. We determined incidence rates and characteristics of ventilator-associated events reported to the National Healthcare Safety Network. Design, Setting, and Patients:We analyzed data reported from U. S. healthcare facilities for ventilator-associated events that occurred in 2014, the first year during which ventilator-associated event surveillance definitions were stable. We used negative binomial regression modeling to identify healthcare facility and inpatient location characteristics associated with ventilator-associated events. We calculated ventilator-associated event incidence rates, rate distributions, and ventilator utilization ratios in critical care and noncritical care locations and described event characteristics. Measurements and Main Results:A total of 1, 824 healthcare facilities reported 32, 772 location months of ventilator-associated event surveillance data to the National Healthcare Safety Network in 2014. Critical care unit pooled mean ventilator-associated event incidence rates ranged from 2. 00 to 11. 79 per 1, 000 ventilator days, whereas noncritical care unit rates ranged from 0 to 14. 86 per 1, 000 ventilator days. The pooled mean proportion of ventilator-associated events defined as infection-related varied from 15. 38 % to 47. 62 % in critical care units. Pooled mean ventilator utilization ratios in critical care units ranged from 0. 24 to 0. 47. Conclusions:We found substantial variability in ventilator-associated event <b>incidence,</b> <b>proportions</b> of ventilator-associated events characterized as infection-related, and ventilator utilization within and among location types.

The aims of this study were to evaluate simultaneously the effects of smoking during pregnancy on various obstetric complications, using data from a large medical database, and to investigate the expediency of using a case-cohort design for such an analysis. Methods: A case-cohort study was conducted within the Japan Perinatal Registry Network database. Perinatal information on infant deliveries was entered into the database at 125 medical centers in Japan. The base population of the study was 180 855 pregnant women registered in the database from 2001 through 2005. The outcome measures were the incidences of 11 different obstetric complications. Logistic regression models were used to estimate age-adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) and relative excess <b>incidence</b> <b>proportions</b> (REIs). Results: The overall prevalence of smoking during pregnancy was 5. 8 % in the base cohort, and the prevalence was higher among younger women.

A total of 1, 377 woodworkers (1, 137 males; 240 females) and 297 reference workers (137 males; 160 females) participated. Data on respiratory symptoms, employment and smoking habits were collected. Wood dust exposure was assessed from baseline dust measurements, and cumulative wood dust exposure was assessed by study-specific job exposure matrices and exposure time. The geometric mean (geometric SD) dust level decreased during the study period from 0. 94 (2. 1) to 0. 60 (1. 6) mg?m- 3. Adjusted analysis revealed positive associations for cumulative <b>incidence</b> <b>proportion</b> of chronic bronchitis and daily coughing for female woodworkers versus female reference workers. The cumulative <b>incidence</b> <b>proportion</b> of daily coughing and chronic bronchitis were found to be associated with baseline wood dust exposure in a dose-dependent manner. The odds ratio (95 % confidence interval) for daily coughing (with reference to the lowest exposure quartile) was 1. 6 (0. 6 – 4. 3), 3. 2 (0. 9 – 6. 8) and 3. 8 (1. 5 – 9. 7), respectively, in the second and third lowest and the highest quartile.

The one-year <b>incidence</b> <b>proportion</b> of recovery (of at least one year duration) was 11 % (95 % CI: 10 - 12) among women and 14 % (95 % CI: 12 - 16) among men. CONCLUSION: Bothersome neck pain is most common in middle-aged individuals. Women are {{more likely than men to}} have and to develop bothersome neck pain, and less likely to recover from such pain. Younger men and women have a higher incidence, but recover more often from bothersome neck pain than older individuals...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundEtanercept is {{approved}} {{for the treatment}} of chronic moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults. ObjectiveWe sought to evaluate the long-term safety of etanercept in a real-world clinical setting. Assessment of etanercept efficacy was a secondary objective. MethodsOBSERVE- 5 is a 5 -year observational safety registry initiated in May 2006 at multiple sites in the United States and Canada. Data collection includes the number of serious adverse events, serious infectious events, and prespecified events of medical interest. Efficacy data include body surface area assessments, physician and patient global assessments of psoriasis, and the Dermatology Life Quality Index. This interim analysis presents data from the first 3 years of the follow-up period. ResultsA total of 2511 patients were enrolled. Of 1890 patients continuing in the registry after 3 years, 113  were inactive for 1 to 2 years, and 115 were inactive for longer than 2 years. The 3 -year <b>incidence</b> <b>proportions</b> of serious adverse events and serious infectious events based on Kaplan-Meier methodology were 0. 14 and 0. 04, respectively. The observed numbers of patients experiencing lymphoma, serious infectious events requiring hospitalization, nonmelanoma skin cancer, and malignancies excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer were not higher than the expected number of cases estimated from a large US administrative health claims database. LimitationsThe registry lacks a control group, and the study is too small to measure the frequency of rare events. ConclusionEtanercept demonstrated good tolerability in patients with plaque psoriasis in the clinical setting in this interim analysis. No new or unexpected safety concerns were observed...|$|R
40|$|This {{review was}} {{undertaken}} {{to assess the}} historical evidence of the disease incidence and burden of laboratory-confirmed respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in medically attended older adults. A qualitative systematic literature review was performed; no statistical synthesis of the data was planned, in anticipation of expected heterogeneity across studies in this population. A literature search of PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library was conducted for studies of medically attended RSV in older adults (≥ 50 years) published in the last 15 years. Two independent reviewers screened titles and abstracts based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. From 10 studies reporting <b>incidence</b> <b>proportions,</b> RSV may be the causative agent in up to 12 % of medically attended acute respiratory illness in older adults unselected for comorbidities, with variations in clinical setting and by year. In multiple studies, medically attended-RSV incidence among older adults not selected for having underlying health conditions increased with increasing age. Of prospectively followed lung transplant recipients, 16 % tested positive for RSV. In hospitalized adults with chronic cardiopulmonary diseases, 8 % to 13 % were infected with RSV during winter seasons (8 %- 13 %) or metapneumovirus season (8 %). Hospitalizations for RSV in older adults typically lasted 3 to 6 days, with substantial proportions requiring intensive care unit admission and mechanical ventilation. Among older adults hospitalized with RSV, the mortality rate was 6 % to 8 %. Protection of older adults against RSV could reduce respiratory-related burden, especially as age increases and the prevalence of comorbidities (especially cardiopulmonary comorbidities) grows...|$|R
40|$|The red-spotted grouper, Epinephelus akaara, is one {{of marine}} fish species {{targeted}} for mariculture in Japan. The artificial mass seedling production of these species has been largely successful. However, the survival is still unstable. The effect of tank colors on the feeding <b>incidence,</b> feeding <b>proportion,</b> growth and survival rates in the early stage of the red-spotted grouper were examined. The results showed the feeding <b>incidence,</b> feeding <b>proportion,</b> growth, and survival rates at different tank colors were highly significantly different (P< 0. 001). Post hoc multiple comparisons based on Tukey’s test showed significant differences (P< 0. 05) regarding feeding incidence between yellow (70. 45 %) compared to white (55. 83 %), black (48. 42 %), green (41. 67 %), blue (35. 17 %), and red (32. 50 %). The highest feeding proportion (number of rotifer in the stomach/larvae) was found at yellow (5. 62), followed by white (2. 47), black (1. 97), green (1. 92), blue (1. 71), and red (1. 28). The specific growth rate showed significant differences (P< 0. 05) were found at yellow (2. 14 %) and white (1. 84 %) compared to black (1. 46 %), green (1. 20 %), blue (1. 15 %), and red (1. 13 %).

40|$|COPD {{exacerbation}} incidence {{rates are}} often ascertained retrospectively through patient recall and self-reports. We compared exacerbation ascertainment through patient self-reports and single-physician chart review to central adjudication {{by a committee}} and explored determinants and consequences of misclassification. Self-reported exacerbations (event-based definition) in 409 primary care patients with COPD participating in the International Collaborative Effort on Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease: Exacerbation Risk Index Cohorts (ICE COLD ERIC) cohort were ascertained every 6 months over 3 years. Exacerbations were adjudicated by single experienced physicians and an adjudication committee who had information from patient charts. We assessed the accuracy (sensitivities and specificities) of self-reports and single-physician chart review against a central adjudication committee (AC) (reference standard). We used multinomial logistic regression and bootstrap stability analyses to explore determinants of misclassifications. The AC identified 648 exacerbations, corresponding to an incidence rate of 0. 60 ± 0. 83 exacerbations/patient-year and a cumulative <b>incidence</b> <b>proportion</b> of 58. 9 %. Patients self-reported 841 exacerbations (incidence rate, 0. 75 ± 1. 01; <b>incidence</b> <b>proportion,</b> 59. 7 %). The sensitivity and specificity of self-reports were 84 % and 76 %, respectively, those of single-physician chart review were between 89 % and 96 % and 87 % and 99 %, respectively. The multinomial regression model and bootstrap selection showed that having experienced more exacerbations was the only factor consistently associated with underreporting and overreporting of exacerbations (underreporters: relative risk ratio [RRR], 2. 16; 95 % CI, 1. 76 - 2. 65 and overreporters: RRR, 1. 67; 95 % CI, 1. 39 - 2. 00). Patient 6 -month recall of exacerbation events are inaccurate. This may lead to inaccurate estimates of incidence measures and underestimation of treatment effects. The use of multiple data sources combined with event adjudication could substantially reduce sample size requirements and possibly cost of studies. www. ClinicalTrials. gov, NCT 0070660...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Official {{descriptive}} data from France showed a strong increase in breast-cancer incidence between 1980 to 2005 without a corresponding change in breast-cancer mortality. This study quantifies {{the part of}} incidence increase due to secular changes in risk factor exposure and in overdiagnosis due to organised or opportunistic screening. Overdiagnosis was defined as non progressive tumours diagnosed as cancer at histology or progressive cancer that would remain asymptomatic until time of death for another cause. Methods Comparison between age-matched cohorts from 1980 to 2005. All women residing in France and born 1911 - 1915, 1926 - 1930 and 1941 - 1945 are included. Sources are official data sets and published French reports on screening by mammography, age and time specific breast-cancer incidence and mortality, hormone replacement therapy, alcohol and obesity. Outcome measures include breast-cancer incidence differences adjusted for changes in risk factor distributions between pairs of age-matched cohorts who had experienced different levels of screening intensity. Results There was an 8 -fold {{increase in the number}} of mammography machines operating in France between 1980 and 2000. Opportunistic and organised screening increased over time. In comparison to age-matched cohorts born 15 years earlier, recent cohorts had adjusted <b>incidence</b> <b>proportion</b> over 11 years that were 76 % higher [95 % confidence limits (CL) 67 %, 85 %] for women aged 50 to 64 years and 23 % higher [95 % CL 15 %, 31 %] for women aged 65 to 79 years. Given that mortality did not change correspondingly, this increase in adjusted 11 year <b>incidence</b> <b>proportion</b> was considered as an estimate of overdiagnosis. Conclusions Breast cancer may be overdiagnosed because screening increases diagnosis of slowly progressing non-life threatening cancer and increases misdiagnosis among women without progressive cancer. We suggest that these effects could largely explain the reported "epidemic" of breast cancer in France. Better predictive classification of tumours is needed in order to avoid unnecessary cancer diagnoses and subsequent procedures. </p...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} done to assess the {{epidemic}} features of hand, {{foot and mouth disease}} in Yunnan Province. Surveillance data from the beginning of 2008 through the end of 2010 were analyzed to conduct the demographic data of patients and morbidity as well as the estimation between possible risk factors for severe or fatal cases. Of the 75 109 cases reported, laboratory tests confirmed 3691 cases. Thus, the average annual <b>incidence</b> <b>proportion</b> was 55 per 100 000 population with a total case fatality rate of 0. 04 %. A seasonal peak was observed in May, along with a smaller winter peak in 2010. Most severe and fatal cases were caused by enterovirus 71. It is demonstrated that most of the severe and fatal cases occurred in very young children and that delayed access to health care led to the higher likelihood of serious illness...|$|E
40|$|The {{question}} has been raised whether hyperprolactinemia in humans is associated with an excess risk for breast cancer. We aimed to assess {{the risk of breast}} cancer in a previously defined large cohort of patients treated for idiopathic hyperprolactinemia or prolactinomas. Based on the pattern of drug prescriptions we identified 11, 314 subjects in the PHARMO network with at least one dispensing of dopamine agonists between 1996 and 2006. Of these, 1, 607 subjects were considered to have dopamine agonist-treated hyperprolactinemia based on the prescribing pattern. For the present analysis, we included only women (n = 1, 342). Patients with breast cancer were identified by hospital discharge codes. Data on breast cancer incidence in the Netherlands were derived from the Dutch cancer registry. Standardized mortality ratio (SMR) was the measure of outcome to assess the association between hyperprolactinemia and breast cancer. The 1, 342 patients accounted for a total of 6, 576 person years. Eight patients with breast cancer during follow-up were identified. Indirect standardization with <b>incidence</b> <b>proportions</b> from the general Dutch population revealed a 7. 47 expected cases. The calculated SMR for breast cancer risk in patients treated hyperprolactinemia was 1. 07 (95 % confidence interval 0. 50 - 2. 03). In conclusion, there is no clear evidence for increased breast cancer risk in female patients treated for either idiopathic hyperprolactinemia or prolactinomas. The uncertainty about the exact risk that is due to the relatively low number of breast cancer cases, should be overcome by pooling results in a future meta-analysi...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The goal of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the incidence of complications and the functional outcome after open reduction and internal fixation with the proximal humeral locking plate (Philos). DESIGN: Prospective case series. SETTING: Multicenter study in 8 trauma units (levels I, II, and III) with recruitment between September 12, 2002, and January 9, 2005. PATIENTS: One hundred fifty-seven patients with 158 fractures. INTERVENTION: Open reduction and internal fixation with a Philos plate. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Occurrence of postoperative complications up to 1 year and active follow-up for 1 year with radiologic assessment to observe fracture healing, alignment, reduction, avascular necrosis, and functional outcome measurements including Constant, Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand, and Neer scores. RESULTS: One-year follow-up rate was 84 %. The incidence of experiencing any implant-related complication was 9 % and 35 % for nonimplant-related complications. Primary screw perforation was the most frequent problem (14 %) followed by secondary screw perforation (8 %) and avascular necrosis (8 %). After 1 year, a mean Constant score of 72 points (87 % of the contralateral noninjured side), a mean Neer score of 76 points, and a mean Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand score of 16 points were achieved. CONCLUSIONS: Fixation with Philos plates preserves achieved reduction, and a good functional outcome can be expected. However, complication <b>incidence</b> <b>proportions</b> are high, particularly due to primary and secondary screw perforations into the glenohumeral joint, with an overall complication rate of 35 %. More accurate length measurement and shorter screw selection should prevent primary screw perforation. Awareness of obtaining anatomic reduction of the tubercles and restoring the medial support should reduce the incidence of secondary screw perforations, even in osteopenic bone...|$|R
