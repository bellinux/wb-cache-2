Special attention is paid to the books and articles in journals and newspapers that discuss Marulić and his work. Also, the author follows the activity of home and foreign students of Marulić, with whom he keeps lively correspondence. The most important event in 1994 was undoubtedly the program dedicated to Marulić in Rome. The Celebrazione Accademica in onore di Marko Maruloć laico teologo e scrittore croato trilingue (The academic celebration in honor of Marco Marulo, layman theologian and Croatian trilingual writer) was held at the Pontificia università Gregoriana, on 15 november 1994. The speakers were Charles Béné, Mirko Tomasović, Jesús López Gay, Branimir Glavičić and Anton Benvin, the chairman was “rettore magnifico” of the Gregoriana, Giuseppe Pittau, and the moderator of the conference was Ivan Fuček. On 17 November the aforesaid scholars were received in audience by Pope John Paul II, on which occasion they handed to the Pope the volumes of the Collected Works of Marko Marulić that have been issued so <b>far.</b> Charles <b>Béné,</b> professor emeritus of the Stendahl University of Grenoble and meritorious researcher of Marulić’s work, particularly of his European responses, is the first winner of an award established for the merits in the promotion of Croatian culture in the world. The award has been founded by the INA - Croatian oil industry and the Croatian Culture Club from Zagreb and the award ceremony took place in June 1995, in Zagreb. At the end, the author reports on the English translation of Marulić’s epic Judita (Judith, translated from Croatian by Henry R. Cooper, Jr., Columbia University Press, 1991) and lists the international references of Colloquia Maruliana: Bibliographies: -Humanistica Lovaniensia, Vol. XLII - 1993, p. 481 (CM I) -Humanistica Lovaniensia, Vol. XLII - 1994, p. 463 (CM II and III) -Bollettino di studi latini, anno XXIV - fascicolo II, Luglio-Dicembre 1994, pp. 708 - 709, (CM II and III) Reviews: -Bibliotheque d’humanisme et renaissance, volume 56, 1994 (Ch.

40|$|Every year, {{outbreaks}} of in. uenza appear {{across the world}} and cause substantial morbidity and mortality in the general population, particularly in persons with underlying conditions including asthma. Because the in. uenza virus changes constantly, man’s acquired immunity is usually only partial and therefore the population will always {{to a greater or}} lesser extent be susceptible. In asthmatics, in. uenza causes upper respiratory tract infections that frequently trigger exacerbations. Large population-based studies have estimated the morbidity and the risk of developing clinical complications in people with asthma. During in. uenza periods, hospitalisation, drug prescriptions and visits to physicians increase, and asthma exacerbations and pneumonia have been reported as the most common complications. Children with asthma are at a higher risk for complications than adults. Reasons to vaccinate asthmatics are the prevention of in. uenza-related illness and complications, including asthma exacerbations and death. However, the protective effect of in. uenza vaccination in asthmatic patients is still disputed. So <b>far</b> no unequivocal <b>bene.</b> cial effect of in. uenza vaccination in asthmatics was found in observational and experimental studies in the sense of reduction of asthma exacerbations and of other complications. Although opinions on the clinical effectiveness of in. uenza vaccination in asthmatic patients are currently based on consensus and indirect evidence, the guidelines of most Western countries advise to vaccinate patients with asthma. As a result, in asthma care, in. uenza vaccination is considered to be a cornerstone for quality of care. Despite these recommendations only a minority of asthma patients is vaccinated worldwide. Reasons for this are fear among patients that vaccination could cause in. uenza, and doubts about bene. ts and effectiveness of in. uenza vaccination amongst physicians and patients. Aim of this thesis is to provide evidence to either support or modify the policy of vaccinating asthmatic patients as is described in most western guidelines. I will focus on children, because in children asthma is the most important reason for in. uenza vaccination and asthma is the most frequent chronic disease in childhood. In chapter 2 we report on the available knowledge of the incidence of in. uenza, the natural course and the burden of disease. Incidence. gures are a prerequisite to reliably forecast the impact of preventive measures for in. uenza and calculate the number needed to treat in order to prevent one additional case of in. uenza. Likewise, incidence. gures are also needed to estimate the number of participants for preventive or therapeutic trials. We conducted a systematic review to estimate the incidence of in. uenza and concomitant morbidity and mortality in children 0 through 19 years (0 - 19 years). We searched for observational studies and placebo or non treated arms of experimental studies for information on laboratory proven in. uenza illness. From a total of 2758 papers, 356 papers were reviewed on the basis of abstract or title. Sixteen papers were added searching the reference list of these papers. Finally 28 studies met inclusion criteria. They showed a varying incidence of in. uenza with. gures up to 46 %. However, when looking at two long term observational studies and averaging seasonal. uctuations, the overall incidence of in. uenza in children was found to be between 5 % (children aged 0 - 19 years) and 9. 5 % (children aged 0 - 5 years) per year. Serious morbidity was seldom reported. In the studies selected we found no cases of mortality. Our conclusion is that, given the average incidence for in. uenza found, the self­limited character of the disease, the mild associated morbidity and the rare cases of mortality in children, one can question if in. uenza in children at a population level is a major public health problem. As a result of this outcome we advise that preventive strategies for children should be reconsidered. When investigating preventive strategies for in. uenza one should be led by the average incidence and include more seasons. In chapters 3 - 6 we present various results of our randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial in 696 children with asthma, aged 6 - 18 years. Parenteral vaccination with inactivated in. uenza vaccine or placebo took place approximately November 1 st, and children were followed until April 1 st of the next year. Local and systemic symptoms, possibly as a result of vaccination, and airway symptoms were reported in a diary. Symptoms scored during the. rst week after vaccination were considered to be adverse effects of the vaccination. When symptom scores reached a prede. ned level, a pharyngeal swab was taken and spirometry was performed. One week later a quality of life questionnaire was administered. Primary outcome was the number of asthma exacerbations associated with virologically proven in. uenza infection. Three hundred forty-nine children were assigned placebo, and 347 were assigned vaccine. In chapter 3, we address the adverse effects of in. uenza vaccination, especially on asthma. Because there is a constant debate that in. uenza vaccination may provoke an asthma exacerbation, a decisive answer to these doubts may affect vaccination rate. During the. rst week after vaccination, participants recorded local, in. uenza like and asthma symptoms as well as use of medication, health care use and absenteeism. As reported in previous studies, vaccine recipients reported redness and stiffness of the arm much more often than placebo recipients. For symptoms of in. uenza like illness, fever, headache and myalgia showed smaller though signi. cant differences during the. rst season, as did hoarseness during the second season, all favouring placebo. These differences may be an expression of the difference between strains used in the vaccine during the two seasons or may be a result of a difference between populations studied in the two in. uenza seasons. Except for cough during the day in the. rst season, favouring placebo, there were no differences indicating that vaccination exacerbates asthma. We conclude that in. uenza vaccination does not seem to exacerbate asthma and can be given safely to asthmatic children. In the literature there is little evidence that in. uenza vaccination reduces asthma exacerbations. In chapter 4 we report the main results of our randomised double­blind placebo-controlled trial in asthmatic children regarding the preventive effect of in. uenza vaccination on clinical illness, notably asthma exacerbations. Children reported, as described above, airway symptoms in a diary. When symptom scores reached a prede. ned level, a pharyngeal swab was taken. Primary outcome was the number of asthma exacerbations associated with virologically proven in. uenza infection. We considered a reduction in asthma exacerbations of at least 50 % as clinically relevant. Three hundred forty-nine children were assigned placebo, and 347 were assigned vaccine. Pharyngeal swabs positive for in. uenza were related to 42 asthma exacerbations, 24 in the vaccine group and 18 in the placebo group, a difference of 33 % favouring placebo (31 % after adjustment for confounders; 95 % con. dence interval, – 34 % to 161 %). In. uenza-related asthma exacerbations were of similar severity in both groups; they lasted 3. 1 days shorter in the vaccine group (95 % con. dence interval, – 6. 2 to - 0. 002 days, p= 0. 06). We conclude that in. uenza vaccination did not result in a signi. cant reduction of the number, severity, or duration of asthma exacerbations caused by in. uenza. We think additional studies, using in. uenza proven clinical illness as an endpoint, are warranted to justify routine in. uenza vaccination of children with asthma. Health-related quality of life (physical, social and emotional impairments) should be an important measure in evaluations of the management of childhood asthma. Therefore, in chapter 5, the Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (PAQLQ), a questionnaire in English to de. ne quality of life in asthmatic children, is validated for the Dutch translation. We assessed psychometric properties, responsiveness, and longitudinal and cross­sectional construct validity of the Dutch PAQLQ version. The study group consisted of 238 children (6 – 18 years) with asthma, a subset of children from our trial on in. uenza vaccination, with complete respiratory symptom diaries in the course of one winter season; each child had one (or more) PAQLQ measurement(s) concerning one (or more) week(s) with relatively many symptoms (n= 238). Each child also had one PAQLQ measurement concerning another week with relatively few symptoms. The PAQLQ scores of these weeks were compared. Additionally, in a subgroup of the study group that had experienced two or more ‘weeks with many symptoms’ (n= 101), we compared the PAQLQ scores for two different weeks with many symptoms of these children. All Cronbach’s a’s of the PAQLQ total score and domains were above 0. 70, except for Activities (a= 0. 54), indicating that the internal consistency of the questions in the questionnaire is moderate to good. Mean PAQLQ scores were signi. cantly different (p 0. 05) between a week with many symptoms and another week with many symptoms. These results indicate responsiveness of the instrument. Changes in lower respiratory tract symptoms, indicative of asthma severity, correlated better with changes in PAQLQ scores than changes in upper respiratory tract symptoms, which supports the longitudinal and cross-sectional construct validity. The assessed properties of the translation into Dutch were similar to those originally established for the PAQLQ in Canada. This study showed that the Dutch PAQLQ has adequate psychometric properties, excellent responsiveness, and that its longitudinal and cross-sectional construct validity is supported. As this|$|R
