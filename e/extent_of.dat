For reaction systems, the state variables (the numbers of moles, or concentrations) have recently been transformed into decoupled reaction variants (<b>extents</b> <b>of</b> reaction), and reaction invariants (<b>extents</b> <b>of</b> flow) (Amrhein et al., AIChE Journal, 2010). This paper analyses the conditions under which an open homogeneous reaction system is cooperative in the extents domain. Further, it is shown that the dynamics <b>of</b> the <b>extents</b> <b>of</b> flow exhibit cooperative behavior. Further, we provide the conditions under which the dynamics <b>of</b> the <b>extents</b> <b>of</b> reaction exhibit cooperative behavior.

40|$|SeaWIFS SeaWiFS Chl and AVHRR SST time-series in August, 1998 {{were used}} to {{evaluate}} short-term variability of Chl associated with upwelling events in the western Taiwan Strait. <b>Extents</b> <b>of</b> eutrophic waters(SeaWiFS Chlorophyll > 1 mg/m(3)) and <b>extents</b> <b>of</b> colder than non-upwelling waters were calculated for the western strait and for {{the north and south}} portions, respectively. High <b>extents</b> <b>of</b> eutrophic waters were always accompanied by high <b>extents</b> <b>of</b> colder than nonupwelling waters, indicative of tight coupling of Chi with SST evolution and thus with upwelling activities. Only one-day lag of phytoplankton growth to upwelling was detected. The temporal patterns of upwelling events were found different in the northwestern and southwestern Taiwan Strait. In the north portion, a short relaxation of upwelling probably occur-red between early and mid-August. One unique strong upwelling event was likely going from early through mid-August, peaking before Aug. 13 (th) in the south portion. It resulted in chlorophyll enhancement developing and reaching peaks not concurrently in these two upwelling zones, The duration of one upwelling event in the western Taiwan Strait in August was estimated to be ca. 12 days. Two distinctive upwelling systems located in the northwestern and southwestern Taiwan Strait were further inferred...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the microbial degradation of 14 C-labelled hexadecane, octacosane, phenanthrene and pyrene and considered how degradation might be optimised in three genuinely hydrocarbon contaminated soils from former petroleum refinery sites. Hydrocarbon mineralisation by the indigenous microbial community was monitored over 23 d. Hydrocarbon mineralisation enhancement by nutrient amendment (biostimulation), hydrocarbon degrader addition (bioaugmentation) and combined nutrient and degrader amendment, was also explored. The ability of indigenous soil microflora to mineralise 14 C-target hydrocarbons was appreciable; ≥ 16 % mineralised in all soils. Generally, addition of nutrients or degraders increased the rates and <b>extents</b> <b>of</b> mineralisation of 14 C-hydrocarbons. However, the addition of nutrients and degraders in combination had a negative effect upon 14 C-octacosane mineralisation and resulted in lower <b>extents</b> <b>of</b> mineralisation in the three soils. In general, the rates and <b>extents</b> <b>of</b> mineralisation will be dependent upon treatment type, nature of the contamination and adaptation of the ingenious microbial communi...|$|R
