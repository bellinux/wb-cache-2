5|$|Burnham {{was born}} on May 11, 1861 on a Dakota Sioux Indian {{reservation}} in Minnesota, to a missionary family living near the small pioneer town of Tivoli (now gone), about 20 miles (32km) from Mankato. His father, the Reverend Edwin Otway Burnham, was a Presbyterian minister educated and ordained in New York; {{he was born in}} Ghent, Kentucky. His mother Rebecca Russell Burnham had spent most of her childhood in Iowa, having emigrated with her family from Westminster, England at the age of three. In the Dakota War of 1862, Chief Little Crow and his Sioux warriors attacked the nearby town New Ulm, Minnesota; Burnham's father was in Mankato buying ammunition at the time, so when Burnham's mother saw Sioux approaching her cabin dressed in war paint, she knew she had to leave and could never escape carrying her baby. She hid Frederick in a basket of <b>green</b> <b>corn</b> husks in a corn field and fled for her life. Once the Sioux attack had been repulsed, she returned to find their house burned down, but the baby Frederick was safe, fast asleep in the basket with the corn husks.|$|E

25|$|By the 1980s, Seminole {{communities}} {{were concerned about}} loss of language and tradition. Many tribal members began to revive the observance of traditional <b>Green</b> <b>Corn</b> Dance ceremonies, and some moved away from Christianity observance. By 2000 religious tension between <b>Green</b> <b>Corn</b> Dance attendees and Christians (particularly Baptists) decreased. Some Seminole families participate in both religions; these practitioners have developed a Christianity that has absorbed some tribal traditions.|$|E

25|$|The Industrial Workers of the World {{shared the}} brunt of popular indignation, {{despite the fact that}} the {{organization}} took no part in the <b>Green</b> <b>Corn</b> Rebellion and was related to the WCU only by virtue of the latter group having formed in response to the IWW's refusal to organize tenant farmers. The IWW was still blamed for every action of the WCU, however, and the bogey <b>Green</b> <b>Corn</b> Rebellion was ultimately used as a justification for further measures against the IWW nationally.|$|E
25|$|Seminole tribes {{generally}} follow Christianity, both Protestantism and Roman Catholicism, {{and their}} traditional Native religion, which is expressed through the stomp dance and the <b>Green</b> <b>Corn</b> Ceremony held at their ceremonial grounds. Indigenous peoples have practiced <b>Green</b> <b>Corn</b> rituals for centuries. Contemporary southeastern Native American tribes, {{such as the}} Seminole and Muscogee Creek, still practice these ceremonies. As converted Christian Seminole established their own churches, they incorporated their traditions, as Christianity is a syncretic religion, able to absorb other influences. Seminole Christian churches often sing hymns in their traditional languages.|$|E

As Christian pastors began preaching on reservations, <b>Green</b> <b>Corn</b> Ceremony attendance decreased.

25|$|The {{popularity}} of former Governor Charles N. Haskell had strengthened the already strong {{position of the}} Oklahoma Democratic Party in the state.

For {{the first time in}} Oklahoma’s history, the two major parties were joined by a third party in the contest for governor. Robertson faced Republican Horace G.

Many voters considered them unpatriotic. Robertson won in a landslide, and other state Democratic candidates won considerable majorities in both the Oklahoma House of Representatives and Oklahoma Senate.|$|E
