40|$|The {{theory of}} social {{labelling}} has radically revaluated several propositions previously widely {{accepted in the}} sociology of deviations and in criminology. It is mostly {{a question of the}} departure from the deterministic approach giving preference to the etiology analysis of deviational and criminal phenomena combined with a stress <b>on</b> <b>the</b> role of social control understood as a factor being at the bottom of social order. The theory has also criticized discriminating deviational and criminal phenomena from other social <b>facts</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> of their objective and qualitative differences, The proposition of "distinctness" of deviated persons or criminals from other people, which was in addition to account for deviational behaviour, was pronouncedly dismissed. A new way of defining the deviational phenomena was developed in the social labelling theory upon application of the behavioral criterion of reaction to a given type of behaviour in place of the previous formal criterion of a norm contravention. Simultaneously a, stress was laid <b>on</b> <b>the</b> role of an intragroup interaction in forming judgements and interpretations of other persons behaviour and in considering it to be deviated. Reflections <b>on</b> <b>the</b> negative effect of the institution of social control were extended by introducing a notion of the secondary deivation. Consequently it was suggested in the new trend to reevaluate the previous treatment of deviational and criminal phenomena and replacing the "correctional" attitude with the one of "understanding". That would imply a substantial change in methods and ways of treating phenomena of deviation and deviated persons themselves. To sum up: irrespective of the disputability of its several propositions, the social labelling theory can be considered as a particularly original attempt at creating a complimentary approach to the subject in relation to the previous theories of deviation and crime.

2500|$|The UAV {{incident}} {{triggered a}} new rise in tensions between the two countries. Russia accused Georgia of trying to exploit the NATO support to solve the Abkhazia problem by force and of sending its troops into the Georgia-controlled upper Kodori Valley in northeast Abkhazia. However, the U.N. monitors in Abkhazia stated earlier in April they did not observe any military buildup {{on either side of}} the demilitarization line. On April 29, Russia announced it would increase its military presence in the region and threatened to retaliate militarily against Georgia’s efforts. According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, it increased the number of its peacekeepers in Abkhazia to 2,542 peacekeepers, which is 458 short of the 3,000 limit set by agreement. The Georgian Prime Minister Lado Gurgenidze said Georgia would treat any additional troops in Abkhazia as aggressors, while President Saakashvili, in his televised address, pledged to pursue only a peaceful line in the conflict areas and called upon the Abkhaz and Ossetians to unite with Georgia in defying attempts by [...] "outrageous and irresponsible external force to trigger bloodshed". The European Union also urged caution, saying that to increase troop numbers would be [...] "unwise" [...] given current tensions, while the United States called on Russia [...] "to reconsider some provocative steps" [...] it had taken in respect of Georgia’s breakaway region Abkhazia. Georgia also suspended the talks regarding Russia's admission to the World Trade Organization (WTO) and threatened to veto the process.

[...] his meeting her halfway {{had been the only}} course open to him. She was with him to the end--or she might be--in a way Kate wasn't; and even if it literally made her society meanwhile more soothing he must just brush away the question of why it shouldn't.

Such only was at bottom what there was between them, and two or three times over it made the hour pass. These were occasions--two and a scrap--on which he had come and gone without mention of Kate. Now that almost as never yet he had licence to ask for her, the queer turn of their affair made it a false note. It was another queer turn that when he talked with Aunt Maud about Milly nothing else seemed to come up. He called upon her almost avowedly for that purpose, and it was the queerest turn of all that the state of his nerves should require it. He liked her better; he was really behaving, he had occasion to say to himself, as if he liked her best. The thing was absolutely that she met him halfway. Nothing could have been broader than her vision, than her loquacity, than her sympathy. It appeared to gratify, to satisfy her to see him as he was; that too had its effect. It was all of course the last thing that could have seemed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cards, a change by which he was completely free with this lady; and it wouldn't indeed have come about if--for another monstrosity--he hadn't ceased to be free with Kate.

The house, a large red brick one, built round a court, so that it looks low in proportion to its width, is <b>on</b> <b>the</b> level <b>ground</b> at <b>the</b> top, flat as it fronts to the south, but in the rear descending rapidly. In <b>fact,</b> <b>on</b> that side <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> have <b>the</b> air of cresting the hill, {{and there is a}} group of exceedingly tall pine-trees which are a land-mark of <b>the</b> country <b>on</b> all sides, though the tallest of them was blown down a few years ago. Near them is one of the old-fashioned orangeries, {{with a great deal of}} wall and very little glass, and near it stands the sundial of Newtonian fame." ...|$|R
40|$|The global {{positioning}} system (GPS) is composed of thirty one satellites having atomic clocks with 10 ^- 15 accuracy on board and enables one to calibrate the primary standard for frequency <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Using <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that oscillators <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> have been successfully stabilized with high accuracy by receiving radio waves emitted from the GPS satellites, we set a constraint <b>on</b> <b>the</b> strain amplitude of the gravitational wave background h_ c. We find that the GPS has already placed a meaningful constraint, and <b>the</b> constraint <b>on</b> <b>the</b> continuous component of gravitational waves is given as h_ c< 4. 8 × 10 ^- 12 (1 / f) at 10 ^- 2 ≲ f ≲ 10 ^ 0 Hz, for stabilized oscillators with Δν/ν≃ 10 ^- 12. Thanks {{to the advantage of}} the Doppler tracking method, seismic oscillations do not affect the current constraint. Constraints <b>on</b> h_c in <b>the</b> same frequency range from the velocity measurements by the lunar explorers in the Apollo mission are also derived.
