5|$|A {{review of}} the book in the Leiden Journal of International Law by Tamás Hoffmann {{recommends}} the work to multiple potential readers, including those who engage in targeting killing, academics, and students. Hoffmann calls it a well-researched monograph and helpful reference work on the subject. The review places the book {{within the context of}} addressing legal issues inherent in debating the murky concept of targeted killing. Hoffmann states the book furthers prior attempts to come to a resolution {{on the question of the}} practice's legality. Helen Durhan praises the writing quality of Melzer's work, in a review for the Australian Year Book of International Law. Durhan writes the work is organized in an easily readable format and covers the topic with neutrality. She goes on to call the book a work representing the need for concerned discussion prior to implementing any policy involved in eliminating people. Of the author's focus throughout the work, Durhan observes that the author handles discussion of the legality of targeted killing in a clear and precise manner. The review concludes Melzer's thorough analysis <b>goes</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> way towards furthering scholars' impressions of legal issues surrounding when it is permitted for sovereign governments to kill people.|$|E

After she lulls us into {{a false sense of}} security ("I feel like the DJ is bodyguard / You see the way he keeps me safe? / With the treble and the bass?"), the track plunges into a pounding electro-house chorus that quite literally orders us to the dance floor... The result isn't quite as fresh and inventive as some of Guetta's recent output – Kelis' [...] 'Acapella', for example – but it <b>goes</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> way towards recapturing some of last summer's magic." [...] The site's other reviewer, Nick Levine, agreed saying that the song [...] "thumps as persuasively as Muhammad Ali circa 1967." [...] Robert Daw of Idolator said [...] "if you think Ms. Kelly is taking the go-go boots off anytime soon, then you'd best go lean against the wall, flower.

[...] Prior to The Bacon Cookbook, Villas had written other cookbooks {{including}} The Glory of Southern Cooking, My Mother's Southern Kitchen, and Biscuit Bliss. The Bacon Cookbook is his 15th book on food. In the lead-up to the 2009 International Bacon Day, Villas commented to Pork Magazine, [...] "People are starting to realize that bacon is no longer just a breakfast staple. Bacon is, without a doubt, one of the most versatile and flavorful options in the grocery aisle. Most importantly, a little bacon <b>goes</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> way. A sprinkle can enhance not only the flavor, but also the aroma and appeal of nearly any dish. We’re seeing chefs and home cooks add bacon to dishes you wouldn’t expect, like popcorn or cookies, and take traditional tastes to another dimension." [...] Villas explained to Salon, [...] "Bacon has the perfect balance of sweet, salty, smoky flavor, and the perfect balance of meaty and crispy texture." [...] Villas commented to CBS News that his book was part of a growing interest in bacon products, [...] "We have a lot more conscientious producers today, you know, really turning out fresh great product like we've got here in this store.

Ray of Light is truly like a prayer, and you know she'll take you there." [...] Roni Sarig, in a review for City Pages, was most impressed by Madonna's vocal range, depth, and clarity and called Ray of Light [...] "her richest, most accomplished record yet." [...] Music critic Robert Hilburn from Los Angeles Times wrote, [...] "One reason why her new Ray of Light is the most satisfying album of her career is that it reflects the soul-searching {{of a woman who}} is at a point in her life where she can look at herself with surprising candor and perspective." [...] Writing for Melody Maker in February 1998, Mark Roland drew comparisons with the music of St Etienne and Björk's Homogenic album, highlighting Ray of Lights lack of cynicism as its most positive aspect: [...] "It's not an album turned on the lathe of cynical pop manipulation, rather it's been squished out of a lump of clay on a foot-powered wheel. Lovingly teased into life, Ray of Light is like the ugly mug that doesn't match but is all the more special because of it." [...] Joan Anderman from The Boston Globe said that Ray of Light is a remarkable album. He described it as a deeply spiritual dance record, ecstatically textured, a serious cycle of songs that <b>goes</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> way toward liberating Madonna from a career built on scavenged images and cultivated identities. Robert Christgau was less impressed in Playboy, deeming Ray of Light a [...] "great-sounding" [...] but average record because of enlightenment themes that always yield awkward results for pop entertainers, although he praised sensual songs such as [...] "Skin" [...] and [...] "Candy Perfume Girl".|$|E

[...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger wrote that [...] "when Lost is at its best … it manages to balance revelations … with great character moments. [...] I don't know that I'd put this one in the pantheon (again, {{a lot of it}} was set-up for … [...] ), but it was definitely in the spirit of what I love about the show." [...] Kristin dos Santos of E! praised the chemistry between Naveen Andrews and Andrea Gabriel, who play Sayid and Nadia, respectively. [...] Chris Carabott of IGN gave Part 1 of the three-hour finale a 7.9. [...] He commended the music and called it [...] "a good opening to what should be an exciting season finale"; however, the lack of suspense in favor of set-up was cited as the reason for the modest rating. However, Carabott gave Parts 2 & 3 a perfect 10 review, tying with other perfect-10 episodes such as [...] "The Constant" [...] and [...] "Through the Looking Glass". He stated that [...] "Not a moment is wasted in this brilliantly paced and well-executed conclusion to what has been a fantastic season." [...] Dan Compora of SyFy Portal called [...] "Part 1" [...] "an excellent setup episode [...] fast pace, important revelations, and nearly a full utilization of the cast". [...] Compora decided that [...] "certain characters work much better in very small doses … a little bit of [...] <b>goes</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> way [...] it was nice to see Jack featured without completely dominating an episode." [...] Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV summed up Part 1 as [...] "very good", but said that the opening flashforward in which the Oceanic Six are reunited with their families was anticlimactic and [...] "although each flashforward scene had minor and major revelations, it felt patched together and a little sloppy, like Lindelof and Cuse had all this ground to cover in their quest to link all the action up to the final scene of season 3 … That said, the flashforward scenes all played out exceedingly well." [...] Daniel of TMZ welcomed the return of Richard (on the island) and gave the episode an [...] "A", saying that it had [...] "more than a few fantastic scenes. [...] All the flashforward scenes tonight were right on the money as far as I was concerned." [...] Jay Glatfelter of The Huffington Post [...] "really liked this episode" [...] and concluded that it [...] "definitely showcased the new breath of life the fourth season gave to the show." ...|$|E
