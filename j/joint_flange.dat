5000|$|A simple {{vertical}} crack with {{a freshly}} fractured surface and old rust {{marks on the}} face was easily distinguished {{to the side of}} the centre joint, extending from the bottom flange to the top of the girder. This was associated with a casting defect hidden behind a surface skin of sound metal at the thickest part of the section where the flanges met the web. This was described by the accident report as a large honeycomb, or drawhole, which measured 3½ ins (c 90 mm) across at the face, and narrowed to about l½ ins (c 40 mm). inside , 2⅜ ins (c 60 mm) in extreme depth and 6ins (c 150 mm). in extreme length, extending inwards and downwards ...but not within 1 ½ ins of the outer face of the <b>joint</b> <b>flange.</b> The total capacity of the hole, measured by filling it with water, was 15 ½ cubic inches (about 250 ml) and, as the metal immediately round the hole was not sound, this amount does not measure the actual extent of the flaw. [...] There were other signs of poor foundry practice when the girder had been cast; honeycombing elsewhere, a cold shut (incomplete fusion between different streams of filling metal), and residual stresses in the girder web (as a consequence of which, when sample cores were being drilled for testing, the web (but not the flanges) fractured along the line of holes. Whilst the metal appeared to be of good quality to the naked eye, the tested tensile strength of the metal varied widely from the lowest of ~4.5 tsi (c 70 MPa) (close to the honeycombing) with a mean of 7.5 tsi (c 115 MPa).The accident report says that the girder if sound would have had a breaking strength of 80 tons and concludes that the theoretical strength of the girder was ‘above but only just above’ the Board of Trade requirement (live load x 6 + dead load x 3) (However this appears inconsistent with the figures quoted by the report for dead weight (21 ton shared between 2 girders) and live load (21 ton shared between two girders))The actual strength fell below this because of the casting defect; [...] "The sectional area of the bottom flange would at one place be reduced from 36 (sq) ins to only 28 (sq) ins, thus enormously reducing the strength of the girder" ...|$|E
40|$|LecturePg. 65 - 78 A 16 {{megawatt}} ethylene drive {{steam turbine}} built in 1973 experienced rub related startup vibration problems for many years. The turbine would lock into a rub as it accelerated through the rotor?s {{first critical speed}} causing high vibration and often damage to components. Many possible causes of the rub were identified including casing distortion from bound keys, a steam leak at the horizontal <b>joint</b> <b>flange,</b> and a deteriorated foundations {{after many years of}} operation subjected to high vibration. Finally, the sensitivity of the rotor?s first critical speed was a concern. This paper describes how these problems were attacked in a concerted effort to eliminate the rub-induced vibration.

In order to further optimise the structure design and reduce the weight but without compromising strength, reduction of redundant materials in the <b>joint</b> <b>flange</b> area can be considered. For this reason, the influence of rivet to sheet edge distance on the fatigue strengths of self-piercing riveted joints was studied. Five edge distances, 5 mm, 6 mm, 8 mm, 11. 5 mm and 14. 5 mm, were considered. The results showed that the SPR joints studied in this research had high fatigue resistance and all specimens failed in sheet material along joint buttons or next to rivet heads. For lap shear fatigue tests, specimens failed in the bottom sheet at low load amplitudes and in the top sheet at high load amplitudes except for specimens with very short edge distance of 5 and 6 mm; whereas, for coach-peel fatigue tests, all specimens failed in the top sheet. For both lap shear and coach-peel fatigue tests, specimens with an edge distance of 11. 5 mm had the best fatigue resistance. It was found that for coach-peel fatigue, length of crack developing path before specimens lost their strengths was the main factor that determined the fatigue life of different specimens; for lap shear fatigue, the level of stress concentration and subsequent crack initiation time was the main factor that determined the fatigue life...|$|E

40|$|Downloaded Fsolid {{ferritic}} flanges have cracked purely due to overload; and {{stainless steel}} overlay ferritic flanges have cracked possibly due {{to a combination of}} mechanisms. The stainless steel overlay flanges may be more prone to cracking than solid ferritic flanges due to crack initiation by Cl SCC of the overlay and differential thermal expansion and residual stresses between the stainless steel overlay and the ferritic base metal. Nonetheless, a major factor in crack initiation for all of these cases is the high localized stress at the corners of the ring groove. It has been well documented that the configuration of standard RTJ flanges does not include sufficient radii {{at the base of the}} ring groove to effectively reduce the local-ized peak stresses. Note that the ASME B 16. 5 standard permitted a very sharp corner of essentially zero radius until a recent ad-denda which includes the requirement for larger radii, which should help mitigate cracking, but probably not eliminate it. During routine inspection of a 2 - 1 / 4 Cr- 1 Mo hydrogen process-ing reactor vessel in a petroleum refinery, cracking was identified in the ring <b>joint</b> <b>flange</b> of the inlet nozzle. The cracking was de-tected while the flange connection was in the assembled condition using a new angle beam UT technique. The cracks encompassed approximately 180 deg of circumference and were located at both the inner and outer radius of the flange ring joint groove. The crack depth was 1. 0 in. ~ 25. 4 mm! on the innermost radius of the depths located at the base of the ring joint groove to evaluate the change in the crack tip driving force. Both elastic and elastic-plastic analyses were performed to evaluate the impact of crack tip plasticity in the resulting J-integral calculation. Metallurgical Testing. A small sliver was removed from the cracked flange. A chemistry analysis was performed to assess the potential for temper embrittlement and a microstructural specimen was prepared to examine the microstructure and to perform a mi-crohardness test to assess the potential for hydrogen-assisted crack growth.

The ideal requirement for a bolted <b>flange</b> <b>joint</b> is a 'zero-leak' condition. However, whilst recommended design procedures for bolted <b>flange</b> <b>joints</b> are available in international codes and standards, leakage problems are still faced by industry.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{high-rise}} latticed tower structures {{are made of}} steel tubular members. To facilitate the construction, the tower legs are constructed by connecting the steel tubular members with bolted <b>flange</b> <b>joints.</b> Under the wind load, the bolts of the <b>flange</b> <b>joints</b> may loosen; and this may endanger {{the safety of the}} tower if the bolt looseness and its locations cannot be detected and repaired timely. This paper proposes a new method for identifying the damage locations of bolt looseness of bolted <b>flange</b> <b>joints</b> at tower legs based on the abrupt changes of the structural responses of the towers to the wind load. The bolt looseness is reflected by the reduction of the bending rigidity of elements in the stiffness matrix of the beam element model which is equivalent to the refined solid finite element model of the <b>flange</b> <b>joints.</b> A vector composed of the standardized mean square deviations of the wind-induced longitudinal strain responses at <b>flange</b> <b>joints</b> in a damaged state of the tower related to those in its undamaged state is used as a damage index. It has been shown that the damage index is sensitive to the damage locations but independent of the wind load. Hence. the damage index can be used to identify the damage locations of the bolt looseness at the <b>flange</b> <b>joints.</b> Finally, the proposed method is applied to a latticed steel tubular tower, which shows that the proposed method can accurately identify the damage locations of bolt looseness.

40|$|Purpose: The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to {{describe}} the modelling of large flexible objects in which bolted joints are used and also to present a new FEM calculation methodology of these objects. Design/methodology/approach: In bolted <b>flange</b> <b>joints</b> of flexible constructional elements, bolts are subject not only to tension and torsion but also to bending. Identification of straining of each bolt is only possible by means of numerical methods e. g. the finite element method FEM. In case of large objects, the calculation problem is faithful projection of the phenomena taking place in direct zone of the contact of screw-nut pair. The application of global equivalent models of the whole joint is necessary, to make it possible to precisely determine internal loads in individual bolts and then local models to determine stress fields necessary to assign durability. Calculation methodology based on the construction of two coherent models has been described: global - of an entire <b>flange</b> <b>joint,</b> and local - of a single bolt joint. Findings: The elaborated methodology was applied to estimate the <b>flange</b> <b>joint</b> in the heat exchanger with rotating heating surfaces that was subject to damage. The causes of damage of <b>flange</b> <b>joint</b> were found.

Polyvinyl Chloride bolted <b>flange</b> <b>joints</b> undergo relaxation under compression for which the creep properties are different from those under tension.
