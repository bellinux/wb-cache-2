5|$|Regional airports, such as Edinburgh Airport, have {{experienced}} strong growth in CAT operations in recent years. These operations are commercially and operationally incompatible with GA, {{and although there}} is no evidence of deliberate discrimination, the effect has been to discourage or exclude it. GA aircraft are being subject to significant increases in charges, including the imposition of <b>handling</b> <b>fees</b> in some cases. Some airports restrict or deny GA parking, and others limit or refuse certain GA activity. As a result, light GA aircraft are now rarely or never seen at large, busy international airports such as Heathrow, Stansted, Gatwick and Manchester.|$|E
5|$|Terminal 4 – {{originally}} {{called the}} Domestic Express or South Terminal – {{is dedicated to}} budget airlines and is the first facility of its kind at a conventional airport in Australia. It was originally constructed for Virgin Blue (Virgin Australia) and Impulse Airlines. Virgin Blue eventually moved into Terminal 3 following the demise of Ansett. A$5million refit began in June 2007 {{along the lines of}} the budget terminal model at Singapore Changi Airport and Kuala Lumpur International Airport. Lower landing and airport <b>handling</b> <b>fees</b> are charged to airlines due to the basic facilities, lack of jet bridges, and fewer amenities and retail outlets compared to a conventional terminal. However, the terminal is located next to the main terminal building, unlike in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur. The terminal was rebuilt by Tiger Airways Australia, which has used it as its main hub since it operated its first domestic flight on 23 November 2007.|$|E
25|$|Netflix {{introduced}} the monthly subscription concept in September 1999, and then dropped the single-rental model in early 2000. Since that time, {{the company has}} built its reputation on the business model of flat-fee unlimited rentals without due dates, late fees, shipping and <b>handling</b> <b>fees,</b> or per-title rental fees.|$|E

25|$|To ensure {{every single}} {{operation}} showed a clear profit {{on a full}} costing basis, i.e. inclusive of all overhead costs, the company required each operation to be budgeted in detail before deciding whether to accept it. The managing director's authorisation was required to dispense with this rule in exceptional cases where the risk of accepting a contract that was only marginally profitable, i.e. excluding overheads, was outweighed by {{the risk of having}} an aircraft sit idly on the ground. An immediate financial analysis that compared actual costs and revenues with their budgets followed the completion of each flight, thereby instantly gauging that flight's profitability and validating the effectiveness of the firm's pricing policy. A policy of requiring aircraft commanders to pay for all operating expenses other than fuel in cash proved to be an effective method to exercise instant cost control over fees and charges incurred for products and services supplied by third parties, such as ground <b>handling</b> <b>fees,</b> technical support services and catering supplies.|$|E
500|$|Jackson called {{attention}} to American Airlines' newly imposed luggage <b>handling</b> <b>fees</b> for even the first checked bag. [...] She claimed that the fees were contrary to Section 26-04 of the Airport Use Agreement with the City of Chicago, which is the contract that permits American Airlines to be a carrier in Chicago airports. [...] The initial plan exempted Platinum and Executive card holders who were generally business travelers and placed an inordinate burden of new fees on the common traveler in contravention of the non-discriminatory price agreement in the agreement. She expressed interest in a City Council forum on the issue. [...] She wrote directly to American Airlines and then wrote {{an article in the}} Chicago Sun-Times on the issue.|$|E
2500|$|PayPal froze the {{donation}} account, then {{stated that they}} would unfreeze the account once it was provided with proof of shipping from aggrieved buyers. Due {{to the nature of}} the collection, there were no actual [...] "buyers", and it was impossible to provide proof of shipping for donation. Eventually, Kyanka contacted a customer service representative over the phone, and asked to have PayPal donate all of the money to the Red Cross. However, he was told that PayPal would only give the money to United Way of America due to their business affiliation; Kyanka initially agreed, but after receiving several emails from readers detailing alleged corruption and inefficiency within United Way, he changed his mind and told PayPal to refund all of the money to the individual donors. PayPal refunded the money, but did not refund exchange and <b>handling</b> <b>fees</b> for international donors.|$|E

2500|$|Promotional toys {{can fall}} {{into any of}} the other toy categories; for example they can be dolls or action figures based on the {{characters}} of movies or professional athletes, or they can be balls, yo-yos, and lunch boxes with logos on them. Sometimes they are given away for free as a form of advertising. Model aircraft are often toys that are used by airlines to promote their brand, just as toy cars and trucks and model trains are used by trucking, railroad and other companies as well. Many food manufacturers run promotions where a toy is included with the main product as a prize. Toys are also used as premiums, where consumers redeem proofs of purchase from a product and pay shipping and <b>handling</b> <b>fees</b> to get the toy. [...] Some people {{go to great lengths to}} collect these sorts of promotional toys.|$|E
2500|$|The {{idea for}} the Bundle was from Jeff Rosen of Wolfire Games. Rosen {{describes}} the inspiration coming to him through similar sales of bundle packages on the Steam platform. Rosen had noted that such sales would have viral word-of-mouth spread across the Internet. Influence also came from a previous [...] "pay-what-you-want" [...] sale for World of Goo upon the title's first anniversary; over 57,000 copies of the game were purchased during this sale, generating over US$117,000 after considering PayPal <b>handling</b> <b>fees.</b> Rosen by this point was well connected with other independent developers, for example his brother David is listed as being a game tester for the Penumbra series, and Penumbra composer Mikko Tarmia is now contributing to Wolfire Games' upcoming game project Overgrowth. Wolfire had also recently teamed with Unknown Worlds Entertainment to offer a bundle based on their Natural Selection 2 game. The porter of Lugaru to Linux was Ryan C. Gordon, who was also responsible for porting Aquaria to Linux. With his close ties to these independent developers, as well as Ron Carmel of 2D Boy, Rosen was able to assemble the package, taking advantage of merchant sales systems offered by PayPal, Amazon Payments, and Google Checkout to minimize the cost of transactions and distribution. The site later added the option to pay via Bitcoin only through Coinbase.|$|E

5000|$|It {{was found}} that The Point - a social {{initiatives}} platform whose name was inspired by Malcolm Gladwell's The Tipping Point - was too abstract to market, and it was stripped down to the Groupon concept, a website that sells deals to local businesses.

5000|$|Consumer Reports' 2007 {{review is}} that [...] "the lack of price {{transparency}} {{makes it hard}} to evaluate whether you’ll save by joining DirectBuy.

DirectBuy might save you money if you’re furnishing a house from scratch or doing a major renovation" [...] but cautioned its readers that [...] "since you can’t shop around beforehand, you’ll be joining blind." [...] Prices for items such as electronics are higher than available from online retailers; the [...] "deep discounts" [...] were found on flooring and high-end furniture. Customers cannot return items, cancel orders, or terminate their membership. An 8% <b>handling</b> <b>fee,</b> shipping fees, and tax are added to the cost of items purchased.

For example, the current shipping reimbursement for any DVD sent USPS Media Mail is $2.39. On the other hand, the reimbursement amount may exceed the actual shipping costs. In this case, many sellers will offer a [...] "free upgrade" [...] to first class shipping, which is not much more expensive than media mail for small items such as CDs.|$|R
