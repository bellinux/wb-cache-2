5|$|Throughout the 1950s, {{the most}} popular <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>country</b> music was the Nashville Sound, which was a slick and pop-oriented style. Many musicians {{preferred}} a rougher sound, leading {{to the development of}} the Lubbock Sound and Bakersfield Sound. The Bakersfield Sound was innovated in Bakersfield, California in the mid to late 1950s, by performers like Wynn Stewart, who used elements of Western swing and rock, such as the breakbeat, along with a honky tonk vocal style. He was followed by a wave of performers like Buck Owens and Merle Haggard, who popularized the style.|$|E
5|$|The Nashville {{sound was}} a popular <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>country</b> music that arose in the 1950s, a fusion of popular big band jazz and swing with the lyricism of honky-tonk country. The popular success of Hank Williams' {{recordings}} had convinced record labels that country music could find mainstream audiences. Record companies then tried to strip the rough, honky-tonk elements from country music, removing the unapologetically rural sound that had made Williams famous. Nashville's industry was reacting {{to the rise of}} rockabilly performer Elvis Presley by marketing performers that crossed the divide between country and pop. Chet Atkins, head of RCA's country music division, did the most to innovate the Nashville sound by abandoning the rougher elements of country, while Owen Bradley used sophisticated production techniques and smooth instrumentation that eventually became standard in the Nashville Sound, which also grew to incorporate strings and vocal choirs. By {{the early part of the}} 1960s, the Nashville sound was perceived as watered-down by many more traditionalist performers and fans, resulting in a number of local scenes like the Lubbock sound and, most influentially, the Bakersfield sound.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this essay is to review the Swedish {{international}} development cooperation carried out by Sida to control whether {{the implementation of the}} international aid is compatible with the policy. There {{are a lot of different}} ways to implement the economic aid that are being used by the donors today. The Swedish method has since the 1960 s mainly been focused on attempting to diminish the poverty in the world. In the latest time another goal has been added, that is a focus on supporting the civil rights. This essay will be concentrated to aim on what <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>countries</b> receiving aid from Sweden, and exactly why these countries are being chosen. The main question of this essay is: What countries are receiving the international developing aid, and how can this distribution be understood? To answer the main question there are two themes in the essay: • What <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>countries</b> is supposed to receive developing aid from Sweden according to the policy? • What <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>countries</b> is receiving the aid, and how can this be understood? This essay is mainly based on quantitative data obtained from Sida, together with index of corruption and poverty will the different types <b>of</b> Swedish cooperation <b>countries</b> be described. The conclusions of this essay are that there are two objectives of the policy: to fight poverty, and to strengthen the civil rights. What is noticeable in this essay is that it seems like there are more recipient of the aid from Sida that are relatively wealthy than there are poor. Still, it is obvious that the poor countries recieve a bigger amount of aid than the wealthy countries do. It is in other words difficult to declare which objective that is the superior on...|$|R

500|$|In 1985, McEntire {{released}} her third MCA album, Have I Got a Deal for You, which {{followed the same}} traditional format as My <b>Kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>Country.</b> It was the first album produced by McEntire and was co-produced with Jimmy Bowen. Like her previous release, the album received positive feedback, including Rolling Stone, which called it a [...] "promising debut". The album's second single, [...] "Only in My Mind" [...] was entirely written by McEntire and reached No. 5 on the Billboard country chart. On January 17, 1986, McEntire {{became a member of}} the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, Tennessee, and has been a member ever since. In February 1986, McEntire's ninth studio album, Whoever's in New England was released. For this album, McEntire and co-producer Jimmy Bowen incorporated her traditional music style into a mainstream sound that was entirely different from anything she had previously recorded. Country Music: The Rough Guide called the production of the title track, [...] "bigger and sentimentalism more obvious, even manipulative". The title track peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard Country Chart and won her a Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance the following year. In addition, the album became McEntire's first release to certify gold in sales by the Recording Industry Association of America (and was later certified Platinum). At the end of the year, McEntire won Entertainer of the Year from the Country Music Association, the highest honor in the awards show.|$|E
500|$|McEntire {{signed with}} MCA Nashville Records in 1984 and {{released}} her seventh studio album, Just a Little Love. Harold Shedd was originally the album's producer; however, McEntire rejected his suggestions towards country pop arrangements. It was instead produced by Norro Wilson, although the album {{still had a}} distinguishable country pop sound. Dissatisfied with the album's sound, she went to MCA president, Jimmy Bowen, who told McEntire to find material that was best-suited to her liking. Instead of finding new material, she found previously recorded country hits from her own record collection, which was then recorded for the album. The album's material included songs originally released as singles by Ray Price ("Don't You Believe Her", [...] "I Want to Hear It from You"), Carl Smith ("Before I Met You"), Faron Young ("He's Only Everything") and Connie Smith ("You've Got Me [...] ). The album spawned two number-one singles: [...] "How Blue" [...] and [...] "Somebody Should Leave". It was given positive reviews from critics, with Billboard praising McEntire as [...] "the finest woman country singer since Kitty Wells" [...] and Rolling Stone critics honoring her {{as one of their}} Top 5 favorite country artists. Upon its release, My <b>Kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>Country</b> became her highest-peaking album on the Top Country Albums chart, reaching No. 13. The album also included instruments such as a fiddle and pedal steel guitar, and was aimed more towards a traditional country sound. McEntire was later praised as a [...] "new traditionalist", along with Ricky Skaggs, George Strait, and Randy Travis. That year, she won the Country Music Association Awards' Female Vocalist of the Year, her first major industry award. The album was certified Gold.|$|E

However, conversely in mathematics and in science, these results in reading are based on surveys conducted by two agencies with different definitions of the target population (age- versus grade-based sample). With PIRLS 2006 and PISA 2009 data, we compared gender variability and differences at the extreme tails for the whole samples and for sub-samples of expected age and grade. From this analysis, we conclude that the population definition does not explain the large difference between IEA and PISA in reading. Analyses available on request show also that the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>countries</b> (industrialized countries versus developing countries) involved in the surveys did not influence the proportion <b>of</b> <b>countries</b> where males’ variance ratios are significantly larger than females’.
