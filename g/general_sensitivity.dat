50|$|Individual {{sensitivity}} to punishment {{is at the}} core of neuroticism. Numerous findings show that neuroticism is related to the tendency to experience negative affect at work and other social environments. Neurotic individuals exhibit irritability, anxiety, impulsiveness, and self-consciousness that seems to underlie a <b>general</b> <b>sensitivity</b> to threat and punishment. The authors of the NEO-PI-R indicate that poor emotion regulation, low self-esteem, and excessive rumination are common among neurotic individuals.|$|E
40|$|Graduate Student Presentations 2 Whether L 1 and L 2 are {{processed}} {{by one or}} two systems has been a focus of debate for many years. The current study examines this issue by investigating the possibility of cross-language prosodic transfer among Cantonese-English bilinguals. Also, the underlying pathways or theoretical accounts, namely the acoustic and linguistic hypotheses for prosodic transfer have been tested. A total of 27 Cantonese-English bilingual and 27 English monolingual second and third graders have been evaluated for their Cantonese lexical tone sensitivity, English lexical stress <b>sensitivity,</b> <b>general</b> auditory <b>sensitivity</b> and working memory. Independent t-tests revealed that the two groups performed equally well on English stress perception, general auditory processing and working memory. Correlational analysis revealed an association between Cantonese lexical tone and English lexical stress sensitivities even after controlling for <b>general</b> auditory <b>sensitivity.</b> <b>General</b> auditory <b>sensitivity,</b> however, showed no significant correlation with either Cantonese lexical tone or English lexical stress sensitivity. The results suggest the occurrence of prosodic transfer among tone and stress, implying that L 1 tone and L 2 stress are not processed by completely separate systems. Furthermore, collective evidences suggest that the prosodic transfer is mediated by their linguistic but not acoustic features, {{which is consistent with}} the linguistic hypothesis regarding the underlying pathway for prosodic transfer. In addition, collective evidences implied the role of prosodic transfer in helping bilinguals achieve native-like L 2 stress perception. Our findings regarding prosodic transfer not only inform the bilingual research field the importance of suprasegmental perception, but also lend our support to the holistic view of a classic and ongoing debate about “one system or two”...|$|R

50|$|In vertebrates, opiates {{modulate}} nociception and {{opioid receptor}} antagonists, e.g. naloxone and CTOP, reverse this effect. So, if opiates have similar effects in invertebrates as vertebrates, they should delay or reduce any protective response and the opioid antagonist should counteract this. It {{has been found}} that molluscs and insects have opioid binding sites or opioid <b>general</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> Certainly there are many examples of neuropeptides involved in vertebrate pain responses being found in invertebrates; for example, endorphins have been found in platyhelminthes, molluscs, annelids, crustaceans and insects. It should be noted, however, that apart from analgesia, there are other effects of exogenous opiates specifically being involved in feeding behaviour and activation of immunocytes. These latter functions might explain the presence of opioids and opioid receptors in extremely simple invertebrates and unicellular animals.|$|E

Maternal mind-mindedness was greater in mothers who had breast-fed compared to formula-fed.

40|$|Abstract While the {{importance}} of phonological sensitivity for understanding reading acquisition and impairment across orthographies is well documented, what underlies deficits in phonological sensitivity is not well understood. Some researchers have argued that speech perception underlies variability in phonological representations. Others have investigated the role of more <b>general</b> auditory <b>sensitivity</b> for reading development and reading difficulties, arguing that poor phonological representations may actually be due to broad underlying auditory deficits, which are not restricted to speech stimuli. We argue that these hypotheses are not necessarily mutually exclusive. In this review, we demonstrate that auditory sensitivity and speech perception can be integrated into a single developmental model, in which auditory sensitivity may have an indirect impact on reading; this impact is mediated by speech perception. In the model, we distinguish <b>general</b> auditory <b>sensitivity</b> as falling into at least two general categories: rhythmic and temporal. Correspondingly, speech perception itself can be distinguished as suprasegmental and segmental. Theoretically, the proposed model integrates {{a broad range of}} studies on general auditory and speech perception to suggest a developmental trajectory for reading acquisition that can b...|$|R
