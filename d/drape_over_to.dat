5000|$|A tent [...] is {{a shelter}} {{consisting}} of sheets of fabric or other material <b>draped</b> <b>over,</b> attached <b>to</b> {{a frame of}} poles or attached to a supporting rope. While smaller tents may be free-standing or attached to the ground, large tents are usually anchored using guy ropes tied to stakes or tent pegs. First used as portable homes by nomadic peoples, tents are now more often used for recreational camping and temporary shelters.|$|R

Her hands lay on her lap. She is wearing a long striped dress with puffy sleeves. A silk(?) scarf is tied about her long dark hair in back (not visible) and <b>drapes</b> <b>over</b> her {{shoulders}} <b>to</b> her chest. She is looking slightly to her left.

50|$|Sometimes, weights are <b>draped</b> <b>over</b> or tied <b>to</b> the neck. As {{weighted}} vests {{often have}} weight placed here, they effectively {{have the same}} benefits. Advantages to neck weights and more upper-body-centric weighted vests is that they allow easier spinal flexion (contracting abdominals or stretching extensor spinae) and extension (contracting extensor spinae, stretching abdominals). This makes them prime for adding resistance to these movements, and takes out the requirement of using the arms to anchor weight to the upper body to add resistance.|$|R
5000|$|The common {{ingredients}} for early recipes are cream, rosewater and sugar, whipped until stiff. Other flavouring agents, e.g., cloves or ginger, are also known from various recipes. It {{is the process}} of whipping cream until stiff that is often likened to snow {{as can be seen in}} passages such as [...] "Beat your cream with a stick until the Snow rises ...". It was often <b>draped</b> <b>over</b> another item <b>to</b> give the appearance of snow having fallen over the item.|$|R
50|$|Advances in the {{prosecution}} of sieges encouraged {{the development of a}} variety of defensive counter-measures. In particular, Medieval fortifications became progressively stronger - for example, the advent of the concentric castle from the period of the Crusades - and more dangerous to attackers - witness the increasing use of machicolations and murder-holes, as well the preparation of hot or incendiary substances. Arrow slits, concealed doors for sallies, and deep water wells were also integral to resisting siege at this time. Designers of castles paid particular attention to defending entrances, protecting gates with drawbridges, portcullises and barbicans. Wet animal skins were often <b>draped</b> <b>over</b> gates <b>to</b> repel fire. Moats and other water defenses, whether natural or augmented, were also vital to defenders.|$|R
30|$|The rough patches could {{represent}} either wet mudflats or {{the development of}} waves on the sea surface. Because such mudflats would need {{a thin layer of}} liquid <b>draped</b> <b>over</b> rough mud <b>to</b> be consistent <b>over</b> areas tens of kilometers across, we prefer the waves interpretation. Future observations could definitively differentiate between the two ideas: if the regions are consistently rough as a function of time, then they are likely mudflats, whereas if the rough areas are different on a future flyby then that observation would be more consistent with waves.|$|R
40|$|This {{online course}} {{systematically}} divides Idaho geology into 15 individual teaching modules which correspond with a two-credit, 15 -week classroom course. Each module covers a specific area or type of geology {{in the state}} of Idaho. Topics include geology of basement rocks, rocks and geology of the Belt Supergroup, tectonic regimes, and geologic history. There are also modules on rocks and geology of the Idaho Batholith, volcanic history and deposits of the Snake River Plain and Columbia Plateau, and Pleistocene glaciation and floods from Lakes Missoula and Bonneville. Each of the modules provides geologic maps from a recently developed Geologic Map of Idaho, produced by the Idaho Geological Survey, and most also feature fly-throughs in which geologic information is <b>draped</b> <b>over</b> topography <b>to</b> provide visualizations of the geology along Idaho rivers.

40|$|The {{orientation}} of the local interstellar magnetic field introduces asymmetries in the heliosphere that affect the location of heliospheric radio emissions and the streaming direction of ions from the termination shock of the solar wind. We combine observations of radio emissions and energetic particle streaming with extensive 3 D MHD computer simulations of magnetic field <b>draping</b> <b>over</b> the heliopause <b>to</b> show that {{the plane of the}} local interstellar field is ~ 60 - 90 degrees from the galactic plane. This suggests that the field orientation in the Local Interstellar Cloud differs from that of a larger scale interstellar magnetic field thought to parallel the galactic plane...|$|R
50|$|On {{the first}} night, Friday, of the festivities the Mikoshi and about 40 Kiriko {{make their way}} through the streets of Ushitsu (a village inside of Noto Town) and finally gather in front of the city hall to weave around large bonfires resting on the top of large poles. Groups of men (and rarely women) work {{together}} to carry the large wooden Kiriko while children sit atop it playing drums and flutes. The men often carry the Kiriko so close to the suspended bonfires that they suffer minor or major burns from the falling sparks. The children usually wear wet towels <b>draped</b> <b>over</b> their heads <b>to</b> protect them from the sparks.|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} between the solar wind and the outflowing plasmas from a comet has been studied by using a two-dimensional time-dependent magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation. The model reproduced several features of the comet-solar wind interaction predicted by earlier theories and observed on the recent cometary probes. These include {{the formation of the}} contact surface and the cometary magnetotail. For a constant interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) the cometary plasma captures field lines which <b>drape</b> <b>over</b> the comet <b>to</b> form an antiparallel magnetic field configuration in the tail and a thin plasma sheet. Eventually, tail magnetic reconnection begins to occur at several points. When the IMF orientation is reversed dayside magnetic reconnection occurs at the subsolar point and a large disturbance propagation down the tail...|$|R
5000|$|A vigil is {{held that}} lasts four days. In that time, Zach is freed from jail with no charges, and black cloth is <b>draped</b> <b>over</b> the {{beehives}} <b>to</b> symbolize the mourning. May's suicide letter is found {{and in it}} she says, [...] "It's my time to die, and it's your time to live. Don't mess it up." [...] August interprets this as urging June to marry Neil. May is later buried. Life begins to turn back to normal after a time of grieving, bringing the Boatwright house back together. June, after several rejections, agrees to give her hand in marriage to Neil. Zach vows to Lily {{that they will be}} together someday and that they will both achieve their goals.|$|R
5000|$|For centuries, European {{women have}} worn sheer veils, but only under certain circumstances. Sometimes {{a veil of}} this type was <b>draped</b> <b>over</b> and pinned <b>to</b> the bonnet or hat {{of a woman in}} mourning, {{especially}} at the funeral and during the subsequent period of [...] "high mourning". They would also have been used, as an alternative to a mask, as a simple method of hiding the identity of a woman who was traveling to meet a lover, or doing anything she didn't want other people to find out about. More pragmatically, veils were also sometimes worn to protect the complexion from sun and wind damage (when un-tanned skin was fashionable), or to keep dust out of a woman's face, much as the keffiyeh is used today.|$|R
40|$|Advances in {{material}} technology have given carbon fiber composites a high strength and stiffness to weight ratios, making them an attractive resource for industry. However, manufacturing parts from sheets of composite laminate is difficult. A forming machine must prevent the laminates from <b>draping</b> <b>over</b> the tool <b>to</b> prevent thickness variations and supply the tensile and shear forces during forming to prevent part wrinkling. The machine must also {{allow for the}} easy loading of laminates and removal of formed parts. There are several methods of diaphragm forming in use, the most promising of which is inflated tool forming. Inflated tool forming relies on a diaphragm inflated around the tool to support the laminate during loading and apply forces during forming. Currently this process does not perform up to the industry's expectations. It may be improved by taking greater control over the diaphragm inflated around the tool. Three methods of diaphragm control were explored through experimentation: inflating multiple diaphragms, using dense fluid to inflate the diaphragm, an...|$|R
5000|$|Zoo City {{was awarded}} the 2011 Arthur C. Clarke Award on 28 April 2011. This award {{is given to the}} best science fiction novel first {{published}} in the United Kingdom during the previous year, and is considered the most prestigious British science fiction award. Beukes wore a fake sloth <b>draped</b> <b>over</b> her shoulders <b>to</b> the award ceremony in London, mimicking Zinzi December's animal familiar. The cover of the 2010 British edition of the book, which was designed by Joey Hi-Fi, won the 2010 BSFA Award on 26 April 2011 for best artwork. The book itself was shortlisted in the best novel category of this award, but lost out to Ian McDonald's book The Dervish House, which at the time was considered the favourite for the Arthur C. Clarke Award. The book had previously received the 2010 Kitschies Red Tentacle award for best novel, as the book that [...] "best elevates the tone of geek culture".|$|R

40|$|The Gallery of Virtual Topography {{features}} virtual {{depictions of}} topography, including 3 D perspectives and QuickTime Virtual Reality (QTVR) movies, created from Digital Elevation Models (DEM's). The site showcases QTVR object movies where the user can spin a 3 D terrain {{to view it}} from different perspectives. It also includes static 3 D-perspective images (JPEG files) of the 3 D terrains for those users with slower Internet connections. Some movies and images depict only {{the form of the}} landscape, but in others topographic contours are <b>draped</b> <b>over</b> the landscape <b>to</b> better illustrate how contours portray different types of topography (cliffs versus badlands, for example). Some animations illustrate the significance of contours, by allowing the user to progressively fill the landscape up with water to see the water interact with different topographic features. The site also contains a topographic contour map for each 3 D terrain, so that instructors can develop student exercises, such as locating points on a map and constructing topographic profiles. Some QTVR movies contain numbered topographic features just for this purpose. Educational levels: Graduate or professional, Undergraduate upper division...|$|R
