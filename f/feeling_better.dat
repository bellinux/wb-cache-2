On 25 November 1784, he allowed Burney to visit him and expressed an interest to her that he should leave London; he soon left for Islington, to George Strahan's home.

500|$|Originally, Kirkland was {{supposed}} to be the sole director for the episode, however, at the time, he was going through a divorce that he [...] "did not see coming". Because of this, Kirkland assigned his assistant director, Matthew Nastuk, to direct the episode in his stead. However, after having directed a scene, Nastuk claimed that he was [...] "terrified" [...] and wanted Kirkland to continue the direction. Kirkland returned to direct the episode, <b>feeling</b> <b>better</b> after getting over the divorce. Despite the circumstances, Kirkland stated that he [...] "loved" [...] working on the episode, and could relate to the story since he had grown up in a [...] "sort of hippie commune school" [...] in the late '60s and early '70s.

500|$|... "Blood Feud" [...] {{was written}} by George Meyer and {{directed}} by David Silverman. Executive producer Sam Simon and writers Al Jean and Mike Reiss {{came up with the}} idea for the episode while they were trying to fill up the rest of the production run. A co-worker had recently needed a blood transfusion, and the writers thought it would be funny if Mr. Burns had one. Although Meyer was credited with writing the episode, Jean and Reiss re-wrote and polished the script. Harry Shearer, the voice of Mr. Burns and Smithers, could not attend the table read for the episode, so his parts were read by Dan Castellaneta (the voice of Homer). [...] "Blood Feud" [...] includes a first act that is much longer than a normal episode of the show. The producers were going to end the act with Mr. Burns <b>feeling</b> <b>better,</b> but decided to extend it to show how the Simpson family was affected. [...] "Blood Feud" [...] ends with the family discussing what the message of the episode was, but decide that there was no message. The writers were having trouble conceiving an ending, but decided that since there was no point, they would discuss it. In his book Planet Simpson, Chris Turner writes that the ending is meant to openly mock the [...] "notion of the tidy sitcom-style moral" [...] and the [...] "formulaic plots of sitcoms".|$|E
