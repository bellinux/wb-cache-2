5|$|Honeyeaters {{are clearly}} the most {{important}} pollination vector, as inflorescences from which honeyeaters are excluded generally do not set any fruit. Moreover, honeyeaters have been observed moving <b>from</b> <b>tree</b> <b>to</b> <b>tree</b> with significant loads of B.sessilis pollen on their foreheads, beaks and throats, having acquired it by brushing against pollen presenters while foraging for nectar; experiments have shown that some of this pollen may be subsequently deposited on stigmas during later foraging.|$|E
5|$|Slow lorises are {{threatened}} by deforestation and the wildlife trade, which includes the exotic pet trade, traditional medicine, and bushmeat. Other threats includes road construction, selective logging, and slash and burn agriculture. Habitat fragmentation obstructs biological dispersal for these species that rely on vines and lianas to move <b>from</b> <b>tree</b> <b>to</b> <b>tree.</b> Consequently, slow lorises are found dead on power lines or are victims of roadkill in areas where roads cut between forest patches.|$|E
5|$|Insects {{and other}} {{invertebrates}} {{are a major}} portion of the nuthatch diet, especially during the breeding season, when they rely almost exclusively on live prey, but most species also eat seeds during the winter, when invertebrates are less readily available. Larger food items, such as big insects, snails, acorns or seeds may be wedged into cracks and pounded with the bird's strong bill. Unusually for a bird, the brown-headed nuthatch uses a piece of tree bark as a lever to pry up other bark flakes to look for food; the bark tool may then be carried <b>from</b> <b>tree</b> <b>to</b> <b>tree</b> or used to cover a seed cache.|$|E

5000|$|Brachiators are {{a type of}} primate {{mostly from}} the family Hylobatidae, which {{includes}} gibbons. Brachiators use their arms <b>to</b> move <b>from</b> <b>tree</b> branch <b>to</b> <b>tree</b> branch, through a process called brachiation. Their arms are longer than their legs, and are much more powerful.|$|R
5|$|Ruffed lemurs are {{considered}} arboreal quadrupeds, {{with the most}} common type of movement being above-branch quadrupedalism. While in the canopy leaping, vertical clinging, and suspensory behavior, are also common, while bridging, bimanual movement, and bipedalism are infrequently seen. When moving <b>from</b> <b>tree</b> <b>to</b> <b>tree,</b> ruffed lemurs will look over the shoulder while clinging, launch themselves into the air, and twist mid-air so that their ventral surface lands on the new tree or limb. Suspensory behavior is more common in ruffed lemurs than in other lemur species. When ruffed lemurs come down to the ground, they continue to move quadrupedally, running with bounding hops and the tail held high.|$|E
5|$|Saprotrophic wood-decay fungi are {{the primary}} cause of {{decomposition}} of wood, causing billions of dollars of economic damage each year. Fungal decay, while useful in composting, is destructive of timber exposed to the weather, {{and in the case of}} dry rot caused by Serpula lacrymans, also of timbers in largely dry houses. Some wood-decay fungi such as the honey fungi, species of Armillaria, are parasites of living trees, attacking their roots and eventually killing them, and continuing to decompose the wood when they are dead. Honey fungus is a serious horticultural pest, as it can spread <b>from</b> <b>tree</b> <b>to</b> <b>tree</b> by long strap-shaped rhizomorphs in the soil.|$|E
5|$|Scaly-tailed {{squirrels}} {{and flying}} squirrels, although not closely related, can both glide <b>from</b> <b>tree</b> <b>to</b> <b>tree</b> using parachute-like membranes that stretch from the fore to the hind limbs. The agouti is fleet-footed and antelope-like, being digitigrade and having hoof-like nails. The majority of rodents have tails, {{which can be}} of many shapes and sizes. Some tails are prehensile, as in the Eurasian harvest mouse, and the fur on the tails can vary from bushy to completely bald. The tail is sometimes used for communication, as when beavers slap their tails on the water surface or house mice rattle their tails to indicate alarm. Some species have vestigial tails or no tails at all. In some species, the tail is capable of regeneration if a part is broken off.|$|E
50|$|The Kleene-Brouwer order generalizes {{the notion}} of a {{postorder}} traversal <b>from</b> finite <b>trees</b> <b>to</b> <b>trees</b> that are not necessarily finite. For trees over a well-ordered set, the Kleene-Brouwer order is itself a well-ordering if and only if the tree has no infinite branch. It is named after Stephen Cole Kleene, Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer, Nikolai Luzin, and Wacław Sierpiński.|$|R

5|$|The Lānai hookbill is {{only known}} to have eaten {{the fruit of the}} ōpuhe. The type {{specimen}} was caught while feeding on the plant, and its berries were subsequently discovered in its stomach. It is considered likely that the hookbill additionally ate akoko fruits due to their similarity in size and shape to those of the ōpuhe. However, the hookbill's unique bill is considered unlikely to have evolved if the species was purely frugivorous, and {{it has been suggested that}} the hookbill specialized in eating snails. The species was very active while searching for food, constantly flying <b>from</b> <b>tree</b> <b>to</b> <b>tree.</b> While perched it shifted restlessly.|$|E
5|$|For some years, {{the cause}} of the disease was unknown, and {{hypotheses}} included tree ageing, fungi, viruses, and environmental factors such as an increase in ultra-violet light. Another hypothesis was that a genetic problem may have been induced in Northland and Auckland by the thousands of cabbage trees brought into the area from elsewhere and planted in gardens and parks. The Lands and Survey Department had a native plant nursery at Taupo in the central North Island, which was used to grow plants for use in parks, reserves and carparks. In many Northland parks, cabbage trees from the central North Island were growing and flowering within metres of natural forms. Any offspring produced might have been poorly adapted to local conditions. After nearly five years of work, scientists found the cause was a bacterium Phytoplasma australiense, which may be spread <b>from</b> <b>tree</b> <b>to</b> <b>tree</b> by a tiny sap-sucking insect, the introduced passion vine hopper.|$|E
5|$|Prey is {{obtained}} by hunting {{either on the}} ground or in the trees. During the non-breeding season the fossa hunts individually, but during the breeding season hunting parties may be seen, and these may be pairs or later on mothers and young. One member of the group scales a tree and chases the lemurs <b>from</b> <b>tree</b> <b>to</b> <b>tree,</b> forcing them down to the ground where the other is easily able to capture them. The fossa is known to eviscerate its larger lemur prey, a trait that, along with its distinct scat, helps identify its kills. Long-term observations of the fossa's predation patterns on rainforest sifakas suggest that the fossa hunts in a subsection of their range until prey density is decreased, then moves on. The fossa has been reported to prey on domestic animals, such as goats and small calves, and especially chickens. Food taken in captivity includes amphibians, birds, insects, reptiles, and small- to medium-sized mammals.|$|E

25|$|Chrysopelea ornata, {{like others}} of its genus, glides or parachutes. This is presumably done to cover {{distances}} faster, to escape predators, to catch prey, or {{to move around}} in forests.

25|$|While gliding occurs {{independently}} from powered flight, it {{has some}} ecological advantages of its own. Gliding is a very energy-efficient way of travelling <b>from</b> <b>tree</b> <b>to</b> <b>tree.</b> An argument made is that many gliding animals eat low energy foods such as leaves and are restricted to gliding because of this, whereas flying animals eat more high energy foods such as fruits, nectar, and insects. In contrast to flight, gliding has evolved independently many times (more than a dozen times among extant vertebrates), however these groups have not radiated {{nearly as much as}} have groups of flying animals.|$|E

50|$|The {{arboreal}} {{lifestyle of}} P. edwardsi demands high coordination, a well-developed grip, and considerable acrobatics. This lemur moves by vertical clinging and leaping, meaning it maintains an upright position leaping <b>from</b> <b>tree</b> trunk <b>to</b> <b>tree</b> trunk and moving along branches. It leaping between trees, the Milne-Edwards' sifaka performs a 180 degree twist in midair {{so that it}} is facing the incoming landing target. Primarily movements of the arms but also those of the tail are used to adjust the body's rotation and stability on the fly. When landing, the Milne-Edwards' sifaka swings its tail and outstretched forearms downward to help keep the body forward much like a long-jumper. It hands hind legs first. The tail and one arm is flung forward turing takeoff.|$|R

25|$|A {{number of}} animals have evolved aerial locomotion, either by powered flight or by gliding. Flying and gliding animals (volant animals) have evolved {{separately}} many times, without any single ancestor. Flight has evolved at least four times, in the insects, pterosaurs, birds, and bats. Gliding has evolved on many more occasions. Usually the development is to aid canopy animals in getting <b>from</b> <b>tree</b> <b>to</b> <b>tree,</b> although there are other possibilities. Gliding, in particular, has evolved among rainforest animals, especially in the rainforests in Asia (most especially Borneo) where the trees are tall and widely spaced. Several species of aquatic animals, and a few amphibians have also evolved to acquire this gliding flight ability, typically {{as a means of}} evading predators.|$|E
25|$|On February 19, 2008, a university-hired {{contractor}} {{climbed the}} oaks and began removing items that could {{fall from the}} trees, {{as well as the}} ropes used to climb <b>from</b> <b>tree</b> <b>to</b> <b>tree</b> and hold supplies and tarps and platforms used as shelter. The UCPD described it as an effort to clean up the area while there were only four or five protesters present—far fewer than normal. Supporters of the tree-sitters said the university intentionally chose to remove the supplies on a day on which rain was forecast in order to leave the protesters exposed to the elements. The university stated at the time that they intended to leave the protesters in place until a final court ruling on the building of the center.|$|E
25|$|Chrysopelea ornata is diurnal and arboreal. The snake's gliding ability, {{while not}} as {{impressive}} {{as that of the}} paradise flying snake (C. paradisi), still makes it capable of moving <b>from</b> <b>tree</b> <b>to</b> <b>tree</b> with relative ease. These snakes are excellent climbers, being able move across even the smallest of branches and even straight up trees with few branches by using the edges of rough bark. They are frequently seen moving up a coconut palm, or up vertical rock faces in graceful curves, gripping the somewhat uneven surfaces with their scales. They tend to be nervous, fast-moving snakes, and will attempt to flee if disturbed, but will not generally hesitate to bite if handled. They are mildly venomous, but the venom is not considered to be dangerous to humans. It is intended to assist in subduing fast moving, arboreal prey.|$|E
50|$|Primates {{generally}} have five digits on each limb (pentadactyly), with keratin nails {{on the end}} of each finger and toe. The bottom sides of the hands and feet have sensitive pads on the fingertips. Most have opposable thumbs, a characteristic primate feature, though not limited to this order, (opossums and koalas, for example, also have them). Thumbs allow some species to use tools. In primates, the combination of opposing thumbs, short fingernails (rather than claws) and long, inward-closing fingers is a relict of the ancestral practice of gripping branches, and has, in part, allowed some species to develop brachiation (swinging by the arms <b>from</b> <b>tree</b> limb <b>to</b> <b>tree</b> limb) as a significant means of locomotion. Prosimians have clawlike nails on the second toe of each foot, called toilet-claws, which they use for grooming.|$|R
