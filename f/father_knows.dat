25|$|In {{spite of}} solid and {{consistent}} ratings, Leave It to Beaver never {{climbed into the}} Nielsen's top-30 though similar sitcoms of the period like <b>Father</b> <b>Knows</b> Best, The Donna Reed Show, The Real McCoys, and Dennis the Menace managed to do so.|$|E
25|$|A {{comparison}} of how children {{interact with their}} brothers and sisters on such 1950s situation comedy television programs as Leave It To Beaver and <b>Father</b> <b>Knows</b> Best with those on such 1980s programs as The Cosby Show and Family Ties found that children interacted more positively in the early period but were important and central – if more conflictual – to the main story action in the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|The play's {{short run}} was {{immediately}} followed by larger roles in live TV plays on Kaiser Aluminum Hour, The United States Steel Hour and Matinee Theater.

25|$|ABC's initial {{coverage}} of the incident was very disorganized. Cochran, ABC's primary news anchor, was on his lunch break when word of the assassination attempt first broke and the network had to call {{him back to the}} studio. Silverman was the voice accompanying ABC's first bulletin, broadcast during a rerun episode of <b>Father</b> <b>Knows</b> Best that was airing on a majority of the network's affiliates in the Mountain Time Zone at the time; the surviving videotape of ABC's initial bulletins appears to have been recorded by then-affiliate KTVK in Phoenix, as it contains the interruption of <b>Father</b> <b>Knows</b> Best. The first on-camera report was given by Goddard in the network's news studio, which was too far away from the teletype machines. Goddard then moved to the newsroom and was joined by the returning Cochran, and the technical crew began constructing an impromptu news set around them (ABC did not have studio space ready for such an occasion; NBC had a flash studio in its newsroom and CBS' reports came directly from their own newsroom as they had since they launched an evening newscast earlier in 1963). Cochran and Goddard were forced to stand and awkwardly hold microphones and headsets so they could report the information.|$|E
25|$|Edmund betrays Gloucester to Cornwall, Regan and Goneril. He reveals {{evidence}} that his <b>father</b> <b>knows</b> of an impending French invasion designed to reinstate Lear to the throne; {{and in fact}} a French army has landed in Britain. Once Edmund leaves with Goneril to warn Albany about the invasion, Gloucester is arrested, and Regan and Cornwall gouge out Gloucester's eyes. As he is doing so, a servant is overcome with rage by what he is witnessing and attacks Cornwall, mortally wounding him. Regan kills the servant, and tells Gloucester that Edmund betrayed him; then she turns him out to wander the heath too.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to other popular comedies {{of the era}} (such as <b>Father</b> <b>Knows</b> Best, Leave It to Beaver, and The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet), which depicted their characters in comfortable, middle class suburban environments, the set design for The Honeymooners reflected the blue collar existence of its characters. The Kramdens lived in a small, painfully sparsely furnished two-room apartment (the main set) in a tenement building at least four stories high (the Kramdens were {{on the third floor}} and the Nortons' were one floor above them), badly aired and with insufficient lighting. They used the single main room as the kitchen, dining and living room. It consisted of a functional table and chairs, a plain chest of drawers, a curtainless window with a view of a fire escape, a noisy sink, and an outdated icebox. The Kramdens' bedroom never was seen, although in the episode about Ed Norton's sleepwalking the Nortons' bedroom is. One of the few other sitcoms about a blue collar family was The Life of Riley, whose first season (1949–50) had featured Jackie Gleason in the lead role, although veteran movie actor William Bendix, who had originated the role of Chester A. Riley on the radio show, thereafter took over the role on television.|$|E

500|$|The Simpsons {{takes place}} in the fictional American town of Springfield in an unknown and impossible-to-determine U.S. state. The show is {{intentionally}} evasive in regard to Springfield's location. Springfield's geography, and that of its surroundings, contains coastlines, deserts, vast farmland, tall mountains, or whatever the story or joke requires. Groening has said that Springfield has much in common with Portland, Oregon, the city where he grew up. The name [...] "Springfield" [...] is a common one in America and appears in 22 states. Groening has said that he named it after Springfield, Oregon, and the fictitious Springfield which was the setting of the series <b>Father</b> <b>Knows</b> Best. He [...] "figured out that Springfield {{was one of the most}} common names for a city in the U.S. In anticipation of the success of the show, I thought, 'This will be cool; everyone will think it's their Springfield.' And they do." [...] An astronomer and fan of the show, Phil Plait, humorously noticed that The Simpsons could be set in Australia, because the moon in Springfield faces the wrong way to be an American location.|$|E
500|$|Filming for {{the pilot}} was {{initially}} intended {{to take place in}} an actual Los Angeles neighborhood until the production team realized the difficulties that would ensue. [...] Instead they chose Colonial Street, a backlot street set at Universal Studios Hollywood. The house sets on Colonial Street had been used in numerous film and television productions as early as 1946. Many of the sets, whose styles ranged from contemporary to Victorian to ranch, were remodeled to create a uniform neighborhood. Cherry and production designer Thomas A. Walsh wanted the street to recall the Eisenhower era and convey traditional American values, but appear modern at the same time. Walsh viewed episodes of <b>Father</b> <b>Knows</b> Best, My Three Sons, and Leave It to Beaver, among other television series, to capture the visual style of classic conservative America. Walsh commented, [...] "We were trying to honor that sensibility {{and at the same time}} create an everyplace that was neither a red state nor a blue state." [...] Instead, Walsh insisted that the street was in [...] "kind of a pink state. We're somewhere in the middle of America's soul." [...] Refurbishments of the house sets, which included building interior rooms, cost around $700,000. While Walsh strove for a visually unified look for the street as a whole, he carefully designed the interior of each home to reflect the tastes and budgets of the characters.|$|E

[...] Under the then founding {{general manager of the}} station Sir James Cruthers, TVW commenced broadcasting on 16 October 1959. The then Governor of Western Australia, Sir Charles Gairdner opened the station at 7.30pm that night. Some of the first programs included Leave It to Beaver, Sea Hunt, <b>Father</b> <b>Knows</b> Best, Gunsmoke, Perry Mason, The Epilogue and a local show called Spotlight which featured Rolf Harris.|$|E
2500|$|In 1957, the radio, {{film and}} {{television}} writers Joe Connelly and Bob Mosher developed a concept for a TV show about childhood and family life featuring a fictional suburban couple and their children. Unlike The Adventures of Ozzie & Harriet, <b>Father</b> <b>Knows</b> Best and other sitcoms and domestic comedies of the era, the show would not focus on the parents, but rather on their children, with the series being told from the kids' point of view. Working titles during the show's gestation period included It's a Small World and Wally and the Beaver. The pilot aired April 23, 1957, as [...] "It's a Small World" [...] on the anthology series Heinz Studio 57.|$|E

It debuted on CBS in 1957, to mediocre ratings. The show was picked up by ABC the following year and became a hit, airing for the next five seasons. The show was broadcast in over 100 countries. Also starring on Beaver were Hugh Beaumont, in the role of Ward Cleaver, June's husband and the kids' father, as well as child actors Tony Dow in the role of Wally Cleaver and Jerry Mathers as Theodore [...] "Beaver" [...] Cleaver.|$|E
