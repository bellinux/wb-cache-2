5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, a limited-access highway was {{constructed}} between Utica and <b>Ilion</b> alongside NY5S. The new highway {{became part of}} a rerouted NY5S in the early 1970s. As a result, NY171, which does not interchange with the highway, no longer connects to any other signed state routes. NY171 is the only signed state highway in New York that is completely isolated from {{the remainder of the}} state highway system.|$|E
5|$|NY28 was {{designated}} in 1924 by the New York State Department of Transportation from Colliersville (near Oneonta) north to Utica. At the time, NY28 began at then-NY9 in Colliersville and headed north on its current alignment to Cooperstown. NY28 separated from its modern routing {{and continued to}} Springfield north of Cooperstown on what is now NY80. Between Springfield and Richfield Springs, the highway utilized what is now US20. At Richfield Springs, the highway turned north onto modern NY167 and followed the current alignments of NY167 and NY168 {{to the village of}} Mohawk. Here, the highway turned westward, using a small portion of its current alignment and the present-day NY5S corridor to connect to Utica by way of <b>Ilion.</b>|$|E
5|$|NY28 was {{originally}} assigned in 1924 to an alignment extending from Colliersville {{in the south}} to Utica in the north via <b>Ilion.</b> From Colliersville to Cooperstown, the highway followed its current routing (excluding minor realignments); north of Cooperstown, NY28 was routed along several state highways that now have other designations. The route was extended south to Kingston and north to Warrensburg as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. At the same time, NY28 was realigned between Cooperstown and Mohawk to follow its modern routing. Other than minor realignments in Kingston, Oneonta, and Oneida County, NY28 has remained the same to this day.|$|E
25|$|In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route23, an {{unsigned}} legislative route {{extending from}} <b>Ilion</b> to the North Country via West Winfield and Utica. The route began at Route6 (later NY5S and now Clark Street) in <b>Ilion</b> and followed {{what is now}} NY51 southwest to West Winfield. At {{the center of the}} village, Route23 continued west toward Utica on modern U.S. Route20. In 1912, Route23 was truncated to begin at the western village line of West Winfield while the portion of the route east of that point became Route23-a. The change was reverted on March1, 1921, moving the start of Route23 back to <b>Ilion.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1920s, {{the segment}} of modern NY51 between West Burlington and West Winfield was {{designated}} {{as part of}} NY44, a route that extended south from West Burlington to Sidney and north from West Winfield to Utica. At the time, {{this was the only}} substantial segment of what is now NY51 to have a route number even though all of modern NY51 south of <b>Ilion</b> was state-maintained. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, most of NY44 became part of NY8. The section from West Burlington to West Winfield, however, became part of the new NY51, which utilized all of its modern routing from Mount Upton to <b>Ilion</b> upon assignment. It was extended across the Mohawk River to NY5 in North <b>Ilion</b> in the mid-1960s.|$|E
25|$|Continuing north along a brook, NY51 {{continues}} through Litchfield, passing through Illion Gorge before turning northeast along Steele Creek. NY51 runs {{north of the}} Illion Reservoir No. 2 and crosses into the town of German Flatts, soon reaching the hamlet of South <b>Ilion,</b> where it meets a junction with CR51. A couple blocks to the north, NY51 turns north and enters the village of <b>Ilion,</b> where the route gains the moniker of Otsego Street. Becoming the main northsouth street through <b>Ilion,</b> the route turns northeast at a junction with John Street. Otsego Street becomes the main commercial street through the village, changing names to Central Avenue at a junction with Clark Street. After the name change, NY51 enters an interchange with NY5S and then crosses the Mohawk River into the town of Herkimer, where NY51 enters an interchange with NY5. This junction marks the northern terminus of NY51, {{just south of the}} New York State Thruway (I-90).|$|E
25|$|In April 2009 the Wasa Queen {{was sold}} to Chryses Finance Co. and renamed Arberia. In July {{of the same year}} she entered service on <b>Ilion</b> Lines' service {{connecting}} Trieste and Bari via Durres.|$|E
25|$|New York State Route51 (NY51) is a {{state highway}} in {{the central part of}} New York state. The highway runs {{generally}} in a southwest to northeast direction from the hamlet of Mount Upton to the village of <b>Ilion.</b> NY51 is a two-lane highway its entire length.|$|E
25|$|Antiochus {{founded the}} cult of his father. A cult of {{personality}} formed around the later members of the Seleucid dynasty and Seleucus was later worshipped as a son of god. One inscription found in <b>Ilion</b> (i.e., Troy) advises priests to sacrifice to Apollo, the ancestor of Antiochus' family. Several anecdotes of Seleucus' life became popular in the classical world.|$|E
25|$|Foundrymen Robert Parrott and {{his brother}} Peter {{produced}} significant quantities of artillery pieces and munitions, and their Parrott rifle, an innovative rifled gun, was manufactured in several sizes at the West Point Foundry. The National Arms Company in Brooklyn produced firearms, including large quantities of revolvers. Other important producers of weaponry and munitions were the Federal government's Watervliet Arsenal and the privately owned Remington Arms Company of <b>Ilion.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Joint Board quickly {{held its}} own strike vote. More than 75% of the union's members voted to strike. Union {{officials}} asked {{the company to}} submit the dispute to a federal mediator, but the company refused to do so. Instead, Remington Rand fired {{the presidents of the}} local unions in Tonawanda and Syracuse along with fifteen other union activists. Infuriated workers in <b>Ilion,</b> Syracuse and Tonawanda walked off their jobs on May 25, 1936, followed by Remington Rand workers in Ohio and Connecticut the following day.|$|E
25|$|While most {{villages are}} subject to a uniform statewide Village Law, twelve villages operate under {{charters}} issued by the state legislature prior to 1874. Before a revision to the State Constitution in that year, villages were formed by the state legislature through granting of charters. Many villages reincorporated, dumping their charters {{in favor of the}} Village Law. The villages that retain their charters are Alexander, Carthage, Catskill, Cooperstown, Deposit, Fredonia, <b>Ilion,</b> Mohawk, Ossining, Owego, Port Chester, and Waterford. These villages must still comply with those aspects of Village Law that are not inconsistent with their charters.|$|E
25|$|The highway meets Culver Avenue as {{it enters}} Herkimer County. Not {{far to the}} east is an {{interchange}} for Turner Street, a small connector road. Route5S enters West Frankfort and has an exit for Dyke Road, which connects to the Thruway and NY5. In West Frankfort, it parallels one of its many old alignments. Route5S continues southward, encountering Higby Road and Cemetery Street in Frankfort. Just past the Herkimer County Fairgrounds, Route5S crosses under NY171. In East Frankfort, Route5S intersects with its old routing and turns to the east. Route5S enters <b>Ilion,</b> where it meets NY51. Route5S passes {{to the south of}} Herkimer and has junctions with local roads before intersecting NY28 in Mohawk. While in Mohawk, Route5S also intersects with NY922B, an unsigned reference route.|$|E
25|$|The Athens Metropolitan Area {{consists}} of 58 densely populated municipalities, sprawling around the municipality of Athens (the city centre) {{in virtually all}} directions. For the Athenians, all the urban municipalities surrounding the city centre are called suburbs. According to their geographic location {{in relation to the}} City of Athens, the suburbs are divided into four zones; the northern suburbs (including Agios Stefanos, Dionysos, Ekali, Nea Erythraia, Kifissia, Maroussi, Pefki, Lykovrysi, Metamorfosi, Nea Ionia, Nea Filadelfeia, Irakleio, Vrilissia, Melissia, Penteli, Chalandri, Agia Paraskevi, Galatsi, Psychiko and Filothei); the southern suburbs (including Alimos, Nea Smyrni, Moschato, Kallithea, Agios Dimitrios, Palaio Faliro, Elliniko, Glyfada, Argyroupoli, Ilioupoli, Voula and Vouliagmeni); the eastern suburbs (including Zografou, Dafni, Vyronas, Kaisariani, Cholargos and Papagou); and the western suburbs (including Peristeri, <b>Ilion,</b> Egaleo, Koridallos, Agia Varvara, Chaidari, Petroupoli, Agioi Anargyroi and Kamatero).|$|E
25|$|MS Arberia is a cruiseferry {{owned by}} Chryses Finance Co. and {{operated}} by <b>Ilion</b> Lines on their Trieste–Durres–Bari -service. She was built in 1975 by Dubegion-Normandie S.A., Nantes, France for Steamship Company Bore, Finland as MS Bore Star for Steamship Company Bore who used her in Silja Line services on the Baltic Sea. During the northern hemisphere winter months she was chartered to Finnlines for cruise services on African west coast. In 1980 she was sold to Finland Steamship Company and renamed MS Silja Star but retained in Silja Line service. Between 1986 and 1992 she was used in different cruise and ferry services {{around the world for}} various operators under the names MS Orient Express, MS Club Sea, MS Eurosun and MS Orient Sun. In 1992 her ownership passed to Wasa Line and she was renamed MS Wasa Queen for Baltic Sea ferry service. In 1993 Wasa Line was merged into Silja Line and Wasa Queen returned to the Silja Line fleet. In 2001 she was sold to Star Cruises for use in Far Eastern ferry service and later casino cruising with their daughter company Cruise Ferries without a change in name. In 2008 Wasa Queen was withdrawn from service, and in 2009 sold to her current owners.|$|E
500|$|NY171 is one {{of several}} signed state {{highways}} in New York that do not intersect any other signed New York state routes. However, this was not always the case. When it was originally assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, Main Street in Frankfort was part of NY5S. A new freeway alignment for NY5S was constructed between Utica and <b>Ilion</b> in the late 1960s, isolating NY171 from the remainder of the state highway system. Frankfort's interchange with NY5S is now at Cemetery Street, [...] to the west.|$|E
2500|$|As NY51 {{approaches}} the northern border of Otsego County, {{it makes a}} sharp left before descending to US20 to the west in West Winfield. A [...] concurrency carries {{it back to the}} original path where it again heads northward. Then, at Cedarville, it turns left and then right to use a different route, from thence it descends through the winding <b>Ilion</b> Gorge until it reaches <b>Ilion,</b> where it is known as Otsego Street.|$|E
2500|$|This was {{the origin}} of the term typewriter. Remington began {{production}} of its first typewriter on March 1, 1873, in <b>Ilion,</b> New York. It had a QWERTY keyboard layout, which because of the machine's success, was slowly adopted by other typewriter manufacturers. [...] As with most other early typewriters, because the typebars strike upwards, the typist could not see the characters as they were typed.|$|E
2500|$|In March 1934, the AFL began {{organizing}} {{skilled workers}} at two typewriter companies, Underwood Typewriter Company and Remington Rand. [...] The employees organized the District Council of Office Equipment Workers, a federal union {{affiliated with the}} Metal Trades Department of the American Federation of Labor. Six plants were organized in the towns of Tonawanda, <b>Ilion</b> and Syracuse in New York; in Middletown, Connecticut; and in Marietta and Norwood in Ohio.|$|E
2500|$|Rescuers responded from Little Falls, Herkimer, Utica, <b>Ilion</b> {{and other}} nearby towns. [...] Bonfires were set for {{illumination}} and acetylene torches {{were used to}} free victims. Rescue operations were made more difficult by rain, sleet and snow {{that began in the}} early morning hours of April 20. Injured victims were sent to hospitals in Little Falls, Frankfort, Herkimer, Utica, and <b>Ilion</b> as well as to hotels, private homes and churches. The New York State Police estimated that 4,000 people converged at the scene. Wreckage blocked direct vehicular access to the crash site, requiring rescuers to take a three-mile (...) detour between the site and the hospital a half-mile (800m) away. At the state capitol, Governor Herbert H. Lehman directed the State Police and Public Works employees to [...] "give all possible aid". The last body was pulled from the wreckage on April 21. Thirty-five Chinese nationals en route to San Francisco in the custody of a United States Marshall, who were being deported for entering the US illegally, were in the last car and were uninjured. (Another source says they were being transported to Canada, from where they entered the US.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The Supreme Council {{meeting of}} June 11, 1891, {{would prove to}} be the true {{launching}} point of the organization. On this day a report was made of the granting of a dispensation for the second Grotto to be formed – Khorassan Grotto No. 2, of <b>Ilion,</b> NY. Later that year dispensations were also granted to Lalla Rookh Grotto No. 3 of Rochester, NY, and Zeba Grotto No. 4 of Rome, NY. On June 9, 1892, Khorassan Grotto No. 2 was officially chartered, making it the second operational Grotto in the Enchanted Realm.|$|E
2500|$|From Utica to Mohawk, NY5S was {{originally}} routed on [...] "Old Route5S" [...] and Main Street. It was realigned {{in the early}} 1970s to follow a new freeway between Utica and <b>Ilion</b> that bypassed Frankfort to the west. A super two extension of the freeway east to Mohawk was completed sometime after 1982 (actually in 1992). On April5, 1987, the bridge carrying the New York State Thruway over Schoharie Creek collapsed. At the time, the creek was higher and flowing faster than normal due to excessive rains in the area. The segment of NY5S near Fort Hunter was reconfigured to carry westbound Thruway traffic while the bridge was rebuilt.|$|E
2500|$|In January 1886, Richardson {{was married}} in a {{ceremony}} at Utica, New York, to Lillie M. Davis. [...] In reporting on the wedding, The Sporting News wrote: [...] "Mr. Richardson's fame as a ball player extends from Maine to California, and is only surpassed by his genial gentlemanly bearing and manner, which have earned for him the best wishes of innumerable friends for his future happiness." [...] Richardson {{and his wife had}} a daughter, Dorothy, born in 1895. [...] After retiring from baseball, Richardson reportedly operated a hotel in Utica, New York. By 1900, he was living in Utica with his wife, Lillie, and their daughter, Dorothy, and he was employed as an [...] "art glass stainer." [...] By 1905, Richardson and his wife had moved to German Flatts and later to <b>Ilion,</b> both in Herkimer County, New York, where he worked for the Remington Typewriter Company.|$|E
2500|$|Eos departs at dawn without {{replying}} to {{his wish}} that she {{take back the}} boon of immortality. As she leaves, her tears fall on his cheek. This fills him with the foreboding that the saying he had learnt on earth, that even [...] "The Gods themselves cannot recall their gifts"(49), might be true. He remembers his youth when he would feel his whole body come alive at dawn as Eos kissed him and whispered to him words [...] "wild and sweet" [...] (61), which seemed like the song Apollo sang as <b>Ilion</b> (Troy) was being built. In the final section, weary of life and immortality, he yearns for death to take him. He feels that [...] "men that {{have the power to}} die" [...] (70) are happy and fortunate.

2500|$|Local law {{enforcement}} personnel played a particularly {{important role in}} terrorizing the population of <b>Ilion</b> and turning public opinion against the union. Remington Rand paid Herkimer County to deputize 300 special sheriff's deputies to provide protection for company and town property. Remington Rand armed the deputies with Remington handguns and billy-clubs, and bought civilian automobiles to serve as squad cars. While these deputies and the town police remained {{under the control of}} their respective governmental authorities, the company worked closely with county and town officials to heighten tensions within the town. [...] Squads of six sheriff's deputies and one police officer were armed with shotguns and stationed at every road and path leading into the town. Local citizens had to obtain passes from the Remington Rand company to enter the town. Later, company officials disingenuously accused local police of using kid gloves on strikers, which gave local police the political cover they needed to increase the level of violence aimed at picketers.|$|E
2500|$|Remington Rand also {{relied heavily}} on local police and specially-sworn county sheriff's deputies to provide protection. Several months before the strike began, the company {{informed}} local officials that it intended to provoke the union and would need the cooperation of local officials. Many enthusiastically did so, believing that the company would close its plants (harming the city's tax base) if they did not. [...] In Syracuse, for example, the mayor gave the company unlimited police protection. [...] Where local officials resisted the company's request for help, Remington Rand intimidated them into offering assistance. [...] The mayor of <b>Ilion</b> later admitted that {{he was forced to}} provide police protection: His own personal banker had threatened to call in his loans and delete his personal and business lines of credit, and a [...] "citizens' committee" [...] formed by the company threatened to institute a boycott against his business and a slander campaign against him personally if he did not cooperate.|$|E
