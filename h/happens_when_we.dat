It {{was recorded in}} two locations, 3:20 Studios, Los Angeles, California and MSR Studios, New York, New York. Madonna reflected on the recording sessions with Orbit: [...] "We've worked on stuff {{for so many years}} that we kind of finish each other's sentences. He knows my taste and what I like. Magic <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> get into a recording studio together." [...] Additional production came from Harry, who also played acoustic guitars, keyboards, vocoder and did the programming for the track. Demacio [...] "Demo" [...] Castellon mixed and engineered the song with help from Frank Filipetti, while Angie Teo did additional engineering and editing. Other personnel working on [...] "Masterpiece" [...] was Ron Taylor who did protools editing and further editing from Stephen [...] "The Koz" [...] Kozmeniuk.|$|E

Rolling Stone magazine's early articles on the incident misreported that the killing took place during [...] "Sympathy for the Devil", but the Stones in fact played [...] "Sympathy for the Devil" [...] earlier in the concert; it {{was interrupted by a}} fight and restarted, Jagger commenting, [...] "We're always having—something very funny <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> start that number." [...] Several other songs were performed before Hunter was killed.|$|E

He said that [...] "An electrifying thing happens {{when the two of}} us work together. I haven't experienced it with anyone else. A freedom <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> work together." [...] In 2006, they appeared onstage in a Pasadena Playhouse production of August Wilson's Fences. He played terrorist leader, Ahmat who was revealed to be CIA in the 2006 film Five Fingers.|$|E

2500|$|HR {{holds that}} the {{therapeutic}} [...] "working through" [...] of personal issues from the past to achieve wholeness is unnecessary. According to the HR model, people are already whole and healthy. The traumas of the past are only important {{to the extent that}} the individual lets them influence his or her thoughts in the present. According to HR, one's [...] "issues" [...] and memories are just thoughts, and the individual can react to them or not. The more the clients' experience is that they themselves are creating their own painful feelings via their own [...] "power of Thought," [...] HR suggests, the less these feelings bother them. Sedgeman has compared this to what <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> make scary faces at ourselves in the mirror: because we know it is just us, it is impossible to scare ourselves that way.|$|E
2500|$|The Marshall Mathers LP was {{recorded}} in a two-month-long [...] "creative binge", which often involved 20-hour-long studio sessions. Eminem hoped to keep publicity down during the recording {{in order to stay}} focused on working and figuring out how to [...] "map out" [...] each song. He described himself as a [...] "studio rat" [...] who benefited creatively from the isolated environment of the studio. Much of the album was written spontaneously in the studio; Dr. Dre noted, [...] "We don't wake up at two in the morning, call each other, and say, 'I have an idea. We gotta get to the studio. ' We just wait and see what <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> get there. [...] " [...] Eminem observed that much of his favorite material on the album evolved from [...] "fucking around" [...] in the studio; [...] "Marshall Mathers" [...] developed from the rapper watching Jeff Bass casually strumming a guitar, while [...] "Criminal" [...] was based on a piano riff Eminem overheard Bass playing in studio next door. [...] "Kill You" [...] was written when Eminem heard the track playing in the background while talking to Dr. Dre on the phone and developed an interest in using it for a song. He then wrote the lyrics at home and met up with Dr. Dre and the two recorded the song together.|$|E
2500|$|Recording for the band's third studio album started {{relatively}} early, in February and March 2013, {{when the}} band spent a week-and-a-half with producer Malay. Lead vocalist Dougy Mandagi had met Malay during his stay in Los Angeles, {{and the two}} had a mutual admiration and respect for each other's work. Mandagi had been writing new ideas for songs during his stay in Los Angeles, {{while the rest of}} the band were at home in London, doing the same. While previously, the band made use of jam sessions to create new songs, the band opted instead to take different approaches to writing songs, such as combining various ideas, conceived by different members of the band, into single tracks. The band met up and held their first sessions at the La Casa Artist Residency, a recording studio situated in Byron Bay, New South Wales, and owned by American filmmaker Taylor Steele. Contrasting from a traditional recording studio, the residency was originally set up by Steele as a retreat for artists to spend time, between a few days to a few weeks, to [...] "find inspiration and make art, with Byron Bay as their muse." [...] The band spent a few weeks, over the course of two visits, at La Casa with Malay. The band amassed over thirty ideas for songs during the sessions, with [...] "Lost" [...] and [...] "Summer's Almost Gone" [...] being two of the earliest written and recorded tracks to eventually appear on the final album. According to drummer Toby Dundas, the band's experience with Malay opened them up to the idea of collaborating with other songwriters; an idea the band had previously rejected. Dunas explained, [...] "if it had gone badly it might have left a bad taste in our mouths. But he bought something interesting to the table. We thought 'Look what <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> work with people who bring their flavour to what we're doing' so we kept exploring that." ...|$|E

6000|$|... § 10. Perhaps in {{describing}} mountains with {{any effort to}} give some idea of their sublime forms, no expression comes oftener to the lips than the word [...] "peak." [...] And yet it is curious how rarely, even among the grandest ranges, an instance can be found of a mountain ascertainably peaked in the true sense of the word,--pointed at the top, and sloping steeply on all sides; perhaps not more than five summits {{in the chain of}} the Alps, the Finster-Aarhorn, Wetterhorn, Bietschhorn, Weisshorn, and Monte Viso presenting approximations to such a structure. Even in the case of not very steep pyramids, presenting themselves in the distance under some such outline as that at the top of Fig. 30, it almost invariably <b>happens,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> approach and examine them, that they do not slope equally on all their sides, but are nothing more than steep ends of ridges, supported by far-extended masses of comparatively level rock, which, seen in perspective, give the impression of a steep slope, though in reality disposed in a horizonal, or nearly horizontal, line.|$|E

At present the {{regiment}} professes its fidelity, and has now volunteered to march against the mutineers. The colonel believes them, so do some of the others; I do not; it may be that the men mean what they say at present, but we know that emissaries come and go, and every fresh rising will be an incentive to them. It is no use blinking the truth, dear; we are like men standing on a loaded mine which may at any moment explode. I have been thinking, indeed for the last week I have done nothing but think, what is best to be done. If the mutiny breaks out at night or at any time when we are not on parade, we have agreed that all the whites shall make at once for Mr. Thompson's house. It is the strongest of any of the residences--for there would of course be no getting to the messhouse--and then we will sell our lives as dearly as we may. If it <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> are on parade, defense by the rest of the residents would be useless. There are but six civilians, with you two boys--for we have counted you--eight. Probably but few of you could gain Thompson's house in time; and if all did, your number would be too small to defend it. There remains then nothing but flight. The rising will most likely take place on parade. The residents have agreed that each day they will, on some excuses or other, have their traps at their door at that hour, so that at the sound of the first shot fired they may jump in and drive off." ...|$|E
