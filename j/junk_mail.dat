Spam is nothing but the mails or more appropriately it is defined as <b>junk</b> <b>mails</b> which create hindrance in doing the work.

The armor for the Gundans, gorgeously conceived and finished, typifies Hudson's capacity to produce safe, comfortable, impressive costumes on a tight budget: the armor was actually made of thin, vacuum-formed plastic, and given is pewter finish by metal deposition, while the grills on the helmets were made from <b>junked</b> <b>mail</b> trays.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{system log}} (syslog) {{files of the}} E-mail and the DNS cache servers in Kumamoto University were {{statistically}} investigated when receiving a lot of spam mails. The DNS query traffic between the E-mail and the DNS cache servers increases when many traces of spam and/or <b>junk</b> <b>mails</b> are found in syslog file of the E-mail server. The DNS query traffic decreases when preventing access between the E-mail server and the spam/junk transferring SMTP clients. This is because the DNS query between the DNS and E-mail servers are mainly driven by the SMTP access in the E-mail server. Therefore, we can detect abnormality of the E-mail server by monitoring the DNS query traffic from the E-mail server to the DNS server and get access-controlling list by analysis of the SMTP syslog files...|$|R
25|$|The main {{provision}} of the Air Mail Act changed {{the manner in which}} payments were calculated. Air mail carriers would be paid for having sufficient cargo capacity on their planes, whether the planes carried mail or flew empty, a disincentive to carry mail since the carrier received a set fee for a plane of a certain size whether or not it carried mail. The purpose of the provision was to discourage the carrying of bulk <b>junk</b> <b>mail</b> to boost profits, particularly by the smaller and inefficient carriers, and to encourage the carrying of passengers. Airlines using larger planes designed to carry passengers would increase their revenues by carrying more passengers and less mail. Awards would be made to the “lowest responsible bidder” that had owned an airline operated on a daily schedule of at least 250 miles (402 kilometers) for at least six months.|$|E

To filter the spam from the legitimate emails, classification approach using context based techniques are proposed. In this talk, an {{efficient and effective}} classification approach to detect the spam email from the legitimate will be discussed. In the first phase, A Vector Space Model (VSM) based classification method is developed accordingly. In which the input mail is converted into matrix and {{on the basis of}} term frequency.

40|$|In today’s world, e-mail {{has become}} one of the most {{important}} means of communication in business and private lives due to its efficiency. However, the problems start as soon as mail volumes go beyond the scope of human information processing capabilities. Firstly, time does not allow for leaving certain messages unanswered for a long time, and in certain cases, for reading all messages. Secondly, the dilemma of electronic filters leaves a choice of too many <b>junk</b> <b>mails</b> getting through versus a risk of solicited mails being dumped. In this paper we present a new interactive visual data mining approach for analyzing individual e-mail communication. It combines classical visual analytics (help to identify pattern such as peaks and trends over time) with geo-spatial map distortions (help to understand the routes of e-mails). Experiments show that our visual e-mail explorer produces useful and interesting visualizations of large collections of e-mail and is practical for exploring temporal and geo-spatial patterns hidden in the e-mail data...|$|R
40|$|Spams are {{electronic}} <b>junk</b> <b>mails</b> {{that are}} costly for the {{individuals and organizations}} who receive them and Internet service providers who handle them.

To the best of our knowledge, none of the existing spam detectors uses a semantic-based approach in detection of spams. In this paper, we present Semantix-Plus which uses both semantic-based indications and syntax-based indications to convert a given e-mail into a 10 -variable record. The detector then uses a backpropagation neural network for the classification of the e-mail. We have compared the behavior of the Semantix-Plus with the spam detectors used by Google, Yahoo, and AASU mail servers for a limited number of spams. The results reveal that the Semantix-Plus has a superior detection power to its counterparts...|$|R

50|$|Commercialization of the {{internet}} and integration of electronic mail as an accessible means of communication has another face - the influx of unwanted information and mails. As the Internet started to gain popularity in the early 1990s, it was quickly recognized as an excellent advertising tool. At practically no cost, a person can use the Internet to send an email message to thousands of people. These unsolicited <b>junk</b> electronic <b>mails</b> came to be called 'Spam'.

40|$|Spam {{messages}} are nuisance and huge problem to most users since they clutter their mailboxes and waste {{their time to}} delete all the <b>junk</b> <b>mails</b> before reading the legitimate ones. They also cost user money with dial up connections, waste network bandwidth and disk space and most importantly make available harmful and offensive materials such as pornographic sites to children. All these problems can be rectified by using an apt Mail filter. The Mail filter that we have considered here is open source engine widely known as Anti Spam SMTP Proxy. This paper provides a framework to overcome {{the limitations of the}} existing ASSP server engine by restructuring the existing ASSP server engine. This paper would deal with spam detection as image spam, video spam that come as attachments and a single line message that would direct to another URL with a trainable fuzzy classifier to build an automatic anti spam filter. Based on the rule, evaluations were done to predict whether the given mail is a valid or invalid and the report is updated in the database. Finally, our work attempts to improve performance of the Anti Spam SMTP Proxy Mailfilter by configuring the ASSP server engine with an efficient Mail Transfer Agent based on the analysis done with leading open source MTAs like Sendmail, Postfix and Qmail...|$|R

2500|$|Email spam, {{also known}} as {{unsolicited}} bulk email (UBE), <b>junk</b> <b>mail,</b> or unsolicited commercial email (UCE), is the practice of sending unwanted email messages, frequently with commercial content, in large quantities to an indiscriminate set of recipients. Spam in email started to become a problem when the Internet was opened up {{to the general public}} in the mid-1990s. It grew exponentially over the following years, and today composes some 80 to 85 percent of all the e-mail in the World, by a [...] "conservative estimate". Pressure to make email spam illegal has been successful in some jurisdictions, but less so in others. The efforts taken by governing bodies, security systems and email service providers seem to be helping to reduce the onslaught of email spam. According to [...] "2014 Internet Security Threat Report, Volume 19" [...] published by Symantec Corporation, spam volume dropped to 66% of all email traffic. [...] Spammers take advantage of this fact, and frequently outsource parts of their operations to countries where spamming will not get them into legal trouble.|$|E
2500|$|Email spam exemplifies {{a tragedy}} of the commons: spammers use {{resources}} (both physical and human), without bearing the entire cost of those resources. [...] In fact, spammers commonly do not bear the cost at all. This raises the costs for everyone. In some ways spam is even a potential threat to the entire email system, as operated in the past. Since email is so cheap to send, a tiny number of spammers can saturate the Internet with <b>junk</b> <b>mail.</b> Although only a tiny percentage of their targets are motivated to purchase their products (or fall victim to their scams), the low cost may provide a sufficient conversion rate to keep the spamming alive. Furthermore, even though spam appears not to be economically viable {{as a way for}} a reputable company to do business, it suffices for professional spammers to convince a tiny proportion of gullible advertisers that it is viable for those spammers to stay in business. Finally, new spammers go into business every day, and the low costs allow a single spammer {{to do a lot of}} harm before finally realizing that the business is not profitable.|$|E

For example, an individual who has a conspiracy theory based on <b>junk</b> or mislabeled <b>mail</b> could have a delusion involving the mail and the government. However, there wouldn't necessarily be any delusional memories to support it. It is simply a belief that has been created due to unhindered perception of events.|$|R
40|$|Bots, or {{software}} {{agents are}} {{programs designed to}} perform tasks autonomously. Mailbots attempt to provide useful functions about electronic mail (E-mail) service such as ﬁltering information, gathering information, and scheduling. With Internet use continuing to explode, the information overload is growing so fast that the same virtues that made E-mail so popular are now becoming a negative technologic ‘‘boomerang’’ (see the volume of <b>junk</b> or spam <b>mail).</b> Industrial as well as academic research has faced this problem in terms of automated ﬁltering methods in order to distinguish legtimate E-mail from spamming. Here we describe an alternative approach: our mailbot is skilled to ﬁnd ‘‘appropriate’’ destination of the message triggering a spidering process on an Intranetbased network. The spidering performs a distributed, mobile computation via pervasive agents: by applying a similarity-based reasoning on designed users resources the agents are able to deduct if the contacted user may be interested or not in receiving the E-mail. The overall architecture is implemented in Java using the basic issues of Internet protocol...|$|R
