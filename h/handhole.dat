40|$|This study uses {{survey data}} {{collected}} in 2012 / 2013 farming season {{to determine the}} net-returns and utility-efficient farm management practices for improved sorghum varieties adopted by small-scale farmers in Tanzania. The reference farm management practice was using JEMBE (<b>handhole)</b> for land cultivation and growing local varieties (landraces). Other farm management practices included using ox-plough for land cultivation with or without applying manure for soil amendment, and using JEMBE for land cultivation with or without applying manure. Improved sorghum Varieties included Tegemeo, Pato, Macia, Wahi, Hakika, Mtama- 1, and Sila. We used simulation and bootstrapping to estimate yield distributions and net returns and stochastic efficiency {{with respect to a}} function to complement first and second degree stochastic dominance analyses to determine varieties and farm management practice that reduce production and price risk. Under profit maximization and risk reduction assumptions, main results show that Macia and Mtama- 1 varieties have high mean yield and low yield variability. Even under low inputs and extreme risk averse farmers, Macia and Mtama- 1 were superior choices. Value addition activities increased price offered to farmers, which also reduced price risk...|$|E

5000|$|Numerous early {{improvements}} {{were aimed}} at increasing reliability and life, including a switch from the [...] "U" [...] shaped top (exhaust) well to a [...] "V" [...] shaped top well. This eliminated the cast top deck {{in favor of a}} fabricated (from plate steel) top deck, which had been the source of some early-life failures. The 567 gave way to the 567A in 1941, which incorporated further top deck improvements and camshaft gear train changes. The 567B followed in 1946 with minor improvements. The 567C was released to further improve reliability and manufacturability.

40|$|One of the {{key factors}} dictating the safety and {{durability}} of the proposed U. S. Space Station {{is the ability to}} repair structural damage while remaining in orbit. Consequently, studies are conducted to identify the engineering problems associated with accomplishing structural repairs on orbit, due to zero gravity environment and exposure to extreme temperature variations. There are predominant forms of structural failure, depending on the metallic or composite material involved. Aluminum is the primary metallic material used in space vehicle applications. Welding processes on aluminum alloy structures were tested, resulting in final selection of electron beam welding as the primary technique for metallic material repair in Space. Several composite structure repair processes were bench-tested to define their applicability to on-orbit EVA requirements: induction heating prevailed. One of the unique problems identified as inherent in the on-orbit repair process is that of debris containment. The Maintenance Work Station concept provides means to prevent module contamination from repair debris and ensure the creation of a facility for crew members to work easily in a microgravity environment. Different technologies were also examined for application to EVA repair activities, and the concept selected was a spring-loaded, collapsible, box-like Debris Containement and Collection Device with incorporated fold-down tool boards and <b>handholes</b> in the front panel...|$|R
2500|$|In the Normand boiler, {{the tubes}} were {{comparatively}} straight and {{a portion of}} those in the inner and outer rows of each bank were formed into [...] "tube walls" [...] to direct hot gases generated by the furnace through the boiler. In the Reed boiler, the tubes were bent into pronounced curves of varying radii to maximise surface area and therefore steam production, and baffles were used to direct hot gases. Further, the external diameter of the tubes tapered at their lower ends from inches (27mm) to inch (22mm) to improve the passage of hot gases between them. They were connected perpendicularly to the chambers at each end, as were the tubes in the Normand boiler, to reduce stress. However, in the Reed boiler these connections were made by hemispherical faces, which allowed [...] "a certain angular play". The tubes were secured by nuts inside the chambers at each end. <b>Handholes</b> gave access to the bottom chambers, and a manhole gave access to the top chamber. In both types of boiler, the tubes joined the top chamber below the designed water line to stop them overheating, and large, external [...] "down-comer" [...] tubes transferred water from the top chamber to the two bottom ones. The down-comers thus promoted convection within the boiler, which needed to be rapid because of the small diameter of the tubes, and formed [...] "a substantial part of [...] framework." ...|$|R
