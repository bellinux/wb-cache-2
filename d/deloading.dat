In the event of a missed lift, each spotter hooks an elbow under the end of the bar, and takes the plates in both hands. Care must be taken to keep the assistance balanced and coordinated to avoid uneven <b>deloading</b> of the weight and possible torsion injury. If two spotters are unavailable, a single spotter can assist by taking some of the weight off the bar allowing the lifter to return the weight to the rack. Unlike other exercises this exercise does not present much of a chance for the spotters to assist the lifter, as the spotters only intercede in the event of a missed lift.|$|E

Called <b>deloading</b> tape, the mechanism of action is hypothesized to involve effects ranging from direct mechanical <b>deloading</b> of the underlying soft tissues to psychological effects on confidence. There {{is no evidence that}} <b>deloading</b> tape has direct mechanical effects. This study used an elastographic technique (supersonic shear imaging) to test the hypothesis that <b>deloading</b> tape applied to the skin over the rectus femoris would reduce stress within the taped area of this muscle. Methods: Thirteen healthy volunteers participated in this experiment. Muscle shear elastic modulus was compared between three treatments (no tape, <b>deloading</b> tape, and sham tape) in four conditions: three conditions without muscle contraction at different rectus femoris muscle-tendon unit lengths (moderately stretched, highly stretched, and shortened) and during submaximal isometric leg extension. Results: Although there was no effect of treatment when the muscle was shortened (P = 0. 99), the shear elastic modulus was significantly affected by treatment for the three other conditions (all P < 0. 002).

40|$|Following the {{significant}} increase of world wide installed wind power {{during the first}} decade of the 21 st century, transmission system operators are faced with new challenges originating from the intermittent character of renewable energy sources and their installation on low and medium voltage levels. One challenge arising from the fluctuating nature of wind is to maintain frequency stability. This thesis presents a new approach to smooth the power generation of wind turbines subjected to varying wind. An active power feedback control has been developed which feeds back the momentary power generation to the turbine pitch and speed control systems. This power feedback control has been implemented in the simulation software SIMPOW and the results have been compared to a frequency control regulator for wind turbines. The frequency control was developed by the Power System Analysis Group at A° F Industry as a part of the Swedish research initiative Elforsk. Simulation results show that the power feedback control clearly levels the active power production of wind turbines under varying wind and thereby diminishes network frequency excursions. To achieve this, turbine <b>deloading</b> through a pitch angle offset is found to be imperative. The effect of different <b>deloading</b> levels of a turbine are evaluated, clearly demonstrating the correlation between larger <b>deloading,</b> enhanced frequency stability and declining energy yield. Up to wind power shares of approximately 25 %, the performance of the power feedback control is on a par with the frequency control, i. e., frequency excursions are equally subdued. Above this level of installed wind power, the frequency control is superior. Usage of the wind turbine power feedback control is discouraged because of its poorer performance, its unintuitive function and the difficulty to predict its behaviour. Lastly, the frequency control is applied to a much simplified black start case, showing the expediency of the control method to improve frequency stability, but also the extended requirement on a large turbine <b>deloading</b> when there are no synchronously generating units in the network...|$|E

A similar variable droop control scheme is presented in [62] for DFIG wind farms to adjust their droop coefficients according to the variable power reserve, so that {{the total number of}} power output reversals in traditional units and the Root Mean Square (RMS) value of frequency deviations are dramatically diminished.|$|R

30|$|The left sub-optimal {{operating}} point is unstable {{since it is}} likely to cause the wind turbine to stall under a frequency disturbance. The wind turbine should operate on the right sub-optimal curve, so as to maintain stable operation when providing frequency response over a full range of wind speeds [45]. Another advantage of right sub-optimal operation is to enable a PMSG-WTG to contribute a combination of reserved active power and greater kinetic energy to support primary frequency regulation, by allowing the rotor speed to decline from the <b>deloaded</b> {{operating point}} towards the maximum power point. Moreover, it can effectively reduce tear and wear losses associated with pitch angle actuation compared with using the pitch servo alone to curtail the wind power and perform primary frequency regulation.

40|$|International audience— In {{this paper}} we {{address the problem of}} power sharing among the wind {{turbines}} (WTs) belonging to a wind farm. The objective is to maximize the power extraction under the wake effect, and in the presence of wind disturbances. Because of the latter, WTs may fail in respecting the optimal power sharing gains. These are restored by employing a consensus control among the WTs. In particular, under the assumption of discrete-time communication among the WTs, we propose a distributed PID-like consensus approach that enhances the rejection of the wind disturbances by providing the power references to the local WT controllers. The latter are designed by employing a novel feedback linearization control that, acting simultaneously on the WT rotor speed and the pitch angle, guarantees the tracking of general <b>deloaded</b> power references.

Thereafter, we combine singular perturbation and Lyapunov theory to prove that, under certain conditions, the proposed protocol will asymptotically converge to its equilibrium. Finally, we derive a cooperative Control Lyapunov Function-based (CLF) controller for the rotor side converter (RSC) of each WG that realizes the protocol in practice.

40|$|The ATP-binding {{cassette}} transporter 1 (ABCA 1) {{has recently}} {{been identified as a}} major regulator of systemic HDL. The main focus of this work was to identify and further characterize ABCA 1 -interactive proteins. A Yeast-Two-Hybrid screening with the last 144 amino acids of the ABCA 1 C-terminus as bait was performed. Our results indicate that ABCA 1 forms a heteromeric complex with each of: Fas-associated death domain (FADD), beta 2 -syntrophin, syntaxin 13 and flotillin- 1, indicating a role for ABCA 1 beyond mere reverse cholesterol transport. The interactions of the identified putative ABCA 1 -associated proteins were confirmed by independent approaches. In addition, functional studies were performed to elucidate the physiological consequences of these protein complexes. The finding that FADD directly interacts with ABCA 1 is surprising and links cellular HDL metabolism with a protein mainly described in the context of death receptor-induced apoptosis, since FADD plays a well-established role in transduction of apoptotic signals and other cellular processes. The FADD/ABCA 1 interaction may indicate an anti-apoptotic ABCA 1 function independent from a suggested phosphatidylserine translocase activity. The C-terminal sequence of ABCA 1 has been described previously as a binding motif for the PDZ domains of syntrophin. We showed that ABCA 1 binds beta 2 -syntrophin, a PDZ protein that acts as a general adaptor of membrane proteins to the actin cytoskeleton via utrophin, a protein highly homologous to dystrophin. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a member of the ABC transporter family, has been reported to interact with syntaxin 1 A. Thereupon, we investigated the interaction of ABCA 1 with syntaxins and identified syntaxin 13 as a direct ABCA 1 -interactor in this family. Syntaxin 13, through its interacting protein pallidin (syntaxin 13 interacting protein), is linked to Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) and Chediak-Higachi syndrome (CHS). These lysosomal storage diseases are associated with pulmonary fibrosis and prolonged bleeding caused by defects in the Adapter protein- 3 complex (AP- 3). Recent publications show that ABCA 1 mutations in Tangier patients are related to impaired platelet activation due to the presence of ABCA 1, syntaxin 13 and syntaxin 13 -interacting protein in the AP- 3 pathway. Moreover, ABCA 1 deficiency leads to enhanced phagocytosis in Tangier macrophages and fibroblasts, related to disturbances of the AP- 3 pathway. The enhanced uptake of apoA-I by endocytic and phagocytic ingestion may also explain the increased catabolism of apoA-I in Tangier patients. Syntaxin 13 deficiency causes ABCA 1 protein degradation and therefore syntaxin 13 may be important in ABCA 1 maturation and vesicular transport. This finding links ABCA 1 to a potential regulator of phagocytosis indicating that both the phagosomal and lysosomal compartment may be involved in ABCA 1 -dependent choline-phospholipid efflux. The integral membrane protein flotillin- 1 was also found to interact with ABCA 1. Overexpression of flotillin- 1 enhances filipodia formation, linking ABCA 1 to migration and cytoskeletal changes. In {{the second part of the}} work human monocyte-derived macrophages were loaded with differently modified atherogenic LDLs, and subsequently deloaded by HDL 3 in order to ascertain differential gene regulation within lipid-related pathways. This characterization was performed by Affymetrix U 133 a gene chips. Our results indicate that Ox-LDL induces less cytoplasmic cholesteryl ester accumulation than E-LDL, a result of the chemical alterations during oxidation. We further showed that cholesterol efflux influences the gene expression of a substantial portion of structural elements of the large and small ribosomal subunits. <b>Deloading</b> of E-LDL, but not Ox-LDL, loaded macrophages led to a distinguished upregulation of genes in the polymerase-II complex, indicating a close relationship between E-LDL, taken up outside clathrin coated pits by phagocytosis, and the control mechanisms at the transcriptional level. This E-LDL specific effect continues more downstream in the translation machinery represented by the 40 S and 60 S ribosomal genes as well as in the proteasomal degradation machinery where unneeded proteins are promptly degraded. In addition, ATP synthases were also upregulated during HDL 3 -induced <b>deloading</b> of E-LDL, but not Ox-LDL, loaded macrophages. In addition, LDL-receptor mediated cholesterol uptake downregulates intracellular cholesterol synthesis by inhibition of HMGCoA reductase and inhibition of LDL-receptor by feedback mechanism. This cholesterol sensitive regulatory system leads to subsequent <b>deloading</b> of E-LDL whereas Ox-LDL is trapped inside the cell. Thus, certain modification types of lipoproteins may indirectly control cellular translation machinery...|$|E

The friction and wear of the hydrogels were determined in a shaft(metal) -on-plate(hydrogel) type testing configuration under water lubrication. The hydrogel was transparent and exhibited very high equilibrium water content (> 99 wt %). The latter was less affected; however, the hydrogel became slightly more hazy after NB incorporation.

Modification by NB enhanced the ultimate compression strength and reduced the related compression strain.

30|$|Fe {{accumulation}} {{was followed}} by Zn in organs/tissues of Mastacembelus armatus. In the present study {{it was observed that}} Zn accumulation was highest in liver and least in integument. Highest accumulation of Zn in liver has also been reported in Clarias gariepinus (Coetzee et al. 2002), Channa punctatus (Murugan et al. 2008) and Labeo rohita (Javed and Usmani 2011) and least in integument of Channa punctatus (Javed and Usmani 2012 a). The reason for high accumulation of Zn in liver could be due to metallothionein (MT). These are low molecular weight proteins and their production increases due to elevated levels of heavy metals which bind to the metal in order to detoxify them, in doing so they concentrate and regulate metals in liver. In the present study it has also been observed that Zn content was lower in muscle than liver which could be due to the transference of Zn from muscle to other fish organs, and this <b>deloading</b> ability of fish has been reported to be advantageous to fish consumers (Madhusudan et al. 2003; Murugan et al. 2008). Zn accumulation was beyond the permissible limits (100 ppm) set by FAO/WHO (1989) in muscle of M. armatus. Although Zn is an essential element as it is carefully regulated by physiological mechanisms in most organisms (Eisler 1988), it is also regarded as a potential hazard that can endanger both animal and human health.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 7 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Turkey, 19 - 21 July, 2010. In {{the framework of the}} European Union project STORHY (Hydrogen Storage for Automotive Applications) a metal­-hydride storage tank with 8 kg sodium alanate has been recently built. A main challenge is the heat management of the system caused by the high energy flows during the exothermic loading of the hydride storage tank in relatively short periods. For the prediction of operation in passenger cars a model for the thermal behavior of this storage tank has been developed which takes into account the thermodynamic properties of the sodium alanate material as well as the reaction kinetics. These data have been derived by experiments and inserted into the balance equations. For different operating conditions an analysis has been performed. This refers to three different flow rates of the heat transfer fluid (trade name Marlotherm X). At the beginning the storage tank does not contain any hydrogen. The initial temperature of the system is 100 °C and the absorption pressure 100 bar. The inlet temperature of the heat transfer fluid has been set to 100 °C. The heat transfer coefficient between the storage elements and the heat transfer fluid depends on its flow rate. The transient absorption behavior of the storage tank has been calculated. Furthermore, it has been investigated to which extent the loading behavior can be accelerated by enhanced heat transfer due to insertion of flow baffles {{on the side of the}} heat transfer fluid. By simulation the potential for optimization of the tank geometry and the flow conditions for loading and <b>deloading</b> can be determined. ej 201...|$|E

In this thesis {{the effects of the}} different atherogenic lipoproteins, enzymatically modified LDL (E-LDL) and mildly oxidized LDL (Ox-LDL) on cellular cholesterol, sphingolipid and glycosphingolipid (GSL) metabolism, raft microdomain generation and cell surface receptor expression during in vitro foam cell formation and HDL 3 dependent <b>deloading</b> of human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) were analyzed. Total cell analysis of lipid loaded and deloaded MDM, using lipidomics, genomics and proteomics based on mass spectrometry, Affymetrix microarray analysis, Taqman RT-PCR, flow cytometry, image microscopy and western blot analysis, was applied to unravel key mechanisms underlying the regulation of cellular lipid influx, raft formation, lipid efflux and storage as well as surface expression of receptors involved in lipid uptake and processing. In {{the first part of this}} thesis apoE 3 / 3 homozygous MDM were analyzed. It could be demonstrated that E-LDL loading predominantly increased cellular cholesterol content, while Ox-LDL loading preferentially increased cellular ceramide (Cer) content. This may be due to a stronger mRNA upregulation of acid and neutral sphingomyelinase (SMPD 1, SMPD 2), neutral sphingomyelinase activation associated factor (NSMAF) as well as upregulation of glucosylceramidase during Ox-LDL loading compared with E-LDL loading. Ox-LDL in comparison to E-LDL also led to a higher cell surface expression of Cer and the Cer derived GSLs lactosylceramide (LacCer, CDw 17), dodecasaccharideceramide (CD 65 s), globotriaosylceramide (Gb 3 Cer, CD 77) as well as GM 1 -ganglioside. ApoE with its high affinity for Cer in contrast to apoA-I was mainly bound and internalized by Cer enriched Ox-LDL loaded cells. Ox-LDL preferentially induced cholesterol/Cer rich-membrane microdomains while E-LDL loading induced cholesterol/sphingomyelin microdomains as confirmed in situ by confocal microscopy and by mass spectrometry of isolated detergent resistant membranes. Microarray and flow cytometry analysis of the monocyte innate immunity receptor cluster revealed an induction of the complement system and of Fc-gamma-receptors with E-LDL but not with Ox-LDL loading. Further Ox-LDL induced mRNA and protein expression of ABCA 1 to a higher extent than E-LDL. ApoE protein expression and expression analyzed by flow cytometry was higher during E-LDL loading while apoC-I expression was higher during Ox-LDL loading. It is concluded that core-depleted E-LDL and surface oxidized Ox-LDL particles originating from the same LDL pool exert differential effects on cholesterol and sphingolipid metabolism as well as on cell surface receptor expression associated with the formation of different raft microdomains and thereby may trigger different macrophage effector functions during atherogenesis. In the second part of the thesis apoE 3 / 3 homozygous MDM were compared with MDM of the apoE 4 / 4 genotype and ABCA 1 deficient (Tangier) macrophages using the same incubation protocol with E-LDL and Ox-LDL loading and HDL 3 <b>deloading,</b> to search for genotype specific differences in lipid and GSL metabolism. GSL surface expression during Ox-LDL loading was higher in apoE 3 / 3 compared with apoE 4 / 4 and ABCA 1 deficient macrophages. Quantitative TaqMan-RT-PCR during Ox-LDL loading demonstrated no upregulation of acid SMase and a higher upregulation of acid ceramidase in apoE 4 / 4 compared to apoE 3 / 3 macrophages which could be the reason for the lower GSL surface expression of apoE 4 / 4 macrophages. E-LDL loaded apoE 3 / 3 macrophages demonstrated also a higher GSL surface expression compared with macrophages of a patient with hyperlipidemia and coronary heart disease. The apolipoproteins apoE, apoC-I and CETP which are involved in cholesterol and lipid metabolism were also analyzed in apoE 3 / 3, apoE 4 / 4 and ABCA 1 deficient macrophages. mRNA expression as well as the protein amount of secreted apoE and apoC-I was higher in apoE 3 / 3 than in apoE 4 / 4 macrophages. Additionally surface and intracellular expression of these proteins was different between the two different genotypes and ABCA 1 deficient macrophages...|$|E
3000|$|Once {{the rotor}} speed slows {{down to a}} low value, e.g., ω min, the {{overproduction}} process is terminated and the active power set point is reduced by a constant ΔP [...] up, so that the electrical power output is smaller than available mechanical power. For this reason, the rotor speed is {{able to return to}} previous MPPT point for a given wind speed or another operating point corresponding to current wind speed. By increasing this ΔP [...] up, the underproduction period tends to be shortened and meanwhile the wind turbine’s rotor speed can be restored to the MPP more rapidly. However, the SFD issue is likely to become more severe if much larger ΔP [...] up [...] is chosen. Thus, a TOP-based Improved Primary Frequency Response (IPFR) technique is proposed based on <b>deloaded</b> operation in [55] to eliminate the SFD issue and minimize the frequency deviation. Two other methods are proposed in [53, 54, 55, 56] for DFIGs and PMSGs by adding an incremental active power based on the MPPT curve or torque limit curve to enable the rotor speed converge to a stable point when TOP ends.|$|R
30|$|In {{contrast}} to synchronous generators, {{due to their}} asynchronous operation, the speed variation of Type 3 WTGs is {{much larger than the}} permissible system frequency variation. Their rotor speed can be controlled between 0.7 and 1.2 using modern power converters [62]. Their emulated inertial constant can be set as large as several times their inherent inertial constant in an auxiliary control loop. The partial-scale power converter (20 %– 30 % of full rating) in the rotor circuit of Type 3 WTGs imposes limitations on the <b>deloaded</b> operating level, maximum inertial response and rotational speed range (within ± 20 %–± 30 % of synchronous speed) [55]. Compared to Type 3 WTGs with the identical rated power capability and inertial constant, Type 4 WTGs are capable of providing stronger inertial response due to the wider operating range of their rotor speeds (0.5 – 1.2 p.u.) [34]. Moreover, the full-scale power converter allows Type 4 WTGs to possess a higher overloading capability, so that more temporary inertial power can be injected into grid for a short period [78]. In addition, Type 4 WTGs might utilize a larger amount of energy stored in the DC-link capacitor to enhance the emulated inertial response and compensate for the temporary power deficit during the rotor speed recovery [37].|$|R

We have shown that appropriately prepared Pd cathodes can reach high loadings in this new design and that the cells can {{be transferred to the}} calorimeter withoutdegradingthecathode’sorcel’sperformance. Inaloftheexperimentsthecathode <b>deloaded</b> at higher current densities, and ostensibly identical cathodes yield significantly different D:Pd loading/current density profiles. In the new cell design high purity Pd from IMRA Materials and Johnson Matthey have generally loaded better than recent lots of 99. 9 % Engelhard Pd. Pd that IMRA Materials cast in air with added CaB 6 held its loading best at higher current densities. Electrolyte additives Al, Si, Nd and Sm had no perceptible effect on loading behavior. The regular addition of Cl- ion, similar to what might happen when topping up open cells, can increase or maintain loading. The presence of Cu is detrimental to good loading. Electrochemical surface potential (Esurf) measurements made in H 2 SO 4 yield potentials similar to those predicted by high pressure H 2 loading experiments. LiOH (LiOD) significantly affects Esurf but that effect may be deconvolved to allow an estimate of the surface loading in alkaline electrolytes. 1...|$|R
