5|$|The Flapper awoke {{from her}} {{lethargy}} of sub-deb-ism, bobbed her hair, {{put on her}} choicest pair of earrings {{and a great deal}} of audacity and rouge and went into the battle. She flirted because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>fun</b> to flirt and wore a one-piece bathing suit because she had a good figure... she was conscious that the things she did were the things she had always wanted to do. Mothers disapproved of their sons taking the Flapper to dances, to teas, to swim and most of all to heart.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{praised the}} co-op mode highly but many disliked the single-player mode. Danielle Riendeau (Polygon) liked Monacos {{gameplay}} stating that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>fun</b> with other people, {{but it seemed}} that the single-player mode needed work. James Murff (GameFront) said the co-op was ridiculously fun and has good replayability. Marty Sliva (IGN) said that Monaco provided one of the best co-op experiences he'd had in a while. He stated that due to the gameplay and mechanics, {{it was one of the}} most unique and addictive games released in 2013. Scott Nichols (Digital Spy) said that the game contains lots to discover, but is best done cooperatively. Jeff Grubb (VentureBeat) praised the fact that the game works as both an arcade and a strategic game but said to skip it if the user wasn't planning on playing it cooperatively. Roger Hargreaves (Metro) liked the multiplayer mode more, but also praised the single-player mode calling it surprisingly compelling.|$|E

5|$|The {{scenes in}} which Cole {{appeared}} on the ship were done by using a harness {{as if she was}} flying. Because the actress wore green dress and makeup, the normal greenscreen was replaced by bluescreens in the studio. Cole felt <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>fun</b> to fly on the harness, but found it painful after a few hours. Gillan was allowed to perform several of her own stunts in the episode. She was excited to learn that her character would fight pirates with swords, and was taught how to handle one with basic moves. Gillan was also allowed to swing across the ship. However, a stunt double was required to film the sequence where Amy is thrown across the deck by the Siren. The sickbay set was also built in a studio. Because the beds were attached to strings, they were prone to swaying. The cast members who were asked to lie on the beds were instructed to stay still and not breathe heavily to limit movement.|$|E

I wouldn't want to live in that world, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>fun</b> to walk around on the moon for a day." ...|$|E

500|$|Enter the Dominatrix {{received}} [...] "mixed or average reviews", {{according to}} video game review score aggregator Metacritic. Chris Schilling of Eurogamer, citing the game's development history, called Enter the Dominatrix [...] "a fascinating {{case study in}} how games evolve". Electronic Gaming Monthly Eric Patterson also commented on how downloadable content in the industry is seen as content pulled from the retail release to be sold as an addition, which Enter the Dominatrix development history flips on its head. He added that {{in all of his}} industry experience, he had never otherwise seen a developer purposefully let its fans play [...] "shelved" [...] content, and thus found the experience [...] "fascinating". Official Xbox Magazine Mikel Reparaz said <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>fun</b> to see what [...] "could have been".|$|E

[...] Sinclair dismissed such concerns – [...] "I have qualms about seven-year-olds riding bicycles on the open road, but I have far fewer qualms about a 14-year-old driving one of these". Teenagers interviewed by The Guardian were doubtful about whether they would want a C5, commenting that while <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>fun</b> to drive they felt insecure in it and preferred their bicycles.|$|E

Jeff Martin was assigned to write the episode because he had done another flashback episode in the past, [...] "I Married Marge". Martin was excited to do another flashback episode because he thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>fun</b> to check out old newspapers and go back and see what was in the news back in 1983 and 1984. Martin felt it was a good way of finding a new set of things to make jokes about.|$|E
