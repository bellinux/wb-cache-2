5|$|All {{of these}} {{incidents}} made it <b>evident</b> <b>that</b> clearer guidelines were needed. There were two proposals for providing those guidelines.|$|E
5|$|As {{things had}} gone badly for the allies in France, it became <b>evident</b> <b>that</b> some thought {{needed to be}} given to the {{possibility}} of having to resist an attempted invasion of Britain by German forces.|$|E
5|$|As {{the flight}} {{approached}} Aspen–Pitkin County Airport, it became <b>evident</b> <b>that</b> {{some of the}} other inbound flights were performing missed approaches, as they had been unable to complete an instrument approach to the airport's runway. The airport is surrounded by high terrain on all sides and a fairly steep descent is required in order to land.|$|E
60|$|It's <b>evident</b> then <b>that</b> we have {{different}} views upon what is reasonable.|$|R
60|$|It was <b>evident</b> now <b>that</b> {{there was}} no longer any hope of concealment, and Stanley stepped to the entrance.|$|R

5|$|But when he contested {{the first}} World Championship match in 1886 against Johannes Zukertort, it became <b>evident</b> <b>that</b> Steinitz was playing on another level. Although Zukertort {{was at least}} Steinitz's equal in {{spectacular}} attacking play, Steinitz often outmaneuvered him fairly simply {{by the use of}} positional principles.|$|E
5|$|Digidesign {{was working}} on {{expanding}} ProTools from a single track to multitracking and {{it was hoped that}} as many as 48 digital tracks could be synced and used to record. The computers used were mostly Apple Quadra 400/500 models and with a great effort by all, it was soon <b>evident</b> <b>that</b> magnetic tape would have to be used.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} years of Heraclius's life, it became <b>evident</b> <b>that</b> a {{struggle}} was taking place between Heraclius Constantine and Martina, who was trying to position her son Heraklonas in line for the throne. When Heraclius died, he devised the empire to both Heraclius Constantine and Heraklonas to rule jointly with Martina as Empress.|$|E
60|$|He halted awkwardly, and {{his very}} <b>evident</b> fear <b>that</b> he had hurt her touched Saxon. She {{put her hand}} out to his.|$|R
60|$|It was <b>evident,</b> however, <b>that</b> the old giant that frowned on {{them was}} verging towards dissolution, {{for he was}} honey-combed in all directions.|$|R
6000|$|... "It makes not the {{slightest}} difference to me," [...] calmly returned Rushbrook, with such <b>evident</b> truthfulness <b>that</b> Leyton was both convinced and chagrined.|$|R
5|$|During the services, {{the news}} media made note that the {{security}} measures also made <b>evident</b> <b>that</b> the era of terrorism {{that the world was}} experiencing had its roots during the Reagan years. The worst act of terrorism against the United States prior to 9/11, the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, which killed 189 Americans, happened during the Reagan years.|$|E
5|$|It is <b>evident</b> <b>that</b> the mandibles {{were highly}} specialized. Like other Cretaceous ants, Zigrasimecia {{provides}} {{further evidence that}} the extinct ant fauna exhibited a great diversity of feeding behavior. The unusual mouthparts of Zigrasimecia are consistent with other extinct species found in Burmese, French, New Jersey and Canadian deposits, which also show morphologies not seen in extant ants.|$|E
5|$|Alex Krycek (seasons 2–9) {{is portrayed}} by Nicholas Lea. Krycek is a Russian-American, {{the son of}} Cold War immigrants, and first {{introduced}} as an FBI Special Agent assigned as a temporary investigation partner to Fox Mulder. Krycek proceeds to work with Mulder and attempts to gain his trust. However, it later becomes <b>evident</b> <b>that</b> Krycek is actually an undercover agent working for Cigarette Smoking Man. Krycek plays {{an important part in}} several events that are harmful to Mulder and Scully.|$|E
50|$|According to Ellacuría, {{there are}} two aspects to every university. The most <b>evident</b> one is <b>that</b> it deals with culture, or in other words, {{knowledge}} {{and the use of}} sentient intellect. The second, and not so <b>evident,</b> is <b>that</b> it must be concerned with the social reality, precisely because a university is inescapably a social force; it must transform and enlighten the society in which it lives.|$|R
6000|$|... "Git along wid your rubbish!" [...] {{retorted}} Susan as {{they crossed}} the street. It was <b>evident,</b> however, <b>that</b> she was much pleased with her gallant spouse.|$|R
5000|$|With crossed polarizers, {{moderate}} anisotropism becomes <b>evident,</b> so <b>that</b> {{the very}} fine lamellar twinning becomes distinct. It has hardness of 7 and calculated specific gravity of 4.46.|$|R
5|$|Although {{investigation}} of Preclassic remains is difficult at Motul de San José {{due to the}} overlying Late Classic construction, it is <b>evident</b> <b>that</b> the site experienced major growth during the Late Preclassic (300 BCAD 300) and became a sizeable centre. At roughly the same time, {{most of the major}} structures were built at Akte, and Chakokot experienced its earliest occupation during the Late Preclassic. In contrast, Buena Vista appears to have been lightly occupied. La Trinidad de Nosotros also underwent major expansion in the Late Preclassic and became larger and more important than Motul de San José, with its architectural layout being finalised in this period – later Classic period construction was superimposed upon pre-existing Late Preclassic structures.|$|E
5|$|Another {{witness who}} had {{attended}} the {{concert at the}} rear of the crowd testified that Blythe's behavior was standard to metal concerts, saying that metal bands always put on angry and tough acts and the concert at issue was no exception. She said that it was <b>evident</b> <b>that</b> Blythe did not want any fans on the stage. Neither the two nor any other witness who took the stand that day gave a testimony as to the moment of Nosek's fall at the end of the concert.|$|E
5|$|As regards proportionality, the law {{states that}} a self-defense {{may not be}} manifestly disproportionate. It is <b>evident,</b> <b>that</b> for a self-defense to be successful, {{it has to be}} {{performed}} on a level exceeding the attack. Unlike in case of necessity, the consequence of necessary self-defense may be more serious than consequence of the attack. The defense may not be restricted to a passive one, it can also be active. It is not the outcome of the incident but the sequence of actions at its beginning which determines who is to be deemed the attacker, and who is the party attacked.|$|E
60|$|It was <b>evident</b> then <b>that</b> my surmise {{had been}} correct. Unconscious cerebration was doing its work, {{even with the}} lunatic. I {{determined}} to have the matter out.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think it}} is quite time that you and he were separated," [...] Arnold declared. [...] "It is <b>evident,</b> nowadays, <b>that</b> he isn't {{responsible}} for his actions." ...|$|R

5|$|Aspasia {{was born}} in the Ionian Greek city of Miletus (in the modern {{province}} of Aydın, Turkey). Little is known about her family except that her father's name was Axiochus, although it is <b>evident</b> <b>that</b> she must have belonged to a wealthy family, for only the well-to-do could have afforded the excellent education that she received. Some ancient sources claim that she was a Carian prisoner-of-war turned slave; these statements are generally regarded as false.|$|E
5|$|Beetle fossils are {{abundant}} in the Cenozoic; by the Quaternary (up to 1.6 mya), fossil species are identical to living ones, while from the Late Miocene (5.7 mya) the fossils are still so close to modern forms that they are most likely the ancestors of living species. The large oscillations in climate during the Quaternary caused beetles to change their geographic distributions so much that current location gives little clue to the biogeographical history of a species. It is <b>evident</b> <b>that</b> geographic isolation of populations must often have been broken as insects moved {{under the influence of}} changing climate, causing mixing of gene pools, rapid evolution, and extinctions, especially in middle latitudes.|$|E
5|$|Burial PNT-002 was interred with Burial PNT-003 in {{the third}} stepped {{platform}} of the second version of the Lost World Pyramid (5C-54) prior to the fourth platform being completed. The deceased was an adult male aged between 36 and 55 years old; he was found lying extended on his back with a southeast-northwest orientation. Most of the bones were preserved to a certain degree; although the skull was badly fragmented it was <b>evident</b> <b>that</b> artificial craneal deformation had taken place. One of the upper canine teeth was fitted with pyrite decoration; the other canine had a crescent-shaped hollow that had once held its decoration. The deceased had several items of shell jewellery.|$|E
60|$|The man {{once more}} {{gazed at her}} with such <b>evident</b> bewilderment <b>that</b> Muriel broke into a little half-audible laugh. Then he grinned suddenly, and touched his {{battered}} cap.|$|R
60|$|And Bill struggles out, a muddy, trampled wreck, {{and in an}} {{unnecessarily}} aggressive mood—he {{being under}} the <b>evident</b> belief <b>that</b> the whole thing {{has been done on}} purpose.|$|R
60|$|When Marcia {{went with}} Bartley to call, Miss Kingsbury {{received}} her with careful, perhaps anxious politeness, but made no further effort {{to take her}} up. Some of the people whom Marcia met at Miss Kingsbury's called; and the Witherbys came, father, mother, and daughter together; but between the <b>evident</b> fact <b>that</b> the Hubbards were poor, and the other <b>evident</b> fact <b>that</b> they moved in the best society, the Witherbys did not quite {{know what to do}} about them. They asked them to dinner, and Bartley went alone; Marcia was not well enough to go.|$|R
5|$|Cuba and Puerto Rico, {{neither of}} which were {{expected}} to experience the worst of Dean's strength, prepared more modestly. Cuba's Civil Defense evacuated 350,000people from the coastal provinces. The government in Havana suspended all tourist programs ahead of the storm. Soldiers and emergency officials were prepared to convert schools and other government buildings into temporary shelters, but stood down when it became <b>evident</b> <b>that</b> they would not needed. The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) deployed a five-member team to Puerto Rico ahead of Hurricane Dean. They were equipped with satellite communication systems to provide video-teleconferencing and help make real-time assessments of any damage.|$|E
5|$|Denmark was {{an ally of}} the Habsburg Holy Roman Empire, and it was <b>evident</b> <b>that</b> Sweden was on {{the verge}} of yet another war with that country. A remedy was {{attempted}} by chancellor Nils Brahe, who traveled to Copenhagen in the spring of 1675 to try to get the Danish princess Ulrika Eleonora of Denmark engaged to the Swedish king. In mid-June 1675, the engagement was officially proclaimed. However, when news arrived of the Swedish defeat at the Battle of Fehrbellin, Danish king Christian V declared war on Sweden that September.|$|E
5|$|During {{the debate}} over {{defining}} URLs and URNs it became <b>evident</b> <b>that</b> the two concepts embodied by the terms were merely aspects of the fundamental, overarching notion of resource identification. In June 1994, the IETF published Berners-Lee's RFC 1630: the first Request for Comments that acknowledged the existence of URLs and URNs, and, more importantly, defined a formal syntax for Universal Resource Identifiers— URL-like strings whose precise syntaxes and semantics depended on their schemes. In addition, this RFC attempted to summarize the syntaxes of URL schemes in use at the time. It also acknowledged, but did not standardize, the existence of relative URLs and fragment identifiers.|$|E
50|$|Upon punctilious {{review it}} is <b>evident,</b> however, <b>that</b> {{none of these}} {{scholars}} have addressed systematically Rabbi Shamshon Hirschs demonstration that tzaraath refers to none of the diseases proposed above.|$|R

50|$|In humans, sexual bimaturism is <b>evident</b> in <b>that</b> males begin puberty {{later than}} females. This {{may be related}} to {{selection}} for later maturation in males in a polygynous mating system.|$|R
