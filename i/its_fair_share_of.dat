At Olympic, World and European events, home nation boxers (with the exception of N.Ireland) compete under the GB podium squad banner.

We explore household CF in housing (heating and electricity consumption), transport, food and goods and service sectors, which are the main household environmental pressure areas.

This study, however, does not cover capital investments in infrastructure (roads, public buildings etc.) which could increase total emission by almost a ton. The study emphasizes that attention must be paid to the lifestyles, infrastructure and institutions that result in considerable amounts of carbon being locked up in the household activities through which people meet their everyday needs.

40|$|In {{order to}} curtail the {{escalating}} packet loss rates caused by an exponential increase in network traffic, active queue management techniques such as Random Early Detection (RED) have come into picture. Flow Random Early Drop (FRED) keeps state based on instantaneous queue occupancy of a given flow. FRED protects fragile flows by deterministically accepting flows from low bandwidth connections and fixes several shortcomings of RED by computing queue length during both arrival and departure of the packet. Stochastic Fair Queuing (SFQ) ensures fair access to network resources and prevents a busty flow from consuming more than <b>its</b> <b>fair</b> <b>share.</b> In case <b>of</b> (Random Exponential Marking) REM, the key idea is to decouple congestion measure from performance measure (loss, queue length or delay).

40|$|The {{emergence}} of nomadic applications has raised intense research interest in providing Quality of Service (QoS) in Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs). In the networking protocol stack, a QoS capable {{medium access control}} (MAC) protocol plays an important role. However, currently, the widely deployed MAC protocol IEEE 802. 11 Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) does not provide any QoS guarantee and suffers from a problem of fairness. In this thesis, we formulate the design of MAC protocols as the problem of bandwidth allocation to individual links. The concept of conflict graph is adopted to model the contention relations between link flows in ad hoc networks, and based on this modeling, different algorithms are proposed {{to address the problem}} {{in such a way that}} the obtained MAC protocols for MANETs satisfy QoS objectives such as fairness or a minimal bandwidth guarantee. Firstly, a distributed max-min fair allocation algorithm is proposed to enable each node in the ad hoc network to calculate the max-min <b>fair</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> links based on the two-hops away link flow information. Once each link flow is assigned <b>its</b> <b>fair</b> <b>share</b> and those <b>of</b> <b>its</b> neighbors, a measurement based backoff algorithm presented in the thesis can be invoked to achieve weighted fairness. Secondly, in order to reduce the communication overheads and meet different fairness objectives, the fair bandwidth allocation problem is also modeled as a general utility based constrained maximization problem. By invoking the Lagrange relaxation and duality, both a non-cooperative and a cooperative game formulation of the problem are proposed. The algorithm derived from the non-cooperative game framework does not depend on any local flow information or contentions. The algorithm derived from the cooperative game framework depends only on one-hop link flow information. The fairness objective of these algorithms is controlled by the adopted utility function. Simulations and numerical results have shown that all these solutions not only provide better fairness than the IEEE 802. 11 DCF but also have the capability of quantifying the bandwidth, which is crucial to other processes such as admission control. As an alternative to this class of algorithms that are all based on random access technique, a series of collision-free scheduling algorithms are proposed to guarantee a minimal bandwidth. In these algorithms, with the help of one-hop local flow information, each node determines a local collision-free transmission schedule for all its link flows...|$|R

The trade between Liverpool and Carlisle, the trade between Liverpool and Dundee, and the trade between Liverpool and Lancashire and the districts to the north and west … is very extensive indeed. The trade between Belfast… and other ports of Ireland and these districts is also extensive… So far as regards Liverpool at any rate, it would have been perfectly competent for other railway companies possessing the intervening route by railway… to prevent the participation of the North British Company in <b>its</b> just and <b>fair</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> that large traffic between Liverpool and the districts I have mentioned. Had the North British Company been unable to take an independent route of its own, uncontrolled by the railway companies, it would have been extremely difficult to have obtained a <b>fair</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> the traffic; and in respect to Ireland, if there had been no means of forwarding the traffic which which may arrive at Carlisle and Silloth from the North British system, we should have been deprived <b>of</b> our <b>fair</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> the traffic which flows naturally between the two countries The Caledonian and London and North Western railways refused the NBR any <b>share</b> <b>of</b> unconsigned rail traffic for Scotland arriving at Carlisle (and obstructed traffic arriving at Carlisle over the Waverly Route) {{on the grounds that the}} NBR was an East Coast Company and not entitled to a <b>share</b> <b>of</b> West Coast traffic as well. Coastal steamers were competitive with railways on price, and there were therefore traffic-sharing and price-fixing arrangements between railways and coastal steamship companies for traffic down both sides of Britain (East Coast railways with North Sea steamers; West Coast railways with Irish Sea steamers). [...] The NBR, however, was not party to the West Coast & Irish Sea agreement and could therefore undercut it and develop considerable trade from the East of Scotland (e.g. Dundee) to Liverpool via Silloth, both lucrative in itself and a useful means to exert pressure on the West Coast Companies the L&NWR duly offered to relax its blockade on NBR freight arriving at Carlisle if the aggressive pricing of the Silloth route stopped. [...] The Silloth route lost its importance for bargaining in 1876 with the completion of the Settle-Carlisle line and the arrival of the Midland Railway in Carlisle, but the trade through it was still of interest to the NBR; although the Belfast service proved unprofitable and was abandoned there was a daily steamer service to and from Liverpool until October 1918, and a twice-weekly service to and from Dublin which made Silloth one of the major ports of entry for Irish cattle.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} achieve current climate change goals, Australia needs to use a {{long-term}} carbon budget approach to properly assess the risks, responsibilities and realities <b>of</b> doing <b>its</b> <b>fair</b> <b>share.</b> Australia’s carbon laws and international negotiations are based on avoiding more than two degrees global warming above pre-industrial levels. To have good chance of achieving this, no more than 1, 500 billion tonnes of carbon pollution can be released to 2050. Defining Australia’s <b>fair</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> the global carbon budget is a complex task, but it is critical if short-term targets are to be set with clear reference to avoiding dangerous climate change. Australia’s current high levels of per capita carbon pollution make this particularly challenging. Like any budget, the more you spend early the less you have for later. If targets are set without reference to a long-term and fair national carbon budget, more draconian emissions reductions will be required after 2020 to meet national goals and international commitments. This report argues that Australia needs to use a long-term carbon budget approach to properly recognise the risks, responsibilities and realities in doing <b>its</b> <b>fair</b> <b>share</b> in helping achieve climate change goals set in the national interest...|$|R
