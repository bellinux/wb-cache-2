40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} the co-branding arrangement between BP (<b>service</b> <b>stations)</b> and Wild Bean Caf頨a caf頣oncept created by BP in Australia in 2004). Co-branding is an increasingly popular form of growth in a maturing franchise sector. This case study {{presents a}}n organisational view of co-branding. Thus extending existing literature that has previously focused on product specific co-branding. The study reveals that motivations for introducing the Wild Bean Caf頢rand into <b>existing</b> BP <b>service</b> <b>stations</b> include alignment of a suitable business model with existing BP products, risk aversion to the use of externally owned brands, reinvigorating the BP brand, and stimulating sales growth for appropriate outlets.

40|$|Leaking {{underground}} fuel {{storage tanks}} (USTs) {{are the main}} source of petroleum hydrocarbon contamina-tion of soil and groundwater. The distribution and fl ow of the leaked hydrocarbon is infl uenced by capillary and gravity forces. Depending on the leaked volume and the soil properties, the hydrocarbon could exist as a residual phase completely held in the soil above the water table or as both free phase product and residual. Various components of gasoline will affect the groundwater quality and each will spread according to its own characteristics. The pollution processes are studied through the development of a combination of two models: a compositional and a potential fl ow model. The former was developed using the mass balance principle and is capable of using the organic compound and the subsurface properties to predict the concentration of the various components of benzene, toluene and xylene (BTX) mixture in a leachate from a site contaminated by a residual mixture. Potential fl ow theory was utilized to model the advective transport of contaminants towards municipal wells. Capture zones were defi ned and travel times for different municipal wells were estimated for a sample study area at a coastal city in eastern Saudi Arabia. Modeling and fi eld survey indicated the high potential for groundwater pollution and concluding that more effort should be directed to promote leak prevention through management strategies that include developing proper design regulations and installation requirements like monitoring wells for new and <b>existing</b> <b>service</b> <b>stations...</b>|$|R

Realizing the importance of energy, natural gas can be alternative energy source which is more effective and cheap compared to electricity. The main objective of this project is to design the distribution line of natural gas to all residential college units (UKK) at Universiti Malaysia Pahang (UMP) located at Gambang, Kuantan. UMP is located near to gas <b>service</b> <b>station,</b> approximately 500 m with the <b>existing</b> gas <b>service</b> <b>station</b> in Gambang, it is convenient way to tap the natural gas at future point to UMP. Currently, student’s cafeteria using LPG bulk storage for cooking {{and it is not}} continuously supply and can disturb their production. Besides that, student also have water heater in their hostel, thus it will affect the electricity bill for every month. The scope of this project are the {{consumption of}} load demand that can accommodate for all residential college unit and student’s cafeteria, network piping calculation using Cox’s equation by calculation of load and determine the classification of polyethylene pipe construction, and lastly using PDMS software to draw the pipeline. The method that been used are to calculate all piping size and gas load demand by using Cox’s equation according to standard such as MS 930 and ASME B 31. 8 {{to make sure that the}} piping design is safe for the construction. As the result, the total pressure drop from the source to load consumer is below 15 % which is acceptable for designing pipeline. The Medium Density polyethylene (MDPE) pipe is use for distribution line construction. Lastly, the piping sizes for MDPE pipe are 2 inches and 3 inches. As the conclusion, natural gas can reduce about 50 % the utilities cost compare to electricity...|$|R
