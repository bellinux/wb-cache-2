On 28 September 2007, former Solicitor General and retired Senator of the College of Justice, Lord McCluskey, gave an interview to The Herald stating that he believed Lord Hamilton had no grounds to accuse Elish Angiolini of threatening the independence of the judiciary.

2500|$|A {{year after}} the massacre, an {{analysis}} by officials at the U.S. Secret Service of 37 premeditated school shootings found that bullying, which some of the shooters described [...] "in terms that approached torment", played the major role in {{more than two-thirds of}} the attacks. A similar theory was expounded by Brooks Brown in his book on the massacre; he noted that teachers commonly looked the other way when confronted with bullying, and that whenever Klebold and Harris were the recipients of such incidents from the jocks at Columbine, they would make statements such as: [...] "Don't worry, man. <b>It</b> <b>happens</b> <b>all</b> the time!"
