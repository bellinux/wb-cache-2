40|$|Software {{engineering}} {{has been}} facing a crisis {{for several years}} now - there is more demand for new software than there is ability to supply. Software reuse is a potential way to tackle the problems caused by the software crisis with its promises of increased productivity and cheaper development costs. Several software reuse successes have been reported, but these have been predominantly in large, well structured companies. However, there are numerous smaller companies that could also benefit from reuse if it were made available to them. This thesis addresses these issues by implementing a reuse programme in a small company. An incremental approach to reuse introduction is adopted, following the Seven Steps to Success, and 'lightweight' processes are recommended to support the reuse programme. A prototype tool set, ReThree- C++, was developed to automate support for the reuse programme. The results of the case study are presented. The reuse programme was successful, with benefits to the company including both increased speed of production and financial gains from selling reusable components. The challenges faced are also identified. Details of the tool set giving automated support for reuse are also presented. The tool set is an approach to reuse repository control which also integrates information abstraction from C++ source code to generate class <b>hierarchy</b> <b>charts</b> and software documentation automatically. It helps developers store, retrieve, understand and use reusable components. The usefulness of the tool set is shown with an experiment and as part of the case study. The purpose of the thesis is to show that small companies can implement reuse, and that the method presented supports the introduction of a reuse programme. It concludes that although challenges were faced, great benefits can be gained by using the method with automated support for reuse in a small company...|$|R

This study joins new scholarship that reperiodizes the Civil Rights era while also considering how violence and radicalism shaped the civil rights struggle. It places the criminal justice system at the heart of both an older racial order and within a prison-made civil rights movement that confronted the prison's power to deny citizenship and enforce racial <b>hierarchies.</b> By <b>charting</b> the trajectory of the civil rights movement in Texas prisons, my dissertation demonstrates how the internal struggle over rehabilitation and punishment shaped civil rights, racial formation, and the political contest between liberalism and conservatism. This dissertation offers a close case study of Texas, where the state prison system emerged as a national model for penal management. The dissertation begins with a hopeful story of reform marked by an apparently successful effort by the State of Texas to replace its notorious 1940 s plantation/prison farm system with an efficient, business-oriented agricultural enterprise system. When this new system was fully operational in the 1960 s, Texas garnered plaudits as a pioneering, modern, efficient, and business oriented Sun Belt state. But this reputation of competence and efficiency obfuscated the reality of a brutal system of internal prison management in which inmates acted as guards, employing coercive means to maintain control over the prisoner population. The inmates whom the prison system placed in charge also ran an internal prison economy in which money, food, human beings, reputations, favors, and sex all became commodities to be bought and sold. I analyze both how the Texas prison system managed to maintain its high external reputation for so long in the face of the internal reality and how that reputation collapsed when inmates, inspired by the Civil Rights Movement, revolted. My dissertation shows that this inmate Civil Rights rebellion was a success in forcing an end to the existing system but a failure in its attempts to make conditions in Texas prisons more humane. The new Texas prison regime, I conclude, utilized paramilitary practices, privatized prisons, and gang-related warfare to establish a new system that focused much more on law and order in the prisons than on the legal and human rights of prisoners. Placing the inmates and their struggle at the heart of the national debate over rights and "law and order" politics reveals an inter-racial social justice movement that asked the courts to reconsider how the state punished those who committed a crime while also reminding the public of the inmates' humanity and their constitutional rights...|$|R

40|$|Faculties at the University of Liège, {{just like}} so many of their {{academic}} colleagues worldwide, have to write and orally present a syllabus for each of their courses every year. Although very demanding, this effort is clearly described by many authors as an important opportunity to make a decisive first impression and to favourably affect students’ attitude and perceptions toward a given course regarding their personal needs and motivation notably. Even if the hypothesis seem plausible and inspiring for practice at first sight, the likelihood of a given syllabus to actually impact those perfection in the right way still has to be experienced. So, for a syllabus whose qualities / characteristics seem to make it likely or not to impact positively or negatively learners’ perceptions of courses linked to their motivation and individual needs, will consistent effects be observed on the ones who have read / heard it? Among the students’ perceptions that an effective syllabus would be likely to positively impact according to the literature, some appear to correspond to the three determining factors of the motivational dynamics’ model from Roland Viau [1997]: the perception of controllability [Bain, 2004; Lang, 2006; Hudd, 2003], the perception of activities value [Wasley, 2008, Hammons & Shock, 1994; Johnson, 2006] and the perception of competency [Slattery & Carlson, 2005; Madson, Melchert, Whipp, 2004]. Other theoretical benefits of the syllabus on students’ attitude refer to the “consideration of what students need in order to be successful learners” [Hess & Whittington, 2003] or the support of “developmental needs of the students” [Haugen, 1998]. Here, items used to check learners’ perceptions and to observe if “the syllabus addresses {{the question of whether the}} class will meet student needs” [Birdsall, 1989] have been closely related to the levels of Abraham Maslow’s <b>Hierarchy</b> of Needs <b>Chart.</b> In 2008, within its mandatory program of pedagogical training for new faculties, the IFRES (Institute for Training and Research in Higher Education) has created a thematic seminar offering guidelines to promote syllabi aiming notably to motivate students and meet developmental needs. At the beginning of the following academic year, ten syllabi and introduction speeches - meant to Freshmen or Sophomores and designed by ten faculties who followed the seminar - were collected and recorded in order to be analyzed. Their likelihood to impact the targeted students’ perceptions was then rated according to criteria rigorously derived from literature. During the second class of the ten teachers, questionnaires were submitted to their 1300 First/Second-Year students in order to investigate the possible corollary impact of those transmitted pieces of information on their concerned perceptions. In order to measure hypothetical gains due to syllabi, couples of symmetrical pre and post items were included. Data collected from the students concerning their post perceptions and their answers about their reading / hearing or not of their respective syllabi /oral speeches are currently crossed. Chi squares are calculated to identify significant relationships between them, as well as correlations indexes. Afterwards, synoptic tables are produced to observe consistencies between ratings of teachers’ performances and students’ levels of declared perceptions. At this stage, it appears that variables regarding motivation are clearly independent for about 2 / 3 of the studied relations. Nevertheless, considering the cases where the X²test indicate links between the data, concrete consistencies can be observed between the ratings obtained from the content analysis of syllabi or speeches and the observed percentages of students declaring good perceptions. Besides, the comparison of the percentages of students declaring good perceptions before and after having received syllabi and speeches clearly indicate frequent consistencies with the syllabi’s ratings on the same variables. Looking at the impressive number of universities everywhere asking or urging their teachers to produce syllabi for each of their courses, it seems obvious that this task has become a classic in any faculty’s pedagogical practice. This generalization also seems to indicate a consensus on the fact that this effort make sense and can be useful, particularly for students. This research aims to objectify this usefulness in order to guide and promote professors’ reflection on effective syllabus - for instance in the context of a regulated training seminar -, especially since it is also considered to benefit as planning tool for faculties [Littlefield, 1999; Matejka & Kurke, 1994; Sinor & Kaplan], or as permanent record for promotions or program consistency [Parkes & Harris, 2002; Leibow, 2003; Seldin, 1998].

In order to make the best use of money, government activities must be bound for success, and consequently great emphasis must be put on the preparation and prospects of these activities. Meanwhile, Taiwan’s social culture is a mixture of traditional culture and diverse exotic ones, all of which are rich elements conducive to the development of Taiwan’s cultural and creative industries (CCI). Furthermore, it is also hoped it will be possible to bring a creative momentum to other industries and further establish a global status for Taiwan’s culture and economy while promoting CCI development. This paper aims to identify the assessment criteria for the critical success factors of the cultural activities of Taiwan’s county and city governments, and develop a <b>hierarchy</b> <b>chart</b> by inducing, aggregating and analyzing related literature and documents.

Teachers need a system that nearly duplicates the software that they are currently using to enter, store, and calculate their grades, while school administrators and parents need to student and teacher 2 ̆ 7 s information. This is where the use of e-commerce technology comes in very nicely. The analysis performed for this project involved extensive interviews with the expert user set and a walk-through of the current system. The majority of the interviews were with the teachers.

40|$|This paper {{details the}} {{theoretical}} foundations {{of a system}} for teaching repertory grid concepts and the practical approach for its implementation. This will involve {{a discussion of the}} development of the production program for KAGES (Knowledge Acquisition for Geographic Expert Systems) and the enhancements necessary to make it an effective teaching tool. Initial student reaction to the method will also be presented. The traditional approach to knowledge acquisition for expert systems has been via interview. However deeper knowledge can be elicited using repertory grid techniques which get domain experts to rank objects against concepts. The technique based on Kelly’s Personal Construct Theory has been well proven by Boose et. al (1987). The current study grew out of the development of a repertory grid program, developed for the KAGES toolkit, which will consist of several knowledge acquisition tools for use in the development of spatial expert systems. By expanding the system to show intermediate workings and grids {{it was found that the}} system was a good method of explaining repertory grid techniques and the associated hierarchical clustering which is very difficult to demonstrate using traditional techniques. The system initially interacts with the student over a chosen domain (which does not have to be geographic) to elicit a series of objects or classifications to create a grid. The domain can be either of the student’s or the facilitator’s choice. The student is then stepped through the various manipulations of the grid. These grids are then subject to hierarchical cluster analysis which the student is also stepped through until a <b>hierarchy</b> <b>chart</b> showing clustering is produced...|$|E

Their compatibility with the current Constitution of 1997 raises certain doubts, while the regulations themselves contain some anachronisms and constitute an isolated phenomenon in the national legal system. What is more, these acts exist in separation from their primary historical context, including the axiological context and the context of the constitutional rights, which is particularly noticeable with regards the relationships between the State and religious unions. As it happens, the standards deriving from those laws have either entirely, or at least partially disappeared due to the desuetudo. From the perspective of a behaviourist approach, acts adopted in 1932 and 1938 are no longer binding whereas those of 1928 and 1936 have largely lost their applicability today. Further, the importance of pre-war religious legislation in the contemporary legal system in Poland is signifi cantly reduced. Most regulations, save for those of organisational nature or pertaining to the legal nature of religious unions and their organisational bodies, are impractical, inapplicable and out of use. What is more, these acts in their current form are not compatible with the principle of citizens’ confi dence in the state and obstruct development of confessional communities, and even undermine the State’s authority. As such they should be urgently repealed or modified. 4861813 Studia Prawa Publiczneg...|$|E
