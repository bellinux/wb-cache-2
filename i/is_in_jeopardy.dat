5|$|However, Wilson defends House when House's career <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>jeopardy,</b> after billionaire {{entrepreneur}} {{and then}} chairman of Princeton-Plainsboro's Board Edward Vogler (Chi McBride) proposes a motion for House's dismissal. Wilson {{is the only}} one to vote against the motion. In response, Vogler proposes and succeeds in obtaining Wilson's dismissal, but Wilson is soon reinstated thanks to Cuddy after she convinces the board that Vogler is the real threat to the hospital and his money is not worth his business-obsessed mindset. In a late Season episode it is revealed that Wilson suffers from clinical depression and takes medication. Wilson is also seen to write with his left hand, a trait he shares with Cuddy and Foreman, but when he performs detailed medical work, such as injections or incisions, or gesticulates while speaking, appears to be right-handed in general, suggesting he may be ambidextrous.|$|E
25|$|Abortion: a {{disciplinary}} council may be held for any member who submits to, performs, encourages, pays for, or otherwise arranges an abortion. However, councils are not held for persons {{involved in an}} abortion if the pregnancy resulted from rape or forcible incest, if {{the life of the}} mother <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>jeopardy,</b> or if it is shown that the fetus has severe defects which will not allow it to survive the birth.|$|E
25|$|Violet rings {{have several}} unique abilities. They can create {{crystals}} {{which can be}} used to imprison members of other Lantern Corps on Zamaron. Over time, the rings of the prisoners trapped in stasis within the crystals are infected with violet energy. After spending enough time inside, the prisoner will emerge as a Star Sapphire. The rings can also detect when a love <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>jeopardy,</b> locate it, and then create a connection to the embattled heart that {{can be used as a}} tether. Sapphires are also shown as being able to show others their greatest love. Unlike constructs created by Green Lanterns, Orange Lanterns cannot absorb those made by Star Sapphires. Star Sapphires appear to be able to teleport in order to escape attackers, while their energy constructs release a disorienting dust when destroyed. These two abilities can be combined effectively to avoid being pursued. Violet power rings have the ability to restore the recently deceased to life by drawing power from the heart of one that loves them.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{strong voice}} against Fortuño was NPP former President Leo Díaz. Díaz accused Fortuño {{and his wife}} of having ties to PDP law firms and to {{colonialist}} interests. At a November 4, 2007, rally called [...] "Con Fuerza para Vencer" [...] (With the Strength to Win), Díaz said, [...] "In this primary the life of this party <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>jeopardy.</b> The other candidate, Fortuño, isn't a real statehood defender! He should explain why he has ties with PDP's law firms and why the colonialist special interests are financing his campaign".

2500|$|In the U.S., {{an accused}} person is {{entitled}} to a government-paid defense attorney {{if he or she}} <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>jeopardy</b> of losing his or her life and/or liberty. Those who cannot afford a private attorney may be provided one by the state. [...] Historically, however, the right to a defense attorney has not always been universal. [...] For example, in Tudor England criminals accused of treason were not permitted to offer arguments in their defense. [...] In many jurisdictions, there is no right to an appointed attorney, if the accused is not in jeopardy of losing his or her liberty.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the reasons}} this {{is seen as an}} evil act is because a human rebirth is seen as a {{precious}} and unique opportunity to do good deeds and attain liberation. The Jataka stories contain tales of women who perform abortions being reborn in a hell. In the case where the mother's life <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>jeopardy,</b> many traditional Buddhists agree that abortion is permissible. This is the only legally permissible reason for abortion in Sri Lanka and is also a view accepted in the Tibetan tradition as argued by Ganden Tri Rinpoche. In the case of rape, however, most Buddhists argue that following an act of violence by allowing 'another kind of violence towards another individual' would not be ethical. Aborting a fetus that is malformed is also seen as immoral by most Buddhists.|$|E

And what shall I do the whilst!--he will have his throat cut, the poor lad, as sure as I was born at the foot of Roseberry-Topping. Could I find some one to hold the horses! but they are as sharp here north-away as in canny Yorkshire herself, and quit bridle, quit titt, as we say. An I could but see one of our folks now, a holly-sprig were worth a gold tassel; or could I but see one of the Regent's men--but to leave the horses to a stranger, that I cannot--and to leave the place while the lad <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>jeopardy,</b> that I wonot." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And now, {{gentlemen of}} the jury, let me recapitulate to you {{the history of this}} lady as far {{as it relates to the}} {{diamonds}} as to which my client is now in jeopardy. You have heard on the testimony of Mr. Camperdown that they were not hers at all,--that, at any rate, they were not supposed to be hers by those in whose hands was left the administration of her husband's estate, and that when they were first supposed to have been stolen at the inn at Carlisle, he had already commenced legal steps for the recovery of them from her clutches. A bill in Chancery had been filed because she had obstinately refused to allow them to pass out of her hands. It has been proved to you by Lord Fawn that though he was engaged to marry her, he broke his engagement because he supposed her possession of these diamonds to be fraudulent and dishonest." [...] This examination had been terrible to the unfortunate Under-Secretary;--and had absolutely driven him away from the India Board and from Parliament for a month. [...] "It has been proved to you that when the diamonds were supposed to have vanished at Carlisle, she there committed perjury. That she did so she herself stated on oath in that evidence which she gave before the magistrate when my client was committed, and which has, as I maintain, improperly and illegally been used against my client at this trial." [...] Here the judge looked over his spectacles and admonished the learned serjeant, that his argument on that subject had already been heard, and the matter decided. [...] "True, my lord; but my conviction of my duty to my client compels me to revert to it. Lady Eustace committed perjury at Carlisle, having the diamonds in her pocket at the very moment in which she swore that they had been stolen from her. And if justice had really been done in this case, gentlemen, it is Lady Eustace who should now be on her trial before you, and not my unfortunate client. Well,--what is the next that we hear of it? It seems that she brought the diamonds up to London; but how long she kept them there, nobody knows. It was, however, necessary to account for them. A robbery is got up between a young woman who seems to have been the confidential friend rather than the maid of Lady Eustace, and that other witness whom you have heard testifying against himself, and who is, of all the informers that ever came into my hands, the most flippant, the most hardened, the least conscientious, and the least credible. That they two were engaged in a conspiracy I cannot doubt. That Lady Eustace was engaged with them, I will not say. But I will ask you to consider whether such may not probably have been the case. At any rate, she then perjures herself again. She gives a list of the articles stolen from her, and omits the diamonds. She either perjures herself a second time,--or else the diamonds, in regard to which my client <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>jeopardy,</b> were not in the house at all, and could not then have been stolen. It may very probably have been so. Nothing more probable. Mr. Camperdown and the managers of the Eustace estate had gradually come to a belief that the Carlisle robbery was a hoax,--and, therefore, another robbery is necessary to account for the diamonds. Another robbery is arranged, and this young and beautiful widow, as bold as brass, again goes before the magistrate and swears. Either the diamonds were not stolen, or else again she commits a second perjury.|$|E
