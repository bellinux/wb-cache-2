40|$|Driven by the {{information}} age, {{a paradigm shift}} is starting {{to occur in the}} urban water planning and management field, mainly due to the introduction of advanced metering and communications technologies. This chapter explores the potential role of <b>intelligent</b> water <b>metering</b> systems, and the smart application of resultant data sets for the future of water planning and management in the built environment. <b>Intelligent</b> water <b>meters</b> essentially perform three functions; they automatically and electronically capture, collect and communicate up-to-date water usage readings on a real-time (or nearly real-time) basis. To translate this data into useful information, a comprehensive <b>intelligent</b> water <b>metering</b> system is required, which integrates high-resolution metering (e. g., 0. 01 ?l; 5 ?sec), communication technologies (e. g., GPRS) and information management systems, in order to provide real-time information on how, when and where water is being consumed for the customer and water business. This chapter seeks to promote the uptake and application of <b>intelligent</b> water <b>metering</b> systems by examining the benefits and drivers of, and barriers to, <b>intelligent</b> <b>metering.</b> Specifically, it presents applicable examples of where <b>intelligent</b> <b>metering</b> systems can significantly enhance current activities in terms of citywide urban planning, infrastructure planning, water demand management and customer satisfaction.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} drivers, {{development}} and global deployment of <b>intelligent</b> water <b>metering</b> {{in the urban}} context. Recognising that <b>intelligent</b> <b>metering</b> (or smart metering) {{has the potential to}} revolutionise customer engagement and management of urban water by utilities, this paper provides a summary of the knowledge-base for researchers and industry practitioners to ensure that the technology fosters sustainable urban water management. To date, roll-outs of <b>intelligent</b> <b>metering</b> have been driven by the desire for increased data regarding time of use and end-use (such as use by shower, toilet, garden, etc.) {{as well as by the}} ability of the technology to reduce labour costs for meter reading. Technology development in the water sector generally lags that seen in the electricity sector. In the coming decade, the deployment of <b>intelligent</b> water <b>metering</b> will transition from being predominantly "pilot or demonstration scale" with the occasional city-wide roll-out, to broader mainstream implementation. This means that issues which have hitherto received little focus must now be addressed, namely: the role of real-time data in customer engagement and demand management; data ownership, sharing and privacy; technical data management and infrastructure security, utility workforce skills; and costs and benefits of implementation.
