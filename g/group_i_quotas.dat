40|$|The {{activation}} of <b>group</b> <b>I</b> metabotropic glutamate receptor (<b>group</b> <b>I</b> mGlus) {{has been shown}} to produce neuroprotective or neurotoxic effects. In this study, we investigated the effects of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a precursor of the antioxidant glutathione, on <b>group</b> <b>I</b> mGlus activation in apoptosis of glial C 6 and MN 9 D cell lines, and a rat model of Parkinson’s disease (PD). We demonstrated that NAC protected against apoptosis through modulation of <b>group</b> <b>I</b> mGlus activity. In glial C 6 cells, NAC promoted phosphorylation of ERK induced by (s) - 3, 5 - dihydroxy-phenylglycine (DHPG), an agonist of <b>group</b> <b>I</b> mGlus. NAC enhanced the <b>group</b> <b>I</b> mGlus-mediated protection from staurosporine (STS) -induced apoptosis following DHPG treatment. Moreover, in rotenone-treated MN 9 D cells and PD rat model, NAC protected against <b>group</b> <b>I</b> mGlus-induced toxicity by compromising the decrease in phosphorylation of ERK, phosphorylation or expression level of TH. Furthermore, the results showed that NAC prohibited the level of ROS and oxidation of cellular GSH/GSSG (Eh) accompanied by activated <b>group</b> <b>I</b> mGlus in the experimental models. Our results suggest that NAC might act as a regulator of <b>group</b> <b>I</b> mGlus-mediated activities in both neuroprotection and neurotoxicity via reducing the oxidative stress, eventually to protect cell survival.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the role of <b>group</b> <b>I</b> metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) in mammalian spinal motor networks and investigated the potential role of mGluRs in the fatal neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). <b>Group</b> <b>I</b> mGluR activation was found to modulate locomotor-related activity recorded from ventral roots of in vitro mouse spinal cord preparations. Activation of <b>group</b> <b>I</b> mGluRs led {{to an increase in}} the frequency of locomotor-related bursts and a decrease in their amplitude. The cellular mechanisms underlying <b>group</b> <b>I</b> mGluR-mediated modulation were investigated using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from spinal neurons. Recordings from motoneurons revealed a wide range of effects, some of which were expected to increase motoneuron excitability, such as membrane depolarisation and hyperpolarisation of action potential thresholds. However, the net modulatory effect of <b>group</b> <b>I</b> mGluR activation was a reduction in motoneuron excitability, likely reflecting a reduction in the density of fast inactivating Na+ currents. The activation of <b>group</b> <b>I</b> mGluRs also reduced excitatory synaptic input to motoneurons, suggesting that modulation of motoneuron properties and synaptic transmission both contribute to <b>group</b> <b>I</b> mGluR-mediated reductions in locomotor motoneuron output. Recordings from spinal interneurons revealed a smaller range of modulatory effects for <b>group</b> <b>I</b> mGluRs. The clearest effect on interneurons, membrane depolarisation, may underlie <b>group</b> <b>I</b> mGluR-mediated increases in the frequency of locomotor activity. Finally, the potential role of <b>group</b> <b>I</b> mGluRs in the pathogenesis of ALS was investigated using a mouse model of the disease. Although no major perturbations in <b>group</b> <b>I</b> mGluR-mediated modulation were demonstrated in ALS affected spinal cords, there appeared to be a difference in the intrinsic excitability of spinal interneurons between wild type and ALS affected animals. Together these data highlight <b>group</b> <b>I</b> mGluRs as important sources of neuromodulation within the spinal cord and potential targets for the treatment of ALS.

40|$|Background. In this report, {{we compare}} the {{long-term}} outcome of pediatric liver transplantation (LTx) patients maintained with tacrolimus-based and with cyclosporine (CsA) -based immunosuppressive therapy. We examine long-term patient and graft survival, {{the incidence of}} rejection, and immunosuppression-related complications. Method. There were 233 consecutive primary LTx in children (ages < 18 years) performed between October 1989 and December 1994 with tacrolimus-based immunosuppressive therapy (<b>Group</b> <b>I).</b> These were compared with 120 consecutive primary LTx performed with CsA-based immunosuppressive therapy between January 1988 and October 1989 (Group II). Children in both groups were followed until July 1999. Mean follow-up was 91. 41 ± 17. 7 months (range 55. 6 - 117. 8) for <b>Group</b> <b>I,</b> and 128 ± 6. 1 months (range 116. 7 - 138. 6) for Group II. Results. At 9 years of follow-up, actuarial patient and graft survival were significantly improved (patient survival 85. 4 % in <b>Group</b> <b>I</b> vs. 63. 8 % in Group II, P= 0. 0001; graft survival <b>Group</b> <b>I</b> 78. 9 % vs. 60. 8 % Group II, P= 0. 0003) {{and the rate of}} re -transplantation was significantly lower among patients in <b>Group</b> <b>I</b> (12 % in <b>Group</b> <b>I</b> vs. 22. 5 % in Group II P= 0. 01). Children in <b>Group</b> <b>I</b> also experienced a significantly reduced incidence of acute rejection (0. 97 per patient <b>Group</b> <b>I</b> vs. 1. 5 per patient Group II P= 0. 002) and significantly less steroid resistant acute rejection episodes (3. 1 % in <b>Group</b> <b>I</b> vs. 8. 6 % in Group II P= 0. 0001). The mean steroid dose was significantly lower in <b>Group</b> <b>I</b> compared with <b>Group</b> II at all time points (P= 0. 0001) after LTx. Freedom from steroid was also significantly higher in <b>Group</b> <b>I</b> compared with <b>Group</b> H at all time points after LTx (ranging from 78 % to 84 % in <b>Group</b> <b>I</b> and 9 % to 32 % in Group H during a 1 - to 7 -year posttransplant period P= 0. 0001). The rate of hypertension was significantly lower in <b>Group</b> <b>I</b> than <b>Group</b> II (P= 0. 0001), and the severity of hypertension (need for more than one anti-hypertensive medication) was also significantly lower in <b>Group</b> <b>I</b> than <b>Group</b> II (P= 0. 0001). Although the rate of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) was not significantly different (13. 7 % <b>Group</b> <b>I</b> vs. 8. 3 % Group II, P= 0. 13), the survival after PTLD was significantly better for <b>Group</b> <b>I</b> at 81. 2 % than for Group II at 50 % after 5 years (P= 0. 034). Conclusion. The results suggest that tacrolimus-based therapy provides significant long-term benefit to pediatric LTx patients, evidenced by significantly improved patient and graft survival, reduced rate of rejection, and hypertension with lower steroid doses...|$|R
40|$|<b>Group</b> <b>I</b> metabotropic {{glutamate}} receptors (mGluRs) are G-coupled receptors that modulate synaptic activity. Previous {{studies have}} shown that <b>Group</b> <b>I</b> mGluRs are present in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), in which many visceral afferents terminate. Microinjection of selective <b>Group</b> <b>I</b> mGluR agonists into the NTS results in a depressor response and decrease in sympathetic nerve activity. There is, however, little evidence detailing which phenotypes of neurons within the NTS express <b>Group</b> <b>I</b> mGluRs. In brainstem slices, we performed immunohistochemical localization of <b>Group</b> <b>I</b> mGluRs and either glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 kDa isoform (GAD 67), neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) or tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Fluoro-Gold (FG, 2 %; 15 nl) was microinjected in the caudal ventrolateral medulla (CVLM) of the rat to retrogradely label NTS neurons that project to CVLM. <b>Group</b> <b>I</b> mGluRs were distributed throughout the rostral-caudal extent of the NTS and were found within most NTS subregions. The relative percentages of <b>Group</b> <b>I</b> mGluR expressing neurons colabeled with the different markers were FG (6. 9 +/- 0. 7) nNOS (5. 6 +/- 0. 9), TH (3. 9 +/- 1. 0), and GAD 67 (3. 1 +/- 1. 4).
