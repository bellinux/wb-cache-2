5|$|As Nur al-Din's territories became {{fragmented}} {{after his}} death, Saladin legitimised his ascent by positioning {{himself as a}} defender of Sunni Islam subservient to both the Caliph of Baghdad and Nur al-Din's son and successor, As-Salih Ismail al-Malik. In {{the early years of}} his ascendency, he seized Damascus and much of Syria, but not Aleppo. After building a defensive force to resist a planned attack by the Kingdom of Jerusalem that never materialised, his first contest with the Latin Christians was not a success. His overconfidence and tactical errors led to defeat at the Battle of Montgisard. Despite this setback, Saladin established a domain stretching from the Nile to the Euphrates through a decade of politics, coercion, and low-level military action. After a life-threatening illness early in 1186, he determined to make good on his propaganda as the champion of Islam, embarking on heightened campaigning against the Latin Christians. King Guy responded by raising the largest army that Jerusalem had <b>ever</b> <b>put</b> in the field. However, Saladin lured the force into inhospitable terrain without water supplies, surrounded the Latins with a superior force, and routed them at the Battle of Hattin. Saladin offered the Christians the option of remaining in peace under Islamic rule or taking advantage of 40 days' grace to leave. As a result, much of Palestine quickly fell to Saladin including, after a short five-day siege, Jerusalem. According to Benedict of Peterborough, Pope Urban III died of deep sadness on 19October 1187 on hearing of the defeat. His successor as Pope, Gregory VIII issued a papal bull titled Audita tremendi that proposed a further Crusade later named the Third Crusade to recapture Jerusalem. On 28August 1189 King Guy of Jerusalem besieged the strategic city of Acre, only to be in turn besieged by Saladin. Both armies could be supplied by sea so a long stalemate commenced. Such were the deprivations of the Crusaders that at times they are thought to have resorted to cannibalism.|$|E

Weeks also insists that Bulger strictly forbade PCP and selling to children, and that those dealers who refused to play by his rules were violently driven out of the neighborhood.|$|E

These major studies were those of Benedict Zuckermann, Robert North, and Jean-François Lefebvre. The reasons given by these authors to support a 49-year cycle are both textual (examining all relevant Biblical texts) and practical.|$|E

25|$|Though it was {{initially}} raised as an assault group that would form a pathfinder to a German-Indian joint {{invasion of the}} western frontiers of British India, only a small contingent was <b>ever</b> <b>put</b> to its original intended purpose. A hundred legionnaires were parachuted into eastern Iran under Operation Bajadere and infiltrated into Baluchistan Province to undertake sabotage operations, which they reportedly did successfully, but with insignificant effect. A small contingent, including much of the Indian officer corps and enlisted leadership, {{was transferred to the}} Indian National Army in South-East Asia. The majority of the troops of the Indian Legion were only ever stationed in Europe in non-combat duties, in the Netherlands and in France until the Allied invasion. They saw action in the retreat from the Allied advance across France, fighting mostly against the French Resistance. One company was sent to Italy in 1944, where it saw action against British and Polish troops and undertook anti-partisan operations.|$|E
25|$|Least shrew (Cryptotis parva) — rare in Connecticut, {{where the}} species reaches its eastern limit {{and close to}} its {{northern}} limit (it is also in central New York state); in this state, only found in coastal areas with high beach dunes and neighboring brackish marshes; all other shrews in the state have much longer tails (at least {{as long as the}} rest of their bodies). As of late 2007, the species was the only mammal listed on the Connecticut endangered species list, {{and it was the first}} mammal <b>ever</b> <b>put</b> on the list. The greatest threat facing least shrews in the state is land development along the coast, which limits the land available for the species and isolates breeding populations. Other threats are pesticides and pollutants contaminating food and habitat. The animal was first identified in Darien, Connecticut, in 1840 by Reverend James H. Linsley, but not seen again for 100 years. In 1941, George Goodwin, assistant curator of mammals at the American Museum of Natural History, in New York City, found one in Westbrook at the edge of a saltgrass meadow. The animal again went without documented sightings until it was found in 1989 in coastal Middlesex County in 1989. As of 2007, this is the only documented Connecticut location of the species.|$|E
