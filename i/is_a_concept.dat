5|$|Congestion pricing <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>concept</b> from market {{economics}} {{regarding the}} use of pricing mechanisms to charge the users of public goods for the negative externalities generated by the peak demand in excess of available supply.

Usually this means increasing prices during certain periods of time or at the places where congestion occurs; or introducing a new usage tax or charge when peak demand exceeds available supply {{in the case of a}} tax-funded public good provided free at the point of usage.|$|E
