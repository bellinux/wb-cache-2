500|$|One thing I {{remember}} {{having had a}} really depressing <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> was the first Ramones album. When I heard it , I mean {{it was a great}} record... but I hated it because I knew we'd been doing this sort of stuff for years. There was even a chord progression on that album that we used... and I thought, [...] "Fuck. We're going to be labeled as influenced by the Ramones", when nothing could have been further from the truth.|$|E
500|$|According to {{intersex}} {{activist and}} academic Morgan Holmes, Eugenides posits that a person's sexual attraction determines {{his or her}} gender. Cal's wish to become male because he desires females demonstrates a link between gender identity and sexuality. While Callie is not permitted to love the Obscure Object openly, Cal can freely love Julie. Holmes believed that the depiction of Callie [...] "denies the legitimate place of lesbian desire and rewrites it as male heterosexuality." [...] Book reviewer Georgia Warnke has a similar view. She wrote that by making these choices in the novel, Eugenides agrees {{with the belief that}} being attracted to females is [...] "masculine" [...] and thus it is [...] "more natural" [...] for a male to be attracted to a female than a female be attracted to a female. Daniel Mendelsohn of The New York Review of Books argued that Callie {{does not have to be}} a male in order to be drawn towards females; she could be gay. As an adult, Cal brags, [...] "Breasts have the same <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> as on anyone with my testosterone level." [...] Mendelsohn noted that this assertion will astonish [...] "Eugenides's (presumably testosterone-rich) gay male readership". Scholar Rachel Carroll agreed, writing that teenage Callie's erotic interest in girls is [...] "retroactively explained and legitimized, by the discovery of his 'true biological nature'." [...] Cal's gender identity postdates rather than predates his sexual interests. Carroll posited that Cal's inability to form heterosexual relationships as an adult is founded not upon his being intersex, but on his rejection of the sexual ambiguities that form his sexual interests as a youth.|$|E
500|$|O'Bannon soon {{accepted}} {{an offer to}} work on Alejandro Jodorowsky's adaptation of Dune, a project which took him to Paris for six months. Though the project ultimately fell through, it introduced him to several artists whose work gave him ideas for his science-fiction story including Chris Foss, H. R. Giger, and Jean [...] "Moebius" [...] Giraud. O'Bannon was impressed by Foss's covers for science fiction books, while he found Giger's work [...] "disturbing": [...] "His paintings had a profound <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>me.</b> I {{had never seen anything}} that was quite as horrible {{and at the same time}} as beautiful as his work. And so I ended up writing a script about a Giger monster." [...] After the Dune project collapsed, O'Bannon returned to Los Angeles to live with Shusett and the two revived his Memory script. Shusett suggested that O'Bannon use one of his other film ideas, about gremlins infiltrating a B-17 bomber during World War II, and set it on the spaceship as the second half of the story. The working title of the project was now Star Beast, but O'Bannon disliked this and changed it to Alien after noting the number of times that the word appeared in the script. He and Shusett liked the new title's simplicity and its double meaning as both a noun and an adjective. Shusett came up with the idea that one of the crew members could be implanted with an alien embryo that would burst out of him; he thought this would be an interesting plot device by which the alien could get aboard the ship.|$|E

2500|$|After leaving school, Lowry began {{a career}} {{working for the}} Pall Mall Company, later {{collecting}} rents.

In 1905, he secured {{a place at the}} Manchester School of Art, where he studied under the French Impressionist, Pierre Adolphe Valette. Lowry was full of praise for Valette as a teacher, remarking [...] "I cannot over-estimate the <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> of the coming into this drab city of Adolphe Valette, full of French impressionists, aware of everything that was going on in Paris".

2500|$|Lewis {{is widely}} hailed {{as one of}} the most {{influential}} pianists in the history of rock and roll. [...] In an often quoted tribute, Elvis Presley once said that if he could play the piano like Lewis he would quit singing. [...] Lewis's pivotal role in popularizing the piano in rock and roll is indisputable. [...] Up until his arrival, the music had been primarily associated with guitars, but his early Sun recordings and television appearances pushed the instrument to the forefront. [...] Lewis was also an incendiary showman who often played with his fists, elbows, feet, and backside, sometimes climbing on top of the piano during gigs and even apocryphally setting it on fire. [...] Like Chuck Berry's guitar playing, Lewis's piano style has become synonymous with rock and roll, having influenced generations of piano players. [...] In a 2013 interview with Leah Harper, Elton John recalls that up until [...] "Great Balls of Fire," [...] "the piano playing that I had heard had been more sedate. [...] My dad collected George Shearing records, but this was the first time I heard someone beat the shit out of a piano. When I saw Little Richard at the Harrow Granada, he played it standing up, but Jerry Lee Lewis actually jumped on the piano! This was astonishing to me, that people could do that. Those records had such a huge <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>me,</b> and they were just so great. I learned to play like that." [...] Lewis is primarily known for his [...] "boogie woogie" [...] style, which is characterized by a regular left hand bass figure and dancing beat, but his command of the instrument and highly individualistic style set him apart. [...] Appearing on Memphis Sounds with George Klein in 2011, Lewis credited his older piano-playing cousin Carl McVoy as being a crucial influence, stating, [...] "He was a great piano player, a great singer, and a nice looking man, carried himself real well. [...] I miss Carl very much." [...] Lewis also cited Moon Mullican as a source of inspiration. [...] Although almost entirely self-taught, Lewis conceded to biographer Rich Bragg in 2014 that Paul Whitehead, a blind pianist from Meadville, Mississippi, was another key influence on him in his earliest days playing clubs, confiding, [...] "Paul Whitehead done a lot. [...] His lesson was worth a billion dollars to me...He taught me. [...] I'd sit beside him, and say, 'Mr. Paul, can you show me exactly how you do that?' [...] Mr. Paul was good to me." ...|$|E

40|$|Observed {{growth of}} cattle during the postweaning period {{reflects}} the genetic potential for growth as modified by the environment. Various breeds or breed crosses of cattle have been characterized for postweaning liveweight gain under {{ad libitum feeding}} conditions. Previous results showed calves by Simmental males had greater rates of postweaning gain than those sired by Hereford males. Simmental-sired steers were more efficient during a weight-constant interval, of equal efficiency during a time-constant interval and less efficient to a fat-constant end point than Hereford-sired steers. Differences among breeds in efficiencies of energy utilization for maintenance and gain have been reported. Similarly, differences among sexes (or sex condition) in growth rate and carcass characteristics have been documented. Efficiencies of energy utilization for maintenance and gain of castrate males {{have been reported to}} be similar to those of females. However, other results have suggested that intact males had higher maintenance requirements than castrate males. This paper describes the accretion of total empty body weight, water, fat, protein, and energy by Hereford and Simmental males and females in response to differing rates of metabolic energy (ME) intake. Estimates of breed and sex <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>ME</b> requirements for maintenance and efficiencies of utilization of ME for maintenance and gain are reported...|$|R

It will be studied by C. A. S. (Center for Advanced Studies) United States History students which my colleagues and I teach. It is incumbent upon me in the first section, the Narrative Section, to enumerate the objectives and the strategies which I will use. In this section, it will become evident why I chose that title.
