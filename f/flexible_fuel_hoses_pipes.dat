25|$|On 5 May 1998, a <b>flexible</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>hose</b> in the ship's {{engine room}} burst. The {{spraying}} fuel ignited {{when it came}} into contact with hot machinery, and the first-response extinguishers were unable to cope with the fire's intensity. It took two hours for the fire to be extinguished, and four sailors died from carbon monoxide poisoning. A Board of Inquiry reported in December that a different type of hose inappropriate for an engine-room environment was fitted, the civilian contractors that fitted the hose had not passed the configuration changes to the Lloyd's Register classification society as required, and that personnel aboard Westralia did not have the training and qualifications required for their responsibilities. Repairs and modifications were made to the ship, and she returned to operational service during 2000.|$|R
40|$|Unique {{and useful}} {{properties}} {{of the class of}} nonhydrocarbon, nonhalocarbon, nonsilicone polymers known as polyphosphazenes are discussed at length. These polymers, with molecular weights to 4 million (degree of polymerization 15, 000), can be fabricated as tubes, fibers, woven fabrics, flexible films, or plates, and many variants are stable to attack by water, bases, aqueous acids, jet fuels, oils, hydraulic fluids, gasoline, or other hydrocarbons. Rubbery polymers with these properties can be fashioned into <b>flexible</b> <b>hose,</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>hose,</b> gaskets, or O-rings. Since they do not provoke clotting reactions in blood, and reveal no carcinogenic effects to date, they are considered for internal prosthetic applications (replacement bone, temporary skin, heart valves), as biodegradable suturing material, as carriers for slow release of drugs, and as carriers for chemotherapeutic agents against cancers...|$|R
25|$|The hoses are {{color-coded}} {{for visual}} identification. The {{color of the}} hoses varies between countries. In the United States, the oxygen hose is green, and the <b>fuel</b> <b>hose</b> is red. In the UK and other countries, the oxygen hose is blue (black hoses may still be found on old equipment), and the acetylene (<b>fuel)</b> <b>hose</b> is red. If liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) fuel, such as propane, is used, the <b>fuel</b> <b>hose</b> should be orange, indicating that it is compatible with LPG. LPG will damage an incompatible hose, including most acetylene hoses.|$|R

40|$|Cooper Nuclear Station (CNS) {{returned}} {{one high}} pressure <b>fuel</b> <b>hose</b> to Engine Systems, Inc. (ESI) because CNS had found foreign material within the hose during receipt inspection. This <b>fuel</b> <b>hose</b> {{was one of}} four <b>fuel</b> <b>hoses</b> that had been supplied to CNS by ESI in October 2011. ESI performed an evaluation and found very small pieces of the elastomer tube internal to the hose. Apparently these pieces were introduced during assembly of the end fittings onto the hose during fabrication of the hose assembly. When installed, this <b>fuel</b> <b>hose</b> would be located after the engine fuel filter and before the fuel injection pumps. Foreign material within this hose could migrate to the fuel injection pumps. The entrance of foreign material could impact operability of one or more fuel injection pumps and therefore affect fuel delivery to one or more engine cylinders. This could impact the load carrying capability of the diesel engine or possibly cause complete engine shutdown. Either scenario has the potential to prevent the emergency diesel generator from performing its safety related function. These hoses were supplied only to CNS. 02 - 03 - 12; 03 : 43 PM; # 11 /...|$|R

40|$|Biodiesel {{is one of}} {{the fast}} growing {{alternative}} fuels for diesel engines in the world with yearly consumption exceeds 300 million gallon. In 2000, the Hong Kong SAR Government has commissioned the University of Hong Kong to conduct a comprehensive evaluation on the performance of biodiesel on in-service diesel-powered vehicles in Hong Kong and to compare the results with those using ultra low sulphur diesel (50 ppm sulphur) currently used in Hong Kong. Three types of biodiesel fuels were tested with different biodiesel/ULSD blending ratios. The whole study comprised of two parts, namely, a chassis dynamometer exhaust emission test (NOx, CO and HC 1) and a diesel lug down test for each of the vehicle tested. The result of the test is positive and confirms the environmental benefit of using biodiesel fuel. However, a very slight increased in NOx concentration is reported. During the course of the study, some issues related to the durability and <b>fuel</b> <b>hoses</b> compatibility have been raised that may affect the road worthiness of vehicles. In order to assess the compatibility of the rubber <b>fuel</b> <b>hoses</b> with biodiesel, a <b>fuel</b> <b>hose</b> compatibility test was performed to study the characteristics of <b>fuel</b> <b>hoses</b> subjected to <b>fuels</b> with different biodiesel percentages and with different durations. Result of the test leads to some recommendations on the use of special <b>fuel</b> <b>hoses</b> for biodiesel <b>fuel.</b> A one-year durability test on three vehicles using biodiesel was carried out to observe the long term effect of biodiesel on vehicles. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

5000|$|The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations {{believes}} that locally produced low-cost treadle pumps could boost {{security in the}} region. KickStart’s strategy is aligned with this philosophy as the organization designs and sells durable yet affordable “MoneyMaker” branded irrigation pumps. Starting in 1998, KickStart began developing this line of manually operated irrigation pumps which allow farmers to easily pull water from a river, pond, or shallow well, and pressurize it through a <b>hose</b> <b>pipe</b> to reach their crops. The MoneyMaker Max, for example, can pressurize water to a total height of 50 feet, pushing it through a <b>hose</b> <b>pipe</b> as far as 200 m, and can irrigate {{as much as two}} acres of land. [...] The low-cost ($70 and $150) pumps are purchased by poor farmers who use them to irrigate their plots, enabling them to move from rain-fed subsistence farming to year-round commercial irrigated agriculture.|$|R

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{dramatic}} incidents affected Verstappen at the German Grand Prix. During his first scheduled pitstop during the race, fuel leaked onto the car after the <b>fuel</b> <b>hose</b> was disconnected.
