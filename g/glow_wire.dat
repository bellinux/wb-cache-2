They are designed to meet UL 94 flammability tests as well as <b>Glow</b> <b>Wire</b> Ignition Tests (GWIT), <b>Glow</b> <b>Wire</b> Flammability Test (GWFI) and Comparative Tracking Index (CTI).

5000|$|In {{glass fibre}} {{reinforced}} (GF) polyamide 6 (Nylon 6) and 66 (Nylon 66) formulations {{as well as}} in polyesters like polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) and PET, aluminium diethyl phosphinate shows excellent performance in the UL 94 flammability tests [...] (UL 94 V0 specification is met down to 0.4 mm), {{as well as in}} the <b>glow</b> <b>wire</b> tests required for appliances. Here, formulations with aluminium diethyl phosphinate meet the <b>glow</b> <b>wire</b> ignition test (GWIT) [...] at 775 °C and the <b>glow</b> <b>wire</b> flammability test (GWFI) at 960 °C. Another important criterion in E&E applications is the Comparative Tracking Index (CTI), which determines the risk of electrical tracking of insulating material that is exposed to contaminating environments and surface conditions. With formulations containing aluminium diethyl phosphinate, the highest requirement of 600 V (numeric value of the highest voltage at which an electrical insulating material withstands 50 drops of electrolytic test solution) is achieved. Further benefits of polyamides and polyesters containing aluminium diethyl phosphinate are low smoke density which makes them suitable for rolling stock applications to EN 45545, as well as good light stability which is needed for outdoor applications.|$|E
40|$|The thermal {{properties}} and fire behaviour of polypropylene (PP) nanocomposites were investigated using differential scanning calorimetry, dynamic-mechanical analysis, thermogravimetric analysis and <b>glow</b> <b>wire</b> test. In order {{to study the}} morphological structure of the materials obtained, TEM and XRD analyses were also carried out. The nanocomposites were prepared using the melt intercalation technique in a co-rotating intermeshing twin screw extruder. Particular attention was given to studying the influence of different processing conditions (barrel temperature profile and screw rate) and compositions of PP-nanoclay blends (clay content, use of compatibiliser) on the {{thermal properties}} of the nanocomposites. The results show that all the properties analysed were strongly influenced by the nanocomposite composition; instead, the processing conditions greatly affect only the dynamic-mechanical properties. DSC curves show that the crystallinity is deeply influenced {{by the presence of}} the clay in the matrix, owing {{to the fact that the}} filler acts as nucleating agent. DMA curves show that materials processed at low temperature profile and high shear stress, i. e. when a good clay dispersion is achieved, are characterised by an enhanced modulus, thus indicating that the incorporation of clay into the PP matrix remarkably enhances its stiffness and has good reinforcing effects. TGA traces in oxidizing atmosphere show a drastic shift of the weight loss curve towards higher temperature and no variation of the onset temperature (i. e. the temperature at which degradation begins). The TGA analyses in inert atmosphere show instead marked increase of this parameter (about 200 degrees C) and no shift of weight loss curves. <b>Glow</b> <b>wire</b> results highlight that polymer nanocomposites are characterised by enhanced fire behaviour...|$|E

Others who developed early and commercially impractical incandescent electric lamps included Humphry Davy, James Bowman Lindsay, Moses G. Farmer, William E. Sawyer, Joseph Swan, and Heinrich Göbel. Some of these early bulbs had such flaws as an extremely short life, high expense to produce, and high electric current drawn, making them difficult to apply on a large scale commercially. Edison realized that to connect a series of electric lights to an economically manageable size and using the necessary thickness of copper wire, he would have to develop a lamp that used a low amount of current. This lamp must have high resistance and use relatively low voltage (around 110 volts).|$|R

Electrochromatography was carried out in an in-house built capillary electrophoresis apparatus, without pressurizing the vials.

40|$|Among the {{industrial}} sectors that {{are affected by}} dust explosions, the metal working industry {{is one of the}} most frequently involved. Metal dusts are often the by-products of mechanical workings. Dust producing machines are widely distributed, small in size and are generally located in workplaces. Abatement plants are also often located in the working area. The companies that are involved in these explosions are often small, and thus often have limited resources. These factors generally lead to difficulties in managing the risk of explosions. This paper has the aim of investigating the flammability of waste dust produced by metal workings, and to define the dust properties that are more likely to lead to an explosion. For this purpose, a simple and fast flammability test has been used as a cheap way of characterise the flammability of the samples. The test has been called the Speedy Esplosibility Test (SET), and it is similar to the procedure suggested in the new ISO/IEC standard (ISO/IEC 2016) that came into force recently. SET is composed of 4 different tests, derived from standard procedures, each of which represents a different ignition mechanism: • High voltage continuous arc ignition and <b>glowing</b> <b>wire</b> ignition in a Hartman 1. 2 l tube (based on UNI EN 13821 : 2004); • Dust cloud ignition in a G-G furnace and dust layer ignition on a hot plate (based on UNI EN 50281 : 1999). The SET results are compared with the standard flammability classification obtained according to ISO, 2016 ISO/IEC 80079 : 2016, with the standard KSt measurement in the 20 -L Siwek Sphere, and with tests in the 20 -L sphere with 2 × 1 kJ igniters, respectively according to the UNI EN 14034 : 2011 part 2 and part 3. Moreover, the morphology and chemical nature of the dusts have also been determined and their effects on dust explosibility are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Combustible dusts {{explosion}} risk {{depends on a}} huge number of dust characteristics which allows the analyst to assess its behavior at different conditions. To characterize dust behavior {{a huge number of}} parameters can be measured according to several technical standards. In general, each standard describes how to measure a single parameter, which characterize a specific dust behavior. Nowadays there's no standard conceived to simply determine if the dust can cause an explosion. As available standard tests are often costly in terms of time and money for both laboratory analysts and customers, moreover the latter are sometimes in the condition to submit to expensive tests dust samples that could not explode. The aim {{of this paper is to}} describe a simplified and straightforward test that can assess whether a dust is explosible or not. The test is called Speditive Esplosibility Test (SET). It is composed of 4 different tests, each of them representing a different ignition mechanism derived from standards procedures. These are: -High voltage continuous arc ignition and <b>glowing</b> <b>wire</b> ignition in Hartman 1. 2 l tube (based on UNI EN 13821 : 2004); -Dust cloud ignition in G-G furnace and dust layer ignition on hot plate (based on UNI EN 50281 : 1999). In this context the 4 experimental procedures were slightly modified respect to standards procedures: the test conditions have to be "as worst as possible" in terms of energy transferred to the sample. This approach assure that also dusts that have relative weak tendency to ignite is considered and classified. The test classifies dusts in 3 categories: explosible at ambient temperature (in case of ignition in Hartmann tube tests), explosible at high temperature (in case of ignition in GG or hot plate tests), not explosible (in case of no ignition). Fundamentally, the test procedure is configured as a statistical investigation in which a defined number of tests is made. Screening test has been performed for several types of dusts and results compared with kst tests in 20 l Siwek Sphere for some of the samples. Results sees to confirm the hypothesis of the Screening Test and its reliability to assess explosibility of combustible dust...|$|R

Numerical simulations of a one-dimensional mass-and-spring lattice show that dissipation, nonuniformity, and nonlinearity each cause radiation to escape from the source region. The radiation amplitude relative to the standing wave amplitude is substantially reduced for sources that are distributed over a region rather than lumped over the same region.

40|$|The {{search for}} new {{materials}} and material properties has advanced to smaller and smaller structures during the past years. Inorganic particles in the size range below { 100 nm} are interesting for many applications, because on this scale properties often vary strongly from bulk. Nanoparticles are traditionally produced on large scale in wet chemical batch processes involving solvents. The surface of these particles is necessarily contaminated due to the very limited purities in which liquid solvents are available. The desired nanoparticles are often contaminated by the unwanted side products of the wet chemical reaction and must be cleaned in an additional process step. Aerosol methods allow the production of much cleaner particles in a continuous process. Solvents are omitted and particles are only covered with a gas or water adsorption layer. Particle purity depends on the initial purity of the precursor material, e. g. a metallic wire or powder, and often additional refining is not necessary. Different stages of aerosol nanotechnology were investigated in this work which can be combined into a production line for nanotechnology devices or applied for quick material screening e. g. in catalyst research. The aerosols are produced by a <b>glowing</b> <b>wire</b> generator (GWG), which was characterized with respect to process conditions, choice of material, size limitations and particle charging. The latter is now understood and external chargers can be omitted. The feasibility of separating nanoparticles {{with respect to their}} shape and surface morphology based on basic properties is investigated. An existing prototype of a separation stage was used. In the current work previous experimental results were reproduced and models were developed to simulate the separation process of particles with different shape. The models were successfully applied on the separation of aggregates and round particles, which was observed in the experiments. The separation of nanoparticles with well defined surfaces is needed for many applications, e. g. to better understand the underlying chemical mechanisms in catalysis. Nanoparticles generated from aerosol processes were used to study basic catalytic properties of the material. They were deposited on a surface to investigate catalytic reactions under the influence of an electric field. Microreactor methods were applied in combination with highly efficient product detection (mass spectroscopy) on small amounts of catalyst material. The electric field can be varied easily and so can the properties of the catalyst, which is a first step towards tunable catalyst devices. Combined with the flexibility of aerosol processes to produce clean and well defined particles these microreactor systems can be used for quick screening of materials. The use of a substrate to support the catalyst material introduces uncontrollable interactions between the materials, e. g. by the substrate surface structure or contact potentials. To eliminate these effects nickel aerosol particles were used directly as catalyst for the methanation of carbon monoxide. Particles were selected according to their charge and the influence of the charge state on the activation energy of the reaction was studied. Besides the application of aerosol nanoparticles for the study of basic properties the present study investigated the viability of nanoparticle deposition by focused impaction for the production of new materials and sensor devices. Aerosol technology is used for the production of porous, nanostructured, metallic structures on micrometer scale for sensor applications. The conductivity of this material is studied under the influence of an atmosphere containing hydrogen, which made it possible to extract basic information on particle sintering and proved the concept of an ultrafast, nanoparticle based hydrogen gas sensor. It was shown, that current can be specifically used to induce sintering in deposited nanostructured material, which alters the behavior of the material. Applied Science...|$|R
50|$|Bad wiring {{junctions}} {{can occur}} in utilization equipment, cords, or in-situ wiring and especially in a defective switch, socket, plug, wiring connection and even at the circuit breaker or fuse panels. Terminal screws loosened by vibration, improper tightening or other causes offer increased resistance to the current, with consequent heating and potential thermal creep, which will cause the termination to loosen further and exacerbate the heating effect. In North America, high resistance junctions are sometimes observed at the terminations of aluminum wire circuits, where oxidation has caused increased resistance, resulting in thermal creep. No technology located in a circuit breaker or fuse panel could detect a high-resistance wiring fault as no measurable characteristic exists that differentiates a glow fault from normal branch circuit operation. Power Fault Circuit Interrupters (PFCI) located in receptacles are designed to prevent fires caused by <b>glowing</b> connections in <b>wiring</b> or panels. From the receptacle a PFCI can detect the voltage drop when high current exists in a high resistance junction.

40|$|This {{work was}} {{concerned}} with the measurement of the variation of the combination coefficient between aerosol particles and small ions, b, with the radius of the particles. The variation of the combination coefficient between uncharged aerosol particles and small ions, ɳo, with radius was also examined. The ion-ion recombination coefficient,ɤ, was first evaluated from plots of small ion decay in an aerosol-free mylar vessel of volume 3. 1 m(^ 3). Small ions were produced from corona discharge around {{the tip of a}} steel needle, set at a high voltage. 14 measurements of were made, giving a mean experimental value of 2. 39 (- 0. 14) x l 0 (^- 6) cm(^ 3) sec(^-l).

Particles were produced by blowing filtered air over a <b>glowing</b> nichrome <b>wire.</b> Methods of number concentration and particle size determination are described. The decay of the ions {{in the presence of the}} particles in the mylar vessel was recorded and compared with a family of theoretical ion-aerosol decay curves plotted by the computer to determine b. A total of 26 b measurements were made and the value ranged from 0. 35 x 10 (^- 6) cm(^ 3) sec(^- 1) to 2. 24 x 10 (^- 6) cm(^ 3) sec(^- 1),corresponding to radii of 0. 41 x 10 (^- 6) cm to 4. 0 x 10 (^- 6) cm.

40|$|Electroluminescent (EL) wire is {{a unique}} kind of <b>wire</b> because it <b>glows</b> when {{attached}} to a power source. EL wire has many applications, both creative and practical. For example: Burning Man enthusiasts like to adorn their clothing with the flexible wire, and emergency responders use it to mark off accidents on the road at night. What makes EL <b>wire</b> <b>glow</b> is the electrical reactions between its copper wires and phosphor coating. The problem with this wire, however, {{is that it is}} very difficult to connect it to a battery. This is due to the wire’s structure. Beneath its protective plastic shielding, EL wire has a core copper wire, double wrapped with a very fine pair of copper wires. These fine copper wires are hard to solder to, and can break without much effort. Standard soldering methods use a basic alligator tooth style double clamp to hold EL wires in place for soldering. This device is very poorly made, as one must tighten and re-tighten every moveable joint for a precision solder. Adjusting these clamps can be maddening, especially when many EL solder joints must be made. There must be a better way to terminate EL wire, therefore various connection methods are considered as possible solutions. They are: improved hand soldering, machine soldering, conducive epoxy, and crimping. Ultimately it was decided that an improved solder technique would prove to be the best solution. And it entailed manufacturing a custom fixture that would hold the EL wire for easy soldering. The design went though many phases and was tested to see if it commanded a faster soldering time over its clamping counterpart. The results suggest the fixture has a mean soldering time that is statistically significantly less than the mean soldering time of the alligator clamps, with ninety-five percent confidence. An economic analysis determined that if even just one electrician were to try to profit off of making EL wire assemblies, working either full-time or part-time, he or she would save money in labor hours by purchasing the fixture. A hobbyist on the other hand, who makes only a few EL wire assemblies a month, might be stretching his or her wallet too far by spend the money for the fixture. The bottom line is that if someone stands to make a profit off EL wire assemblies, or is serious about making all kinds of EL artwork, this fixture will save the user time...|$|R
