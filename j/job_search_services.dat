The whole {{title is}} Evaluating the Impacts of Washington State Repeated <b>Job</b> <b>Search</b> <b>Services</b> on the Earnings of Prime-Age Female Tanf Recipients. Summary: This paper uses an {{unbalanced}} panel dataset to evaluate how repeated <b>job</b> <b>search</b> <b>services</b> (JSS) {{and other personal}} characteristics affect the quarterly earnings of the prime-age female welfare recipients in the State of Washington. We propose a joint dependent framework for the probability of employment and potential earnings or hours or hourly wage rates to facilitate {{the investigation of the}} issues of joint determination of employment and potential earnings and to allow for factors to have different impacts on employment status and on quarterly earnings. We have also suggested formulae to compute the dynamic impact of JSS on duration and earnings. Both the maximum likelihood (ML) and semi-parametric estimates are provided. We find that the results are sensitive to the choice of models and estimation methods. For a randomly assigned individual, the first, second and three or more JSS raised the short-run and long-run earnings by (5 %, 0 %, 0 %) and (1 %, 0 %, 0 %), respectively, based on the MLE, and by (56. 6 %, 36. 2 %, 36. 9 %) and (50. 7 %, 36. 2 %, 36. 9 %), respectively, based on the semi-parametric Tobit model.

Also, the control group received no <b>job</b> <b>search</b> <b>services,</b> so while the study establishes that group job search is superior to no counseling, it does not compare group job search to individualized services.

Individuals who have the same demographic characteristics, prior employment and earnings histories, and local labor markets are matched to maximize the likelihood that the estimates reflect causal training impacts.

It is possible that the TJRD transitional jobs programs did lead to some reductions in recidivism, but that the relatively substantial programing received by the TJRD control group members also led to such reductions, such that {{no significant differences were found}} between program and control group members. In addition, CEO was the only one of the five programs evaluated that had extensive experience with both transitional jobs and providing services to former prisoners. In fact, some of the TJRD programs had only recently begun serving the population, and staff were new to the nuances of working with corrections and parole agencies and coping with the special needs of those returning home from prison. Further, some of the TJRD programs had little experience with operating transitional jobs. These sites had the added burden of developing work sites that were suitable for former prisoners.|$|E

The key measure of interest is the difference in average quarterly earnings or employment attributable to WIA program participation for those who participate, estimated for up to four years following entry into the program. The Adult program serves disadvantaged workers, who display relatively poor labor market performance, often over extended periods. The Dislocated Worker program serves individuals who were recently laid off, often {{as a result of}} firm downsizing or plant closure.

30|$|Unfortunately, {{most of the}} {{evaluation}} studies under consideration do not {{address the issue of}} costs-effectiveness of the respective programs. It is interesting, however, to look at approximate calculations 8 based on the program specific expenditure information drawn from the Eurostat Database. This suggests that the average per-capita expenditure is highest for wage subsidies (about 3, 200 euros), followed by training programs (2, 500 euros), job creation schemes (2, 200) and <b>job</b> <b>search</b> <b>services</b> as the least expensive (1, 200 euros). The relatively high costs of job creation schemes stand in contrast to their effectiveness, and are likely to be driven by having the disadvantaged youths as focus group. Based on the calculations by Eurofund (2011, p. 62 ff.) of the country-specific costs of NEET arising due to yearly foregone earnings in 2008, the per-capita costs incurred by these ALMP programs can be compared with the costs incurred by not having youths in the labor force. This can provide a more tangible assessment {{of the importance of the}} costs of maintaining ALMP. This exercise shows that the per-capita cost of wage subsidies amount to about 40 % of foregone earnings, 30 % of foregone earnings in case of training programs, about 35 % for job creation schemes and 10 % for job search programs. 9 The costs of wage subsidies are quite sizeable, but given their above average effectiveness, they stand out relative to similarly costly job creation schemes that are often found to result in zero or negative employment effects. In contrast, the low relative costs of job search measures in combination with their relatively high effectiveness suggest that they are commonly cost-effective.|$|E
40|$|A more market-oriented {{labor market}} {{has emerged in}} China in {{the past twenty years}} with growing {{importance}} of the urban private sector, as state-owned enterprises have downsized. Despite the progress on reforms, a sizable surplus of labor still exists in the rural sector and state-owned enterprises. The main challenge facing China’s labor market in coming years is to absorb the surplus labor into quality jobs while adjusting to World Trade Organization (WTO) accession. This paper estimates that if annual GDP growth averages 7 percent and the employment elasticity is one-half, urban unemployment could double to about 10 percent over the next three to four years. These pressures would be limited by stronger economic growth, especially in the private sector and more labor-intensive service industries which have generated the most jobs in recent years.

40|$|This paper {{employs the}} Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey {{to carry out}} the {{empirical}} analysis of the <b>job</b> <b>search</b> channels choice on the Russian labor market from 1994 till 2001. The econometric estimations of the <b>job</b> <b>search</b> channels choice are based on the modified model of <b>job</b> <b>search</b> with build-in budget and time constraints as model parameters. In this paper the typology of search strategies is represented. Within the framework of the research it has been also investigated how different socio-demographic and economic parameters influence the search strategy choice. We also studied the search intensity, i. e. the choice of the number of the <b>job</b> <b>search</b> channels. Our results confirm that occupation, budget constraints, demographic and ethnic characteristics, period of non-employment and local labor market characteristics influence significantly the choice of search channels. Dependence of <b>job</b> <b>search</b> efficiency on the selected search strategy is also represented in the paper. Our conclusion is that the most efficient strategies employ social networks and large number of channels.
