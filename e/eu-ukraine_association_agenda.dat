5000|$|On 16 June 2009, a new {{practical}} {{instrument was}} adopted - the <b>EU-Ukraine</b> <b>Association</b> <b>Agenda.</b> [...] 19 December 2011 EU-Ukraine summit, which {{was intended to}} lead to the signature of the Agreement, fell short due to the EU's concerns over the jailing of former premier Yulia Tymoshenko. The end of negotiations were announced, but the text of the agreement was not signed with EU leaders deciding to wait until the October 2012 Parliamentary elections as a test of the vitality of democracy and rule of law in Ukraine. The AA was initialed shortly thereafter, on 30 March 2012. Before it enters into force it must be ratified by the Ukrainian Parliament, the European Parliament, and each EU member state. However, EU leaders have suggested that the agreement will not be ratified unless Ukraine addresses concerns over a [...] "stark deterioration of democracy and the rule of law", including the imprisonment of Yulia Tymoshenko and Yuriy Lutsenko in 2011 and 2012. In November 2012, EU Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy Stefan Fule stated that the AA, and DCFTA, could be signed in November 2013 if the EU's concerns were addressed.|$|E

After a brief background of the EU-Ukraine relations, the following aspects are scrutinised: legal basis and objectives, institutional framework and mechanisms of enhanced conditionality and legislative approximation. In addition, constitutional challenges for the effective implementation of the EU-Ukraine AA are discussed.

On the basis of Rules of procedures of the Association Council and the Association Committee provisions adopted by the parties it is revealed the features of their functioning, including decision-making.

40|$|In {{the context}} of truly politicised and geopolitically discoursed public and {{academic}} debates around the pioneering and, at the same time, revolutionary EU-Ukrainian association deal, this article seeks to present a pragmatic law and politics view {{on one of the}} cornerstone issues in the newly launched EU association policy towards Ukraine, i. e. the institutional and implementation framework. It therefore explores possible modalities and the actually arranged implementation model of the <b>EU-Ukraine</b> <b>Association</b> Agreement, and assesses the strengths and weaknesses thereof. The challenges posed by the recent unduly ‘flexibilisation’ and postponement of the agreement’s provisional application are analysed, and the procedural requirements for transitional implementation and full enactment are disclosed. Finally, the association’s institutional engineering is given thorough legal and political scrutiny, that allowed to contend that the truly empowered institutional framework and selected implementation model are deemed to gear the process of political association and economic integration, yet these heavily draw on explicit conferral of dynamic powers and implicit integration-oriented functional rationale...|$|R

During the (following) Euromaidan-protests the channel saw its numbers of viewers heavily increasing. These Euromaidan-protests were caused by the same reason (the 21 November 2013 Ukrainian government decree) as to why the channel started to broadcast earlier (on 22 November 2013). On 29 November 2013, during Euromaidan, a journalist of 5 Kanal and Hromadske.TV stated they were attacked by [...] "athletically built men in plainclothes believed to be hired thugs" [...] in Kyiv's Mariinsky park, while [...] "police were nowhere in sight".

40|$|Union and Ukraine have {{developed}} an increasingly dynamic rela-tionship. Ukraine is a priority partner country within the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) and the Eastern Partnership. Relations between the EU and Ukraine are currently based on the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA) which en-tered into force in 1998.

40|$|The UK {{is searching}} for a {{framework}} for its post-Brexit trade arrangements with the EU. A clean Brexit from the EU has always been unrealistic and the EU is limited {{in the kind of}} trade arrangements it offers to third countries. This briefing paper examines the <b>EU-Ukraine</b> <b>Association</b> Agreement (AA) suggesting how a similar agreement may offer a way forward for the UK-EU negotiations. The EU-Ukraine AA reveals that the EU is willing to adapt previous Agreements to new circumstances. A similar UK-EU Agreement could provide access to the Single Market, maintain inward investment incentives and provide an attractive location for establishment of firms and enterprises, especially in the services sector – an area the UK is keen to protect. For the UK, the adoption of this approach would require less unravelling of existing UK laws, but offer some room for independence in negotiating future issues. • The Agreement also offers a “buy in” to other EU policies but these are not conditional on subscribing to the price of full membership of the EU...|$|R

40|$|The 2016 {{referendum}} in the Netherlands on the <b>EU-Ukraine</b> <b>Association</b> Agreement and the Walloon objection in Belgium to sign CETA triggered {{the question of}} the consequences of the non-ratification of mixed agreements that are (to be) concluded between the EU, its Member States and one or more third parties. This non-ratification would lead to so-called "incomplete" mixed agreements. The present article discusses the legal problems connected to incomplete agreements and points to the differences between bilateral and multilateral agreements. Now that mixity seems to be have become more common - due to the wider scope of Free Trade Agreements - and EU citizens and their parliaments become more outspoken with respect to the content of these agreements, it seems {{just a matter of time}} before we are faced with problems of non-ratification. The unclear division of external competences between the EU and its Member States makes it difficult to offer clear-cut solutions. Overall, however, it does not seem advisable to rely on ex post facto solutions for non-ratification problems; we may have to find ways to allow potential problems to be on the negotiation table at an earlier stage...|$|R
40|$|In {{the article}} author investigates {{the process of}} {{formation}} of the state border between Ukraine and Russian Federation. The collapse of the Soviet Union was key checkpoint for all social institutions of society, in particular ? for the state border. Area between Ukraine and Russia changed significantly, because here the state border didn?t actually existed. The border described as social institution, which passed a certain process of institutionalization. The process of institutionalization of the Ukraine-Russia border is quite heterogeneous {{and to this day}} remains incomplete. In official and everyday discourses place and role of this section of the border changed several times, sometimes - drastically. The author pays special attention to the phases of institutionalization: official decision on the division of the territory; the delimitation in the contract; the demarcation on the ground; establishing administrative control on the border. Each of them described in symbolic and legal aspects. Process of institutionalization for considered frontier has its own specific characteristics. First of them ? that it changed it?s status from ?internal administrative? border to ?foreign state border?. The second characteristic is that today Eastern border of Ukraine more and more often describes as Eastern border of Europe Union, especially after signing two parts of the <b>EU-Ukraine</b> <b>Association</b> Agreement. ?????? ????????? ???????? ??????????? ? ???????????? ????????? ???????-?????????? ??????????????? ???????. ????? ????????? ?? ??????????? ??????????????? ??????? ??? ??????????? ?????????, ?????????? ??? ????????? ? ???????. ???????????????? ???????????? ??????? ?? ???????????? ?????????? ???????, ?? ??????????? ? ??????????. ? ?????? ?????????? ??????? ??????????????????? ??????????????? ??????? ?? ??????? ????? ???????? ? ?????????? ??????????, ??????? ???? ????????????? ??????????????, ????????? ? ????????? ?? ??????? ?????????? ???????????????? ??????? ? ??????? ???????????????. ???????? ??????????? ??????? ???????????? ?????????? ? ???????? ?????? ????? ????????...|$|R

The decision to put off signing this <b>EU-Ukraine</b> <b>Association</b> Agreement lead to massive protests in Ukraine. On 7 December 2013 the IMF clarified that it was not insisting on a single-stage increase in natural gas tariffs in Ukraine by 40%, but recommended that they be gradually raised to an economically justified level while compensating the poorest segments of the population for the losses from such an increase by strengthening targeted social assistance. On 10 December President Yanukovych stated [...] "We will certainly resume the IMF negotiations. If there are conditions that suit us, we will take that path". However, Yanukovych also (once again) stated that the conditions put forward by the IMF were unacceptable [...] "I had a conversation with U.S. Vice President Joseph Biden, who told me that the issue of the IMF loan has almost been solved, but I told him that if the conditions remained... we did not need such loans".|$|R

40|$|The Vilnius Eastern Partnership Summit on 28 - 29 th November 2013 {{represents}} {{a milestone in}} EU relations not just {{with respect to the}} six Eastern Partnership countries (EaP Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and particularly Ukraine), but also with the EU’s ‘strategic partner’ Russia. The turbulence and numerous speculations regarding expectations about the signature of the <b>EU-Ukraine</b> <b>Association</b> Agreement (comprising a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement - AA/DCFTA), as well as progress in initialling similar future agreements with Georgia and Moldova, have been escalating before the summit. The association agreementswould bring EaP signatory countries closer to the EU not really closer to EU membership, but closer to the application of various EU norms and standards (takeover of the ‘acquis communautaire’) and - significantly - out of the Russian orbit, for the beginning at least symbolically.
