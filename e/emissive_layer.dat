25|$|During operation, {{a voltage}} is applied across the OLED {{such that the}} anode is {{positive}} {{with respect to the}} cathode. Anodes are picked based upon the quality of their optical transparency, electrical conductivity, and chemical stability. A current of electrons flows through the device from cathode to anode, as electrons are injected into the LUMO of the organic layer at the cathode and withdrawn from the HOMO at the anode. This latter process may also be described as the injection of electron holes into the HOMO. Electrostatic forces bring the electrons and the holes towards each other and they recombine forming an exciton, a bound state of the electron and hole. This happens closer to the <b>emissive</b> <b>layer,</b> because in organic semiconductors holes are generally more mobile than electrons. The decay of this excited state results in a relaxation of the energy levels of the electron, accompanied by emission of radiation whose frequency is in the visible region. The frequency of this radiation depends on the band gap of the material, in this case the difference in energy between the HOMO and LUMO.|$|E

To realize full color and white OLED, various color mixing structures, including multiple dopant <b>emissive</b> <b>layers</b> and multiple <b>emissive</b> <b>layers,</b> and down conversion in the optical microcavity, have been utilized with various degrees of success [4 – 10]. Some methods for generating white color emission from OLED have been developed, such as the method of partial energy transfer in which the OLED materials are doped with fluorescent/phosphorescent dyes [11 – 20]. The mixing of the EL from the host molecules with excimer/exciplex emissions has also been found to yield white emission [21 – 23]. Other methods involve stacking red-, green- and blue-emissive components on a charge generation layer (CGL) [24 – 29].
