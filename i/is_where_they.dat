5|$|Cunningham {{continued}} with his career. In March 1938 {{he was called}} to readiness with 604 Squadron during the Munich crisis. At this time the squadron was flying the Hawker Demon. He was displeased when they converted to the Bristol Blenheim. The machines were fitted with a tray of four 303 Browning machine guns to give forward-facing firepower. As a long-range fighter it was of dubious value. The German Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Messerschmitt Bf 110 could, and would, expose the frailties of the aircraft which was originally intended as a bomber. However, Cunningham {{was told by the}} Air Ministry that it would be sufficient in the night fighter role, which <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> intended to use this variant. On 20 April 1938, John returned to de Havilland test-flying de Havilland Moth Minors.|$|E
5|$|Julianna Helt {{from the}} Pittsburgh Post-Gazette found that time travel forms a central theme as Miranda {{constantly}} wonders how time travel could be possible. In When You Reach Me, Marcus helps Miranda {{realize that the}} three old ladies from A Wrinkle in Time lied to Meg by promising they would return five minutes before they left. Marcus explains:"So the garden <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> appear when they get {{home at the end}} of the book. Remember? They land in the broccoli. So if they had gotten home five minutes before they left, like those ladies promised they would, then they would have seen themselves get back. Before they did".|$|E
5|$|Maya {{textiles}} {{are very}} poorly {{represented in the}} archaeological record, although by comparison with other pre-Columbian cultures, such as the Aztecs and the Andean region, {{it is likely that}} they were high-value items. A few scraps of textile have been recovered by archaeologists, but the best evidence for textile art <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> are represented in other media, such as painted murals or ceramics. Such secondary representations show the elite of the Maya court adorned with sumptuous cloths, generally these would have been cotton, but jaguar pelts and deer hides are also shown.|$|E

5|$|The ideal {{habitat for}} these rabbits {{is in an}} area between mature and young forests. They use the dense mature forests as {{protection}} and {{for the presence of}} pampas grass, in the summer, and acorns, in the winter, for their diets. They also use the high density of perennial grasses and herbaceous ground cover in the young forests for their diets during different times of the year. Therefore, the best habitat for them to live in <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> have easy access to both young and mature forests with no obstructions between the two forest types.|$|E

25|$|Dioxins are absorbed {{primarily}} through dietary intake of fat, as this <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> accumulate in animals and humans. In humans, the highly chlorinated dioxins {{are stored in}} fatty tissues and are neither readily metabolized nor excreted. The estimated elimination half-life for highly chlorinated dioxins (4–8 chlorine atoms) in humans ranges from 4.9 to 13.1 years.|$|E

McClellan's advance on Richmond was halted and the Army of Northern Virginia {{fell back into}} the Richmond defensive works. The battle was frequently remembered by the Union soldiers as the Battle of Fair Oaks Station because that <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> did their best fighting, whereas the Confederates, for the same reason, called it Seven Pines.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the buffalo}} hunters would proceed {{to the site of}} present-day Lubbock, Texas. This <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> found much of their stolen stock. They learned that the Comanche Indians were {{returning}} to the reservation with Parker. Tafayo had already claimed his stock and a few others. The hunters later declared this was the last Comanche raid in Texas. The first of them would send out word about Nolan's lost command with the speculation that the Comanche had wiped out Nolan's command. The story was sent east by telegraph where it made headline news.|$|E
25|$|A clear {{circumstance}} {{where an}} individual {{may be found}} liable for omitting to act <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> create a dangerous situation, which may reasonably put others at risk. In such instances, if the individual is aware that they have created the risk, they are under an obligation to prevent harm from resulting. The principles outlined by Lord Diplock in R v Miller show clearly {{that there is a}} duty for risk creators to take any measure that is reasonably within their power, and that a failure to do so will often result in criminal liability. Such duties may also arise where an individual, who is unaware of any risk their conduct creates, becomes aware that they have created a dangerous situation, and then fails to act. Where in Fagan v Metropolitan Police Commissioner a man unintentionally drove onto a policeman's foot, it was his failure to move after he became aware of his conduct that formed the basis for his conviction.|$|E

500|$|... "A Milhouse Divided" [...] is {{the only}} episode for which Steve Tompkins has sole writing credit, {{although}} {{he had been a}} part of the writing staff for several years. The writers wanted to do an episode that involved a couple getting divorced. They had wanted to break the sitcom convention that characters who look like they will divorce get back together and have two characters remain divorced even after the episode. The Van Houtens were chosen because the writers felt that they were the most developed couple next to Marge and Homer and the Lovejoys. The scene in the episode [...] "Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming" [...] where Milhouse is in a jet pretending to fire missiles at his parents <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> got the idea to have his parents' marriage be in trouble.|$|E

The ratings received by the episode {{were similar to those}} received during the previous week, and the number of viewers were one of the highest for the year. The critical response to [...] "Regeneration" [...] was mixed, with concerns directed at potential continuity problems, and that the appearance of the Borg was a little obvious. A follow-up episode to [...] "Regeneration" [...] featuring the return of Alice Krige as the Borg Queen was pitched for the fifth season of Star Trek: Enterprise but the show was cancelled before the fifth season could be released and thus the episode never aired.|$|E

They finished the season in eighteenth place in the Premier League and were subsequently relegated to the Championship. [...] Norwich lost in a replay to Fulham in the third round of the FA Cup and to Manchester United in the fourth round of the League Cup. It was a season that saw the sacking of manager Chris Hughton and the appointment of former Norwich player Neil Adams as his replacement with five games left to play.|$|E

Ross panickingly tries fixing the answering machine, wondering to himself out loud if she got off the plane. From behind him, Rachel says she did. They kiss and get back together for good, both agreeing that this <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> want to be. The following morning, the friends gather in Monica and Chandler's empty apartment. With some time remaining before Monica and Chandler leave for their new house, the six all leave their keys to the apartment on the kitchen counter and decide to go for one last cup of coffee together, to which Chandler sarcastically quips, [...] "Where?".
