25|$|A major, but non-technical {{difference}} between Perl 5 and Perl 6 is that Perl 6 {{began as a}} specification. This means that Perl 6 can be re-implemented if needed, and {{it also means that}} programmers don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> source code for the ultimate authority on any given feature. Perl 5's documentation is regarded as excellent, even outside of the Perl community where even mixed reviews typically note its maturity and breadth. However, the documentation is not considered authoritative and only describes the behavior of the actual Perl 5 interpreter informally. Any discrepancies found between the documentation and the implementation may lead to either being changed to reflect the other, a dynamic which drives the continuing development and refinement of the Perl 5 releases.|$|E

500|$|The {{liner notes}} for Revelation {{state that the}} album art is [...] "an artistic interpretation" [...] of Salvation Mountain, a {{monument}} created by Leonard Knight as [...] "a public art project designed to send the message that 'God Loves Everyone'". Located in Calipatria, California, the location is entered in the Congressional Record as a 'national treasure'. The album cover is of Salvation Mountain with the song titles of Revelation composed on it, [...] "to send [...] own message of God's love to the world". According to bassist Tai Anderson, the idea to use Salvation Mountain as the album cover art was lead vocalist Mac Powell's idea. Anderson recalled that Third Day received critiques about the album art, with people claiming it ripped off the cover art of Radiohead's album Hail to the Thief (2003). Although he admits there [...] "are similarities" [...] between the two, Anderson denied that the band based the design off of [...] "outside sources". Anderson also said he was {{more concerned with the}} album art's coloring, as [...] "red-skewed" [...] album covers had been used by bands such as U2 and Green Day. In hindsight, Anderson felt that the band [...] "probably would have used one of the other images from the packaging on the cover just so we wouldn't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> one star critiques on iTunes which never reference the music, just the album cover".|$|E

2500|$|In 1977, Brando made a rare {{television}} {{appearance in}} the miniseries , portraying George Lincoln Rockwell; he won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie for his performance. In 1978, he narrated the English version of Raoni, a French-Belgian documentary film directed by Jean-Pierre Dutilleux and Luiz Carlos Saldanha {{that focused on the}} life of Raoni Metuktire and issues surrounding the survival of the indigenous Indian tribes of north central Brazil. Brando portrayed Superman's father Jor-El in the 1978 film Superman. He agreed to the role only on assurance that he would be paid a large sum for what amounted to a small part, that he would not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> script beforehand, and that his lines would be displayed somewhere off-camera. It was revealed in a documentary contained in the 2001 DVD release of Superman that he was paid $3.7million for two weeks of work. Brando also filmed scenes for the movie's sequel, Superman II, but after producers refused to pay him the same percentage he received for the first movie, he denied them permission to use the footage. [...] "I asked for my usual percentage," [...] he recollected in his memoir, [...] "but they refused, and so did I." [...] However, after Brando's death, the footage was reincorporated into the 2006 re-cut of the film, [...] and in the 2006 [...] "loose sequel" [...] Superman Returns, in which both used and unused archive footage of him as Jor-El from the first two Superman films was remastered for a scene in the Fortress of Solitude, and Brando's voice-overs were used throughout the film.|$|E

I have got {{quite a lot of}} Victor Hugo done; and not I think so badly: {{pitching}} into this work has straightened me up a good deal. It is the devil's own weather but that is a trifle. I must know when Cornhill must see it. I can send some of it in a week easily, but I still <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>The</b> Laughing Man,[13] and I mean to wait until I get to London and have the loan of that from you. If I buy anything more this production will not pay itself. The first part is not too well written, though it has good stuff in it.|$|E
60|$|It must be {{admitted}} that, looking back upon history, {{we have not}} always been good allies, nor yet generous co-partners in the battlefield. The first is the fault of our politics, where one party rejoices to break what the other has bound. The makers of the Treaty are staunch enough, as the Tories were under Pitt and Castlereagh, or the Whigs at the time of Queen Anne, but sooner or later the others must come in. At the end of the Marlborough wars we suddenly vamped up a peace and, left our allies in the lurch, on account of a change in domestic politics. We did the same with Frederick the Great, and would have done it in the Napoleonic days if Fox could have controlled the country. And as to our partners of the battlefield, how little we have ever said that is hearty as to the splendid staunchness of the Prussians at Waterloo. You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> Frenchman, Houssaye, to get a central view and to understand the part they played. Think of old Blucher, seventy years old, and ridden over by a regiment of charging cavalry the day before, yet swearing that he would come to Wellington if he had to be strapped to his horse. He nobly redeemed his promise.|$|E
60|$|AN art {{may become}} impersonal {{because it has}} too much {{circumstance}} or too little, because the world is too little or too much with it, because it is too near the ground or too far up among the branches. I met an old man out fishing a year ago, who said to me, 'Don Quixote and Odysseus are always near to me'; that is true for me also, for even Hamlet and Lear and Oedipus are more cloudy.[1] No playwright ever has made or ever will make a character that will follow {{us out of the}} theatre as Don Quixote follows us out of the book, for no playwright can be wholly episodical, and when one constructs, bringing one's characters into complicated relations with one another, something impersonal comes into the story. Society, fate, 'tendency,' something not quite human, begins to arrange the characters and to excite into action only so much of their humanity as they find it necessary to show to one another. The common heart will always love better the tales that have something of an old wives' tale and that look upon their hero from every side as if he alone were wonderful, as a child does with a new penny. In plays of a comedy too extravagant to photograph life, or written in verse, the construction is of a necessity woven out of naked motives and passions, but when an atmosphere of modern reality has to be built up as well, and the tendency, or fate, or society has to be shown as it is about ourselves, the characters grow fainter, and we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> book many times or see the play many times before we can remember them. Even then they are only possible in a certain drawing-room and among such and such people, and we must carry all that lumber in our heads. I thought Tolstoi's 'War and Peace' the greatest story I had ever read, and yet it has gone from me; even Lancelot, ever a shadow, is more visible in my memory than all its substance.|$|E
