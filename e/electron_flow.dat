5|$|Alternating current, {{commonly}} used when welding aluminum and magnesium manually or semi-automatically, combines the two direct currents {{by making the}} electrode and base material alternate between positive and negative charge. This causes the <b>electron</b> <b>flow</b> to switch directions constantly, preventing the tungsten electrode from overheating while maintaining the heat in the base material. Surface oxides are still removed during the electrode-positive portion of the cycle and the base metal is heated more deeply during the electrode-negative portion of the cycle. Some power supplies enable operators to use an unbalanced alternating current wave by modifying the exact percentage of time that the current spends in each state of polarity, giving them {{more control over the}} amount of heat and cleaning action supplied by the power source. In addition, operators must be wary of rectification, in which the arc fails to reignite as it passes from straight polarity (negative electrode) to reverse polarity (positive electrode). To remedy the problem, a square wave power supply can be used, as can high-frequency voltage to encourage ignition.|$|E

In other words, <b>electrons</b> <b>flowing</b> across the contact point in a switch will never actually leave the switch.|$|R
25|$|Recent {{investigations}} {{suggest that}} complex I {{is a potent}} source of reactive oxygen species. Complex I can produce superoxide (as well as hydrogen peroxide), through at least two different pathways. During forward electron transfer, only very small amounts of superoxide are produced (probably less than 0.1% of the overall <b>electron</b> <b>flow).</b>|$|E
25|$|There {{also exist}} PTOX cyanophages that contain {{copies of the}} gene for the plastid oxidase. They are known to act as viral vectors for {{movement}} of the gene between cyanobacterial species. Some {{evidence suggests that the}} phages may use the oxidase to influence photosynthetic <b>electron</b> <b>flow</b> to produce more ATP and less NADPH because viral synthesis utilizes more ATP.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{more than}} 50 {{years of study}} of complex I, no inhibitors {{blocking}} the <b>electron</b> <b>flow</b> inside the enzyme have been found. Hydrophobic inhibitors like rotenone or piericidin most likely disrupt the electron transfer between the terminal FeS cluster N2 and ubiquinone. It {{has been shown that}} long-term systemic inhibition of complex I by rotenone can induce selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons.|$|E

25|$|This form of {{photophosphorylation}} {{occurs on}} the thylakoid membrane. In cyclic <b>electron</b> <b>flow,</b> the electron begins in a pigment complex called photosystem I, passes {{from the primary}} acceptor to pheophytin, then to cytochrome b6f (a similar complex to that found in mitochondria), and then to plastocyanin before returning to chlorophyll. This transport chain produces a proton-motive force, pumping H+ ions across the membrane; this produces a concentration gradient {{that can be used}} to power ATP synthase during chemiosmosis. This pathway is known as cyclic photophosphorylation, and it produces neither O2 nor NADPH. Unlike non-cyclic photophosphorylation, NADP+ does not accept the electrons; they are instead sent back to cytochrome b6f complex.|$|E
25|$|In fully {{developed}} chloroplasts, prolonged exposure to light increases {{the activity of}} the oxidase. Because the enzyme acts at the plastoquinone pool in between photosystem II and photosystem I, it {{may play a role in}} controlling <b>electron</b> <b>flow</b> through photosynthesis by acting as an alternative electron sink. Similar to its role in carotenoid synthesis, its oxidase activity may prevent the over-reduction of photosystem I electron acceptors and damage by photoinhibition. A recent analysis of electron flux through the photosynthetic pathway shows that even when activated, the electron flux plastid terminal oxidase diverts is two orders of magnitude less than the total flux through photosynthetic electron transport. This suggests that the protein may play less of a role than previously thought in relieving the oxidative stress in photosynthesis.|$|E
25|$|All redox {{reactions}} {{take place}} in the hydrophilic domain of complex I. NADH initially binds to complex I, and transfers two electrons to the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) prosthetic group of the enzyme, creating FMNH2. The electron acceptor – the isoalloxazine ring – of FMN is identical to that of FAD. The electrons are then transferred through the FMN via a series of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters, and finally to coenzyme Q10 (ubiquinone). This <b>electron</b> <b>flow</b> changes the redox state of the protein, inducing conformational changes of the protein which alters the pK values of ionizable side chain, and causes four hydrogen ions to be pumped out of the mitochondrial matrix. Ubiquinone (CoQ) accepts two electrons to be reduced to ubiquinol (CoQH2).|$|E

In this step, the carboxyl group oxygen is deprotonated by a nearby Tyrosine amino acid and those <b>electrons</b> <b>flow</b> down to carbon 2. Carbon dioxide leaves the beta carbon of isocitrate as a leaving group with the <b>electrons</b> <b>flowing</b> to the ketone oxygen off the alpha-C placing a negative charge on the oxygen of the alpha-C and forming an alpha-beta unsaturated double bond between carbons 2 and 3.

25|$|Photoinhibition {{occurs in}} all organisms capable of oxygenic photosynthesis, from {{vascular}} plants to cyanobacteria. In both plants and cyanobacteria, blue light causes photoinhibition {{more efficiently than}} other wavelengths of visible light, and all wavelengths of ultraviolet light are more efficient than wavelengths of visible light. Photoinhibition {{is a series of}} reactions that inhibit different activities of PSII, but there is no consensus on what these steps are. The activity of the oxygen-evolving complex of PSII is often found to be lost before the rest of the reaction centre loses activity. However, inhibition of PSII membranes under anaerobic conditions leads primarily to inhibition of electron transfer on the acceptor side of PSII. Ultraviolet light causes inhibition of the oxygen-evolving complex before the rest of PSII becomes inhibited. Photosystem I (PSI) is less susceptible to light-induced damage than PSII, but slow inhibition of this photosystem has been observed. Photoinhibition of PSI occurs in chilling-sensitive plants and the reaction depends on <b>electron</b> <b>flow</b> from PSII to PSI.|$|E
2500|$|Biochemically, anoxygenic {{photosynthesis}} is {{very different}} from oxygenic photosynthesis. [...] Cyanobacteria (and by extension, chloroplasts) use the Z scheme of <b>electron</b> <b>flow</b> in which electrons eventually are used to form NADH. [...] Two different reaction centers (photosystems) are used and proton motive force is generated both by using cyclic <b>electron</b> <b>flow</b> and the quinone pool. [...] In anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria, <b>electron</b> <b>flow</b> is cyclic, with all electrons used in photosynthesis eventually being transferred back to the single reaction center. [...] A proton motive force is generated using only the quinone pool. [...] In heliobacteria, Green sulfur, and Green non-sulfur bacteria, NADH is formed using the protein ferredoxin, an energetically favorable reaction. [...] In purple bacteria, NADH is formed by reverse <b>electron</b> <b>flow</b> due to the lower chemical potential of this reaction center. [...] In all cases, however, a proton motive force is generated and used to drive ATP production via an ATPase.|$|E

2500|$|As a result, chloroplasts in [...] {{mesophyll}} {{cells and}} bundle sheath cells are specialized for {{each stage of}} photosynthesis. In mesophyll cells, chloroplasts are specialized for the light reactions, so they lack RuBisCO, and have normal grana and thylakoids, which they use to make ATP and NADPH, as well as oxygen. They store [...] in a four-carbon compound, {{which is why the}} process is called [...] photosynthesis. The four-carbon compound is then transported to the bundle sheath chloroplasts, where it drops off [...] and returns to the mesophyll. Bundle sheath chloroplasts do not carry out the light reactions, preventing oxygen from building up in them and disrupting RuBisCO activity. Because of this, they lack thylakoids organized into grana stacks—though bundle sheath chloroplasts still have free-floating thylakoids in the stroma where they still carry out cyclic <b>electron</b> <b>flow,</b> a light-driven method of synthesizing ATP to power the Calvin cycle without generating oxygen. They lack photosystem II, and only have photosystem I—the only protein complex needed for cyclic <b>electron</b> <b>flow.</b> Because the job of bundle sheath chloroplasts is to carry out the Calvin cycle and make sugar, they often contain large starch grains.|$|E
2500|$|The {{oscillating}} currents flowing {{around the}} cavities, and {{their effect on}} the <b>electron</b> <b>flow</b> within the tube, causes large amounts of microwave radiofrequency energy to be generated in the cavities.

In some systems the tap wire is replaced by an open hole, which allows the microwaves to flow into a waveguide.|$|E

2500|$|Tubes have {{different}} functions, such as cathode ray tubes which create {{a beam of}} electrons for display purposes (such as the television picture tube) in addition to more specialized functions such as electron microscopy and electron beam lithography.

2500|$|Electron and proton cycling {{are very}} complex {{but as a}} net result only one proton is {{translocated}} across the membrane per molecule of ammonia oxidized.

[...] Oxygen is required in both ammonia and nitrite oxidation, meaning that both nitrosifying and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria are aerobes. [...] As in sulfur and iron oxidation, NADH for carbon dioxide fixation using the Calvin cycle is generated by reverse <b>electron</b> <b>flow,</b> thereby placing a further metabolic burden on an already energy-poor process.|$|E
40|$|Coupled multielectrode array sensors (MAS) may {{underestimate}} non-uniform corrosion {{rates in}} cases where the environment is not significantly corrosive because of possible internal <b>electron</b> <b>flows</b> on the most corroding electrode. An improved method was developed to derive the lower and upper bounding values for the non-uniform corrosion rate measured with the MAS probes. The lower boundary was measured when the electrodes of the MAS probe were at the natural coupling potential. The upper boundary was measured when the coupling potential of the MAS probe was raised to a value at which all electrodes are likely to be anodic. Under such raised coupling potential, possible internal <b>electron</b> <b>flows</b> within the most anodic electrode were stopped and their effects on the measured corrosion rate were eliminated...|$|R
