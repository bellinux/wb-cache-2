5|$|Hood {{was due to}} be modernised in 1941 {{to bring}} her up to a {{standard}} {{similar to that of}} other modernised World War I-era capital ships.

Her 5-inch upper armour strake would have been removed and her deck armour reinforced. A catapult would have been fitted across the deck and the remaining torpedo tubes removed. In addition the conning tower would have been removed and her bridge rebuilt. The ship's near-constant active service, resulting from her status as the Royal Navy's most battle-worthy fast capital ship, meant that her material condition gradually deteriorated, and by the mid-1930s she was <b>in</b> <b>need</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lengthy overhaul.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{described}} the application and feasibility of exposure therapy treatment (ET) for {{posttraumatic stress disorder}} (PTSD) in a multitraumatized tortured refugee with chronic PTSD and depression, <b>in</b> <b>need</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> interpreter. The patient received 26 one-hour sessions of ET involving exposure to his trauma-related memories.

Treatment led to a significant improvement across all measures of posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and depression, and the improvement was maintained at the 12 -month follow-up. The results from this case study provide further preliminary evidence that ET may be effective in treating multi-traumatized torture survivors who are refugees and <b>in</b> <b>need</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> interpreter, despite the additional stressors and symptoms complexity experienced by tortured refugees...|$|R

During Everton's tenure at the stadium, stands were erected for some of the 8,000-plus spectators regularly attending matches, although the ground was capable of holding around 20,000 spectators and occasionally did.

Anfield's first league match was played on 8 September 1888, between Everton and Accrington F.C. Everton quickly improved as a team, and became Anfield's first league champions in the 1890–91 season.|$|E

The player does this by using four different moves: running, dashing, jumping, and super-jumping. The player gains points by collecting Pepsi cans.|$|E
