25|$|Like acceleration, {{colloquium}} provides {{advanced material}} {{for high school}} students. In colloquium, students take Advanced Placement courses. However, colloquium is different from AP classes because students are usually given more projects than students in AP classes. Students in colloquium also generally study topics more in depth and sometimes in a <b>different</b> <b>way</b> <b>than</b> students enrolled in AP classes do. Colloquium is a form {{that takes place in}} a traditional public school. In colloquium, subjects are grouped together. Subjects are taught at different times of the day; however, usually what is being taught in one subject will connect with another subject. For example, if the students are learning about colonial America in History, then they might also be analyzing text from The Scarlet Letter in English. Some schools may only have colloquium in certain subjects. In schools where colloquium is only offered in English and History, colloquium students usually take Advanced Placement courses in math and science and vice versa.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} {{designers of}} gross product accounts (such as Simon Kuznets, Colin Clark, Edward Fulton Denison and Richard Stone) aimed precisely to exclude any capital gains (or other income from asset transactions and revaluations) from their measure of gross output, just like transfer payments. They wanted a reliable standard {{measure that would}} indicate changes {{in the value of}} the net new addition to wealth per year or per quarter: roughly, the total sales revenue from production less intermediate costs, or, the value of total outputs produced less the value of goods and services used up to produce them, or, the sum of factor incomes directly generated by production. The issue then is, how exactly the grossing and netting must be done to obtain the value of total output, and it is done in a <b>different</b> <b>way</b> <b>than</b> business itself would do it (to eliminate non-production income/expenditure, ensure uniform valuation, and remove double counting; from the point of view of national accounts, in fact real credits can become theoretical debits, and real debits can become theoretical credits).|$|E
500|$|The text on {{the walls}} was the formal hieroglyphic script. Some texts were written in a [...] "cryptographic" [...] form, using symbols in a <b>different</b> <b>way</b> <b>than</b> the normal {{conventions}} of hieroglyphic writing. Cryptographic text became more widespread and more complex in Ptolemaic times. Temple walls also frequently bear written or drawn graffiti, both in modern languages and in ancient ones such as Greek, Latin, and Demotic, the form of Egyptian that was commonly used in Greco-Roman times. Although {{not part of the}} temple's formal decoration, graffiti can be an important source of information about its history, both when its cults were functioning and after its abandonment. Ancient graffiti, for instance, often mention the names and titles of priests who worked in the temple, and modern travelers often inscribed their names in temples that they visited. Graffiti left by priests and pilgrims at Philae include the last ancient hieroglyphic text, inscribed in AD 394, and the last one in Demotic script, from AD 452.|$|E

[...] The costs of obtaining licensing rights for music from [...] "big bands" [...] such as AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, Van Halen, and Metallica, in addition to the lack of understanding of how the music would be used prevented these groups from being used in Guitar Hero. [...] However, Tam notes that with the success of Guitar Hero, [...] "They understand that we're not going to embarrass their music, we're going to actually pay homage to their music and get it to the point where people are going to fall in love with their music and understand their music in a totally <b>different</b> <b>way</b> <b>than</b> they've ever experienced it before."

500|$|The {{development}} {{phases of}} the Age of Empires games were similar in several ways. Due to the games being based on historical events, the team often had to do large amounts of research. However, the research was not in depth, which, according to Age of Empires designer Bruce Shelley, is [...] "a good idea for most entertainment products." [...] Shelley also said that Ensemble Studios took most of the reference material from children's sections at libraries. He pointed out the goal was for the players of the game to have fun, [...] "not [...] designers or researchers." [...] At the Games Convention Developers Conference in 2007, Shelley continued with this thought and explained {{that the success of}} the series laid in [...] "making a game which appealed to both the casual and hardcore gamer." [...] Shelley also remarked the Age of Empires games were not about history in itself, but rather [...] "about the human experience;" [...] they focused not simply on what humans had done but on what they could do in the future such as [...] "going into space." [...] Ensemble Studios developed Age of Mythology in a <b>different</b> <b>way</b> <b>than</b> the previous two games.

Buchman explained how his main concept for the episode was to describe O'Malley's grieving in a <b>different</b> <b>way</b> <b>than</b> depicted for Stevens, but {{in a manner that}} would be both bothering to her and painful for his partner, Torres. However, he stated that Torres' emotional state during the mourning was also significant to the episode: [...] "We wanted Callie to feel some remorse. She finally got George, but not in the way she wanted. She's gotten his body, but the underlying relationship isn't there anymore." [...] Buchman disclosed that one of the story lines he had originally intended to include in the scrip was Yang and Burke's cold relationship being [...] "kept alive" [...] by having silent sex, which ultimately did not occur, due to being looked upon as [...] "boring, neither dramatic, nor comedic", and also as not being descriptive of the character's feelings. The story line involving the four attending physicians fighting for the title of chief of surgery, was described by Buchman as a comic relief, used to emphasize a childish side of the characters' personalities which had not been previously developed. In addition, Buchman described Webber's retirement as an attempt to reconcile with his estranged wife, but leads to emotional devastation at the realization that she had moved on with a different man.|$|E
500|$|Upon Pixar's {{acceptance}} of the project, Brad Bird was asked to bring in his own team for the production. He brought up {{a core group of}} people he worked with on The Iron Giant. Because of this, many 2-D artists had to make the shift to 3-D, including Bird himself. Bird found working with CG [...] "wonderfully malleable" [...] in a way that traditional animation is not, calling the camera's ability to easily switch angles in a given scene [...] "marvelously adaptable." [...] He found working in computer animation [...] "difficult" [...] in a <b>different</b> <b>way</b> <b>than</b> working traditionally, finding the software [...] "sophisticated and not particularly friendly." [...] Bird wrote the script without knowing the limitations or concerns that went hand-in-hand with the medium of computer animation. As a result, this was to be the most complex film yet for Pixar. The film's characters were designed by Tony Fucile and Teddy Newton, whom Bird had brought with him from Warner Bros. Like most computer-animated films, The Incredibles had a year-long period of building the film from the inside out: modeling the exterior and understanding controls that work face and body—the articulation of the character—before animation could even begin. Bird and Fucile tried to emphasize the graphic quality of good 2-D animation to the Pixar team, who'd only worked primarily in CG. Bird attempted to incorporate teaching from Disney's Nine Old Men that the crew at Pixar had [...] "never really emphasized." ...|$|E
500|$|Fun Home {{has several}} themes {{recurring}} throughout the book. The biggest theme, arguably, is sexual orientation. Bechdel tells {{the readers of}} her journey of discovering her own sexuality through books. [...] "My realization at nineteen that I was a lesbian came about {{in a manner consistent}} with my bookish upbringing." [...] Her exposure (from reading literal definitions in dictionaries, reading interviews of others like her, etc.) helped her come to terms with her sexuality, but in truth, the hints of it plagued her childhood: her desire [...] "for the right to exchange [...] tank suit for a pair of shorts" [...] in Cannes" [...] or her desire for her brothers to call her Albert instead of Alison on one camping trip. [...] However, Bechdel also reveals that she wasn't alone in her choice of partners; her father also exhibited some homosexual behaviors, but in a <b>different</b> <b>way</b> <b>than</b> Alison. [...] "I'd been upstaged, demoted from protagonist in my own drama to comic relief in my parents' tragedy" [...] when her mother reveals Bechdel's father's secret. Though both, father and daughter, had similar situations (Bechdel was a lesbian while her father was gay or bisexual), the two handled their issues differently. Bechdel chose to accept the fact and not hide from the issue, taking a female partner and going to [...] "gay union" [...] meetings when she was a student at Oberlin College. Bechdel was open about her sexuality before she'd even been in a same-sex relationship (of any sort). Her father, on the other hand, had had countless affairs with men but wasn't open about it. [...] This may be due to homophobia (his and/or others'), or because he was married with a family. In any case, it is clear that he is afraid of coming out, as illustrated by [...] "the fear in his eyes" [...] when the conversation topic is dangerously close to homosexuality.|$|E

500|$|According to Fedor Kondratev, {{an expert}} of the Serbsky Center and {{supporter}} of Snezhnevsky {{and his colleagues}} who developed the concept of sluggish schizophrenia in the 1960s, those arrested by the KGB under RSFSR Criminal Code Article 70 ("anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda"), 190-1 ("dissemination of knowingly false fabrications that defame the Soviet state and social system") made up, in those years, the main group targeted by the period of using psychiatry for political purposes. It was they who began to be searched for [...] "psychopathological mechanisms" [...] and, therefore, mental illness which gave the grounds to recognize an accused person as mentally incompetent, to debar him from appearance and defence in court, and then to send him for compulsory treatment to a special psychiatric hospital of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The trouble (not guilt) of Soviet psychiatric science was its theoretical overideologization {{as a result of}} the strict demand to severely preclude any deviations from the [...] "exclusively scientific" [...] concept of Marxism–Leninism. This showed, in particular, in the fact that Soviet psychiatry under the totalitarian regime considered that penetrating the inner life of an ill person was flawed psychologization, existentionalization. In this connection, one did not admit the possibility that an individual can behave [...] "in a <b>different</b> <b>way</b> <b>than</b> others do" [...] not only because of his mental illness but on the ground alone of his moral sets consistently with his conscience. It entailed the consequence: if a person different from all others opposes the political system, one needs to search for [...] "psychopathological mechanisms" [...] of his dissent. Even in cases when catamnesis confirmed the correctness of a diagnosis of schizophrenia, it did not always mean that mental disorders were the cause of dissent and, all the more, that one needed to administer compulsory treatment [...] "for it" [...] in special psychiatric hospitals. What seems essential is another fact that the mentally ill could oppose the totalitarianism as well, by no means due to their [...] "psychopathological mechanisms", but as persons who, despite having the diagnosis of schizophrenia, retained moral civic landmarks. Any ill person with schizophrenia could be a dissident if his conscience could not keep silent, Kondratev says.|$|E
