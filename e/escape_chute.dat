5000|$|<b>Escape</b> <b>chutes</b> {{are used}} and {{proposed}} {{for use in}} evacuation of mining equipment and high-rise buildings.|$|R
5000|$|Pinball (Par 3): The level {{begins as}} a game of pinball, where the player can hit the ball with the {{flippers}} after shooting it. Two drop targets must be hit before the top left corner <b>escape</b> <b>chute</b> is activated. Although enough failures to hit the drop targets will release {{the ball to the}} bottom part of the course with the hole, hitting the targets and <b>escape</b> <b>chute</b> leads directly to the hole and activates a 1 stroke bonus.|$|E
50|$|A modern type of {{evacuation}} slide is the vertical spiral <b>escape</b> <b>chute,</b> {{which is a}} common means of evacuation for buildings and other structures.|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} had {{a single}} pilot cockpit together with a rear-gunner site and an <b>escape</b> <b>chute.</b> It also featured brainwashing equipment and wing-tip mounted searchlights.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to fixed <b>escape</b> <b>chutes</b> permanently installed onto buildings, mobile escape systems are produced {{which can be}} mounted on the basket of a movable fire truck ladder, or temporarily installed to a building in an emergency.|$|R
50|$|The airport's {{emergency}} services extinguished the fire {{within five minutes}} of the mayday call. Fourteen people were lightly injured, mostly from sliding down the <b>escape</b> <b>chutes,</b> and treated at Sunrise Hospital & Medical Center. The fire caused a large hole in the cargo hold and damage to the engine.|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} {{acknowledged}} that the larger sea turtles, primarily large loggerheads and leatherbacks are too large to fit through the escape hatches installed in most TEDs. These turtles remain trapped within the net and perish. U.S. legislation introduced in 2003 has attempted {{to address this issue}} by increasing the size of the <b>escape</b> <b>chutes</b> in the devices.|$|R
5000|$|In 1948, the 136-bed Georgia Baptist Hospital in Atlanta {{featured}} a large fabric <b>escape</b> <b>chute</b> that was {{claimed to be}} able to empty the hospital [...] "in only a few minutes".|$|E
50|$|An <b>escape</b> <b>chute</b> {{system was}} {{installed}} at the Cape Canaveral launchpads for the now-discontinued NASA Space Shuttle, to allow personnel to rapidly reach a safety refuge blast shelter {{in the event of}} an imminent fire or explosion. The system was tested, but never deployed in actual use.|$|E
50|$|M.C.Dathan, {{director}} of Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC), stated that ISRO will {{set up a}} full-fledged training facility in Bangalore for training astronauts. ISRO is also planning to build a third launch pad at Sriharkota for manned missions with extra facilities like entry into the crew capsule and an <b>escape</b> <b>chute.</b>|$|E
50|$|The same {{reaction}} occurs upon {{heating the}} salt to approximately 300 °C. The sodium that is formed {{is a potential}} hazard alone and, in automobile airbags, it is converted by reaction with other ingredients, such as potassium nitrate and silica. In the latter case, innocuous sodium silicates are generated. Sodium azide is also used in airplane <b>escape</b> <b>chutes.</b> Newer generation air bags contain nitroguanidine or similar less sensitive explosives.|$|R
5000|$|The {{emergency}} <b>escape</b> <b>chutes</b> {{were deployed}} and {{passengers and crew}} were ordered to quickly evacuate the aircraft. At 02:12 local time, just five minutes after the assault had commenced, the commandos radioed: [...] "Frühlingszeit! Frühlingszeit!" [...] ("Springtime! Springtime!"), which was the code word for the successful completion of the operation. A few moments later a radio signal was sent to Chancellor Schmidt in Bonn: [...] "Four opponents down - hostages free - four hostages slightly wounded - one commando slightly wounded".|$|R
50|$|A Korean Airlines (KAL) Airbus A300 skidded off {{the runway}} and {{exploded}} {{after trying to}} land on the island of Cheju, but all 160 aboard escaped without serious injury. The crew pushed the passengers down the <b>escape</b> <b>chutes</b> through the smoke and into the rain. The crash occurred shortly after 11 am when the pilot of flight 2033 from Seoul to Cheju, made a second attempt {{to land on the}} seaside runway in extremely powerful winds of up to 64 mph and heavy rains. The Cheju medical clinic treated seven passengers and one crew member for minor injuries.|$|R
5000|$|... 11:59 AM - Scheduled {{arrival at}} JFK. According to Slater, {{he gets into}} an {{argument}} with a passenger over a package. Slater tells the passengers to [...] "go fuck yourselves," [...] grabs two Blue Moon beers, and deploys the <b>escape</b> <b>chute,</b> slides down and then drives home from his car parked at the airport.|$|E
50|$|A marine {{evacuation}} system (MES) is a lifesaving device {{found on}} many modern passenger ships consisting of an inflatable slide or <b>escape</b> <b>chute</b> where passenger can evacuate straight into waiting life rafts. Developed in 1979 by RFD, a New Zealand based company that distributes safety equipment; MES is replacing traditional davit-launched life rafts used on ships.|$|E
50|$|Although {{some early}} escape tubes were made entirely of metal, most current designs {{are made of}} {{high-strength}} fabrics, such as Kevlar. Their flexibility allows for compact storage, rapid deployment, and a gentler braking and controlled descent of users, as compared to traditional metal designs. Fabric tubes may also incorporate inflatable elements to lend some degree of structural rigidity and stability to the <b>escape</b> <b>chute.</b> The fabrics chosen must have fire retardant properties as well.|$|E
50|$|In {{the process}} of chasing Mickey and Minnie, Pete has an anvil fall {{on his head and}} fires rivets at them with a {{handheld}} pneumatic hammer. This turns on him when the hammer falls into his pants and gets attached to his peg leg. The mice <b>escape</b> down a <b>chute</b> riding a wheelbarrow, while Pete falls into a cement mixer and accidentally dismantles {{a large portion of the}} building.|$|R
50|$|The attack {{causes the}} frightened {{children}} {{to reveal the}} existence of a hidden room, which Linda finds and secretly photographs Dietrich's top-secret papers. When Dietrich invites her to the opera, her cover is blown by Margrete's mother, who believes her to be a friend of her daughter's from college. She flees from the Dietrich home and seeks sanctuary with Margrete, only to find that she is a double agent who betrayed Linda's cousins. Margrete shoots her, wounding her, but she overpowers Margrete and kills her. She slips down the laundry <b>chute,</b> <b>escaping</b> the German officers raiding Margrete's apartment.|$|R
50|$|Joan {{attempts}} {{to use the}} garden project run by Sonia Stevens as an alternative way to bring in drugs. Sonia initially refuses but after Joan convinces her that they are similar, Sonia agrees. Will Jackson has become suspicious of Jake's drug activities and Joan tells him to plant drugs in Will's locker, which Will manages to get rid of. After catching Franky and Allie in the laundry chute, the two kiss to cover up their attempt to <b>escape</b> via the <b>chute.</b> Joan relays this incident to Bridget, who has been struggling with Franky being in prison, causing Bridget to leave.|$|R
50|$|Foregoing the {{requirement}} to carry palleted or podded cargoes, Mil redesigned the Mi-10 with a much shorter, fixed, four-leg undercarriage and replaced the extendible <b>escape</b> <b>chute</b> with a gondola fitted with flying controls for a pilot to fly the aircraft during slung load operations. The remainder of the aircraft is essentially identical with the long-legged version. Seventeen of the new flying crane were produced as the Mi-10K, including two conversions from Mi-10s from 23 March 1974 to 1977.|$|E
50|$|An <b>escape</b> <b>chute</b> is {{a special}} kind of {{emergency}} exit, used where conventional fire escape stairways are impractical. The chute is a fabric (or occasionally metal) tube installed near a special exit on an upper floor or roof of a building, or a tall structure. During use, the chute is deployed, and may be secured at the bottom by a fire fighting crew some distance out from the building. Once the tube is ready, escapees enter the tube and slide down to a lower level or the ground level.|$|E
50|$|The first {{prototype}} V-10 {{emerged with}} canted main undercarriage legs with single wheels {{on all four}} legs, {{as well as a}} retractable emergency <b>escape</b> <b>chute</b> extending below the cockpit and external auxiliary fuel tanks either side of the centre fuselage. As development progressed the main undercarriage legs were replaced with vertical units carrying twin wheels, twin nose undercarriage wheels after a period retaining the single wheels, an Auxiliary power unit (APU) installed behind the cockpit on the starboard side and emergency escape slide cables for use when the pallet is carried.|$|E
50|$|The splash dam was {{equipped}} with a chute to allow water and logs to <b>escape.</b> When the <b>chute</b> was closed, water collected behind the dam. Construction work also extended to the stream below the splash dam, {{which had to be}} cleared of obstacles and often had its banks cleared for some distance above the waterline. This was an effort to prevent as many logs as possible from becoming stuck {{on the banks of the}} creek. The Pennsylvania General Assembly passed a law on March 28, 1871 allowing splash dam construction and clearing of creeks to allow loose logs to float better.|$|R
5000|$|Some VNAF {{aircraft}} did stay {{to continue}} to fight the advancing NVA however. One AC-119K gunship from 821st. Attack Squadron, {{had spent the night}} of 28/29 April dropping flares and firing on the approaching NVA. At dawn on 29 April two A-1 Skyraiders began patrolling the perimeter of Tan Son Nhut at 2500 feet until Maj. Trương Phùng, one of the two Skyraider was shot down, presumably by an SA-7. At 07:00 the AC-119K [...] "Tinh Long" [...] flew by Lt. Trang van Thanh was firing on NVA to the east of Tan Son Nhut when it was hit by a SA-7 missile, and fell in flames to the ground. Sgt. Son, one of the AC-119K gunner tried to <b>escape</b> but his <b>chute</b> tangled in the tail of the airplane.|$|R
5000|$|Early {{in their}} career, Gannon and Hands joined a city task force, the Sanitary Investigations Committee, and went the extra step {{of living in}} a New York {{tenement}} in order to better understand urban living conditions for the poor. Calling New York's tenements [...] "a reproach to the humanitarianism of this enlightened century," [...] they set to work to find better solutions to urban housing for the poor. The firm quickly became noted for designing innovative apartment buildings that were affordable, sanitary, well-ventilated, and practical. One of their model tenements was designed around a central court (for light and air), with balconies for each apartment, front and rear fire <b>escapes,</b> and ash <b>chutes</b> and garbage receptacles for refuse management. Some were specifically designed for the rising class of young urban working women, and the partners were elected to the Women's Health Protective Association of New York.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the first}} fire escapes of any type was invented in 18th-century England. In 1784, Daniel Maseres, of England, invented a machine called a fire escape, which, being {{fastened}} to the window, would enable a person to descend to the street without injury. Abraham Wivell created an improved design, including an <b>escape</b> <b>chute,</b> after becoming superintendent of the [...] "Royal Society for the Protection of Life from Fire." [...] Henry Vieregg patented the first US fire escape in Grand Island, NE in November 8, 1898 , serial number 681,672, which was designed for traveling businessmen.|$|E
50|$|Troposphere 5 {{carrying}} a rat named Kavira on board, {{was designed to}} reach an altitude of 36 km and a speed of Mach 3. The rocket was launched at Menkao launch site. Launch ended in failure - the rocket took off but had deviated from its course and {{was lost in the}} distance. The cost of this rocket has been estimated at about $50,000. Despite Troposphere 5 being equipped with an <b>escape</b> <b>chute,</b> Kavira was never found and was officially reported to have died in the name of science. According to Keka the experiment provided valuable data for future tests by the DTA.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{aircraft}} {{evacuation slide}} {{was developed and}} produced by Air Cruisers, founded by James F. Boyle, inventor of the World War II life vest, the [...] "Mae West". [...] The patent for the inflatable <b>escape</b> <b>chute</b> assembly was submitted by Boyle in 1954 and the designs was patented in 1956 under patent number 2,765,131. Today Air Cruisers provides slides for over 65% of the aircraft slide market. Prior to inflatables, some passenger aircraft utilized canvas type slides which required the crew to undertake an extensive rigging procedure. Canvas type slides are still found on some Russian aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|In early February 2017, high inflows to Lake Oroville caused dam {{operators}} to start using the concrete main spillway {{to control the}} lake level. Between February 6-10, 2017, 12.8 in of rain fell on the Feather River Basin. Inflow of water into Lake Oroville rose from [...] on February 6 to over [...] at mid-day on February 7, before subsiding to about [...] the following day. Dam operators began increasing the flow down the main spillway to [...] on February 7 but soon noticed an unusual flow pattern. The flow of water down the spillway was stopped for investigation, revealing a crater about halfway down the spillway where the concrete lining was eroded through and water was <b>escaping</b> the concrete <b>chute.</b> The DWR consulted with FERC and other dam safety agencies about the issue and prepared {{for the possibility of}} using the emergency spillway.|$|R
50|$|The Toa Metru, fully {{confident}} in their victory over the Morbuzahk, arrived at the Colessium to present themselves to Turaga Dume and the Matoran population as the new defenders of Metru Nui. However, instead of being praised them as the Toa, they were challenged by Turaga Dume to cross the Colessium's field. The Toa Metru accepted, but the shape-changing power of the Colessium's field {{was too much for}} the six exhausted and novice heroes, and so they failed. Turaga Dume then denounced them as imposter Toa and ordered the Vahki to arrest them. A vortex appeared {{in the middle of the}} field and Onewa, Nuju, and Whenua were sucked in. Nokama and Matau were able to anchor themselves by digging their tools into the ground, with the former also grabbing Vakama who then shot a series of disks at the base of a towering statue. It collapsed, crushing the advancing Vahki and deactivating the vortex. The three Toa then fled the Colessium and <b>escaped</b> into a <b>chute.</b> For info on the rest of the plot, see Legends of Metru Nui.|$|R
50|$|Eden can {{not hide}} her gasp, unknowingly drawing Ray's attention. As Ray looks in {{to inspect the}} bodies, he grabs Eden's foot, but Eric begins to groan to protect Eden. Ray then stabs Eric {{in the head with}} a screwdriver. Eden then fights Ray by setting him on fire and pushing him down a chute, but he drags her with him. She then uses a charm she got from CeCe that protects against evil. Ray submits, but the snakes {{possessing}} his body emerge to try to take the charm from her. Eden <b>escapes</b> up the <b>chute,</b> using the charm as a diversion. Eden then traps Ray and the snakes in the chute. As she tries to drive off in his tow truck, she hears an inhuman shriek, signaling Ray is back. Ray chases Eden out of the truck before she can do anything and she runs to hide in the bayou. She hides behind a bush close to Ray. He hears a rustling and hacks the bush, revealing she is not there. Just then the tow truck emerges through the underbrush and crushes Ray in half against a tree, killing him. Eden then staggers off into the trees, and the two snakes can be seen crawling out of Ray's decomposing torso to find another host.|$|R
