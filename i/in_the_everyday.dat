5|$|Broder Lysholm Knudtzon (5 October 178820 March 1864) was a Norwegian merchant, {{politician}} and benefactor. Born {{into one of}} Trondheim's wealthiest mercantile families, he travelled to England where he developed a great admiration of English language and literature. Despite his commercial background he was more drawn towards the fields of politics, culture and art. He nevertheless administrated his father's family firm, acting as foreign correspondent with little interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>everyday</b> business. In England he befriended Lord Byron and came {{under the influence of}} the English national liberal movement. Prior to his death, he bequeathed his entire library and several artworks to the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters.|$|E
5|$|Though Western {{classical}} and other musics {{play an important}} role in Anglican church services on Barbados, religion and folk music are closely intertwined <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>everyday</b> lives of most Barbadians. The basis for religious folk music is the Anglican hymn, a kind of praise song mostly sung on Sundays, a day when Christian Barbadians come together with family members to sing and praise God to ask for strength for the next week's work.|$|E
5|$|The axiomatization of mathematics, on {{the model}} of Euclid's Elements, had reached new levels of rigour and breadth {{at the end of the}} 19th century, {{particularly}} in arithmetic, thanks to the axiom schema of Richard Dedekind and Charles Sanders Peirce, and in geometry, thanks to Hilbert's axioms. But at the beginning of the 20th century, efforts to base mathematics on naive set theory suffered a setback due to Russell's paradox (on the set of all sets that do not belong to themselves). The problem of an adequate axiomatization of set theory was resolved implicitly about twenty years later by Ernst Zermelo and Abraham Fraenkel. Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory provided a series of principles that allowed for the construction of the sets used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>everyday</b> practice of mathematics, but they did not explicitly exclude the possibility of the existence of a set that belongs to itself. In his doctoral thesis of 1925, von Neumann demonstrated two techniques to exclude such sets—the axiom of foundation and the notion of class.|$|E

5|$|This failure, {{coupled with}} the {{disaster}} of the previous month, further soured {{the relations between the}} French and the Venetians. Cooperation was distinctly lacking in the few operations attempted during the next few weeks, while the bad supply situation, the spread of sickness among their troops and the continuous attrition of their forces <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>everyday</b> fighting at Candia made the French commanders especially keen to depart. The French contingent eventually departed on 20 August. Two Ottoman assaults on the 25th were repulsed, but to Morosini, {{it was clear that the}} city could no longer be held. After a council of war on 27 August, but without first consulting Venice, it was decided to capitulate. On 5 September 1669, the city was surrendered to the Ottomans, while the survivors of the garrison, the citizens and their treasures were evacuated. On his own initiative, Morosini concluded a permanent peace agreement with the Ottomans, which, under the circumstances, was relatively generous: Venice would retain the Aegean islands of Tinos and Kythera and the isolated island fortresses of Spinalonga, Gramvousa and Souda off the Cretan coast, as well as the gains made in Dalmatia.|$|E

25|$|Fantasies {{that are}} {{concerned}} with far-fetched ideas are usually dropped by the fantasizer. Sometimes fantasizing is retrospective: actual events are replayed from memory with great vividness. This form predominates when what is viewed as evidence of possible reciprocation can be re-experienced (a kind of selective or revisionist history). Otherwise, the long fantasy is anticipatory; it begins <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>everyday</b> world and climaxes at the attainment of the limerent goal.

She would sometimes enter the bar to buy cigarettes for her mother and leave to the sound of wolf-whistles. In the winter of 1962, the composers saw the girl pass by the bar.

25|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} from the early Norse settlement of the Faroe Islands c. 1200 years ago, {{in the form of}} pilot whale bones found in household remains in Gøta on Eysturoy, indicates that the pilot whale has long had a central place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>everyday</b> life of Faroe Islanders. Records of drive hunts in the Faroe Islands date back to 1584. The meat and blubber of the pilot whale have been {{an important part of the}} islanders’ staple diet. The islanders have particularly valued blubber: both as food and for processing into oil, which they used for lighting fuel and other purposes like medicine. The blubber of the bottlenose whale is not fit for food, as it gives diarrhea. In older days, it was used for medicinal purposes. People also used parts of the skin of pilot whales for ropes and lines, while utilising the stomachs as fishing floats.|$|E

25|$|Landscape Archaeology {{has been}} {{useful in the}} {{analysis}} of cultural identities that developed among social and racial groups. It has been argued that the existence and continued use of yard spaces among Black Americans (along with other African-derived practices observed in the Americas) is proof of a distinct, new world, cultural identity. One feature that appears to be widespread throughout the African diaspora is the significant importance of yard spaces <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>everyday</b> lives of African-Americans. Sidney W. Mintz, in describing the “house-and-yard pattern” among African-American peasants residing in the Caribbean, explains “…the house, particularly among poorer peasants, is not important in itself as a material representation (i.e. material culture/artifacts) of the domestic group or family”. Mintz further states that while the house “…is usually used mainly for sleeping and for storing clothing and other articles of personal value” the yard is where “…children play, the washing is done, the family relaxes, and friends are entertained”.|$|E
500|$|As {{part of her}} {{argument}} that women should not be overly influenced by their feelings, Wollstonecraft emphasises {{that they should not}} be constrained by or made slaves to their bodies or their sexual feelings. This particular argument has led many modern feminists to suggest that Wollstonecraft intentionally avoids granting women any sexual desire. Cora Kaplan argues that the [...] "negative and prescriptive assault on female sexuality" [...] is a [...] "leitmotif" [...] of the Rights of Woman. For example, Wollstonecraft advises her readers to [...] "calmly let passion subside into friendship" [...] in the ideal companionate marriage (that is, in the ideal of a love-based marriage that was developing at the time). It would be better, she writes, when [...] "two virtuous young people marry [...] [...] [...] if some circumstances checked their passion". According to Wollstonecraft, [...] "love and friendship cannot subsist in the same bosom". As Mary Poovey explains, [...] "Wollstonecraft betrays her fear that female desire might in fact court man's lascivious and degrading attentions, that the subordinate position women have been given might even be deserved. Until women can transcend their fleshly desires and fleshly forms, they will be hostage to the body." [...] If women are not interested in sexuality, they cannot be dominated by men. Wollstonecraft worries that women are consumed with [...] "romantic wavering", that is, they are interested only in satisfying their lusts. Because the Rights of Woman eliminates sexuality from a woman's life, Kaplan contends, it [...] "expresses a violent antagonism to the sexual" [...] {{while at the same time}} [...] "exaggerat the importance of the sensual <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>everyday</b> life of women". Wollstonecraft was so determined to wipe sexuality from her picture of the ideal woman that she ended up foregrounding it by insisting upon its absence. But as Kaplan and others have remarked, Wollstonecraft may have been forced to make this sacrifice: [...] "it is important to remember that the notion of woman as politically enabled and independent [...] fatally linked [...] to the unrestrained and vicious exercise of her sexuality." ...|$|E
