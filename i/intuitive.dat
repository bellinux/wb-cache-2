5|$|An <b>intuitive</b> {{feeling for}} the {{combinatorial}} superstructure of new theories.|$|E
5|$|Since {{forces are}} {{perceived}} as pushes or pulls, this can provide an <b>intuitive</b> understanding for describing forces. As with other physical concepts (e.g. temperature), the <b>intuitive</b> understanding of forces is quantified using precise operational definitions {{that are consistent with}} direct observations and compared to a standard measurement scale. Through experimentation, it is determined that laboratory measurements of forces are fully consistent with the conceptual definition of force offered by Newtonian mechanics.|$|E
5|$|A {{third variety}} of {{objection}} somewhat {{related to the}} problem of 'weakness of will' is that difficulties arise when we try to keep critical thinking separate from <b>intuitive</b> thinking.|$|E
5|$|The {{definition}} of the ampere is undergoing a major overhaul—the current definition, which is difficult to realise with high precision in practice, is being replaced by a definition that is more <b>intuitive</b> and that is easier to realise.|$|E
5|$|The golden ratio {{seems to}} be {{reflected}} in many Egyptian constructions, including the pyramids, but its use {{may have been an}} unintended consequence of the ancient Egyptian practice of combining the use of knotted ropes with an <b>intuitive</b> sense of proportion and harmony.|$|E
5|$|The <b>intuitive</b> {{notion that}} each natural number can be {{obtained}} by applying successor sufficiently often to zero requires an additional axiom, which is sometimes called the axiom of induction.|$|E
5|$|As a {{descriptive}} {{model of the}} two levels, Hare posited two extreme cases of people, one of whom would only use critical moral thinking and the other of whom would only use <b>intuitive</b> moral thinking. The former he called the 'archangel' and the latter the 'prole'. It {{is worth noting that}} it is not Hare's intention to divide up the entire human race into either archangels or proles; according to his theory each person shares the traits of both to limited and varying extents at different times. The archangel has superhuman powers of thought, superhuman knowledge and no weaknesses. This unbiased 'ideal observer', when presented with an unfamiliar situation, would be able to immediately scan all potential consequences of all possible actions in order to frame a universal principle from which he/she could decide an appropriate action for the situation. Such a person would not need a set of <b>intuitive</b> moral rules, as he/she would be able to decide the correct response to any possible situation by reason alone. By contrast, the prole has these human weaknesses to an extreme degree. He/she must rely upon intuitions and sound prima facie principles all of the time, as he is incapable of critical thought. The set of <b>intuitive</b> moral rules that the prole follows must be simple and general enough that they can be easily understood and memorised, and also quick and easy to use.|$|E
5|$|Born into {{a musical}} family, Smith taught herself {{to play the}} piano and later became a classically trained musician. Earning a {{teaching}} degree, she began publishing music compositions for children using the philosophy of Friedrich Fröbel, advocating for less memorization and drilling and more attention to <b>intuitive</b> appreciation of music. Studying composition and voice in Germany, she also toured the country observing choirs and their teaching techniques.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} {{towards the}} remaster was mostly positive. Several critics {{noted that some}} features like the inventory system and the insistence on having to revisit previously explored areas have not aged very well, but generally agreed that the remaster was a solid revival of a classic. The new control scheme was also considered more <b>intuitive</b> and satisfying, especially for new players.|$|E
5|$|Game {{designer}} Roberta Williams, {{co-founder of}} Sierra On-Line, deliberately made the Phantasmagoria gameplay and interface simple, unobtrusive, and <b>intuitive</b> {{so it would}} be more accessible and less frustrating for casual gamers. According to Arinn Dembo from Computer Gaming World, the game is focused more around the story and the frightening atmosphere, rather than on a difficult gaming experience, and therefore the puzzles are relatively easy, logical, and straightforward.|$|E
5|$|In retrospect, Newcomer commended Williams' {{management}} {{for taking a}} risk on him and the game. The game has garnered praise from industry professionals as well. Jeff Peters of GearWorks Games lauded the gameplay, describing it as unique and <b>intuitive.</b> Fusion Learning Systems' Jeff Johannigman praised the flapping mechanism and Kim Pallister of Microsoft enjoyed the multi-player aspect.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, O'Brien {{confirmed}} on February 18, 2009, that Weinberg and {{the band}} were indeed coming with him. Weinberg had not missed an E Street Band show since joining the outfit in 1974, and E Streeter Van Zandt said {{that no amount of}} rehearsal by another drummer could replace Weinberg's <b>intuitive</b> understanding of Springsteen's performance gambits.|$|E
5|$|Other {{psychologists have}} {{questioned}} the assumption that moral action is primarily a result of formal reasoning. Social intuitionists such as Jonathan Haidt, for example, argue that individuals often make moral judgments without weighing concerns such as fairness, law, human rights, or abstract ethical values. Thus the arguments analyzed by Kohlberg and other rationalist psychologists could be considered post hoc rationalizations of <b>intuitive</b> decisions; moral reasoning may be less relevant to moral action than Kohlberg's theory suggests.|$|E
5|$|The scheme {{presented}} in the table {{is known as the}} impedance analogy. Circuit diagrams produced using this analogy match the electrical impedance of the mechanical system seen by the electrical circuit, making it <b>intuitive</b> from an electrical engineering standpoint. There is also the mobility analogy, in which force corresponds to current and velocity corresponds to voltage. This has equally valid results but requires using the reciprocals of the electrical counterparts listed above. Hence, M → C, S → 1/L, D → G where G is electrical conductance, the inverse of resistance. Equivalent circuits produced by this scheme are similar, but are the dual impedance forms whereby series elements become parallel, capacitors become inductors, and so on. Circuit diagrams using the mobility analogy more closely match the mechanical arrangement of the circuit, making it more <b>intuitive</b> from a mechanical engineering standpoint. In addition to their application to electromechanical systems, these analogies are widely used to aid analysis in acoustics.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} the main Halo trilogy spurred the {{creation}} of spin-off games. Halo Wars is a real-time strategy game developed by Ensemble Studios for the Xbox 360. Set in the year 2531, the game takes place 21 {{years prior to the}} events of Halo: Combat Evolved. Much effort was spent on developing a control scheme that was simple and <b>intuitive,</b> unlike other console strategy games. The game was announced at X06, and released in February and March 2009.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} critiques {{of the theory}} from several perspectives. Arguments include that it {{emphasizes}} justice {{to the exclusion of}} other moral values, such as caring; that there is such an overlap between stages that they should more properly be regarded as separate domains; or that evaluations of the reasons for moral choices are mostly post hoc rationalizations (by both decision makers and psychologists studying them) of essentially <b>intuitive</b> decisions.|$|E
5|$|Upon release, Space Station Silicon Valley was {{acclaimed}} by many reviewers, with praise particularly {{directed at}} the <b>intuitive</b> mechanics, innovative level design, and comical concepts. It won numerous awards, including Game of the Month and Most Innovative Game from IGN. Despite this, the game performed poorly commercially, {{and was unable to}} secure enough sales to warrant a sequel.|$|E
5|$|Working with {{investment}} and venture capital firms, SRI and its former employees have launched more than 60 spin-off ventures {{in a wide}} range of fields, including Siri (acquired by Apple), Tempo AI (acquired by Salesforce.com), Redwood Robotics (acquired by Google), Desti (acquired by HERE), Grabit, Kasisto, Artificial Muscle, Inc. (acquired by Bayer MaterialScience), Nuance Communications, <b>Intuitive</b> Surgical, Ravenswood Solutions, and Orchid Cellmark.|$|E
5|$|At the 2011 Game Developers Conference, Chahi {{announced}} that an Apple iOS port {{of the title}} would be created by DotEmu and distributed by BulkyPix. On September 22, 2011, BulkyPix released a special 20th anniversary edition for the iPhone/iPad, featuring a switch between the original and HD graphics, a new <b>intuitive</b> touch controls or classic D-pad, three difficulty modes and remastered sound effects. The Android version was released in March 2012, the Steam version was released April 4, 2013 and GOG version was released April 22, 2013 (15th Anniversary Edition available on GOG in the same package as 20th Anniversary Edition).|$|E
5|$|Bunnies & Burrows has the {{advantage}} of offering players an <b>intuitive</b> grasp of relative dangers and appropriate actions not possible in game worlds that are substantially fictional. For example, a player is told their character is confronted with a fox. There is an immediate intuition on the amount of peril a rabbit is facing. Although player characters are substantially weaker than many of the dangers they face, the game {{is one of the first}} to encourage problem solving and outwitting obstacles, rather than out-fighting them.|$|E
5|$|In June 2010, the EyeTV HD {{product for}} {{recording}} high-definition {{cable and satellite}} programming was introduced. Because cable and satellite signals are encoded, the device must be connected to a tuner from a television provider. Then it provides remote controls, recording and DVR-functionality from a connected computer. A Macworld review gave the product {{four out of five}} stars. A review in Laptop Magazine gave EyeTV HD 3.5 out of 5 stars. It said the interface was <b>intuitive</b> and the video quality was good, but noted it was only compatible with Macs.|$|E
5|$|Rigmor Mydtskov (1925–2010) was a Danish court {{photographer}} who is remembered both for her portraits of artists performing in Danish theatres {{but also for}} her many portraits of Queen Margrethe {{and other members of}} the Danish royal family. Realizing that people in such positions tend to act as if masked, she sought to portray the person behind the mask, although she often succeeded in maintaining a little of the secrecy. As a portrait photographer, she was gentle, <b>intuitive</b> and confident. Her life's work is a result of a constant, concentrated effort.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{released}} for Microsoft Windows and OS X in September 2015, and later for Linux in July 2016, and PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita in August 2017. Upon release, {{the game was}} acclaimed for its writing, thematic material, <b>intuitive</b> combat system, musical score, and originality, with praise directed towards its story, dialogue, and characters. The game sold over a million copies, and was nominated for multiple accolades and awards, including Game of the Year from several gaming publications and conventions.|$|E
5|$|Utilitarian philosopher John Stuart Mill criticised Kant for {{not realizing}} that moral laws are {{justified}} by a moral intuition based on utilitarian principles (that the greatest good for the greatest number ought to be sought). Mill argued that Kant's ethics could not explain why certain actions are wrong without appealing to utilitarianism. As basis for morality, Mill believed that his principle of utility has a stronger <b>intuitive</b> grounding than Kant's reliance on reason, and can better explain why certain actions are right or wrong.|$|E
5|$|We {{really wanted}} to do {{something}} that just shows who I am. We weren't trying to make a better version of myself. It was really more about fun and being spontaneous. All of the mistakes were allowed to be there, which was the same for the song. The way that the song was recorded was very live. We played everything live, we didn't stop to edit ourselves, it was very <b>intuitive</b> and I wanted the video to have that energy, as well.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the game}}, the game {{includes}} an <b>intuitive,</b> interactive bowling control scheme and dynamic and <b>intuitive</b> batting, with greater coverage and shot choice than previous games. The game also features official Hawk-Eye visualisations during play.|$|E
25|$|The book {{argues that}} <b>intuitive</b> {{judgment}} is developed by experience, training, and knowledge. For example, Gladwell claims that prejudice can operate at an <b>intuitive</b> unconscious level, even in individuals whose conscious attitudes are not prejudiced. An example {{is in the}} halo effect, where a person having a salient positive quality {{is thought to be}} superior in other, unrelated respects. Gladwell uses the 1999 killing of Amadou Diallo, where four New York policemen shot an innocent man on his doorstep 41 times, as another example of how rapid, <b>intuitive</b> judgment can have disastrous effects.|$|E
