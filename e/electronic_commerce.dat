Advantages of such method of effecting transactions are defined, both in regard of tourism services providers and users; also, the change of role played by tourism services operators is established. A new strategical approach to generation of tourism product is described, this being more flexible and attractive for customer. A solution is suggested for establishment of a consultative system for tourists, this targeted at search for individual tourist trips and their booking. Development of such consultative system, related to requests for variable products subject to impact of various factors in the decision-making process, is a rather complicated simulation task.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of social media has significantly altered the strategies that companies use {{to communicate with}} customers (Lee, Xiong, & Hu, 2011). As social media moves from “buzz word” status to strategic tool, more practitioners are developing skills related to this online communication technology (Eyrich, Padman, & Sweetser, 2008). With the development of networks, especially <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce’s</b> appearance, consumers enter a new environment of trade, therefore, with {{the high degree of}} price dispersion in the online market, for example, customer information, search behaviour also changes (Guan & Cheng, 2009). In fact, with the rapid development of Web 2. 0 technologies, such as Ajax and XML, a great number of social networking sites (e. g., Facebook, Renren, MySpace, Kaixin, and LinkedIn) are emerging, which makes mass users interactions easier and more convenient (Yanli, Yi, & Yuli, 2010). These social media tools allow users to search, organize, share, annotate and contribute to contents in a collaborative way. For example, Curtis et al. (2010) found that social media techniques are becoming more abundant as public relations practitioners become mindful of their effectiveness in respect of reaching target audiences, promoting a specific cause, and further developing communication strategies. More than half of America’s teens and young adults send instant messages and use social networking sites, and more than one-third of all Internet users engage in these activities (Correa, Hinsley, & de Zúñiga, 2010) ...|$|R

We sought to contribute to the existing body of knowledge by examining psychologically experienced organizational distributive justice and climate as predictors of counterproductive workplace behavior, while exploring whether immediate job and exchange characteristics – employee occupational level and leader-member exchange – can clarify these associations. Two studies were conducted in different organizations respectively: (1) a governmental electricity company and (2) a private company specializing in <b>electronic</b> device <b>commerce.</b> The results supported the hypotheses and indicated negative relationships between perceived organizational distributive justice, overall and ethical climates, and CWB. Importantly, the quality of perceived leader-member exchange and employee's occupational level were found to moderate the relationship between perceived distributional justice and organizational ethical climate (respectively) and counterproductive work behavior...|$|R

40|$|A {{formalization}} of the watermarking {{problem is}} presented and basic algorithms for its generation and detection at several abstraction levels are proposed. The concepts of robustness against forgery and theft tracing are analyzed {{in light of}} the proposed algorithms. 1 Introduction Watermarking is a well-known technique traditionally used in banknotes and other documents to discourage counterfeiting. It usually consists of semi-transparent symbols embedded on paper. Recently, similar concepts have been applied to digital audio-visual Intellectual Properties (IPs) [1, 2, 3]. With the explosion of <b>electronic</b> IP <b>commerce,</b> the EDA industry will soon find itself in a similar situation as the record industry. Unlike the record industry however, electronic IPs will be simultaneously developed in several levels of abstraction.
