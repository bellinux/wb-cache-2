50|$|Individual cat5e {{and better}} rated 8P8C jacks (keystone and patch panel) with <b>IDC</b> <b>connectors</b> {{commonly}} {{use the same}} punchdown 'teeth' dimensions and tools as a full size 110 block.|$|R
5000|$|The {{main point}} of ribbon cables {{is to allow}} mass {{termination}} to specially designed <b>IDC</b> <b>connectors</b> in which the ribbon cable is forced onto a row of sharp forked contacts. (The phrase [...] "IDC connector" [...] is widely used, {{even though it is}} redundant—an example of RAS syndrome.) Most commonly termination is done {{at both ends of the}} cable, although sometimes (for example, when making a lead that needs to change wiring between the two connectors) only one end will be IDC terminated, with the other end being terminated in a regular crimp or solder-bucket connection. Although it is sometimes possible to dismantle and re-use <b>IDC</b> <b>connectors,</b> they are not designed to allow this to be done easily.|$|R
50|$|For all of {{the above}} connectors, the {{computer}} manufacturer typically attaches a female <b>IDC</b> <b>connector</b> onto one end of a ribbon cable, and later slides that connector onto a matching male box header or pin header on the computer motherboard.|$|E
50|$|The Open Graphics Project {{is another}} aim at {{creating}} an open hardware GPU. The Open Graphics Device v1 features dual DVI-I outputs and 100-pin <b>IDC</b> <b>connector.</b> In September 2010, the first 25 OGD1 boards were {{made available for}} grant application and purchase ($750).|$|E
50|$|A 110 {{block is}} a type of punch block used to {{terminate}} runs of on-premises wiring in a structured cabling system. The designation 110 is also used to describe a type of insulation displacement contact (<b>IDC)</b> <b>connector</b> used to terminate twisted pair cables, which uses a punch-down tool similar to the older 66 block.|$|E
50|$|Ribbon {{cable is}} {{designed}} to be used with multi-contact <b>IDC</b> <b>connectors</b> {{in such a way that}} many IDC connections can be made at once, saving time in applications where many connections are needed. These connectors are not designed to be reusable, but can often be re-used if care is taken when removing the cable.|$|R
50|$|To {{reduce the}} risk of {{reversed}} connections one edge of the cable is usually marked with a red stripe. By convention the edge with the stripe is connected to pin 1 on the connector. This method of identification is fine for cables that just consist of two or more <b>IDC</b> <b>connectors</b> with every connector connecting to every wire, but is somewhat less helpful when individual wires or small groups of wires must be terminated separately.|$|R

50|$|A balun's {{function}} is generally to achieve compatibility between systems, and as such, finds extensive application in modern communications, particularly in realising frequency conversion mixers to make cellular phone and data transmission networks possible. They {{are also used}} to convert an E1 carrier signal from coaxial cable (BNC connector,1.0/2.3 connector,1.6/5.6 connector,Type43 connectors) to UTP CAT-5 cable or <b>IDC</b> <b>connector.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The UEXT {{connector}} {{consists of}} 10 pins, in a two row by five male pin configuration, {{with a plastic}} keyed-shroud. All pins have a spacing of 0.1 inch (2.54 mm). [...] The socket is mated with a 2x5 (10-pin) IDC female connector, and typically connected to a Ribbon cable. The UEXT cable assembly {{is referred to as}} a 10-pin <b>IDC</b> <b>Connector</b> Ribbon Cable. These cables are readily available and cheap.|$|E
40|$|The debug {{connectors}} for Cortex microcontrollers will be {{migrating to}} new debug connectors. Currently the KEIL ULINK 2 already supports {{one of the}} new debug connector arrangements and the coming ULINK-Pro supports both new debug connector arrangements. A number of Cortex microcontroller evaluation boards from KEIL already support the new connectors. This document covers the basic information of these debug connectors. This is for general information only and should not be used as a specification. The details covered in this document are taken from various ARM and KEIL documents / web sites. Additional details are covered in specifications documents listed in the Reference section. Why change? Most existing ARM products use a 20 -pin <b>IDC</b> <b>connector</b> for JTAG debug, and 38 -pin Mictor connectors for trace. However, {{there are a number of}} issues with the existing arrangement:- 20 -pin IDC connectors are too big for today’s microcontroller boards. - 20 -pin IDC connectors do not support trace. - The 0. 05 ” micro header in the new connector arrangement has a lower cost for trace. Since the Cortex-M 3 trace port only requires 5 signals (4 bit data and trace clock), the trace signals can easily be merged into a 20 -pin debug connector. For microcontroller products that do not require trace (e. g. Cortex-M 0 or Cortex-M 3 without trace), an even smaller connector can be used. The new connectors are called...|$|E

50|$|Early {{residential}} telephone systems used simple {{screw terminals}} to join cables to sockets {{in a tree}} topology. These screw-terminal blocks have been slowly replaced by 110 blocks and connectors. Modern homes usually have phone service entering the house to a single 110 block, whence it is distributed by on-premises wiring to outlet boxes throughout the home in star topology. At the outlet box, cables are punched down <b>IDC</b> type <b>connectors,</b> which fit in special faceplates.|$|R
5000|$|Pin headers with {{a plastic}} guide box around them are known as box headers (BH) or {{shrouded}} headers and are normally only used in combination with insulation-displacement <b>connectors</b> (<b>IDC)</b> for ribbon cables. A notch (key) in the guide box normally prevents placing the connector (polarised by a [...] "bump" [...] on one side) the wrong way around.|$|R
50|$|In {{recent years}} NTE5 sockets {{have been fitted}} in place of master sockets. These have a front plate where the lower half is {{removable}} so allowing customer's access to the terminals required for connecting internal extension sockets; it also provides access to a test jack, to determine if line faults are due to the customer's wiring or BT's. The removable panel also allows the external telephone line to be easily disconnected from the internal wiring, provided the wiring of the premises has been correctly carried out. The terminals on the back part used to be large screw terminals; however, all BT NTE5 sockets now use insulation-displacement <b>connectors</b> (<b>IDCs).</b>|$|R
50|$|The early flat ribbon cables {{were used}} in the mainframe-computer industry, on card readers, card-punching machines, and tape machines. Subsequently, ribbon cables were {{manufactured}} by a number of different companies, including 3M. Methods and materials were developed to simplify and reduce the cost of ribbon cables, by standardizing the design and spacing of the wires, and the thickness of the insulation, so that they could be easily terminated through the use of insulation-displacement <b>connectors</b> (<b>IDC).</b> Due to the simplicity of ribbon cables, their low profile, and low cost due to standardization, ribbon cables are used today in most computers, printers, and many electronic devices.|$|R
5000|$|As {{previously}} mentioned the actual connections are made using Insulation-displacement <b>connectors</b> (<b>IDC).</b> A punch down tool {{is required to}} do this and two sorts are available. One is of plastic construction and only intended for occasional use. The other is a professional tool used by installers, which is a spring loaded push down tool that both inserts the wire and trims it in one action : an example is shown in the photograph. It also comes with a tool for removing wires from sockets. From Q3 2016, Openreach started using a new, [...] "tooless" [...] version of the demarcation socket - the NTE5C - which does not require an IDC tool to make the connections.|$|R
40|$|Caspase- 7 is {{a member}} of a family of {{cysteine}} proteases that includes apoptotic initiators (caspases- 8, - 9 and - 10) and executors (caspases- 3, - 6 and - 7). During apoptosis, executioner caspases are cleaved by initiator caspases either by the extrinsic (death receptors) or by the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway of caspase activation. Caspase- 7 is an obligate dimer in the cell and cleavage of the interdomain <b>connector</b> (<b>IDC),</b> which split the catalytic domain in two subunits, at either site 1 or site 2 allows the conversion of the enzyme from the zymogen (inactive) state to the active state through a conformation switch that leads {{to the creation of a}} substrate binding pocket and the catalytic site. During caspase- 7 activation, a 23 -residue N-terminal peptide is also cleaved. Consequently, caspase- 7 displays different N-terminal residues from those of its zymogen. This can change the stability of caspase- 7 according to the N-end rule, which relates the half-life of a protein with the residue presented at its N-terminus. This degradation pathway controls the ubiquitination of the protein based on the N-terminus. To replicate the different forms of caspase- 7 produced during its activation process in a controlled manner, a TEV protease cleavage site [ENLYFQ[arrow down](S/A) ] was strategically inserted to mimic the different possibilities of IDC cleavage: 1) cleavage at site 1 only, 2) cleavage at site 2 only, or 3) a double cleavage. This was done in order to obtain the N-terminal residues normally presented during the cleavage of caspase- 7. These constructions have been also optimized to preserve the proteolytic activity of the enzyme with as little change as possible to the length of the IDC. These constructs were cleaved by TEV protease in vitro and in cellulo and allowed the activation of apoptosis. Furthermore, the cellular half-life of caspase- 7 seems to be changed by its cleavage. In conclusion, we have developed an interesting tool for the study of caspase- 7...|$|R
