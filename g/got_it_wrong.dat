25|$|As prime minister, David Cameron {{wanted to}} put family policy {{at the heart of}} the Conservative Party {{claiming}} British politics in the past had <b>got</b> <b>it</b> <b>wrong.</b> He stated families should be the most important thing in the country's life, believing social responsibility and a strong family was key to an individuals success, and by extent becoming less reliant on the state. Both Cameron and Theresa May have aimed at helping families achieve a work-home balance and have previously proposed to offer all parents 12 months parental leave, to be shared by mother and father as they choose. Other policies have included doubling the free hours of childcare for working parents of three and four-year-olds from 15 hours to 30 hours a week during term-time, and fund 15 hours a week of free childcare for all disadvantaged two-year-olds, worth £2,500 a year per child. Tax schemes to support families, freezing fuel duty, cutting income tax. David Cameron in a speech mentioned businesses will have to help cut the costs imposed on society and families through the decisions businesses make, by becoming more socially responsible which would in turn reduce the need for state control to solve the problem.|$|E
500|$|Axis {{featured}} psychedelic cover {{art that}} depicts Hendrix and the Experience as various avatars of Vishnu, incorporating {{a painting of}} them by Roger Law, from a photo-portrait by Karl Ferris. The painting was then superimposed on {{a copy of a}} mass-produced religious poster. Hendrix stated that the cover, which Track spent $5,000 producing, would have been more appropriate had it highlighted his American Indian heritage. He commented: [...] "You <b>got</b> <b>it</b> <b>wrong...</b> I'm not that kind of Indian." [...] Track released the album in the UK on December 1, 1967, where it peaked at number five, spending 16 weeks on the charts. In February 1968, Axis: Bold as Love reached number three in the U.S.|$|E

500|$|Contemporaneous {{reviews of}} Be Here Now were, in John Harris's words, {{unanimous}} with [...] "truly amazing praise." [...] According to Harris, [...] "To find an album that had attracted gushing notices in such profusion, {{one had to}} go back thirty years, to the release of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band." [...] While Q magazine described the album as [...] "cocaine set to music", most early reviews praised the record's length, volume and ambition. Reviews in the British music press for Oasis' previous album (What's the Story) Morning Glory? had been generally negative. When it went on to become, in the words of Select editor Alexis Petridis, [...] "this huge kind of Zeitgeist defining record" [...] the music press was [...] "baffled". Realising they had <b>got</b> <b>it</b> <b>wrong</b> the last time, Petridis believes the initial glowing reviews were a concession to public opinion.|$|E
500|$|Shearer {{said in an}} {{interview}} that [...] "The animating impulse was to do rock 'n' roll right. The four of us had been around rock 'n' roll and we were just amazed by how relentlessly the movies <b>got</b> <b>it</b> <b>wrong.</b> Because we were funny people it was going to be a funny film, but we wanted to get it right." [...] When they tried to sell it to various Hollywood studios, they were told that the film would not work. The group kept saying, [...] "No, this is a story that's pretty familiar to people. We're not introducing them to anything they don't really know," [...] so Shearer thought it would at least have some resonance with the public. The film was only a modest success upon its initial release but found greater success, and a cult following, after its video release. In 2000, the film was ranked 29th on the American Film Institute's list of the top 100 comedy movies in American cinema and it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being [...] "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".|$|E
500|$|Grönholm was {{disappointed}} with his race, admitting {{that he thought}} {{he might be able to}} beat Sordo, if not Loeb. But after having gearbox and tyre problems on , he settled into third place and stayed in that position to the rally's conclusion. [...] "We <b>got</b> <b>it</b> <b>wrong</b> on the tyre choice, which we had to have approved by the FIA early in the week," [...] he explained. [...] "We thought it would rain. Harder tyres would have made life easier for us." [...] BP-Ford was also unhappy. Christian Loriaux, the team's Technical Director said, [...] "Having Marcus finish behind Sordo is disappointing. Being behind Loeb is easier to understand, because I didn't expect the C4 to be any slower than the Xsara, and that car had a performance edge over us last year." [...] Petter Solberg also had issues with his tyres throughout the rally. After Subaru switched to es from Pirelli following the 2006 season, and with the shortest break between seasons the WRC had seen, the crews had not had enough time to test the new compounds. The Subarus had had their problems with the Pirellis, too. To protect them from breaking up too quickly the drivers had learned how to look after them, but driving that way on the new brand meant that he could not get the BFs up to temperature and ended up running slower. He finished the rally in sixth place. His teammate Atkinson did not have that problem though, and after fighting with Hirvonen in the final half of the rally, finished in fourth place. [...] "It's been a massive battle, and so much fun to be in a battle with these guys again," [...] he said after being congratulated by Hirvonen. Two drivers in non-manufacturer cars, Gardemeister and Kopecký, finished in seventh and eighth place to receive drivers points.|$|E

6000|$|He {{satisfied}} the impassioned demand of his nature for incessant activities {{of every kind}} by taking a personal {{as well as a}} pecuniary interest in the inventions of others. At one moment [...] "the damned human race" [...] was almost to be redeemed by a process of founding brass without air bubbles in it; if this could once be accomplished, as I understood, or misunderstood, brass could be used in art-printing to a degree hitherto impossible. I dare say I have <b>got</b> <b>it</b> <b>wrong,</b> but I am not mistaken as to Clemens's enthusiasm for the process, and his heavy losses in paying its way to ultimate failure. He was simultaneously absorbed in the perfection of a type-setting machine, which he was paying the inventor a salary to bring to a perfection so expensive that it was practically impracticable. We were both printers by trade, and I could take the same interest in this wonderful piece of mechanism that he could; and it was so truly wonderful that it did everything but walk and talk. Its ingenious creator was so bent upon realizing the highest ideal in it that he produced a machine of quite unimpeachable efficiency. But it was so costly, when finished, that it could not be made for less than twenty thousand dollars, if the parts were made by hand. This sum was prohibitive of its introduction, unless the requisite capital could be found for making the parts by machinery, and Clemens spent many months in vainly trying to get this money together. In the mean time simpler machines had been invented and the market filled, and his investment of three hundred thousand dollars in the beautiful miracle remained permanent but not profitable. I once went with him to witness its performance, and it did seem to me the last word in its way, but it had been spoken too exquisitely, too fastidiously. I never heard him devote the inventor to the infernal gods, as he was apt to do with the geniuses he lost money by, and so I think he did not regard him as a traitor.|$|E
