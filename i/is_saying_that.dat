25|$|The many-worlds {{interpretation}} is very vague {{about the ways}} to determine when splitting happens, and nowadays usually the criterion {{is that the two}} branches have decohered. However, present day understanding of decoherence does not allow a completely precise, self-contained way to say when the two branches have decohered/"do not interact", and hence many-worlds interpretation remains arbitrary. This objection <b>is</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> {{it is not clear what}} is precisely meant by branching, and point to the lack of self-contained criteria specifying branching.|$|E
25|$|The monads for {{collections}} naturally represent nondeterministic computation. The list (or other collection) represents all {{the possible}} results from different nondeterministic paths of computation at that given time. For example, when one executes x <- , one <b>is</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> the variable x can non-deterministically take {{on any of the}} values of that list. If one were to return x, it would evaluate to a list of the results from each path of computation. Notice that the bind operator above follows this theme by performing f on each of the current possible results, and then it concatenates the result lists together.|$|E
500|$|When Luke is {{watching}} the sunset, he breaks the fourth wall by introducing Star Wars composer John Williams and the London Symphony Orchestra, who have been scoring the scene, in a parody of a scene from Blazing Saddles featuring Count Basie and his orchestra. Luke then asks the orchestra to play the theme of The People's Court. Later in the episode when Luke finds his uncle and aunt murdered, he also finds that Williams and the entire orchestra have been killed as well; this saddens Luke, since the episode will now have to be scored by composer Danny Elfman. While searching for R2-D2, Luke listens to conservative political commentator Rush Limbaugh's radio show , in which Limbaugh says that the [...] "liberal galactic media <b>is</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> the planet Hoth is melting".|$|E

We will be assembling a blue-ribbon panel to look at the issue. We're looking at reactors that have a high-energy neutron spectrum that can actually allow you to burn down the long-lived actinide waste. These are fast-neutron reactors. There's others: a resurgence of hybrid solutions of fusion fission where the fusion would impart not only energy, but again creates high-energy neutrons that can burn down the long-lived actinides. ...|$|E

"With {{respect to}} the {{constitutional}} challenges raised by Flipside," [...] Atkins wrote, [...] "the Court has adopted a sliding-scale standard of permissibility which is measured against the conduct or activity addressed by the statute under challenge.

2500|$|Shakespeare {{uses the}} portentous polysyllabic verb Prognosticate with the alliteration 'doom and date' {{which is the}} stock in the trade of astrologers. [...] This is [...] Shakespeare's prognostication, and it is {{delivered}} with a smile. West believed this due to the emphasis against the metre on 'this'.

2500|$|The speaker {{seems to}} personify {{nature in the}} first quatrain in saying: [...] "Nature's bequest gives nothing, but doth lend, / And being frank, she lends to those are free" [...] (lines 3–4). The speaker <b>is</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> nature gives gifts at birth, and calls on people, giving {{something}} inhuman human-like characteristics. Several words in the sonnet; such as [...] "bequest", [...] "usurer" [...] and [...] "sum"; also make explicit the accounting motif of the prior sonnets.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{the system}} is a 2 DOF system, there are two modes with their {{respective}} natural frequencies and shapes. [...] The mode shape vectors are not the absolute motion, but just describe relative motion of the degrees of freedom. [...] In our case the first mode shape vector <b>is</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> the masses are moving together in phase since {{they have the same}} value and sign. [...] In the case of the second mode shape vector, each mass is moving in opposite direction at the same rate.|$|E
2500|$|An exaggeration {{occurs when}} the most {{fundamental}} aspects of a statement are true, but only to a certain degree. It is also seen as [...] "stretching the truth" [...] or making something appear more powerful, meaningful, or real than it actually <b>is.</b> <b>Saying</b> <b>that</b> someone devoured most of something when they only ate half would be considered an exaggeration. An exaggeration might be easily {{found to be a}} hyperbole where a person's statement (i.e. in informal speech, such as [...] "He did this like one million times already!") is meant not to be understood literally.|$|E

He <b>is</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> he will never allow {{the formation of a}} government containing Leftists and Communists. People are amazed by what has happened." [...] The opposition parties quickly announced their intention of bringing down the new government in a motion of rejection.|$|E
2500|$|In An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, Hume {{wrote that}} the design {{argument}} seems to depend upon our experience, and its proponents [...] "always suppose the universe, an effect quite singular and unparalleled, to be the proof of a Deity, a cause no less singular and unparalleled". Philosopher Louise E. Loeb notes that Hume <b>is</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> only experience and observation can be our guide to making inferences about the conjunction between events. However, according to Hume, [...] "we observe neither God nor other universes, and hence no conjunction involving them. There is no observed conjunction to ground an inference either to extended objects or to God, as unobserved causes." ...|$|E

2500|$|The couplet sums {{up with a}} {{potential}} answer {{to all of the}} questions that the author was posing throughout the entire sonnet. He says, [...] "thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee" [...] in the first line of the couplet. This is suggesting that the young man has valuable attraction that is not being used properly or appreciated. It seems as if the speaker is insinuating that the beauty will die with the young man. The last line of the couplet says, [...] "which usèd, lives th'executor to be." [...] Here {{it seems as if the}} speaker <b>is</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> if the young man uses his beauty, then it will prolong his life. The word [...] "executor" [...] hints at both death and accounting.|$|E
2500|$|The {{structure}} of the poem forms an interesting and logical argument and progression. [...] In the first stanza he is saying you're too good for me, so I understand {{if you want to}} get rid of me. [...] In the second stanza he <b>is</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> I am nowhere close to good enough for you, but maybe you are not aware of it. [...] And in the third stanza he is saying you are too good for me, but maybe you didn't realize that before. [...] In the closing couplet, Shakespeare confesses that no matter what the cause of misjudgment, you're released by the mistake, and [...] "I'm left here to remember our time together" [...] when I felt like nobility.|$|E
2500|$|This idea {{of nature}} is also {{reflected}} in Philip C. Kolin's analysis of {{the last part of}} the poem as well. [...] Kolin's observation of Shakespeare's discussion of the man being for [...] "women's pleasure" [...] does not lend itself to this idea of bisexuality or gender-bending at all. Kolin <b>is</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> nature made him for [...] "women's pleasure" [...] and that is what is [...] "natural". [...] Kolin goes on to say that the phrase [...] "to my purpose nothing" [...] also reflects this natural aspect of being created for women's pleasure. In this, however, he takes no account of Shakespeare's common pun of [...] "nothing" [...] ("O") to mean vagina. [...] Whereas Stackhouse would argue the poem is almost gender neutral, Kolin would argue that the poem is [...] "playful" [...] and [...] "sexually (dualistic)".|$|E
