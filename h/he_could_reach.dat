5|$|Against Arkansas, Cody {{dominated}} Razorbacks center Jonathan Luigs—the 2007 Rimington Trophy winner—and {{helped the}} Crimson Tide to a 49–14 win. In a memorable {{play on a}} fourth-and-goal from the 1-yard line {{late in the first}} half, Cody blasted past Luigs and left guard Wade Grayson to grab running back Michael Smith before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>reach</b> the end zone. In Alabama's rout over Georgia at Sanford Stadium, Cody was instrumental in holding Doak Walker award candidate Knowshon Moreno to just 34 yards rushing. In the seventh game of the season against Ole Miss, he received a knee injury during the third quarter which sidelined him for two weeks.|$|E
5|$|As {{the siege}} continued, {{supplies}} once again {{began to run}} out for the defending army, and Parliament identified the relief of Taunton as being a priority. On 28 April, they ordered Thomas Fairfax, the Commander in Chief of the recently established New Model Army, to relieve the town. Fairfax marched with the whole of his army towards Taunton; the Royalists considered sending their own army to meet him before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>reach</b> London, but Prince Rupert convinced them instead to focus on conquering the north of England. In response to the Royalist movement north, Fairfax split his own army in two, sending a force of between 6,000 and 7,000 on to Taunton under Colonel Ralph Weldon, while Fairfax led the rest north.|$|E

5|$|Caracalla's aunt Julia Maesa took {{advantage}} of the unrest and instigated a rebellion to have her fourteen-year-old grandson, Elagabalus, recognized as emperor. Macrinus was overthrown at the Battle of Antioch on 8 June 218 and Elagabalus proclaimed himself emperor with support from the rebelling Roman legions. Macrinus fled the battlefield and tried to reach Rome but was captured in Chaceldon and later executed in Cappadocia. He sent his son to the care of Artabanus V of Parthia, but Diadumenianus was also captured before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>reach</b> his destination and executed. After Macrinus' death, the Senate declared him and his son enemies of Rome and had their names struck from the records and their images destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Milan kicked-off {{the second}} half. Two {{minutes into the}} half, Liverpool had the first attack but Nesta tackled Gerrard before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>reach</b> Kuyt's pass. Jankulovski {{received}} a yellow card in the 54th minute when he brought Pennant down. Immediately afterwards, Milan had an attack. Pirlo received the ball from a header by Clarence Seedorf, Pirlo played a high pass to Kaká who was ruled to be offside by the assistant referee, despite being behind the defence when the ball was played. Milan had another attack straight after the offside, but Liverpool defender Daniel Agger tackled Inzaghi before he could shoot. Liverpool had their first yellow card in the 59th minute when Javier Mascherano received one for bringing down Pirlo. After the yellow card, Liverpool decided to replace Boudewijn Zenden with Harry Kewell. Liverpool's best goalscoring chance of the match occurred minutes later. Gerrard capitalised on an error by Gattuso to be one-on-one with Dida, but his shot did not possess enough power to beat the Milan goalkeeper.|$|E
5|$|Takin died in March 933, {{and his son}} and {{nominated}} successor, Muhammad, {{failed to}} establish his authority in Egypt. Ibn Tughj was named as the new governor in August but the appointment was revoked a month later before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>reach</b> Egypt, and Ahmad ibn Kayghalagh was appointed in his place. The timing of Ibn Tughj's recall coincides with the arrest (and subsequent murder) of Mu'nis by Caliph al-Qahir (r. 932–934) on 22 September, suggesting that Ibn Tughj's nomination was in all likelihood also due to Mu'nis. The fact that al-Qahir sent a eunuch called Bushri to replace Ibn Tughj in Damascus {{after the fall of}} Mu'nis reinforces this view. Bushri was able to take over the governorship of Aleppo (to which he also had been appointed), but Ibn Tughj resisted his replacement, and defeated and took him prisoner. The caliph then charged Ahmad ibn Kayghalagh with forcing Ibn Tughj to surrender, but although Ahmad marched against Ibn Tughj, both avoided a direct confrontation. Instead, the two men met and reached an agreement of mutual support, upholding the status quo.|$|E

5|$|On 1 July, Willaumez sailed again, attacking {{shipping}} at Montserrat, Nevis and St. Kitts before sailing to Tortola {{in preparation}} for {{an attack on the}} Jamaica convoy. Before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>reach</b> the convoy, Willaumez was intercepted off the Passage Islands by a squadron under Rear-Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane and driven northwards into the Bahamas. There he waited for the Jamaica convoy to pass, seizing any ship of any nationality that came within sight, in case they should reveal his position. After several weeks of waiting, Captain Bonaparte, the Emperor's brother and commander of the ship Vétéran, decided that he would no longer submit to Willaumez's command and sailed north during the night of 31 July, without orders or even notifying the admiral. Vétéran eventually returned to France on 26 August, after destroying six ships from a Quebec convoy. Panicked by the unexplained disappearance of one of his ships and its illustrious captain, Willaumez struck north in search of the vessel and as a result missed the passage of the Jamaica convoy, also narrowly avoiding an encounter with the squadrons under Warren and Strachan. On 18 August a hurricane dispersed his ships, severely damaging them and scattering them along the Atlantic Seaboard of the Americas. One was destroyed by a British patrol, two others were too badly damaged to be repaired and were broken up, and three of his ships successfully made the journey back to France over the next two years.|$|E
5|$|Uttanka then {{wondered}} whether <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>reach</b> his guru Veda's ashram {{to hand over}} the earrings to the guru's wife before the prescribed time. The rider, noting Uttanka's concern, gave Uttanka his horse, which took Uttanka to the ashram. He reached the ashram just before sunset as the guru's wife {{was in the process of}} casting a curse on Uttanka for not arriving in time. When Uttanka narrated his experience in procuring the earrings, the guru and his wife blessed him. Veda then explained to Uttanka the significance of the sights he had seen in Nagaloka. The two women engaged in weaving were Dhata and Vidhata; they were creating the world and all its creatures. The threads were day and night. The wheel with twelve spokes was the year with 360 days. The six boys were the seasons. The giant and bullock were Indra and his elephant Airavata. Its dung was amrita (elixir of life), which kept Uttanka alive in Nagaloka. The rider and horse in Nagaloka were Indra and the fire-god Agni. Veda also explained to Uttanka that his friend, Indra, had helped him during his journey.|$|E

25|$|There are two {{versions}} of the dichotomy paradox. In the other version, before Homer could reach the end of the path, he must reach half of the distance to it. Before reaching the last half, he must complete the next quarter of the distance. Reaching the next quarter, he must then cover the next eighth of the distance, then the next sixteenth, and so on. There are thus an infinite number of steps that must first be accomplished before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>reach</b> the end of the path. Expressed this way, the dichotomy paradox is very much analogous to that of Achilles and the tortoise.|$|E
