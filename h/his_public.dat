5|$|As {{the leader}} of the Melkite church in Egypt Zoghby was a vocal proponent of rights for Christians, and opposed the {{limitations}} placed on them by that country's Law of Personal Statutes.

5|$|As the war {{had ended}} with the 1783 Treaty of Paris, and the United States, {{operating}} under the Articles of Confederation, resisted any significant action with respect to Vermont, Allen's historic role as an agitator became less important, and <b>his</b> <b>public</b> role in Vermont's affairs declined.

The episode gave him a lasting heroic status among the poissardes and {{burnished}} {{his reputation as a}} patron of the poor.

5|$|Marking Specter's {{entire career}} in the Senate and, indeed, in all <b>his</b> <b>public</b> offices was one {{overriding}} fact: First and foremost, he considered himself essentially a trial attorney rather than a professional politician.
