25|$|Great Himalayan National Park: This park {{is located}} in Himachal Pradesh and ranges in {{altitude}} from 5,000 to 17,500 feet. Wildlife resident here includes the snow leopard, the <b>Himalayan</b> <b>brown</b> <b>bear</b> and the musk deer.|$|E
25|$|The {{valley is}} {{blessed with the}} good {{population}} of snow leopards, ibex, <b>Himalayan</b> <b>Brown</b> <b>Bear,</b> Musk Deer, Himalayan Blue Sheep etc. which serves as the boon for the wildlife lovers. There are two important protected areas {{in the region that}} are a home to snow leopard and its prey including the Pin Valley National Park and Kibber Wildlife Sanctuary. Surprisingly, due to ardent religious beliefs, people of Spiti do not hunt these wild animals.|$|E
25|$|There {{are around}} 500 {{varieties}} of mammals, 2000 species of birds, 30,000 types of insects {{and a wide}} variety of fish, amphibians and reptiles in the region. Animal species in North India include elephant, tiger, leopard, snow leopard, sambar (Asiatic stag), chital (spotted deer), hangul (red deer), hog deer, chinkara (Indian gazelle), blackbuck, nilgai (blue bull antelope), porcupine, wild boar, Indian fox, Tibetan sand fox, rhesus monkey, langur, jungle cat, hyena, jackal, black bear, <b>Himalayan</b> <b>brown</b> <b>bear,</b> sloth bear, and the endangered caracal.|$|E
50|$|Evidence of {{wildlife}} {{can be seen}} throughout the trek. The Ibex and the Markhor Mountain Goat can be found and the area is famous for <b>Himalayan</b> <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> and snow leopards, although sightings are rare.|$|R
50|$|<b>Himalayan</b> <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> are omnivores {{and will}} eat grasses, roots {{and other plants}} as well as insects and small mammals; they also like fruits and berries. They will also prey on large mammals, {{including}} sheep and goats. Adults will eat before sunrise and later during the afternoon.|$|R
50|$|Balkasar Bear Sanctuary, {{established}} in 2010 by Fakhar Abbas of WSPA (now known as World Animal Protection), is an animal sanctuary located in Balkassar, Chakwal District, Punjab, Pakistan. The sanctuary provides a retirement and rehabilitation home, and veterinary care for rescued bears from bear-baiting events. It houses {{the endangered species}} of Asian black <b>bears</b> and <b>Himalayan</b> <b>brown</b> <b>bears.</b> Balkasar Bear Sanctuary also has ornithology and herpetalogy research stations.|$|R

50|$|<b>Himalayan</b> <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> exhibit sexual dimorphism. Males {{range from}} 1.5m up to 2.2m (5 ft - 7 ft 3in) long, while females are 1.37m to 1.83m (4 ft 6 in - 6 ft) long. They {{are the largest}} animals in the Himalayas and are usually sandy or reddish-brown in colour.|$|R
50|$|Kund Park (also {{known as}} Kund Bear Park), {{established}} in 2000, is an animal theme park located in Nowshera, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. The park is a conservation center and sanctuary for Asian black <b>bears</b> and <b>Himalayan</b> <b>brown</b> <b>bears.</b> It also houses leopards {{as well as}} various species of cranes, deer, ducks, parrots, peafowls and pheasants.|$|R
25|$|The Asian black bear's range {{overlaps}} {{with that of}} sloth bears in central and southern India, sun bears in Southeast Asia and <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> {{in the southern part}} of the Russian Far East. Ussuri <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> may attack black <b>bears,</b> though <b>Himalayan</b> <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> seem to be intimidated by the black species in direct encounters. They will eat the fruit dropped by black bears from trees, as they themselves are too large and cumbersome to climb.|$|R

50|$|Threatened species {{include the}} snow leopard, Indian leopard, <b>Himalayan</b> <b>brown</b> <b>bear,</b> Indian wolf, Kashmir gray langur, rhesus macaque, markhor, Siberian ibex, white-bellied musk deer and Kashmir red deer.Bird species present are cheer pheasant, {{peregrine}} falcon and western tragopan.|$|E
50|$|In {{his years}} at Oxford, Aspinall had loved the book Nada the Lily by H. Rider Haggard, about an illegitimate Zulu prince who lived outside his tribe among wild animals. In 1956, Aspinall moved into an Eaton Place {{apartment}} {{with his first}} wife. In the back garden, Aspinall built a garden shed housing a capuchin monkey, a 9-week-old tiger, and two <b>Himalayan</b> <b>brown</b> <b>bears.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{samples were}} {{subsequently}} re-analysed by Ceiridwen Edwards and Ross Barnett. They {{concluded that the}} mutation that had led to the match with a polar bear was a damage artefact, and suggested that the two hair samples were in fact from <b>Himalayan</b> <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> (U. arctos isabellinus). These bears are known in Nepal as Dzu-the (a Nepalese term meaning cattle-bear), and {{have been associated with}} the myth of the yeti. Sykes and Melton acknowledged that their GenBank search was in error and but suggested that the hairs were instead a match to a modern polar bear specimen [...] "from the Diomede Islands in the Bering Sea reported in the same paper”. They maintained that they did not see any sign of damage in their sequences and commented that they had “no reason to doubt the accuracy of these two sequences any more than the other 28 presented in the paper”. [...] Multiple further analyses, including replication of the single analysis conducted by Sykes and his team, were carried out in a study conducted by Eliécer E. Gutiérrez, a researcher at the Smithsonian Institution and Ronald H. Pine, affiliated at the University of Kansas. All of these analyses found that the relevant genetic variation in <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> makes it impossible to assign, with certainty, the Himalayan samples to either that species or to the polar <b>bear.</b> Because <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> occur in the Himalayas, Gutiérrez and Pine stated that {{there is no reason to}} believe that the samples in question came from anything other than ordinary <b>Himalayan</b> <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> ...|$|R
50|$|In January 2011, {{two female}} <b>Himalayan</b> <b>brown</b> <b>bears,</b> Bhoori and Leela, {{and a female}} Asian black bear, Kaali, were rescued from a village in Layyah District. WSPA {{reported}} that the owners had accepted the alternative livelihood package. Once Bhoori, Leela and Kaali got to the sanctuary, they received necessary medical care. In September 2011, three Asian black bears were rescued from Muzaffargarh and brought to Balkasar Bear Sanctuary. The males, Sawan and Azad, died while in medical care. Post-mortem analysis showed that the former died because of heart failure while latter died due to liver failure. The only female, Nita, survived her fellows and was released into her enclosure after treatment. In October 2011, three more female Asian black bears, Lala, Milla and Shama, were rescued and brought to the quarantine zone of the sanctuary, where they received treatment.|$|R
50|$|Rare {{species are}} species with small populations. Many {{move into the}} {{endangered}} or vulnerable category if the negative factors affecting them continue to operate. Examples of rare species are the <b>Himalayan</b> <b>brown</b> <b>bear,</b> desert fox, wild Asiatic buffalo and hornbill.|$|E
50|$|The {{misidentification}} of Himalayan wildlife {{has been}} proposed as an explanation for some Yeti sightings, including the chu-teh, a langur monkey living at lower altitudes; the Tibetan blue bear; or the <b>Himalayan</b> <b>brown</b> <b>bear</b> or dzu-teh, {{also known as the}} Himalayan red bear.|$|E
50|$|In the 2016 adaptation, Baloo is stated to be a {{sloth bear}} by Bagheera, though his {{appearance}} {{is similar to}} that of a <b>Himalayan</b> <b>brown</b> <b>bear.</b> Though this subspecies of the brown bear is absent from historical records on Seoni, it might have ranged across most of northern India.|$|E
50|$|In {{the meadows}} and valleys around Tosh are Himalayan blue poppies, irises, marsh marigolds, primulas, buttercups, and Himalayan balsam flowers. Birds {{in the area}} include lamagiers, bull finches, rose finches, Himalayan griffons, white-capped water starts, and <b>brown</b> dippers. <b>Himalayan</b> <b>brown</b> and black <b>bears</b> are {{occasionally}} seen.|$|R
50|$|The Himalayas, {{created during}} the {{collision}} of the Indian and Asiatic continental plates, form the northern boundary of the Indian subcontinent. Valmik Thapar begins in the cold, dry desert of Ladakh, the northernmost region of India. A sequence of aerial mountain shots and typical fauna including snow leopard, Himalayan ibex and lammergeier is shown, followed by scenes of Buddhist monasteries and winter festivals. The Buddhist's respect for all nature stems from the ancient animist belief system in which animals were thought of as living embodiments of the spirit world. Wildlife is often plentiful around villages, where chukar, robin accentor and red-billed chough are commonly seen. Temperatures plunge to -30 Celsius in winter. Bharal can survive at great height by digging for roots or even climbing trees. Across the border in Pakistan, markhor are not so hardy, and must descend to lower elevations. In spring, melting snows reveal winter's casualties. Himalayan griffon vultures strip a carcass in 20 minutes, then lammergeiers carry away the bones. Further west in the meadows of Deosai, rarities such as <b>Himalayan</b> <b>brown</b> <b>bears,</b> kiang and black-necked cranes are filmed. Bar-headed geese cross the mountains to breed here, and marmots play fight in the meadows. Thapar then travels to {{the south side of}} the mountains where lush forests of oak, birch, spruce and rhododendron thrive on the monsoon rains. Animals in this region include Himalayan tahr, yellow-throated marten and grey langurs, shown feeding on Indian horse chestnut shoots. The golden langur, discovered in the 1950s, survives in the wild only in Bhutan and western Assam. In the north east of India, the animals of the Arunachal Pradesh are very different. Here, species from China and East Asia have colonised the forests. They include spectacular pheasants such as Himalayan monal, Temminck's tragopan and Blyth's tragopan. Mammals include red panda, Malayan giant squirrel and Hoolock gibbon, India's only ape. Valmik Thapar ends the programme at Namo Buddha in Nepal where legend has it Lord Buddha gave his life to a starving tigress and her cubs, and in doing so instilled a protective attitude to all creatures in his followers.|$|R
50|$|The Ussuri <b>brown</b> <b>bear</b> (Ursus arctos lasiotus), {{also known}} as the black grizzly is a {{population}} of the <b>brown</b> <b>bear.</b> One of the largest <b>brown</b> <b>bears,</b> Ussuri <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> approach the Kodiak <b>brown</b> <b>bear</b> in size.|$|R
50|$|They get {{different}} species of bears to portray as Baloo. There is one species of brown bear that lives in India, it's the <b>Himalayan</b> <b>Brown</b> <b>Bear.</b> In the original novel, Baloo {{is described as a}} sleepy, brown bear, a teacher of the Law of the Jungle and Mowgli's best friend.|$|E
50|$|Mammals, {{which are}} {{regularly}} sighted in this sanctuary are barking deer, yellow-throated marten, <b>Himalayan</b> <b>brown</b> <b>bear</b> and red panda. Beside these, takin, red fox and musk deer are also present at higher altitudes. Some very commonly seen mammals in this wildlife sanctuary are Himalayan striped squirrel and Royle's pika {{of the family}} Ochotonidae.|$|E
5000|$|The park {{is home to}} {{numerous}} wildlife species, including a small population of wild Asian elephants. Other inhabitants include thamin, wild pig, gaur, sambar, banteng, muntjac, clouded leopard, civets, jungle cats, <b>Himalayan</b> <b>brown</b> <b>bear,</b> sun bear, Oriental giant squirrel, Indian giant squirrel, hog badger, monitor lizards, macaques, barking deer and many types of birds.|$|E
2500|$|Russia's {{northeast}} part, the Kamchatka Peninsula and {{the coastal}} {{regions of the}} Pacific Ocean, have the highest density of <b>brown</b> <b>bears.</b> There are Eurasian <b>brown</b> <b>bear</b> (Ursus arctos arctos), Siberian <b>brown</b> <b>bear</b> (Ursus arctos beringianus), Syrian <b>brown</b> <b>bear</b> (Ursus arctos syriacus), Ussuri <b>brown</b> <b>bear</b> (Ursus arctos lasiotus), etc.|$|R
50|$|This {{subspecies}} of <b>brown</b> <b>bear</b> retains all of {{the physical}} attributes and behavior associated with the <b>brown</b> <b>bear,</b> however, they do carry mitochondrial DNA that shows a match closer to polar <b>bears</b> than <b>brown</b> <b>bears.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Eurasian <b>brown</b> <b>bear</b> (Ursus arctos arctos) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{subspecies}} of the <b>brown</b> <b>bear,</b> and is found in much of Eurasia. It is also known as the common <b>brown</b> <b>bear,</b> the European <b>brown</b> <b>bear,</b> the European bear, and colloquially by many other names. [...] "The genetic diversity of present-day <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> (Ursus arctos) has been extensively studied over the years and appears to be geographically structured into five main clades based upon analysis of the mtDNA." ...|$|R
50|$|Around 20 {{species of}} mammals, {{including}} some which are rare, threatened or endangered {{are found in}} within Kazinag National park. Key animal species sighted are markhor (Capra falconeri), Himalayan musk deer (Moschus leucogaster), <b>Himalayan</b> <b>brown</b> <b>bear</b> (Ursus arctos), Himalayan black bear (Ursus thibetanus), common leopard (Panthera pardus), Himalayan marmot (Marmota caudata) and small Kashmir flying squirrel (Eoglaucomys fimbriatus).|$|E
50|$|The Lidder Valley {{has many}} glacier-fed streams, and the tributaries of the Lidder River {{are home to}} {{different}} types of trout. The valley is the natural habitat of the Himalayan black bear. The <b>Himalayan</b> <b>brown</b> <b>bear,</b> musk deer, snow leopard and hangul have also been spotted in the Aru and Lidderwat areas, which are close to Dachigam National Park.|$|E
50|$|There are 44 mammal {{species in}} the Reserve that are enlisted as highly {{endangered}} in the red book of Kazakhstan. The most prominent species are the snow leopard which is, however, rarely seen. Somewhat more frequent is the <b>Himalayan</b> <b>brown</b> <b>bear,</b> the Tien Shan argali (Ovis ammon karelini), the Indian crested porcupine (Hystrix indica), and Menzbier's marmot.|$|E
50|$|<b>Brown</b> <b>bears</b> can {{be found}} {{throughout}} the state, with the minor exceptions of the islands west of Unimak in the Aleutians, the islands south of Frederick Sound in southeast Alaska, and the islands in the Bering Sea. Most <b>brown</b> <b>bears</b> in Alaska are grizzly bears (the subspecies of <b>brown</b> <b>bear</b> found throughout North America), but Kodiak Island is home to Kodiak bears, another subspecies that is the largest type of <b>brown</b> <b>bear</b> in the world. The <b>brown</b> <b>bear</b> is the top predator in Alaska.|$|R
