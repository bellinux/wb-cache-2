5|$|The {{report on}} the {{disaster}} indicated that it was necessary, with the signals concerned being on the right hand side of the train {{and because of the}} limited visibility from the left hand side of a steam locomotive, for either the fireman to observe those signals (but with the driver being responsible for asking him to do so) or for the driver to cross over the footplate from his left hand driving position to observe them from the other side. In the event, the driver did neither, and neither driver nor fireman looked out for the aspect of the signals. The report ascribed blame to the driver, but recommended that the class be fitted with wider windscreens to improve visibility, noting that, in fog with less than 80 yards' visibility, the three signals involved would not be visible at all from the driver's side of the footplate; however, it noted that, <b>even</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> Schools class locomotive with its much smaller boiler, it was unlikely that these signals could be seen from the driver's side in the dense foggy conditions of the incident. The report did not suggest that poor lifting of smoke obstructed visibility.|$|E

25|$|Darwin {{was still}} researching and experimenting with his ideas on natural {{selection}} {{when he received}} a letter from Alfred Russel Wallace describing a theory very similar to his own. This led to an immediate joint publication of both theories. Both Wallace and Darwin saw the history of life like a family tree, with each fork in the tree’s limbs being a common ancestor. The tips of the limbs represented modern species and the branches represented the common ancestors that are shared amongst many different species. To explain these relationships, Darwin said that all living things were related, and this meant that all life must be descended from a few forms, or <b>even</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> single common ancestor. He called this process descent with modification.|$|E

25|$|Angels {{take the}} role of {{intermediaries}} performing different tasks of God. They are often associated with abstract concepts, specific phenomena, carrying {{the laws of nature}} and can also appear personified. Due to hadith tradition, angels are generally said to be created out of light, although several traditions assume exceptions including angels created from fire or ice. For example, based on a tradition from Ibn Abbas, Azazil was an angel created from fire or <b>even</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> whole tribe of angels, created from fire. Some scholars like Al-Baydawi explained, fire and light are akin, thus it both delineate a luminous origin of angels. Others suggested a distinction between the angels of mercy, created from light and angels of punishment, created from fire.|$|E
25|$|In October 2009, {{the bridge}} option again {{surfaced}} in the public eye, {{with a group of}} backers again suggesting that a bridge would be a better option from an urban design, and <b>even</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> transport point of view. Critics noted that the proposal would delay other transport plans in the region due to the funding required for it, especially for a 2015 target. The then mayor of North Shore City, Andrew Williams, and the then Chairman of the Auckland Regional Council, Mike Lee, both opposed the reconsideration of existing decisions that had been in favour of a tunnel. The then mayor of Auckland City, John Banks, also favoured the tunnel option, though he did not outright oppose the bridge idea, while the then mayor of Manukau City, Len Brown, considered the bridge proposal worthy of consideration.|$|E

500|$|The {{results showed}} that, {{compared}} with its peer locomotives, City of Bradford's coal consumption {{was the second}} lowest (and well below the third lowest), but its power output was well below any of its peers. In later years some insight has emerged concerning No. 46236's outings. On the WR, having arrived at Plymouth from Paddington, the dynamometer crew were amazed that such a large locomotive had consumed so little coal; on the undulating tracks of the SR west of Salisbury, it was alleged that coal consumption was held down by running gently uphill then racing downhill without any attempt to follow the timetable passing times. Additionally, {{a photograph of the}} locomotive leaving Kings Cross, bound for Leeds on the ER, shows the locomotive with so little coal on board that none could be seen <b>even</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> somewhat elevated vantage point. [...] In other publications, driver Byford has been heavily criticised for his lacklustre driving [...] Certainly, Byford was so obsessed with minimising coal consumption that he never attempted to demonstrate any other facet of performance, but when coal consumption was being so accurately measured it was a reasonable assumption to draw that coal efficiency was the predominant requirement. Many years later, there was a degree of exoneration for driver Byford when the whole procedure was described as [...] "the most inconsequential and unrepresentative series of competitive trials ever to be held on the railways of Great Britain".|$|E
