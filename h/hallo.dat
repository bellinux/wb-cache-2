25|$|Rosenzweig, unimpressed {{with the}} impersonal {{learning}} of the academy, founded the House of Jewish Learning in Frankfurt in 1920, which sought to engage in dialogue with human beings rather than merely accumulate knowledge. The Lehrhaus, as it was known in Germany, produced many prominent Jewish intellectuals. In October 1922, Rudolf <b>Hallo</b> took over {{the leadership of the}} Lehrhaus. It stayed open until 1930 and was reopened by Martin Buber in 1933.|$|E

We are to {{understand}} that the Attendant Spirit has <b>halloed</b> just before entering; this is shown by the stage-direction given in the edition of Comus printed by Lawes in 1637: He hallos; the Guardian Dæmon <b>hallos</b> again, and enters in the habit of a shepherd.|$|R

25|$|None of {{the extant}} {{laws of the}} Ancient Near East deal with tithing, {{although}} other secondary documents show {{that it was a}} widespread practice in the Ancient Near East. William W. <b>Hallo</b> (1996) recognises comparisons for Israel with its ancient Near Eastern environment, however, as regards tithes, comparisons with other ancient Near Eastern evidence is ambiguous, and Ancient Near Eastern literature provides scant evidence for the practice of tithing and the collection of tithes.|$|E
25|$|Ninth Avenue {{is noted}} for its many ethnic restaurants. The Ninth Avenue Association's International Food Festival {{stretches}} through the Kitchen from 42nd to 57th Streets every May, usually on the third weekend of the month. It {{has been going on}} since 1974 {{and is one of the}} oldest street fairs in the city. There are Caribbean, Chinese, French, German, Greek, Italian, Irish, Mexican, and Thai restaurants as well as multiple Afghan, Argentine, Ethiopian, Peruvian, Turkish, Indian, Pakistani, and Vietnamese restaurants. Restaurant Row, so called because of the abundance of restaurants, is located on West 46th Street between Eighth and Ninth Avenues. Notable establishments on Ninth Avenue include Mickey Spillane's, part-owned by the mobster's son, who also owns Mr Biggs on Tenth Avenue/43rd Street. There are more restaurants and food carts and trucks on Tenth Avenue between 43rd and 47th Streets, including <b>Hallo</b> Berlin.|$|E

500|$|The oeuvre {{comprises}} instrumental, vocal, orchestral and choral music. Early in her compositional career Imogen {{was primarily}} influenced, as Gustav Holst's daughter, {{by what the}} analyst Christopher Tinker terms [...] "her natural and inescapable relationship with the English musical establishment", and by her close personal relationship with her father. Some of her first compositions reflect the pastoralism of Ralph Vaughan Williams, who taught her at the RCM. In her teaching and EFDSS years during the 1930s she became known for her folksong arrangements but composed little music herself. The personal style {{that emerged in the}} 1940s incorporated her affinity with folksong and dance, her intense interest in English music of the 16th and 17th centuries, and her taste for innovation. In her 1930 suite for solo viola, she had begun experimenting with scale patterns; by the 1940s she was incorporating her own six- and eight-note scales into her chamber music and occasionally into choral works such as the Five Songs (1944). This experimentation reappears in later works; in <b>Hallo</b> My Fancy (1972) a new scale is introduced for each verse, while the choir provides free harmonisation to a solo voice. In Homage to William Morris (1984), among her final works, Tinker notes her use of dissonance [...] "to add strength to the musical articulation of the text". By contrast, the String Quintet of 1982, the work which Imogen herself thought made her [...] "a real composer", is characterised by the warmth of its harmonies.|$|E

No, there ain't says Owen. Look here says I.

2500|$|Katmai National Park and Preserve {{is one of}} {{the best}} spots to view brown bears. The bear {{population}} in Katmai is estimated at a healthy 2,100. The park is located on the Alaskan Peninsula about [...] southwest of the city of Anchorage. At Brooks Camp, a famous site exists where grizzlies can be seen catching salmon from atop a platform—you can even view this online from a cam. In coastal areas of the park, such as [...] <b>Hallo</b> Bay, Geographic Harbor, Swikshak Lagoon, American Creek, Big River, Kamishak River, Savonoski River, Moraine Creek, Funnel Creek, Battle Creek, Nantuk Creek, Kukak Bay, and Kaflia Bay you can often watch bears fishing alongside wolves, eagles, and river otters. Coastal areas host the highest population densities year round because there is a larger variety of food sources available, but Brooks Camp hosts the highest population (100 bears).|$|E
2500|$|Sumerian {{literature}} {{continued in}} rich development during the Akkadian period. Enheduanna, the [...] "wife (Sumerian dam = high priestess) of Nanna [...] and daughter of Sargon" [...] {{of the temple}} of Sin at Ur, who lived –2250 BC, is the first poet in history whose name is known. Her known works include hymns to the goddess Inanna, the Exaltation of Inanna and In-nin sa-gur-ra. A third work, the Temple Hymns, a collection of specific hymns, addresses the sacred temples and their occupants, the deity to whom they were consecrated. The works of this poet are significant, because although they start out using the third person, they shift to the first person voice of the poet herself, and they mark a significant development {{in the use of}} cuneiform. As poet, princess, and priestess, she was a personality who, according to William W <b>Hallo,</b> [...] "set standards in all three of her roles for many succeeding centuries" ...|$|E
