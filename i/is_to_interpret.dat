25|$|The next {{feature to}} be {{discussed}} is the oval shaped curves representing islands of constant efficiency. In this figure we see 11 contours ranging from 56% efficiency (decimal 0.56) to 76% efficiency (decimal 0.76). General standard practice <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>interpret</b> these efficiencies as isentropic rather than polytropic. The inclusion of efficiency islands effectively generates a 3-dimensional topology to this 2-dimensional map. With inlet density specified, it provides a further ability to calculate aerodynamic power. Lines of constant power {{could just as easily}} be substituted.|$|E
25|$|The goal {{of local}} helioseismology, a term first used in 1993, <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>interpret</b> the full wave field {{observed}} at the surface, {{not just the}} mode (more precisely, eigenmode) frequencies. Another {{way to look at}} it, is that global helioseismology studies standing waves of the entire Sun and local helioseismology studies propagating waves in parts of the Sun. A variety of solar phenomena are being studied, including sunspots, plage, supergranulation, giant cell convection, magnetically active region evolution, meridional circulation, and solar rotation. Local helioseismology provides a three-dimensional view of the solar interior, which is important to understand large-scale flows, magnetic structures, and their interactions in the solar interior.|$|E
25|$|Scalia also {{attacked}} {{the majority opinion}} as being fundamentally antidemocratic. His dissent cited a passage from The Federalist Papers in arguing {{that the role of}} the judiciary in the constitutional scheme <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>interpret</b> the law as formulated in democratically selected legislatures. He argued that the Court exists to rule on what the law says, not what it should say, and that it is for the legislature, acting in the manner prescribed in Article V of the Constitution to offer amendments to the Constitution in light of the evolving standard of decency, not for the Court to arbitrarily make de facto amendments. He challenged the right of unelected lawyers to discern moral values and to impose them on the people in the name of flexible readings of the constitutional text.|$|E

25|$|Schenkerian {{analysis}} {{is a method}} of musical analysis of tonal music based on the theories of Heinrich Schenker (1868–1935). The goal of a Schenkerian analysis <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>interpret</b> the underlying structure of a tonal work and to help reading the score according to that structure. The theory's basic tenets {{can be viewed as}} a way of defining tonality in music. A Schenkerian analysis of a passage of music shows hierarchical relationships among its pitches, and draws conclusions about the structure of the passage from this hierarchy. The analysis makes use of a specialized symbolic form of musical notation that Schenker devised to demonstrate various techniques of elaboration. The most fundamental concept of Schenker's theory of tonality may be that of tonal space. The intervals between the notes of the tonic triad form a tonal space that is filled with passing and neighbour notes, producing new triads and new tonal spaces, open for further elaborations until the surface of the work (the score) is reached.|$|E
25|$|The Preface to {{the poem}} {{suggests}} that the poem {{was not supposed to}} be printed, that it was a fragmentary work that he was unable to complete, and that the work itself was provided to him through involuntary inspiration. When the Preface is dropped, the poem seems to compare the act of poetry with the might of Kubla Khan instead of the loss of inspiration causing the work to have a more complex depiction of the poetic power. Taken together, the Preface could connect with {{the first half of the}} poem to suggest that the poem is from the view of a dreaming narrator, or it could connect with the second half of the poem to show how a reader <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>interpret</b> the lines by connecting himself with the persona in a negative manner. The Preface and the poem are different in their locations, as the Preface discusses Coleridge's England while the poem discusses ancient China, but both discuss the role of the poem and his abilities. The poet of the Preface is a dreamer who must write and the poet of the poem is a vocal individual, but both are poets who lose inspiration. Only the poet of the poem feels that he can recover the vision, and the Preface, like a Coleridge poem that is quoted in it, The Picture, states that visions are unrecoverable.|$|E
500|$|Similarly, the Athshean {{word for}} [...] "dream" [...] {{is the same}} as the word for [...] "root". Athsheans have learned to exert some {{conscious}} control over their dreams, and their actions are dictated by both their dream experiences and their conscious non-dreaming thoughts. Thus their dreaming makes them rooted, something which is demonstrated through their use of language. The Athshean word for [...] "god" [...] {{is the same as}} the word for [...] "translator", representing this role that [...] "gods have" [...] in their society, which <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>interpret</b> and translate their dreams into actions.|$|E

500|$|Black forged the 5–2 {{majority}} in the 1967 decision Fortson v. Morris, [...] which cleared the path for the Georgia State Legislature to choose the governor in the deadlocked 1966 race between Democrat Lester Maddox and Republican Howard Callaway. Whereas Black voted with the majority under strict construction to uphold the state constitutional provision, his colleagues Douglas and Fortas dissented. According to Douglas, Georgia tradition would guarantee a Maddox victory though he had trailed Callaway by some three thousand votes {{in the general election}} returns. Douglas also saw the issue as a continuation of the earlier decision Gray v. Sanders, which had struck down Georgia's County Unit System, a kind of electoral college formerly used to choose the governor. Black argued that the U.S. Constitution does not dictate how a state must choose its governor. [...] "Our business is not to write laws to fit the day. Our task <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>interpret</b> the Constitution," [...] Black explained.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{impossible}} for the observation of a black raven to increase the probability of the proposition [...] "All ravens are black" [...] without causing exactly the same change to the probability that [...] "All non-black things are non-ravens".

2500|$|As {{described}} above, many animal gestures, postures, and sounds, convey {{meaning to}} nearby animals. These signals are often easier to describe than to interpret.

Also, the same gesture may have different meanings depending on context within which it occurs.
