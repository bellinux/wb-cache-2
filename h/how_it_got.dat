25|$|Meyer and Mooyer, who {{published}} {{the contents of}} the manuscript in 1833, comment that the copier and compiler seemed to have organized his materials haphazardly and all-too freely (even carelessly) adapted spelling to his own taste; a sixteenth-century editor corrected many errors in the manuscript's margins. Still, many lines appear to be missing and others make little sense. The manuscript was long thought lost, until it was rediscovered in the city library of Bremen. <b>How</b> <b>it</b> <b>got</b> there from Switzerland is unknown. A page is retained in the fragment of a collection c. 1380, written on paper in the Alsace and edited by Robert Priebsch; the fragment was in the collection of August Closs, which was bequeathed to the Institute of Germanic and Romance Studies. Modern scholars of the poem cite it from Friedrich Heinrich von der Hagen's Hundert altdeutsche Erzählungen (1850; republished 1961); a new edition was announced as part of a project by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Edition und Kommentierung der deutschen Versnovellistik des 13. und 14.

500|$|The Smithsonian Institution has {{categorized}} The Quest as both {{abstract and}} figurative. In 2002, journalist Sallie Tisdale of The Oregonian described the sculpture as a [...] "large tangle of snow-white bodies in a fountain".

As of 1990, The Quest was considered Portland's largest single piece of white sculptured marble. It was surveyed and considered [...] "well maintained" [...] by the Smithsonian's [...] "Save Outdoor Sculpture!" [...] program in January 1994. Maintenance on the sculpture has included caulking and repairs to the male figure's nose.|$|E

500|$|Katy Butler {{wrote in}} the San Francisco Bay Guardian that the TVTV style had {{improved}} since their previous work: [...] "This show has fewer interjections from TVTV personnel, fewer moments that drag, more technological razzle-dazzle (color footage, slow motion, stop motion, tight and rapid cutting)." [...] However, she described Guru Maharaj Ji and his entourage as [...] "an easy target" [...] and wrote that [...] "anybody can look like a fool when a smartass wide angle lens distorts their face, and teenage ex-dopers who think a fat boy is God don't stand a chance". [...] Butler wished that TVTV would move on to more challenging subjects for their future work. Bob Williams of the New York Post called the documentary a [...] "deplorable film" [...] and [...] "flat, pointless, television". [...] He wrote: [...] "The hour-long program was remiss in not providing some small examination of the available box-office take of the goofy kid guru, much less telling prospective contributors <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>got</b> involved in spending how much of its foundation grants and viewer subscription money in such a questionable venture without more inquisitive journalistic endeavor, or ignoring gurus." ...|$|E

500|$|The Doctor {{dismisses the}} {{possibility}} that these are ghosts and conducts an experiment {{with the help of}} the TARDIS. He attempts to trap a ghost and determines that they are not ghosts but are impressions of something forcing its way into this universe. The Doctor tracks the signal back and uses the TARDIS to travel there, arriving at the Torchwood Institute. The Doctor introduces himself and tells everyone that Jackie is Rose, his companion. They are taken by soldiers to see Torchwood's current director Yvonne Hartman, while the TARDIS is impounded with Rose inside. Ms. Hartman shows the Doctor the source of the ghost energy, an invisible breach in the universe through which a mysterious spherical object has arrived. The Doctor inspects the sphere, declaring it to be a [...] "Void ship"—which, according to him, is impossible. It is designed to exist in the space between universes, a nothingness called the Void. The ship is completely undetectable by all scientific instruments. Torchwood has no explanation for what the sphere is or <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>got</b> there, but they claim responsibility for the ghosts. Torchwood has been conducting experiments on the breach, forcing it open in an attempt to harness it as a source of energy. Ms. Hartman also reveals to the Doctor that his encounter with Queen Victoria in [...] "Tooth and Claw" [...] made him an enemy of the state and was the catalyst for the creation of Torchwood. Unbeknownst to all at this point, an unseen party has infiltrated the institute and has been successful in subverting three Torchwood staff.|$|E
500|$|The Hendrix {{defense team}} did not dispute that the drugs {{were found in}} his bag. They instead {{developed}} a strategy intended to demonstrate {{that he was not}} aware of its contents. Further, they offered substantiated accounts of how common it was for him to receive gifts from fans, which often included drugs. Hendrix was called as the first witness for the defense; he testified that fans showered gifts on him, including teddy bears, scarves, clothing, and jewelry. He explained that while in Beverly Hills, California, a female fan had given him a vial of what he thought was Bromo-Seltzer—a legal medication—which he put in his bag without knowledge of the illegal substances contained therein. Malone countered: [...] "You are charged with a serious offense, and your evidence is you don't really know <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>got</b> there, or who put it there", to which Hendrix responded: [...] "Yes." [...] The prosecutor then held up the aluminum tube in which the hashish was found and asked Hendrix to explain what he thought it was, he replied: [...] "A pea shooter", drawing uproarious laughter from the court. When asked about his drug use, he denied that he had ever used heroin or amphetamines, but admitted to smoking cannabis and hashish. He also admitted that he had used cocaine twice and LSD five times. He testified that his cannabis use had declined over the previous year, stating: [...] "I feel I have outgrown it". Hendrix admitted that he had seen people use heroin, but denied any further knowledge of the drug. He testified that he was given some gifts at a fan club meeting for the Beatles that were intended for the English group; when he opened them he found several joints as well as what appeared to be doses of LSD.|$|E
