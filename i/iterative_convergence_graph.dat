However, the conventional FE-BI-MLFMA often suffers from <b>iterative</b> <b>convergence</b> problems. A non-overlapping domain decomposition method (DDM) is applied to FE-BI-MLFMA {{to speed up the}} <b>iterative</b> <b>convergence.</b> Furthermore, a preconditioner based on absorbing boundary condition and symmetric successive over relaxation (ABC-SSOR) is constructed to further accelerate convergence of the DDM-FE-BI-MLFMA. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed preconditioned DDM-FE-BI-MLFMA. 1...|$|R

This paper presents a detailed and systematic evaluation {{of the performance of}} 3 D steady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) CFD simulations to predict the temperature stratification within a room with a heat source and two ventilation openings. The indoor air quality within the room is also investigated by assessing the distribution of the age of air. The evaluation is based on validation with full-scale measurements of air temperature. A sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate the impact of computational grid resolution, turbulence model, discretization schemes and <b>iterative</b> <b>convergence</b> on the predicted temperatures and age of air. The results show that steady RANS with the SST k-¿ model can accurately predict the temperature stratification in this particular indoor environment.
