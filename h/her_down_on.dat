Her mother was of French, Dutch and German ancestry and her father {{was the son of}} a wealthy {{manufacturer}} of railway cars and of English descent. Her maternal grandfather's father was Jewish. When Barney was five years old her family spent the summer at New York's Long Beach Hotel where Oscar Wilde happened to be speaking on his American lecture tour. [...] Wilde scooped her up as she ran past him fleeing a group of small boys, held her out of their reach then sat <b>her</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> his knee and told her a story.

She later studied under Carolus-Duran and James McNeill Whistler. Many of Alice Pike Barney's paintings are now in the Smithsonian American Art Museum.|$|E
