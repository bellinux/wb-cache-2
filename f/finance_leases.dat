Capital allowances are {{given by the}} Capital Allowances Act 2001 (CAA 2001). Note that expenditure on <b>finance</b> <b>leases</b> (as opposed to, say, lease or hire purchase agreements) {{is considered to be}} revenue.

Users are permitted to transition to the new standard either by full retrospective application (i.e., restating all leases {{as if they had}} always been accounted for under IFRS 16, with the difference between asset and liability at the transition date charged to retained earnings) or by a cumulative catch-up methodology, in which <b>finance</b> <b>leases</b> continue unchanged while IAS 17 operating leases are converted to <b>finance</b> <b>leases</b> with the initial liability and asset equal to the present value of the remaining rent (using the lessee's incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate for the present value).|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} the comparison of accounting of <b>financing</b> <b>leasing</b> in accordance with CAS (Czech Accounting Standards) and IFRS. Definitions and classification of the leasing are described in the theoretical part. The basic terms are explained {{in accordance with the}} form of the aforesaid standards. The practical part deals only with the <b>financing</b> <b>leasing</b> and results from the particular contract of <b>financing</b> <b>leasing</b> concluded between a leasehold provider (leasing company) and a leaseholder. Accounting of the single steps of the leaseholder and the leasehold provider is elaborated {{on the basis of the}} contract. It is firstly accomplished according to the form of CAS and consequently of IFRS. Both two methods are compared and the found differences between the standards are described at the end of the thesis...|$|R
5000|$|The term {{sometimes}} means {{a special}} case of lease defined by Article 2A of the Uniform Commercial Code (specifically, Sec. 2A-103(1) (g)). Such a finance lease recognizes that some lessors are financial institutions or other business organizations that lease the goods in question purely as a financial accommodation and {{do not want to}} have the warranty and other entanglements that are usually associated with leases by companies that are manufacturers or merchants of such goods. Under a UCC 2A finance lease, the lessee pays the payments to the lessor (and indeed must do so, regardless of any defect in the leased goods - this obligation usually being contained in a [...] "hell or high water" [...] clause), but any claims related to defects in the leased goods may be brought only against the actual supplier of the goods. UCC 2A <b>finance</b> <b>leases</b> are usually easy to identify because they commonly contain a clause specifically declaring that the lease is to be considered a finance lease under UCC 2A.|$|E
50|$|According to Polish law, the {{registration}} plate {{is tied to}} the vehicle, not the owner. There is no possibility for the owner to keep the licence number for use on a different car, even if it's a custom number. The licence plates are issued by the powiat (county) of the vehicle owner's registered address of residence, {{in the case of a}} natural person. If it is owned by a legal person, the place of registration is determined by the address of its seat. Vehicles leased under operating leases and many de facto <b>finance</b> <b>leases</b> will be registered at the seat of the lessor. When a vehicle changes hands, the new owner must apply for new vehicle registration document bearing his or her name and registered address. The new owner may obtain a new licence plate although it is not necessary when new owner's residence address lies in the same area as the previous owner's. In such a situation the licence plates are usually carried over to the new owner, because the change carries an additional cost. Upon purchasing a vehicle from another person, if the vehicle has an EU plate, the new owner must replace it with a license for their address and area, and give the EU plate to their powiat plate mint to free up numbers in the future. If the car has a pre- May 1, 2006 plate, the owner is free to do whatever they wish with it, as long as it's legal with the Polish law. The plaque cannot be replaced if destroyed. The change of the whole set is required.|$|E

50|$|Under American and British {{accounting}} rules, a <b>finance</b> <b>lease</b> {{is generally}} defined {{as one in}} which the lessor receives substantially all rights of ownership, or in which the present value of the minimum lease payments {{for the duration of the}} lease exceeds 90% of the fair market value of the aircraft. If a lease is defined as a <b>finance</b> <b>lease,</b> it must be counted as an asset of the company, in contrast to an operating lease which only affects the company's cash flow.|$|R

40|$|The present thesis {{analyzes}} the statutory regulation of leasing transactions in the Czech Republic, {{both from the}} perspective of the general legislation and {{from the perspective of}} the tax laws. Since operating and finance lease contracts are not classified under nominate (named) contracts in the Czech Civil or the Commercial Codes, the principal legal aspects of this commercial arrangement have been established largely by way of evolving judicial and business practice. The absence of the general legal regulation, particularly with respect to <b>finance</b> <b>leases,</b> has also had some important consequences for tax laws and their application. The thesis also describes the distinguishing features of <b>finance</b> <b>leases</b> compared to the general lease contracts. A thoughtful statutory regulation of leasing transactions would therefore bring about the much-needed legal certainty for all parties involved in and affected by lease contracts. The present thesis sets out both a thorough description of the current state of law with respect to lease contracts and puts forwards proposals on how to improve the enactments of law in future...|$|E
