50|$|Kit Weston was {{introduced}} in Black Cat #28 Thirteen-year-old Kit Weston was a circus aerialist, part of the act The Flying Westons. During a performance, the tent is engulfed in flames by the super-criminal The <b>Fire</b> <b>Bug.</b> The Black Cat saves Kit when he’s trapped by the fire on a trapeze platform. However, Kit’s parents are killed in the blaze. Linda Turner volunteers shelter to the orphan until relatives can be found. Later, in order to cheer the despondent youth, Linda appears to him as Black Cat and takes him with her as she trails The <b>Fire</b> <b>Bug.</b> Black Cat corners the villain at the municipal museum and, with Kit’s aid, defeats him. The <b>Fire</b> <b>Bug</b> is revealed to be Orson Arson, a former special effects wizard at Century Studio.|$|E
50|$|From 1982 until 1985, Hudson was a {{technical}} editor for Atari 8-bit computer magazine ANALOG Computing. While at ANALOG, {{he wrote a}} number of machine language games printed as type-in programs, including Fill 'er Up (based on Qix), Livewire! (based on Tempest), Retrofire, Planetary Defense (co-written with Charles Bachand) and <b>Fire</b> <b>Bug</b> (co-written with Kyle Peacock). All games were accompanied by the assembly language source code.|$|E
50|$|Photoperiod is {{the most}} {{important}} stimulus initiating diapause. The initiation phase begins when morphological development ceases. In some cases, this change may be very distinct and can involve moulting into a specific diapause stage, or be accompanied by color change. Enzymatic changes may take place in preparation for cold hardening. For example, only diapausing adults of the <b>fire</b> <b>bug,</b> Pyrrhocoris apterus, have the enzymatic complement that allows them to accumulate polyhydric alcohols, molecules that help to lower their freezing points and thus avoid freezing. Insects may also undergo behavioural changes and begin to aggregate, migrate, or search for suitable overwintering sites.|$|E

50|$|When {{the chief}} misses his shots, Sam decides {{to shoot it}} himself. When he <b>fires</b> his shot, <b>Bugs,</b> hiding behind rocks, fires a bullet by {{slingshot}} into the chief's head and the chief scolds Sam. When Sam <b>fires,</b> <b>Bugs</b> {{does the same thing}} and the chief tells Sam he will be dead meat if he does it again. Sam is suspicious that someone else is firing at them and to prove it; he fakes a shot, looks behind him and sees Bugs launch another bullet into chief's head. When Sam screams at Bugs, this provokes the chief into punching his boss, believing Sam shot him on purpose.|$|R
50|$|The {{harlequin}} {{cabbage bug}} (Murgantia histrionica), {{also known as}} calico bug, <b>fire</b> <b>bug</b> or harlequin bug, is a black stinkbug of the family Pentatomidae, brilliantly marked with red, orange and yellow markings. It is destructive to cabbage and related plants in tropical America as well as throughout most of North America, especially the warmer parts of the United States. In addition to cabbage {{it can be a}} major pest to crops such as broccoli, radishes, and the ornamental flower cleome. Nymphs are active during the summer and in the tropics the bug can achieve three to six generations a year. In the northern range there is only one generation annually and the insects overwinter as adults.|$|E
50|$|Donkey Kong {{hangs from}} vines {{at the center}} of the screen, and the player-controlled Stanley the exterminator runs and jumps on {{platforms}} beneath him. Stanley can <b>fire</b> <b>bug</b> spray at both Donkey Kong and insects flying around the levels. A level is completed by continually using bug spray on Donkey Kong, forcing him to the top of the screen, or by killing all of the bugs. A super spray can on the vines falls down when Donkey Kong is sprayed past it. The super spray only lasts for a limited number of shots, but it pushes Donkey Kong upward at a much faster rate, making it easier to complete the level. It only appears at the start of each life.|$|E
50|$|In June 1970 a Porsche 911 Targa 'Polizei' car (509) {{fitted with}} Whizzwheels was released. It {{was based on}} a real Swiss police vehicle with its colour scheme of white and red and was fitted with a blue light on an {{extension}} next to the door and a die-cast loud hailer on the engine cover. The <b>Fire</b> <b>Bug</b> (395) appeared in December 1971, and {{was based on a}} GP Beach Buggy fitted with fire fighting equipment. British police vehicles were well represented with the Police 'Vigilant' Range Rover (461) released in January 1972 and the Ford Cortina Police Car (402) released in August of the same year. Both models were finished in the contemporary white with red/blue side stripes, which would have been familiar to many motorists at the time. The Range Rover came complete with a model policeman and emergency road signs, while the Cortina was also released with 'Polizei' labels on the otherwise unchanged British car as an export model for the German-speaking countries.|$|E
50|$|Bugs is next seen using a {{rotisserie}} {{to roast}} carrots {{over an open}} fire when Taz catches up with him. Taz quickly ties Bugs to the rotisserie and begins to cook him over the <b>fire.</b> <b>Bugs</b> (out of picture) instructs Taz to turn him faster and as Taz complies, it is revealed that he is really turning a crank of a truck engine. Taz is run over by the truck and Bugs escapes once again.|$|R
5000|$|Bugs {{searches}} for items {{out of which}} to manufacture a gun, in the end settling on the hollow stick that previously contained the toxic berry Elmer swallowed by mistake for a gunbarrel, and [...] "a taro root for a stock." [...] Elmer grows impatient, but Bugs soon attaches the root to {{one end of the}} stick, pours in powder and pebbles, and hands the finished product to his pursuer. He lights the fuse with an extremely primitive version of a cigarette lighter, but right before he <b>fires,</b> <b>Bugs</b> removes the stock and plugs it into {{the other end of the}} barrel, causing Elmer to shoot himself in the face.|$|R
5000|$|On a {{cold and}} snowy night, Bugs wangles {{his way into the}} good graces, and more importantly, the house, {{belonging}} to an old lady (voiced by Bea Benaderet). Sylvester, her dog (voiced by writer Tedd Pierce), takes an instant dislike to the Bunny, and most of the cartoon is spent with the two tricking each other into going outside the house and getting locked out. Finally they get into a schtick where they are each throwing the other out the front door in turn, in quick succession. The old lady, fed up with all the bickering by now, intervenes (out of frame) and tells them both to get out, when suddenly she is thrown out, startled and indignant. Bugs and the dog have made peace, and are lazing by the <b>fire.</b> <b>Bugs</b> turns to the audience and says, in typical fashion, [...] "Gee, ain't I a stinker?" ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{relationship}} between the place of origin and the extend of cold hardiness of <b>fire</b> <b>bug</b> Pyrrhocoris apterus (Linnaeus, 1758). Thirteen populations from twelve European localities were used in the experiment. Linear regressions were used to relate the values of SCP (10 th percentile, first quartile, mean and median) of the individual populations to minimum and average winter temperatures of given localities. The relationship between air temperatures and SCP values were significant provided that the data of all populations were used. After the removal of three southern non-diapausing populations this relationship lost its significance...|$|E
40|$|Corio{{bacterium}} glomerans Haas and Konig 1988, is {{the only}} species of the genus Coriobacterium, family Coriobacteriaceae, order Coriobacteriales, phylum Actinobacteria. The bacterium thrives as an endosymbiont of pyrrhocorid bugs, i. e. the red <b>fire</b> <b>bug</b> Pyrrhocoris apterus L. The rationale for sequencing the genome of strain PW 2 (T) is its endosymbiotic life style which is rare among members of Actinobacteria. Here we describe the features of this symbiont, together with the complete genome sequence and its annotation. This is the first complete genome sequence {{of a member of}} the genus Coriobacterium and the sixth member of the order Coriobacteriales for which complete genome sequences are now available. The 2, 115, 681 bp long single replicon genome with its 1, 804 protein-coding and 54 RNA genes is part of the Genomic Encyclopedia of Bacteria and Archaea project...|$|E
40|$|Pyrrhacoricin is a {{naturally}} occurring antimicrobial peptide from the European <b>fire</b> <b>bug</b> Pyrrhocoris apterus. It has submicromolar activity against {{a range of}} Gram-negative bacterial strains and has created recent interest as a lead {{for the development of}} novel antibiotic compounds. In this study, we have used NMR spectroscopy to determine the solution structures of pyrrhocoricin and a synthetic macrocyclic derivative that has improved in vivo pharmaceutical properties. Native pyrrhocoricin is largely disordered in solution, but there is evidence of a subpopulation with ordered turn regions over residues 2 - 5, 4 - 7, and 16 - 19. The macrocyclic derivative incorporates a nine amino acid linker joining the N- and C-termini, which does not adversely affect the antimicrobial potency but leads to a broader spectrum of activity. The NMR data suggest that the turn conformations in the cyclic derivative are similar to those in the native form, thus implicating them in the biological function.

5000|$|They {{begin the}} typical ten-pace and <b>fire,</b> only with <b>Bugs</b> going {{the same way}} Sam does, when Sam cheats in the count ("1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10!"). Sam turns to fire, but <b>fires</b> {{directly}} past <b>Bugs,</b> who then kisses him on the nose. After Bugs does it again, Sam calls off the [...] "Gentlemen's Duel" [...] and forces Bugs to fight [...] "dirty", so they each go to opposite ends of a bar shooting at each other. As Sam goes to one end, Bugs blasts him in the face, and when Sam tries to return, Bugs outruns and blasts him again. Unfortunately, their fight is interrupted when Sam hears a train whistle. Seeing that it's 5:15, Sam tells Bugs that he's cutting the gunfight short {{so that he can}} catch and rob the train.|$|R
50|$|Sam {{tries to}} saw out a brick in {{the gate to}} get {{entrance}} into the fort but Bugs puts a cannon in the hole, much to Sam's shock. <b>Bugs</b> <b>fires,</b> launching Sam across the desert.

50|$|Bugs and Captain Sam battle {{each other}} in a fierce duel. Bugs first manages to find and shoot Sam first time ("Blast, ya rabbit! Two can play that game!"), and when Sam tries to himself, he ends up being shot again. When Sam is filling his cannons and <b>firing</b> them, <b>Bugs</b> wanders onto Sam's ship and shoots Sam as he is filling one, turning Sam into a pile of rubble. Later, Sam tries the same method on Bugs but this time, the cannon instead {{launches}} backwards into Sam, shooting himself out of the ship's side. Sam then tries to swing aboard Bugs' ship. ("Prepare to defend yourself, rabbit, cuz I'm a-boarding your ship! Charge!") However, there is another cannon in Sam's path resulting in him landing in the cannon. The cannon fires as Sam tries to retreat (this gag was already used in Bunker Hill Bunny).|$|R
5000|$|Bugs {{is hanging}} by a rope and Sam is putting {{wood in the}} oven. After a few {{annoyances}} for Sam with his hat, Bugs is obliged {{to go into the}} oven. Bugs comes out several times and brings in some items like a fan and a pitcher of water, chairs, party favors, emptying ashtrays in Sam's hat. Sam gets mad and Bugs pops out of the stove (covered with lipsticks) and tells Sam there is party going on and Sam goes inside. Bugs comes out and starts putting more wood in the <b>fire,</b> but <b>Bugs</b> has regrets. When Bugs takes a look inside, he sees that the party is real. Bugs goes back in and comes out in the end with party favors and wearing a hat and says, in the manner of Jerry Colonna, [...] "I don't ask questions; I just have fun!", and joins in.|$|R
5000|$|Unimpressed at {{this skill}} of sharp {{shooting}}, Sam shows Bugs some real shooting by tossing a {{can in the}} air and shooting it full of holes. To top it, Bugs tosses the same can up, but shoots Sam in the face instead. (Some versions depict <b>Bugs</b> <b>firing</b> bullets through the holes in the can instead of shooting Sam.) When Sam threatens to blast Bugs for that [...] "accident," [...] Bugs suggests that they settle things [...] "in a gentleman-like manner", to which Sam agrees to, even though it's against his principles.|$|R
5000|$|Tired {{of playing}} second banana to Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck demands his own cartoon from Warner Bros., but is {{promptly}} fired. Aspiring stuntman DJ Drake {{is asked to}} escort Daffy off the studio lot, but the ensuing chase leads to the Batmobile demolishing the studio water tower. DJ is also fired in the process, and returns home with Daffy hitching a ride, discovering his father, action film star, Damian Drake, is actually a secret agent. Damian instructs his son to travel to Las Vegas, find his associate Dusty Tails, and gain the mystical [...] "blue monkey" [...] diamond, but he is shortly thereafter captured by the Acme Corporation, led by the childish Mr. Chairman. DJ and Daffy head for Vegas. Meanwhile, Bugs' routines fall apart without Daffy, so [...] "Vice-President of Comedy," [...] Kate Houghton, is sent to rehire Daffy or face being <b>fired</b> herself. <b>Bugs</b> informs Kate of the situation, so they steal Damian's spy car, and pursue DJ and Daffy.|$|R
50|$|The {{objective}} is to save all of the bugs rolling round the screen, {{before they reach the}} opening to the Black Bug Empire's underground lair. When one bug reaches the opening, the player loses a life and the other bugs in the line quickly rush underground. The player can save the <b>bugs</b> by <b>firing</b> a coloured <b>bug</b> from Tumble's back towards a group of two or more of the same coloured balls. When three or more of the same colour come in contact with each other, they are set free, possibly triggering other bugs to escape as part of a chain reaction.|$|R

When Ala Bahma discovers that Bugs has snuck out from behind him while feigning pain, Bugs runs and attempts to jump into his hat but hits it on the barricade. Ala Bahma charges at Bugs to kill him, but Bugs plays a statues game on the magician. Once Ala Bahma gets close enough, Bugs dresses up as a fencer for Ala Bahma to fight him. Bugs escapes to the balcony to heckle Ala Bahma. Realizing {{that he has been}} tricked again, Ala Bahma uses a shotgun and <b>fires</b> at <b>Bugs.</b> However, Bugs appears from Ala Bahma's hat and places a cigar in his mouth, which promptly explodes.

5|$|Most Pokémon {{evolve into}} other forms when certain {{conditions}} are met, {{such as when}} they reach a certain level—levels range from 1 to 100—or have a certain item used on them. They can learn up to four moves, including attacking moves, healing moves, and moves that inflict status conditions on the opponent. They have six stats that affect battle performance: maximum HP (hit points), Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed. Attack and Special Attack are distinguished from Defense and Special Defense by the types of moves being considered: generally, moves involving physical exertion are physical, while moves involving supernatural or elemental powers are special. Moves are classed as one of seventeen types, (Normal, Water, Grass, <b>Fire,</b> Electric, Ghost, <b>Bug,</b> Fighting, Ice, Steel, Rock, Poison, Psychic, Dark, Dragon, Ground, and Flying); Pokémon can {{have one or two}} types. Generally, most of a Pokémon's moves correspond to its typing. A Pokémon's type makes it vulnerable or resistant to others; for example, Fire-type Pokémon are weak to Water-type moves, while Grass-type moves do little damage to them and Electric-type moves do normal damage.|$|R
5000|$|Sam catches Bugs {{again and}} throws {{him into the}} pot, {{lighting}} the <b>fire</b> again. However, <b>Bugs</b> tries {{to point out that}} a tidal wave is heading for the island, but Sam told him to [...] "Shuddup, and start simmerin!!!". Before Sam can do anything, the tidal wave sweeps across the island, leaving Bugs safe in his pot, but the island is gone, because it got swallowed by the waves. Sam, now being chased by Dopey Dick, swims to the pot, yelling for Bugs to pull him in. Bugs uses a pike pole to start pulling Sam in, but then tells Sam that hell only keep him up if they make a deal. After a quick [...] "No deals!", Sam eventually relents. The deal is that Bugs will keep Sam {{on the end of the}} pole to keep Sam above water, while Sam paddles. Sam looks back and sees the shark behind them and starts paddling faster, eventually going in the direction of San Francisco - which, according to a floating marker, is 2,736 miles away, with [...] "California, Here I Come" [...] playing in the underscore.|$|R
50|$|With {{the injury}} to Durant, Kevin Glenn became the {{starting}} quarterback, fulfilling the purpose {{for which he}} was signed by Saskatchewan. Days later, Chris Milo was released by the Roughriders, and they brought in veteran Paul McCallum as starting kicker. McCallum first game back with the Green and White was on July 5, 2015, a 42-40 overtime loss to the Toronto Argonauts. Weeks later, the Roughriders still didn't have a win in the 2015 season, raising concern on whether head coach Corey Chamblin would eventually be <b>fired.</b> The injury <b>bug</b> around Saskatchewan got worse as quarterback Kevin Glenn, receiver Chris Getzlaf, linebacker Weldon Brown, and receiver Taj Smith were lost to injury. This eventually led to rookie quarterback Brett Smith getting a shot as the starter. During the August 30, 2015 game against the Ottawa Redblacks, head coach Corey Chamblin made the decision to bench Smith in favour of Tino Sunseri following an interception, which disgusted many Roughrider fans. Following another disappointing loss to Ottawa and a record of 0-9 {{for the first half of}} the season, head coach Corey Chamblin and general manager Brendan Taman were fired on September 1, 2015. Special teams coordinator Bob Dyce was appointed interim head coach and assistant general manager Jeremy O'Day was appointed interim general manager.|$|R
