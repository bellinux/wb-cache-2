500|$|From 1990 until 1993, Scott {{worked at}} WESH, an NBC {{affiliate}} in Orlando, Florida {{as a sports}} reporter and sports anchor. While at WESH, he met ESPN producer Gus Ramsey, who was beginning his own career. Ramsey said of Scott: [...] "You knew the second he {{walked in the door}} that it was a pit stop, and that he was gonna be this big star somewhere someday. <b>He</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> did a piece on the rodeo, and he nailed it just like he would nail the NBA Finals for ESPN." [...] He earned first place honors from the Central Florida Press Club for a feature on rodeo.|$|E
500|$|Holloway {{highlighted}} Michael's {{review of}} Angela, wherein {{he tells her}} [...] "You're adequate", as the best line in the episode. TV Fanatic reviewed several of the quotes for the episode. The site ranked Angela's monologue about how much she loves being judged, as well as Jim's revelation that Dwight thinks a Thursday is really a Friday, a four out of five. TV Fanatic awarded the conversation between Stanley and Michael—wherein Stanley tells Michael how to properly listen for subtext in a voicemail—as well as Dwight's frustration that <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> got drunk with his laser tag team, a five out of five. Wilson later claimed that Dwight's line about laser tag caused [...] "quite a buzz" [...] online.|$|E

500|$|Steve Kloves was {{selected}} to write the screenplay. He described adapting the book as [...] "tough", as it did not [...] "lend itself to adaptation {{as well as the}} next two books." [...] Kloves often received synopses of books proposed as film adaptations from Warner Bros., which he [...] "almost never read", but Harry Potter jumped out at him. <b>He</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> bought the book, and became an instant fan of the series. When speaking to Warner Bros., he stated that the film had to be British, and had to be true to the characters. Kloves was nervous when he first met Rowling as he did not want her to think he was going to [...] " [...] her baby." [...] Rowling admitted that she [...] "was really ready to hate this Steve Kloves," [...] but recalled her initial meeting with him: [...] "The first time I met him, he said to me, 'You know who my favourite character is?' And I thought, You're gonna say Ron. I know you're gonna say Ron. But he said 'Hermione.' And I just kind of melted." [...] Rowling received a large amount of creative control, an arrangement that Columbus did not mind.|$|E
500|$|During the off-season, the Capitals {{made several}} player changes. One {{of the players}} that was not {{retained}} by the team, Matt Bradley, started a controversy with his comments from a radio interview in Ottawa. In the interview, Bradley said his former team was [...] "a little bit too nonchalant and guys weren’t disciplined the way they should have been," [...] which he claimed were the two biggest reasons why the team {{was not able to}} advance past {{the second round of the}} Stanley Cup playoffs. He later stated that Head Coach Bruce Boudreau did not give the most ice time to players who were playing well, but went with his star players. He further noted that Boudreau was a [...] "great coach" [...] who had been put in a tough position. When asked to point out examples, Bradley stated that Alexander Semin [...] "could easily be the best player in the league," [...] but he [...] "just doesn’t care," [...] further noting, [...] "When you've got a guy like that, you need him to be your best player, or one of your best players, and when he doesn't show up, you almost get the sense that he wants to be back in Russia." [...] Semin's agent came to his client's defense, stating he [...] "always cares." [...] Teammate Mike Knuble noted that because Semin speaks limited English, the language barrier affects the way that he is perceived, further noting that the interview comments were something Bradley regretted. When asked about the comments, former Capitals forward David Steckel stated that, [...] "It's not like <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> told lies." [...] Bradley later apologized for his comments in an interview with the Sun Sentinel.|$|E
2500|$|He {{announced}} {{before the}} 2007 Cricket World Cup {{that this would}} be his last appearance in One Day Internationals. After his last match, in the post-game presentation interview, he asked the fans, [...] "Did I entertain?", to which he received a resounding cheer from the crowd, after which <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> took his 'lap of honour' where he met and shook hands with many of the fans. Lara stated this would be his last appearance in international cricket, he has also indicated his interest in retaining some involvement in the sport.|$|E

2500|$|Steve Kloves was {{selected}} to write the screenplay for the first film. He described adapting the book as [...] "tough" [...] since it did not [...] "lend itself to adaptation {{as well as the}} next two books". Kloves was sent a [...] "raft" [...] of synopses of books proposed as film adaptations, with Harry Potter being the only one that jumped out at him. <b>He</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> bought the book, becoming an instant fan. When speaking to Warner Bros. he stated that the film had to be British and true to the characters. David Heyman was confirmed to produce the film.

2500|$|Patrick Fitzgerald, {{the federal}} prosecutor, noted, [...] "Mr. Ryan steered {{contracts}} worth {{millions of dollars}} to friends and took payments and vacations in return. When he was a sitting governor, he lied to the FBI about this conduct and then <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> did it again." [...] He charged {{that one of the most}} egregious aspects of the corruption was Ryan's action after learning that bribes were being paid for licenses. Instead of ending the practice he tried to end the investigation that had uncovered it, Fitzgerald said, calling the moment [...] "a low-water mark for public service." [...] Ryan became one of four Illinois governors since 1968 to be convicted of white-collar crimes, following Otto Kerner, Jr. and Dan Walker and followed by Rod Blagojevich.|$|E
2500|$|Cowdrey {{is remembered}} for two {{victories}} in particular. The first {{was against the}} West Indies at Port of Spain in 1967–68 when Gary Sobers made a surprise declaration and set England 215 runs to win in 165 minutes. Although he needed Ken Barrington and other players to overcome their natural inclination to safety (England had collapsed to 68/8 in the Second Test) <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> hit 71 runs in 75 minutes for a 7 wicket victory with three minutes left. It {{was the last time}} England beat the West Indies in a series for 32 years. The second was in 1968 when Australia were 85/5 needing 352 to win when a deluge flooded the Oval and the players started packing their bags. Cowdrey called on the crowd to help the staff dry the ground and [...] "like a modern-day King Canute he rolled up his trousers, waded into the water...and supervised the mopping up operations of hundreds of volunteers". Derek Underwood took 7/50 and England won with 226 runs and six minutes to spare.|$|E

2500|$|In 1480 the Vespucci family {{commissioned}} a fresco figure of Saint Augustine for the Ognissanti, their parish church, and Botticelli's. [...] Someone else, probably the order running the church, commissioned Domenico Ghirlandaio to do a facing Saint Jerome; both saints were shown writing in their studies, which are crowded with objects. [...] As in other cases, such direct competition [...] "was always an inducement to Botticelli {{to put out}} all his powers", and the fresco, now his earliest to survive, is regarded as his finest by Hebert Lighbown. [...] The open book above the saint contains one of the practical jokes for which Vasari says he was known. [...] Most of the [...] "text" [...] is scribbles, but one line reads: [...] "Where is Brother Martino? <b>He</b> <b>went</b> <b>out.</b> <b>And</b> where did he go? He is outside Porta al Prato", probably dialogue overheard from [...] the Uumiliati, the order who ran the church. [...] Lightbown suggests that this shows Botticelli thought [...] "the example of Jerome and Augustine likely to be thrown away on the Umiliati as he knew them".|$|E
2500|$|According to Athanasius, Saint Anthony {{heard a voice}} {{telling him}} [...] "Go out and see." [...] <b>He</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> saw an angel who wore a girdle with a cross, one {{resembling}} the holy Eskiem (Tonsure or Schema), and on his head was a head cover (Kolansowa). He was sitting while braiding palm leaves, then he stood up to pray, and again he sat to weave. A voice came to him saying, [...] "Anthony, do this and you will rest." [...] Henceforth, he started to wear this tunic that he saw, and began to weave palm leaves, and never was bored again. Saint Anthony prophesied about the persecution {{that was about to}} happen to the church and the control of the heretics over it, the church victory and its return to its former glory, {{and the end of the}} age. When Saint Macarius visited Saint Anthony, Saint Anthony clothed him with the monk's garb, and foretold him what would be of him. When the day drew near of the departure of Saint Paul the First Hermit in the desert, Saint Anthony went to him and buried him, after clothing him in a tunic which was a present from St Athanasius the Apostolic, the 20th Patriarch of Alexandria.|$|E
2500|$|On September 19, 1968, Foley {{appeared}} in two Opry performances in Fort Wayne, Indiana, {{sponsored by the}} local Sheriff's Posse that included Billy Walker and 19-year-old Hank Williams, Jr., son of his long-time friend Hank Williams. Before the second show, according to Walker, Foley came to his dressing room and Walker shared his faith in Christ: Foley said, [...] "Do you think God could ever forgive a sinner like me?" [...] He began to tell me all the rotten things he had done in his life, and I {{looked him in the}} face and said, [...] "Red, if God can forgive me, He can forgive you." [...] I prayed with Red. [...] <b>He</b> <b>went</b> <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> the last song he sang was [...] "Peace in the Valley." [...] He came over to side of the stage and said, 'Billy, I've never sung that song and feel the way I do tonight.' Foley suffered respiratory failure that night and died in his sleep, prompting Hank Williams, Jr. to write and record (as Luke the Drifter, Jr.) I Was With Red Foley (The Night He Passed Away). [...] According to the song, which charted that November, his last words were, [...] "I'm awful tired now, Hank. [...] I've got to go to bed." [...] Foley had sung [...] "Peace in the Valley" [...] at Hank Sr.'s funeral. [...] Foley was interred in Woodlawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Nashville.|$|E

2500|$|Vera Elizabeth Claythorne, a cool, efficient, {{resourceful}} {{young woman}} who is on leave from her position as a sports mistress at a third-rate girls' school. She has largely worked at secretarial jobs ever since {{her job as a}} governess was ended by the death of her charge, Cyril Hamilton, whom she intentionally allowed to swim out to sea – as the child had wanted to do, but had theretofore been denied as too dangerous – and drowned. She did this so her lover, Cyril's uncle, Hugo Hamilton, could become the family heir, inherit the estate and marry her, which had been their original plan before Cyril's birth changed things. She swam out to sea to [...] "save" [...] Cyril to make it seem he had disobeyed her – as she had consistently told him it was too dangerous – but knowing she would not arrive in time. Her plan backfired when Hugo, who loved his nephew, abandoned her after he somehow sensed what she had done. Hugo, ironically, did become the heir but has become a miserable drunkard. On a fateful transatlantic journey, he met Wargrave and, inebriated, told the judge, [...] "I've known a murderess – known her, I tell you [...] ... Women are fiends – absolute fiends – you wouldn't think a girl like that – a nice straight jolly girl – you wouldn't think she'd do that, would you? That she'd take a kid out to sea and let it drown – you wouldn't think a woman could do a thing like that?"Wargrave was able to trace Vera with this information, and lure her to the island. In the penultimate scene of the novel, she manages to take Lombard's gun, and shoot him dead in what she believed was self-defence. She returns to the house, relieved she has survived. When she goes to her room, she finds a readied noose, complete with chair beneath it, suspended from a hook hanging from the ceiling. She, in what Wargrave, [...] hidden from her sight, describes first hand as a post-traumatic state, sees and hears Hugo, her former lover, encouraging her. She adjusts the noose round her neck and kicks the chair away, fulfilling the rhyme's final verse ("One little Soldier Boy left all alone; <b>He</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> hanged himself and then there were none.") ...|$|E
