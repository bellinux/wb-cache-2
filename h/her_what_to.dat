Charles {{seems to be a}} husband who dislikes his wife and is {{constantly}} told by <b>her</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do, so he is surprised to see that Marge is understanding and kind. As Marge enjoys her time with Charles, he begins to develop an infatuation for her. Meanwhile, Homer, Bart, and Lisa are having major troubles with Verity, who disciplines them and objects to everything they do.|$|E
25|$|When {{the second}} superhero Civil War began, Pietro came to ask Wanda for help, but Wanda refused, because she and Pietro {{disagreed}} on which side was right - Pietro not liking {{the idea of}} profiling people {{based on what they}} might do and Wanda feeling that thinking about the future would have prevented many of their more dangerous mistakes in the past - past precedent made Wanda feel that introducing her powers to a conflict of this nature could be more dangerous than the existing situation, and she resented Pietro still trying to tell <b>her</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do as though she was a child, bluntly informing him that his refusal to learn from his mistakes marked him as a sociopath. He has also been revealed to have fallen under the telepathic control of the Red Skull, acting as a 'sleeper agent' in the Avengers as part of the Skull's current campaign.|$|E
500|$|Critic Robert Christgau also {{considered}} [...] "Overprotected" [...] and [...] "Cinderella" [...] as {{the highlights of}} Britney, while saying, [...] "hardly the first not-terribly-bright teenager to approach self-knowledge via the words of others". Nikki Tranker of PopMatters said the song [...] "is an absolute belter reminiscent of Britney’s previous big-bang singles, 'Oops! I Did It Again' and 'You Drive Me Crazy' [...] ", while commenting that Spears [...] "sings about ridding herself of the girlie chains around her, gripes about her need for space in the whirlwind that is her life, and lets us know she don’t need nobody telling <b>her</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do." [...] In 2003, the song received a Grammy nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.|$|E

2500|$|Marina Oswald {{testified that}} her husband {{told her that he}} {{traveled}} by bus to General Walker's house and shot at Walker with his rifle. She said that Oswald considered Walker to be the leader of a [...] "fascist organization."

2500|$|In 2007, The BBC {{misrepresented}} Leibovitz's portrait {{shooting of}} Queen Elizabeth II, {{to take the}} Queen's official picture for her state visit to Virginia. This was filmed for the BBC documentary A Year with the Queen. A promotional trailer for the film showed the Queen reacting angrily to Leibovitz's suggestion ("less dressy") that she remove her tiara, then a scene of the Queen walking down a corridor, telling an aide [...] "I'm not changing anything. I've had enough dressing like this, thank you very much." [...] The BBC later apologized and admitted that {{the sequence of events}} had been misrepresented, as the Queen was in fact walking to the sitting in the second scene. This led to a BBC scandal and a shake-up of ethics training. However a 2015 London Times article published just ahead of the Queen's reign exceeding that of Queen Victoria contradicts this story. It stated that the Queen was both incredulous at being asked to remove her crown as [...] "no-one tells <b>her</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do" [...] and insulted as the item was only a tiara.|$|E
2500|$|Franklin {{was awarded}} a {{research}} fellowship at Newnham College, with which she joined the physical chemistry laboratory of the University of Cambridge to work under Ronald Norrish, who later won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. In her one year of work there, {{she did not have}} much success. As described by his biographer, Norrish was [...] "obstinate and almost perverse in argument, overbearing and sensitive to criticism". He could not decide for <b>her</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> work upon, and at that time was succumbing to heavy drinking. Franklin wrote that he made her despise him completely. Resigning from Norrish's Lab, she fulfilled the requirements of the National Service Acts by working as an assistant research officer at the British Coal Utilisation Research Association (BCURA) in 1942. The BCURA was located on the Coombe Springs Estate near Kingston upon Thames near the southwestern boundary of London. Norrish acted as advisor to the military at BCURA. John G. Bennett was the director. Marcello Pirani and Victor Goldschmidt, both refugees from the Nazis, were consultants and lectured at BCURA while Franklin worked there. During her BCURA research, she stayed at Adrienne Weill's boarding house in Cambridge until her cousin Irene Franklin asked to join her in a vacated house of her uncle in Putney. With Irene, she volunteered as an Air Raid Warden and regularly made patrols to see the welfare of people during air raids.|$|E
