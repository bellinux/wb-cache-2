40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} {{contribution}} of learning networks to the capability building process of small firms. It relies {{on the concept of}} absorptive capacity and the recent advances in its understanding, specifically the distinction between a potential absorptive capacity and a realised absorptive capacity. The paper calls for differentiating between the <b>de</b> facto absorptive <b>capacity,</b> which is taken by firms usually without the consent of the other party and the <b>de</b> jure absorptive <b>capacity</b> which is taking place in the context of ‘rightful’ arrangements between different firms such as strategic alliances, clusters or learning networks. Relying on the qualitative investigation of two fully-fledged learning networks in Ireland, the paper identifies the factors which can {{have an impact on the}} <b>de</b> jure absorptive <b>capacity</b> at least in small firms. The individual in the interface between the firm and the network, the degree of alignment with the network resources allocation process, the participation to network ground activities and the ‘no fear to fail’ culture in the organisation of the receiving firm have proved to be critical in regulating the <b>de</b> jure absorptive <b>capacity.</b> The paper calls for a better understanding of the <b>de</b> jure absorptive <b>capacity,</b> which can have profound implications for both organisational behaviour and policy-making...|$|R

40|$|A local {{government}} can use innovative governance practices {{to expand its}} jurisdictional capacity, thereby promoting local economic development. There are, however, legal and institutional impediments to the exercise of such innovative economic development policy. Using the subnational jurisdiction of Shetland as a case study, this paper considers how {{local government}} innovation can be a key driver of economic development. Local government innovation can nevertheless become subject to legal challenges by authorities in the higher-level jurisdictions (Scotland, the United Kingdom, and the European Union {{in the case of}} Shetland). Community concerns related to standards of good governance can compound these difficulties, resulting in a significant decrease in democratic accountability and a weakening of the local government’s <b>de</b> facto <b>capacity</b> to plan and implement policy. Before local governments can make the most of multilevel governance, local communities and high-lever jurisdictions must re-assess standards of legitimacy for local government functions and structures...|$|R
