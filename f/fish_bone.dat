25|$|Shooting {{began in}} August 1959 and lasted until January 15, 1960. Antonioni began filming the island {{sequence}} with the scenes immediately after Anna disappears. The majority of shooting {{on the island}} was filmed on the island Lisca Bianca (white <b>fish</b> <b>bone)</b> with a cast and crew of 50 people. Other locations for the island sequence included Panarea (which was also the production's headquarters), Mondello and Palermo. Filming the island sequence was intended to take three weeks, but ended up lasting for four months. Difficulties included the islands being infested with rats, mosquitoes and reptiles; also, the weather was unexpectedly cold, and the Navy ship hired to transport {{the cast and crew}} to the island every day never appeared. In order to carry personal items and equipment to the island, the crew had to personally build small rafts out of empty gas canisters and wooden planks; these were towed by a launching tug every morning.|$|E

The {{coastline}} of Skye {{is a series}} of peninsulas and bays radiating out from a centre dominated by the Cuillin hills (Gaelic: [...] ).

500|$|According to oral tradition, scribes used {{obsidian}} flakes {{or small}} shark teeth, presumably the hafted tools still used to carve wood in Polynesia, to flute and polish the tablets {{and then to}} incise the glyphs. The glyphs are most commonly composed of deep smooth cuts, though superficial hair-line cuts are also found. In the closeup image at right, a glyph is composed of two parts connected by [...] a hair-line cut; this is a typical convention for this shape. Several researchers, including Barthel, believe that these superficial cuts were made by obsidian, and that the texts were carved in a two-stage process, first sketched with obsidian and then deepened and finished with a worn shark tooth. The remaining hair-line cuts were then either errors, design conventions (as at right), or decorative embellishments. Vertical strings of chevrons or lozenges, for example, are typically connected with hair-line cuts, {{as can be seen}} repeatedly in the closeup of one end of tablet B below. However, Barthel was told that the last literate Rapanui king, Nga‘ara, sketched out the glyphs in soot applied with a <b>fish</b> <b>bone</b> and then engraved them with a shark tooth.|$|E

As soon as you have set them to work, you will examine the state of the arms, see how many more are needed to complete the list, and then send off to Sir Ralph, who will furnish as many as are required: the fishermen have brought their own weapons.
