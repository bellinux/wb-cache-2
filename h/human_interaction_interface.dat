40|$|We have {{developed}} a low-cost automated assistant to help patients perform rehabilitative physical therapy (PT) at home, reducing the need for expensive one-on-one sessions with physical therapists and limiting the need for frequent travel to and from therapy sessions – a boon for the many patients with limited mobility due to strokes and major muscular and skeletal problems. The core component {{of the system is}} a Kinect camera which efficiently tracks full body human motion in real-time. Combining color and depth information, our tracking algorithm performs more accurate and robust than other methods. The PT assistant sends a summary of the completed exercise session to the attending physical therapist, allowing the therapist to support a larger case load while still providing traditional one-on-one physical therapy sessions in the clinic whenever needed. The assistant provides instructions on how to do the exercise, analyzes the video feed, and gives continual feedback on the patient’s performance. Computer <b>human</b> <b>interaction</b> <b>interface</b> allows the system to deliver the guidance for the movement of patient effectively and corrects incorrect movement in real-time. The assistant can be bundled with video chat facilities to allow the therapist to observe the session remotely. If desired, portions of the session can be recorded and sent to the therapist after the session...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{user interface}} and visualization {{components in the}} problem solving environment “Site-Specific System Simulator for Wireless System Design ” (S 4 W) developed by CS and ECE faculty and students at Virginia Tech. S 4 W integrates visualization and computational tools {{with a high level}} user interface. The objective of this PSE is to improve the ability of wireless design engineers to design an indoor wireless system through the aid of various simulation and visualization components. S 4 W provides engineers with the facility of thinking in terms of the overall task of designing the system for optimal performance. They need not to worry about computation, data-management and connectivity issues. The choice of method for interaction between service logic within a PSE and its user is always a challenging issue. The selection of user interaction channel is mostly dictated by the characteristics of the problem domain. For S 4 W, we chose to build a graphical user interface as <b>human</b> <b>interaction</b> <b>interface,</b> which was connected to other components via a high speed Local Area Network (LAN). The other key form of user interaction in a PSE is the visual representations of the abstract data results of simulations, perceived as user interface for data. The Complex nature of data sets in the domain of wireless simulations calls for a customized set of visualization tools. To address the specific needs of visualizations for S 4 W, ad hoc visualization tools were developed and integrated into the graphical user interface. A comparison of the integrated PSE and an earlier collection of unintegrated tools and scripts is presented...|$|E
30|$|Extracting tags {{from social}} media-sharing {{websites}} {{can be considered}} as extracting data from structured or semistructured websites. Research about extracting data from structured websites include RoadRunner [13, 14], which takes one HTML page as the initial wrapper, and uses Union-Free Regular Expression (UFRE) method to generalize the wrapper under mismatch. The authors in [15] developed the EXALG extracting system, which is mainly based on extracting Large and Frequently occurring EQuivalence classes (LFEQs) and differentiating roles of tokens using dtokens to deduce the template and extract data values. Later in [16], a tree similarity matching method was proposed to extract web data, where a tree edit distance method and a Partial Tree Alignment mechanism were used for aligning tags in the HTML tag tree. Research in extracting web record data has widely used a web page's structure [17] and a web page's visual perception patterns. In [18], several filter rules were proposed to extract content based on a DOM-tree. A <b>human</b> <b>interaction</b> <b>interface</b> was developed through which users were able to customize which type of DOM-nodes are to be filtered. While their target was for general HTML content and not for web records, they did not suit their methods to structured data record extraction. Zhao et al. [19] proposed using the tag tree structure and visual perception pattern to extract data from search engine results. They used several heuristics to model the visual display pattern that a search engine results page would usually look like, and combined this with the tag path. Compared with their tag path method, our path string approach keeps track of all the parent-child relationships of the DOM nodes in addition to keeping the parent-first-child-next-sibling pattern originally used in the DOM tree. We also include the node property in the path string generation process.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAs we {{move forward}} to {{integrate}} system descriptive models and system analytical models, there is a key opportunity to integrate other viewpoints into the system model. Specifically, {{we have the opportunity}} to extend current modeling semantics and add other disciplines. Current systems engineering practices address human-system integration concerns as an afterthought (i. e., after system architectures have already been created). One primary reason for this deficiency is that people not trained in human factors engineering are unable to communicate with those that are, due to differences in terminology. To better integrate humans into and with systems, new semantics are needed to extend current system modeling representations. The integration of new semantics will allow human elements to be analyzed in a more holistic perspective. This paper looks into identifying core building blocks for creating the ontology for <b>human</b> system <b>interaction,</b> <b>interfaces,</b> and integration. This ontology, once fully developed, will extend current system modeling capabilities that will enable the human element to be analyzed as part of the overall system development process...|$|R
