500|$|A {{second round}} of Judiciary Committee {{hearings}} were also taking place on January 21, and by then, Baird was politically isolated, with no major groups coming to her defense. [...] A growing number of senators came out in opposition to Baird during the day, including two Republican members of the Judiciary Committee and influential centrist Democrats John Breaux of Louisiana and David Boren of Oklahoma. [...] Baird gamely continued to smile and testify well into the evening, but as Stephanopoulos later wrote, [...] "She didn't <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>yet,</b> but she was toast." [...] Biden called Clinton and told him the nomination was lost.|$|E
500|$|... 1st Lt. Richard Abbot {{flying a}} FAC O-2 {{had been shot}} down {{offshore}} shortly before Hambleton, and when Abbot {{was picked up by}} the USS Hamner, two Air Force search and rescue Douglas A-1 Skyraiders (Capt. Don Morse in Sandy 07 and his wingman in Sandy 08) from the 1st Special Operations Squadron remained in Hambleton's vicinity. The Sandys immediately scrambled to cover Hambleton's position. When Morse in Sandy 07 first got the call, he thought that, because the aircraft had gone down in South Vietnam, the SAR effort could be accomplished fairly quickly. When he got over Hambelton's position, he was shocked at the amount of ground fire he received. It was more intense than anything he had seen in the war. Some pilots reported that the intensity of the antiaircraft fire was equal to that around Hanoi. Although the U.S. and ARVN forces did not <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>yet,</b> the offensive was the largest combined arms attack conducted by the North Vietnamese during the war.|$|E
2500|$|Thom Jurek {{wrote about}} him after his death, [...] "Willy DeVille is America's loss even if America doesn’t <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>yet.</b> The reason is simple: Like {{the very best}} rock and roll writers and {{performers}} in our history, he’s {{one of the very}} few who got it right; he understood what made a three-minute song great, and why it matteredbecause it mattered to him. He lived and died with the audience in his shows, and he gave them something to remember when they left the theater, because he meant every single word of every song as he performed it. Europeans like that. In this jingoistic age of American pride, perhaps we can revisit our own true love of rock and roll by discovering Willy DeVille for the first timeor, at the very least, remember him for what he really was: an American original. The mythos and pathos in his songs, his voice, and his performances were born in these streets and cities and then given to the world who appreciated him much more than we did." ...|$|E
