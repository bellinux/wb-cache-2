50|$|The {{need for}} social {{integrity}} is {{emphasized in the}} role <b>function</b> <b>mode.</b> When human beings adapt to various role changes that occur throughout a lifetime, they are adapting in this mode. According to Hanson (1984), the family’s role can be assessed by observing the communication patterns in the family. Assessment should include how decisions are reached, the roles and communication patterns of the members, how role changes are tolerated, {{and the effectiveness of}} communication (Hanson, 1984). For example, when a couple adjusts their lifestyle appropriately following retirement from full-time employment, they are adapting in this mode.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the {{proposition}} of a prognostic approach that enables {{to face up to}} the problem of lack of information and missing prior knowledge. Developments rely on the assumption that real data can be gathered from the system (online). The approach consists in three phases. An information theory-based criterion is first used to isolate the most useful observations with regards to the <b>functioning</b> <b>modes</b> of the system (feature selection step). An evolving neuro-fuzzy system is then used for online prediction of observations at any horizons (prediction step). The predicted observations are classified into the possible <b>functioning</b> <b>modes</b> using an evidential Markovian classifier based on Dempster-Shafer theory (classification step). The whole is illustrated on a problem concerning the prediction of an engine health.

40|$|AbstractThis article {{presents}} a {{plastic injection moulding}} monitoring module based on knowledge built on-line using feedback from production data. A fuzzy classifier was especially developed for this application. It is based on unsupervised and supervised classification methods. The role of {{the first one is}} to identify the <b>functioning</b> <b>modes</b> of the process whereas the role of the second one is to associate the state of the process to one of the identified <b>functioning</b> <b>modes</b> at the moment where a workpiece is injected. Furthermore this diagnosis module integrates an on-line learning method which allows to enrich and upgrade the initial knowledge during production. The results obtained show that the monitoring system is a solution for quality and productivity control having serious economical advantages. For example maintenance tasks can be anticipated {{and the size of the}} training set can be considerably reduced. The computing times show that the monitoring system can be used for the purpose of industrial applications without any decrease of production rate...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} solve the problem of feature {{extraction}} of underwater acoustic signals in complex ocean environment, a new method for feature extraction from ship-radiated noise is presented based on empirical mode decomposition theory and permutation entropy. It analyzes the separability for permutation entropies of the intrinsic <b>mode</b> <b>functions</b> of three types of ship-radiated noise signals, and discusses the permutation entropy of the intrinsic <b>mode</b> <b>function</b> with the highest energy. In this study, ship-radiated noise signals measured from three types of ships are decomposed into a set of intrinsic <b>mode</b> <b>functions</b> with empirical <b>mode</b> decomposition method. Then, the permutation entropies of all intrinsic <b>mode</b> <b>functions</b> are calculated with appropriate parameters. The permutation entropies are obviously different in the intrinsic <b>mode</b> <b>functions</b> with the highest energy, thus, the permutation entropy of the intrinsic <b>mode</b> <b>function</b> with the highest energy is regarded as a new characteristic parameter to extract the feature of ship-radiated noise. After that, the characteristic parameters—namely, the energy difference between high and low frequency, permutation entropy, and multi-scale permutation entropy—are compared with the permutation entropy of the intrinsic <b>mode</b> <b>function</b> with the highest energy. It is discovered that the four characteristic parameters are at the same level for similar ships, however, there are differences in the parameters for different types of ships. The results demonstrate that the permutation entropy of the intrinsic <b>mode</b> <b>function</b> with the highest energy is better in separability as the characteristic parameter than the other three parameters by comparing their fluctuation ranges and the average values of the four characteristic parameters. Hence, the feature of ship-radiated noise can be extracted efficiently with the method...|$|R
