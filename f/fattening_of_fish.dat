40|$|The {{formation}} of juvenile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus in cages in subtropical reservoirs {{is an alternative}} to optimize the annual rearing cycles. The {{aim of this study}} was to propose a production protocol for juvenile tilapia O. niloticus reared in cages in a reservoir of a hydroelectric dam on the Iguaçu river during winter - spring. The experimental period was from April to October 2013, and 150, 000 fingerlings were used with an average weight of 3. 0 ± 0. 5 g, distributed in 8 cages with volume of 27 m³. The water temperature was 21. 1 ± 1. 8 ° C. Sampling was done every 15 days to calculate and adjust the amount of feed offered to the animals. The diets were offered: mash diet with 45 % crude protein (CP), then extruded diet with 38 % CP (2 mm) and diet with 32 % CP (3 mm). The survival of juveniles was 76. 42 ± 7. 2 %. The final mean weight was 142. 37 ± 12. 6 g, and the cost per kg of fish was R$ 4. 54 reais. The proposed protocol optimizes the aquaculture production of tilapia in the reservoir, indicating the period from May to October for training of youth and the period from November to April for <b>fattening</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> in order to reduce the negative impacts caused by seasonal temperature reduction water...|$|E

A total of 6, 757 wild and fattened bluefin tuna were measured as straight-line fork length and 49, 962 were weighted. Average value of K for wild BFT was 1. 59 and respectively 2. 43, 2. 32, 2. 15, 1. 61, 1. 79 and 1. 90 for Fattened BFT after 5 - 6 months from 2005 to 2010. Length frequency <b>of</b> <b>fattened</b> bluefin showed clearly {{a substantial increase in}} juvenile rate. The percentage which was 21. 4 % in 2005 reached 31. 3 % in 2009. For weight distribution, 73. 3 % <b>of</b> the <b>fish</b> caught in 2001 are below the annual mean (75. 7 kg), while means 71 to 72 % <b>of</b> <b>fattened</b> <b>fish</b> were under annual mean weight. Year 2009 is exceptional because only 57 % <b>of</b> <b>fattened</b> <b>fish</b> were under the mean weight. This demonstrates that the fish caught are becoming increasingly small.

40|$|Abstract: Although sheep {{breeding}} {{in our country}} mainly had extensive character, there is still room for implementation of the new concept of expression of nutritional value of proteins, primarily in <b>fattening</b> <b>of</b> lambs. For the purpose of maximum use of the genetic potential of high-yielding meat/fattening sheep breeds, share of undegradable protein in diet {{must be taken into}} consideration, since high protein requirements of such animals cannot be satisfied by microbial protein synthesis from usual protein and energy sources. Therefore, in contemporary, science based systems for assessment of protein value of feeds, degradability of proteins from food in rumen plays major role. In absence of data in domestic literature related to undegradability of proteins in certain feeds, results obtained in this study should be perceived as direction for future norming <b>of</b> diets in <b>fattening</b> <b>of</b> lambs in the intensive rearing system...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine the impact of sowing {{structure}} on family farm competiveness using the model of family farm directed at the final production <b>of</b> <b>fattened</b> beef cattle in the conditions of unchanged estate size. Applying a partial budget analysis, it was examined whether the decision on buying alfalfa hay or mercantile maize on the market and changing the sowing structure was economically justified and under what conditions using additional procedure of sensitive analysis. Applying this approach, it was investigated to what extent that decision contributed to improving the family farm profitability. The results of the conducted research show that the decision on buying mercantile maize mainly contributes to improving competitiveness of family farms directed at the final production <b>of</b> <b>fattened</b> beef cattle compared with the decision on buying alfalfa hay. It is the consequence of the fact that buying mercantile maize on the market will enable sowing structure changes, that is, buying mercantile maize will make the area free, which according to some conservative estimations, can be used for the production of sufficient amounts of alfalfa and silage maize for <b>fattening</b> <b>of</b> additional 19 head, whereas buying alfalfa hay will make the area free, which can be used for production of sufficient amounts of mercantile and silage maize for <b>fattening</b> <b>of</b> additional 6 head.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to compare productivity traits of two pig genotypes fattened in two different ways, on deep litter and in a conventional way (flat deck), and to determine whether there was microclimatic influence on the productivity traits <b>of</b> <b>fattening</b> pigs. The research was carried out on 57 <b>fattening</b> pigs <b>of</b> both sex, divided into two groups by their housing. Each group consisted of pigs of two genotypes, i. e. three-way crossbreeds of Large White and German Landrace (LW x GL) in the dam line, and of German Landrace and 8 Pietrain (P) in the sire line. Pigs were fed ad libitum with isocaloric and isoprotein diets. During the whole experiment, temperature, air moisture, air circulation speed and the content of NH 3 and CO 2 were measured in pens. No statistically significant differences were recorded with respect to temperature, air moisture, air circulation speed and content of carbon dioxide (CO 2) and ammonia (NH 3) in the air in pens with deep litter and without it (P> 0. 05). Pigs housed without deep litter had statistically highly significant (P< 0. 01) higher final weights than pigs kept on deep litter. Pigs crossed with Pietrain as a terminal breed, kept in pens without deep litter, had statistically significantly higher (P< 0. 05) average daily gains than pigs of the same genotype kept on deep litter. In the finishing phase <b>of</b> <b>fattening,</b> group <b>of</b> pigs being kept in pens without deep litter had statistically higher average daily gains than pigs kept on deep litter (P< 0. 05).
