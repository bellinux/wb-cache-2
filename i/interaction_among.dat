5|$|Kulintang {{music was}} also crucial in {{relation}} to courtships due to {{the very nature of}} Islamic custom, which did not allow for unmarried men and women to intermingle. Traditionally, unmarried daughters were kept in a special chamber in the attic called a lamin, off-limit to visitors and suitors. It was only when she was allowed to play during kulintang performances that suitors were allowed to view her. Because of this, kulintang music was rare socially approved vehicles for <b>interaction</b> <b>among</b> the sexes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Stable {{neuronal}} assemblies {{are generally}} regarded as neural correlates of mental representations. Their temporal sequence corresponds {{to the experience of}} a direction of time, sometimes called the psychological time arrow. We show that the stability of particular, biophysically motivated models of neuronal assemblies, called coupled map lattices, is supported by causal <b>interactions</b> <b>among</b> neurons and obstructed by non-causal or anti-causal <b>interactions</b> <b>among</b> neurons. This surprising relation between causality and stability suggests that those neuronal assemblies that are stable due to causal neuronal interactions, and thus correlated with mental representations, generate a psychological time arrow. Yet this impact of causal <b>interactions</b> <b>among</b> neurons on the directed sequence of mental representations does not rule out the possibility of mentally less efficacious non-causal or anti-causal <b>interactions</b> <b>among</b> neurons. 1...|$|R

5|$|The {{spotted hyena}} {{is the most}} social of the Carnivora in that it has the largest group sizes and most complex social behaviours.

However, the social system of the spotted hyena is openly competitive rather than cooperative, with access to kills, mating opportunities and the time of dispersal for males depending on the ability to dominate other clan-members. Females provide only for their own cubs rather than assist each other, and males display no paternal care. Spotted hyena society is matriarchal; females are larger than males, and dominate them.|$|E

25|$|In general, {{facilitation}} is {{more likely}} to occur in physically stressful environments than in favorable environments, where competition {{may be the most important}} <b>interaction</b> <b>among</b> species. This can also occur in a single habitat containing a gradient from low to high stress. For example, along a New England, USA, salt marsh tidal gradient, a presence of black needle rush (Juncus gerardii) increased the fitness of marsh elder (Iva annua) shrubs in lower elevations, where soil salinity was higher. The rush shaded the soil, which decreased evapotranspiration, and in turn decreased soil salinity. However, at higher elevations where soil salinity was lower, marsh elder fitness was decreased in the presence of the rush, due to increased competition for resources. Thus, the nature of species interactions may shift with environmental conditions.|$|E
25|$|Pen-and-paper {{role-playing}} games typically {{involve a}} player called the gamemaster (or GM for short) who can dynamically create the story, setting, and rules, and {{react to a}} player's choices. In role-playing video games, the computer performs {{the function of the}} gamemaster. This offers the player a smaller set of possible actions, since computers can't engage in imaginative acting comparable to a skilled human gamemaster. In exchange, the typical role-playing video game may have storyline branches, user interfaces, and stylized cutscenes and gameplay to offer a more direct storytelling mechanism. Characterization of non-player characters in video games is often handled using a dialog tree. Saying the right things to the right non-player characters will elicit useful information for the player, and may even result in other rewards such as items or experience, as well as opening up possible storyline branches. Multiplayer online role-playing games can offer an exception to this contrast by allowing human <b>interaction</b> <b>among</b> multiple players and in some cases enabling a player to perform the role of a gamemaster.|$|E
