40|$|The dolphinfish, Coryphaena hippurus, is an oceanic {{epipelagic fish}} with {{economic}} importance to sport and commercial fisheries throughout its worldwide distribution in tropical and sub-tropical waters. In the eastern Caribbean, dolphinfish are generally piscivorous, eating {{a wide variety}} of fish species including small oceanic pelagic species (e. g. flyingfish, halfbeaks, man-o-war fish, sargassum and rough triggerfish), juveniles of large oceanic pelagic species (e. g. tunas, billfish, jacks, dolphinfish), and pelagic larvae of neritic, benthic species (e. g. flying gurnards, triggerfish, pufferfish, grunts). They also eat invertebrates (e. g. cephalopods, mysids, scyphozoans), suggesting that they are essentially non-selective foragers. This appears to be typical of dolphinfish from other locations and of tropical oceanic pelagic species in general. Post-larval flying gurnards and flyingfish rank as the most important prey species overall. However, the diet varies with season, and mysids are a very important component from October to December. Diet also varies slightly with predator size (small dolphinfish eat fewer flyingfish and more squid than larger sized dolphinfish), and with sex (males take proportionally more of the active, fast swimming species such as flyingfish, squid and dolphinfish than do females). From these results and {{a review of the literature}} to determine the diet of other tropical oceanic species and the predators of dolphinfish, it can be seen that predator-prey relationships and interspecies competition for food clearly involve other commercially important species. As such, interactions between the surface trolling <b>dolphinfish</b> <b>fisheries,</b> the surface gillnet flyingfish fisheries, and the subsurface longline tuna fisheries in the eastern Caribbean can be expected...|$|R
40|$|In {{this note}} we {{describe}} the <b>dolphinfish</b> (Coryphaena hippurus) <b>fishery</b> off Tunisian waters (central Mediterranean). Dolphinfish is fished from late August to early December, with the main catches in September-October, using fish aggregation devices and surrounding nets. A total of 260 boats are devoted to this fishery along the whole Tunisian coast, with an average annual catch of around 300 metric tonnes. The main fishing areas and ports are located on the central-eastern coast, which concentrates around 70 - 75 % of fishing effort and landings. Both the sesonality of the fishery and the length composition of the catches, with a clear increase in mean size during the fishing period (from 26. 0 cm fork length in August to 44 cm fork length in December), {{are similar to those}} reported in other Mediterranean areas...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{dolphinfish}} (Coryphaena hippurus) is {{a highly}} migratory pelagic species commercially exploited by industrial, artisanal and recreational fisheries in tropical and subtropical areas of the world’s oceans. Herein, we evaluated the <b>dolphinfish</b> industrial <b>fishery</b> in Pacific Panama {{for the first time}} generating a growth model and examining fluctuations in annual total catch and in catch per unit effort (CPUE) over a four-year period (2006 - 2009). Annual and monthly catch values and biological parameters of 14 913 individuals were obtained onboard industrial vessels, landing sites and records from processing plants. Size frequency for industrial ves-sels showed a normal distribution between 353 and 1 715 mm (average, 1 010. 85 mm; n = 10 459). Fish weight averaged 4. 94 kg (SD). Sex ratio was slightly biased toward females. More than 90 % of the analyzed fish were sexually mature. The length-weight relationship was positive and significant, reflecting allometric growth. Growth parameters using the von Bertalanffy equation revealed a growth efficiency of θ = 4. 61, which is within the reported range for Coryphaena hippurus (3. 95 - 4. 70). The largest fish were between age classes 2 and 3 (700 - 1 400 mm). Total catch per year and catch per unit effort (CPUE) per year fluctuated, with the highest values recorded between 2008 and 2009.

40|$|Dolphinfish are {{targeted}} throughout the Western Central Atlantic region by recreational fishers, small-scale artisanal fishers, and small longliners. They are also taken as by-catch on large-scale commercial longlines. Catches are highly seasonal and exhibit considerable interannual variability. According {{to the landing}} statistics provided by countries to FAO, dolphinfish ranked seventh overall in reported average annual landings of large pelagic fishes in the Western Central Atlantic from 1989 to 1993. Yellowfin tuna, Spanish mackerel, skipjack tuna, king mackerel, swordfish and Atlantic bonito ranked ahead of dolphinfish. There is a trend of increasing total annual landings from about 1, 700 mt in 1970 - 74 to about 2, 800 mt in 1989 - 1993. Landings are reported to FAO by only eight countries, whereas dolphinfish {{are known to be}} caught in most of the region´s 34 countries. By-catch on longlines and recreational landings are also largely unreported. Therefore, {{it is likely that the}} reported landings are a substantial underestimate. The relative importance of <b>dolphinfish</b> to pelagic <b>fisheries</b> varies from one part of the region to another. In the Lesser Antilles it is the most important large pelagic fish in terms of amounts landed. The absence of a large-scale commercial <b>fishery</b> targeting <b>dolphinfish</b> appears to have resulted in a lack of recognition of its contribution, particularly in developing countries of the region. Consequently, its biology and assessment have been neglected in relation to the attention given to other large pelagic fishes, mainly tunas and tuna-like fishes which have been the focus of ICCAT assessment activities...|$|R
40|$|The <b>dolphinfish</b> (Coryphaena hippurus) <b>fishery</b> {{based on}} the island of Majorca (western Mediterranean) and the {{population}} dynamics of the species were studied between 1995 and 1996. Fishing effort, landings and length composition of the catches during the sampling period, as well as the historic catch data series and fleet were analysed. Virtual Population Analysis (VPA), taking as the time unit the week in 1995 and the fortnight in 1996, were also carried out. Dolphinfish is fished from August to December, with main catches in September-October, using anchored fish aggregation devices (FADs) and surrounding net. The mooring areas, placed from 70 to 1200 m depth, are distributed among the boats registered for the year´s fishery. A total of 46 boats took part in this fishery in 1995 and 37 in 1996, with a catch of 128 and 52 metric tons respectively. These wide fluctuations are also shown in the annual catches of the 16 year series, which ranged from 2 to more than 120 metric tons, showing a slightly increasing trend (4 tons per year). The comparison of different measures of effort (FADs, days and hours) showed similar values of CPUE, although the number of FADs showed the lowest variation, with normal variances and average values not significantly different between harbours. The length composition of the catches ranged from 20 to 64 cm fork length, which corresponds to juveniles between 2 and 6 months of age. The main results of the VPA, which must be regarded in relative rather than absolute values, showed that the available population and the recruitment in 1995 are greater (around one order of magnitude) than in 1996. For both years, the number of individuals declined {{in the course of the}} fishing season, while biomass increased during the first 5 weeks. The fact that the exploited fraction of the dolphinfish population is composed of 0 -age class suggests that catch fluctuations might be related to environmental parameters and to the migratory behaviour pattern of the species.
