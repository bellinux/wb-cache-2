50|$|A vapor-liquid {{separator}} {{may also}} {{be referred to as}} a Flash Drum, Breakpot, Knock-out drum, <b>Knock-out</b> <b>pot,</b> Compressor suction drum or Compressor Inlet Drum. When used to remove suspended water droplets from streams of air, it is often called a demister.|$|E
40|$|This control {{decision}} {{addresses the}} <b>Knock-Out</b> <b>Pot</b> (KOP) Disposition KOP Processing System (KPS) conceptual design. The KPS functions to (1) retrieve KOP material from canisters, (2) remove particles less than 600 {micro}m {{in size and}} low density materials from the KOP material, (3) load the KOP material into Multi-Canister Overpack (MCO) baskets, and (4) stage the MCO baskets for subsequent loading into MCOs. Hazard and accident analyses of the KPS conceptual design have been performed to incorporate safety into the design process. The hazard analysis is documented in PRC-STP- 00098, <b>Knock-Out</b> <b>Pot</b> Disposition Project Conceptual Design Hazard Analysis. The accident analysis is documented in PRC-STP-CN-N- 00167, <b>Knock-Out</b> <b>Pot</b> Disposition Sub-Project Canister Over Lift Accident Analysis. Based {{on the results of}} these analyses, and analyses performed in support of MCO transportation and MCO processing and storage activities at the Cold Vacuum Drying Facility (CVDF) and Canister Storage Building (CSB), control decision meetings were held to determine the controls required to protect onsite and offsite receptors and facility workers. At the conceptual design stage, these controls are primarily defined by their safety functions. Safety significant structures, systems, and components (SSCs) that could provide the identified safety functions have been selected for the conceptual design. It is anticipated that some safety SSCs identified herein will be reclassified based on hazard and accident analyses performed in support of preliminary and detailed design...|$|E
