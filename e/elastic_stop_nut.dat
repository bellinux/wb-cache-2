40|$|In {{this paper}} the steady state {{behaviour}} of a beam {{system with a}} periodically moving support and an <b>elastic</b> <b>stop</b> is analysed both numerically and experimentally. In the numerical analysis a continuous model for the <b>elastic</b> <b>stop</b> is used based on the contact force law of Hertz. The beam is modelled using finite elements and subsequently reduced using a component mode synthesis leading to a non-linear six-degree-of-freedom model. The steady state behaviour of this model is investigated by calculating periodic solutions while varying the excitation frequency. This is done by solving two-point boundary value problems using the multiple shooting method in combination with a path-following method. Experimental research concerning periodic solutions is carried out to verify the numerical results. The experimental results correspond very well with the numerical results. It appears that the high eigenfrequencies of the linear beam system strongly influence the low-frequency non-liner steady state response. This means that multi-degree-of-freedom models are important for an accurate representation of the actual system behaviour, although a single-degree-of-freedom model captures important first-order information {{about a lot of}} the non-linear phenomena in the low-frequency range...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAn {{analysis}} is presented for determining exact steady state response {{for a class}} of strongly non-linear multiple-degree-of-freedom oscillators. These oscillators consist of a linear component, with an arbitrary number of degrees of freedom and configuration, incorporating a component with a geometric non-linearity. Their behavior is analyzed by generalizing previous work on single- and two-degree-of-freedom piecewise linear systems under harmonic excitation. First, a methodology is developed for locating harmonic and subharmonic response characterized by one abrupt change of {{the parameters of the}} non-linear element per response cycle. Then, a stability {{analysis is}} presented, which is appropriate for general piecewise linear systems. The present analysis is applicable to a variety of engineering areas.

Performance of vibration absorbers with <b>elastic</b> <b>stops</b> is investigated first, while in the second category of examples the oscillators exhibit 2 : 1 and 3 : 1 internal resonance.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the <b>elastic</b> <b>stop</b> band properties of a theoretical cubic array of iron spheres {{connected to a}} bulk of concrete via iron or rubber ligaments. Each sphere can move freely within a surrounding air cavity, but ligaments couple it to the bulk and further facilitate bending and rotational motions. Associated low frequency local resonances are well predicted by an asymptotic formula. We find complete stop bands (for all wave-polarizations) in the frequency range $[16, 21]$ Hertz (resp. $[6, 11]$ Hertz) for $ 7. 4 $-meter (resp. $ 0. 74 $-meter) diameter iron spheres with a $ 10 $-meter (resp. $ 1 $-meter) center-to-center spacing, when they are connected to concrete via steel (resp. rubber) ligaments. The scattering problem shows that only bending modes are responsible for damping and that rotational modes are totally overwritten by bending modes. Regarding seismic applications, we further consider soil as a bulk medium, {{in which case the}} relative bandwidth of the low frequency stop band can be enlarged through ligaments of different sizes that allow for well separated bending and rotational modes. We finally achieve some damping of elastodynamic waves from $ 8 $ to $ 49 $ Hertz (relative stop band of $ 143 $ percent) for iron spheres $ 0. 74 $-meter in diameter that are connected to soil with six rubber ligaments of optimized shapes.

40|$|The HEXPANDO is an expanding-head {{hexagonal}} wrench designed to retain fasteners {{and keep them}} from being dislodged from the tool. The tool is intended to remove or install socket-head cap screws (SHCSs) in remote, hard-to-reach locations or in circumstances when a dropped fastener could cause damage to delicate or sensitive hardware. It is not intended for application of torque. This tool is made of two assembled portions. The first portion of the tool comprises tubing, or a hollow shaft, at a length that gives the user adequate reach to the intended location. At {{one end of the}} tubing is the expanding hexagonal head fitting with six radial slits cut into it (one at each of the points of the hexagonal shape), and a small hole drilled axially through the center and the end opposite the hex is internally and externally threaded. This fitting is threaded into the shaft (via external threads) and staked or bonded so that it will not loosen. At {{the other end of the}} tubing is a knurled collar with a through hole into which the tubing is threaded. This knob is secured in place by a <b>stop</b> <b>nut.</b> The second assembled portion of the tool comprises a length of all thread or solid rod that is slightly longer than the steel tubing. One end has a slightly larger knurled collar affixed while the other end is tapered/pointed and threaded. When the two portions are assembled, the all thread/rod portion feeds through the tubing and is threaded into the expanding hex head fitting. The tapered point allows it to be driven into the through hole of the hex fitting. While holding the smaller collar on the shaft, the user turns the larger collar, and as the threads feed into the fitting, the hex head expands and grips the SHCS, thus providing a safe way to install and remove fasteners. The clamping force retaining the SHCS varies depending on how far the tapered end is inserted into the tool head. Initial tests of the prototype tool, designed for a 5 mm or # 10 SHCS have resulted in up to 8 lb (. 35. 6 N) of pull force to dislodge the SHCS from the tool. The tool is designed with a lead-in angle from the diameter of the tubing to a diameter the same as the fastener head, to prevent the fastener head from catching on any obstructions encountered that could dislodge the fastener during retrieval...|$|R

This thesis explores an attenuation technique that rethinks {{the design of}} simple lightweight flexible structures, providing {{an alternative to the}} current methods of active controllers and heavy damping. Through multi-element/multi-path (MEMP) design, a structure is divided up into several constituent substructures with separate, elastically coupled, wave transmission paths that utilize the inherent dynamics of the system to achieve substantial wide-band reductions in the low frequency range while satisfying constraints on static strength and weight. Attenuation is achieved through several processes acting in concert: different subsystem wave speeds, mixed boundary conditions at end points, interaction through <b>elastic</b> couplings, and <b>stop</b> band behavior. The technique is first introduced into thin beams coupled with discrete axial and torsional springs, resulting in wide-band attenuation and agreement between analytical simulations and experimental studies. MEMP design is then implemented into concentric thin cylindrical shells, providing a more three-dimensional study with axially discrete azimuthally-continuous elastic connectors. By employing a modal decomposition of the governing shell equations, simulations reveal more opportunities for attenuation when subjected to various forcing conditions.

40|$|Vibrations are {{undesirable}} {{and cause}} many problems in engineering. Among the many techniques to reduce vibrations, phononic crystals and elastic metamaterials, that have periodic variations in geometry or material properties, {{have the potential}} to attenuate vibrations over a large range of frequencies. These classes of materials attenuate vibrations via the band gap mechanism that <b>stops</b> <b>elastic</b> waves from propagating. Additionally, periodic structures can possess high effective stiffness or strength to density ratios. This makes them ideal for lightweight structural applications. Furthermore, their periodic nature allows band gaps to be generated in them. These features can be combined to produce lightweight structural components with vibration isolation properties. Currently, very few studies of this class of materials for practical applications were made. Therefore, the goal of the work done in this thesis is to develop techniques and perform analyses to promote their implementation. A literature review has been performed on the techniques to determine the band structures and effective properties of lattice materials. A novel method coined the wave superposition method (WSM) to measure the band structure was developed. This method allows band structures to be determined experimentally using simple equipment with a small number of measurements. The method was then validated experimentally. A parametric study on the mechanical and dispersion properties of cubic lattice structures were conducted to assess the viability of designing a multifunctional lattice structure with excellent properties to be used as multifunctional lightweight and vibration attenuating components. Important trends relating to the geometric parameters to the performance of the lattice structures were found. Lastly, an experimental study was performed on a selected design to demonstrate the vibration attenuation characteristic of this material. The techniques and findings in this thesis, have laid the foundations for future development of periodic structures for both structural and vibration isolation applications. Open Acces...|$|R

Study setting: This study was conducted at a Pongee State Hospital, Maternal and Child Department, Federated States of Micronesia. Participants were receiving prenatal care. Methods: This is a convenience sample. Members of the Dental Department staff confidentially administered the surveys in May and July 2015. Independent samples t-test was used to find difference between the mean number of betel nut users who also used tobacco and those who did not use tobacco with their betel nut use in terms of their responses on the dependence symptom scale (craving scale). Spearman’s rank correlation was used to test for a relationship between the dependence symptom scores and health risk beliefs assessment scores for betel nut users who used betel nut at some point in their lives. Chi-square test of association was used to test for association between the level of education of the respondents and their betel nut use (chewers or non-chewers) and to test for association between their betel nut use and whether they smoked or not during pregnancy, alcohol use, and substance abuse. Results: In this study, 80 % of the 55 respondents had ever used betel. More than one sixth of all users (14. 7 %) used betel in the previous month, and 26 (76. 5 %) also used tobacco with the betel. Although not statistically significant, the mean (± SD) dependence symptom scale score among users who also used tobacco from cigarette was 8. 25 ± 0. 822 versus 6. 00 ± 2. 00 among those who used betel nut alone (t (22) = - 0. 8, p = 0. 432). The dependency score was positively but not significantly associated with frequency of tobacco use (e. g., mean (SD) = 11 ± 1. 761) among most frequent users versus a mean (SD) = 9. 14 ± 0. 688 among the never users [F(3, 28) = 1. 968, p = 0. 142) ]. 83. 3 % of the users who did not believe that after the birth of a child, it is safe for a new mom to chew betel nut also agreed or strongly agreed that encouragement should be given to pregnant women so that they <b>stop</b> chewing betel <b>nut</b> (χ 2 = 13. 698, p < 0. 05). 88 % of the users who did not believe that after the birth of a child, it is safe for a new mom to chew betel nut also agreed or strongly agreed that more help should be given to pregnant women who want <b>stop</b> chewing betel <b>nut</b> (χ 2 = 18. 429, p < 0. 05). There was no significant relationship found between the craving scale and the health risk belief assessment scale for both, users who had ever used betel (ρ = - 0. 240, p = 0. 238) and who used betel within the past 30 days using Spearman’s rank correlation (ρ = - 0. 394, p = 0. 085). Conclusion: Dependence was observed in pregnant betel users who also chewed tobacco versus those who used betel nut alone. The beliefs which prompted the pregnant women to chew are: to reduce morning sickness/nausea, for relief and relaxation, to avoid having a smelly mouth, and to prevent them from feeling tired or to work for a longer time. The health belief scale and craving were 80 % reliable and had high internal consistency, and the items in the questionnaire are well inter-correlated. There was no significant relationship found between the craving scale and the health risk belief assessment scale for both, users who had ever used betel (ρ = - 0. 240, p = 0. 238) and who used betel within the past 30 days using Spearman’s rank correlation (ρ = - 0. 394, p = 0. 085). Additional studies are required to corroborate the data of this preliminary study and develop effective betel nut cessation intervention program. One possible next step is the collection of samples tied to birth records, examining pregnancy outcomes more thoroughly. Future studies should also involve adolescents or parents who are introducing betel to young children...|$|R

Participants Patients compliant with compression therapy for 12 months after symptomatic, ultrasound proven proximal deep venous thrombosis of the leg. Interventions Continuation or cessation of ECS 12 months after deep venous thrombosis. Main outcome measures The primary outcome was the incidence of post-thrombotic syndrome 24 months after diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis, as assessed by the standardised Villalta scale in an intention to treat analysis. The predefined non-inferiority margin was 10 %. The main secondary outcome was quality of life (VEINES-QOL/Sym). Results 518 patients compliant with ECS and free of post-thrombotic syndrome were randomised one year after diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis to stop or continue ECS therapy for another year. In the stop-ECS group, 51 of 256 patients developed post-thrombotic syndrome, with an incidence of 19. 9 % (95 % confidence interval 16 % to 24 %). In the continue-ECS group, 34 of 262 patients developed post-thrombotic syndrome (incidence 13. 0 %, 9. 9 % to 17 %), of whom 85 % used ECS six or {{seven days a week}} during the study period, for an absolute difference of 6. 9 % (95 % confidence interval upper limit 12. 3 %). Because the upper limit of the 95 % confidence interval exceeds the predefined margin of 10 %, non-inferiority was not reached.

He is to break his fast at some unseen place on the opposite side. It may be Ledyard or the Wandering Jew. Whence, pray, did he come out of the foggy night? and whither through the sunny day will he go? We observe only his transit; important to us, forgotten by him, transiting all day. There are two of them. May be, they are Virgil and Dante. But when they crossed the Styx, none were seen bound up or down the stream, that I remember. It is only a transjectus, a transitory voyage, like life itself, none but the long-lived gods bound up or down the stream. Many of these Monday men are ministers, no doubt, reseeking their parishes with hired horses, with sermons in their valises all read and gutted, the day after never with them. They cross each other's routes all the country over like woof and warp, making a garment of loose texture; vacation now for six days. They <b>stop</b> to pick <b>nuts</b> and berries, and gather apples by the wayside at their leisure. Good religious men, with the love of men in their hearts, and the means to pay their toll in their pockets. We got over this ferry chain without scraping, rowing athwart the tide of travel,--no toll for us that day.|$|R
40|$|The revised {{second edition}} of this {{established}} text offers readers a significantly expanded {{introduction to the}} effects of radiation on metals and alloys. It describes the various processes that occur when energetic particles strike a solid, inducing changes to the physical and mechanical properties of the material. Specifically it covers particle interaction with the metals and alloys used in nuclear reactor cores and hence subject to intense radiation fields. It describes the basics of particle-atom interaction for a range of particle types, the amount and spatial extent of the resulting radiation damage, the physical effects of irradiation and the changes in mechanical behavior of irradiated metals and alloys. Updated throughout, some major enhancements for the new edition include improved treatment of low- and intermediate-energy <b>elastic</b> collisions and <b>stopping</b> power, expanded sections on molecular dynamics and kinetic Monte Carlo methodologies describing collision cascade evolution, new treatment of the multi-frequency model of diffusion, numerous examples of RIS in austenitic and ferritic-martensitic alloys, expanded treatment of in-cascade defect clustering, cluster evolution, and cluster mobility, new discussion of void behavior near grain boundaries, a new section on ion beam assisted deposition, and reorganization of hardening, creep and fracture of irradiated materials (Chaps 12 - 14) to provide a smoother and more integrated transition between the topics. The book also contains two new chapters. Chapter 15 focuses on the fundamentals of corrosion and stress corrosion cracking, covering forms of corrosion, corrosion thermodynamics, corrosion kinetics, polarization theory, passivity, crevice corrosion, and stress corrosion cracking. Chapter 16 extends this treatment and considers the effects of irradiation on corrosion and environmentally assisted corrosion, including the effects of irradiation on water chemistry and the mechanisms of irradiation-induced stress corrosion cracking. The book maintains the previous style, concepts are developed systematically and quantitatively, supported by worked examples, references for further reading and end-of-chapter problem sets. Aimed primarily at students of materials sciences and nuclear engineering, the book will also provide a valuable resource for academic and industrial research professionals. Reviews of the first edition: "…nomenclature, problems and separate bibliography {{at the end of each}} chapter allow to the reader to reach a straightforward understanding of the subject, part by part. … this book is very pleasant to read, well documented and can be seen as a very good introduction {{to the effects of}} irradiation on matter, or as a good references compilation for experimented readers. " - Pauly Nicolas, Physicalia Magazine, Vol. 30 (1), 2008 “The text provides enough fundamental material to explain the science and theory behind radiation effects in solids, but is also written at a high enough level to be useful for professional scientists. Its organization suits a graduate level materials or nuclear science course… the text was written by a noted expert and active researcher in the field of radiation effects in metals, the selection and organization of the material is excellent… may well become a necessary reference for graduate students and researchers in radiation materials science. ” - L.

40|$|Today {{practice}} of grouting {{is based on}} empirical approaches in that, pumping pressure and stop criteria are determined by benchmarking similar projects. Considering a maximum limit for grouting pressure would allow applying a relatively high pressure {{that may lead to}} jacking of the fracture or even uplift of the rock mass. On the other hand, keeping the pressure lower than the overburden, in order to avoid any deformation, will prolong grouting process. Determination of pumping pressure is more complicated considering the induced energy to the rock fracture due to combination of the injected volume and pumping pressure. In other word, pressurizing large volume of the injected grout with a low pumping pressure establish the same force inside the fracture as the high applied grouting pressure on small injected volume do. Therefore, an stop criterion to limit grouting volume along with grouting pressure, which is a hyperbola trimming maximum pressure-maximum volume limits and  named as grout intensity number (GIN), has been defined. However, in using this stop criterion and at completion point, the state of the fracture and the distance that grout spread inside the fracture are unknown. As a theoretical approach, examining the flow of the Bingham fluid in network of fractures led to development of a numerical model and later an analytical solution, which enabled estimation of distance that grout spread in the fractures in real time. Finally, theoretical curves to limit elastic and ultimate jacking were established to limit grout pressure in correlation with depth of grout penetration by considering the state of the fracture.   Despite empirical and theoretical developments, determination of optimum grouting pressure is still challenging. In this study, In addition to examining performance of the analytical solution in estimation of grout spread and distinguishing onset of fracture jacking, the goal is coming up with recommendations for selection of optimum grouting pressure, by examining mechanism of elastic jacking. For this purpose, negative aspects of fracture deformation, which are increase of grouting time and remaining transmissivity, were quantified and discussed against its positive effect on increase of penetrability. By that, application of a relatively high pressure was recommended in order to opening of the fracture to a permitted level, with purpose of increasing penetrability while considering negative effects of <b>elastic</b> jacking. The <b>stop</b> criterion is defined as the grouting time of achieving the required distance of grout spread at the highest applicable grouting pressure. In examining empirical methods, in grouting of fractures in deep levels, pressure-depth graph suggests usage of higher pressure in compare with the estimated pressure by theory while GIN method is conservative. In further studies GIN was estimated analytically and applying a relatively high grouting pressure in order to opening the fracture, up to attaining the hyperbola, and continuation of grouting with decreasing trend, in order to bringing the fracture back to its initial size at refusal, were proposed. Complexity of using this methodology in compare with theoretical approach was discussed. As the future work, {{there is a need to}} verify the results in the field, and to confirm well performance of this analytical solution in different geologies. Examining variation of grout mixture properties during grouting program as well as significance of simplification of geological pattern to a single horizontal fracture, in that grout flow radially, are among other future studies that can develop this theoretical application further.   QC 20141106 </p...|$|R
40|$|Water {{entry and}} exit, green water on deck, {{sloshing}} in tanks and capsizing in intact and damaged conditions are examples on violent fluid motion. The combination of model tests, theoretical analysis and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods is emphasized in treating these problems. Because mixing {{of air and}} liquid may occur, {{the interaction between the}} flow in the air and in the liquid ought to be considered in numerical simulations. Further, the mixing of air and liquid represents a scaling problem of model tests. In order to make a rational step in improving the analysis of nonlinear wave-induced ship motions and loads, it is necessary to base a solution on the Navier-Stokes equations, i. e. a CFD method has to be used. The Constrained Interpolation Profile (CIP) method described in this thesis is used as a CFD method for exterior water-body interaction studies. Because it is a rather new method, careful validation and verification are needed. This includes linear flow cases and sub-problems associated with large amplitude water entry and exit. In this method, the solid body and free surface interaction is treated as a multiphase problem, which includes liquid (water), gas (air) and solid (rectangular cylinder, circular cylinder, bow flare section, V-shaped section, etc.) phases. The flow is represented by one set of governing equations, which are solved numerically on a non-uniform, staggered Cartesian grid by a finite difference method. The free surface as well as the body boundary is immersed in the computational domain. First of all, linear and weakly nonlinear wave-body interaction problems are investigated by using a CIP-based finite difference method. The numerical wave tank (NWT) encounters difficulties in handling the long time simulation of large amplitude motions. Therefore, the wave-body interaction problem is isolated into water entry and water exit sub-problems. This thesis describes the fully nonlinear free-surface deformations of initially calm water caused by water-entry and water-exit of a horizontal circular cylinder with both forced and free vertical motions. This has relevance for marine operations {{as well as for the}} ability to predict large amplitude motions of floating sea structures. The numerical results of the water entry and exit force, the free surface deformation and the vertical motion of the cylinder are compared with experimental results, and favorable agreement is obtained. The CIP method is also applied to 2 D water entry of vertical and heeled bow flare and Vshaped sections. The results for the bow flare section have relevance for slamming loads on a ship in bow sea with large roll oscillations and relative vertical motions. The results for the heeled V-shaped section can be combined with a 2 D+t numerical method to study how the steady heel moment on a prismatic planing hull on a straight course in calm water depends on the Froude number (Faltinsen, 2005). A generally satisfactory agreement with experimental drop test results of vertical water entry velocity, vertical and horizontal hydrodynamic forces as a function of time is demonstrated. This includes the effect of flow separation from the knuckles. The experimental results have bias errors due to eigenfrequency oscillations of the test rig and the use of <b>elastic</b> ropes to <b>stop</b> the models. The occurrence of ventilation of the leeward hull side is examined. An example on 3 D calculations by means of the CIP method is presented. Green water on the deck of a Wigley hull at Froude number 0. 25 in head sea is studied. Our studies are a step towards developing rational CFD methods for predicting strongly nonlinear wave-induced motions and loads on a ship. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R
40|$|The California Department of Transportation (CalTrans) {{is urging}} {{researchers}} and contractors {{to develop the}} next generation highway bridge design. New design solutions should favor the use of modular construction techniques over conventional cast-in-place reinforced concrete {{in order to reduce}} the cost of the projects and the amount of constructions on site. Earthquake resistant bridges are designed such that the columns are monolithically connected to the girder and the foundations. Hence, despite the great improvements recently made in modular bridge construction, a large amount of concrete is still cast in place to properly splice the reinforcements between the segments. Instead of designing earthquake resistant bridges with monolithic joints, it is proposed to use discontinuous connections in this thesis. The segments may rock at their interface during a severe earthquake and, if rocking rotation is too large, the structure may collapse. However, if a bridge is allowed to rock moderately, it may modify the earthquake response and drastically reduce the resisting forces within the structure. The research presented in this dissertation focuses on the modeling of rocking connections. First, the behavior of rocking rigid blocks under earthquake excitation is studied. It is proposed to restrain the rigid blocks with an unbonded post-tensioning cable in order to allow rocking but prevent overturning. The findings made on rigid blocks, however, cannot be applied to deformable structures because of the limitations of the model. Therefore, a completely different approach is proposed. Instead of modeling the behavior of an entire block, it is proposed to model only the rocking surface. A zero-length finite element is developed, allowing to represent the in-plane rocking rotation between two frame elements. It allows to investigate the behavior of a deformable column rocking freely on its base as well as the stability of a rocking column restrained with a cable and subjected to a large earthquake excitation. The consequences of a post-tensioning cable failure and yielding of the column are also investigated. It is proposed to add a dissipative fuse between the base of the column and its footing in order to enhance the stability of the structure. Finally, the behavior of a conventional monolithic bridge is compared with a bridge allowed to rock at the columns joints. The results obtained with the rigid block model show that, when columns are allowed to rock under earthquake excitation, it is possible to adjust the response and preserve stability with a Post-Tensioning (PT) cable. The implementation of the zero-length rocking element permits to study the behavior of deformable structures that are allowed to rock. At first, this element is used in combination with a very stiff elastic element and the results are consistent with the response of a rigid block. This element shows that the free rocking response of an <b>elastic</b> column may <b>stop</b> rocking and start to oscillate in flexure. The dissipative fuse in combination with a long unbonded PT cable proves to be effective. However, it is shown that, if the dissipative fuse is too large, it may prevent the column from returning to its initial position. At last, it is shown that a bridge structure allowed to rock and restrained with cables can sustain a large earthquake. The resisting moments within the columns are greatly reduced when compared with a conventional bridge while the drift ratio remains moderate.|$|R
40|$|Like {{the three}} other {{experiments}} at RHIC (Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider) in the Brookhaven National Laboratory near New York, STAR (Solenoidal Tracker At RHIC) {{is dedicated to the}} search of a particular state of nuclear matter, predicted by lattice QCD (Quantum ChromoDynamics) calculations : the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP). This state, supposed to be that of the Universe a few fraction of second after the Big Bang, should consist according to its first definition (1975) in a matter where quarks and gluons are deconfined and without any interaction. It could be created in laboratory with ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions allowing to reach extreme temperatures and pressure. After 20 years of research in Europe and United States, CERN annnnounced (on february 20 th, 2000) that a particular state of matter as been created, compatible with a QGP state, but {{it was not possible to}} characterize it completely. RHIC experiments then take over. Today, all the numerous new results that have been collected let us believe that indeed an atypical state of nuclear matter has been reated at RHIC and our understanding of the QGP as a perfect partonic state without any interaction has been reviewed. A new acronym has been defined : sQGP for Strongly Interacting QGP. This has been obtained by the characterization of the heavy ion collision evolution, from a chemical and dynamical point of view, by comparing effect in heavy ion collisions (for which conditions should be satisfied to form a QGP to collisions at lower energies or involving lighter ions that can not produce the requiered conditions. The QGP is indeed to furtive to be probed directly. My "Habilitation à Diriger des Recherches" presents results of the analyses that I have directed and that contributed to highlight the formation of a new state of matter at RHIC and this new conception of the QGP. Signs of the QGP have been searched with strange particles : resonances of particles containing one strange quark and baryons with two strange quarks. The production of strange resonances provides indeed information on the hadronization phase (when partons recombined in hadrons) : according to their measurement or not, it is possible to characterize the chemical freeze-out (at which inelastic interactions stop) and cinetic freeze-out (at which <b>elastic</b> interactions <b>stop),</b> if these two freeze-outs coincide or not, if there is some delay between them. The idea is the following : Lambdas(1520) rescatters in a proton and a kaon. Hence, if the time between both freeze-outs is long, products of the desintegration can be rescattered in the dense medium. However, if both freeze-outs coincide or are very close, products of the desintegration are not influenced and the particle mother (resonance) can be identified. Thus, by measuring yields of production of resonances in proton-proton collisions (for which freeze-out coincide) and by comparing to the yields obtained in Au–Au collisions, it appears that indeed at least both freeze-outs are separated by 4 fm/c in Au–Au collisions. This conclusion is an important step in the understanding of ultra_relativistic heavy ion collisions. This analyse was very original within the STAR Collaboration because it was the first study done on strange resonances. Dedicated algorithms have been developed and are used in the collaboration which studies various other resonances or exotic particles. The production of strange baryons was extensively investigated in the passed experiments since an anormal enhancement of the yields of production is expected if a QGP is formed. CERN experiments have indeed observed an overproduction of strangeness in Pb-Pb collisions but were not able to conlude if a QGP has been created or not since it was possible to explain their results by hadronic gas models. We have realised a similar analysis with the STAR data by comparing the yields of multi-strange baryons (Xi containing two strange quarks), in proton–proton and Au–Au collisiobs at sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV. Again, results remain ambigous. These results lead some physicists to the conclusion that strange particle yields can not be viewed as a potential signature of the QGP. However, strangeness comes on stage in a more indirect manner, providing very various information and on the various phases of the collision. Xi particles indicated firstly that the system created at the full energy at RHIC is thermally and chemically equilibrated (at least in strangeness production. Chemical freeze-out temperatures are close to the temperature predicted by QCD for the phase transition. We have also investigated dynamical collective effects (flow phenomenon) coming from interactions between constituants and lead to an emision of matter in particular directions in phase space. In agreement with their small interaction cross sections, Xi baryons seem to decouple earlier than the lighter particles. However, the fact that baryons suffer a substantial flow, may indicate that they have develop a flow hence that they encountered interactions, before the hadronic phase, differently speaking during the partonic phase. Partons seem to interact ontrarily to the first expectations and predictions of the theoricians 20 years ago. Moreover, during 2003, the fourth RHIC experiments revealed conjointly the discover of the jet-quenching effect in heavy ion collisions : it corresponds to a suppression of charged particles at high transverse momentum which is nowadays explained by the energy loss of partons in a dense medium. This effect has been studied in the case of Xi particles and showed that jet-quenching affects also baryons and also that they have a different behaviour than the mesons. A particle type dependance has been shown in agreement to coalescence models claiming that hadrons come from quark recombination. This point highlights the fact that quarks may be the relevant degree of freedom. From these results among others, some theoricians claim the QGP discover at RHIC but experimentalists are more careful and prefer to confirm their results with the study of other signatures. These last five years were particularly exciting with the progress of our knowledges thanks to the wonderful results produced by the fourth RHIC experiments. The QGP has evolved : it is not anymore a perfect plasma without any interactions but a sQGP. A l'instar des trois autres expériences auprès du collisionneur RHIC (Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider) du Brookhaven National Laboratory près de New York, STAR (Solenoidal Tracker At RHIC) est entièrement consacrée à la mise en évidence de cet état particulier de la matière nucléaire prédit par les calculs de QCD (Quantum ChromoDynamics) sur réseau : le plasma de quarks et de gluons (QGP pour Quark Gluon Plasma). Cet état, supposé être celui de l'Univers quelques fractions de secondes après le Big Bang, consisterait d'après sa définition originelle de 1975, en une matière dans laquelle quarks et gluons seraient déconfinés, sans interaction. Il pourrait être créé en laboratoire lors de collisions d'ions lourds réalisées à des énergies ultra-relativistes afin d'atteindre des températures et densités d'énergie extrêmes. Après quasiment 20 ans de recherche auprès des différents accélérateurs de particules américains et européens, le CERN annonce le 10 février 2000 au cours d'une conférence de presse, la mise en évidence expérimentale d'un état particulier de la matière nucléaire, compatible avec la formation d'un QGP, sans pouvoir toutefois le caractériser pleinement. Les expériences du RHIC ont alors pris le relais. Aujourd'hui, au travers une pléthore de résultats nouveaux et parfois bien surprenants, il apparaît de façon de plus en plus certaine, qu'effectivement un état atypique de matière nucléaire a été créé à RHIC et notre vision du QGP comme un gaz parfait de partons n'interagissant que très faiblement, a depuis changé. Un nouvel acronyme a été défini : sQGP pour Strongly Interacting QGP. Pour parvenir à cette observation, il a fallu passer par la caractérisation même de l'évolution des collisions d'ions lourds, du point de vue chimique et dynamique, en comparant les phénomènes des collisions d'ions lourds pour lesquelles les conditions devraient être réunies pour former un QGP à des collisions d'énergies moindres ou de systèmes plus légers qui ne peuvent permettre cette formation. Le QGP est en effet produit de manière beaucoup trop furtive pour pouvoir le sonder directement. Mon mémoire d'Habilitation à Diriger des Recherches présente les résultats des analyses que j'ai menées et qui ont contribué à la mise en évidence de la formation d'un état nouveau au RHIC et à cette nouvelle vision du plasma. Les stigmates du QGP ont été recherchés avec les particules contenant des quarks étranges : les résonances de particules simplement étranges et les baryons doublement étranges. La production des résonances étranges Lambda(1520) apporte en effet des informations sur la phase d'hadronisation du plasma (lorsque les partons se recomposent en hadrons) : selon leur observation ou non, il pourrait être possible de caractériser le freeze-out chimique (instant où les interactions inélastiques cessent et la composition chimique du système est figée), le freeze-out cinétique (instant où les interactions élastiques cessent et les particules n'interagissent plus), si ces deux freeze-out coïncident ou si, au contraire ils sont séparés dans le temps et de combien. L'idée est la suivante : les Lambdas(1520) se désintègrent quasiment instantanément en un proton et un kaon. Par conséquent, si le temps entre les freeze-out chimique et cinétique est long, les produits de désintégration de ces particules peuvent être absorbés dans le milieu dense qui a été créé. En revanche, si les deux freeze-out coïncident ou sont très proches, les produits de désintégration ne sont pas affectés et la particule mère, c'est-à-dire la résonance, peut être identifiée. Ainsi, en mesurant les taux de production de ces particules dans les collisions proton–proton pour lesquelles les deux freeze-out coïncident, et en comparant les taux obtenus dans les collisions Au–Au, à l'énergie nominale du RHIC, il est apparu qu'effectivement, au moins 4 fm/c séparent les deux freeze-out dans les collisions Au–Au. Cette conclusion constitue une étape importante dans la compréhension des collisions d'ions lourds ultra-relativistes et du comportement de la matière dans des conditions extrêmes. Cette analyse est apparue comme originale au sein de la collaboration STAR, étant la première étude sur les résonances étranges. Des algorithmes spécifiques ont dû être mis au point et sont largement utilisés au sein de la collaboration qui depuis étudie de nombreuses autres résonances ou recherche des objets plus exotiques. La production des baryons étranges a été largement investiguée les années passées car une augmentation « anormale » des taux de production est attendue si un QGP est formé. Les expériences du CERN ont observé effectivement une surproduction de l'étrangeté dans les collisions Pb–Pb mais n'ont pu conclure de manière décisive quant à une formation éventuelle d'un plasma car ces résultats pouvaient être également reproduits par des modèles de gaz de hadrons. Nous avons mené une analyse similaire avec les données de STAR en comparant les taux de production des Xi, baryons doublement étranges, dans les collisions proton–proton et Au–Au à sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV. Là aussi, les résultats sont demeurés ambigus. Ainsi, ces résultats ont conduit un certain nombre de physiciens à ne plus considérer les taux de production de particules étranges comme une signature robuste de la formation d'un QGP. En revanche, l'étrangeté est revenue sur le devant de la scène, de façon plus indirecte donnant des informations très diverses et sur les différentes étapes de la collision. Les Xi ont révélé tout d'abord que le système créé à l'énergie nominale du RHIC serait en équilibre thermique et chimique et que les températures de freeze-out chimique sont proches de la température de déconfinement prédite par QCD. Nous avons également étudié les phénomènes dynamiques collectifs, appelés flot, qui naissent des interactions entre constituants et se traduisent par une émission de matière dans des directions privilégiées de l'espace de phase. En accord avec leurs faibles sections efficaces d'interaction, les Xi semblent émis bien plus tôt que les particules plus légères. Toutefois, le fait que ces baryons subissent un flot important, laisse supposer qu'elles auraient développé un flot, donc qu'elles auraient été soumises à des interactions, avant la phase d'hadronisation, autrement dit, dans une phase partonique. Les partons subiraient donc des interactions résiduelles, contrairement à ce que préconisaient les théoriciens du milieu des années soixante-dix. Par ailleurs, en 2003, les quatre expériences du RHIC ont révélé conjointement la mise en évidence du phénomène de jet-quenching dans les collisions d'ions lourds : il traduit une diminution de la production de particules chargées de très haute impulsion transverse s'expliquant par la perte d'énergie des partons dans un milieu très dense. Nous avons réalisé cette analyse en considérant les X et montré que non seulement ces baryons subissent un jet-quenching mais aussi qu'ils ont un comportement différent de celui des mésons. Une dépendance des phénomènes dynamiques au type de particules a ainsi été mise en évidence en accord avec les modèles de coalescence préconisant que les hadrons se forment à partir de la recombinaison des quarks. Là aussi, émergence des partons comme degrés de liberté pertinents. A partir de ces résultats entre autres, certains théoriciens affirment la découverte du QGP à RHIC mais les expérimentateurs sont plus prudents et désirent auparavant confirmer et enrichir leurs résultats par l'étude d'autres observables qui viendraient corroborer ces observations. Ces années ont été particulièrement stimulantes par l'évolution de nos connaissances grâce aux formidables résultats produits par les quatre expériences du RHIC. Les « vielles » signatures ont fait peau neuve se transformant en sondes nouvelles et riches en informations originales. La conception du QGP a évolué : il ne s'agit plus d'un gaz parfait constitué de partons évoluant librement mais d'un sQGP...|$|R
