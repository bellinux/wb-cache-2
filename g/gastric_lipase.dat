When food travels through the oral cavity and down the esophagus into the stomach, enzymes such as pepsin are released where it cleaves large proteins into smaller peptide fragments so further digestion and absorption can occur in the duodenum, {{the first part of}} the small intestine.

50|$|In the uterus, {{the fetus}} is {{dependent}} on a high-carbohydrate diet, and lingual as well as <b>gastric</b> <b>lipases</b> {{are present in the}} fetus from 26 weeks of gestation on. After birth, fat in mother's milk or a milk substitute becomes the major source of nutrition. Absorptive rates of dietary fat are much lower in neonates than in adults, 65-80% as compared to >95% respectively, which can be attributed to low pancreatic lipase activity. Furthermore, milk fat is not a good substrate for pancreatic lipase. This fact, in combination with the bile salt deficiency and low pH throughout the gastrointestinal tract of the neonate, demands that lingual lipase be the main enzyme catalyzing the hydrolysis of dietary fat. This enzyme activity has been seen as early as 26 weeks gestational age, with ability to hydrolyze dietary fats variable according to digestive tract maturity.|$|R

5000|$|The lipase inhibitors lipstatin and {{orlistat}} act locally in {{the intestinal}} tract. They are minimally {{absorbed in the}} circulation because of their lipophilicity. Hence, they do not affect systemic lipases. [...] The mechanism of lipase inhibitors in fat digestion {{is shown in figure}} 1. These inhibitors bind covalently as an ester to the serine hydroxyl group at the active site on pancreatic- and <b>gastric</b> <b>lipases</b> and form a stable complex.This results in a conformational change in the enzyme which causes exposing of the catalytic active site. When the active site is exposed, the hydroxyl group on the serine residue is acylated. This leads to irreversible inactivation of the enzyme. The inactive lipase is incapable of hydrolysing fats into absorbable fatty acids and monoglycerides, therefore triglycerides are excreted undigested with faeces. With this mode of action calorie uptake from fat in food is limited, hence body weight is reduced. The main role of lipase inhibitors is therefore to inhibit lipases in the gastrointestinal tract, but they do not have significant activity against proteases, amylases or other digestive enzymes.|$|R

Using a constrained non-linear optimization computer program, the FA compositions and abundances of 170 different TG combinations were calculated. The major two, 16 : 0 / 18 : 1 / 18 : 1 (11. 8 mol%) and 16 : 0 / 18 : 1 / 18 : 2 (10. 0 mol%), were almost twice as abundant as expected from random FA distribution.

Orlistat (also called tetrahydrolipstatin or THL) is an FDA-approved antiobesity drug targeting primarily the pancreatic and <b>gastric</b> <b>lipases</b> within the gastrointestinal tract. It shows potential activities against tumors, mycobacteria, and parasites. Herein, we report the synthesis and evaluation of an expanded set of orlistat-like compounds, some of which showed highly potent trypanocidal activities in both the bloodstream form (BSF) and the procyclic form (PCF) of T. brucei. Subsequent in situ parasite based proteome profiling was carried out to elucidate potential cellular targets of the drug in both forms. Some newly identified targets were further validated by the labeling of recombinantly expressed enzymes in Escherichia coli lysates. Bioimaging experiments with a selected compound were carried out to study the cellular uptake of the drug in T. brucei. Results indicated that orlistat is much more efficiently taken up by the BSF than the PCF of T. brucei and has clear effects on the morphology of mitochondria, glycosides, and the endoplasmic reticulum in both BSF and PCF cells. These results support specific effects of orlistat on these organelles and correlate well with our in situ proteome profiling. Given the economic challenges of de novo drug development for neglected diseases, we hope that our findings will stimulate further research towards the conversion of orlistat-like compounds into new trypanocidal drugs...|$|R

5000|$|As further discussed, {{orlistat}} is a pancreatic and <b>gastric</b> <b>lipase</b> inhibitor.

Since FAS is essential for tumor cells, for its growth and survival, and is upregulated and overexpressed in variety of tumors, scientists have high expectations for FAS as a oncology drug target. Orlistat inhibits FAS with the same mechanism as it does with pancreatic lipase, that is by binding covalently to the active serine site. [...] This effect of orlistat as a FAS-inhibitor was first identified in a high throughput screening for enzymes with prostate cancer inhibition activity. However FAS is resistant to many cancer medicines. Orlistat sensitizes these FAS resistance cancer drugs, by inhibiting FAS. There is a low FAS expression in normal tissues so the activity of orlistat on normal cells is limited. Because {{of the difference in}} FAS expression between normal cells and cancer cells, orlistat selectively targets tumor cells. Due to this FAS is a potential drug target in cancer therapy.|$|E
40|$|A {{high energy}} supply and {{appropriate}} amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids {{is crucial for}} proper growth and development in neonates. The capacity for fatty acid absorption in newborns is however hampered due to an undeveloped pancreatic function combined with a low bile output. This seems in particular to limit fatty acid absorption in babies given infant formulas. Since interaction between the lipid droplet and the gastric and duodenal lipases occur through the hydrophobic/hydrophilic interface, {{the composition of the}} emulsifier may be crucial for efficient hydrolysis. We therefore determined hydrolytic rate of <b>gastric</b> <b>lipase</b> and pancreatic lipase, on their own or pancreatic lipase after <b>gastric</b> <b>lipase</b> on TAG droplets of similar size emulsified in either soy lecithin (SL) or in bovine milk phospholipids (MPL), more similar to human milk globule membrane lipids than soy lecithin. <b>Gastric</b> <b>lipase</b> activity was substantially higher on MPL-emulsified particles, while SL emulsification caused a higher rate of pancreatic lipase hydrolysis, on particles that had not been pre-treated with <b>gastric</b> <b>lipase.</b> MPL emulsification did however cause higher pancreatic lipase activity, when the particles had been pre-treated with <b>gastric</b> <b>lipase.</b> The attenuating effect of MPL-emulsification on pancreas lipase activity was validated in vivo in mice. Practical application: Our results show that the activity of <b>gastric</b> <b>lipase,</b> a key enzyme in lipid absorption in neonates, is highly dependent on the phospholipid composition of the surface layer on the emulsion droplets. We furthermore show that increasing <b>gastric</b> <b>lipase</b> activity by modifying the phospholipid composition on the droplet surface, also enhance the subsequent activity of the pancreatic lipase acting in the duodenum. This implies {{that it is possible to}} strategically design the surface layer of lipid droplets in infant formulas to maximize <b>gastric</b> <b>lipase</b> activity, and that this could improve total fatty acid absorption in formula-fed neonates. This is of particular importance in the development of formula aimed at pre-mature babies, but is also highly relevant for formulas for term-born infants. Emulsifying corn oil in milk phospholipids rather than soy lecithin causes a substantial increase in <b>gastric</b> <b>lipase</b> activity (upper).

The World Health Organization estimates that there are over 400 million obese and over 1. 6 billion overweight adults, a figure which is projected to almost double by 2015. This is not a disease restricted to adults – at least 20 million {{children under the age}} of 5 years were overweight in 2005 (WHO 2006). Overweight and obesity lead to serious health consequences including coronary artery disease, stroke, type- 2 diabetes, heart failure, dyslipidemia, hypertension, reproductive and gastrointestinal cancers, gallstones, fatty liver disease, osteoarthritis and sleep apnea (Padwal et al 2003). Modest weight loss in the obese of between 5 % and 10 % of bodyweight is associated with improvements in cardiovascular risk profiles and reduced incidence of type 2 diabetes (Goldstein 1992; Avenell et al 2004; Padwal and Majumdar 2007). Orlistat, a <b>gastric</b> and pancreatic <b>lipase</b> inhibitor that reduces dietary fat absorption by approximately 30 %, has been approved for use for around ten years (Zhi et al 1994; Hauptman 2000).
