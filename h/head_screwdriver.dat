50|$|The {{standard}} {{driving system}} for a stud type cam follower is a slot, for use with a flat <b>head</b> <b>screwdriver.</b> However, hex sockets are available for higher torquing ability, which is especially useful for eccentric cam followers and those used in blind holes. Hex socket cam followers from most manufacturers eliminate the relubrication capability on that end of the cam follower. RBC Bearings' Hexlube cam followers feature a relubrication fitting {{at the bottom of}} the hex socket.|$|E

50|$|Many screws use a <b>screwdriver</b> <b>head</b> fitting, {{rather than}} an {{external}} wrench. Screwdrivers are applied in-line with the fastener, {{rather than from the}} side. These are smaller than most wrench heads and cannot usually apply the same amount of torque. It is sometimes assumed that <b>screwdriver</b> <b>heads</b> imply a screw and wrenches imply a bolt, although this is incorrect. Coach screws are large square-headed screws with a tapered wood screw thread, used for attaching ironwork to timber.|$|R
5000|$|An early {{incarnation}} involved Morty and Summer {{going about}} frozen {{time when they}} are confronted a time policeman—which evolved into the time-traveling testicle monsters. These characters were originally inspired by Stephen King's miniseries The Langoliers. This version was cut because they deemed it too [...] "basic" [...] with nowhere {{to go for a}} potential second act. One deleted element of the splitting time was referring to it as a [...] "time quake"; an early version featured Rick berating Morty for wearing [...] "shorty shorts", which caused time to split. The reason for the fractured time was ultimately re-developed into something more specific to the characters. At first, chaos as a whole was responsible for the split time, but they decided on uncertainty as a cause solely to serve a joke about flathead/Phillips <b>head</b> <b>screwdrivers.</b> [...] "When you're talking about how to define chaos, let alone uncertainty, that's when you get into a semantic spiral," [...] producer Ryan Ridley said. Harmon felt it a suitable source for the time split because uncertainty was [...] "an intersection between quantum physics and the human condition." [...] The team was happy when they created the joke that Rick believes his parallel self is plotting to kill him, because it [...] "felt like we were writing a cartoon." ...|$|R

50|$|One America Plaza is {{the tallest}} {{building}} in San Diego, California and a prominent {{fixture in the}} waterfront district of the downtown San Diego skyline. The 34-story, 500 ft, 623000 sq ft, obelisk-shaped tower was designed by Helmut Jahn of Murphy/Jahn Architects and KMA Architecture. The top of the building bears {{a striking resemblance to}} the end of a Phillips <b>head</b> <b>screwdriver</b> and has a similar appearance to Two Liberty Place in Philadelphia also designed by Jahn, which is a year older. The building is the maximum height permitted by the US Federal Aviation Administration for a structure in downtown San Diego due to its close proximity to San Diego International Airport.|$|E

Grabbing the knife Sarah dropped earlier, Pino begins trying to stab Derek, whom he had placed in a large sack. Derek is saved when Noah breaks {{into the room and}} starts {{fighting}} Pino, distracting him long enough for Sarah to halve him at the waist with a double-bit axe. Barely functioning, Pino cries for his father before grabbing Sarah's leg, causing her to stomp his head into pieces.|$|R
40|$|Faire, many {{remarkable}} {{experiences were}} ripe for the taking. They could share in hands- on activities while attending {{a working group}} on outdoor mosaics, observing a robot- making demonstration, or sitting in on a make- your- own ter-rarium class. The activity in Studio One was no different: the energy was high and the action perplexing. Children clamored {{for a chance to}} use a Phillips- <b>head</b> <b>screwdriver.</b> Adults cut delicate wires and relayed stories of their latest elec-tronic gadgets. A collection of mechanical odds and ends — soldering irons, spray cans, vacuum cleaner heads, and toaster shells — lay distributed across all surfaces of the room. This cluster of activity {{at the end of the}} Studio One hall-way was as anarchic as all the rest: fast paced, thrilling, and difficult to digest (tdarci 2012). To the handful of people facilitating this work, the pandemonium was familiar and somewhat double- edged. It was the thirty- fifth Fixit Clinic, a public venue for facilitated repair often arranged out of libraries, museums, and community centers located east of San Francisco (see fig. 1). Meanwhile, fifty miles south, the inau-gural event of the Palo Alto Repair Café, another public site of repair, was taking place at the Museum of American Heritage (see fig. 2). The two events were not planned to overlap, but, as we will see, this arrangement of concurrent yet separate programs prefigured their common practices and divergent cultural aims. Public sites of repair, such as the Fixit Clinic and the Repair Café, are community- supported events designed to help local residents fix and learn to fi...|$|E
40|$|Follow {{the steps}} below {{to install the}} Conifer Chamber, and read the {{operational}} considerations for information on configuring the LI- 6400 software to compute leaf temperature using energy balance. Figure 2. Unscrew the knurled adjustment nut. Installation The sensor head handle must be removed to accomodate the 6400 - 05, so a tripod is usually required for making measurements. 1. Remove the male end of the leaf temperature thermocouple connec-tor by pulling straight out, and pull the air hose from {{the underside of the}} leaf chamber. 2. Unplug the log switch (not used with the conifer chamber). If the log switch wires are threaded underneath the bottom cover of the sensor head, this cover must be removed to free the log switch con-nector. a. Turn the sensor head over and remove the 3 Phillips head screws as shown in Figure 1. b. Remove the hose barbs, if necessary. You may be able to slide the cover out from underneath the hose barbs; be careful not to damage the PC board under the cover. If you remove the hose barbs, be sure and note the position of the sample and reference air hoses; the sample hose is wrapped with a piece of black shrink wrap. c. Free the wires. d. Re-assemble the cover {{on the bottom of the}} sensor head. 3. Remove the handle assembly: a. Unscrew the knurled leaf chamber adjustment nut (turn clock-wise) until it is free of the handle (Figure 2). b. With the handle latching mechanism in the closed position, wrap tape or string around the handle (where your hand would nor-mally be) so that it will stay together. Failure to do so may result in the spring coming out. Leave the handle secured in this manner. c. Remove the 2 screws (3 on some instruments) on the back side of the handle, as shown in Figure 3, using a # 1 Phillips <b>head</b> <b>screwdriver.</b> Figure 1.

Apart from the prizes drawn from the vessel, some prizes are calculated from the winning numbers (view the table with prizes above).|$|R
50|$|Wingard was {{appointed}} by Washington and Clackamas county commissioners to fill a vacancy in the Oregon House following the resignation of Jerry Krummel in August 2008, and announced his plans to seek election to a full term. During the campaign, it was revealed he was convicted in 2001 for misdemeanor assault for hitting his son on the <b>head</b> with a <b>screwdriver.</b> Wingard did community service and the conviction was eventually expunged. He won the November general election with 50% of the vote, defeating Democrat Jessica Adamson (45%) and Libertarian Marc Delphine (5%). In 2010, Wingard won reelection with 61% of the vote, defeating Democrat Sandy Webb (39%).|$|R
5000|$|While most racist {{abuse in}} Ireland is verbal, violent hate crimes have occurred. In 2000, {{a white man}} was stabbed and seriously injured when {{defending}} his Jamaican-born wife from racist abuse {{by a group of}} adult men. In 2002, a Chinese man Zhao Liu Tao (29) was murdered in Dublin in what was described as the Republic of Ireland's first racially motivated murder. Later that year Leong Ly Min, a Vietnamese man who had lived in Dublin since 1979, was mortally wounded by two assailants who had been racially abusing him. In February 2008, two Polish mechanics, Paweł Kalita (29) and Mariusz Szwajkos (27) were attacked by a group of Dublin youths and died outside their home after each being stabbed in the <b>head</b> with a <b>screwdriver.</b> In 2010, 15-year-old schoolboy Toyosi Shittabey, born in Nigeria but brought up in Dublin, was killed.

500|$|Next, Triple H faced Intercontinental Champion Ric Flair in a Last Man Standing match. Flair {{was still}} {{on his way to}} the ring, when Triple H {{attacked}} him and gained the early advantage. After attacking Flair's <b>head</b> with a <b>screwdriver,</b> Triple H continued using foreign objects throughout the match, including a folding chair, a sledgehammer, and the steel steps. The match went back and forth between Triple H and Flair. Triple H attempted a Pedigree through a broadcast table but Flair countered the move into a back body drop through another broadcast table. Triple H later performed three Pedigrees on Flair but Flair got up each time. Triple H then hit Flair in the back with a sledgehammer, and Flair did not stand by the referee's ten count, giving Triple H the win. After the match, Edge and Lita came to the ring, and Edge announced that he would be hosting a new show on Raw entitled [...] "The Cutting Edge". Edge noted that Dmitri Young was in the audience, and proceeded to criticize the sports teams of Detroit. Young replied by insulting Edge and his lack of a world championship.|$|R
50|$|Eden can {{not hide}} her gasp, unknowingly drawing Ray's attention. As Ray looks in {{to inspect the}} bodies, he grabs Eden's foot, but Eric begins to groan to protect Eden. Ray then stabs Eric in the <b>head</b> with a <b>screwdriver.</b> Eden then fights Ray by setting him on fire and pushing him down a chute, but he drags her with him. She then uses a charm she got from CeCe that protects against evil. Ray submits, but the snakes {{possessing}} his body emerge {{to try to take}} the charm from her. Eden escapes up the chute, using the charm as a diversion. Eden then traps Ray and the snakes in the chute. As she tries to drive off in his tow truck, she hears an inhuman shriek, signaling Ray is back. Ray chases Eden out of the truck before she can do anything and she runs to hide in the bayou. She hides behind a bush close to Ray. He hears a rustling and hacks the bush, revealing she is not there. Just then the tow truck emerges through the underbrush and crushes Ray in half against a tree, killing him. Eden then staggers off into the trees, and the two snakes can be seen crawling out of Ray's decomposing torso to find another host.|$|R
50|$|More {{video is}} shown, spying {{on the young}} girl's family. The video pans and a distraught Tim sits with the mother on the couch. It is clear they are familiar, and the mother begins oral sex on Tim. A car pulls up the drive and it is {{revealed}} to be Pastor Bobby: Molly emerges from the house naked and the two embrace. Shortly afterwards, Pastor Bobby {{is seen in the}} bathtub, dead and covered in blood and bites. Tim goes back to the house and finds the video camera left playing on the bed, showing a recording of himself with the neighbour. Molly strikes him across the head with a bat, drags him downstairs, and kills him by stabbing him in the <b>head</b> with a <b>screwdriver,</b> the same way Pastor Bobby was killed. Another video edit shows the police in the woods digging, pulling away to reveal the body of the young girl. The mother sobs, and Molly slips away. Afterwards, Molly lies naked and sobbing on the floor until her attitude abruptly changes and she shows a half smile. She walks out of the backdoor naked towards a tall figure with glowing eyes, a horse head and body of a man (resembling the demon Orobas).|$|R
40|$|In the UK, {{stabbing}} is {{the most}} common cause of homicide. The weapons used include knives, swords, screwdrivers and glass shards. Quantifying the exact force used in a stabbing incident is considered to be a difficult area due to the large number of variables present, such as sharpness of weapon, angle of attack and relative movements of the people involved. Having quantifiable data would allow a forensic pathologist to make a more informed decision when it comes to answering the commonly posed question in court "what was the degree of force involved in the stabbing incident?" The answer to this question is considered significant in determining an alleged assailant's intent to cause harm. This paper presents results of the first detailed study relating geometry of screwdrivers to the forces required for penetration. Additionally, a range of other blunt weapons such as pens and chisels have also been studied. A silicone rubber-foam analogue has been used as the main skin simulant owing to it having similar mechanical properties to that of human skin and giving highly repeatable results. Different screwdrivers of varying shape and size have been tested (i. e. slotted, Phillips, posidriv and Torx), along with other implements including chisels and pens. The weapon geometry was characterised and related to the peak force required for penetration. Our results show that there is a direct correlation between the cross-sectional area of a <b>screwdriver</b> <b>head</b> and the amount of force required for penetration. Screwdrivers with larger cross-sectional areas require a significantly greater force to penetrate (forces in the region of 100 - 120 N) but "sharper" slotted screwdrivers penetrate with much lower forces (~ 30 N). The forces required for penetrating the rubber-foam analogue with screwdrivers are higher than for "sharp" knives, but in some cases similar to the forces required for stabbing with "blunt" knives. For the other weapons such as chisels and biros, the force required for penetration was again high and there was found to be a good relationship between area of the implement making contact and penetration force. 4154...|$|R
40|$|If a {{striated}} tool {{such as a}} {{screw driver}} is used to commit a crime, often there is a tool mark left behind as evidence. It is then {{the job of a}} forensic tool mark examiner to compare this crime scene tool mark to tool marks made by a suspect 2 ̆ 7 s tool to determine if they match, i. e were made by the same tool. Forensic tool mark examiners say that these striated tool marks are comprised of 2 ̆ 7 class 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 individual 2 ̆ 7 characteristics where class characteristics are traits common to a large number of tools such as the width of a <b>screwdriver</b> <b>head</b> and individual characteristics are traits unique to a specific tool such as imperfections and wear patterns in the surface of a screwdriver. Examiners first compare marks according to their class characteristics and if they match, they continue to compare the individual characteristics. If the class characteristics do not match, it is concluded the marks were not made by the same tool. Many of the algorithms being developed to remove the subjective nature of an examiner 2 ̆ 7 s comparison ignore the distinction between class and individual characteristics and attempt to directly compare the marks visually, or by applying some quantitative similarity index. We have developed a procedure for comparing tool marks that initially decomposes a digitized tool mark into class and individual components and applies a fixed width window correlation separately to each component. Based on the offsets (or registration) producing the maximized correlation (optimal offsets) and the correlation at the remaining offsets, we formulate hypothesis tests (Different Tool vs. Common Tool) with test statistics and p-values based on the distance between the optimal offsets for the two components, or by setting a threshold for correlations between the individual component series. Additionally, we have developed a simulation based approach for a test based on the maximized correlation between two tool marks. Finally, we review the method of Chumbley et al. (2010) and propose possible improvements...|$|R
