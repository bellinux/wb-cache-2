5|$|According to {{more recent}} analyses, in the {{development}} of nemertean embryos, ectomesoderm (outer part of the mesoderm, which is the layer in which most of the internal organs are built) <b>is</b> <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> cells labelled 3a and 3b, and endomesoderm (inner part of the mesoderm) <b>is</b> <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> the 4d cell. Some of the ectomesoderm in annelids, echiurans and molluscs <b>is</b> <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> cells 3a and 3b, while the ectomesoderm of polyclad flatworms <b>is</b> <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> the 2b cell and acoel flatworms produce no ectomesoderm. In nemerteans the space between the epidermis and the gut is mainly filled by well-developed muscles embedded in noncellular connective tissue. This structure is similar to that found in larger flatworms such as polyclads and triclads, but a similar structure of body-wall muscles embedded in noncellular connective tissue is widespread among the Spiralia (animals in which the early cell divisions make a spiral pattern) such as sipunculans, echiurans and many annelids.|$|E

5|$|As a {{component}} of the female reproductive system, the cervix <b>is</b> <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> the two paramesonephric ducts (also called Müllerian ducts), which develop around the sixth week of embryogenesis. During development, the outer parts of the two ducts fuse, forming a single urogenital canal that will become the vagina, cervix and uterus. The cervix grows in size at a smaller rate than the body of the uterus, so the relative size of the cervix over time decreases, decreasing from being much larger than the body of the uterus in fetal life, twice as large during childhood, and decreasing to its adult size, smaller than the uterus, after puberty. Previously it was thought that during fetal development, the original squamous epithelium of the cervix <b>is</b> <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> the urogenital sinus and the original columnar epithelium <b>is</b> <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> the paramesonephric duct. The point at which these two original epithelia meet is called the original squamocolumnar junction. New studies show, however, that all the cervical as well as large part of the vaginal epithelium are derived from Müllerian duct tissue and that phenotypic differences might be due to other causes.|$|E
