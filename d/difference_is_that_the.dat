5|$|Challenge mode employs similar {{gameplay}} {{to that of}} the Story mode. The <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> gameplay for Challenge mode is faster-paced, {{offers more}} puzzles, and sacrifices any storyline in this mode. It consists of 30 levels and players must fulfill certain conditions before succeeding. Each level lasts only a few minutes, offering more exciting, yet harder, gameplay. The time needed for players to complete a level is recorded in an online leaderboard which can be viewed by other players.|$|E
5|$|Early {{drafts of}} the novel {{entitled}} Trimalchio: An Early Version of The Great Gatsby have been published. A notable difference between the Trimalchio draft and The Great Gatsby is a less complete failure of Gatsby's dream in Trimalchio. Another <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> argument between Tom Buchanan and Jay Gatsby is more even, although Daisy still returns to Tom.|$|E
5|$|Muslim {{women also}} {{generally}} wear similar dresses as the Hindu women. However, the one <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tunic they wear is considerably shorter, just touching the knee. They don a small vest called a angi, worn beneath the bodice. A small shirt or kurta is also common. Hindu men wear an angrakha, long tunic that touches the knees. A cloth waist-band and tight fitting pajama {{and a small}} pagri (top hat) worn {{on top of the}} head completes their ensemble.|$|E
50|$|A-45 based {{technically}} on {{its predecessor}} KB-45. <b>The</b> most significant <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Kirkstall axles <b>were</b> substituted by Sisu's own axles.|$|R
25|$|The 1977 charter was {{virtually}} {{the same as the}} 1976 constitution. <b>The</b> only key <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> name of the junta was changed to the National Policy Council.|$|R
50|$|In 1845, {{under the}} Moderates, Spain {{replaced}} the Constitution of 1837 {{with a new}} constitution; one of <b>the</b> main <b>differences</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Constitution of 1845 narrowed the franchise to {{less than one percent}} of the population.|$|R
5|$|The other {{significant}} <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Lutheran calendar commemorates {{a wider variety}} of individuals than does either of its counterparts. Included on the calendar are musicians and artists who are associated with the Church, but are not typically thought of as “saints” in the classical sense. The intent is to provide a wider venue for commemoration of outstanding individuals who have served the Church through their vocations rather than simply commemorating the outstanding among the religious.|$|E
5|$|The {{second volume}} {{represents}} the ethical stage. Victor Eremita found {{a group of}} letters from a retired Judge Vilhelm or William, another pseudonymous author, to 'A', trying to convince 'A' {{of the value of}} the ethical stage of life by arguing that the ethical person can still enjoy aesthetic values. The <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> pursuit of pleasure is tempered with ethical values and responsibilities.|$|E
5|$|The {{difference}} between teleosts and other bony fish lies mainly in their jaw bones; teleosts have a movable premaxilla and corresponding modifications {{in the jaw}} musculature which {{make it possible for}} them to protrude their jaws outwards from the mouth. This is of great advantage, enabling them to grab prey and draw it into the mouth. In more derived teleosts, the enlarged premaxilla is the main tooth-bearing bone, and the maxilla, which is attached to the lower jaw, acts as a lever, pushing and pulling the premaxilla as the mouth is opened and closed. Other bones further back in the mouth serve to grind and swallow food. Another <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> upper and lower lobes of the tail (caudal) fin are about equal in size. The spine ends at the caudal peduncle, distinguishing this group from other fish in which the spine extends into the upper lobe of the tail fin.|$|E
3000|$|... [...]. <b>The</b> <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{last three}} terms in (19) {{will be changed}} with the {{different}} T in (24). Even so, our BB-MUSIC estimator can still work correctly under the assumptions A 1, A 2 and A 3.|$|R
30|$|The fully {{automated}} system {{was similar to}} the partially automated system in how it was activated and controlled; <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> system also activated <b>the</b> steering, meaning <b>that</b> <b>the</b> drivers could release the steering wheel and did not need to do anything for the 45 -min drive.|$|R
50|$|Dungeons & Dragons Computer Fantasy Game was a 1981 LCD {{handheld}} {{game with}} gameplay influenced by Hunt <b>the</b> Wumpus. <b>Differences</b> <b>were</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> rooms <b>were</b> {{arranged in a}} 10x10 grid identified like spreadsheet cells like 'A1', and {{the goal was to}} find a dragon rather than a wumpus.|$|R
5|$|The primary rooms {{include the}} Lair, Hatchery, Training Room, Library, and the Treasury. These {{have the same}} purpose as the first game: they {{function}} as a resting place, feeding place, training area, research area, and gold storage area respectively. The only major <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Training Room can only train creatures up to experience level four. Further experience can only be gained through real combat, such as fighting in the new Combat Pit, where creatures fight to the death. The higher a creature's experience level, the stronger and more powerful they become. The highest experience level is level ten, and creatures cannot achieve levels nine or ten via the Training Room or Combat Pit.|$|E
5|$|Methods for {{measuring}} retreat include staking terminus location, global positioning mapping, aerial mapping and laser altimetry. The key symptom of disequilibrium is thinning {{along the entire}} length of the glacier. This indicates a diminishment of the accumulation zone. The result is marginal recession of the accumulation zone margin, not just of the terminus. In effect, the glacier no longer has a consistent accumulation zone and without an accumulation zone cannot survive. For example, Easton Glacier in Washington state, U.S. will likely shrink to half its size but at a slowing rate of reduction and stabilize at that size despite the warmer temperature over a few decades. However, the Grinnell Glacier in Montana, U.S. will shrink at an increasing rate until it disappears. The <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> upper section of Easton Glacier remains healthy and snow-covered, while even the upper section of the Grinnell Glacier is bare, is melting and has thinned. Small glaciers with minimal altitude range are most likely to fall into disequilibrium with the climate.|$|E
25|$|The syntax {{is similar}} to the one of constructors. The <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> name is preceded by a ~ and it cannot contain any parameters. There cannot be more than one destructor..|$|E
40|$|UMM {{found another}} {{breakthrough}} in fostering its students’ entrepreneurship. Coordinating with the Department of Economics and Development Studies (IESP), UMM organized Sunday Morning Market just like Pasar Tugu on Semeru Street, Malang. <b>The</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> market called "UMM Sunday Morning Market" was managed by students of UMM...|$|R
2500|$|... where t denotes time. Two key <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> virial theorem relates summed {{rather than}} {{individual}} averages to each other, {{and it does}} not connect them to the temperature T. Another <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> traditional derivations of the virial theorem use averages over time, whereas those of the equipartition theorem use averages over phase space.|$|R
50|$|Aside {{from the}} 11 early {{vehicles}} with a Porsche suspension, the only variant developed was <b>the</b> Sd.Kfz.185. <b>The</b> <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> gun used <b>was</b> the 8.8 cm PaK 43 {{rather than the}} 12.8 cm PaK 44. This was due to shortages of the latter weapon. The variant did not enter service.|$|R
25|$|A moulded door has {{the same}} {{structure}} as that of flush door. The only <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> surface material is a moulded skin made of MDF. Skins can also be made out of hardboards.|$|E
25|$|Another variant {{referred}} to is drawing CRE 1116. This is actually externally indistinguishable from a Type 28A {{designed for a}} 6Pdr. The main <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> dividing wall between the main gun chamber and the infantry chamber has been omitted.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> icons do {{not start}} from the floor level. Altarpieces, that {{were not part of}} the original structure, stand between the holy doors instead. And the lifelike portraits typical of Western style are seldom found on Eastern icon screens.|$|E
50|$|From June 1914 {{a variant}} was {{available}} {{known as the}} 20 hp sports type. <b>The</b> major <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> engine bore <b>is</b> increased to 95 mm. Pistons and connecting rods are lightened and the valves were given a higher lift camshaft. The steering column was given more rake {{to allow for a}} lower seating position.|$|R
25|$|The {{installation}} of the 150hp (112kW) Royal Aircraft Factory 4a air-cooled V12 engine closely resembled <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> B.E.12, with the same large air scoop and similar vertically mounted exhausts protruding over the upper wing to carry the fumes clear of the crew. <b>The</b> only real <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> engine <b>was</b> slightly raked back, to improve {{take off and landing}} characteristics.|$|R
25|$|Unlike other pintails, {{the males}} {{are similar in}} {{appearance}} to the females, though larger. The ducks are 45 to 65cm in length, the males weighing 610 to 660 g, the females 460 to 610 g. Minor <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> male has uniformly brownish-grey upperwing coverts and a glossy greenish-black speculum, while the female has mottled upperwing coverts and a dull brown speculum.|$|R
25|$|There are {{two types}} of hemmed edges: closed hems and open hems. Closed hems are {{completely}} flush while open hems have an air pocket in the bend. The major <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tonnage required for a closed hem is much greater than that for an open hem.|$|E
25|$|One {{significant}} <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Beta Israel {{lacked the}} festivals of Purim and Hanukkah, probably because they branched {{off from the}} main body of Judaism before these non-Biblical holidays began to be commemorated. Today, most members of the Beta Israel community living in Israel do observe these holidays.|$|E
25|$|The second <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> supernatural in {{fantasy is}} by design fictitious. In {{traditional}} tales {{the degree to}} which the author considered the supernatural to be real can span the spectrum from legends taken as reality to myths understood as describing in understandable terms more complicated reality, to late, intentionally fictitious literary works.|$|E
30|$|In Experiment 2, the durations, frequencies, {{and shapes}} of the forward-masker and the probe-tone {{were the same as}} in Experiment 1. <b>The</b> primary <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> masker-probe time gap was held constant, at 3 ms, just beyond the range of the {{physical}} overlap of forward-masker and probe-tone. Such overlap could have allowed listeners to perform discrimination rather than detection.|$|R
5|$|The hemmema's {{design was}} very similar to <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> turuma. <b>The</b> primary <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> turuma's oarsmen sat on the weather deck above the guns, whereas the hemmema's oarsmen sat on the gundeck. The later hemmemas were {{considerably}} larger, more heavily armed, and of a more robust construction. Glete has described them as variations on the same type, especially when considering the pre-war designs.|$|R
50|$|By {{sharing the}} S-IVB upper stage, the Saturn IB and Saturn V {{provided}} a common interface to the Apollo spacecraft. <b>The</b> only major <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> S-IVB on the Saturn V burned {{only part of}} its propellant to achieve Earth orbit, {{so it could be}} restarted for trans-lunar injection. The S-IVB on the Saturn IB needed all of its propellant to achieve Earth orbit.|$|R
25|$|However, one aircraft, an Airbus A321 under {{registration}} N578UW, {{has been}} left unpainted in the US Airways livery, as one of American's heritage aircraft. The only <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> actual US Airways logo {{near the front of}} the fuselage has been replaced with the American Airlines logo; however, the rest of the aircraft remains identical to US Airways livery.|$|E
25|$|A complex yet {{extensive}} {{range of}} visual customization options is available, including body kits, wheels, {{and a full}} range of colors & vinyls, including freehand drawing ability. The most obvious <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> graphics and racing physics in this version are completely different from the other versions, giving it a retro look and feel reminiscent of much older pre-GameCube or Mario Kart type games.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, the {{university}} opened the new Cardinal Court Apartment {{to replace a}} complex by the same name and on the same site built in 1959. Much like the old Cardinal Court, the new Cardinal Court provides apartment-style living combined with the benefits of university housing. Besides simply being more modern, the primary <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> old Cardinal Court had been reserved for married couples and graduate students.|$|E
50|$|Hairy bittercress is {{very similar}} to Cardamine flexuosa. Some <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> stems <b>are</b> hairless and the leaves do not clasp the stems, as in C.flexuosa. It has only 4 stamens, C. flexuosa has 6 stamens, and the fruits overtop the flowers. In C. flexuos the fruits do not overtop the younger flowers. The fruits grow in a thin pod {{arranged}} as a single row.|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} article compares {{a method}} (presented by Salas-Bringas et al 1) using a flow rate equation with the Rabinowitsch method {{to estimate the}} consistency and flow behavior index of a Non-Newtonian fluid in capillary flow. <b>The</b> <b>differences</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> method presented by Salas-Bringas et al 1 gives {{the uncertainty of the}} measurements and requires less number of experiments when different flow rates are measured...|$|R
3000|$|G-IDNC {{can also}} be {{graphically}} modeled [23]. <b>The</b> <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> in <b>the</b> G-IDNC graph G_g(V,E), a data packet p [...]...|$|R
