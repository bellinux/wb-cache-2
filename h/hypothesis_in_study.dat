Yet, {{it is not known}} whether the effect of appearance on voting is more strongly influenced by positive or negative attributions, nor which neural mechanisms subserve this effect. We conducted two independent brain imaging studies to address this question.

Winning candidates elicited no differential activation at all. This suggests that negative attributions from appearance exert greater influence on voting than do positive.

40|$|Past {{research}} indicates that peoples’ implicit theories {{about the nature of}} willpower moderate the ego-depletion effect. Only people who believe or were led to believe that willpower is a limited resource (limited-resource theory) showed lower self-control performance after an initial demanding task. As of yet, the underlying processes explaining this moderating effect by theories about willpower remain unknown. Here, we propose that the exertion of self-control activates the goal to preserve and replenish mental resources (rest goal) in people with a limited-resource theory. Five studies tested this <b>hypothesis.</b> <b>In</b> <b>Study</b> 1, individual differences in implicit theories about willpower predicted increased accessibility of a rest goal after self-control exertion. Furthermore, measured (Study 2) and manipulated (Study 3) willpower theories predicted an increased preference for rest-conducive objects. Finally, Studies 4 and 5 provide evidence that theories about willpower predict actual resting behavior: In Study 4, participants who held a limited-resource theory took a longer break following self-control exertion than participants with a nonlimited-resource theory. Longer resting time predicted decreased rest goal accessibility afterward. In Study 5, participants with an induced limited-resource theory sat longer on chairs in an ostensible product-testing task when they had engaged in a task requiring self-control beforehand. This research provides consistent support for a motivational shift toward rest after self-control exertion in people holding a limited-resource theory about willpower...|$|E

Even for ingroup members, the transition from acquaintances to friends tends to be quite fragile (Lydon, Jamieson & Holmes, 1997). The current research was designed to examine how peoples' failure to view outgroup members as potential friends manifests in biased perceptions of outgroup members who express a desire to socialize and in a reduced likelihood of pursuing acquaintanceships with outgroup members. Study 1 was designed to test the prediction that people will {{be less likely to}} issue an invitation to socialize with an outgroup member compared to an ingroup member. Study 2 was designed to test the prediction that mutual self-disclosure with an outgroup member relative to an ingroup member will less strongly encourage the development of an acquaintanceship. In contrast to these hypotheses, the results of Study 1 showed that White participants did not differ in the likelihood that they would issue an invitation to a Black or White confederate. Also contrary to the <b>hypothesis,</b> <b>in</b> <b>Study</b> 2, high self-disclosure produced more favorable friendship-related attitudes and social behaviors compared to low self-disclosure for participants with Black confederates, while self-disclosure did not impact attitudes or social behaviors for participants with White confederates.

Dissertations, Academic [...] University of Missouri [...] Columbia [...] Psychology. Born and raised in the U. S., children of immigrants often face difficult choices between endorsing their family's country of origin (natal culture) and mainstream U. S. society (host culture). Although second generation immigrants desire to fit into the host society, their parents often demand that they adhere to norms and traditions of the natal culture. Previous studies have shown controlling or non-autonomous parenting to be associated with negative outcomes, so this study sought to demonstrate the role of maternal and paternal autonomy-support in promoting positive and intrinsic natal acculturation among second-generation immigrants. Two studies were conducted to test this <b>hypothesis.</b> <b>In</b> <b>Study</b> 1, college-aged second-generation immigrants were asked to report perceived maternal and paternal autonomy-support, as well as how much they endorse their natal and U.

Study 2 replicated the previously mentioned effects and extended them by considering additional WB, acculturation, and autonomy-support measures. Possible explanations for the significance of paternal over maternal autonomy-support in our data are discussed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTraining {{individuals}} to inhibit their responses towards unhealthy foods {{has been shown}} to reduce food intake relative to a control group. Here we aimed to further explore these effects by investigating the role of stimulus devaluation, training protocol, and choice of control group. Restrained eaters received either inhibition or control training using a modified version of either the stop-signal or go/no-go task. Following training we measured implicit attitudes towards food (Study 1) and food consumption (Studies 1 and 2). In Study 1 we used a modified stop-signal training task with increased demands on top-down control (using a tracking procedure and feedback to maintain competition between the stop and go processes). With this task, we found no evidence for an effect of training on implicit attitudes or food consumption, with Bayesian inferential analyses revealing substantial evidence for the null <b>hypothesis.</b> <b>In</b> <b>Study</b> 2 we removed the feedback in the stop-signal training to increase the rate of successful inhibition and revealed a significant effect of both stop-signal and go/no-go training on food intake (compared to double-response and go training, respectively) with a greater difference in consumption in the go/no-go task, compared with the stop-signal task. However, results from an additional passive control group suggest that training effects could be partly caused by increased consumption in the go control group whereas evidence for reduced consumption in the inhibition groups was inconclusive. Our findings therefore support evidence that inhibition training tasks with higher rates of inhibition accuracy are more effective, but prompt caution for interpreting the efficacy of laboratory-based inhibition training as an intervention for behaviour change...|$|E
