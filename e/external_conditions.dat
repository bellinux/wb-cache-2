40|$|Abstract: The current paper {{defines a}} new {{mathematical}} model of night vision devices choice {{taking into account}} the <b>external</b> surveillance <b>conditions.</b> The night vision device working range is an important NVD parameter influenced by the <b>external</b> surveillance <b>conditions.</b> The developed mathematical model is used to formulate multicriteria combinatorial optimization tasks which solutions provide night vision devices choice based on preliminary theoretical estimation of the device working range under expected <b>external</b> surveillance <b>conditions.</b> Additional user requirement about the preferred working range value is used as restriction in optimization tasks. The practical applicability of the proposed night vision devices choice approach is proved by numerical examples based on real night vision goggles and <b>external</b> surveillance <b>conditions</b> data. The multicriteria combinatorial mixed integer optimization tasks are solved by weighted sum method using the software system LINGO v. 11.

40|$|Despite the {{increasing}} demand for natural colourants, their sensitivity to light is a major disadvantage and could pose restrictions to their utilization as food colourants in industry. Turmeric (Curcuma longa L.) is a tropical plant native to southern and south eastern tropical Asia. The most active colour components in turmeric roots are curcuminoids, which are used in many food and pharmaceutical preparations. However, curcuminoids are unstable and {{have been replaced by}} stable synthetic dyes such as sunset yellow. Hence, {{the purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of storage of turmeric oleoresin with and without protection from <b>external</b> environmental <b>conditions,</b> including sunlight during daytime, on the stability of curcuminoid pigments, measured by high-performance liquid chromatography and correlated with L*a*b* colour space values and colour evaluation by a trained sensory panel. Turmeric oleoresin powders were placed in labelled, clear plastic jars and exposed to <b>external</b> environmental <b>conditions</b> during the day for a period of 10 weeks. Control samples were stored in a refrigerator at 4 °C. To determine the effect of protection of turmeric oleoresin powders from <b>external</b> environmental <b>conditions</b> on curcuminoid stability, jars were covered with aluminium foil and stored outside and exposed to <b>external</b> environmental <b>conditions</b> for a period of 10 weeks. Control samples were refrigerated at 4 °C. Over time of exposure to <b>external</b> environmental <b>conditions,</b> curcuminoid pigment degradation was evidenced, with 100 % degradation observed after 9 weeks of storage, relative to the control. Curcuminoids were less sensitive to degradation when shielded from <b>external</b> environmental <b>conditions,</b> with a 22 % reduction in degradation observed relative to turmeric oleoresin powders without aluminium foil protection after 10 weeks of exposure to <b>external</b> environmental <b>conditions.</b> Significant sensory differences were observed between turmeric oleoresin powders with and without protection from <b>external</b> environmental <b>conditions</b> compared to the control samples. In an attempt to enhance curcuminoid stability in the presence of <b>external</b> environmental <b>conditions,</b> the effect of antioxidants, tertiary butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) and ascorbic acid on the stability of curcuminoid pigments in turmeric oleoresin, was studied. The effect of divalent ion-curcuminoid complexation on the stability of curcuminoid pigments in turmeric oleoresin when exposed to <b>external</b> environmental <b>conditions,</b> was also investigated. Antioxidants were homogenously distributed onto the powdered turmeric oleoresin base at 0. 02 % (m/m). Samples were exposed to <b>external</b> environmental <b>conditions</b> for a period of 10 weeks. According to the total colour difference results (L*, a* and b* values), the addition of both TBHQ and ascorbic acid did not improve the colour stability of the curcuminoid powders after 10 weeks of exposure to <b>external</b> environmental <b>conditions.</b> The presence of ascorbic acid had no significant influence on curcuminoid stability, with the degradation trend following that of the control, which did not contain antioxidants. The effect of complexation of curcumin with divalent ion (Mg 2 +) by mechanical mixing was also investigated. After 10 weeks of exposure to <b>external</b> environmental <b>conditions,</b> no significant improvement in curcuminoid stability was observed after the addition of magnesium ions to turmeric oleoresin powders when compared to the control which did not contain magnesium ions. Correlation analysis was conducted to determine the relationship between percentage curcuminoid degradation, sensory scores and colour ratings of turmeric oleoresin powders that were exposed to <b>external</b> environmental <b>conditions.</b> A strong negative linear relationship was observed between percentage curcuminoid degradation and rating of colour. A perfect positive relationship was observed between chroma and b* values. Chroma also had a strong positive relationship with L*. Percentage curcuminoid degradation showed a weak positive relationship with both a* and hue angle values. Exposure to <b>external</b> environmental <b>conditions</b> negatively affected the colour stability of curcuminoid pigments in turmeric oleoresin powders and the level of pigment degradation was dependent on time of storage. Stabilization strategies investigated in this study, such as Mg 2 +- curcuminoid complexation as well as the addition of antioxidants (TBHQ and ascorbic acid) did not significantly improve curcuminoid stability in turmeric oleoresin powders. Constant storage of ingredients and products containing turmeric oleoresin at low temperature (< 5 °C), together with light protection is vital to retard colour degradation.

25|$|Since the 1990s, much of Chomsky's {{research}} has focused on what he calls the Minimalist Program (MP), in which he departs from much of his past research and instead attempts to simplify language into a system that relates meaning and sound using the minimum possible faculties that could be expected, given certain <b>external</b> <b>conditions</b> that are imposed on us independently. Chomsky dispenses with concepts such as 'deep structure' and 'surface structure' and instead places emphasis on the plasticity of the brain's neural circuits, along with which comes an infinite number of concepts, or 'Logical Forms'. When exposed to linguistic data, the brain of a hearer-speaker then proceeds to associate sound and meaning, and the rules of grammar that we observe are in fact only the consequences, or side effects, of the way that language works. Thus, while much of Chomsky's prior {{research has}} focused on the rules of language, he now focuses on the mechanisms that the brain uses to create these rules.|$|E
