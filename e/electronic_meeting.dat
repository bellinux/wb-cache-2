50|$|An <b>electronic</b> <b>meeting</b> system (EMS) {{is a type}} of {{computer}} software that facilitates creative problem solving and decision-making of groups within or across organizations. The term was coined by Alan R. Dennis et al. in 1988. The term is synonymous with Group Support Systems (GSS) and essentially synonymous with Group Decision Support Systems (GDSS). <b>Electronic</b> <b>meeting</b> systems form a class of applications for computer supported cooperative work.|$|E
50|$|An <b>electronic</b> <b>meeting</b> {{system is}} a suite of {{configurable}} collaborative software tools {{that can be used}} to create predictable, repeatable patterns of collaboration among people working toward a goal. With an <b>electronic</b> <b>meeting</b> system, each user typically has his or her own computer, and each user can contribute to the same shared object (session) at the same time. Thus, nobody needs to wait for a turn to speak and people don't forget what they want to say while they are waiting for the floor. When a group or a group's host deem it appropriate, people can contribute anonymously to most <b>electronic</b> <b>meeting</b> systems tools: this allows the group to focus on the content of ideas, rather than their sources.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Facilitation and {{guidance}} of computer-supported meetings {{is a well-known}} activity that can be supported electronically. Various forms of facilitator support have been developed over the years. This paper presents a unique method for meeting guidance for formal, distributed <b>electronic</b> <b>meetings</b> {{in the form of}} meeting guides. The method is Web-based and applies the meeting agenda for creation of agenda support points by both the chairperson and secretarius. Meeting guides provide other functionality such as meeting reminder creation and application and meeting guidance instructions.

40|$|The use of {{anonymity}} has {{been attributed to}} be {{a major factor in the}} success of <b>electronic</b> <b>meetings,</b> contributing to greater participation, more and better comments, and higher satis faction. Several studies have attempted to measure its affect on meetings, but none has investi gated non-anonymous, pseudo-anonymous, and anonymous treatments in the same experiment. A study using these three types of groups in <b>electronic</b> <b>meetings</b> to discuss a relatively non-controversial topic revealed no statistically significant difference in the number of comments generated per person, level of process satisfaction, and other self-perceived measures...|$|R

40|$|The {{need for}} {{effective}} facilitation in Group Support Systems (GSS) environments is well documented. Results from {{recent studies of}} facilitation in face-to-face <b>electronic</b> <b>meetings</b> have demonstrated that more and different research is required before we have {{a clearer picture of}} GSS facilitation. The training of GSS facilitators has been acknowledged as an important issue in GSS research but, up to now, has received little research attention. This paper describes an experiential learning approach to the training of facilitators for face-to-face <b>electronic</b> <b>meetings.</b> It begins with a description of the nature of GSS facilitation training. The experiential learning method of training is then explained. Finally, the GSS facilitation training program is described...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{focuses on}} the use of {{groupware}} to support local governments in activities in the intelligence cycle. Local governments in The Netherlands have a central role in developing integral safety plans for their district. However, in the implementation of safety plans the contribution of partner organizations such as the fire department and police force is indispensable. Each of the partners may have its own priorities with regard to safety. Using <b>electronic</b> <b>meetings,</b> representatives of all partner organizations identify safety problems within their district and decide on the priority of issues. In two meetings of four hours each, safety problems are analyzed and conclusions formulated to which partners feel committed. This article describes the design of the meetings and reports on results for nine municipalities. Results indicate that participants find that the <b>electronic</b> <b>meetings</b> contribute to intelligence activities. Participants feel the quality of communication in the sessions is high, and their insight into the problem is increased. The sessions support dissemination of intelligence, as shown by an increase in consensus on the problem and commitment to conclusions. <b>Electronic</b> <b>meetings</b> therefore seem an effective and practical way to support key activities in the intelligence cycle, and to develop policies that will be implemented...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} a secure collaborative application for conducting real-time <b>electronic</b> <b>meetings</b> from remote locations. The application consists of a set of tools, enabling common meeting tasks to be accomplished. The tools can be enhanced with security services at will. The security architecture comprises the standardized communication security services [14], as well as the "group oriented" security services which we defined in [13]. Such security architecture is especially suitable for enterprises with a defined internal organizational policy, which has to be supported and enforced by adequate security mechanisms.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an ongoing {{research}} project, consisting of formalizing rules of order for group decision making, and implementing them as a procedural component of automated mediation systems for group decision making. The component should ultimately assist a human mediator in maintaining order at <b>electronic</b> <b>meetings,</b> and in giving advice to the participants on their options, rights and obligations in the decision making process. A main requirement for the system is that order can be maintained in a exible way, allowing to set the rules aside when needed. This paper presents the rst research result of the project: a way of formalizing rules of order {{that makes it possible}} to maintain order in such a exible way. 1 Introduction 1. 1 Background <b>Electronic</b> <b>meetings</b> are an important object of research in Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW).

50|$|The {{software}} was first developed in Sydney, Australia, {{under the name}} Grouputer.

50|$|The main {{difference}} from groupware is {{the intensity of}} collaboration. According to Lubich's classification, groupware supports collaboration within groups where the individual contributions remain identifiable. In contrast, EMS enable the group to cooperatively produce a result for which the group is responsible as a whole. In a business process, groupware and <b>electronic</b> <b>meeting</b> systems complement each other: Groupware supports teams when researching and creating documents in the run up to an EMS session or when implementing the results of such a session.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies of}} {{multilingual}} <b>electronic</b> <b>meetings</b> {{have shown that}} members often comprehend the automatic translations, but accuracy is affected by errors in the source comments. However, no study has investigated to what extent these text errors reduce understanding. An experiment with six groups of students showed that participants were able to comprehend translations from German to English, even when the source text contained 5 % word errors, but translations from source comments with no errors were understood better. Further, the differences in comprehension affected students’ perceptions of the system’s ease of use and usefulness...|$|R

Results show that, as in smaller groups, members of <b>electronic</b> <b>meetings</b> experience less production blocking and evaluation apprehension and generate more total comments, relevant comments, and words per comment.

As a solution, we propose a fully automated multilingual meeting system, and an example of its use in a meeting with Chinese, Korean, and English comments shows its potential to reduce multinational communication barriers...|$|R
