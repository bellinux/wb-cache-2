25|$|Before {{the mine}} was {{connected}} to the National Grid in 1938, all operations which were not done by hand (or by horse) depended ultimately on water power. In many cases this was used directly, to <b>power</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>engines,</b> water wheels or water turbines. In other cases it was used to run an air compressor to power the rock drills, or small winding engines, and from 1890 it was used to generate electricity.|$|R
25|$|Two {{processing}} mills {{were built}} {{to crush the}} ore and separate out the galena from it, and the mine had its own smelt mill between 1828 and 1917, but after {{that it was more}} economical to sell concentrated galena to a commercial smelter. Machinery in the mine and the mills was powered by the plentiful water supplies in the area, used to drive water wheels and <b>power</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>engines,</b> and, after 1890, to generate hydroelectricity. Dozens of carts transported supplies to the mine's remote location, and carried the lead out. In the early 1900s the mine set up its own road haulage business using two steam wagons.|$|R
50|$|Transmission was 8 speed {{through a}} single clutch with {{the option of}} the Allis-Chalmers half shaft clutch to achieve 'live' power take-off. Converging three point linkage was <b>powered</b> by an <b>engine</b> mounted {{hydraulic}} pump giving <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> whenever the <b>engine</b> was running regardless of transmission status. An hydraulic weight transfer system was built in to increase traction and a simple mechanical depth stop was provided on the earlier machines. Later machines, introduced mid-1963 and called 'Depthomatic' had a draught and position control system. Other modifications and options included improved gear ratios; a pick-up hitch; an increase in power through higher maximum revs and revised battery arrangement. An option on both models was the patent Allis-Chalmers PAVT rear wheels (Power Adjusted Variable Track),a system adopted by other manufacturers after patents expired. Production ended in 1968 and quite a few are still in use on farms in 2011. A few ED40s were exported to the USA. It's hard to say exactly how many {{made it to the}} US, but it seems most of them ended up in the Mid-Atlantic and South Eastern regions.|$|R

50|$|The Unimog 435 is {{the first}} heavy duty Unimog series which has an ″edgy″ cab. It is {{designed}} as a 7,5-ton truck. Like other Unimogs it has a ladder frame, portal axles and screw springs. The Unimog 435 was built with two different wheelbases, 3.250 mm and 3.850 mm. It is a rear wheel drive vehicle with switchable all wheel drive. The gearbox is a fully synchronized 8-speed manual gearbox with lockable differentials. A reduction gear and a crawler gear were available as additional accessory. Depending on the built in gear box and portal axle final drive ratio the top speed is between 80 and 110 km/h. The brake system uses compressed air to activate the dual hydraulic circuit disk brakes. A compressed air trailer brake system was an additional accessory. An engine brake was available as well. The Unimog 435 uses <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> steering. The <b>engines</b> in the Unimog 435 are naturally aspirated or turbocharged Mercedes-Benz OM 353 series engines. Starting in 1987 Mercedes-Benz used the OM 366 engine instead.|$|R

The emergence of electrical power during the 20th century meant hydraulic networks were gradually superseded; the Hull company was wound up in 1947 while the final London pumping station ceased operation in 1977.|$|R

40|$|Pigs {{have been}} {{reported}} to present with a stronger pulmonary vascular reactivity than many other species, including dogs. We investigated the pulmonary vascular impedance response to autologous blood clot embolic pulmonary hypertension in anesthetized and ventilated minipigs (n = 6) and dogs (n = 6). Before embolization, minipigs, compared with dogs, presented with higher mean pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa; by an average of 9 mmHg), a steeper slope of Ppa-flow (Q) relationships, and higher 0 -Hz impedance (Z 0) and first-harmonic impedance (Z 1), without significant differences in characteristic impedance (Zc), and a lower ratio of pulsatile <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> to total <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power.</b> Embolic pulmonary hypertension (mean Ppa: 40 - 55 mmHg) was associated with increased Z 0 and Z 1 in both species, but the minipigs had a steeper slope of Ppa/Q plots and an increased Zc. At identical Q and Ppa, minipigs still presented with higher Z 1 and Zc and a lower ratio of pulsatile <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> to total <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power.</b> The energy transmission ratio, defined as the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> in the measured waves divided by the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> in the forward waves, was better preserved after embolism in minipigs. No differences in wave reflection indexes were found before and after embolism. We conclude that minipigs, compared with dogs, present with a higher pulmonary vascular resistance and reactivity and adapt to embolic pulmonary hypertension by an increased Zc without earlier wave reflection. These differences allow for a reduced pulsatile component of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> and, therefore, a better energy transfer from the right ventricle to the pulmonary circulation.
