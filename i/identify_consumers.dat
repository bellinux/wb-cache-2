An individual with a credit score above 750 has better bargaining power with the lenders, since he is perceived as a responsible borrower. Since consumers can now access their Credit Scores and CIRs directly from CIBIL at the cost of INR 500, they can see for themselves how they are perceived by the lenders before applying for a loan. Hence, CIBIL empowers both loan providers and individuals to see their financial and credit history more clearly and hence, take better and more informed decisions.|$|E

50|$|In 1986, {{one year}} after {{resuming}} her PhD work, Dickersin was diagnosed with invasive breast cancer. This led to her starting a breast cancer support group, Arm-in-Arm, with Marsha Oakley, and engagement in national and international consumer advocacy work, as a founding mother of the National Breast Cancer Coalition in 1991. Her papers related {{to the start of}} the NBCC are at the Schlesinger Library in Cambridge, Massachusetts. As the only scientist on the Board of Directors of the NBCC, Dickersin initiated a series of “teach-ins” for the Board designed to expose Board members to the underlying concepts in biology and epidemiology that they would need to be active contributors to the research agenda. Teaching faculty included Francis Collins and others. This project expanded in 1995 to Project LEAD, a flagship science education program offered by NBCC to consumer advocates and still active in 2014. Her longstanding support for consumer and patient engagement in the research process is also evident from her involvement in the Department of Defense (DoD) Breast Cancer Programme. In 2003, Dickersin initiated a coalition of consumer and health advocacy groups (later named Consumers United for Evidence-based Healthcare or CUE. The idea behind CUE was to bring together consumer groups, who traditionally have not worked together, to form a professional organization for learning and networking. In addition to serving these functions, CUE helps scientist groups to <b>identify</b> <b>consumers</b> for meaningful engagement in research and on advisory and guideline panels.|$|E
50|$|Before {{the court}} applied this test to the facts, the court {{emphasized}} what facts {{were not at}} hand. It noted that defendants' use of PEI's marks to trigger the listing of PEI sites, and other sites that legitimately use PEI's marks, was not at issue. In addition, it noted {{that it is not}} addressing a situation in which a banner advertisement clearly identified its source with its sponsor's name, or in which a search engine clearly identifies a banner advertisement's source. The court stated that it also did not address a situation in which advertisers or defendants overtly compare PEI's products to a competitor's—saying, for example “if you are interested in Playboy, you may also be interested in the following message fromdifferent, named company.” Rather, the court acknowledged it was evaluating a situation in which defendants display competitors' unlabeled banner advertisements, with no label or overt comparison to PEI, after Internet users type in PEI's trademarks. PEI v. WellesThe situation with which the court was dealing runs afoul of the first requirement for nominative use. Accordingly, it did not consider the other prongs.Defendants could have used other words, besides PEI's marks, to trigger adult-oriented banner advertisements. Indeed, it was found that they already did so. The list they sold to advertisers included over 400 terms besides PEI's marks. There is nothing indispensable, in this context, about PEI's marks. Defendants did not wish to identify PEI or its products when they key banner advertisements to PEI's marks. Rather, they wished to <b>identify</b> <b>consumers</b> who are interested in adult-oriented entertainment so they can draw them to competitors' websites. Accordingly, their use is not nominative. Thus, the court reversed the district court's grant of summary judgment based on nominative use.|$|E

40|$|The {{market for}} {{consumer}} information {{is already a}} lively market, where consumer information and consumer profile data are often among the most valuable assets owned by online retailers. The value of such commodity derives from the ability of firms to <b>identify</b> <b>consumers</b> and charge them personalized prices [1].

In this paper, we propose a negotiation process between an online consumer agent and an online seller. The online consumer agent acts on behalf of consumers to maximize their social welfare. In our model, the agent derives a quantified privacy risk for each private data and uses it to determine a cost premium value to make the bargaining process manageable.

40|$|Online {{information}} {{search is}} often seen as a highly utilitarian task but consumers' increasingly diverse ways of using the Web have brought forth more hedonic information search patterns. At the same time, the impact of electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) on consumer purchase decisions is increasing. The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate the differences between hedonic and utilitarian eWOM search patterns in the light of purchase value. Using survey data from 1660 customers of two travel agencies and structural equation modeling, the study finds that hedonic information search promotes the utilization of eWOM in buying decisions and that eWOM has a greater influence on buying among high-spenders. The findings suggest that hedonic information seekers form an important and valuable customer group and, thus, should be at the focus of online marketing and selling. Companies should encourage customers to search for valuable and experiential eWOM content and create metrics to <b>identify</b> <b>consumers</b> that do so based on their online information search behavior...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the main}} tasks of {{conjoint}} analysis is to <b>identify</b> <b>consumer</b> preferences about potential products or services. Accordingly, different estimation methods have been proposed to determine the corresponding relevant attributes. Most of these approaches rely on the post-processing of the estimated preferences to establish the importance of such variables. This paper presents new techniques that simultaneously <b>identify</b> <b>consumer</b> preferences and the most relevant attributes. The proposed approaches have two appealing characteristics. Firstly, they are grounded on a support vector machine formulation that has proved important predictive ability in operations management and marketing contexts and secondly they obtain a more parsimonious representation of consumer preferences than traditional models. We report {{the results of an}} extensive simulation study that shows that unlike existing methods, our approach can accurately recover the model parameters as well as the relevant attributes. Additionally, we use two conjoint choice experiments whose results show that the proposed techniques have better fit and predictive accuracy than traditional methods and that they additionally provide an improved understanding of customer preferences.
