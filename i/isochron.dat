40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>isochrons</b> {{is crucial for}} the {{analysis}} of asymptotically periodic systems. Roughly, <b>isochrons</b> are sets of points that partition the basin of attraction of a limit cycle according to the asymptotic behavior of the trajectories. The computation of global <b>isochrons</b> (in the whole basin of attraction) is however difficult, and the existing methods are inefficient in high-dimensional spaces. In this context, we present a novel (forward integration) algorithm for computing the global <b>isochrons</b> of high-dimensional dynamics, which is based on the notion of Fourier time averages evaluated along the trajectories. Such Fourier averages in fact produce eigenfunctions of the Koopman semigroup associated with the system, and <b>isochrons</b> are obtained as level sets of those eigenfunctions. The method is supported by theoretical results and validated by several examples of increasing complexity, including the 4 -dimensional Hodgkin-Huxley model. In addition, the framework is naturally extended to the study of quasiperiodic systems and motivates the definition of generalized <b>isochrons</b> of the torus. This situation is illustrated in the case of two coupled Van der Pol oscillators. © 2012 American Institute of Physics. Peer reviewe...|$|R
25|$|Many {{believers in}} young Earth creationism– a {{position}} {{held by the}} majority of proponents of flood geology– accept biblical chronogenealogies (such as the Ussher chronology, which in turn is based on the Masoretic version of the Genealogies of Genesis). They believe that God created the universe approximately 6000 years ago, in the space of six days. Much of creation geology is devoted to debunking the dating methods used in anthropology, geology, and planetary science that give ages in conflict with the young Earth idea. In particular, creationists dispute the reliability of radiometric dating and <b>isochron</b> analysis, both of which are central to mainstream geological theories of the age of the Earth. They usually dispute these methods based on uncertainties concerning initial concentrations of individually considered species and the associated measurement uncertainties caused by diffusion of the parent and daughter isotopes. A full critique of the entire parameter-fitting analysis, which relies on dozens of radionuclei parent and daughter pairs, has not been done by creationists hoping to cast doubt on the technique.|$|E

Since {{the ratio of the}} daughter and non-radiogenic isotopes is proportional to the ratio of the parent and non-radiogenic isotopes, the slope of the <b>isochron</b> gets steeper with time. The change in slope from initial conditions—assuming an initial <b>isochron</b> slope of zero (a horizontal <b>isochron)</b> at the point of intersection (intercept) of the <b>isochron</b> with the y-axis—to the current computed slope gives the age of the rock.

50|$|<b>Isochron</b> dating is {{a common}} {{technique}} of radiometric dating and is applied to date certain events, such as crystallization, metamorphism, shock events, and differentiation of precursor melts, {{in the history of}} rocks. <b>Isochron</b> dating can be further separated into mineral <b>isochron</b> dating and whole rock <b>isochron</b> dating; both techniques are applied frequently to date terrestrial and also extraterrestrial rocks (meteorites). The advantage of <b>isochron</b> dating as compared to simple radiometric dating techniques is that no assumptions are needed about the initial amount of the daughter nuclide in the radioactive decay sequence. Indeed, the initial amount of the daughter product can be determined using <b>isochron</b> dating. This technique can be applied if the daughter element has at least one stable isotope other than the daughter isotope into which the parent nuclide decays.|$|E

40|$|Phase {{sensitivity}} analysis {{is a powerful}} method for studying (asymptotically periodic) bursting neuron models. One popular way of capturing phase sensitivity is through the computation of <b>isochrons</b> [...] -subsets of the state space that each converge to the same trajectory on the limit cycle. However, the computation of <b>isochrons</b> is notoriously difficult, especially for bursting neuron models. In [W. E. Sherwood and J. Guckenheimer, SIAM J. Appl. Dyn. Syst., 9 (2010), pp. 659 [...] 703], the phase sensitivity of the bursting Hindmarsh [...] Rose model is studied {{through the use of}} singular perturbation theory: cross sections of the <b>isochrons</b> of the full system are approximated by those of fast subsystems. In this paper, we complement the previous study, providing a detailed phase {{sensitivity analysis}} of the full (three-dimensional) system, including computations of the full (two-dimensional) <b>isochrons.</b> To our knowledge, this is the first such computation for a bursting neuron model. This was made possible thanks to the numerical method recently proposed in [A. Mauroy and I. Mezić, Chaos, 22 (2012), 033112] [...] -relying on the spectral properties of the so-called Koopman operator [...] -which is complemented with the use of adaptive quadtree and octree grids. The main result of the paper is to highlight the existence of a region of high phase sensitivity called the almost phaseless set and to completely characterize its geometry. In particular, our study reveals the existence of a subset of the almost phaseless set that is not predicted by singular perturbation theory (i. e., by the <b>isochrons</b> of fast subsystems). We also discuss how the almost phaseless set is related to empirically observed phenomena such as addition/deletion of spikes and to extrema of the phase response of the system.
