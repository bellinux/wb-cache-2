25|$|There is a {{significant}} evidence–practice gap {{in the treatment of}} CHF; particularly the underuse of ACE inhibitors and β-blockers and aldosterone antagonists which have been shown to provide mortality benefit. Treatment of CHF aims to relieve symptoms, to maintain a euvolemic state (normal <b>fluid</b> <b>level</b> in the circulatory system), and to improve prognosis by delaying progression of heart failure and reducing cardiovascular risk. Drugs used include: diuretic agents, vasodilator agents, positive inotropes, ACE inhibitors, beta blockers, and aldosterone antagonists (e.g., spironolactone). Some drugs which increase heart function, such as the positive inotrope milrinone, lead to increased mortality, and are contraindicated.|$|E
25|$|One {{distinctive}} {{advantage of}} PID controllers is that two PID controllers {{can be used}} together to yield better dynamic performance. This is called cascaded PID control. In cascade control there are two PIDs arranged with one PID controlling the setpoint of another. A PID controller acts as outer loop controller, which controls the primary physical parameter, such as <b>fluid</b> <b>level</b> or velocity. The other controller acts as inner loop controller, which reads the output of outer loop controller as setpoint, usually controlling a more rapid changing parameter, flowrate or acceleration. It can be mathematically proven that the working frequency of the controller is increased and the time constant of the object is reduced by using cascaded PID controllers..|$|E
500|$|Alongside the deleted scenes, Kelly also {{superimposed}} {{pages from}} the fictional book The Philosophy of Time Travel, which {{had previously been}} available on the film's official website, onto the film. Kelly had written these passages after he had finished shooting, and explained that their inclusion was to help the film [...] "operate on a more logical, <b>fluid</b> <b>level,</b> a bit more as the science fiction film that [...] always intended it to be". The text introduces new concepts {{that had previously been}} unmentioned in the original release. According to The Philosophy of Time Travel, much of the film's plot takes place in an unstable [...] "Tangent Universe", a duplicate of the [...] "Primary Universe" [...] from which Donnie originates. Donnie is described as being the [...] "Living Receiver", and is granted superpowers such as strength, telekinesis and premonition. Donnie's task {{over the course of the}} film is to return the jet engine (called the [...] "Artifact" [...] in the book) to the Primary Universe to avert a disaster. During his quest, he is aided by [...] "The Manipulated Living" [...] and [...] "The Manipulated Dead", who are the other characters in the film. These plot points received criticism from reviewers, who objected to the narrative's new lack of ambiguity. Jonathan Dean of Total Film described them as [...] "unsatisfactory" [...] and [...] "handholding". In an interview, Kelly stated that the pages had been created [...] "as an exercise in interpretation", and that they were not necessarily intended to be viewed as canon.|$|E

40|$|Background: {{serum level}} of amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, a cardiac hormone {{produced}} by the heart, is elevated in patients with left ventricular dysfunction. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the abilities of serum and pericardial <b>fluid</b> <b>levels</b> of amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide to detect the left ventricular systolic dysfunction determined by echocardiography. Methods: 50 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting were included in this study. Left ventricular systolic function was assessed using echocardiography before coronary artery bypass grafting. The samples of serum and pericardial fluid were collected during surgery, and amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels were assessed by an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. The log value of amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide concen-trations was calculated. Results: the pericardial <b>fluid</b> <b>levels</b> of log amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide were significantly elevated compared to the serum levels in patients with impaired left ventricular systolic function. Both serum and pericardial <b>fluid</b> <b>levels</b> of log amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide correlated significantly with left ventricular ejection fraction and end-diastolic and end-systolic volume indices. Furthermore, a paired comparison of receiver operating characteristic curves showed a similar performance of amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels both in serum and pericardial fluid to discriminate left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Conclusion: serum amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels have comparable diagnostic value for left ventricular systolic dysfunction with its pericardial <b>fluid</b> <b>levels</b> in patients undergoing CABG...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} ability of 5 {{cerebrospinal}} fluid (CSF) biomarkers to differentiate between common dementia and parkinsonian disorders. Design: A cross-sectional, clinic-based study. Participants: Cerebrospinal fluid samples (N= 453) were obtained from healthy individuals serving as controls and from patients with Parkinson disease (PD), PD with dementia (PDD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), Alzheimer disease (AD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), multiple system atrophy (MSA), or corticobasal degeneration (CBD). Setting: Neurology and memory disorder clinics. Main Outcome Measures: Cerebrospinal <b>fluid</b> biomarker <b>levels</b> in relation to clinical diagnosis. Results: Cerebrospinal <b>fluid</b> <b>levels</b> of alpha-synuclein were decreased in patients with PD, PDD, DLB, and MSA but increased in patients with AD. Cerebrospinal <b>fluid</b> <b>levels</b> of beta-amyloid 1 - 42 were decreased in DLB and even further decreased in AD. Cerebrospinal <b>fluid</b> <b>levels</b> of total tau and hyperphosphorylated tau were increased in AD. Multivariate analysis revealed that these biomarkers could differentiate AD from DLB and PDD with an area under the curve of 0. 90, with alpha-synuclein and total tau contributing most to the model. Cerebrospinal <b>fluid</b> <b>levels</b> of neurofilament light chain were substantially increased in atypical parkinsonian disorders (ie, PSP, MSA, and CBD), and multivariate analysis revealed {{that the level of}} neurofilament light chain alone could differentiate PD from atypical parkinsonian disorders, with an area under the curve of 0. 93. Conclusions: Ascertainment of the alpha-synuclein level in CSF somewhat improves the differential diagnosis of AD vs DLB and PDD when combined with established AD biomarkers. The level of neurofilament light chain alone may differentiate PD from atypical parkinsonian disorders...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To prospectively {{evaluate}} follicular <b>fluid</b> <b>levels</b> of vascular endothelial {{growth factor}} in women undergoing IVF cycles and {{to investigate the}} correlation of these levels with ovarian response to gonadotropins and with uterine or ovarian Doppler findings. Design: Prospective study. Setting: University hospital. Patient(s) : 41 patients undergoing ART {{were divided into two}} groups according to response to ovarian stimulation protocols: poor responders (n = 18) and normoresponders (n = 23). Intervention(s) : Doppler analysis of perifollicular arteries and assay of follicular fluid vascular endothelial growth factor. Main Outcome Measure(s) : During ovarian stimulation, patients underwent hormonal (E 2), ultrasonographic (follicular number and diameter, endometrial thickness) and Doppler (uterine and perifollicular arteries) evaluation. Serum and follicular fluid concentrations of vascular endothelial growth factor were assayed in each female patient. Result(s) : Compared with poor responders, more oocytes were collected and more embryos were transferred but follicular <b>fluid</b> <b>levels</b> of vascular endothelial growth factor levels were lower in normoresponders. Follicular <b>fluid</b> <b>levels</b> of vascular endothelial growth factor were inversely correlated with number of oocytes retrieved. Poor responders had significantly higher uterine and perifollicular Doppler flow resistances. The pregnancy rate per cycle was significantly higher in normoresponders (26 %) than poor responders (6 %). Conclusion(s) : Elevated follicular <b>fluid</b> <b>levels</b> of vascular endothelial growth factor concentrations are associated with poor ovarian response and a very low pregnancy rate.

These compounds were serially analysed in serum and ascitic fluid by ELISA in patients with SBP (n = 20), non-infected cirrhotic controls (n = 12), and healthy controls (n = 15). Infected and non-infected cirrhotic patients showed significantly higher serum levels of adhesion molecules. SBP was associated with significantly higher serum and ascitic <b>fluid</b> <b>levels</b> of IL- 8, Gro-α and ICAM- 1 and with ascitic fluid concentrations of MCP- 1.
