500|$|Sonic Adventure 2 {{received}} critical acclaim, {{with scores}} of 89 from review aggregator Metacritic. Critics appreciated the game's multiple playing styles. According to Edge and reviewer Four-Eyed Dragon of GamePro, the core game's three styles and bonus features such as Chao gardens made the game engaging to play. Johnny Liu of Game Revolution praised its replay value of multiple playing styles and 180 different goals. Anthony Chau of IGN called it [...] "one of the best Sonic games ever": [...] "If {{this is the last}} Sonic game in these declining Dreamcast years, it's satisfying to know that the DC didn't <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> bang, but with a sonic boom." ...|$|E
500|$|The soap's {{executive}} producer, Susan Bower, {{revealed that}} the team wanted Mark [...] "to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> bang" [...] and they took inspiration from the US drama 24 to create a special real-time episode. The show's script producer thought the technique was [...] "the {{best way to do}} justice" [...] to the character and his exit, although it proved to be a challenge for the crew as it was different from the normal storytelling process. [...] "Episode 6188" [...] focused on a 30-minute timeframe between 6:30pm and 7:00pm, which is when Neighbours is broadcast in Australia. The episode was filmed over two nights and extra effort went into ensuring the continuity was right throughout.|$|E
500|$|Mark's {{departure}} {{was shown}} during a special real-time episode, {{which focused on}} a 30-minute timeframe. Executive producer Susan Bower revealed that the team wanted Mark [...] "to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> bang" [...] and commented that while the episode features about half a dozen people, it is mostly about Mark and Kate. The show's script producer, Emma Gordon, agreed that the real-time episode was [...] "the {{best way to do}} justice" [...] to the character and his exit. McGregor explained that while the producers were planning his character's exit, they took inspiration from the US drama 24. Gordon admitted to Tiffany Fox from The West Australian that the technique was a real challenge for Neighbours. She said [...] "It is a bit different and a bit out of our normal storytelling process but it gives such a sense of tension which is exactly the feeling we wanted to create. When you have half an hour to make a decision that will affect the rest of your life, every excruciating minute counts." ...|$|E

500|$|On 7 July 2008, media {{reported}} that Ganguly was being projected {{as a candidate}} for the post of President of the Cricket Association of Bengal(CAB) against his former mentor Jagmohan Dalmiya. Reports also suggested that he could run for the post of BCCIPresident in 2014 as East Zone's representative. Ganguly himself did not deny the reports and did not rule out any such move. The same year in October, Ganguly announced that the Test series against Australia starting in October 2008 would be his last and stated [...] "o be honest, I didn't expect to be picked for this series. Before coming here, [...] I spoke to my team-mates and hopefully I will <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> winning knock." [...] Ganguly played in every game of the four-Test series and amassed 324 runs at an average of 54.00. While playing the second Test match of the series in Mohali, Ganguly scored his final test century. In the final test match he played at Nagpur against Australia he scored 85 and 0 in his first and second innings respectively. In the Fourth and final Test, with India needing one wicket to secure a victory, the Indian captain, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, invited Ganguly to lead the side in the field for the final time. India regained the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, winning the series 2–0.|$|E
2500|$|The Mishnah {{interpreted}} {{the prohibition of}} animals working in [...] (20:10 in the NJPS) to teach that on the Sabbath, animals could wear their tethers, and their caretakers could lead them by their tethers and sprinkle or immerse them with water. The Mishnah taught that a donkey could <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> saddle cushion tied to it, rams strapped, ewes covered, and goats with their udders tied. Rabbi Jose forbade all these, except covering ewes. Rabbi Judah allowed goats {{to go out with}} their udders tied to dry, but not to save their milk. The Mishnah taught that animals could not <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> pad tied to their tails. A driver could not tie camels together and pull one of them, but a driver could take the leads of several camels in hand and pull them. The Mishnah prohibited donkeys with untied cushions, bells, ladder–shaped yokes, or thongs around their feet; fowls with ribbons or leg straps; rams with wagons; ewes protected by wood chips in their noses; calves with little yokes; and cows with hedgehog skins or straps between their horns. The Mishnah reported that Rabbi Eleazar ben Azariah's cow used to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> thong between its horns, but without the consent of the Rabbis.|$|E
2500|$|Nonetheless, {{the early}} years of their {{relationship}} were difficult, as Wrangler and Whiting struggled with Wrangler's homosexuality. When Wrangler shouted at her in a restaurant that he was gay, Whiting responded, [...] "only around the edges, dear." [...] Wrangler explained in an interview : [...] "When I got with Margaret, I knew I had to change course. She would have my bags packed and sitting outside the door when I got home at night and things like that. Plus I would go through massive guilt whenever I did <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> guy and I was with her. So I finally said that's it. I went to her one night and said I'm never going to cheat on you again with anybody. So my sex life became very masturbatory. And I'm good at that-very good at that, in fact.". The couple was married from 1994 until his death.|$|E

2500|$|Michael Hogan of The Telegraph {{noted that}} [...] "Capaldi {{is back to}} his charismatic best" [...] in [...] "The Pilot", stating [...] "devoted Whovian is keen to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> bang", and {{described}} his character as [...] "mercurial, magical and kind". Patrick Mulkern praised Sarah Dollard's writing of the Doctor in [...] "Thin Ice", noting how she [...] "examines his moral code; the ideals he aspires to and the crimes and misdemeanors he's prepared to indulge". Capaldi's performance in [...] "Extremis" [...] received praise, with Alasdair Wilkins stating [...] "Peter Capaldi is perilously close to becoming my unqualified pick for favorite Doctor, he underplays the moment, making small choices to signal both his compassion and his heartbreak". He also praised the interactions between him and Missy, noting how they recall [...] "a more emotionally complex version of the repartee that Jon Pertwee’s Doctor and Roger Delgado’s Master had during their many encounters". Patrick Mulkern praised Capaldi’s performance in [...] "The Lie of the Land" [...] proclaiming [...] "he wavers between downright nasty and at best disconcerting. He’s world-weary — specifically, Earth-weary. You can almost believe he’s working for the dark side, so great is his disenchantment with the human race". After the broadcast of World Enough and Time, Steven Moffat paid a special tribute to Capaldi, “Peter only has to think at the screen {{and you know what}} he’s thinking,” he said. “He only has to move his face and I know the particular blend of Scottish torment he’s feeling right now. Despite trying to fight his emotions, he has given us the most emotional Doctor.” [...] Capaldi received overwhelming praise for his performance in [...] "The Doctor Falls" [...] with Patrick Mulkern noted the episode as a story dedicated to the character and how he [...] "stands tall", along with Daniel Jackson of the Daily Mirror highlighting the twelfth Doctor, praising how he [...] "simply shines". Flickering Myth stated [...] "Peter Capaldi is a magnificent Doctor, a person who captures the wisdom, madness, caring and frustration of a two-thousand year old Time Lord". Digital Spy praised Capaldi's [...] "Where I stand is where I fall" [...] speech, noting it as quite possibly the actor's finest moment to date. Simon Brew of Den of Geek heavily praised the actor's performance stating: [...] "The majestic, wonderful, brilliant Peter Capaldi. If you needed a reminder of just how much he’s going to be missed when he finally departs Doctor Who {{at the end of the}} year, his outstanding work here was precisely that. When he was blasted, apparently mortally, and he kept holding off his regeneration I found myself saying out loud “I don’t want you to go”". Ross Ruediger of New York Magazine agreed, admitting that [...] "the man’s been a revelation. I love Peter Capaldi. He has without a doubt been my Doctor for this new incarnation of Doctor Who that’s wrapping up its tenth season, and we have been nothing short of fortunate to have been blessed with his talents. I don’t want you to go either, Peter".|$|E
