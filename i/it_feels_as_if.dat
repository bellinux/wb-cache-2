500|$|Reviewers {{were divided}} {{as to the}} merits of the novel's ending. Andy Smith lamented that the finale of the [...] "mostly intriguing" [...] novel was [...] "distinctly anticlimactic". Tim Martin wrote that it seemed [...] "somehow less {{than the sum of its}} parts". Clay Evans {{dismissed}} it as [...] "not especially meaningful, but fun", whereas Matt Thorne found it lacking [...] "a traditional thriller's excitement". San Francisco Chronicle reviewer Michael Berry called it [...] "an ingenious reversal" [...] which proved that despite its apparent cynicism, the novel was [...] "oddly optimistic for a ghost story". Overall, Thorne judged the novel ultimately unsatisfactory on account of the underwhelming ending and because Gibson [...] "hides the full complications of the plot so successfully that <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> everything important is happening offstage". Roger Perkins judged the novel to be [...] "a triumph of style over substance – which is exactly the way you suspect that Gibson wants it." [...] His colleague Martin mused that along with the regular Gibsonian tropes, there was [...] "something new ... a dark and very contemporary surge of suspicion and bad faith" [...] in the novel which suggested that the author might be approaching the apex of his writing. Dan Conover concluded that while the [...] "darkly comic satire" [...] was [...] "a worthy addition to the Gibson canon and a significant cultural artifact", it would not rank among the author's best works.|$|E

The good old couple were amaz'd, And often on each other gaz'd; For both were frighten'd to the heart, And just began to cry, [...] "What art!" [...] Then softly turn'd aside, to view Whether the lights were burning blue. The gentle pilgrims, soon aware on't, Told them their calling and their errand: [...] "Good folk, you need not be afraid, We are but saints," [...] the hermits said; [...] "No hurt shall come to you or yours: But for that pack of churlish boors, Not fit to live on Christian ground, They and their houses shall be drown'd; While you shall see your cottage rise, And grow a church before your eyes."

The jack and chimney, near ally'd, Had never left each other's side; The chimney to a steeple grown, The jack would not be left alone; But, up against the steeple rear'd, Became a clock, and still adher'd; And still its love to household cares, By a shrill voice at noon, declares, Warning the cookmaid not to burn That roast meat, which it cannot turn.

His talk was now of tithes and dues: Could smoke his pipe, and read the news; Knew how to preach old sermons next, Vamp'd in the preface and the text; At christ'nings well could act his part, And had the service all by heart; Wish'd women might have children fast, And thought whose sow had farrow'd last; Against dissenters would repine, And stood up firm for [...] "right divine;" [...] Found his head fill'd with many a system; But classic authors,--he ne'er mist 'em.

So many beggars pass this way, We can't be quiet, night nor day; We cannot serve you every one; Pray take your answer, and be gone." [...] One swore he'd send 'em to the stocks; A third could not forbear his mocks; But bawl'd as loud as he could roar [...] "You're {{on the wrong side of}} the door!"

[...] To a small kilderkin of beer, Brew'd for the good time of the year, Philemon, by his wife's consent, Stept with a jug, and made a vent, And having fill'd it to the brink, Invited both the saints to drink. When they had took a second draught, Behold, a miracle was wrought; For, Baucis with amazement found, Although the jug had twice gone round, It still was full up to the top, As they ne'er had drunk a drop. You may be sure so strange a sight, Put the old people in a fright: Philemon whisper'd to his wife, [...] "These men are--Saints--I'll lay my life!" [...] The strangers overheard, and said, [...] "You're in the right--but be'nt afraid: No hurt shall come to you or yours: But for that pack of churlish boors, Not fit to live on Christian ground, They and their village shall be drown'd; Whilst you shall see your cottage rise, And grow a church before your eyes."
