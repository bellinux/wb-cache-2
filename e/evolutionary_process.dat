Ecological factors such as habitat type, climate, prey specialization, and predatory competition {{have been shown to}} greatly influence gray wolf craniodental plasticity, which is an adaptation of the cranium and teeth due to the influences of the environment. Similarly, the dire wolf was a hypercarnivore, with a skull and dentition adapted for hunting large and struggling prey; the shape of its skull and snout changed across time, and changes in the size of its body have been correlated to climate fluctuations.|$|E

Henson told the Associated Press in 1982 that The Dark Crystal characters evolved directly from his Saturday Night Live creations. Henson described the <b>evolutionary</b> <b>process</b> from The Land of Gorch to Dark Crystal, saying that because The Land of Gorch was featured on late-night television, it helped {{expand the scope}} of his puppets, including risqué behavior. He described the challenge that motivated him to further develop concepts from The Land of Gorch on Dark Crystal, saying his next motivation was to draft a universe of puppets for a feature film without humans.|$|E
5|$|Purebred {{wild species}} evolved to a {{specific}} ecology can be threatened with extinction {{through the process of}} genetic pollution, the uncontrolled hybridization, introgression genetic swamping which leads to homogenization or out-competition from the heterosic hybrid species. When new populations are imported or selectively bred by people, or when habitat modification brings previously isolated species into contact, extinction in some species, especially rare varieties, is possible. Interbreeding can swamp the rarer gene pool and create hybrids, depleting the purebred gene pool. For example, the endangered wild water buffalo is most threatened with extinction by genetic pollution from the domestic water buffalo. Such extinctions are not always apparent from a morphological standpoint. Some degree of gene flow is a normal <b>evolutionary</b> <b>process,</b> nevertheless, hybridization threatens the existence of rare species.|$|E
5|$|The {{necessary}} use of heuristics {{for multiple}} alignment means that for an arbitrary set of proteins, {{there is always}} a good chance that an alignment will contain errors. For example, an evaluation of several leading alignment programs using the BAliBase benchmark found that at least 24% of all pairs of aligned amino acids were incorrectly aligned. These errors can arise because of unique insertions into one or more regions of sequences, or through some more complex <b>evolutionary</b> <b>process</b> leading to proteins that do not align easily by sequence alone. As the number of sequence and their divergence increases many more errors will be made simply because of the heuristic nature of MSA algorithms. Multiple sequence alignment viewers enable alignments to be visually reviewed, often by inspecting the quality of alignment for annotated functional sites on two or more sequences. Many also enable the alignment to be edited to correct these (usually minor) errors, in order to obtain an optimal 'curated' alignment suitable for use in phylogenetic analysis or comparative modeling.|$|E

30|$|Many <b>evolutionary</b> <b>processes</b> {{are subject}} to short {{temporary}} perturbations that are negligible compared to the process duration. Thus the perturbations act instantaneously {{in the form of}} impulses. For example, biological phenomena involving thresholds, bursting rhythm models in pathology, optimal control of economic systems, frequency-modulated signal processing systems do exhibit impulse effects. Impulsive differential systems provide a natural description of observed <b>evolutionary</b> <b>processes</b> with impulse effects.|$|R
40|$|Nested structure, {{which is}} non-random, {{controls}} cooperation dynamics and biodiversity in plant-animal mutualistic networks. This structural pattern has been {{explained in a}} static (non-growth) network models. However, <b>evolutionary</b> <b>processes</b> might also influence the formation of such a structural pattern. We thereby propose an evolving network model for plant-animal interactions and show that non-random patterns such as nested structure and heterogeneous connectivity are both qualitatively and quantitatively predicted through simple <b>evolutionary</b> <b>processes.</b> This finding implies that network models can be simplified by considering <b>evolutionary</b> <b>processes,</b> and also that another explanation exists {{for the emergence of}} non-random patterns and might provide more comprehensible insights into the formation of plant-animal mutualistic networks from the evolutionary perspective.

Veblen believed that technological developments would eventually lead to a socialist economy, but his views on socialism and the nature of the <b>evolutionary</b> <b>process</b> of economics differed sharply from Karl Marx's. While Marx saw socialism as the immediate precursor to communism and the ultimate goal for civilization to be achieved by the working class, Veblen saw socialism as an intermediate phase in an ongoing <b>evolutionary</b> <b>process</b> in society that would arise due to natural decay of the business enterprise system.|$|E
