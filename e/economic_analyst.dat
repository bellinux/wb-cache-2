25|$|In an {{interview}} with <b>economic</b> <b>analyst</b> and commentator Neil Cavuto on Fox News Channel, June 26, 2007, in speaking of income tax resistance, Paul said that he supports the right of those who engage in nonviolent resistance when they believe a law is unjust, bringing up the names of Martin Luther King, Jr., Lysander Spooner, and Mahatma Gandhi as examples of practitioners of peaceful civil disobedience; but he cautioned that those who do {{should be aware that}} the consequences could be imprisonment. He said that current income tax laws assume that people are guilty and they must then prove they are innocent, and he believes this aspect of tax law is unfair. However, he said that he prefers to work for improved tax laws by getting elected to Congress and trying to change the laws themselves rather than simply not paying the tax.|$|E
25|$|The most {{prominent}} <b>economic</b> <b>analyst</b> {{of law is}} 1991 Nobel Prize winner Ronald Coase, whose first major article, The Nature of the Firm (1937), argued {{that the reason for}} the existence of firms (companies, partnerships, etc.) is the existence of transaction costs. Rational individuals trade through bilateral contracts on open markets until the costs of transactions mean that using corporations to produce things is more cost-effective. His second major article, The Problem of Social Cost (1960), argued that if we lived in a world without transaction costs, people would bargain with one another to create the same allocation of resources, regardless of the way a court might rule in property disputes. Coase used the example of a nuisance case named Sturges v Bridgman, where a noisy sweetmaker and a quiet doctor were neighbours and went to court to see who should have to move. Coase said that regardless of whether the judge ruled that the sweetmaker had to stop using his machinery, or that the doctor {{had to put up with}} it, they could strike a mutually beneficial bargain about who moves that reaches the same outcome of resource distribution. Only the existence of transaction costs may prevent this. So the law ought to pre-empt what would happen, and be guided by the most efficient solution. The idea is that law and regulation are not as important or effective at helping people as lawyers and government planners believe. Coase and others like him wanted a change of approach, to put the burden of proof for positive effects on a government that was intervening in the market, by analysing the costs of action.|$|E

40|$|<b>Economic</b> <b>analysts</b> within {{government}} agencies {{as well as}} outside government has played a noticeable and increasing role in formulating U. S. climate policy. However, that role has remained limited; in particular, economic analysis has largely been ignored and occasionally even derided {{in the context of}} setting targets for GHG control. This paper explores this uneasy relationship between analysis and policy during several U. S. administrations. Some of these problems stem from the incompleteness of the economic analyses themselves, and <b>economic</b> <b>analysts</b> sometimes have not been the most effective advocates for their own findings. However, I think one of the biggest obstacles to more effective use of economic analysis in climate policymaking has been a basic lack of desire among many policymakers for the fruits of the analyses. This reluctance has been especially marked when the economic analysis clashes with strongly held preconceptions – from either side – about what climate policy ought to be. climate change, Kyoto Protocol, Council of Economic Advisers...|$|R
