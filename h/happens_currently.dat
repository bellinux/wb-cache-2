It is the foundation upon which all development <b>happens.</b> <b>Currently,</b> Manhattan’s transportation options are centered on {{the tyranny of the}} automobile; its development options are based on the suburban result. Progress in Manhattan’s future will depend on having a transportation system that can weather the storm of peak oil and provide expanded travel options. The master plan provides for densification within an urban growth boundary, to help support the emergence of a finely-grained multimodal transportation system. The system, centered on a new “Union Station” transit hub near the original Union Pacific Depot, will include buses, streetcars, intercity rail, and bicycles. Citizens of the future Manhattan will be able to walk or bike to the nearest transit stop, and seamlessly travel from any point in the city to any other, and connect to interurban streetcars to Keats and Riley, or Ogden and Junction City, or intercity rail to places such as Kansas City, Denver, and beyond. Moving people will only be one part of the equation, however. The master plan will also include locating a regional intermodal freight facility with easy hybrid or electrically powered truck access to the denser core of the city. The interurban streetcar lines will be fundamental in bringing the agricultural bounty of outlying Eco-Villages into the city for consumption and processing. With a sustainable, low-energy and varied transport system in place, Manhattan {{will continue to be a}} prospering and growing city to 2050 and beyond...|$|E
40|$|Corrosion {{is one of}} {{the most}} terrifying {{incidents}} that engineers does not want on the pipeline, especially when involving billion of dollars losses. Many industries depended on the pipeline for transporting their raw material or products from the places of source to the place of treatment and finally to the consumers. Among the industries that widely used the function of pipeline were oil and gas industries, water treatment and also crude oil industries. Therefore, as the most important part in transportation role, pipeline need to be ensured always in great condition and anything that could cause damages to these railways must be control immediately before unwanted accident <b>happens.</b> <b>Currently,</b> there were report that said pipeline damages was very dangerous to the environment whether to the human being or to the nature. There were some human fatality and body damages of the environment that caused billion of dollars losses. Due to all consequences that would occur in the future as the punishment for the lack of information on the conservation of pipelines, the research based on this problem will be done to find out the cause of buried pipelines damages due to the soil. The research will focus on the soil properties and its effects towards the corrosion of carbon steel pipeline. The parameters that will be the variables in this research are clay content, moisture content, pH value and also particles size of soil. Relationship between these parameters with the corrosion rate will be investigated properly. The pipelines samples will be taken from actual segment and will be buried in different condition of soil based on previous parameters. About 180 samples plates will be buried for at least 5 months to get the real corrosion rate for different type of soil condition. Once a month the retrieval procedure will be done to check the rate of corrosion and also to ensure the soil properties remain stables as been set up. After all the samples had been retrieve from its medium of different soil conditions, the data will be interpreted in form of tables and graph to shows different parameters will get different results. The result from linear regression analysis and also using excel analysis had shown that the pH parameter were could accept the hypothesis of pH condition were the major influence in corrosion rate phenomenon while others had rejected the hypothesis to become the major influence. The ANOVA analysis also shown the correlation coefficient of all the parameters were high but only the pH condition were satisfy the significance value with lower than 0. 05. The pH condition, moisture and clay parameter could be study further while the particles size particles does not suitable for further stud...|$|E

Additionally, cardiac monitoring that may indicate early abnormal cardiac changes in a patient is expensive. Consequently, it is desirable for doctors, and support systems, to detect myocardial damage from the standard parameters collected for ICU patients. In this study, we have developed a model to predict myocardial damage based on cardiovascular derangements occurring before the damage. This model was developed through a series of knowledge acquisition sessions with ICU clinicians. An initial evaluation indicated that the model could predict myocardial damage in 87. 5...|$|R

40|$|Predicting future {{values of}} Quality of Service (QoS) {{attributes}} {{can assist in}} the control of software intensive systems by preventing QoS violations before they <b>happen.</b> <b>Currently,</b> many approaches prefer Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models for this task, and assume the QoS attributes’ behavior can be linearly modeled.

To address this limitation, we propose an automated forecasting approach that integrates linear and nonlinear time series models and automatically, without human intervention, selects and constructs the best suitable forecasting model to fit the QoS attributes’ dynamic behavior. Using real-world QoS datasets of 800 web services we evaluate the applicability, accuracy, and performance aspects of the proposed approach, and results show that the approach outperforms the popular existing ARIMA models and improves the forecasting accuracy by on average 35. 4 %...|$|R

40|$|AbstractNewcastle disease virus (NDV) {{belonging}} to the Paramyxovirinae subfamily {{is one of the}} most devastating pathogens in poultry. Although vaccines are widely applied to control the infection, outbreaks of Newcastle disease (ND) repeatedly <b>happen.</b> <b>Currently,</b> there are no alternative control measures available for ND. In the present study, we found that sulfated Chuanmingshen violaceum polysaccharide (sCVPS) were potent inhibitors of NDV in specific pathogen free chickens infected with a virulent strain. With sCVPS treatment, the survival rate increased by almost 20 % and virus titers in test organs, including brain, lung, spleen and thymus, were significantly decreased. The sCVPS also exhibited the ability to prevent viral transmission by reducing the amount of virus shed in saliva and feces. Higher concentrations of interferon α and γ in serum were detected in chickens treated with sCVPS, indicating that one of the antiviral mechanisms may be attributed to the property of immunoenhancement. Histopathological examination showed that sCVPS could alleviate the tissue lesions caused by NDV infection. These results suggest that sCVPS are expected to be a new alternative control measure for NDV infection and further studies could be carried out to evaluate the antiviral activity of sCVPS against other paramyxoviruses...|$|R

It is suggested that these improvements will {{be the result of}} adopting a regionally effective proactive approach to safety policy formulation and management. A proactive approach is grounded on a formal process of identifying, assessing and evaluating accident risks, and adjusting policies or management practices before accidents <b>happen.</b> <b>Currently,</b> maritime safety is globally regulated by internationally agreed prescriptive rules, which are usually revised in reaction to accidents. The proactive Formal Safety Assessment (FSA) is applied to risks common to a ship type or to a particular hazard, when deemed necessary, whereas regional FSA applications are rare. An extensive literature review was conducted in order to examine the opportunities for developing a framework for the GoF for handling regional risks at regional level. Best practices were sought from nuclear safety management and fisheries management, and from a particular case related to maritime risk management. A regional approach that sees maritime safety as a holistic system, and manages it by combining a scientific risk assessment with stakeholder input to identify risks and risk control options, and to evaluate risks is proposed. A regional risk governance framework can improve safety by focusing on actual regional risks, designing tailor-made safety measures to control them, enhancing a positive safety culture in the shipping industry, and by increasing trust among all involved...|$|R
