5|$|Another {{explanation}} surmised is that Wagner did not consent {{because he}} felt he was not receiving just compensation from the ATC for <b>his</b> <b>baseball</b> card. Wagner had a history of being a tough negotiator; he had announced his retirement from baseball in December 1907, but returned shortly {{before the start of the}} 1908 baseball season after receiving a $10,000 contract, double his salary from the 1907 season. This theory has its flaws, however, since Wagner sent Gruber a check for $10 to compensate him for the fee ATC would have paid him if Wagner had given permission to create <b>his</b> <b>baseball</b> card. Michael O'Keeffe and Teri Thompson, authors of The Card: Collectors, Con Men, and the True Story of History's Most Desired Baseball Card, asked why Wagner would compensate Gruber for $10, a substantial amount of money at the time (approximately equal to $275 in 2016), if he refused authorization for monetary reasons. The ATC had already produced a number of T206 Honus Wagner baseball cards; the exact number is unknown, but is speculated to be between 50 and 200. They stopped production of the card, however, after Wagner denied authorization.|$|E
