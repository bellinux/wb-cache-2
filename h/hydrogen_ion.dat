5|$|In 1902 Victor Henri {{proposed}} a quantitative theory of enzyme kinetics, {{but at the}} time the experimental significance of the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>ion</b> concentration was not yet recognized. After Peter Lauritz Sørensen had defined the logarithmic pH-scale and introduced the concept of buffering in 1909 the German chemist Leonor Michaelis and his Canadian postdoc Maud Leonora Menten repeated Henri's experiments and confirmed his equation, which is now generally referred to as Michaelis-Menten kinetics (sometimes also Henri-Michaelis-Menten kinetics). Their work was further developed by G. E. Briggs and J. B. S. Haldane, who derived kinetic equations that are still widely considered today a starting point in modeling enzymatic activity.|$|E
5|$|Seawater is {{slightly}} alkaline {{and had a}} preindustrial pH of about 8.2. More recently, anthropogenic activities have steadily increased the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere; about 30–40% of the added CO2 is absorbed by the oceans, forming carbonic acid and lowering the pH (now below 8.1) through a process called ocean acidification. on the CaCO3 System in the Oceans| journal = Science| volume = 305| issue = 5682| pages = 362–6| year = 2004| last1 = Feely | first1 = R.

5|$|The 1s1 {{electron}} configuration of hydrogen, while superficially {{similar to that}} of the alkali metals (ns1), is unique because there is no 1p subshell. Hence it can lose an electron to form the hydron H+, or gain one to form the hydride ion H−. In the former case it resembles superficially the alkali metals; in the latter case, the halogens, but the differences due to the lack of a 1p subshell are important enough that neither group fits the properties of hydrogen well. Group 14 is also a good fit in terms of thermodynamic properties such as ionisation energy and electron affinity, but makes chemical nonsense because hydrogen cannot be tetravalent. Thus none of the three placements are entirely satisfactory, although group 1 is the most common placement (if one is chosen) because the hydron is by far the most important of all monatomic hydrogen species, being the foundation of acid-base chemistry. As an example of hydrogen's unorthodox properties stemming from its unusual {{electron configuration}} and small size, the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>ion</b> is very small (radius around 150fm compared to the 50–220pm size of most other atoms and ions) and so is nonexistent in condensed systems other than in association with other atoms or molecules. Indeed, transferring of protons between chemicals is the basis of acid-base chemistry. Also unique is hydrogen's ability to form hydrogen bonds, which are an effect of charge-transfer, electrostatic, and electron correlative contributing phenomena. While analogous lithium bonds are also known, they are mostly electrostatic. Nevertheless, hydrogen can take on the same structural role as the alkali metals in some molecular crystals, and has a close relationship with the lightest alkali metals (especially lithium).|$|E
50|$|The {{concentration}} of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>ions</b> {{in the waters}} of Fishing Creek near Bloomsburg between 2002 and 2012 ranged from 0.00001 to 0.00153 milligrams per liter. The date of the lowest {{concentration of}} <b>hydrogen</b> <b>ions</b> at that location was on March 1 and July 16, 2003. The date of the highest concentration of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>ions</b> at the location on the creek was December 17, 2003. The average concentration of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>ions</b> was 0.0001 milligrams per liter.|$|R

25|$|An acid–base {{reaction}} is, thus, {{the removal}} of a <b>hydrogen</b> <b>ion</b> from the acid and its addition to the base. The removal of a <b>hydrogen</b> <b>ion</b> from an acid produces its conjugate base, which is the acid with a <b>hydrogen</b> <b>ion</b> removed. The reception of a proton by a base produces its conjugate acid, which is the base with a <b>hydrogen</b> <b>ion</b> added.|$|E
25|$|ATP {{hydrolysis}} is used {{to transport}} hydrogen ions against the electrochemical gradient (from low to high <b>hydrogen</b> <b>ion</b> concentration). Phosphorylation of the carrier protein and the binding of a <b>hydrogen</b> <b>ion</b> induce a conformational (shape) change that drives the hydrogen ions to transport against the electrochemical gradient. Hydrolysis of the bound phosphate group and release of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>ion</b> then restores the carrier to its original conformation.|$|E
25|$|Water is also {{central to}} acid-base {{neutrality}} and enzyme function. An acid, a <b>hydrogen</b> <b>ion</b> (H+, that is, a proton) donor, can be neutralized by a base, a proton acceptor {{such as a}} hydroxide ion (OH−) to form water. Water {{is considered to be}} neutral, with a pH (the negative log of the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>ion</b> concentration) of 7. Acids have pH values less than 7 while bases have values greater than 7.|$|E
50|$|Hyperaldosteronism - Renal loss of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>ions</b> {{occurs when}} excess {{aldosterone}} (Conn's syndrome) increases {{the activity of}} a sodium-hydrogen exchange protein in the kidney. This increases the retention of sodium <b>ions</b> whilst pumping <b>hydrogen</b> <b>ions</b> into the renal tubule. Excess sodium increases extracellular volume {{and the loss of}} <b>hydrogen</b> <b>ions</b> creates a metabolic alkalosis. Later, the kidney responds through the aldosterone escape to excrete sodium and chloride in urine.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Hydrogen</b> <b>ions</b> {{are formed}} from the {{dissociation}} of carbonic acid. Water {{is a very}} minor source of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>ions</b> in comparison to carbonic acid. Carbonic acid is formed from carbon dioxide and water by carbonic anhydrase.|$|R
5000|$|When pH is too high, the {{concentration}} of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>ions</b> in the blood is too low, so the kidneys excrete bicarbonate (...) [...] This causes the equation to shift right, essentially increasing {{the concentration}} of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>ions,</b> causing a more acidic pH.|$|R
25|$|In this example, a water {{molecule}} {{is split}} into a <b>hydrogen</b> <b>ion,</b> which is donated to a pyridine molecule, and an hydroxide ion.|$|E
25|$|A {{substance}} {{can often}} be classified as an acid or a base. There are several different theories which explain acid-base behavior. The simplest is Arrhenius theory, which states than an acid is a substance that produces hydronium ions when it is dissolved in water, and a base is one that produces hydroxide ions when dissolved in water. According to Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory, acids are substances that donate a positive <b>hydrogen</b> <b>ion</b> to another substance in a chemical reaction; by extension, a base is the substance which receives that <b>hydrogen</b> <b>ion.</b>|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} approach, ion semiconductor sequencing, {{is based}} on standard DNA replication chemistry. This technology measures {{the release of a}} <b>hydrogen</b> <b>ion</b> each time a base is incorporated. A microwell containing template DNA is flooded with a single nucleotide, if the nucleotide is complementary to the template strand it will be incorporated and a <b>hydrogen</b> <b>ion</b> will be released. This release triggers an ISFET ion sensor. If a homopolymer is present in the template sequence multiple nucleotides will be incorporated in a single flood cycle, and the detected electrical signal will be proportionally higher.|$|E
50|$|At 25 °C an aqueous {{solution}} {{that has a}} pH of 3.5 has 10−3.5 moles H+ (<b>hydrogen</b> <b>ions)</b> per litre of solution (and also 10−10.5 mole/litre OH−). A pH of 7, defined as neutral, has 10−7 moles <b>hydrogen</b> <b>ions</b> per litre of solution and also 10−7 moles of OH− per litre; since the two concentrations are equal, {{they are said to}} neutralise each other. A pH of 9.5 has 10−9.5 moles <b>hydrogen</b> <b>ions</b> per litre of solution (and also 10−2.5 mole per litre OH−). A pH of 3.5 has one million times more <b>hydrogen</b> <b>ions</b> per litre than a solution with pH of 9.5 (9.5 - 3.5 = 6 or 106) and is more acidic.|$|R
5000|$|Alkali {{error range}} - at low {{concentration}} of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>ions</b> (high values of pH) contributions of interfering alkali metals (like Li, Na, K) are comparable with the one of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>ions.</b> In this situation dependence of the potential on pH become non-linear.|$|R
50|$|NiMH {{cells have}} an {{alkaline}} electrolyte, usually potassium hydroxide. The positive electrode is nickel hydroxide, {{and the negative}} electrode is <b>hydrogen</b> <b>ions,</b> or protons. The <b>hydrogen</b> <b>ions</b> are stored in a metal-hydride structure that is the electrode. Hydrophilic polyolefin nonwovens are used for separation.|$|R
25|$|Ammonia is {{important}} for normal animal acid/base balance. After formation of ammonium from glutamine, α-ketoglutarate may be degraded to produce two molecules of bicarbonate, which are then available as buffers for dietary acids. Ammonium is excreted in the urine, resulting in net acid loss. Ammonia may itself diffuse across the renal tubules, combine with a <b>hydrogen</b> <b>ion,</b> and thus allow for further acid excretion.|$|E
25|$|Let's {{say that}} for at a certain {{ionization}} voltage, a singly charged <b>hydrogen</b> <b>ion</b> acquires a resulting velocity of Xms−1. A singly charged deuterium ion under the sample conditions would have acquired roughly X/1.41ms−1. If a detector was {{placed at a distance}} of 1m, the ion flight times would be 1/X and 1.41/Xs. Thus, the time of the ion arrival can be used to infer the ion type itself, if the evaporation time is known.|$|E
25|$|Although at {{the time}} of Millikan's oil-drop {{experiments}} it was becoming clear that there exist such things as subatomic particles, not everyone was convinced. Experimenting with cathode rays in 1897, J. J. Thomson had discovered negatively charged 'corpuscles', as he called them, with a charge-to-mass ratio 1840 times that of a <b>hydrogen</b> <b>ion.</b> Similar results had been found by George FitzGerald and Walter Kaufmann. Most of what was then known about electricity and magnetism, however, could be explained on the basis that charge is a continuous variable; {{in much the same way}} that many of the properties of light can be explained by treating it as a continuous wave rather than as a stream of photons.|$|E

50|$|In 1903, Christian Bohr {{described}} the phenomenon, {{now called the}} Bohr effect, whereby <b>hydrogen</b> <b>ions</b> and carbon dioxide heterotopically decrease hemoglobin's oxygen-binding affinity.

25|$|A second-generation {{approach}} to controlled fusion power involves combining helium-3 (32He) and deuterium (21H). This reaction produces a helium-4 ion (42He) (like an alpha particle, but of different origin) and a high-energy proton (positively charged <b>hydrogen</b> <b>ion)</b> (11p). The most important potential {{advantage of this}} fusion reaction for power production {{as well as other}} applications lies in its compatibility with the use of electrostatic fields to control fuel ions and the fusion protons. High speed protons, as positively charged particles, can have their kinetic energy converted directly into electricity, through use of solid-state conversion materials as well as other techniques. Potential conversion efficiencies of 70% may be possible, as {{there is no need to}} convert proton energy to heat in order to drive a turbine-powered electrical generator.|$|E
25|$|As {{hydrogen}} peroxide enters the active site, it {{interacts with the}} amino acids Asn148 (asparagine at position 148) and His75, causing a proton (<b>hydrogen</b> <b>ion)</b> to transfer between the oxygen atoms. The free oxygen atom coordinates, freeing the newly formed water molecule and Fe(IV)=O. Fe(IV)=O reacts with a second {{hydrogen peroxide}} molecule to reform Fe(III)-E and produce water and oxygen. The reactivity of the iron center may be improved {{by the presence of}} the phenolate ligand of Tyr358 in the fifth coordination position, which can assist in the oxidation of the Fe(III) to Fe(IV). The efficiency of the reaction may also be improved by the interactions of His75 and Asn148 with reaction intermediates. In general, the rate of the reaction can be determined by the Michaelis-Menten equation.|$|E
25|$|Like mitochondria, chloroplasts use the {{potential}} energy stored in an H+, or <b>hydrogen</b> <b>ion</b> gradient to generate ATP energy. The two photosystems capture light energy to energize electrons taken from water, and release them down an electron transport chain. The molecules between the photosystems harness the electrons' energy to pump hydrogen ions into the thylakoid space, creating a concentration gradient, with more hydrogen ions (up {{to a thousand}} times as many) inside the thylakoid system than in the stroma. The hydrogen ions in the thylakoid space then diffuse back down their concentration gradient, flowing {{back out into the}} stroma through ATP synthase. ATP synthase uses the energy from the flowing hydrogen ions to phosphorylate adenosine diphosphate into adenosine triphosphate, or ATP. Because chloroplast ATP synthase projects out into the stroma, the ATP is synthesized there, in position {{to be used in the}} dark reactions.|$|E

25|$|Energy {{needed to}} perform short lasting, high {{intensity}} bursts of activity {{is derived from}} anaerobic metabolism within the cytosol of muscle cells, as opposed to aerobic respiration which utilizes oxygen, is sustainable, and occurs in the mitochondria. The quick energy sources consist of the phosphocreatine (PCr) system, fast glycolysis, and adenylate kinase. All of these systems re-synthesize adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the universal energy source in all cells. The most rapid source, but the most readily depleted of the above sources is the PCr system which utilizes the enzyme creatine kinase. This enzyme catalyzes a reaction that combines phosphocreatine and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) into ATP and creatine. This resource is short lasting because oxygen {{is required for the}} resynthesis of phosphocreatine via mitochondrial creatine kinase. Therefore, under anaerobic conditions, this substrate is finite and only lasts between approximately 10 to 30 seconds of high intensity work. Fast glycolysis, however, can function for approximately 2 minutes prior to fatigue, and predominately uses intracellular glycogen as a substrate. Glycogen is broken down rapidly via glycogen phosphorylase into individual glucose units during intense exercise. Glucose is then oxidized to pyruvate and under anaerobic condition is reduced to lactic acid. This reaction oxidizes NADH to NAD, thereby releasing a <b>hydrogen</b> <b>ion,</b> promoting acidosis. For this reason, fast glycolysis can not be sustained for long periods of time. Lastly, adenylate kinase catalyzes a reaction by which 2 ADP are combined to form ATP and adenosine monophosphate (AMP). This reaction takes place during low energy situations such as extreme exercise or conditions of hypoxia, but is not a significant source of energy. The creation of AMP resulting from this reaction stimulates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMP kinase) which is the energy sensor of the cell. After sensing low energy conditions, AMP kinase stimulates various other intracellular enzymes geared towards increasing energy supply and decreasing all anabolic, or energy requiring, cell functions.|$|E
