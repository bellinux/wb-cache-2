It has been suggested that there are complicated interactions between the epithelium and stroma in the endometrium during menstrual cycle. In this study, we demonstrate a difference in gene expression between the epithelial and stromal areas of the secretory human endometrium using microdissection and macroarray technique. Methods The epithelial and stromal areas were microdissected from the human endometrium during the secretory phase. RNA was extracted and amplified by PCR. Macroarray analysis of nearly 1000 human genes was carried out in this study. Some genes identified by macroarray analysis were verified using real-time PCR.

On the other hand, decorin (55. 6 fold), discoidin domain receptor member 2 (17. 3 fold), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (9 fold), ribosomal protein S 3 A (6. 3 fold), and tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin and epidermal growth factor homology domains (5. 2 fold) were strongly expressed in the stromal areas.

The {{aim of this study}} was to measure the effects of controlled loading on the release of extracellular matrix protease activities by fibroblasts. Fibroblast populated collagen lattices were subjected to external cyclical loads through a computer controlled unit incorporated into a culture system, a tensioning-Culture Force Monitor. Cyclical loading was compared to untensioned and statically loaded gels (tethered endogenous contraction). Overall changes in a range of protease activities were monitored (chiefly by zymography) as measures of the cyto-mechanical response to these loads. Under static load, 2. 5 - and 13 -fold more matrix metalloproteinase- 2 was produced than matrix metalloproteinase- 9, at 24 and 48 hours. Total matrix metalloproteinase- 9 increased 37 fold on cyclical loading. Total matrix metalloproteinase- 3 and urokinase plasminogen activator activities were dramatically reduced on cyclical loading while tissue type plasminogen activator activity was increased. Comparison with cell responses on stiffer substrates (collagen sponges) identified similar matrix metalloproteinase responses to load, but at much reduced levels (4 - 6 <b>fold</b> <b>matrix</b> metalloproteinase- 9 stimulation on loading), showing the importance of matrix compliance to this mechano-response. In conclusion, physiological mechanical loading of fibroblasts in three dimensional collagen lattices elicited complex and substantial changes in matrix modifying proteases.

40|$|With the aim {{to study}} the {{relationship}} between protein sequences and their native structures, we adopt vectorial representations for both sequence and structure. The structural representation {{is based on the}} Principal Eigenvector of the <b>fold's</b> contact <b>matrix</b> (PE). As recently shown, the latter encodes sufficient information for reconstructing the whole contact matrix. The sequence is represented through a Hydrophobicity Profile (HP), using a generalized hydrophobicity scale that we obtain from the principal eigenvector of a residue-residue interaction matrix and denote it as interactivity scale. Using this novel scale, we define the optimal HP of a protein fold, and predict, by means of stability arguments, that it is strongly correlated with the PE of the <b>fold's</b> contact <b>matrix.</b> This prediction is confirmed through an evolutionary analysis, which shows that the PE correlates with the HP of each individual sequence adopting the same fold and, even more strongly, with the average HP of this set of sequences. Thus, protein sequences evolve {{in such a way that}} their average HP is close to the optimal one, implying that neutral evolution can be viewed as a kind of motion in sequence space around the optimal HP. Our results indicate that the correlation coefficient between N-dimensional vectors constitutes a natural metric in the vectorial space in which we represent both protein sequences and protein structures, which we call Vectorial Protein Space. In this way, we define a unified framework for sequence to sequence, sequence to structure, and structure to structure alignments. We show that the interactivity scale is nearly optimal both for the comparison of sequences with sequences and sequences with structures. Comment: 13 pages, 3 figures, 2 table...|$|R

In this thesis, I experimentally determine inclusive decay properties of charmed D mesons. I also use exclusive decay predictions {{from a variety of}} theoretical models to make predictions about inclusive properties. Both experimental and theoretical realms benefit from the new techniques presented in this thesis. Inclusive properties derived are the multiplicity distributions, average multiplicities and inclusive branching ratios of charged particles, charged and neutral kaons, and charged pions. The center-of-mass momentum spectra of charged and neutral kaons are also obtained. Additionally, in the theoretical realm only, the inclusive properties of neutral pions, and the center-of-mass momentum spectra of charged and neutral pions are determined. The experimental analysis, which uses data from the Mark III experiment at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, employs an unfold technique utilizing <b>fold</b> <b>matrices</b> to obtain the charged particle and kaon properties. A new, enhanced unfold technique involving fold tensors obtains the first-ever results for the inclusive charged pion properties. The average strange quark contents and the average charged lepton multiplicities of the D^+, D^ 0, and D^+_s are also presented. In the theoretical analysis, the exclusive decay mode predictions from the factorization model of Bauer, Stech and Wirbel; the quark diagram scheme of Chau and Cheng; and the QCD sum rules model of Blok and Shifman are processed to determine inclusive properties.

40|$|Proteins {{that are}} {{imported}} from the cytosol into mitochondria cross the mitochondrial membranes in an unfolded conformation and then <b>fold</b> in the <b>matrix.</b> Some of these proteins require the chaperonin hsp 60 for folding. To test whether hsp 60 {{is required for the}} folding of all imported matrix proteins, we monitored the folding of four monomeric proteins after import into mitochondria from wild-type yeast or from a mutant strain in which hsp 60 had been inactivated. The four precursors included two authentic matrix proteins (rhodanese and the mitochondrial cyclophilin Cpr 3 p) and two artificial precursors (matrix-targeted variants of dihydrofolate reductase and barnase). Only rhodanese formed a tight complex with hsp 60 and required hsp 60 for folding. The three other proteins folded efficiently without, and showed no detectable binding to, hsp 60. Thus, the mitochondrial chaperonin system is not essential for the <b>folding</b> of all <b>matrix</b> proteins.

Injectable PEG-collagen hydrogels with semi-interpenetrating networks were developed to offer a potential alternative treatment option for vocal fold replacement. Covalently crosslinked PEG and physically crosslinked collagen formed semi-interpenetrating networks. Mechanical strength of hydrogels is mainly dependent on PEG concentration. Incorporation of collagen into PEG networks enhanced hydrogel viscoelasticity, elongation, and also some biological properties.

We undertook a comparative large-scale study by both array-compared genomic hybridization and cDNA microarray of a set of 50 breast tumors (21 classic ILCs and 29 IDCs) selected on homogeneous histoclinical criteria. Results were validated on independent tumor sets, as well as by quantitative RT-PCR. ILCs and IDCs presented differences at both the genomic and expression levels with ILCs being less rearranged and heterogeneous than IDCs. Supervised analysis defined a 75 -BACs signature discriminating accurately ILCs from IDCs.

The inhibitory drug cyclosporin A did not impair membrane translocation of preproteins, but it delayed the folding of an imported protein in wild-type mitochondria. Similarly, Neurospora crassa mitochondria lacking CyP 20 efficiently imported preproteins into the <b>matrix,</b> but <b>folding</b> of an imported protein was significantly delayed, indicating that CyP 20 is involved in protein <b>folding</b> in the <b>matrix.</b> The slow <b>folding</b> in the mutant mitochondria was not inhibited by cyclosporin A.

Mechanical injury can also determine spinal cord degeneration and act as {{a risk factor for}} the development of ALS. Results We have performed a comparative ontological analysis of the gene expression profiles of thoracic cord samples from rats carrying the G 93 A SOD 1 gene mutation and from wild-type littermates subjected to mechanical compression of the spinal cord. Common molecular responses and gene expression changes unique to each experimental paradigm were evaluated against the functional development of each animal model. Gene Ontology categories crucial to protein <b>folding,</b> extracellular <b>matrix</b> and axonal formation underwent early activation in both experimental paradigms, but decreased significantly in the spinal cord from animals recovering from injury after 7 days and from the G 93 A SOD 1 mutant rats at end-stage disease. Functional improvement after compression coincided with a massive up-regulation of growth-promoting gene categories including factors involved in angiogenesis and transcription, overcoming the more transitory surge of pro-apoptotic components and cell-cycle genes. The cord from G 93 A SOD 1 mutants showed persistent over-expression of apoptotic and stress molecules with fewer neurorestorative signals, while functional deterioration was ongoing.

The starting point is the same Bonn-C nucleon-nucleon interaction {{that is used to}} generate the Hamiltonian for recent shell-model calculations of double-beta decay. After first summing high-energy ladder diagrams that account for short-range correlations and then adding diagrams of low order in the G matrix to account for longer-range correlations, we <b>fold</b> the two-body <b>matrix</b> elements of the resulting effective operator with transition densities from the recent shell-model calculation to obtain the overall nuclear matrix element that governs the decay. Although the high-energy ladder diagrams suppress this matrix element at very short distances as expected, they enhance it at distances between one and two fermis, so that their overall effect is small. The corrections due to longer-range physics are large, but cancel one another so that the fully corrected matrix element is comparable to that produced by the bare operator. This cancellation between large and physically distinct low-order terms indicates the importance of a reliable nonperturbative calculation. Comment: 7 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

Since it is known that several developmental processes are regulated by the redox state, here we assessed if QSOX could have a role during mouse fetal development. For this purpose, an anti-recombinant mouse QSOX antibody was produced and characterized. In E- 13. 5, E- 16. 5 fetal tissues, QSOX immunostaining was confined to mesoderm- and ectoderm-derived tissues, while in P 1 neonatal tissues it was slightly extended to some endoderm-derived tissues.

QSOX was observed in loose connective tissues in all stages analyzed, intra and possibly extracellularly, in agreement with its putative role in oxidative <b>folding</b> and extracellular <b>matrix</b> remodeling.

The guiding principle for the PSI UQ development has been to implement nonintrusive “black box” UQ techniques in state-of-the-art, production-quality codes used already for routine analyses. Two complimentary UQ techniques have been developed thus far: (i) direct perturbation (DP) and (ii) stochastic sampling (SS).

The results indicated that HA-DCM hydrogel enhanced cell proliferation and prolonged cell morphology significantly compared to HA and HA-Col hydrogel. Importantly, the differentiation of hADSCs into fibroblasts was also promoted by cogels of HA-Col and HA-DCM significantly. The differentiation of hADSCs towards superficial lamina propria fibroblasts was accelerated by the secretion of HGF, IL- 8, and VEGF, the decorin and elastin expression, and the synthesis of chondroitin sulfate significantly. Therefore, the cogel of HA-DCM hydrogel was shown to be outstanding in apparent stimulation of hADSCs proliferation and differentiation to vocal fold fibroblasts through secretion of important growth factors and synthesis of extracellular matrix...|$|R
40|$|In {{skeletal}} muscle, the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex forms a membrane-associated {{assembly of}} relatively low abundance, making its detailed proteomic characterization in normal versus dystrophic tissues technically challenging. To overcome this analytical problem, we have enriched the muscle membrane fraction by a minimal differential centrifugation step {{followed by the}} comprehensive label-free mass spectrometric analysis of microsomal membrane preparations. This organelle proteomic approach successfully identified dystrophin and its binding partners in normal versus dystrophic hind limb muscles. The introduction of a simple pre-fractionation step enabled the simultaneous proteomic comparison of {{the reduction in the}} dystrophin-glycoprotein complex and secondary changes in the mdx- 4 cv mouse model of dystrophinopathy in a single analytical run. The proteomic screening of the microsomal fraction from dystrophic hind limb muscle identified the full-length dystrophin isoform Dp 427 as the most drastically reduced protein in dystrophinopathy, demonstrating the remarkable analytical power of comparative muscle proteomics. Secondary pathoproteomic expression patterns were established for 281 proteins, including dystrophin-associated proteins and components involved in metabolism, signalling, contraction, ion-regulation, protein <b>folding,</b> the extracellular <b>matrix</b> and the cytoskeleton. Key findings were verified by immunoblotting. Increased levels of the sarcolemmal Na+/K+-ATPase in dystrophic leg muscles were also confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy. Thus, the reduction of sample complexity in organelle-focused proteomics can be advantageous for the profiling of supramolecular protein complexes in highly intricate systems, such as skeletal muscle tissue...|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the dynamic process of {{membrane}} protein folding, and few models exist to explore it. In this study we doubled the number of Escherichia coli outer membrane proteins (OMPs) for which folding into lipid bilayers has been systematically investigated. We cloned, expressed, and folded nine OMPs: outer membrane protein X (OmpX), OmpW, OmpA, the crcA gene product (PagP), OmpT, outer membrane phospholipase A (OmpLa), the fadl gene product (FadL), the yaet gene product (Omp 85), and OmpF. These proteins fold into the same bilayer in vivo and share a transmembrane β-barrel motif but vary in sequence and barrel size. We quantified the ability of these OMPs to <b>fold</b> into a <b>matrix</b> of bilayer environments. Several trends emerged from these experiments: higher pH values, thinner bilayers, and increased bilayer curvature promote folding of all OMPs. Increasing the incubation temperature promoted folding of several OMPs but inhibited folding of others. We discovered that OMPs {{do not have the same}} ability to fold into any single bilayer environment. This suggests that although environmental factors influence folding, OMPs also have intrinsic qualities that profoundly modulate their folding. To rationalize the differences in folding efficiency, we performed kinetic and thermal denaturation experiments, the results of which demonstrated that OMPs employ different strategies to achieve the observed folding efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Vosaroxin is a first-in-class anticancer {{quinolone}} derivative topoisomerase II inhibitor that {{is currently}} in development in combination with cytarabine {{for the treatment of}} acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To investigate vosaroxin pharmacokinetics (PK) in patients, liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assays to quantify vosaroxin and the two metabolites N-desmethylvosaroxin and O-desmethylvosaroxin in human plasma and urine were developed and validated. Immediately after collection the samples were stored at - 80 °C. Prior to analysis, the plasma samples were subjected to protein precipitation and the urine samples were diluted. For both assays the reconstituted extracts were injected on a Symmetry Shield RP 8 column and gradient elution was applied using 0. 1 % formic acid in water and acetonitrile-methanol (50 : 50, v/v). Analyses were performed with a triple quadruple mass spectrometer in positive-ion mode. A deuterated isotope of vosaroxin was used as internal standard for the quantification. The validated assays quantify vosaroxin and N-desmethylvosaroxin in the concentration range of 2 - 500 ng/mL in plasma and urine. For O-desmethylvosaroxin the concentration range of 4 - 500 ng/mL in plasma and urine was validated. Dilution integrity experiments show that samples can be diluted 25 <b>fold</b> in control <b>matrix</b> prior to analysis. The expanded concentration range for plasma and urine for vosaroxin and N-desmethylvosaroxin is therefore from 2 to 15, 000 ng/mL and in plasma for O-desmethylvosaroxin from 4 to 15, 000 ng/mL...|$|R
40|$|The eﬀect of three-body force (TBF) is {{studied in}} nucleus-nucleus elastic {{scattering}} {{on the basis}} of Brueckner theory for nucleon-nucleon (NN) eﬀective interaction (complex G matrix) in the nuclear matter. A new G matrix called CEG 07 proposed recently by the present authors includes the TBF eﬀect and reproduces a realistic saturation curve in the nuclear matter, and is shown to well reproduce proton-nucleus elastic scattering. The microscopic optical potential for nucleus-nucleus system is obtained by <b>folding</b> the G <b>matrix</b> with nucleon density distributions in colliding nuclei. We ﬁrst analyze the 16 O + 16 O elastic scattering at E/A = 70 MeV in detail. The observed cross sections are nicely reproduced up to the most backward scattering angles only when the TBF eﬀect is included. The eﬀects of the three-body attraction (TBA) and three-body repulsion (TBR) are also analyzed. The TBR contribution has an important role in nucleus-nucleus elastic scattering. The CEG 07 G matrix is also tested in the elastic scattering of 16 O by the 12 C, 28 Si and 40 Ca targets at E/A = 93. 9 MeV, and in the elastic scattering of 12 C by the 12 C target at E/A = 135 MeV with a great success. The decisive eﬀect of the TBF is clearly seen also in those systems...|$|R
