40|$|The global {{financial}} crisis requires a global solution. A deep-seated {{overhaul of the}} international financial system is needed, but could be frustrated by political wrangling, particularly in the United States, {{but also in the}} European Union. Moreover, international coordination is complicated; without it there will be no level playing field and the resulting distortions could have serious consequences. The international monetary system (IMS) has come out of the crisis relatively unscathed, but is vulnerable to large-scale attacks on major currencies. Global imbalances have been temporarily reduced, but continue to pose a challenge in coming years. In order to strengthen the IMS and to accommodate the desire for diversification of official reserves, the proposal for an SDR Substitution Account (SA) that would allow central banks to convert excess dollar holdings into SDRs should be revived and streamlined. Eliminating the present <b>dollar</b> <b>overhang</b> and avoiding its recurrence in the future would benefit all major players in the world economy. The problem of exchange rate risk run by an IMF-administered SA could be eased by ring-fencing part of the IMF’s gold for that purpose. Ultimately, world reserves could consist of roughly one-third in dollars, euros and SDRs. ...|$|E
40|$|May 2003 Rapidly growing Chinese {{exports are}} middle-tech—and {{increasingly}} high-tech—manufactured goods. China runs {{a huge and}} growing bilateral trade surplus with the United States, and the position of Japan has changed radically from being a net exporter to China in the 1980 s and most of 1990 s to being a net importer today. China’s smaller East Asian industrial competitors such as Taiwan, Korea, and Singapore face fairly difficult readjustment problems. However, China is a huge importer of primary products and industrial raw materials and runs large import surpluses with the ASEAN group. On the macroeconomic side, China has been a stabilizing influence. While maintaining steady high growth and exchange rate stability at 8. 3 yuan per dollar since 1994, it has largely avoided, and thus dampened, the business cycles of its East Asian trading partners. But there are potential clouds on this horizon. Since 1995, China has run with moderate multilateral trade surpluses coupled with large inflows of foreign direct investment. The resulting balance of payments surpluses {{have led to a}} rapid buildup of liquid dollar claims on foreigners— both in official exchange reserves and, less obviously, in stocks held privately or in China’s nonstate sectors. This increasing private <b>dollar</b> <b>overhang</b> leads to what we call the syndrome of “conflicted virtue”. If there is no threat that the renminbi will appreciate, private portfolio equilibrium for accumulating and holding both dollar and renminbi assets can be sustained. However, foreigners, particularly Japanese, are upset with China’s “excessive” mercantile competitiveness. They are urging China’s government to appreciate the renminbi—and show greater future exchange rate flexibility, which could lead to repetitive appreciations. The result would be severe deflation throughout China’s economy and a zero-interest liquidity trap—as in Japan, when forced into repeated appreciations of the yen in the 1980 s into the mid 1990 s.
