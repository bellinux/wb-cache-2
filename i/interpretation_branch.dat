When encountered, the condition for a branch is evaluated as best possible given the precision of the abstract values bound to variables in the condition. It {{may be the case}} that the values are perfectly precise (neither top nor bottom) and hence, abstract execution can decide in which direction to branch.

40|$|We {{consider}} concurrent probabilistic systems, {{based on}} probabilistic automata of Segala & Lynch [53], which allow non-deterministic choice between probability distributions.

Here we address the question of the large $N$ limit where on the holographic side the gravity theory becomes classical and a non-fluctuating smooth spacetime description emerges. We show how a number of features of holographic duality in the large $N$ limit emerge naturally from entanglement renormalization, including a classical spacetime generated by entanglement, a sparse spectrum of operator dimensions, and phase transitions in mutual information. We also address questions related to bulk locality below the AdS radius, holographic duals of weakly coupled large $N$ theories, Fermi surfaces in holography, and the holographic <b>interpretation</b> of <b>branching</b> MERA. Some of our considerations are inspired by the idea of quantum expanders which are generalized quantum transformations that add a definite amount of entropy to most states.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{objective}} probability - chance - has three distinctive features: chances are measured by statistics, {{but only with}} high chance, increasing {{with the number of}} trials involved; when the chances of the outcomes of a chance process are known, even {{in the context of a}} single trial, then one's subjective probabilities - credences - in those outcomes should be set equal to those chances; and finally, chance processes involve uncertainty as to the outcomes of those processes.

40|$|My thesis {{focused on}} John McCone {{and his role}} during the Cuban Missile Crisis. On this subject, I will examine John McCone 2 ̆ 7 s efforts from May to September 1962 to {{understand}} the Soviet buildup in Cuba, pushing President John F. Kennedy for more reconnaissance of the island to aid this effort. During the crisis in October 1962, McCone {{was one of the}} main officials responsible for briefing the Kennedy administration on the Soviet efforts in Cuba, where he sided with the members of the cabinet pushing for an air strike and invasion to remove the missiles. Following the crisis, McCone continued to watch the Soviet withdrawal of offensive weapons from Cuba, all the time maintaining his staunch anti-communist views. John McCone maintained throughout the summer and fall of 1962 that the Soviet Union might place nuclear weapons into Cuba. Part of the reason for this hypothesis was the correct assumption that the placement of missiles into Cuba gave Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev a way to counter the growing American nuclear superiority, protect the communist government on Cuba, and quell fears of the missiles being used against Moscow. McCone made his concerns clear to President Kennedy and other members of the administration before leaving on his honeymoon in late August 1962. During his honeymoon, he called for more reconnaissance flights over Cuba, empowering his deputy, General Marshall Carter, to continue his efforts in Washington. When he returned from his honeymoon, he found gaps in the reconnaissance over western portions of Cuba, and pushed for more reconnaissance flights. On the final of those authorized flights, October 14, the reconnaissance flights found the missiles. McCone 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 crusade 2 ̆ 2 during the summer and fall of 1962 was a primary reason for the early discovery of the missiles. McCone also pushed to remove Castro and his communist government from power. Continuing his crusade against Castro, McCone joined several prominent members of the Executive Committee (EXCOMM) proposing a surgical strike against missile sites followed by an invasion. Despite his push for air strikes even during the blockade, McCone had the job of briefing the administration on daily intelligence reports, keeping Kennedy and his cabinet informed on construction efforts in Cuba. Despite his emotional calls for attacks on Cuba, McCone 2 ̆ 7 s efforts to combine the intelligence reports, analysis, and photo <b>interpretation</b> <b>branches</b> during the Crisis allowed the President to have a detailed picture on the withdrawal of the missiles, allowing Kennedy to make informed decisions when dealing with the Soviet government. Finally, I examined McCone 2 ̆ 7 s efforts in November 1962, during the Soviet withdrawal of offensive weapons from Cuba. Kennedy, under intense pressure from Congress and public, relied on the CIA Director and the rest of the EXCOMM for intelligence analysis on whether the missiles had indeed left Cuba. McCone gave the administration the conclusions of the analysts studying the Soviet withdrawal, concluding that the weapons indeed were being dismantled and shipped back to the Soviet Union. Again, McCone had the important role of giving Kennedy the evidence he needed that the missiles were in fact leaving Cuba, bringing an end to the crisis...|$|R
40|$|I shall {{argue that}} there is no such {{property}} of an event as its “probability. ” This is why standard interpretations cannot give a sound definition in empirical terms of what “probability ” is, and this is why empirical sciences like physics can manage without such a definition. “Probability ” is a collective term, the meaning of which varies from context to context: it means different—dimensionless [0, 1]-valued— physical quantities characterising the different particular situations. In other words, probability is a reducible concept, supervening on physical quantities characterising the state of affairs corresponding to the event in question. On the other hand, however, these “probability-like ” physical quantities correspond to objective features of the physical world, and are objectively related to measurable quantities like relative frequencies of physical events based on finite samples—no matter whether the world is objectively deterministic or indeterministic.

Learning one structure depends on learning the structures it interacts with, but if the learner commits to one structure, its interactions can be exploited to learn others. The Commitment-Based Learner (CBL) employs this strategy using error-driven learning (Gold 1967, Wexler and Culicover 1980) and inconsistency detection (Tesar 1997) to determine when to make commitments {{and what kinds of}} commitments to make. The CBL overcomes structural ambiguity by extending branches from a hypothesis and committing to a separate structural <b>interpretation</b> in each <b>branch,</b> as in the Inconsistency Detection Learner (Tesar 2004).

40|$|Heavy {{elements}} are formed in nucleosynthesis processes. Abundances {{of these elements}} can be classified as elemental abundance, isotopic abundance, and abundance of nuclei. In this work we propose to change nucleon identification from the usual (Z,A) to (Z,N), which allows reading out new information from the measured abundances. We {{are interested in the}} neutron density required to reproduce the measured abundance of nuclei assuming equilibrium processes. This is only possible when two stable nuclei are separated by an unstable nucleus. At these places we investigated the neutron density required for equilibrium nucleosynthesis both isotopically and isotonically at temperatures of AGB interpulse and thermal pulse phases. We obtained an estimate for equilibrium nucleosynthesis neutron density in most of the cases. Next we investigated the possibility of partial formation of nuclei. We analyzed the meaning of the branching factor. We found a mathematical definition for the unified <b>interpretation</b> of a <b>branching</b> point closed at isotonic case and open at isotopic case. We introduce a more expressive variant of branching ratio called partial formation rate. With these we are capable of determining the characteristic neutron density values.

In this paper we present a description of a final object for the category of non-deterministic automata, regarded as labelled transition systems, with the help of some structures defined in terms of languages. As a consequence, we obtain a characterisation of bisimilarity of states of automata in terms of languages and a method to minimise non-deterministic automata with respect to bisimilarity of states.

According to the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, each branch of the wave function of a measuring device {{in which there is a}} definite measurement result corresponds to each world among the many worlds (see, e. g.

Therefore, according to the many-worlds interpretation, in every world the whole superposed wave function of the measuring device cannot be measured. If all branches of the superposed wave function of the device can be observed in one world, then they will all exist in this world, which obviously contradicts the many-worlds interpretation. It is unsurprising that the existence of such many worlds may be consistent with the results of conventional impulse measurements 1, as the many-worlds interpretation is just invented to explain the emergence of these results, e. g. the definite measurement result in each world always denotes the result of a conventional impulse measurement.

40|$|The continuous-time Markovian Multitype Branching Process (ctMMTBP) (Athreya- 1971; Harris- 1963) are {{powerful}} stochastic models that describe {{the evolution of}} populations of individuals that reproduce and die independently of each other according to specific probability laws. They are playing an increasingly important role in models of population biology, including molecular biology, ecology, epidemiology, evolutionary theory, and in other scientific areas, such as particle physics, chemistry, and computer science. A special case of a ctMMTBP occurs when branch points are restricted to generate at most two new offspring in which case it {{is known as the}} binary branch point ctMMTBP, a process that was used in Kontoleon (2006) to model biological phenomena such as phylogenetic processes and macroevolution. In kontoleon- 2006 the evolution of branches in tree histories was given an interpretation different from that which underlies the ctMMTBP. Under the ctMMBTP <b>interpretation,</b> a <b>branch</b> point can occur in which a branch of one type dies and a single branch of another type is born. In the interpretation of Kontoleon, this is thought of as a continuation of the same branch with a change of phase of some underlying modulating process. Such a transition is hidden {{from the point of view}} of the tree topology. There are two other types of branch points: (i) a binary branch point generating one new daughter and the continuation of the parent, and (ii) a terminating branch point. These are both observable from the point of view of the tree topology. This interpretation led to an alternative representation for this type of branching process called the Markovian Binary Tree (MBT). In this interpretation, the evolution of each branch is governed by a (Transient) Markovian Arrival Process (MAP). MAPs have two types of transitions: hidden and observable, which correspond to the hidden and observable events described above. In essence the binary branch point ctMMTBP was represented as a level-dependent Quasi-Birth-and-Death process. The Markovian Binary Tree representation of the ctMMTBP enables a field that is almost devoid of algorithmic approaches to become subject to the powerful techniques of matrix-analytic theory. In this thesis our object of study is the Markovian Binary Tree. We begin by giving an introduction to the world of branching processes in Chapter 1. We next introduce the theory of matrix analytic methods in Chapter 2 and 3. We commence by discussing the Phase-Type Distribution as a generalization of Exponential distribution, Poisson process, followed by the Phase-Type renewal process. The Phase-type renewal process is the generalization of the Poisson process to non-exponential inter-event distributions. We next discuss the Markovian Arrival Process (MAP). %The MAP is the generalization of the phase-type renewal process to include correlations. The MAP generates the dynamics of the MBT. The concept of the hidden and observable transitions of the MAP is used to alter the interpretations of particle transitions in the ctMMTBP and create the MBT interpretation. The level-independent Quasi-Birth-and-Death process (LIQBD) and level-dependent Quasi-Birth-and-Death process (LDQBD) are then introduced and we analyze the algorithm of Neuts, the algorithm U and the level-independent logarithmic reduction algorithm. The LDQBD process is the framework within which we represent the Markovian binary tree. In Chapter 4 we begin by representing the Markovian Binary Tree (MBT) as a level-dependent Quasi-Birth-and-Death process. We define the MBT and explore its alternative representation as a continuous-time Markovian Multitype Branching Process. Since the MBT is a ctMMTBP, more specifically, a binary-branch point ctMMTBP, we also write the basic branching process equations for the MBT. From these equations we obtain the equation for the probability of eventual extinction of the process. We then develop four algorithms to determine the probability of eventual extinction of the MBT process: the Depth, Order- 1, Order- 2 and Thicknesses algorithms. We also show that these give rise to second-order equations and we apply Newton's method for fixed-point equations. These algorithms are well defined and converge quadratically in the domain of interest. We compare the relative efficiency of eight iterative methods based on functional iteration, on the basis of the probabilistic interpretation of the successive iterations as well as on the basis of traditional rate of convergence analysis. We illustrate our findings through a few numerical examples. I chapter 5 we focus on transient measures, such as the distribution of the population size at a finite time, the distribution of the time until extinction, and the distribution of the total family size until a given time, as well as the total size until extinction. Our results mainly are formulated as differential equations for probability generating functions and expressions for the factorial moments and conclude by showing how they are applied to demography. Finally, in chapter 6 we analytically investigate the diffusion behavior of information in a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) modeled as a two-dimensional spatial branching process. Our analysis permits the derivation of the extinction probability of information being diffused from a source node. Our model permits observing how the activity pattern of each node influences the probability of maintaining time-dependent information in the network...|$|R
