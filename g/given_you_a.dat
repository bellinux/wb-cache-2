500|$|Anne Hutchinson {{was brought}} before the clergy and {{congregation}} at the Boston meeting house on Thursday, 15 March 1638. [...] A list of numerous theological errors was presented, four of which were addressed during a nine-hour session. [...] Then Cotton was put in the uncomfortable position of delivering an admonition to his admirer. [...] He said, [...] "I would speake it to Gods Glory [...] you have bine an Instrument of doing some good amongst us... he hath <b>given</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> sharp apprehension, a ready utterance and abilitie to exprese yourselfe in the Cause of God." ...|$|E
500|$|The ministers {{intended}} to protect their orthodox doctrine and to examine Hutchinson's theological errors. [...] Ruling elder Thomas Leverett was charged with managing the examination. He called Mrs. Hutchinson and read the numerous errors with which she had been charged. [...] A nine-hour interrogation followed, in which the ministers delved into some weighty points of theology. [...] At {{the end of the}} session, only four of the many errors were covered, and Cotton was put in the uncomfortable position of delivering the admonition to his admirer. [...] He spoke, [...] "I would speake it to Gods Glory [...] you have bine an Instrument of doing some good amongst us... he hath <b>given</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> sharp apprehension, a ready utterance and abilitie to exprese yourselfe in the Cause of God." [...] The ministers overwhelmingly concluded that Hutchinson's unsound beliefs outweighed all the good which she had done, and that she endangered the spiritual welfare of the community.|$|E
500|$|After the {{disaster}} at Sidi Barrani and the withdrawal from Egypt, Lieutenant General Annibale Bergonzoli's XXIII Corps faced the British {{from within the}} strong defences of Bardia. Mussolini wrote to Bergonzoli: [...] "I have <b>given</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> difficult task but one suited to your courage and experience as an old and intrepid soldier—the task of defending the fortress of Bardia to the last. I am certain that 'Electric Beard' and his brave soldiers will stand at whatever cost, faithful to the last." [...] Bergonzoli replied: [...] "I am aware of the honour and I have today repeated to my troops your message — simple and unequivocal. In Bardia we are and here we stay." [...] Bergonzoli had approximately 45,000 defenders under his command. The Italian divisions defending the perimeter of Bardia included remnants of four divisions. The northern ("Gerfah") sector was held by the 2nd [...] "28 October" [...] Blackshirt Division; the centre ("Ponticelli") sector by the 1st [...] "23 March" [...] Blackshirt Division and elements of the 62nd [...] "Marmarica" [...] Infantry Division; and the southern ("Mereiga") sector by the 63rd [...] "Cirene" [...] Infantry Division {{and the rest of}} the 62nd [...] "Marmarica" [...] Infantry Division. [...] Bergonzoli also had the remnants of the disbanded 64th [...] "Catanzaro" [...] Infantry Division, some 6,000 Frontier Guard (GaF) troops, three companies of Bersaglieri, part of the dismounted Vittorio Emanuele cavalry regiment, and a machine gun company of the 60th [...] "Sabratha" [...] Infantry Division.|$|E

2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{reference in}} Latin literature to a marriage between males {{occurs in the}} Philippics of Cicero, who insulted Mark Antony for being a slut in his youth until Curio [...] "established you in a fixed and stable marriage (matrimonium), {{as if he had}} <b>given</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> stola", the traditional garment of a married woman. Although Cicero's sexual implications are clear, the point of the passage is to cast Antony in the submissive role in the relationship and to impugn his manhood in various ways; {{there is no reason to}} think that actual marriage rites were performed.|$|E

[...] With this said, it was the overwhelming conclusion of the ministers that Hutchinson's unsound beliefs outweighed any good that she had done, and that she endangered the spiritual welfare of the community. [...] Cotton continued, [...] "You cannot Evade the Argument... that filthie Sinne of the Communitie of Woemen; and all promiscuous and filthie cominge togeather of men and Woemen without Distinction or Relation of Mariage, will necessarily follow.... Though I have not herd, nayther do I thinke you have bine unfaythfull to your Husband in his Marriage Covenant, yet that will follow upon it." [...] He concluded, [...] "Therefor, I doe Admonish you, and alsoe charge you {{in the name of}} Ch Je, in whose place I stand... that you would sadly consider the just hand of God agaynst you, the great hurt you have done to the Churches, the great Dishonour you have brought to Je Ch, and the Evell that you have done to many a poore soule." [...] With this, Hutchinson was instructed to return on the next lecture day in one week.|$|E
