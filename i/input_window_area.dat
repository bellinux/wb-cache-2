The use of technical analysis for financial forecasting has been successfully employed by many researchers. <b>Input</b> <b>window</b> length is a time frame parameter required to be set when calculating many technical indicators. This study explores how {{the performance of the}} predictive system depends on a combination of a forecast horizon and an <b>input</b> <b>window</b> length for forecasting variable horizons. Technical indicators are used as input features for machine learning algorithms to forecast future directions of stock price movements. The dataset consists of ten years daily price time series for fifty stocks. The highest prediction performance is observed when the <b>input</b> <b>window</b> length is approximately equal to the forecast horizon.

Collisionless reconnection evolves in two steps {{in accordance with the}} formation of two current layers, i.e., an ion current layer in the early ion phase and an electron current layer in the late electron phase. After the electron current layer is formed inside the ion current layer, the system relaxes gradually to a steady state when convergent plasma flow is driven by an external electric field with a narrow <b>input</b> <b>window.</b> On the other hand, when the convergent plasma flow is driven from the wide <b>input</b> <b>window,</b> magnetic reconnection takes place in an intermittent manner, due to the frequent formation of magnetic islands in the vicinity of neutral sheet.|$|R

About 2 {{years ago we}} started a program with the PMT manufacturers Hamamatsu, Photonis and Electron Tubes for boosting up the QE of bialkali PMTs. In the mean time we have obtained several batches of experimental PMTs from the above-mentioned manufacturers and measured few samples with QE values as high as 32 – 36 % in the peak.

40|$|In this work, we {{characterize}} {{and contrast}} {{the capabilities of}} the general class of time-delay neural networks (TDNN), with input delay neural networks (IDNN), the subclass of TDNNs with delays limited to the inputs. Each class of networks is capable of representing the same set of languages, those embodied by the definite memory machines (DMM), a subclass of finite state machines. We demonstrate the close affinity between TDNNs and DMM languages by learning a very large DMM (2048 states) using only a few training examples. Even though both architectures are capable of representing the same class of languages, they have distinguishable learning biases. Intuition suggests that general TDNNs which include delays in hidden layers should perform well, compared to IDNNs, on problems in which the output can be expressed as a function on narrow <b>input</b> <b>windows</b> which repeat in time. On the other hand, these general TDNNs should perform poorly when the <b>input</b> <b>windows</b> are wide, or there is little r [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} designed: (a) to {{investigate}} a simple neural-network solution to forecasting the special class of time series corresponding {{to a wide range}} of ARMA(p,q) structures; (b) to study the significance of matching the <b>input</b> <b>window</b> size with the nature of time series. The study adopted a simulation approach in conjunction with an experimental design. It is discovered that a simple two-layered network, with proper <b>input</b> <b>window</b> size, is able to consistently outperform the multi-layer feedforward network and that the two-layered network is comparable to the Box-Jenkins modelling approach for a majority of the ARMA(p,q) time series studied and better than the Box-Jenkins modelling approach when the ARMA structure gets more complex and generates more variability. The results affirm that it is unnecessary to use multi-layer feedforward networks for this special class of linear time series and that the two-layered network can be a useful forecasting alternative to the widely popular Box-Jenkins model.

However, the proximate drivers of collisions are not well understood, and no study has examined spatial variation in mortality in an urban setting. We hypothesized {{that the number of}} fatalities at buildings varies with <b>window</b> <b>area</b> and habitat features that influence avian community structure. In 2010 we documented bird-window collisions (BWCs) and characterized avian community structure at 20 buildings in an urban landscape in northwestern Illinois, USA. For each building and season, we conducted 21 daily surveys for carcasses and nine point count surveys to estimate relative abundance, richness, and diversity. Our sampling design was informed by experimentally estimated carcass persistence times and detection probabilities. We used linear and generalized linear mixed models to evaluate how habitat features influenced community structure and how mortality was affected by <b>window</b> <b>area</b> and factors that correlated with community structure. The most-supported model was consistent for all community indices and included effects of season, development, and distance to vegetated lots. BWCs were related positively to <b>window</b> <b>area</b> and negatively to development. We documented mortalities for 16 / 72 (22 %) species (34 total carcasses) recorded at buildings, and BWCs were greater for juveniles than adults. Based on the most-supported model of BWCs, the median number of annual predicted fatalities at study buildings was 3 (range = 0 – 52).
