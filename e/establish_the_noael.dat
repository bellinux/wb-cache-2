40|$|To develop allopregnanolone as a {{therapeutic}} for Alzheimer's disease, we investigated multiple formulations and routes of administration in translationally relevant animal models of both sexes. Subcutaneous, topical (transdermal and intranasal), intramuscular, and intravenous allopregnanolone were bolus-administered. Pharmacokinetic analyses of intravenous allopregnanolone in rabbit and mouse indicated that peak plasma and brain levels (3 -fold brain/plasma ratios) at 5 min were sufficient to activate neuroregenerative responses at sub-sedative doses. Slow-release subcutaneous suspension of allopregnanolone displayed 5 -fold brain/plasma ratio at Cmax at 30 min. At therapeutic doses by either subcutaneous or intravenous routes, allopregnanolone mouse plasma levels ranged between 34 - 51 ng/ml by 30 min, comparable to published endogenous human {{level in the}} third trimester of pregnancy. Exposure to subcutaneous, topical, intramuscular, and intravenous allopregnanolone, at safe and tolerable doses, increased hippocampal markers of neurogenesis including BrdU and PCNA in young 3 xTgAD and aged wildtype mice. Intravenous allopregnanolone transiently and robustly phosphorylated CREB within 5 min and increased levels of neuronal differentiation transcription factor NeuroD within 4 h. Neurogenic efficacy was achieved with allopregnanolone brain exposure of 300 - 500 hr*ng/g. Formulations were tested to determine the no observable adverse effect level (NOAEL) and maximally tolerated doses (MTD) in male and female rats by sedation behavior time course. Sex differences were apparent, males exhibited ≥ 40 % more sedation time compared to females. Allopregnanolone formulated in sulfobutyl-ether-beta-cyclodextrin at optimized complexation ratio maximized allopregnanolone delivery and neurogenic efficacy. To <b>establish</b> <b>the</b> <b>NOAEL</b> and MTD for Allo-induced sedation using a once-per-week intravenous regenerative treatment regimen: In female rats the NOAEL was 0. 5 mg/kg and MTD 2 mg/kg. The predicted MTD in human female is 0. 37 mg/kg. In male rats the NOAEL and MTD were less than those determined for female. Outcomes of these PK/PD studies predict a safe and efficacious dose range for initial clinical trials of allopregnanolone for Alzheimer's disease.

40|$|A revised risk {{assessment}} for toxaphene was developed, {{based on the}} assumption that fish consumers are only exposed to toxaphene residues that differ substantially from technical toxaphene due to environmental degradation and metabolism. In vitro studies confirmed that both technical toxaphene and degraded toxaphene inhibit gap junctional intercellular communication that correlates with the mechanistic potential to cause tumor promotion. In vivo rat studies <b>established</b> <b>the</b> <b>NOAEL</b> for degraded and technical toxaphene at the highest dose tested in the bioassay. Toxaphene residue intakes from European fishery products were estimated and compared to the provisional tolerable daily intakes (TDIs) from various regulatory agencies including Canada, the United States, and Germany. The estimated intake was also compared to a new calculated provisionalMATT pTDI. TheMATT pTDI is based on new toxicological information (in vivo rat studies) developed on a model for environmental toxaphene residues rather than technical toxaphene. A MATT pTDI (1. 08 mg total toxaphene for a person of 60 kg) for tumor promotion potency was adopted for use in Europe and is referred to here as the MATT pTDI. These new data result in a better estimate of safety and a higher TDI than previously used. Based on realistic fish consumption data and recent baseline concentration data of toxaphene in European fishery products, the toxaphene intake for the consumers of Germany, Ireland, Norway, and the Netherlands was estimated. For an average adult fish consumer, the average daily intake of toxaphene was estimated to be 1. 2, 0. 4, 0. 5, and 0. 2 μg for the consumers of Norway, Germany, Ireland, and the Netherlands, respectively. The toxaphene intake of these average fish consumers was far below the MATT pTDI of 1. 08 mg/ 60 kg bw. In conclusion, based on the most relevant toxicological studies and the most realistic estimates of fish consumption and recent concentrations of toxaphene in European fishery products, adverse health effects are unlikely for the average European consumer of fishery products. In no case is the MATT pTDI exceeded. © 2011 SETAC...|$|R

As several authors have previously noted, the probability that added risk at <b>the</b> <b>NOAEL</b> is not negligibly small increases as sample sizes decrease.

40|$|In {{cases where}} human {{toxicity}} {{data are not}} available the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) is determined by division of the No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) for animal toxicity by a safety factor. In this calculation <b>the</b> <b>NOAEL</b> {{is used as a}} point estimate for the threshold of animal toxicity. The way in which <b>the</b> <b>NOAEL</b> is used in calculating the ADI has several limitations. Of these limitations the weakness of <b>the</b> <b>NOAEL</b> as an estimator of the threshold for animal toxicity and the inability of the current approach to assess toxicity beyond <b>the</b> <b>NOAEL</b> form important issues. This report reviews three quantitative methods, e. g. Crump's Benchmark Dose, Gaylor's Extrapolation Method and Hoekstra's Bounded-Effect Dose, on their merits in improving the adequacy of determining the ADI from animal toxicity data. Contrary to <b>the</b> <b>NOAEL</b> approach, <b>the</b> above mentioned methods take the experimental uncertainty into account in estimating the threshold for animal toxicity and make use of the entire dose-response relationship relation instead of only one of its data points in assessing chemical toxicity. The applicability of these methods, however, greatly depends {{on the quality of the}} data set to be analysed. In this context answering the following questions are of particular importance: 1. Do the data allow reasonable characterisation of the dose-response relationship? 2. Do the data allow the estimation of acceptable toxicity levels per se or is extrapolation outside the experimentally observed dose range necessary? 3. Can a priori safe vs. non-safe effect levels be defined? Reviewing the literature the following conclusions were drawn. In cases where the data allow the characterisation of a dose-response relationship, Crump's Benchmark Dose is favourable. However, toxicity data generated for regulatory purposes may not suffice for assessing a dose-response curve. Then Hoekstra's "model free" Bounded Effect Dose might be an alternative. When acceptable animal toxicity levels lie outside the experimental dose range Gaylor's Extrapolation Method is more appropriate. Applying a Benchmark dose approach may have consequences for the experimental design of toxicity studies. Replications per dose group are no longer necessary and the series of doses may equal the total number of animals used, the unreplicated design having less chance in allocating doses in the most interesting part of the dose response relationship, i. e. its changing part. The Benchmark dose approach may thus lead to a reduction of the number of animals used in toxicity testing. In all three methods a maximum safe effect level needs to be postulated. Current toxicological knowledge however does not allow for an equivocal threshold between adverse and non-adverse effect levels for most toxic endpoints. As the definition of adverse vs. non-adverse effect levels is a conditio sine qua non for the application of the methods reviewed in this report we therefore suggest to examine the possibilities to define standard levels for various endpoints, to be used for future assessment of ADI's...|$|R

[115]). PFBS did not elicit a verifiable developmental effect in rats [115]. In contrast to observations on PFOS and PFOA, exposure of pregnant mice to PFBA was not found to have adverse effects on survival of newborn or their postnatal growth [180]. Although PFHxS, compared with PFBS, PFOS and PFOA, has the longest half-life in humans, no effects on reproduction or survival and growth of the progeny was observed in rats. <b>The</b> <b>NOAEL</b> for developmental toxicity of PFHxS was determined to be 10 mg/kg BW/day ([181] cited in Lau et al. [115]). Perfluorodecanoic acid, like other PFCs, did not induce deformations and also did not elicit any other developmental toxic effects [182].|$|R
