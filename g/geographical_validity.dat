The huge difficulties inherent in estimating simply the population’s human geography, let alone its characteristics, are discussed, and I conclude that current estimates may now be as close as they will ever be to a true estimate of the population—but are in places very unreliable. The slightly haphazard {{way in which the}} United Kingdom finally arrived at its 2001 population estimates, by the latter half of 2004, is commented upon. The UK population was reported to have passed the 60 million mark twice: once in 2001 and then again in 2004. With such national uncertainty, confidence in local population estimates is obviously low. This uncertainty also raises issues over the practicality of recent attempts to estimate the size of the supposed illegal population living in the United Kingdom, even before any moral objections are raised over attempts to count those whose existence here is deemed to be illegal. An uncertainty principle is introduced whereby, as the population becomes more mobile, observation becomes ever more unreliable. I end the paper by discussing the implications of changing human geography for its enumeration with a suggestion for a revision to the census form in 2011 to allow us to count better in the future. I conclude that comparisons with administrative records are not a panacea for estimating the population of the United Kingdom. Instead, further checks within the census process are suggested for the future. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceModern pollen assemblages from grazed {{vegetation}} in the Pyrenees Mountains (France) {{were studied}} {{with the aim}} of providing a calibrated model for reconstructing past pastoral activities. The modern analogues were selected to cover the major gradients of grazing pressure and degree of openness. The vegetation was surveyed by means of the synusial integrated method, assessing the structure and the patchiness of the pastoral phytoceonoses. A correlative model (Redundancy analysis) was devised relating 61 modern pollen spectra with 37 explanatory vegetation and land-use variables. It was shown that wooded, open grazed and nitrophilous sites are clearly separated from one another and that the model can be simplified using three relevant vegetation types as explanatory variables: dry heathland, semi-open oak forest and overgrazed community, respectively related to gradients of openness, soil richness and grazing pressure. When reconstructing past pastoral activities with fossil pollen spectra, {{it is important to consider}} scale-dependent influences of plant species. Low frequencies of well-dispersed taxa such as Artemisia, Chenopodiaceae, Plantago lanceolata and Plantago major/media must be interpreted with care since they reflect more regional, rather than local, input into the pastoral landscape. In contrast, the simultaneous occurrence of Asteroideae, Cichorioideae, Cirsium-type, Galium-type, Ranunculaceae, Stellaria-type and Potentilla-type pollen is clearly related to grazing on a local scale. Calculation of Davis indices also shows that Cichorioideae, Galium-type and Potentilla-type indicate the very local presence of the corresponding plants. These pastoral plant indicators may have a limited <b>geographical</b> <b>validity,</b> ie, mountainous regions with crystalline bedrock, which may indeed also provide the framework for the application to fossil spectra of the modern pollen/vegetation/land-use models presented here...|$|E
40|$|Purpose Salinisation is {{a threat}} not only to arable land but also to {{freshwater}} resources. Nevertheless, salinisation impacts have been rarely and only partially included in life cycle assessment (LCA) so far. The objectives of this review paper were to give a comprehensive overview of salinisation mechanisms due to human interventions, analyse the completeness, relevance and scientific robustness of existing published methods addressing salinisation in LCA and provide recommendations towards a comprehensive integration of salinisation within the impact modelling frameworks in LCA. Methods First, {{with the support of}} salinisation experts and related literature, we highlighted multiple causes of soil and water salinisation and presented induced effects on human health, ecosystems and resources. Second, existing life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) methods addressing salinisation were analysed against the International Reference Life Cycle Data System analysis grid of the European Commission. Third, adopting a holistic approach, the modelling options for salinisation impacts were analysed in agreement with up-to-date LCIA frameworks and models. Results and discussion We proposed a categorisation of salinisation processes in four main types based on salinisation determinism: land use change, irrigation, brine disposal and overuse of a water body. For each salinisation type, key human management and biophysical factors involved were identified. Although the existing methods addressing salinisation in LCA are important and relevant contributions, they are often incomplete with regards to both the salinisation pathways they address and their <b>geographical</b> <b>validity.</b> Thus, {{there is a lack of}} a consistent framework for salinisation impact assessment in LCA. In analysing existing LCIA models, we discussed the inventory and impact assessment boundary options. The land use/land use change framework represents a good basis for the integration of salinisation impacts due to a land use change but should be completed to account for off-site impacts. Conversely, the land use/land use change framework is not appropriate to model salinisation due to irrigation, overuse of a water body and brine disposal. For all salinisation pathways, a bottom-up approach describing the environmental mechanisms (fate, exposure and effect) is recommended rather than an empirical or top-down approach because (i) salts and water are mobile and theirs effects are interconnected; (ii) water and soil characteristics vary greatly spatially; (iii) this approach allows the evaluation of both on- and off-site impacts and (iv) it is the best way to discriminate systems and support a reliable eco-design. Conclusions This paper highlights the importance of including salinisation impacts in LCA. Much research effort is still required to include salinisation impacts in a global, consistent and operational manner in LCA, and this paper provides the basis for future methodological developments.
