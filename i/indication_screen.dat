40|$|Abstract Background Colorectal cancer {{screening}} is widely recommended, but often under-utilized. In addition, significant demographic differences in screening utilization exist. Insurance coverage {{may be one}} factor influencing utilization of colorectal {{cancer screening}} tests. Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of claims for outpatient services for Washington state Medicare beneficiaries in calendar year 2000. We determined the proportion of beneficiaries utilizing screening fecal occult blood tests, flexible sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy, or double contrast barium enema in the overall population and various demographic subgroups. Multiple logistic regression {{analysis was used to}} determine the relative odds of screening in different demographic groups. Results Approximately 9. 2 % of beneficiaries had fecal occult blood tests, 7. 2 % had any colonoscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy, or barium enema (invasive) colon tests, and 3. 5 % had invasive tests for <b>screening</b> <b>indications.</b> Colonoscopy accounted for 41 % of all invasive tests for <b>screening</b> <b>indications.</b> Women were more likely to receive fecal occult blood test screening (OR 1. 18; 95 %CI 1. 15, 1. 21) and less likely to receive invasive tests for <b>screening</b> <b>indications</b> than men (OR 0. 80, 95 %CI 0. 77, 0. 83). Whites were more likely than other racial groups to receive any type of screening. Rural residents were more likely than urban residents to have fecal occult blood tests (OR 1. 20, 95 %CI 1. 17, 1. 23) but less likely to receive invasive tests for <b>screening</b> <b>indications</b> (OR 0. 89; 95 %CI 0. 85, 0. 93). Conclusion Reported use of fecal occult blood testing remains modest. Overall use of the more invasive tests for <b>screening</b> <b>indications</b> remains essentially unchanged, but there has been a shift toward increased use of screening colonoscopy. Significant demographic differences in screening utilization persist despite consistent insurance coverage. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background. Taking into {{consideration}} new {{data on the}} increased detectability and more exact diagnostic methods, revision of classical ideas of clinical picture and criteria of diagnostics of a pheochromocytoma (Ph) is required. Aim. To study current features of clinic manifestation, results of instrumental methods and factors, which influence on treatment efficiency of patients with confirmed diagnosis of Ph. Matherials and methods. There were studied 9 patients with histologically confirmed diagnosis of P (1 man 56 years old; 8 women who were 37. 6 ± 5. 5 years old). Next parameters were evaluated: presence of arterial hypertension (AH), specific features of P (sympathetic attack); <b>indications</b> for <b>screening</b> of Ph, the time from the appearance of <b>indications</b> for <b>screening</b> till the laboratory confirmed diagnosis, characteristics of CT (native density, size, contrast washout, specific features (cystic, heterogeneous structure with areas of necrosis and hemorrhage)), features of preoperative preparation, presence of intraoperative complications, efficiency of the surgery. Used descriptive statistics were percentage, mean M, standard deviation SD and 95 % confidence interval CI. Results. AH was presented in 6 patients (67 %), among whom 4 patients had specific features which indicated symptomatic AH. These 4 patients had the classic triad of Ph (44 %). <b>Indications</b> for <b>screening</b> of Ph in 4 patients were specific features of Ph (time from <b>screening</b> <b>indication</b> appearance till laboratory confirmed diagnosis was 41 ± 14 mnths. (95 % CI 18; 63), in other 5 - adrenal incidentaloma (AI) (time from the detection of AI until the laboratory confirmed diagnosis was 13 ± 9 days (95 % CI 2; 24).

40|$|Background. The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} if colonoscopy quality is associated with the annual case volume of endoscopists. Methods. A retrospective cohort study was performed on 3235 patients who underwent colonoscopy in the city of St. John’s, NL, between January and June 2012. Data collected included completion of colonoscopy (CCR) and adenoma detection rates (ADR). Endoscopists were divided into quintiles based on annual case volume. To account for potential confounding variables, univariate analyses followed by multivariable logistic regression were used to identify variables independently associated with CCR and ADR. Results. A total of 13 surgeons and 8 gastroenterologists were studied. There was a significant difference in CCR (p < 0. 001) and ADR (p < 0. 001) based on annual volume. Following multivariable regression, predictors of successful colonoscopy completion included annual colonoscopy volume, lower age, male sex, an <b>indication</b> of <b>screening</b> or surveillance, and a low ASA score. Predictors of adenoma detection included older age, male sex, an <b>indication</b> of <b>screening</b> or surveillance, and gastroenterology specialty. Conclusion.

40|$|PurposeTo assess cancers {{diagnosed}} and {{the stage}} of cancer {{at the time of}} diagnosis among low-income, underinsured, or uninsured women who received services through the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP). MethodsUsing the NBCCEDP database, we examined the number and percent of women diagnosed during 200922 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 2011 with in situ breast cancer, invasive breast cancer, and invasive cervical cancer by demographic and clinical characteristics, including age, race and ethnicity, test <b>indication</b> (<b>screening</b> or diagnostic), symptoms (for breast cancer), and screening history (for cervical cancer). We examined these characteristics by stage at diagnosis, a new variable included in the database obtained by linking with state-based central cancer registries. ResultsThere were 11, 569 women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer, 1, 988 with in situ breast cancer, and 583 with invasive cervical cancer through the NBCCEDP. Women who reported breast symptoms or who had diagnostic mammography {{were more likely to be}} diagnosed with breast cancer, and at a later stage, than those who did not have symptoms or who had screening mammography. Women who had been rarely or never screened for cervical cancer were more likely to be diagnosed with cervical cancer, and at a later stage, than women who received regular screenings.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The aims of {{this study}} were to {{investigate}} the motives for refusing or attending population-based screening for prostate cancer, in relation to various background characteristics. METHODS: The present study is part of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC), and took place in 1995 - 1996. Men aged 55 - 75 years were invited using the Rotterdam population registry (100 per cent coverage), of whom 42 per cent gave written informed consent. These men were randomized to receive either determination of prostate specific antigen (PSA), digital rectal examination (DRE), transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) and biopsy on <b>indication</b> (<b>screening</b> group), or no screening (control group). To 626 consecutive men of the screening group a questionnaire was sent before the screening. To 500 randomly selected refusers (no written informed consent) a similar questionnaire was sent, followed by two reminders. In both refusers and attenders we addressed motives, knowledge of prostate cancer, attitudes towards screening, background characteristics and urological complaints (American Urological Association symptom index, AUA 7). RESULTS: Response rates for questionnaires were 48 per cent in refusers and 99 per cent in attenders. Main reported motives for refusing were absence of urological complaints (57 per cent) and anticipated pain or discomfort (18 per cent). Main reported motives for attending were personal benefit (82 per cent), contribution to science (49 per cent) and presence of urological complaints (25 per cent). Compared with attenders, refusers were slightly and significantly older, less often married and had a lower level of education; they had less knowledge about prostate cancer and a less positive attitude towards screening; they had worse general health but fewer urological complaints (AUA 7 median 2 versus 4, p < 0. 001).

Successful fall prevention entails identifying at-risk elders and implementing measures that impede or minimize patient injury. This article examines the risk factors and clinical <b>indications</b> for <b>screening</b> community-dwelling elders who are at risk for falls. It focuses on three areas that can directly impact balance and performance of the elder: polypharmacy, frailty and compliance with safety recommendations. While most falls do not result in death or severe injury, the physical and emotional impact can result in decreased performance of activities of daily living and greatly reduce an individual's quality of life. Effective fall prevention not only entails an understanding of the intervention needs during acute and chronic phases post fall, but requires proactive strategies to decrease the risk factors that impact the elder's life leading to polypharmacy, frailty and the struggle for continued independence...|$|R

Efficacy was tested in a castrated male rat model at 3 doses (0. 4, 1. 0 and 1. 5 mg/kg) and assessed as inhibition of luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion. When increasing the dose, onset of inhibition was faster, inhibition was more intense, and duration of action was prolonged. The MP type was also highly influent. If spray-dried and microextrusion particles exhibited comparable potencies, double emulsion microspheres were significantly less potent, both for onset and duration of inhibition. Interestingly, for the latter type {{it was found that the}} degarelix fraction released upon reconstitution in the solution for injection was significantly lower (max 0. 3 %), in comparison to spray-dried MP (max 2 %) or microextrusion (max 4 %).

Ninety-five patients not meeting guidelines-based risk factors also had DXA completed (“not at-risk” group). 139 (70. 9 %) patients in “at-risk” group had low BMD, while 51 (53. 7 %) of “not-at-risk” patients had low BMD. Majority of the patients with osteoporosis (83. 3 %) missed by the current guidelines had low BMI. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that low BMI was the strongest risk factor for osteoporosis (OR 3. 07; 95 % CI, 1. 47 – 6. 42; P = 0. 003). Conclusions. Provider adherence to current guidelines is suboptimal. Low BMI can identify majority of the patients with osteoporosis that are missed by current guidelines...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTObjectives:To {{assess the}} {{prevalence}} of polyps in patients with {{a family history of}} colorectal cancer, in comparison to asymptomatic individuals with <b>indication</b> for <b>screening.</b> Methods:A prospective study in a group of patients who underwent colonoscopy between 2012 and 2014. Patients were divided into two groups: Group I: no family history of colorectal cancer, and Group II: with a family history in &# 64257;rst-degree relatives. Demographic characteristics, &# 64257;ndings on colonoscopy, presence, location and histological type of polyps were evaluated, comparing the two groups. Results: 214 patients were evaluated: 162 in Group I and 52 in Group II. The distribution of patients with polyps was similar in relation to gender: polyps were evidenced in Group I in 33 (20 %) female patients vs. 10 (6 %) male patients (p= 1. 00); in Group II, the presence of polyps was evidenced in 9 (17 %) female patients vs. 2 (4 %) male patients (p= 1. 00). Polypoid lesions were found in 54 patients (25 %), with 43 (26 %) in Group I and 11 (21 %) in Group II. The prevalence of adenomas was similar in both groups (Group I = 18 / 37 % vs. Group II = 10 / 50 %) (p= 0. 83). Conclusion:In this preliminary study, no correlation was found between prevalence of polyps and a family history of colorectal cancer...|$|R
