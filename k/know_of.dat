50|$|Little is <b>known</b> <b>of</b> their service, {{although}} the Americans captured one in November 1918. Nothing is <b>known</b> <b>of</b> their disposition after the Armistice.|$|R
50|$|Little is <b>known</b> <b>of</b> his background, {{except he}} had been a royal chaplain. So little was <b>known</b> <b>of</b> him, that the medieval historians, William of Malmesbury and Florence of Worcester mistakenly called him William instead of Godfrey.|$|R
50|$|He {{was married}} in 1420. There is no <b>known</b> {{portrait}} <b>of</b> Giambono and little is <b>known</b> <b>of</b> his personal life.|$|R
5|$|Although Michael Kopper {{worked at}} Enron {{for more than}} seven years, Lay did not <b>know</b> <b>of</b> Kopper even after the company's bankruptcy. Kopper was able to keep his name {{anonymous}} in the entire affair. Kopper was the first Enron executive to plead guilty. Chief Accounting Officer Rick Causey was indicted with six felony charges for disguising Enron's financial condition during his tenure. After pleading not guilty, he later switched to guilty and was sentenced to seven years in prison.|$|E
5|$|An event {{happened}} {{shortly after}} Khalid's capture of Marash (Kahramanmaraş), {{in the autumn}} of 638, he came to <b>know</b> <b>of</b> Ash'as, a famous poet and warrior on Persian front, reciting a poem in praise of Khalid and receiving a gift of 10,000 dirhams from him, apparently from the state treasury.|$|E
5|$|Ares: A {{large black}} flier (bat) bonded to Henry who chooses to save Gregor {{rather than his}} bond when the two fall off a cliff. He does not <b>know</b> <b>of</b> Henry's treachery until after the fact, and so Gregor decides to bond with him to save him from banishment.|$|E
50|$|What {{little is}} <b>known</b> <b>of</b> Powhatan is {{by way of}} wordlists {{recorded}} by William Strachey (about 500 words) and Captain John Smith (about 50 words). Smith also reported a pidgin form of Powhatan, but almost nothing is <b>known</b> <b>of</b> it.|$|R

5|$|As to Captain Benbow, I <b>know</b> <b>of</b> no {{difference}} between him and me, nor have we had any. He has no small obligation to me, but being called {{in some of the}} foolish printed papers ‘the famous Captain Benbow’, I suppose has put him a little out of himself, and has made him play the fool, as I guess, in some of his letters. I will not farther now particularize this business, but time will show I have not been in the wrong, unless being too kind to an ungrateful man.|$|E
5|$|Favre married Deanna Tynes on July 14, 1996. Together, {{they have}} two daughters, Brittany (born 1989) and Breleigh (born 1999). Brittany has given birth to two grandsons named Parker Brett (was born to Brittany on April 2, 2010) and A.J. The NFL stated {{that at the time}} it did not <b>know</b> <b>of</b> any other active players with grandchildren.|$|E
5|$|It {{is known}} McCudden proved remarkably good at {{stalking}} tactics, which {{enabled him to}} get up underneath an opponent, pull down the wing gun and fire up into the German machine. The first the recipients would <b>know</b> <b>of</b> the attack was bullets coming up through {{the bottom of the}} fuselage of the aircraft, often causing death or injury, holing petrol tanks and crippling engines. The gun, being fed by a drum of ammunition, could also be reloaded in its pulled-down position, the pilot having two or more spare drums located in his cockpit.|$|E

50|$|An {{additional}} {{point is}} that Garvey also <b>knew</b> <b>of</b> Fr. Raphael Morgan when McGuire joined his organization in 1920 (i.e. Fr. Raphael's letter of 1916), which makes it likely that McGuire and Garvey had discussed Morgan at some point, both having <b>known</b> <b>of</b> him.|$|R
5|$|Later in Acts, Peter preached {{the gospel}} to the {{household}} of Cornelius the Centurion, a gentile. While he preached, the Holy Spirit {{fell on the}} gentiles, {{and they began to}} speak in tongues. The Jewish believers with Peter were amazed, and the household was water baptized. While the apostle Paul was in Ephesus, he found disciples there and discovered that they did not <b>know</b> <b>of</b> the existence of the Holy Spirit and had only received John the Baptist’s baptism. After baptizing them in Jesus’ name, Paul laid his hands on them, and they began to speak in tongues and prophesy.|$|E
5|$|On May 12, Barrett {{instructed}} Colonel David Branson of the 34th Indiana Veteran Volunteer Infantry {{to attack}} the Confederate encampment at Brazos Santiago Depot near Fort Brown. Barrett commanded the 62nd United States Colored Infantry and the 2nd Texas Cavalry, and advanced towards Fort Brown {{with the intention of}} reoccupying Brownsville with Union forces thinking they would not encounter any problems, assuming all the Confederates surely had heard of Lee's surrender by this time. To their surprise they encountered Confederates that did not <b>know</b> <b>of</b> Lee's surrender.|$|E
5|$|On the {{one hand}} he didn't commit war crimes that we <b>know</b> <b>of</b> and ordered a retreat at El Alamein despite Hitler's order. But he took huge German {{casualties}} elsewhere {{and he was a}} servant of the regime. He was not exactly a shining liberal or Social Democrat. Mostly, he was interested in his career.|$|E

5|$|The Programming Language Committee was not well-known, however. The vice-president, William Rinehuls, {{complained that}} two-thirds of the COBOL {{community}} did not <b>know</b> <b>of</b> the committee's existence. It was also poor, lacking the funds to make public documents, such as minutes of meetings and change proposals, freely available.|$|E
5|$|The {{house that}} once stood at 3448 Pinkney Street in North Omaha, Nebraska, {{was the first}} home of Malcolm Little with his birth family. The house was torn down in 1965 by new owners who did not <b>know</b> <b>of</b> its {{connection}} with MalcolmX. The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984 and is now identified by a historic marker. In 1987 the site {{was added to the}} Nebraska register of historic sites and marked with a state plaque.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} use {{of slavery}} was in agriculture, {{the foundation of}} the Greek economy. Some small landowners might own one slave, or even two. An abundant literature of manuals for landowners (such as the Economy of Xenophon or that of Pseudo-Aristotle) confirms the presence of dozens of slaves on the larger estates; they could be common labourers or foremen. The extent to which slaves were used as a labour force in farming is disputed. It is certain that rural slavery was very common in Athens, and that ancient Greece did not <b>know</b> <b>of</b> the immense slave populations found on the Roman latifundia.|$|E

5|$|The sermon {{relies on}} scripture to emphasise the divine will in calling people {{to serve their}} fellow men, which is a common theme in Swift's sermons. This calling, as Swift claims, is based on {{historical}} events that reinforce scripture and allow mankind to <b>know</b> <b>of</b> the divine will. In particular, {{the development of the}} state and of the human body are parallel to each other, and England may soon be entering into a decline. However, Swift emphasises that man is imperfect, and that sin is a symbol of this imperfectness.|$|E
5|$|The {{site was}} {{split into two}} blocks: A and B. Block A was sited near Lime Grove and housed {{personnel}} accommodation and administrative services, while Block B was protected by brick walls and military police since it contained the codebreaking computers. The public footpath passed between the two blocks. The level of security meant that support staff in the administrative block did not <b>know</b> <b>of</b> the activities in Block B, nor did local residents.|$|E
5|$|When digital {{television}} launched on 1 January 2001, {{the majority of}} households did not <b>know</b> <b>of</b> or were unable to buy a set top box {{in order to receive}} the signal. Digital Broadcasting Australia was established in late 2000 to help make the transition to {{digital television}} as seamless for consumers as possible. It included representatives from free-to-air broadcasters, manufacturers, suppliers, and retailers and was intended to provide information about commencement dates, coverage, and the functionality and availability of equipment.|$|E
