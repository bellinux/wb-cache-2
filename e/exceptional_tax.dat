50|$|By the Decree of May 9, 1942, the tax {{reforms of}} December 1940 and October 1941 were {{incorporated}} into the Agreement with Álava. In brief, the Agreement included the Tax on Luxury Consumption, the Tax on Use and Consumption (a revival of the taxes on consumption abolished in 1911) and the <b>Exceptional</b> <b>Tax</b> on extraordinary profits. Besides, the collection of Income Tax {{was transferred to the}} Provincial Council of Álava, although with the same regulation as in other Spanish territories.|$|E
50|$|Nevertheless, the Jews {{still had}} to pay the jizya and <b>exceptional</b> <b>taxes</b> claimed by the bey {{according}} {{to the needs and}} were also subject to discrimination. Jews had restricted dress code, according to which they were obliged to wear a black chechia (and not red, like the Muslims), a black or dark blue turban (and not white) and black shoes and not of bright color. They could not live outside their assigned neighborhoods and could not access real estate. Finally, when they were victims of vexations or violence, they did not receive reparation for the harm they have suffered.|$|R
5000|$|Slowly but {{systematically}} an-Nasir Muhammad {{increased his}} power as Sultan and took revenge on the emirs who had mistreated {{him in the}} past and on the emirs who plotted against him after his return to Egypt. He abolished a few official positions, seized the wealth and property of corrupt officials, discharged the Oirat Mongols from royal service and annulled the <b>exceptional</b> <b>taxes</b> and surcharges (Mikoos) [...] which were imposed on the common people by the authorities and which enriched officials and made the emirs more powerful. He employed Emir Ibn al-Waziri, a man who was known to be tough on corruption, as the head of Dar al-Adl (Court of Justice) [...] and every Monday the Sultan would listen to complaints from the common people against the officials and the emirs. He prohibited his governors from executing or physically punishing convicts without his permission and he shut an infamous prison that was near the Citadel. In 1314 he abolished the post of vice-Sultan. In 1315 he carried out a land survey to re-establish the amount of the taxes which the land owners and the landlords had to pay to the state.|$|R
5000|$|A {{descendant}} {{of one of}} the oldest families of Lithuania and Samogitia, he took a special interest {{in the development of the}} industry and commerce of Poland and Lithuania, and to this end considered it of the utmost importance to utilize the energy and the abilities of the Jewish inhabitants. Together with Castellan Yezierski and other Liberal members of the [...] "last" [...] Polish Sejm, he endeavored to prove to the Polish representatives how harmful to the welfare of the country was the abnormal position of the Jews, and urged the taking of measures leading toward their emancipation. In 1789 he elaborated a plan for transforming the Jews into useful citizens, which he set forth in a pamphlet entitled Sposób Uformowania Zydów Polskich w Pozytecznych Krajowi Obywatelow (Warsaw), and which he submitted to King Stanislaus Poniatowsky at the session of the Diet of Dec. 4, asking the king to favor it with his support. In this pamphlet he points out that the Polish law did not include the Jews in the three estates of the realm (the nobility, country gentry, and burgesses); that the Polish legislation had always regarded the Jews as a foreign element, and, though burdening them with <b>exceptional</b> <b>taxes,</b> had not granted them the rights of citizens, while (he argues) Polish society had treated them with contempt, defamed their religion, and would not tolerate the notion that a Jew could be a son of his fatherland. He adds: ...|$|R
5000|$|Stanton {{also argued}} that the Sixteenth Amendment [...] "authorizes only an <b>exceptional</b> direct income <b>tax</b> without apportionment, to which the tax in {{question}} does not conform" [...] and that therefore the income tax was [...] "not within the authority of that Amendment." [...] The Court also rejected this argument and upheld {{the constitutionality of the}} income tax under the 1913 Revenue Act.|$|R
40|$|Are natural {{resources}} a blessing or a curse? As {{a matter of}} fact, few countries with abundant {{natural resources}} have succeeded in combining growth and development. What may account for this apparent paradox? Our analysis suggests that the institutional development of a country (at {{the time of the}} discovery of the natural resources) is the key factor explaining why a vicious or a virtuous circle of growth may develop. If the institutions are sufficiently well-established and strong enough to face predation behaviours, the country will then benefit from its substratum. On the other hand, insecure property rights (as is typical of countries with weaker institutions) will fuel predation behaviours around rent-production. To secure their property rights, fi rms will have no other option but to resort to corruption by transferring part of their rents into bribes, <b>exceptional</b> <b>taxes,</b> extortion racket, etc. The increase in these predation behaviours then limits the direct investment flow from foreign countries and blocks the country's development. This in turn will establish a climate of corruption in an economy with low production development. In countries where natural resources are abundant, insecure property rights are thus detrimental in several ways. First, direct investment in the exploitation of resources is suboptimal. This has a proportional negative effect on the country's budget by lowering the tax revenue and limiting the country's development. The extraction potential, and thus the country's enrichment, is constrained by these insecure property rights. Besides, the climate of corruption, generated by the securing of these property rights, deters foreign investors from settling on the national market and locks the country in a poverty trap. The country only attracts firms belonging to sectors connected to natural resources and thus becomes dependent on the rate of raw materials and the exploitation of natural resources. When a state budget depends on exploitation rent at the expense of taxes on citizens, the democratic control of civil society is weakened and the convergence of the institutions towards an autocratic state is favoured, for lack of a strong system of checks and balances. In a moribund economy where investors (in particular foreign ones) are reluctant to value the country's potential, the inequalities generated by a corrupt government which grows richer through mining and oil revenues, and the empoverishment of the population, may result in political unrest leading to conflicts...|$|R
40|$|In {{comparing}} {{the impact of}} corporate taxation and social insurance on foreign direct investment (FDI) and unemployment, the paper derives four main results: (i) the optimal size {{of the welfare state}} depends on the degree of risk-aversion, the unemployment rate and the excess burden of labor taxes. Unemployment partly reflects the country's exposure to globalization; (ii) corporate taxation and social insurance can have equivalent effects on unemployment and outbound FDI; (iii) while an increase in the corporate tax raises corporate tax revenue, it is likely to worsen total fiscal stance; (iv) a corporate tax should be used to contribute to welfare state financing only in <b>exceptional</b> cases. Corporate <b>tax,</b> foreign direct investment, unemployment, welfare state...|$|R
40|$|This Article {{argues that}} it is {{misleading}} to declare the death of tax exceptionalism and that structural tax exceptionalism may have important benefits. Part II provides a brief historical overview {{of the rise of}} federal agency administration of statutes and especially tax laws. The history trends to detract from anti-tax and anti-agency rhetoric that counsel disempowering the Treasury Department and other administrative agencies from comprehensively enforcing laws and making policy in their relevant domains. Part III analyzes how the Code 2 ̆ 7 s structure for tax administration differs from the APA template for administrative agencies. Part IV deconstructs these differences, drawing from general administrative law scholarship to identify potential advantages and drawbacks of structural tax exceptionalism. This Article concludes by recommending caution before dismantling the <b>exceptional</b> features of <b>tax</b> administration...|$|R
2500|$|Stanton {{argued that}} the tax law was unconstitutional and void under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution in that the law denied [...] "to mining {{companies}} and their stockholders {{equal protection of the}} laws and deprive them of their property without due process of law". The Court rejected that argument. Stanton also {{argued that the}} Sixteenth Amendment [...] "authorizes only an <b>exceptional</b> direct income <b>tax</b> without apportionment, to which the tax in question does not conform" [...] and that therefore the income tax was [...] "not within the authority of that Amendment". The Court also rejected this argument. Thus, the U.S. Supreme Court, in upholding the constitutionality of the income tax under the 1913 Act, contradicts those tax protesters arguments that the income tax is unconstitutional under either the Fifth Amendment or the Sixteenth Amendment.|$|R
40|$|We apply a novel {{decomposition}} of panel data on individual incomes in 30 countries {{and find the}} US is exceptional in its increases of income risk over the last decades. Income risk is decomposed into long-run inequality, intertemporal variability around individual-specific growth rates (volatility), and variation in individual-specific growth rates (mobility risk) using a decomposable generalized entropy measure. We also measure {{the degree to which}} the government tax and transfer system lowers longrun inequality, intertemporal variation, and mobility risk, and again the US is <b>exceptional,</b> with the <b>tax</b> and transfer system lowering the risk of net income less in the US than in other developed countries we examine. We further find that growth rates are positively associated with long-run mean incomes in most countries, implying growth tends not to be pro-poor, and that volatility tends to be higher for those with higher long-run mean incomes, so that form of risk may be progressively distributed...|$|R
40|$|The attitude—common among tax professionals—that tax {{is special}} (mostly {{because of its}} {{supposedly}} unique complexity), and that special legal rules should apply in the tax context, has been described and excoriated by scholars as 2 ̆ 2 tax exceptionalism 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 tax myopia. 2 ̆ 2 The Supreme Court dealt tax exceptionalism a grievous blow in its 2011 opinion in Mayo Foundation for Medical Education 2 ̆ 6 Research v. United States, in which it held that the Chevron standard for determining the validity of regulations applied in tax just as it applied in other fields. One commentator gleefully celebrated Mayo as the death knell of tax exceptionalism, declaring, 2 ̆ 2 The tax world finally recognized a stark {{fact of life in}} 2011 : Tax law is not special. 2 ̆ 2 This Article offers, with numerous hedges and qualifications, a defense of the exceptionalists and of exceptionalism. It makes three points for the defense. First, {{it is not so much}} tax professionals who think tax is special; rather, the view of tax as a thing apart is held most strongly by everyone else. Second, to the extent tax professionals do believe that tax is special, they resemble antitrust lawyers who think that antitrust is special, bankruptcy lawyers who think that bankruptcy is special, and so on. In other words, there is nothing <b>exceptional</b> about <b>tax</b> exceptionalism. And, finally, to the extent tax professionals not only think tax is special but also think it is more special than, say, antitrust lawyers think that antitrust is special, they may not be altogether wrong. Maybe tax really is just a little bit special, after all...|$|R
40|$|The OMX-case entailed {{considerable}} {{uncertainty about}} the relationship between tax treaties and Swedish domestic law. Previous approaches to handle rule conflict between them was put out of action for the first time when an internal rule took precedence over tax treaties. The Greece-case came a few years later where there were hopes that it would be decided in plenary session to return to the view that prevailed before the OMX-case, which did not happen. Instead the Supreme Administrative Court ruled that the tax treaties shall in principle be given preference, but that in <b>exceptional</b> situations <b>tax</b> treaties can be infringed to an internal rule's benefit, so called tax treaty override. Such procedure is acceptable if the legislature gives "clear expression" of the intention of a certain type of income is to be taxed in Sweden, or that a particular new rule applies regardless of the provisions in tax treaties. The purpose of this thesis is to analyze the supreme administrative courts management of rule collision between domestic law and tax treaties in the Greece-case. Further analysis of the requirement "clear expression" shall take place and the basis of why the supreme administrative court justifies tax treaty override shall also be analyzed. The conclusion presented in this thesis initially includes problems that arise to conclude the meaning of the term "clear expression" and that application difficulties arise because the supreme administrative court did not provide further guidance of its meaning. Secondly, that the supreme administrative court justify tax treaty override occasionally since there is no constitutional or procedural obstacles for a newer internal law to expand the Swedish taxation when an already implemented taxation agreement restricts it...|$|R
