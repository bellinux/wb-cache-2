5|$|Gilbert had {{previously}} been investigated by Eugene at Paris in April 1147, but this hearing came to nothing for two reasons. One was that Gilbert's opponents were not unified in what they opposed in Gilbert's teachings. The second reason was {{that no one had}} a copy of the treatise on Boethius by Gilbert that was in dispute. Prior to the second hearing at Reims, Bernard of Clairvaux, who was opposed to Gilbert's teachings, held a private meeting with a number of the attendees, where Bernard attempted to pressure them to condemn Gilbert. This offended the various cardinals in attendance, who then proceeded to <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were the only persons who could judge the case.|$|E

25|$|Self-verification strivings {{may have}} {{undesirable}} consequences {{for people with}} negative self-views (depressed people and those who suffer from low self-esteem). For example, self-verification strivings may cause people with negative self-views to gravitate toward partners who mistreat them, undermine their feelings of self-worth, or even abuse them. And if people with negative self-views seek therapy, returning home to a self-verifying partner may undo the progress that was made there. Finally, in the workplace, the feelings of worthlessness that plague people with low self-esteem may foster feelings of ambivalence about receiving fair treatment, feelings that may undercut their propensity to <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> get what they deserve from their employers (see: workplace bullying).|$|E
25|$|After {{months passed}} without an agreement, a harsh {{war of words}} erupted in the media in February 2007. The Twins angrily {{cancelled}} a planned unveiling of the ballpark design scheduled for February 15, declaring that the entire project was in jeopardy. Jerry Bell of the Twins and Mike Opat of Hennepin County gave multiple interviews in which they described the land owners as being “unwilling sellers,” “greedy,” “lawyered-up,” painted them as “greedy landowners in black hats,” and as not negotiating in good faith. Lambrecht and Pogin continued to <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{had an obligation to}} their investors to secure nothing more than “fair market value” for the land. They repeatedly said that they would accept whatever valuation was determined in eminent domain proceedings, while media reports would later reveal their internal valuation (required by eminent domain laws) to be $65 million.|$|E
25|$|The {{incident}} {{that marked the}} turning point of Indo-LTTE relationship occurred in early October. On 4 October 1987, the Sri Lankan Navy captured an LTTE boat off Point Pedro with seventeen Tigers, including some high-profile leaders of the movement, on board. The Colombo govt alleged the boat was involved in smuggling arms across the Palk Straits and on the grounds denied immunity to these captured Tiger rebels. The LTTE denied this claiming the rebels movement {{were in accordance with}} the truce, being in the process of transferring documents for shifting the Tigers Headquarters from Madras to Jaffna. The Sinhalese government intended to bring a number of the rebels captured, including Pulendran, Kumarappa and others, to trial in Colombo for allegedly masterminding the massacre of a hundred and fifty civilians. The Tigers, who were at the time still in negotiation with the Indian authorities, appealed for enforcement of protection by the IPKF. The rebels were at this time in IPKF custody at Palali Airbase pending transfer to Sinhalese authorities. Although the Indian authorities <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had explained the possible repercussions of such an action on the fragile truce and exerted considerable pressure on the Sinhalese authorities to desist from proceeding, ultimately the IPKF withdrew allowing the Sri Lankan forces to proceed with transferring the captured rebels to Colombo. The detainees however, attempted mass suicide by swallowing cyanide- a common LTTE practice when faced imminent capture. The night of 5 October saw large scale slaughter of Sinhalese people who had returned to Jaffna, including eight troops of the Sri Lankan Army who were at the time being held hostages by the LTTE. These coincided by armed confrontations between the Tiger Cadres and the Indian Troops in and around Jaffna. On 8 October, the LTTE carried out a number of mortar attacks and ambushes on the IPKF.|$|E

The owner, Jimmy, agrees, but he does not wish to pay them with money; instead he gives them a free pop and {{a sandwich}} each day. Miranda, Annemarie, and Colin discover a Fred Flintstone bank in the back of sandwich shop. Colin, wanting {{to see more of the}} bank, is pulled way by Annemarie insisting that Jimmy could find them. The next day, Jimmy fires the three workers, thinking that one of them stole the Flintstone bank, when it was actually the laughing man who stole it. The workers write a card, give it to Jimmy and <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> did not steal the bank. Jimmy believes them and let them work at the sandwich shop. He then tells them that he figured out who stole the bank. He thinks that it is Julia, a classmate in their class, and a best friend to Annemarie. He [...] thinks she did it because she is African American. This upsets Annemarie greatly and she immediately quits her job.|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of 6 April 1951, Truman held a meeting in his office with Marshall, Bradley, Acheson and Harriman to discuss what would be done about MacArthur. Harriman was emphatically in favor of MacArthur's relief, but Bradley opposed it. George Marshall asked for more time to {{consider}} the matter. Acheson was personally in favor of relieving MacArthur but did not disclose this. Instead, he warned Truman {{that it would be}} [...] "the biggest fight of your administration." [...] At a second meeting the next day, Marshall and Bradley continued to oppose relief. On 8 April, the Joint Chiefs met with Marshall in his office. Each of the chiefs in turn expressed the opinion that MacArthur's relief was desirable from a [...] "military point of view," [...] but they recognized that military considerations were not paramount. They were concerned that [...] "if MacArthur were not relieved, a large segment of our people would charge that civil authorities no longer controlled the military." [...] The four advisers met with Truman in his office again on 9 April. Bradley informed the President of the views of the Joint Chiefs, and Marshall added that he agreed with them. Truman wrote in his diary that [...] "it is of unanimous opinion of all that MacArthur be relieved. All four so advise." [...] Later, before Congress, the Joint Chiefs would <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had only [...] "concurred" [...] with the relief, not [...] "recommended" [...] it.|$|E

2500|$|Harry Pfanz {{provides}} an alternative view that contrasts with Tate's: [...] "Although the Confederates wrote and spoke of occupying {{the crest of}} the hill and capturing the batteries there, Union accounts concede less Confederate success. The sparse accounts of Wiedrich's battery say that the Confederates attacked suddenly and violently and entered the battery's position but <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were there only briefly." [...] The collapse of [...] "Cemetery Hill, the keystone of the Union line," [...] "would have certainly required Meade to at least abandon his position" [...] at Gettysburg, but the following day, artillery anchored here aided the repulse of the famous attack by Pickett, Pettigrew, Trimble, Wilcox & Lang.|$|E

2500|$|On April 27, 1960, {{immediately}} after the resignation of Syngman Rhee, U.S. Ambassador to Japan Douglas MacArthur II sent a telegram to J.

This is very serious and permanent irritant in Japan-ROK relations and {{there can be no}} over-all ROK-Japan settlement until this Japanese island is returned to Japan. Therefore we should also press new ROK regime to return Takeshima to Japan."

2500|$|In 1921, Edward S. Ninde wrote: [...] "None {{would claim}} {{that she was}} a poetess in any large sense. Her hymns... have been {{severely}} criticised. Dr. Julian, the editor of the Dictionary of Hymnology, says that 'they are, with few exceptions, very weak and poor,' and others <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are 'crudely sentimental'. Some hymn books will give them no place whatever". According to Glimpses of Christian History, Crosby's [...] "hymns have sometimes been criticized as 'gushy and mawkishly sentimental' and critics have often attacked both her writing and her theology. Nonetheless, they were meaningful to her contemporaries and hymn writer George C. Stebbins stated, 'There was probably no writer in her day who appealed more to the valid experience of the Christian life or who expressed more sympathetically the deep longings of the human heart than Fanny Crosby.' And many of her hymns have stood the test of time, still resonating with believers today".|$|E

[...] Diego Perez Jimenez, then president of Las Abejas, expressed his frustration with those who claim that justice has already been served, or that some who have been prosecuted ought not to be imprisoned: [...] "They tell so many lies," [...] he says. [...] "These guys in jails were killers, and there are more killers out there. [...] That's the truth," [...] he insists. [...] Many of those imprisoned, however, <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are not guilty, such as Agostin Gomez Perez, who has been imprisoned for more than a decade. [...] "What happened in Acteal is very sad," [...] he says, [...] "But I wasn't involved in it. [...] I didn't kill a soul."

2500|$|The Indians {{always insisted}} that they took no prisoners. If they did—a thing I firmly believe—they were {{tortured}} and killed {{the night of the}} 25th.

2500|$|Dean {{conceded that}} the speech did not project the best image, jokingly {{referring}} {{to it as a}} [...] "crazy, red-faced rant" [...] on the Late Show with David Letterman. [...] In an interview later that week with Diane Sawyer, he said he was [...] "a little sheepish ... but I'm not apologetic." [...] Sawyer and many others in the national broadcast news media later expressed some regret about overplaying the story. [...] In fact, CNN issued a public apology and admitted in a statement that they indeed may have [...] "overplayed" [...] the incident. [...] The incessant replaying of the [...] "Dean Scream" [...] by the press became a debate on the topic of whether Dean was the victim of media bias. [...] The scream scene was shown an estimated 633 times by cable and broadcast news networks in just four days following the incident, a number that does not include talk shows and local news broadcasts. [...] However, those who were in the actual audience that day <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were not aware of the infamous [...] "scream" [...] until they returned to their hotel rooms and saw it on TV. [...] Dean said after the general election in 2004 that his microphone only picked up his voice and did not also capture the loud cheering he received from the audience {{as a result of the}} speech. [...] On January 27 Dean finished second to Kerry in the New Hampshire primary. [...] As late as one week before the first votes were cast in Iowa's caucuses, Dean had enjoyed a 30% lead in New Hampshire opinion polls; accordingly, this loss represented another major setback to his campaign.|$|E
