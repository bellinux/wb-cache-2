50|$|The Benefit Financing Model is {{composed}} of two programs. Program One, the Projection Program, {{is based on the}} methodology of empirical econometric modeling. It uses regressions to derive mathematical relationships between key UI variables, and projects UI benefits, taxable wages, as well as workload variables on quarterly basis twelve years into the future. Program Two, the <b>Financial</b> <b>Forecast</b> Program, is based on the methodology of simulation modeling. It estimates Unemployment Trust Fund (UTF) income by simulating the workings of the State's taxation system. Combined with the UTF outgo estimated by the Projection Program, the <b>Financial</b> <b>Forecast</b> Program is capable of projecting the dynamic flow of the Unemployment Trust Fund on quarterly basis under different economic and legislative scenarios. Furthermore, the <b>Financial</b> <b>Forecast</b> Program also assesses the adequacy level of the UTF under different scenarios and report solvency measures (such as Reserve Ratio, Average high cost multiple, etc.)on annual basis. If the trust fund should become insolvent and borrowing from the Federal Government is projected, the Program is able to assess loan interests, any reduced FUTA credits (also known as FUTA credit reduction), and other key loan variables. Lastly, the Projection Program can also be run independently to perform benefit cost estimation as well as workload forecasting.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Financial {{forecasting}} is {{the basis}} for budgeting activities and estimating future financing needs. Applying machine learning and data mining models to <b>financial</b> <b>forecasting</b> is both effective and efficient. Among different kinds of machine learning models, kernel methods are well accepted since they are more robust and accurate than traditional models, such as neural networks. However, learning from multiple data sources {{is still one of the}} main challenges in the <b>financial</b> <b>forecasting</b> area. In this paper, we focus on applying the multiple kernel learning models to the multiple major international stock indexes. Our experiment results indicate that applying multiple kernel learning to the <b>financial</b> <b>forecasting</b> problem suffers from both the short training period problem and nonstationary problem. Therefore we propose a novel multiple kernel learning model to address the challenge by introducing the Gompertz model and considering a non-linear combination of different kernel matrices. The experiment results show that our Gompertz multiple kernel learning model addresses the challenges and achieves better performance than the original multiple kernel learning model and single SVM models.

40|$|A hubris {{theory of}} {{entrepreneurship}} suggests that <b>financial</b> <b>forecasts</b> are often {{informed by the}} use of heuristic methods prone to overconfidence. While overconfidence can be advantageous during the start-up phase, it is also linked to overoptimistic forecasts, non-optimal outcomes and firm failure. This paper uses a data set from 203 micro and small firms operating in North West Italy where overconfidence is measured as the difference between budget estimates and actual results for Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA), owners’ equity and borrowing costs. These measures are employed to identify the extent of overconfidence by entrepreneurs in their <b>financial</b> <b>forecasts</b> and to analyse any relationship between overconfidence and the characteristics of the entrepreneur and the firm. A further probit analysis is employed to investigate any association between overconfident <b>financial</b> <b>forecasts</b> and subsequent firm failure. The results are consistent with the hypotheses, suggesting that the majority of entrepreneurs are prone to overconfident budgetary forecasts that are directly associated with firm failure. Such overconfidence is mitigated by an entrepreneur’s level of educational attainment and the use of budgetary controls...|$|R

5000|$|Frontal attack: This {{strategy}} is {{specifically designed to}} engage the opposition with a head on frontal assault. This also means using {{a substantial amount of}} resources and financial commitment when taking on a competitor with this strategy. From marketing to the production process all elements are activated when initiating such an abrasive move. Advertising campaigns and new products are usually intensified to take on the competition where they are strongest this is to weaken their market share and margins by cutting off their leading products and influencing their targeted audience to re-evaluate their loyalty to the brand or product. It is rare to encounter such strategies, as the process is quite expensive and time consuming this is also a high risk venture if the competition has a strong counter offensive attack which, can leave the attacking opponent open to counter strikes. With resources already stretched this {{strategy is}} not for the faint hearted. Shayne Milligan explains that this type of strategy is only used when the market space is homogenous, brand equity is low, customer loyalty is low, products are poorly differentiated, the competitor has relatively low resources or the attacker has stronger resources (Shayne Milligan. 2013). E.g. In 2011 the US shopping giant Target had entered the Canadian market with financial investments exceeding 4.4 billion dollars. Part of this initial investment was allocated towards purchasing 220 previously acquired stores of Zellers a local Canadian merchandising mogul. With almost 10 million being spent on the refurbishing of each store as well as the hiring of 150-200 employees per store. The <b>financial</b> <b>forecast</b> for the Target Corporation was estimated to be around 6 billion per year by the year of 2017. This was not to be the case as Targets initiating year in the Canadian retail market failed to achieve any realistic financial goals. Even though the success of Targets US stores were still in affect the underestimated planning into the Canadian market was due to Unforeseen economic variables as well as Canadian loyalty to stores also owned by US parent companies Wal-Mart and Costco’s etc. Such competition had put the Target Corporation in a position at risk of making more loses than profits, which would also effect their US based stores. Taking on Wal-Mart and other foreign and domestic competition has been unsuccessful but Target continues to move towards dominating some part of the Canadian retail market (2015).|$|E

We opt for a data-centric approach to this issue, paying particular (but not exclusive) attention to real world datasets from the <b>financial</b> <b>forecasting</b> domain. <b>Financial</b> <b>forecasting</b> is an alluring endeavour that does not enjoy the sort of widely acknowledged success as do other popular areas of EC application such as circuit design, scheduling or industrial process control. Data believed to be pertinent to <b>financial</b> <b>forecasting</b> tends to be large and multi-dimensional, it is extremely non-linear and abundant with such a degree of noise that {{it has led to}} the popular school of thought that <b>forecasting</b> <b>financial</b> datasets is fundamentally impossible.
