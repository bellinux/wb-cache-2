40|$|A {{theoretical}} model describing the plasma-assisted growth of carbon nanofibres (CNFs) {{that accounts for}} the nanostructure heating by ion and <b>etching</b> <b>gas</b> fluxes from the plasma is developed. Using the model, it is shown that fluxes from the plasma environment can substantially increase {{the temperature of the}} catalyst nanoparticle located {{on the top of the}} CNF with respect to the substrate temperature. The difference between the catalyst and the substrate temperatures depends on the substrate width, the length of the CNF, the neutral gas density and temperature as well as the densities of the ions and atoms of the <b>etching</b> <b>gas.</b> In addition to the heating of the nanostructure, the ions and <b>etching</b> <b>gas</b> atoms from the ionized gas environment also strongly affect the CNF growth rates. Due to ion bombardment, the CNF growth rates in plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition may be much higher than the rates in similar neutral gas-based thermal processes. The CNF growth model, which accounts for the nanostructure heating by the plasma-generated species, provides the growth rates that are in better agreement with the available experimental data on CNF growth than the models in which the heating effects are ignored...|$|R
50|$|The {{fundamental}} steps in contact fabrication are semiconductor surface cleaning, contact metal deposition, patterning and annealing. Surface cleaning may {{be performed by}} sputter-etching, chemical etching, reactive <b>gas</b> <b>etching</b> or ion milling. For example, the native oxide of silicon may be removed with an hydrofluoric acid dip, while GaAs is more typically cleaned by a bromine-methanol dip. After cleaning, metals are deposited via sputter deposition, evaporation or chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Sputtering is a faster and more convenient method of metal deposition than evaporation but the ion bombardment from the plasma may induce surface states or even invert the charge carrier type at the surface. For this reason the gentler but still rapid CVD is increasingly preferred. Patterning of contacts is accomplished with standard photolithographic methods such as lift-off, where contact metal is deposited through holes in a photoresist layer that is later dissolved away. Post-deposition annealing of contacts is useful for relieving stress {{as well as for}} inducing any desirable reactions between the metal and the semiconductor.|$|E

The homoepitaxial growth shows that the complex (facets & steps) pattern expands and merges during the growth to bring on a rough epi-layer surface in the edge region.

Using Ni coated Si as the catalyzed substrate, CH 4 as the carbon source, H 2, NH 3 and water vapor mixtures as the dilution and <b>etching</b> <b>gas,</b> CNTs were grown under temperatures of 630 o C and 750 o C.

In 15 % CH 4 gas mixtures, CNTs can grown well within an addition of 3 % NH 3 which showed an improvement of CNTs quality, but no product was founded when adding the NH 3 content over 8 %.

40|$|Various MEMS devices like Accelerometers, Resonators, RF- Filters, Micropumps, Microvalves, Microdispensers and Microthrusters are {{produced}} by removing {{the bulk of the}} substrate materials. Fabrications of such Microsystems requires the ability to engineer precise three-dimensional structures in the silicon substrate. Fabrication of MEMS faces multiple technological challenges before it can become a commercially viable technology. One key fabrication process required is the deep silicon etching for forming high aspect ratio structures. There is an increasing interest in the use of dry plasma etching for this application because of its anisotropic etching behavior, high etch speed, good uniformity and profile control, high aspect ratio capabilities without having any undesired secondary effects i. e. RIE lags, Loading, microloading, loosing of anisotropic nature of etching as aspect ratio increases, micro-grass and even etch stalling. Developing a DRIE micro-machining process requires a thorough understanding of all plasma parameters, which can affect a silicon etching process and their use to suppress the secondary effects. In this paper our intention is to investigate the influence of <b>etching</b> <b>gas</b> flow, <b>etching</b> <b>gas</b> pressure, passivation gas pressure, ICP coil power, Platen power and etch and passivation time sequence on etch rate and side wall profile.

30|$|Surface plasmons (excitations on a rough {{metallic}} surface by {{the interaction}} between light and the metal nanoparticles) were suggested {{as a way to}} significantly enhance the light emission efficiency in LEDs[12]. Several methods have been suggested to fabricate metal nanoparticles (NPs) on LEDs to improve their efficiency. These include thermal annealing process[13 – 16], chemical synthesis[17], and <b>gas</b> <b>etching</b> technique. For noble metal nanoparticles on GaN surfaces, the collective oscillations of the electrons are localized surface plasmons (LSPs)[18, 19]. Under the resonance condition, this LSP effect enables the metallic nanoparticles to capture the trapped light in the p-GaN layer of the LEDs, enhancing the extracted efficiency of the light. However, the LSP resonance effect is affected by the geometry and separation of the nanoparticles. When noble metal nanoparticles are fabricated with a thermal annealing process, it is important to control the distribution and size of the nanoparticles. Furthermore, the residual metal after the annealing process has a negative influence on the device performance.|$|E

Patterned ye film is observed on the substrate in this scanning electron microscope (SEM) photograph. Slightly roughened ye film surface is also observed; how-ever, the pattern shape was kept like the original drawing pattern. In Fig. 11, SiO 2 surface after removing dye resist is shown. A ~m order line and space pattern is observed. By our laser equipment, a laser beam was focused about 1. 5 ~m diameter. It is {{difficult to get a}} narrower dye mask pat-tern. However, submicrometer pattern dye film (10) has been observed using an optical recording disk head.
