5|$|Floatovoltaics are an {{emerging}} form of PV systems that float {{on the surface}} of irrigation canals, water reservoirs, quarry lakes, and tailing ponds. Several systems exist in France, India, Japan, Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States. These systems reduce the need of valuable land area, save drinking water that would otherwise be lost through evaporation, and show a higher efficiency of solar <b>energy</b> <b>conversion,</b> as the panels are kept at a cooler temperature than they would be on land. Although not floating, other dual-use facilities with solar power include fisheries.|$|E

40|$|The {{stability}} of baroclinic flows with horizontal shear over sloping topography is analyzed with {{special emphasis on}} the structure and energetics of the unstable perturbations. The study is conducted by using a linearized two-layer quasi-geostrophic channel model for different topography profiles and distributions of the basic velocity field. Interactions between the two fluid layers and the <b>energy</b> <b>conversions</b> by the unstable perturbations are described. It is found that topography sloping as (opposed to) the fluid interface contributes to enhance the perturbation amplitude in the upper (lower) layer relative to the lower (upper) layer.

40|$|In an {{ensemble}} of Regional Climate Model (RCM) simulations where different members are initialised {{at different times}} but driven by identical lateral boundary conditions, the individual members provide different, but equally acceptable, weather sequences. In others words, RCM simulations exhibit the phenomenon of Internal Variability (or inter-member variability— IV), defined as the spread between members in {{an ensemble}} of simulations. Our recent studies reveal that RCM’s IV is associated with <b>energy</b> <b>conversions</b> similar to those taking place in weather systems. By analogy with the classical work on global energetics of weather systems, a formulation of an energy cycle for IV has been developed that is applicable over limited-area domains. Prognostic equations for ensemble-mean kinetic energy and available enthalpy are decomposed into contributions due to ensemble-mean variables and those due to deviations from the ensemble mean (IV). Together these equations constitute an energy cycle for IV in ensemble simulations of an RCM. A 50 -member ensemble of 1 -year simulations that differ only in their initial conditions was performed with the fifth-generation Canadian RCM (CRCM 5) over an eastern North America domain. The various energy reservoirs of IV and exchange terms between reservoirs were evaluated; the results show a remarkably close parallel between the <b>energy</b> <b>conversions</b> associated with IV in ensemble simulations of RCM and the <b>energy</b> <b>conversions</b> taking place in weather systems in the real atmosphere...|$|R
