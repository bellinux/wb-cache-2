40|$|Collective {{behaviors}} often spread via the self-reinforcing {{dynamics of}} critical mass. In collective behaviors with strongly self-reinforcing <b>dynamics,</b> <b>incentives</b> to participate increase {{with the number}} of participants, such that incentives are highest when the full population has adopted the behavior. By contrast, when collective behaviors have weakly self-reinforcing <b>dynamics,</b> <b>incentives</b> to participate “peak out” early, leaving a residual fraction of non-participants. In systems of collective action, this residual fraction constitutes free riders, who enjoy the collective good without contributing anything themselves. This “free rider problem” has given rise to a research tradition in collective action that shows how free riding can be eliminated by increasing the incentives for participation, and thereby making cooperation strongly self-reinforcing. However, we show that when the incentives to participate have weakly self-reinforcing dynamics, which allow free riders, collective behaviors will have significantly greater long term stability than when the incentives have strongly self-reinforcing dynamics leading to full participation...|$|R
40|$|How spiking {{networks}} {{are able to}} perform probabilistic inference is an intriguing question, not only for understanding information processing in the brain, but also for transferring these computational principles to neuromorphic silicon circuits. A number of computationally powerful spiking network models have been proposed, {{but most of them}} have only been tested, under ideal conditions, in software simulations. Any implementation in an analog, physical system, be it in vivo or in silico, will generally lead to <b>distorted</b> <b>dynamics</b> due to the physical properties of the underlying substrate. In this paper, we discuss several such distortive effects that are difficult or impossible to remove by classical calibration routines or parameter training. We then argue that hierarchical networks of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons can offer the required robustness for physical implementation and demonstrate this with both software simulations and emulation on an accelerated analog neuromorphic device.

40|$|In this paper, a market-based {{decomposition}} {{method for}} decomposable linear systems is developed. The solution process iterates between a master problem that solves the market-matching problem, and subproblems that solve the agents' bundle-determination problems. Starting from any initial price and feasible allocation, system optimality {{can be achieved}} under a dynamic market-trading algorithm in {{a finite number of}} trades. The final market-clearing prices are discovered by this market trading and an efficient allocation is achieved by direct, wealth-improving resource exchanges among self-interested agents. Certain types of strategic behavior by the agents and a dealer in the marketplace are studied as well. Our proposed market mechanism addresses price <b>dynamics,</b> <b>incentive</b> issues, and economic transactions of real-world, distributed decision-making situations more realistically than traditional decomposition approaches. In addition, it can be operated in both synchronous and asynchronous environments. We provide a market-based paradigm for decentralized problem solving and information processing that can be easily implemented to support real-time optimization of distributed systems. market-based, decomposition, algorithm, distributed systems, resource allocation...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 06 Networks of many nonlinearly-coupled {{dynamical}} {{components are}} ubiquitous {{in the physical}} sciences, but often difficult to characterize. However, their dynamics are often low-dimensional, being dominated by a few functional, coherent patterns. We wish to understand: (1) How do nonlinear networks generate functional responses? (2) What role does the network's structure play in generating such responses? (3) To what extent are the network dynamics robust to network damage? Towards these ends we model the C. elegans neuronal network, the connectivity of which is known. Chapter 2 constructs a full-Connectome dynamical model which can generate proxies for known behaviors (specifically demonstrating a proxy for forward motion). Chapter 3 explores the input space via interpretable bifurcation diagrams. The highly multistable dynamics give rise to long transient timescales (orders of magnitude longer than intrinsic nodal timescales). Chapter 4 models network injuries, which significantly <b>distort</b> <b>dynamics.</b> We develop a metric to quantify the injury level and help predict an injury's functional outcome. Chapter 5 uses Dynamic Mode Decomposition to relate connectivity to low-dimensional dynamical structure. In the process, we demonstrate consistency with proprioception-driven locomotion which is facilitated by network structure...|$|R

The study is driven by two main research questions: First, how does change happen within Islamist organizations? Second, what causal mechanisms underlie violent escalation and de-escalation? The project argues that Islamist groups are both principled and strategic, and that their evolution is determined by the interaction of five factors: ideology, policy convergence, government policies towards the organization, public norms of resistance and organizational <b>dynamics.</b> <b>Incentives</b> for action are derived from the founding principles of the organization, the extent to which government domestic and foreign policies are convergent with the vision and goals of the group, and the level of political inclusion and toleration by the regime.

Existing methods for constructing housing indices are computed at a coarse spatial granularity, such as metropolitan regions, which can mask or <b>distort</b> price <b>dynamics</b> apparent in local markets, such as neighborhoods and census tracts.

Our proposed Bayesian nonparametric approach builds on the framework of latent factor models to enable a flexible, data-driven method for inferring the clustering of correlated census tracts.

40|$|We provide {{evidence}} on how two important types of institutions – dismissal barriers, and bonus pay – affect contract enforcement {{behavior in a}} market with incomplete contracts and repeated interactions. Dismissal barriers are shown {{to have a strong}} negative impact on worker performance, and market efficiency, by interfering with firms' use of firing threat as an incentive device. Dismissal barriers also <b>distort</b> the <b>dynamics</b> of worker effort levels over time, cause firms to rely more on the spot market for labor, and create a distribution of relationship lengths in the market that is more extreme, with more very short and more very long relationships. The introduction of a bonus pay option dramatically changes the market outcome. Firms are observed to substitute bonus pay for threat of firing as an incentive device, almost entirely offsetting the negative incentive and efficiency effects of dismissal barriers. Nevertheless, contract enforcement behavior remains fundamentally changed, because the option to pay bonuses causes firms to rely less on long-term relationships. Our results show that market outcomes are the result of a complex interplay between contract enforcement policies and the institutions in which they are embedded. ...|$|R

40|$|A general {{framework}} for analyzing finite {{games will be}} introduced. The concept of an incentive function will be defined {{so that it is}} compatible with the updating protocol defined in Nash's proof of existence of equilibrium in all finite games. A general notion of incentive equilibrium will be defined as the fixed points of the updating protocol. It will be shown that given a continuous incentive, an incentive equilibrium will exist for any finite game. Specific examples will be given that have connections to canonical game <b>dynamics</b> and the <b>incentive</b> equilibrium are described fully. Non canonical examples will also be defined including an example based on simultaneous updating of strategies by the agents. A system of differential equations will be derived from the updating protocol, which have fixed points exactly at incentive equilibrium. It will be shown that the canonical dynamics can be achieved using the canonical incentives. Specifically the Brown-von Neumann-Nash dynamics, replicator equations, projection dynamics, logit equations, best-reply dynamics, and pairwise comparison dynamics will all be derived from their respective incentives. It will be shown that the <b>incentive</b> <b>dynamics</b> are fully general {{in the sense that it}} can be used to describe all possible game dynamics that preserve the strategy space. Incentive stable states, ISS, for general <b>incentive</b> <b>dynamics</b> will be defined as an analog to the concept of the evolutionary stable states, ESS, in the replicator dynamics. The connection between the replicator dynamics and information theory is discussed. Of particular interest is the use of the Kullback-Leibler divergence as a Lyapunov function to show that an ESS is asymptotically stable for the replicator dynamics. It will be shown that the Kullback-Liebler divergence is also a Lyapunov function for the <b>incentive</b> <b>dynamics</b> at ISS. An important example of ISS is given by realizing the uniform distribution as an interior ISS for an incentive based on simultaneous updating in a class of games that includes all variations of Rock-Paper-Scissors, RPS. The uniform distribution is the unique incentive (Nash) equilibrium for all of the canonical dynamics. However, for a specific choice of parameters in RPS if an orbit has an initial condition that is not the uniform distribution it will not converge to the unique fixed point in any of the canonical dynamics. In stark contrast, the ISS condition guarantees the uniform distribution is asymptotically stable for simultaneous updating. It will be shown that it is in fact globally asymptotically stable for the interior of the strategy space. A collection of numerical results will be given for a particular incentive. It will be shown in a number of distinct games that the incentive equilibrium is a better approximation to human behavior than the Nash equilibrium. This collection of games includes the Prisoner's Dilemma, Matching Pennies, Battle of the Sexes, the Traveler's Dilemma, Chicken, and other unnamed games of interest. Several different variations on each one of these games will be given to demonstrate the dependence on absolute differences in payoffs inherent in this model of incentive. This feature, known as cardinal dependence, is exhibited by human actors but is missing from the Nash model, which is preference, or ordinal, dependent. It will also be shown that under this incentive agents display a competitive nature as evidenced by certain games with `win-win' strategies having alternative equilibrium that are asymptotically stable. Specifically this behavior seems to appear when one agent has more opportunities to attain its maximum payoff than the other agents. This is also an observable behavior of human actors which is absent from the Nash model...|$|R

A fly is glued to a steel pin, which is held in the field between two magnets such that the fly is free to rotate about only one axis. Such "magnetically tethered" flies perform rapid yaw turns, similar to the behaviors termed "body saccades" in free flight. Saccades can be evoked by visual stimulation, in a manner suggesting that the underlying neural circuitry may be performing an angular threshold calculation. Once a saccade is initiated, however, visual feedback has very little effect on its dynamics, but rotational feedback from the haltere system {{plays an important role}} in structuring the time course of saccades. Vision is important, though, in maintaining a stable orientation in both intact flies and flies with asymmetrical wing alterations. The halteres are known to mediate responses to Coriolis forces correlated with the fly's rotations in flight, but flies with modified halteres also exhibit <b>distorted</b> saccade <b>dynamics</b> when they are not free to rotate. This suggests that the halteres may be involved in saccade initiation, although the precise mechanisms are not clear. There is preliminary evidence suggesting that the haltere strokes may be actively modulated during flight...|$|R

It focuses on extractive reserves in Brazilian Amazonia and the partnerships and interactions that have evolved between local populations and NGOs (national and international), government agencies and international donors for their creation, implementation and management. Extractive reserves are protected areas designated for the sustainable use of natural resources by the resident population. They aim to achieve multiple goals including conserving biodiversity, satisfying the basic needs of the population and strengthening social organisation as a means to guarantee their participatory management. The paper concludes that partnerships have {{played an important role in}} the formal creation of extractive reserves as a new management regime relying on collective action between individuals and organisations. However, it also argues that different actors become involved in extractive reserves as a means to achieve different goals, which are not always complementary or even compatible.

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{designing}} multi-item procurement auctions for a monopsonistic buyer in capacity-constrained environments. Using insights from classical auction theory, we construct an optimization-based auction mechanism (Üsmart marketÝ) relying on the dynamic resolution of a linear program minimizing the buyer's cost under the suppliers' capacity constraints. Suppliers can modify their offers in response to the optimal allocation corresponding to each set of bids, giving rise to a dynamic competitive bidding process. To assist suppliers, we also develop a bidding-suggestion device based on a myopic best-response (MBR) calculation that solves an associated optimization problem. Assuming linear costs for the suppliers, we study within a game-theoretic framework the sequence of bids arising in this smart market. Under a weak behavioral assumption and some symmetry requirements, an explicit upper bound for the winning bids is established. We then formulate a complete behavioral model and solution methodology based on the MBR rationale and show that the bounds derived earlier continue to hold. We analytically derive some structural and convergence properties of the MBR dynamics in the simplest nontrivial market environment, which suggests further possible design improvements, and investigate bidding <b>dynamics</b> and <b>incentive</b> compatibility issues via numerical simulations. procurement auctions, smart markets, iterative bidding mechanism, best response...|$|R
