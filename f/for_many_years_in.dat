5|$|By 1899, Waterloo had 16 {{platforms}} {{but only}} 10 numbers allocated in different {{sections of the}} station or on different levels; some numbers were duplicated. This complexity and confusion became the butt of jokes by writers and music hall comics <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>in</b> the late 19th century, including Jerome K. Jerome in Three Men in a Boat. It was criticised and satirised in several Punch cartoons.|$|E

5|$|By the 1970s, {{the idea}} that the game had been created solely by Charles Darrow had become popular folklore; it was printed in the game's {{instructions}} <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>years,</b> <b>in</b> a 1974 book devoted to Monopoly, and was cited in a general book about toys even as recently as 2007. Even a guide to family games published for Reader's Digest in 2003 only gave credit to Darrow and Elizabeth Magie, erroneously stating that Magie's original game was created in the 19th century, and not acknowledging any of the game's development between Magie's creation of the game, and the eventual publication by Parker Brothers.|$|E
5|$|Feeling unsuited to a {{managerial}} role {{in such an}} environment, he left Oak Ridge at the end {{of summer}} in 1947 and returned to Princeton University, although he maintained a consulting role with the facility <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>years.</b> <b>In</b> the postwar period he served on a number of government bodies, including the National Bureau of Standards from 1947 to 1951, the mathematics panel of the National Research Council from 1951 to 1954, the physics panel of the National Science Foundation, and the influential General Advisory Committee of the Atomic Energy Commission from 1952 to 1957 and again from 1959 to 1964. He also contributed to civil defense.|$|E
5|$|<b>For</b> <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>in</b> his {{parliamentary}} career Disraeli {{hoped to}} forge a paternalistic Tory-Radical alliance, but he was unsuccessful. Before the Reform Act 1867, the working class did not possess the vote and therefore had little political power. Although Disraeli forged a personal friendship with John Bright, a Lancashire manufacturer and leading Radical, Disraeli was unable to persuade Bright to sacrifice his distinct position for parliamentary advancement. When Disraeli attempted to secure a Tory-Radical cabinet in 1852, Bright refused.|$|E

5|$|In 1584 Báthory allowed Zamoyski {{to execute}} Samuel Zborowski, whose death {{sentence}} for treason and murder had been pending for roughly a decade. This political conflict between Báthory and the Zborowski family, framed as {{the clash between}} the monarch and the nobility, {{would be a major}} recurring controversy in internal Polish politics <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>years.</b> <b>In</b> external politics, Báthory was considering another war with Russia, but his plans were delayed to the lack of support from the Sejm, which refused to pass requested tax raises.|$|E
5|$|In 1945, Tolkien {{moved to}} Merton College, Oxford, {{becoming}} the Merton Professor of English Language and Literature, in which post he remained {{until his retirement}} in 1959.

Tolkien completed The Lord of the Rings in 1948, close to a decade after the first sketches.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not known}} for certain why the {{albatrosses}} became extinct in the North Atlantic, although rising sea levels due to an interglacial warming period {{are thought to have}} submerged the site of a short-tailed albatross colony that has been excavated in Bermuda. Some southern species have occasionally turned up as vagrants in the North Atlantic and can become exiled, remaining there for decades. One of these exiles, a black-browed albatross, returned to gannet colonies in Scotland <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>in</b> an attempt to breed.|$|E

5|$|Most {{ingested}} uranium is excreted during digestion. Only 0.5% {{is absorbed}} when insoluble forms of uranium, {{such as its}} oxide, are ingested, whereas absorption of the more soluble uranyl ion can be up to 5%. However, soluble uranium compounds tend to quickly pass through the body, whereas insoluble uranium compounds, especially when inhaled by way of dust into the lungs, pose a more serious exposure hazard. After entering the bloodstream, the absorbed uranium tends to bioaccumulate and stay <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>in</b> bone tissue because of uranium's affinity for phosphates. Uranium is not absorbed through the skin, and alpha particles released by uranium cannot penetrate the skin.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Jingeling, the Keeper of the Keys to Santa's Workshop, {{was created}} in 1956 as a radio {{spokesman}} to promote the toys sold at Halle's Department Store in Cleveland, Ohio. Mr. Jingeling was immediately popular and became an annual fixture at Halle's where he prowled the seventh floor toy department entertaining shoppers. The costumed character was first played by Max Ellis, a Cleveland Play House actor, and then by Earl W. Keyes, a television producer and director, who remained with the role <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>years.</b> <b>In</b> addition to his department store duties, Mr. Jingeling appeared on a local children's television program telling stories, singing songs, and reminding viewers to visit Halle's.|$|E
5|$|Promoted acting {{air vice marshal}} in 1946, Bladin {{was among}} the coterie of senior {{officers}} who helped reshape the post-war RAAF. His roles in the late 1940s and early 1950s included Chief of Staff of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan, Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area (later RAAF Air Command), and Air Member for Personnel. Appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1950, he retired to his country property in 1953.

5|$|Since 1957 {{there has}} been an annual {{performance}} of the York Nativity Play from the 15th century York Mystery Cycle. The play follows a script by E.

The performances are at the Church of St Mary the Virgin in early December, and the actors are local people who have appeared in the play <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>years.</b> <b>In</b> 1964, the play was recorded and broadcast by the BBC Home Service under the title of Star Over Aldermaston. One member of the production team was David Shute.|$|E
5|$|The Rokeby Venus {{may have}} been {{intended}} as a pendant to a sixteenth-century Venetian painting of a recumbent Venus (which seems to have begun life as a Danaë) in a landscape, in the same pose, but seen from the front. The two were certainly hung together <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>in</b> Spain when {{in the collection of}} Gaspar Méndez de Haro, 7th Marquis of Carpio (1629–87); at what point they were initially paired is uncertain.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} the murders and of the victims drew {{attention}} to the poor living conditions in the East End and galvanised public opinion against the overcrowded, unsanitary slums. In the two decades after the murders, the worst of the slums were cleared and demolished, but the streets and some buildings survive and the legend of the Ripper is still promoted by guided tours of the murder sites. The Ten Bells public house in Commercial Street was frequented by {{at least one of the}} victims and was the focus of such tours <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>years.</b> <b>In</b> 2015, the Jack the Ripper Museum opened in east London.|$|E
