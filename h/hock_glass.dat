6000|$|The porter led the {{way through}} a cloistered walk, until {{they arrived at the}} door of the great mansion, to which they ascended by a lofty flight of steps; it opened into a large {{octagonal}} hail, the sides of which were covered with fowling-pieces, stags' heads, couteaux de chasse, boar-spears, and huge fishing-nets. Passing through this hall, they ascended a noble stair-case, on the first landing-place of which was a door, which Vivian's conductor opened, and ushering him into a large and well-lighted chamber, withdrew. From the centre of this room descended a magnificently cut chandelier, which threw a graceful light upon a sumptuous banquet table, at which were seated eight very singular-looking personages. All of them wore hunting-dresses of various shades of straw-coloured cloth, with the exception of one, who sat on the left hand of the master of the feast, and the colour of whose costume was a rich crimson purple. From the top to the bottom of the table extended a double file of wine-glasses and goblets, of all sizes and all colours. There you might see brilliant relics of that ancient ruby-glass the vivid tints of which seem lost to us for ever. Next to these were marshalled goblets of Venetian manufacture, of a cloudy, creamy white; then came the huge <b>hock</b> <b>glass</b> of some ancient Primate of Mentz, nearly a yard high, towering above its companions, as the church, its former master, predominated over the simple laymen of the middle ages. Why should we forget a set of most curious and antique drinking-cups of painted glass, on whose rare surfaces were emblazoned the Kaiser and ten electors of the old Empire? ...|$|E
50|$|High {{quality wine}} glasses once {{were made of}} lead crystal, which has a higher index of {{refraction}} and is heavier than ordinary glass, but health concerns regarding the ingestion of lead resulted in their being replaced by lead-free crystal. Wine glasses, {{with the exception of}} the <b>hock</b> <b>glass,</b> are generally not coloured or frosted as doing so would diminish appreciation of the wine's colour.|$|E

From 1938 to 1941, he lived in Lancaster, Ohio and McArthur, Ohio, working for the Anchor <b>Hocking</b> <b>Glass</b> Corp. and the Austin Powder Co.|$|R
25|$|Glassware {{was also}} {{replenished}} at this time. Mrs. Lincoln ordered 24 plain cut goblets (probably for family dining) in November 1864 and January 1865 from the D.C. firm of Webb & Beveridge. The cost was just $30. On January 30, 1865, she also ordered glassware to replace broken and stolen glassware for public events from John Kerr's China Hall, {{at a cost}} of $612.50. This service included four dozen each of goblets, champagne glasses, claret glasses, burgundy glasses, madeira <b>glasses,</b> sherry <b>glasses,</b> <b>hock</b> <b>glasses,</b> and cordial glasses. The bases appear to have been plain (unlike the 1861 order), except for the madeira glasses—which were more richly carved and featured the rays on the foot. The <b>hock</b> <b>glasses</b> were ruby (not green) in color, and the madeira glasses may also have been red colored. She ordered another four decanters on March 25.|$|R
50|$|Born in Salisbury, Maryland, as a {{young man}} Isaac Collins moved to Lancaster, Ohio to work as a {{decorator}} at a pressed glass manufacturing company. There, he founded the <b>Hocking</b> <b>Glass</b> Company in 1905 which became the Anchor Hocking Corp. following a 1937 merger with the Anchor Cap Co.

2500|$|She {{completed}} her purchases by ordering glassware. [...] She purchased the glassware on July 3, 1861, from A. P. Zimaudy of Washington, D.C. [...] This $1,500 set of glassware was richly cut and one side inscribed with the U.S. coat of arms. The glassware was manufactured by Christian Dorflinger, a {{company based in}} Brooklyn, New York, and was much thinner and lighter than the typical White House heavy crystal which had been used since the Andrew Jackson administration. [...] Small flowers were depicted on the sides and backs of the glassware. [...] A decorative border of umbrella-like shapes was etched into the lip, and the base featured a star and fan of spreading rays. The exact content of the glassware order is not clear, but probably included four dozen complete settings (water glass, red wine glass, white wine glass, champagne flute, dessert wine glass, and all-purpose glass) {{as well as some}} serving dishes. White House glassware historian Jane Shadel Spillman believes the glassware collection was probably similar to a [...] "presentation" [...] set given to Japanese diplomats by E.V. Haughwout the year before. This presentation set included goblets, champagne glasses, wine glasses, claret <b>glasses,</b> green-tinted <b>hock</b> <b>glasses,</b> cordial glasses, quart- and pint-size decanters, claret decanters, bowls, side dishes, finger bowls, and saltcellars. The setting also probably included punch bowls, double-handled punch cups, ice cream plates, carafes, sugar bowls, and celery vases. Among the known serving dishes were a relish dish and a compote dish.|$|R

60|$|Mild fire of wine kindled his veins. I {{wanted that}} badly. Felt so off colour. His eyes unhungrily saw shelves of tins: sardines, gaudy lobsters' claws. All the odd things people pick up for food. Out of shells, {{periwinkles}} with a pin, off trees, snails {{out of the}} ground the French eat, out of the sea with bait on a hook. Silly fish learn nothing in a thousand years. If you didn't know risky putting anything into your mouth. Poisonous berries. Johnny Magories. Roundness you think good. Gaudy colour warns you off. One fellow told another and so on. Try it on the dog first. Led on by the smell or the look. Tempting fruit. Ice cones. Cream. Instinct. Orangegroves for instance. Need artificial irrigation. Bleibtreustrasse. Yes but what about oysters. Unsightly like a clot of phlegm. Filthy shells. Devil to open them too. Who found them out? Garbage, sewage they feed on. Fizz and Red bank oysters. Effect on the sexual. Aphrodis. He was in the Red Bank this morning. Was he oysters old fish at table perhaps he young flesh in bed no June has no ar no oysters. But there are people like things high. Tainted game. Jugged hare. First catch your hare. Chinese eating eggs fifty years old, blue and green again. Dinner of thirty courses. Each dish harmless might mix inside. Idea for a poison mystery. That archduke Leopold was it no yes or was it Otto one of those Habsburgs? Or who was it used to eat the scruff off his own head? Cheapest lunch in town. Of course aristocrats, then the others copy to be in the fashion. Milly too rock oil and flour. Raw pastry I like myself. Half the catch of oysters they throw back in the sea to keep up the price. Cheap no-one would buy. Caviare. Do the grand. <b>Hock</b> in green <b>glasses.</b> Swell blowout. Lady this. Powdered bosom pearls. The élite. Crème de la crème. They want special dishes to pretend they're. Hermit with a platter of pulse keep down the stings of the flesh. Know me come eat with me. Royal sturgeon high sheriff, Coffey, the butcher, right to venisons of the forest from his ex. Send him back the half of a cow. Spread I saw down in the Master of the Rolls' kitchen area. Whitehatted chef like a rabbi. Combustible duck. Curly cabbage à la duchesse de Parme. Just as well to write it on the bill of fare so you can know what you've eaten. Too many drugs spoil the broth. I know it myself. Dosing it with Edwards' desiccated soup. Geese stuffed silly for them. Lobsters boiled alive. Do ptake some ptarmigan. Wouldn't mind being a waiter in a swell hotel. Tips, evening dress, halfnaked ladies. May I tempt you to a little more filleted lemon sole, miss Dubedat? Yes, do bedad. And she did bedad. Huguenot name I expect that. A miss Dubedat lived in Killiney, I remember. Du, de la French. Still it's the same fish perhaps old Micky Hanlon of Moore street ripped the guts out of making money hand over fist finger in fishes' gills can't write his name on a cheque think he was painting the landscape with his mouth twisted.
