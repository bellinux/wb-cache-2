5|$|U-43 was due {{to depart}} Lorient on a war patrol to an area off Freetown, west Africa, but early on 4 February 1941, she sank while tied to Ysere, an old sailing ship which {{was used as a}} <b>floating</b> <b>pier.</b> Valves and vents had been tampered-with the {{previous}} day, but no one had noticed the slow, but steady ingress of water into the bilges. To make matters worse and contrary to a Befehlshaber der U-Boote (BdU—U-boat command headquarters) directive, a hatch had been left open, allowing water to pour into the after torpedo room. Two petty officers were found to be most at fault; but Lüth, as captain, was ultimately responsible. However, according to author Jordan Vause, no record of punishment seems to have survived and Lüth's career {{does not appear to have}} been affected. U-43 was refloated and Lüth took it back out into the North Atlantic in May 1941.|$|E
5|$|In Kyushu, {{the heavy}} {{rainfall}} caused flooding and landslides, which buried several houses in Miyazaki Prefecture and forced 75people to evacuate. The high wind knocked over many cypress or cedar trees, totaling 22529ha (55,670acres) and accounting for ¥64billion ($530million USD) in damage in Ōita Prefecture alone. Damage was heaviest near Nagasaki, where 16people were killed, including five after a warehouse collapsed during the storm. A construction worker in nearby Isahaya {{was killed when}} the winds struck him with a prebuilt hut, and airborne debris killed five people in Kumamoto Prefecture and seven in Fukuoka Prefecture. Throughout Kyushu, about 2million people lost power. High winds and waves in Kagoshima Prefecture overturned several cars, killing one person in Ōshima. Throughout Kyushu, about 2million people lost power. On nearby Shikoku island, high winds and rains caused ¥4.7billion ($35.7million USD) in damage in Tokushima, mostly related to fisheries, crops, and houses. A record storm surge, in conjunction with high winds, damaged a school in Sakaide, {{as well as a}} <b>floating</b> <b>pier</b> and coastal road in nearby Ehime Prefecture. Rough surf swept away a women in Matsuyama.|$|E
25|$|The first {{scheduled}} airline service to Narvik {{was carried out}} by Norwegian Air Lines in 1935. Using a Junkers W 34, they flew a coastal route between Bergen and Tromsø, which landed in Narvik. The route continued until 1939 when it was terminated because of the break-out of World War II. The route resumed in 1946, when it was flown with a Junkers Ju 52. The water aerodrome consisted of a <b>floating</b> <b>pier</b> in the port. Widerøe started flying to Narvik in 1951, at first flying via Svolvær to Bodø. DNL's successor Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) terminated its seaplane routes the following year, leaving them to Widerøe, who operated the Noorduyn Norseman and de Havilland Canada Otter.|$|E
50|$|In June {{and early}} July, 2016, Monte Isola {{was the site}} of The <b>Floating</b> <b>Piers</b> by artists Christo and Jeanne-Claude.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Floating</b> <b>Piers,</b> an art {{installation}} by Christo and Jeanne-Claude, {{was open}} to the public at Lake Iseo for 16 days in June and July 2016.|$|R
50|$|Christo and Jeanne-Claude began conceptualizing of The <b>Floating</b> <b>Piers</b> in 1970. Their initial {{site was}} Rio de la Plata between Argentina and Uruguay. The couple also {{considered}} Tokyo Bay as a location {{before moving on}} to other projects.|$|R
2500|$|The ice piers {{deployed}} at McMurdo Station {{have grown}} in sophistication and size since the ice fender prototype. A contemporary pier is approximately 800feet (244 m) long by 300feet (90 m) wide and 22feet (6.7 m) thick. Fleet operations personnel make the <b>floating</b> <b>pier</b> during the winter. They build upon naturally occurring frozen seawater in McMurdo Sound after the pack ice reaches approximately 0.6m (2ft) in thickness.|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} the boat had glided by the island, and the tower was out of view; and very soon {{afterwards}} Mr. George and Rollo were landed on the <b>floating</b> <b>pier,</b> as I have already said. There were very few people to land, and the boat seemed merely to touch the pier and then to glide away again.|$|E
60|$|Mr. George and Rollo concluded, after {{ascending}} {{again to}} the light of day, that they would go home by water; so they {{went out to the}} end of a long <b>floating</b> <b>pier,</b> which was built, as it happened, exactly opposite the entrance to the Tunnel. They sat down on a bench by a little toll house there, to wait for a steamer going up the river.|$|E
2500|$|After the war {{commercial}} fishing increased in Victoria. To accommodate the increase a $100,000 Fisherman's Wharf was built near Erie Street, opening 31 March 1948. The [...] wharf could moor 60 fish packing ships along six finger <b>float</b> <b>piers.</b>|$|R
50|$|In late 2013, Christo {{settled on}} Lake Iseo as the {{location}} for The <b>Floating</b> <b>Piers</b> and dedicated the next 22 months to realizing the project. It {{was the first}} major project he undertook {{after the death of his}} partner and collaborator Jeanne-Claude.|$|R
5000|$|In the mid-90’s, Lakewood made {{considerable}} {{improvements to}} the shed and piers and completely rebuilt C shed and replaced D with a new, concrete floating pier.Three new <b>floating</b> <b>piers</b> were approved for the West Harbor in 1999 and installed in early 2000.|$|R
60|$|Bingen {{is one of}} {{the towns}} where there is a <b>floating</b> <b>pier</b> of this kind, and Mr. George and Rollo were safely landed upon it about eight o'clock. It was a very {{pleasant}} evening. As they approached the town, before they landed, they both walked forward towards the bows of the vessel, to see what sort of a place it was where they were going to spend the night.|$|E
60|$|Having thus {{concluded}} his address, the amiable cherub embraced his daughter, {{and took}} his flight to the steamboat which was to convey him to London, and was then lying at the <b>floating</b> <b>pier,</b> doing its best to bump the same to bits. But, the happy couple {{were not going to}} part with him in that way, and before he had been on board two minutes, there they were, looking down at him from the wharf above.|$|E
60|$|The {{elephants}} had {{not been}} trained {{to take to the}} water, and the operation was an extremely difficult one. Very strong and massive rafts were joined together until they extended two hundred feet into the river, being kept in their place by cables fastened to trees on the bank above them. At the end of this <b>floating</b> <b>pier</b> was placed another raft of immense size, capable of carrying four elephants at a time. A thick covering of earth was laid over the whole, and on this turf was placed. The elephants were then led forward.|$|E
50|$|In June 2016, he {{stirred up}} {{controversy}} in Italy while visiting The <b>Floating</b> <b>Piers</b> on Lake Iseo. Dafoe was photographed {{on that very}} section while {{thousands of people were}} denied access. The local press suggested the closure might have been orchestrated to allow Dafoe to enjoy the installation without the crowds.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>Floating</b> <b>Piers</b> were {{a series}} of {{walkways}} installed at Lake Iseo near Brescia, Italy. From June 18 to July 3, 2016, visitors were able to walk just above {{the surface of the}} water from the village of Sulzano on the mainland to the islands of Monte Isola and San Paolo. The floating walkways were made of around 200,000 polyethylene cubes covered with [...] of bright yellow fabric: [...] of piers moved on the water; another [...] of golden fabric continued along the pedestrian streets in Sulzano and Peschiera Maraglio. After the exhibition, all components were to be removed and recycled. The installation was facilitated by the Beretta family, owners of the primary side arm supplier of the American Army. The Beretta family owns the island of San Paolo, which was surrounded by <b>Floating</b> <b>Piers</b> walkways.|$|R
50|$|Floats {{make up the}} {{multipart}} hulls of catamarans and trimarans {{and provide}} buoyancy for floatplanes and seaplanes. They are used in pontoon bridges, <b>floating</b> <b>piers,</b> and <b>floats</b> anchored to the seabed for recreation or dockage. They are also used in shipbuilding and marine salvage, often deployed uninflated then pressurized to raise a sunken object.|$|R
50|$|Thunderbolt Pier, a pier {{named after}} HMS Thunderbolt, built 1856, {{which was used}} as a <b>floating</b> <b>pier</b> from 1873 until 1948, when she was rammed and sunk.|$|E
5000|$|Crews from USCGC Tahoma and USCGC Mohawk {{are helping}} to rebuild the base. After the quake, a field {{hospital}} was set up at the base to treat victims of the quake. On the 18th, [...] anchored at the base, and started relief operations. The crew of Gunston Hall made the heliport operational again. As of 9 February 2010, the south pier was mostly operational again. A <b>floating</b> <b>pier</b> had been set up, which has cranes. A second <b>floating</b> <b>pier</b> is on its way. The harbour is being used as an entry port for aid to Haiti.|$|E
5000|$|Floats (also called pontoons) are {{airtight}} hollow structures, {{similar to}} pressure vessels, {{designed to provide}} buoyancy in water. Their principal applications are in watercraft hulls and aircraft floats, <b>floating</b> <b>pier</b> and pontoon bridge construction, and marine engineering applications such as salvage.|$|E
50|$|In February 2016, {{the gallery}} {{exhibited}} CHRISTO & Jeanne-Claude - Works in Progress. Known mainly for their large-scale outdoor installations, the works {{shown in the}} gallery were part of projects including The Mastaba (Abu Dhabi), Over the River (Colorado), and <b>Floating</b> <b>Piers</b> (Lake Iseo in Northern Italy) — represented through sketches, drawings and photo collages.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Floating</b> <b>Piers</b> was a {{site-specific}} {{work of art}} by Christo and Jeanne-Claude, {{consisting of}} 70,000 square meters of yellow fabric, carried by a modular floating dock system of 226,000 high-density polyethylene cubes installed at Lake Iseo near Brescia, Italy. The fabric created a walkable surface between Sulzano, to Monte Isola and to the island of San Paolo.|$|R
5000|$|Lakewood Yacht Club is a yacht club {{located in}} Seabrook, Texas. The club sits on 38 acres with four sheds and seven docks. There are nearly 100 covered slips for power boats {{ranging in size}} from 44’ to 100’. There are also over 200 open slips on fixed and <b>floating</b> <b>piers</b> {{ranging in size from}} 40’ to 100’.|$|R
50|$|From December 2010 to April 2013, a town harbour {{was built}} in Senftenberg. It was opened on 23 April 2013. It created a marina with over 100 boat moorings, an 80 metre-long <b>floating</b> <b>pier</b> and a harbour building. The {{construction}} costs amounted to €13 million.|$|E
50|$|The United States {{transferred}} {{the ship to}} South Korea in 1969, and the Republic of Korea Navy cannibalized her for spare parts for its other Tacoma-class patrol frigates. In April 1969, the ship was converted to a <b>floating</b> <b>pier.</b> Her final disposition is unknown.|$|E
50|$|A {{floating}} dock, <b>floating</b> <b>pier</b> or floating jetty is {{a platform}} or ramp supported by pontoons. It is usually joined {{to the shore}} with a gangway. The pier is usually {{held in place by}} vertical poles referred to as pilings, which are embedded in the seafloor or by anchored cables.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an investigation into the impact of ship berthing upon <b>floating</b> <b>piers</b> using highly advanced numerical software Abaqus. The ship and <b>floating</b> <b>piers</b> were modeled as solid bodies. For the first time, the effect of soil on the total energy absorption of the system was considered using both elastic and elastic-perfectly plastic soil models. First the results for the elastic soil model were compared to and verified by the existing literature using a spring soil model. Then a continuum soil model was utilized instead of a spring soil model, with the results showing 27 % higher energy absorption compared to the spring model. The investigation also considered a model with soil as an elastic-perfectly plastic material, being more aligned with the soil material’s real behavior. With this model the results produced 1 % more energy absorption as the soil did not reach plastic failure...|$|R
50|$|The Dolphin Reef {{opened its}} doors in 1990. The site is home to Black Sea {{bottlenose}} dolphins that are not trained to perform {{and there are no}} dolphin shows, but they are able to interact freely with human visitors. The dolphins, known for their curiosity and friendliness, approach the observation posts and <b>floating</b> <b>piers,</b> and swim alongside the people who snorkel and dive there.|$|R
5000|$|... "They must float up {{and down}} with the tide," [...] Churchill noted. [...] "The anchor problem must be mastered. Let me have the best {{solution}} worked out. Don’t argue the matter. The difficulties will argue for themselves." [...] These injunctions set down the essentials of the <b>floating</b> <b>piers</b> to enable the vast tonnage of vehicles and stores to be got ashore to support the forces in the field.|$|R
5000|$|... was an iron screw {{floating}} battery launched in 1856 and {{converted to a}} <b>floating</b> <b>pier</b> at Chatham in 1873. Between 1916 and 1919 it was named HMS Daedalus as a nominal depot ship for the Royal Navy Air Service. It sank in 1948 due to a collision with a tug, and was raised and broken up the following year.|$|E
5000|$|Engineers {{used the}} {{formidable}} strength of pack ice when they constructed Antarctica's first floating ice pier in 1973. Such ice piers are used during cargo operations to load and offload ships. Fleet operations personnel make the <b>floating</b> <b>pier</b> during the winter. They build upon naturally occurring frozen seawater in McMurdo Sound until the dock reaches {{a depth of}} about 22 ft. Ice piers have a lifespan of three to five years.|$|E
50|$|Designs {{for this}} part of the {{greenway}} were revealed in November 2013. The new design, which incorporates an amphitheater and a <b>floating</b> <b>pier,</b> is proposed to open in three phases, the first being in 2015 and the last by 2024. The three parts are between 38th, 41st, 53rd, and 60th Streets, with three gathering nodes along the way. In April 2017, the city committed $100 million in funding toward building {{this part of}} the greenway.|$|E
5000|$|The Tartus {{facility}} {{can accommodate}} four medium-sized vessels only if both of its 100 m <b>floating</b> <b>piers,</b> {{inside of the}} northern breakwater, are operational. It is not capable of hosting any of the Russian Navy's current major warships which range in length from the 129 m s through the 163 m s, much less cruisers such as the 186.4 m [...] and the 252 m , or the 305 m [...] and the 156 m [...]|$|R
50|$|In 1991, the Soviet Union {{collapsed}} and its Mediterranean fleet, the 5th Operational Squadron composed of ships from the Northern Fleet and the Black Sea Fleet, ceased to exist. Since then, {{there have been}} occasional deployments by Russian Navy ships and submarines to the Mediterranean Sea. The naval logistics support facility in Syria {{is now part of}} the Black Sea Fleet. It consists of two <b>floating</b> <b>piers,</b> a <b>floating</b> workshop, storage facilities, barracks and other facilities.|$|R
40|$|Very large {{floating}} structures (VLFS) {{have attracted}} the attention of architects, city planners, and engineers because they provide an exciting and environmentally friendly solution for land creation from the sea as opposed to the traditional land reclamation method. The applications of VLFS as <b>floating</b> <b>piers,</b> <b>floating</b> hotels, floating fuel storage facilities, floating stadia, floating bridges, floating airports, and even floating cities have triggered extensive research studies in the past two decades. The VLFS technology has developed considerably and there are many innovative methods proposed to minimize the hydroelastic motion, improve the mooring system and structural integrity of the VLFS. This keynote paper summarizes the applications, research and development of VLFS over the past two decades...|$|R
