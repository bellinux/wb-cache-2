Women, at times, can be more autonomous than those in the general population in Mexico. Fortuny says that the <b>growing</b> <b>trend</b> of educated women having husbands in supporting roles is also seen within the Church both in the Guadalajara (Mexico), and Houston (Texas) congregations. Many young female members said they want to undergo post-secondary education, and some told Fortuny they were degree students. Both young men and women are equally encouraged to enter post-compulsory education. Fathers who are members of La Luz del Mundo are more likely than their mothers to direct their daughters towards attending university.|$|E

The soundtrack to the film, , was released in February 2003.|$|E
5|$|If a reborn {{is created}} from a kit {{as opposed to}} whole {{manufactured}} doll, it may be called newborning. Manufacturers have reacted to the <b>growing</b> <b>trend</b> of artists transforming dolls by hiring reborn artists to become doll sculptors and design doll molds and kits. When newborning from a kit, the first several steps of the process are completed by reborn sculpt artists and doll manufacturers. The kits come with an already disassembled baby and select supplies. Other supplies not provided in the kit can be purchased separately. The Secrist doll company started making Reborn Doll Kits in 2005. In 2009, they began producing supplies, tools, and tutorial videos specifically for reborning or newborning. JC Toys began selling kits in December 2007 Other suppliers offer product lines that give reborners a choice of body parts and skin tones to make a customized doll.|$|E
