5|$|Beginning as a supporter, Greeley {{soon became}} disillusioned with President Johnson, whose Reconstruction {{policies}} allowed the quick formation of state governments without provision for suffrage for the freedman. When Congress convened and gradually {{took control of}} Reconstruction, Greeley generally supported their actions, favoring universal male suffrage and, his anger against the Confederates having cooled, amnesty. While Greeley generally supported the Radical Republicans, {{he did not like}} the harshness of Thaddeus Stevens. Greeley ran for Congress in 1866, but lost badly, and <b>for</b> <b>Senate</b> in the legislative election held in early 1867, to be defeated by Roscoe Conkling.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, Specter {{became the}} Republican nominee <b>for</b> <b>Senate</b> when Republican {{incumbent}} Richard Schweiker announced his retirement.

5|$|McKinley campaigned widely for Republicans in the 1894 midterm congressional elections; many party {{candidates}} in districts where he spoke were successful. His political efforts in Ohio were rewarded {{with the election}} in November 1895 of a Republican successor as governor, Asa Bushnell, and a Republican legislature that elected Foraker to the Senate. McKinley supported Foraker <b>for</b> <b>Senate</b> and Bushnell (who was of Foraker's faction) for governor; in return, the new senator-elect agreed to back McKinley's presidential ambitions. With party peace in Ohio assured, McKinley turned to the national arena.|$|E
5|$|Republicans in Congress {{claimed a}} mandate for abolition, having gained in the {{elections}} <b>for</b> <b>Senate</b> and House. The 1864 Democratic vice-presidential nominee, Representative George H. Pendleton, led opposition to the measure. Republicans toned down their language of radical equality in order to broaden the amendment's coalition of supporters. In order to reassure critics worried that the amendment would tear apart the social fabric, some Republicans explicitly promised that the amendment would leave patriarchy intact.|$|E
5|$|Borah {{considered}} challenging Hoover for renomination in 1932, but {{concluded the}} president's {{control over the}} party machinery, especially in the South, could not be overcome. Borah disagreed with the platform of the 1932 Republican National Convention over Prohibition; after the party passed a vague compromise plank and renominated Hoover, Borah made a major address on June 30, gaining nationwide attention by attacking his party's platform for forty minutes. Between then and November, he rarely mentioned Hoover's name publicly, though he said late in the campaign that he would vote for the president. He made speeches discussing issues, not candidates, and did nothing to aid Hoover's doomed campaign against Franklin D. Roosevelt. When some Idahoans demanded that he support Hoover on pain of being opposed for renomination <b>for</b> <b>Senate</b> in 1936, Borah responded that he regretted if his quarter century in the Senate had left them with the impression he might be moved by such an ultimatum.|$|E

5|$|By the 1890s, {{support for}} the {{introduction}} of direct election for the Senate had substantially increased, and reformers worked on two fronts. On the first front, the Populist Party incorporated the direct election of senators into its Omaha Platform, adopted in 1892. In 1908, Oregon passed the first law that based the selection of U.S. senators on a popular vote. Oregon was soon followed by Nebraska. Proponents for popular election noted that ten states already had non-binding primaries <b>for</b> <b>Senate</b> candidates, in which the candidates would be voted on by the public, effectively serving as advisory referenda instructing state legislatures how to vote; reformers campaigned for more states to introduce a similar method.|$|E
5|$|Daniels had {{his first}} {{experience}} in politics while still a teenager when, in 1968, {{he worked on the}} unsuccessful campaign of fellow Hoosier and Princeton alumnus William Ruckelshaus, who was running for the U.S. Senate against incumbent Democrat Birch Bayh. After the campaign Ruckelshaus helped Daniels secure an internship in the office of then-Indianapolis mayor Richard Lugar. Daniels worked on Lugar's re-election campaign in 1971, and later, in 1974, he worked on Lugar's first campaign <b>for</b> <b>Senate</b> via L. Keith Bulen's Campaign Communicators, Inc, a political consultancy where Daniels served as vice president. Daniels joined Lugar's mayoral staff in December, 1974. Within three years, he became Lugar's principal assistant. After Lugar was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1976, Daniels followed him to Washington, D.C. as his Chief of Staff.|$|E
5|$|Harrison lost a bid <b>for</b> <b>Senate</b> in 1831, {{and found}} {{insufficient}} support {{to mount a}} run for the House of Representatives in 1832. His large family gave him money problems, and he remained out of public life in the early 1830s. By 1834, opposition to President Jackson was coalescing into {{what became known as the}} Whig Party. Harrison, though several years out of active politics was a war hero with roots in both North and South, and had been fired by Jackson. Thus, he looked attractive as a possible presidential candidate to the new party, something that Harrison did nothing to discourage. Harrison wrote a letter to the newspapers that won over many Whigs, assuring them of his fidelity to party principles, such as the limited power of the executive and federal subsidies for roads, canals and railroads.|$|E

5|$|In November 2004, Clinton {{announced}} that she would seek a second Senate term. Clinton easily won the Democratic nomination over opposition from antiwar activist Jonathan Tasini. The early frontrunner for the Republican nomination, Westchester County District Attorney Jeanine Pirro, withdrew from the contest after several months of poor campaign performance. Clinton's eventual opponent {{in the general election}} was Republican candidate John Spencer, a former mayor of Yonkers. Clinton won the election on November 7, 2006, with 67percent of the vote to Spencer's 31percent, carrying all but four of New York's sixty-two counties. Her campaign spent $36 million for her re-election, more than any other candidate <b>for</b> <b>Senate</b> in the 2006 elections. Some Democrats criticized her for spending too much in a one-sided contest, while some supporters were concerned she did not leave more funds for a potential presidential bid in 2008. In the following months, she transferred $10 million of her Senate funds toward her presidential campaign.|$|E
5|$|In giving {{attention}} to national affairs, McKinley neglected his home front in Ohio, {{and when the}} Republican state convention met in Zanesville in May 1895, {{it proved to be}} controlled by the resurgent Foraker, who sought the Senate seat to be filled by the Ohio General Assembly in January 1896. That convention endorsed McKinley for president and Foraker <b>for</b> <b>Senate,</b> and nominated Foraker supporters for state and party offices, including Asa Bushnell to succeed McKinley as governor. McKinley realized that it would be risky to have a faction hostile to the presidential candidate within his home state, and sought an alliance, campaigning for Bushnell and for a Republican legislature that would send Foraker to Washington. The voters chose Bushnell and gave the state Republicans a large majority in the legislature. In January 1896, Foraker was overwhelmingly elected (to take office in March 1897), and McKinley gained Foraker's agreement to support him for president, assuring party political peace at home.|$|E
5|$|Members of the Maryland Senate {{are elected}} every four years, in off-year {{elections}} {{in the middle of}} terms for Presidents of the United States. Party nominations are determined by primary elections. The general election <b>for</b> <b>Senate</b> seats and all other state and federal {{elections in the}} normal cycle is held on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Should a Senate seat become vacant {{in the middle of a}} term, because of death, illness, incapacitation, disqualification, resignation, or expulsion of a member of the Senate, that seat is filled by appointment. The Central Committee of the previous Senator's party in the county or counties in which the Senate district lies makes a recommendation to the Governor on whom to appoint to the seat. Within fifteen days of the Central Committee's recommendation being selected, the Governor must appoint that person to the vacant seat.|$|E

He said he aims to create a “strong middle class” by promoting higher education and lowering income tax rates. He was also endorsed by Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte, who won the presidential election. Romulo, however, didn't win the race and was ranked 22nd on the tally. His sister, Mons, who ran in Pasig City's lone district and lost to Richard Eusebio, said in her Instagram post that their family will remain a helping hand in Pasig and the country despite losing the elections.|$|E
5|$|The {{increased}} speculation led some, like former {{spokesman for}} Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign Phil Singer, to criticize Matthews for openly weighing {{a political campaign}} bid {{while working as a}} news broadcaster. Singer believed Matthews should resign or be suspended from the network until a decision was made. Speculation grew as Matthews spent much of 2008 attending meetings with Pennsylvania representatives and major Democratic fundraisers. Matthews discussed a possible campaign with Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell, and poll numbers for a theoretical race showed him only three percentage points behind Specter. However, the speculation came to an end on January 7, 2009, when Matthews told his Hardball staff {{he was not going to}} run <b>for</b> <b>Senate.</b> Such media outlets as The New York Times and The Washington Post suggested Matthews' alleged consideration was a tactic to ensure a higher salary during negotiations with MSNBC to renew his contract, which was set to expire in June 2009.|$|E
