5|$|According to the French Byzantinist Henri Grégoire, the Byzantine success {{against the}} Arabs that culminated with the Battle of Lalakaon {{inspired}} {{the creation of}} one of the oldest surviving acritic (heroic) poems: the Song of Armouris. Grégoire claimed that the eponymous protagonist, the young Byzantine warrior Armouris, was actually inspired by Emperor Michael III. A battle from the Byzantine heroic cycle around Digenis Akritas also strongly recalls the events of Lalakaon, as the eponymous hero surrounds an Arab army near Malakopeia. Strong influences can be found in episodes in the Arab, and later Turkish, epic cycles around Battal Ghazi, as well as an <b>episode</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> One Thousand and One Nights.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This was an {{investigation}} of whether treatment with fluoxetine is useful for individuals with bulimia nervosa who {{do not respond to}} psychotherapy or relapse afterward.
