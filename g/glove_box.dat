5|$|Polonium and its {{compounds}} must {{be handled}} in a <b>glove</b> <b>box,</b> which is further enclosed in another box, maintained at a slightly higher pressure than the <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> to prevent the radioactive materials from leaking out. Gloves made of natural rubber do not provide sufficient protection against the radiation from polonium; surgical gloves are necessary. Neoprene gloves shield radiation from polonium better than natural rubber.|$|E
5|$|Another {{major fire}} {{occurred}} on May 11, 1969 in building 776/777 (the Plutonium Processing Facility), again starting due to spontaneous combustion of plutonium shavings in a <b>glove</b> <b>box.</b> Fire fighters again resorted to fighting {{the fire with}} water after dry extinguishers proved ineffective. Despite recommendations after the 1957 fire, suppression systems were not built into the glove boxes.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of September 11, 1957, {{plutonium}} shavings in a <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> located in building 771 (the Plutonium Recovery and Fabrication Facility) spontaneously ignited. The fire spread to the flammable <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> materials, including plexiglas windows and rubber gloves. The fire rapidly spread through the interconnected glove boxes and ignited the large bank of High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters located in a plenum downstream. Within minutes the first filters had burned out, allowing plutonium particles {{to escape from the}} building exhaust stacks. The building exhaust fans stopped operating due to fire damage at 10:40 PM, which ended the majority of the plutonium release. Fire fighters initially used carbon dioxide fire extinguishers because water can act as a moderator and cause plutonium to go critical. They resorted to water hoses when the dry fire extinguishers proved ineffective.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} about the effects of {{berkelium}} on human body, and analogies with other elements may not be drawn because of different radiation products (electrons for berkelium and alpha particles, neutrons, or both for most other actinides). The low energy of electrons emitted from berkelium-249 (less than 126keV) hinders its detection, due to signal interference with other decay processes, but also makes this isotope relatively harmless to humans as compared to other actinides. However, berkelium-249 transforms with a half-life of only 330 days to the strong alpha-emitter californium-249, which is rather dangerous and has to be handled in a <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> in a dedicated laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Slide {{attempts}} to betray the team by reaching the safe first, having tricked Odessa into giving him lessons. The team intercepts him at Shaw's apartment, {{and during the}} ensuing altercation, they break down a false wall, revealing Shaw's safe, {{which turns out to}} be empty. Slide and Fitzhugh fight over Slide's gun; the gun goes off and the bullet hits the car, revealing gold underneath the Ferrari's paint. They realize that Shaw used his money to buy gold, turn it into car parts, and assembled the car to hide the money in plain sight. Josh then finds a ledger of Shaw's illegal finances in the car's <b>glove</b> <b>box.</b>|$|E
25|$|All {{polonium}} compounds, such as polonium dioxide, {{are extremely}} radioactive and thus must be handled in a <b>glove</b> <b>box.</b> The <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> must further be enclosed in another box {{similar to the}} <b>glove</b> <b>box,</b> maintained at a slightly lower pressure than the <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> to prevent the radioactive materials from leaking out.

25|$|In 1966, {{possibly}} in a belated {{bid for the}} mass market, a stripped down basic version, the Panhard 24 BA was offered.

25|$|The {{body was}} {{an entirely new}} design by Pininfarina {{featuring}} panels made of Kevlar, carbon fiber, and aluminum for strength and low weight, and intense aerodynamic testing was employed. Weight was further minimized {{through the use of}} a plastic windshield and windows. The cars did have air conditioning, but had no sound system, door handles, <b>glove</b> <b>box,</b> leather trim, carpets, or door panels. The first 50 cars produced had sliding Lexan windows, while later cars were fitted with wind down windows.|$|E
25|$|The ideal {{conditions}} for imine hydrogenation {{depend on the}} nature of the substrate and catalyst system. Generally, higher pressures of hydrogen gas are needed in order to achieve reasonable reaction times; however, hydrogen pressure does not appreciably affect enantioselectivity. If the active catalyst is generated in situ, Schlenck techniques or a <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> should be employed. Parr shakers may be used for reaction pressures up to 4 bar, although precise temperature control is difficult to achieve in the reaction vessel. For higher hydrogen pressures, specialized autoclave equipment is required.|$|E
