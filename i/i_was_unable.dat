5|$|Architecturally {{this was}} an {{exciting}} period, but Honoré <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>unable</b> to remodel the fortress in the grand style of a Renaissance palazzo. In spite of the Spanish protection, the risk of attack from France was high and defence remained Honoré's main priority. With this in mind he added two new features: All Saints Tower (F) and the Serravalle Bastion (G). All Saints Tower was semi-circular and guarded {{the end of the}} rock promontory. Complete with gun platforms and cannon, it was connected to man-made caves in the rock itself. Subterranean passages also linked it to the Serravalle Bastion, which was in essence a three-storey gun tower bristling with cannon. Underneath the courtyard a cistern was installed, providing sufficient water for 1000 troops for a 20-month siege, with a huge vaulted ceiling supported by nine columns. Monaco was to remain politically vulnerable for another century and little building work took place from 1581 until 1604, during the reigns of Prince Charles II and Prince Hercule.|$|E

The loss of Manchuria, and its vast potential for industrial development and war industries, was a blow to the Kuomintang economy.

Hungry for raw {{materials}} and pressed by a growing population, Japan initiated the seizure of Manchuria in September 1931 and established ex-Qing emperor Puyi {{as head of the}} puppet state of Manchukuo in 1932.

The League of Nations, established at the end of World War <b>I,</b> <b>was</b> <b>unable</b> to act {{in the face of the}} Japanese defiance. After 1940, conflicts between the Kuomintang and Communists became more frequent in the areas not under Japanese control. The Communists expanded their influence wherever opportunities presented themselves through mass organizations, administrative reforms, and the land- and tax-reform measures favoring the peasants—while the Kuomintang attempted to neutralize the spread of Communist influence.|$|E
25|$|This was {{beneficial}} for the Crusaders as {{it meant that}} they did not have to garrison captured towns and lose troop strength whilst maintaining their supply lines. The Byzantines, in return, would supply the Crusaders with food in a hostile territory and Alexius' troops would act as a reserve to reinforce them in any dangerous situations. The Crusaders first set about attacking Nicaea on 6 May 1097. Kilij Arslan <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>unable</b> to assist the Turks there due to the immense size of the Crusader armies; another small defeat on 16 May convinced Kilij Arslan to withdraw and abandon the city, which surrendered to the Byzantines on 19 June. After this, a decisive victory at Dorylaeum gave the Crusaders an Asia Minor that was open to attack: Sozopolis, Philomelium, Iconium, Antioch in Pisidia, Heraclea and Caesarea all fell to the Crusaders and they reached as far as Cilicia where they allied with Cilician Armenia.|$|E
500|$|Bax {{was born}} in the London suburb of Streatham, Surrey, to a prosperous Victorian family. He was the eldest son of Alfred Ridley Bax (1844–1918) and his wife, Charlotte Ellen, née Lea (1860–1940). The couple's {{youngest}} son, Clifford Lea Bax, became a playwright and essayist. Alfred Bax was a barrister of the Middle Temple, but having a private income he did not practise. In 1896 the family moved to a mansion in Hampstead. Bax later wrote that although it would have been good to be raised in the country, the large gardens of the family house were the next best thing. He was a musical child: [...] "I cannot remember the long-lost day when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>unable</b> to play the piano – inaccurately".|$|E

500|$|Lisa Mahapatra from The New Indian Express was {{impressed}} with the story and Tripathi's writing and praised [...] "the interactions between Shiva and Sati, [...] intriguing. Age-old thoughts and philosophies were delivered in a very modern context, which I thought made for an interesting juxtaposition." [...] Mahapatra added that [...] "the only downside throughout the novel, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>unable</b> to really get into the main characters—they remained mostly on a two-dimensional level." [...] It received a mixed review from Hindustan Times, where the reviewer was critical of Tripathi's usage of common, everyday language. [...] "There are many other subtle depictions of Lord Ram and other characters and overall its very well written. I wrote to Amish to express one small observation, the script writing is not that sharp. You have words like 'Goddamnit', 'bloody hell', 'In the name of God what is this nonsense?' etc, which I guess would be great for an Indian audience but after you just finish a Steven Erikson novel you find it falling a little flat," [...] the reviewer concluded.|$|E
500|$|Hollis was {{involved}} with Perfect Dark for the first 14 months of its three-year development cycle, during which progress was troubled and long delayed. He explained, [...] "each of us was asking for {{more than the other}} could give. This situation ended with my departure, and with very deep regret <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>unable</b> to see Perfect Dark to completion". By the end of 1998, half of the team members, including Doak and Ellis, also left Rare to form Free Radical Design. What followed by those remaining on the project was a comprehensive re-design of the game, with the story and characters being the main items kept intact. Game designer Mark Edmonds was promoted to team leader because he was familiar with most of the game engine at the time. Rare also assigned more people to the development team, which eventually became three times bigger than GoldenEye 007s. The new team was [...] "uniquely shielded from the outside world" [...] and did not have a production manager, a schedule, meetings, or any sort of deadlines. According to artist B Jones, [...] "People would just do things they thought were cool and would work".|$|E
500|$|Minogue's third album, Rhythm of Love was {{released}} in November 1990 and was described as [...] "leaps and bounds more mature" [...] than her previous albums. Her relationship with Michael Hutchence was also {{seen as part of}} her departure from her earlier persona. She then embarked on the Rhythm of Love Tour in February 1991. Minogue's fourth album, Let's Get to It {{was released}} in October 1991 and reached number 15 on the UK Albums Chart. It was her first album to fail to reach the top ten. While the first single from the album, [...] "Word Is Out", became her first single to miss the top ten of the UK Singles Chart, subsequent singles [...] "If You Were with Me Now" [...] and [...] "Give Me Just a Little More Time" [...] both reached the top five. In support of the album, she embarked on the Let's Get to It Tour in October. She later expressed her opinion that she was stifled by Stock, Aitken and Waterman, saying, [...] "I was very much a puppet in the beginning. I was blinkered by my record company. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>unable</b> to look left or right." [...] Her first Greatest Hits album {{was released in}} August 1992. It reached number one in the United Kingdom and number three in Australia. The singles from the album, [...] "What Kind of Fool" [...] and her cover version of Kool & the Gang's [...] "Celebration" [...] both reached the top twenty of the UK Singles Chart.|$|E

I thought that wisdom's only function was to purge the out-wanderings of the heart and return it to a state of stillness." ...|$|E

[...] Sweeney settled into the role quite quickly, attending the Royals' spring training in Surprise, Arizona as a guest instructor that same month.
