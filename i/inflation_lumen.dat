50|$|In 2002, Goldman {{launched}} the company, Vascular Designs, where he developed an innovative medical device, the IsoFlow infusion catheter. An important application for the IsoFlow catheter {{may be in}} the treatment of cancer. Goldman invented the device in an attempt to save his own sister, Amy Cohen, from colon cancer. The IsoFlow is a dual balloon catheter designed to isolate a specific treatment region within the body from blood flow. It allows the infusion of fluids into the region and the perfusion of blood past the region to keep the blood flow intact during treatment. One of the many unique features of the IsoFlow infusion catheter is the ability to deliver medications sideways while using pressure to push the medications into the targeted area. The IsoFlow catheter is inserted over a guide wire for precise positioning within a patient’s body. Once in place, medication is infused and isolated when both of the catheter’s balloons are simultaneously inflated using fluid via a single <b>inflation</b> <b>lumen.</b>|$|E
40|$|There {{are over}} 30 million Foley urinary {{catheters}} used annually, {{and the greatest}} problem with Foley catheters is catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs). CAUTIs are the number one cause of hospital-acquired infections and make up to 40 % of nosocomial infections. Biofilms on urinary catheters are critical to the progression of symptomatic CAUTIs, but are difficult to treat due to the protective effect of the biofilm matrix against antibiotics. The anti-fouling catheter technology proposed and demonstrated herein uses a mechanical, non-antibiotic approach to physically remove biofilms and thereby provide an appealing option for potentially stopping the progression of symptomatic infections. Additionally, because the anti-fouling technology is mechanical, it can circumvent the persistent failings of chemical and biological approaches that have failed to address catheter-associated urinary tract infections for the last 50 + years since Foley catheters were introduced. We designed and optimized urinary catheter prototypes capable of on-demand removal of biofilms from the previously-inaccessible main drainage lumen of catheters. The concept uses pressure-actuated chambers in elastomer constructs to generate regio-selective strain and thereby remove biofilms. We first grew mature Proteus mirabilis crystalline biofilms on flat silicone elastomer substrates, and showed that application of strain to the substrate debonded the biofilm, and that increasing the strain rate increased biofilm detachment. A quantitative relationship between the applied strain rate and biofilm debonding was found through {{an analysis of the}} biofilm segment length and the calculated driving force for debonding. We then constructed proof-of-concept prototypes of sections of anti-fouling catheter shafts using silicone and 3 D printed reverse molding in methods akin to those used for soft robotics. The proof-of-concept prototypes demonstrated release of mature P. mirabilis crystalline biofilms from their strained surfaces, and prompted our development of more advanced multi-lumen prototypes. The multi-lumen prototypes were designed and optimized using successive rounds of finite element modeling to adjust the number and postion of intra-wall <b>inflation</b> <b>lumens.</b> We then constructed prototypes based on the optimized design with clinically relevant dimensions and showed they were able to generate greater than 30 % strain on the majority of the luminal surface, and along their full length. Those catheter prototypes were able to on-demand, and repeatedly, remove greater than 80 % of a mixed community biofilm of P. mirabilis and E. coli. In summary, this study shows (1) strain in the elastomeric substrate actively debonds crystalline biofilms in vitro (2) modeling based on characterization of biofilm properties and understanding of substrate strain informs and facilitates prototype catheter design (3) urinary catheter prototypes utilizing inflation-induced substrate strain are capable of on-demand and repeatedly removing biofilms in vitro.

40|$|Left-right {{asymmetric}} organ {{development is}} critical to establish a proper body plan of vertebrates. In zebrafish, the Kupffer's vesicle (KV) is a fluid-filled sac which controls asymmetric organ development, and a properly inflated KV lumen by means of fluid influx {{is a prerequisite for}} the asymmetric signal transmission. However, {{little is known about the}} components that support the paracellular tightness between the KV luminal epithelial cells to sustain hydrostatic pressure during KV lumen expansion. Here, we identified that the claudin 5 a (cldn 5 a) is highly expressed at the apical surface of KV epithelial cells and tightly seals the KV lumen. Downregulation of cldn 5 a in zebrafish showed a failure in organ laterality that resulted from malformed KV. In addition, accelerated fluid influx into KV by combined treatment of forskolin and 3 -isobutyl- 1 -methylxanthine failed to expand the partially-formed KV lumen in cldn 5 a morphants. However, malformed KV lumen and defective heart laterality in cldn 5 a morphants were significantly rescued by exogenous cldn 5 a mRNA, suggesting that the tightness between the luminal epithelial cells is important for KV lumen formation. Taken together, these findings suggest that cldn 5 a is required for KV <b>lumen</b> <b>inflation</b> and left-right asymmetric organ development...|$|R
40|$|In {{autosomal}} dominant {{polycystic kidney disease}} (ADPKD), cyst inflation and continuous enlargement are associated with marked transepithelial ion and fluid secretion into the cyst lumen via cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Indeed, the inhibition or degradation of CFTR prevents the fluid accumulation within cysts. The in vivo mechanisms by which the lack of Polycystin- 2 leads to CFTR stimulation are an outstanding challenge in ADPKD research and may bring important biomarkers for the disease. However, hampering their study, the available ADPKD in vitro cellular models lack the three-dimensional architecture of renal cysts and the ADPKD mouse models offer limited access for live-imaging experiments in embryonic kidneys. Here, we tested the zebrafish Kupffer's vesicle (KV) as an alternative model-organ. KV is a fluid-filled vesicular organ, lined by epithelial cells that express both CFTR and Polycystin- 2 endogenously, being each of them easily knocked-down. Our data on the intracellular distribution of Polycystin- 2 support its involvement in the KV fluid-flow induced Ca 2 +-signalling. Mirroring kidney cysts, the KV <b>lumen</b> <b>inflation</b> is dependent on CFTR activity and, as we clearly show, the knockdown of Polycystin- 2 results in larger KV lumens through overstimulation of CFTR. In conclusion, we propose the zebrafish KV as a model organ to study the renal cyst inflation. Favouring its use, KV volume can be easily determined by in vivo imaging offering a live readout for screening compounds and genes that may prevent cyst enlargement through CFTR inhibition...|$|R
