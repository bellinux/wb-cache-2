This article presents a theoretical reflection exploring the concept of <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> in the context of nursing care. Theoretical references from several fields of knowledge, namely sociology and nursing, have been adopted to conceptualize the theme. Studies on <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> have contributed toward the understanding of the key issue of emotional management in healthcare institutions and both its positive and negative impact on clients and professionals.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> factors {{influencing}} job satisfaction, intent to leave, and nursing performance of clinical nurses. Method: The participants were 384 clinical nurses working in a hospital. Study design was cross sectional survey. Subcategories of <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> (frequency of <b>emotional</b> <b>labor,</b> attentiveness of <b>emotional</b> display, mismatch of emotions) of <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> were dependent variables. Job satisfaction, intent to leave, and nursing performance were independent variables. Data were analyzed by hierarchial multiple regression. Results: The strength of <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> of <b>nurses</b> was similar for all participants in spite of differences in age, position, and clinical career. Total score for <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> was 3. 21, frequency of <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> 3. 34, attentiveness of emotional display 3. 41, and mismatch of emotions 2. 87.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{synthesis}} of two doctoral theses where links are made between the intersubjective, relational dynamics seen in clinical supervision, and applied in practice to a framework for <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> in prison <b>nurses.</b> We explore the nature of intersubjectivity, from nursing and psychotherapeutic perspectives, and discuss {{the way in which}} it impacts on and influences relationships between nurses, prisoner patients, prison officers, and organizations within prison healthcare settings. The impact of this intersubjectivity is illustrated through the exploration of an intersubjective web that is created and informs interaction between the key actors within the prison nurse's practice, i. e., prison officers, prisoner patients, and the organization. We suggest that by being cognizant of the intersubjective web that influences these interactions, a more meaningful understanding of practice and relationships can be achieved. This deeper understanding can then be utilized to develop practitioners both professionally and personally. We conclude by promoting regular, formal clinical supervision as an ideal space within which to explore the way in which this intersubjective web influences relationships, impacts on <b>emotional</b> <b>labor,</b> and subsequently patient care and staff well being...|$|R
25|$|The fast-paced and {{unpredictable}} nature {{of health care}} places nurses at risk for injuries and illnesses, including high occupational stress. Nursing is a particularly stressful profession, and nurses consistently identify stress as a major work-related concern and have among {{the highest levels of}} occupational stress when compared to other professions. This stress is caused by the environment, psychosocial stressors, and the demands of nursing, including new technology that must be mastered, the <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> involved in <b>nursing,</b> physical <b>labor,</b> shift work, and high workload. This stress puts nurses at risk for short-term and long-term health problems, including sleep disorders, depression, mortality, psychiatric disorders, stress-related illnesses, and illness in general. Nurses are at risk of developing compassion fatigue and moral distress, which can worsen mental health. They also have very high rates of occupational burnout (40%) and emotional exhaustion (43.2%). Burnout and exhaustion increase the risk for illness, medical error, and suboptimal care provision.|$|R

40|$|<b>Emotional</b> <b>labor</b> (expressing {{emotions}} {{as part of}} one's job duties, as in “service with a smile”) can {{be beneficial}} for employees, organizations, and customers. Meta-analytical summaries reveal that deep acting (summoning up the appropriate feelings one wants to display) generally has positive outcomes. Unlike surface acting (faking emotions), deep acting does not harm employee well-being, and deep acting is positively related with job satisfaction, organizational commitment, job performance, and customer satisfaction. Emerging research also suggests that a third form of <b>emotional</b> <b>labor,</b> natural and genuine <b>emotional</b> <b>labor,</b> is a frequently used <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> strategy that has positive effects for both employees and customers.

40|$|Recent <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> {{scholarship}} in public administration conceptualizes <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> {{primarily as a}} psychological good benefiting the entire organization but disproportionately supplied by and expected of women.

40|$|Emotions are an {{important}} part of the workplace. <b>Emotional</b> <b>labor</b> describes the monitoring and management of one's emotions at work. Employees perform <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> in response to explicit and perceived display rules for emotional expressions in the workplace. While compliance with these rules is generally beneficial for the organization, it may be detrimental to employee well-being. This study proposes a process model of <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> that extends from display rules to job attitudes and behaviors. It is unique in that it investigates display rules and <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> at the group level of analysis. It also includes coworkers as well as customers as targets of <b>emotional</b> <b>labor.</b> Display rule commitment is proposed as {{an important}} moderator between <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> and important individual job attitudes and behaviors that may account for previously mixed findings in the literature. The hypotheses of this study received general support. Specifically, group level display rules and <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> were viable constructs that had important consequences for job outcomes. Display rule commitment was an important predictor of job attitudes and behaviors and moderated the relationship between group level surface acting and emotional exhaustion. In addition, group level <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> showed a significant effect on a number of important job outcomes. It also moderated the relationship between individual level <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> and job attitudes and behaviors.

40|$|In this {{qualitative}} study, I {{examine the}} experiences of African American pilots and flight attendants with <b>emotional</b> <b>labor.</b> Integral to existing theories of <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> is the incorporation of voices of color and their contemporary movement into professional industries. Essentially, most all theories of <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> were built through the examination of low-wage service workers in gendered or racially segregated occupations, with only recent incorporations of gendered occupations within professional settings. Using the theoretical concept of <b>emotional</b> <b>labor,</b> or the labor required to reduce or suppress feeling in order to sustain the outward countenance that produces the proper state of mind in others, I argue that <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> {{is much more than}} labor produced within the confines of a job, but is also based on identity characteristics that directly influence interactions in the workplace. Therefore, I qualitatively examine, through in-depth interviews with more than thirty African American flight crew members, how <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> is influenced and performed when people of color are introduced to professional settings. The results of this study show that there are multiple dimensions of <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> that should be added to existing theory. Primarily, existing standards of <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> in the airline industry are a direct result of institutional structures and cultures created during a period of systematic exclusion that do not account for contemporary racism and sexism. Thus, performing <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> in this industry is unequally placed on those white women and people of color that had no input into its creation. The {{results of this study suggest}} that <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> should be inclusive of systemic racism perspectives as a method of understanding how salient identity characteristics, such as gender, race, and class, are directly connected to preconceived ideologies that influence interactions that call for <b>emotional</b> <b>labor.</b> Moreover, because African American men and women in this industry are underrepresented, <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> becomes a necessity in their interactions with coworkers, consumers, and management. In addition, African Americans experience highly regulated <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> that influence how they perform their jobs, interact with others, and formulate appropriate counter-narratives...|$|R
40|$|Based {{on current}} {{literature}} and writing center lore, {{there is a}} lack of discussion surrounding the <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> of writing center consultants; however, the environment of the writing center and the job parameters create boundaries for consultant emotional expression thereby requiring that consultants engage in <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> to perform their role in the writing center. Drawing from one-hundred and six surveys and eleven interviews of consultants and directors, the results of this study demonstrate that consultants often engage in <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> through expressing positive emotions and suppressing negative emotions by using a variety of emotional management strategies. Discussions of emotional expression and emotional management provide grounding for the kinds of <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> consultants engage in and how consultants talk about that <b>emotional</b> <b>labor.</b> Moreover, consultants also discuss their <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> in terms of adhering to professional behavior making professionalism a potential catalyst for promoting productive discussion about <b>emotional</b> <b>labor.</b> The research demonstrates that triggers for consultant <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> stem from our beliefs about the job of a writing center consultant, writing center lore, consultant training, and administrator guidelines leading to the creation of consultant feeling rules.

40|$|This {{analysis}} {{provides an}} emergent framework that emphasizes a neglected component of both direct practice with families and organizational development. Human emotions, both beneficial (positive <b>emotional</b> <b>labor)</b> and harmful (negative <b>emotional</b> <b>labor),</b> have received short shrift in leadership development, supervision, direct practice preparation and supports, and workforce stabilization, and professionalization. Significantly, a key indicator of negative emotional labor—secondary traumatic stress (STS) —often has been ignored and neglected, {{despite the fact}} that it may be endemic in the workforce. STS typically results from traumatic events in practice, but it also stems from workplace violence. Often undetected and untreated, STS is at least a hidden correlate and perhaps a probable cause of myriad problems such as questionable practice with families, life-work conflicts, undesirable workforce turnover, and a sub-optimal organizational climate. Special interventions are needed. At the same time, new organizational designs are needed to promote and reinforce positive <b>emotional</b> <b>labor.</b> Arguably, positive <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> and the positive organizational climates it facilitates are requisites for harmonious relations between jobs and personal lives, desirable workforce retention, and better outcomes for children and families.

40|$|<b>Emotional</b> <b>labor</b> {{concerns}} {{the management of}} feelings to produce appropriate emotional displays {{for the purpose of}} work. The present thesis distinguishes between three levels at which the causes of <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> can be identified, and contributes to knowledge about the role of hitherto unexamined antecedents at each of these levels, as well as the flow on effects to relevant outcomes of <b>emotional</b> <b>labor.</b> At a between-person level, the majority of the <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> literature considers how distal variables lead to emotional labor; however, the effect of more proximal between-person motivational variables has received less attention. Within-person, episodic factors such as customer mistreatment and coworker support as well as dynamic factors such as serial positioning and trends over time are theoretically plausible causes of <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> that have not received enough attention. In this thesis, I present four studies that examine the relationship between <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> and its antecedents and outcomes, at each of these levels. In the first study, I test the effects of between-person differences in goal orientation on <b>emotional</b> <b>labor,</b> showing that individuals with high learning orientation are more likely to use deep acting as mediated by deep acting self-efficacy, whereas people with high performance goal orientation tend to use both <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> strategies as mediated by deep and surface acting self-efficacy. In the second study, I show that episodic customer mistreatment and coworker support jointly influence <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> and <b>emotional</b> exhaustion, including their rates of growth over time. Furthermore, surface acting mediates the negative link between customer mistreatment and employee wellbeing, while coworker support buffers the detrimental effect of surface acting on emotional exhaustion. Finally, in the third and fourth studies, I demonstrate the importance of dynamic-level effects by showing how serial position of <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> strategies and time-based trends in <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> influence customer satisfaction. Specifically, the positioning of deep acting {{at the end of an}} interaction and switching from surface to deep acting during an interaction lead to higher customer satisfaction. Switching from deep to surface acting predicts the lowest customer satisfaction. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|Emotional {{exhaustion}} is {{the core}} component {{in the study of}} teacher burnout, with significant impact on teachers’ professional lives. Yet, its relation to teachers’ emotional experiences and <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> during instruction remains unclear. Thirty-nine German secondary teachers were surveyed about their emotional exhaustion (trait), and via the Experience Sampling Method on their momentary (state; N = 794) emotional experiences (enjoyment, anxiety, anger) and momentary <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> (suppression, faking). Teachers reported that in 99 % and 39 % of all lessons, they experienced enjoyment and anger, respectively, whereas they experienced anxiety less frequently. Teachers reported suppressing or faking their emotions during roughly a third of all lessons. Furthermore, emotional exhaustion was reflected in teachers’ decreased experiences of enjoyment and increased experiences of anger. On an intra-individual level, all three emotions predict <b>emotional</b> <b>labor,</b> whereas on an inter-individual level, only anger evokes <b>emotional</b> <b>labor.</b> Explained variances in <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> (within: 39 %, between: 67 %) stress the relevance of emotions in teaching and within the context of teacher burnout. Beyond implying the importance of reducing anger, our findings suggest the potential of enjoyment lessening <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> and thereby reducing teacher burnout...|$|R

This issue also affects the firms’ outcomes and incomes. Thus, hotels as service providing firms {{must be able to}} manage the emotions of employees in order to increase the quality of services and to create value for customers. Controlling emotions of employees also contribute to gain competitive advantage across rivals. The objective {{of this paper is to}} reveal the effects of <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> on job attitudes of hotel employees by considering the mediating and moderating roles of social support and job autonomy. To this end, a questionnaire was employed to employees of hotels operating in Antalya Province. Results of the analyses support that <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> has a negative effect on <b>emotional</b> exhaustion. <b>Emotional</b> <b>labor</b> also has a positive effect on job satisfaction. In addition mediating and moderating roles of job autonomy and social support between emotional exhaustion and <b>emotional</b> <b>labor,</b> and <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> and job satisfaction...|$|R
40|$|We {{reviewed}} the studies on <b>emotional</b> <b>labors.</b> The topic of emotions {{in the workplace}} is beginning to gain increasing attention. The concept of <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> is defined as “the management of feeling to create a publicly observable facial and bodily display. ” There are two research domains of <b>emotional</b> <b>labor,</b> those are, feelings requested from the organization and employee’s strategies {{to deal with the}} organization’s request. At first, this review showed that feelings requested from the organization is the rules of emotional display, and it is mainly concerned discussed interms of frequency, attentiveness, variety, and emotional dissonance. Employee’s strategies correspondent to the organization’s request is the strategies of <b>emotional</b> <b>labor,</b> and it is mainly concerned with surface acting and deep acting. Second, we also described the antecedents and consequences of <b>emotional</b> <b>labor.</b> Finally, we argued that future research should focus on both feelings requested from the organization and employee’s strategies correspondent to the organization’ request simultaneously...|$|R
40|$|How {{does the}} organization’s social {{environment}} affect the <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> employees perform? Previous research on <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> {{has focused on}} the service sector and omitted examples in nonprofit organizations. To address this gap, I conducted interviews with staff members at a community-based, low-cost reproductive health clinic. Its internal work environment values strong co-worker relationships and support in coping with labor. I found three distinct realms of emotional labor: between clients and employees of the organization; amongst the staff of the organization; and between the organization and the surrounding society. Each realm corresponds to distinct challenges that contribute to employees’ experiences with <b>emotional</b> <b>labor.</b> Employees at community-based organizations understand their <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> as an extension of their personal values rather than as a way to earn a wage. The results confirm that employees experience <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> differently in community-based organizations and expect to be able to cope with this labor through strong co-worker relationships...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} three decades, <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> has been {{conceptualized}} as comprising three strategies, namely, surface acting, deep acting, and expression of naturally felt emotion. Research suggested that each <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> strategy relates differently to various health and job outcomes, such as burnout and job satisfaction. These findings and the conclusions drawn are predicated on compartmentalized treatment of the three strategies. A fundamental yet unresolved question concerns whether employees adopt more than one type of <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> in the workplace. In this study, we adopted latent profile analysis (LPA) to examine the behavioral profile (i. e., class) of employees 2 ̆ 7 deployment of <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> strategies and how these profiles relate to job satisfaction and burnout. Three latent classes were identified, and {{the results showed that}} employees with these different profiles reported significantly different levels of job satisfaction and burnout. These results provide support to a person-centered approach to understand the outcomes of performing <b>emotional</b> <b>labor...</b>|$|R
