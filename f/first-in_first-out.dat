40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{inventory management}} from an incentive perspective. We show {{that when a}} manager has private information about future attainable revenues, the residual income performance measure based on historical cost can achieve optimal (second-best) incentives with regard to managerial effort as well as production and sales decisions. The LIFO (last-in [...] first-out) inventory flow rule is shown to be preferable to the FIFO (<b>first-in</b> [...] <b>first-out)</b> rule {{for the purpose of}} aligning incentives. Our analysis also finds support for the lower-of-cost-or-market inventory-valuation rule in situations where the manager receives new information after the initial contracting stage. inventory management, historical cost accounting, decentralization, agency theory...|$|R
40|$|In a batch {{processing}} network, multiple jobs can be formed into a batch {{to be processed}} in a single service operation. The network is multiclass in that several job classes may be processed at a server. Jobs in di#erent classes cannot be mixed into a single batch. A batch policy specifies which class of jobs is to be served next. Throughput of a {{batch processing}} network depends on the batch policy used. When the maximum batch sizes are equal to one, the corresponding network is called a standard processing network, and the corresponding service policy is called a dispatch policy. There are many dispatch policies that have been proven to maximize the throughput in standard networks. This paper shows that any normal dispatch policy can be converted into a batch policy that preserves key stability properties. Examples of normal policies are given. These include static bu#er priority (SBP), <b>first-in</b> [...] <b>first-out</b> (FIFO) and generalized round robin (GRR) policies. Keywords: batch processing, multiclass queueing networks, stability, throughput, fluid model, semiconductor wafer fabrication, furnace operation. ...|$|R
50|$|A food {{rotation}} {{system is a}} front-loading shelving unit that organizes and rotates food cans on a <b>first-in</b> <b>first-out</b> basis (FIFO). An effective food {{rotation system}} is essential for storing food to prepare for catastrophes, preventing foodborne illness and controlling commercial kitchen costs. When used correctly, the <b>first-in</b> <b>first-out</b> food rotation method ensures serving safe food and eliminates spoiled food waste.|$|E
5000|$|Below is the pseudo-code of the algorithm. Here Q is a <b>first-in,</b> <b>first-out</b> queue of {{candidate}} vertices, and w(u, v) is the edge weight of (u, v).|$|E

40|$|Persistent {{neuronal}} firing {{has been}} modeled {{in relation to}} observed brain rhythms, especially to theta oscillations recorded in behaving animals. Models of short-term memory {{that are based on}} such persistent firing properties of specific neurons can meet the requirements of spike-timing [...] dependent potentiation of synaptic strengths during the encoding of a temporal sequence of spike patterns. We show that such a spiking buffer can be simulated with integrate-and-fire neurons that include a leak current even when different numbers of spikes represent successive items. We propose a mechanism that successfully replaces items in the buffer in <b>first-in</b> [...] <b>first-out</b> (FIFO) order when the distribution of spike density in a theta cycle is asymmetric, as found in experimental data. We predict effects on the function and capacity of the buffer model caused by changes in modeled theta cycle duration, the timing of input to the buffer, the strength of recurrent inhibition, and the strength and timing of after-hyperpolarization and after-depolarization (ADP). Shifts of input timing or changes in ADP parameters can enable the reverse-order buffering of items, with FIFO replacement in a full buffer. As noise increases, the simulated buffer provides robust output that may underlie episodic encoding...|$|R
50|$|In Dennis Lindley's first {{paper on}} the subject the {{equation}} is used to describe waiting times experienced by customers in a queue with the <b>First-In</b> <b>First-Out</b> (FIFO) discipline.|$|E
50|$|CDMI {{supports}} {{the concept of}} persistent FIFO (<b>first-in,</b> <b>first-out)</b> queues. These are useful for job scheduling, order processing and other tasks in which lists of things must be processed in order.|$|E
50|$|In mathematics, {{the queue}} number of a graph is a graph {{invariant}} defined analogously to stack number (book thickness) using <b>first-in</b> <b>first-out</b> (queue) orderings {{in place of}} last-in first-out (stack) orderings.|$|E
5000|$|One {{advantage}} of a ticket lock over other spinlock algorithms {{is that it is}} fair. The waiting threads are processed in a <b>first-in</b> <b>first-out</b> basis as the dequeue ticket integer increases, thus preventing starvation.|$|E
50|$|<b>First-In</b> <b>First-Out</b> (FIFO) {{assumes that}} the items {{purchased}} or produced first are sold first. Costs of inventory per unit or item are determined at the time made or acquired. The oldest cost (i.e., the first in) is then matched against revenue and assigned to cost of goods sold.|$|E
50|$|In {{computer}} storage, Bélády's anomaly is {{the phenomenon}} in which {{increasing the number}} of page frames results in {{an increase in the number}} of page faults for certain memory access patterns. This phenomenon is commonly experienced when using the <b>first-in</b> <b>first-out</b> (FIFO) page replacement algorithm. László Bélády demonstrated this in 1969.|$|E
5000|$|Most <b>first-in</b> <b>first-out</b> (FIFO) [...] {{storage devices}} are {{variable}}-length buffers {{in that the}} input rate may be variable while the output rate is constant or the output rate may be variable while the input rate is constant. Various clocking and control systems are used to allow control of underflow or overflow conditions.|$|E
5000|$|A switch may be {{composed}} of buffered input ports, a switch fabric and buffered output ports. If <b>first-in</b> <b>first-out</b> (FIFO) input buffers are used, only the oldest packet is available for forwarding. More recent arrivals cannot be forwarded if the oldest packet cannot be forwarded because its destination output is busy.The output may be busy if: ...|$|E
50|$|Some {{communications}} equipment manufacturers placed overly large buffers {{in some of}} their network products. In such equipment, bufferbloat occurs when a network link becomes congested, causing packets to become queued in buffers for too long. In a <b>first-in</b> <b>first-out</b> queuing system, overly large buffers result in longer queues and higher latency, and do not improve network throughput.|$|E
5000|$|Note {{also that}} this {{solution}} can only satisfy {{the condition that}} [...] "no thread shall be allowed to starve" [...] {{if and only if}} semaphores preserve <b>first-in</b> <b>first-out</b> ordering when blocking and releasing threads. Otherwise, a blocked writer, for example, may remain blocked indefinitely with a cycle of other writers decrementing the semaphore before it can.|$|E
50|$|Free {{movement}} of stored materials, on a <b>first-in,</b> <b>first-out</b> basis, {{is essential in}} maximizing silo efficiency. The goal of silo efficiency {{is to ensure that}} oldest material is used first and does not contaminate newer, fresher material. Two main problems, rat holing and bridging, complicate silo efficiency. When rat holing occurs, powders adhere to the sides of silos. Bridging occurs when material blocks at the silo base.|$|E
50|$|IAS 2 also {{requires}} {{the use of}} the <b>First-in,</b> <b>First-out</b> (FIFO) principle whereby those items which have been in stock the longest are considered to be the items that are being used first, ensuring that those items which are held in inventory at the reporting date are valued at the most recent price. As an alternative, costs of inventories may be assigned by using the weighted average cost formula.|$|E
5000|$|... "FIFO" [...] {{stands for}} <b>first-in,</b> <b>first-out,</b> {{meaning that the}} oldest {{inventory}} items are recorded as sold first but do {{not necessarily mean that}} the exact oldest physical object has been tracked and sold. In other words, the cost associated with the inventory that was purchased first is the cost expenses first. With FIFO, the cost of inventory reported on the balance sheet represents the cost of the inventory most recently purchased.|$|E
5000|$|In {{computer}} science, {{a command}} queue is a queue for enabling the delay of command execution, either {{in order of}} priority, on a <b>first-in</b> <b>first-out</b> basis, or in any order that serves the current purpose. Instead of waiting each command to be executed before sending the next one, the program just puts all the commands in the queue and goes on doing other things while the queue is processed by the executor component (e.g. hard drive).|$|E
50|$|Packet mode {{communication}} may {{be implemented}} {{with or without}} intermediate forwarding nodes (packet switches or routers). Packets are normally forwarded by intermediate network nodes asynchronously using <b>first-in,</b> <b>first-out</b> buffering, but may be forwarded according to some scheduling discipline for fair queuing, traffic shaping, or for differentiated or guaranteed quality of service, such as weighted fair queuing or leaky bucket. In case of a shared physical medium (such as radio or 10BASE5), the packets may be delivered according to a multiple access scheme.|$|E
5000|$|It is a {{standard}} feature for a UART to store the most recent character while receiving the next. This [...] "double buffering" [...] gives a receiving computer an entire character transmission time to fetch a received character. Many UARTs have a small <b>first-in,</b> <b>first-out</b> FIFO buffer memory between the receiver shift register and the host system interface. This allows the host processor even more time to handle an interrupt from the UART and prevents loss of received data at high rates.|$|E
50|$|Costs are {{associated}} with particular goods {{using one of the}} several formulas, including specific identification, <b>first-in</b> <b>first-out</b> (FIFO), or average cost. Costs include all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs that are incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Costs of goods made by the businesses include material, labor, and allocated overhead. The costs of those goods which are not yet sold are deferred as costs of inventory until the inventory is sold or written down in value.|$|E
50|$|Devaynes v Noble (1816) 35 ER 781, {{best known}} for the claim {{contained}} in Clayton's case, created a rule, or rather common law presumption in relation to the distribution of monies from a bank account. The rule is based upon the deceptively simple notion of <b>first-in,</b> <b>first-out</b> to determine the effect of payments from an account, and will normally apply in the absence of evidence of any other intention. Payments are presumed to be appropriated to debts in the order in which the debts are incurred.|$|E
50|$|Assignment {{occurs when}} an option holder {{exercises}} his option by notifying his broker, who then notifies the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC). The OCC fulfills the contract, then selects, randomly, a member firm who was short the same option contract. The OCC then notifies the firm. The firm then carries out its obligation, and then selects a customer, either randomly, <b>first-in,</b> <b>first-out,</b> {{or some other}} equitable method who was short the option, for assignment. That customer is assigned the exercise requiring him to fulfill the obligation that he agreed to when he wrote the option.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] {{interface}} {{defines the}} queue data structure, which stores {{elements in the}} order in which they are inserted. New additions go {{to the end of the}} line, and elements are removed from the front. It creates a <b>first-in</b> <b>first-out</b> system. This interface is implemented by , , and [...] LinkedList, of course, also implements the List interface and can also be used as one. But it also has the Queue methods. ArrayDeque implements the queue as an array. Both LinkedList and ArrayDeque also implement the [...] interface, giving it more flexibility.|$|E
50|$|Mura, {{in terms}} of business/process improvement, is avoided through Just-In-Time systems {{which are based on}} keeping little or no inventory. These systems supply the {{production}} process with the right part, at the right time, In the right amount, using <b>first-in,</b> <b>first-out</b> (FIFO) component flow. Just-In-Time systems create a “pull system” in which each sub-process withdraws its needs from the preceding sub-processes, and ultimately from an outside supplier. When a preceding process does not receive a request or withdrawal it does not make more parts. This type of system is designed to maximize productivity by minimizing storage overhead.|$|E
50|$|The {{performance}} of the algorithm is strongly determined by {{the order in which}} candidate vertices are used to relax other vertices. In fact, if Q is a priority queue, then the algorithm pretty much resembles Dijkstra's. However, since a priority queue is not used here, two techniques are sometimes employed {{to improve the quality of}} the queue, which in turn improves the average-case performance (but not the worst-case performance). Both techniques rearranges the order of elements in Q so that vertices closer to the source are processed first. Therefore, when implementing these techniques, Q is no longer a <b>first-in,</b> <b>first-out</b> queue, but rather a normal doubly linked list or double-ended queue.|$|E
50|$|The main {{advantage}} of carton flow rack over static rack or shelving systems is that merchandise remains better organized {{and easier to}} find or pick. With carton flow rack, the product is automatically rotated on a <b>first-in,</b> <b>first-out</b> basis. Merchandise is stocked {{in the rear of}} the carton flow rack and moves toward the picking station in front on an inclined shelf equipped with specially designed roller track. When a carton is removed from the picking station, the next one in line rolls to the front. Carton flow always keeps items within reach. Inventory is easier to monitor and control since products are fully visible at all times.|$|E
50|$|A risk {{management}} system operates at the back end. The consignments selected by the system under green channel are cleared immediately after payment of duty and taxes. At present, almost 30-33% consignments are cleared under green channel. Remaining consignments are sent either to yellow channel (on line scrutiny of documents by assessing officer {{on the basis of}} declaration, without examination of the goods) or red channel where examination (or inspection) is conducted. As a result of this system examination has been reduced from 100% to around 40%. Moreover, presence of importer’s representative/ clearing agent is not required. <b>First-in</b> <b>first-out</b> (FIFO) based assessment scheme has reduced chances of undue favor or manipulation by customs staff.|$|E
50|$|The {{likelihood}} that a crowdsourced project will fail {{due to lack of}} monetary motivation or too few participants increases {{over the course of the}} project. Crowdsourcing markets are not a <b>first-in,</b> <b>first-out</b> queue. Tasks that are not completed quickly may be forgotten, buried by filters and search procedures so that workers do not see them. This results in a long-tail power law distribution of completion times. Additionally, low-paying research studies online have higher rates of attrition, with participants not completing the study once started. Even when tasks are completed, crowdsourcing does not always produce quality results. When Facebook began its localization program in 2008, it encountered some criticism for the low quality of its crowdsourced translations.|$|E
50|$|The {{simplest}} page-replacement {{algorithm is}} a FIFO algorithm. The <b>first-in,</b> <b>first-out</b> (FIFO) page replacement algorithm is a low-overhead algorithm that requires little bookkeeping {{on the part}} of the operating system. The idea is obvious from the name - the operating system keeps track of all the pages in memory in a queue, with the most recent arrival at the back, and the oldest arrival in front. When a page needs to be replaced, the page at the front of the queue (the oldest page) is selected. While FIFO is cheap and intuitive, it performs poorly in practical application. Thus, it is rarely used in its unmodified form. This algorithm experiences Bélády's anomaly.In simple words, on a page fault, the frame that has been in memory the longest is replaced.|$|E
