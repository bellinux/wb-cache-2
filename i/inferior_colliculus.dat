The steepness of the acoustical filter for 83. 3 kHz signals {{and the frequency}} of the echoes heard by Greater Horse-shoe Bats is accentuated by averaging methods.

40|$|It has {{previously}} been shown that acoustic overstimulation induces cell death and extensive cell loss in key structures of the central auditory pathway. A correlation between noise-induced apoptosis and cell loss was hypothesized for the cochlear nucleus and <b>colliculus</b> <b>inferior.</b> To determine the role of cell death in noise-induced cell loss in thalamic and cortical structures, the present mouse study (NMRI strain) describes the time course following noise exposure of cell death mechanisms for the ventral medial geniculate body (vMGB), medial MGB (mMGB), and dorsal MGB (dMGB) and the six histological layers of the primary auditory cortex (AI 1 – 6). Therefore, a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dioxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling assay (TUNEL) was performed in these structures 24 [*]h, 7 days, and 14 days after noise exposure (3 [*]h, 115 [*]dB sound pressure level, 5 – 20 [*]kHz), {{as well as in}} unexposed controls.

To investigate the function of Ap- 2 d, wde analyzed its expression during embryogenesis and generated Ap- 2 d-deficient mice. In line with the specific expression pattern of Ap- 2 d in the mesencephalic tectum and the dorsal midbrain, Ap- 2 d-deficient mice failed to maintain the <b>colliculus</b> <b>inferior,</b> a derivative of the dorsal midbrain, {{as a consequence of}} increased apoptotic cell death. To identify specific Ap- 2 d target genes in cells of the developing dorsal midbrain, we performed whole genome analysis of cDNA expression levels. This approach identified a set of 12 putative target genes being expressed in the developing midbrain, including the transcription factors Pitx 2, Mef 2 c, Bhlhb 4 and Pou 4 f 3. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (CHIP) we showed that some of these genes are direct targets of Ap- 2 d. Consistently, we demonstrate that Ap- 2 d occupies and activates the Pou 4 f 3 and Bhlhb 4 promoters. In addition, known Pou 4 f 3 target genes were downregulated in the posterior midbrain of Ap- 2 d-deficient mice. Despite the absence of a central part of the auditory pathway, the presence of neuronal responses to sounds in the neocortex of Ap- 2 d-deficient mice indicates that auditory information from the brainstem still reaches the neocortex.

40|$|Summary. Collicular evoked {{potentials}} in Rhinolophus ferrum equinum show {{very prominent}} {{responses to the}} final frequency modulated part of a acoustic stimulus, simulating the natural echolocation sound. The Greater Horseshoe Bat (Rhinolophus/errumequinum) emits echolocation sounds consisting of a long part of constant frequency (ef) and a shorter final frequency modulated part (fm) sweeping down 14 - 16 kHz. Flying bats lower the frequency in order to compensate for Doppler-shift (Schnitzler, 1968). The eehofrequency is therefore kept constant at about {{the frequency of the}} ef-part emitted by resting bats. The long cf-part is thought to be used for relative velocity measurements by Doppler-shifts, whereas it is still unknown if the short final fro-part renders any usefull information to the bat. Nembutal anesthetized Horseshoe Bats (3 mg Nembutal/ 100 g body-weight) were stimulated by sounds of their own echotype simulated elec-tronically by a trapezoid pulse generator (HP 8002 A), VCG-function generator (Wavetek 112) and an electronic switch. The ultrasonic speaker was placed 30 ~ above the plane of the bat's upper jaw and 30 ~ laterally to the body axis. Evoked potentials were recorded from the contra-lateral and ipsilateral <b>colliculus</b> <b>inferior</b> by Ag-AgCl-electrodes. The recorded signals were amplified by a differential amplifier (Tektronix 2 A 61). For every set of stimulus parameters 100 cycles were summed up by a signal averager (Didae 800 Intertechnique) in order to improve signal to noise ratio. The recorded collicular evoked responses how typical on-responses to the beginning and a very prominent off-response {{to the end of the}} simulated echolocation sound (Fig. 1 b). In potentials evoked by pure cf-tones of 83. 3 kHz the off-response is hardly detectable or even missing (Fig. 1 a). Thus the prominent off-response must be caused by the final fro-part of the echolocation sound. 11 Z. vergl. Physiologie, Bd. 7...|$|R
40|$|Based on the {{frequency}} {{analysis of the}} cochlea and the volley principle, as Wever (1949) described it, periodic sound is represented in the auditory system by periodic firing patterns. Cariani & Delgutte (1996) {{have shown that the}} distribution of interspike intervals (ISI) between all spikes in the auditory nerve provide a code of acoustical information. A time series analysis of neural spike trains leads to autocorrelation histograms that show maxima for periods corresponding to the perceived pitch. Tramo, Cariani, Delgutte & Braida (2001) found out that consonant intervals evoke periodic firing patterns in the auditory nerve, whereas dissonant intervals show irregular spike trains without periodicity. Since Licklider (1951), a neuronal autocorrelation mechanism has been regarded as a possible basis of pitch perception. Licklider’s model still was highly speculative, but Langer & Schreiner (1988) have really found a bank of neural circuits to perform a neuronal periodicity analysis which corresponds to the mathematics of autocorrelation. This neuronal periodicity detection is performed in the time domain by a neuronal delay mechanism and a coincidence detection in the <b>colliculus</b> <b>inferior.</b> 2. Aims In a neuronal periodicity analysis mechanism common periods of the two tones of an interval are detected as coinciding pulses. The mathematical calculation of spike trains by autocorrelation functions shall help understanding the logical structure of coinciding neuronal firing patterns that represent intervals in the auditory systems. A measure value for the degree of coincidence shall be defined to answer the question whether neuronal coincidence may lead to consonance. 3. The mathematical model of periodicity detection of intervals To form a mathematical model of neural coding and autocorrelation for periodicity detection, a sequence of equidistant pulses p! shall represent a pitch.

Nós pretendemos contribuir para o conhecimento das projeções ascendentes e descendentes do LSO, usando um traçador neuronal anterógrado. Nós utilizamos o Biotin-Dextran-Amine (BDA) injetado no LSO de ratos, 15 a 20 dias depois os ratos eram perfundidos, os encéfalos e medulas foram seccionados e tratados histoquimicamente. Nós encontramos que existem 4 vias eferentes do LSO, tanto ascendentes como descendentes no sistema nervoso central, como segue: duas vias ascendentes, uma ipsilateral à injeção, a mais proeminente e a via contralateral que é menos densa; duas vias descendentes, uma ipsilateral muito menos evidente, e a contralateral que é moderada. Seguindo a via ascendente ipsilateral, nós encontramos as seguintes estruturas bem marcadas com BDA: o próprio LSO, núcleo do corpo trapezóide, o lemnisco lateral e seus núcleos, colículos inferior e superior e os seguintes núcleos talâmicos: suprageniculado, geniculado medial, partes dorsal e medial e córtex somatosensorial primário.

Os dados que nós encontramos neste trabalho sugerem que as vis do LSO podem se estender até o córtex somatosensorial no prosencéfalo e o complexo de núcleos cocleares no tronco, enviando colaterais para os principais núcleos relacionados a via auditiva, provavelmente contribuindo para a localização da fonte sonora, em acordo com a anatomia desta informação sensorial específica. After {{the discovery}} of the Urocortin- 1, a neuropeptide found mainly in the Edinger-Westphal nucleus and in the lateral superior olive nucleus (LSO), the attention was caught about the lack of known projections of both nuclei. We intended to contribute to the knowledge of both ascending and descending projections of the LSO, using a neuronal anterograde tracer. In order to do that we use the Biotin-Dextran-Amine (BDA) injected in the LSO of rats, fifteen to twenty days later the rats were perfused, the brains and spinal cords were cut and the sections treated histochemically. We have found that there are four pathways leaving the LSO either ascending or descending in the central nervous system, as following: two ascending pathways, one ipsilateral to the injection, the most proeminent one and the contralateral pathway that is less dense; two descending pathways, one ipsilateral, much less evident, and the contralateral that is very moderate. Tracking the ipsilateral ascending pathway we have found the following structures well labeled with BDA: the LSO itself, nucleus of the trapezoid body, the lateral lemniscus and its nuclei, <b>inferior</b> and superior <b>colliculus,</b> the following thalamic nuclei: suprageniculate, medial geniculate, dorsal and medial parts and the primary somatosensory cortex.

40|$|Die vorliegende Arbeit untersucht die neuronale Repräsentation von cochleären Verzerrungsprodukten im auditorischen Mittelhirn der Wüstenrennmaus. Die hohe Sensitivität und die gute Frequenzauflösung des Hörorgans der Säugetiere basiert auf einer aktiven mechanischen Verstärkung der schallinduzierten Basilarmembranschwingung im Innenohr. Die äußeren Haarsinneszellen, die während des Transduktionsprozesses zyklisch ihre Länge ändern und dabei zusätzliche Schwingungsenergie in das System zurückführen, sind der zugrunde liegende Motor des aktiven cochleären Verstärkers. Die stark nichtlinearen Eigenschaften dieses Verstärkers führen allerdings bei gleichzeitiger Verstärkung mehrerer Frequenzkomponenten zur Generierung von Kombinationsschwingungen, welche im Ursprungssignal nicht vorhanden sind. Wird das Ohr beispielsweise durch zwei Töne mit den Frequenzen f 1 und f 2 stimuliert (f 1 f 1), DPs are {{generated}} {{in the region of}} overlap of the two stimulus travelling waves and the most distinct distortion products are the quadratic distortion-tone (f 2 -f 1) and the cubic distortion-tone (2 f 1 -f 2). From their generation site they propagate via the cochlear fluid space in both directions, i. e. both towards the base of the cochlear where they are reversely transmitted via the middle ear into the ear channel and towards the apex of the cochlea to their characteristic frequency site where they may activate the sound transduction process and subsequent neuronal processing. In the ear channel the distortion product energy can be measured as distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAEs). Neuronal correlates of cochlear DPs can be measured in several brain regions along the auditory pathway. In the present Phd-thesis the neuronal correlates and the otoacoustic emissions of cochlear distortion products were measured simultaneously. By comparing the neuronal responses with the peripheral DPOAE measures possible changes of the neuronal representation of cochlear DPs should be revealed. For this purpose the electrical activity of 91 neurons in the <b>colliculus</b> <b>inferior</b> of the Mongolian gerbil was recorded while the contra lateral ear was stimulated with two high frequency stimuli and DPOAE were measured. The frequencies of the stimulus tones (f 1 and f 2) where chosen such that the frequency of a resulting DP (f 2 -f 1 or 2 f 1 -f 2) matched the characteristic frequency of the recorded auditory neuron. In 95 ~% of all measurements a strong neuronal response could be measured during two tone stimulation which {{can be attributed to the}} intracochlear stimulation by a distinct DP. The stimulation with one of the two stimuli alone did not induce any neuronal response. In a subset of the measurements the neuronal response during two tone stimulation could be successfully canceled by a third phase adjusted tone with a frequency equal to the DP frequency what provides evidence for the intra cochlear DP as source of the neuronal response. While at DP frequencies above 1. 3 kHz the neuronal responses near threshold could be well described by the DPOAE level, at lower frequencies an increasing discrepancy between intra cochlear DP level and the DPOAE level in the ear channel is obvious. Part of the low frequency neurons already responded during stimulation with the high frequency stimuli with stimulus levels at or below the neuronal threshold. Again, high intracochlear DP-levels were verified by the cancellation of the neuronal DP-response with a third phase-adjusted tone stimulus at the DP frequency. A frequency-specific reduction of middle ear gain at low frequencies is possibly involved in the reduction of DPOAE level. The results indicate that pitch-related properties of complex stimuli may be produced partially by high intracochlear f 2 -f 1 distortion levels...|$|R
