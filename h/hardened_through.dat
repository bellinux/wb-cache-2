An added benefit is that hollow core can be formed if the gas is introduced via holes in the core surface which cause only the surface of the core to harden; the remaining sand is then just dumped out to be used again. For example, a cold-box sand casting core binder is sodium silicate which hardens on exposure to carbon dioxide.|$|E

Tempering imparts the steel its flexibility and toughness according to the phase diagrams for steel. There are three types of steel blade according {{to the level of}} tempering it has received. Hard-tempered, medium-tempered and soft-tempered. Hard-tempered edges last longer but sharpening them is difficult. The converse is true for soft-tempered blades.

It is primarily because of their growing mistrust of Osborn, with Namor's discoveries of the Sentry slaying the Atlantean terrorists but initially containing his rage [...] but later joining the Dark X-Men because of his romance with Emma Frost, who convinced him to join the Dark X-Men and psychically enters his mind, seeking to uncover the answers to some of her questions. Frost extended an invitation to Cloak and Dagger to join the true X-Men as they teleported to the newly created island base, Utopia. Both Frost and Namor's relationship with Osborn appear to be deeply strained at this point, with the former Green Goblin telling the Dark Avengers and Dark X-Men to bring him Namor's head and Emma Frost's heart and that Summers sees them do it. Emma Frost and Namor both officially quit the Cabal, to be replaced with two new members, [...] "without the other remaining Cabal members having any say in the matter" [...] in Siege: The Cabal. However, an enraged and vengeful Osborn now unhesitantly strives to destroy Namor and his people as payback for his betrayal and joining the X-Men. Emma Frost promises to help him as he has helped her and her team, and the entire team of X-Men immediately work to investigate the Atlantean casualties, evacuate the survivors, and aid Namor against this mysterious new marine threat, the Marrina-Monster. Namor is forced to kill his former lover to stop her, but soon confronts Osborn over his controlling her to get revenge on Namor, vowing to kill him for his crimes. Though the actual confrontation is unseen, later Namor's name is seen crossed out on Osborn's List. Elsewhere, Namor and Reed Richards reach the tomb of Captain America, but discovers no dead body of their fallen comrade, to the shock of both men. Despite Doom's displeasure at Osborn's moving against Namor in Siege: The Cabal and his demanding Osborn stop his course of revenge (which led to the destruction of their own alliance), it is revealed that as [...] "every hero involved in the coming conflict desires vengeance on Doom for various reasons", Emma Frost and Namor, now both members in good standing of the X-Men, will also seek to make Doom pay for his treachery against them, in DoomWar, which indicates that for a variety of reasons, from Doom's capturing of the X-Man Storm to his deceptive attempt to convince Shuri that it was actually Namor who had assaulted her brother, has destroyed Doom's once-strong alliance with Namor. Furthermore, Doom has also claimed that he does not trust Namor, due to the two of them having clashed after they allied against common foes in the past, and should his alliance with Namor fail, with Namor turning on him, {{he would be willing to}} join forces with Attuma, an arch-enemy of Namor's, and one he believes could serve as a [...] "counter" [...] to Namor. At some point into the Dark Reign after the formation of the Cabal, though it is depicted that a large portion of Atlantean civilians still reside in the oceans under Namor's rule, Namor makes it clear that the Atlantean military is still residing in Latveria, when he proposes for an Atlantean mutant to move to Latveria with them, though no such military force was seen when Doom was assaulted by Morgan le Fay [...] or when the Asgardians moved into Latveria. However, Namor, after the events of Utopia, reveals to the X-Men upon Osborn's schemes causing hundreds if not thousands of his people to perish, that the Atlantean military force were far away, [...] "outside" [...] of Latveria, implying that though his alliance with Osborn has been destroyed, his alliance with Doctor Doom in some form still exists.|$|E

40|$|The {{hardening}} behaviour of three cold-worked platinum alloys, Pt 5 at% Mo, Pt 5 wt% Ru and Pt 5 wt% Cu, {{has been investigated}} through a systematic series of heat treatments. All three of the experimental alloys showed a hardness increase during annealing within a specific temperature range. The hardness of the Pt-Mo and Pt-Ru alloys was found to increase rapidly at annealing temperatures above the recrystallisation temperature, with the final hardness similar to the original coldworked hardness. The hardness of Pt-Cu showed an increase of up to 30 % at low annealing temperatures of between 200 °C and 500 °C. In addition, the Pt-Cu alloy also showed the increased hardness found in Pt-Mo and Pt-Ru at high annealing temperatures, but the hardness increase was not to the same extent. Specimens subjected to the annealing treatments were studied by means of optical, scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy, {{in order to determine}} the effect of annealing on microstructure and structural order. Resistivity, XRD and OTA techniques were employed in order to study the mechanisms of ordering with temperature, but these techniques did not produce any significant results. It was concluded that the most likely cause for the hardness increase observed in all three experimental alloys was due to a change in structural order upon annealing. The Pt-Mo and Pt-Ru alloys <b>hardened</b> <b>through</b> an increase in short-range order at annealing temperatures above the recrystallisation temperature. The Pt-Cu alloy <b>hardened</b> <b>through</b> the development of long-range order on annealing between 200 °C and 500 °C.

5|$|The main {{disadvantage}} to {{die casting}} {{is the very}} high capital cost. Both the casting equipment required and the dies and related components are very costly, as compared to most other casting processes. Therefore, to make die casting an economic process, a large production volume is needed. Other disadvantages are that the process is limited to high-fluidity metals, and casting weights must be between 30grams (1oz) and 10kg (20lb). In the standard die casting process the final casting will have {{a small amount of}} porosity. This prevents any heat treating or welding, because the heat causes the gas in the pores to expand, which causes micro-cracks inside the part and exfoliation of the surface. Thus a related disadvantage of die casting is that it is only for parts in which softness is acceptable. Parts needing <b>hardening</b> (<b>through</b> <b>hardening</b> or case hardening) and tempering are not cast in dies.|$|R
