If the city were entirely in one province or the other, Lloydminster's population would rank ninth in Alberta and fifth in Saskatchewan. It is renowned for its booming petroleum industry and the OTS <b>Heavy</b> <b>Oil</b> Science Centre. The highway is surveyed north of the Battle River and south of the North Saskatchewan River. Marshall is the first town southeast of Lloydminster with 533 residents is also the hometown of NHL Goaltender, Braden Holtby.

50|$|Environmental {{concerns}} with <b>heavy</b> <b>oils</b> {{are similar to}} those with lighter oils. However, they provide additional concerns, such as the need to heat <b>heavy</b> <b>oils</b> to pump them out of the ground. Extraction also requires large volumes of water.|$|R
25|$|Often called {{conventional}} <b>heavy</b> <b>oil,</b> this low-density oil can {{be recovered}} by conventional drilling techniques or by waterflood, a technique of injecting {{water into the}} reservoir to increase pressure, thus forcing the oil toward the well bore. When these techniques work, <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> is like the more commercially attractive lighter grades of oil. But <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> can also be quite viscous. It can need some form of heat or solvent and pressure before it can flow into a well bore to be produced. When <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> requires these techniques to go into production, it is known as non-conventional <b>heavy</b> <b>oil.</b>|$|E
25|$|These {{developments}} made <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> for {{the first}} time more than a marginal resource. Within five years, area production had increased fivefold to nearly 2,000 cubic metres per day. By the early 1990s, production from the <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> belt was some 40,000 cubic metres per day, and Husky was still one of Canada's biggest <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> producers.|$|E
25|$|Few Canadian {{refineries}} can {{process more}} than {{small amounts of}} <b>heavy</b> <b>oil,</b> so production has traditionally gone to United States asphalt plants.

Like the plants at Syncrude, Suncor and Shell's Scotford facility near Edmonton, these refinery-like operations turn <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> and bitumen into lighter and lower-sulfur, more desirable crude.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Aquathermolysis {{reaction}} of <b>heavy</b> <b>oils</b> occurring in {{high temperature water}} environment significantly degrades the heavy components of <b>heavy</b> <b>oils,</b> improves oil quality and reduces its viscosity. Aerosol, oil-soluble, and water-soluble nickel catalysts obviously and effectively catalyze the aquathermolysis {{reaction of}} <b>heavy</b> <b>oils</b> in a high temperature and reduces its viscosity, producing a gas increase of 49 %, 41 % and 21 % respectively compared with the result with {{the absence of any}} catalyst. An aerosol, oil-soluble and water-soluble nickel catalyst compound (best quality ratio 1 : 1 : 2) increases the <b>oil</b> recovery of <b>heavy</b> <b>oils</b> by 8. 5 % and decreases the viscosity of sample oil and average relative molecular mass of porous media by 89. 6 % and 23 % respectively, with its resin and asphaltene content significantly reduced. The pilot field tests show that, the test cycle production of <b>heavy</b> <b>oils</b> of each well proves an increase of 81. 2 ~ 226. 1 t (not considering the cycle decline rate) over the previous one, which means that the field tests coincide with the laboratory experiments...|$|R
40|$|The {{viscosity}} of <b>heavy</b> <b>oils</b> is {{a crucial}} factor in estimating oil recovery. Viscosity plays a vital character in reservoir simulations {{as well as in}} estimating the easiness of fluid flow, estimating oil recovery, and choosing a production model. The authors present a new intelligent model, a GA-LSSVM, used for predicting the viscosity of <b>heavy</b> <b>oils.</b> The experimental data employed in this work are the product of searching in many <b>heavy</b> <b>oils</b> data gathered from the literature. Development of robust predictive models to predict the viscosity of <b>heavy</b> <b>oils</b> is of immense help in many process engineering applications. The outcomes revealed that GA-LSSVM is able to capture the complicated and nonlinear relation between the input and output variables. GA-LSSVM model resulted in R 2 and mean absolute error values of 0. 9999 and 0. 9924, respectively...|$|R

25|$|The {{private sector}} {{partners}} {{pulled out of}} the Plains Upgrader because upgrading <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> at that time was a risky financial proposition. To be economic, these projects rely on substantial differences in pricing ("differentials") between light and heavy crude oil. <b>Heavy</b> <b>oil</b> is worth less than light oil; the question is, How much less?

25|$|The first <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> discoveries {{came with}} the pursuit of {{conventional}} light and medium crude oil.

25|$|The {{skilled worker}} {{shortage}} {{was much more}} severe in Venezuela because the government controlled oil company PDVSA fired most of its <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> experts after the Venezuelan general strike of 2002–03, and wound down the production of Orimulsion, which was the primary product from its oil sands. Following that, the government re-nationalized the Venezuelan oil industry and increased taxes on it. The result was that foreign companies left Venezuela, as did most of its elite <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> technical experts. In recent years, Venezuela's <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> production has been falling, and it has consistently been failing to meet its production targets.|$|E
40|$|International audienceMolecular {{diffusion}} of gases in <b>heavy</b> <b>oils</b> {{is one of}} the most important physical parameter governing cold production processes such as solution gas drive or Vapex. Indeed, the way bubbles are able to grow by diffusion will have a direct impact on gas mobilization and consequently on oil recovery. Furthermore, the importance of this parameter is emphasized by the very low gas availability characterizing extra <b>heavy</b> <b>oils.</b> Surprisingly, publications of experimental data concerning gas diffusivity in <b>heavy</b> <b>oils</b> are relatively rare. Furthermore, published values can vary by different orders of magnitude. This is probably due to the fact that this kind of measurement is quite tricky. Indeed gas leakages in high pressure cells could be in the same order of magnitude than gas diffusion in oil. To study very viscous <b>oil</b> (extra <b>heavy</b> <b>oils),</b> corresponding to very low diffusivity, it is thus necessary to carefully analyze the obtained results. The aim of this work is to characterize experimental fickian diffusivity of methane in <b>heavy</b> <b>oils</b> using two different concepts in order to be able to validate the experimental results. In this paper we present the two different methods (thermophysics and analytical) we have settled. Experimental results clearly indicate that diffusivity in extra <b>heavy</b> <b>oils</b> is lower than usually considered for 'conventional' oil. From various experimental results we also propose a first mathematical model to simulate the influence of temperature on gas diffusivity...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – The {{accuracy}} of the Modified-Nasrifar-Moshfeghian (MNM) EOS in predicting the densities of <b>heavy</b> <b>oils</b> and their SARA fractions was evaluated. Each SARA fraction of four western Canadian <b>heavy</b> <b>oils</b> and bitumens {{was treated as a}} pseudo component. The equation of state was tuned with only one set of measured densities and were thereafter used for density predictions with no further fitting parameters. The results showed the MNM EOS without any volume correction could predict the SARA densities with accuracy similar to the SRK EOS with volume correction. The small error indicates that the tuned EOS could be used to accurately predict the densities of the SARA fractions of at least the Western Canadian <b>heavy</b> <b>oils</b> and bitumens...|$|R
