Recently, some strobe lights {{have been found to}} use rectified mains electricity and no capacitors at all. In a capacitor-based strobe light, the capacitor is charged up to around 300 V. Once the capacitor has been charged, a small amount of power is diverted into a trigger transformer, a small transformer with a high turns ratio.

This part of the energy will introduce very <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>spike</b> on the main switch. A clamp circuit is needed. Passive clamp flyback converter is with few components and effectively clamping the voltage stress on transistor. But its switching frequency is limited by its switching loss.

The aim of this project is to investigate high switching frequency Active Clamp Flyback converter with GaN transistor as power factor correction in lighting application. With the active clamp loop, the leakage inductance energy and snubber loss could be utilized properly to allow ZVS on switches under all line and load conditions and recycled to input source.
