Talisman executives {{made it clear that they}} were uncomfortable with Christopher investigating the story, and sent a letter to CHED threatening to sue the company for libel if the story was ever reported. After Christopher filed the story the station refused to report it. Christopher attempted to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> carried by other local media companies, including Global TV and The Edmonton Journal; they refused to run the story.|$|E
500|$|The {{downloadable}} episode Turnabout Reclaimed {{was written}} by the game designer Yuki Nakamura, {{with the concept of}} [...] "lighthearted fun" [...] to set it apart from the main game. The first thing she decided on was to feature an orca, and <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> take place in an aquarium; it took her several tries to decide {{on the rest of the}} story. One of the scrapped ideas involved the orca stealing treasures from the aquarium and attacking people by the shore during its escape to the sea, with the episode's mystery involving the reason for the orca's behavior. The opening for this draft would have involved guards and detective Fulbright vaguely referring to someone escaping; the intention was that the player would think they were talking about Blackquill, before it was revealed to be the orca.|$|E
500|$|Blood and Palicki {{returned}} as principal cast members {{for the third}} season of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. In August 2015, the spin-off series received new life, reworked as Marvel's Most Wanted and given a pilot order. Bell and Zbyszewski were again developing the series, writing the pilot and executive producing. The pair were set to serve as showrunners for the series, if it was picked up. Loeb and Jim Chory were also attached as executive producers. The series would still focus on Morse and Hunter, with Palicki and Blood both attached, and was described as [...] "a new take focusing on the same duo and their continuing adventures." [...] In January 2016, Lee stated that the pilot was [...] "absolutely" [...] moving forward, praising the script and saying production would begin [...] "in the next few months." [...] In the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. episode [...] "Parting Shot", the two characters were written off that series, having them leave and [...] S.H.I.E.L.D. Bell explained that Palicki and Blood had to leave to film the pilot, and [...] "it didn't make sense" [...] to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> explain their absence for several episodes just to have the pair leave again soon after to begin production {{on the rest of}} Most Wanted if it was picked up to series.|$|E

2500|$|Holby City {{producer}} Simon Harper told Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy that Zosia and Oliver have a [...] "delicious chemistry". He was keen to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> {{play out}} slow paced to create anticipation for their eventual relationship. But {{noted that there}} was a danger viewers could become tired of waiting. He was happy with the success the pairing had already become.

2500|$|Sparks {{encountered}} difficulties; it [...] "just didn't {{seem to come}} together". For Sparks, {{there should}} be an [...] "element that [...] the characters apart in order to have drama". Throughout Sparks' career, he has attempted to not use the same element twice, so it had become harder for him to write each new novel. He comments, [...] "If I don't have the 'conflict', I don't <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> and for the life of me, I couldn't come up with something new to keep the characters apart.... I also wanted to write a story using older characters, again because it's something I haven't done (with the exception of The Notebook, in which they're elderly, not middle-aged)." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} story {{concept was}} written by Hashino. The initial concept was for a storyline that diverged from the established paths of Persona 3 and Persona 4, with [...] "self-discovery" [...] and [...] "journey" [...] being its keywords. Originally using the frame story of a backpacking trip around the world, Hashino decided to refocus on Japan {{in the wake of}} the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake. Following that, and seeing the way people were bonding in the face of the crisis, Hashino decided to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> take place solely in Japan, with the journeying being through the ever-shifting Palace. According to Hashino, the central theme of the game is freedom and how the characters attain it. He wanted to make the game more [...] "thematically approachable" [...] for newcomers to the series, and to be an emotional experience that presents players with a mix of emotions that leaves its audience with a strong sense of catharsis and the inspiration to take on their own modern-day problems.|$|E
