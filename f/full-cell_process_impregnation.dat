In this research, two moisture contents (MC) (0 and 25 %) were used to study the effect of MC on the nanomaterial retention and distribution in cottonwood (Populus deltoides) sapwood treated with nano-titanium dioxide. The wood samples were impregnated by a <b>full-cell</b> <b>process</b> at three levels of nano&# 8208;TiO 2 concentration: 0, 5; 1 and 1, 5 %. The nanomaterial retention was calculated and SEM images were used to investigate the distribution of nanoparticles in the wood. The results showed that increasing the nano-TiO 2 concentration caused more retention and the MC difference caused almost identical retention at 0, 5 and 1 % concentrations. Although the retention in the 0 % MC samples was slightly more than those of 25 % MC, this retention was significantly more in these samples (0 % MC) at 1, 5 % concentration. SEM images indicated that the nanoparticles had more uniform distribution in the 0 % MC samples than the 25 % MC ones and the difference was clearly visible at 1, 5 % concentration.

40|$|The {{manufacturing}} process of high voltage power transformers consists of several phases such as design, assembly, drying and <b>impregnation</b> <b>process</b> which are time consuming. Before electrical testing, a transformer needs an extra standing time for further impregnation of cellulose material in particular those of high density. It {{should be noted}} that the duration of the standing time depends on the ratings of the transformer. The main reason for considering this standing time is to reduce the probability of failure during electrical testing. This means that the reduction of such standing time is a crucial issue. Therefore, the main goal of this thesis is to optimize the post <b>impregnation</b> <b>process</b> of high density cellulosic material. One of the requirements for shortening the post impregnation standing time is that during the electrical tests of the transformer the PD level should not exceed the PD acceptance given by IEC standard level. In this thesis, it is investigated if the standing time is related to the occurrence of partial discharges in high density materials. This is done by performing a number of partial discharge measurement on different samples.
