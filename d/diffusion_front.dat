50|$|Several {{different}} {{theories have}} been proposed to explain the formation of Liesegang rings. The chemist Wilhelm Ostwald in 1897 proposed a theory {{based on the idea}} that a precipitate is not formed immediately upon the concentration of the ions exceeding a solubility product, but a region of supersaturation occurs first. When the limit of stability of the supersaturation is reached, the precipitate forms, and a clear region forms ahead of the <b>diffusion</b> <b>front</b> because the precipitate that is below the solubility limit diffuses onto the precipitate. This was argued to be a critically flawed theory when it was shown that seeding the gel with a colloidal dispersion of the precipitate (which would arguably prevent any significant region of supersaturation) did not prevent the formation of the rings.|$|E

It is a poor conductor and can cause electrical failure of the joint {{that can lead to}} mechanical failure. At lower temperatures, about 400 - 450°C, an interdiffusion process takes place at the junction. This leads to formation of layers of several intermetallic compounds with different compositions, from gold-rich to aluminium-rich, with different growth rates. Cavities form as the denser, faster-growing layers consume the slower-growing ones. This process, known as Kirkendall voiding, leads to both increased electrical resistance and mechanical weakening of the wire bond. When the voids are collected along the <b>diffusion</b> <b>front,</b> a process aided by contaminants present in the lattice, it is known as Horsting voiding, a process similar to and often confused with Kirkendall voiding.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the dynamics of}} the disordered trap model, which is known to be completely out-of-equilibrium and to present strong localization effects in its aging phase. We are interested into the influence of an external force, when it is applied from the very beginning at $t= 0 $, or only after a waiting time $t_w$. We obtain a "non-linear Fluctuation Theorem" for the corresponding one-time and two-time <b>diffusion</b> <b>fronts</b> in any given sample, that implies the following consequences : (i) for fixed times, there exists a linear response regime, where the Fluctuation-Dissipation Relation or Einstein relation is valid even in the aging time sector, in contrast with other aging disordered systems; (ii) for a fixed waiting time and fixed external field, the validity of the linear response regime is limited in time by a characteristic time depending on the external force; (iii) in the non-linear response regime, there exists a very simple relation for the asymmetry in the position for the one-time and the two-times disorder averaged <b>diffusion</b> <b>fronts</b> in the presence of an external force, in contrast to other models of random walks in random media. The present non-linear Fluctuation Theorem is a consequence of a special dynamical symmetry of the trap model. Comment: 9 pages, no figur...|$|R
40|$|The pair {{of large}} radio lobes in the Virgo cluster, each about 23 kpc in radius, have curiously sharp outer edges where the radio-synchrotron {{continuum}} flux declines abruptly. However, just adjacent to this sharp transition, the radio flux increases. This radio limb-brightening is observed over {{at least half}} of the perimeter of both lobes. We describe slowly propagating steady state <b>diffusion</b> <b>fronts</b> that explain these counterintuitive features. Because of the natural buoyancy of radio lobes, the magnetic field is largely tangent to the lobe boundary, an alignment that polarizes the radio emission and dramatically reduces the diffusion coefficient of relativistic electrons. As cosmic ray electrons diffuse slowly into the cluster gas, the local magnetic field and gas density are reduced as gas flows back toward the radio lobe. Radio emission peaks can occur because the synchrotron emissivity increases with magnetic field and then decreases with the density of non-thermal electrons. A detailed comparison of steady <b>diffusion</b> <b>fronts</b> with quantitative radio observations may reveal information about the spatial variation of magnetic fields and the diffusion coefficient of relativistic electrons. On larger scales, some reduction of the gas density inside the Virgo lobes due to cosmic ray pressure must occur and may be measurable. Such X-ray observations could reveal important information about the presence of otherwise unobservable non-thermal components such as relativistic electrons of low energy or proton cosmic rays.

40|$|Basic {{physical}} {{concepts of}} diffusion, convection, and dispersion pertaining to gas transport {{in the human}} airways are reviewed. Their incorporation into quantitative models of gas mixing is presented, also illustrating the crucial interaction of gas transport equations with the model geometry. Model simulations are confronted with the available experimental gas mixing indices such as the phase III slope obtained in normal human lungs, with some pertinent examples in laboratory animals and in human lung disease. The use of inert gases with differing diffusion coefficients and their associated phase III slope provides invaluable experimental information on gas mixing in the lungs, {{with the concept of}} the <b>diffusion</b> <b>front</b> playing a central role. Sources of inter- and intraregional ventilation heterogeneity can be related to the location of the <b>diffusion</b> <b>front,</b> which offers the possibility to distinguish between ventilation heterogeneity proximal to the <b>diffusion</b> <b>front</b> (driven by convection between lung units larger than acini) and more peripheral ventilation heterogeneity (driven by diffusion-convection interaction mainly within the acinus).

The remaining hiatus in our understanding of ventilation heterogeneity in the human lung is described, together with some potential perspectives for its investigation. © 2011 American Physiological Society.

40|$|Abstract. We propose an {{alternative}} model of diffusion in polymers, {{which may explain}} formation of propagating sharp diffusion fronts to be observed in some experiments. Differently from typical Case II or Stefan problem models, plasticisation of the polymer matrix is not necessarily required. Instead, diffusing small molecules {{are assumed to be}} captured by some specific sites of the polymer matrix for certain retention times. For example, they may become adsorbed at the surface of the holes and microvoids that are considered to be present in glassy polymer regions according to the well-known dual-sorption model and are attributed to excess free volume frozen into the glassy matrix. On the other hand, the small molecules may become bound to polymer chains. In this adsorbed/bound state they have much smaller movability and thus are effectively excluded from the diffusion. This adsorption/binding {{is considered to be a}} reversible process of state changing, but with asymmetric probabilities for direct and reverse events. With this assumption, taking into account that the amount of space available for such immobilised molecules is limited (limited free volume, limited number of anchoring sites) the model naturally results in the formation of sharp diffusion fronts or strong concentration gradients. Such a <b>diffusion</b> <b>front</b> is a region of effective immobilisation (adsorption/binding, though reversible) of the free diffusing molecules. For the simplest prescribed boundary conditions the <b>diffusion</b> <b>front</b> propagates linearly with the square root of time. By means of imposing generalised boundary conditions, it is possible to model other regimes of propagation of the <b>diffusion</b> <b>front,</b> including constant velocity. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A novel {{approach}} to noninvasively tracing brain white matter fiber tracts is presented using diffusion tensor {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (DT-MRI). This technique is based on successive anisotropic diffusion simulations over the human brain, which are utilized to construct three dimensional <b>diffusion</b> <b>fronts.</b> The fiber pathways are determined by evaluating the distance and orientation from the fronts to their corresponding diffusion seeds. Synthetic and real DT-MRI data are employed to demonstrate the tracking scheme. It is shown that the synthetic tracts are accurately replicated, and several major white matter fiber pathways can be reproduced noninvasively, with the tract branching being allowed. Since simulating the diffusion process, which is truly a physical phenomenon reflecting the underlying architecture of cerebral tissues, makes full use of the diffusion tensor data, including both the magnitude and orientation information, the proposed approach is expected to enhance robustness and reliability in white matter fiber reconstruction.

40|$|The {{self-assembly}} of nanoscopic {{building blocks}} into higher order macroscopic patterns is one possible approach for the bottom-up fabrication of complex functional systems.

In systems where the distribution of the interaction-determining species is influenced by the presence of a diffusion barrier, the evolving macroscopic patterns will be determined by the spatiotemporal evolution of the building blocks.

This can be attributed to lower signals from the <b>diffusion</b> <b>fronts</b> in near-surface environments because measurements are made long after the drilling of the well, when concentration fronts are already disappearing. Proportionally higher signals arise from streaming potentials that prevent using simple interpretation models that assume signals from diffusion only.

Perturbations are applied either by changing the concentration of the borehole-filling solution or its column height.
