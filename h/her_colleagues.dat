5|$|The {{character}} has been criticised by police detectives {{who felt that}} Marsden's habit of discussing investigation details with suspects (as <b>her</b> <b>colleagues</b> accepted bribes) did not properly represent their profession. In response, the BBC said it had sought advice from a police consultant for storylines involving Marsden.|$|E
5|$|With <b>her</b> <b>colleagues,</b> she {{clarified}} {{the taxonomy}} of Indonesian white-eyes, establishing the specific {{status of the}} Sangihe white-eye Zosterops nehrkorni and the Seram white-eye Z. stalkeri and confirmed {{the identity of the}} Serendib scops owl which had originally been discovered in Sri Lanka by local ornithologist Deepal Warakagoda.|$|E
5|$|In 1932 Emmy Noether and Emil Artin {{received}} the Ackermann–Teubner Memorial Award {{for their contributions}} to mathematics. The prize carried a monetary reward of 500Reichsmarks and {{was seen as a}} long-overdue official recognition of her considerable work in the field. Nevertheless, <b>her</b> <b>colleagues</b> expressed frustration at {{the fact that she was}} not elected to the Göttingen Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften (academy of sciences) and was never promoted to the position of Ordentlicher Professor (full professor).|$|E

50|$|Following the assault, the men {{brought her}} back to the place where <b>her</b> <b>colleague</b> was being held. They {{accompanied}} the survivor and <b>her</b> <b>colleague</b> to the railway tracks around 7:15 pm, where they were told to stay. When the criminals left, she informed <b>her</b> <b>colleague</b> that she had been raped six times by the five men and needed medical treatment. On reaching the Mahalaxmi station, <b>her</b> <b>colleague</b> contacted their boss and asked him to come. They went by taxi to Jaslok Hospital at Peddar Road. The victim called her mother and told her to meet her at the hospital. The survivor was bleeding profusely when she arrived at the hospital. She was immediately admitted and began undergoing medical treatment. She gave her statement to police on 26 August, and was discharged on the night of 27 August.|$|R

5|$|In this episode, Megan (Dana Delany) {{is shocked}} after {{the victim in}} a {{shooting}} is a previous patient {{when she was a}} neurosurgeon; however she only remembers the procedure of the woman. Detective Morris (John Carroll Lynch) and Detective Baker (Sonja Sohn) lead the case, interviewing many leads from the crime scene, which results in finding the unexpected killer. Meanwhile; Megan tries to build a better relationship with <b>her</b> <b>colleagues.</b>|$|E
5|$|Research by Jennifer A. Clack and <b>her</b> <b>colleagues</b> {{showed that}} the very {{earliest}} tetrapods, animals similar to Acanthostega, were wholly aquatic and quite unsuited to life on land. This {{is in contrast to}} the earlier view that fish had first invaded the land — either in search of prey (like modern mudskippers) or to find water when the pond they lived in dried out — and later evolved legs, lungs, etc.|$|E
5|$|The protein-only {{hypothesis}} {{has been}} criticised by those maintaining that the simplest {{explanation of the}} evidence to date is viral. For more than a decade, Yale University neuropathologist Laura Manuelidis has been proposing that prion diseases are caused instead by an unidentified slow virus. In January 2007, she and <b>her</b> <b>colleagues</b> published an article reporting {{to have found a}} virus in 10%, or less, of their scrapie-infected cells in culture.|$|E

5|$|Torres was {{initially}} {{conceived as a}} love interest, and eventual wife, for O'Malley, and was created to be disliked by <b>her</b> <b>colleagues.</b> Further storylines include relationships between her and plastic surgeon, Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), cardiothoracic surgeon Erica Hahn (Brooke Smith), {{as well as a}} marriage to pediatric surgeon Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw). The character's bisexual storyline with Hahn and Robbins, and her development later in the series has garnered much acclaim.|$|E
5|$|After the {{discovery}} of a natural circularly permuted protein, researchers looked for a way to emulate this process. In 1983, David Goldenberg and Thomas Creighton were able to create a circularly permuted version of a protein by chemically ligating the termini to create a cyclic protein, then introducing new termini elsewhere using trypsin. In 1989, Karolin Luger and <b>her</b> <b>colleagues</b> introduced a genetic method for making circular permutations by carefully fragmenting and ligating DNA. This method allowed for permutations to be introduced at arbitrary sites.|$|E
5|$|During production, {{the actress}} playing {{the leader of}} the factory workers, Yōko Yaguchi, was chosen by <b>her</b> <b>colleagues</b> to present their demands to the director. She and Kurosawa were {{constantly}} at loggerheads, and it was through these arguments that the two, paradoxically, became close. They married on May 21, 1945, with Yaguchi two months pregnant (she never resumed her acting career), and the couple would remain together until her death in 1985. They would have two children: a son, Hisao, born December 20, 1945, who would serve as producer on some of his father's last projects, and Kazuko, a daughter, born April 29, 1954, who would become a costume designer.|$|E

5|$|In {{the period}} between 1918 and 1928, the WFL in Swansea {{produced}} two prominent activists in Emily Frost Phipps and her close friend Clara Neal, who were founder members of their branch. Phipps and Neal were teachers and activists, both serving {{as president of the}} National Union of Women Teachers and used that platform to press for equal franchise. Phipps also used her position as editor of the Woman Teacher to urge <b>her</b> <b>colleagues</b> to support public meetings and demonstrations.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{reports said}} that she had been killed by an {{explosion}} set off by one of her captors. A joint official investigation by the United Kingdom and the United States later concluded that her fatal injuries were inflicted by a grenade thrown by one of her rescuers. A February 2011 coroner's narrative verdict reported that Norgrove died during the failed rescue attempt. In October 2012, one of <b>her</b> <b>colleagues</b> {{said in an interview that}} the captors had told Norgrove that they had no intention of killing her.|$|E
5|$|Inseminoid (titled Horror Planet in the United States) is a 1981 British-Hong Kong science-fiction {{exploitation}} horror film. Director Norman J. Warren's eighth film, {{the plot}} of Inseminoid concerns a group of future scientists excavating the ruins of an ancient civilisation on a distant planet. When a monstrous alien creature attacks and inseminates {{one of the women}} in the team, chaos ensues as the unbalanced victim, possessing unnatural strength, murders <b>her</b> <b>colleagues</b> one after another in a psychotic bid to protect her unborn twin hybrid offspring. It stars Judy Geeson, Robin Clarke, and Stephanie Beacham. Victoria Tennant makes an early film appearance.|$|E

At school, Kate is questioned by a curious student as to why she is not gaining weight. She subsequently feigns a miscarriage and her students accuse her of killing her baby, for which she reprimands them.|$|E
5|$|The Settlement Movement (creating {{integrated}} mixed {{communities of}} rich and poor) grew {{directly out of}} Hill's work. <b>Her</b> <b>colleagues</b> Samuel and Henrietta Barnett, founded Toynbee Hall, the first university-sponsored settlement, which together with the Women's University Settlement (later called the Blackfriars Settlement) continues to serve local communities. Overseas, Hill's name is perpetuated in the Octavia Hill Association in Philadelphia, a small property company founded in 1896 to provide affordable housing to low and middle-income city residents.|$|E
5|$|The helmet was too fragile to be {{excavated}} in situ so it {{was removed}} within a block of earth held together with plaster of Paris. It {{was taken to the}} British Museum in London for conservation, which took nine years of work by conservator Marilyn Hockey and <b>her</b> <b>colleagues</b> Fleur Shearman and Duygu Çamurcuoğlu. Corrosion and the effects of time had shattered the helmet into thousands of pieces, most of which were smaller than the nail on a person's little finger. The reconstructed and conserved helmet was unveiled in January 2012.|$|E

5|$|Donna Jackson is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the BBC medical drama Holby City, played by actress Jaye Jacobs. She {{appeared in the}} programme from its sixth series in 2004, to its thirteenth in 2011, and from its nineteenth in 2017. Donna entered the series as a staff nurse, characterised as a wild-child with a chaotic personal life. During her tenure, she grew to take her work more seriously, becoming a ward sister and accepting more personal responsibilities by adopting her half-niece Mia (Jada Wallace-Mitchell). A tart with a heart character, Donna had many romantic liaisons with <b>her</b> <b>colleagues,</b> including a one-night stand with midwife Mickie Hendrie (Kelly Adams). She ultimately {{fell in love with}} agency nurse Keiran Callaghan (Barry Sloane), and departed to be with him after he was injured in Afghanistan as part of the Territorial Army.|$|E
5|$|During this time, Stanton {{maintained}} a broad focus on women's rights in general rather than narrowing her focus only to female suffrage in particular. After {{passage of the}} Fifteenth Amendment in 1870 and its support by the Equal Rights Association and prominent suffragists such as Stone, Blackwell, and Howe, the gap between Elizabeth Cady Stanton and other leaders of the women's movement widened as Stanton took issue with the fundamental religious leanings of several movement leaders. Unlike many of <b>her</b> <b>colleagues,</b> Stanton believed organized Christianity relegated women to an unacceptable position in society. She explored this view in the 1890s in The Woman's Bible, which elucidated a feminist understanding of biblical scripture and sought to correct the fundamental sexism Stanton believed was inherent to organized Christianity. Likewise, Stanton supported divorce rights, employment rights, and property rights for women, issues in which the American Women's Suffrage Association (AWSA) preferred not to become involved.|$|E
5|$|From 1930 to 1934, Wu {{studied at}} the National Central University (later renamed Nanjing University and {{reinstated}} in Taiwan), first in mathematics, but later transferring to physics. She became involved in student politics. Relations between China and Japan were tense at this time, and students were urging the government to take a stronger line with Japan. Wu was elected {{as one of the}} student leaders by <b>her</b> <b>colleagues</b> because they felt that since {{she was one of the}} top students at the university, her involvement would be forgiven, or at least overlooked, by the authorities. That being the case, she was careful not to neglect her studies. She led protests that included a sit-in at the Presidential Palace in Nanjing, where the students were met by Chiang Kai-shek.|$|E
