5|$|After moving in, Moon began a {{prescribed}} course of Heminevrin (clomethiazole, a sedative) to alleviate his alcohol withdrawal symptoms. He {{wanted to get}} sober, but due to his fear of psychiatric hospitals {{he wanted to do}} it at home. Clomethiazole is discouraged for unsupervised detoxification because of its addictive potential, its tendency to induce tolerance, and its risk of death when mixed with alcohol. The pills were prescribed by Geoffrey Dymond, a physician who was unaware of Moon's lifestyle. Dymond prescribed a bottle of 100 pills, instructing him to take one pill when <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> craving for alcohol but not more than three pills per day.|$|E
5|$|Cameron's {{inspiration}} for the film came from his fascination with shipwrecks; <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> love story interspersed with the human loss would be essential to convey the emotional impact of the disaster. Production began in 1995, when Cameron shot footage of the actual Titanic wreck. The modern scenes on the research vessel were shot on board the Akademik Mstislav Keldysh, which Cameron had used as a base when filming the wreck. Scale models, computer-generated imagery, and a reconstruction of the Titanic built at Playas de Rosarito in Baja California were used to re-create the sinking. The film was partially funded by Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox. It was the most expensive film ever made at the time, with a production budget of $200million.|$|E
5|$|Fincher {{realized}} that {{his job was to}} dispel the mythic stature the case had taken on over the years by clearly defining what was fact and what was fiction. He told Vanderbilt that he wanted the screenplay re-written but with additional research done from the original police reports. Fincher found {{that there was a lot}} of speculation and hearsay and wanted to interview people directly involved in the case in person to see if he believed what they were telling him. Fincher did this because <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> burden of responsibility in making a film that convicted someone posthumously.|$|E
60|$|They went downstairs, and Hodder {{took his}} leave, {{although}} <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> odd reluctance to go. Mr. Parr rang the bell.|$|R
60|$|The {{professor}} {{crossed the}} street. Tavernake watched {{him until he}} was out of sight. Then <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> arm thrust through his.|$|R
6000|$|... "Give me this revolver," [...] said Willems, in <b>a</b> {{peremptory}} tone. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> {{unwillingness to}} close with her, {{to get it}} by force.|$|R
5|$|Kirk takes {{command of}} the ship citing his experience, angering Captain Willard Decker, who had been {{overseeing}} the refit as its new commanding officer. Testing of Enterprises new systems goes poorly; two officers, including the Vulcan Enterprise science officer Sonak, are killed by a malfunctioning transporter, and improperly calibrated engines almost destroy the ship. Kirk's unfamiliarity with the new systems of the Enterprise increases the tension between him and first officer Decker. Commander Spock arrives as a replacement science officer, explaining that while on his home world undergoing a ritual to purge all emotion, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> consciousness that he believes emanates from the cloud.|$|E
5|$|Belgrano {{met with}} the Congress of Tucuman on 6 July 1816 to explain {{the results of his}} {{diplomatic}} mission in Europe. He thought that enacting a local monarchy would help to prevent anarchy, which would not end simply with independence from Spain. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> declaration of independence would be more easily accepted by the European powers if it created a monarchic system. To this end he formulated the Inca Plan: a monarchy ruled by a noble of the Inca civilisation. He thought that this would generate support from the indigenous populations as well, and repair the actions taken against the Inca by the Spanish colonisation. This proposal was supported by San Martín, Güemes, the deputies from the Upper Peru, and other provinces, but it found a strong rejection from Buenos Aires; they would not accept Cuzco as the capital city. On 9 July the Congress finally signed the Declaration of Independence from Spain. The flag created by Belgrano, which was being used without a law regulating it, was accepted as the national flag. The Inca Plan was still under discussion, but the Congress delayed it due to several states of emergency in the provinces caused by the war.|$|E
5|$|His {{first and}} only major league {{appearance}} came against the Milwaukee Brewers on 17 September 1982. The first two batters he faced were Paul Molitor and Robin Yount, both future Hall of Famers, {{one of only a}} few players in history to do so. Partway through the first inning, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> twinge in his shoulder; not wanting to leave his first game early, he pitched through it, and allowed five runs in the first. Partway through the third, after three more runs allowed, Wever was taken out of the game. He pitched for 2⅔ innings and had eight earned runs, two strikeouts, and three wild pitches. Entering the 1983 season, Wever was projected to be the fifth starter in the Yankees' starting rotation. Because of continued pain in his shoulder, he instead spent the season with the AAA Columbus Clippers, where he went 14 with a 9.78 ERA in seven appearances.|$|E
50|$|Some {{critics have}} {{suggested}} that Andersen wrote the story {{as a form of}} indirect revenge against Edvard Collin, for whom <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> unrequited love.|$|R
60|$|The {{question}} gave Alan an annoyance {{out of all}} {{proportion to}} its significance. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> instinctive reluctance to discuss Lynde Oliver with Isabel King.|$|R
50|$|During his dissolute {{adolescence}} <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> increasingly growing inner emptiness, {{which led}} him on an intense spiritual search and, eventually, to meeting his spiritual teacher.|$|R
5|$|Posehn had a {{difficult}} time working within the Genesis's output resolution of 320×240. He wanted to show as much of the playing field as possible without losing the details of the sprites; <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> lack of graphical detail would make them less interesting. Posehn developed a dynamic camera system to help maintain what he felt was the right balance between the size of the field in view {{and the size of the}} game objects. The camera travels on an elliptic curve as the helicopter rotates to change the direction it travels; this puts whatever is in front of the helicopter more in view on screen. Posehn also integrated momentum to the camera movements to smooth transitions. He spent several months working on the physics for the screen and helicopter to ensure realistic movement. Instead of using completely accurate physics, Posehn chose to model movement that he believed players would assume a helicopter would have. He believed players would be put off by physics that didn't match their perceived movement.|$|E
5|$|The defence next {{engaged in}} a lengthy direct {{examination}} of Eichmann. Observers such as Moshe Pearlman and Hannah Arendt have remarked on Eichmann's ordinariness in appearance and flat affect. In his testimony throughout the trial, Eichmann insisted {{he had no choice}} but to follow orders, as he was bound by an oath of loyalty—the same superior orders defence used by some defendants in the 1945–1946 Nuremberg trials. Eichmann asserted that the decisions had been made not by him, but by Müller, Heydrich, Himmler, and ultimately Hitler. Servatius also proposed that decisions of the Nazi government were acts of state and therefore not subject to normal judicial proceedings. Regarding the Wannsee Conference, Eichmann stated that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> sense of satisfaction and relief at its conclusion. As a clear decision to exterminate had been made by his superiors, the matter was out of his hands; he felt absolved of any guilt. On the last day of the examination, he stated that he was guilty of arranging the transports, but he did not feel guilty for the consequences.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{concept for}} Odin Sphere {{was of a}} story {{revolving}} around a Valkyrie princess, inspired by Kamitani's wish to emulate the protagonist of Princess Crown and hearing at second hand about planning at tri-Ace for , which involved Norse mythology and featured a princess as its main protagonist. Kamitani's Valkyrie protagonist, who would become Gwyndolin, was created {{before the rest of}} the game's world and story were finalized. Working from this initial idea and its roots in Norse mythology, Kamitani began writing a romantic storyline for Gwyndolin and Oswald as the central narrative, basing it on Der Ring des Nibelungen by Richard Wagner. He then added further elements inspired by the works of William Shakespeare and traditional European fairy tales. The other narratives focused on different themes: Mercedes' storyline focused on her maturation into a queen, Velvet's story focused on resolving a mystery, while Cornelius' story narrative modeled after traditional fairy tales as a homage to the early PC game Marchen Veil. As with his other projects, Kamitani included strong female characters, as <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> woman pushed into summoning the courage to fight deserved victory. There were plans to create backstory elements for characters like Odin and an extra book focusing on Ingway, but the negative impact those elements would have resulted in them being cut.|$|E
60|$|The doctor {{recovered}} himself, but {{it required}} quite an effort {{for him to}} find his voice. All his irritation was gone, and <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> -- <i eh bien, oui, je ne le nie pas> -- <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> overwhelming pity.|$|R
2500|$|Tetsuro Araki, the {{director}} of the anime, said that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> urge to support and cheer for Light. Araki added that Light would have used and killed him if he was one of Light's friends, but {{the director}} still believed that Light is [...] "that interesting" [...] and therefore <b>he</b> would have <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> attraction towards Light.|$|R
60|$|Kirk {{leaned on}} the rail, looking with dull eyes on the city he had left a year before. Only a year! It seemed ten. As he stood there <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> old man.|$|R
25|$|By the mid-1980s, Woo was {{experiencing}} occupational burnout. Several {{of his films}} were commercial disappointments, and <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> distinct lack of creative control. It was {{during this period of}} self-imposed exile that director/producer Tsui Hark provided the funding for Woo to film a longtime pet project, A Better Tomorrow (1986).|$|E
25|$|Though Deakin {{always took}} pains to obscure the spiritual {{dimensions}} of his character from public gaze, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> strong sense of providence and destiny working in his career. Like Dag Hammarskjöld much later, Deakin's sincere longing for spiritual fulfillment led him to express a sense of unworthiness in his private diaries, which mingled with his literary aspirations as a poet.|$|E
25|$|On 23 December 2001, {{during his}} annual {{birthday}} meeting with reporters, the Emperor, {{in response to}} a reporter's question about tensions with Korea, remarked that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> kinship with Koreans and went on to explain that, in the Shoku Nihongi, the mother of Emperor Kammu (736–806) is related to Muryeong of Korea, King of Baekje, a fact that was considered taboo.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let 'er go," [...] said Bill, {{splitting}} a straw {{with his}} knife. He had not proposed to Sarah before and <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> unusual exaltation {{to think it}} came so easy after all.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> {{extraordinary}} {{doubt whether}} he would get into the way of it. He was interested for a space by a girl and groom on horseback, {{and then he came}} back to his personal preoccupations.|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} <b>he</b> hesitated. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> {{extraordinary}} impulse to throw everything {{on one side}} and accept her invitation. The crisis passed, however, before he could yield. Marcia, with a little laugh, became her normal self.|$|R
25|$|Ten {{days before}} the attack on Georgi Markov, Bulgarian defector, Vladimir Kostov survived an attack {{similar to the one}} against Markov. Kostov was {{standing}} on an escalator of the Paris metro when <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> sting in his lower back above the belt of his trousers. He developed a fever, but recovered. After Markov's death the wound on Kostov's back was examined and a ricin-laced pellet identical to the one used against Markov was removed.|$|E
25|$|In 1971–72 Lloyd {{suffered}} {{a back injury}} while playing for a Rest of the World team at the Adelaide Oval. He was fielding in the covers when Ashley Mallett hit a lofted drive towards his area. He made an amazing effort to take the catch but it bounced {{out of his hands}} when he hit the ground awkwardly. When he went to get up, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> stabbing pain in his back and he was unable to move. He spent the next few weeks in an Adelaide hospital flat on his back.|$|E
25|$|Palmer and {{his patient}} Harvey Lillard gave differing {{accounts}} of {{when and how}} Palmer began to experiment with spinal manipulation. Palmer recalled an incident in 1895 when he was investigating the medical history of a partially deaf man, Harvey Lillard. Lillard informed Palmer that while working in a cramped area seventeen years earlier, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> 'pop' in his back, and had been nearly deaf ever since. Palmer’s examination found a sore lump which he believed was a spinal misalignment and a possible cause of Lillard's poor hearing. Palmer claimed to have corrected the misalignment and that Lillard's hearing improved.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Arbuton neither {{perceived}} nor heeded the pun. He {{was looking}} {{in a sort}} of rapture at the name which his own hand had written now for the first time, and <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> indecorous desire to kiss it.|$|R
50|$|In July 2013, former Pentagon lawyer Jeh Johnson said, {{on a panel}} at the Aspen Institute's Security Forum, that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> {{emotional}} reaction upon reading Nasser al-Awlaki's {{account of}} how his 16-year-old grandson {{was killed by a}} U.S. drone.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> {{extraordinary}} persuasion of {{the scent}} of roses. So strong did it seem that he glanced outside the room door, expecting to find a box there, mysteriously arrived. But there was no scent of roses in the passage.|$|R
25|$|On {{his deathbed}} Malevich had been {{exhibited}} with the Black Square above him, and mourners {{at his funeral}} rally were permitted to wave a banner bearing a black square. Malevich had asked to be buried under an oak tree {{on the outskirts of}} Nemchinovka, a place to which <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> special bond. His ashes were sent to Nemchinovka, and buried in a field near his dacha. Nikolai Suetin, a friend of Malevich’s and a fellow artist, designed a white cube with a black square to mark the burial site. The memorial was destroyed during World War II. The city of Leningrad bestowed a pension on Malevich's mother and daughter.|$|E
25|$|The decisive {{pressure}} {{for a compromise}} solution on the Japanese side came from the Shōwa Emperor, who {{made it clear that}} he was displeased with the prospect of a war with Britain while the war with China was still unresolved and Japan on the brink of an all-out war with the Soviet Union. Additionally, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> war with Britain would push Japan too much into the embrace of Germany to the latter's advantage. Since he was worshipped as a living god by the Japanese people, the knowledge of his unhappiness about the Tientsin crisis was a powerful force for a peaceful resolution of the crisis within the halls of power in Japan.|$|E
25|$|From {{that point}} on {{he took over the}} story. He told us that {{in the early part of}} his career he had taken special {{training}} on spotting and tracing torpedo wakes and that was one of the reasons <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> little safer when he was on the bridge in treacherous waters. As a result of his early training he was the first one to see the wakes of the two torpedoes coming from the port side. Both torpedoes went between the Helena and the San Francisco and when both ships turned, the torpedoes went past us and one of them hit the Juneau. We were not able to warn the Juneau in time to save her.|$|E
60|$|When Bladud {{came forward}} he was {{suddenly}} struck motionless and glared {{as if he had}} seen a ghost. For {{the first time in his}} life <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> emotion of supernatural fear--for there, in the flesh apparently, stood his friend Dromas.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{the next}} time I have you by the collar I won't let go, either," [...] said the painter; but <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> {{inadequacy}} in his threat, and he imagined a superfluity, and he made some haste to ask: [...] "who are they?" ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> irrepressible {{attraction}} to journalism. In 1902, accompanied by maestro Ramon I. Cardozo founded in Villa Rica newspaper [...] "El Libre" [...] {{in which he}} published his grammar lessons. In 1903, he created another called [...] "The Guairá" [...] of short existence.|$|R
