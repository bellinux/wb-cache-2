5|$|The crisis flared again {{two years}} later when the Canadian {{military}} called for overseas reinforcements. Ralston wanted King to impose conscription, but at Macdonald's urging, seemed willing to compromise by going along with the prime minister's plan for one last voluntary recruitment campaign. King however, suddenly dismissed Ralston during a cabinet meeting on November 1, 1944. Macdonald considered resigning, but said later he would have struck King if he had risen to leave. Instead <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair ripping sheets of notepaper into small shreds and dropping them on the floor. Stephen Henderson writes that Macdonald's decision not to resign probably saved the King government. King himself seemed to recognize that if Macdonald had left, Ilsley would have resigned too, possibly taking other ministers with him and causing the government's collapse.|$|E
5|$|With Zolak {{coming to}} {{the final year of}} his {{contract}} in 1998, <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> usual spot on the depth chart, in between starter Bledsoe and third stringer Tupa. He saw playing time in three games during {{the first three months of}} the season in relief of Bledsoe. His most significant appearance during this time came against the Atlanta Falcons on November 8, 1998, where he completed three of ten passes for 33yards and an interception in a 4110 loss. Near the end of the month, Bledsoe was sidelined with an injury and was questionable for the final November game. Bledsoe played in three more games, but his injury kept him from playing in the final two, giving Zolak his first starting appearance since 1995. Zolak's first start came against the San Francisco 49ers on December 20. He completed 14 of 30 passes for 205yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions and won the game, 2421. He faced the New York Jets the following week, completing 14 of 31 passes for 127yards and a touchdown, but lost the game 3110. Zolak finished the season with his most productive totals since 1992. He played in six games and started two, completed 32 of 75 passes for 371yards, three touchdowns, 3 interceptions, and had a passer rating of 61.8. Zolak's last appearance for the Patriots occurred in the playoffs, as Bledsoe was still injured, against the Jacksonville Jaguars. He completed 21 of 44 passes as the Jaguars eliminated the Patriots from playoff contention in a 2510 loss. He became an unrestricted free agent after the season ended, but was not asked back by the Patriots, ending his tenure there.|$|E
500|$|Dan White's {{arrest and}} trial caused a sensation, and {{illustrated}} severe {{tensions between the}} liberal population and the city police. The San Francisco Police were mostly working-class Irish descendants who intensely disliked the growing gay immigration, {{as well as the}} liberal direction of the city government. After White turned himself in and confessed, <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> cell while his former colleagues on the police force told Harvey Milk jokes; police openly wore [...] "Free Dan White" [...] T-shirts {{in the days after the}} murder. An undersheriff for San Francisco later stated: [...] "The more I observed what went on at the jail, the more I began to stop seeing what Dan White did as the act of an individual and began to see it as a political act in a political movement." [...] White showed no remorse for his actions, and only exhibited vulnerability during an eight-minute call to his mother from jail.|$|E

500|$|Before he left, Carlton plotted to {{kill the}} {{residents}} of Taliesin. His primary target was draftsman Emil Brodelle, who had called Carlton a [...] "black son-of-a-bitch" [...] on August 12 for not following an order. Brodelle and Carlton also engaged in a minor physical confrontation two days later. He planned the assault, targeting the noon hour, when Borthwick, her children, and the studio personnel would be {{on opposite sides of}} the property awaiting lunch. Wright was away in Chicago completing Midway Gardens while Borthwick stayed at home with her two children, 11-year old John and 9-year-old Martha. On August 15, Carlton grabbed a shingling hatchet and began an attack. He started with the Borthwicks, who were waiting on the porch off the living room. Mamah Borthwick was killed by a single blow to the face, and her son John was slaughtered as <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair. Martha managed to flee, but was hunted down and slain in the courtyard. He then coated the bodies in gasoline and lit them on fire, setting the house ablaze.|$|E
500|$|On 8 November 2007 two RIRA members shot an off-duty PSNI officer as <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> car on Bishop Street in Derry, causing {{injuries}} {{to his face}} and arm. On 12 November another PSNI member was shot by RIRA members in Dungannon, County Tyrone. On 7 February 2008, the RIRA stated that, after experiencing a three-year period of reorganisation, it intended to [...] "go back to war" [...] by launching a new offensive against [...] "legitimate targets". It also, despite having apologised for the Omagh bombing, denied any large scale involvement with the attack and said that their part had only gone as far as their codeword being used. On 12 May 2008 the RIRA seriously injured a member of the PSNI when a booby trap bomb exploded underneath his car near Spamount, County Tyrone. On 25 September 2008 the RIRA shot a man in the neck in St Johnston, near the Derry border. The same man was targeted in a pipe bomb attack on his home on 25 October, the RIRA did not claim responsibility for the attack, but security forces believe they were responsible for it.|$|E
2500|$|... 5 September 1995: Tony Kane (aged 29) {{was shot}} dead by the IRA as <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> car in Andersonstown, Belfast. Kane had been named as a drug dealer on posters placed around West Belfast.|$|E

2500|$|... 19 January: the LVF claimed {{responsibility}} for shooting dead Catholic taxi driver Larry Brennan (52) as <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> car on Ormeau Road, Belfast. The attack happened hours after the INLA killed UDA member Jim Guiney, and police believe UDA members were involved.|$|E
2500|$|In 1983, as <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> {{office at}} the university, he heard gunshots {{which turned out to}} be those of IRA killers of Edgar Graham, a friend and fellow law professor.

2500|$|... 23 March: Leslie Jarvis, a {{civilian}} employed at Magilligan Prison, {{was shot dead}} by the IRA as <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> car in a car park outside Magee College of Further Education, Rock Road, Derry. Three masked gunmen approached {{the front of the}} vehicle and fired six shots through the windscreen using a low-velocity rifle. Jarvis {{was shot in the head}} and died instantly.

2500|$|... 7 July: in Aghagallon, the LVF {{shot dead}} Catholic taxi driver Michael McGoldrick (31) while <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> car. The gunmen then set the car alight. This was {{believed}} {{to be related to the}} Drumcree conflict; at the time, the Orange Order was being stopped from marching through the nationalist Garvaghy Road area of Portadown. Members of the group smuggled home-made weaponry to the protests at Drumcree church, apparently unhindered by the Orangemen.|$|E
2500|$|In 1923 Chamberlain {{met with}} Adolf Hitler in Bayreuth and in September <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> {{wheelchair}} next to Hitler during the völkisch [...] "German Day" [...] paramilitary parade.

2500|$|Although the Provisional IRA's General Order No.8 forbids {{military}} action [...] "against 26 County forces {{under any circumstances}} whatsoever", members of the Garda Síochána (the Republic of Ireland's police force) have also been killed, including Detective Garda Jerry McCabe. McCabe was killed by machine-gun fire as <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> patrol car in Adare County Limerick during the escort of a post office delivery in 1996. Sinn Féin has called {{for the release of}} his killers {{under the terms of the}} Good Friday Agreement.

2500|$|On September 10, 2002, in {{the course}} of a bitter custody dispute, Gilbride testified in court that MOVE had {{threatened}} to kill him. On September 27, 2002, shortly after midnight and prior to Gilbride's first visitation date with Zackary, an unknown assailant shot and killed Gilbride with an automatic weapon as <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> car parked outside his home. The case remains unsolved. MOVE initially made statements claiming that the U.S. government had assassinated Gilbride in order to frame MOVE. Alberta Africa denied that the murder had occurred, stating in 2009 that Gilbride [...] "is out hiding somewhere." [...] Tony Allen, an ex-MOVE member, maintains that MOVE murdered Gilbride.|$|E
2500|$|He {{was then}} {{cared for by}} his son George, his daughters, Almena and Mary Susan Gotwald, who {{were living in the}} King Homestead during the time period, and, of course, by his ever-faithful wife Mary Elizabeth for the next five years. The fact that he did recover some of this health is {{evidenced}} by photos taken of him standing and smiling and in the fact that he participated in the founding of the Calvary Lutheran Church in Springfield in 1900—the year of his death. However, he died in Springfield, Ohio later that year on September 15, 1900. As his grandson, Luther A. Gotwald, Sr. reports it, [...] "on [...] evening, as <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair by his desk, he had just asked his wife to open the Bible and read their evening lesson together. Suddenly, as a result of another heart attack, he passed away, painlessly and quietly".|$|E
2500|$|.....while talking or even musing as <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair, he {{commonly}} held {{his head to}} one side towards his right shoulder, and shook it in a tremulous manner, moving his body backwards and forwards, and rubbing his left knee in the same direction, with the palm of his hand. In the intervals of articulating he made various sounds with his mouth; sometimes giving a half whistle, sometimes making his tongue play backwards from the roof of his mouth, as if clucking like a hen, and sometimes protruding it against his upper gums in front, as if pronouncing quickly under his breath, 'Too, too, too.' All this accompanied sometimes with a thoughtful look, but more frequently with a smile. Generally when he had concluded a period, in the course of a dispute, by which time he was a good deal exhausted by violence and vociferation, he used to blow out his breath like a Whale.|$|E
60|$|As she trembled and {{was very}} pale, <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> her <b>in</b> <b>his</b> own chair, and stood beside it with her hand in his; and Martin {{standing}} by him.|$|R
60|$|She sniffed, at that, but {{picked up}} her darning and relapsed into silence. The little man was patient. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> quietly <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair and watched her work.|$|R

2500|$|On Friday, May 3, {{sometime}} before 9 p.m., Virgil Starks, age 37, a farmer and welder, {{was in his}} modest, yet modern ranch-style house on his 500-acre farm off Highway 67 East, almost [...] northeast of Texarkana. He turned on his favorite weekly radio show and his wife, Katie, age 36, gave him a heating pad for his sore back. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> armchair in the sitting room, which was just off {{of the kitchen and}} the bedroom. While Katie was in her bedroom lying on the bed in her nightgown, she heard something from the backyard and asked Virgil to turn down the radio. Seconds later, while Virgil was reading the May 3rd edition of the Texarkana Gazette, two shots were fired into {{the back of his head}} from a closed double-window [...] away. Katie did not hear the gunshots; instead, she heard what [...] "sounded like the breaking of glass". She thought Virgil dropped something and went to see what happened. As she entered the doorway to the living room, she saw Virgil standing up and then suddenly slump back into his chair. She saw blood then ran to him and lifted up his head. When she realized he was dead, she ran to the phone to call police.|$|E
60|$|After supper he {{gathered}} his newspapers to read. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> stocking feet.|$|E

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sat</b> upright <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair and, {{ignoring}} {{the look of}} consternation that passed between husband and wife, poured himself out {{a cup of tea}} and took a slice of cake.|$|R
60|$|Late that night, as <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> gloomily <b>in</b> <b>his</b> brother's library, {{the pipe}} {{in which he}} had sought solace {{extinguished}} between his fingers, there came a sharp knocking at the door.|$|R
