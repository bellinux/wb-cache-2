6000|$|... "Do {{you wish}} me," [...] {{interrupted}} the minister, [...] "to promote {{the establishment of}} this union? <b>Is</b> <b>that</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> speak to me of it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No. You see, I {{thought it}} 'd {{be kind of}} a gloomy thing to see all alone. <b>Is</b> <b>that</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> haven't never been there, too?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{want to be}} sure of it myself." [...] "You <b>are.</b> <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> {{asked me}} if I loved you. Had you not been sure of it you would not have asked." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh indeed, did {{you love}} me?" [...] she cried, indignantly, while the tears shone in her eyes. [...] "And <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> left a {{helpless}} young girl {{to meet that}} trouble alone? Was <b>that</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> refused me your advice, and turned your back on me, and snubbed me? Oh, many thanks for your love!" [...] She dashed the gathered tears angrily away, and went on. [...] "Perhaps you knew, too, what <b>that</b> poor priest <b>was</b> thinking of?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A Mr. Barton. The train <b>was</b> late. <b>That's</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> didn't {{see him at}} dinner. He's only a capitalist--water-power-long-distance-electricity transmitter, or {{something}} like that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Say, Soa," [...] said Leonard, {{when she}} had finished, [...] "you {{did not expect to}} see us come back alive, did you? <b>Is</b> <b>that</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> stayed away?" ...|$|E
6000|$|EILEEN (convinced--with a happy laugh). And <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> acted so strange--and cold? Aren't they {{silly to}} tell you that! As if being happy could hurt me! Why, it's just that, just you I've needed! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dicky," [...] she murmured, {{wiping her}} eyes, [...] "tell me, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> are sitting there, looking {{as though you}} could see right into Heaven? Do {{you know that your}} face was one great beam when I came in?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't leave me! There, I knew it <b>was</b> <b>that.</b> <b>Why</b> don't <b>you</b> want Nurse {{to leave}} you? Do {{you want her}} to be with you every minute?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{were against}} our being married, {{and so they}} {{squeezed}} you out as it <b>were.</b> <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> {{have been sent to}} this place. But they understand me now, and know what I am about. They have all given their consent, and the governor has promised to be liberal. When he says a thing he'll do it. There will be lots of money." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That <b>is</b> it. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> should hate me," [...] she replied, bitterly. [...] "I {{know it is}} robbery, and brigandage, {{although}} my father masks it by saying he sells antiques. Until now I have seen nothing wrong in this life, signorina; but you have made me ashamed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] said Babbie, with a side-glance at the minister, [...] "I am only an Egyptian. <b>Is</b> <b>that</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> dislike me, Mr. Dishart?" [...] Gavin hesitated foolishly {{over his}} answer, and the Egyptian, {{with a towel}} round her waist, made a pretty gesture of despair.|$|E
6000|$|... --And <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> {{will not}} communicate, Cranly asked, {{because you are}} not sure of that too, because {{you feel that the}} host, too, may be the body and blood of the son of God and not a wafer of bread? And because you fear that it may be? ...|$|E
5000|$|Hammer: <b>Is</b> <b>that</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> {{called me}} in here? To shower me with compliments? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Whose fault <b>is</b> <b>that?</b> <b>Why</b> do <b>you</b> not speak? Father Marty, {{what does}} he mean when he tells my girl <b>that</b> there must <b>be</b> {{disappointment}} for her? Does he dare {{to tell me that}} he hesitates to make her his wife?" ...|$|R
60|$|CONJURER. It is the {{simplest}} thing {{there is in}} the world. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> will not laugh.|$|R
60|$|LARRY. I {{expect you}} were a Tory in a former existence; and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> are here.|$|R
5000|$|When Mr.Mr. {{came back}} with the self-titled single, it also bore the same name as Girls' Generation's {{comeback}} mini album Mr.Mr. which was released four days before. This raised suspicions by fans whether or not the boy group were mocking the girl group. Regarding this connection to Girls' Generation, a rep of Mr.Mr told that Asia Economy that the rumours were true. Mr.Mr's new single included lyrics such as: [...] "How could you do that when I'm right here? / Girl, you come out so easily from behind the curtain / Not me, but another mistake, Mr.Mr / I bet you're amused by my embarrassment," [...] and, [...] "I become faint for a main like you / Am I loser and are you a winner? / We're going the same path / I must have looked small from your high perch / <b>Is</b> <b>that</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> did that to me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Cecily. [Sweetly.] I suppose <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> live in town? [Gwendolen bites her lip, and beats {{her foot}} nervously with her parasol.] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Feemy, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you?</b> <b>why</b> don't <b>you</b> come? {{what are}} you here for?" [...] and he put down his hand to raise her. Feemy tried to rise and whisper something, but she was unable, and when Ussher stooped and {{absolutely}} lifted her from her seat, she had really fainted. [...] "Come, Feemy," [...] said he, still unaware of Thady being near, [...] "come; this is nonsense--hurry, there's a love. Come, Feemy, stand, can't you?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "You {{were too}} rich when <b>you</b> had them. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> are sad now. Trouble like that only comes {{where there are}} riches. Be rich no more." ...|$|R
6000|$|He saw light, dazzling, blinding, and {{it scared}} him. He fell back, {{a hand to}} his brow. [...] "And <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> fainted?" [...] he asked incredulously.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{answered}} Rachel, [...] "and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> care {{nothing for}} men as other women do, but dream dreams {{and talk with}} spirits. But what of it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought you}} knew," [...] said McVeigh, {{who had been}} {{regarding}} him curiously. [...] "You, of all men, should have known. I thought <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> were here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> and <b>why</b> did <b>you</b> {{not make}} use of it just now to prevent our being needlessly led farther into these mountains?" [...] asked Fred, in surprise.|$|R
6000|$|... "I believe I pulled some strings in {{a humble}} way. You know you're not really brilliant, Andrew, and I'm afraid you never will <b>be.</b> Perhaps <b>that's</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> can't see the large part we women had in your triumph. Of course, {{you can walk}} a long {{distance}} in snow-shoes and use a pickax; but who led you to think of putting the snow-shoes on?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course. I take it <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> {{came over}} here, because you {{realised}} {{how you were}} wasting your life and wanted a chance of making good in my office." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> {{must not}} take this brave young life, so much simpler and braver than your own, and exalt it--as you can do--and then fail it, as you will do...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{know nothing}} about it," [...] {{observed}} Patsy, demurely, [...] "and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> love to rail at society. The things you know, Daddy dear, are the things you never remark upon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> {{wanted to}} burn the ship! Well, after all, nobody needs me at home, and one less at table won't be missed. So {{you want to play}} Cortez, eh?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'I suppose <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> ate him!' I cried, {{suddenly}} remembering <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> {{this same}} old wretch who had eaten daddy. 'Most likely {{you tried to}} make out <b>that</b> he <b>was</b> a particular friend of yours, and <b>that's</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> did it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are angry}} with her because she cut you," [...] growls Clive. [...] "You know you said she cut you, or forgot you; and your vanity's wounded, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> are so satirical." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I 'm {{very glad}} to hear it, and willingly take your word for it. Everybody shows you their good side, I think, and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> find the world such a {{pleasant}} place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Baas, for {{you good}} night, and for me, what? Baas, you {{think too much}} and {{you have nothing to}} do, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> grow sick. Better that we should go and dig again." ...|$|R
60|$|THE PRINCESS DASHKOFF. God knows, Little Mother, we all implore you to {{give your}} {{wonderful}} brain a rest. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> get headaches. Monsieur Voltaire also has headaches. His brain is just like yours.|$|R
