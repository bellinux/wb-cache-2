5000|$|The German {{legal system}} is a civil law mostly based on a {{comprehensive}} compendium of statutes, {{as compared to the}} common law systems. The Bundesverfassungsgericht (Federal Constitutional Court, being located in the city of Karlsruhe) is the German supreme court responsible for constitutional matters, with power of judicial review. Germany's supreme court system, called Oberste Gerichtshöfe des Bundes ("Supreme Federal Courts of Justice"), is specialised: for civil and criminal cases, the highest court of appeal is the inquisitorial Federal Court of Justice ("Bundesgerichtshof" [...] in Karlsruhe) and for other affairs the courts are the Federal Labour Court ("Bundesarbeitsgericht" [...] in Erfurt), the Federal Social Court ("Bundessozialgericht" [...] in Kassel), the <b>Federal</b> <b>Finance</b> <b>Court</b> ("Bundesfinanzhof" [...] in Munich) and the Federal Administrative Court ("Bundesverwaltungsgericht" [...] in Leipzig). The Völkerstrafgesetzbuch (International Penal Law Code) regulates the consequences of crimes against humanity, genocide and war crimes, and gives German courts universal jurisdiction under specific circumstances.|$|E

In 1993-94 {{it caused}} a {{political}} {{debate in the}} Bundestag over its non-profit status as a revisionistic right-wing extremist association and was submitted to an examination by the fiscal authorities. In the Bundesfinanzhof (<b>Federal</b> <b>Finance</b> <b>Court)</b> it was decided in November 1999 to deny Stille Hilfe non-profit, i.e. charitable, status.For years {{they have had a}} prominent symbol: Gudrun Burwitz, the daughter of Heinrich Himmler. Known to her father as [...] "Püppi", she is an idol to Stille Hilfe and their affiliates. At meetings such as Ulrichsbergtreffen in Austria she appeared {{at the same time as}} a star and an authority. Burwitz has campaigned intensively in the last few years for accused Nazis. This particularly showed up in the case of Anton Malloth, who had lived undisturbed for about 40 years in Meran. He was proven guilty for his acts as a supervisor in the Gestapo-prison [...] "Kleine Festung Theresienstadt", which was part of the larger Theresienstadt concentration camp. In 2001 Malloth was convicted by the district court of Munich for murder and attempted murder and sentenced to life imprisonment after the public prosecutor's office in Munich had taken over the procedure of the public prosecutor's office in Dortmund, which for many years had hijacked the procedure. From 1988 to 2000, Malloth lived in Pullach near Munich. Gudrun Burwitz was instructed by Stille Hilfe to rent a comfortable room for him in a home for the aged, which was built on a lot formerly owned by Rudolf Hess. In common with the secretive nature of the organisation, Burwitz does not give press interviews.|$|E
