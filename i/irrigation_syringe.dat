40|$|Abstract This study {{evaluated}} the bond strength of mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) to root canal dentin after {{the performance of}} various irrigation procedures to remove triple antibiotic paste (TAP). A total of 56 single-rooted human mandibular premolars were instrumented using a rotary system to size 40 and divided randomly into a control group (no intracanal dressing) and three experimental groups (TAP application for 28 days). TAP was then removed by rinsing with 10 mL 2. 5 % NaOCl using three irrigation systems (Vibringe sonic <b>irrigation,</b> CanalBrush, and <b>syringe</b> <b>irrigation).</b> The coronal and middle parts of root canals were then obturated with MTA. After storage for 1 week, each specimen was embedded in an acrylic block and sectioned horizontally (2 -mm-thick slices) at two levels (coronal and middle). Bond strength of MTA to root canal dentin was assessed in 28 samples per group via push-out test using a universal testing machine.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} irrigation time on the removal of dentin debris from root canals irrigated with passive ultrasonic irrigation comparing 2 flushing methods. Method and Materials: Root canals with a standardized groove in 1 canal wall, which was filled with dentin debris, were irrigated ultrasonically or with <b>syringe</b> <b>irrigation.</b> The quantity of dentin debris after irrigation was determined. In groups 1 to 4, the irrigant was activated by an ultrasonically activated file. In groups 1 and 2 (n = 20), the canals were flushed 3 or 1. 5 minutes using a continuous flow of irrigant. In groups 3 and 4 (n = 20), the irrigation time was 1 or 3 minutes, and the canals were flushed 3 times by <b>syringe</b> <b>irrigation</b> (intermittent flushing method). In group 5 (n = 20), the root canals were flushed 3 times using <b>syringe</b> <b>irrigation.</b> Results: Significantly more dentin debris was removed when the irrigant was activated by ultrasound (P =. 000). Significantly less dentin debris was removed when the root canals were irrigated with a continuous flow of irrigant for 1. 5 minutes (P =. 005).

Recent data suggests that an activated irrigation protocol such as passive ultrasonic irrigation can result in decreased intracanal bacteria.

The purpose of this randomized, double blinded, prospective in-vivo clinical study was to compare the results of a non-activated irrigation protocol (NAI) using only NaOCl 1. 5 % to a passive ultrasonic irrigation protocol (PUI) using NaOCl 1. 5 %, EDTA 17 % and Chlorhexidine 2 % in rendering canals bacteria free.

40|$|Objective Calcium {{hydroxide}} (Ca(OH) 2) {{has been}} used in endodontics as an intracanal medicament due to its antimicrobial effects and its ability to inactivate bacterial endotoxin. The inability to totally remove this intracanal medicament from the root canal system, however, may interfere with the setting of eugenol-based sealers or inhibit bonding of resin to dentin, thus presenting clinical challenges with endodontic treatment. This study used a chemical titration method to measure residual Ca(OH) 2 left after different endodontic irrigation methods. Material and Methods Eighty-six human canine roots were prepared for obturation. Thirty teeth were filled with known but different amounts of Ca(OH) 2 for 7 days, which were dissolved out and titrated to quantitate the residual Ca(OH) 2 recovered from each root to produce a standard curve. Forty-eight of the remaining teeth were filled with equal amounts of Ca(OH) 2 followed by gross Ca(OH) 2 removal using hand files and randomized treatment of either: 1) Syringe irrigation; 2) <b>Syringe</b> <b>irrigation</b> with use of an apical file; 3) <b>Syringe</b> <b>irrigation</b> with added 30 s of passive ultrasonic irrigation (PUI), or 4) <b>Syringe</b> <b>irrigation</b> with apical file and PUI (n= 12 /group). Residual Ca(OH) 2 was dissolved with glycerin and titrated to measure residual Ca(OH) 2 left in the root. Results No method completely removed all residual Ca(OH) 2. The addition of 30 s PUI with or without apical file use removed Ca(OH) 2 significantly better than irrigation alone. Conclusions This technique allowed quantification of residual Ca(OH) 2.

Methodology  A validated CFD model was used to simulate the irrigant flow from either a side-vented or a flat 30 G needle positioned inside root canals having sizes of 25, 35, 45 and 55, all with a. 06 taper, at 3 mm short of working length (WL). Velocity, pressure and shear stress in the root canal were evaluated. Results  Different preparation sizes resulted in minor differences in the flow pattern in the apical root canal. Major differences were observed between the two needle types. The side-vented needle could not achieve irrigant replacement to the WL even in a size 55,. 06 taper root canal. Significant irrigant replacement was evident almost to the WL in size 35, 45 and 55,. 06 taper root canals with the flat needle. The maximum shear stress decreased as the preparation size increased. The flat needle developed higher mean pressure at the apical foramen. Both needles led to a similar gradual decrease in apical pressure as the preparation size increased.

After shaping with nickel-titanium instruments to a master apical file size # 40, specimens were devided in two groups according to the root canal irrigation system. Teeth assigned to group 1 (n= 10) received a final <b>irrigation</b> with conventional <b>syringe</b> and a 30 -gauge needle (NaviTip; Ultradent, South Jordan, UT); teeth assigned to group 2 (n= 10) were rinsed with an irrigation device based on negative apical pressure (EdoVac, Discus Dental, Culver City, CA). The amount of residual smear layer and debris was evaluated at the scannig electron microscope analysis, and a semi-qualitative score was assigned to each tooth at the coronal, medium and apical third of the root canals. A nonparametric test was performed to compare the results of the S. E. M. analysis. Results: no significant differences (p> 0. 05) were found between the two irrigation methods in the removal of smear layer in the whole lenght of the root canal walls. Apical negative pressure removes statistically more debris (p= 0. 022) than conventional syringe in the apical third of the root canals, but no statistical differences were found between group 1 and 2 in the medium and coronal part of the samples. Conclusions: the outcome of this study indicates that the EndoVac system removes more debris in the apical region of the root canal than the conventional needle irrigation, but there are no significant differences in the removal of smear layer between the two techniques...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: It is well {{established}} that the causative agent of endodontic disease is the presence and growth of bacteria (Kakehashi et al., 1965; Möller et al., 1981). Therefore, eradication of bacteria is essential to prevent or eliminate apical periodontitis. Studies have shown that elimination of bacteria prior to obturation {{has resulted in a}} more favourable outcome for endodontic therapy (Sjögren et al., 1997). When endodontic treatment fails, bacteria is often isolated from the root canals of these teeth. One of the most commonly isolated bacteria is Enterococcus faecalis (Molander et al., 1998; Sundqvist et al, 1998). As such, endodontic therapy is founded upon three principles: mechanical instrumentation; irrigation with antimicrobial agents and placement of an intracanal medicament (Haapasalo et al., 2005). However, the complex anatomy of the root canal system often prevents the penetration of irrigants and medicaments into recesses that cannot be accessed by mechanical instrumentation. The advent of sonic, ultrasonic and laser instruments has led to many investigations looking at their potential for the activation of irrigants (Lee et al., 2004; de Gregorio et al., 2009; De Moor et al., 2009). However, most of these studies have concentrated on the removal of dentinal debris and smear layer (Lee et al., 2004). Aim: The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate and compare the effectiveness of three modes of irrigation: syringe irrigation; sonic activation and laser activation of the irrigant in eradicating E. faecalis that had been cultivated within the root canals of extracted single rooted teeth. Methodology: A flow cell was designed and constructed. The extracted teeth were decoronated, and prepared with rotary instruments to # 40 to 1 mm beyond the apex of the tooth. This was to allow nutrient media to flow through the root canals. The flow cell was connected to a nutrient reservoir containing Todd Hewitt Broth, which was pumped into the flow cell via a peristaltic pump. The flow cell was inoculated with E. faecalis (ATCC 700802) and cultivated for a period of four weeks. The flow cell was then dismantled and the teeth were assigned to 6 treatment groups: 1. <b>syringe</b> <b>irrigation</b> with saline 2. <b>syringe</b> <b>irrigation</b> with 4 % sodium hypochlorite 3. sonic activation of saline (EndoActivator, Dentsply) 4. sonic activation of 4 % sodium hypochlorite 5. laser activation of saline (Er,Cr:YSGG Waterlase, Biolase Technology) 6. laser activation of 4 % sodium hypochlorite Teeth were irrigated with 5 ml of either saline or 4 % sodium hypochlorite for 1 minute. The 4 % sodium hypochlorite solution was inactivated with 5 % sodium thiosulphate. Teeth that received sonic activation were irrigated by hand for 5 seconds, followed by 10 seconds of sonic activation, and this was repeated four times over 1 minute. Laser activation of the irrigants was also performed. Irrigant was introduced into the canal for 10 seconds, followed by 5 seconds of laser activation, (0. 25 W, 20 Hz) this cycle was repeated four times. Teeth were then crushed and serial dilutions were performed to determine the number of viable bacteria (CFU/ml) remaining in the root canals. Protein assays were conducted to quantitate the amount of biofilm obtained. Samples were also taken from each treatment group and the radicular dentinal surfaces of the root canals were viewed under scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results: The root canals that were syringe irrigated with saline were the positive controls. Activation of the irrigants with either the sonic or laser instruments resulted in reduced cellular viability of E. faecalis. The most dramatic reduction in viability of E. faecalis was seen when the Er,Cr:YSGG laser was used to activate 4 % sodium hypochlorite, resulting in 99. 93 % ± 0. 14 % percentage kill. SEM analysis showed that sonic activation with saline only caused minimal disruption to the biofilm. Teeth irrigated with sodium hypochlorite showed fewer bacterial cells on the radicular dentine but was not effective in eliminating E. faecalis that had invaded the dentinal tubules. Laser activation of sodium hypochlorite resulted in clean dentine walls and minimal bacteria within the dentinal tubules. Conclusion: Sonic or laser activation of an antimicrobial irrigant resulted in more effective bacterial elimination compared to hand <b>irrigation.</b> Compared to <b>syringe</b> <b>irrigation</b> and sonic activation of sodium hypochlorite, laser activation of sodium hypochlorite was able to effectively disinfect the root canal.

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effect of 2. 5 % (wt/vol) sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) agitation on the removal, killing, and degradation of Enterococcus faecalis biofilm. A total of 45 root canal models were manufactured using 3 D printing with each model comprising an 18 mm length simulated root canal of apical size 30 and taper 0. 06. E. faecalis biofilms were grown on the apical 3 mm of the models for 10 days. A total of 60 s of 9 ml of 2. 5 % NaOCl <b>irrigation</b> using <b>syringe</b> and needle was performed, the irrigant was either left stagnant in the canal or agitated using manual (Gutta-percha), sonic, and ultrasonic methods for 30 s. Following irrigation, the residual biofilms were observed using confocal laser scanning, scanning electron, and transmission electron microscopy. The data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA with Dunnett post hoc tests at a level of significance p ≤. 05. Consequence of root canal irrigation indicate that the reduction in the amount of biofilm achieved with the active irrigation groups (manual, sonic, and ultrasonic) was significantly greater when compared with the passive and untreated groups (p <. 05). Collectively, finding indicate that passive irrigation exhibited more residual biofilm on the model surface than irrigant agitated by manual or automated (sonic, ultrasonic) methods.

The {{aim of this}} study was to determine which tibial surface preparation technique leads to the best bone-cement contact. Materials and Methods: Human tibial plateau specimens were cleaned in four different ways before cementing: a) no cleaning, b) manual <b>syringe</b> <b>irrigation,</b> c) fracture brush cleaning, and d) pulsatile jet-lavage. The specimens were cut into transverse sections and the bone cement contact distance was calculated for every 10 mm and the cement penetration depth was measured. Both values were statistically analyzed (ANOVA). Results: The longest bone-cement contact (62 mm) was seen after PJL, the shortest (10. 6 mm) after no cleaning at all. The deepest cement penetration (4. 1 mm) again was seen after PJL, the least (0. 7 mm) after no cleaning. Statistically, PJL yielded the longest bone-cement contact and deepest cement penetration.

40|$|Introduction Eliminating the {{residual}} debris and {{bacteria in the}} root canal system {{is one of the}} main purposes of the endodontic treatment. However, the complexity on the anatomy of the root canal system makes it difficult to eliminate the bacterial biofilm existing along the root canal surface and necrotic pulp tissue by mechanical instrumentation and chemical irrigation. Recently, more effective irrigant delivery systems for root canal irrigation have been developed.

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the calcium {{hydroxide}} (Ca(OH) 2) removal efficacy of the EndoActivator system with that of conventional <b>irrigation</b> with a <b>syringe</b> and hand file manipulation. Materials and Methods: A total of 44 extracted human single-rooted mandibular premolars were used. The root canal systems of all teeth were cleaned and shaped, then filled with Ca(OH) 2 paste. The teeth were divided into two groups: Ca(OH) 2 was removed using ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) with hand filing and irrigation (Group 1) or the EndoActivator system (Group 2). Each tooth was split into two halves and examined under a scanning electron microscope. Results: Ca(OH) 2 particles were completely removed at the coronal level in both experimental groups. More Ca(OH) 2 particles were present in the apical third than in the middle-third in both groups. No significant interaction was observed between the two experimental groups or among the three examined levels (P > 0. 05). Conclusion: Agitation with NaOCl and EDTA improved Ca(OH) 2 removal only in the coronal third of the root canal. Use of the EndoActivator system did not improve the efficacy of Ca(OH) 2 removal in the middle and apical thirds...|$|R

Material and Methods One hundred five extracted single-rooted teeth were instrumented. The roots were split longitudinally. Three standard grooves were created and covered with DAP. The roots were distributed into seven groups: Group 1, beveled needle irrigation; Group 2, double side-vented needle irrigation; Group 3, CanalBrush; Group 4, XP-endo Finisher; Group 5, Vibringe; Group 6, PUI; Group 7, LAI. The amount of remaining DAP was scored under a stereomicroscope. Results Group 4, Group 6, and Group 7 removed significantly more DAP than the other protocols in the coronal region. Group 7 was more efficient in the middle region; however, no significant difference was found between Group 7 and Group 6. No differences were found between groups in the apical region either, except for the comparisons between groups 7 and 2, and groups 2 and 3. Conclusions None of the investigated protocols were able to completely remove the DAP from the grooves. The Vibringe and XP-endo Finisher systems showed results similar to those of conventional needle irrigation...|$|R
40|$|During a {{root canal}} {{treatment}} the root canal is irrigated with an antimicrobial fluid, commonly performed {{with a needle}} and a <b>syringe.</b> <b>Irrigation</b> of a root canal with {{two different types of}} needles can be modeled as an impinging axisymmetric or non-axisymmetric jet. These jets are investigated experimentally with high-speed Particle Imaging Velocimetry, inside and outside the confinement (concave surface) of a root canal, and compared to theoretical predictions for these jets. The efficacy of irrigation fluid refreshment with respect to the typical reaction time of the antimicrobial fluid with a biofilm is characterized with a non-dimensional Damköhler number. The pressure that these jets induce on a wall or at the apex of the root canal is also measured. The axisymmetric jet is found to be stable and its velocity agrees with the theoretical prediction for this type of jet, however, a confinement causes instabilities to the jet. The confinement of the root canal has a pronounced influence on the flow, for both the axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric jet, by reducing the velocities by one order of magnitude and increasing the pressure at the apex. The non-axisymmetric jet inside the confinement shows a cascade of eddies with decreasing velocities, which at the apex does not provide adequate irrigation fluid refreshmen...|$|R
