Coordination through cluster head selection provides efficient data aggregation that reduces communication overhead in the network. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy logic approach based DDEEC clustering algorithm which aims to prolong the lifetime of nodes in heterogeneous WSNs. We compare this algorithm with the PSO based DDEEC algorithm and original DDEEC algorithm according to the parameters of first node dies at different rounds and energy-efficiency metrics. The efficiency of proposed optimized fuzzy algorithm is proved by the Matlab experimental results.

40|$|Lysosomal storage {{diseases}} (LSD) are metabolic disorders {{characterized by}} accumulation of undegraded material. The mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are LSDs {{defined by the}} storage of glycosaminoglycans. Previously, we hypothesized that cells affected with LSD have increased energy expenditure for biosynthesis because of deficiencies of raw materials sequestered within the lysosome. Thus, LSDs {{can be characterized as}} diseases of deficiency as well as overabundance (lysosomal storage). In this study, metabolite analysis identified deficiencies in simple sugars, nucleotides, and lipids in the livers of MPSI mice. In contrast, most amino acids, amino acid derivatives, dipeptides, and urea were elevated. These data suggest that protein catabolism, perhaps because of increased autophagy, is at least partially fulfilling intermediary metabolism. Thus, maintaining glycosaminoglycan synthesis in the absence of recycled precursors results in major shifts in the energy utilization of the cells. A high fat diet increased simple sugars and some fats and lowered the apparent protein catabolism. Interestingly, autophagy, which is increased in several LSDs, is responsive to dietary intervention and is reduced in MPSVII and MPSI mice fed a high fat diet. Although long term dietary treatment improved body weight in MPSVII mice, it failed to <b>improve</b> <b>life</b> <b>span</b> or retinal function. In addition, the ventricular hypertrophy and proximal aorta dilation observed in MPSVII mice were unchanged by a high fat, simple sugar diet.

A small soil nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, was grown for 3 days from hatching on a lawn of Escherichia coli OP 50 as the normal food source, and subsequently some of the nematodes were fed lactic acid bacteria (LAB). The life spans of worms fed LAB were significantly longer than the life spans of those fed OP 50. To investigate the effect of age on host defenses, 3 - to 7 -day-old worms fed OP 50 were transferred onto a lawn of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis for infection. The nematodes died {{over the course of several}} days, and the accumulation of salmonella in the intestinal lumen suggested that the worms were infected. The 7 -day-old worms showed a higher death rate during the 5 days after infection than nematodes infected at the age of 3 days; no clear difference was observed when the worms were exposed to OP 50. We then investigated whether the LAB could exert probiotic effects on the worms' host defenses and <b>improve</b> <b>life</b> <b>span.</b> Seven-day-old nematodes fed LAB from the age of 3 days were more resistant to salmonella than worms fed OP 50 until they were infected with salmonella.

40|$|The {{tropical}} trees, Azadirachta indica (neem), Lannea microcarpa, Sclerocarya birrea and Khaya senegalensis, {{are important}} multipurpose species. Unfortunately, difficult seed storage behaviour limits {{the utilization of}} these species in reforestation programs and agroforestry systems. This thesis {{presents the results of}} investigations aimed at {{a better understanding of the}} seed biology, particularly focussed on the improvement of seed survival after drying and subsequent dry storage. Seeds collected from several stands in Burkina Faso were studied in an attempt to elucidate the causes of viability loss and <b>improve</b> <b>life</b> <b>span.</b> Initially it was thought that the difficulty in storing seeds of these species is due to intolerance of desiccation and sensitivity to low (subzero 0 C) storage temperatures. However, the results of the current study indicated that other factors are responsible for the difficult storage behaviour of these seeds. When the moisture content (MC) was reduced from 27 to 5 %, neem seeds became sensitive to rehydration temperatures below 25 °C, resulting in a noticeable decrease in germination percentage. Rehydration of these dried seeds at elevated temperatures (25 - 400 C) for one hour prior to further incubation at 300 C substantially improved germination to a level comparable to that of fresh seeds (27 % MC). We concluded that neem seed is desiccation tolerant, but that during drying its germination requirements change, which is the main cause of its difficult storage behaviour. Germination capability of S. birrea seeds was low in all seed lots at harvest, but improved substantially during drying and/or dry storage. Improvement of germination with drying is completely in contrast with what would happen in a desiccation-sensitive seed. We interpreted the observed increase in germination during drying and dry storage as resulting from the slow disappearance of an initially present physiological dormancy. Seeds of S. birrea thus behave as orthodox seeds, but the irregularity in their germination behaviour has obviously contributed to discrepancies between reports on the species seed biology. Seeds of L microcarpa harvested in three successive years were extremely variable as to their germinability and storability. Some seed accessions had a generally low germination, while others had an initially high germination. Drying did not affect germination capability of the poorly germinating seed accessions, but did so in the well germinating accessions. These observations would suggest that seeds can be either tolerant or sensitive to desiccation. However, when mechanically scarified prior to germination tests, seeds from all accessions germinated at high percentage (> 80 %), regardless of MC and age. This indicates that seeds experienced germination constraints upon drying rather than being sensitive to desiccation. Imbibed, intact seeds that failed to germinate displayed a moderate rate of respiration with RQ values< 1, which indicates that the seed coat is permeable to water and respiratory gases. On scarification, water uptake and respiration steeply rose in narrow association with radicle emergence. Non-scarified seeds lost germination ability and cellular viability after approx 15 d of moist incubation at 300 C. Apparently, coat-imposed inhibition of germination does not prolong viability of seeds in the hydrated state. These results suggest that radicle emergence is inhibited mechanically and not by germination inhibitors or physiological dormancy. We conclude that L microcarpa seeds display orthodox storage behaviour, but that physical dormancy explains the difficult seed storage behaviour reported for this species. In the case of K. senegalensis, the MC of seeds at harvest was low (< 0. 1 g H 2 O g DM" 1) and further drying did not affect the initially high germinability (90 - 100 %). During storage a relative!y fast viability loss was observed for seeds stored at 4 °C in comparison with seeds stored at - 20, 15, and 200 C. The sensitivity to low above-zero (0 C) temperatures might be the cause of the erratic loss of viability often observed in these seeds. We concluded that seeds of all the species investigated in this thesis display orthodox storage behaviour, but that various factors including sensitivity to imbibitional stress, physiological and physical dormancy, and sensitivity to low above-zero (0 C) storage temperatures cause the reported difficulties in storing these seeds. Tropical tree seeds are thought to be particularly sensitive to low imbibition temperatures because of the relatively high gel-to-liquid crystalline phase transition temperature (Tm) of their membranes as compared to the relatively low T 177 of membranes of temperate zone seeds. In relation with this, the sensitivity of the four seed species to rehydration at low temperatures was investigated. The results indicated that dried neem seeds are particularly sensitive to imbibitional stress, whereas the seeds of the other species appeared to be less (K. senegalensis) or not (L microcarpa and 5. birrea) sensitive to low imbibition temperatures. This difference in sensitivity to imbibitional stress was observed despite comparable T 177 of membranes in the roots of seedlings of K. senegalensis, L microcarpa and neem (11. 5, 14. 5 and 9. 60 C, respectively). The hypothesis of tropical tree seeds being particularly sensitive to imbibitional stress because of their high membrane Tm therefore does not have general validity. LTSEM images of cryo-pianed K. senegalensis seed embryos revealed the presence of a dense peripheral cell layer, which might have slowed water uptake and reduced sensitivity to imbibitional stress. On the other hand, for the sensitive neem seeds, it was observed that the loss of germinability of imbibitional damaged seeds did not involve death of all the cells. An assessment of membrane integrity by ESR and cryo-SEM indicated that seed germination is not supported when approx. 30 % or more of axis cells have died. This supposes that there are still on average 70 % or less of live cells in a non-germinating seed. From this observation, we argue that up to this lethal threshold, seeds are able to repair the damage caused by imbibitional stress or survive with a number of damaged cells. We suggest that differences in tolerated number of damaged cells, in intrinsic repair capabilities, or in morphology of the outer cell layers determine the level of sensitivity of seeds to imbibitional stress. Low temperatures are expected to better maintain viability of seeds in dry storage than do high temperatures. However, we noticed that storage conditions at 4 °C were more detrimental for K. senega/ensis seeds than at - 200 C or 15 °C, and this was, to a lesser extent, true for L microcarpa seeds. Because viability loss associated with ageing is often attributed to the loss of membrane barrier function, membrane polar lipids (PLs) were analysed in several K. senegalensis seed lots differing in age and viability. The data indicated that the content of membrane PLs steadily decreased with ageing. However, it appeared that seeds can withstand the loss of a certain amount of PLs without losing germinability. Based on data of seeds stored dry at 15 °C and at 4 °C, it was observed that the loss of germinability coincided with a loss of between 15 % and 25 % of the PLs. With the decrease in PL content, the free fatty acid content rose. Because the free fatty acid also can arise from degradation of triacylglycerols, it was difficult to establish a critical content of accumulated free fatty acids associated with viability loss. Chemical analysis of membranes in 20 year-old dry-stored K. senegalensis seeds, which were already non-germinable for a long period of time, indicated a loss of 80 % of the PLs. However, this did not lead to changes in the structure of the plasma membranes in the dried axis as could be observed by high resolution SEM after freeze fracturing. This was interpreted to mean that the deesterified acyl chains were still at the position, at which they originally occurred in the membranes of the fresh seed. This was also the case for the 4 °C-stored dried specimens that had just become non-viable. The IMPs (transmembrane proteins) were regularly distributed in the plane of the membrane, indicating the absence of a phase separation in the dry state. The data of the current study suggest that membrane phase separation, thought to occur during viability loss, is unlikely to happen in the dry state. However, at rehydration the plasma membranes suffered considerable damage or ceased existing. The question as to how the deesterification takes place - via free radical activity or by phospholipase activity - was addressed. With free radicals being involved one would not expect a greater amount of acyl chains to be split off at 4 °C than at 15 °C. However, since the physical state of the membrane determines the activity of phospholipases, we focussed on the membrane phase issue. The mismatch between gel phase domains and the liquid crystalline matrix at mid-melting temperature gives better access to the site of action, thus increasing the activity of phospholipases. At either the gel or liquid crystalline phase, accessibility to the site of action is more difficult. An ESR spin labe! study indicated that membranes in dried and rehydrated axes of K. senegalensis seeds were rigid at - 200 C, while at 7 °C they appeared to be in a mixed liquid crystalline - gel phase condition. The liquid crystalline phase prevailed at 15 °C. Thus, it can be expected that during dry storage at 4 °C the mixed phase can occur for extended periods of time. Therefore, we suggest that the deesterification of acyl chains leading to the loss of viability of seeds at low above zero (0 C) temperatures occurs, at least part!y, via phospholipase activity. Because of their high Tm, membranes of tropical seeds are likely to reach mid me!ting condition at low above zero (0 C) temperatures that are high enough to support enzyme activity. By contrast, it is expected that the lower mid-me!ting temperatures of seeds from the temperate climate zones are too low to effectively support phospholipase activity at sub-zero (0 C) temperatures. This special feature of tropical seeds dismisses the use of cold rooms for short and medium term (1 - 3 years) storage purposes. The results obtained in this study will increase and facilitate the use of these species in reforestation and agroforestry programs in Burkina Faso and other Sahelian countries...|$|E

We hypothesized that altered nutrient sensing (by HBP) with age may provide a link among aging, nutrient flux, and insulin resistance. Using a hyperinsulinemic clamp in young rats, we show that experimental activation of HBP, through the systemic infusion of glucosamine, induced severe insulin resistance (36 % decline in peripheral insulin action; P< 0. 05), increased adipose tissue gene expression of fat-derived peptides (PAI- 1 by 4 -fold, angiotensinogen 3 -fold, leptin 2 -fold, resistin 4 -fold, and adiponectin 4 -fold; P< 0. 01 compared with young saline-infused), and enhanced glycosylation of transcription factors, thus mimicking a physiological and biological phenotype of aging. We further demonstrate a greater activation of nutrient-sensing HBP with age in both old ad libitum-fed and calorie-restricted rats. Interestingly, old calorie-restricted animals rapidly develop insulin resistance when exposed to glucosamine, despite their “young” phenotype. These results suggest that altered nutrient sensing by HBP with age may be the link among nutrients, insulin resistance, and age-related diabetes. —Einstein, F.

40|$|Amyotrophic lateral {{sclerosis}} (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder {{typified by}} a massive loss of motor neurons with few therapeutic options. The exact cause of neuronal degeneration is unknown but it is now admitted that ALS is a multifactorial disease with several mechanisms involved including glutamate excitotoxicity. More specifically, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) -mediated cell death and impairment of the glutamate-transport has been suggested to {{play a key role}} in ALS pathophysiology. Thus, evaluating NMDAR antagonists is of high therapeutic interest. Gacyclidine, also named GK 11, is a high affinity non-competitive NMDAR antagonist that may protect against motor neuron death in an ALS context. Moreover, GK 11 presents a low intrinsic neurotoxicity and has already been used in two clinical trials for CNS lesions. In the present study, we investigated the influence of chronic administration of two doses of GK 11 (0. 1 and 1 mg/kg) on the survival and the functional motor activity of hSOD 1 G 93 A mice, an animal model of ALS. Treatment started at early symptomatic age (60 days) and was applied bi-weekly until the end stage of the disease. We first confirmed that functional alteration of locomotor activity was evident in the hSOD 1 G 93 A transgenic female mice by 60 days of age. A low dose of GK 11 improved the survival of the mice by 4. 3 % and partially preserved body weight. <b>Improved</b> <b>life</b> <b>span</b> was associated with a delay in locomotor function impairment. Conversely, the high dose treatment worsened motor functions. These findings suggest that chronic administration of GK 11 beginning at early symptomatic stage may be beneficial for patients with ALS...|$|R
30|$|B. Because {{polyurethane}} DCs {{are made}} of rigid plastic, they must not be extended beyond the superior vena cava to avoid right atrial trauma. For internal jugular access, both 15 – 20 -cm silicone DCs targeting the superior vena cava and 20 – 24 -cm soft silicone DCs targeting the right atrium appeared to be safe in critically ill patients. However, the silicone DCs with right atrial placement also <b>improved</b> dialyzer <b>life</b> <b>span</b> [33]. For femoral access, DC tips should {{be placed in the}} inferior vena cava to minimize blood recirculation because the lower flow in the smaller veins can dip below the pumped flow. Femoral catheters < 20 cm have significantly greater blood recirculation than those > 20 cm [34]. In critically ill patients, DCs with a minimal length of 24 cm could possibly be used, because compared with 24 -cm femoral DC 20 -cm femoral DCs are independently associated with a diminished urea reduction ratio [11].|$|R
40|$|Wireless {{sensor network}} (WSN) {{consists}} of hundred to thousands sensor nodes to gathered {{the information from}} physical environment. Different clustering based algorithms have been proposed to improve network lifetime and energy efficiency. Practically it is not feasible to recharge the battery of sensor nodes when they are sensing the data. In such situation energy is crucial resource {{and it should be}} <b>improved</b> for <b>life</b> <b>span</b> of WSN. Cluster head (CH) has an important role in hierarchical energy efficient routing protocols because it receives data from nodes and sends towards base station (BS) or sink node. This paper presents a grid based cluster head selection (GBCHS) mechanism by dividing the network field into MXN uniform size partitions that aims to minimize the energy dissipation of sensor nodes and enhancing network lifetime. Simulation experiments have been performed in network simulator (NS 2) that show our proposed GBCHS approach outperformed than standard clustering hierarchy LEACH protocol...|$|R
40|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} {{consist of}} small battery powered sensor nodes with limited energy resources. The area of {{wireless sensor networks}} is now attractive in the research area due to its applications in many fields such as defense security, civilian applications and medical research etc. In wireless sensor networks, the important task is to periodically collect data from an area of interest for time-sensitive applications. Then the sensed data must be gathered and transmitted to a base station for further processing to meet the end-user queries. Routing is a serious issue in WSN due {{to the use of}} computationally-constrained and resourceconstrainedmicro-sensors. Once the sensor nodes are deployed replacement is not feasible. Hence, energy efficiency is a key design issue to <b>improve</b> the <b>life</b> <b>span</b> of the network. Since the network consists of low-costnodes with limited battery power, it is a challenging task to design an efficient routing scheme that can offer good performance in energy efficiency, and long network lifetimes...|$|R
40|$|Recently it {{has been}} {{discovered}} that Sirtuins represent pivotal regulators of lifespan. Caloric restriction (CR) enhances longevity from yeast to mammals. Whereas the relationship between Sirt- 1 and CR is clear, the molecular mechanisms by which Sir 2 increases longevity are still unknown. In mammals, CR induces physiological and behavioral changes, and many {{studies have shown that}} CR decreases production of reactive oxygen species production thus minimizing oxidative damage, leading to the hypothesis that CR by reducing oxidative stress extends the lifespan by counteraction of aging. In fact, the pathophysiology of aging and age-related diseases involves oxidative stress as an early stage in its development. Recently we found that in aged rats the SIRT 1 activity was decreased in heart and adipose tissue, showing as aging is characterized in vivo by a reduced efficiency of this key-regulator of longevity. Whereas several studies have reported that increased physical activity can <b>improve</b> mean <b>life</b> <b>span</b> presumably by reducing mortality risk from many age-related diseases, exercise and longevity studies have failed to document an exercise effect on maximum <b>life</b> <b>span.</b> However, in aged rats a moderate prolonged exercise training is able to induce increase in SIRT 1 activity, suggesting that this tool could counteract age-related dysfunctions...|$|R
30|$|Aging {{infrastructure}} {{is a growing}} concern for federal, state, and local governments across the United States and for many countries worldwide. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) estimates that one in nine of the nation’s bridges is rated as structurally deficient and {{the average age of the}} nation’s 607, 380 bridges is about 42  years (ASCE (American Society of Civil Engineers) 2017; AASHTO (American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials) 2008; NJDOT (New Jersey Department of Transportation) 2007). 1 Thus county, city, state, and federal agencies need to increase budgets enormously to fix these deficient bridges. Many research studies focused on materials, systems and technologies to <b>improve</b> the <b>life</b> <b>span</b> of deficient bridge structures (FHWA (Federal Highway Administration) 2009; Floyd 2009; Stratton and McCollom 1974; Barbara and Wayne 1988; Camille and Debs 2007). It was reported that sound rehabilitation principles and techniques also play a crucial role in successful concrete rehabilitation process (Chase and Laman 2000; Arockiasamy 2000; FDOT (Florida Department of Transportation) 1999; NCHRP (National Cooperative Highway Research Program) Synthesis 375 2007).|$|R
40|$|Homozygous {{mutations}} in the glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene result in Gaucher disease (GD), {{the most common}} lysosomal storage disease. Recent genetic studies have revealed that GBA mutations confer a strong risk for sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD). To investigate how GBA mutations cause PD, we generated GBA nonsense mutant (GBA-/-) medaka that are completely deficient in glucocerebrosidase (GCase) activity. In contrast to the perinatal death in humans and mice lacking GCase activity, GBA-/- medaka survived for months, enabling analysis of the pathological progression. GBA-/- medaka displayed the pathological phenotypes resembling human neuronopathic GD including infiltration of Gaucher cell-like cells into the brains, progressive neuronal loss, and microgliosis. Detailed pathological findings represented lysosomal abnormalities in neurons and alpha-synuclein (α-syn) accumulation in axonal swellings containing autophagosomes. Unexpectedly, disruption of α-syn did not <b>improve</b> the <b>life</b> <b>span,</b> formation of axonal swellings, neuronal loss, or neuroinflammation in GBA-/- medaka. Taken together, the present study revealed GBA-/- medaka as a novel neuronopathic GD model, the pahological mechanisms of α-syn accumulation caused by GCase deficiency, and the minimal contribution of α-syn to the pathogenesis of neuronopathic GD...|$|R
