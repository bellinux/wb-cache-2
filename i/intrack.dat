It was established in Subedarganj, Allahabad in 1984 to provide track machine training in India. The training centre presently imparts quality training to officers and staff of Indian Railways and Railway Public-sector undertakings (PSU) viz. RITES, IRCON, KRCL etc. It is managed as a department under North Central Railway (NCR) under Indian Railways, Government Of India.It provides technical training to the different Railway departments specially to Track Machine and PWay (permanent way) ...|$|E
40|$|A simple {{analytic}} orbit propagator {{is presented}} which incorporates a mean-to-osculating transformation {{to generate a}} graphical display of the trajectories of earth-orbiting satellites. The first-order effects of the oblateness of the earth on the orbit are consistently included. The propagator encompasses a mean-to-osculating transformation on the semimajor axis, since large <b>intrack</b> errors can be generated by failing to observe {{the distinction between the}} mean and osculating values of this parameter...|$|E
40|$|By <b>intrack</b> orbital {{error is}} meant a {{constant}} time adjustment that {{is applied to}} a set of ephemeris data which is otherwise correct. The ephemeris data may be {{in the form of an}} orbit tape or in the form of orbital elements with an associated orbit generator. The time adjustment is simply added to the time before the ephemeris routine is accessed. It is implicit here that the time adjustment is a constant throughout the pass of data that are considered, where the pass of data is typically a fraction of one orbit...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} work, it is {{considered}} that the description of movement of the objects, in general, takes place in theconception of this happens in the space time, and that its interactions or causes are described of equal way; notmattering if the interaction is developed in the space or the time, this causes that the movements be incorrectlyanalyzed. Here two examples of systems are examined, one in the basic laboratory of physics and another one <b>intracks</b> of car races (dragster). The difference in the obtained accelerations becomes evident considering its averages inthe space and the time. Also, we show that in both situations {{in which we can}} describe the movement, a) those wherethe initial situation is only known and final, and b) those where knows the position at every time, the difference in theaccelerations is observed...|$|R
40|$|Radio-interferometric ranging {{is a novel}} {{technique}} that allows for fine-grained node localization in networks of inexpensive COTS nodes. In this paper, we show that the approach can also be applied to precision tracking of mobile sensor nodes. We introduce <b>inTrack,</b> a cooperative tracking system based on radio-interferometry that features high accuracy, long range and low-power operation. The system utilizes a set of nodes placed at known locations to track a mobile sensor. We analyze how target speed and measurement errors affect {{the accuracy of the}} computed locations. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we describe our prototype implementation using Berkeley motes. We evaluate the system using data from both simulations and field tests...|$|E
40|$|Analytic and semi-analytic {{methods are}} used to show that users of the GPS {{constellation}} can expect performance variations based on their location. Specifically, performance is {{shown to be a}} function of both altitude and latitude. These results stem {{from the fact that the}} GPS constellation is itself non-uniform. For example, GPS satellites are over four times as likely to be directly over Tierra del Fuego than over Hawaii or Singapore. Inevitable performance variations due to user location occur for ground, sea, air and space GPS users. These performance variations can be studied in an average relative sense. A semi-analytic tool which symmetrically allocates GPS satellite latitude belt dwell times among longitude points is used to compute average performance metrics. These metrics include average number of GPS vehicles visible, relative average accuracies in the radial, <b>intrack</b> and crosstrack (or radial, north/south, east/west) directions, and relative average PDOP or GDOP. The tool can be quickly changed to incorporate various user antenna obscuration models and various GPS constellation designs. Among other applications, tool results can be used in studies to: predict locations and geometries of best/worst case performance, design GPS constellations, determine optimal user antenna location and understand performance trends among various users...|$|E
30|$|Because of its {{flexibility}} and low complexity, the RIPS {{has been applied}} for various scenarios. One {{of which is to}} track mobile nodes [11 – 13]. In [11], a mobile node tracking system based on the RIPS called <b>inTrack</b> is proposed to analyze the effects of velocity and moderate outdoor multipath on the system performance. The system is further improved in [12] by incorporating a Doppler shift into location estimation. Their experimental results show a mean absolute error (MAE) of 37 cm. Also taking a Doppler shift into account and using an extended Kalman filter, a tracking system based on the RIPS yields the MAE of 1.68 m in a field test [13]. Another extension of the RIPS is its implementation at a different frequency band. Formerly, the RIPS is implemented on CC 1000 RF transceiver [14] at the frequency band below 1 GHz. However, in [15, 16], the RIPS is implemented on CC 2430 transceivers [17], which operate at 2.4 GHz. Due to lack of fine-frequency tuning capability of the CC 2430 platform, an inherent offset of local oscillators is used for the frequency difference, resulting in the MAE of 1.5 – 2 m [15]. Using the same platform, a stochastic RIPS (SRIPS) [16] is proposed to improve the accuracy at 2.4 GHz by taking into account some stochastic properties of Q-range measurements.|$|E
40|$|The main {{objectives}} {{of this research}} study were to address the internal orientation of highresolution sensors, and to perform an inflight calibration of the SPOT 5 HRS/HRG and Formosat 2 RSI lenses. The other objectives were to evaluate the impacts of this inflight calibration on the sensor orientations and elevation extraction. Stereoextracted elevations were compared to accurate Lidar elevation data. Since the 3 D multisensor geometric modelling used in the autocalibration already corrects some of the lens distortions, only the remaining radial and decentering distortions were addressed. The first results on the lens distortion computation and evaluation have shown that (i) the radial symmetric and asymmetric distortions for SPOT 5 HRS and (ii) only the radial symmetric distortions for Formosat 2 RSI have to be corrected {{in order to achieve}} subpixel planimetric accuracy in the sensors orientation. The second results on the stereoextraction of elevations demonstrated few improvements on their accuracy (less than 0. 5 m) for SPOT 5 HRS due to the centred and aligned location of CCDs in the xaxis focal plane, while the elevation parallax with <b>intrack</b> stereoscopy is in the yaxis. On the other hand, the yaxis component of radial distortions with Formosat 2 RSI due to its excentred location in the focal plane generated elevation errors (5 m and more), which were then corrected by the autocalibration process. Finally, if subpixel accuracy (planimetry and elevation) is not requested for specific applications, the lens calibration could be neglected without degrading the final results at the pixel level. However, the autocalibration process should be always performed for DEM and orthoimage generation in mountainous areas because the radial distortions affect the sensor orientation (few pixels) ...|$|E
