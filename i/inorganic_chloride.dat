In waste incineration, large amounts of publicity and concern surrounded dioxin-like compounds during the 1980s-1990s continues to pervade the public consciousness, especially when new incineration and waste-to-energy facilities are proposed. As a result of these concerns, incineration processes have been improved with increased combustion temperatures (over 1000 °C), better furnace control, and sufficient residence time allotted to ensure complete oxidation of organic compounds. Ideally, an incineration process oxidizes all carbon to CO2 and converts all chlorine to HCl or <b>inorganic</b> <b>chlorides</b> prior to the gases passing through the temperature window of 700-400 °C where PCDD/F formation is possible.

40|$|Total organic halogen (TOX) {{is used as}} a {{parameter}} {{to screen}} groundwater samples at the Hanford Site. Trending is done for each groundwater well, and changes in TOX and other screening parameters can lead to costly changes in the monitoring protocol. The Waste Sampling and Characterization Facility (WSCF) analyzes groundwater samples for TOX using the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) SW- 846 method 9020 B (EPA 1996 a). Samples from the Soil and Groundwater Remediation Project (S&GRP) are submitted to the WSCF for analysis without information regarding the source of the sample; each sample is in essence a 'blind' sample to the laboratory. Feedback from the S&GRP indicated that some of the WSCF-generated TOX data from groundwater wells had a number of outlier values based on the historical trends (Anastos 2008 a). Additionally, analysts at WSCF observed inconsistent TOX results among field sample replicates. Therefore, the WSCF lab performed an investigation of the TOX analysis to determine the cause of the outlier data points. Two causes were found that contributed to generating out-of-trend TOX data: (1) The presence of <b>inorganic</b> <b>chloride</b> in the groundwater samples: at <b>inorganic</b> <b>chloride</b> concentrations greater than about 10 parts per million (ppm), apparent TOX values increase with increasing chloride concentration. A parallel observation is the increase in apparent breakthrough of TOX from the first to the second activated-carbon adsorption tubes with increasing <b>inorganic</b> <b>chloride</b> concentration. (2) During the sample preparation step, excessive purging of the adsorption tubes with oxygen pressurization gas after sample loading may cause channeling in the activated-carbon bed. This channeling leads to poor removal of <b>inorganic</b> <b>chloride</b> during the subsequent wash step with aqueous potassium nitrate. The presence of this residual <b>inorganic</b> <b>chloride</b> then produces erroneously high TOX values. Changes in sample preparation were studied to more effectively remove <b>inorganic</b> <b>chloride</b> from the activated carbon adsorption tubes. With the TOX sample preparation equipment and TOX analyzers at WSCF, the nitrate wash recommended by EPA SW- 846 method 9020 B was found to be inadequate to remove <b>inorganic</b> <b>chloride</b> interference. Increasing the nitrate wash concentration from 10 grams per liter (g/L) to 100 g/L potassium nitrate and increasing the nitrate wash volume from 3 milliliters (mL) to 10 mL effectively removed the <b>inorganic</b> <b>chloride</b> up to at least 100 ppm chloride in the sample matrix. Excessive purging of the adsorption tubes during sample preparation was eliminated. These changes in sample preparation have been incorporated in the analytical procedure. The results using the revised sample preparation procedure show better agreement of TOX values both for replicate analyses of single samples and for the analysis of replicate samples acquired from the same groundwater well. Furthermore, less apparent column breakthrough now occurs with the revised procedure. One additional modification made to sample preparation was to discontinue the treatment of groundwater samples with sodium bisulfite. Sodium bisulfite is used to remove inorganic chlorine from the sample; inorganic chlorine is not expected to be a constituent in these groundwater samples. Several other factors were also investigated as possible sources of anomalous TOX results: (1) Instrument instability: examination of the history of results for TOX laboratory control samples and initial calibration verification standards indicate good long-term precision for the method and instrument. Determination of a method detection limit of 2. 3 ppb in a deionized water matrix indicates the method and instrumentation have good stability and repeatability. (2) Non-linear instrument response: the instrument is shown to have good linear response from zero to 200 parts per billion (ppb) TOX. This concentration range encompasses the majority of samples received at WSCF for TOX analysis. (3) Improper sample preservation: ion-chromatographic analysis of several samples with anomalous TOX results revealed that the samples were properly preserved with sulfuric acid and not hydrochloric acid...|$|E

The observed range from day 10 to day 146 of reactor operation was 0.282 – 0.315 with 0.295 as the average ratio and 0.294 as the median value, indicating very little fluctuation in dehalogenation of 2 -CP during the study period.|$|E

METHODS: The analytical method included sealed-tube combustion of organochlorines, precipitation and subsequent conversion of formed <b>inorganic</b> <b>chlorides</b> into methyl chloride (CH 3 Cl) for the determination of delta Cl- 37 values by Dual-Inlet Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry (DI-IRMS). A sample preparation step most sensitive to the sample size dissolution of the <b>inorganic</b> copper <b>chlorides</b> formed by combustion of organochlorines - was identified. RESULTS: Recovery of 94 +/- 5 % of chlorine was reached by applying determined optimal conditions for the dissolution, implying good external precision of delta Cl- 37 values (- 0. 18 +/- 0. 03 %, 1 s, n = 3). Validation of the optimized method by the analysis of the produced and initial CH 3 Cl samples with known delta Cl- 37 values vs SMOC resulted in a difference of 0. 11 +/- 0. 04 % (1 s, n = 3), confirming the external precision and accuracy of the entire method. CONCLUSIONS: The efficiency of the sample preparation method for CH 3 Cl-DI-IRMS analysis is independent both of the chemical structure of the chlorinated compound and of the amount of chlorine in the sample. This method {{has the potential to be}} applied to a broad range of chlorinated organic compounds, e. g. reference material for the calibration of methods for Cl-CSIA against SMOC...|$|R
