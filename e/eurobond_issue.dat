We examine {{the determinants of}} underwriter spreads in straight/fixed rate <b>Eurobonds</b> <b>issued</b> by US firms over the 1990 - 1998 period, and find no evidence of clustering around a single spread.

Consistent with the theoretical models of Chemmanur and Pulghieri (1994) and Puri (1999), underwriter spreads {{are directly related to}} underwriter reputation. Proxies for agency costs including issuer/underwriter relationship strength and underwriter domicile also have a significant role.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a comprehensive {{analysis of the}} determinants for the optimal choice of contract terms on <b>Eurobonds</b> <b>issued</b> by UK companies. We examine predictions of extant theories that associate the choice of debt features namely, maturity, call options, convertible options, and protective covenants to firm and market characteristics. Like in Correia (2003), a simultaneous equations approach is adopted to test the alternative use of contract features for mitigating debt-contracting costs. The evidence provides strong support to the prediction that both callable and short-term debt and convertible and debt with protective covenants are used as alternative control devises to mitigate agency costs. Further evidence suggests, however, that contrary to the fundamentals guiding the choice of maturity and callability structures, the use of conversion options and protective covenants in Eurobond contracts seems {{to be determined by}} equity agency costs rather than debt agency costs. Also, some support is found for the risk uncertainty theory underlying the use of convertibles and for liquidity risk arguments regarding the choice to include protective covenants. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between capital structure, managerial equity ownership, corporate governance, and firm value in firms suspected of having ‘extreme’ agency problems. Overall, we find that leverage {{plays a role in}} mitigating the problems that result from the separation of control rights from cash flow rights and a lack of corporate governance. Our results also suggest the wealth effect of leverage is confined to specific forms of debt capital and depends upon key firm- and market-specific characteristics. We find that firms headquartered in emerging markets experience average positive abnormal returns of 68 basis points during renewal or reissue of internationally-syndicated term loans. With the exception of initial <b>Eurobond</b> <b>issues,</b> no other form of debt capital, including domestic bonds or Yankee bonds, creates value for outside shareholders of these firms. Moreover, the wealth effect of syndicated term loans is confined to those firms in which management undertakes large ‘discretionary’ expenditures and has levered their cash flow rights into larger control rights through indirect holdings (i. e. pyramids). Finally, our research suggests that cross-sectional studies can lead to false inferences when testing theories tha...|$|R
40|$|The Basel Committee for Banking Supervision {{designed}} {{a system of}} risk weights (the so called standardised approach) to measure the riskiness of banksÂ’ loan portfolios. Its ability to adequately reflect risk is empirically investigated in this paper, through {{an analysis of the}} economic capital allocations implied in corporate bond spreads. This is based on a unique dataset of issuance spreads, ratings and other relevant bond variables (such as maturity, face value, time of issuance and currency of denomination) including 7, 232 <b>eurobonds</b> <b>issued</b> mostly by Canadian, European, Japanese and U. S. companies during 1991 - 2003. Three main results emerge. First, the spread/rating relationship is strongly significant with spreads increasing when ratings worsen. Second, the estimated spreads per rating class indicate that the risk/rating relationship might be steeper than the one approved by the Basel Committee. Finally the difference between the spread/rating relation of banks and non-financial firms appears quite blurred and statistically questionable. Following this empirical evidence, we underline some adjustments in the standardised approach risk-weights that might be considered for the future versions of the Basel Accord. eurobonds, credit ratings, spreads, capital regulation, banks. ...|$|R

But, after 1945, the allies enshrined a separation of powers between the banks and the German state {{in order to prevent}} the return of the ‘creative economics’ of the Weimar era: The German constitution demands political leaders govern collectively, sharing responsibilities – often in coalitions – rather than allowing the Chancellor to dominate. The Bundesbank considers itself constitutionally bound to prevent the ECB gaining too much power through intervention in the Eurozone financial crisis, a scheme denounced by Jens Weidemann, head of the Bundesbank, as very dangerous: ‘since it would give politicians access to the ECB’s currency printing press – normally only allowed to central bankers’ (Spiegel 2011). The Central Bank’s caution {{is a product of the}} cataclysmic consequences of 1920 s Germany where the entire society was wracked by massive economic insecurity, as the rulers of Europe demanded reparations, which the economy could not deliver.

40|$|This thesis covers two {{important}} fields in financial mathematics, namely the continuous time portfolio optimisation and credit risk modelling. We analyse optimisation problems of portfolios of Call and Put options {{on the stock}} and/or the zero coupon bond issued by a firm with default risk. We use the martingale approach for dynamic optimisation problems. Our findings show that the riskier the option gets, the less proportion of his wealth the investor allocates to the risky asset. Further, we analyse the Credit Default Swap (CDS) market quotes on the <b>Eurobonds</b> <b>issued</b> by Turkish sovereign for building the term structure of the sovereign credit risk. Two methods are introduced and compared for bootstrapping the risk-neutral probabilities of default (PD) in an intensity based (or reduced form) credit risk modelling approach. We compare the market-implied PDs with the actual PDs reported by credit rating agencies based on historical experience. Our results highlight the market price of the sovereign credit risk depending on the assigned rating category in the sampling period. Finally, we find an optimal leverage strategy for delivering the payments promised by a Constant Proportion Debt Obligation (CPDO). The problem is solved via the introduction and explicit solution of a stochastic control problem by transforming the related Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Equation into its dual. Contrary to the industry practise, the optimal leverage function we derive is a non-linear function of the CPDO asset value. The simulations show promising behaviour of the optimal leverage function compared with the one popular among practitioners...|$|R
