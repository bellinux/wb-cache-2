Despina has been revealed to be the notary, and the sisters realize they have been duped.

With the state’s reinvestment in higher education, the CSU is restoring its employee ranks and currently employs {{a record number of}} instructional faculty. Between 2010 and 2015, the number of CSU faculty increased by 3,500, but the number of tenure track faculty declined by 150, leaving the CSU system with its lowest percentage of tenure track faculty (39%) in the schools' history. In the two years (2013–14, 2014–15) through the state’s reinvestment, the CSU has directed $129.6 million to enhance employee compensation.

40|$|Based on {{a sample}} of 104 countries, we {{document}} four key stylized facts regarding the interaction between capital flows, fiscal policy, and monetary policy. First, net capital inflows are procyclical (i. e., external borrowing increases in <b>good</b> <b>times</b> <b>and</b> falls in <b>bad</b> <b>times)</b> in most OECD and developing countries. Second, fiscal policy is procyclical (i. e., government spending increases in <b>good</b> <b>times</b> <b>and</b> falls in <b>bad</b> <b>times)</b> {{for the majority of}} developing countries. Third, for emerging markets, monetary policy appears to be procyclical (i. e., policy rates are lowered in <b>good</b> <b>times</b> <b>and</b> raised in <b>bad</b> <b>times).</b> Fourth, in developing countries - and particularly for emerging markets - periods of capital inflows are associated with expansionary macroeconomic policies and periods of capital outflows with contractionary macroeconomic policies. In such countries, therefore, when it rains, it does indeed pour. ...|$|R

They gain their food, not by hunting and fishing, but by toil at colossal artifices. For the most part, they suffer from lack of shelter. The greater number of them are vilely housed, do not have enough fuel to keep them warm, and are insufficiently clothed.
