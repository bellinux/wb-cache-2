5000|$|Linear plasma railguns place extreme {{demands on}} their insulators, as {{they must be}} an {{electrically}} insulating, plasma-facing vacuum component which can withstand both thermal and acoustic shocks. Additionally, a complex triple <b>joint</b> <b>seal</b> may exist at the breech of the bore, which can often pose an extreme engineering challenge. Coaxial accelerators require insulators only at the breech, but the plasma armature in that case {{is subject to the}} [...] "blow-by" [...] instability. This is an instability in which the magnetic pressure front can out-run or [...] "blow-by" [...] the plasma armature due to the radial dependence of acceleration current density, drastically reducing device efficiency. Coaxial accelerators use various techniques to mitigate this instability. In either design, a plasma armature is formed at the breech. As plasma railguns are an open area of research, the method of armature formation varies. However, techniques including exploding foils, gas cell burst disk injection, neutral gas injection via fast gas valve, and plasma capillary injection have been employed.|$|E

It was a black SOF unit, whose primary objective was of capturing or killing senior leadership and HVT within both al-Qaeda and the Taliban. TF Sword was initially structure around a two-squadron component of operators from Delta Force (Task Force Green) and DEVGRU (Task Force Blue) supported by a Ranger protection force teams (Task Force Red) and ISA signals intercept and surveillance operators (Task Force Orange) and the 160th SOAR (Task Force Brown). The British Special Boat Service was integrated directly into Swords structure; some other coalition special forces were attached to TF Sword to support specific operations. On 19 October 2001, a Delta Force squadron from TF Sword carried out a mission known as Objective Gecko whose objective was to kill or capture the Taliban leader Mullah Omar, they didn't find the HVT and along with supporting Rangers—engaged in a heavy firefight, killing 30 Taliban fighters whilst suffering a dozen casualties.

40|$|LecturePg. 65 - 78 A 16 {{megawatt}} ethylene drive {{steam turbine}} built in 1973 experienced rub related startup vibration problems for many years.

40|$|International audienceWe {{investigate}} {{the strength and}} failure properties of a model cemented granular material under simple compressive deformation.

Several samples are prepared for different volume fractions of the matrix, controlling the porosity, and silicone coating upon which depends the effective particle-matrix adhesion. Interestingly, the compressive strength {{is found to be}} an affine function of the product of the matrix volume fraction and effective particle-matrix adhesion. On the other hand, it is shown that particle damage occurs beyond a critical value of the contact debonding energy. The experiments suggest three regimes of crack propagation corresponding to no particle damage, particle abrasion and particle fragmentation, respectively, depending on the matrix volume fraction and effective particle-matrix adhesion.

40|$|Joint leakage {{from low}} {{pressure}} natural gas distribution mains (typical value: 0. 25 ft[superscript 3] at 6 inwg gas pressure) is a persistent source of maintenance problems for utitlites. External encapsulation {{is the usual}} choice for repairing leaking joints. It is reliable and expensive, about $ 1000 per joint (80 % of which is for excavation and resurfacing). Consolidated Edison of New York is sponsoring a project to develop a cheap and reliable <b>joint</b> <b>seal.</b> No current sealing methods {{were found to be}} acceptable in Phase I. Adhesion failures between the seal and pipe were a major cause of seal failure. Preliminary Phase II research recommended the development of an internal mechanical seal. Such a seal would minimize excavation and eliminate adhesion failures. To complete Phase II, an internal mechanical seal was developed. The initial research indicated that cleaning of the pipe interior had to be minimized or eliminated. Testing demonstrated that a sealant, either asphalt or vulcanizing silicone, greatly enhanced the sealing of uncleaned pipes, while permitting low stress levels. This {{led to the development of}} a new internal mechanical seal concept for sealing uncleaned gas main joints. Joint tests of 2 injected silicone seal concepts were run. The Type 1 seal, which filled the joint recess, completely sealed an uncleaned pipe joint. The Type 2 seal, which spanned the joint recess with an elastomeric bridge, had a leak rate of 0. 000038 ft[superscript 3]/hr at 6 inwg gas pressure from an uncleaned joint. The leakage was caused by permiability of the silicone bridge. These flexible and compliant seals, clamped in place with retaining bands, provide mechanical support for the sealant throughout the seal life, and thus do not rely on adhesion...|$|E

40|$|Selective Area Laser Deposition (SALD) is a gas-phase, solid {{freeform}} fabrication (SFF) process that utilizes a laser-driven, pyrolytic gas reaction to form a desired solid product. This solid product only forms in the heated zone of the laser beam and thus can be selectively deposited by control of the laser position. SALD Joining employs the SALD method to accomplish ‘welding’ of ceramic structures together. The solid reaction product serves as a filler material to bond the two parts. ^ The challenges involved with ceramic joining center around {{the lack of a}} liquid phase, little plastic deformation and diffusivity and poor surface wetting for many ceramic materials. Due to these properties, traditional metal welding procedures cannot be applied to ceramics. Most alternative ceramic welding techniques use some form of a metal addition to overcome these material limitations. However, the metal possesses a lower ultimate use temperature than the ceramic substrate and therefore it decreases the temperature range over which the joined part can be safely used. SALD Joining enjoys several advantages over these ceramic welding procedures. The solid filler material chemistry can be tailored to match the type of ceramic substrate and therefore fabricate monolithic joints. The SALD filler material bonds directly to the substrate and the joined structure is made in a one step process, without any post-processing. ^ The research documented in this dissertation focused on SALD Joining of silicon carbide structures with silicon carbide filler material. A historical progression of gas-phase SFF research and a literature review of the most prominent ceramic joining techniques are provided. A variety of SiC substrates were examined, as were various conditions of gas precursor pressures and mixtures, laser beam scan speed and joint configuration. The SALD material was characterized for composition and structure by x-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance. Successful joints were measured for mechanical bend strength, hermeticity of the <b>joint</b> <b>seal</b> and microhardness of the filler material. The SALD joints were evaluated based on comparisons to monolithic tube properties. The difficulties associated with SALD Joining are discussed as well. ...|$|E
40|$|The Drescher Inlet is a 25 km long {{crack in}} the Riiser-Larsen Ice Shelf, eastern Weddell Sea, and is {{characterized}} by a stable fast ice layer. The fast ice represents an attractive habitat for Weddell seals, aggregating along the tidal cracks of the inlet in numbers of ca. 200 – 300 individuals. Multiple field campaigns aimed to investigate the seals’ diving behaviour and foraging ecology in relation to their environment. A recent <b>joint</b> <b>seal</b> and ROV project was focussed on the investigation of the cryo-benthic community underneath the floating ice shelf of the Drescher Inlet, which were previously detected by seal-borne cameras, and 3 D-multi-channel dive loggers (Watanabe et al. 2006; Liebsch et al. 2007). Images show dense aggregations of isopods that likely represent an attractive food horizon, where seals could benefit from a local hotspot of high biological productivity. This context triggered a retrospective analysis of available high-resolution dive profile data to identify within-dive hunting phases and correlate those to the local physical environment. A total of 34 adult Weddell seals were instrumented with different types of dive loggers (time-depth recorders, digital still image loggers) in the course of six summer field campaigns between 1990 and 2016. Dive profiles were zero-offset corrected to reduce noise in the dataset and subsequently only dives deeper than 20 m were regarded as ‘true’ dives, accounting for the thickness of the local fast ice and platelet ice layer. An automated broken stick algorithm (Heerah et al. 2014) was used to separate the dive into different segments. Segments with a high sinuosity were considered to indicate hunting. Segments characterized by a straight dive trajectories (low sinuosity), were assumed to be transit phases with no hunting behaviour. A tri-modal distribution of mean hunting depths suggests that Weddell seals concentrated their foraging activities in three depth strata. A peak in hunting depths below 370 m corresponds to the sea floor of the Drescher Inlet, indicating demersal foraging. A second peak between 110 and 160 m matches with the depth of the underside of the floating ice shelf, which suggests shelf ice associated foraging. The third peak probably represents hunting in the pelagic realm. Our investigation highlights the importance of the shelf ice underside as an attractive food horizon for Weddell seals suggesting a re-evaluation of trophic interactions and bentho-pelagic processes in the coastal Antarctic ecosystem...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on {{mechanical}} loads and moisture related problems with a potential to critically harm the functionality of pre-insulated district heating pipes and pipe joints. Directly buried pipeline bends are investigated with respect to limiting deformations from a thermally induced lateral displacement. A new approach is introduced; stating that very large deformations of the insulation foam are tolerable as long as overheating of the casing pipe is avoided. A local increase in heat losses and loss of axial shear stiffness is not critical, but a too high temperature will accelerate the rate of deterioration of the polyethylene material. Measurements indicate that the earth pressures required to reach critical deformations {{are not likely to}} develop in regularly compacted backfill materials. Problems related to backfilling with reused excavated soil containing coarse-grained materials are of particular interest. The lifetime implications from large stones causing deep indentations in the casing pipe wall are studied. A conceptual framework for the force interaction between a laterally displaced pipe and a stone adjacent to it is presented, along with tests on the long-term strength of severely strained polyethylene. The risk for obtaining deep indentations depends on the compaction of the backfill, and is greatest in materials compacted to "ordinary" levels. There is an obvious temperature dependence in the expected lifetime. To avoid the combination of indentations and an elevated casing pipe temperature, compaction of backfill material containing large stones should be avoided around pipeline bends. The strength of pipe joints to axial movements through coarse-grained backfill material is studied experimentally. It is concluded that electro-fusion welded sleeves are superior to other types. But with a simple external protection, consisting of a polyethylene net, the much cheaper single-sealed non-shrinking sleeve can be used in very tough backfill materials. The consequences of a leaking <b>joint</b> <b>seal</b> are investigated experimentally and analytically. Homogeneous and defect-free PUR foam will act as a moisture barrier, protecting the medium pipe from water. Air-gaps or voids in the foam may promote an inflow of groundwater by a "breathing effect" caused by temperature variations. Hence in order to improve the performance of the joints, efforts should be made to develop the methods for foam injection to ensure a complete filling of the joint space. Vapour diffusion in plastics pipes heating systems and in cooling systems is studied analytically. In heating systems with polyethylene medium pipes, vapour will diffuse outward and possibly condensate and accumulate in the colder parts of the insulation foam. Calculations indicate that the increase in heat losses during the first 50 years of service is about 25 - 30 %. In cooling pipes, vapour passing in from saturated soil will condense in the colder insulation. Simplified calculations show that condensation of water starts almost immediately...|$|E

40|$|The {{government}} of the Czech Republic decided that in the location {{to the west of}} Prague, capital city of the Czech Republic, some deep mines should be closed because of their low efficiency of coal mined i. e. small amounts and low quality of the coal extracted in the final stage of mining. The locations near Prague influenced the decision to do maintenance on the abandoned mines, as the thread of soil pollution was unacceptably high in the neighborhood of the capital city. Before the mines were closed it was necessary to separate existed extensive horizontal location of salt water below a clay layer in order not to deteriorate the upper fresh water. The salt water could not be allowed to pollute the upper layer with the fresh water, as many wells in villages in the neighborhood of the former mines would be contaminated. Two horizontal clay layers (an insulator and a semi-insulator) separated the two horizons containing salt water and fresh water. Before starting deep mining, vertical shafts had to be constructed with concrete linings to enable the miners to access the depths. The salt water was draining away throughout the existence of the mine. The drainage was designed very carefully to avoid possible infiltration of salt water into the upper horizon. Before the mines were abandoned it was necessary to prevent contact between the two kinds of waters in the shafts. Several options were put forward, the most efficient of which appeared to be one that proposed filling the shafts with spoil soil and creating a <b>joint</b> <b>seal</b> made of disparate material at the interface between the salt water and fresh water to create a reliable stopper. The material for the spoil soil was delivered from deposits located not far from the shafts. This material consisted of a variety of grains of sand, big boulders of slate, slaty clay, sandstone, etc [...] Chemical admixtures were considered to improve the flocculation of the filling material. The stopper was positioned at a depth of 220 – 300 m below the terrain. As an alternative, thinner stoppers were considered, but this option was discarded. The aim {{of this paper is to}} describe the design of the stoppers applied to separate the two types of water along the contact horizon using Desai’s DSC theory (Distinct State Concept), and generalized plane strain in the multiphase problem of water flow in a porous medium. In addition, a comparison of some results from scale experimental models with numerical solutions was carried out. The intrinsic material properties of stoppers for numerical computations were obtained from physical and chemical laboratory tests. The models were evaluated for the complete underground work, particularly in its final stage of construction. ...|$|E
