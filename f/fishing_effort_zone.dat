40|$|A {{mathematical}} model is developed to represent an idealized system {{of a shared}} fish stock associated with different exclusive economic zones. We apply such model on small pelagic fisheries shared between Southern Morocco, Mauritania and the Senegambia. The complete model {{is a set of}} six ordinary differential equations describing the time evolution of the fish biomass and the <b>fishing</b> <b>effort</b> in the three zones. The fish species targeted as small pelagics could be consid- ered to perform quick displacement between the different zones, in comparison to their growth and harvesting. We take advantage of the two time scales to obtain a reduced model governing the total fish biomass of the system and <b>fishing</b> <b>efforts</b> in each <b>zone.</b> We study existence and stability of equilibrium points of the reduced model. The simulations show {{that as a result of}} competition between fisheries per zone there can only be one winner in the general case. Nevertheless there is also an arising case that allows an operational management of shared fisheries by acting on the cost of <b>fishing</b> unit <b>effort,</b> indeed we found that a large number of equilibrium exist. From this last case the initial distribution of <b>fishing</b> <b>effort</b> strongly impact the optimal equilibrium that can be reached. Lastly the model report that the country with the highest carrying capacity density may get less landings when collaborating with other countries than if it minimise its fishing costs.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of marine protected areas {{depends largely on}} whether people comply with the rules. We quantified temporal changes in benthic composition, reef fish biomass, and <b>fishing</b> <b>effort</b> among marine park zones (including no-take areas) to assess levels of compliance following the 2005 rezoning of the government-controlled Karimunjawa National Park (KNP), Indonesia. Four years after the rezoning awareness of fishing regulations was high amongst local fishers, ranging from 79. 5 ± 7. 9 (SE) % for spatial restrictions to 97. 7 ± 1. 2 % for bans {{on the use of}} poisons. Despite this high awareness and strong compliance with gear restrictions, compliance with spatial restrictions was weak. In the four years following the rezoning reef fish biomass declined across all zones within KNP, with > 50 % reduction within the no-take Core and Protection Zones. These declines were primarily driven by decreases in the biomass of groups targeted by local fishers; planktivores, herbivores, piscivores, and invertivores. These declines in fish biomass were not driven by changes in habitat quality; coral cover increased in all zones, possibly {{as a result of a}} shift in fishing gears from those which can damage reefs (i. e., nets) to those which cause little direct damage (i. e., handlines and spears). Direct observations of fishing activities in 2009 revealed there was limited variation in <b>fishing</b> <b>effort</b> between <b>zones</b> in which fishing was allowed or prohibited. The apparent willingness of the KNP communities to comply with gear restrictions, but not spatial restrictions is difficult to explain and highlights the complexities of the social and economic dynamics that influence the ecological success of marine protected areas. Clearly the increased and high awareness of fishery restrictions following the rezoning is a positive step. The challenge now is to understand and foster the conditions that may facilitate compliance with spatial restrictions within KNP and marine parks worldwide. © 2012 Campbell et al...|$|R

In order to estimate the annual effective <b>fishing</b> <b>effort</b> on hake, a relational data base including daily landings by vessel and species of trawl fleet based on the port of Palma, Mallorca island (western Mediterranean) during the period 1983 - 1991 was built.

According to parameters values, three main cases can occur: (i) a stable fishery free equilibrium, (ii) a stable persistent fishery equilibrium and (iii) coexistence of three strictly positive equilibria, two of them being stable separated by a saddle.
