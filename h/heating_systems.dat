40|$|AbstractA new {{district}} heating method combined {{with hot water}} driven ground source absorption heat pump to extract shallow geothermal was put forward, and the district <b>heating</b> <b>system</b> provides hot water for the driven heat source of the absorption heat pump. By the primary energy efficiency and economical analysis method, research results show that compared with the conventional district <b>heating</b> <b>system,</b> the <b>heating</b> capacity of the new district <b>heating</b> <b>system</b> can be greatly improved and the heating costs can be largely reduced without expanding the capacity of district <b>heating</b> <b>system</b> and increasing other energy consumption. Also, compared with electric-driven ground source <b>heat</b> pump <b>heating</b> <b>system,</b> the new district <b>heating</b> <b>system</b> utilized high temperature water as the driven heating resource to replace the high grade electricity, which can improve significantly the energy utilization efficiency and decrease sharply the power consumption. Compared with electric-driven ground source <b>heat</b> pump <b>heating</b> <b>system</b> on the same heat quantity condition, the new district <b>heating</b> <b>system</b> {{has the advantage of}} lower first energy consumption and smaller size of underground heat exchanger and the smaller heat extraction during winter period which was conducive to achieve winter and summer heat balance...|$|R
5|$|Solar <b>heating</b> <b>systems</b> are a {{well known}} second-generation {{technology}} and generally consist of solar thermal collectors, a fluid system {{to move the}} heat from the collector to its point of usage, and a reservoir or tank for heat storage. The systems may be used to heat domestic hot water, swimming pools, or homes and businesses. The heat can also be used for industrial process applications or as an energy input for other uses such as cooling equipment.|$|E
5|$|Direct {{geothermal}} <b>heating</b> <b>systems</b> contain {{pumps and}} compressors, which may consume energy from a polluting source. This parasitic load is normally {{a fraction of}} the heat output, so it is always less polluting than electric heating. However, if the electricity is produced by burning fossil fuels, then the net emissions of geothermal heating may be comparable to directly burning the fuel for heat. For example, a geothermal heat pump powered by electricity from a combined cycle natural gas plant would produce about as much pollution as a natural gas condensing furnace of the same size. Therefore, the environmental value of direct geothermal heating applications is highly dependent on the emissions intensity of the neighboring electric grid.|$|E
5|$|Electric {{lighting}} {{was installed}} in 1938 and an outer door for the north porch added in 1962. Major renovations were carried out from 1981 to 1983; these comprised repairs to the north aisle roof and the east tower, plastering and limewashing of the chancel, replacement of the old electrical and <b>heating</b> <b>systems,</b> and minor work on the organ. The most recent round of restoration was the 2000 reflooring of the nave, installation of a vestry, toilet and kitchen, a new heating system with a detached boiler house, and reglazing of the north porch. Because of the remoteness of the altar from the congregation, a second altar was erected between the parclose screens (extensions forward from {{the ends of the}} rood screen) to enable a more intimate celebration of the Eucharist. St Nicholas was designated as a Grade I listed building in 1959, which recognizes it as a building of exceptional interest.|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the mining}} of iron ore {{by the local}} mining {{industry}} (LKAB) a deformation zone is approaching the town of Kiruna, which is situated {{in the north of}} Sweden. The town is going through an urban transformation and parts of the town is about to be relocated. The relocating of the town is affecting all the infrastructure of the town, one of those is the district <b>heating</b> <b>system.</b> The aim {{of this paper is to}} apply a process integration method to study how the existing district <b>heating</b> <b>system</b> is behaving and to create a model for the whole district <b>heating</b> <b>system.</b> The district <b>heating</b> <b>system</b> in the town has a complex design with several loops. When dealing with modeling of a district <b>heating</b> <b>system</b> there are two methods that are most common, the Danish- and the German methods. These methods allow for simplification of the network shape, still with good accuracy in system behavior compared to real system behavior. A disadvantage with these two methods is that they cannot handle a district <b>heating</b> <b>system</b> that contains loops without making changes compared to the real physical system. A method that allows modeling of loops in the district <b>heating</b> <b>system</b> has been developed, using the remind-software. This method makes it possible to analyze how loops in the district <b>heating</b> <b>system</b> are behaving, without making physical changes when modeling the district <b>heating</b> <b>system.</b> The model will be used as a default model for redesigning the district <b>heating</b> <b>system</b> when moving the town. It will also be used to optimize heat deliveries from LKAB district <b>heating</b> <b>system</b> and for analyzing the possibility for seasonal storage of waste energy from LKAB and municipality energy company TVAB or how new heat production plants should optimized. In this paper the method is described and applied in order to model the whole present district <b>heating</b> <b>system</b> for the town. Godkänd; 2012; 20140305 (matves...|$|R
5|$|However, by the mid-1980s, {{reliability}} {{had become}} such a problem (even on the slower Harrisburg corridor) that trains of Metroliners were often towed by locomotives. On January 25, 1988, Amtrak began towing all Metroliner cars on the Keystone Service with AEM-7 locomotives rather than running them under their own power, although the cars had their pantographs up to power lighting and <b>heating</b> <b>systems.</b> A wreck of the Washington-Boston Night Owl four days later in Chester, Pennsylvania took two AEM-7 locomotives out of commission, exacerbating a shortage of electric motive power available to Amtrak. On February 1, Amtrak converted all Keystone Service trains to diesel power and terminated them on the lower level of 30th Street Station in Philadelphia, as diesel-powered trains were not allowed in the tunnels to Suburban Station. The Metroliners continued {{to be used as}} coaches for several years before being replaced by Amfleet cars.|$|E

5|$|In total, {{electrical}} plant {{construction and}} well drilling cost about €2–5million perMW of electrical capacity, while the break–even price is 0.04–0.10€ perkW·h. Enhanced geothermal systems {{tend to be}} on the high side of these ranges, with capital costs above $4million perMW and break–even above $0.054 perkW·h in 2007. Direct heating applications can use much shallower wells with lower temperatures, so smaller systems with lower costs and risks are feasible. Residential geothermal heat pumps with a capacity of 10kilowatt (kW) are routinely installed for around $1–3,000 perkilowatt. District <b>heating</b> <b>systems</b> may benefit from economies of scale if demand is geographically dense, as in cities and greenhouses, but otherwise piping installation dominates capital costs. The capital cost of one such district heating system in Bavaria was estimated at somewhat over 1million€ perMW. Direct systems of any size are much simpler than electric generators and have lower maintenance costs perkW·h, but they must consume electricity to run pumps and compressors. Some governments subsidize geothermal projects.|$|E
