5|$|Sharks {{are often}} killed for shark fin soup. Fishermen capture live sharks, fin them, and dump the finless animal {{back into the}} water. Shark finning {{involves}} removing the <b>fin</b> <b>with</b> a hot metal blade. The resulting immobile shark soon dies from suffocation or predators. Shark fin {{has become a major}} trade within black markets all over the world. Fins sell for about $300/lb in 2009. Poachers illegally fin millions each year. Few governments enforce laws that protect them. In 2010 Hawaii became the first U.S. state to prohibit the possession, sale, trade or distribution of shark fins. From 1996 to 2000, an estimated 38 million sharks had been killed per year for harvesting shark fins.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{radical and}} unusual shape, the {{airframe}} was built along traditional lines. Except {{for the most}} highly stressed parts, the whole structure was manufactured from standard grades of light alloy. The airframe was broken down {{into a number of}} major assemblies: the centre section, a rectangular box containing the bomb-bay and engine bays bounded by the front and rear spars and the wing transport joints; the intakes and centre fuselage; the front fuselage, incorporating the pressure cabin; the nose; the outer wings; the leading edges; the wing trailing edge and tail end of the fuselage; the wings were not sealed and used directly as fuel tankage, but carried bladders for fuel in the void spaces of the wings; and there was a single swept tail <b>fin</b> <b>with</b> a single rudder on the trailing edge.|$|E
5|$|The {{velvet belly}} is a robustly built shark with a {{moderately}} long, broad, flattened snout. The mouth has thin, smooth lips. The upper teeth are small, {{with a narrow}} central cusp and usually fewer than three pairs of lateral cusplets. The lower teeth are much larger, with a strongly slanted, blade-like cusp {{at the top and}} interlocking bases. The five pairs of gill slits are tiny, comparable in size to the spiracles. Both dorsal fins bear stout, grooved spines at the front, with the second much longer than the first and curved. The first dorsal fin originates behind the short and rounded pectoral fins; the second dorsal fin is twice the size of the first and originates behind the pelvic fins. The anal fin is absent. The tail is slender, leading to a long caudal <b>fin</b> <b>with</b> a small lower lobe and a low upper lobe with a prominent ventral notch near the tip.|$|E

5|$|Both dorsal fins are {{immediately}} preceded by stout, grooved spines, {{with the second}} much longer than the first. The small first dorsal fin has a rounded apex and a nearly straight trailing margin, with its origin lying behind the pectoral fins. The second dorsal fin is rather angular and has about double {{the area of the}} first, with its origin located opposite the midpoint of the pelvic fin bases. The pectoral fins are small and rounded. The pelvic fins are about as large as the second dorsal <b>fin,</b> <b>with</b> rounded tips and nearly straight trailing margins. The caudal peduncle is short and leads to a broad caudal fin comprising {{less than a quarter of}} the total length; the upper lobe has a convex upper margin leading to a squared-off tip, while the lower lobe is indistinct. The skin is densely covered by tiny dermal denticles; each one is recurved and thorn-like, rising from an irregular star-shaped base. This species is a plain dark brown above, darkening to almost black below, with white dorsal fin spines. Juvenile sharks have white edges on the dorsal, pectoral, and pelvic fins. Minute, luminescent dots are scattered about the skin without a regular pattern.|$|E

The tricycle undercarriage retracted into the wings and the underside of the air intake.|$|E
25|$|Mooney began {{producing}} the aircraft in 1968 as the Mooney A2-A. Next the company redesigned the fuselage {{from the cockpit}} back, with square windows behind the sliding canopy. Even as it produced the A2-A Cadet, Mooney was busy re-designing the aircraft. On February 23, 1968, the first Mooney Cadet M-10 flew. The aircraft has a single <b>fin,</b> <b>with</b> a vertical leading edge, as most Mooneys do.|$|E
25|$|The brown lanternshark has a robust, almost {{cylindrical}} {{body with a}} wide, flattened head. Around 28 tooth rows are in the upper jaw and 34 tooth rows are in the lower jaw.

25|$|A. chamaeleon can be {{differentiated}} {{from other}} members of the A. rugosus species group by shorter nasal barbels (1.06.0% length of the head vs. 6.523.9), wide-set eyes (distance between eyes 38.947·5% length of the head), and a head with gently sloping lateral margins and a broadly rounded snout when viewed dorsally. A. falcifer can be differentiated from {{other members of}} the species group by an adipose <b>fin</b> <b>with</b> a rounded (vs. angular) posterior margin and a longer dorsal-fin base (10.813.1% standard length vs. 7.910.5); generally the colour pattern of A. falcifer is also different in having many small blotches (vs. few large blotches) of various shades of brown, with many small dark brown spots (vs. no spots) on the dorsal surfaces of the head. Both A. falcifer and A. pachyderma lack serrations on the pectoral spine, but the two species can be separated based on their colouration (cream with numerous small blotches of various shades of brown in A. falcifer vs. overall cream in A. pachyderma) and the shape of the posterior margin of the adipose fin. A. pachyderma can be differentiated by its colouration (overall cream vs. generally dark brown with many irregular patches of light brown) and, except for A. falcifer, lack (vs. presence) of serrations on the posterior edge of the pectoral spine. A. rugosus differs from A. chamaeleon in having longer nasal barbels (6.515.6% head length vs. 1.06.0) and a head with steeply sloping (vs. gentlysloping) lateral margins and a convex (vs. broadly rounded) snout when viewed dorsally; from A. falcifer in having an adipose <b>fin</b> <b>with</b> an angular (vs. rounded) posterior margin; from A. pachyderma in its colouration (generally dark brown with many irregular patches of light brown vs. overall cream) and the presence (vs. lack) of serrations on the posterior edge of the pectoral spine.|$|E
25|$|The crevalle jack's colour {{ranges from}} brassy green to blue or bluish-black dorsally, {{becoming}} silvery white or golden ventrally. A dark spot is {{present on the}} pectoral <b>fin,</b> <b>with</b> a similar dark to dusky spot present on the upper margin of the operculum. Juveniles have around five dark vertical bands on their sides, with these fading at adulthood. The first dorsal fin, pectoral and pelvic fins range from white to dusky, occasionally with golden tinges throughout. The anal fin lobe is bright yellow, with {{the remainder of the}} fin ranging from golden to dusky, while the underside of the caudal peduncle often being yellow in adults. The caudal fin itself is also golden to dusky, with the lower lobe often brighter yellow than the upper, with both the lobes often having a black trailing edge.|$|E
25|$|After {{designing}} the un-built Ro I twin-engined flying boat, Rohrbach developed the Rohrbach Ro II flying boat as an all-metal shoulder winged monoplane flying boat with two tractor engines mounted in nacelles, above the wings, on struts. Planforms and profiles were kept {{as simple as}} possible with rectangular section fuselage frames (with vee planing bottoms), constant chord wings, tailplane and <b>fin</b> <b>with</b> square cut tips and distinctive protruding servo/trim/balance tabs at wing and fin tips. The two-seat open cockpit sat between the engines at the wing leading edge, with an open gunner/bosun's position at the extreme nose. A very unusual feature of several of Rohrbach's flying-boats was the provision of a pair of masts and sails to be rigged in the event of engine failure to allow the aircraft to be sailed back to safety.|$|E
50|$|This genus is {{most closely}} related to the genus Bagroides. In turn, these two genera are most {{closely related to}} Leiocassis. The genus can be split into two lineages. B. hypselopterus, B. macracanthus, B. majusculus, and B. vaillantii have long dorsal <b>fins</b> <b>with</b> 18 or more {{serrations}} in adults, while B. macropterus, B. micranodus, and B. obscurus have short dorsal <b>fins</b> <b>with</b> 15 or fewer serrations in adults. The first lineage is more derived, while the second lineage is more basal.|$|R
50|$|Body is discoid to oval {{with the}} anterodorsal {{slightly}} convex. Head robust and wide. Snout blunt. Preanal spine and ectopterygoid teeth absent. Adipose fin wide. Head dark or black in adults with mandibular and opercular areas dark red. Iris golden yellow {{with a dark}} transversal band. Body with methalic greyish laterally with numerous bands and spot giving a marmoled appearance. Abdominal area dark red. Ventral serrations and <b>fins</b> covered <b>with</b> dark spots. Dorsal, anal, and pelvic <b>fins</b> <b>with</b> external red rays. Adipose <b>fin</b> dark <b>with</b> several spots.|$|R
50|$|Merlangius merlangus {{has three}} dorsal <b>fins</b> <b>with</b> {{a total of}} 30 to 40 soft rays and two anal <b>fins</b> <b>with</b> 30 to 35 soft rays. The body is long and the head small and a chin barbel, if present, is very small. This fish can reach a maximum length of about 70 cm. The colour may be {{yellowish}}-brown, greenish or dark blue, the flanks yellowish grey or white and the belly silvery. There is a distinctive black blotch near the base of each pectoral fin.|$|R
25|$|The 58th Bomb Wing {{had been}} the first to deploy, {{beginning}} combat in June 1944 with only a handful of B-29's painted in the standard olive drab camouflage. Each of its four groups employed a different method while based in the China Burma India Theater as part of XX Bomber Command. The 40th BG painted four horizontal stripes across the upper tail <b>fin</b> <b>with</b> the letter identification of the airplane below it. The 444th BG numbered its aircraft and placed it within a large blue diamond outlined in yellow on the tail fin. The 462nd BG painted its rudders but otherwise did not designate the group. The 468th painted two diagonal stripes on the rudders of its aircraft. When the wing and its groups transferred to Tinian in April 1945 the 58th Wing changed to a letter-symbol system.|$|E
25|$|It first flew in 1951, and {{although}} 200 units were planned, only 65 were ever built. The Hispano engine was an upright V12 {{in contrast to}} the inverted V12 Daimler-Benz DB 601 & 605 engines used in the Bf 109. Being of compact design, it fitted the airframe of the Bf 109 well, representing it in the German 1957 film Der Stern von Afrika (The Star of Africa) about Luftwaffe ace Hans-Joachim Marseille. In the original design, an asymmetric vertical <b>fin</b> <b>with</b> an airfoiled profile had been introduced starting with the Bf 109F to produce a slight left movement of the tail, which counteracted the left-side torque reaction from the Daimler-Benz engine's counterclockwise rotation. Since this was left unchanged in the Buchón, and the Hispano V12 powered a clockwise-turning propeller instead, the combination of the airfoiled fin and the clockwise-turning propeller created a hard-to-counteract right swing on takeoff, since the fin and the propeller essentially worked in the same direction.|$|E
25|$|The fin anatomy {{is highly}} useful for {{identification}} purposes, with the species having 11 spines {{in the first}} dorsal <b>fin,</b> <b>with</b> one spine and 20 to 23 soft rays on the second dorsal fin. The anal fin has two spines with 21 to 23 soft rays posterior to the spines. Lateral line scales and cheek scales are also distinctive, with northern whiting possessing 66 to 72 lateral line scales and cheek scales positioned in 3–4 rows, {{all of which are}} ctenoid. The amount of vertebrae are also diagnostic, having 34 in total. The swim bladder is the most accurate diagnostic feature, having two posterior extensions and two anterior extensions. The two anterior extensions extend forward and diverge to end {{on each side of the}} basioccipital above the auditory capsule. Two lateral extensions also commence anteriorly, each of them sending a blind tubule anterolaterally and then extending along the abdominal wall. The lateral extensions are normally convoluted and have blind tubules arising along their length. The two posterior tapering extensions project into the caudal region, with one usually longer than the other.|$|E
