5000|$|A {{hole saw}} (also styled holesaw), {{also known as}} a <b>hole</b> <b>cutter,</b> is a saw blade of [...] (ring) shape, whose annular [...] creates a hole in the {{workpiece}} without having to cut up the core material. It is used in a drill. Hole saws typically have a pilot drill bit at their center to keep the saw teeth from walking. The fact that a hole saw creates the hole without needing to cut up the core often makes it preferable to twist drills or spade drills for relatively large holes (especially those larger than 25 mm). The same hole can be made faster and using less power.|$|E
40|$|An {{adjustable}} <b>hole</b> <b>cutter</b> {{is described}} {{for use in}} forming circular openings in workpieces. The <b>hole</b> <b>cutter</b> {{is characterized by a}} mount of a substantially planar configuration, positionable into a plane paralleling the working plane of a selected workpiece. It also contains a shaft for imparting rotary motion to the mount about an axis of rotation normally related to the working plane, a plurality of stabilizing struts for resiliently supporting the mount in parallelism with the working plane as rotary motion is imparted thereto, a drill bit for drilling a pilot hole concentric with the axis of rotation, and an elongated cutting tool adjustably seated within a radially extended slot...|$|E
40|$|The {{graphical}} domain connectivity function (GDCF) graphical interface, {{which was}} designed to address the need to simplify <b>hole</b> <b>cutter</b> shape selection and positioning in order to exploit the computational savings obtainable through the domain connectivity function (DCF) is described. GDCF was used to prepare data for the V 22 tilt-rotor geometry, and data input time was decreased by an order of magnitude. The combined use of GDCF and DCF to satisfy domain connectivity requirements for systems of overset grids is found to minimize both human and computational resources...|$|E
5000|$|In 1908, {{the union}} {{merged with the}} Ship Constructive Association and the Amalgamated Society of Drillers and <b>Hole</b> <b>Cutters,</b> and renamed itself as the Ship Constructive and Shipwrights' Association, later {{changing}} this to the [...] "Shipconstructors' and Shipwrights' Association". At the beginning of 1963, it merged with the United Society of Boilermakers, Shipbuilders and Structural Workers.|$|R

50|$|Circle interpolating, {{also known}} as orbital drilling, is a process for {{creating}} <b>holes</b> using machine <b>cutters.</b>|$|R
50|$|Links courses {{tend to be}} on, or {{at least}} very near to, a coast, and the term is {{typically}} associated with coastal courses, often amid dunes, with few water hazards and few, if any, trees. This reflects both {{the nature of the}} scenery where the sport happened to originate and the fact that only limited resources were available to golf course architects at the time and any moving of soil had to be done by hand, so it was kept to a minimum. Even today, some links courses do not employ a greens staff, use only basic machinery such as <b>hole</b> <b>cutters</b> without boards to ensure that the hole is cut unevenly, and use grazing animals to keep the grass cropped.|$|R
50|$|The annular cutters {{have less}} teeth and less wear, {{therefore}} with an annular <b>cutter</b> <b>holes</b> {{can be made}} at higher or faster cutting speed and a faster feed rate of the drilling machine.|$|R
50|$|As an annular cutter cuts {{only on the}} {{periphery}} of the hole to be made, it has to remove much less material as compared to conventional drill bits which cut and remove the complete material of the <b>hole.</b> Annular <b>cutters</b> are considered to be 3 to 4 times faster than conventional drill bits. Also while using a twist drill bit or metal hole saw one has to do pre-drilling and step-drilling operations for bigger diameter holes, whereas an annular cutter requires no pre-drilling and step-drilling. It is a one-shot drilling operation.|$|R
5000|$|In 1997, Bowen was {{assigned}} as the Officer-in-Charge of the [...] in Newport, Rhode Island, until her decommissioning in April 1998. During May 1998 he {{was assigned}} as the Officer-in-Charge of , based in Woods <b>Hole,</b> Massachusetts; this <b>cutter</b> was first of the high-tech 87-foot (26.5 m) patrol boats on the east coast.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two common}} types of {{large-scale}} pellet mills: flat die mills and ring die mills. Flat die mills use a flat die with slots. The powder is {{introduced to the}} top of the die and as the die rotates a roller presses the powder through the holes in the die. A cutter on the other side of the die cuts the exposed pellet free from the die. In the ring die there are radial slot throughout the die. Powder is fed into the inside of the die and spreaders evenly distribute the powder. Two rollers then compress the powder through the die <b>holes.</b> Two <b>cutters</b> are used to cut the pellets free from the outside of the die.|$|R
50|$|In {{traditional}} {{raise boring}} operations, mining companies use a drilling technique known as ‘up-reaming’. Normally, {{this type of}} rig first drills a small pilot hole downward, then large machine cutters {{are attached to the}} drill which is sticking out the bottom of the pilot <b>hole.</b> The massive <b>cutters</b> are pulled up as they grind through thick rock, boring along the pilot hole. In this case however, since the space below was blocked and the raise bore bit could not be attached from underground, the rig was modified to widen the hole from above.|$|R
40|$|During the EUROCORE {{project in}} 1989 at Summit, Central Greenland, a 304. 8 -m long ice core of 105 mm {{diameter}} was retrieved with an electromechanical drill. A dry drilling technique {{was used in}} order to minimise contamination of the ice. A special drill head with a small chipping depth was designed to assure minimal fracturing of the core. The quality was excellent to the depth of 180 m, but then deteriorated due to increasing brittleness of the ice. Down to 280 m {{we were able to}} maintain the mean length of unbroken core pieces above 0. 1 m by reducing the pitch from 7 to 2 mm. The sticking of the consequently finer chips to the drill barrels was reduced by treating the barrels repeatedly with a silicone-based wax solution. <b>Hole</b> enlargement <b>cutters</b> near {{the upper end of the}} drill head prevented the drill from becoming stuck due to borehole closure...|$|R
25|$|The bit {{includes}} a center point which guides {{it throughout the}} cut (and incidentally spoils the otherwise flat bottom of the <b>hole).</b> The cylindrical <b>cutter</b> around the perimeter shears the wood fibers {{at the edge of}} the bore, and also helps guide the bit into the material more precisely. The tool in the image has a total of two cutting edges in this cylinder. Forstner bits have radial cutting edges to plane off the material at the bottom of the hole. The bit in the image has two radial edges. Other designs may have more. Forstner bits have no mechanism to clear chips from the hole, and therefore must be pulled out periodically.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the early}} 70s, Mr. Dough Hougen invented the Rotabroach annular cutters. During those days twist drill bits were {{so popular that}} people were not in mood to accept a new idea of cutting <b>holes</b> with annular <b>cutters.</b> Hougen took the annular cutter to many drill bit {{manufacture}} but he got a dispappointing response, but {{when he took the}} annular cutters to the fabricators and construction steelworker they were very well interested in this concept because during those period the construction steelworker and fabricators used a [...] magnetic drilling machines which was at least 100 lbs. (45 Kg.) and required 2 workers to lift it to the construction site. These magnetic drills were then called a [...] because the drill bit bound off the drill breaking free and throwing the worker off the structure.|$|R
