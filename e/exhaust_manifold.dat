25|$|The <b>exhaust</b> <b>manifold</b> (exhaust tee, exhaust cover, whiskers) is the ducting {{that protects}} the exhaust valve(s) and diverts the exhaled air to the sides {{so that it does}} not bubble up in the diver's face and obscure the view. This is not {{necessary}} for twin hose regulators as they exhaust air behind the shoulders.|$|E
25|$|A third cause {{might be}} {{cracks in the}} engine block from {{overtightening}} the head bolts. Some engines developed cracks in the block that would leak coolant and/or oil, sometimes accompanied by broken head bolts directly above the crack. The leak would spray coolant or oil, the latter resulting in fire if sprayed onto the hot catalytic converter or <b>exhaust</b> <b>manifold</b> {{at the front of}} the engine compartment.|$|E
25|$|Alternatively, some fires {{may have}} been because of the engine wiring harness {{bulkhead}} connector (C500) being located {{in the center of}} the engine bay above the <b>exhaust</b> <b>manifold,</b> where heat could possibly melt and ignite the wiring. The 1984 model had a magnesium grille over this area. In later models, the main engine harness connector (C500) was moved to the battery area, and was improved to some degree with better heat shielding wrapped around the wiring harness.|$|E

25|$|With {{high-performance}} camshaft timing, {{exhaust valves}} in different cylinders can be {{open at the}} same time, overlapping {{at the end of}} the power stroke in one cylinder and the end of exhaust stroke in another. In twin-scroll designs, the <b>exhaust</b> <b>manifold</b> physically separates the channels for cylinders that can interfere with each other, so that the pulsating exhaust gasses flow through separate spirals (scrolls). With common firing order 1-3-4-2, two scrolls of unequal length pair cylinders 1-4 and 3-2. This lets the engine efficiently use exhaust scavenging techniques, which decreases exhaust gas temperatures and NOx emissions, improves turbine efficiency, and reduces turbo lag evident at low engine speeds.|$|E
25|$|Most {{vehicles}} existing {{today have}} been serviced by GM {{during one of}} the safety recalls on the car. For the fire-related recall, shields and drip-trays were added to prevent leaking fluids from contacting hot surfaces. The presence of drip shields between the engine block and the <b>exhaust</b> <b>manifold</b> are a clue that the car has been retrofitted. The addition of the longer AC Delco PF51 oil filter and a re-calibrated dipstick added extra oil capacity to the oiling system, and enabled running four quarts of oil in the crankcase instead of three, to help prevent oil starvation to the rods. Certain vehicles also had their connecting rods or entire block replaced.|$|E
25|$|In March 2008, GM {{announced}} a recall on all 1997–2003 Grand Prix GTP models (as well as sister car Buick Regal GS) {{due to a}} problem that causes fires in the engine compartment. Over 230 fires were reported. This recall affected over 200,000 vehicles equipped with the supercharged 3800 Series II engine. GM {{sent a letter to}} the owners of these vehicles on March 13, 2008, instructing them not to park in garages or carports until the problem was resolved. The recall for the Supercharged engine involved changing the left (front) valve cover gasket, as oil leaks onto the <b>exhaust</b> <b>manifold</b> may cause engine fires. Some believed this recall did not fix the fire problem, and instead the problem is likely faulty fuel rail quick disconnect o-rings. There have been reports of fires happening after the recall has been performed.|$|E

25|$|Wankel engines run {{very hot}} on the {{ignition}} and exhaust side of the engine's trochoid chamber, whereas the intake and compression parts are cooler. Suzuki opted for a complicated oil-cooling and water cooling system, with Garside reasoning that provided the power did not exceed , air-cooling would suffice. Garside cooled {{the interior of the}} rotors with filtered ram-air. This very hot air was cooled in a plenum contained within the semi-monocoque frame and afterwards, once mixed with fuel, fed into the engine. This air was quite oily after running through the interior of the rotors, and thus was used to lubricate the rotor tips. The exhaust pipes become very hot, with Suzuki opting for a finned <b>exhaust</b> <b>manifold,</b> twin-skinned exhausted pipes with cooling grilles, heatproof pipe wrappings and silencers with heat shields. Garside simply tucked the pipes out of harm's way under the engine, where heat would dissipate in the breeze of the vehicle's forward motion. Suzuki opted for complicated multi-stage carburation, whilst Garside choose simple carburetors. Suzuki had three lube systems, whilst Garside had a single total-loss oil injection system which was fed to both the main bearings and the intake manifolds. Suzuki chose a single rotor that was fairly smooth, however with rough patches at 4,000rpm; Garside opted for a turbine-smooth twin-rotor motor. Suzuki mounted the massive rotor high in the frame, but Garside put his rotors as low as possible to lower the center of gravity of the motorcycle.|$|E

500|$|First, the {{turbocharger}} {{was split}} and positioned alongside the Motor Generator Unit-Heat (MGU-H)—the generator harvesting heat {{energy from the}} <b>exhaust</b> <b>manifold</b> used to power the turbine—and positioned within the cylinder banks forming the 'V' configuration of the engine. In order to make this fit, Honda eschewed {{the use of a}} centrifugal fan in its single-stage compressor in favour of using several smaller fans positioned at intervals along a shaft. Although this would limit the ability of the turbocharger to build up the maximum amount of boost pressure, the 100kg/h fuel flow limit introduced in 2014 minimised the impact of this. The Motor Generator Unit-Kinetic (MGU-K)—the generator harvesting energy from the engine spinning while under braking—was positioned in front of the engine to deliver energy directly to the crankshaft, following the convention established with the introduction of the kinetic energy recovery system in [...] The batteries housing the energy harvested by the MGU-H and MGU-K were merged with the Electronic Control Unit and positioned in front of the engine.
