30|$|In {{clinical}} practice, {{we realized}} {{presence of a}} strange paradox. On one hand we have populations of patients, who are having their entire active immunity system, enhanced due to the FDA approved HBV vaccine, remaining on stand-by. On the other hand, we have populations of patients, who were <b>diagnosed</b> <b>with</b> <b>breast</b> <b>cancers</b> carrying specific molecules HER- 2 —a potential vaccination target and who would greatly benefit from therapeutic vaccines, but no vaccines are available. This realization prompted our work.|$|R

5|$|Minogue was <b>diagnosed</b> <b>with</b> <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> at age 36 on 17 May 2005, {{leading to}} the {{postponement}} of the remainder of her Showgirl– The Greatest Hits Tour and her withdrawal from the Glastonbury Festival. Her hospitalisation and treatment in Melbourne resulted in a brief but intense period of media coverage, particularly in Australia, where Prime Minister John Howard issued a statement of support. As media and fans began to congregate outside the Minogue residence in Melbourne, Victorian Premier Steve Bracks warned the international media that any disruption of the Minogue family's rights under Australian privacy laws would not be tolerated. His comments became part of a wider criticism of the media's overall reaction, with particular criticism directed towards paparazzi.|$|E
5|$|Ruth {{is portrayed}} as being strong-willed, {{determined}} and loyal. She is also a New Woman and a farmer, traits that made her {{stand out from the}} other female characters in The Archers {{at the time of her}} introduction. In later years, Ruth has mellowed and is more open to negotiation. Her storylines have often revolved around her marriage to David and her work on Brookfield Farm. In the early 2000s, the scriptwriters had Ruth and David isolate themselves from the community during a foot-and-mouth outbreak. Ruth was also <b>diagnosed</b> <b>with</b> <b>breast</b> <b>cancer,</b> a storyline which Finch undertook extensive research for and later named as one of her Archers highlights.|$|E

40|$|Multivitamin use {{is common}} in the United States. It is not known whether multivitamins with {{minerals}} supplements (MVM) used by women already <b>diagnosed</b> <b>with</b> invasive <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> would affect their <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> mortality risk. To determine prospectively the effects of MVM use on <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> mortality in postmenopausal women <b>diagnosed</b> <b>with</b> invasive <b>breast</b> <b>cancer,</b> a prospective cohort study was conducted of 7, 728 women aged 50 - 79 at enrollment in the women 2 ̆ 7 s health initiative (WHI) in 40 clinical sites across the United States <b>diagnosed</b> <b>with</b> incident invasive <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> during WHI and followed for a mean of 7. 1 years after <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> diagnosis.

Tension develops between Peggy and Phil when Grant leaves for Rio de Janeiro after a violent fight with his brother.

40|$|Abstract. The {{present study}} sought to {{determine}} the survival outcomes for women <b>diagnosed</b> <b>with</b> <b>breast</b> and endometrial <b>cancer.</b> Using SEER data, a population-based cohort study of women <b>diagnosed</b> <b>with</b> <b>breast</b> and endometrial <b>cancer</b> was conducted. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were created for disease‑specific survival rates. A total of 2, 027 women <b>diagnosed</b> <b>with</b> <b>breast</b> and endometrial <b>cancer</b> were identi-fied. Of these, 1, 296 (63. 9 %) developed <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> first and 731 (36. 1 %) developed endometrial cancer first. Regional lymph node involvement was significantly more common <b>with</b> a <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> diagnosis [522 (25. 8 %) women] compared with an endometrial cancer diagnosis [87 (4. 3 %) women] (P< 0. 05). Factors associated with decreased survival included a high tumor grade in endometrial cancer, nodal positivity and estrogen receptor-negative <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> (P< 0. 05 for each). There were 83 (4. 1 %) mortalities due to <b>breast</b> <b>cancer,</b> 63 (3. 1 %) mortalities due to endometrial cancer and 178 (8. 8 %) mortalities due to other causes (P< 0. 05). In conclusion, for women <b>diagnosed</b> <b>with</b> <b>breast</b> and endometrial <b>cancer,</b> the cumulative risk of mortality at five years following the second cancer diagnosis is nearly {{four times more likely}} to be due to <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> than endometrial cancer...|$|R
