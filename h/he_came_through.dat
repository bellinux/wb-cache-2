5|$|Müller's role can be {{described}} as an attacking all-rounder, a player able to play in a variety of forward positions. As <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>through</b> the youth system, he was seen primarily as a midfielder, but since breaking into the first-team he has been used in more forward roles. Both Bayern Munich and the Germany national team usually play a 4–2–3–1 formation, and Müller is most often part of the three attacking midfielders behind the central striker. He can play in any of the attacking midfield roles but usually plays in the centre for Bayern, and on the right for Germany. He has been used as an out-and-out striker on occasion.|$|E
5|$|Murray {{regained his}} number two ranking after {{he won the}} 2016 Internazionali BNL d'Italia for his 1st title {{of the season and}} 36th overall. He {{defeated}} Mikhail Kukushkin, Jérémy Chardy, 12th seed David Goffin, Lucas Pouille, and number 1 seed Djokovic all in straight sets. This was his first win over Djokovic on clay and became the first British player since Virginia Wade in 1971 to win the title and the first British man since George Patrick Hughes in 1931. Murray then moved on to the French Open where he struggled in the opening rounds coming through two five-set matches against Štěpánek and French wildcard Mathias Bourgue. <b>He</b> <b>came</b> <b>through</b> in straight sets against big servers Ivo Karlović and John Isner to reach the quarterfinals where he beat home favourite Richard Gasquet in four sets to set up a semifinal clash against defending champion Stanislas Wawrinka. Murray defeated Wawrinka in four sets to become the first male British player since Bunny Austin in 1937, to reach a French Open final. He was unable to win his maiden French Open final, losing to Djokovic in four sets.|$|E

He was just 2–7 after 9 bouts where he competed with only the titled ranks of san'yaku wrestlers. His last six matches were against wrestlers from the maegashira ranks and there Baruto managed to hold his ground. He was promoted to sekiwake rank for the Kyushu Basho in November, as the west sekiwake Toyonoshima could not hold his position after a 6–9 finish in the Aki Basho, thus leaving an opening for the position. <b>He</b> <b>came</b> <b>through</b> with a winning record in his sekiwake debut.|$|E

He made his first-team debut aged 16 during the 1999–00 season. In the 2003–04 season, he had a run in the Celtic starting eleven and came under scrutiny from scouts of AC Milan who contacted Celtic about making a move. It was during this season that Kennedy scored his only goal for Celtic, against Dundee in the SPL.|$|E

In the second round, Söderling beat Taylor Dent with ease 6–2, 6–2, 6–4. He then played Thiemo de Bakker in the third round, and won comfortably in straight sets 6–2, 6–3, 6–3. <b>He</b> <b>came</b> <b>through</b> Albert Montañés in four sets {{to set up a}} quarterfinal showdown with Roger Federer, but could not stop the Swiss maestro as he lost 4–6, 4–6, 5–7 in tough conditions.

25|$|Murray {{went into}} the US Open as the eighth seed, his lowest seeding at a major since Wimbledon 2008. In the first round he faced Robin Haase where he looked to be heading for a routine {{straight}} sets victory. However, early in the third set, Murray suffered a bout of cramp and Haase was able to claw his {{way back into the}} match. It looked to be going all the way to a deciding set but Murray was able to come back from a break down to take the match in four. In the second round Murray defeated qualifier Matthias Bachinger in straight sets to set up a first meeting with Andrey Kuznetsov in the third round. <b>He</b> <b>came</b> <b>through</b> that encounter in four sets to set up a third meeting of the season with Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. Murray won in straight sets to record his first win over a top 10 player since his 2013 Wimbledon final victory over Novak Djokovic. It was Djokovic who he faced at the quarter-final stage of the tournament. In their 21st meeting the Serb proved to be too much for Murray, taking the win in four sets in a late match that lasted over three and a half hours.|$|E

He made his debut as an 85th minute substitute in a 2–0 victory over League One team Scunthorpe United in the League Cup on 20 September 2005. Till was loaned to Scunthorpe United for a month on 5 October 2005 after being brought to their attention in the game weeks earlier, with manager Brian Laws commenting [...] "I've watched him twice more since our game and I've liked what I've seen". His debut came two days later in a 2–0 victory over Tranmere Rovers. The loan deal was extended until January 2006 after Till impressed Laws.

These included making the pig's trotter dish more [...] "delicate", and only using the white part of the leeks in a pressed leek and langoustine starter. Meades also noticed that White had [...] "tempered" [...] the sauces served with meat and fish, referring to their previous versions as [...] "assault courses". He praised a new roasted salmon and tapenade dish, calling it [...] "of breathtaking quality", {{and the work of}} pastry chef Roger Pizey. Meades later listed The Restaurant as the second best in the country at the end of 1994, placed only behind Phil Vickery, having recently taken over from Gary Rhodes, at the Castle Hotel, Taunton. He gave both restaurants an equal nine stars out of ten. When celebrity chef Keith Floyd listed his five favourite restaurants for The Guardian in September 1994, he included The Restaurant in third place, saying [...] "The food is exquisite. He's a difficult bastard, but I like him. <b>He</b> <b>came</b> <b>through</b> le Gavroche, through Albert Roux, and he's developed on from there.

2500|$|Donald Creighton (1902–1979) was {{a leading}} {{historian}} who built upon the Staples thesis in his The Commercial Empire of the St-Lawrence: 1760-1850 (1937). His Laurentian thesis showed how the English merchant class Came to dominate Canadian business through their control of the export of staples via the St-Lawrence River. They made Montreal economic, business and financial capital of Canada. In his enormously influential biography of John A. McDonald, Creighton argued that McDonald had built upon and extended the Laurentian model by his creation of the transcontinental railway. [...] More than that, Creighton transformed Canadian political history. For years scholars had complained about the old-fashioned, narrow, constitutional approach. They hoped Creighton could modernize the field and <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>through,</b> by adding not just biography, but also social, cultural, and especially long-term economic patterns as the matrix on which Canadian politics was played out.|$|E

The facts also sustain this hypothesis and explain his Life's Philosophy. 'Men must endure their going hence, even as their coming hither, ripeness is all.'" [...] De Chambrun describes how the W.H. theory originated. Thomas Thorpe, a [...] "pirate publisher", published a volume of Shakespeare's sonnets with the following inscription, [...] "To the onlie begetter of these [...] sonnets, Mr. W.H." [...] De Chambrun criticizes the initials and she {{does not believe in}} following the Herbertist (William Herbert, Earl of Pembroke in 1623) theory; rather she writes of [...] "graver critics" [...] seeing the letters standing for Will Hall, a trafficker of manuscripts and a favorite of Thorpe, the [...] "Piratical Publisher". De Chambrun continues, if the Earl of Pembroke, William Herbert, was Mr. W.H., then the critics who believe the dark lady to be Mary Fitton (known mistress) would be incorrect, because Mary Fitton was a blonde.|$|E
