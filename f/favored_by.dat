5|$|Stylistically, many {{commentators}} have described The Oceanides as either an outright example of Impressionism or somehow derivative of that art movement.

5|$|At {{a variety}} of elevations, meadows provide important, {{productive}} habitat for wildlife. Animals come to feed on the green grasses and use the flowing and standing water found in many meadows. Predators, in turn, are attracted to these areas.

Species that are highly dependent upon meadow habitat include great grey owl, willow flycatcher, Yosemite toad, and mountain beaver.|$|E

Resource extraction and efficient transportation financed much of the city's growth {{through the end of}} the 19thcentury. In the 20thcentury, a light-aircraft factory, a college, and a paper mill, along with many smaller enterprises, drove the economy. Frequent floods, especially in 1972, damaged local industry and led to a high rate of unemployment in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Comments about Heliade and his Bucharest statue feature {{prominently}} in Macedonski's short story Nicu Dereanu, whose main character, a daydreaming Bohemian, idolizes the Wallachian writer.

5|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, the state {{government}} conducted a feasibility study for a second floating bridge across Lake Washington, in response to increased traffic on the bridge. In 1953, the Washington State Legislature approved {{the construction of a}} second floating bridge, using past and future tolls to fund its construction. The west end of the floating bridge would be connected to the Everett–Seattle tollway (later Interstate 5) at Roanoke Street, south of the planned Ship Canal Bridge, as well as the proposed Empire Way Expressway at Montlake. The east end would be connected to a north–south freeway bypass of the Seattle area, which later became Interstate 405. Two alignments for the floating bridge were considered in the late 1950s: a Sand Point–Kirkland, <b>favored</b> <b>by</b> the City of Seattle; and an Evergreen Point crossing, <b>favored</b> <b>by</b> {{the state government}} and the U.S. Navy, which operated Naval Air Station Sand Point. The state government initially chose the Montlake–Evergreen Point alignment in 1954, intending to begin construction in 1955, but the alignment dispute delayed a final decision until December 1956. Citizen groups from the Montlake area protested the decision, but were largely ignored by the project's citizen committee.|$|E

Two line bucks preceded Neely, who connected with Tot McCullough for a 30-yard pass play. Neely ran for an additional 17 yards, putting the ball on the nine-yard line. After a run by Godchaux, Lynn Bomar bucked over the line for the touchdown.|$|E
5|$|Multnomah County {{is named}} for Native Americans {{who lived in the}} area before {{settlement}} by non-indigenous people in the 19thcentury. Members of the Multnomah tribe of the Chinookan people lived on Sauvie Island in the Willamette River and on the mainland across from the island, downstream from the mouth of Balch Creek.
