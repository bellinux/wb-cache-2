5000|$|Between 1933 and 1935 (sometimes {{applying}} the cover-name [...] "Max Richter") Schubert played a decisive {{role in the}} party leadership. A meeting took place in January 1935 between the German Communist Party leadership and the Comintern at which Schubert's appointment to the Comintern executive committee in succession to Fritz Heckert was agreed. However, just as the political tide in Moscow was clearly turning against the Comintern, so Schubert himself was becoming increasingly marginalised inside the party. It was the Ulbricht / Pieck faction that was becoming mainstream, and both Florin and Dahlem switched sides, joining Ulbricht's group. The first party conference since the Hitler power zeizure was held in Brussels in October 1935. It was here that Schubert and his friend Fritz Schulte {{were excluded from the}} party central committee, scapegoated for the party's misfortunes and distanced from the apparatus of the party and of the Comintern. He was given a relatively low-profile position in International Red Aid, the <b>international</b> <b>Communist</b> workers' welfare <b>organisation.</b> [...] However, on 15 May 1937, {{in the context of the}} purges (" [...] Чистки") that were a feature of political life in Moscow during the later 1930s, Hermann Schubert was arrested by the NKVD.
