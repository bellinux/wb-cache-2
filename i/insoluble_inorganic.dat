We are embarking on a project to create a national test bed for evaluating mixed waste destruction technologies. This project is called the Mixed Waste Management Facility. It is currently {{in the second phase}} of design and will be operational in 1998. One of the first technologies demonstrated in this facility is Molten Salt Oxidation. Molten Salt Oxidation is a thermal process that destroys the organic constituents of mixed and hazardous wastes. Sodium carbonate salt is heated in a reactor vessel to approximately 950 {degrees}C. Organic wastes, along with oxidant air, are injected under the pool of molten salt. A catalytic reaction occurs converting the organics into CO{sub 2 } and water. Inorganic constituents in the salt such as metals, silica, alumina, and radionuclides remain captured in the salt. Chlorides in the waste feed are converted in the salt to sodium chloride. As these impurities build up in the salt, the salt must be recycled to remove them or else the reaction rate is reduced. Spent salt is periodically taken from the reactor and transported to a salt recycle system. In this system the molten salt is freeze-dried, dissolved in water, and filtered to remove the <b>insoluble</b> <b>inorganics.</b> The unconverted {{sodium carbonate}} is removed by fractional crystallization.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The work {{presented}} {{here was to}} determine the transformation of phosphorus (P) between different forms in the process of intermittent and continuous aeration. According to this study, aeration, at an airflow rate of 1. 0 L/min, resulted in an increase in the manure pH of about one unit, from 6. 5 to 7. 5, within 24 hours, accompanied by a reduction in soluble ortho–P of 76 %. This reduction in soluble P was apparently caused by the chemical precipitation that was indicated by a reduction in organic P and a simultaneous increase in <b>insoluble</b> <b>inorganic</b> P. The analysis of mass balances between the P fractions showed a large transformation of inorganic insoluble P into organic forms during the aeration period, which could overshadow the efficiency of soluble P removal by microbes. Because the manure contained about 73. 5 % <b>insoluble</b> <b>inorganic</b> P, it is suggested that solid–liquid separation should be performed prior to aeration to increase the efficiency of soluble P removal.

Furthermore, comparison between the Pseudomonas spp. of the genes involved in oxidative glucose metabolism revealed variations in genomic organization. To further investigate the genetic mechanisms involved in inorganic phosphate solubilization by Pseudomonas spp., a transposon mutant library of P. fluorescens F 113 was screened for mutants with reduced Ca 3 (PO 4) 2 solubilization ability.

One of the most intriguing and often uncontrollable characteristics of this filamentous organism is its complex morphology. It ranges from dense spherical pellets to viscous mycelia (Figure 1). Various process parameters and ingredients are known to influence fungal morphology 1. Since optimal productivity correlates strongly with a specific morphological form, the fungal morphology often represents the bottleneck of productivity in industrial production.

The different occurrence states of fluorine during coal combustion and emission show that fluorine in coal mainly assumes <b>insoluble</b> <b>inorganic</b> mineral forms. The results illustrate that the three typical occurrence modes in coal are CaF 2, MgF 2 and AlF 3. The fluorine in fly ash can be captured by an electrostatic precipitator (EPS) or a bag filter. In contrast, the gaseous fluorine content in flue gas is only in the range of several parts per million; thus, it cannot be used in this study. The occurrence mode of fluorine in bottom ash and slag is inorganic villiaumite (e. g., soluble NaF, KF and insoluble CaF 2) which is difficult to break down even at high temperatures. The occurrence mode of fluorine with the highest content in fly ash is physically adsorbed fluorine along the direction of the flue gas flow. The <b>insoluble</b> <b>inorganic</b> mineral fluoride content in fly ash is also high, but the gradually increasing fluorine content in fly ash is mainly caused by physical adsorption.

The ac response was measured by using impedance spectroscopy in equilibrium conditions at different lithium compositions and during several cycles of charge and discharge in a half cell vs. metallic lithium. The impedance analysis shows the contribution of both surface resistance and solid state diffusion through {{the bulk of the}} nanowires. The surface process is dominated by a solid electrolyte layer (SEI) consisting of an inner, <b>inorganic</b> <b>insoluble</b> part and several organic compounds at the outer interface, as seen by XPS analysis. The surface resistivity, which seems to be correlated with the Coulombic efficiency of the electrode, grows at very high lithium contents due to an increase in the inorganic SEI thickness. We estimate the diffusion coefficient of about 2 × 10 - 10 cm 2 /s for lithium diffusion in silicon. A large increase in the electrode impedance was observed at very low lithium compositions, probably due to a different mechanism for lithium diffusion inside the wires. Restricting the discharge voltage to 0. 7 V prevents this large impedance and improves the electrode lifetime.

Both the reduction of wear and the friction control are key issues for decreasing of energy losses, improving efficiency and increasing of the life-span of an engine. Dialkyldithiophosphates (DTPs) of different metals have been extensively used as multifunctional additives in lubricants to control friction and reduce wear in mechanical systems. Among these DTP-compounds, zinc dialkyldithiophosphates (ZnDTPs) are the most common additives used for more than 60 years. These additives form protective films on steel surfaces and, thus, control friction and reduce wear. However, ZnDTPs contain zinc and large amounts of phosphorus and sulphur, which are human health hazards and cause environmental pollution by degrading catalytic converters in automobiles. Therefore, replacement of ZnDTPs byzinc free compounds with reduced amounts of sulphur and phosphorus are urgently needed. Boron-containing compounds are known as corrosion inhibitors, antioxidants, friction modifiers and effective anti-wear additives either dissolved in oil or as an <b>insoluble</b> and <b>inorganic</b> borate salts dispersed in oil in the nanoparticulate form. These compounds are emerging as attractive replacements for the compounds already used as additives in lubricants. The focus of the present work is on the development and tribological investigations of new boron compounds as highperformance additives in lubricants. These should be ashless with significantly reduced amounts sulphur and phosphorus, which is favourable for the environment protection. The work was carried out in the following steps: (1) Synthesis of new additives; (2) Characterization of the additives with FTIR, (1 H, 13 C, 31 P, 11 B) NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis and thermal analysis (TG/DTG, DTA and QMS); (3) Tribological evaluation using four ball Tribometer; (4) Surface analysis using an optical profiler and Scanning Electron Microscopy coupled with X-ray Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (SEM/EDS). It was found that the novel boroncompounds have considerably better antiwear performance and higher stability of the coefficient of friction with time as compared with ZnDTP. These novel compounds are ashless with reduced amounts of sulphur and phosphorus. They also have excellent tribological properties, high thermal stability, good miscibility with oils and positive environmental issues which make them an attractive alternative to ZnDTP.

Thus, the {{synthesis}} and discharge of organic acid by the PSM strains {{into the surrounding}} environment acidify the cells and their surrounding environment that ultimately lead {{to the release of}} P ions from the P mineral by H+ substitution for the cation bound to phosphate (Goldstein 1994). The prominent acids released by PSM in the solubilization of insoluble P are gluconic acid (Di-Simine et al. 1998; Bar-Yosef et al. 1999), oxalic acid, citricacid (Kim et al. 1997), lactic acid, tartaric acid, aspartic acid (Venkateswarlu et al. 1984). Evidence from an abiotic study using HCl and gluconic acid to solubilize P also indicated that chelation of Al 3 + by gluconic acid may have been a factor in the solubilization of colloidal Al phosphate (Whitelaw et al. 1999). Organic acids produced by P-solubilizing microorganisms can be detected by high performance liquid chromatography and enzymatic methods (Parks et al. 1990; Whitelaw 2000). However, acidification {{does not seem to be}} the only mechanism of solubilization, as the ability to reduce the pH in some cases did not correlate with the ability to solubilize mineral P (SubbaRao 1982). Altomare et al. (1999) investigated the capability of the plant-growth promoting and biocontrol fungus T. harzianum T- 22 to solubilize in vitro insoluble minerals including rock phosphate. Organic acids were not detected in the culture filtrates and hence, the authors concluded that acidification was probably not the major mechanism of solubilization as the pH never fell below 5. The phosphate solubilizing activity was attributed both to chelation and to reduction processes. Although, organic acid has been suggested as the principal mechanism of P solubilization, the solubilization of <b>insoluble</b> P by <b>inorganic</b> acid (e.g. HCl) has also been reported, although HCl was able to solubilize less P from hydroxyapatite than citric acid or oxalic acid at same pH (Kim et al. 1997). Bacteria of the genera Nitrosomonas and Thiobacillus species can also dissolve phosphate compounds by producing nitric and sulphuric acids (Azam and Memon 1996).|$|R
40|$|Highly {{reactive}} green rust (GR) nanoparticles {{are believed}} {{to play an important}} role in the geochemistry of water saturated sediments (e. g. hydromorphic soils) and engineered systems where zero-valent iron is used for decontaminating polluted sites (e. g. permeable reactive barriers). The presence of structural Fe 2 + within GR and its high specific surface area make it an effective reductant for many inorganic (e. g. Cr, U, Se) and organic substances (e. g. tetrachloroethene (TCE)). These reduction processes can lead to breakdown of organic molecules or the formation of <b>insoluble</b> reduced <b>inorganic</b> phases (e. g., UO 2 (s)), thus reducing the bioavailability of these toxic compounds. Understanding the formation and geochemical stability of GR is key to assessing its potential role in natural sediments and engineered environments. However, characterizing GR is difficult due to the rapid oxidation (seconds - minutes) of structural Fe 2 + in the presence of air. Thus, to obtain detailed information about the mechanism and kinetics of GR formation, stabilisation and oxidative breakdown, novel synchrotron-based methods have been developed which combine in situ and time-resolved X-ray diffraction/scattering (XRD/SAXS) analysis with controlled anaerobic chemical synthesis. This system allowed the simultaneous quantification of several chemical parameters in the aqueous solution (i. e., pH, Eh) with detailed analysis of the changes in the solid phase crystal structure. In conjunction with this X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) was used to characterise the speciation of trace elements (i. e. U, Zn and Se) associated with GR as it crystallised and/or transformed. The formation of green rust (Fe 2 +/Fe 3 + > 1. 2) from solution occurs via a 3 stage process. The first stage is the nucleation and growth of ferric hydroxysulfate (schwertmannite) nanoparticles (~ 5 nm). With increasing pH the schwertmannite transforms into nanogoethite particles (< 50 nm). This process is catalyzed by adsorbed Fe 2 + ions on the surface of schwertmannite which facilitates the transformation reaction. Green rust formation occurs when the surface adsorbed Fe 2 + hydrolyses and reacts with the goethite above pH 7. With further increases in pH the GR remains stable up to pH 10. Experiments conducted at lower Fe 2 +/Fe 3 + ratios (0. 5 - 1) show that green rust is formed at pH 7 - 9, but is metastable with respect to magnetite above pH 7. Oxidation reactions reveal that the green rust breaks down to a mixture of Lepidocrocite (L) and goethite (G) with the L/G ratio and the rate of breakdown increasing with pH. Speciation analysis indicates that U 6 + and Se 6 + are reduced to U 4 + and Se 4 +/Se 0 during GR formation and that during the oxidation process the reduced trace elements are fully or partially reoxidised, yet a significant amount remains sorbed to the FeOOH particles. This study suggests that green rust nanoparticles could be utilised to sequester key inorganic contaminants under a range of natural pH conditions (neutral - alkaline). Also, following oxidation, a significant proportion of some trace elements are retained within the oxidised minerals which could significantly reduce their long-term mobility...|$|R
40|$|Microorganisms {{and their}} {{interactions}} in soil {{play a critical}} role in nutrient transformations and cycling, and in sustaining soil productivity. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are a keystone group of fungi influencing nutrient cycling. In turn, the activity and composition of microorganisms in soil are influenced by management practices such as the choice of crop species and fertilization. Biofertilizer has been identified as an alternative source for chemical fertilization to increase soil fertility and crop production. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and rhizobia are two of the most important plant symbionts in natural habitats. Many leguminous plants have the ability to associate with the two microbial symbionts, which yield arbuscular mycorrhizae and root nodules. Moreover, AM fungi, rhizobia and leguminous plants are able to form a tripartite symbiosis. It has demonstrated that the intimate association is determined by the mutual recognition and subsequently the penetration of plant tissues in the establishment stage. A pot experiment was conducted in a net house in the University of Peshawar Pakistan, investigate the effect of seed inoculation with Rhizobium and/or soil inoculation with the vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Glomus mosseae, Glomus fasciculatum and G. aggregatum under different levels of RP fertilization. A pot experiment was conducted in 2010 - 2011 to investigate the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) status of Vigina radiate (NAIB- 92, NAIB- 98, NAIB- 2006), Macroptilum bracteatum, Pisum sativum, Desmodium adscendens and Lens culinaris (NARC- 2008 - 2, NARC- 2008 - 3, NARC- 2008 - 4, NARC- 2002) its relationship with plant vegetative, flowering and fruiting stages. The different inoculations (single and dual) of Rhizobium and VAM fungi mostly Glomus msesea, Glomus fasciculatum and G. aggregatum were incorporated under deficient P soil (1. 13 %). The growth and yield responses of studied legumes to inoculation with AMF and Rhizobium strains depended on the particular AMF-Rhizobium strain combination. In some cases, the productivity of studied legumes inoculated with an effective Rhizobium strain was reduced by an apparently incompatible AMF species compared to the Rhizobium treatment. In contrast, the yield of studied legumes inoculated with some ineffective Rhizobium strains was enhanced by an apparently compatible AMF species compared to the Rhizobium treatment. However, maximum Lens culinaris productivity was achieved only in treatments with effective Rhizobium strains or coinoculation treatments with effective Rhizobium strains and a compatible AMF species. Plants were analysed for growth parameters (plant height, number of leaves, number of flowers/plant, number of pod/plant, number of seeds/pod, length of pod), dry weight of plant, nutrient uptake (Mg, Ca, K,Cu, Mn, Fe and Zn), proximate composition (crude protein, ash, crude fiber, fat and carbohydrate), percent VAM infection and spore density. Plant were analyzed for proximate composition and mineral composition. Results showed significant at (p> 0. 05) increase in the moisture and carbohydrate contents the fat, ash, crude fiber and protein content treated plants. Mycorrhizal colonization gradually coincreased with the increase in plant age from early vegetative to fruiting stage. Plants colonized by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi have been shown to respond positively to the application of <b>insoluble</b> forms of <b>inorganic</b> phosphorus (P) such as rock phosphates (RPs) that responses to RP by mycorrhizal (MRP 1 and MRP 2) plants more pronounced than RP alone. The results revealed that dual inoculation of Rhizobium with VAM (Glomus msesea, Glomus fasciculatum and G. aggregatum) enhanced seed yield of legume. Varieties were single or dual inoculated with different AM fungus and different Rhizobium strains the dual symbiosis formed by AM fungi and Rhizobium depending on the plant variety and the symbionts involved. Influence of VAM fungus, Rhizobium and Rock phosphate inoculation on lentil,green mung bean, pea, desmodium and burgundy growth response in relation to growth parameters, yield and productivity, dry weight of plants, grains, roots colonization was studied in pot studies. The treatments consisted of inoculation with VAM fungus only, Rhizobium, dual inoculation with VAM fungus and Rhizobium. Rock phosphate alone and dual with VAM and control. Seeds concentration of VAM used as inoculum was 290 spores per pot. Rhizospheric soil from wheat field having high spores number of different AMF i-e Glomus fasciculatum, G. mosseae and G. aggregatum and roots of wheat and maize infected with Arbuscular mycorrhiza were used as rhizobase inoculum. Roots were cut into 1 cm pieces. These root pieces along with soil base inoculum (rhizospheric soil) were spread uniformly in layers at a depth of 3 cm and 6 cm before sowing. Inoculum for each pot consisted of 180 gm of mycorrhizal infected roots and adhering soil. The spore density was found to be 290 spores per 100 g of soil. A synergistic relationship dependent on N and P status exists between rhizobia and AM fungi on growth. Co-inoculation with rhizobia and AM fungi significantly increased.
