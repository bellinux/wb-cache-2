5|$|The first {{event at}} the 2009 World Championships in August was the 100m. After two sub-10 clockings in the {{preliminary}} rounds, Gay reached the final, along with Jamaicans Bolt and Powell. He ran a new US record of 9.71seconds in the race, the third-fastest time in history, but even so <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> for second place, losing his 100m world title to Bolt, who knocked 0.11seconds off the world record with a run of 9.58seconds.|$|E

When the cars came around for their second and final timed laps, Ricciardo crossed the line first ahead of the Ferrari drivers, with Vettel going faster than {{teammate}} Räikkönen. When the two Mercedes came across the line last, Hamilton took his fourth consecutive pole position, while Nico Rosberg <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> for third on the grid, not being able to beat Vettel's time. The two Williams cars filled the third row, while Nico Hülkenberg was delighted with eighth on the grid.|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} part of 1186, {{after the death}} of King Henry's son Geoffrey– who was Duke of Brittany– King Philip II of France demanded that Geoffrey's daughters be placed in the French king's custody, and that the duchy of Brittany, which Geoffrey had ruled in right of his wife, be {{surrendered}} into French royal custody. Coutances was one of the negotiators sent by King Henry to secure a settlement, but they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> for a temporary truce. In January 1188 Coutances took the cross when he pledged to go on Crusade along with King Henry and King Philip of France.|$|E
5|$|The Aggies {{scored on}} their opening {{possession}} with a 35-yard touchdown with a screen pass from Stephen McGee to Mike Goodson. The Longhorns mustered twofirst downs, but {{were forced to}} punt. Texas A ended their subsequent drive three plays later with a punt of their own. The Longhorns again successfully penetrated into Texas A territory, but Mack Brown opted to call a pooch punt by Colt McCoy on fourthdown and four from the Aggie 37-yard line. The Aggies answered with an eighteen-play drive that stalled on the UT-14 yardline and the Aggies <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> for a 31-yard field goal by Matt Szymanski.|$|E

5|$|As one of {{the most}} ambitious and {{expensive}} projects in the history of maritime archaeology, the Mary Rose project broke new ground within this field in the UK. Besides becoming {{one of the}} first wrecks to be protected under the new Protection of Wrecks Act in 1973 it also created several new precedents. It {{was the first time that}} a British privately funded project was able to apply modern scientific standards fully and without having to auction off part of the findings to finance its activities; where previous projects often <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> for just a partial recovery of finds, everything found in connection with the Mary Rose was recovered and recorded. The raising of the vessel made it possible to establish the first historic shipwreck museum in the UK to receive government accreditation and funding. The excavation of the Mary Rose wreck site proved that it was possible to achieve a level of exactness in underwater excavations comparable to those on dry land.|$|E
5|$|Finucane {{spent the}} winter of 1939–40 gaining as much flight {{practice}} as possible. He was unable to gain any hours in fighter aircraft and was abruptly transferred to the practice and parachute test flight centre at RAF Henlow and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> for making trips around airfields in an antiquated Vickers Virginia as a co-pilot ferrying engineers and ground crew from 16 September 1939. That month German forces invaded Poland (1 September) prompting Britain and France to declare war on Germany and beginning the war in Europe. Finucane's piloting skills were far from being at the acceptable level for a fighter pilot. He continued in this trend until May 1940 until {{he was assigned to}} flying Miles Magister training aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In 1895 and 1897, Cantor {{published}} a two-part paper in Mathematische Annalen under Felix Klein's editorship; these were his last significant papers on set theory. The first paper begins by defining set, subset, etc., {{in ways that}} would be largely acceptable now. The cardinal and ordinal arithmetic are reviewed. Cantor wanted the second paper to include a proof of the continuum hypothesis, but <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> for expositing his theory of well-ordered sets and ordinal numbers. Cantor attempts to prove that if A and B are sets with A equivalent to a subset of B and B equivalent to a subset of A, then A and B are equivalent. Ernst Schröder had stated this theorem a bit earlier, but his proof, as well as Cantor's, was flawed. Felix Bernstein supplied a correct proof in his 1898 PhD thesis; hence the name Cantor–Bernstein–Schröder theorem.|$|E

5|$|Mangalore {{was named}} after the deity Mangaladevi, the {{presiding}} deity of the Mangaladevi temple or a synonym of Tara Bhagvati of the Vajrayana Buddhist sect. According to local legend, a princess from Malabar named Parimala or Premaladevi renounced her kingdom and became a disciple of Matsyendranath, {{the founder of the}} Nath tradition. Having converted Premaladevi to the Nath sect, Matsyendranath renamed her Mangaladevi. She arrived in the area with Matsyendranath, but <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> near Bolar in Mangalore as she fell ill on the way. Eventually she died, and the Mangaladevi temple was consecrated in her honour at Bolar by the local people after her death. The city got its name from the temple.|$|E
5|$|On January 1, 2010, Parise {{was named}} to the 2010 Men's Olympic Hockey Team, and was later named as one of the team's {{alternate}} captains. Parise scored both of Team USA's goals in 2–0 quarter-final win over Switzerland. In the final against Canada, Parise scored a game-tying goal with 24 seconds left in the third period to send the game into overtime, although Parise and his teammates <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> for the silver medal after a Sidney Crosby goal during overtime. For the tournament, Parise finished third in the tournament in scoring, and he {{was named to}} the Olympic All-Star team with countrymen Ryan Miller and Brian Rafalski. In 2014, Parise was again selected to represent his country at the Olympics, and was given the added responsibility of serving as team captain. Parise and the United States capped off their 2014 Olympic campaign with a 5–0 loss to Finland in the bronze medal game.|$|E

Both teams exchanged possessions before the Bills began one final drive. The Bills drove down to the Giants 30-yard line to set up {{what would be a}} potentially game-winning 47-yard field goal attempt by Scott Norwood. Just before the kick, ABC showed a graphic indicating that, on grass that season, Norwood had made just 3–of–7 field goals from at least 40yards. A few moments later, in what became the game's signature moment, Norwood's attempt missed wide right, and the Giants won their second Super Bowl, 20–19.|$|E

5|$|Shackleton {{intended}} {{to arrive in}} Antarctica in January 1908, which meant leaving England during the 1907 summer. He therefore had six months to secure the financing, acquire and fit out a ship, buy all the equipment and supplies, and recruit the personnel. In April, believing that he had got the backing of Scottish businessman Donald Steuart, Shackleton travelled to Norway intending to buy a 700-ton polar vessel, Bjorn, that would have served ideally as an expedition ship. When Steuart withdrew his support, however, Bjorn was beyond Shackleton's means. Bjorn was eventually acquired by German explorer Wilhelm Filchner and, renamed Deutschland, was used in his 1911–13 voyage to the Weddell Sea. Shackleton <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> for the elderly, much smaller Nimrod, a 40-year-old wooden sealer of 334 gross register tons, which {{he was able to}} acquire for £5,000 (updated value £).|$|E
5|$|The 2004 World Cup of Hockey {{was played}} after Selänne's {{difficult}} NHL season with Colorado. For Selänne, the tournament was about recovering his joy at playing hockey. The Finns went undefeated {{to reach the}} final, but Selänne and his teammates <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> for second place after losing the championship game to Canada, 3–2. Returning to the national team for the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Selänne joined Jere Lehtinen and Saku Koivu on what The Hockey News called the best team Finland has ever produced. The Finns outscored their opposition 19–2 in the group stage, then defeated the United States and shut-out Russia in the semi-final. The Finns, however, were overcome in the final by Sweden, 3–2, and were relegated to the silver medal. Selänne scored six goals and 11 points in the tournament, {{was named to the}} all-star team and received the Directorate Award as top forward.|$|E

A few moments later, in what became the game's signature moment, Norwood's attempt missed wide right, and the Giants won their second Super Bowl in five years, 20–19.|$|E

5|$|The secondquarter {{started with}} the Longhorns driving only sixyards and being forced to punt again. The Aggies {{continued}} to press their advantage and drove down the field until Stephen McGee threw an ill-timed pass that was intercepted by Deon Beasley at the Longhorn 25. Two first-downs later, Texas was forced to punt and pinned Texas A on their own fiveyard line. Stephen McGee led the offense with several long passes and the Aggies drove to the Texas 5 but again were held short on 3rd down. On 4th and three, the Aggies faked the field goal and the placeholder, T.J. Sanders, ran the ball in for his firstcareer touchdown giving the Aggies a 17–0 lead. The Longhorns started their next drive on their own 20-yard line, where Colt McCoy threw a 62-yard pass to Jamaal Charles. The drive stalled and the Longhorns <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> for a field goal and went to halftime trailing their arch-rival, 17–3.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{entered the}} {{competition}} in the third round, receiving a bye as a Premier League club. Their opening match was a goalless draw against First Division club Port Vale at home, meaning the game was replayed at Vale Park, eleven days later. In the replay, Arsenal won 4–3 on a penalty shoot-out, having drawn 1–1 in extra time. In the fourth round, Arsenal played Middlesbrough at the Riverside Stadium. Overmars scored the opening goal inside 68 seconds for the visitors and Parlour added a second to give Arsenal a commanding lead, going into the interval. Although Paul Merson scored {{in the second half}} for Middlesbrough, Arsenal did enough to progress into the fifth round. A 0–0 draw at home against Crystal Palace meant Arsenal needed to play a fifth round replay at Selhurst Park on 25 February 1998. Goals from Anelka and Bergkamp ensured victory for an understrength Arsenal team. Against West Ham United in the quarter-finals, Arsenal conceded the first goal when Frank Lampard's corner kick was converted into the goal net by Stuart Pearce, through a first-time shot. Although Bergkamp scored a penalty to equalise, Arsenal <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> for a replay, staged at Upton Park, where it ended 4–3 on penalties after another draw. A goal by Wreh against Wolverhampton Wanderers in the semi-finals meant Arsenal reached their 13th FA Cup final.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1142 Stephen fell ill, and by Easter rumours had begun to circulate that he had died. Possibly this illness {{was the result of}} his imprisonment the previous year, but he finally recovered and travelled north to raise new forces and to successfully convince Ranulf of Chester to change sides once again. Stephen then spent the summer attacking some of the new Angevin castles built the previous year, including Cirencester, Bampton and Wareham. In September, he spotted an opportunity to seize the Empress Matilda herself in Oxford. Oxford was a secure town, protected by walls and the river Isis, but Stephen led a sudden attack across the river, leading the charge and swimming part of the way. Once on the other side, the King and his men stormed into the town, trapping the Empress in the castle. Oxford Castle, however, was a powerful fortress and, rather than storming it, Stephen <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> down for a long siege, albeit secure in the knowledge that Matilda was now surrounded. Just before Christmas, the Empress left the castle unobserved, crossed the icy river on foot and made her escape to Wallingford. The garrison surrendered shortly afterwards, but Stephen had lost an opportunity to capture his principal opponent.|$|E
