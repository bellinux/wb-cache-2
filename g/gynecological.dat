5|$|María Teresa Ferrari (11 October 1887 – 30 October 1956) was an Argentine educator, medical doctor, and women's rights activist. She was {{the first}} female {{university}} professor in Latin America {{and one of the}} first women allowed to teach medicine. She was a pioneering researcher in women's health, studying the use of radiation therapy rather than surgery for uterine tumors and developing a vaginoscope which revolutionized women's health care in Brazil. She established the first maternity ward and <b>gynecological</b> services at the Hospital Militar Central of Buenos Aires in 1925, which provided the first incubation services in the country.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to the United States, Monroe took an 18-month hiatus from work to concentrate on married life on the East Coast. She and Miller split their time between their Manhattan apartment and an eighteenth-century farmhouse that they purchased in Roxbury, Connecticut; they spent the summer in Amagansett, Long Island. She became pregnant in mid-1957, but it was ectopic {{and had to be}} terminated. She suffered a miscarriage a year later. Her <b>gynecological</b> problems were largely caused by endometriosis, a disease from which she suffered throughout her adult life. Monroe was also briefly hospitalized during this time due to a barbiturate overdose. During the hiatus, she dismissed Greene from MMP and bought his share of the company as they could not settle their disagreements and she had begun to suspect that he was embezzling money from the company.|$|E
5|$|In 1925, Ferrari {{was called}} to assist a {{military}} wife during childbirth at the Hospital Militar Central of Buenos Aires, which had no <b>gynecological</b> unit. After she proposed that one be developed, Ferrari started the facility with one bed and donated equipment and supplies. The military gazette began advertising from June of that year that <b>gynecological</b> services were available from Mondays to Fridays at the hospital. As military wives {{became aware of the}} services, the growth was exponential and within five years Ferrari had expanded the service to two floors that housed a maternity unit with two delivery rooms, their own sterilization facility, a recovery unit, and forty beds in private rooms. She also developed a small sealed room with purified air and an incubator, {{the first of its kind}} in Argentina. Ferrari brought the techniques she had learned abroad to Argentina. Though radiology had been performed in other parts of the world for decades, there was resistance to implementing it by professionals who had no experience with it. Ferrari insisted it should be introduced and fought against the previous practice of surgical solutions for all cases, advocating that surgery only be used when absolutely necessary. A commemoration for the 10th anniversary of the maternity unit was attended by the Minister of War, the Director General of Health, the Hospital Director and other senior officials, as well as by children born over the past 10 years together with their families. A commission of the Marine wives who had received service from Ferrari's unit made a substantial donation. Despite her success, the atmosphere at the hospital remained hostile. Following the 1930 coup d'état of José Félix Uriburu with the country's shift to a more conservative stance during the Infamous Decade, Ferrari ultimately was forced to leave the hospital in 1939.|$|E
5|$|Not only do {{they affect}} injured people's self-image, these {{stereotypes}} are particularly harmful when held by counselors and professionals involved in rehabilitation. Caregivers affected by these culturally transmitted beliefs may treat their patients as asexual, particularly if the injury occurred {{at a young age}} and the patient never had sexual experiences. Failure to recognize injured people's sexual and reproductive capacity restricts their access to birth control, information about sexuality, and sexual health-related medical care such as annual <b>gynecological</b> exams. Another common belief that affects sexual rehabilitation is that sex is strictly about genital function; this could cause caregivers to discount the importance {{of the rest of the}} body and of the individual.|$|E
5|$|Obama {{was born}} on August 4, 1961, at Kapiʻolani Maternity & <b>Gynecological</b> Hospital in Honolulu, Hawaii. He is the first President {{to have been born}} in Hawaii, making him the first President born outside of the {{contiguous}} 48 states. He was born to a white mother and a black father. His mother, Ann Dunham (1942–1995), was born in Wichita, Kansas, of mostly English descent, with some German, Irish, Scottish, Swiss, and Welsh ancestry. His father, Barack Obama Sr. (1936–1982), was a married Luo Kenyan man from Nyang'oma Kogelo. Obama's parents met in 1960 in a Russian language class at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, where his father was a foreign student on scholarship. The couple married in Wailuku, Hawaii on February 2, 1961, six months before Obama was born.|$|E
5|$|Ferrari {{undertook}} additional medical {{study in}} Europe and the United States, learning pioneering techniques that she {{brought back to}} Argentina. She studied urinary tract monitoring at the Medical Faculty of Paris, earning the first diploma ever given to a woman. She designed a vaginoscope, studied radiation therapy at the Curie Institute, and performed a Caesarean section at Columbia University. She was responsible for bringing these innovations back with her to Argentina and implementing them at the maternity and <b>gynecological</b> unit she established at the Military Hospital. An ardent feminist, she established the Argentina Federation of University Women in 1936, and pushed for recognition of both {{civil and political rights}} for women. When the government of Argentina took a conservative turn in the late 1930s, she was pushed out of the hospital and later, in the early 1950s, out of teaching. She died in 1956.|$|E

25|$|Bertrand, who was {{diagnosed}} with ovarian cancer in 1999, also founded the Give Love Give Life organization with Trudell; their objective was to raise public consciousness about ovarian and other <b>gynecological</b> cancers {{through the use of}} music.

Bertrand and Trudell worked to organize strategic support in the music and film community for Johanna's Law, legislation to fund national outreach and education about the signs and symptoms of <b>gynecological</b> cancers, which was signed into law on January 12, 2007.

25|$|Dydrogesterone {{is used as}} an effective, orally active {{progestogen}} for <b>gynecological</b> conditions {{related to}} a wide variety of progesterone deficiencies in pregnant women. The molecular structure and pharmacological effects are somewhat similar to endogenous progesterone, although in smaller amounts it is found to be orally active. Its freedom from hormonal effects like those related to corticoid, androgenic, estrogenic, anabolic, and other effects gives dydrogesterone an advantage over other synthesized progestogens.|$|E
25|$|Only 41% {{of women}} with {{cervical}} cancer {{in the developing world}} get medical treatment. Therefore, prevention of HPV by vaccination may be a more effective way of lowering the disease burden in developing countries than cervical screening.

However, individuals in many resource-limited nations, Kenya for example, are unable to afford the vaccine.|$|E
25|$|Hysterectomies are {{sometimes}} performed with abdominoplasty.

25|$|A {{recent study}} lists the {{physical}} {{injury to the}} victims of war rape as traumatic injuries, sexually transmitted diseases, maternal mortality, un-wanted pregnancies, un-safe abortions, and persistent <b>gynecological</b> problems are of major concern. Because war rapes take place in zones of conflict, access to emergency contraception, antibiotics, and/or abortion are limited. Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is not uncommon. In certain war gang rape instances, the objective of infecting women interned in rape camps was the systematic effect of HIV soldiers specifically selected to spread HIV AIDS to the gang-raped.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, Romalis {{was shot}} and nearly killed by a sniper with a high-powered rifle firing into his home.
