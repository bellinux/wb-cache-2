[...] He then quoted Fields as saying that, [...] "Steven {{told me it was}} because I had cut the first picture that was a monumental success in which you can really see the editing. And people discovered that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> who edited Jaws." ...|$|E

I {{asked him if he}} minded if <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman,</b> and explained who Maggie Sawyer was and the role she would play in the future." [...] The concept for [...] "Insurgence" [...] also developed from an aspect of the Superman mythology that stemmed back to Superman’s original incarnation, which was his ability to leap tall buildings in a single bound. After their Thanksgiving break, the [...] "Smallville" [...] writers were in the writers' room when Miles Millar walked in and exclaimed, [...] "I think it's time for Clark to leap a tall building." [...] Jeph Loeb and the other writers had already been trying to develop a story that involved a hostage situation, and after Millar made his announcement the team suggested that they also pay homage to the Bruce Willis action film Die Hard. The setting for the hostage situation was LuthorCorp Plaza; the team introduced the [...] "Daily Planet", another pivotal piece of Superman lore that would one day employ Clark Kent and his alternate identity of Superman, by using it as the building that Clark uses to execute his [...] "first leap". [...] "Insurgence" [...] was actually written before [...] "Visage" [...] and [...] "Suspect", but not filmed until after both of those episodes because the team was having difficulty figuring out the logistics of producing the episode. Afterward, the episode would be scheduled to air between [...] "Visage" [...] and [...] "Suspect".|$|E
