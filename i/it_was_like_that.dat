500|$|The {{series was}} given a budget of $100 million (£58 million), the largest both HBO and the BBC had ever devoted to a series. The season was filmed between March 2004 and July 2005, at {{locations}} in or around Rome, and on a set considered [...] "to be {{the biggest and most}} expensive ever built for television." [...] It was built at Cinecittà, where the epic films Ben-Hur (1959) and Cleopatra (1963) had been filmed. Production designer Joseph Bennett built a set that emphasized authenticity and realism rather than grandiosity. He said, People think of Rome as white and cold and beautiful, powerful but distant. But based on the research, I don't think <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> at all. If you go to Pompeii, you're struck by how garish it is, even now. The temples and sculptures were all brightly painted. Rome was like Pompeii, but much bigger. And Rome was so noisy it was impossible to sleep. It was like hell. Think of it as a combination of New York and Calcutta, with insane wealth and insane poverty. It was pretty extreme.|$|E
2500|$|He {{told the}} {{documentary}} makers: [...] "All those {{that could be}} rescued were rescued. Many of them had amputations carried out underneath burning carriages {{so that they could}} be rescued. But many, of course, were trapped in such a position that they couldn't be got out or else the fire had taken hold and they couldn't be got to. And of course since then we've heard stories of some soldiers being shot and some soldiers possibly taking their own lives. It's never been formally documented. My own personal belief is that it probably did happen, in a sense of compassion, of mercy killing. It's almost impossible, sitting here, to comprehend what <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> morning." [...] However, the BBC said that this section of the interview with Watson would not be broadcast.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} touches {{one more than}} the big, {{idealized}} sort. One feels <b>it</b> <b>WAS</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> Oh! And look--the Francesca's! Aren't they lovely?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The end of <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> you see, Hugh {{went back}} to his wife, poor fellow. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> his duty, as a married man. Lord, Rachel," [...] he concluded, [...] "will <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> when we're married?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Gracious heaven, I didn't know <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> with him!" [...] {{said one}} of the men. [...] "I thought that fancy of his was over long ago." ...|$|E
60|$|She leant {{against the}} door-post, {{and gave him}} her hand. Charley took it in both his own with a {{tenderness}} beyond description, unless <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of a child holding a captured sparrow.|$|E
60|$|His {{voice was}} so thin and weak and {{trembling}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> {{of a little}} child ill with some fever. I saw that Pietro had nothing to say, and Orso was beginning to moan feebly.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'm sure I {{did not say}} {{anything}} wrong,' said Jane, 'and I suppose <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> A gentleman has to find out whom he likes best. And as he liked Miss Bolton best, I think it's a thousand pities they should be parted.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Joe Daniel, the {{co-founder of}} the Angular Recording Corporation which made the album said that: [...] "It isn't a 'live' album of a {{stand-up}} show. The material was put together specifically for the record, and in <b>that</b> respect <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> quaintly English format, the radio play." ...|$|R
30|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> {{noteworthy}} {{that the role}} of these support entities <b>is</b> not <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of a manager; rather, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of a steward supporting community-driven projects. For example, Riehle [15] demonstrates how FLOSS support entities manage and ensure the long- term survival of their projects. Examples of such support entities include ASF, Linux Foundation and Eclipse Foundation.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, Samkin, if <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> {{then perhaps}} {{what you did}} was not so far amiss. But {{it is hard to}} lose the old farm when my heart is buried deep in the good brown soil." ...|$|E

60|$|He {{had just}} remembered. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> in this life. You wake up, feeling as fit as a fiddle; {{you look at}} the window and see the sun, and thank Heaven for a fine day; you begin to plan a {{perfectly}} corking luncheon party with some of the chappies you met last night at the National Sporting Club; and then--you remember.|$|R
6000|$|... "You never guessed and I {{have no time}} to suffer," [...] she answered. [...] "So we go {{on until}} the {{breaking}} time comes, until one part of ourselves conquers and the other loses. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> rather <b>like</b> <b>that</b> just now with Andrew Tallente. A few more years and <b>it</b> will probably <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> with me." ...|$|R
60|$|One evening, we {{were sitting}} over our Chambertin, after a hard day's work, and Guy was listlessly turning over some letters, when {{suddenly}} he uttered a cry. Did you ever hear the trumpeting of a wounded elephant? <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "And, oh, I was {{so proud}} of you, Billy," [...] she said. [...] "I never saw you box before. I didn't know <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> The Iron Man was at your mercy all the time, and you kept it from being violent or terrible. Everybody could look on and enjoy--and they did, too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ugh!" [...] gasped the Indian chief. In vain {{he tried}} to shake off that grip. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of a bulldog {{and could not be}} loosened. He struck out wildly, but the pistol butt only landed upon Pawnee Brown's {{shoulder}}, a shoulder that was as tough as iron and could stand any amount of pounding.|$|E
6000|$|... "Such a {{thing is}} {{contrary}} to all reason and justice. A king has the same right to his crown as a noble to his estates, and none may justly take them away, save for treasonable practices; and a king cannot commit treason against himself. Therefore <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> there will <b>be</b> much trouble in England, and I fear {{that there is no}} chance of the truce that concludes, {{at the end of this}} month, being continued.|$|R
40|$|We have {{discuss the}} {{difference}} between intensity interferometry and measurement of two-particle correlations in detecting time-space scale in heavy-ion collisions. And we predict that the correlation function will raise along with the decreasing of invariant momentum difference for both fermions and bosons. And we find <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> the processes {{to analyze the data}} for this two methods. Then a process deduced from clearer theory base for researching the intensity interferometry in heavy-ion collisions is recommended following the discussion...|$|R
6000|$|... "'You know me,' he goes on. 'I ain't a quarrelsome sort of chap. If nobody says {{a word to}} me, I never says a word to anybody; and <b>it's</b> <b>been</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> {{ever since}} I left her, {{day in and day}} out, all just the same. Up in the morning, do your bit of work, drink your glass of beer, and to bed in the evening; nothing to excite you, nothing to rouse you. Why, it's a mere animal existence.' ...|$|R
60|$|The {{first to}} speak was Ballard. His eyes glanced round with an indomitable {{expression}} of scorn and indignation, which, as Diccon whispered, {{he could have}} felt to his very backbone. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of a trapped and maimed lion, as the man sat in his chair with crushed and racked limbs, but with a spirit untamed in its defiance.|$|E
6000|$|You {{know that}} blank non-existence into which one drops when one has taken [...] "gas." [...] For an {{indefinite}} interval <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> Then I heard Gibberne {{telling me to}} wake up, and I stirred and opened my eyes. There he stood {{as he had been}} standing, glass still in hand. It was empty, that was all the difference.|$|E
6000|$|... "Who can tell?" [...] she answered. [...] "A {{woman who}} lives well-nigh alone, as I live, {{in a quiet}} place, hears things so often that other folk never listen to. There's always {{something}} in my ears, night or day. Sometimes I am not sure whether it's in this world or the other. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> with me just then. It was for that reason I listened. Your luncheon's ready, sir." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mind and get {{something}} warm, Paolo; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> enough <b>that</b> we shall have to sleep {{more than once in}} the open air, and the winds are bitterly cold." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sublime! colossal!" [...] {{he would}} cry enraptured. [...] "If I had known <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{anything}} <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> I'd have stopped another day {{and had a}} look at it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure, your honour, 'tis {{not safe}} {{to be in}} the streets after nightfall. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> part of Paris where no dacent man could walk, without being {{assaulted}} by thieves and cutthroats. Dressed as we <b>are,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not likely anyone would interfere with us in the hope of finding money on us, but they are not particular at all, at all, and a party of these rascals might try to roll us in the mire, just for fun. So <b>it</b> <b>is</b> as well to be prepared." ...|$|R
60|$|He mused {{about the}} barrenness of the country. At Lanzarote, sixty {{miles from the}} African coast, it {{sometimes}} did not rain for six or eight months, and then, when the concrete cisterns were nearly dry, it rained in floods. Perhaps <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> in Morocco; sheep and camels could not live {{if it did not}} rain at all. Kit began to think about the good bishop who used all his fortune to send the people of Lanzarote water.|$|E
60|$|If {{only the}} storm would come! Julia {{seemed to take}} these words with her as she passed at last into the streets, at the stroke of the hour. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> with her, too. There was {{something}} inside, something around her heart, which was robbing her of her rest, haunting her through the long, lonely nights, torturing her through these miserable days. Soon {{she would have to}} turn and face it. She shivered with fear at the thought.|$|E
6000|$|... "I was a fool. My wanting you was all {{the sense}} I had. The strange thing was, from the {{beginning}} you were my guide, and I tried to use your rules. When I lost the men in Africa, I went back {{to look for them}} because I felt you would have me go. I was accountable, the job was mine, but I would not have known this had I not known you. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> before and afterwards----" ...|$|E
6000|$|This {{brought the}} laugh on the minister, but the lawyer cut it short: [...] "Well, then, I don't really {{see why the}} trades-unions are not as business-like as the syndicates in their {{dealings}} with all those outside of themselves. Within themselves they practise an altruism of the highest order, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a tribal altruism; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> which prompts a Sioux to share his last mouthful with a starving Sioux, and to take the scalp of a starving Apache. How <b>is</b> <b>it</b> with your trades-unions in Altruria?" [...] he asked my friend.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, by G-d, no {{more than}} yourself, but I won't. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> {{something}} <b>like</b> <b>that</b> stopped all the trade fifteen or twenty years ago. You {{have heard of the}} Loup?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So, {{that is your}} English boxing," [...] Osip said. [...] "I {{have heard}} of it, but I never thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{anything}} <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> Why, he never once touched you." ...|$|R
