40|$|The {{stack monitor}} uses {{long-range}} alpha detection (LRAD) {{technology for the}} measurement of radon levels in the stack emissions. The basic principle behind LRAD is the collection of ions created in air through the energy loss mechanisms of decay alphas. This is accomplished by establishing an electric field in the region where alpha decays will occur, and directing the ions via the field onto a biased plate. Accumulation of charge on the plate results in a current in the biasing circuit which can be read with a sensitive electrometer. In electrostatic LRAD designs, the linearity of the measured current with <b>gross</b> <b>alpha</b> <b>activity</b> is well-established. In order to determine radon- 222 levels {{in the presence of}} other radon isotopes, it is necessary to perform some type of isotopic analysis on the stack samples. In the present case, other radon isotopes of possible concern are radon- 219, which occurs in the decay chain of uranium- 235, and radon- 220, found in the decay chain of thorium- 232. Radon- 219, with a half-life of four seconds, presents no difficulty for the situation in which emanations from the vitrification process undergo as little as one minute of delay before release into the stack.

Gross alpha and beta activities, 238 U, 234 U, 226 Ra, 222 Rn, and 3 H concentrations were measured. Gross alpha and beta activities were determined by standard ISO 9696 and ISO 9697; for 226 Ra, 222 Rn and 3 H determination, liquid scintillation was used. 238 U and 234 U concentrations were determined by alpha spectrometry after separation from the matrix by extraction chromatography and electroplating. The results obtained revealed that, in most samples, gross alpha and gross beta were lower than the parameter value indicated in the international regulations. An attempt was also made to find a correlation between these results and the chemical parameters of waters. The results indicate, as expected, a good correlation between gross beta activity and 40 K concentration. In all samples uranium isotopes represent the principal radioactivity source. As the isotopic equilibrium is not always attained, all isotopes should be individually quantified. 226 Ra usually exhibits a lower concentration than uranium, however its determination is very important due to its higher radiotoxicity. 222 Rn concentration is very low in all the samples.

As far as the compliance with international regulations is concerned, recommended WHO guideline activity concentrations for drinking water were exceeded in 2 cases for <b>gross</b> <b>alpha</b> <b>activity</b> and were not exceeded in any case for gross beta activity. In the two samples with an alpha activity higher than 100 mBq L- 1, the sum of uranium and radium concentrations agrees well enough with the total alpha value...|$|E
40|$|The radon- 222 progeny and {{long-lived}} radionuclide measurements {{were done in}} a wet underground uranium mine in Saskatchewan, Canada, on Nov. 8 - 12, 1995. Radon- 222 in the mine varied from 2 kBq/m{sup 3 } at 90 m below surface to 12 kBq/m{sup 3 } in the mining areas, 240 m below surface. Radon- 222 progeny <b>activity</b> and potential <b>alpha</b> energy concentration appear affected by the airborne particle number concentration and size distribution. Particle number was up to 200 x 10 {sup 3 }/cm{sup 3 }. Only an accumulation mode (30 - 1000 nm) and some bimodal size distributions in this accumulation size range were significant. Diesel particles and combustion particles from burning propane caused a major modal diameter shift to a smaller size range (50 - 85 nm) compared with previous values (100 - 200 nm). The high particle number reduced the unattached progeny (0. 5 - 2 nm) to > 5 %. The nuclei mode (2 - 30 nm) in this test was nonexistent, and the coarse mode (> 1000 nm), except from the drilling areas and on the stopes, was mostly not measurable. Airborne particle total mass and long- lived radionuclide <b>alpha</b> <b>activity</b> concentrations were very low (80 - 100 {mu}g/m{sup 3 } and 4 - 5 mBq/m{sup 3 }) owing to high ventilation rates. Mass-weighted size distributions were trimodal, with the major mode at the accumulation size region, which accounts for 45 - 50 % of the mass. The coarse model contains the the least mass, about 20 %. The size spectra from <b>gross</b> <b>alpha</b> <b>activities</b> were bimodal with major mode in the coarse region (> 1000 nm) and a minor accumulation mode in the 50 - 900 nm size range. These size spectra were different from the {sup 222 }Rn progeny that showed a single accumulation mode in the 50 - 85 nm size region. The accumulation mode in the {{long-lived radionuclide}} size spectrum was not found in previous studies in other uranium mines...|$|R

40|$|Due to the {{importance}} of bottled mineral water in human diet with special regard to children in lactation period, a monitoring of natural radioactivity in some bottled mineral waters produced in Italy was performed. <b>Gross</b> <b>alpha</b> and beta <b>activities</b> and 226 Ra, 238 U, 234 U, and 210 Po concentrations were measured. <b>Gross</b> <b>alpha</b> and beta <b>activities</b> were determined by standards ISO 9696 and ISO 9697; for 226 Ra determination liquid scintillation was used. The 238 U and 234 U concentrations were determined by alpha spectrometry after their separation from matrix by extraction chromatography and electroplating. 210 Po was measured by alpha spectrometry. The results revealed that the concentrations (mBq L- 1) of 226 Ra, 238 U, 234 U, and 210 Po ranged from < 10. 00 to 52. 50, from < 0. 17 to 89. 00, from < 0. 17 to 79. 00, and from < 0. 04 to 21. 01, respectively. Uranium and radium concentrations do not reach the relevant recommended derived activity concentration (DWC). For polonium concentration, none of the samples reaches the relevant DWC in the case of adults and children, but one sample exceeds this value for infants. The dose contribution for different classes of age was calculated using the dose coefficient factors reported by EC Directive 96 / 29 EURATOM and certain annual intake. For children and adult age class, the calculated doses are quite similar and lower than 0. 1 mSv y- 1; for infants (< 1 y) in three cases the calculated dose ranges from 0. 11 to 0. 17 mSv y- 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{emergence}} of a radiological emergency {{as a result of}} radiological incident has a significant impact on a military operation. Details about the radiological situation are necessary for making timely informed decisions concerning the operating posture and for radiation exposure management. The initial information about identifying what radioactive materials are presented and the level of radioactive contamination of the environment, especially during the immediate and urgent phases of monitoring of radiation situation, are provided by field deployed laboratories. Their tasks are related to gross alpha/beta activity determination of air filters, swipes and water samples. The thesis deals with rapid determination of <b>gross</b> <b>alpha</b> <b>activity</b> (GAA) in field conditions. The thesis is focused mainly on increasing the capability and efficiency of measurements using the radiochemical separation method for sample preparation. The aim of this thesis is formation of an analytical method for rapid determination of GAA using liquid scintillation counting (LSC). The first part is focused on the current state of monitoring in a radiological emergency, then describes the capabilities of field deployed and stationary laboratories, especially in relation to alpha activity measurements, and introduces the gross activity and its determination. Subsequently it characterizes fundamentals of alpha decay and radiation and deals with current possibilities of detection. The principles and applications of detectors suitable for the alpha measurement and counting, i. e. Gas-Filled detectors, Semiconductor detectors and Scintillation detectors, are also mentioned. The last part of the theoretical part describes in details LSC and extraction chromatography, which are used in research. In the empirical part of the bachelor thesis the possibility of using Eichrom's Actinide Resin for rapid preconcentration of alpha particle emitters out of aqueous samples was investigated and then counted directly by LSC. The resin shows a strong affinity for actinides, and is very effective in accordance with long extracting and counting times. Based on that, kinetics of extraction was investigated by using short extracting and counting times in three observed levels of GAA in water - 1000 Bq/L, 100 Bq/L and 20 Bq/L. The results were compared with the rapid methods of measurements using the sample without modification by using the solid-state and LSC detector. Then factors possibly affecting the extraction of alpha radionuclides into the Actinide Resin were monitored. The first factor was the influence of pH of the appointed solution and the presence of beta radionuclide as the second factor. The measurements were realized by using Solid-state Scintillation Counter HandECount and Liquid Scintillation Counter TriathlerTM with 20 ml HDPE scintillation vials. AquaLight was used as LSC cocktail. 241 Am, 238 Pu and 90 Sr were selected as radionuclides for their military significance. The results showed that even after 30 minutes' extraction time, {{as in the case of}} 241 Am and 238 Pu, recovery was more than 90 % in all observed levels of GAA in water. The best results were achieved at lower activities (100 and 20 Bq/L), when after 30 minutes' recovery was 94 - 95 % for 241 Am and 95 - 96 % for 238 Pu. In the context of the pH effect of solution, it was found that a very acidic pH substantially disrupts extraction properties of the Actinide Resin. During the extraction of radionuclides in the high acidic environment, the efficacy was reduced up to 20 %. The effect of the presence of beta particle emitter was also observed. The resin showed affinity for 90 Sr. After 60 minutes' approximately 36 % of 90 Sr was extracted. Based on the results it can be stated that the LSC combined with sample preparation by resin is a suitable method for rapid determination of <b>gross</b> <b>alpha</b> <b>activity</b> in field conditions. Analytical method for the rapid determination of GAA is included in Annex of the thesis...|$|E
40|$|The Project Shoal Area (PSA) in Nevada was {{the site}} of a 12 -kiloton {{underground}} nuclear test in 1963. Although the surface of the site has been remediated, investigation of groundwater contamination resulting from the test is still in the corrective action process. Annual sampling and hydraulic head monitoring are conducted at the site as part of the subsurface corrective action strategy. Analytical results from the 2012 monitoring are consistent with those of the previous years, with tritium detected only in well HC- 4. The tritium concentration in groundwater from well HC- 4 remains far below the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency-established maximum contaminant level of 20, 000 picocuries per liter. Concentrations of total uranium and gross alpha were also detected during this monitoring period, with uranium accounting for nearly all the <b>gross</b> <b>alpha</b> <b>activity.</b> The total uranium concentrations obtained from this monitoring period were consistent with previous results and reflect a slightly elevated natural uranium concentration, consistent with the mineralized geologic terrain. Isotopic ratios of uranium also indicate a natural source of uranium in groundwater, as opposed to a nuclear-test-related source. Water level trends obtained from the 2012 water level data were consistent with those of previous years. The corrective action strategy for the PSA is currently focused on revising the site conceptual model (SCM) and evaluating the adequacy of the current monitoring well network. Some aspects of the SCM are known; however, two major concerns are the uncertainty in the groundwater flow direction and the cause of rising water levels in site wells west of the shear zone. Water levels have been rising in the site wells west of the shear zone since the first hydrologic characterization wells were installed in 1996. While water levels in wells west of the shear zone continue to rise, the rate of increase is less than in previous years. The SCM will be revised, and an evaluation of the groundwater monitoring network will be conducted when water levels at the site have stabilized...|$|E
40|$|Studies {{conducted}} in the 1960 s showed that radium was a fairly common constituent in ground water {{throughout much of the}} Midwest. Concentrations of 226 Ra ranging from 1 to 80 pCi/L (picoCuries per liter) were found in northern illinois, Iowa, and eastern Wisconsin (Rowland and others, 1977). The high radium values were associated with water from deep sandstone aquifers of Cambro-Ordovician age, but not with aquifers above or below. Additional studies and reports of radium in the Cambro-Ordovician aquifers by Gilkeson and Cowart (1982, 1987), Hahn (1984), and Weaver and Bahr (1991) further delineated distribution patterns and have suggested sources for the observed concentrations. Radium is a naturally occurring radioactive element, formed by radioactive decay of uranium and thorium. The most abundant radium isotope, 226 Ra, has a half-life of 1600 years and is part of the 238 U decay series. Two other isotopes, 228 Ra (half-life = 5. 76 years) and 224 Ra (half-life = 3. 7 days), are part of the 232 Th decay series. In 1976, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency published regulations that established contaminant levels for radioactivity and radioactive nuclides in public water systems. The maximum contaminant level (MCL) for <b>gross</b> <b>alpha</b> <b>activity</b> was not to exceed 15 pCi/L and the combined 226 Ra and 228 Ra activity in the water was not to exceed 5 pCi/L (Federal Register, 1976). The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency is reviewing the contaminant levels for radioactive nuclides in drinking water. Testing of public water supplies by the Minnesota Department of Health showed that many communities in the southern half of Minnesota were not in compliance with the drinking water standards for radium. Sampling of some municipal wells indicated that high radium levels were chiefly associated with water from the Mt. Simon-Hinckley aquifer, a sandstone aquifer of Late Cambrian/Middle Proterozoic age. A few wells in the Jordan Sandstone of Late Cambrian age also showed elevated radium levels. Because these data were obtained from municipal wells in communities with known radium problems, it was difficult to detect a pattern or to isolate specific radium-producing horizons within the aquifer(s). Therefore, the Minnesota Geological Survey sampled water from sole-source Mt. Simon-Hinckley wells to identify the distribution of radium within the regional geologic framework. Base-level data were also acquired on other radionuclides, the age of the water, and the water chemistry. Sole-source Mt. Simon-Hinckley wells were selected for sampling based on existing water-well information, and included wells previously monitored by the Minnesota Department of Health. The study area extended north to south from the town of Hinckley to the Root River basin, and west to east from the Mankato area to the Mississippi River. Complete coverage could not be obtained {{because of a lack of}} sole-source Mt. Simon-Hinckley wells in the south-central part of the aquifer. Several Jordan aquifer wells were also selected for sampling. The data accumulated in this study provide a starting point for selecting mitigation strategies or for choosing appropriate sites for future wells.

40|$|Four {{governmental}} agencies conducted {{a round of}} groundwater, surface water, and spring water sampling at the Los Alamos National Laboratory during 1998. Samples were split among the four parties and sent to independent analytical laboratories. Results from three of the agencies were available for this study. Comparisons of analytical results that were paired by location and date were made between the various analytical laboratories. The results for over 50 split samples analyzed for inorganic chemicals, metals, and radionuclides were compared. Statistical analyses included non-parametric (sign test and signed-ranks test) and parametric (paired t-test and linear regression) methods. The data pairs were tested for statistically significant differences, defined by an observed significance level, or p-value, less than 0. 05. The main conclusion is that the laboratories' performances are similar across most of the analytes that were measured. In some 95 % of the laboratory measurements there was agreement on whether contaminant levels exceeded regulatory limits.
