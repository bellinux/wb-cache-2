40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} cardiac {{findings in}} 31 Noonan syndrome patients. METHODS: Thirty-one (18 males and 13 females) patients from 26 families affected with Noonan's syndrome were evaluated from the cardiac {{point of view}} with electrocardiography and echodopplercardiography. RESULTS: Twenty patients had some type of cardiac abnormality. The most frequent was pulmonary valve stenosis followed by <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>myocardiopathy,</b> commonly associated with valve defects. Upper deviation of the QRS axis was observed in 80 % of these patients. CONCLUSION: In view of the high frequency and diversity of cardiac abnormalities present in Noonan syndrome, cardiac evaluation with electrocardiography and echocardiography should be performed in all patients diagnostically suspected of having this disease...|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} the study was to define {{spreading}} and quantitative criteria of left ventricular hypertrophy in echocardiography by using a "score" [...] for this, the left ventricle has been divided into 11 regions and a "score" attributed to each one of them [...] and to find the correlation with the vectocardiogram (VCG) in 42 patients with <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>myocardiopathy</b> (HM). The results obtained show the following: 1) the left ventricular hypertrophy aspect on the ECG and the VCG is very sensitive for the identification of a diffuse HM; 2) the necrosis, hemiblock or septal hypertrophy indicate a hypertrophy located in the forepart septum or the whole of the septum; 3) the giant T waves indicate a hypertrophy of the apex; 4) a left ventricular hypertrophy associated with a necrosis or a hemiblock indicate a global myocardiopathy, with the basal region of the septum largely affected...|$|E
40|$|Eight {{normotensive}} {{patients with}} electrocardiographic criteria for {{left ventricular hypertrophy}} with giant negative T waves were studied with Thallium- 201 imaging and M-mode echocardiography. In all the patients Thallium scanning demonstrated increased thickness of the left ventricular walls. In five of the above cases areas of increased uptake were noted in the apical region which had increased thickness {{as compared to the}} rest of the left ventricular wall. Echocardiography showed in one subject obstructive <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>myocardiopathy</b> and in another two asymmetric septal hypertrophy. In the remaining patients there was always present septal and posterior wall hypertrophy. Reliable echocardiograms of the apex were done in five subjects and in these hypertrophy was noted. The results of the two techniques were compared and correlated clinically and with the literature. The authors conclude in agreement with other studies that the picture of electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy with giant negative T waves is indicative of hypertrophic myocardiopathies. Specifically, for us, the apical hypertrophy may be the only feature of the myocardiopathy or be part of a generalized left ventricular hypertrophy which is usually asymmetric septal hypertrophy...|$|E
40|$|In 1882, Philippe Gaucher {{described}} a 32 -year-old woman with massive splenomegaly and unusually large {{cells in the}} spleen, which he called a “primary epithelioma of the spleen. ” The systemic nature and inheritance {{of the disease and}} its variants involving the viscera and CNS were described over the next century. The delineation of the causal enzymatic defects, genetics, molecular pathology, and genomics have provided pathogenic insights into the phenotypic spectrum and the bases for development of specific therapies for what is now known as Gaucher disease. As a prototype, the clinically and economically successful intracellular enzyme therapy provided the impetus for the expansion of similar research and therapeutic developments for other lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) and orphan diseases, including Fabry, Pompe, and Niemann-Pick diseases, as well as several mucopolysaccharidoses. Continuing studies of such LSDs, which occur as a group in more than 7000 live births, have revealed the complex molecular interdigitation with the autophagy and apoptotic pathways and proteostasis and the impact of disruptions of the lysosomal/autophagy and proteostasis systems on more common diseases has been recognized. Examples include age-related neurodegenerative diseases (eg, Parkinson disease and Gaucher disease), idiopathic <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>myocardiopathies,</b> stroke and renal failure (eg, Fabry disease), and Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease/Nonalcoholic SteatoHepatitis (NAFLD/NASH) and atherosclerosis (eg, lysosomal acid lipase deficiencies). Although perceived as rare, the availability of treatment and the impact of the LSDs on more common diseases require their integration into routine clinical practice...|$|R

[Article in Portuguese] Guimarães P, Teixeira F, Morais L, Alvares S. Unidade de Cardiologia Pediátrica, Hospital de Crianças Maria Pia. Abstract Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy {{is rare in}} neonates. The causes include metabolic disease, maternal diabetes, dexamethasone {{therapy in}} premature newborns for bronchopulmonary dysplasia and idiopathic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The authors present a case report regarding a neonate with transient hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, after acute fetal distress. Signs of congestive cardiac failure appeared at day 1. Echocardiography showed signs of mild pulmonary hypertension and normal ventricular wall thickness. Echocardiography on day 2 showed hypertrophy of myocardial walls affecting first the right ventricular anterior wall and the interventricular septum, followed by the left ventricular posterior wall. With therapy, clinical improvement was noted on day 4. The ventricular wall thickness was almost normal at three weeks. The authors alert physicians {{to the importance of}} echocardiographic examination of these neonates. PMID: 9580509 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE...|$|R
40|$|Major heart {{diseases}} such as ischemia and <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>myocardiopathy</b> are accompanied with {{significant changes in the}} passive mechanical properties and active contractility of myocardium. Identification of these changes helps diagnose heart diseases, monitor therapy, and design surgery. A dynamic cardiac elastography (DCE) framework is developed to assess the anisotropic viscoelastic passive properties and active contractility of myocardial tissues, based on the chamber pressure and dynamic displacement measured with cardiac imaging techniques. A dynamic adjoint method is derived to enhance the numerical efficiency and stability of DCE. Model-based simulations are conducted using a numerical left ventricle (LV) phantom with an ischemic region. The passive material parameters of normal and ischemic tissues are identified during LV rapid/reduced filling and artery contraction, and those of active contractility are quantified during isovolumetric contraction and rapid/reduced ejection. It is found that quasistatic simplification in the previous cardiac elastography studies may yield inaccurate material parameters. Copyright © 2006 Yi Liu et al.

40|$|ObjectivesThe {{long-term}} patency rate {{of coronary}} artery bypass grafting for which arterial grafts are used {{is known to be}} high in the pediatric population. However, this issue remains uncertain in children under 3 years of age. Here, we report the outcome in this specific population. MethodsFrom July 1988 to July 2007, 18 children less than 3 years of age (age at operation, 0. 1 – 35 months; median, 4 months) underwent 20 {{coronary artery bypass}} graft operations using an arterial graft. Indications for bypass grafting were coronary artery complications related to the arterial switch operation for transposition of the great arteries in 12 patients (coronary obstruction in 8 patients, peroperative coronary anomalies precluding coronary transfer in 4 patients), congenital anomalies of the coronary arteries in 4 patients, and Kawasaki disease in 2 patients. ResultsAfter a mean follow-up of 55 months (range, 1 – 176 months; median, 41 months), patency of 19 bypass grafts was assessed. One was occluded and 2 have necessitated a percutaneous procedure. Two patients died suddenly (1 with an occluded graft and 1 with a patent graft and <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>myocardiopathy)</b> 3. 5 and 4. 6 months, respectively, after bypass grafting. ConclusionsCoronary artery bypass grafting should be considered as a possible alternative for coronary revascularization in young children. Although our series shows quite a good patency rate, this procedure remains a technical challenge and requires careful follow-up...|$|E
40|$|Cardiac {{function}} is affected {{in up to}} 90 % of patients with Friedreich's ataxia, the most common spinocerebellar degenerative disease. Friedreich's ataxia typically causes motor abnormalities of the extremities, mainly impairing walking and the coordination of the legs and arms. The myocardium is affected at a later stage of the disease. The extent and timing of myocardial involvement determines the clinical course. Some patients have no cardiac symptoms and cardiac involvement can be established only by electrocardiographic or echocardiographic examination. In addition some pathological studies have found evidence of coronary abnormalities, mainly in the small vessels. There are no reports that such lesions cause angina. In a 16 year old patient chest pain on exercise had been the presenting symptom of Friedreich's ataxia {{at the age of}} 9. Considerable alterations in ventricular repolarisation on the electrocardiogram suggested a congenital coronary abnormality or <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>myocardiopathy.</b> The results of a Doppler echocardiography, Holter monitoring, and a haemodynamic study with coronary arteriography were all normal. An exercise test when the boy was 13 indicated significant changes in ventricular repolarisation. Myocardial scintigraphy (99 mTc-MIBI) at that time, however, was normal. He improved slightly when he was treated with verapamil. When he was 15 neurological symptoms developed and Friedreich's ataxia was diagnosed. Typical angina during exercise seems to have been the first symptom of Friedreich's ataxia...|$|E
40|$|Introducción y objetivos: la miocardiopatía hipertrófica es una enfermedad de origen genético con prevalencia de 1 % al 2 %. La mitad de los pacientes fallecen por muerte súbita cardiaca, la mayoría por arritmias {{ventricular}}es. Todavía no está claro a qué pacientes se les debe implantar un desfibrilador automático. El objetivo de este trabajo es describir una serie de pacientes con implante, los criterios empleados y los resultados obtenidos, así como analizar los predictores de terapia apropiada por el desfibrilador. Métodos: se incluyeron 20 pacientes que recibieron un desfibrilador de tercera generación. En todos se realizó estudio electrofisiológico y seguimiento prospectivo con registro de eventos. En 18 (90 %) se hizo estudio genético. Resultados: el 55 % eran hombres con edad promedio de 40 [11 - 78] años. Seis (30 %) recibieron implantante por prevención secundaria y 14 (70 %) por prevención primaria; los últimos por presentar varios factores de riesgo. Se indujo una arritmia sostenida en 15 (75 %) y en 3 (15 %) taquicardia ventricular monomórfica sostenida. A 22 meses de seguimiento 4 (20 %) sufrieron terapia apropiada y 2 (10 %) fallecieron. La taquicardia ventricular monomórfica clínica (p= 0, 03) y la inducida (p Introduction and objectives: <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>myocardiopathy</b> is {{a genetic}} entity with 1 % to 2 % prevalence. Half patients die of sudden cardiac death, most due to ventricular arrhythmias. There {{is still no}} clarity {{with regard to the}} patients to whom an automatic defibrillator has to be implanted. The objective of this work is to describe a series of patients with implant, the criteria used and the results obtained, as well as to analyze the predictors of appropriate therapy with the defibrillator. Methods: 20 patients that received a third generation defibrillator were included. Electrophysiological study and prospective follow-up with register of events was performed in all. Genetic study was done in 18 (90 %). Results: 55 % were men with mean age 40 (11 - 78) years. Six (30 %) received implant for secondary prevention and 14 (70 %) for primary prevention; the last ones because of several risk factors. A sustained arrhythmia was induced in 15 (75 %) and in 3 (15 %) monomorphic sustained ventricular tachycardia. At 22 months of follow-up, 4 (20 %) underwent appropriate therapy and 2 (10 %) died. Clinical monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (p= 0. 03) and the induced one (p< 0. 01) were significant therapy predictors. In 10 (56 %) a mutation was identified; in 8 (44 %) in the b-myosin gene. Conclusions: monomorphic sustained clinical ventricular tachycardia and the induced one were predictors of the appropriate defibrillator therapy in this series. The stratification based on the risk factors addition is actually a good option for primary prevention. Mutations in the heavy b-myosin chain are also the most frequent in our population...|$|E
