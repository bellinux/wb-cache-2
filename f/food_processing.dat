Processed food contains fewer antioxidant vitamins than fresh and uncooked foods, as preparation exposes food to heat and oxygen.|$|E

40|$|<b>Food</b> oral <b>processing</b> as {{the bridge}} between food texture, {{microstructure}} and sensory perception has gained enormous {{interest in the}} last decade. This review {{provides an overview of}} the role of the microstructure of soft- and semi-solid foods in <b>food</b> oral <b>processing</b> and sensory perception. Phase separated mixed protein polysaccharide gels and emulsion-filled gels are described as suitable model foods to investigate <b>food</b> oral <b>processing</b> systematically. Special attention is given to the sensory perception of texture, taste and interactions thereof. Several approaches to reduce the salt and sugar content of semi- and soft-solid foods without compromising taste are reviewed. These reduction approaches are based on an understanding of <b>food</b> oral <b>processing</b> in relation to the microstructure of the foods and its breakdown. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
