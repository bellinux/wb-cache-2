6000|$|Every fancy which dwells {{much with}} the unborn and immortal {{characters}} of Fiction must ask itself, Did the persons in contemporary novels never meet? In so little a world their paths must often have crossed, their orbits must have intersected, though we hear nothing about the adventure from the accredited narrators. In historical fiction authors make their people meet real {{men and women of}} history--Louis XI., Lazarus, Mary Queen of Scots, General Webbe, Moses, the Man in the Iron Mask, Marie Antoinette; the list is endless. But novelists, in spite of Mr. Thackeray's advice to Alexandre Dumas, and of his own example in [...] "Rebecca and Rowena," [...] have not introduced each other's characters. Dumas never pursued the fortunes of the Master of Ravenswood after he was picked up by that coasting vessel in the Kelpie's Flow. Sometimes a meeting between characters in novels by different hands looked all but unavoidable. [...] "Pendennis" [...] and [...] "David Copperfield" [...] came out simultaneously in numbers, yet Pen never encountered Steerforth at the University, nor did Warrington, in his life of journalism, jostle against a reporter named David Copperfield. One fears that the Major would have called Steerforth a tiger, that Pen would have been very loftily condescending to the nephew of Betsy Trotwood. But Captain Costigan would scarcely have refused to take a sip of Mr. Micawber's punch, and I doubt, not that Litimer would have conspired darkly with Morgan, the Major's sinister man. Most of those delightful sets of old friends, the Dickens and Thackeray people, might well have met, though they belonged to very different worlds. In older novels, too, it might easily have chanced that Mr. Edward Waverley of Waverley Honour, came into contact with Lieutenant Booth, or, after the Forty-five, with Thomas Jones, or, in Scotland, Balmawhapple might have foregathered with Lieutenant Lismahagow. Might not even Jeanie Deans have crossed the path of Major Lambert of the [...] "Virginians," [...] and been helped on her way by that good man? Assuredly Dugald Dalgetty in his wanderings in search of fights and fortune may have crushed a cup or rattled a <b>dicebox</b> with four gallant gentlemen of the King's Mousquetaires. It is agreeable to wonder what all these very real people would have thought of their companions in the region of Romance, and to guess how their natures would have acted and reacted on each other.|$|E

40|$|The {{neutron capture}} {{reaction}} {{is useful in}} identifying and analyzing the gamma-ray spectrum from an unknown assembly as it gives unambiguous information on its composition. This can be done passively or actively where an external neutron source is used to probe an unknown assembly. There are known capture gamma-ray data gaps in the ENDF libraries used by transport codes for various nuclear applications. The Evaluated Gamma-ray Activation file (EGAF) is a new thermal neutron capture database of discrete line spectra and cross sections for over 260 isotopes that was developed {{as part of an}} IAEA Coordinated Research Project. EGAF has been used to improve the capture gamma production in ENDF libraries. For medium to heavy nuclei the quasi continuum contribution to the gamma cascades is not experimentally resolved. The continuum contains up to 90 percent of all the decay energy an is modeled here with the statistical nuclear structure code <b>DICEBOX.</b> This code also provides a consistency check of the level scheme nuclear structure evaluation. The calculated continuum is of sufficient accuracy to include in the ENDF libraries. This analysis also determines new total thermal capture cross sections and provides an improved RIPL database. For higher energy neutron capture there is less experimental data available making benchmarking of the modeling codes more difficult. We use CASINO, a version of <b>DICEBOX</b> that is modified for this purpose. This can be used to simulate the neutron capture at incident neutron energies up to 20 MeV to improve the gamma-ray spectrum in neutron data libraries used for transport modelling of unknown assemblies...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{technique}} of self absorption {{has been applied}} {{for the first time}} to study the decay pattern of low-lying dipole states of 140 Ce. In particular, ground-state transition widths Γ 0 and branching ratios Γ 0 Γ to the ground state have been investigated in the energy domain of the pygmy dipole resonance. Relative self-absorption measurements allow for a model-independent determination of Γ 0. Without the need to perform a full spectroscopy of all decay channels, also the branching ratio to the ground state can be determined. The experiment on 140 Ce was conducted at the bremsstrahlung facility of the superconducting Darmstadt electron linear accelerator S-DALINAC. In total, the self-absorption and, thus, Γ 0 were determined for 104 excited states of 140 Ce. The obtained results are presented and discussed with respect to simulations of γ cascades using the <b>DICEBOX</b> code...|$|E

The ^ 186 W cross section was also independently confirmed from an activation measurement, following the decay of ^ 187 W, yielding values for σ_ 0 (^ 186 W) that are consistent with our prompt γ-ray measurement. The cross-section measurements were found to be insensitive to choice of level density or photon strength model, and only weakly dependent on E_ crit. Total radiative-capture widths calculated with <b>DICEBOX</b> showed much greater model dependence, however, the recommended values could be reproduced with selected model choices.

40|$|A {{new code}} has been {{developed}} named RAINIER that simulates the γ-ray decay of discrete and quasi-continuum nuclear levels for a user-specified range of energy, angular momentum, and parity including a realistic treatment of level spacing and transition width fluctuations. A similar program, <b>DICEBOX,</b> uses the Monte Carlo method to simulate level and width fluctuations but is restricted to γ-ray decay from {{no more than two}} initial states such as de-excitation following thermal neutron capture. On the other hand, modern reaction codes such as TALYS and EMPIRE populate a wide range of states in the residual nucleus prior to γ-ray decay, but do not go beyond the use of deterministic functions and therefore neglect cascade fluctuations. This combination of capabilities allows RAINIER to be used to determine quasi-continuum properties through comparison with experimental data. Several examples are given that demonstrate how cascade fluctuations influence experimental high-resolution γ-ray spectra from reactions that populate a wide range of initial states.

These measurements and additional data from the literature been compiled to generate the Evaluated Gamma-ray Activation File (EGAF), which is disseminated by LBNL and the IAEA. These data are nearly complete for most isotopes with Z< 20 so the total radiative thermal neutron capture cross sections can be determined directly from the decay scheme. For light isotopes agreement with the recommended values is generally satisfactory although large discrepancies exist for 11 B, 12, 13 C, 15 N, 28, 30 Si, 34 S, 37 Cl, and 40, 41 K. Neutron capture decay data for heavier isotopes are typically incomplete due to the contribution of unresolved continuum transitions so only partial radiative thermal neutron capture cross sections can be determined. The contribution of the continuum to theneutron capture decay scheme arises from {{a large number of}} unresolved levels and transitions and can be calculated by assuming that the fluctuations in level densities and transition probabilities are statistical. We have calculated the continuum contribution to neutron capture decay for the palladium isotopes with the Monte Carlo code <b>DICEBOX.</b> These calculations were normalized to the experimental cross sections deexciting low excitation levels to determine the total radiative thermal neutron capture cross section. The resulting palladium cross sections values were determined with a precision comparable to the recommended values even when only one gamma-ray cross section was measured.

40|$|We have {{measured}} precise {{thermal neutron}} capture {gamma}-ray cross sections {sigma}{sub {gamma}} for all stable Palladium isotopes with the guided thermal neutron beam from the Budapest Reactor. The data {{were compared with}} other data from the literature and have been evaluated into the Evaluated Gamma-ray Activation File (EGAF) [1]. Total radiative neutron capture cross-sections {sigma}{sub 0 } can be deduced from the sum of transition cross sections feeding the ground state of each isotope if the decay scheme is complete. The Palladium isotope decay schemes are incomplete, although transitions deexciting low-lying levels are known for each isotope. We have performed Monte Carlo simulations of the Palladium thermal neutron capture de-excitation schemes using the computer code <b>DICEBOX</b> [2]. This program generates a level scheme where levels below a critical energy E{sub crit} are taken from experiment, and those above E{sub crit} are calculated by a random discretization of an a priori known level density formula {rho}(E, J{sup {pi}}). Level de-excitation branching intensities are taken from experiment for levels below E{sub crit} and the capture state, or calculated for levels above E{sub crit} assuming an a priori photon strength function and applying allowed selection rules and a Porter-Thomas distribution of widths. The calculated feeding to levels below E{sub crit} can then be normalized to the measured cross section deexciting those levels to determine the total radiative neutron cross-section {sigma}{sub 0 }. In this paper we have measured {sigma}{sub 0 }[{sup 102 }Pd(n,{gamma}) ] = 0. 9 {+-} 0. 3 b, {sigma}{sub 0 }[{sup 104 }Pd(n,{gamma}) ] = 0. 61 {+-} 0. 11 b, {sigma}{sub 0 }[{sup 105 }Pd(n,{gamma}) ] = 21. 1 {+-} 1. 5 b, {sigma}{sub 0 }[{sup 106 }Pd(n,{gamma}) ] = 0. 36 {+-} 0. 05 b, {sigma}{sub 0 }[{sup 108 }Pd(n,{gamma}) (0) ] = 7. 6 {+-} 0. 6 b, {sigma}{sub 0 }[{sup 108 }Pd(n,{gamma}) (189) ] = 0. 185 {+-} 0. 011 b, and {sigma}{sub 0 }[{sup 110 }Pd(n,{gamma}) ] = 0. 10 {+-} 0. 03 b.

The results describedin this thesis demonstrate that Prompt Gamma Neutron Activation Analysis (PGAA) with cold neutrons is a reliable tool for the non-destructive analysis of actinides. Nuclear data required for an accurate identification and quantification of actinides wasacquired. Therefore, a sample design suitable for accurate and precise measurements ofprompt -ray energies and partial cross sections of long-lived actinides at existing PGAAfacilities was presented. Using the developed sample design the fundamental prompt-ray data on 237 Np, 241 Am and 242 Pu were measured. The data were validated by repetitiveanalysis of different samples at two individual irradiation and counting facilities –the BRR in Budapest and the FRM II in Garching near Munich. Employing cold neutrons,resonance neutron capture by low energetic resonances was avoided during theexperiments. This is an improvement over older neutron activation based works at thermalreactor neutron energies. 152 prompt -rays of 237 Np were identified, as well as 19 of 241 Am, and 127 prompt -rays of 242 Pu. In all cases, both high and lower energeticprompt -rays were identified. The most intense line of 237 Np was observed atan energy of E = 182. 82 (10) keV associated with a partial capture cross section of = 22. 06 (39) b. The most intense prompt -ray lines of 241 Am and of 242 Pu wereobserved at E = 154. 72 (7) keV with = 72. 80 (252) b and E = 287. 69 (8) keV with = 7. 07 (12) b, respectively. The measurements described in this thesis provide the firstreported quantifications on partial radiative capture cross sections for 237 Np, 241 Am and 242 Pu measured simultaneously over the large energy range from 45 keV to 12 MeV. Detaileduncertainty assessments were performed and {{the validity of the}} given uncertaintieswas demonstrated. Compared to existing literature data on prompt -ray energies andemission probabilities the uncertainties of the data were improved. In addition to the basic nuclear data necessary for PGAA, the thermal radiative neutroncapture cross sections of 237 Np and of 241 Am were determined from decay measurementsafter neutron irradiation. The thermal radiative neutron capture cross section of 237 Npwas determined as 0 c = 176. 3 (47) b. The thermal radiative neutron capture cross sectionof 241 Am was determined as 0 c = 667. 7 (312) b. The thermal radiative neutron capturecross section of 242 Pu was calculated as 0 c = 21. 9 (15) b using nuclear structure simulationswith the statistical decay code <b>DICEBOX,</b> constraint by the measured prompt -raydata. In the corresponding simulation the total radiative width of the capture state wasfound to be 28 (1) meV. Also, the neutron separation energies of 238 Np and of 243 Pu werederived. The neutron separation energy of 238 Np was calculated as Sn = 5488. 02 (17) keV. The neutron separation energy of 243 Pu was calculated as Sn = 5036. 33 (59) keV.
