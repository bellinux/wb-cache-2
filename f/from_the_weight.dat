5|$|Bupropion, {{when used}} for {{treating}} obesity {{over a period}} of 6 to 12 months, may result in weight loss of 2.7kg over placebo. This is not much different <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> loss produced by several other medications, such as sibutramine or orlistat. It has been studied in combination with naltrexone. Concerns from bupropion include an increase in blood pressure and heart rate. In September 2014, a combination (bupropion/naltrexone) was approved by the US FDA for the treatment of obesity.|$|E

5|$|As {{the glaciers}} of the Wisconsin {{glaciation}} began to recede from the Hudson Valley area, a glacial lake {{known today as}} Lake Albany extended across the mid and upper Hudson Valley and a large delta formed west of Albany where the predecessor of the Mohawk River flowed into the lake. Along the shoreline of the lake, lacustrine sands were deposited between the present-day cities of Hudson and Glens Falls; this became the Hudson Valley sandplain. Relieved <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> of the glacier, the land began to rebound, and the lake receded by draining into the Hudson River. The deposits of sand in the delta area were gradually sculpted by wind into sand dunes. Plants later colonized the land and stabilized the dunes. The Pine Bush originally occupied , or 60,000 acres, at which point {{it was the largest}} inland pine barrens in North America.|$|E

Though questioned by the police after Erin's death, both Wendy and Kevin are let go. Assuming that whoever was next must be dead, they decide to ensure their own safety. While leaving the police station, Wendy is stalked by a grief-stricken Ian.|$|E
5|$|Before the battle, {{a section}} from the 2 RAR Medium Machine Gun Platoon had been {{stationed}} within the American perimeter near Hill 111 to provide covering fire across {{the area between}} the positions occupied by the US Marines and the Australians. Commanded by Sergeant Brian Cooper they soon found themselves {{in the thick of}} the fighting, firing their Vickers machine-guns in support of the Australian positions and to defend themselves <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> of the Chinese main attack which fell on the Marines. Three men were wounded during the night but the machine-gunners continued to fire in support, while the remainder of the section repelled Chinese assaults from the left. Ultimately the Chinese were unable to dislodge them, with the Australians calling-in artillery on to their own positions during repeated Chinese attempts to overrun them as the US Marines withdrew past their position, leaving them isolated. When dawn came dozens of Chinese bodies were found strewn in front of the Australian machine-gunners. As the US Marines worked to clear the Chinese stragglers from their position the Australians had endeavoured to coax a Chinese soldier from a bunker, yet when he resisted they were forced to kill him with a grenade. Cooper was later awarded the Military Medal for his leadership, with the stubborn defence of the Australians contributing to the break-up of the Chinese attack which at one stage had threatened to overrun the Marine position. Large groups of Chinese remained though, occupying a number bunkers and trenches, and they were not finally dislodged by the Marines until the following afternoon.|$|E

25|$|Wine {{made from}} the Chenin blanc grape can be dated to the 9th century in {{vineyards}} belonging to the Glanfeuil Abbey located just south of Angers {{in what is now}} Le Thoureil. Angevin wines have been held in high esteem since the Middle Ages but were mostly limited to local French markets. Unusual for the time Anjou was known for its unique winemaking technique of blending vin de presse, the wine extracted from pressing the grapes, with the vin de goutte or free run juice that came <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> of gravity pressing the grape. This vin de presse added extra tannins and color to the wine but could limit the wine's appeal for being consumed young.|$|E
25|$|The {{boat was}} {{calibrated}} {{by measuring the}} height of the gunwales above water level at each corner with the boat unladen and then measured again when known weights had been loaded into the boat from an overhead gantry. These measurements were logged in toll-keeper's tables and copies sent to every toll office within the boat's trading range. At toll offices if a toll collector suspected an incorrect waybill (declared cargo) {{the height of the}} four corners of the boat were checked with a gauging stick and averaged to allow for uneven cargo loading. That boat's entry in the gauging table was used to determine the cargo weight. The toll fee was worked out <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> and cargo type.|$|E
25|$|In unconsolidated aquifers, {{groundwater}} {{is produced}} from pore spaces between particles of gravel, sand, and silt. If the aquifer is confined by low-permeability layers, the reduced water {{pressure in the}} sand and gravel causes slow drainage of water from the adjoining confining layers. If these confining layers are composed of compressible silt or clay, the loss of water to the aquifer reduces the water pressure in the confining layer, causing it to compress <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> of overlying geologic materials. In severe cases, this compression can be observed on the ground surface as subsidence. Unfortunately, much of the subsidence from groundwater extraction is permanent (elastic rebound is small). Thus, the subsidence is not only permanent, but the compressed aquifer has a permanently reduced capacity to hold water.|$|E

25|$|Between 250 and 300 {{million years}} ago, {{freshwater}} streams flowing from ancient mountains brought silt, {{sand and gravel}} into {{what is now the}} Gulf of St. Lawrence. These sediments accumulated to form a sedimentary basin, and make up the island's bedrock. When the Pleistocene glaciers receded about 15,000 years ago, glacial debris such as till were left behind to cover most of the area that would become the island. This area was connected to the mainland by a strip of land, but when ocean levels rose as the glaciers melted this land strip was flooded, forming the island. As the land rebounded <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> of the ice, the island rose up to elevate it further from the surrounding water.|$|E
25|$|After {{the planes}} struck the {{buildings}}, {{but before the}} buildings collapsed, the cores of both towers consisted of three distinct sections. Above and below the impact floors, the cores consisted of what were essentially two rigid boxes; the steel in these sections was undamaged and had undergone no significant heating. The section between them, however, had sustained significant damage and, though they were not hot enough to melt it, the fires were weakening the structural steel. As a result, the core columns were slowly being crushed, sustaining plastic and creep deformation <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> of floors above. As the top section tried to move downward, however, the hat truss redistributed the load to the perimeter columns. Meanwhile, the perimeter columns and floors were also being weakened by {{the heat of the}} fires, and as the floors began to sag they pulled the exterior walls inwards. In the case of 2 WTC, this caused the eastern face to buckle, transferring its loads back to the failing core through the hat truss and initiating the collapse. In the case of 1 WTC, the south wall later buckled in the same way, and with similar consequences.|$|E
25|$|On 28 January 1915 USRC Unalga became USCGC Unalga {{by virtue}} of the {{establishment}} of the United States Coast Guard by merger of the United States Revenue Cutter Service with the United States Life-Saving Service. In February 1915 additional duties were assigned enforcing the North Pacific Fur Seal Convention of 1911 which related to prohibited pelagic sealing in the Bering Sea. Patrol work during 1915 and 1916 consisted of summers in Alaskan waters with sealing treaty duties, law enforcement, search and rescue, medical assistance to fishermen and others, and the delivery of mail to remote camps. Winters were spent at various locations along the Pacific Northwest coast doing law enforcement patrol work. In January 1917, Unalga was assigned her first winter patrol in Alaskan waters at the urging of representatives of the fishing industry to provide medical services to crews of fishing vessels as well as search and rescue work in remote waters. She stopped in Sitka, Alaska to investigate reports of a measles epidemic and to take on more coal for her first winter mission into the Gulf of Alaska. Unalgas first winter patrol was begun 30 January during a squall with hurricane force winds that iced the cutter over and threaten to sink her with the additional weight. After the starboard whaleboat was smashed by heavy seas and the radio masts snapped <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> of ice, Captain Frederick Dodge made for the shelter of Yakutat Bay. The cutter was listing starboard at twenty degrees and the crew had to clear ice from the decks and machinery with axes and steam hoses. The crew of Unalga spent the next week repairing damage to the cutter while the surgeon treated the ills of inhabitants of Yakutat and gave the resident missionary a short course in medicine. Each time the cutter would leave the shelter of the bay another gale would appear, but Dodge took care to seek shelter before the cutter was as severely iced as the first time. Unalga was recalled to Seattle on 6 March after steaming 3000 miles, boarding 342 vessels, having given medical aid to 19 individuals of whom three were fishermen.|$|E
