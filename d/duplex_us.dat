50|$|Large format SLR {{cameras were}} {{probably}} first marketed {{with the introduction}} of C.R. Smith's Monocular <b>Duplex</b> (<b>U.S.,</b> 1884). SLRs for smaller exposure formats were launched in the 1920s by several camera makers. The first 35mm SLR available to the mass market, Leica's PLOOT reflex housing along with a 200mm f4.5 lens paired to a 35mm rangefinder camera body, debuted in 1935. The Soviet Спорт (“Sport”), also a 24mm by 36mm image size, was prototyped in 1934 and went to market in 1937. K. Nüchterlein's Kine Exakta (Germany, 1936) was the first integrated 35mm SLR to enter the market. Additional Exakta models, all with waist-level finders, were produced up to and during World War II. Another ancestor of the modern SLR camera was the Swiss-made Alpa, which was innovative, and influenced the later Japanese cameras. The first eye-level SLR viewfinder was patented in Hungary on August 23, 1943 by Jenő Dulovits, who then designed the first 35 mm camera with one, the Duflex, which used a system of mirrors to provide a laterally correct, upright image in the eye-level viewfinder. The Duflex, which went into serial production in 1948, was also the world's first SLR with an instant-return (a.k.a. autoreturn) mirror.|$|E
40|$|AbstractPurpose. To measure patients' {{preferences}} for magnetic resonance (MR) angiography and duplex ultrasound (US) in the imaging work-up of {{peripheral arterial disease}} (PAD). Methods. Ninety-eight patients, who underwent both MR angiography and <b>duplex</b> <b>US,</b> received a questionnaire by mail and their {{preferences for}} imaging work-up were assessed in a telephone interview. The questionnaire consisted of one question on which imaging test they preferred, a rating scale score ranging from 0 (not bothersome at all) to 10 (extremely bothersome), and specific questions on whether patients experienced discomfort due to the imaging work-up. Responses were presented as means and frequencies, and differences were tested by non-parametric tests. Results. Half of the patient population (50 %) had no preference for MR angiography or <b>duplex</b> <b>US,</b> 41 % had a preference for MR angiography, and 9 % had a preference for <b>duplex</b> <b>US.</b> The average rating scale scores for MR angiography (1. 6) and <b>duplex</b> <b>US</b> (1. 7) {{were not significantly different}} (p= 0. 53). Four out of 98 (4 %) patients responded that they experienced pain during the MR angiography versus 18 (18 %) for <b>duplex</b> <b>US</b> (p= 0. 001). Eight out of 98 (8 %) patients responded that they were anxious during the MR angiography versus 1 (1 %) for <b>duplex</b> <b>US</b> (p= 0. 02). Conclusion. The results suggest that the majority of patients have no preference between MR angiography and <b>duplex</b> <b>US</b> in the diagnostic work-up of PAD.

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{cost-effectiveness}} of noninvasive imaging strategies {{in patients who}} have had a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke and are suspected of having significant carotid artery stenosis. From 1997 through 2000, 350 patients were included in a multicenter blinded consecutive cohort study. The sensitivities and specificities of duplex ultrasonography (US), magnetic resonance (MR) angiography, and these two examinations combined were estimated by using digital subtraction angiography (DSA) as the reference standard. The actual costs (from a societal perspective) of performing imaging and endarterectomy were estimated. The survival, quality of life, and costs associated with stroke were based on data reported in the literature. Markov modeling was used to predict long-term outcomes. Subsequently, a decision model was used to calculate costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental costs per QALY gained for 62 examination-treatment strategies. Extensive sensitivity analyses were performed. <b>Duplex</b> <b>US</b> had 88 % sensitivity and 76 % specificity with use of conventional cutoff criteria. MR angiography had comparable values: 92 % sensitivity and 76 % specificity. Combined concordant <b>duplex</b> <b>US</b> and MR angiography had superior diagnostic performance: 96 % sensitivity and 80 % specificity. <b>Duplex</b> <b>US</b> alone was the most efficient strategy. Adding MR angiography led to a marginal increase in QALYs gained but at prohibitive costs (cost-effectiveness ratio > 1 500 000 per QALY gained). Performing DSA owing to discordant <b>duplex</b> <b>US</b> and MR angiographic findings and to confirm <b>duplex</b> <b>US</b> and MR angiographic findings led to extra costs and QALY loss owing to complications. Sensitivity analyses revealed that <b>duplex</b> <b>US</b> as a stand-alone examination remained the preferred strategy while estimates and assumptions were varied across plausible ranges. <b>Duplex</b> <b>US</b> performed without additional imaging is cost-effective in the selection of symptomatic patients suitable for endarterectomy.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the accuracy and reliability of <b>duplex</b> Doppler ultrasound (<b>US)</b> and computerized tomography (CT) in staging patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Sixty-six patients were evaluated pre-operatively with duplex Doppler ultrasound and CT. The results were compared with the surgical and histopathological findings.

40|$|The authors {{examined}} 110 {{patients with}} suspected pathologic {{conditions of the}} thyroid by means of color-coded <b>duplex</b> <b>US.</b> In addition to the information yielded by conventional US, this technique allows organ vascularization to be demonstrated. Five normal patients were considered as a control group: no tissue vascularization was demonstrated in these cases. In 8 patients presenting with carcinoma or recurrences, vascularization was markedly increased both peripheral and central to the nodule. A few doubts are still to be solved as to the diagnostic value of color-coded <b>duplex</b> <b>US</b> {{in the evaluation of}} non-carcinomatous nodular pathologic conditions. As a matter of fact, non-functioning avascular adenomas can be demonstrated only in a very low percentage of cases (66 %).

40|$|AbstractPurposeThe Dialysis Outcome Quality Initiative (DOQI) {{guidelines}} {{recommend that}} arteriovenous fistulas (AVF) be constructed {{in at least}} 50 % of hemodialysis access procedures. Preoperative duplex ultrasound (US) scanning and venography may increase options for AVF with identification of veins that are not clinically evident. However, maturation of autogenous fistulas created {{on the basis of}} findings at <b>duplex</b> <b>US</b> scanning and venography has not been carefully examined. MethodsFrom January 1999 to July 2002, 256 new hemodialysis access procedures were performed in 202 patients in an academic tertiary care center. If physical examination failed to disclose adequate vessels for hemodialysis access, patients underwent <b>duplex</b> <b>US</b> scanning mapping. Venography was performed when no usable vein or only a basilic vein was identified at <b>duplex</b> <b>US</b> scanning. Functional maturation rate and mean maturation time (time from fistula creation to initiation of hemodialysis) were determined. This experience was compared with that in a group of 128 patients in whom 148 hemodialysis access fistulas were created before we implemented liberal use of preoperative <b>duplex</b> <b>US</b> scanning and venography (January 1997 –December 1998). ResultsFrom January 1999 to July 2002, preoperative <b>duplex</b> <b>US</b> scanning was performed in 68 % of patients, and venography in 32 % of patients. Autogenous fistula creation rate increased from 61 % to 73 % in all patients with hemodialysis access fistulas (P =. 15) and from 66 % to 83 % in patients undergoing a first access procedure (P <. 05). The use of basilic vein transposition also increased, from 3 % in the earlier period to 13 % in the later period (P <. 05). Mean maturation time for arteriovenous fistulas was 70 days. Functional maturation rate decreased from 73 % to 57 % (P <. 05) after implementation of preoperative imaging and more aggressive vein use. ConclusionImplementation of preoperative <b>duplex</b> <b>US</b> scanning and venography as a component of a more aggressive protocol to create native fistulas was pivotal in exceeding DOQI guidelines for hemodialysis access. However, this approach resulted in the unintended sequela of decreased fistula maturation rate.

Patients and methodsOne hundred consecutive patients referred because of suspected or proved peripheral arterial occlusive disease to a University Hospital underwent both aortoiliac <b>duplex</b> <b>US</b> scanning and multi-station total outflow CE-MRA. For 73 of these patients (57 % men; mean age, 62 years) treatment or treatment plans could be retraced. Eighteen patients also underwent femoro-popliteal <b>duplex</b> <b>US</b> scanning. Three experienced vascular surgeons retrospectively formulated two sets of treatment plans based on standardized clinical parameters and either <b>duplex</b> <b>US</b> scanning or CE-MRA. The main outcome measure was proportion of patients for whom the treatment plan matched actual treatment without additional use of intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography. Actual treatment, based on all available information, including results of <b>duplex</b> <b>US</b> scanning, CE-MRA, and any other diagnostic tests, served as the standard of reference. ResultsDuplex US scanning provided enough information for treatment planning in 46, 45, and 53 patients versus 67, 68, and 66 patients when CE-MRA was used (surgeons 1, 2, and 3, respectively; surgeons 1 and 2, P <. 001; surgeon 3, P =. 007). Treatment plans based on <b>duplex</b> <b>US</b> scanning exactly matched actual treatment in 37 of 73 patients (51 %; surgeon 1), 36 of 73 patients (49 %; surgeon 2), and 46 of 73 patients (63 %; surgeon 3). Treatment plans based on CE-MRA exactly matched actual treatment in 56 of 73 patients (77 %; surgeon 1), 55 of 73 patients (75 %; surgeon 2), and 51 of 73 patients (70 %; surgeon 3). Positive predictive value and negative predictive value of <b>duplex</b> <b>US</b> scanning as measures of ability to discriminate between surgical and nonsurgical treatment were 0 of 0 (undefined) and 43 of 46 (93 %), 1 of 2 (50 %) and 40 of 43 (93 %), and 5 of 5 (100 %) and 44 of 48 (92 %) for surgeons 1, 2, and 3, respectively. For CE-MRA, positive and negative predictive values were 11 of 13 (85 %) and 50 of 54 (93 %), 10 of 12 (83 %) and 51 of 56 (91 %), and 8 of 13 (62 %) and 48 of 53 (91 %), respectively, for surgeons 1, 2, and 3.

40|$|PURPOSE: To prospectively {{determine}} the clinical and economic consequences of replacing duplex ultrasonography (US) with contrast material-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) angiography {{for the initial}} imaging work-up of patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This randomized multicenter study {{was approved by the}} institutional review board of each hospital, and all patients signed written informed consent prior to randomization. Patients with PAD who needed to undergo imaging work-up and who had an ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) of less than 0. 90 were recruited by vascular surgeons between January 2002 and September 2003. Patients were randomly assigned to undergo contrast-enhanced MR angiography or <b>duplex</b> <b>US.</b> The primary outcome measure was cost. Secondary outcome measures included therapeutic confidence, changes in disease severity, and changes in quality of life (QOL) assessed during 6 months of follow-up. Indicators for disease severity were based on the Rutherford classification, treadmill walking distance, ABPI at rest, and ABPI after exercise. QOL was assessed with the Rating Scale, Short Form 36, EuroQol- 5 D, and VascuQol questionnaires. The cost of (additional) imaging procedures, therapeutic interventions, and outpatient visits were calculated from a hospital perspective (ie, all costs incurred inside the hospital were estimated, including physician costs). Data were evaluated by using the Student t test and a multivariable linear regression analysis. RESULTS: At 6 months, 352 patients (239 [68 %] men, 113 [32 %] women; mean age, 65 years) were analyzed. The use of contrast-enhanced MR angiography versus <b>duplex</b> <b>US</b> reduced the number of additional vascular imaging procedures by 42 %; contrast-enhanced MR angiography was also associated with higher therapeutic confidence. Diagnostic costs for contrast-enhanced MR angiography were 167 euros (186 dollars) higher than those for <b>duplex</b> <b>US</b> (P . 05). CONCLUSION: Replacing <b>duplex</b> <b>US</b> with contrast-enhanced MR angiography for the initial imaging work-up of patients with PAD reduces the need for additional imaging, although diagnostic costs are higher...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{assess the}} {{technical}} feasibility of multi-detector row computed tomographic (CT) angiography {{in the assessment}} of peripheral arterial bypass grafts and to evaluate its accuracy and reliability in the detection of graft-related complications, including graft stenosis, aneurysmal changes, and arteriovenous fistulas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four-channel multi-detector row CT angiography was performed in 65 consecutive patients with 85 peripheral arterial bypass grafts. Each bypass graft was divided into three segments (proximal anastomosis, course of the graft body, and distal anastomosis), resulting in 255 segments. Two readers evaluated all CT angiograms with regard to image quality and the presence of bypass graft-related abnormalities, including graft stenosis, aneurysmal changes, and arteriovenous fistulas. The results were compared with McNemar test with Bonferroni correction. CT attenuation values were recorded at five different locations from the inflow artery to the outflow artery of the bypass graft. These findings were compared with the findings at duplex ultrasonography (US) in 65 patients and the findings at conventional digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in 27. RESULTS: Image quality was rated as good or excellent in 250 (98 %) and in 252 (99 %) of 255 bypass segments, respectively. There was excellent agreement both between readers and between CT angiography and <b>duplex</b> <b>US</b> in the detection of graft stenosis, aneurysmal changes, and arteriovenous fistulas (kappa = 0. 86 - 0. 99). CT angiography and <b>duplex</b> <b>US</b> were compared with conventional DSA, and there was no statistically significant difference (P >. 25) in sensitivity or specificity between CT angiography and <b>duplex</b> <b>US</b> for both readers for detection of hemodynamically significant bypass stenosis or occlusion, aneurysmal changes, or arteriovenous fistulas.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{evaluate}} the diagnostic performance of non- invasive imaging methods of detecting carotid artery stenosis in comparison to digital subtraction angiography (DSA) by undertaking a systematic review of the literature. The non-invasive methods reviewed include multislice computed tomography (MSCT) angiography, duplex ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance (MR) angiography. A search of medical databases (PubMed, Medline, ScienceDirect, Proquest) of the English literature was performed and 22 studies with 68 comparisons were found to meet the selection criteria and included in our study. 5 studies were performed with MSCT angiography, 11 with <b>duplex</b> <b>US</b> and 13 with MR angiography. Both <b>duplex</b> <b>US</b> and MR angiography were studied in 7 out of 24 US and MR studies. The diagnostic value of each imaging modality was reviewed in terms of the sensitivity and specificity compared to DSA, which is regarded as the standard method. The mean sensitivity and specificity for MSCT angiography, <b>duplex</b> <b>US</b> and MR angiography were 88 % (95 % CI: 83 %, 92 %) and 90 % (95 % CI: 85 %, 94 %), 88 % (95 % CI: 81 %, 94 %) and 89 % (95 % CI: 85 %, 94 %), 94 % (95 % CI: 90 %, 97 %) and 89 % (95 % CI: 85 %, 92 %), respectively based on overall assessment.

40|$|Purpose: To {{assess the}} {{effectiveness}} and cost-effectiveness of state-of-the-art noninvasive diagnostic imaging strategies {{in patients with}} a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke who are suspected of having carotid artery stenosis (CAS). Materials and Methods: All prospectively evaluated patients provided informed consent, and the local ethics committee approved this study. Diagnostic performance, treatment, long-term events, quality of life, and costs resulting from strategies employing duplex ultrasonography (US), computed tomographic (CT) angiography, contrast material-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) angiography, and combinations of these modalities were modeled in a decision tree and Markov model. Data sources included a prospective diagnostic cohort study, a meta-analysis, and {{a review of the}} literature. Outcomes were costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, and net health benefits (QALY-equivalents), with a willingness-to-pay threshold of (sic) 50 000 per QALY and a societal perspective. The strategy with the highest net health benefit was considered the most cost effective. Extensive one-way, two-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to explore the effect of varying parameter values were performed. The reference case analysis assumed that patients underwent surgery 2 - 4 weeks after the first symptoms, and the effect of earlier intervention was explored. Results: The reference case analysis showed that <b>duplex</b> <b>US</b> combined with CT angiography and surgery for 70 %- 99 % stenoses was the most cost-effective strategy, with a net health benefit of 13. 587 and 15. 542 QALY-equivalents in men and women, respectively. In men, the CT angiography strategy with a 70 %- 99 % cutoff yielded slightly more QALYs, at an incremental cost of (sic) 71 419 per QALY, compared with <b>duplex</b> <b>US</b> combined with CT angiography. In patients with a high-risk profile, in patients with a high prior probability of disease, and when patients could be treated within 2 weeks after the first symptoms, the CT angiography strategy with surgery for 50 %- 99 % stenoses was the most cost-effective strategy. Conclusion: In diagnosing CAS, <b>duplex</b> <b>US</b> should be the initial test, and, if its results are positive, CT angiography should be performed; patients with 70 %- 99 % stenoses should then undergo carotid endarterectomy. In patients with a high-risk profile, a high probability of CAS, or who can undergo surgery without delay, immediate CT angiography and surgery for 50 %- 99 % stenoses is indicated.

40|$|Objective: The {{best way}} to manage both {{symptomatic}} and asymptomatic severe carotid stenoses has been thoroughly demonstrated by large randomized clinical trials, but less {{is known about the}} natural history and management of the contralateral asymptomatic internal carotid artery (ICA). This prospective study was undertaken to determine whether disease progressed in the contralateral ICA of patients who had undergone carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and were followed up clinically and by duplex ultrasound (US) scan. Methods: The contralateral asymptomatic ICAs of 599 patients who had undergone CEA for severe carotid disease over a 10 -year period were followed up clinically and with <b>duplex</b> <b>US</b> scan at 1 month and then every 6 months.

40|$|AbstractPurposeSeveral {{factors have}} been related to {{long-term}} survival after open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. The effect of carotid stenosis on outcome {{has not yet been}} examined. We performed an open prospective study to evaluate the prognostic significance of carotid stenosis on long-term survival of patients who had undergone elective operative repair of AAA. MethodsTwo hundred eight patients who underwent elective open AAA repair in our department between March 1987 and December 2001 were included in the study. All patients were evaluated preoperatively with color duplex ultrasound (US) scanning of the carotid arteries, and were followed up with clinical examination and carotid <b>duplex</b> <b>US</b> scanning 1 month after the operation and every 6 months thereafter. Median duration of follow-up was 50 months (range, 5 - 181 months). Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, as well as all causes of mortality, were recorded and analyzed with regard to traditional risk factors and carotid US findings. ResultsTwenty-seven fatal and 46 nonfatal cardiovascular events were recorded. Both univariate and multivariate analysis showed that carotid stenosis 50 % or greater and echolucent plaque were significantly associated with cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. Carotid stenosis was a stronger predictor of cardiovascular death than was ankle/brachial index. Age, hypercholesterolemia, coronary artery disease, and diabetes mellitus were also associated with higher mortality and morbidity from cardiovascular causes. ConclusionPatients electively operated on for AAA repair and with stenosis 50 % or greater and echolucent plaque at <b>duplex</b> <b>US</b> scanning are at significantly increased risk for cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. Carotid US can therefore be used to select a subgroup of patients with AAA who might benefit from medical intervention, including antiplatelet and lipid-lowering agents...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} contrast material–enhanced ultrasonography (US) for {{depiction of}} endoleaks after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (or endovascular aneurysm repair [EVAR]) {{in patients with}} aneurysm enlargement and no evidence of endoleak. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From November 1998 to February 2003, 112 patients underwent EVAR. At follow-up, <b>duplex</b> <b>US</b> and biphasic multi– detector row computed tomographic (CT) angiography were performed. In 10 patients (group A), evident aneurysm enlargement was observed, with no evidence of complications, at both CT angiography and <b>duplex</b> <b>US.</b> Group A patients, 10 men (mean age, 69. 6 years 10 [standard deviation]), underwent US after intravenous bolus injection of a second-generation contrast agent, with continuous low–mechanical index (0. 01 – 0. 04) real-time tissue harmonic imaging. Group B patients, 10 men (mean age, 71. 3 years 8. 2) with aneurysm shrinkage and no evidence of complications, and group C patients, 10 men (mean age, 73. 2 years 6) with CT angiographic evidence of endoleak, underwent contrast-enhanced US. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was performed in groups A and C. Endoleak detection and characterization were assessed with imaging modalities used in groups A–C; at contrastenhanced US, time of detection of endoleak, persistence of sac enhancement, and morphology of enhancement were evaluated. RESULTS: In group A, contrast-enhanced US depicted one type I, six type II, one type III, and two undefined endoleaks that were not detected at CT angiography. All leakages were characterized by slow and delayed echo enhancement detected at longer than 150 seconds after contrast agent administration. DSA results confirmed findings in all patients; percutaneous treatment was performed. In group B, contrast- enhanced US did not show echo enhancement; in group C, results with this modality confirmed findings at CT angiography and DSA. CONCLUSION: Contrast-enhanced US depicts endoleaks after EVAR, particularly when depiction fails with other imaging modalities. © RSNA, 200...|$|E
30|$|VMs were {{diagnosed}} {{by a combination}} of clinical examination and noninvasive studies, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), <b>duplex</b> ultrasonography (<b>US),</b> and plain film radiography, and were confirmed by fluoroscopic imaging using direct puncture. The treatment modality was determined by a multidisciplinary team in our vascular malformation clinic, involving interventional radiologists, plastic surgeons, orthopedists, pediatric surgeons, dermatologists, and pathologists. The indications for invasive treatment included worsening pain, increased swelling, reduced function, and severe cosmetic disfigurement, based on balance between the degree of symptoms and the risk of intervention.|$|R

30|$|During the six-year study period, 2, 618 trauma {{patients}} were enrolled. Mean age was 48.7 years and 1, 885 patients (72 %) were male. Blunt injury accounted for 2, 339 patients (89 %), and mean injury severity score was 20. Blood products were transfused in 572 patients (22 %) and 1, 144 (44 %) required operation or interventional radiology within 24 hours of arrival. In-hospital mortality was 13 %. By using <b>duplex</b> <b>US,</b> 916 {{patients were}} screened for DVT. Of those 916 patients, 29 patients (3 %) developed proximal DVT and 202 patients (22 %) developed distal DVT during ICU stay. Among 2, 618 trauma patients, 2 patients (0.2 %) developed massive or submassive PE during ICU stay, of which one died due to PE. There were 10 cases (0.4 %) of non-massive or non-submassive PE identified by contrast enhanced CT as well.|$|E
40|$|Objective: This was a {{prospective}} analytic study that aimed {{to compare the}} agreement between CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA/CTV) and ultrasonography (US) for diagnosis of thromboembolic disease and determine the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the 2 tests using the presence of thromboembolic disease as a reference standard. Methods: 76 consecutive patients who were referred for CTPA at the Radiology department of Aga Khan University Hospital over an 8 month period between December 2008 and July 2009 {{were included in the}} study. All the patients underwent combined CTPA/CTV according to the usual departmental protocol. They subsequently had bilateral lower limb <b>duplex</b> <b>US</b> within 24 hours of the CTPA/CTV study. Results for {{the presence or absence of}} DVT were analyzed for both CTV and US. Presence of thromboembolic disease was defined by a composite reference standard and this was used to determine the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for both tests. Results: 73 patients were included in the final analysis. The 2 imaging tests had similar results in 62 (84. 93 %) patients; CTV was positive and US was negative in 7 (9. 6 %) patients, while CTV was negative and US was positive in 4 (5. 5 %) patients. There was a moderate level of agreement (k= 0. 528) between CTV and US for detection of DVT. CTV had a much higher sensitivity (94. 1 %), specificity (100 %), PPV (100 %), NPV (98. 2 %) compared to US (58. 9 %, 94. 6 %, 76. 9 %, 88. 3 % respectively) when the presence of thromboembolic disease was used as a reference standard. Conclusion: CTV has higher sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for detection of asymptomatic DVT compared to US when the presence of venous thromboembolic disease is used as a reference standard. Therefore, in patients suspected to have PE, CTV can be used to detect DVT without an additional <b>duplex</b> <b>US</b> examination...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Anterior {{triangle}} masses pose {{an important}} clinical dilemma. It {{is very difficult}} to distinguish the potential pathologies pre operatively by clinical and radiological assessment. CASE REPORT: The first case highlights the management of a bilateral chemodectoma, the second case is a presentation of castleman's disease and the third is that of metastatic tonsillar adenocarcinoma. All three cases had a similar presentation and radiological appearance pre-operatively. CONCLUSION: Anterior triangle masses span the clinical spectrum of pathologies from chemodectoma to castleman's disease to carcinoma. Expert vascular and radiological management is required for optimum patient care and should take place in a tertiary referral centre. <b>Duplex</b> <b>US,</b> CTA and MRA are important pre operative assessment tools to ensure that adequate information regarding the relationship of the lesion to the carotid artery is available to the operating surgeon who should have vascular expertise as deliberate practice volume has been repeatedly shown to result in improved patient outcome...|$|E
50|$|US 202 enters Connecticut in {{the town}} of Danbury <b>duplexed</b> with <b>US</b> 6. The <b>duplex</b> joins another <b>duplex,</b> I-84 and <b>US</b> 7 at I-84 Exit 4 to form a 3 mile four-way concurrency. US 7 and 202 split from I-84 and US 6 at Exit 7. They remain duplexed on a freeway for a short stretch before 202 exits the freeway at the first exit (Exit 11) at the Brookfield town line to follow Federal Road, a two-lane road that was an old {{alignment}} of US 7. The two roads reunite {{at the end of the}} US 7 freeway about 5.3 mi later just before the New Milford town line. The 2 roads split again in the center of New Milford as US 202 turns east to cross the Housatonic River. It then turns northeast to pass through Washington and Morris (briefly), before entering Litchfield. Route 202 passes through the historic downtown district, where it intersects Route 63 and has a connection with Route 118 which heads toward the western suburbs of Hartford. It then enters Torrington, where it meets the Route 8 expressway at Exit 44. Leaving Torrington, US 202 passes through New Hartford before entering Canton. Just after crossing the Farmington River in western Canton, US 202 starts a <b>duplex</b> with <b>US</b> 44 through Canton and the southwest corner of Simsbury into Avon. In the center of Avon, as US 44 leaves the duplex to the east, US 202 is joined from the east by Route 10, as both turn northward. <b>US</b> 202 (<b>duplexed</b> with Route 10) then reenters Simsbury, and then enters Granby. After a brief triplex with Route 189 in the center of town, the <b>US</b> 202/Route 10 <b>duplex</b> crosses the Massachusetts state line into the town of Southwick. At this point, US 202 officially changes from a signed east-west to a signed north-south route, although signage north of Avon shows both 202 and 10 (the latter correctly so) as signed north-south.|$|R
