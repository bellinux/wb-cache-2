40|$|AbstractThe {{retrieval}} of the optical properties of desert aerosols in suspension within terrestrial dust devils is presented with possible future application for martian dust devils. The transmission of light through dust devil vortices {{was measured in}} situ to obtain the wavelength-dependent attenuation by the aerosols. A Monte Carlo model was applied to each dust devil with the retrieved optical properties corresponding to the set of parameters which lead to the best model representation of the observed transmission spectra. The retrieved optical properties agree well with single scattering theory and are consistent with previous studies of dust aerosols. The enhanced absorption observed for dust devils with a higher tangential wind speed, and in comparison to atmospheric aerosol studies, suggests that larger dust particles are lofted and suspended around dust devil vortices. This analysis {{has shown that the}} imaginary refractive indices (and thus the optical properties of the suspended dust) are generally overestimated when these larger <b>dust</b> grains <b>entrained</b> by <b>dust</b> devils are neglected. This will lead to an overestimation of the amount of solar radiation absorbed by the small particles that remain in suspension after the dust devil terminates. It is also demonstrated that a 10 % uncertainty in the particle size distribution of the <b>dust</b> <b>entrained</b> in the <b>dust</b> devils can result in a 50 % increase in the predicted amount of incident solar radiation absorbed by the dust particles once the dust devil has terminated. The method used here provides the capability to retrieve the optical properties of the <b>dust</b> <b>entrained</b> in martian <b>dust</b> devils by taking advantage of transits over surface spacecraft which are capable of making optical measurements at ultraviolet and visible wavelengths.

The properties of these constituents, {{and their relationship to}} the fine dust grains which surround them, suggest that they led an extended existence in a gaseous protoplanetary nebula prior to their incorporation into their parent primitive bodies. In this paper we explore in some detail the velocities acquired by such particles in a turbulent nebula. We treat velocities in inertial space (relevant to diffusion), velocities relative to the gas and <b>entrained</b> microscopic <b>dust</b> (relevant to accretion of dust rims), and velocities relative to each other (relevant to collisions). We extend previous work by presenting explicit, closed-form solutions for the magnitude and size dependence of these velocities in this important particle size regime, and compare these expressions with new numerical calculations.

Data from the 1990 s indicates that shield dust liberation had increased {{to an average of}} 23 percent. Increased longwall production levels over this time resulted in the need to move a larger number of shields during each shift, while an increase in air velocities on the face was also occurring.

40|$|Over {{the past}} several decades, orbital {{observations}} of lofted dust have revealed the importance of mineral aerosols as a climate forcing mechanism on both Earth and Mars.

We present a review of orbital observations of <b>entrained</b> <b>dust</b> on Earth and Mars, particularly that produced by the dust-laden structures produced by daytime convective turbulence called “dust devils”. On Earth, dust devils are thought to contribute {{only a small fraction}} of the atmospheric dust budget; accordingly, there are not yet any published accounts of their occurrence from orbit. In contrast, dust devils on Mars are thought to account for several tens of percent of the planet’s atmospheric dust budget; the literature regarding martian dust devils is quite rich. Because terrestrial dust devils may temporarily contribute significantly to local dust loading and lowered air quality, we suggest that martian dust devil studies may inform future studies of convectively-lofted dust on Earth...|$|E

Chinese Yi Lan pulverized oil shale 0 – 3 mm was used as feed.

The shale char formed from oil shale in the pyrolyzer mixed with shale ash is recirculated to the fluidized-bed combustor, where it is burnt by incoming air (as fluidizing agent) to form shale ash at about 700 °C and is recycled to the pyrolyzer as hot solid heat carrier.

40|$|Dust is an {{important}} source of bioaerosols including bacteria. In this study, the microbiology and meteorology of specific dust storms in Australia were investigated. The samples were collected from two dust events in April 2009 that were characterised by intense cold fronts that <b>entrained</b> <b>dust</b> from the highly erodible and drought-stricken Mallee and Riverina regions of Victoria and central NSW. In the first storm, the dust travelled eastward over Canberra and Sydney, and in the second storm, the dust travelled east/southeastward over Canberra and Melbourne. Rain fell on both cities during the second dust storm. Dust and rain samples were collected, cultured, and the composition compared using polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). Multiple bands were evident on DGGE indicative of a diverse microflora, and identification of several bands confirmed the presence of multiple genera and species representing three phyla. Numerous bands represented Bacillus species, and these were present in multiple dust samples collected from both Canberra and Melbourne. Interestingly, the microflora present in rain samples collected in Canberra during the second dust storm was quite different and the DGGE banding patterns from these samples clustered separately to most dust samples collected at the same time. Identification of several DGGE bands and PCR products from these rain samples indicated the presence of Pseudomonas species.

Like other HH jets in the region, this bipolar collimated flow emerges {{from the head of}} a dark dust pillar. However, HH 1019 is unique because [...] unlike all other HH jets known to date [...] it is identified by a linear chain of dark, dusty knots that are seen primarily in silhouette against the background screen of the H II region. Proper motions confirm that these dark condensations move along the jet axis at high speed. [S II] emission traces a highly collimated jet that is spatially coincident with these dust knots. The high extinction {{in the body of the}} jet suggests that this outflow has lifted a large amount of dust directly from the disk, although it is possible that it has <b>entrained</b> <b>dust</b> from its surrounding protostellar envelope before exiting the dust pillar. If dust in HH 1019 originates from the circumstellar disk, this provides further evidence for a jet launched from a range of radii in the disk, including those outside the dust sublimation radius. HH 1019 may be the prototype for a new subclass of dusty HH objects seen primarily in extinction against the background screen of a bright H II region.

40|$|Under certain {{operating}} conditions, polychlorinated {{dioxins and furans}} {{occur in}} the flue gases of thermal processing plants. Current EU Directives limit the concentration of these emissions to less than 0. 1 ng toxicity equivalents (TEQ) per standard cubic metre of dry gas at 11 vol% O- 2. These Directives {{have been included in}} the emission regulations of most of the EU countries. Dioxins and furans are not particular to incinerators; they can also originate from metallurgical and other thermal processes when these are operated under unfavourable conditions. Adsorption methods employing non-flammable carbonaceous adsorbents (activated carbon, lignite) are particularly well suited for removing PCDD/Fs. For adsorption, which requires the sorbent to be brought in contact with the gas to be cleaned, various processes are currently available, ie classical adsorption in moving/fixed bed filters or the technique of adsorption in an <b>entrained</b> <b>dust</b> cloud with a downstream fabric filter or electrostatic precipitator to remove the spent sorbent from the waste gas (entrained process). The paper will firstly assess both adsorption concepts; it will then use results obtained from operational tests in incineration plants for municipal and industrial waste to describe the efficiency of the dioxin-sorption in an entrained bed (pneumatic transport of pulverized adsorbent) and a fixed/moving bed (granular adsorbent). Variations in the dosing rate and the use of different adsorbents, as well as the operating temperature, identify the selection criteria for determining the process-engineering optimum for flue gas cleaning.

A number have been identified, however, notably absent, is an influential wave commonly found in planetary atmospheres and oceans: the planetary Rossby wave (PRW). Since, in the Earth's atmosphere, the PRW is of primary importance in shaping large-scale meteorological phenomena, it is reasonable to consider whether it might have similar importance in the protoplanetary nebula. The thrust of the research project this summer (1998) was to determine whether a nebular analog to the PRW is viable, a so-called nebular Rossby wave (NRW), and if so, to explore possible ramifications of this wave {{to the evolution of}} the nebula. This work was carried out primarily by S. Davis, J. Cuzzi and me, with significant discussions with P. Cassen. We believe we have established a good case for the NRW and as a result believe we have opened up a new and possibly interesting line of research in regard to the nebular development, in particular with regard to zonal jet formation, a potent accretion mechanism, and possible ties to vortex formation.

40|$|Soil {{moisture}} {{increased the}} cohesion potential between particles, reducing {{the ability of}} the particle to be <b>entrained.</b> <b>Dust</b> suppression techniques are designed to increase soil moisture and therefore soil cohesion through the application of water or water-based chemicals to surfaces that have known potential for dust entrainment. Rainfall has the ability to act as a natural dust suppression mechanism; however, there is a paucity of literature on the actual effectiveness of rainfall in this regard. The ASTM D 1739 methods for dustfall monitoring, commonly used in South Africa, and the National Dust Control Regulations (2013), both state that rainfall should be recorded when conducting dustfall monitoring. The rationale is that rainfall or the absence thereof, results in lower or higher dustfall rates, respectively. A suitable study site was identified in Mpumalanga, South Africa. This site had eight non-directional dustfall samplers in the near vicinity of an air quality monitoring station. Dustfall results from the eight samplers were analysed based on four scenarios, two that considers the presence of rainfall and two that consider the absence of rainfall. This analysis was further combined with wind speed data. This study, over a 24 -month period indicates that there is no substantial evidence that above average rainfall will result in below average dustfall. This occurred for one month out of 24 months. Conversely, there is no consensus that the absence of rainfall will result in higher dustfall rates, which occurred cumulatively 30 % of the time. Additional environmental and / or operational information may have a greater influence on dustfall compared to rainfall. Careful consideration should be taken to prevent misrepresentation of causational effects of rainfall on dustfall results. Management of dust should be undertaken through dust mitigation measures irrespective of the natural rainfall regime...|$|E
40|$|Dust devils are {{vortices}} of air made visible by <b>entrained</b> <b>dust</b> particles. Dust devils {{have been}} observed on Earth and captured in many Mars lander and orbiter images. Martian dust devils may be important to the global climate and are parameterised within Mars Global Circulation Models (MGCMs). We show that the dust devil parameterisation in use within most MGCMs results in an unexpectedly high level of dust devil activity during morning hours. In contrast to expectations, based on the observed behaviour of terrestrial dust devils and the diurnal maximum thermal contrast at the surface, we find that {{large areas of the}} modelled Martian surface experience dust devil activity during the morning {{as well as in the}} afternoon, and that many locations experience a peak in dust devil activity before mid-sol. Using the UK MGCM, we study the amount of surface dust lifted by dust devils throughout the diurnal cycle as a proxy for the level of dust devil activity occurring. We compare the diurnal variation in dust devil activity with the diurnal variation of the variables included in the dust devil parameterisation. We find that the diurnal variation in dust devil activity is strongly modulated by near-surface wind speeds. Within the range of daylight hours, higher wind speeds tend to produce more dust devil activity, rather than the activity simply being governed by the availability of heat at the planet's surface, which peaks in early afternoon. We compare our results with observations of Martian dust devil timings and obtain a good match with the majority of surface-based surveys. We do not find such a good match with orbital observations, but these data tend to be biased in their temporal coverage. We propose that the generally accepted description of dust devil behaviour on Mars is incomplete, and that theories of dust devil formation may need to be modified specifically for the Martian environment. Further dust devil observations are required to support any such modifications...|$|E

The analysis shows that three characteristic particle sizes are exposed to different physics in different boundary layer zones, a function of the distance from the helicopter.

The greatest likelihood for entraining dust into the high velocity airstream may occur as shields are advanced allowing relatively dry particles to fall from the shield canopy directly into the airstream. Laboratory tests to simulate dust liberation during shield movement were conducted at the Pittsburgh Research Laboratory of NIOSH at velocities ranging from 2. 0 to 8. 2 m/s (400 to 1600 fpm).

Therefore, better understanding of its optical properties {{with a focus on}} SSA is of great importance. Here, we entrain ten bulk soil samples from deserts and semi-arid regions in the Arabian Peninsula, from locations representative of the Sahara and Sahel in North Africa, and from Northeast Africa and South-Central Asia.

The lack of nuclear reddening in broad absorption line quasars may be explained by sputtering of grains in the outflows. Comment: 29 pages, 9 figures, submitted to Ap...|$|R
40|$|During a 9 -month {{campaign}} (1996 – 1997), the Midcourse Space Experiment (MSX) satellite mapped the Galactic Plane at mid-infrared wavelengths (4. 3 – 21. 3 µm). The {{much greater}} spatial resolution and {{sensitivity of the}} MSX 8. 3 µm band compared to IRAS at 12 µm has revealed diffuse emission not seen before. Here we report evidence for a spectacular limb-brightened, bipolar structure at the Galactic Center extending more than a degree (170 pc at 8. 0 kpc) {{on either side of}} the plane. The 8. 3 µm filamentary emission appears confined to a dome-shaped shell which extends perpendicular to the plane, and shows a tight correlation with the 3, 6 and 11 cm continuum emission over the same scales. The most likely scenario is that the extraplanar 8. 3 µm emission arises from <b>dust</b> <b>entrained</b> in a large-scale bipolar wind powered by a central starburst. The inferred energy injection at the source is ∼ 10 54 /κ erg for which κ is the covering fraction of the dusty shell (κ ∼ 10 4 /ε supernovae, where ε is the thermalizatio...|$|R
40|$|We have {{performed}} hydrodynamic and radiative transfer calculations of a photoevaporating disc around a Herbig Ae/Be star {{to determine the}} evolution and observational impact of <b>dust</b> <b>entrained</b> in the wind. We find that the wind selectively entrains grains of different sizes at different radii resulting in a dust population that varies spatially and increases with height above the disc at radii > 10 AU. This variable grain population results in a 'wingnut' morphology to the dust density distribution. We calculate images of this dust distribution at NIR wavelengths that also show a wingnut morphology at all wavelengths considered. We have also considered the contribution that crystalline dust grains will have {{in the wind and}} show that a photoevaporative wind can result in a significant crystallinity fraction at all radii, when the disc is edge-on. However, when the disc's photosphere is unobscured, a photoevaporative wind makes no contribution to the observable crystallinity fraction in the disc. Finally, we conclude that the analysis of extended emission around edge-on discs could provide a new and independent method of testing photoevaporation models.

40|$|Late in {{the gaseous}} {{phase of a}} protostellar disk, centimeter-sized bodies {{probably}} settle into a thin ``dust layer'' at the midplane. A velocity difference between the dust layer and the gas gives rise to turbulence, which prevents further settling and direct gravitational instability of the layer. The associated drag {{on the surface of}} the layer causes orbital decay in a few thousand years [...] -as opposed to a few hundred years for an isolated meter-sized body. Within this widely-accepted theoretical framework, we show that the turbulent drag causes radial instabilities even if the selfgravity of the layer is negligible. We formulate axisymmetric, height-integrated dynamical equations for the layer that incorporate turbulent diffusion of mass and momentum in radius and height, vertical settling, selfgravity, and resistance to compression due to gas <b>entrained</b> within the <b>dust</b> layer. In steady-state, the equations describe the inward radial drift of a uniform dust layer. In perturbation, overdense rings form on an orbital timescale with widths comparable to the dust-layer thickness. Selfgravity is almost irrelevant to the linear growth rate but will eventually fragment and collapse the rings into planetesimals larger than a kilometer. We estimate that the drag instability is most efficient at 1 AU when most of the ``dust'' mass lies in the size range 0. 1 - 10 meters. Comment: 25 pp., 2 figures. Uses aastex version 5. 0...|$|R
40|$|Researchers {{studying}} dust generation from blasthole drills {{developed a}} simple, quick fix that reduced respirable dust concentrations {{by more than}} 63 % at the dump point. This device, which requires almost no maintenance, is small and inexpensive, and it will help operators maintain compliance to the dust standard. The thought process was that a reduction of respirable dust {{at any of the}} multiple sources on the drill, in this case the dust collector dump point, should reduce the total respirable dust generated by the drill. The U. S. Mine Safety & Health Administration (MSHA) has a coal respirable dust standard of 2 milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m 3) for an 8 -hour shift. MSHA and mine operators periodically collect personal dust samples to determine compliance with this dust standard. Drill operators have one of the highest exposure levels to respirable dust. This has been proven through many reviews of the MSHA dust sampling database. Prior to 1987, the highwall driller at surface coal mines had the most severe exposure to respirable silica dust, a trend that continues today based on MSHA's respirable dust sampling database. A review of the MSHA database for the years 1985 through 1992 shows that 81 % of the respirable silica dust samples taken exceeded the permissible exposure limit for the highwall drill operator at surface coal mines. A more recent review of the MSHA database, for the years 1996 through 2000, shows that only 31 % of the respirable silica dust samples taken exceeded the respirable silica dust limit for the highwall driller at surface coal mines. This suggests a substantial improvement in preventing the exposure of silica dust to the highwall drill operator. The drill operator, however, still tops the list of job occupations that have the highest exposure to respirable silica dust Respirable dust {{has been shown to be}} harmful to human health, especially when silica is present in the dust. It causes a disease known as silicosis, which can occur in three levels: chronic silicosis, which occurs after 10 years of exposure; accelerated silicosis, which occurs between 5 and 10 years of exposure; and acute silicosis, which can occur within a few weeks to five years of very high exposure to silica dust. Respirable dust consists of the dust particle size fraction whose median diameter is 4 micrometers (m). The drilling machine generates high concentrations of respirable dust from several sources: drill table shroud leakage, dust leakage through the table bushing, dust discharge from the dust collector exhaust due to impaired filters, and <b>dust</b> <b>entrained</b> from the <b>dust</b> collector fines dumped onto the bench. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health's (NIOSH) Pittsburgh Research Lab (PRL) has been studying different methods to reduce respirable dust from these sources. During its testing, the institute identified a simple solution that reduces the amount of respirable dust generated at the collector dump point...|$|R
