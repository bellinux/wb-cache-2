2500|$|Power-tube {{distortion}} {{is required}} for amp sounds in some genres. In a standard master-volume guitar amp, as the amp's final or master volume is increased beyond the full power of the amplifier, power tube distortion is produced. The [...] "power soak" [...] approach places the attenuation between the power tubes and the guitar speaker. In the re-amped or [...] "dummy load" [...] approach, the tube power amp drives a mostly resistive <b>dummy</b> <b>load</b> while an additional low power amp drives the guitar speaker. In the isolation box approach, the guitar amplifier is used with a guitar speaker in a separate cabinet. A soundproofed isolation cabinet, isolation box, isolation booth, or isolation room can be used.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>dummy</b> <b>load</b> ordinarily {{should be}} a pure {{resistance}}; the amount of resistance {{should be the same}} as the impedance of the antenna or transmission line that is used with the transmitter (usually 50 Ω or 75 Ω).The radio energy that is absorbed by the <b>dummy</b> <b>load</b> is converted to heat. A <b>dummy</b> <b>load</b> must be chosen or designed to tolerate the amount of power that can be delivered by the transmitter. [...] Typically it consists of a resistor attached to some type of heat sink to dissipate the power from the transmitter.|$|E

50|$|A <b>dummy</b> <b>load</b> is {{a device}} used to {{simulate}} an electrical load, usually for testing purposes.

In audio systems a <b>dummy</b> <b>load</b> {{is connected to the}} output of an amplifier to electrically simulate a loudspeaker, allowing the amplifier to be tested without producing sound.

50|$|Power-valve {{distortion}} {{can also}} be produced in a dedicated rackmount valve power amp. A modular rackmount setup often involves a rackmount preamp, a rackmount valve power amp, and a rackmount <b>dummy</b> <b>load</b> to attenuate the output to desired volume levels. Some effects pedals internally produce power-valve distortion, including an optional <b>dummy</b> <b>load</b> {{for use as a}} power-valve distortion pedal. Such effects units can use a preamp valve such as the 12AX7 in a power-valve circuit configuration (as in the Stephenson's Stage Hog), or use a conventional power valve, such as the EL84 (as in the H&K Crunch Master compact tabletop unit). However, because these are usually placed before the pre-amplifier in the signal chain, they contribute to the overall tone in a different way. Power amplifier distortion may damage speakers.|$|E

Amongst those the developments of the cyclotron wave converter CWC appears most suitable. With the availability of powerful Schottky diodes the solid state converter aspect has to be addressed as well. One of the biggest problems of Schottky diode based structures is the junction capacity. GaAs and GaN Schottky diodes show a significant reduction of this junction capacity as compared to silicon. Small rectenna type converter units which have been already developed for microwave powered helicopters can be used in waveguides or with coaxial power dividers...|$|R
5000|$|... "Cranking an amp" [...] means {{turning up}} a guitar power {{amplifier}} {{well into the}} region at which power-tube distortion is produced, generating as much as twice the amplifier's rated non-distorting wattage. Pushing a guitar amp {{to such an extent}} can destroy components of an amplifier whether using an isolation cabinet, <b>dummy</b> <b>load,</b> power attenuator, or conventional guitar speaker cabinet. In particular, tubes wear more quickly when they are consistently pushed into saturation.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} {{purpose of these}} contacts was for switching in telephone exchanges, for which there were many patterns. Two sets of change-over contacts, isolated from the connector contacts, were common. The more recent pattern of one NC contact for each signal path, internally attached to the connector contact, stems from their use as headphone jacks. In many amplifiers and equipment containing them, such as electronic organs, a headphone jack is provided that disconnects the loudspeakers when in use. This is done by means of these switch contacts. In other equipment, a <b>dummy</b> <b>load</b> is provided when the headphones are not connected. This is also easily provided by means of these NC contacts.|$|E
2500|$|One {{problem now}} remained, {{the need for}} two antennas for {{broadcast}} and reception.

On 30 December 1940 Dee noted that no solution had been found along these lines and that in spite of best efforts the crystals still lasted only a few hours.
