They attempted {{to separate the}} more characteristic metals from substances <b>having</b> <b>those</b> characteristics to a lesser degree. Such substances included zinc, antimony, bismuth, stibnite, pyrite and galena. These were all then called semimetals or bastard metals.|$|E
25|$|One {{aspect of}} Sierra Leone that {{is alleged to}} have aided the disease, is the strong desire of many to have very {{involved}} funeral practices. For example, for the Kissi people who inhabit part of Sierra Leone, it is important to bury the bodies of the dead near them. Funeral practices include rubbing the corpses down with oil, dressing them in fine clothes, then <b>having</b> <b>those</b> at the funeral hug and kiss the dead body. This may aid the transmission of Ebola, because those that die from Ebola disease are thought to have high concentrations of the virus in their body, even after they have died.|$|E

25|$|No Man's Sky is {{primarily}} {{designed as a}} single-player game, though discoveries can be shared to all players via the Steam Workshop, and friends can track {{each other on the}} game's galactic map. Hello Games' Sean Murray stated that one might spend about forty hours of gametime to reach the centre of the galaxy if they did not perform any side activities, but he also fully anticipated that players would play the game in a manner that suits them, such as <b>having</b> <b>those</b> that might try to catalogue the flora and fauna in the universe, while others may attempt to set up trade routes between planets. Players can track friends on the galactic map and the system maps. Due to limited multiplayer aspects, Sony does not require PlayStation 4 users to have a PlayStation Plus subscription to play the game online.|$|E
25|$|To begin, affective {{emotions}} {{and the effect}} infidelity has on affective jealousy. Both {{men and women alike}} feel some kind of jealousy when they suspect their significant other is being unfaithful (Johnson, 2017). If some individual suspects {{that he or she is}} being cheated on they begin to question their partners actions and may possibly act in more frustrated ways towards them than they normally would. For example, they may ask more questions about the whereabouts of their partner or get upset more frequently and more often whenever they feel that their partner is lying or going out without them. Bursts of frustration without thinking it through or realizing why an individual is <b>having</b> <b>those</b> emotions can be an affective response in a difficult situation. The affective use of jealousy in a seemingly unfaithful relationship is caused by the accusing partner anticipating the infidelity from the other.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} feature of the Bourbon Reforms was that they ended the significant amount of local control that was a characteristic of the bureaucracy under the Habsburgs, especially through the sale of offices. The Bourbons sought {{a return to the}} monarchical ideal of <b>having</b> <b>those</b> not directly connected with local elites as administrators, who in theory should be disinterested, staff the higher echelons of regional government. In practice this meant that there was a concerted effort to appoint mostly peninsulares, usually military men with long records of service (as opposed to the Habsburg preference for prelates), who were willing to move around the global empire. The intendancies were one new office that could be staffed with peninsulares, but throughout the 18th century significant gains were made in the numbers of governors-captain generals, audiencia judges and bishops, in addition to other posts, who were Spanish-born.|$|E

25|$|Initially, only 15,000 of the {{authorized}} {{quantity of}} 25,000 were struck at the Philadelphia Mint, {{as this was}} the quantity the Tercentenary Commission at first ordered. These were struck not later than April 10, 1935, and were sent at the commission's request to the Hartford National Bank and Trust Company, distributing agent for the coin. Placed on sale on April 21, they were rapidly exhausted, and on April 25, Fisher ordered the remaining 10,000. The commission had enquired as {{to the possibility of}} having the coins struck at different mints and in proof condition, but was told that the heavy volume of work at the Mint forbade <b>having</b> <b>those</b> done. The price per coin was $1. In addition to the coins sent to Hartford, the Mint struck 18 pieces, reserved for inspection and testing at the 1936 meeting of the annual Assay Commission. The United States Post Office Department issued a three-cent stamp for the anniversary on April 26, 1935, also depicting the Charter Oak.|$|E

Kerslake prepared five treatments during July and August 1993, but no shoot arrangements were made {{and by the end}} of the month, the group decided to work with Dutch photographer and video director Anton Corbijn. Corbijn, who typically created his own ideas for videos, was initially unsure of directing the video since Cobain's treatment was so detailed. Corbijn said, [...] "But then I looked at it and I thought that actually it was pretty good.

500|$|When {{developing}} {{the characteristics of}} their version of Lois Lane, the writers took inspiration from other leading ladies in cinema, for example, Karen Allen's character Marion Ravenwood, from Raiders of the Lost Ark. Todd Slavkin describes the character as having a [...] "sophisticated, worldly experience", and {{was considered to be}} more of an adult {{than the rest of the}} cast. Durance believes that she embodies many of the characteristics that the creative team wanted to show in their version of Lois, specifically the fact that Lois has a lot of [...] "nervous energy" [...] from trying to [...] "find herself", the same nervous energy that Durance brings to the role. The actress also relates to Lois's sassy, and independent nature, but, conversely, she is not as extroverted as Lois. Gough describes the character as coming from the school of hard knocks; she is street smart, and a very capable woman. Durance believes her character is [...] "fiercely independent", but at the same time she is not afraid to admit that she has flaws, and she is only human; Lois also does not feel sorry about <b>having</b> <b>those</b> flaws. She goes into further detail, identifying the character as more of a tomboy who is vulnerable, with Gough adding that she is also [...] "slightly neurotic". BuddyTV's John Kubicek characterizes her as a fast-talking woman, who, though she whines over petty annoyances, can take care of herself. He goes on to further describe how she is not afraid of getting herself into trouble just so she can dig herself out.|$|E

Similarly, Robert Nozick argues for a theory that is mostly consequentialist, but incorporates inviolable [...] "side-constraints" [...] which restrict the sort of actions agents are permitted to do.|$|E

2500|$|Torsion is {{particularly}} {{useful in the}} study of the geometry of geodesics. Given a system of parametrized geodesics, one can specify a class of affine connections <b>having</b> <b>those</b> geodesics, but differing by their torsions. There is a unique connection which absorbs the torsion, generalizing the Levi-Civita connection to other, possibly non-metric situations (such as Finsler geometry). The difference between a connection with torsion, and a corresponding connection without torsion is a tensor, called the contorsion tensor. Absorption of torsion also plays a fundamental role {{in the study of}} [...] G-structures and Cartan's equivalence method. Torsion is also useful in the study of unparametrized families of geodesics, via the associated projective connection. In relativity theory, such ideas have been implemented in the form of Einstein–Cartan theory.|$|E
2500|$|The Rambler American {{line for}} 1965 {{switched}} to AMC's new one-barrel [...] The new [...] version became available at midyear. The 232 engine series was already being produced in Mexico while the 195.6 engine series was {{imported from the}} US. In terms of product line volumes, warrantly claims among others, <b>having</b> <b>those</b> two engines available was not a cost-effective procedure. The company intended to consolidate and standardize production as much as possible, which was achieved by terminating the 195.6 engines and offer both the Rambler Classic and Rambler American lines with the 232 engines until the 199 was available for the latter. Aside from the engine, the VAM Rambler American saw the same aesthetic features of its AMC counterpart, such as a partially redesigned grille design with four vertical lines and new tail lights with a flat internal side and a curved external one.|$|E

Walmart later leaked that multiple characters including the Guardians of the Galaxy would be playable in the game. Walmart did so by listing multiple characters, Playset packs and Starter Packs on their website. Another image was leaked, showcasing Star-Lord and Gamora figures.

[...] According to Cui Zhaowei's biography in the Old Book of Tang, his grandfather Cui Bi (崔庇) served as a county sheriff, while his father Cui Yan (崔巘) served as the governor of Eyue Circuit (鄂岳, headquartered in modern Wuhan, Hubei), but the table of the chancellors' family trees in the New Book of Tang do not describe Cui Bi and Cui Yan as <b>having</b> <b>those</b> offices, and Cui Zhaowei's biography in the New Book of Tang omitted references to them altogether.

2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of her career, Blackwell played mostly soubrette roles and has since moved more into the lyric coloratura soprano repertoire. Blackwell has commented that she felt opera houses were initially uncertain as to how to cast her because of her musical theater background. She said, [...] "They saw me in the lighter repertoire and my voice teacher and I saw me in the lyric repertoire." [...] In addition, her small frame and 5'1" [...] stature in combination with girlish looks made her a perfect physical casting choice for soubrette roles. It wasn't until Blackwell studied in Busseto with Carlo Bergonzi, Renata Tebaldi, and Sylvia Barrachi in the late 1980s that she finally was given direction into the lyric coloratura repertoire. Blackwell recalls, [...] "At {{the end of the program}} Mrs. Barrachi and Renata Tebaldi sat down with me and told me what roles I should sing if I wanted to have a major career. <b>Having</b> <b>those</b> two women take the time to talk to me made a big difference.
