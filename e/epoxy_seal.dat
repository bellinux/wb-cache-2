50|$|Certain {{epoxy resins}} and their {{processes}} {{can create a}} hermetic bond to copper, brass, or epoxy itself with similar coefficients of thermal expansion and {{are used in the}} manufacture of hermetic electrical and fiber optic hermetic <b>seals.</b> <b>Epoxy</b> hermetic <b>seal</b> designs can be used in hermetic seal applications for low or high vacuum or pressures, effectively sealing gases or fluids including helium gas to very low Helium gas leak rates similar to glass or ceramic. Hermetic <b>epoxy</b> <b>seals</b> also offer the design flexibility of sealing either copper alloy wires or pins, instead of the much less electrically conductive Kovar pin materials required in glass or ceramic hermetic seals.Epoxy hermetic seal has a more limited operating temperature range compared to glass or ceramic seals with an operating range of typically -70C to +125C or 150C, though some hermetic epoxy designs are capable of 200C.|$|R

40|$|UHPC are {{developed}} in present paper incorporating an innovative self-healing {{system based on}} two micro/nano-additions: silica microcapsules containing <b>epoxy</b> <b>sealing</b> compound (CAP) and amine functionalised silica nanoparticles. Although CAP are well integrated within the cementitious matrix, their inclusion promotes {{a reduction in the}} mechanical performance so CAP could act as weak points. However, the inclusion of these additions refines pore distribution thus increasing the expected durability in aggressive media. An effective autonomous self-healing capacity is assessed/confirmed which is unexpectedly higher in the concretes with the lower healing additions content studied. This capacity depends on the crack width and the healing period considered.

40|$|A {{technology}} {{was developed for}} the fabrication of very thin, chip-sized lithium secondary micro batteries. Based on wafer level processing the batteries can be directly implemented into silicon chips, 3 D chip stacks or MEMS devices. The batteries were packaged in 200 mu m deep cavities of the silicon wafer and encapsulated with a glass substrate. Battery demonstrators with 7 and 12 mm(2) and round foot print were realized. Near hermetic packaging was accomplished using a UV curable <b>epoxy</b> <b>sealing</b> which should ensure several years of battery lifetime. Bonding parameters, shear force and water permeation rate of the adhesive were investigated. A capacity of 3 mAh/cm(2) and an energy density of 10 mWh/cm(2) have been achieved. The electrical contact between the battery and the contact pads of the housing was investigated in detail. Electrical tests were made with encapsulated micro batteries and compared with macroscopic lithium polymer batteries. A capacity reduction of approximately 10 % was measured after 100 cycles...|$|R
40|$|The arc thermal metal {{spraying}} method (ATMSM) provides proven long-term protective coating systems using zinc, aluminum and their alloys for steel {{work in a}} marine environment. This paper focuses on studying experimentally the anti-corrosion criteria of ATMSM on steel specimens. The effects {{of the types of}} spraying metal and {{the presence or absence of}} sealing treatment from the thermal spraying of film on the anti-corrosion performance of TMSM were quantitatively evaluated by electrochemical techniques. The results showed that ATMSM represented a sufficient corrosion resistance with the driving force based on the potential difference of more than approximately 0. 60 V between the thermal spraying layer and the base substrate steel. Furthermore, it was found that the sealing treatment of specimens had suppressed the dissolution of metals, increased the corrosion potential, decreased the corrosion current density and increased the polarization resistance. Metal alloy Al–Mg (95 %: 5 %) by mass with <b>epoxy</b> <b>sealing</b> coating led to the most successful anti-corrosion performance in these electrochemical experiments...|$|R

This provides the bene�t of having a high degree of control over the system parameters and allowing direct detection methods. Disordered transport is one example of where such a system has much to o�er. This thesis concerns the development of a Bose-Fermi mixture experiment for study of two-dimensional optical lattice systems. To achieve single site resolution of the lattice, the experiment makes use of a double microscope set-up. One microscope provides imaging and the second is used to image a spatial light modulator onto the atomic plane. This provides an extremely versatile potential landscape for a trapped cloud. This thesis presents an overview of the set-up of the experiment including progress towards condensation. Particular focus is given to the design and characterisation of the vacuum system and the combined double microscope and spatial light modulator system. The vacuum system design requires a narrow magneto-optical trapping chamber. A novel <b>epoxy</b> <b>sealing</b> technique has been developed, allowing construction of a chamber of just 36 mm thickness whilst maintaining high optical access. To provide illumination for the spatial light modulator a technique for homogenising the output of multi-mode �bre has been developed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

Such methods included [...] "concrete decks; concretepile and abutment overlays; removal of decayed timber and replacement with structural <b>epoxy</b> filler; <b>sealing</b> endgrain decking and tops of wingwall piles; diffusible fungicides; clearance of undergrowth to decrease surrounding humidity; skilled inspections, {{and treatment of}} metal components".Concrete decks {{were added to the}} upstream and downstream bridges in 1972 and 1980 respectively, to minimise rot, control termites, and distribute loads on the bridge more evenly. Steel girders were also retrofitted, replacing wooden half-caps. Karri used for half-caps was particularly prone to termite attack; while the outside had been treated with sodium fluoride and arsenic trioxide, the inside was susceptible to being hollowed out, and was the cause of a partial collapse of the upstream bridge in 1987.|$|R
30|$|In {{the first}} paper, Queiroz et al. study the creep {{behavior}} of single-lap joints (SLJ). They developed a pneumatic creep equipment capable of testing ten specimens simultaneously. Results {{show that the}} average tensile strength {{is not enough to}} guarantee project safety, for long term applications. An initial model for the creep behavior of bonded joints was also proposed. In the next paper, Sales et al. investigated the effect of periodontal disease on the bond strength of fiberglass posts. Push-out tests were performed in specimens prepared with different adhesive systems and resin cements. It was possible to conclude that periodontal disease did not affected the bond strength mean values of fiberglass posts cementation. In the third paper, Silva Neto et al. present a numerical and experimental investigation on the adhesion between the steel tube and cement paste in petroleum wells. Push-out tests were performed with three different interface conditions in order to validate the numerical model. They observed the influence of the different conditions used in the experiments and the sensibility of the model variables to these changes. Antunes et al. worked on the characterization of FeCr and FeCoCr alloy coatings of carbon steels for marine environment applications. The adhesive strength of alloy coatings using thermal spray process was studied and related to chemical composition. Five combinations of wires and intermediate bonds were used. The coatings were characterized by morphological aspects, corrosion and adhesion tests. They concluded that the FeCoCr deposition, with an <b>epoxy</b> <b>sealing,</b> is suitable to be used as an efficient coating of carbon steel in aggressive marine environments. The last paper by Souza and Reis is related to the thermal behavior of DGEBA (Diglycidyl Ether of Bisphenol A) adhesives. Three different epoxy adhesives used in the offshore industry are characterized by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA). The work shows that singe lap joins tests at different service temperatures cannot be neglected when epoxy adhesives are intended to be used in field applications.|$|R
5000|$|Linseed oil is a {{traditional}} finish for gun stocks, though very fine finish may require months to obtain. Several coats of linseed oil is the traditional protective coating for the raw willow wood of cricket bats; it is used so that the wood retains some moisture. New cricket bats are coated with linseed oil and knocked-in to perfection so they last longer. [...] Linseed oil is also often used by billiards or pool cue-makers for cue shafts, as a lubricant/protectant for wooden recorders, and used in place of <b>epoxy</b> to <b>seal</b> modern wooden surfboards.Additionally, a luthier may use linseed oil when reconditioning a guitar, mandolin, or other stringed instrument's fret board; lemon-scented mineral oil is commonly used for cleaning, then a light amount of linseed oil (or other drying oil) is applied {{to protect it from}} grime that might otherwise result in accelerated deterioration of the wood.|$|R
30|$|Potentiometric {{transducers}} {{based on}} pH-sensitive field-effect transistors were produced at the JSC “Kwazar” facilities (Kiev, Ukraine). Each transducer contained a differential pair of two identical p-channel field-effect transistors {{placed on a}} single crystal with the total area of 8  mm[*]×[*] 8  mm. N-type (100) silicon wafer {{was used as a}} substrate. The gate of dielectric layer was formed from thermally oxidized SiO 2 film 50  nm thick and Si 3 N 4 film of the same thickness deposited in the low-pressure reactor. The gate area had zigzag-shaped geometry with the length to width ratio of 100, which provided sufficient gain factor of p-channel transistors. The p-type conducting busses covered with a dielectric layer were used to form the electric contact to the transistor drain and source areas. The crystal with FETs was mounted on the specifically designed printed-circuit boards (5  cm[*]×[*] 0.8  cm) for convenient connection. There were two pH-FETs on each chip, which allows measurements in differential mode to avoid an influence of the non-specific changes in output signal associated with the fluctuations in temperature, environmental pH, and electrical noise. The contact from the chip to the board copper layer was made by ultrasonic welding with an <b>epoxy</b> glue <b>sealing.</b> The signals from both transistors were recorded, and then, the signal from the reference transistor (covered with the “blank” membrane) was subtracted from the signal of the transistor covered with the enzymatic membrane (biorecognition element). The transistors demonstrated pH-sensitivity of approximately 40  mV/pH and transconductance of 400 – 500  μA/V, thus providing pH-sensitivity of the transistor channel current of 15 – 20  μA/pH.|$|R
40|$|AbstractConcrete and {{reinforcement}} {{used for}} making of reinforced concrete foundations, can {{be exposed to}} different aggressive impacts of the environment. As a consequence, reinforced concrete material deteriorates in time. There is a number of methods, i. e. ways to prevent the damage of reinforced concrete foundations. In the paper are mentioned some of the methods such as: proper selection of foundation depth, construction of the gravel layer below the foundations, construction of the proper drainage and construction of adequate moist and water insulation, proper placing and curing of concrete. In additions, during design of concrete mixes, one must {{take into consideration the}} degree of exposure of concrete to the external impacts. In the design of the concrete mix, various admixtures are used, providing appropriate water-tightness of concrete and frost resistance. Also various coating chemical can be used as the additional protection of the concrete surface, such as: hydrophobic silicon impregnation chemical, <b>epoxy</b> resins, bitumen <b>sealing</b> strips or self-adhesive strips, bitumen emulsions, synthetic foils (membranes), hydro-insulation cement masses, bentonite barriers, studded foils (membranes) HDPE, bathtub –like structures [...] .

40|$|Objectives The aim of {{the present}} study was to compare the sealing {{efficacy}} of root fillings made by a single-cone technique with three different sealers and a cold lateral compaction technique with an epoxy sealer. Materials and methods Eighty extracted single-rooted human teeth were assigned to four experimental groups: group 1, single-cone and epoxy sealer; group 2, single-cone and calcium silicate-based sealer; group 3, single-cone and methacrylate resin-based sealer; and group 4, cold lateral compaction and epoxy sealer. Twenty extra teeth served as negative and positive controls. After preparation of a coronal post space, the sealing efficacy of the root fillings was assessed on a fluid transport setup. The results were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U test. Results No fluid transport was detected for the negative controls whereas all the positive controls showed rapid fluid transport. No significant difference was detected between groups 1, 3, and 4 whereas group 2 demonstrated significantly more fluid transport than all the other experimental groups. Conclusions Root fillings made by a single-cone technique with the epoxy or methacrylate-based sealers were as effective after post space preparation as those made by a cold lateral technique with the <b>epoxy</b> sealer in <b>sealing</b> the root canal. Clinical Relevance Specific root canal sealers in combination with single-cone technique represent a noteworthy alternative to the use of cold lateral compaction technique when a post space is required.

40|$|This project {{addressed}} the key technical issues {{for development of}} an efficient smart window based on reversible electrochemical transfer of silver between a mirror electrode and a localized counter electrode. Effort to provide uniform switching over large areas focused on use of a resistive transparent electrode innerlayer to increase the interelectrode resistance. An effective edge seal was developed in collaboration with adhesive suppliers and an electrochromic device manufacturer. Work to provide a manufacturable counter electrode focused on fabricating a dot matrix electrode without photolithography by electrodeposition of Pt nuclei on inherent active sites on a transparent oxide conductor. An alternative counter electrode based on a conducting polymer and an ionic liquid electrolyte was also investigated. Work {{in all of these}} areas was successful. Sputtered large-bandgap oxide innerlayers sandwiched between conductive indium tin oxide (ITO) layers were shown to provide sufficient cross-layer resistance (> 300 ohm/cm{sup 2 }) without significantly affecting the electrochemical properties of the ITO overlayer. Two edge <b>seal</b> <b>epoxies,</b> one procured from an epoxy manufacturer and one provided by an electrochromic device manufacturer in finished seals, were shown to be effective barriers against oxygen intrusion up to 80 C. The optimum density of nuclei for the dot matrix counter electrode was attained without use of photolithography by electrodeposition from a commercial alkaline platinum plating bath. Silver loss issues for cells with dot matrix electrodes were successfully addressed by purifying the electrolyte and adjusting the cell cycling parameters. More than 30 K cycles were demonstrated for a REM cell (30 -cm square) with a dot matrix counter electrode. Larger cells (30 -cm square) were successfully fabricated but could not be cycled since the nucleation layers (provided by an outside supplier) were defective so that mirror deposits could not be produced...|$|R
40|$|The work {{reported}} in this thesis {{was part of the}} larger EPSRC (Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council) and dstl (Defence Science and Technology Laboratory) funded project called CRASHCOMPS with the main aim to establish approaches for crack arrest and self healing in composites. The aim of this subproject was to produce macroporous polymer beads with either open pore or closed-cell structures, which can be utilised as delivery vehicles for crush-release of self-healing agents but which could ultimately also be used for crush-release of other active ingredients, such as dyes, drugs, enzyme, acids etc. The work {{reported in}} this thesis describes the synthesis and characterisation of novel micrometre sized macroporous polymer beads which can be easily handled and dispersed in liquids, gels, epoxy resins and particle blends and are therefore potentially useful for a large variety of applications. Throughout this thesis, macroporous poly(methyl methacrylate-co-ethylene glycol dimethacrylate) beads were synthesised via double emulsion templating in combination with suspension and microfluidic polymerisation techniques as it allowed the synthesis of macroporous polymer beads with predefined pore structures and bead sizes, respectively. By using different internal phase volume ratios and surfactants of different concentration for stabilisation of the primary emulsions, macroporous polymer beads with different open pore morphologies and mechanical properties could be synthesised. Furthermore by using particles as emulsifiers for the primary emulsion templates, macroporous beads with closed-cell structures and significant improvement in the mechanical properties of resulting beads could be realised, which are important for crush-release applications. This work {{led to the formation of}} novel high internal phase emulsions (HIPEs), which use active ingredients, such as hydrochloric acid or guar gum degrading enzymes, as internal emulsion phase and which allowed to produce in situ filled macroporous polymer beads. These beads then allowed the release of the active ingredients upon crushing. Subsequently, the ambitious aim to use macroporous beads as carriers for self-healing agents was approached and synthesised macroporous beads were post filled with <b>epoxy</b> resin and <b>sealed</b> afterwards. In addition, macroporous beads filled with epoxy resin were incorporated into composite matrices and their effect on the overall mechanical properties as well as the amount of unreacted resin available for self-healing approaches after curing of the composite investigated and determined, respectively. Eventually novel hydrophilic macroporous polymer monoliths based on [2 -(acryloyloxy) ethyl] trimethylammonium chloride and 2 -(methacryloyloxy) ethyl trimethylammonium chloride with N,N′-methylenebis(acrylamide) as crosslinker were produced and characterised for potential in situ encapsulation with epoxy resin.
