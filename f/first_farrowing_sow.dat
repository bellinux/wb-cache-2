For this purpose, 466 observations regarding the age at <b>first</b> <b>farrowing</b> were made for Dalland-C 40 (c) animals belonging to two herds. The effects of the environmental factors on this trait were assessed {{by means of a}} model that included, as random effects, the influence of the sow's father and mother and, as fixed effects, the influence the year of birth, the herd and the birth season, along with the covariable litter size at birth. The variance components were estimated using the derivative-free restricted maximum likelihood method. The estimated mean was 354. 8 +/- 25. 87 days, with a coefficient of variation of 7. 29 %. Significant effects on the trait were observed for the herd, the year and the season of birth; but a linear effect of litter size at birth on the age at <b>first</b> <b>farrowing</b> was not observed. The boar did not significantly contribute to the variation occurring among the sows, whereas the sow's mother caused significant variation. The heritability estimate for the age at <b>first</b> <b>farrowing</b> was 0. 44 +/- 0. 15, which is considered high.

Work goal: the {{analysis}} of change of an index of reproductive characteristics of a sow depending on age. For achievement of this goal, raise the following objektives: 1) to estimate change of reproductive characteristics of investigated sows from the first to the last farrows; 2) to calculate indexes (R) reproductive characteristics for each sow, separately on everyone farrow; 3) to estimate index change (R) reproductive characteristics at number increase farrow. The work has been executed in 2008 in the enterprise of pigs of the Kaunas area. It was made 14 groups of sows of breed landrace. Test sows were from <b>first</b> to seventh <b>farrows.</b> The analysis of a reproduction and calculations of an index of a reproduction are executed on everyone farrow (from 1 to 7). For an estimation of efficiency and a reproduction index were analyzed the following indicators: 1. Fertility of sows, in units; 2. Quantity of piglets 21 days old, in units; 3. Weight of nest of piglets 21 days old, in kilo; 4. Quantity of piglets at weaning, in units; 5. Weight of nest of piglets at weaning, in kilo. The analysis of the sow's fertility changes, depending on the quantity of farrows, found that the fertility increased from the <b>first</b> <b>farrow.</b> The lowest fertility was at first pigs sow – 9. 93 piglets, the highest fertility was found during the fourth farrow – 10. 63 units or 0. 70 piglets more that the <b>first</b> <b>farrow.</b> From the fourth farrow was found the tendency of reduction of fertility, i. e. fertility of the fifth farrow was 0. 06 units, sixth – 0. 13 units and seventh – 0. 30 inits lower than the fourth farrow. Quantity of piglets 21 days old and at weaning, the fourth farrows were also the largest - accordingly on 9. 25 piglets. These indicators {{had a tendency to}} increase from the <b>first</b> <b>farrow,</b> and from the fourth - to decrease. Worst results were during at the seventh farrows time, i. e. quantity of piglets 21 days old and at weaning was on 7. 33 piglets, or 1. 92 piglets less that the fourth farrow. The analysis of the sow's milkiness (weight of nest of piglets 21 days old) changes, depending on farrows, found that more milkiness was a first pig sows – 54. 71 kilo. By the third <b>farrow,</b> <b>sow</b> milkiness was similar level, while the fourth farrows found a marked reduction tendency. The lowest milkiness was the seventh <b>farrow</b> <b>sows</b> – 39. 33 kilo, or 14. 21 kilo (p< 0, 05) less that the third farrow and 15. 38 kilo (p< 0, 05) less that the first. The largest weight of weaning nest was found of the third <b>farrow</b> <b>sows</b> – 82. 00 kilo, or 4. 14 kilo more that the first pig sow. From the third farrow the weight of weaning nest also had a tendency to reduction. The lowest weight of weaning nest was found of the seventh <b>farrow</b> <b>sows</b> – 66. 33 kilo or 15. 67 kilo less that the third farrow. On the basis of the average data of each farrow, it was calculated the index (R) of reproductive characteristics. From the first to the fourth farrow (except the second) the reproduction index increased. The index of reproduction of the fourth farrow was the highest 36. 99, or 1. 36 units more that the <b>first</b> <b>farrow.</b> From the fourth farrow the reproduction index decreased. By the seventh farrow, it was lowest – 31. 17, or 5. 82 units less that the fourth farrow and 4. 46 units less that the <b>first</b> <b>farrow.</b> On the basis on the received results it is possible to do following conclusions: 1. Fertility of sows of the fourth farrow, quantity of piglets 21 days old and at weaning was the highest: accordingly 0. 70; 0. 39 and 0. 46 piglets more that the <b>first</b> <b>farrow.</b> 2. The largest weight of weaning nest was found of the third <b>farrow</b> <b>sows</b> – 82. 00 kilo, or 4. 14 kilo more that the first pig sow. 3. Value of an index of reproductive in regular intervals reflected changes of indicators of each farrow: more the best signs of value having farrows have been estimated by the best index of a reproduction – 36. 99 of the fourth <b>farrow</b> <b>sows.</b> 4. The index of reproductive, as the main of reproductive characteristics rates, increased until the fourth farrow, and then began to steady decreased. Also it is possible to present such offers: 1.

40|$|AbstractThe {{length of}} {{productive}} life (LPL) and lifetime production traits are economically important in commercial swine production systems. This study investigated {{factors that may}} influence the LPL and lifetime production traits of sows in a commercial swine population in Thailand. The dataset consisted of information from 2768 sows that had their <b>first</b> <b>farrowing</b> from 1989 to 2012. Three breed groups of sows were represented: 122 Duroc, 1944 Landrace and 702 Yorkshire. The traits analyzed were the LPL, lifetime piglets born alive (LBA), lifetime piglets weaned (LPW), lifetime piglets birth weight (LBW) and lifetime piglets weaning weight (LWW). The model consisted of year-season of <b>first</b> <b>farrowing,</b> breed group and age at <b>first</b> <b>farrowing</b> as fixed effects and the residual as a random effect. Year-season of <b>first</b> <b>farrowing</b> was {{an important source of}} variation for all traits (p <  0. 0001). Yorkshire sows had the longest LPL (p <  0. 05) and the highest LPW (p <  0. 05) of all sow breed groups, whereas Duroc sows had the lowest least squares means for all traits. Landrace and Yorkshire sows had similar LBA, LBW and LWW. Thus, Yorkshire sows had the highest production efficiency (the longest LPL and highest LPW) of the three breed groups in this population. Age at <b>first</b> <b>farrowing</b> was negatively associated with LPL, LBA, LPW, LBW and LWW.

40|$|Sixty hybrid Yorkshire-Landrace penned sows, 30 with eutocic {{farrowing}} and 30 {{experiencing a}} dystocic parturition, were studied {{to evaluate the}} obstetric and neonatal outcomes to low doses of oxytocin administered at advanced stages of parturition. Animals in each group were randomly subdivided into 2 subgroups: 15 eutocic and 15 dystocic sows received oxytocin 0. 083 IU/kg (equivalent to 1 IU/ 12 kg body weight), administered intramuscularly after the delivery of the 5 th piglet; the other 15 eutocic and 15 dystocic sows received saline solution intramuscularly at the same time. Oxytocin decreased the number of intrapartum deaths by approximately 50 % (P = 0. 002). No piglet was born dead from the saline- and oxytocin-treated eutocic sows. The highest viability score was observed among piglets born to eutocic sows treated with oxytocin.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of this experimental study were to investigate if a strategic method to supply loose housed sows with {{large quantities of}} straw 2 days before expected farrowing and if the sow’s body condition had any effect on the occurrence of shoulder lesions 5 weeks after farrowing. Data came from a study conducted on four commercial piglet-producing farms in southwest Sweden between March and December 2009. At each farm one batch of sows was followed during two consecutive lactations. The sows {{were randomly assigned to}} two different treatment groups and the sows that remained in the batch during the second lactation switched treatment group. In the treatment group (n= 163 farrowings) sows were provided with 15 – 20 kg of chopped straw 2 days before expected <b>farrowing.</b> <b>Sows</b> in the control group (n= 161 farrowings) received 0. 5 – 1 kg of chopped straw on a daily basis plus 2 kg for nest building when the stockperson judged that the sow was about to <b>farrow.</b> After the <b>sows</b> was moved to farrowing pens (0 - 9 days before actual farrowing), body condition was measured with ultrasound equipment and a back-fat thickness of ≤ 12 mm was denoted “low body condition” (n= 41 farrowings) while higher values were denoted “high body condition” (n= 283 farrowings). Shoulder lesions were recorded on a 5 -point scale (score 0 - 4) after the sows was moved to farrowing pens and approximately 5 weeks after farrowing. Data were analysed using z-tests for proportions. The provision of 15 – 20 kg of straw 2 days prior to expected farrowing could not be shown to affect the prevalence of shoulder lesions. On the other hand, the sows’ body condition before farrowing had a strong effect on the development of shoulder lesions. The percentage of shoulder lesions after farrowings with a low and high body condition score was 71 and 39 percent, respectively (z= 4. 20, p< 0. 001). In sows with a low condition score, the difference in the prevalence of shoulder lesions of scores 3 - 4 between treatment and control groups (15 and 33 percent, respectively) indicates that large quantities of straw can reduce the risk of severe shoulder lesions in lean sows. In conclusion, piglet producers should keep their <b>farrowing</b> <b>sows</b> in good body condition to prevent shoulder lesions. Strategic supply of large quantities of straw before farrowing can be effective in reducing the risk of severe lesions, but further research is needed...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project was to modify an outdoor farrowing hut for winter and summer farrowing indoors to meet niche pork market requirements. Typical modified A-frame plywood outdoor farrowing huts were used to <b>farrow</b> <b>sows</b> indoors in summer and winter. The farrowing occurred in an insulated lean-to shed of a larger machine shed. During summer, the huts were fitted with a common 20 -inch box fan positioned in the hut roof blowing down on the sow (Figures 2 and 3). This helped keep air moving over the sow during hot weather. At night when the temperature dropped, a thermostat in the fan would switch the fan off. A hover was built for the back of each hut and fitted with two heat lamps (Figure 4). This attachment provided a warm draft-free area for the piglets away from the sow. Also, the heat lamps were inaccessible to the sow to minimize risk of fire. These simple modifications helped keep the sows comfortable and piglets warm in a bedded alternative farrowing arrangement...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 152 pig farms were {{randomly}} selected from the five provinces in South Korea. During the experiment, the average temperature and relative humidity was 24. 7 °C and 74 % in summer and 2. 4 °C and 53 % in winter, respectively. The correlation between floor space allowance (FSA) and productivity index was analyzed, including non-productive sow days (NPD), number of weaners (NOW), survival rate (SR), appearance rate of A-grade pork (ARA), and days at a slaughter weight of 110 kg (d-SW) at different growth stages. The objectives of the present study were i) to determine the effect of FSA on the pig productivity index and ii) to suggest the minimum FSA for pigs based on scientific baseline data. For the pregnant sow, NPD could be decreased if pregnant sows were raised with a medium level (M) of FSA (3. 10 to 3. 67 m 2 /head) while also keeping the pig house clean which improves hygiene, and operating the ventilation system properly. For the <b>farrowing</b> <b>sows,</b> the NOW tended to decrease as the FSA increased. Similarly, a high level of FSA (H) is significantly negative with weaner SR of <b>farrowing</b> <b>sows</b> (p-value = 0. 017), indicating this FSA tends to depress SR. Therefore, a FSA of 2. 30 to 6. 40 m 2 /head (very low) could be appropriate for weaners because a limited space can provide a sense of security and protection from external interruptions. The opposite trend was observed that an increase in floor space (> 1. 12 m 2 /head) leads to increase the SR of growing pigs. For the fattening pigs, H level of FSA was negatively correlated with SR, but M level of FSA was positively correlated with SR, indicating that SR tended to increase with the FSA of 1. 10 to 1. 27 m 2 /head. In contrast, ARA of male fattening pigs showed opposite results. H level of FSA (1. 27 to 1. 47 m 2 /head) was suggested to increase productivity because ARA was most affected by H level of space allowance with positive correlation (R 2 = 0. 523). The relationship between the FSA and d-SW of fattening pigs was hard to identify because of the low R 2 value. However, the farms that provided a relatively large floor space (1. 27 to 1. 54 m 2 /head) during the winter period showed d-SW was significantly and negatively affected by FSA...|$|R

By rescaling the time axis from continuous to several discrete classes, grouped survival data (discrete survival time) models can be used instead. Methods: The productive life length of 12319 Large White and 9833 Landrace sows was analyzed with continuous scale and grouped data models. Random effect of herd*year, fixed effects of interaction between parity and relative number of piglets, age at <b>first</b> <b>farrowing</b> and annual herd size change were included in the analysis. The genetic component was estimated from sire, sire-maternal grandsire, sire-dam, sire-maternal grandsire and animal models, and the heritabilities computed for each model type in both breeds. Results: If age at <b>first</b> <b>farrowing</b> was under 43 weeks or above 60 weeks, the risk of culling sows increased.

40|$|Weaning age is an {{extremely}} important management decision in commercial pork production. The decision is based upon many factors which include sow performance, herd health, pig performance and costs and revenues associated with these factors such as lactation space utilization, and weaned pig value. The industry shifted to weaning litters at earlier ages {{in order to improve}} piglet health throughout the nursery and grow finish phases of production. In order to avoid transmission of pathogens from sow to piglet, the Segregated Early Weaning (SEW) concept was developed. This process consists of <b>farrowing</b> <b>sows</b> on the same site {{as the rest of the}} breeding herd, weaning piglets from 10 to 21 days and decreasing the amount of medication that is administered (Harris, 2000). Applying these management practices impacts subsequent piglet growth performance. Limited research has been conducted to determine the weaning age that results in optimum performance of the pig in its early stages of development and still provides protection to a variety of pathogens. The objective of this study was to quantify the effects of two weaning ages on nursery pig performance in a commercial production system...|$|R
