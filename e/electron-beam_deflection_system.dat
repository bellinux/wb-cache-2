40|$|Several <b>deflection</b> <b>systems</b> for Earth-crossing asteroids and comets (ECO -Earth-crossing objects) are {{analysed}} here. The orbit deflection of ECOs {{is necessary}} to prevent a collision between these bodies and the Earth, which could be catastrophic for Earth's biosphere. Deflecting small ECOs is not a serious problem when there is sufficient time before the collision; however, deflecting big ECOs, larger than some kilometers, and long-period comets is very difficult. The <b>deflection</b> <b>systems</b> are described by mass models. Then they are analysed {{with respect to their}} cost-effectiveness and are compared with one another.

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{considers the}} design methodologies {{associated with the}} development and optimization of a magnetic <b>deflection</b> <b>system</b> for Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) Display Systems. The development of a magnetic <b>deflection</b> <b>system</b> and the calculations necessary to determine the associated performance are both complex tasks. Their complexity arises from the detailed geometry involved in deflection unit designs, {{the wide range of}} product types and sizes, and variability in product performance specifications. The large variations of these issues compound the difficulty in realising an acceptable product design. Software simulation techniques which are able to accurately manipulate data and perform iterative calculations greatly aid this process. This work introduces a simulation technique used within the Philips organisation, called DUCAD (Deflection Unit Computer Aided Design), which is used to analytically and numerically model the <b>deflection</b> <b>system,</b> with the objective of assessing and speedily realising a design. The simulation technique allows magnetic deflection product designs to be synthesized by simulating the magnetic field generated by the <b>deflection</b> <b>system.</b> Approximate solutions can be iteratively investigated leading to a greater understanding of the problem domain. To gain a degree of confidence with the simulation results the software design proposal is thereafter replicated in hardware allowing a full validation of the DUCAD. Extensive simulation studies and practical prototyping experiments are presented to support the theoretical development. Comparing the calculated theoretical performance and the actual measured values, conclusions are drawn as {{to the quality of the}} simulation tool in deriving the intrinsic magnetic deflection characteristics of the generated product design.

50|$|The game is {{considered}} highly addictive {{due to its}} difficulty level, the complete control over ball direction, power and elevation (using a Diamond <b>Deflection</b> <b>System),</b> {{and the importance of}} tactics and player positioning over the field (barging if necessary), which makes it challenging to break strong defences.

50|$|Between the {{electron}} gun {{and the screen}} are two opposed pairs of metal plates called the deflection plates. The vertical amplifier generates a potential difference across one pair of plates, giving rise to a vertical electric field through which {{the electron}} beam passes. When the plate potentials are the same, the beam is not deflected. When the top plate is positive {{with respect to the}} bottom plate, the beam is deflected upwards; when the field is reversed, the beam is deflected downwards. The horizontal amplifier does a similar job with the other pair of deflection plates, causing the beam to move left or right. This <b>deflection</b> <b>system</b> is called electrostatic deflection, and is different from the electromagnetic <b>deflection</b> <b>system</b> used in television tubes. In comparison to magnetic deflection, electrostatic deflection can more readily follow random and fast changes in potential, but is limited to small deflection angles.|$|R

30|$|The {{intrinsic}} field-of-view of IMA is 4.5 ° × 360 ° in {{the spacecraft}} X–Z plane, divided into 16 azimuthal sectors of 22.5 ° (see Barabash and the ASPERA- 3 team, 2006) their figure 37 or Nilsson et al. (2006 a) their figure 1 for a schematic {{description of the}} IMA field-of-view {{as well as a}} definition of the spacecraft coordinate system). Mars Express is a three-axis stabilized instrument platform. In order to obtain a limited three-dimensional field-of-view IMA utilizes an electrostatic entrance <b>deflection</b> <b>system</b> to bring particles in from about ± 45 ° from the viewing plane of the instrument. The entrance deflection is stepped through 16 different elevation angles with an angular spacing close to 5.625 ° to obtain a total angular coverage of 90 ° out of the instrument viewing plane. Part of the three-dimensional field-of-view is blocked by the spacecraft body and the solar panels. Throughout our work we use only data from viewing directions which are not affected by spacecraft blocking. We use a conservative approximation of the blocking due to the moveable solar panels, rather removing too much than too little data. At energies below 50 eV the entrance <b>deflection</b> <b>system</b> has insufficient resolution to obtain the desired angles of deflection, and therefore the entrance <b>deflection</b> <b>system</b> is set to a value as close to zero deflection as possible. This means that below 50 eV the measurements are two-dimensional.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the question of}} an optical unit designing for transmitting power laser radiation through an optical fiber. The aim of this work is designing a simple construction unit with minimized reflection losses. The source of radiation in the optical unit described below is an ultraviolet laser with diode pumping. We present the general functioning scheme and designing features for the three main parts: laser beam deflecting system, laser beam dump and optical unit control system. The described laser beam <b>deflection</b> <b>system</b> is composed of a moving flat mirror and a spherical scattering mirror. Comparative analysis of the production technology for such mirrors was carried out, and, as a result, {{the decision was made}} to produce both mirrors of 99. 99 % pure molybdenum without coating. A moving mirror deflects laser emission from a source through a fiber or deflects it on a spherical mirror and into the laser beam dump, moreover, switching from one position to another occurs almost immediately. It is shown that a scattering mirror is necessary, otherwise, the absorbing surface of the beam dump is being worn out irregularly. The laser beam dump is an open conical cavity, in which the conical element with its spire turned to the emission source is placed. Special microgeometry of the internal surface of the beam dump is suggested for the better absorption effect. An optical unit control system consists of a laser beam <b>deflection</b> <b>system,</b> laser temperature sensor, <b>deflection</b> <b>system</b> solenoid temperature sensor, and deflection mirror position sensor.

40|$|Large solar flares {{produce a}} {{significant}} amount of energetic particles which pose a hazard for human activity in space. In the hope of understanding flare mechanisms and thus better predicting solar flares, NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) developed an experimental vector magnetograph (EXVM) polarimeter to measure the Sun's magnetic field. The EXVM will be used to perform ground-based solar observations and will provide a proof of concept for the design of a similar instrument for the Japanese Solar-B space mission. The EXVM typically operates for a period of several minutes. During this time there is image motion due to atmospheric fluctuation and telescope wind loading. To optimize the EXVM performance an image motion compensation device (sunspot tracker) is needed. The sunspot tracker consists of two parts, an image motion determination system and an image <b>deflection</b> <b>system.</b> For image motion determination a CCD or CID camera is used to digitize an image, than an algorithm is applied to determine the motion. This motion or error signal is sent to the image <b>deflection</b> <b>system</b> which moves the image back to its original location. Both of these systems are under development. Two algorithms are available for sunspot tracking which require the use of only one row and one column of image data. To implement these algorithms, two identical independent systems are being developed, one system for each axis of motion. Two CID cameras have been purchased; the data from each camera will be used to determine image motion for each direction. The error signal generated by the tracking algorithm will be sent to an image <b>deflection</b> <b>system</b> consisting of an actuator and a mirror constrained to move about one axis. Magnetostrictive actuators were chosen to move the mirror over piezoelectrics due to their larger driving force and larger range of motion.
