50|$|<b>Eribulin</b> is a {{mechanistically}} unique inhibitor of microtubule dynamics, binding predominantly to a {{small number}} of high affinity sites at the plus ends of existing microtubules. <b>Eribulin</b> has both cytotoxic and non-cytotoxic mechanisms of action. Its cytotoxic effects are related to its antimitotic activities, wherein apoptosis of cancer cells is induced following prolonged and irreversible mitotic blockade. In addition to its cytotoxic, antimitotic-based mechanisms, preclinical studies in human breast cancer models have shown that <b>eribulin</b> also exerts complex effects on the biology of surviving cancer cells and residual tumors that appear unrelated to its antimitotic effects. These non-mitotic mechanisms include vascular remodeling that leads to increased tumor perfusion and mitigation of tumor hypoxia, phenotypic changes consistent with reversal of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and decreased capacity for migration and invasion leading to reduced metastatic capacity as measured in a preclinical experimental metastasis model. In other studies, <b>eribulin</b> treatment of leiomyosarcoma and liposarcoma cells leads to increased expression of smooth muscle and adipocyte differentiation antigens, respectively.|$|E

We evaluated the efficacy {{and safety of}} ramucirumab and <b>eribulin</b> versus <b>eribulin</b> alone as third- to fifth-line therapy in women with advanced breast cancer. Patients and MethodsIn this randomized (1 : 1), open-label, phase II study, US women aged 18 years or older with 2 to 4 previous chemotherapy regimens for locally recurrent or MBC, previous anthracycline and taxane treatment, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 received ramucirumab with <b>eribulin</b> or <b>eribulin</b> alone in 21 -day cycles (<b>eribulin</b> 1. 4 mg/m 2 intravenously on days 1 and 8; ramucirumab 10 mg/kg intravenously on day 1). Randomization was stratified according to previous antiangiogenic therapy and triple-negative status. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) in the intention to treat population. ResultsOne hundred forty-one women were randomized to ramucirumab with <b>eribulin</b> (n = 71) or <b>eribulin</b> alone (n = 70). Median PFS for ramucirumab with <b>eribulin</b> was 4. 4 months (95 % confidence interval [CI], 3. 1 - 6. 7) compared with 4. 1 months (95 % CI, 3. 2 - 5. 6) for <b>eribulin</b> (hazard ratio [HR], 0. 83; 95 % CI, 0. 56 - 1. 23; P =. 35).

30|$|Despite being {{routinely}} prescribed worldwide {{for several}} years, data regarding the safety, efficacy, and survival benefit of <b>eribulin</b> in clinical settings {{for the treatment}} of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) are limited. This retrospective observational study investigated the survival benefit of <b>eribulin</b> compared with conventional chemotherapy regimens in Japanese women with MBC. Women with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER 2)-negative (ER+/HER 2 −) MBC, including unresectable locally advanced breast cancer, treated at a single institution were included in this study. The primary efficacy measure assessed overall survival (OS), and safety was evaluated as the number of grade 3 and 4 adverse events. Of the 293 patients analyzed, 66 received <b>eribulin</b> (<b>eribulin</b> arm) and 227 received conventional chemotherapeutic agents excluding <b>eribulin</b> (noneribulin arm). The median OS from MBC diagnosis in the <b>eribulin</b> arm was 72.1  months (95  % CI 13.3 – 168.3) compared with 43.3  months (95  % CI 9.1 – 202.0) in the noneribulin arm [hazard ratio (HR): 0.67, 95  % CI 0.47 – 0.96; P =  0.025]. No significant differences were noted in OS between <b>eribulin</b> used as a first-/second-line or third-/>third-line treatment for MBC. No patient discontinued <b>eribulin</b> therapy due to AEs. In the <b>eribulin</b> arm, grade 4 neutropenia and grade 3 febrile neutropenia were observed in 8 (12.1  %) and 4 (6.1  %) patients, respectively. <b>Eribulin</b> therapy has a survival benefit in Japanese women with ER+/HER 2 − MBC in routine clinical practice, with no unexpected grade 3 / 4 AEs. Interestingly, <b>eribulin</b> might be beneficial as any line therapy for ER+/HER 2 − MBC.|$|E
30|$|Because a {{monotherapy}} of S- 1 or <b>eribulin</b> {{has shown}} promising activity in TNBC and <b>eribulin</b> have a manageable toxicity and a modest incidence of neuropathy, {{which appears to}} be lower than with other microtubule inhibitor agents, the combination of S- 1 and <b>eribulin</b> is a hopeful combination regimen for breast cancer including TNBC. Phase I trial of S- 1 and <b>eribulin</b> combination therapy for advanced or recurrent breast cancer pretreated by anthracycline and taxane is being executed in Kinki University Hospital. However, no preclinical studies of this combination have been performed. In this study, we investigated the combination effect of S- 1 (5 -FU) and <b>eribulin</b> on TNBC cell lines both in vitro and in vivo.

40|$|<b>Eribulin</b> mesylate is a novel, non-taxane, {{synthetic}} microtubule inhibitor showing antitumor {{activity in}} a wide range of tumors including soft tissue sarcomas (STS). <b>Eribulin</b> has been recently approved for the treatment of metastatic liposarcoma (LPS) patients previously treated with anthracyclines. This work investigated the mechanism of action of this innovative antitubulin agent in well-differentiated/dedifferentiated LPS (ALT/DDLPS) which represents one of the most common adipocytic sarcoma histotypes. A primary culture of ALT/DDLPS from a 54 -year-old patient was established.

40|$|Treatment of {{advanced}} ovarian cancer involves platinum-based chemotherapy. However, chemoresistance {{is a major}} obstacle. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) {{are thought to be}} one of the causes of chemoresistance, but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Recently, human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) has been reported to promote CSC-like traits. In this study, we found that a mitotic inhibitor, <b>eribulin</b> mesylate (<b>eribulin),</b> effectively inhibited growth of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines. Eribulin-sensitive cells showed a higher efficiency for sphere formation, suggesting that these cells possess an enhanced CSC-like phenotype. Moreover, these cells expressed a higher level of hTERT, and suppression of hTERT expression by siRNA resulted in decreased sensitivity to <b>eribulin,</b> suggesting that hTERT may be a target for <b>eribulin.</b> Indeed, we found that <b>eribulin</b> directly inhibited RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) activity, but not telomerase activity of hTERT in vitro.

The results of the EMBRACE study (Cortes et al. 2011) and the pooled analysis of two phase III studies (EMBRACE and study 301) (Twelves et al. 2014) suggest that <b>eribulin</b> could prolong survival in patients with late-stage MBC, particularly in those who have been heavily pretreated. In the present study, <b>eribulin</b> demonstrated a significant survival benefit in patients treated with an anthracycline-based regimen for MBC; thus, <b>eribulin</b> may be beneficial for patients who did not respond to an anthracycline-based regimen. In addition, almost half of the eribulin-treated patients had received the drug as a third- or beyond third-line treatment, and the efficacy of <b>eribulin</b> in these {{patients was}} comparable to those who received <b>eribulin</b> as first- or second-line treatment.

30|$|Recently, <b>eribulin,</b> a nontaxane {{microtubule}} dynamics inhibitor {{belonging to}} the halichondrin class of antineoplastic agents, has shown anticancer activity in women with MBC. Three phase II {{studies have demonstrated that}} <b>eribulin</b> has potent anticancer activity with acceptable tolerability (Aogi et al. 2012; Cortes et al. 2010; Vahdat et al. 2009). A phase III randomized study (study 305, NCT 00388726 or EMBRACE) demonstrated a significant and clinically meaningful improvement in survival with <b>eribulin</b> compared with the physician’s choice of treatment in women who were heavily pretreated with manageable toxicity (Cortes et al. 2011). In another phase III randomized study (study 301), <b>eribulin</b> showed a favorable improvement in overall survival (OS) compared with capecitabine; however, this improvement did not meet the predefined criteria for statistical significance (Kaufman et al. 2015. In addition, a pooled analysis of both the aforementioned phase III studies demonstrated that eribulin-treated patients had a significantly prolonged OS compared with the controls. Moreover, the OS results for <b>eribulin</b> were favorable in all population subgroups (Twelves et al. 2014). Based on the results of these studies, <b>eribulin</b> has been approved in the United States and certain other countries for the treatment of MBC previously treated with at least two chemotherapeutic agents, including anthracycline- and taxane-based regimens. In Europe, <b>eribulin</b> has been approved for the treatment of MBC previously treated with at least one chemotherapy regimen.

40|$|Purpose A phase III study {{comparing}} <b>eribulin</b> with dacarbazine {{in patients}} with advanced liposarcoma (LPS) or leiomyosarcoma showed a significant improvement in overall survival (OS) for the <b>eribulin</b> arm, with a manageable toxicity profile. We now report the histology-specific subgroup analysis of the efficacy and safety of <b>eribulin</b> compared with dacarbazine {{in patients with}} LPS, an independently randomized stratified subgroup of this phase III trial. Methods Patients >/= 18 years with advanced or metastatic dedifferentiated, myxoid/round cell, or pleomorphic LPS incurable by surgery or radiotherapy were included. Patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status </= 2 and two or more prior systemic treatment regimens, including one with anthracycline, were randomly assigned 1 : 1 to receive <b>eribulin</b> mesylate (1. 4 mg/m 2 intravenously on days 1 and 8) or dacarbazine (850, 1, 000, or 1, 200 mg/m 2 intravenously on day 1) every 21 days. OS, progression-free survival (PFS), and safety were analyzed. Results In the LPS subgroup, OS was significantly improved: 15. 6 versus 8. 4 months (hazard ratio, 0. 51; 95 % CI, 0. 35 to 0. 75; P <. 001) with <b>eribulin</b> versus dacarbazine, respectively. Longer OS with <b>eribulin</b> was observed in all LPS histologic subtypes and in all geographic regions evaluated. PFS was also improved with <b>eribulin</b> versus dacarbazine (2. 9 v 1. 7 months, respectively; hazard ratio, 0. 52; 95 % CI, 0. 35 to 0. 78; P =. 0015). Adverse events were similar between arms. Conclusion In patients with previously treated LPS, <b>eribulin</b> was associated with significantly superior OS and PFS compared with dacarbazine. <b>Eribulin</b> represents an important treatment option for patients with LPS, a sarcoma subtype for which limited effective systemic treatments are available. Further studies are justified to explore the role of <b>eribulin</b> in earlier lines of therapy {{as well as in}} combination with other agents...|$|E
30|$|In summary, as with phase II/III studies, {{the present}} study which {{retrospectively}} investigated the efficacy and safety of <b>eribulin</b> in Japanese women with ER+/HER 2 − MBC in routine clinical practice demonstrated a significant survival benefit of <b>eribulin</b> in such patients, with a relatively lower dose intensity and no unexpected grade 3 and 4 adverse events. The survival benefit of <b>eribulin</b> was regardless of the organs involved, previous treatment regimens, or line of treatment. <b>Eribulin</b> might be beneficial as any line treatment for ER+/HER 2 − MBC; however, further validation of the current findings should be performed in a larger study.|$|E

Notably, grade 3 / 4 peripheral neuropathy, the most common adverse event leading to discontinuation of <b>eribulin</b> therapy in EMBRACE, was not observed {{in the present study}}. In addition, no patient discontinued <b>eribulin</b> therapy due to adverse events. Based on the low incidence of adverse events and no treatment discontinuation, the safety profile of <b>eribulin</b> in the present study may be considered more acceptable than that in previously reported phase II/III studies (Aogi et al. 2012; Cortes et al. 2010; Vahdat et al. 2009; Cortes et al. 2011; Kaufman et al. 2015; Twelves et al. 2014). The median relative dose intensity of <b>eribulin</b> was 47.4  %, and the dose was modified to prevent the occurrence of unwarranted toxicity at the physician’s discretion.

A more recent phase 3 study, which compared <b>eribulin</b> and capecitabine as first-, second-, or third-line therapy for MBC in women who had previously received an anthracycline and a taxane, found no significant difference in OS between the 2 treatments [hazard ratio 0.88 (95  % CI 0.77, 1.00); p =  0.056]; however, for <b>eribulin</b> the median OS (15.9  months), median PFS (4.1  months), and objective response rate (11  %) were comparable to those achieved with <b>eribulin</b> in the EMBRACE trial (13.1, 3.7  months, and 12  %, respectively) (Cortes et al. 2011; Kaufman et al. 2015).|$|E

We determined the sets of genes that were differentially altered between <b>eribulin</b> and paclitaxel treatment in breast, endometrial, and ovarian cancer cell line panels. Our unsupervised clustering analyses revealed that expression profiles of gene sets altered with treatments were correlated with the in vitro antiproliferative activities of the drugs. Several tubulin isotypes had significantly lower expression in cell lines treated with <b>eribulin</b> compared to paclitaxel. Pathway enrichment analyses of gene sets revealed that the common pathways altered between treatments in the 3 cancer panels were related to cytoskeleton remodeling and cell cycle regulation. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway was enriched in genes with significantly altered expression between the two drugs for breast and endometrial cancers, but not for ovarian cancer. Expression of genes from the EMT pathway correlated with <b>eribulin</b> sensitivity in breast cancer and with paclitaxel sensitivity in endometrial cancer. Alteration of expression profiles of EMT genes between sensitive and resistant cell lines allowed us to predict drug sensitivity for breast and endometrial cancers. Gene expression analysis showed that gene sets that were altered between <b>eribulin</b> and paclitaxel correlated with drug in vitro antiproliferative activities in breast and endometrial cancer cell line panels. Among the panels, breast cancer provided the strongest differentiation between <b>eribulin</b> and paclitaxel sensitivities based on gene expression.

In all subgroups assessed, OS data favoured eribulin; significant improvements occurred in some subgroups, notably in women with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER 2) -negative disease (HR 0. 82; P =  0. 002), although the effect in those with HER 2 -negative but hormone-receptor-positive disease did not reach statistical significance; benefits were also seen, among others, in those with estrogen-receptor-negative and triple-negative disease. <b>Eribulin</b> improves OS in various patient subgroups with advanced/metastatic breast cancer who had previously received an anthracycline and a taxane. Women with HER 2 -negative disease are among those who may obtain benefit from <b>eribulin.</b> SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Mark K Doherty, Patrick G Morris Department of Medical Oncology, Beaumont Hospital, Dublin, Ireland Abstract: Breast cancer {{remains a}} {{leading cause of}} cancer-related death internationally. Treatment {{approaches}} for metastatic breast cancer have evolved in recent years; however chemotherapy remains a core component for the majority of patients. Agents such as anthracyclines and taxanes have been extensively studied and form standard treatment. <b>Eribulin</b> mesylate is a novel synthetic microtubule-directed chemotherapy, based on a naturally-occurring compound. Through phase I studies, <b>eribulin</b> was found to be tolerable and activity was seen in patients with metastatic breast cancer. Phase II studies in metastatic breast cancer further demonstrated its efficacy, with responses and survival which compare favorably with other studied chemotherapy agents. The phase III EMBRACE study showed superior survival for patients treated with <b>eribulin</b> compared with those who received a physician’s choice control. This led to its approval for use in many countries in this setting. Its toxicity profile is well established and manageable for the most part, with the commonest reported toxicities being alopecia, fatigue, neutropenia and peripheral neuropathy. A second reported phase III study comparing <b>eribulin</b> to capecitabine failed to show an improvement in survival in pretreated patients. This article reviews the clinical pharmacology and mechanism of action of <b>eribulin,</b> and summarizes the results of the major preclinical and clinical studies of <b>eribulin</b> in metastatic breast cancer.

30|$|In conclusion, {{we showed}} that the {{combination}} of S- 1 (5 -FU) and <b>eribulin</b> exerts a synergistic anti-tumor effect against TNBC cell lines in vitro and in vivo through the MET induction by <b>eribulin.</b> This combination may be beneficial to TNBC treatment, and the present evidence provides a good rationale to clinical studies for metastatic breast cancer patients. Currently, we are conducting a clinical study of S- 1 and <b>eribulin</b> combination for metastatic breast cancer and clinical benefit of this regimen is being evaluated.|$|E
40|$|ABSTR ACT: Brain metastases {{are common}} in {{patients}} with advanced breast cancer (BC), causing considerable morbidity and mortality. <b>Eribulin</b> is a microtubule dynamics inhibitor approved for treating certain patients with metastatic BC, previously treated with an anthracycline and a taxane. In the 301 phase 3 study in 1102 women with advanced BC, <b>eribulin</b> and capecitabine treatments did not differ for co-primary endpoints (overall survival [OS]: 15. 9 vs 14. 5 months, P  =  0. 056; progression-free survival [PFS]: 4. 1 vs 4. 2 months, P  =  0. 30). Here, we report outcomes for six patients (<b>eribulin,</b> n = 3; capecitabine, n = 3) who had received treatment for brain metastases from BC (BCBM) at baseline. All eribulin-treated patients experienced brain lesion shrinkage {{at some point during}} treatment, compared with one capecitabine-treated patient. Fewer patients in study 301 developed new BCBM with <b>eribulin</b> (13 / 544, 2. 4 %) compared with capecitabine (25 / 546, 4. 6 %). <b>Eribulin</b> does not cross the healthy blood–brain barrier (BBB), but could have the potential to do so after cranial radiation therapy. Capecitabine may cross the BBB and has demonstrated activity in BCBM. Data from these patients and previous cases suggest that further investigation of <b>eribulin</b> for BCBM may be warranted...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE AND METHODS: Our {{secondary}} analyses compared survival with <b>eribulin</b> versus capecitabine {{in various}} patient subgroups from a phase 3, open-label, randomized study. Eligible women aged ≥ 18 years with advanced/metastatic {{breast cancer and}} ≤ 3 prior chemotherapies (≤ 2 for advanced/ metastatic disease), including an anthracycline and taxane, were randomized 1 : 1 to intravenous <b>eribulin</b> mesylate 1. 4 mg/m 2 on days 1 and 8 or twice-daily oral capecitabine 1250 mg/m 2 on days 1 – 14 (21 -day cycles). RESULTS: In the intent-to-treat population (<b>eribulin</b> 554 and capecitabine 548), overall survival appeared longer with <b>eribulin</b> than capecitabine in various subgroups, including patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 -negative (15. 9 versus 13. 5 months, respectively), estrogen receptor-negative (14. 4 versus 10. 5 months, respectively), and triple-negative (14. 4 versus 9. 4 months, respectively) disease. Progression-free survival was similar between the treatment arms. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with advanced/metastatic breast cancer and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 -, estrogen receptor-, or triple-negative disease may gain particular benefit from <b>eribulin</b> as first-, second-, and third-line chemotherapies. TRIAL REGISTRATION (PRIMARY STUDY) : This study reports the subgroup analyses of <b>eribulin</b> versus capecitabine from a phase 3, open-label, randomized study (www. clinicaltrials. gov; ClinicalTrials. gov identifier: NCT 00337103).

30|$|Overall, {{the safety}} of <b>eribulin</b> was acceptable, {{although}} five patients (14.3  %) discontinued therapy due to adverse events. The majority of non-hematological adverse events were mild in severity. Grade 3 or 4 sensory neuropathy, which might lead to discontinuation of <b>eribulin</b> therapy, was reported in only one patient. Among hematological adverse events, grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was reported in 62.9  % of patients; thus <b>eribulin</b> should be administered with caution and patients should be monitored closely for severe neutropenia. However, since febrile neutropenia was reported in only two patients, the tolerability of <b>eribulin</b> {{was considered to be}} acceptable. Notably, all reported adverse events were those that might be anticipated with this treatment and no new adverse events were reported in the first-line use of <b>eribulin</b> in this Japanese population. The proportion of patients who experience severe adverse events after initiation of <b>eribulin</b> is relatively low compared to that after initiation of other key drugs for MBC (Cortes et al. 2011; Kaufman et al. 2015; McIntyre et al. 2014). Thus, many patients treated with <b>eribulin</b> might not experience deterioration of their QoL. The current guidelines suggest using a single agent to optimize both treatment length and QoL for first-line therapy, except in the case of immediately life-threatening disease (Partridge et al. 2014; Cardoso et al. 2014). Japanese guidelines (The Japanese Breast Cancer Society 2015) also support this statement and the oral 5 -fluorouracil derivative S- 1 has become a recommended first-line treatment for MBC, along with anthracycline and taxane based on a recent clinical trial conducted in Japan—this trial demonstrated non-inferiority of S- 1 in OS and TTF over taxane; S- 1 also demonstrated less toxicity and better QoL profile compared to taxane (Takashima et al. 2016). In this context, <b>eribulin</b> might also be a recommended first-line treatment for MBC in the Japanese population, though further investigation is warranted.|$|E
