5|$|At some point, Cybi and Caffo parted company, {{possibly}} {{because of a}} <b>disagreement</b> <b>between</b> them, but {{possibly because}} his brother Gildas had insulted Maelgwn, who then forced Cybi to dismiss Caffo – both versions appear in the manuscript accounts. Thereafter, Caffo moved towards the south of Anglesey, where {{he was killed by}} shepherds from the area now called Newborough, perhaps avenging the insult on their king.|$|E

5|$|Liverpool Football Club is an English {{association}} {{football club}} based in Liverpool, Merseyside. The club {{was formed in}} 1892 following a <b>disagreement</b> <b>between</b> the board of Everton and club president John Houlding, who owned the club's ground, Anfield. The <b>disagreement</b> <b>between</b> the two parties over rent resulted in Everton moving to Goodison Park from Anfield, which left Houlding with an empty stadium. Thus, he founded Liverpool F.C. {{to play in the}} empty stadium. Liverpool won the First Division title {{for the first time in}} 1901; since then, the club has won a further 17 league titles, along with seven FA Cups and eight Football League Cups. They have also been crowned champions of European football on five occasions by winning the European Cup/UEFA Champions League in 1977, 1978, 1981, 1984 and 2005. The club was one of 22 members of the Premier League when it was formed in 1992. They experienced the most successful period in their history under the management of Bob Paisley, who guided the team to 21 trophies in nine seasons.|$|E

5|$|A {{railroad}} {{was being}} built {{and the population}} of Quorn hoped that it would go through the village {{on its way to}} Sioux City, Iowa. However, the railroad did not go through Quorn. One of the many ideas about why the railroad took a different route was due to a <b>disagreement</b> <b>between</b> the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company and the Close brothers. The actual reason is still unknown. Due to the railroad being the main mode of transportation of goods, the villagers {{had no choice but to}} relocate to a new area. Every business except for a mill was moved to a new area during 1883.|$|E
5|$|After the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) began a {{criminal}} inquiry, further autopsies indicated that Tomlinson {{had died from}} internal bleeding caused by blunt force trauma to the abdomen, in association with cirrhosis of the liver. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided not to charge Harwood, because the <b>disagreement</b> <b>between</b> the first and later pathologists meant they could not show a causal link between the death and alleged assault. That position changed in 2011; after the verdict of unlawful killing, the CPS charged Harwood with manslaughter. He was acquitted in 2012 and dismissed from the service a few months later.|$|E

If there is a <b>disagreement</b> <b>between</b> them, it is taken to a conciliation committee as it is for legislative proposals.

Jennings did this against the wishes of incoming governor Thomas Posey, and there was noted <b>disagreement</b> <b>between</b> the two men on the subject. No action was taken on the legislation at the time, though, because of the outbreak of the War of 1812.|$|E
