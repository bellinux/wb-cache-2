5|$|Jonathan Riley-Smith {{considers}} {{that much of}} the popular understanding of the Crusades derives from the novels of Walter Scott and the French histories by Joseph François Michaud.

5|$|After much contemplation, {{she chose}} not to abdicate. Joseph himself often {{threatened}} to resign as co-regent and emperor, but he, too, was induced not to do so. Her threats of abdication were rarely taken seriously; Maria Theresa believed that her recovery from smallpox in 1767 {{was a sign that}} God wished her to reign until death. It was in Joseph's <b>interest</b> <b>that</b> she remained sovereign, for he often blamed her for his failures and thus avoided taking on the responsibilities of a monarch.|$|E

5|$|After rescuing {{the three}} girls, Ayres tried to jump herself, but {{overcome}} by smoke inhalation, fell limply from the window, striking the projecting shop sign. She missed {{the mattress and}} the crowd below and fell onto the pavement, suffering spinal injuries. Ayres was rushed to nearby Guy's Hospital where, because of the public <b>interest</b> <b>that</b> her story excited, hourly bulletins were issued about her health and Queen Victoria sent a lady-in-waiting to enquire after her condition.|$|E
5|$|Another example {{application}} involves {{both the}} CcdB toxin and CcdA antitoxin.

5|$|Finally, the gold-standard {{method of}} {{cellular}} localization is immunoelectron microscopy. This technique also uses an antibody to the protein of interest, along with classical electron microscopy techniques. The sample {{is prepared for}} normal electron microscopic examination, and then treated with an antibody to the protein of <b>interest</b> <b>that</b> is conjugated to an extremely electro-dense material, usually gold. This allows for the localization of both ultrastructural details {{as well as the}} protein of interest.|$|E
5|$|Hastings {{felt that}} their best chances lay in {{interviewing}} Christopher Addison about his contact with Booth; as Addison was a government minister he could be relied on to tell the truth. The case of Gruban v Booth opened on 7 May 1917 at the King's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice in front of Mr Justice Coleridge. Patrick Hastings and Hubert Wallington represented Gruban, while Booth was represented by Rigby Swift KC and Douglas Hogg. The trial attracted such public <b>interest</b> <b>that</b> {{on the final day}} the barristers found it physically difficult to get through the crowds surrounding the Law Courts.|$|E
5|$|Helena {{was devoted}} to nursing, and took the lead at the {{charitable}} organisations she represented. She was also an active campaigner, and wrote letters to newspapers and magazines promoting the interests of nurse registration. Her royal status helped to promote the publicity and society <b>interest</b> <b>that</b> surrounded organisations such as the Royal British Nurses' Association.

5|$|In 1911, Pound {{introduced}} {{two other}} poets to the Eiffel Tower group: his former fiancée Hilda Doolittle (who had started signing her work H.D.) and {{her future husband}} Richard Aldington. These two were interested in exploring Greek poetic models, especially Sappho, an <b>interest</b> <b>that</b> Pound shared. The compression of expression that they achieved by following the Greek example complemented the proto-Imagist interest in Japanese poetry, and, in 1912, during a meeting {{with them in the}} British Museum tea room, Pound told H.D. and Aldington that they were Imagistes and even appended the signature H.D. Imagiste to some poems they were discussing.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, other European powers {{had decided}} that it was not in their <b>interest</b> <b>that</b> any one power should {{dominate}} the Baltic Sea. After long negotiations, known as the first Concert of the Hague, England sent a large fleet of 43 ships with more than 2,000 cannons. The force did not directly participate in fighting but nevertheless sent a clear message to the Dutch fleet patrolling the Danish waters. England worked hard to broker a peace, aided by France which also declared its willingness to help the Swedes if the Danes refused to negotiate.|$|E
5|$|Other {{possibilities}} exist, as well. For example, immunohistochemistry usually utilizes an antibody {{to one or}} more proteins of <b>interest</b> <b>that</b> are conjugated to enzymes yielding either luminescent or chromogenic {{signals that}} can be compared between samples, allowing for localization information. Another applicable technique is cofractionation in sucrose (or other material) gradients using isopycnic centrifugation. While this technique does not prove colocalization of a compartment of known density and the protein of interest, it does increase the likelihood, and is more amenable to large-scale studies.|$|E

5|$|Writing in 2009, Biran {{suggests}} that De Stem des Bloeds was clearly written from an Indo {{point of view}} because of the positive roles of Indo children.

5|$|Hambro {{made his}} {{literary}} debut in 1958 with the non-fiction book Frankrike ("France"), and released {{his first novel}} two years later. The novel, entitled De frafalnes klubb ("The Club of the Estranged"), was favourably commented upon by contemporary critics, but failed to arouse much subsequent interest from scholars. Hambro's reputation as a novelist rests more on his trilogy about the fictional character Nico Dietmeyer, deemed a Bildungsroman by academics. That work, serialised in the 1960s, was Hambro's first major commercial success, and has been reviewed in detail both by contemporaneous commentators and modern literary scholars. After a few unsuccessful novels in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Hambro turned his writings towards non-fiction, especially focusing on linguistics and politics, fields of <b>interest</b> <b>that</b> he had inherited from his father, who became fascinated by Sanskrit and East Asian poetry during his philology studies. The younger Hambro's most well-known and successful book within linguistics was the 1969 Ting, tanke, tale ("Thing, Thought, Speech"), followed by Språket i funksjon ("Language in Operation") in 1972.|$|E
5|$|In December 2009, Vildanden {{announced}} {{it plans to}} operate routes to Trondheim Airport, Værnes, but lacks financial maneuverability to commence operations. By October 2009, Vildanden owed Kontorbygg, the operator of Geiteryggen, NOK1.5 million in airport fees. Kontorbygg stated that if Vildanden did not pay, the airport would have to file for bankruptcy. Innovation Norway rejected to give Vildanden a loan for NOK3.5 million in December 2009. Kontorbygg stated that the operation of Geiteryggen had cost the municipality NOK50 million {{in the course of}} the five years Vildanden had been operating from it. In February 2010, the Municipality of Skien announced that it required Vildanden to pay back the NOK3.1 million, plus NOK200,000 in <b>interest,</b> <b>that</b> they borrowed in 2007. The loan was renewed in March, after Vildanden paid NOK385,000. From 16 August, Helitrans took over as the operator, using an ATR 42. From 6 September, the company started with flights to Trondheim. The company ceased operations after its last flight on 14 January 2011.|$|E
