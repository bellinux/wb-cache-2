40|$|A {{detailed}} {{approach for}} {{the selection and}} design of seals for helicopter transmissions is presented. There are two major <b>types</b> of <b>seals</b> presently being used and they are lip <b>type</b> <b>seals</b> and mechanical <b>type</b> <b>seals.</b> Lip <b>type</b> <b>seals</b> can be divided in conventional lip seals and hydrodynamic lip seals. Conventional lip seals {{can be used for}} slow-speed, low-pressure, low-temperature sealing. Hydrodynamic lip seals although they are as pressure and temperature limited as conventional lip seals, can operate at a higher speed. Mechanical <b>types</b> <b>seals</b> are comprised of face seals and circumferential seals. Face seals are capable of high speed, high pressure, and high temperature. Circumferential seals can be used in high-speed and high-temperature applications, but will leak excessively at moderate pressures. The performance goals of transmission seals are a life that is at least equal to the scheduled overhaul interval of the gearbox component and a leakage rate of near zero...|$|R

50|$|The <b>flap</b> <b>type</b> meter {{includes}} a spring which returns the internal flap {{to the initial}} position. Sometimes if the spring is tensioned too tightly, it can restrict the incoming air and it would cause the intake air speed to increase when not opened fully.|$|R

50|$|The Stena Britannica {{has four}} main MAN diesel engines, {{producing}} between them 33,600 kW, and providing for a maximum speed of 22 knots (25 mph).

40|$|In {{the present}} paper the effect of <b>flap</b> <b>type</b> wave energy {{converters}} on the response of a floating semi-submersible wind turbine is investigated and reported. Two different layouts {{with regard to the}} number of rotating flaps that are utilized are considered and compared with the case of a pure floating semi-submersible wind turbine. Comparisons of response in terms of stability, motions and internal loads are made for selected environmental conditions. The combined operation of the rotating flaps results in an increase of the produced power without affecting significantly selected critical response quantities of the semi-submersible platform...|$|R
50|$|In the Sherpa, the wing, {{which was}} used without a tailplane, was fitted with {{rotating}} tips comprising approximately one-fifth of the total wing area. These were rotated together (to act as elevators) or in opposition (when they acted as ailerons). They were hinged at about 30% chord and each carried, on the trailing edge, a small anti-balance tab, the fulcrum {{of which could be}} moved by means of an electric actuator. It was expected that the rotary wing tip controls would prove greatly superior to the <b>flap</b> <b>type</b> at transonic speeds and provide greater manœuvrability at high altitudes.|$|R

In spite of possible consequences (e. g. leakage and total machine failure) of a damaged seal-ring due to mechanical overstraining during the assembly process, detailed process expertise is barely existent. The aim of this contribution is to establish a basic understanding for the complex processes during assembly. Therefore contributing elements of elastomeric friction as well as their external influences are analyzed in depth. Finally an outlook on a generalized prediction model of the force-path as a function of relevant factors is given...|$|R
40|$|A 0. 25 -scale semispan wing/body {{model with}} two <b>types</b> of jet <b>flaps</b> was {{tested in the}} Ames 11 - by 11 -Foot Transonic Wind Tunnel. The {{objective}} of that testing was to measure the static aerodynamic forces and moments and wing pressure distributions on six configurations differentiated by wing camber, jet <b>flap</b> <b>type,</b> and jet <b>flap</b> angle. Maximum thrust coefficients were limited to 0. 12. Angle of attack was varied from - 4 deg to 15 deg for Mach numbers between 0. 6 and 0. 95 at a constant unit Reynolds number of 18. 0 million/m (5. 5 million/ft). More refined designs and considerably more testing {{will be required to}} establish the practicability of the total-exhausting jet flap concept...|$|R
50|$|A type of Boundary Layer Control System, blown flaps pass engine-generated air or exhaust {{over the}} flaps to {{increase}} lift beyond that attainable with mechanical <b>flaps.</b> <b>Types</b> include the original (internally blown flap) which blows compressed {{air from the}} engine {{over the top of}} the flap, the externally blown flap, which blows engine exhaust over the upper and lower surfaces of the flap, and upper surface blowing which blows engine exhaust {{over the top of the}} wing and flap. While testing was done in Britain and Germany before the Second World War, and flight trials started, the first production aircraft with blown flaps wasn't until the 1957 Lockheed T2V SeaStar. Upper Surface Blowing was used on the Boeing YC-14 in 1976.|$|R
50|$|Although {{externally}} {{very similar}} to the preceding Z1 and Z2-class trams they had significant design differences, and were a significant improvement on the Z1 and Z2-class trams. They are fitted with AEG control equipment and Duewag bogies, have an additional door each side (for a total of three rather than two for the Z1 and Z2), drop down (as opposed to top sliding) Beclawat windows and improved headlights. The unreliable <b>flap</b> <b>type</b> destination displays and route number indicators were replaced by rollable plastic film destination displays. They also had much smoother acceleration and braking performance, and improved suspension. The Z3-class build process went smoothly, with few problems, bar a slow delivery of equipment from AEG, and a few minor faults that required remedying after construction.|$|R
40|$|The {{flow field}} {{generated}} by a two-dimensional airfoil with a statically deflected <b>flap</b> <b>type</b> spoiler has been experimentally studied. Subsonic tests ascertained the effect of varying spoiler deflection and angle of attack on the flow field at two Reynolds numbers. Measurements of the mean and fluctuating surface pressures and velocities in the wake, along with schlieren flow visualization of the near wake, were made. The results pertaining to the unsteady characteristics of the spoiler flow field are presented. It is shown that vortex shedding characterized the spoiler wake and determines the unsteady nature of the overall flow field; {{the character of the}} vortex shedding changes with spoiler deflection; and the fluctuating surface pressure field (vortex shedding frequency component) is of appreciable magnitude at large spoiler deflections...|$|R
50|$|Phase lag (rotorcraft) {{will cause}} the extra lift to be seen {{approximately}} 90 degrees later in rotor rotation in semi-rigid two bladed rotor systems. Phase lag is a separate phenomenon from gyroscopic precession. Phase lag is a property of all rotating systems acted upon by a periodic force. For systems hinged at the axis of rotation (in our case, a semi rigid <b>flapping</b> <b>type</b> rotor head) the phase lag is 90 degrees. For systems that are hinged at {{some distance from the}} axis of rotation (such as a fully articulated rotor head) the phase lag is less than 90 degrees. The pilot will experience either a right or left roll (see flight dynamics), depending upon whether the rotor of the helicopter rotates clockwise or counter-clockwise.|$|R
40|$|Tests were {{conducted}} in Wisconsin from 1994 through 1996 in several boreholes using an ultrasonic method that was developed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison to assess the integrity of annular seals. Initially, three model boreholes simulating monitoring wells were installed {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of the ultrasonic method. Different <b>types</b> of <b>seals</b> were placed around the casings and defects were purposely introduced in the seals to test the ultrasonic method. The ultrasonic method was effective for detecting the presence of different <b>types</b> of <b>seals</b> and defects and also the changes in the condition of seals with time. Then tests {{were conducted}} in thirteen monitoring and three water supply wells to assess the condition of annular seals. The presence of different <b>types</b> of <b>seals</b> and various defects was detected. It was observed that practices used in Wisconsin for sealing monitoring wells resulted in good seals. However, the practices used for water supply wells resulted in poor seals...|$|R
