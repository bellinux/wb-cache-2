40|$|Immunosuppression of {{juvenile}} squirrel monkeys with combined azathioprine, prednisolone, and antilymphocyte globulin resulted in decreased antibody responses to viral antigens after primary infection with Herpesvirus saimiri (HVS). The virus was repeatedly {{isolated from the}} oropharynx of <b>immunosuppressed</b> <b>monkeys</b> but not from untreated infected controls. Thus immune factors are important in inhibiting shedding of HVS from the oropharynx. HVS could be isolated from the peripheral blood lymphocytes of infected control monkeys but not from the lymphocytes of <b>immunosuppressed</b> <b>monkeys.</b> <b>Immunosuppressed</b> <b>monkeys</b> also had decreased percentages of lymphocytes capable of forming rosettes with sheep erythrocytes. These {{results indicate that the}} immunosuppressive agents had inhibitory effects on lymphocytes (presumably thymus derived) capable of being latently infected with HVS. Antibody responses in newborn monkeys infected with HVS were delayed compared with juvenile monkeys. Treatment of newborn monkeys with antilymphocyte globulin had no suppressive effect on antibody responses to HVS...|$|R
40|$|A simian cell line, Si-IIA, {{harboring}} Epstein-Barr-virus (EBV) -related herpesvirus (Si-IIA-EBV), produces {{malignant lymphoma}} in rabbits when administered by intravenous inoculation. In this study, we analyzed the Si-IIA-EBV genome and compared it with human EBV and herpesvirus macaca fascicularis 1 (HVMF 1), which {{is associated with}} B-cell lymphoma developing in SIV-infected <b>immunosuppressed</b> <b>monkeys.</b> DNA from Si-IIA-EBV was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction using three different primer pairs complementary to human EBV (B 95 - 8) DNA; two of the primer pairs covered part of the long internal repeat 1 region (IR 1) and the third covered part of the BRRF 1 region. Direct sequencing of the three PCR products revealed that Si-IIA-EBV DNA had about 82 % nucleotide homology to the human EBV DNA in all three regions and 92. 4 % homology to HVMF 1 in the IR 1 region. The blotting pattern by Southern blot analysis was different between Si-IIA-EBV and human EBV. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe have {{previously}} reported {{the identification of}} a novel simian parvovirus in cynomolgus monkeys, which causes severe anemia in <b>immunosuppressed</b> cynomolgus <b>monkeys</b> and is currently being studied as an animal model for human B 19 infection. We now report two similar outbreaks of anemia in rhesus and pig-tailed macaques associated with two distinct but similar simian parvoviruses (pig-tailed macaque and rhesus parvovirus). Both viruses have been cloned and over 5000 nucleotides sequenced from each virus. The viruses show marked similarities to {{other members of the}} Erythrovirus genus in the Parvoviridae family...|$|R
40|$|Rearrangements of the JC virus (JCV) {{regulatory}} region (RR) {{are consistently}} {{found in the}} brains of patients with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), whereas the archetype RR is present in their kidneys. In addition, the C terminus of the large T antigen (T-Ag) shows greater variability in PML than does {{the rest of the}} coding region. To determine whether similar changes in simian virus 40 (SV 40) are necessary for disease induction in monkeys, we sequenced the SV 40 RR and the C terminus of the T-Ag from the brain of simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) -infected monkey 18429, which presented spontaneously with an SV 40 -associated PML-like disease, {{as well as from the}} peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), kidneys, and brains of SV 40 -seronegative, SHIV-infected monkeys 21289 and 21306, which were inoculated with the 18429 brain SV 40 isolate. These animals developed both SV 40 -associated PML and meningoencephalitis. Thirteen types of SV 40 RR were characterized. Compared to the SV 40 archetype, we identified RRs with variable deletions in either the origin of replication, the 21 -bp repeat elements, or the late promoter, as well as deletions or duplications of the 72 -bp enhancer. The archetype was the most prominent RR in the brain of monkey 18429. Shortly after inoculation, a wide range of RRs could be found in the PBMC of monkeys 21289 and 21306. However, the archetype RR became the predominant type in their blood, kidneys, and brains at the time of sacrifice. On the contrary, the T-Ag C termini remained identical in all compartments of the three animals. These results indicate that unlike JCV in humans, rearrangements of SV 40 RR are not required for brain disease induction in <b>immunosuppressed</b> <b>monkeys...</b>|$|R
40|$|Epidemiological {{studies found}} that {{hepatitis}} E virus genotype 3 (HEV- 3) infection was associated with chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis in immunocompromised patients. Our study aimed to investigate {{the relationship between the}} host immunosuppressive status and the occurrence of HEV-related chronic hepatitis. Here we describe a successful experimental study, using cynomolgus monkeys previously treated with tacrolimus, a potent calcineurin inhibitor immunosuppressant, and infected with a Brazilian HEV- 3 strain isolated from naturally infected pigs. HEV infected monkeys were followed up during 160 days post infection (dpi) by clinical signs; virological, biochemical and haematological parameters; and liver histopathology. The tacrolimus blood levels were monitored throughout the experiment. Immunosuppression was confirmed by clinical and laboratorial findings, such as: moderate weight loss, alopecia, and herpes virus opportunistic infection. In this study, chronic HEV infection was characterized by the mild increase of liver enzymes serum levels; persistent RNA viremia and viral faecal shedding; and liver histopathology. Three out of four <b>immunosuppressed</b> <b>monkeys</b> showed recurrent HEV RNA detection in liver samples, evident hepatocellular ballooning degeneration, mild to severe macro and microvesicular steatosis (zone 1), scattered hepatocellular apoptosis, and lobular focal inflammation. At 69 dpi, liver biopsies of all infected monkeys revealed evident ballooning degeneration (zone 3), discrete hepatocellular apoptosis, and at most mild portal and intra-acinar focal inflammation. At 160 dpi, the three chronically HEV infected monkeys showed microscopic features (piecemeal necrosis) corresponding to chronic hepatitis in absence of fibrosis and cirrhosis in liver parenchyma. Within 4 -months follow up, the tacrolimus-immunosuppressed cynomolgus monkeys infected with a Brazilian swine HEV- 3 strain exhibited more severe hepatic lesions progressing to chronic hepatitis without liver fibrosis, similarly as shown in tacrolimus-immunosuppressed solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients. The cause-effect relationship between HEV infection and tacrolimus treatment was confirmed in this experiment...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Human post-tranplant {{lymphoproliferative}} disorder (PTLD) {{has been shown}} to be strongly associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. Sporadic cases of PTLD associated with the presence of EBV with a B cell phenotype have also been reported in transplanted non-human primates. In our centre, only 1 primate in 50 renal xenotransplant recipients, developed PTLD. In the present study we evaluated the morphological characteristics, immunophenotype and the possible association with EBV of the PTLD observed in this transplanted primate. Material and Methods: Nephrectomized primates were transplanted with hDAF transgenic porcine kidney and received different regimens of immunosuppression. At euthanasia, samples from all tissues and organs were collected and prepared for H&E staining and immunohistochemical analyses for T cells, B cells and EBV nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA 2). Results: Macroscopic evaluation of the primate specimens showed a moderate diffuse lymphoadenomegaly. The microscopical analysis demonstrated the presence of a monomorphous atypical lymphoid population, densely arranged in sheets, which altered the lymph node architecture and infiltrated lungs, stomach and liver. Dense cellular lymphoid aggregates were also frequently observed in small arteries and lymphatic vessels. The cells showed a high nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio and scant to moderate homogeneous eosinophilic cytoplasm with indistinct cell boundaries. The nucleus (10 - 14 microns in diameter) was central, round, with hyperchromatic clumped chromatin and one prominent eosinophilic central nucleolus. There was mild anisocytosis, moderate anisokaryosis and scattered apoptotic lymphoid cells. Between 2 to 6 lymphoid mitotic cells were present per high power field. The immunohistochemical analysis of neoplastic cells showed diffuse and intense specific reactivity with the anti-CD 20 monoclonal antibody (mAb). Scattered reactive lymphocytes and occasional pseudo-follicular aggregates were moderately positive to anti-CD 3, CD 5 and CD 79 Î±cy mAbs. There was a diffuse specific nuclear reaction to the anti-EBNA 2 mAb. Conclusion: In our series of transplanted primates, only one case of multiorgan monomorphic B-cell PTLD, associated with an EBV-related herpesvirus could be observed. This study demonstrated that PTLD is an uncommon event following the transplantation of pig organs into <b>immunosuppressed</b> cynomolgus <b>monkeys...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: Generalized CMV infections {{have been}} {{observed}} in <b>immunosuppressed</b> cynomolgus <b>monkeys.</b> Therefore, {{in this study we}} have investigated, using different approaches, the presence of CMV infection in a series of 49 primate recipients of porcine renal xenografts. Methods: Fifty-two Macaca fascicularis were used: 49 were recipients of kidney xenografts and 3 were part of a pharmacokinetic trial. All primates were housed in the same facility and treated with immunosuppressive drugs. As a high level of homology between Rhesus and Macaca fascicularis CMV has previously been reported, primates were tested serologically by ELISA for rhCMV upon arrival at the facility and, in some cases, also at the time of transplantation. Three-hundred and twenty formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections of gastrointestinal (GI) tract were analysed by light microscopy. All sections were also studied by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for expression of RhCMV IE 1 antigen. A consensus-PCR with specificity for the herpesviral DNA-directed DNA polymerase gene (DPOL) was performed on a cryopreserved lung tissue of an IHC strongly positive primate. Results: Upon arrival at the facility, 22 primates were serologically positive for CMV, 20 were negative and 10 were equivocal. The serological test repeated on the negative and doubtful animals at the time of transplantation showed that all primates had serum-converted. GI-tract sections of 5 of the 52 primates analysed showed lesions associated with CMV infection. However, 8 primates were IHC positive for CMV although 3 did not show any histological evidences of CMV infection. Antigen IE 1 was detected in epithelial cells in 6 out of 8 primates. The molecular analysis by PCR revealed a 99 % identity of the DPOL gene between Rhesus and Macaca fascicularis CMV (100 % identity at amino acid level). Conclusions: IHC is more sensitive and specific in the detection of CMV infection in immunosuppressed, xenotransplanted primates than classical histology. Our data suggest that all the animals serum-converted for CMV whilst waiting for xenotransplantation. In the light of the frequent observation of CMV-related lesions in xenotransplanted animals, an effective anti-CMV prophylaxis appears to be indispensable in such model...|$|R
40|$|Members of the Hepadnaviridae {{family have}} been {{isolated}} from birds, rodents, and primates. A new hepadnavirus {{isolated from the}} woolly monkey, a New World primate, is phylogenetically distinct from other primate isolates. An animal model has been established for woolly monkey hepatitis B virus (WMHBV) by using spider monkeys, since woolly monkeys are endangered. In this study, a greater-than-genome length construct was prepared without amplification by using covalently closed circular DNA extracted from the liver of an infected woolly monkey. Transfection of the human liver cell line Huh 7 with WMHBV DNA resulted {{in the production of}} viral transcripts, DNA replicative intermediates, and secreted virions at levels similar to those obtained with an infectious human HBV clone, demonstrating that the host range restriction of WMHBV is not at the level of genome replication. WMHBV particles from the medium of transfected cultures initiated an infection in a spider monkey similar to that obtained with virions derived from woolly monkey serum. In an attempt to adapt the virus for higher levels of replication in spider <b>monkeys,</b> <b>immunosuppressed</b> and newborn animals were inoculated. Neither procedure produced persistent infections, and the level of viral replication remained several logs lower than that observed in persistently infected woolly monkeys. These data demonstrate the production of an infectious clone for WMHBV and extend the characterization of the spider monkey animal model...|$|R
40|$|Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and its oncogene, {{the latent}} {{membrane}} protein 1 (LMP 1), {{are associated with}} many human malignancies. Likewise, EBV-like viruses {{have been associated with}} lymphomas in <b>immunosuppressed</b> cynomolgus <b>monkeys.</b> This study characterizes the biology of Cyno-EBV, a cynomolgus monkey EBV-like virus, including the structural proteins, antigenic relatedness to EBV and molecular and functional analysis of its LMP 1 homologue. Cyno-EBV infection is ubiquitous in its host species. In vitro, Cyno-EBV immortalized cynomolgus monkey but not human B cells. The electrophoretic profile of Cyno-EBV structural proteins was almost identical to that of EBV proteins, and cynomolgus monkey and human sera showed reciprocal reactivities for several of these proteins, including the EBV receptor binding protein gp 350. The coding region of the Cyno-EBV LMP 1 gene was cloned and expressed. The sequence predicted a 588 amino acid (a. a.) protein with a 19 a. a. N-terminus, 6 transmembrane domains and a carboxy tail of 404 a. a. containing a 8 -histidine cluster used as a natural protein tag in expression studies. Western blot analysis revealed a major polypeptide of 110 kDa. Cyno-EBV LMP 1 contained series of repeats that shared no homology with other LMP 1 s. However, a proline-rich sequence GPXXPX 6 found within the 11 a. a. -repeats of EBV LMP 1 was conserved in a non-repeat region of Cyno-EBV LMP 1 and contained two Janus kinase (JAK) binding motifs PXXPXP. Cyno-EBV LMP 1 harbored 4 motifs PXQXT/S, predicted to interact with TRAFs, adapter proteins of the tumor necrosis factor receptor signaling pathway, which lead to activation of the nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB). Cyno-EBV LMP 1 shared the same ability as EBV LMP 1 to induce a NFkappaB driven reporter gene. An apparent increased toxicity of Cyno-EBV LMP 1 for rodent Rat- 1 cells impeded the establishment of LMP 1 expressing cell lines whereas a reduced toxicity was observed for transiently expressing 293 cells when compared to EBV LMP 1. Cyno-EBV is structurally and antigenically closely related to EBV. Cyno-EBV LMP 1 harbored several features and motifs found in EBV LMP 1. New conserved sequences were reported including a histidine cluster and a proline-rich sequence encompassing two Janus kinase binding motifs. The increased numbers of TRAF motifs found in Cyno-EBV LMP 1 did not result in increased ability to activate NFkappaB in 293 cells and as for EBV LMP 1, the protein appeared to have specific cell type toxicity...|$|R
40|$|To date, {{the best}} results in life-supporting pig-to-primate renal {{xenotransplantation}} have been obtained in recipients exposed to long-term immunosuppression with cyclophosphamide. As this agent is frequently associated with side-effects, we have explored the potential of a mycophenolate sodium-based maintenance immunosuppression in this model. Human decay-accelerating factor (hDAF) transgenic kidneys were transplanted into splenectomized and bilaterally nephrectomized cynomolgus <b>monkeys</b> <b>immunosuppressed</b> with mycophenolate sodium, cyclosporin A and steroids, and exposed to a brief induction course with cyclophosphamide (up to four doses). After transplantation, the primates were monitored daily for biochemical and haematological evaluations and for the measurements of haemolytic anti-pig antibodies (APA). A detailed histological analysis of each explanted graft was also performed. All the animals showed very poor initial graft function but survived for up to 51 days. In contrast to our previous studies in xenograft recipients on long-term immunosuppression with cyclophosphamide, minimal or no circulating xeno-directed antibodies, {{as measured by the}} evaluation of APA titres, were detected in this series although some degree of acute humoral rejection was observed in all the explanted grafts and was the primary cause of graft failure. Furthermore, in addition to areas of humorally mediated graft damage, we have observed for the first time areas with exclusive and prominent infiltration by CD 2 + and CD 8 + mononuclear cells presenting patterns compatible with tubulitis, glomerulitis and arteritis, which we have called acute cellular xenograft rejection (ACXR). In addition, CD 68 + infiltrating macrophages and CD 20 + B-cells were also present. This study demonstrates that a triple maintenance immunosuppression with mycophenolate sodium, cyclosporin A and steroids is a viable alternative to a cyclophosphamide-based immunosuppression to obtain prolonged survival of porcine organs transplanted into primates. However, a more stringent control of antibody forming cells remains essential to further extend the survival of xenografts in this model. In addition, the use of the immunosuppressive regimen reported here in the primate is associated with the occurrence of a new category of cell-mediated xenograft injury (ACXR) whose significance has yet to be clarified...|$|R
