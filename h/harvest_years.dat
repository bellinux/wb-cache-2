The dry matter (DM) {{production of}} Trifolium repens, T. ambiguum and the backcross 1 (BC 1) and backcross 2 (BC 2) hybrids with T. repens as the recurrent parent were compared in mixtures with an intermediate heading variety of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) under a cutting-only management over 3 <b>harvest</b> <b>years.</b> Plots of parental legume species and backcross hybrids were established from small plantlets and oversown with the companion grass. In the first harvest year, the DM {{yield of clover}} in T. repens plots was greater than that in the BC 2 plots and both greater than in the BC 1 plots, whilst {{in the second and}} third <b>harvest</b> <b>years</b> differences between the DM yield of clover in the T. repens and the BC 1 and BC 2 hybrid plots were small. Similar results were obtained for the DM yield of total herbage. There were also differences in seasonal growth in the first harvest year, when yield of clover in T. repens plots was greater than in the BC 1 and BC 2 hybrid plots at early cuts but not at later cuts. Few differences in seasonal growth were observed between parental species and hybrids in subsequent <b>harvest</b> <b>years.</b> Comparison of above- and below-ground biomass showed more DM in roots and rhizome of clover in the backcrosses than in the T. repens plots in the second harvest year but differences were less evident in the third harvest year.
