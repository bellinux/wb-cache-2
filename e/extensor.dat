5|$|Anatomically, spiders {{differ from}} other {{arthropods}} {{in that the}} usual body segments are fused into two tagmata, the cephalothorax and abdomen, and joined by a small, cylindrical pedicel. Unlike insects, spiders do not have antennae. In all except the most primitive group, the Mesothelae, spiders have the most centralized nervous systems of all arthropods, as all their ganglia are fused into one mass in the cephalothorax. Unlike most arthropods, spiders have no <b>extensor</b> muscles in their limbs and instead extend them by hydraulic pressure.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} {{injuries}} {{at or above}} the lumbar or sacral regions of the spinal cord (lower back and pelvis) include decreased control of the legs and hips, genitourinary system, and anus. People injured below level L2 may still have use of their hip flexor and knee <b>extensor</b> muscles. Bowel and bladder function are regulated by the sacral region. It is common to experience sexual dysfunction after injury, as well as dysfunction of the bowel and bladder, including fecal and urinary incontinence. It is also possible for the bladder to fail to empty, leading to a potentially harmful buildup of urine. One sign of spinal cord injury that emergency providers may find is priapism, an erection of the penis.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} main muscle {{groups of the}} forelimb. The triceps muscle {{straightens}} the elbow and foreleg, running from the elbow {{to the bottom of}} the shoulder blade. The muscles which extend the lower leg are called <b>extensor</b> muscles, while the flexion of the lower leg joints is achieved through movement of the flexor muscles. There are five main muscles and muscle groups in the hind legs. The vastus muscle flexes the hind leg and runs from stifle to hip, while the gluteal muscles, the large muscles in the hip, extend the femur. Forward motion and flexion of the hind legs is achieved through the movement of the quadriceps group of muscles on the front of the femur, while the muscles at the back of the hindquarters, called the hamstring group, provide forward motion of the body and rearward extension of the hind limbs. Extension of the hock is achieved by the Achilles tendon, located above the hock.|$|E
40|$|A {{test of the}} {{strength}} of children's hip and knee <b>extensors</b> found that children who were congenitally blind or had low vision had weaker knee <b>extensors</b> than did sighted children, but that after the correction for lean body weight (LBW), these differences were not significant. The children who were blind or had low vision also had weaker hip <b>extensors,</b> but after LBW correction, only the blind children's hip <b>extensors</b> were weaker than those of the children with normal vision. The findings indicate that congenitally blind children may be prone to develop weak leg <b>extensors</b> because of poor body build or the constraints of blindness and that they require extensive physical intervention during infancy.

40|$|Background: The most {{important}} trunk stabilizers are the trunk flexors and <b>extensors.</b> The isometric endurance {{of the trunk}} muscles is an essential element for mechanical support of the spine in all positions. The study objectives were {{to find out the}} trunk flexors and <b>extensors</b> endurance, its relationship with normal BMI and to find out the ratio of trunk flexors to <b>extensors</b> endurance. Methods: In this correlation study, 50 subjects were selected by convenience sampling method on the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria from Asia metropolitan university, Malaysia. The trunk flexors and <b>extensors</b> endurance were assessed by Kraus- Weber and Sorenson test respectively. Paired 't' test and Spearman correlation test were used for data analysis. Results: There was a significant difference (p 0. 01 and TEE, rs (50) = - 0. 162, p > 0. 01 but there was a significant strong positive relationship between TFE and TEE, rs (50) = 0. 68, p < 0. 01. The ratio of trunk flexors to <b>extensors</b> was 0. 61. Conclusion: The trunk <b>extensors</b> endurance is higher than trunk flexors endurance and BMI has no relationship with trunk flexors and <b>extensors</b> muscle endurance.

50|$|The {{muscles of}} the thigh can be {{subdivided}} into adductors (medial group), <b>extensors</b> (anterior group), and flexors (posterior group). The <b>extensors</b> and flexors act on the knee joint, while the adductors mainly act on the hip joint.|$|R
5|$|There are two {{apparatus}} in {{the limbs}} {{of the horse}} - the suspensory apparatus and the stay apparatus. The fetlock joint is supported by group of lower leg ligaments, tendons and bones known as the suspensory apparatus. This apparatus carries much {{of the weight of}} the horse, both when standing and while moving, and prevents the fetlock joint from hyperextending, especially when the joint is bearing weight. During movement, the apparatus stores and releases energy {{in the manner of a}} spring: stretching while the joint is extended and contracting (and thus releasing energy) when the joint flexes. This provides a rebound effect, assisting the foot in leaving the ground. This ability to use stored energy makes horses' gaits more efficient than other large animals, including cattle. The suspensory apparatus consists of the suspensory ligament, the check ligament, the deep digital flexor tendon, the superficial flexor tendon, the common digital <b>extensor</b> tendon and the sesamoid bones.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the eight}} legs of a spider {{consists}} of seven distinct parts. The part closest to and attaching the leg to the cephalothorax is the coxa; the next segment is the short trochanter that works as a hinge for the following long segment, the femur; next is the spider's knee, the patella, which acts as the hinge for the tibia; the metatarsus is next, and it connects the tibia to the tarsus (which may {{be thought of as}} a foot of sorts); the tarsus ends in a claw made up of either two or three points, depending on the family to which the spider belongs. Although all arthropods use muscles attached to the inside of the exoskeleton to flex their limbs, spiders and a few other groups still use hydraulic pressure to extend them, a system inherited from their pre-arthropod ancestors. The only <b>extensor</b> muscles in spider legs are located in the three hip joints (bordering the coxa and the trochanter). As a result, a spider with a punctured cephalothorax cannot extend its legs, and the legs of dead spiders curl up. Spiders can generate pressures up to eight times their resting level to extend their legs, and jumping spiders can jump up to 50 times their own length by suddenly increasing the blood pressure in the third or fourth pair of legs. Although larger spiders use hydraulics to straighten their legs, unlike smaller jumping spiders they depend on their flexor muscles to generate the propulsive force for their jumps.|$|E
5|$|The {{brain of}} Smilodon had sulcal {{patterns}} similar to modern cats, which suggests an increased {{complexity of the}} regions that control the sense of hearing, sight, and coordination of the limbs. Felid saber-tooths in general had relatively small eyes that were not as forward-facing as those of modern cats, which have good binocular vision to help them move in trees. Smilodon was likely an ambush predator that concealed itself in dense vegetation, as its limb proportions were similar to modern forest dwelling cats, and its short tail would not have helped it balance while running. Unlike its ancestor Megantereon, which was at least partially scansorial and therefore able to climb trees, Smilodon was probably completely terrestrial due to its greater weight and lack of climbing adaptations. The heel bone of Smilodon was fairly long, which suggests {{it was a good}} jumper. Its well-developed flexor and <b>extensor</b> muscles in its forearms probably enabled it to pull down, and securely hold down, large prey. Analysis of the cross-sections of S.fatalis humeri indicated that they were strengthened by cortical thickening {{to such an extent that}} they would have been able to sustain greater loading than those of extant big cats, or of the extinct American lion. The thickening of S.fatalis femurs was within the range of extant felids. Its canines were fragile and could not have bitten into bone; due to the risk of breaking, these cats had to subdue and restrain their prey with their powerful forelimbs before they could use their canine teeth, and likely used quick slashing or stabbing bites rather than the slow, suffocating bites typically used by modern cats. On rare occasion as evidenced by fossils, Smilodon was willing to risk biting into bone with its canines. This may have been focused more towards competition such as other Smilodon or potential threats such as other carnivores than on prey.|$|E

50|$|In {{the acute}} stage of stroke recovery, {{the use of}} cyclic {{electrical}} stimulation has been seen to increase the isometric strength of wrist <b>extensors.</b> In order to increase strength of wrist <b>extensors,</b> {{there must be a}} degree of motor function at the wrist spared following the stroke and have significant hemiplegia. Patients who will elicit benefits of cyclic electrical stimulation of the wrist <b>extensors</b> must be highly motivated to follow through with treatment, After 8 weeks of electrical stimulation, an increase in grip strength can be apparent. Many scales, which assess the level of disability of the upper extremities following a stroke, use grip strength as a common item.

5|$|The thighbone is {{straight}} in front view. Seen {{from the same}} direction its head is perpendicular to the shaft, seen from above it is orientated 20° to the front. The greater trochanter is relatively wide and separated from the robust lesser trochanter in front of it, by a fissure. At the front base of the lesser trochanter a low accessory trochanter is present. At {{the lower end of}} the thighbone a distinct front, <b>extensor,</b> groove separates the condyles. At the upper inner side of this groove a rough area is present continuing inwards into a longitudinal ridge, a typical megalosauroid trait. The shinbone, or tibia, is relatively straight, slightly curving inwards. To below, its shaft progressively flattens from front to rear, resulting in a generally oval cross-section. For about an eighth of its length the front lower end of the shaft is covered by a vertical branch of the astragalus. Of the foot, only the second, third and fourth metatarsals are known, the bone elements that were connected to the three weight-bearing toes. They are straight and robust, showing ligament pits at their lower sides. The third metatarsal has no clear condyles at its lower end, resulting in a more flexible joint, allowing for a modicum of horizontal movement. The top inner side of the third metatarsal carries a unique ridge that fits into a groove along the top outer side of the second metatarsal, causing a tighter connection.|$|E

25|$|In {{the lower}} leg, the {{anterior}} tibial enters the <b>extensor</b> compartment near the upper {{border of the}} interosseus membrane to descend between the tibialis anterior and the <b>extensor</b> hallucis longus. Distal to the superior and <b>extensor</b> retinacula of the foot it becomes the dorsal artery of the foot. The posterior tibial forms a direct continuation of the popliteal artery which enters the flexor compartment of the lower leg to descend behind the medial malleolus where it divides into the medial and lateral plantar arteries, of which the posterior branch {{gives rise to the}} fibular artery.|$|E

Usually the thumb <b>extensor</b> is fixed to the <b>extensor</b> retinaculum and the CMC1 joint is arthrodesed/fused in the right position.|$|E
25|$|Three of the {{anterior}} muscles are extensors. From its origin on the lateral {{surface of the}} tibia and the interosseus membrane, the three-sided belly of the tibialis anterior extends down below the superior and inferior <b>extensor</b> retinacula to its insertion on the plantar side of the medial cuneiform bone and the first metatarsal bone. In the non-weight-bearing leg, {{the anterior}} tibialis dorsal flexes the foot and lifts the medial edge of the foot. In the weight-bearing leg, it pulls the leg towards the foot. The <b>extensor</b> digitorum longus has a wide origin stretching from the lateral condyle of the tibia down along the anterior side of the fibula, and the interosseus membrane. At the ankle, the tendon divides into four that stretch across the foot to the dorsal aponeuroses of the last phalanges of the four lateral toes. In the non-weight-bearing leg, the muscle extends the digits and dorsiflexes the foot, and in the weight-bearing leg acts similar to the tibialis anterior. The <b>extensor</b> hallucis longus has its origin on the fibula and the interosseus membrane between the two other extensors and is, similarly to the <b>extensor</b> digitorum, is inserted on the last phalanx of big toe ("hallux"). The muscle dorsiflexes the hallux, and acts similar to the tibialis anterior in the weight-bearing leg.|$|E

Objective: The {{aim of the}} study was to assess the effect of six weeks training program with GUN-eX system on isometric trunk strenght and isokinetic upper body limbs strenght. Methods: It was an experimental study with two groups of volunteers. Experimental group was consists of 8 persons (6 men and 2 women) in an average age of 25 ± 2 years. Control group was consist of 8 persons too (6 men and 2 women) in average age of 28 ± 7 years. Experimental group participated in six weeks strength training program with GUN-eX ropes and control group did not participate in this program.

40|$|Graduation date: 2014 The {{ability to}} quickly {{generate}} torque of the triple <b>extensors</b> is critical during rapid movements, {{especially when there}} is not enough time to reach peak torque. Rate of torque development (RTD), which is the rate of rise of the torque-time curve, is a commonly used measure of rapid torque generation. However, the relationship between RTD of the triple <b>extensors</b> at different time intervals has yet to be investigated. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the relationship between RTD of the triple <b>extensors</b> at different time intervals (0 - 25, 0 - 50, 0 - 100, 0 - 150, 0 - 200 and 0250 ms). Thirty healthy, recreationally active volunteers (15 females, 15 males) participated in the study. In order to assess RTD of the triple <b>extensors,</b> isometric hip extension, knee extension, and plantarflexion torque-time curves of the dominant limb were recorded using a Biodex System 3 dynamometer. During the first 50 ms, the correlations were very similar among all three muscle groups. However, after that time period, the relationships between the muscle groups diverged. While relationships of RTD of the KE and plantarflexors (PF) remained consistent across all the time intervals, relationships of RTD of the hip <b>extensors</b> (HE) and knee <b>extensors</b> (KE) was highest at the 0 - 50 ms time interval and then lowered at the later time intervals. In addition, relationships of RTD of the HE and PF increased up to the 0100 ms time interval and then was lower after that time interval. This suggests that the KE and PF exhibited the similar pattern of rapid torque production while the HE exhibited the different pattern of rapid torque production compared to the other two primary triple <b>extensors...</b>|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were: a) to {{investigate}} differences in muscle thickness (MT) measured by ultrasound and muscle quality (MQ) at three sites in the elbow flexors and knee <b>extensors,</b> and b) to correlate MT with isometric force production of the elbow flexors and knee <b>extensors.</b> Sixty-nine young male subjects participated in this study. The isometric force production values of the elbow flexors and knee <b>extensors</b> were obtained at 90 ° and 60 °, respectively. MT was assessed at three sites in the elbow flexors (proximal – BB 1, middle – BB 2, and distal – BB 3) and knee <b>extensors</b> (proximal – RI 1, middle – RI 2, and distal – RI 3). Differences between the three measurements of MT and MQ were evaluated by one-way repeated measures ANOVA. Pearson’s correlation {{test was used to}} assess the correlation between MT and isometric force. The level of significance was set at p< 0. 05. The results showed significant differences (p< 0. 001) between the three MT and MQ sites in the elbow flexors (BB 1, BB 2, BB 3) and in the knee <b>extensors</b> (RI 1, RI 2, RI 3). The correlation between BB 1, BB 2 and BB 3 and force production was r= 0. 57, r= 0. 52 and r= 0. 59, respectively (p< 0. 05).
