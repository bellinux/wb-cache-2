50|$|The Sport had a {{lightweight}} welded steel construction fuselage. The wings employed two solid wood spars each, with spruce leading edges. All structures were fabric covered. Only the lower wing had ailerons and only they were mounted with a moderate upward angle (dihedral); a typical arrangement. The {{conventional landing gear}} was rigid and relied on large balloon tires to absorb impacts. The spring steel tailskid came from a <b>front</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> from a Ford Model T. The sport had an open single-seat cockpit with a one-piece transparent windscreen. The prototype was fitted with a 19 hp Chevrolet 4-cylinder water-cooled automobile engine.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1970 In the {{construction}} of a cab-over-engine semi tractor, Freightliner Corporation of Portland, Oregon uses brackets to make the connection between the <b>front</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> mounts, bumper, front hinges for the tilt-cab and the longitudinal frame rails. One bracket is used on each side. The integrity of these brackets is essential to the safe operation of the truck. This investigation was undertaken to make an estimate of the stress levels in some special brackets during the various possible load combinations which simulate actual operation. This estimate will be used to justify further more precise measurements of the stresses in the brackets. The geometry of the brackets was too complex to use analytical methods and, also, the prototypes were not available. Quarter scale photoelastic models were built from laminated sheets of epoxy. This kind of model enables one to detect flat plate bending as well as in-plane tension and compression stresses with a reflection polariscope. After the critical load combination was determined from these models, a second model was prepared and stress frozen to determine the magnitude and location of the maximum stress occurring in the bracket. Dimensional analysis was used to relate the model properties to the prototype. The results of this investigation indicated that stress levels higher than the yield strength of the material would occur in the right-hand bracket when braking during a right turn. Strain gages should be applied at the point of maximum stress so that the actual stress in the bracket can be measured for this particular loading condition...|$|E
40|$|The {{condition}} of the roads is a factor that may not only affect the wear of a vehicle, car or truck, but as well may reduce fuel consumption, increase comfort, lower noise and maybe most importantly increase traffic safety. This gives a need {{of a system that}} can measure road quality and detect potholes, which could be of interest to haulers and to local road authorities that would get valuable information of road sections that are in need of maintenance. In this Master Thesis different algorithms were developed, and tested, that could automatically detect different kind of road anomalies using only an three-axis accelerometer mounted on the chassis of heavy duty trucks from Scania. Data collection was performed using two different trucks and the road anomalies were noted by the co-driver using the keyboard of a laptop. This Master Thesis also explored the correlation between the acceleration levels on the chassis and high elongation values on the <b>front</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>spring.</b> Using a developed evaluation framework, the anomaly detections from the different algorithms were compared to the test oracle to determine if the anomaly detection given by the algorithm was a true positive hit or a false positive. A great advantage of the developed evaluation framework is that additional algorithms could easily be added for evaluation. For the evaluation of the algorithms the statistical F-measure, which is the harmonic mean of the precision and sensitivity, was used for the test’s accuracy of the algorithms. The two algorithms that had the best performance results regarding detection of road anomalies were Algorithm – T and Algorithm – SDT. These two algorithms had a F-measure score of 65 % and 64 % respectively when the precision and sensitivity were equally weighted. For the correlation between acceleration levels and high elongation levels, Algorithm – SDT scored the highest F-measure value of 14 %. This value is far from satisfying and a reason for the low value is that the algorithms were primarily developed for detection of road anomalies...|$|E
2500|$|Most models had {{a ladder}} frame with three live axles, the <b>front</b> on <b>leaf</b> <b>springs,</b> the rear tandem <b>leaf</b> <b>springs</b> with {{locating}} arms. The exception was the crane truck, {{which had a}} walking beam rear suspension for stability.|$|R
50|$|During {{the winter}} of 1973-74, five AWD GAZ-24-95s were built. It used a UAZ {{transfer}} case, with a heavily modified floorpan. The front axle ended up being a Volga rear axle turned backwards, attached to UAZ joints for the steering, with <b>front</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>springs</b> (on stronger frame rails, to carry the greater load). The sump also had to be modified. In all, the changes added 90 kg. Some disadvantages were discovered during the tests and this modification remained experimental. One survives in the GAZ plant's museum, another perhaps in private hands in Nizhny Novgorod.|$|R

50|$|By {{the late}} 1950s, Ford wanted {{to reduce its}} {{marketing}} spend on supplementary brands, and appeal to a wider number of car buyers. They commissioned a team to create what by American standards of the time a small car, but {{elsewhere in the world}} would be considered a mid-size car. With room for six passengers in reasonable comfort, to keep the price down Copp engineered a unibody, keeping suspension standard and sourced from Ford's existing parts bin: coil <b>springs</b> in <b>front,</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>springs</b> in the rear, drum brakes all round. It was powered by a small, lightweight 90 hp (67 kW), 144 CID (2.4 L) straight-6 with a single-barrel carburettor. A three-speed manual column shift was standard with the two-speed Ford-O-Matic automatic optionally available.|$|R

40|$|Matching {{method of}} heavy truck-rear air {{suspensions}} is discussed, and a fuzzy control strategy which improves both ride comfort and road friendliness of truck by adjusting damping coefficients of {{the suspension system}} is found. In the first place, a Dongfeng EQ 1141 G 7 DJ heavy truck’s ten DOF whole vehicle-road model was set up based on Matlab/Simulink and vehicle dynamics. Then appropriate passive air suspensions were chosen to replace the original rear <b>leaf</b> <b>springs</b> of the truck according to truck-suspension matching criterions, consequently, the stiffness of <b>front</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>springs</b> were adjusted too. Then the semi-active fuzzy controllers were designed for further enhancement of the truck’s ride comfort and the road friendliness. After the application of semi-active fuzzy control strategy through simulation, is was indicated that both ride comfort and road friendliness could be enhanced effectively under various road conditions. The strategy proposed may provide theory basis for design and development of truck suspension system in China...|$|R

5000|$|The Phantom VI was {{the last}} Rolls-Royce with a {{separate}} chassis. It featured coil <b>springs</b> in <b>front,</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>springs</b> and live axle in rear, and drum brakes on all four wheels. The car was powered by a [...] 90 degree V8 with a bore of 104 mm and stroke of 91.5 mm with twin SU carburettors, coupled to a 4-speed automatic gearbox. In a 1979 upgrade, engine capacity was increased to , a 3-speed automatic gearbox with torque converter was substituted, and separate front and rear air conditioning units were provided. Inclusion of the engine from the Rolls-Royce Silver Spirit in 1982 increased engine displacement once more, to 6,750 cc. In 1990 the last Rolls-Royce Phantom VI chassis were built, however as {{the completion of the}} actual car by Mulliner Park Ward (the erection of the body) took around 18 months the last cars were made in the period of the next two years. The very last Rolls-Royce Phantom VI, coincidentally also the last Landaulette body, was completed and delivered to the customer in summer of 1992.|$|R
