50|$|An {{intervening}} cause {{is an event}} that occurs after a tortfeasor's initial act of negligence and causes injury/harm to a victim.

A superseding cause is an unforeseeable intervening cause. By contrast, a foreseeable intervening cause typically does not break the chain of causality, meaning that the tortfeasor is still responsible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim's</b> injury—unless <b>the</b> event leads to an unforeseeable result.|$|R
