5|$|On December 17, Sony {{canceled}} the New York City premiere. Later that day, other major theater chains including AMC, Cinemark, Cineplex, Regal and Southern Theatres either delayed or canceled screenings of the film. The chains reportedly came {{under pressure from}} the malls where many theaters are located, which feared that the terror threat would harm their holiday sales. They also feared expensive lawsuits <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> attack; Cinemark, for instance, contended that it could not have foreseen the 2012 Aurora shooting, which took place at one of its multiplexes, a defense that would not hold <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> attack at a screening of The Interview.|$|E
5|$|The type's first fatal {{accident}} occurred on 30 June 1994 near Toulouse {{on a test}} flight when an Airbus-owned A330-300 crashed while simulating an engine failure on climbout, killing all seven on board. Airbus subsequently advised A330 operators to disconnect the autopilot and limit pitch attitude <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> engine failure at low speed.|$|E
5|$|As Upper Canada's administrator, Brock made {{a series}} of changes to prepare for war. He amended the militia act to allow use of all {{available}} volunteers and ordered enhanced training of these raw recruits, despite opposition from the provincial legislature. He continued strengthening and reinforcing defences. Brock also began seeking out First Nations leaders, such as the Shawnee chief Tecumseh, to build alliances with him against the Americans in the event of war. Although the conventional wisdom of the day was that Canada would fall quickly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> invasion, Brock pursued these strategies to give the colony a fighting chance.|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{protection}} <b>of</b> cultural property <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> armed conflicts has become largely mentioned issue. Despite broad international legal codification of principles to prevent destruction <b>of</b> cultural property <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> armed conflicts, destruction of cultural property obviously occurs. Within discussion on their protection, attention {{is not so}} paid {{to the values of}} cultural property representing for interested actors not merely <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> armed conflicts. Attention is not much paid also to the motivations leading actors to destroy cultural property <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> armed conflicts. <b>The</b> thesis is based on current state of knowledge both in academic or international law and it focuses on exploring motivations leading actors to destroy cultural property <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> armed conflicts. To answer the research question: "What motivators are leading actors to actively destroy cultural monuments in armed conflicts?" is proceeded from analysis of literature that expounds the motivations for the destruction <b>of</b> cultural property <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> armed conflicts. These motivations will be understood as theoretical explanations of destruction {{for the purposes of the}} work, and on the basis of five case studies, their validity will be checked.

5|$|Billy Smith of the New York Islanders, in the 1979–80 season, was {{the first}} goaltender to be {{credited}} with a goal in the NHL when Rob Ramage of the Colorado Rockies put the puck into his own empty net. Smith was the last Islander to have touched the puck, and by NHL rule 78.4, an unassisted goal is awarded to the last player on the scoring team who had contacted the puck, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> own goal.|$|E
5|$|Crew-only or cargo-only supply {{missions}} {{would have}} been launched aboard a Titan II, and the Saturn I or Saturn IB {{would have been}} used for the combined crew and cargo spacecraft. Because of the increased power of the Saturn I, the Gemini spacecraft's ejection seats {{would not have been able}} to propel the crew far enough <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> explosion, so a launch escape tower was proposed, based on the one used on the Mercury spacecraft. The Titan IIIM was also considered to launch the heavier spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|Fairbanks {{received}} {{word of the}} attack on Pearl Harbor via civilian shortwave radio operators who passed the news to the U.S. Army base. More than 200 civil defense volunteers immediately signed up for work that included orchestrating a town blackout, blocking town airfields, and making emergency plans to evacuate the town <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> attack. In June 1942, the invasion of the Aleutian Islands and the bombing of Dutch Harbor intensified the war's effect on Fairbanks. Ladd Field's cold-weather testing detachment was disbanded as its soldiers were used to bolster Alaska defenses at other locations.|$|E

5|$|GM {{recommends}} that a Volt battery fire be fought with water rather than dry chemicals, and rates the Volt battery as having no explosion or electrocution hazard {{as the result}} of a collision. The high-voltage system is designed to shut down automatically <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> airbag deployment, and to detect a loss of communication from an airbag control module. During the Volt development the lithium-ion battery pack was subjected to a wide range of tests, including overcharge, discharge, vibration, excessive heat and cold, short circuit, humidity, fire, crush, water immersion, salt water immersion, and nail penetration.|$|E
5|$|In March 1794, {{perhaps in}} {{response}} to Shelby's concerns, Congress passed a measure granting the government additional powers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> invasion or insurrection. Jefferson's successor Edmund Randolph, who actually received Shelby's letter, wrote Shelby to inform him of the new powers at his disposal, and informing him that the new regime in France had recalled Genêt. Two months later Genêt's agents ceased their operations in Kentucky and the potential crisis was averted. In 1795, President Washington negotiated {{an agreement with the}} Spanish that secured the right of Americans to trade on the river.|$|E
5|$|It {{is still}} {{possible}} to lose all three hydraulic systems if serious damage occurs elsewhere, as nearly happened to a cargo airliner in 2002 during takeoff when a main gear tire exploded in the wheel well area. The damage in the left wing area caused total fluid loss from the number 1 and the number 2 hydraulic systems. The number 3 system was dented but not penetrated.

5|$|Jane's {{reported}} in 2002 that Iraqi intelligence had found classified documents {{in his home}} about a U.S. attack on Iraq. When they raided the house, fighting broke out between Abu Nidal's men and Iraqi intelligence. In the midst of this, Abu Nidal rushed into his bedroom and was killed; Palestinian sources told Jane's {{that he had been}} shot several times. Jane's suggested Saddam Hussein had him killed because he feared Abu Nidal would act against him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> American invasion.|$|E
5|$|Naval and {{defensive}} technology continued to improve {{over the next}} few decades, rendering Tilbury Fort's bastion design out-moded. The government considered the defences further down the Thames to be sufficient and Tilbury was therefore not improved; it was largely redundant as a defensive fortification {{by the end of the}} century, although still in use as a strategic depot. From 1889 onwards it formed a mobilisation centre to support a mobile strike force <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> invasion, part of the wider London Defence Scheme, and large storage buildings were built across the site to store materiel.|$|E
5|$|New York Governor George Pataki urged {{residents}} to purchase emergency supplies and to fill cars with gasoline. The State Emergency Management Office began {{preparing for the}} hurricane about a week before it moved ashore. The office also issued a Level 1 emergency activation, with a planning unit readying contingency plans and in coordinating the efforts of other state offices. The state's National Guard began preliminary preparations for possible support efforts by reviewing the list of personnel able to be mobilized <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> emergency. Army and Air National Guard officials identified needed equipment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> emergency, such as helicopters, generators, high-axle vehicles, and communications equipment. State police officers established contingency plans for personnel and equipment to assist as needed. The State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation ensured needed equipment were operational, and also secured buildings with sandbags to prevent flooding. Seven airlines allowed travelers potentially affected by the hurricane to reschedule their flights to a later date.|$|E

50|$|A {{potential}} technical hurdle with in-memory {{data storage}} is the volatility <b>of</b> RAM. Specifically <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> a power loss, intentional or otherwise, data stored in volatile RAM is lost.

5|$|Rural non-Interstate {{highways}} {{are particularly}} risky. Most are two-lane non-divided highways built to lower standards than Interstate highways. Drivers are often drunk and not wearing seat belts. Speeding is common.

5|$|Ship's {{regulations}} {{were designed to}} keep third class passengers confined to their area of the ship. The Titanic was fitted with grilles to prevent the classes from mingling and these gates were normally kept closed, although the stewards could open them <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> emergency. In the rush following the collision, the stewards, occupied with waking up sleeping passengers and leading groups {{of women and children}} to the boat deck, did not have time to open all the gates, leaving many of the confused third class passengers stuck below decks.|$|E

5|$|Soyuz {{spacecraft}} provided manned {{access to}} and from the station allowing for crew rotations and cargo return, and also functioned as a lifeboat for the station, allowing for a relatively quick return to Earth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> emergency. Two models of Soyuz flew to Mir; Soyuz T-15 was the only Igla-equipped Soyuz-T to visit the station, whilst all other flights used the newer, Kurs-equipped Soyuz-TM. A total of 31 (30 manned, 1 unmanned) Soyuz spacecraft flew to the station over a fourteen-year period.|$|E
5|$|The 767 is {{equipped}} with three redundant hydraulic systems for operation of control surfaces, landing gear, and utility actuation systems. Each engine powers a separate hydraulic system, and the third system uses electric pumps. A ram air turbine provides power for basic controls <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> emergency. An early form of fly-by-wire is employed for spoiler operation, utilizing electric signaling instead of traditional control cables. The fly-by-wire system reduces weight and allows independent operation of individual spoilers.|$|E
