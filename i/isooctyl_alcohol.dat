40|$|Several organic {{solvents}} {{were examined}} as potential separating agents for ethanol recovery from aqueous solutions by liquid-liquid extraction. Phase composition determinations for five promising ethanol-water-solvent systems at 20 and 40 째C and two solvent-to-feed ratios show that isoamyl acetate (IAA) and <b>isooctyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> (IOA) along with n-butyl acetate (BA) present a greater potential than dibutyl ether and dibutyl oxalate. Tie-line liquid-liquid equilibrium data at 25 째C {{for the three}} promising solvents (IAA, IOA, and BA) were collected and analyzed. Both IAA and IOA {{were found to be}} very good separating agents, exhibiting ethanol distribution coefficients greater than 1, and separation factors in Bancroft coordinates of the order of 70 and 2000, respectively.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{well-defined}} poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) -b-poly(isooctylacrylate) (PIOA) -b-PMMA triblock copolymers (MIM) has been synthesized by transalcoholysis of PMMA-b-poly(tert-butylacrylate) (PtBA) -b-PMMA precursors (MTM) by <b>isooctyl</b> <b>alcohol.</b> Phase separation is observed {{for all the}} investigated triblock copolymers, thus containing PMMA outer blocks in the 3500 - 50, 000 molecular weight (MW) range and PIOA inner block with MW in the 100, 000 - 300, 000 range. The ultimate tensile properties of these MIM triblock copolymers are poor even when PMMA blocks of 50, 000 MW are associated with an inner PIOA block of 300, 000 MW. A reasonable explanation should {{be found in the}} molecular weight between chain entanglements (Me), which has been estimated at 60, 000 for PIOA, much higher than Me for the traditional polydiene central blocks in the well-known thermoplastic elastomers of the triblock type. The tensile behavior of MIM copolymers has been successfully accounted for by a simple elastomer model free from chain entanglements, supporting the view that the lack of entanglements in the central block is very detrimental to the mechanical properties of the investigated fully (meth) acrylate triblock copolymers.
