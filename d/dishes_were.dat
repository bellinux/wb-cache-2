5|$|Controversy arose {{when the}} star was first awarded. It has {{received}} mixed reviews from food critics both while {{in its current}} incarnation, and while it was run by head chef Marcus Wareing. It was felt that the <b>dishes</b> <b>were</b> sometimes overcomplicated, and designed primarily to gain Michelin stars. The restaurant was named after the French wine Pétrus.|$|E
5|$|In January 2012, {{four people}} were accidentally {{poisoned}} when death caps (reportedly misidentified as straw fungi, which are popular in Chinese and other Asian <b>dishes)</b> <b>were</b> served at a New Year's Eve dinner party in Canberra, Australia. All the victims required hospital treatment {{and two of}} them died, with a third requiring a liver transplant.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, {{fried chicken}} has stereotypically been {{associated}} with African-Americans. The reasons for this are various. Chicken <b>dishes</b> <b>were</b> popular among slaves before the Civil War, as chickens were generally the only animals slaves were allowed to raise on their own. Minstrel shows and the film The Birth of a Nation led to a prevalent stereotype associating African-Americans with fried chicken.|$|E

5000|$|Rost is {{a famous}} Bengali dish {{originating}} in Bangladesh. The <b>dish</b> <b>is</b> {{influenced by the}} Persian cuisine {{left behind by the}} Mughal Empire. The <b>dish</b> <b>is</b> known for including a large array of spices and ingredients and being a little sweet and very rich. The <b>dish</b> <b>is</b> made during almost all celebratory times in Bengal especially during Eid al-Fitr where it <b>is</b> an important <b>dish</b> always included, however, the <b>dish</b> <b>is</b> made anytime important guests are coming over. The <b>dish</b> <b>is</b> very popularly made in restaurants in Dhaka, Rajshahi and Bogra.|$|R

5|$|The {{restaurant}} carriages of the NSS {{were open}} to everyone, but dining was so expensive that only passengers travelling in first class used the service. Usually, three or four <b>dishes</b> <b>were</b> offered in the restaurant carriages. A four-course dinner cost five Norwegian kroner in the 1920s, which was expensive at the time. Warm dishes, such as soups and sauces, were usually prepared at a small stove in the restaurant carriage's kitchen. On busy days, prepared steaks were delivered from rail depots. The kitchens were staffed by two maids and one attendant. Blocks of ice were often used instead of refrigerators.|$|E
5|$|Tracey Macleod ate at Pétrus for The Independent {{shortly after}} {{it opened in}} 1999. She thought that certain touches would impress the Michelin inspectors, and that the <b>dishes</b> <b>were</b> {{suitably}} elaborate. Jay Rayner visited the restaurant whilst {{it was at the}} Bekerley Hotel in 2003 for The Observer. He thought that the menu was over complicated, and not all the elements of the dishes worked together. Gillian Glover of The Scotsman thought in 2005 that some of the food served was forgettable, but stand out elements included frog leg lolipops which came with her main course of baked seabass with garlic puree.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the move}} to the Le Méridien Piccadilly Hotel, the menu and wine list were {{expanded}} once more. White sought to have a far wider range of wine than at other three Michelin star restaurants; one example given was that while a different restaurant might have four or five bottles of Pétrus, the Oak Room list had more than 70 different vintages. There was a collection of Château d'Yquem listed over five pages going back to 1850. By November 1997, the wine cellar was valued at £1.5 million, with an average weekly taking on wine alone between £25,000 and £30,000. The menu was changed to include more table service, such as meat carvings. The other courses and side <b>dishes</b> <b>were</b> carried from the kitchen on silver platters. The idea that this would provide entertainment for all diners, {{even if they did}} not order a course with table service.|$|E

5|$|Visual display was prized. Brilliant {{colors were}} {{obtained}} by the addition of, for example, juices from spinach and the green part of leeks. Yellow came from saffron or egg yolk, while red came from sunflower, and purple came from Crozophora tinctoria or Heliotropium europaeum. Gold and silver leaf were placed on food surfaces and brushed with egg whites. Elaborate and showy <b>dishes</b> <b>were</b> the result, such as tourte parmerienne which was a pastry dish {{made to look like}} a castle with chicken-drumstick turrets coated with gold leaf. One of the grandest showpieces of the time was roast swan or peacock sewn back into its skin with feathers intact, the feet and beak being gilded. Since both birds are stringy, and taste unpleasant, the skin and feathers could be kept and filled with the cooked, minced and seasoned flesh of tastier birds, like goose or chicken.|$|E

50|$|The <b>dish</b> <b>is</b> {{consumed}} {{in most parts}} of El Salvador but is most common in the western and central parts of the country.

25|$|While Ashkenazi cuisine as it {{is known}} today is largely based within the context of American-Jewish and Ashkenazi-Israeli food, much of the culinary {{tradition}} of Ashkenazi Jews springs from Central and Eastern Europe. After having been expelled from Western Europe in the Middle Ages, Jews were forced to live in poverty and thus were limited in terms of ingredients. <b>Dishes</b> <b>were</b> made with fewer components; they weren't heavily spiced and ingredients that were more flavorful had to be used sparingly. This is often why some dishes in Ashkenazic cuisine are known for being blander than dishes in Sephardic or Mizrahi cuisine.|$|E
50|$|Side <b>dishes</b> <b>are</b> usually boiled, fried or mashed potatoes, {{buckwheat}} kasha, rice or pasta. Meat <b>dishes</b> <b>are</b> frequently {{served with}} bliny or draniki stacked in round clay pots.|$|R

25|$|Banquets (궁중 연회 음식) {{were held}} on special {{occasions}} in the Korean Royal Palace. These included birthdays {{of the royal family}} members, marriages, and national festivals, including Daeborum, Dano, Chuseok, and Dongji. Banquet food was served on individual tables which varied according to the rank of the person. Usually banquet food consisted of ten different types of dishes. Main <b>dishes</b> <b>were</b> prepared based on the seasonal foods. Main dishes of the banquet included sinseollo, jeon, hwayang jeok, honghapcho, nengmyun and mulgimchi. A typical banquet ingredient was chogyetang (chicken broth with vinegar), which was prepared with five different chickens, five abalones, ten sea cucumbers, twenty eggs, half a bellflower root, mushrooms, two cups of black pepper, two peeled pine nuts, starch, soy sauce and vinegar. Yaksik was a favorite banquet dessert.|$|E
25|$|Non-bioluminescent fireflies use pheromones {{to signal}} mates. This is {{supported}} by the fact that some basal groups do not show bioluminescence and use chemical signaling, instead. Phosphaenus hemipterus has photic organs, yet is a diurnal firefly and displays large antennae and small eyes. These traits strongly suggest pheromones are used for sexual selection, while photic organs are used for warning signals. In controlled experiments, males coming from downwind arrived at females first, indicating males travel upwind along a pheromone plume. Males were also found {{to be able to find}} females without the use of visual cues, when the sides of test Petri <b>dishes</b> <b>were</b> covered with black tape. This and the facts that females do not light up at night and males are diurnal point to the conclusion that sexual communication in P. hemipterus is based entirely on pheromones.|$|E
25|$|Many Singaporean Chinese <b>dishes</b> <b>were</b> {{adapted by}} early Chinese {{immigrants}} to suit local circumstances (such as available ingredients) and cannot strictly be considered mainstream Chinese cuisine. Nevertheless, these dishes exhibited local Singaporean Chinese flavours and tastes. Most local Singaporean Chinese {{dishes such as}} Bak kut teh, Mee pok, Ban mian, Char kway teow, Chee cheong fun, Hokkien mee, Hainanese chicken rice, Wan ton mee, and Popiah can still be easily found in food centres throughout Singapore. Some Singaporean Chinese are vegetarians, {{as they may be}} devoted followers of Buddhism. With the influx of new migrants from all parts of China in the 21st century, Chinese cuisine of a variety of regional flavours and tastes can be found across Chinese restaurants in Chinatown, Singapore or in other regions of Singapore, such as Sichuanese cuisine, northeastern Chinese cuisine etc.|$|E
50|$|Dating back to Mughal India, zarda had a {{variation}} with an addition of small fried meat pieces called 'Mutanjan'. This <b>dish</b> <b>was</b> a favourite of Emperor Shahjahan and was often made on his request. This rice <b>dish</b> <b>was</b> made for guests at special banquets. This <b>dish</b> <b>is</b> still eaten {{to this date}} in parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in Pakistan.|$|R
50|$|The {{traditional}} way to eat this dish, follows two steps. First a bite {{from the outside}} of the <b>dish</b> <b>is</b> dipped into the central hole with syrup. This is continued until the edge of the hole is breached. After the breach the <b>dish</b> <b>is</b> mixed and continued until finished. Because of this playful eating style the <b>dish</b> <b>is</b> popular among children.|$|R
50|$|There are {{approximately}} six hundred dishes available in Mei family’s cuisine, {{and none of}} the <b>dishes</b> <b>are</b> flavored heavily, and each <b>dish</b> <b>is</b> not large in term of size. Another important characteristic of Mei family’s cuisine <b>is</b> that <b>dishes</b> <b>are</b> seasonal because ingredients used is harvested according to the season, and cooking methods used also varies according to seasonal change of weather.|$|R
25|$|The 600 Brandenburg {{soldiers}} {{were allowed to}} leave Aachen with their flags and were replaced by 1,200 Catholic Germans under the Count of Emden. Although the soldiers of the Spanish army, {{after several years of}} inactivity following the beginning of the Twelve Years' Truce (in 1609) with the Dutch Republic, expected to sack the city, Spinola forbade any looting and Spanish troops did not enter the town. The Catholic city council was restored, and, on 10 September, it issued an edict which gave the Protestant preachers three days to abandon the town, and six weeks for the non-citizen Anabaptists and other foreigners to do the same. From then on, only Catholic schools and schoolmasters were tolerated, books labeled as heretics were banned, meat <b>dishes</b> <b>were</b> not allowed to be eaten in inns on the fast days, and a fitting homage was to be paid to the Holy Sacrament and relics when public processions were held. The people {{who took part in the}} 1611 rebellion were punished: in 1616 two ringleaders were executed, more than one hundred citizens who participated in the disturbances were exiled, and others were forced to pay a fine.|$|E
25|$|By 1980, {{satellite}} television was well {{established in the}} USA and Europe. On April 26, 1982, the first satellite channel in the UK, Satellite Television Ltd. (later Sky1), was launched. Its signals were transmitted from the ESA's Orbital Test Satellites. Between 1981 and 1985, TVRO systems' sales rates increased as prices fell. Advances in receiver technology {{and the use of}} Gallium Arsenide FET technology enabled the use of smaller dishes. 500,000 systems, some costing as little as $2000, were sold in the US in 1984. Dishes pointing to one satellite were even cheaper. People in areas without local broadcast stations or cable television service could obtain good-quality reception with no monthly fees. The large <b>dishes</b> <b>were</b> a subject of much consternation, as many people considered them eyesores, and in the US most condominiums, neighborhoods, and other homeowner associations tightly restricted their use, except in areas where such restrictions were illegal. These restrictions were altered in 1986 when the Federal Communications Commission ruled all of them illegal. A municipality could require a property owner to relocate the dish if it violated other zoning restrictions, such as a setback requirement, but could not outlaw their use. The necessity of these restrictions would slowly decline as the dishes got smaller.|$|E
25|$|Records {{show that}} her visiting guests were entertained with the {{following}} fowl: waxwings, fieldfares, snow bunting, hazel grouse, partridges, black grouse, capercaillies and the forest game: loach, trouts, grayling, salmon fresh and smoked, flounders, salted herring, lampreys in vinegar, oysters, snails, and Genoese pâté, not to mention fresh fruit and chestnuts. French and Italian wines were served, as well as mead and local beers. The <b>dishes</b> <b>were</b> made only according to French recipes. The royal court with all its innovations exerted a broad influence {{over the rest of}} aristocratic residences and noble palaces across Poland. French cuisine was in fashion and many families willingly employed French cooks and pâté makers. In the mid-18th century on Polish tables appeared the French champagne. Also, among the most influential in that period were Lithuanian, Jewish, German and Hungarian cuisine, not to mention Armenian, which arrived in Poland before the 17th century along with many settlers especially in the south-eastern part of the Commonwealth. Signature dishes of the Western Asia reached Polish tables thanks to the Armenian trade and cultural exchange with Poland's neighbor - the Ottoman Empire. Rare delicacies were brought to royal court as gifts from sultans and royal envoys. The strongest influences were noted in the cities of Lwów, Kraków, Kamieniec Podolski and Zamość due to many Armenians living there permanently. Also, because of the close contact with the Ottoman Empire, coffee (kawa) and boza became popular.|$|E
