The name is the marker SN followed by the year of discovery, suffixed with a one or two-letter designation.

Hence, for example, SN2003C designates the third supernova reported in the year 2003. The last supernova of 2005 was SN2005nc, indicating {{that it was the}} 367th supernova found in 2005. Since 2000, professional and amateur astronomers have been finding several hundreds of supernovae each year (572 in 2007, 261 in 2008, 390 in 2009; 231 in 2013).|$|E

Sensitively preserving the existing early eighteenth century parkland laid out by Lady Mary Abney and Isaac Watts, he introduced an educational landscape around the perimeter which was open to the public free of charge: a vast arboretum of 2,500 species and varieties, labelled alphabetically <b>from</b> <b>A</b> <b>to</b> <b>Z</b> rather than arranged in a more conventional way. Close to the Abney Park Chapel he also laid out a rosarium to complement the chapel's 'botanical rose windows' (described as 'botanical' owing to their unusual ten-part arrangement, as in the five sepals and five petals of the rose family, or petals of a simple rose including indentations as shown in the White Rose of York). George Loddiges also appears to have influenced the architect William Hosking and client George Collison II in their final choice of Egyptian Revival ornamentation for the main entrance, since the Egyptian-style entrance pylons incorporate the botanical imagery of the Egyptian White Lily or Lotus, a plant introduced into western cultivation by Loddiges Nursery in 1802.|$|E

The second edition of Complex Numbers <b>from</b> <b>A</b> <b>to</b> … <b>Z</b> introduces the reader to this fascinating subject that, {{from the time of}} L.

The reader learns how complex numbers can be used to solve algebraic equations and to understand the geometric interpretation of complex numbers and the operations involving them. The theoretical parts of the book are augmented with rich exercises and problems at various levels of difficulty. Many new problems and solutions have been added in this second edition. A special feature of the book is the last chapter, a selection of outstanding Olympiad and other important mathematical contest problems solved by employing the methods already presented. The book reflects the unique experience of the authors. It distills a vast mathematical literature, most of which is unknown to the western public, and captures the essence of an abundant problem culture. The target audience includes undergraduates, high school students and their teachers, mathematical contestants (such as those training for Olympiads or the W. L.

However, the ratio of distances TZ/TA is also known; hence, Z also lies on a known circle, since Apollonius had shown that a circle {{can be defined as}} the set of points that have a given ratio of distances to two fixed points. (As an aside, this definition is the basis of bipolar coordinates.) Thus, the solutions to Apollonius' problem are the intersections of a line with a circle.|$|R

40|$|Pausanias’ Hellados Periegesis {{has proven}} to be {{difficult}} to group with other ancient works, whether preserved or not. In light of its highly varied subject matter, it is tempting to sort Pausanias together with other authors of miscellanies from the second century AD, like Aelian and Athenaeus. Like the Deipnosophistae and the Varia historia among other works, the Periegesis is a collection of facts, pieces of information and curiosities on various objects and subjects. But it differs in its manner of presenting its material. Pausanias avoids the appearance of random ordering and selecting of the material by creating a ubiquitous yet unobtrusive frame narrative with a strong organising nucleus: a narrative of <b>a</b> tour <b>to</b> the sites and sights of Greece. Obviously, travel normally moves linearly <b>from</b> point <b>A</b> <b>to</b> <b>Z</b> via points B, C, D etc. So does the travel narrated in the Periegesis. The frame narrative provides the work with a topographical thread along which the sites and sights of Greece are noted, and the stories that these elicit, or rather: appear to elicit, are told. However, in the scholarship on the Periegesis only one part of the frame (narrative) of the Periegesis is commonly recognised, viz. the topographical thread, which is a secondary aspect of the frame. The frame narrative itself tends to be overlooked. Though elusive and unobtrusive, the frame narrative of the Periegesis is worth studying. In it we encounter the narrative of a travel through Greece undertaken (mostly) by an impersonal, indefinite travelling persona. This aspect of the frame is indebted to the Periploi. More importantly, in the frame narrative there are numerous first-person statements in which the author-narrator comments on various aspects of the material and on his labour prior to and associated with constructing the text. In the end, the authorial voice comes across as strongly influenced by Herodotean historiography. In this paper I propose to examine the gradual development of the interplay between the ‘I’ and the traveller in the frame narrative, and the place of the Herodotean authorial voice within this peripluic narrative frame...|$|R

Research Methods and Procedures: Secondary analysis of data <b>from</b> the Stanford <b>A</b> <b>TO</b> <b>Z</b> intervention evaluated change in beverage pattern and total energy intake in 118 overweight women (25 to 50 years) who regularly con-sumed SCBs (12 ounces/d) at baseline. At baseline and 2, 6, and 12 months, mean daily beverage intake (SCBs, drink-ing water, non-caloric diet beverages, and nutritious caloric beverages), food composition (macronutrient, water, and fiber content), and total energy intake were estimated using three 24 -hour diet recalls. Beverage intake was expressed in relative terms (percentage of beverages). Results: In fixed effects models that controlled for total beverage intake, non-caloric and nutritious caloric beverage intake (percentage of beverages), food composition, and energy expenditure [metabolic equivalent (MET) ], replac-ing SCBs with drinking water was associated with signifi-cant decreases in total energy intake that were sustained over time. The caloric deficit attributable to replacing SCBs with water was not negated by compensatory increases in other food or beverages. Replacing all SCBs with drinking water was associated with a predicted mean decrease in total energy of 200 kcal/d over 12 months. Discussion: The results suggest that replacing SCBs with drinking water can help lower total energy intake in over-weight consumers of SCBs motivated to diet.
