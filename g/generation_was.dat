5|$|An {{enumeration}} technique {{based on}} band <b>generation</b> <b>was</b> developed that is significantly less computationally intensive. The strategy begins {{by analyzing the}} permutations of the top band used in valid solutions. Once the Band1 symmetries and equivalence class for the partial solutions are identified, the completions of the lower two bands are constructed and counted for each equivalence class.|$|E
5|$|In Canada {{the third}} season of Degrassi: The Next <b>Generation</b> <b>was</b> the most-watched {{domestic}} drama amongst adults 18 to 49, and the most-watched domestic drama series overall.

40|$|The heat {{generation}} by an electric current flowing through a quantum dot with the dot containing both electron-electron interaction and electron-phonon interaction, is studied. Using the non-equilibrium Keldysh Green's function method, the current-induced heat <b>generation</b> <b>is</b> obtained. We find {{that for a}} small phonon frequency, heat <b>generation</b> <b>is</b> proportional to the current. However, for a large phonon frequency, heat <b>generation</b> <b>is</b> in general qualitatively different from the current. It is non-monotonic with current and many unique and interesting behaviors emerge. The heat <b>generation</b> could <b>be</b> very large in the Coulomb blockade region, in which the current is very small due to the Coulomb blockade effect. On the other hand, in the resonant tunneling region, the heat <b>generation</b> <b>is</b> very small despite a large current, an ideal condition for device operation. In the curve of {{heat generation}} versus the bias, a negative differential of the heat <b>generation</b> <b>is</b> exhibited, although the current is always monotonously increasing with the bias voltage.

5|$|A New <b>Generation</b> <b>was</b> {{made over}} a seven-month period at Nelvana's Toronto facilities, with {{additional}} work handled by Taiwan's Wang Film Productions, and involved several crew {{members who had}} worked on the original Care Bears Movie. Patricia Cullen served as composer, and Los Angeles musicians Dean and Carol Parks worked on the film's six songs. The Samuel Goldwyn Company, the US distributor for the first film, was originally set to release the sequel, but demands from the film's producers caused the company to give up. To the chagrin of Goldwyn's founder, the worldwide distribution rights were then acquired by Hollywood studio Columbia Pictures.|$|E
5|$|A {{critical}} and popular success, {{the second season}} of Degrassi: The Next <b>Generation</b> <b>was</b> the most-watched Canadian drama series for Canada's younger viewers aged two to thirty-four. It was nominated in eight categories at the Gemini Awards, four categories at the Directors Guild of Canada Awards and the National Council on Family Relations Media Awards, and in two categories at the Young Artist Awards. Four episodes were also nominated at the Awards of Excellence Gala, hosted by the Alliance for Children and Television, what recognize quality Canadian childrenâ€™s programming.|$|E
5|$|Another {{aspect of}} the seventh <b>generation</b> <b>was</b> the {{beginning}} of direct competition between dedicated handheld gaming devices, and increasingly powerful PDA/cell phone devices such as the iPhone and iPod Touch, and the latter being aggressively marketed for gaming purposes. Simple games such as Tetris and Solitaire had existed for PDA devices since their introduction, but by 2009 PDAs and phones had grown sufficiently powerful to where complex graphical games could be implemented, with the advantage of distribution over wireless broadband.|$|E
40|$|Schizogonic {{stages of}} asexual {{developmental}} cycles of Eimeria magna experimentally infecting the domestic rabbit, Oryctolagus cuniculus in Saudi Arabia, were described and diagnosed by light and electron microscopy. Five asexual cycles or <b>generations</b> <b>were</b> observed {{mainly in the}} columnar epitheial cells of the small intestinal villi. Two types of mature schizonts in the five <b>generations</b> <b>were</b> described; schizonts type-a (microschizonts) producing small number of large macromerozoites and schizonts type-b (macroschizonts) giving rise to large number of small micromerozoites.

5|$|By the mid-1850s the {{miasma theory}} of disease was largely {{superseded}} by the germ theory of disease, creating extensive interest in microorganisms and {{their interactions with}} other forms of life. By the 1880s, bacteriology was becoming a coherent discipline, especially through the work of Robert Koch, who introduced methods for growing pure cultures on agar gels containing specific nutrients in Petri dishes. The long-held idea that living organisms could easily originate from nonliving matter (spontaneous <b>generation)</b> <b>was</b> attacked {{in a series of}} experiments carried out by Louis Pasteur, while debates over vitalism vs. mechanism (a perennial issue since the time of Aristotle and the Greek atomists) continued apace.|$|E
5|$|In December 2006, Program Partners {{had reached}} {{agreements}} with the Tribune Company for every station it owned, The CW Plus affiliated stations, and many other stations owned by major media conglomerates. Degrassi: The Next <b>Generation</b> <b>was</b> cleared in 60% of the country including all five {{of the top five}} media markets. By March 2007, Program Partners had cleared it in over 70% of the country after stations owned by Hearst-Argyle Television, Capitol Broadcasting Company, and ACME Communications purchased the syndication. The series meets the American FCC's educational and informational guidelines towards children's programming.|$|E
5|$|In September 1913, an International Commission of the European Powers convened to {{determine}} the boundary between Greece and Albania. The delegates of the commission aligned themselves into two camps: those of Italy and Austro-Hungary insisted that the Northern Epirus districts were Albanian, while those of the Triple Entente (the United Kingdom, France, and Russia) took the view that although the older generations in some villages spoke Albanian, the younger <b>generation</b> <b>was</b> Greek in intellectual outlook, sentiment, and aspirations. Under Italian and Austro-Hungarian pressure, the commission determined that the region of Northern Epirus would be ceded to Albania.|$|E

30|$|In {{terms of}} {{equipment}} control and dynamic characteristics of output power, conventional <b>generation</b> <b>is</b> designed to mitigate and ride through grid disturbances, while wind <b>generation</b> <b>is</b> mostly designed not to mitigate grid disturbances and sometimes not to ride through grid disturbances.|$|R
25|$|Tidal power proponents {{point out}} that, unlike wind power systems, <b>generation</b> levels can <b>be</b> {{reliably}} predicted, save for weather effects. While some <b>generation</b> <b>is</b> possible {{for most of}} the tidal cycle, in practice turbines lose efficiency at lower operating rates. Since the power available from a flow is proportional to the cube of the flow speed, the times during which high power <b>generation</b> <b>is</b> possible are brief.|$|R
5|$|In a 2005 study, Felgenhauer and Jarvis {{analyzed}} the permutations {{of the top}} band used in valid solutions. Once the Band1 symmetries and equivalence classes for the partial grid solutions were identified, the completions of the lower two bands were constructed and counted for each equivalence class. Summing completions over the equivalence classes, weighted by class size, gives {{the total number of}} solutions as 6,670,903,752,021,072,936,960, confirming the value obtained by QSCGZ. The value was subsequently confirmed numerous times independently. A second enumeration technique based on band <b>generation</b> <b>was</b> later developed that is significantly less computationally intensive.|$|E
5|$|Malaysia's energy {{infrastructure}} sector is largely dominated by Tenaga Nasional, the largest electric utility company in Southeast Asia, with over RM99.03 billion of assets. Customers {{are connected to}} electricity through the National Grid, with more than 420 transmission substations in the Peninsular linked together by approximately 11,000km of transmission lines operating at 132, 275 and 500 kilovolts. In 2013, Malaysia's total power generation capacity was over 29,728 megawatts. Total electricity <b>generation</b> <b>was</b> 140,985.01 GWh and total electricity consumption was 116,087.51 GWh. Energy production in Malaysia is largely based on oil and natural gas, owing to Malaysia's oil reserves and natural gas reserves, which is the fourth largest in Asia-Pacific after China, India and Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|The Brazilian {{flexible}} fuel car {{is built}} with an ethanol-ready engine and one fuel tank for both fuels. The small gasoline reservoir for {{starting the engine}} with pure ethanol in cold weather, used in earlier ethanol-only vehicles, was kept in {{the first generation of}} Brazilian flexible-fuel cars, mainly for users of the central and southern regions, where winter temperatures normally drop below. An improved flex motor <b>generation</b> <b>was</b> launched in 2009 that allowed for the elimination of this secondary gas reservoir tank.|$|E
40|$|We {{illustrate}} {{the contrast between}} two sources of intergenerational disagreement when <b>generations</b> <b>are</b> overlapping and governments aggregate preferences in a utilitarian manner. Social preferences tend to exhibit a present-bias because <b>generations</b> <b>are</b> imperfectly altruistic about future generations; {{but they tend to}} exhibit a future-bias because coexisting <b>generations</b> <b>are</b> imperfectly altruistic about currently older generations. When the future-bias dominates, society faces an intergenerational equity problem, in which case the present-day government tends to support institutions that enable commitments to lower growth at the expense of future <b>generations.</b> This <b>is</b> so even with perfect altruism about future generations...|$|R

5|$|After the 2002 World Cup, {{the team}} {{weakened}} {{with the loss}} of more veterans and coach Waseige. They missed out five successive major finals from Euro 2004 until Euro 2012, and went through an equal number of head coaches. A 2005 win over reigning European champions Greece meant nothing but a small comfort. In between, a promising new <b>generation</b> <b>was</b> maturing at the 2007 European U-21 Championship; Belgium's squad qualified for the following year's Summer Olympics in Beijing, where the Young Red Devils squad finished fourth. Seventeen of them appeared in the senior national team, albeit without making an immediate impact. Belgium finished in second (and last) place at the Kirin Cup in May 2009, and lost against the 125th FIFA-ranked Armenian team in September 2009.
