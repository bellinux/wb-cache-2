Even the herbivorous giant panda still has the {{digestive system}} of a carnivore, as well as carnivore-specific genes. Its ability to digest cellulose is ascribed to the microbes in its gut. Bears must {{spend much of their}} time feeding in order to gain enough nutrition from foliage. The panda, in particular, spends 12–15 hours a day feeding.|$|E
5|$|For {{most of its}} {{applications}} gas metal {{arc welding}} is a <b>fairly</b> <b>simple</b> welding process to learn requiring no more than a week or two to master basic welding technique. Even when welding is performed by well-trained operators weld quality can fluctuate since it depends on a number of external factors. All GMAW is dangerous, though perhaps less so than some other welding methods, such as shielded metal arc welding.|$|E
40|$|Extended Simple Colored Petri Nets (ESCP-nets) are a {{new class}} of High-level Petri Nets {{conceived}} as a good trade-off between Petri Nets (P-nets) and Colored Petri Nets (CP-nets), to be used in plant simulation. ESCP-nets, while being much more convenient and compact than P-nets, are <b>fairly</b> <b>simpler</b> than CP-nets, thus being more easily implemented and more amenable to formal analysis. Furthermore, they possess some features particularly well-suited to plant simulation. The successful employment of ESCP-nets in an industrial application has confirmed their validity. 1...|$|R

40|$|By {{applying}} the Guo-Lakshmikantham fixed point theorem on high dimensional cones, sufficient conditions {{are given to}} guarantee the existence of positive solutions {{of a system of}} equations of the form x_i(t) =∑_k= 1 ^n∑_j= 1 ^nγ_ij(t) w_ijk(Λ_ijk [x_k]) +(F_ix) (t), t∈[0, 1], i= 1, [...] ., n. Applications are given to three boundary value problems: A 3 -dimensional 3 + 3 + 3 order boundary value problem with mixed nonlocal boundary conditions, a 2 -dimensional 2 + 4 order nonlocal boundary value problem discussed in [14], and a 2 -dimensional 2 + 2 order nonlocal boundary value problem discussed in [35].

5|$|Microscopic {{theoretical}} {{treatment of}} fluid phases can become quite complicated, {{owing to the}} high material density, meaning that strong interactions, hard-core repulsions, and many-body correlations cannot be ignored. In the case of liquid crystals, anisotropy {{in all of these}} interactions further complicates analysis. There are a number of <b>fairly</b> <b>simple</b> theories, however, that can at least predict the general behavior of the phase transitions in liquid crystal systems.|$|E
5|$|Norman {{government}} under William {{was similar to}} the government that had existed under earlier dukes. It was a <b>fairly</b> <b>simple</b> administrative system, built around the ducal household, which consisted of a group of officers including stewards, butlers, and marshalls. The duke travelled constantly around the duchy, confirming charters and collecting revenues. Most of the income came from the ducal lands, as well as from tolls and a few taxes. This income was collected by the chamber, one of the household departments.|$|E
5|$|At the {{juvenile}} stage, a teleost {{looks more like}} its adult form. At this stage, its axial skeleton, internal organs, scales, pigmentation and fins are fully developed. The transition from larvae to juvenile can be short and <b>fairly</b> <b>simple,</b> lasting minutes or hours as in some damselfish, while in other species, like salmon, squirrelfish, gobies and flatfishes, the transition is more complex and takes several weeks to complete. At the adult stage, a teleost is able to produce viable gametes for reproduction. Like many fish, teleosts continue to grow throughout their lives. Longevity depends on the species with some gamefish like European perch and largemouth bass living up to 25 years. Rockfish {{appear to be the}} longest living teleosts with some species living over 100 years.|$|E

5|$|Classical Nahuatl {{and most}} of the modern {{varieties}} have <b>fairly</b> <b>simple</b> phonological systems. They allow only syllables with maximally one initial and one final consonant. Consonant clusters occur only word-medially and over syllable boundaries. Some morphemes have two alternating forms: one with a vowel i to prevent consonant clusters and one without it. For example, the absolutive suffix has the variant forms -tli (used after consonants) and -tl (used after vowels). Some modern varieties, however, have formed complex clusters from vowel loss. Others have contracted syllable sequences, causing accents to shift or vowels to become long.|$|E
5|$|Crocodilian {{teeth are}} adapted for seizing and holding prey, and food is {{swallowed}} unchewed. The digestive tract is relatively short, as meat is a <b>fairly</b> <b>simple</b> substance to digest. The stomach {{is divided into}} two parts: a muscular gizzard that grinds food, and a digestive chamber where enzymes work on it. The stomach is more acidic than that of any other vertebrate and contains ridges for gastroliths, which {{play a role in the}} mechanical breakdown of food. Digestion takes place more quickly at higher temperatures. Crocodilians have a very low metabolic rate and consequently, low energy requirements. This allows them to survive for many months on a single large meal, digesting the food slowly. They can withstand extended fasting, living on stored fat between meals. Even recently hatched crocodiles are able to survive 58 days without food, losing 23% of their bodyweight during this time. An adult crocodile needs between a tenth and a fifth of the amount of food necessary for a lion of the same weight, and can live for half a year without eating.|$|E

A-efficiencies, based on average variances of the elementary contrasts of the line-effects, suggest that these designs are <b>fairly</b> robust. <b>Simple</b> g-inverses may be found for the information matrices of the line effects which allow evaluation of expressions for the variances of the line-effect differences with and without the missing observations. It is shown that, for small designs or {{when the number of}} lines is large, the reduction in efficiency for individual line comparisons can be quite large. When these designs are employed, care should be taken to ensure that individual observations are not lost...|$|R

2500|$|Syllable {{structure}} in Seri is <b>fairly</b> complex. <b>Simple</b> syllable onsets are most common, however, syllables without onsets can {{occur at the}} beginning of a word. The language generally allows up to three consonants to occur together {{at the beginning of}} a syllable, although consonants cannot be repeated (i.e. [...] "tt" [...] or [...] "pp"). It is like English in this respect, which allows three-consonant combinations like spray and acts. Unlike English, however, the specific combinations that may occur are much less restricted. For example, English allows spr- but disallows *ptk-, which Seri allows, as in ptcamn, ("Cortez spiny lobster", Panulirus inflatus). Rarely, clusters of four consonants can occur: [...] in cösxtamt, ..., [...] "there were many, ..."; [...] in ipoomjc x, ... "if s/he brings it, ...", (with enclitic x).|$|R

25|$|Most {{reptiles}} are insectivorous or carnivorous {{and have}} rather simple and comparatively short digestive tracts, meat being <b>fairly</b> <b>simple</b> {{to break down}} and digest. Digestion is slower than in mammals, reflecting their lower resting metabolism and their inability to divide and masticate their food. Their poikilotherm metabolism has very low energy requirements, allowing large reptiles like crocodiles and the large constrictors to live from a single large meal for months, digesting it slowly.|$|E
25|$|The case is {{the outer}} shell of the combustor, and is a <b>fairly</b> <b>simple</b> structure. The casing {{generally}} requires little maintenance. The case is protected from thermal loads by the air flowing in it, so thermal performance is of limited concern.

That mechanical (rather than thermal) load is a driving design factor in the case.|$|E
