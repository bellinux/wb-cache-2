The school opened 1 July 1864 with 14 pupils {{and a single}} teacher, though it apparently closed sometime after and reopened 28 January 1883 with a larger class of 34 pupils. In 1884 a new building, and teacher's residence, was completed {{at a cost of}} 1531 pounds. The new school was on the road to Mole Creek near the bridge over Lobster Rivulet, and had around 26–27 students. The school suffered regular flooding of the building, access roads and paths. Due to this flooding it was moved, in the 1930s, to next to the Methodist chapel in Sorrell street. [...] The school was extended in 1936 and remained in operation until closed, by the Tasmanian education department due to low student numbers, on 30 September 1965. From then students had to travel to the school at Mole Creek. The township of Chudleigh was formally declared in 1866. It continued to expand and by 1883 also had a post and telegraph office, two stores, two churches, and over a dozen houses. [...] An agricultural and horticultural show was first held in 1889. The Chudleigh Agricultural and Horticultural Society <b>has</b> <b>run</b> <b>the</b> show annually since, except for breaks from 1914–28 and 1939–45 due to the two World Wars.

[...] IGN's Diana Steenbergen also praised Beaver, calling Bobby [...] "a valuable member of the team" [...] that [...] "broadens [...] tight-knit unit, reminding them that there is more to family than just blood ties". She found the actor to be [...] "fantastic as the broken Bobby" [...] in the fifth season, [...] "despondent over his situation and feeling useless". Steenbergen noted, [...] "Bobby has been through a lot this season, and Jim Beaver has done an outstanding job portraying his journey. Not solely a surrogate father figure and keeper of random supernatural knowledge, this season Bobby <b>has</b> <b>run</b> <b>the</b> gamut of sacrifice, loss, anger, and determination to keep fighting." [...] After watching Bobby confess his suicidal thoughts to Dean in [...] "The Curious Case of Dean Winchester", she felt that [...] "Beaver conveys all of Bobby's vulnerability and also the shame that comes from being reprimanded by Dean for wanting to give up".|$|E
