5|$|For the {{hand-held}} camera footage, Soderbergh used Panavision Millennium XLs {{that were}} smaller and lighter than previous cameras and {{allowed him to}} move freely. In order to tell the three stories apart, he adopted a distinctive look for each. For Robert Wakefield's story, Soderbergh used tungsten film with no filter for a cold, monochrome blue <b>feel.</b> <b>For</b> Helena Ayala's story, Soderbergh used diffusion filters, flashing the film, overexposing it for a warmer <b>feel.</b> <b>For</b> Javier Rodriguez's story, the director used tobacco filters and a 45-degree shutter angle whenever possible to produce a strobe-like sharp feel. Then, he took the entire film through an Ektachrome step, which increased the contrast and grain significantly. He wanted to have different looks for each story because the audience had {{to keep track of}} many characters and absorb a lot of information and he did not want them to have to figure out which story they were watching.|$|E

5|$|To avoid {{repetitive}} audio, Crash of the Titans {{features more}} than 7,000 lines of dialogue, many of which contain references to popular culture, such as the film Brokeback Mountain. To achieve a natural <b>feel</b> <b>for</b> their dialogue, the voice actors performed all their lines three times. Many of the voice actors from Crash Tag Team Racing reprised their roles, including Jess Harnell as Crash Bandicoot and Lex Lang as Doctor Neo Cortex. Characters who were regulars in the series but did not appear in Crash Tag Team Racing were given new voice actors for Crash of the Titans. These replacements include Greg Eagles as Aku Aku, Chris Williams as Tiny Tiger, and John DiMaggio as Uka Uka. The DS version features full voice acting for cutscenes and in-game elements {{by some of the}} same voice actors from the home console version of the game, though some of the voice actors were substituted, such as Debi Derryberry in the role of Coco Bandicoot, and Nolan North in the role of N. Gin. Dingodile, who appears only in the DS and GBA versions, is voiced by Nolan North.|$|E

25|$|The {{medical history}} is a {{longitudinal}} record {{of what has happened}} to the patient since birth. It chronicles diseases, major and minor illnesses, as well as growth landmarks.

25|$|This is {{frequently}} {{a source of}} political friction as the committees are naturally dominated by swimming officials who do not necessarily share or understand {{the concerns of the}} diving community. Divers often <b>feel,</b> <b>for</b> example, that they do not get adequate support over issues like the provision of facilities. Other areas of concern are the selection of personnel for the specialised Diving committees and for coaching and officiating at events, and the team selection for international competitions.|$|E
25|$|In this example, {{the general}} {{deliverables}} within an implementation of software are mentioned, executed and delivered differently {{as time goes}} by, mainly because of dependencies between deliverables.

The customer organization can get a <b>feel</b> <b>for</b> the use of the software in the target domain, to guarantee that the software is a “fit” within the organization.|$|E
25|$|The Little 500 is {{much more}} than just the race. There are also several series events {{associated}} with the race. These events are held for a few reasons. The first and foremost is for fun. The second reason is so that teams can scout out the competition and get a <b>feel</b> <b>for</b> that year's race field. And the final reason is so that all the members of a team, not just those competing in the actual race itself, can still participate and compete. There are four other series events outside of the race: Qualifications, ITTs, Miss-N-Out, and Team Pursuit.|$|E

O'Brien and the Engineer-in-Chief, Major General Clive Steele, left Melbourne on 5 August 1944 {{on a tour of}} ordnance plants in the United States, Canada and Britain.

25|$|Composer Jeff Beal {{was invited}} to {{audition}} for Rome after he completed work on HBO's Carnivàle. The producers sent him a short edit of episode seven. From that, Beal began writing a demo score. Based on head writer Bruno Heller's desired gritty pre-Christian <b>feel</b> <b>for</b> the series, and HBO's interest in a non-modern sound, Beal chose to compose and record with live instruments from across the ancient Roman world. For each episode, Beal had about two weeks to work: in the first, he composed for – and recorded – the instruments he performed on the soundtrack. In the second week, he incorporated producer's notes, orchestrated and recorded the other live instrumental sections.|$|E
