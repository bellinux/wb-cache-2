[...] He became embroiled in a dispute with William Penn from the Middle Atlantic colony to the north, over {{how to deal with}} the issue of piracy. [...] In Maryland, Nicholson vigorously cracked down on the practices of some colonists to tolerate pirates, who brought goods and hard currency into the provinces. [...] Aware that Penn's governor William Markham was similarly tolerant (he was said to be taking bribes to allow pirates such as Thomas Day to trade in Pennsylvania), Nicholson ordered that ships destined for Pennsylvania be stopped and searched in Maryland waters, and collected duties if they were carrying European finished goods. [...] Penn protested to the Board of Trade, and the dispute subsided when Nicholson moderated his tactics. [...] During Nicholson's rule in Maryland, he specifically denied that the colonists had the Rights of Englishmen, writing that [...] "if I had not hampered them [...] in Maryland, and kept them under, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> been able to govern them." [...] His feud with pirates took a personal turn when in 1700 he accompanied the captain of HMS Shoreham in a fierce all-day battle against French pirate Louis Guittar. The defeated pirates asked Nicholson for quarter and pardon; he granted them quarter but referred them to King William III of England for mercy, in whose courts Guittar and his crew were all sentenced to hang.|$|E

Consuelo was the rose in The Little Prince. [...] "I should have judged her by her acts and not by her words," [...] says the prince. [...] "She wrapped herself around me and enlightened me. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> fled. I should have guessed at the tenderness behind her poor ruses." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 2000, Westbrook {{was photographed}} at the British Soap Awards, where {{an image of}} her missing [...] was given {{to a series of}} tabloid newspapers, {{unveiling}} her secret and highlighting her excessive drug abuse. Westbrook was checked into rehab and, six months later, she appeared on the Channel 4 show The Priory with the claim that she was clean and had been free from drugs for months. However, hosts Jamie Theakston and Zoë Ball struggled to get coherent answers from Westbrook, who was under the influence of drugs despite her claims of abstinence. Reflecting back on the event in 2002, Westbrook commented [...] "I said I was clean, but it was obvious I wasn't. I looked about 50, and my voice was shaky. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> been allowed on. They wanted to laugh at me, rip me apart. I despise that sort of thing, but it did me the world of good because watching it I realised, 'I'm so ill.' When it came to the crunch I thought, 'Hang on. I don't want to die.'" ...|$|E
