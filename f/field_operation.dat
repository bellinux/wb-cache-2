5|$|The major <b>field</b> <b>operation</b> of {{the fall}} was Hood's Franklin-Nashville Campaign, an {{invasion}} of Tennessee, which he undertook despite Beauregard's counsel that it made little operational or logistical sense. Hood did not treat Beauregard with the respect due to the department commander, communicating his plans reluctantly and making movements {{without regard to the}} consequences for his supply line, which Beauregard scrambled to maintain. While Hood traveled through Alabama and into Tennessee, Union Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman began his March to the Sea from Atlanta to Savannah, which focused Beauregard's attention back to Georgia. He was ineffective in stopping, or even delaying, Sherman's advance. He had inadequate local forces and was reluctant to strip defenses from other locations to concentrate them against Sherman. Furthermore, Sherman did an excellent job of deceiving the Confederates as to the intermediate and final targets of his march. Savannah fell on December 21 and Sherman's army began to march north into South Carolina in January. Also in late December, Beauregard found out that Hood's army had been severely damaged in its defeat at the Battle of Nashville; there were very few men in fighting condition who could oppose Sherman's advance.|$|E

2500|$|While the Wright Amendment {{prevented}} {{any other}} major airlines from starting service out of Love Field, {{it did not}} deter Southwest. Based on short trips to begin with, Southwest continued to flourish as it used multiple shorthaul flights to build its Love <b>Field</b> <b>operation.</b> Some people managed to [...] "work the system" [...] and get around the Wright Amendment's restrictions. For example, a person could fly from Dallas to Houston or Albuquerque, change planes, and then fly to any city Southwest served — although he had, at the time, to do so on two tickets in each direction, since the Wright Amendment specifically barred airlines from issuing tickets that violated the law's provisions. [...] This work-around was also problematic {{due to the fact}} that between flights checked baggage had to be collected and checked onto the next flight. This had the effect of creating mini-hubs at Houston/Hobby Airport and the Albuquerque International Sunport. Southwest continued to grow and became one of the most successful and profitable airlines in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|The {{rational}} {{system of}} aircraft procurement {{was to be}} exemplified by the Military Aircraft Competition held on Salisbury Plain at Larkhill, announced late in 1911. [...] The rules called for two-seater aircraft capable of various speed, climb, endurance and <b>field</b> <b>operation</b> conditions. O'Gorman was on the judging committee, so the B.E.1 {{was not allowed to}} compete; nevertheless it put in regular appearances at the trials, where its performance was clearly superior to most of the competing aircraft. [...] The B.E.1 was followed by the almost identical B.E.2 design, mass-produced with minor changes as the B.E.2a and later developed into the B.E.2c by E. T. Busk. Busk's objective was to create an inherently stable aircraft for military observation purposes. [...] Unfortunately the aircraft's stability resulted in a loss of manoeverability, and when German aircraft fitted with synchronised guns appeared in 1915 the large-scale losses of B.E.2c during the Fokker Scourge of 1915 led to a parliamentry inquiry. [...] Although this did not find O'Gorman at fault it led to O'Gorman's departure from the Factory: his contract, which was to expire in October, was not renewed. [...] O'Gorman, now holding the rank of lieutenant-colonel in the Royal Flying Corps, remained as a consulting engineer to the Director-General of Military Aeronautics from 1916 to 1919.|$|E
