5|$|The Ramblin' Wreck was {{featured}} prominently on the October 18, 2007 episode of Jim Cramer's Mad Money. Cramer exited the Wreck's passenger door {{to start the}} show and one of Cramer's trademark soundboards {{was attached to the}} <b>front</b> <b>bumper.</b>|$|E
5|$|For certain markets like China, where Camry sits {{right below}} similar-sized Mercedes-Benz cars as a luxury model, it is {{important}} for the Aurion to exemplify the traits of such vehicles. With the development of the Aurion, designers produced two separate philosophies, each pitched at a specific niche of the market. The base model AT-X, and luxury Prodigy and Presara variants employ the comfort design, with the more aggressive sports-oriented style found on the Sportivo versions. To meet this requirement, the Sportivo variants feature unique 17-inch alloy wheels, a rear spoiler, body kit appendages, and a three-spoke steering wheel. The high-performance TRD models offer a similar sports-oriented design, but are distinguishable by the use of unique body parts. These include a redesigned Formula One-inspired <b>front</b> <b>bumper,</b> with integrated foglamps, a unique rear bumper with fixed tailpipes.|$|E
5|$|Pigozzi {{maintained}} {{a schedule of}} year-to-year model revisions, much like US manufacturers. For 1956, an estate version called the Simca Vedette Marly joined the line-up and the whole range was revised. A new license plate holder {{was added to the}} <b>front</b> <b>bumper</b> and the rear license plate now concealed the fuel tank filler. A peculiar addition was a pedal-operated windscreen washer, while other more ordinary changes included a second odometer, also known as a 'trip meter', for measuring partial distances. The Versailles and Régence were made even more comfortable with the addition of central armrests (Versailles in the rear only, Régence in front and rear), while the Trianon was simplified, losing bumper guards and chrome windscreen decor. In 1957, an option of the Gravina automatic clutch was added, along with better brakes and more direct steering. The Trianon regained the chrome decor around the windscreen, while the other models acquired slimmer tail lights and the front ornament was replaced with a new design. Fender-mounted V8 badges were introduced but, although the whole range featured the same V8 engine, the new badges appeared on the fenders of only the Régence and Marly.|$|E

25|$|Front fenders, hood, <b>front</b> <b>bumper,</b> are {{interchangeable}} {{with all}} 1967 Ambassadors. Windshields {{as well as}} doors and their glass from all two-door Ambassadors and Rebels are also interchangeable.|$|E
25|$|The <b>front</b> <b>bumper</b> is {{the first}} part of the vehicle that the air must flow around. Therefore, it plays a crucial role in {{reducing}} drag. A front air dam is often used which extends from the very front of the vehicle down to the lowest part of the vehicle. This is done to direct airflow around and over the vehicle rather than allowing air to travel under it. Contoured deflectors, or tire spats, are often made as part of the <b>front</b> <b>bumper</b> in order to direct airflow around the tire without having any increase to the outward flow.|$|E
50|$|A de-luxe {{version was}} {{announced}} at the 1953 London Motor Show with leather upholstery, a heater and over-riders on the <b>front</b> <b>bumpers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Inspired by a {{scene in}} the film Date Night, in which a taxicab and sports sedan stuck {{together}} by their <b>front</b> <b>bumpers</b> perform a series of maneuvers in city streets. The Build Team obtained two cars {{similar to those used}} in the scene, tore off their <b>front</b> <b>bumpers,</b> and built a hitch to hold them together nose-to-nose. Driving at 40 mph, with Tory in the cab and Grant and Kari in the sedan, they tested the cars' ability to...|$|R

25|$|Nissan {{unveiled}} the Nissan Leaf Aero Style concept {{car at the}} 2011 Tokyo Auto Salon. The Leaf Aero Style exterior has a new <b>front</b> <b>bumper,</b> extended side skirts, restyled mirrors, LED daytime driving lights, and special wheels.|$|E
25|$|The updated Avalanches {{with some}} of the Z Series {{upgrades}} can be externally visually differentiated from the Y Series versions by their re-profiled <b>front</b> <b>bumper</b> unit that looks less aggressive and which features a more integrated appearance to the auxiliary driving lights.|$|E
25|$|Push bumper (aka nudge bars): Fitted to {{the chassis}} {{of the car}} and located to augment the <b>front</b> <b>bumper,</b> to allow the car {{to be used as a}} {{battering}} ram for simple structures or fences, or to push disabled vehicles off the road.|$|E
50|$|Minor {{changes with}} new <b>front</b> <b>bumpers,</b> grille, tail lights, and revised {{interior}} fabric were new for 1998 Japanese market models. Production of the Starlet ended in July 1999, {{just after the}} launch of the Yaris.|$|R
50|$|Changes for 1974 {{included}} {{even larger}} <b>front</b> <b>bumpers</b> and new larger rear bumpers to match. They added 2.5 {{in to the}} length of the 2-door model and 4 in {{to the length of}} the 4-door model.|$|R
50|$|For 1972, Engine {{power dropped}} to meet stricter {{emissions}} standards and rising gas prices. Chryslers received a new 'split grille' somewhat {{similar to the}} Dodge Chargers of 1971-1974. This {{would be the last}} year for the 'loop'-style <b>front</b> <b>bumpers</b> on Chryslers.|$|R
25|$|Skyline Sedan sport {{versions}} (370GT Type SP, 370GT Type SP, 250GT Type S) {{receive a}} special wider, low-centered body {{design for a}} more dynamic, sporty appeal. Changes include a new unique grille, <b>front</b> <b>bumper,</b> headlights, rear bumper and use of black trim for the inner headlamp panels.|$|E
25|$|Front {{and rear}} styling of the 1973 Grand Prix turned out be an {{evolution}} of the 1971 and 1972 models with a vertical-bar V-nose grille and single headlamps along with the new federally mandated 5mph (8km/h) <b>front</b> <b>bumper.</b> The rear featured a revised boattail-like trim with square-taillights above the bumper.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} {{introduction}} of the GS 460, the GS lineup received a mid-cycle styling refresh, including a revised <b>front</b> <b>bumper,</b> headlights and grille, turn signals added to the side mirrors, and new wheel options and exterior colors. The interior received a redesigned steering wheel, revised instrument cluster gauges, and different trim pieces.|$|E
50|$|Exterior:Front lip/spoiler, Rear boot spoiler with {{integral}} brake light, Headlight washers, electric sunroof, colour-coded mirrors, colour-coded door handles, colour-coded <b>front</b> rear <b>bumpers,</b> <b>front</b> fog lights, lightweight Speedline 5 spoke alloy wheels.|$|R
50|$|A new four-speed Turbo Hydra-Matic 700R4 {{transmission}} with overdrive gearing {{became available}} in 1981 for the 1982 model year. The 151 hp 379 cuin L Detroit Diesel V-8 {{was added to}} replace the LF9 Oldsmobile diesel. Chrome <b>front</b> <b>bumpers</b> were now standard on base models.|$|R
50|$|The facelifted {{version of}} the Vito began from September 2010, and {{features}} restyled front and rear lights, restyled <b>front</b> <b>bumpers,</b> and more-efficient diesel engines adapted from the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter range. The Vito's suspension, instrumentation, steering wheel, and overall quality of materials was also improved.|$|R
25|$|The Caprice was updated again {{based on}} the Holden WN Caprice. The Caprice LS & LTZ still retain the <b>front</b> <b>bumper</b> as the WM Statesman while the Royale now gets the same <b>front</b> <b>bumper</b> as seen on the WM/WN Caprice & the Caprice SS & the rims that were {{previously}} on the 2011-2013 Caprice SS, the 2010-2013 WM Caprice V, & currently the WN Caprice LPG model, and the Holden Commodore (VF) Calais's interior just like the Holden models. The SS now gains the rear vision camera which was previously only available on the Caprice Royale while {{it is still not}} available on the Caprice LS or LTZ, the same interior updates the WN Caprice & Caprice Royale, and also gets the same rims as on the WN Caprice V & while the LS, LTZ & SS gain new rims.|$|E
25|$|All four {{versions}} of the Hornet were mostly carryovers in 1974, with minimal trim changes. The car's <b>front</b> <b>bumper</b> lost its full-width vinyl rub strip but gained two rubber-faced bumper guards. A larger rear bumper was added to meet new 5mph legislation, and the license plate was moved up to a position between the taillights.|$|E
25|$|Coinciding {{with the}} {{introduction}} of the GS 460, the GS lineup received a mid-cycle styling refresh, including a revised <b>front</b> <b>bumper,</b> headlights and grille, turn signals added to the side mirrors, and new wheel options and exterior colors. Inside the vehicle, the GS received a redesigned steering wheel, revised instrument cluster gauges, and different trim pieces.|$|E
25|$|Police {{departments}} {{throughout the}} United States including the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department in California {{have come to}} believe that, when executed properly, PIT is an intermediate force option that can safely end a pursuit. Police vehicles often have reinforced <b>front</b> <b>bumpers</b> to support this technique.|$|R
50|$|In Europe, {{the estate}} version was {{sometimes}} sold {{as part of}} the Golf line, either in addition to or instead of the Bora. Other than different <b>front</b> <b>bumpers,</b> fenders, headlights, and hood, the cars were identical. In some countries were sold both Golf and Bora Variant.|$|R

25|$|In {{comparison}} to the Polo Mk4, the Polo Vivo has a restyled <b>front</b> <b>bumper</b> and grille, deleted scuff strips on the bumpers and sides of the car, and side indicators relocated from the wing mirrors to the front fenders. This restyling gives the Polo Vivo some {{of the elements of}} the design language used in other contemporary VW models.|$|E
25|$|The revised GT-R {{features}} an engine with revised mapping, changes to valve timing, larger inlets and a revised exhaust system which boosts rated power to 545bhp and 612Nm of torque from 3200 to 6000rpm. Changes {{also include a}} new more rigid front strut bar made from carbon composite, larger front brake rotors, new lighter and stiffer wheels, and revised Dunlop tires. Cosmetic changes include a new <b>front</b> <b>bumper</b> with integrated LEDs. The <b>front</b> <b>bumper</b> improves cooling to the radiator and front brakes while reducing drag. A new rear diffuser improves downforce and also includes additional rear cooling ducts. The interior was revised to improve the quality. This new version is offered with a new HDD CARWINGS navigation system with enhanced entertainment {{features an}}d USB port with iPod connectivity. The revised GT-R went on sale in Japan from mid November 2010 and February 2011 in Europe, North America and other regions.|$|E
25|$|In 1977, {{the most}} {{important}} modification was that the front turn signals were moved to the <b>front</b> <b>bumper,</b> as on 1975 and later European Beetles. With {{the introduction of the}} Caribe, some of the colours introduced the new model were available on the Mexican VW. In addition, vinyl upholstery was discontinued, leaving cloth–vinyl upholstery as the only option.|$|E
5000|$|For 1972, Catalinas {{and other}} {{full-sized}} Pontiacs received new Grand Prix-style [...] "V" [...] nose grilles and sturdier <b>front</b> <b>bumpers</b> that could withstand crashes {{of up to}} 5 mi/h km/h, a year ahead of the Federal standard that took effect in 1973, along with revised taillight lenses.|$|R
5000|$|As {{originally}} {{conceived by}} Harley Earl, GM Vice President of Design, the conical bumper guards would mimic artillery shells. [...] Placed inboard of the headlights on <b>front</b> <b>bumpers</b> of Cadillacs, {{they were intended}} to both convey {{the image of a}} speeding projectile and protect vehicles' front ends in collisions.|$|R
50|$|A mild {{facelift}} in October 2006 had {{the orange}} indicators swapped for clear ones, which were more {{integrated into the}} headlamp housings. On the Opel model, the indicators moved from the <b>front</b> <b>bumpers,</b> up into the headlamp housings, thus looking more similar to the Renault. Production ended in June 2014.|$|R
