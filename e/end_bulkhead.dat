40|$|In many {{naval ships}} of fiber {{composite}} sandwich construction, an X-joint exists where the <b>end</b> <b>bulkhead</b> of the superstructure {{is attached to}} the deck, with an internal bulkhead placed in the same vertical plane below the deck. This joint is subjected to alternating tensile and compressive loading in the vertical direction for respectively hogging and sagging bending deformation of the hull girder. When the core material is polymer foam, such joints are often strengthened by the insertion of a higher density core material in the deck panel in the immediate region of the joint. The paper aims to improve the basis for the design of such X-joints, focusing on the prevention of crushing of the core under compressive load while ensuring adequate damage tolerance for the case of tensile load. Extensive material tests are reported, strain distributions are investigated by both laboratory tests and numerical modeling, and design guidance for core inserts is presented...|$|E

50|$|This armour {{scheme was}} {{designed}} to withstand 1,000 pound bombs (and heavier bombs which struck at an angle); in the Home and Mediterranean theatres it was likely that the carriers would operate {{within the range of}} shore-based aircraft, which could carry heavier bombs than their carrier-based equivalents. The flight deck had an armoured thickness of 3 inches, closed by 4.5-inch sides and bulkheads. There were 3-inch strakes on either side extending from the box sides to the top edge of the main side belt, which was of 4.5 inches. The main belt protected the machinery, petrol storage, magazines and aerial weapon stores. The lifts were placed outside the hangar, at either end, with access through sliding armoured doors in the <b>end</b> <b>bulkheads.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Gunnery trials {{against the}} target ship USS San Marcos (ex-) {{confirmed}} {{the need for}} a better armor suite. In designing such a system, the Nevadas team was [...] "almost alone," [...] without precedents from which to follow or refine. They first had to realize that belt and deck armor had to form one common [...] "zone of immunity," [...] with the belt setting the inner edge of this zone and the deck, the outer edge. The New Yorks featured a deck thick enough to set off an armor-piercing shell over a thinner-armored deck to catch the splinter. To maximize protection, main and splinter decks were combined into one. The armored deck was raised one level to link it directly to the top edge of the belt armor. This reduced a weak spot previously covered by the mid grade casement armor, simplified construction and increased girder strength for the hull. As all U.S. battleships already had thick armor <b>end</b> <b>bulkheads,</b> this gave the magazines, machinery and control areas one continuous armored box.|$|R

50|$|As on the ER1, the ER2 car {{bodies are}} of a welded {{all-metal}} semi-monocoque load-bearing design (the entire car body bears all structural loads). The framework is built up from bent and extruded steel profiles, and consists of ring frames which are covered with corrugated sheet steel 1.5-2.5 mm thick. The automatic couplers and their shock absorbers are mounted on short spine beams {{at each end of}} the car. The doors and wire conduits are made of aluminum, which helped to keep the weight down and resulted in the cars being only slightly heavier than those of the ER1. Footboards are fitted under the outside of each door for boarding and alighting to/from low platforms; when boarding/alighting passengers to/from high platforms, these are covered by metal aprons (gap fillers). The <b>end</b> <b>bulkheads</b> of each car (except for the head end of the driving trailer, which is occupied by the engineer's cab) incorporate swing-down transfer platforms which allow passengers to walk between cars; these also damp the cars' pitching motion when the train is moving.

40|$|Expressions are {{provided}} for calculating the torsional stiffness {{of a car}} body passenger compartment. The two main reaction systems which contribute towards the torsional stiffness, i. e. the couple due to shear forces in the roof and floor and the rectangular frame formed by the sill torque boxes and the <b>end</b> <b>bulkheads</b> of the passenger compartment, are considered separately. This enables the behaviour to be studied qualitatively as well as quantitatively. It is shown theoretically and diagrammatically that the first system {{is dependent on the}} bend stiffness of the members forming the door apertures. Simplifying assumptions permit the expressions developed to be sufficiently straightforward for them to be acceptable for repeated use in the design office to optimize the distribution of material. Alternative approaches are suggested for cases where greater accuracy is necessary. The basic expressions relate to a simplified structure but a technique is supplied for assessing the contribution of extra members. The effect of the horizontal offset of the wheel centres from the ends of the passenger compartment is dis-cussed and the influence of suspension and structure geometries on the effective offset is mentioned. Ways in which the deflections of the passenger compartment affect the front and rear end structures are discussed qualitatively...|$|R

40|$|The Interim Report of October, 1951, {{presented}} {{a survey of}} the surface barrier studies which had been conducted by the Hydraulic Structures Laboratory up to that date. The performance curves of a number of types of mobile breakwaters were examined, and the decision reached that the most satisfactory one, all factors considered, was the three-bulkhead structure. After investigating the effect of such parameters as freeboard height, bottom clearance, and bulkhead spacing on the overall behavior of the barrier, a scale model of a hypothetical prototype pontoon assembly was constructed which incorporated {{what appeared to be the}} most effective values of these parameters. Performance data of this so-called optimum breakwater was given in the October report. The present report continues where the previous one left off, with a more intensive consideration of certain features of barrier performance which have been but vaguely understood. Specifically, the values of the coefficient of transmission, defined as the ratio of transmitted wave height to incident wave height, were determined under various controlled wave conditions for the following bodies: (1) Fixed single bulkheads of different bottom clearances. (2) Fixed three-bulkhead barrier. (3) Floating three-bulkhead barrier with fixed baffle extending upward from the bottom. (4) Floating barrier with weighted mooring lines. (5) Floating barrier with increased virtual mass on the <b>end</b> <b>bulkheads.</b> (6) Floating barrier with hydrofoil added forward of first bulkhead. In general, these conditions imposed upon the barrier were artificial, and impractical, as far as direct application to a prototype structure is concerned. Some information was gained, however, by separating to a limited degree the various factors which influence energy transmission by the floating breakwater. Unless specified otherwise, the floating barrier referred to in this report is the optimum structure with three bulkheads spaced at 73 and 127 feet, high freeboard, and 15 -foot, 5 -foot and 15 -foot bottom clearances. The original performance curve of this body, obtained using soft springs in the mooring lines, is the second curve of Fig. 8 in the October report, and is used frequently as a convenient basis of comparison for the data obtained in the present series of tests...|$|R

5000|$|In the USA, an {{emergency}} stop cord is not used. Any visible cord running {{within the body}} of a railway car would have been what was known as the [...] "communicating cord." [...] This was a method of signalling the engine operator (known in the US as the [...] "engineer"). Unlike other countries, it was never intended for use by passengers. It had its own code of signals, similar to engine whistle signals. Drivers receiving an unusual, or unidentifiable, communicating signal might stop the train, perhaps as a [...] "normal stop" [...] or an [...] "emergency application," [...] at his discretion. A long, continuous signal would usually prompt a driver to make {{an emergency}} stop. Emergency brake valves were (and still are) always located on the <b>bulkheads</b> (<b>end</b> walls), inside the body of the car next to its end doors. The emergency brake valve is covered by a metal or clear plastic shield labelled [...] "Emergency Only." [...] Sometimes there was also a communicating signal handle on the inside bulkhead, labelled [...] "signal." [...] Mistakenly identifying the communication cord as the emergency brake can lead to confusion about how emergency braking works on US trains. Once an emergency brake valve is opened, all of the air in the braking system, except those of the locomotive(s), which are equipped with brakes controlled separately from those of the cars, is evacuated ("dumped" [...] in US jargon), immediately placing the train cars' brakes into emergency, just as if there had been an uncoupling of cars (a [...] "separation"). No action is required (or even possible) {{on the part of the}} engineer. The train will stop, no matter what he/she does. There is no override. Once the train has stopped, the braking system will not recharge (pressurize) until the emergency valve has been closed. This means a member of the train crew must locate the open valve, and ascertain that there is no problem which would make it unsafe to release the brakes and proceed. Identification of the valve is possible by the sound of air escaping from it. In many cars (and practically all cars built post-WWII), the communicating cord was only located in the vestibule, unless the car was of such a type that it did not have a vestibule, such as a dining or lounge car. In newer Amtrak equipment, the air-operated communicating system was electrified, and operated by pressing a button located in the vestibule. The old communicating systems have been gradually supplanted by radios, although they were still required on US passenger equipment until relatively recently. The emergency brake valve continues to be located on the inside bulkhead, or in a consistent (standard) location specified by safety regulations.|$|R
40|$|Current {{options for}} Lunar habitat {{architecture}} include inflatable habitats and airlocks. Inflatable structures can have mass and volume advantages over conventional structures. Inflatable structures {{are perceived to}} carry additional risk because they are at a lower Technical Readiness Level (TRL) than conventional metallic structures. One of {{the risks associated with}} inflatable structures is understanding the tolerance to component damage and the resulting behavior of the system after the damage is introduced. The Damage Tolerance Test (DTT) is designed to study the structural integrity of an expandable structure during and subsequent to induced damage. The TransHab Project developed an experimental inflatable module developed at Johnson Space Center in the 1990 's. The TransHab design was originally envisioned for use in Mars Transits but was also studied as a potential habitat for the International Space Station (ISS). The design of the TransHab module was based on a woven design using an Aramid fabric. Testing of this design demonstrated a high level of predictability and repeatability and good correlation with analytical predictions of stresses and deflections. Based on JSC's experience with the design and analysis of woven inflatable structures, the Damage Tolerance Test article was designed and fabricated using a woven design. The Damage Tolerance Test Article consists of a load bearing restraint layer, a bladder or gas barrier, and a structural metallic core. The test article restraint layer is fabricated from one inch wide Kevlar webbing that is woven in a basket weave pattern. Underneath the structural restraint layer is the bladder or gas barrier. For this test the bladder was required to maintain pressure for testing only and was not representative of a flight design. The bladder and structural restraint layer attach to the structural core of the module at steel <b>bulkheads</b> at each <b>end.</b> The two <b>bulkheads</b> are separated by a 10 foot center tube which provides the structural support for the module when in a non-inflated state as well as resists a portion of the axial load when pressurized. The longitudinal members of the structural restraint layer are attached to the bulkheads using a series of clevises that are bolted to the bulkheads. Strain gages are placed on the clevises that can measure change in load when the structural restraint is inflated. The test module is 88 inches in diameter and 120 inches in height. The objectives of the DTT are to (1) verify the structural integrity of the assembled and pressurized structure when a section of the structural restraint layer is cut by a foreign object, and (2) verify the load distribution of the structural restraint layer during pressurization, before and after the structural restraint layer is severed. For this test, a longitudinal structural restraint strap will be severed using a linear shape charge. The linear shape charge was designed specifically for this application to cut only a single longitudinal strap, while not damaging the bladder. An array of strain gages were located at the bulkhead mounted clevises where the longitudinal restraint layer straps are attached. The DTT article was inflated to 45 psig, 25 % of the ultimate design pressure, and one of the one-inch wide longitudinal structural members was severed. Strain gage measurements of loading in an array of longitudinal straps were taken throughout pressurization of the module to 45 psig, before firing of the linear shape charge, and after firing of the shape charge and separation of the strap. During testing not only were the original objectives met but better than expected results occurred. This paper will discuss space inflatable structures, damage tolerance analysis, test results, and applicability to the Lunar architecture...|$|R
