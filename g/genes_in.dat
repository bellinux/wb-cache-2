5|$|Homologous {{sequences}} are paralogous if {{they were}} created by a duplication event within the genome. For gene duplication events, if a gene in an organism is duplicated to occupy two different positions in the same genome, then the two copies are paralogous. Paralogous genes often {{belong to the same}} species. They can shape the structure of whole genomes and thus explain genome evolution to a large extent. Examples include the Homeobox (Hox) <b>genes</b> <b>in</b> animals. These genes not only underwent gene duplications within chromosomes but also whole genome duplications. As a result, Hox <b>genes</b> <b>in</b> most vertebrates are clustered across multiple chromosomes with the HoxA-D clusters being the best studied.|$|E
5|$|RNA {{interference}} genes, as {{components of}} the antiviral innate immune system in many eukaryotes, are involved in an evolutionary arms race with viral genes. Some viruses have evolved mechanisms for suppressing the RNAi response in their host cells, particularly for plant viruses. Studies of evolutionary rates in Drosophila have shown that <b>genes</b> <b>in</b> the RNAi pathway are subject to strong directional selection and are among the fastest-evolving <b>genes</b> <b>in</b> the Drosophila genome.|$|E

5|$|The vast {{majority}} of living organisms encode their <b>genes</b> <b>in</b> long strands of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). DNA consists of a chain made from four types of nucleotide subunits, each composed of: a five-carbon sugar (2'-deoxyribose), a phosphate group, {{and one of the}} four bases adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine.|$|E
5|$|A few DNA {{sequences}} in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, {{and more}} in plasmids and viruses, blur the distinction between sense and antisense strands by having overlapping <b>genes.</b> <b>In</b> these cases, some DNA sequences do double duty, encoding one protein when read along one strand, and a second protein when read {{in the opposite direction}} along the other strand. In bacteria, this overlap may be involved in the regulation of gene transcription, while in viruses, overlapping genes increase the amount of information that can be encoded within the small viral genome.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{international}} breed associations have been testing the F94L status of cattle registered in their herd books. The absence of F94L <b>genes</b> <b>in</b> some tested cattle {{might be a}} result of a sire or dam ancestor that had double muscling (MH) genes, or more likely that the myostatin gene was the normal or wild type variant found most commonly in beef cattle. In the latter case, loss of the F94L variant will arise when grading up to purebred when base animals are not Limousins.|$|E

5|$|Complicating {{factors include}} {{claims that the}} {{relationship}} between eukaryotes and the archaeal phylum Crenarchaeota is closer than the relationship between the Euryarchaeota and the phylum Crenarchaeota and the presence of archaea-like <b>genes</b> <b>in</b> certain bacteria, such as Thermotoga maritima, from horizontal gene transfer. The standard hypothesis states that the ancestor of the eukaryotes diverged early from the Archaea, and that eukaryotes arose through fusion of an archaean and eubacterium, which became the nucleus and cytoplasm; this explains various genetic similarities but runs into difficulties explaining cell structure. An alternative hypothesis, the eocyte hypothesis, posits that Eukaryota emerged relatively late from the Archaea.|$|E

Genome sequencing {{of a large number}} of isolates of E. coli and related bacteria shows that a taxonomic reclassification would be desirable.

5|$|For {{much of the}} 20th century, prokaryotes were {{regarded}} as a single group of organisms and classified based on their biochemistry, morphology and metabolism. For example, microbiologists tried to classify microorganisms based on the structures of their cell walls, their shapes, and the substances they consume. In 1965, Emile Zuckerkandl and Linus Pauling proposed instead using the sequences of the <b>genes</b> <b>in</b> different prokaryotes to work out how they are related to each other. This approach, known as phylogenetics, is the main method used today.|$|E

5|$|Genes are {{regulated}} {{so that they}} are expressed only when the product is needed, since expression draws on limited resources. A cell regulates its gene expression depending on its external environment (e.g. available nutrients, temperature and other stresses), its internal environment (e.g. cell division cycle, metabolism, infection status), and its specific role if in a multicellular organism. Gene expression can be regulated at any step: from transcriptional initiation, to RNA processing, to post-translational modification of the protein. The regulation of lactose metabolism <b>genes</b> <b>in</b> E. coli (lac operon) was the first such mechanism to be described in 1961.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{engineering}} is the modification of an organism's genome through biotechnology. Since the 1970s, {{a variety of}} techniques have been developed to specifically add, remove and edit <b>genes</b> <b>in</b> an organism. Recently developed genome engineering techniques use engineered nuclease enzymes to create targeted DNA repair in a chromosome to either disrupt or edit a gene when the break is repaired. The related term synthetic biology is sometimes used to refer to extensive genetic engineering of an organism.|$|E
5|$|Horizontal gene {{transfer}} {{refers to the}} transfer of genetic material through a mechanism other than reproduction. This mechanism is a common source of new <b>genes</b> <b>in</b> prokaryotes, sometimes thought to contribute more to genetic variation than gene duplication. It is a common means of spreading antibiotic resistance, virulence, and adaptive metabolic functions. Although horizontal {{gene transfer}} is rare in eukaryotes, likely examples have been identified of protist and alga genomes containing genes of bacterial origin.|$|E

5|$|Many prokaryotes have CRISPR RNAs, a {{regulatory}} system similar to RNA interference. Antisense RNAs are widespread; most downregulate a gene, {{but a few}} are activators of transcription.
