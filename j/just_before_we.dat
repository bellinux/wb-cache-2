25|$|To {{those who}} worked with him at Bazaar, the {{pinnacle}} of Brodovitch's career as a designer was the unfailing elegance of his pages. This elegance, combined with an element of innovation was the ideal mix for a fashion magazine. The quality that guaranteed his success was his devotion to the new, unending surprise and vitality. Frances MacFadden, Bazaars managing editor for much of Brodovitch's tenure, explained his working method:It was a pleasure to watch him work. He was so swift and sure. In emergencies, like the time the Clipper bearing the report of the Paris Collections was held up in Bermuda, his speed was dazzling. A quick splash or two on the cutting board, a minute's juggling of the photostats, a slather of art gum, and the sixteen pages were complete. His layouts, of course, were the despair of copywriters whose cherished tone poems on girdles or minks had to be sacrificed to his sacred white space. <b>Just</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> went to press, all the layouts were laid out in sequence on Carmel Snow's floor, and there, under his eye, re-arranged until the rhythm of the magazine suited him.|$|E

"the moment I {{heard someone}} play a guitar, in the Philippines at the convent we {{attended}} <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> moved to California, I instantly {{knew this was}} for me.

6000|$|... "The reports seem exaggerated," [...] John laughed. [...] "We {{went in to}} {{supper at}} half past twelve and <b>we</b> came out <b>just</b> <b>before</b> two. <b>We</b> sat on chairs, and the {{conversation}} was quite decorous." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Just</b> <b>before</b> dark <b>we</b> {{reached the}} main body of troops shortly after they had made camp for the night. I was {{immediately}} taken before the leader, who proved to be the jeddak of the hordes of Warhoon.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Just</b> like <b>before</b> <b>we</b> {{can use the}} irreducibility {{criterion}} of the next chapter to prove that [...] is irreducible. Now, [...] and [...] are isomorphic, because [...] for all [...] in which [...] is given by the matrix ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Upon my honour I did.--I met Colonel Brandon Monday {{morning in}} Bond-street, <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> left town, {{and he told}} me of it directly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Our {{clothing}} and provisions are," [...] said Randy. [...] "I saw them put down <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> started. But the tools {{may be out}} there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{we might}} as well start up a fire," [...] came from Darry, in {{something}} of a disappointed tone. [...] "I was hoping we'd be able to camp under the stars <b>just</b> once <b>before</b> <b>we</b> got to the fort." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, now, let's {{look at it}} {{from his}} point of view. Let's be {{perfectly}} <b>just</b> to him <b>before</b> <b>we</b> take another step forward." ...|$|R
60|$|I got up obediently. Aunt Martha was as {{grim and}} uncompromising as ever, and Mrs. Saxby {{looked like a}} chief mourner, but do you suppose I cared? I dropped behind them <b>just</b> once <b>before</b> <b>we</b> left the shore. I knew he was {{watching}} me and I waved my hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "Say, we {{had some}} scare this morning <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> left the cabin!" [...] {{declared}} the shipowner's son. [...] "I was nearly frightened into a fit!" ...|$|E

5000|$|Fatah {{military}} commander Abu Araj {{has stated that}} if settlers return to Homesh, the Palestinians would meet the Jewish community with, [...] "fire and attacks.

50|$|<b>Just</b> as <b>before,</b> <b>we</b> have (J, G; D, B) = (J, Z; H, E). Pappus {{does not}} {{explicitly}} prove this; but Lemma X is a converse, namely {{that if these}} two cross ratios are the same, and the straight lines BE and DH cross at A, then the points G, A, and Z must be collinear.|$|R
30|$|Our study {{particularly}} {{focused on}} imaging the heart, lung and the diaphragm although {{only during the}} weaning trial <b>just</b> <b>before</b> extubation. <b>We</b> believe that ultrasound may {{provide an opportunity for}} the intensivist to optimize the patient’s cardiac and respiratory function before extubation, and perhaps modify the weaning mechanism, such as transitioning those at risk to non-invasive ventilation before discontinuing the ventilatory support [32, 33].|$|R
6000|$|... "The only record I {{have with}} me," [...] {{explained}} the phonograph, [...] "is one the Magician attached <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> had our quarrel. It's a highly classical composition." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I saw, you know, {{that night}} at Tishy's, <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> left England, your {{wonderful}} start. I {{got a look at}} your attitude, as it were, and your system." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, <b>just</b> <b>before</b> the bridge. <b>We</b> {{were coming}} along nicely, when a stray dog grabbed our nine hundred and ninety-eighth {{and took it}} nearly back to Woodfield, {{and we had to}} start all over again. How are you getting on?" ...|$|R
60|$|On the {{following}} noon we topped another rise, and came unmistakably {{in sight of}} the Stikeen River lying deep in its rocky cañon. We had ridden all the morning in a pelting rain, slashed by wet trees, plunging through bogs and sliding down ravines, and {{when we saw the}} valley <b>just</b> <b>before</b> us <b>we</b> raised a cheer. It seemed we could hear the hotel bells ringing far below.|$|R
60|$|<b>Just</b> <b>before</b> sundown, as <b>we</b> rested {{after our}} toil, we {{perceived}} {{a small company}} of men advancing towards us {{from the direction of}} Loo, one of whom bore a palm leaf in his hand for a sign that he came as a herald.|$|R
6000|$|... "They are all willing, captain," [...] Andre said. [...] "We {{spoke to}} them again, <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> came in last night, and they all {{said that they were}} willing and anxious." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lady Beatrice? She died in India <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> came home. Well, I used to {{stay with}} them after we came back to England, and of course talked to my friend--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have not}} yet told me, by-the-bye, what old Mr Rogan said to you <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> started. Did he give you any hint as to where you might be sent to after {{reaching}} Norway House?" ...|$|E
60|$|At length, <b>just</b> <b>before</b> sunset, <b>we</b> set out again. It {{was a wild}} {{evening when}} we coasted up {{the north side of}} this Apmoojenegamook Lake. One thunder-storm was just over, and the waves which it had raised still running with violence, and another storm was now seen coming up in the southwest, far over the lake; but it might be worse in the morning, and we wished to get as far as {{possible}} on our way while we might.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good news. We {{are going}} to take Coimbra, {{tomorrow}} morning. All Massena's sick and wounded, and his heavy baggage are there. They have no suspicion that any force is yet assembled in the neighbourhood and, I expect, we shall have easy work of it. They have a post a mile out of the town. Trant will surprise and capture that, at five in the morning. <b>Just</b> <b>before</b> daybreak <b>we</b> shall enter the town. We must march from here at half-past three." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not--any--doubt--in the world, sir," [...] {{said the}} Mrs. Mollett, {{who claimed to}} be so de jure. [...] "I have got my {{marriage}} lines to show, sir. Abraham's mother was dead <b>just</b> six months <b>before</b> <b>we</b> came together; and then we were married just six months after that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never before}} was {{in deep water}} that seemed so little like real water," [...] said Corny, <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> reached the wharf. [...] "This was cold, {{and that was the}} only thing natural about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{bet that}} auto with Tate and Jackson was here <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> came!" [...] cried Randy. [...] "Those fellows are {{certainly}} on the job. They probably believe that 'possession is nine {{points of the}} law.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... from you, dearest Mrs. Martin, and direct, 'M. Browning, Poste Restante, Pisa'--it is best. <b>Just</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> left Paris I {{wrote to}} my aunt Jane, and from Marseilles to Bummy, but from neither have I heard yet.|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} a method of breech management based {{on the use of}} fetal blood sampling. Twenty-five cases were studied throughout labour, and fetal blood samples taken throughout the first and second stages. These showed that the Apgar score at one minute correlated closely with the fetal pH <b>just</b> <b>before</b> delivery. <b>We</b> believe that cord compression is an important variable factor which can be assessed only by fetal blood sampling. If this shows that fetal anoxia is becoming severe then immediate delivery is mandatory...|$|R
