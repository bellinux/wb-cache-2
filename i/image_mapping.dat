50|$|In 1995, Campus {{began to}} work with video once again, {{producing}} Olivebridge and Mont Desert, working {{for the first time}} with digital video and non-linear editing. This marked the beginning of a series of significant new video works throughout the 1990s and 2000s (decade), many presented in multi-screen monitor formations. These include Winter Journal (1997), By Degrees (1998), Video Ergo Sum (1999) Death Threat (2000), Six Movies (2001) and Time’s Friction (2004-2005). These works explore a complex range of personal themes - loss, memory, death, nature and landscape, the passing of time. Their formal characteristics are marked by Campus’ highly experimental approach to the digital video medium. He uses a range of techniques including multi-layering, superimposition, colour inversion, vanishings and appearances, chroma keying, colourisation, <b>image</b> <b>mapping,</b> pixelation and time manipulation.|$|E
50|$|The data {{obtained}} shows {{the full extent}} of the land surface exposed above the sea floor. This technique is extremely useful as it will play an important role in the major sea floor mapping program. The mapping yields onshore topography as well as under water elevations. Sea floor reflectance imaging is another solution product from this system which can benefit mapping of underwater habitats. This technique has been used for three dimensional <b>image</b> <b>mapping</b> of California's waters using a hydrographic lidar.Drones are now being used with laser scanners, as well as other remote sensors, as a more economical method to scan smaller areas. The possibility of drone remote sensing also eliminates any danger that crews of a manned aircraft may be subjected to in difficult terrain or remote areas.|$|E
50|$|In non-scanning, {{a single}} 2-D sensor output {{contains}} all spatial (x,y) and spectral (λ) data. HSI devices for non-scanning yield the full datacube at once, without any scanning. Figuratively speaking, a single snapshot represents a perspective {{projection of the}} datacube, from which its three-dimensional structure can be reconstructed. The most prominent benefits of these snapshot hyperspectral imaging systems are the snapshot advantage (higher light throughput) and shorter acquisition time. A number of systems have been designed, including computed tomographic imaging spectrometry (CTIS), fiber-reformatting imaging spectrometry (FRIS), integral field spectroscopy with lenslet arrays (IFS-L), multi-aperture integral field spectrometer (Hyperpixel Array), integral field spectroscopy with image slicing mirrors (IFS-S), image-replicating imaging spectrometry (IRIS), filter stack spectral decomposition (FSSD), coded aperture snapshot spectral imaging (CASSI), <b>image</b> <b>mapping</b> spectrometry (IMS), and multispectral Sagnac interferometry (MSI). However, computational effort and manufacturing costs are high.|$|E
