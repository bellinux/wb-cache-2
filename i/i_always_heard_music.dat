6000|$|... "I mean, why don't the French police {{take this}} up if it's {{got to be}} taken up? <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>heard</b> that they were spry enough in their own way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What swift horses {{you must}} have, sir," [...] quoth Blakeney pleasantly. [...] "Lud! {{to think of}} it!... <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>heard</b> that these demmed French horses would never beat ours across country." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Hell, no!' he said. 'Gee, it's {{just what}} you would be, Sam. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>heard</b> youse {{had been one of}} dese rah-rah boys oncest. Say, it's mighty smart of youse to be a perfessor. You're right in on de ground floor.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The therns, I {{judge from}} what you have said, are no less mortal than we; and yet have <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>heard</b> them spoken of with the utmost awe and reverence {{by the people of}} Barsoom, as one might speak of the gods themselves." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My love! I'm sure <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>heard</b> Miss Pinkerton {{say that}} he did not touch them--he only mounted them." [...] "It was called mounting, Mamma.

2500|$|Zimmer {{was born}} in Frankfurt am Main, West Germany. As a young child, he lived in Königstein-Falkenstein, where he played the piano at home but had piano lessons only briefly as he disliked the {{discipline}} of formal lessons. In one of his Reddit AMAs, he said [...] "My formal training was 2 week(s) of piano lessons. I {{was thrown out of}} 8 schools. But I joined a band. I am self-taught. But I've <b>always</b> <b>heard</b> <b>music</b> in my head. And I'm a child of the 20th century; computers came in very handy." [...] He moved to London as a teenager, where he attended Hurtwood House school.|$|R
5000|$|Though I {{have not}} the {{pleasure}} of a personal acquaintance with Salem Ramaswami Mudaliar, M.A., B.L., of the Madras University, <b>I</b> have <b>always</b> <b>heard</b> the best accounts of him as the District Mnsuff of Udiarpallium ...|$|R
6000|$|But for colour and shape, to {{what shall}} we compare it? To {{polished}} cornelian, says Mr. Gosse. I say, {{to one of the}} great red capsicums which hang drying in every Covent-garden seedsman's window. Yet is either simile better than the guess of a certain lady, who, entering a room wherein a couple of Cardium tuberculatum were waltzing about a plate, exclaimed, [...] "Oh dear! <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>heard</b> that my pretty red coral came out of a fish, and here it is all alive!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{dare say}} it is a joke," [...] the old man went on to say. [...] "If I expect to be paid what I have {{expended}} in saving George from being turned loose upon the world without education, I suppose it is a joke. Ha! ha! ha! I never thought of laughing at it before, but now <b>I</b> will. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>heard</b> that you were a joker, Sir Lionel. Ha! ha! ha! I dare say you have laughed at it often enough yourself, eh?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Oh! <b>I</b> have <b>always</b> <b>heard</b> a good {{character}} of the dogs,” returned Mr. Doolittle, quickening his pace by raising each leg in rapid succession, as the hounds scented around his person. “And where is the game, Leather-Stocking?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Tito, no. I am fanciful. Do not heed what I have said. But such {{crimes are}} surely not common in Florence? <b>I</b> have <b>always</b> <b>heard</b> {{my father and}} godfather say so. Have they become {{frequent}} lately?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Colonel Brandon seems a man {{of great}} worth and respectability. <b>I</b> have <b>always</b> <b>heard</b> him spoken of as such, and your brother I know esteems him highly. He is {{undoubtedly}} a sensible man, and in his manners perfectly the gentleman." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "In George Garzone's case, Coltrane {{has never}} been far afield from his own voice. With his band (of 25 years), the Fringe, he {{exercised}} the more free improvisational aspects of Coltrane. As a sideman to Danilo Perez, Joe Lovano, George Russell, Gunther Schuller, Rachel Z, Jack DeJohnette, Billy Hart, and even Jamaaladeen Tacuma <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>heard</b> the Coltrane spirit in his playing. Garzone has always possessed an expansive warm tone that moves from inside to out-jazz with relative ease. Like Trane, his music resonates from what must be a warm and beautiful soul." [...] -Mark Corroto, allaboutjazz.com ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, perhaps I {{need not}} grumble at that; {{but the worst}} of it is that <b>I</b> have <b>always</b> <b>heard</b> that, when a fellow loses on active service, he is sure to make it up again, and perhaps a stone more, after it is over." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Mutteh Ghar, I don't {{know what}} to say to you. You seem but a lad, and a light-hearted one; but you have proved {{yourself}} the best of us all. I was lying next to you, and I will swear that you brought down eight of them with your rifle, before they charged. Even while I was fighting <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>heard</b> your voice, like a trumpet; and after the sergeant had fallen you seemed to take command, as if it was your right. You saved my life when you bayoneted two of the three who were grappling with me, and you seemed to be everywhere." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} {{what it is like to}} lose one's heart, madam," [...] she replied; [...] "but <b>I</b> have <b>always</b> <b>heard</b> that without a heart one cannot live, and if it is broken one must die; and in spite of my poverty I should be sorry not to live." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And not a {{bit like}} what I expected," [...] {{continued}} Clary. [...] "Of course I knew she was good-looking. <b>I</b> had <b>always</b> <b>heard</b> that.

Lester claimed to have been a sperm donor for Jackson in 1996, and announced {{that he was willing to}} take a paternity test to determine whether he was the father. Brian Oxman, former lawyer for the Jackson family, rejected the claim in a television interview, stating, “The thing <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>heard</b> from Michael was that Michael was the father of these children, and I believe Michael." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, doctor, {{not as far}} as <b>I</b> know. I've <b>always</b> <b>'eard</b> that my mother's {{uncle was}} very eccentric, but that wouldn't account for this, because we wasn't related before we married.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You Egyptians {{have large}} mouths. <b>I</b> have <b>always</b> <b>heard</b> it of you. Well, to-day {{we will see}} whether you can kill a fifty-fourth. In an hour when the sun begins to sink, the hounds will be loosed in yonder reeds and since the water is behind them, the lions will come out, and then we shall see." ...|$|R
