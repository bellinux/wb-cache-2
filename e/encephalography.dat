5000|$|The Beagle Boys were {{originally}} created by Carl Barks, {{and made their}} first appearance in the 10-page story The Terror of the Beagle Boys (WDC #134) that {{was first published in}} November 1951. Although the Beagle Boys are only shown very briefly on the last page of this story, it is implied that Scrooge has known about them for a long time. The Beagle Boys are usually depicted as a gang of about three to ten members or more depending on the story, who are identical in appearance and personality. They wear black bandit masks to hide their identities and on their turtleneck sweaters, most often being orange or red, they have their prison number signs. The Beagle Boys are often characterized to be very crude, boastful, aggravating, greedy and self-centered — among themselves however, they are very loyal and have a strong connection of sibling camaraderie. Although, on some occasions they have shown irritation toward each other, often relating to someone making a mistake or saying something that doesn't fit in with the consensus, like one Beagle Boy's (176-167) overly fondness of prunes, a weakness that proves to be the Beagle Boys' downfall in some stories. Interestingly, 176-167's love for prunes makes him the only Beagle Boy with a unique characteristic.The first story to feature the Beagle Boys in a major role is Only a Poor Old Man (Uncle Scrooge #1, March 1952), which serves as a template for virtually all future Beagle Boys appearances, and establishes them as a serious threat to Scrooge's fortune. In the same story they are called [...] "the most awful gang of crooks in the country" [...] by Donald Duck. This most often manifests with them cleverly coming up with various and elaborate schemes to try to break into and steal from Scrooge McDuck's well secured Money Bin. On occasion they are even shown to have highly intellectual capacities, as they are able to earn academic degrees in various fields. Among individual Beagle Boys, some of these degrees include: cranial <b>encephalography,</b> psychology, chemistry, metallurgy and electropyrotechnology. These were often seen by the government as attempts at rehabilitation, but in reality it was a charade by the Beagle Boys to use their newly acquired skills for robberies. They are also experts at trickery, including disguises, and animal training; like using cormorants as aerial bombers, as well as having a large arsenal of various weapons, explosives and machines. When needed, they {{have been shown to be}} able to use force or threats to get what they want. With all things considered however, the Beagle Boys are often attributed not to be as clever they think they are, often gullible to tricks and offensives themselves, and most of their appearances ends with them getting arrested. They are usually imprisoned in Duckburg prisons or Sing Sing, but they have also been jailed in other prisons as well. The Beagle Boys are however proud of their criminal background; never willing to live their lives in accordance to the law.|$|E
40|$|Cerebrospinal fluid {{pressure}} {{was measured in}} twenty-three patients undergoing <b>encephalography.</b> Three different programmes were followed {{to determine the effect}} of nitrous oxide on intracranial pressure with and without injection of air and nitrous oxide into the theca. In every case the initial c. s. f. pressure remained unchanged when nitrous oxide was used for <b>encephalography,</b> while it increased significantly after the inhalation of nitrous oxide with air <b>encephalography.</b> However, this increase always remained within the normal range of c. s. f. pressure and therefore the conclusion is drawn that the use of nitrous oxide in the anaesthetic mixture during <b>encephalography</b> could be followed without any risk in cases of normal intracranial pressure. In cases of high intracranial pressure, and in the presence of nitrous oxide in the anaesthetic gas mixture, the intrathecal use of nitrous oxide instead of air is probably a safer method.

40|$|SUMMARY Real-time {{ultrasound}} {{was used}} to make exact measurements from the lateral wall {{of the body of}} the lateral ventricle to the falx (the ventricular index) in 273 infants of varying gestational ages. The measurement performed in an axial plane through the temporoparietal bone correlated closely with an actual measurement made in coronal plane in 50 infants. A cross-sectional centile chart was drawn up of the normal range for this measurement from 27 to 42 weeks ' postmenstrual age. A further chart showing the rate of change of the ventricular index allowed growth of the ventricles to be assessed in a longitudinal manner. Use of these charts permits early detection of hydrocephalus or dilated ventricles secondary to cerebral atrophy. Visualisation of the cerebral ventricles is essential in investigation of the child with suspected hydro-cephalus.

30|$|After {{success of}} Granger {{causality}} measure, {{the growing number}} of different causality measures have been developed aiming to model brain connectivity patterns. In this article we are investigating methodology of computation and comparisons of different causality measures, which {{was the subject of a}} number of articles devoted to it (e.g. [1]‐[5]). Different measures will induce different brain structural models corresponding to the same neurological data. Comparison of different measures is necessary in order to make precise distinctions among them, which would determine: what and how exactly each of the considered measures is measuring, exact relationship between different measures in specific contexts, when, how and why they coincide or differ, and finally, when and under what conditions they are applicable and when computation of alternative measures can corroborate established connectivity patterns or discern subtle relations. Then, the ways individual computations and comparisons are done becomes important.

Our proposed method is used to separate brain activity from artifacts by Blind source separation using ICA and PSO for learning rate adjustment.
