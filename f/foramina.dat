5|$|The incisive <b>foramina</b> (openings in {{the palate}} between the incisors and the molars) are broad and long, {{extending}} {{to the front}} margins of the first upper molar (M1). Wilfredomys has even longer incisive <b>foramina,</b> extending between the molars, but the <b>foramina</b> are shorter in J.ossitenuis and J.pictipes. The palate itself is wide and short, with its back margin between the M3s. Oryzomyines like Oecomys and Oligoryzomys have longer palates, extending beyond the third molars. Fine openings (<b>foramina)</b> are present on the palate. The back margin of the palate is squared; J.anoblepas lacks a spine {{in the middle of}} the back margin, as is present in Rhipidomys. Wilfredomys has the back margin U-shaped instead and has a longer palate, with the back margin behind the M3s.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{clear evidence}} of hair or fur is in fossils of Castorocauda and Megaconus, from 164 million {{years ago in the}} mid-Jurassic. In the 1950s, it was suggested that the <b>foramina</b> (passages) in the maxillae and premaxillae (bones {{in the front of the}} upper jaw) of cynodonts were channels which supplied blood vessels and nerves to vibrissae (whiskers) and so were evidence of hair or fur; it was soon pointed out, however, that <b>foramina</b> do not necessarily show that an animal had vibrissae, as the modern lizard Tupinambis has <b>foramina</b> that are almost identical to those found in the nonmammalian cynodont Thrinaxodon. Popular sources, nevertheless, continue to attribute whiskers to Thrinaxodon. Studies on Permian coprolites suggest that non-mammalian synapsids of the epoch already had fur, setting the evolution of hairs possibly as far back as dicynodonts.|$|E

30|$|Annular bulging (folding). Degeneration of the nucleous pulposus {{eventually}} {{leads to}} a marked drop in intradiscal pressure resulting in disc space narrowing or collapse with the vertebral bodies moving closer to one another. Increased vertical loading on the annulus fibrosus causes it to bulge or fold radially outward [25 – 27]. Annular bulging (folding) may be symptomatic as severe disc space narrowing also results in decreased size of the intervertebral <b>foraminae,</b> which is further exacerbated by bulging annulus fibrosus (Fig.  11 c). Annular bulging (folding) has never {{been identified as a}} separate entity; however, it is an important finding from the clinical point of view, since the surgical treatment aims to restore the intervertebral disc space rather than microdiscectomy.|$|R

5|$|The {{foramen spinosum}} is a foramen through the sphenoid bone {{situated}} in the middle cranial fossa. It {{is one of two}} <b>foramina</b> in the greater wing of the sphenoid bone. The foramen ovale is one of these two cranial <b>foramina,</b> situated directly anterior and medial to the foramen spinosum. The spine of sphenoid falls medial and posterior to the foramen. Lateral to the foramen is the mandibular fossa, and posterior is the Eustachian tube.|$|E
5|$|The incisive <b>foramina</b> (openings in {{the front}} part of the palate) are medium in length, and do not reach the first molars. Their back margin is angular, not rounded as in eastern voalavo. The {{diastema}} (the gap between the upper incisors and molars) is shorter than in eastern voalavo. The bony palate is broad and lacks notable ridges and other features, except {{for a pair of}} <b>foramina</b> (openings) near the place where the first and second molars (M1 and M2) meet. The back border of the palate is {{at the level of the}} middle of the third molars (M3). In the bony roof of the mesopterygoid fossa, the opening behind the palate, wide sphenopalatine vacuities (openings) are present. A thin alisphenoid strut (a piece of bone on the lower side of the skull separating two <b>foramina)</b> is present in specimens from Marojejy, but not in those from Anjanaharibe-Sud. The tegmen tympani, the roof of the tympanic cavity, is reduced.|$|E
5|$|The incisive <b>foramina,</b> which {{perforate}} {{the front}} {{part of the}} palate, do not extend between the molars. The palate ends beyond the third molars and is perforated by posterolateral palatal pits there. Behind it, {{the roof of the}} mesopterygoid fossa is perforated by poorly developed sphenopalatine vacuities. The auditory bullae, which house the inner ear, are large. Usually, the mastoid bone lacks openings (fenestrae), which are present in T.talamancae. The pattern of the arteries in the head is primitive, as indicated by the condition of various <b>foramina</b> (openings) and grooves in the skull.|$|E
40|$|Widening of the lumbosacral {{spinal canal}} {{was found in}} 63 % of 57 {{patients}} with the Marfan syndrome and in none of 57 age- and sex-matched non-Marfan control patients, who underwent CT scanning for routine clinical indications. The bony abnormalities in mild cases consisted of thinning of the pedicles and taminae and erosion of the neural <b>foraminae</b> and were generally limited to L 5 and S 1. More severe changes were present in 13 patients, two of whom had associated neurologic signs, and included meningoceles or near total erosion of a pedicle. Presence and severity of vertebral abnormalities were associated with neither any other clinical feature nor overall phenotypic severity.

30|$|Complications of disc {{displacement}} may be neurological, vascular or focal. Neurological complications {{are related}} to nerve root and spinal cord compression, which {{are the most common}} complications of disc herniation. At any spinal level, an acute persistent neurological deficit from disc herniation is a medical emergency, which may require surgical decompression. Vascular complications develop secondary to acute or chronic compression of the vertebral artery or medullary segmental arteries feeding the spinal cord (large cervical radiculomedullary at level C 5 –C 7; dominant radiculomedullary artery at T 4 –T 5; the artery of Adamkiewicz located at T 10 and the additional radiculomedullary artery of Deproges-Gotteron arises at the L 4 –L 5 level), which may cause a severe neurological deficit and also may require intervention. Focal complications occur because of long-standing inflammatory changes secondary to persistent fluctuating or chronic hernia, which eventually may lead to extensive epidural scarring (without surgical intervention). Normally, the nerve roots freely move in the <b>foraminae</b> with body movements. Epidural scarring limits nerve root passage through <b>foraminae</b> and may cause nerve root tethering. This process is virtually impossible to identify at imaging. Acute disc sequestration in the settings of adhesions between the ventral wall of the dura and the posterior longitudinal ligament may lead to dural perforation and developing intradural herniation. This is a very rare complication, comprising only 0.27 % of all herniated discs and mostly occurring on the lumbar spine [31, 32]. Epidural vein varicosis, enlargement of epidural veins secondary to disc herniation usually on the lumbar spine, can mimic the clinical signs of disc herniation or spinal stenosis. MRI has been reported to be of high value in demonstrating the dilated epidural vein but the findings might be misinterpreted as herniated nucleus pulposus material [33].|$|R
40|$|Through {{the past}} decades, many {{attempts}} have been made to standardize lumbar disk herniation–related terminology (1, 2). Two different, and not necessarily parallel, sets of charac-teristics of a herniated disk (HD) are taken into account in the reporting of cross-sectional images of the lumbar spine. First, is the absolute attributes of the HD (ie, morphology, location, volume, etc), and second is the relationship of the HD to its neighboring neural structures. The absolute attributes of a HD are only one set of factors that determine the pattern and degree of compromise of the neighboring neural structures. The morphology and cross-sectional areas of the involved lum-bar vertebral and neural <b>foraminae,</b> along with the degree of the epidural fat, are the other determining factors. Although standardized nomenclature has been proposed for the absolute attributes of a HD, descriptive terminology is use...|$|R
5|$|The interorbital {{region is}} 4.14mm {{long and the}} {{zygomatic}} plate is 2.38mm. The diastema (gap) between the incisors and molars is 6.39mm long.

40|$|Aim: It is not {{uncommon}} for vertebral artery injury to occur when there are fractures through the transverse <b>foraminae</b> of the first to the sixth vertebral bodies. Other important risk factors for vertebral artery injury include facet joint dislocations and fractures of the first to the third cervical vertebral bodies. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the pattern and prevalence of vertebral artery injury on CT angiography (CTA) in patients with cervical spine fractures. Method: A retrospective review of patients who had undergone CTA of the vertebral arteries was undertaken. Reports were reviewed to determine which patients met the inclusion criteria of having had both cervical spine fractures and CTA of the vertebral arteries. Images of patients who met the inclusion criteria were analysed by a radiologist. Results: The prevalence of vertebral artery injury was 33 %. Four out of the 11 patients who had vertebral artery injury, had post-traumatic spasm of the artery, with associated thrombosis or occlusion of the vessel. In terms of blunt carotid vertebral injury (BCVI) grading, most of the patients sustained grade IV injuries. Four patients who had vertebral artery injury had fractures of the upper cervical vertebrae, i. e. C 1 to C 3. Fifteen transverse process fractures were associated with vertebral artery injury. No vertebral artery injury was detected in patients who had facet joint subluxations. Conclusion: Patients with transverse process fractures of the cervical spine and upper cervical vertebral body fractures should undergo CTA to exclude vertebral artery injury. </p...|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were: to compare the {{radiographic}} appearance of the neurovascular bundle and its surrounding bone with the actual situation revealed on dissection; to reveal the morphology of the neurovascular bundle in dentate and edentulous subjects; and to note any changes occurring following {{the removal of the}} teeth and the consequent resorption of alveolar bone. Twenty-nine human mandibles were examined; 20 were dry skeletal specimens that were examined radiographically and the remaining nine were radiographed then dissected after decalcification and the branches of the inferior alveolar nerve were identified, sketched, and photographed. Different patterns of identifying characteristics of the mandibular canal were noted on the radiographs, ranging from alternating bands of radiopacity and radiolucency to continuous radiopaque lines. Dissections indicated that the radiographic appearance related to the number, distribution, and pattern of trabeculae around the canal. The dissections revealed that in all cases, the main nerve divided into its incisive and mental branches in the molar area well before reaching the mental foramen. A branch to the molar teeth, and in two instances to the second premolar as well, was given off from the main trunk before it divided into incisive and mental branches. In the dentate specimens, the neurovascular bundle formed two distinct curvatures, one between the mandibular and mental <b>foraminae</b> and the other between the mental foramen and the incisor teeth apices. In the edentulous specimens, the neurovascular bundle was reduced in size and although some small nerve branches, notably to the molar areas, were distinguishable, the blood vessels seemed to have atrophied beyond macroscopic identification. This project confirmed the inaccuracy of descriptions repeated in many anatomical textbooks suggesting that the inferior alveolar branch of the trigeminal nerve divides at the mental foramen into its incisive and mental branches and that during their path through the body of the mandible they give off fibers to the individual teeth. It further confirmed that the neurovascular bundle reduces in size quite markedly after removal of teeth and that the vascular component cannot be clearly identified...|$|R
5|$|The incisive <b>foramina</b> (openings in {{the front}} part of the palate) are short, not {{extending}} between the first molars. The posterolateral palatal pits (small openings {{at the back of}} the palate, near the third molars) are poorly developed. The mesopterygoid fossa, the gap behind the back margin of the palate, does not usually reach forward between the maxillaries. Its roof either is wholly ossified or contains small sphenopalatine vacuities. Unlike in some other oryzomyines, the buccinator-masticatory foramen and the foramen ovale accessorium, two <b>foramina</b> (openings) in the skull, are not separated by an alisphenoid strut. The pattern of grooves and <b>foramina</b> in the skull indicates that the circulation of the arteries of the head follows the primitive pattern, as in most similar species but unlike in Hylaeamys. Usually, the mastoid bone contains small openings (fenestrations) in T.talamancae, but not in T.bolivaris. In the mandible (lower jaw), the capsular process (a process at the root of the incisor) is weak to absent and the upper and lower masseteric ridges, which anchor some of the chewing muscles, do not join into a single crest and reach their front margin below the first molar.|$|E
5|$|The incisive <b>foramina,</b> which {{perforate}} {{the palate}} between the incisors and the molars, are short {{and do not}} reach near the first molars; they are longer in T.hylophilus. They are widest where the premaxillary and maxillary bones meet. The palate itself is also short, not extending beyond the third molars, and is broad and lacks ridges or grooves. There are simple posterolateral palatal pits {{at the back of}} the palate, near the third molars. The mesopterygoid fossa, an opening located behind the end of the palate, is broad and its roof is either fully ossified or perforated by small sphenopalatine vacuities where the presphenoid and basisphenoid bones meet. An alisphenoid strut separates two <b>foramina</b> (openings) at the base of the skull, the buccinator-masticatory foramen and the foramen ovale accessorium. The pattern of grooves and <b>foramina</b> on the head indicates that the circulation of the arteries in the head of T.ucucha follows the primitive pattern. The tegmen tympani, the roof of the tympanic cavity, overlaps the suspensory process of the squamosal bone. At the back of the mandible (lower jaw), there is a capsular process to receive the root of the lower incisor, which is absent in T.hylophilus.|$|E
5|$|Compared to E.nitidus and E.macconnelli, {{the skull}} is {{relatively}} small and slender. It has broad and short incisive <b>foramina</b> (perforations of the palate between the incisors and the molars) and lacks sphenopalatine vacuities which perforate the mesopterygoid fossa, the gap behind {{the end of the}} palate. The animal is similar to other members of the genus in the pattern of the arteries of the head. The alisphenoid strut, an extension of the alisphenoid bone which separates two <b>foramina</b> (openings) in the skull (the masticatory-buccinator foramen and the foramen ovale accessorium) is rarely present; its presence is more frequent in E.nitidus.

40|$|No tratamento endodôntico a presença de bactérias é a maior preocupação. A presença de bactérias nos túbulos dentinários, <b>foraminas</b> apicais e no delta apical é considerado como falha de procedimento. Alguns estudos revelam que após o tratamento endodôntico em sessão única, bactérias ainda permanecem em estruturas dentais. O objetivo do presente estudo foi avaliar o tratamento endodôntico em uma ou duas sessões, usando hidróxido de cálcio associado ao paramonoclorofenol canforado (PMCC) como "curativo de demora". Foram utilizados quatro cães, onde dois animais foram submetidos a tratamento em sessão única e os outros em duas sessões. Foram utilizados no estudo 40 dentes: segundo e terceiro pré-molares superiores e segundo, terceiro e quarto pré-molares inferiores divididos em dois grupos. Foi realizada abertura coronária dos dentes, expondo a câmara pulpar por 60 dias. Após este período o grupo tratado em sessão única foi obturado com guta-percha e óxido de zinco e eugenol e o grupo tratado em duas sessões recebeu o PMCC que permaneceu no canal por 30 dias e, após, foi obturado com o mesmo {{material}} do outro grupo. Controle clínico e radiográfico foram realizados quinzenalmente e após 60 dias foi retirado um bloco contendo dente e periodonto para análise histopatológica e microbiológica. A análise histopatológica revelou intensa resposta inflamatória em todos os grupos. A análise microbiológica apresentou redução microbiana mais acentuada no grupo tratado em sessão única. Contudo, bactérias ainda foram observadas nos dois grupos evidenciando que nenhum tratamento utilizado foi totalmente eficiente. During a {{root canal}} therapy the microbiota {{is the major}} concern. Bacteria present in dentinal tubules, apical foramens and apical delta is related to failure of this procedure. Some studies reveal that during endodontic treatment in one session bacteria still remain in dental structures. The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the endodontic treatment in one or two sessions, using calcium hydroxide plus camphorated paramonochlorophenol (CMCP) with temporary endodontic medicaments. Four dogs were used, and two animals were submitted the treatment in one session only and the others in two sessions. Premolar teeth were used in this study: second and third upper premolar teeth and second, third and fourth lower premolar teeth were divided into two groups. Opening of the pulp chamber was performed with burns, and the pulp was exposed for 60 days. After this period the group treated in only session was obtured with gutta-percha and zinc oxide and eugenol, and the group treated in two sessions received the CMCP that remained in the canal per 30 days and was afterwards obtured with the material of the other group. Clinical and radiographical control was performed twice a week, and after 60 days a small block containing the teeth, surrounding periapical tissues and the periodontium was removed for histological and microbiological study. Histological analysis revealed intense inflammatory response in both groups. Microbiological analysis showed a more severe microbial reduction in the group treated in one session. However, bacteria were still observed in the two groups, indicating that none of the treatments presented total efficiency...|$|R

Furthermore, the incisive <b>foramina,</b> openings in the front part of the palate, extend to a point between the first molars, and the palate is short, with its back margin between the third molars. The living species of Juliomys differ from J.anoblepas in various characters, including shorter incisive <b>foramina</b> in two species and the shape of the zygomatic arch (cheekbone) in J.anoblepas. The upper molar row is 4.13mm long, which makes J.anoblepas the largest known species of Juliomys.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys nelsoni was {{distinctive}} in {{its large}} skull with broad, well-developed incisors {{and a strong}} front part (rostrum) that is strongly curved downwards.

5|$|The incisive <b>foramina</b> (openings in {{the front}} part of the palate) are long, {{sometimes}} extending to between the first molars (M1). The bony palate is broad and short, with the posterior margin between the third molars (M3). Nephelomys levipes is the only other oryzomyine with such a short palate, although that of Eremoryzomys polius is only slightly longer. The posterolateral palatal pits (openings in the back part of the palate near the M3) vary from small to fairly large and are located in slight fossas (depressions). In Eremoryzomys, these fossas are deeper. The roof of the mesopterygoid fossa, the opening behind the palate, is completely closed or contains small sphenopalatine vacuities. The vacuities are much larger in Eremoryzomys. The alisphenoid strut, a piece of bone that separates two <b>foramina</b> (openings), is present in all Drymoreomys specimens examined, except in one juvenile specimen.|$|E
5|$|The incisive <b>foramina</b> (openings in {{the front}} part of the palate) are short and do not reach between the first molars; they are longer in H.alfaroi.

The posterolateral palatal pits, which {{perforate}} the palate near the third molars, are small, and {{may or may not be}} recessed into a fossa. The sphenopalatine vacuities (openings in the roof of the mesopterygoid fossa, behind the palate) are also small, as are the auditory bullae. As in most oryzomyines, the subsquamosal fenestra, an opening at the back of the skull, is present. The pattern of grooves and <b>foramina</b> (openings) in the skull indicates that the circulation of the arteries of the head in T.talamancae follows the primitive pattern, as in most similar species but unlike in Hylaeamys.|$|E
5|$|The incisive <b>foramina,</b> {{openings}} in the front part of the palate, reach backward between the molars. The palate is long, extending substantially beyond the third molars, the usual condition in oryzomyines. The back part, near the third molars, is usually perforated by prominent posterolateral palatal pits, which are recessed into fossae (depressions). Sphenopalatine vacuities are usually absent, but {{have been reported in}} some populations. There is no alisphenoid strut, an extension of the alisphenoid bone that in some oryzomyines separates two <b>foramina</b> in the skull. The condition of the arteries in the head is highly derived. The subsquamosal fenestra, an opening in the back part of the skull determined by the shape of the squamosal bone, is present. The squamosal lacks a suspensory process that contacts the tegmen tympani, the roof of the tympanic cavity, a defining character of oryzomyines. There are some {{openings in}} the mastoid bone.|$|E
5|$|The skull looks delicate. The interorbital region (between the eyes) is {{narrow and}} hourglass-shaped, and the braincase is smooth; both lack conspicuously {{developed}} ridges and shelves.

The bony palate ends {{at the level of}} the back of the third upper molars. The alisphenoid strut (a piece of bone at the back of the skull separating two <b>foramina,</b> or openings) is absent. The strut is present in most Eliurus, but absent in some specimens of E.grandidieri. The subsquamosal fenestrae (openings in the squamosal bone) are fairly large. The auditory bullae are small. The incisors are weak and the enamel on the upper incisors is yellow to light orange. The root of the lower incisor does not project into a distinct capsular process at the back of the mandible (lower jaw), a feature shared only with E.grandidieri among species of Eliurus.|$|E
5|$|The skull shows a short {{front part}} (rostrum) {{and a broad}} interorbital region (located between the eyes). The roof of the braincase is marked by supraorbital shelves.
