40|$|The {{hydraulic}} {{interception efficiency}} of a <b>gully</b> <b>grating</b> decreases with the steepness {{of the road}} on which it is installed. This {{can lead to a}} higher potential for flooding at the downstream area of a steep road. In this study, the hydraulic inception efficiency of several types of gully gratings on steep roads, including a new grating with angled bars on a parallelogram cross-section was investigated experimentally. The experimental results for all test gratings show that the hydraulic interception efficiency varies linearly with a non-dimensional parameter expressed as a product of the Froude number, water depth to grating length ratio and flow width to grating width ratio. The empirical relationship can be easily included in numerical models for the detailed study and design of storm water drainage systems. The hydraulic performance of the grating with longitudinal bars and the new grating with angled bars on a parallelogram cross-section was better than that of the existing grating. The relative increase in the efficiency increases with the flow velocity, depth and width. While gratings with longitudinal bars may induce inconvenience to cyclists, gratings with angled bars on a parallelogram cross-section may be used on steep roads to enhance the hydraulic interception efficiency of gullies.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} a floor <b>gully</b> come with <b>grating</b> to prevent the oviposition of Aedes aegypti in the floor trap. In order to conduct the test, two containers were placed into a mosquito cage (30 cm × 30 cm × 30 cm). Both containers were filled with declorinated seasoned tap water and covered with floor <b>gully</b> c/w <b>grating</b> and normal floor gully, respectively. A total of 50 gravid Ae. aegypti females were then released into the cage and left for a week. All the eggs obtained from the test were allowed to remain inside the containers for the eggs to hatch. The number of hatched larvae was counted and recorded. Five replicates were conducted concurrently. There was a significant difference of Ae. aegypti larvae obtained between container with floor <b>gully</b> c/w <b>grating</b> and normal floor gully (p < 0. 05). A total of 96. 41 % reduction of Ae. aegypti larvae was obtained in the container with floor <b>gully</b> c/w <b>grating</b> compared with the normal floor gully, indicating that the floor <b>gully</b> c/w <b>grating</b> used in this study was able to prevent oviposition of Ae. aegypti in holding water...|$|R
