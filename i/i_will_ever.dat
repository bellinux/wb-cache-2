At {{the time of his}} death, Scott was in a {{relationship}} with Kristin Spodobalski. During his Jimmy V Award speech, he told his teenage daughters: [...] "Taelor and Sydni, I love you guys more than <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>ever</b> be able to express. You two are my heartbeat.

500|$|What I went through, only <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>ever</b> know. My {{knee cap}} {{completely}} {{turned to the}} right, a ball of blood forming on my leg and the bone that broke, {{without being able to}} move my body. And the pain, a pain that I wouldn't wish on anyone. The surgeon placed a big support [...] in my leg, because the bone had moved so much. Breaking a femur is always serious in itself but an open break in an athlete of high level going flat out, that tears the muscles. At 180 beats , there was a colossal amount of blood being pumped, which meant my leg was full of blood. I'm just grateful that the artery was untouched.|$|E
500|$|During {{press for}} the popular 2015 film Straight Outta Compton, {{questions}} about the portrayal and behavior of Dr. Dre and other prominent figures in the rap community about violence against women – and the question about its absence in the film – were raised. The discussion about the film led to Dr. Dre addressing his past behavior in the press. In August 2015, {{in an interview with}} Rolling Stone, Dre lamented his abusive past, saying, [...] "I made some fucking horrible mistakes in my life. I was young, fucking stupid. I would say all the allegations aren't true—some of them are. Those {{are some of the things}} that I would like to take back. It was really fucked up. But I paid for those mistakes, and there's no way in hell that <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>ever</b> make another mistake like that again." ...|$|E

500|$|Calvin's friends {{urged him}} to marry. Calvin took a prosaic view, writing to one correspondent:I, who have the air of being so hostile to celibacy, I am still not married and {{do not know whether}} <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>ever</b> be. If I take a wife it will be because, being better freed from {{numerous}} worries, I can devote myself to the Lord. Several candidates were presented to him including one young woman from a noble family. Reluctantly, Calvin agreed to the marriage, on the condition that she would learn French. Although a wedding date was planned for March 1540, he remained reluctant and the wedding never took place. He later wrote that he would never think of marrying her, [...] "unless the Lord had entirely bereft me of my wits". Instead, in August of that year, he married Idelette de Bure, a widow who had two children from her first marriage.|$|E
500|$|Rand's first {{published}} novel, the semi-autobiographical We the Living, {{was published in}} 1936. Set in Soviet Russia, it focused on the struggle {{between the individual and}} the state. In a 1959 foreword to the novel, Rand stated that We the Living [...] "is as near to an autobiography as <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>ever</b> write. It is not an autobiography in the literal, but only in the intellectual sense. The plot is invented, the background is not..." [...] Initial sales were slow and the American publisher let it go out of print, although European editions continued to sell. After the success of her later novels, Rand was able to release a revised version in 1959 that has since sold over three million copies. In 1942, without Rand's knowledge or permission, the novel was made into a pair of Italian films, Noi vivi and Addio, Kira. Rediscovered in the 1960s, these films were re-edited into a new version which was approved by Rand and re-released as We the Living in 1986.|$|E
500|$|The film {{originally}} {{had a different}} ending to the one later released in America under the title Shades of Fear. Miramax co-founder Harvey Weinstein requested that the ending be reworked prior to distribution, and Winterson was highly unhappy at being asked to write an additional conclusionary scene. Winterson's preferred ending sees Rex Goodyear burn the painting he believes to be fraudulent, only to discover he actually had the genuine item in his possession all along, and has now destroyed it. This ties in with the major theme of the film in Winterson's eyes, whereby [...] "Duncan, Gabriel, Miss Bead and Miss Quim all find something valuable where they least expected it, Rex Goodyear finds that the things we value are very often worthless." [...] Winterson has called Weinstein [...] "a bully who knows the gentle touch", referring to the new ending as [...] "the most expensive words <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>ever</b> write". While she believes that the new ending is satisfying, she feels the film has lost some dimensions which were important to her and concludes: [...] "It is a good movie {{but it is not}} the movie I thought we could make. [...] I do like Great Moments but there is another film in there somewhere that has got lost." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{show was}} punctuated by fantasy {{sequences}} {{in which his}} character performed his thoughts as a stand-up routine in a small club. In the commentary and the interview on the DVD, Bathurst says that {{he was told that}} they would be re-shot after filming everything else, an idea abandoned because of the expense. He has an idea of re-filming the sequences 'now', as his older self, to give them a more retrospective feeling. He has also said that he believes Mark was too [...] "designery" [...] and wishes that he had [...] "roughened him up a bit". The role is his favourite of his whole career; he has described it as [...] "the most enjoyable job <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>ever</b> do" [...] and considers several episodes of the series to be [...] "timeless, beautifully constructed farces which will endure". Bathurst is often recognised for his appearance in this series, mentioning that [...] "Drunks stop me on public transport and tell me details of the plot of their favourite episode". As punishment for arriving late for the series one press launch at the Café Royal in Regent Street, London, writer Steven Moffat pledged to write an episode in which Mark is naked throughout. To a large extent, this vow is realised in the second series.|$|E

2500|$|Between 1958 and 1961 Ōe {{published}} {{a series of}} works incorporating sexual metaphors for the occupation of Japan. He summarised the common theme of these stories as [...] "the relationship of a foreigner as the big power , a Japanese who {{is more or less}} placed in a humiliating position , and, sandwiched between the two, the third party [...] (sometimes a prostitute who caters only to foreigners or an interpreter)". In each of these works, the Japanese X is inactive, failing to take the initiative to resolve the situation and showing no psychological or spiritual development. The graphically sexual nature of this group of stories prompted a critical outcry; Ōe said of the culmination of the series Our Times, [...] "I personally like this novel [...] I do not think <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>ever</b> write another novel which is filled only with sexual words." ...|$|E

American hip-hop artist Snoop Dogg was to appear on one of the new songs recorded for the US album.

[...] After being part of the inaugural judging panel on the first season of reality TV show, The X Factor USA, the following year in 2012, Scherzinger crossed the Atlantic to judge (and win) the [...] ninth series of the British edition of The X Factor. Whilst deciding whether or not to return to tenth series, Scherzinger unveiled that she had been working on her second studio album due for a global release in November 2013. This officially signaled the end of the Killer Love era, and resulting in the cancellation of the album's US release.|$|E
2500|$|Ward {{was killed}} in the Battle of Cixi and his {{successor}} H. A. Burgevine, an American was disliked by the Imperial Chinese authorities. Burgevine was an unsavory character known for his greed and for being an alcoholic. Moreover, Burgevine made little effort to hide his racism, and his relations with the Chinese were very difficult at the best of times. Li Hongzhang, the governor of the Jiangsu province, requested Staveley to appoint a British officer to command the contingent. Staveley selected Gordon, who had been made a brevet major in December 1862 and the nomination was approved by the British government. Given Burgevine's alcoholism, open corruption, and a tendency to engage in acts of mindless violence when drunk, the Chinese wanted [...] "a man of good temper, of clean hands and a steady economist" [...] as his replacement. These requirements led Staveley to choose Gordon. Li was impressed with Gordon, writing:It is a direct blessing from Heaven, the coming of this British Gordon. ... He is superior in manner and bearing to any of the foreigners whom I have come into contact with, and does not show outwardly that conceit which makes most of them repugnant in my sight...What an elixir for a heavy heart-to see this splendid Englishman fight! ... If there is anything that I admire nearly as much as the superb scholarship of Zeng Guofan, it is the military qualities of this fine officer. He is a glorious fellow!...With his many faults, his pride, his temper, and his never-ending demand for money – but he is a noble man, and in spite of all I have said to him or about him, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>ever</b> think most highly of him. ... He is an honest man, but difficult to get on with. Gordon was honest and incorruptible, and unlike many Chinese officers, did not steal the money that was meant to pay his men, but rather insisted on paying the Ever Victorious Army on time and in full. Gordon's insistence on paying his men meant that he always pressing the Imperial government for money, something which often irritated the mandarins who did not understand why Gordon did not just let his men loot and plunder as a compensation for wages. Gordon designed the uniform for the Ever Victorious Army, which consisted of black boots together with turbans, jackets and trousers that were all green while his personal bodyguard of 300 men wore blue uniforms.|$|E
