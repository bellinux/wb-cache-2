40|$|Aircraft {{landing gears}} support the {{aircraft}} during ground operations, including take-off, landing impact, taxiing, <b>gate</b> <b>handling</b> and maintenance. Mostly {{for reasons of}} minimum mass and ground clearance, landing gears are slender structures which exhibit a considerable dynamic response to ground load excitations. As the landing gear {{is one of the}} few systems on the aircraft without redundancies, the knowledge of landing gear dynamics is crucial for aircraft design and aircraft safety. Simulation of landing gear dynamics is a cornerstone of aircraft loads analysis, as well for vertical loads resulting from touch-down as for longitudinal and lateral loads resulting from braking, steering and towing. Another important field of interest is landing gear vibrations like gear walk and shimmy. Those phenomena can be brake induced or result from tire spin-up at touchdown or simply from a coupling of dynamics of the running tire and structural mechanics of the landing gear leg. All those effects strongly depend on a number of parameters such as aircraft speed, landing gear vertical deflection, tire pressure and wear of the parts. Many of those parameters can only be estimated and might change during the operation of the aircraft. Numerical investigation is thus a challenging task. Analysis methods exist both in the frequency domain and in the time domain. As stability analysis is straight forward in frequency domain methods, this approach is still often used. However, in many cases nonlinearities are dominant which lead to limit-cycle characteristics of the vibrations. Here, multibody modelling or a mixture of multibody and finite element modelling including time domain simulation is used. In the article, a general outline is given of how vibration problems in landing gears can be treated by numerical analysis methods. The article will start with a classification of typical problems, give a short overview of classical papers, and explain typical approaches. In addition, alternative approaches for stability analysis and for the detection of limit-cycle oscillations as well as state-of-the-art modelling approaches will be presented...|$|R

40|$|We {{deal with}} {{monotone}} inclusion {{problems of the}} form 0 ∈ Ax+Dx+N_C(x) in real Hilbert spaces, where A is a maximally monotone operator, D a cocoercive operator and C the nonempty set of zeros of another cocoercive operator. We propose a forward-backward penalty algorithm for solving this problem which extends the one proposed by H. Attouch, M. -O. Czarnecki and J. Peypouquet in [3]. The condition which guarantees the weak ergodic convergence of the sequence of iterates generated by the proposed scheme is formulated {{by means of the}} Fitzpatrick function associated to the maximally monotone operator that describes the set C. In the second part we introduce a forward-backward-forward algorithm for monotone inclusion problems having the same structure, but this time by replacing the cocoercivity hypotheses with Lipschitz continuity conditions. The latter penalty type algorithm opens the <b>gate</b> to <b>handle</b> monotone inclusion problems with more complicated structures, for instance, involving compositions of maximally monotone operators with linear continuous ones.
