40|$|The International Council on Alcohol, Drugs, and Traffic Safety (ICADTS) classifies the {{impairing}} {{properties of}} medicinal drugs on driving performance {{into one of}} three categories; presumed safe (I), moderate adverse effects (II), and potentially dangerous (III). In the Netherlands for example, the percentage of chronic ICADTS III users in the population {{is estimated to be}} around 6 % for sleeping medication and 10 % for antidepressants, and increases with age. However, the classification is largely based on pharmacological studies of brief drug use on healthy subjects. Not enough is known about the impairing effects on chronic drug users who may develop a tolerance for side effects and thus could be fit to drive. The primary goal the current research is to determine if fitness to drive can be assessed from (1) a <b>highway</b> <b>ride</b> focusing on lane keeping performance, (2) a neurological test battery focusing on perceptual functioning, executive functions, and vigilance, and (3) a driving simulator ride focusing on navigating intersections, merging on the motorway, and lane keeping performance. For this, 120 chronic ICADTSIII drug users will be recruited and compared to a matched control group. The fitness to drive norms may be used to individualise driving advice for patients...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: There are {{difficulties}} {{associated with}} near-real time or frequent pavement monitoring, {{because it is}} time consuming and costly. This study aimed to develop a binary logit model {{for the evaluation of}} <b>highway</b> <b>riding</b> quality, which could be used to monitor pavement conditions. The model was applied to investigate the influence of backscattering values of Phase Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR). Training data obtained during 3 – 7 May 2007 was used in the development process, together with actual international roughness index (IRI) values collected along a highway in Ayutthaya province, Thailand. The analysis showed that an increase in the backscattering value in the HH or the VV polarization indicated the poor condition of the pavement surface and, of the two, the HH polarization is more suitable for developing riding quality evaluation. The model developed was applied to analyze highway number 3467, to demonstrate its capability. It was found that the assessment accuracy of the prediction of the highway level of service was 97. 00 %. This is a preliminary study of the proposed technique and more intensive investigation must be carried out using ALOS/PALSAR images in various seasons...|$|R
5000|$|Hershner {{purchased}} a new Zero S ZF9 electric motorcycle from Hollywood Electrics on April 26, 2012. It had {{a range of}} up to 114 miles {{in the city and}} 63 miles with half city/half <b>highway</b> <b>riding.</b> [...] To increase this, Hershner modified his electric motorcycle to increase charging capacity and extend the driving range. He initially added an SAE J1772 charging socket, and three onboard 1 kW battery chargers to raise the total onboard charging to 4 kW. Using the public charging electric vehicle network, he tested the modifications first on a 500-mile trip to Miami, FL, and then a 1200-mile trip to the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Manchester, TN, which he said was the longest distance ridden on an electric motorcycle at that time. After these two long-distance trips, Hershner made additional modifications by adding two 2500 watt Elcon chargers to the Zero to max out the available power from a public charging station to charge at 7.2 kW from level 2 and 1.8 kW from level 1 for 9 kW combined charging, reducing the charge time to one hour to recharge his 9 kWh ZF9 pack.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—To manage ever {{increasing}} traffic volume on modern highways, transportation agencies have introduced special managed lanes where only vehicles {{with a certain}} occupancy level are allowed. This encourages <b>highway</b> users to <b>ride</b> together, thus, in theory, more efficiently transporting people through the highway system. In order to be effective, however, adherence to the vehicle occupancy rules has to be enforced. Recent {{studies have shown that}} the traditional approach of dispatching traffic law enforcement officers to perform roadside visual inspections is not only expensive and dangerous, but also ineffective for managed lane enforcement. In this paper, we describe an image-based machine learning approach for automatic or semi-automatic vehicle occupancy detection. Our method localizes windshield regions by constructing an elastic deformation model from sets of uniquely defined landmark points along the front windshield. From the localized windshield region, the method calculates image-level feature representations, which are then applied to a trained classifier for classifying the vehicle into violator and non-violator classes.

60|$|I gladly let him assist Demetria to {{her seat}} on the side-saddle, for that was perhaps the last {{personal}} service {{he would be able}} to render her. The poor old fellow was crying, I believe, his utterance was so husky.

We then trotted softly away over the sward, and in about half an hour struck the road leading from Rocha to Montevideo. This we followed till daylight, scarcely pausing once from our swift gallop, and a hundred times during that dark ride over a country utterly unknown to me I blessed the little witch Cleta; for never was there a more steady, sure-footed beast than the ugly roan that carried my companion, and when we drew rein in the pale morning light he seemed fresh as when we started. We then left the <b>highway</b> and <b>rode</b> across country in a north-westerly direction for a distance of eight or nine miles, for I was anxious to be far away from public roads and from the prying, prating people that use them. About eleven o'clock that morning we had breakfast at a rancho, then rode on again till we came to a forest of scattered thorn-trees growing on the slopes of a range of hills. It was a wild, secluded spot, with water and good pasturage for the horses and pleasant shade for ourselves; so, after unsaddling and turning loose our horses to feed, we sat down to rest under a large tree with our backs against its portly trunk. From our shady retreat we commanded a splendid view of the country over which we had been riding all the morning, extending for many leagues behind us, and while I smoked my cigar I talked to my companion, calling her attention to the beauty of that wide, sunlit prospect.|$|R
40|$|Today, Sport Utility Vehicles are {{marketed as}} both on-road and {{off-road}} vehicles. This {{results in a}} compromise when designing the suspension of the vehicle. If the suspension characteristics are fixed, the vehicle cannot have good handling capabilities on <b>highways</b> and good <b>ride</b> comfort over rough terrain. The rollover propensity {{of this type of}} vehicle compared to normal cars is high because it has a combination of a high centre of gravity and a softer suspension. The 4 State Semi-active Suspension System (4 S 4) that can switch between two discrete spring characteristics as well as two discrete damper characteristics, has been proven to overcome this compromise. The soft suspension setting (soft spring and low damping) is used for ride comfort, while the hard suspension setting (stiff spring and high damping) is used for handling. The following question arises: when is which setting most appropriate? The two main contributing factors are the terrain profile and the driver’s actions. Ride comfort is primarily dependant on the terrain that the vehicle is travelling over. If the terrain can be identified, certain driving styles can be expected for that specific environment. The terrains range from rough and uncomfortable to smooth with high speed manoeuvring. Terrain classification methods are proposed and tested with measured data from the test vehicle on known terrain types. Good results were obtained from the terrain classification methods. Five terrain types were accurately identified from over an hour’s worth of vehicle testing. Handling manoeuvres happen unexpectedly, often to avoid an accident. To improve the handling and therefore safety of the vehicle, the 4 S 4 can be switched to the hard suspension setting, which results in a reduced body roll angle. This decision should be made quickly with the occupants’ safety as the priority. Methods were investigated that will determine when to switch the suspension to the handling mode based on the kinematics of the vehicle. The switching strategies proposed in this study have the potential, with a little refinement, to make the ride versus handling decision correctly. Copyright 2007, University of Pretoria.

40|$|The aim of {{the user}} related {{assessment}} is to evaluate the effects on driver behaviour, reactions to and acceptance of the driver assistance system: Continuous Support (CS) function developed by CRF {{within the framework of}} SECONDS subproject. The CS function continuously evaluates the status of the host vehicle as well as the surrounding traffic based on the information of the on-board sensors. When the CS function detects a hazard, the function issues a warning to the driver. The warning status increases continuously depending on the degree of the hazard (at higher degree of hazard also sounds and active feedbacks are activated in the safety belt). The CS function provides the following warning to the driver: - In a situation with the actual speed above the speed limit, the display shows the speed limit icon. - In a situation with too high speed when approaching a curve, as pre-warning, the visual display shows a yellow curve; as imminent warning, the display shows a red curve icon, alarm sound is activated and the safety belt is tensioned. - In a situation with risk for a forward collision, as pre-warning, the display shows a yellow obstacle icon; as imminent warning, the display shows a red obstacle icon, alarm sound is activated and the safety belt is tensioned. - In a situation with a vehicle in the blind spot, as pre-warning, the display shows a yellow blind-spot obstacle icon; as imminent warning, the display shows a red blind-spot obstacle icon. Twenty four persons (13 males and 11 females) - employees at CRF (persons not directly involved in the interactIVe project) took part in the test drives. The test drivers drove twice along the test route of an approximate length of 53 km, containing rural road and motorway sections. The order of driving was balanced {{in such a way that}} every other subject drove first with the system switched off and then with the system switched on. For the following subject the order of driving was reversed. The test vehicle was equipped with logging facilities and a number of variables were logged. The test drivers were observed by means of an in-car observation method (Wiener Fahrprobe) by two observers, riding along in the car with the driver, where one of the observers (called the coding observer) studies standardised variables such as speed behaviour, yielding behaviour, lane changes and interaction with other road users. The other observer carries out ‘‘free observations’’ such as conflicts, communication and special events that are hard to predict, let alone to standardise. Questionnaires were used to assess the drivers’ comprehension of and experiences with the system, their subjective workload, the usefulness and satisfaction of the system, perceived benefits of the system, as well as willingness to have and pay for the system. The findings revealed that the test drivers did not alter their general speed behaviour when driving with the system compared to driving without the system, see Table S. 1. It has to be mentioned, that the speed warnings frequently displayed erroneous speed limits at some parts of the route, which also was commented by the test drivers. The legal speed limit was equal to the speed limit indicated by the system of approximately 60 % of the route length. The speed limit reported by the system was over the legal speed limit along 28 % of the route, and below the legal speed limit along 10 % of the route. There was no change in the number or in the length of speed warnings when driving without and with the system. The profiles of speeds and accelerations before and after a forward collision warning was triggered illustrate, that when the warning was issued, the driver had already started to decrease the speed. This indicates that the warning was issued too late to have any effect on the driver. Consequently, driver reaction time to the warning could not be analysed. Due to curve speed warnings, the test drivers passed the roundabout with a statistically significantly (p<= 0. 05) lower speed when driving with the system. There was some tendency for increased number and length of forward collision warnings when driving with the system, but the difference was statistically not significant (p= 0. 5). There was no difference either in the number or in the length of the side collision warnings neither form left or right when driving without and with the system. Driving too fast according to the situation and/or the speed limits was observed statistically significantly less often during the rides with the system active. Driving too far to the right side and dangerous lane changes were observed statistically significantly less often on the rides with the system active. The test persons chose a wrong lane when driving through an intersection or roundabout less frequently, when driving with the system active. On the negative side, it can be noted that slightly more late adaptations of speed before intersections and obstacles were observed while driving with the system. Statistically significantly more errors regarding dangerous distance to the side were observed with the system active. Only during driving with the system active it was observed that the test persons turned with too high speed. No major differences were found regarding speed choice when driving with or without the system. The test persons drove over the speed limit (on rural roads and on <b>highways)</b> on both <b>rides.</b> Also, the test persons drove too fast through curves and approached a roundabout or drove through it too fast, as well as they accelerated before leaving the roundabout to the same extent on both rides. Bad adaptation of speed before intersections and obstacles, driving too slowly, incorrect lane choice before intersections and sticking to own priority was observed in equal numbers on both rides, with and without the system. No statistically significant differences between the two rides could be shown regarding dangerous distance keeping to the vehicle in front, illegal or aborted overtaking manoeuvres, correct indicating behaviour, driving too far to the left or drifting or crossing the solid line, late or hesitant lane change before an intersection, crossing a stop line at intersections or roundabouts, driving against yellow at a traffic light, yield behaviour and ignoring pedestrians/cyclists. Regarding interaction behaviour with other road users, hardly any differences could be observed. Situations on both rides were noted where the test persons either made errors in the interaction processes or showed respectful behaviour towards other road users. On both rides, situations were observed in which the test persons did not choose the correct speed, drove without foresight or too close to other road users, showed unclear behaviour to other road users or did not behave correctly in overtaking manoeuvres. The test persons also showed respectful behaviour towards other road users on both rides by giving way in different situations or adapted their speed and lateral position well...|$|R
