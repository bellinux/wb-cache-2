The basalt application was mixed at 0, 1, 5, 25, and 50 t/ha to cover situations of moderate applications as well as where the amendment might be banded to achieve high local concentrations.

Selected treatments were then subjected to a strong leaching environment to assess the longevity of the effects obtained. Soil properties remained virtually unchanged by the leaching treatment, except that significant amounts of monovalent K and Na were removed.

The effects of temperature, RH, grain commodity (wheat, barley, maize, rice), application method (spraying vs. dusting) were evaluated. FYROM, a DE from the Former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia, was the most effective of the DE deposits for grain treatment, whereas the least effective was from Greece (named Crete). However, for surface treatment, Slovenia was the most effective followed by Elassona 1 and Begora. Increase of temperature increased DE efficacy, while the reverse was noted with the increase of RH. Furthermore, the DEs were more effective in barley or wheat than in maize or rice. Neither the mined DEs nor SilicoSec were able to suppress progeny production of the tested species after previous exposure on the treated commodities. Generally, <b>dust</b> <b>application</b> of DEs was more efficacious than spraying against S. oryzae and T confusum. However, spraying of wheat significantly reduced the bulk density (test weight) compared to dusting. For surface treatment, after 1 d of exposure, Slovenia was the most effective of the mined DEs followed by Elassona 1 and Begora, whereas after 6 d of exposure the mortality was almost complete (> 99 %) with all three DEs. More than 6 d of exposure were required for an effective control of T confusum adults with the remainder of the mined DEs. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Large {{quantities}} of dyes are utilized by the textile industry.

Biodegradation of this group of compounds is significantly slower than that of acid and direct dyes. The persistent nature of reactive dyes complicates wastewater treatment within the textile industry. Removal of dyestuffs from wastewater occurs by either biological methods or physicochemical methods (e. g., adsorption, oxidation-reduction, chemical coagulation, ozone treatment, and membrane filtration).

40|$|Mine explosions {{remain a}} threat to {{underground}} coal miners, requiring constant vigilance to prevent accumulations of combustible gasses and dusts and to limit sources of ignition. Accumulations of combustible dust in coal mines create the risk of large-scale explosions that can result in multiple deaths and traumatic injuries. The explosion hazard can be effectively controlled {{through the application of}} rock dust, such as limestone dust, to render inert the combustible coal dust generated during the mining and transport of coal (see publication 2011 - 196 at www. cdc. gov/niosh/docs/impact). Traditionally, determining when additional rock dust should be applied or evaluating the effectiveness of existing rock <b>dust</b> <b>application</b> has been limited to a subjective visual evaluation or to the collection and laboratory analysis of dust samples - a process that requires days or weeks to identify a hazard. For decades, miners have been able to monitor the concentrations of methane and other combustible gasses using handheld, direct reading gas detectors. These detectors have allowed miners to take immediate action to dilute gasses and prevent explosions. With this same purpose in mind, researchers at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) developed a real-time dust explosibility measuring instrument to provide instant feedback to miners on the relative hazard of dust accumulations in the mine and the effectiveness of their rock dusting practices. This instrument, the Coal Dust Explosibility Meter (CDEM), is a simple-to-use handheld device that provides a pass/fail assessment of coal mine dust samples. With this device, miners, mine operators and regulators will have the information necessary to take immediate action to eliminate an explosion hazard. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 "August 2011.

40|$|Proper {{rock dusting}} {{practices}} {{have proven to}} be an effective means of preventing coal dust explosions. Rock dust (generally pulverized limestone dust) serves as a heat sink material that prevents or suppresses a propagating coal dust explosion through the absorption of thermal energy from the heated gases and absorption of radiant energy, which reduces the preheating of unburned coal particles ahead of the flame front. Therefore to effectively suppress a coal dust explosion, sufficient quantities of dispersible rock dust must be entrained into the mine entry by the expanding explosion pressure wave to inert the coal dust, also entrained in the entry. The in-mine application of rock dust dates back to the early 1900 s. Since that time, significant technological improvements to rock <b>dust</b> <b>application</b> methods have been implemented along with increasingly stringent regulatory requirements and inspections to ensure adequate quantities of rock dust are applied to the roof, ribs, and floor throughout the mine. Even with enhancements to the rock dusting application methods and equipment, coal mining operations still experience compliance issues associated with meeting the current total incombustible content (TIC) requirement of at least 80 % for all mine dust samples. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) conducted general surveys of rock dusting practices at nine underground coal mining operations and met with Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) mine inspectors and District personnel {{to gain a better understanding}} of the rock dusting practices and associated compliance issues during this survey period. These surveys included obtaining the following from each of the nine mines: 1. Mine dust samples to assess the incombustible content (IC) for determining any rock dust deficient areas common to all nine mines, 2. Information and issues related to rock dusting, and 3. Rock dusting sampling practices. This report discusses research that was conducted in the NIOSH laboratories, experimental mine, and in operating mines to evaluate the potential explosion hazard associated with excessive coal dust accumulating on elevated surfaces, the efficacy of wet rock dusting, and the need for mines to develop comprehensive rock dusting programs. Taken as a whole, this report provides proactive approaches to current rock dusting practices that will improve the application of rock dust in all underground areas of a coal mine.

40|$|Upcoming {{emissions}} regulations (Tiers 3, 4 a and 4 b) are imposing {{significantly higher}} heat loads on the cooling system than lesser regulated machines. This work was {{a suite of}} tasks aimed at reducing the parasitic losses of the cooling system, or improving the design process through six distinct tasks: 1. Develop an axial fan that will provide more airflow, with less input power and less noise. The initial plan was to use Genetic Algorithms to do an automated fan design, incorporating forward sweep for low noise. First and second generation concepts could not meet either performance or sound goals. An experienced turbomachinery designer, using a specialized CFD analysis program {{has taken over the}} design and has been able to demonstrate a 5 % flow improvement (vs 10 % goal) and 10 % efficiency improvement (vs 10 % goal) using blade twist only. 2. Fan shroud developments, using an 'aeroshroud' concept developed at Michigan State University. Performance testing at Michigan State University showed the design is capable of meeting the goal of a 10 % increase in flow, but over a very narrow operating range of fan performance. The goal of 10 % increase in fan efficiency was not met. Fan noise was reduced from 0 to 2 dB, vs. a goal of 5 dB at constant airflow. The narrow range of fan operating conditions affected by the aeroshroud makes this concept unattractive for further development at this time 3. Improved axial fan system modeling is needed to accommodate the numbers of cooling systems to be redesigned to meet lower emissions requirements. A CFD fan system modeling guide has been completed and transferred to design engineers. Current, uncontrolled modeling practices produce flow estimates in some cases within 5 % of measured values, and in some cases within 25 % of measured values. The techniques in the modeling guide reduced variability to the goal of + 5 % for the case under study. 4. Demonstrate the performance and design versatility of a high performance fan. A 'swept blade mixed flow' fan was rapid prototyped from cast aluminum for a performance demonstration on a small construction machine. The fan was mounted directly in place of the conventional fan (relatively close to the engine). The goal was to provide equal airflow at constant fan speed, with 75 % of the input power and 5 dB quieter than the conventional fan. The result was a significant loss in flow with the prototype due to its sensitivity to downstream blockage. This sensitivity to downstream blockage affects flow, efficiency, and noise all negatively, and further development was terminated. 5. Develop a high efficiency variable speed fan drive to replace existing slipping clutch style fan drives. The goal for this task was to provide a continuously variable speed fan drive with an efficiency of 95 %+ at max speed, and losses no greater than at max speed as the fan speed would vary throughout its entire speed range. The process developed to quantify the fuel savings potential of a variable speed fan drive has produced a simple tool to predict the fuel savings of a variable speed drive, and has sparked significant interest in the use of variable speed fan drive for Tier 3 emissions compliant machines. The proposed dual ratio slipping clutch variable speed fan drive can provide a more efficient system than a conventional single ratio slipping clutch fan drive, but could not meet the established performance goals of this task, so this task was halted in a gate review {{prior to the start of}} detailed design. 6. Develop a cooling system air filtration device to allow the use of automotive style high performance heat exchangers currently in off road machines. The goal of this task was to provide a radiator air filtration system that could allow high fin density, louvered radiators to operate in a find <b>dust</b> <b>application</b> with the same resistance to fouling as a current production off-road radiator design. Initial sensitivity testing demonstrated that fan speed has a significant impact on the fouling of radiator cores due to fine dusts, so machines equipped with continuously variable speed fan drives would be expected to have more radiator debris fouling problems than a machine with a constant speed fan. Filtration concepts looked at a wide range of filtration technologies, but the combination of pressure drop constraints and the small size of the debris to be filtered made this a futile exercise. The most successful technologies evaluated all incorporate some way to increase the Reynolds number inside the heat exchanger air flow path. A form of an 'air knife' concept has emerged as the most promising technology to pursue...|$|E

This is a very valuable area of research, as smart dust – being generally perceived as the low-cost, ubiquitous sensor of the future – can {{play an important role in}} Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Our involvement in several transport-related UK and EU funded projects (such as ASTRA [1], EMMA [5], and TRACKSS [7]) gave us the opportunity to carry out feasibility experiments and to develop demonstrations of smart <b>dust</b> <b>applications</b> in transport domain. We have also investigated how smart dust can be used in collaboration with other (more traditional) transport sensors for developing better Co-operative Transport Systems (CTS).

Management tools have included cul-tural controls to modify habitats and foraging, <b>dust</b> <b>applications</b> to wall voids, perimeter sprays, baiting, and combinations of these approaches. Comparisons of liquid, gel, and granular formulations were made at 87 field sites with infestations of C. modoc or C. vicinus. Toxicants in these tests included boric acid, avermectin, hydramethylnon, and fipronil. Foraging sites and trails were utilized during the foraging sea-son for bait placement. Parameters for assessing control included observation of foragers, homeowner observations, and a final inspection the following spring. Efficacy of baits was investigated over five years and found to have 77 % to 90 % control. Liquids with boric acid required an average of 11. 1 weeks for control, and hydramethylnon granules required 10 weeks. Both achieved 100 % control. Fipronil granules had a 92 % control in an average of 5. 9 weeks, but the avermectin granules did not achieve control. Fipronil gel had a 76 % control in 6. 6 weeks.

Finely ground rocks have been proposed as a soil amendment for highly weathered soils. In Chontales, Nicaragua most of the forest has been converted to cattle pasture. In fertile soils, crop agriculture is more lucrative per unit of area than cattle grazing, but the low nutrient content of Chontales soils makes it uneconomic.

40|$|The State of Iowa {{currently}} has approximately 69, 000 miles of unpaved secondary roads. Due {{to the low}} traffic count on these unpaved frontage two dusted roads, paving with asphalt or Portland cement concrete is not economical. Therefore to reduce dust production, the use of dust suppressants has been utilized for decades. This {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the effectiveness of several widely used dust suppressants through quantitative field testing on two of Iowa’s most widely used secondary road surface treatments: crushed limestone rock and alluvial sand/gravel. These commercially available dust suppressants included: lignin sulfonate, calcium chloride, and soybean oil soapstock. These suppressants were applied to 1000 ft test sections on four unpaved roads in Story County, Iowa. Tduplicate field conditions, the suppressants were applied as a surface spray once in early June and again in late August or early September. The four unpaved roads included two with crushed limestone rock and two with alluvial sand/gravel surface treatmewell as high and low traffic counts. The effectiveness of the dust suppressants was evaluated by comparing the dust produced on treated and untreated test sections. Dust collection was scheduled for 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks after each application, for a total testiperiod of 16 weeks. Results of a cost analysis between annual <b>dust</b> suppressant <b>application</b> and biennial aggregate replacement indicated that the cost of the dust suppressant, its transportation, and application were relatively high when compared to that of thaggregate types. Therefore, the biennial aggregate replacement is considered more economical than annual <b>dust</b> suppressant <b>application,</b> although the <b>application</b> of annual <b>dust</b> suppressant reduced the cost of road maintenance by 75 %. Results of thecollection indicated that the lignin sulfonate suppressant outperformed calcium chloride and soybean oil soapstock on all four unpavroads, the effect of the suppressants on the alluvial sand/gravel surface treatment was less than that on the crushed limestone rock, the residual effects of all the products seem reasonably well after blading, and the combination of alluvial sand/gravel surface treatment anhigh traffic count caused dust reduction to decrease dramatically...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{develop a}} scheme for {{providing}} strong cryptographic authentication on {{a stream of}} messages which consumes very little bandwidth (as little as one bit per message) and is robust {{in the presence of}} dropped messages. Such a scheme should be useful for extremely lowpower, low-bandwidth wireless sensor networks and “smart <b>dust</b> ” <b>applications.</b> The tradeoffs among security, memory, bandwidth, and tolerance for missing messages give rise to several new optimization problems. We report on experimental results and derive bounds on the performance of the scheme. 1 Introduction and Previous Work We consider the following scenario: we wish to send a stream of many short messages m 1, m 2, m 3, · · · on a channel with very limited bandwidth, and we need to provide strong cryptographic authentication for this data. Because bandwidth is so limited, we assume that we must use almost all transmitted bits for deliverin...|$|R
40|$|The {{interrogation}} of molecular vibrations in crystalline and amorphous solids by Raman and infrared spectroscopy methods {{can provide a}} wealth of revealing information concerning the composition, morphology, and spatial distribution of the extant phases. When these measurements are made in situ, such as during processes taking place in extreme environments (e. g., elevated temperature and pressure, oxidizing or reducing), where phases are evolving and/or dissipating, {{it is also possible}} to derive kinetic and mechanistic parameters. This paper summarizes the possibilities and limitations involved in using various types of Raman and infrared measurement methods to study metal <b>dusting</b> corrosion. <b>Applications</b> of conventional, microprobe, and imaging molecular spectroscopy approaches are discussed, with examples taken directly from metal dusting investigations. Some perspective is offered concerning the origin of observable condensed matter phonons emanating from the surface films and the carbon particles that accompany carbon dusting on various types of metals and alloys. Concepts for the systematic investigation of carbon dusting chemistry using molecular spectroscopy methods are presented...|$|R
