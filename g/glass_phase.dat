25|$|Fly ash {{material}} solidifies while {{suspended in}} the exhaust gases and is collected by electrostatic precipitators or filter bags. Since the particles solidify rapidly while {{suspended in the}} exhaust gases, fly ash particles are generally spherical in shape and {{range in size from}} 0.5 µm to 300µm. The major consequence of the rapid cooling is that few minerals have time to crystallize, and that mainly amorphous, quenched glass remains. Nevertheless, some refractory phases in the pulverized coal do not melt (entirely), and remain crystalline. In consequence, fly ash is a heterogeneous material. SiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3 and occasionally CaO are the main chemical components present in fly ashes. The mineralogy of fly ashes is very diverse. The main phases encountered are a <b>glass</b> <b>phase,</b> together with quartz, mullite and the iron oxides hematite, magnetite and/or maghemite. Other phases often identified are cristobalite, anhydrite, free lime, periclase, calcite, sylvite, halite, portlandite, rutile and anatase. The Ca-bearing minerals anorthite, gehlenite, akermanite and various calcium silicates and calcium aluminates identical to those found in Portland cement can be identified in Ca-rich fly ashes.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the subcrit. crack growth (SCG) behavior of alumina-glass dental composites. Alumina-glass composites were fabricated by infiltrating molten glass to porous alumina preforms. Rectangular bars of the composite were subject to dynamic loading in air, with stressing rates ranging from 0. 01 MPa/s to 2 MPa/s. The SCG parameter n was detd. to be 22. 1 for the composite, which is substantially lower than those of high-purity dense alumina. Investigations showed that <b>glass</b> <b>phases</b> are responsible for the low n value as cracks propagate preferentially within <b>glass</b> <b>phases</b> or along the interface between <b>glass</b> <b>phases</b> and alumina phases, due to the fact that glasses are more vulnerable to chem. attacks by water mols. under stress corrosion conditions.

The Bose <b>glass</b> <b>phase</b> is characterized by a finite compressibility, the absence of a gap, and by an infinite superfluid susceptibility. It is insulating despite the absence of a gap, as low tunneling prevents the generation of excitations which, although close in energy, are spatially separated.
