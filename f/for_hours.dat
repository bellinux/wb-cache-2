40|$|The {{distribution}} of monochlorobenzene among the organs of mice was investigated by gas chromatographic equilibration after inhalation of 500 ppm of monochlorobenzene <b>for</b> 1 <b>hour,</b> 300 ppm <b>for</b> 1 <b>hour,</b> 100 ppm <b>for</b> 1 <b>hour</b> and 100 ppm <b>for</b> 3 <b>hours.</b> Monochlorobenzene was detected just after exposure at {{concentrations in the}} descending order {{of that in the}} adipose tissue, liver, kidneys, blood, heart and brain. The biological half-lives in the second phase of monochlorobenzene accumulation in the organs were in the descending order of length in the adipose tissue, brain, liver, spleen, kidneys and blood. There was a correlation between the amounts of lipid in the organs and the biological half-lives in the second phase. Biological half-lives in the second phase of monochlorobenzene accumulation in the blood, brain, liver and kidneys were in the descending order of exposure: 500 ppm <b>for</b> 1 <b>hour,</b> 300 ppm <b>for</b> 1 <b>hour</b> and 100 ppm <b>for</b> 1 <b>hour.</b> Concentrations of monochlorobenzene in the blood, brain, liver and kidneys just after exposure to 300 ppm of monochlorobenzene <b>for</b> 1 <b>hour</b> were higher than that after exposure to 100 ppm <b>for</b> 3 <b>hours.</b> However, the biological half-life in the second phase after exposure to 100 ppm <b>for</b> 3 <b>hours</b> was longer than that after exposure to 300 ppm <b>for</b> 1 <b>hour.</b> The biological half-life in the second phase after exposure to 100 ppm <b>for</b> 3 <b>hours</b> was longer than that after exposure to 100 ppm <b>for</b> 1 <b>hour...</b>|$|R

5|$|Accordingly, {{protective}} measures {{were taken in}} response. To save the transformers and other electrical equipment, the power grid {{was taken out of}} commission, as circuit breakers tripped all over Quebec and shut off the power. Within less than 90 seconds, this wave of breaking circuits left the entire transmission grid out of service. The collapsed power grid left six million people and the rest of Quebec without electricity <b>for</b> <b>hours</b> on a very cold night. Even though the blackout lasted around nine hours for most places, some locations were in the dark for days. This geomagnetic storm caused about C$10 million in damage to Hydro-Québec and tens of millions to the customers of the utility.|$|E
5|$|After {{the active}} {{portion of a}} seizure (the ictal state) there is {{typically}} a period of recovery during which there is confusion, {{referred to as the}} postictal period before a normal level of consciousness returns.

Psychosis after a seizure is relatively common, occurring in 6–10% of people. Often people do not remember what happened during this time. Localized weakness, known as Todd's paralysis, may also occur after a focal seizure. When it occurs it typically lasts for seconds to minutes but may rarely last for a day or two.|$|E

5|$|Ash may disrupt {{transportation}} systems over large areas <b>for</b> <b>hours</b> to days, including roads and vehicles, railways and ports and shipping. Falling ash {{will reduce the}} visibility which can make driving difficult and dangerous. In addition, fast travelling cars will stir up ash, creating billowing clouds which perpetuate ongoing visibility hazards. Ash accumulations will decrease traction, especially when wet, and cover road markings. Fine-grained ash can infiltrate openings in cars and abrade most surfaces, especially between moving parts. Air and oil filters will become blocked requiring frequent replacement. Rail transport is less vulnerable, with disruptions mainly caused by reduction in visibility.|$|E
