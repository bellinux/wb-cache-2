50|$|Most of {{the female}} workers in {{garments}} factories work as sewing operators, sewing operator helper, cutting personnel and finishing personnel. Sewing machines operators usually work in seated postures with forward flexion of the head, neck, and torso {{for long periods of}} time. This results in strain on the neck and back, and eventually to pain. A case study conducted by Habib M. among sewing machines operators in Bangladesh, found that the high risk of developing musculoskeletal disorders was related to working in a sitting position bending the neck more than 30° for more than 6 to 7 hours. Additionally, sitting in a forward flexed posture causes the lumbar spine to flatten that leads to an imbalanced <b>disc</b> <b>pressure</b> and a static contraction of the extensor muscles of the back. The flattened lumbar spine may cause back fatigue, disc degeneration and back injuries. But it is not only related to posture, design of the workstation can also worsen the problem. Sarder and colleagues found that seats in garment factories were devoid of a backrest, which would allow intermittent short breaks for resting the upper body from bending. Also, many seats are hard and wooden, without the cushion to prevent compression at the area of the ischial tuberosities. Even though some factories have sewing machines tables with height adjustability options 70 - 80 cm, workers rarely or never adjusted them because it takes between 10-15 minutes to adjust them.|$|E

40|$|Finite element (FE) model {{studies have}} made {{important}} contributions {{to our understanding}} of functional biomechanics of the lumbar spine. However, if a model is used to answer clinical and biomechanical questions over a certain population, their inherently large inter-subject variability has to be considered.

This raises questions concerning their predictive power, their range of results and on their agreement with in vitro and in vivo values. Eight well-established FE models of the lumbar spine (L 1 - 5) of different research centres around the globe were subjected to pure and combined loading modes and compared to in vitro and in vivo measurements for intervertebral rotations, <b>disc</b> <b>pressures</b> and facet joint forces. Under pure moment loading, the predicted L 1 - 5 rotations of almost all models fell within the reported in vitro ranges, and their median values differed on average by only 2 ° for flexion-extension, 1 ° for lateral bending and 5 ° for axial rotation.

40|$|Due to {{its ability}} to {{represent}} intricate systems with material nonlinearities as well as irregular loading, boundary, geometrical and material domains, the finite element (FE) method has been recognized as an important computational tool in spinal biomechanics. Current FE models generally account for a single distinct spinal geometry with one set of material properties despite inherently large inter-subject variability. The uncertainty and high variability in tissue material properties, geometry, loading and boundary conditions has {{cast doubt on the}} reliability of their predictions and comparability with reported in vitro and in vivo values. A multicenter study was undertaken to compare the results of eight well-established models of the lumbar spine that have been developed, validated and applied for many years. Models were subjected to pure and combined loading modes and their predictions were compared to in vitro and in vivo measurements for intervertebral rotations, <b>disc</b> <b>pressures</b> and facet joint forces. Under pure moment loading, the predicted L 1 - 5 rotations of almost all models fell within the reported in vitro ranges; their median values differed on average by only 2 ° for flexion-extension, 1 ° for lateral bending and 5 ° for axial rotation. Predicted median facet joint forces and <b>disc</b> <b>pressures</b> were also in good agreement with previously published median in vitro values. However, the ranges of predictions were larger and exceeded the in vitro ranges, especially for facet joint forces. For all combined loading modes, except for flexion, predicted median segmental intervertebral rotations and <b>disc</b> <b>pressures</b> were in good agreement with in vivo values. The simulations yielded median facet joint forces of 0 N in flexion, 38 N in extension, 14 N in lateral bending and 60 N in axial rotation that could not be validated due to the paucity of in vivo facet joint forces. In light of high inter-subject variability, one must be cautious when generalizing predictions obtained from one deterministic model. This study demonstrates however that the predictive power increases when FE models are combined together. The median of individual numerical results can hence be used as an improved tool in order to estimate the response of the lumbar spine...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: There {{have been}} some {{disagreements}} on the comparison of disc pressures in the standing and sitting postures in literature. Most research on in vivo pressure needle measurement found higher <b>disc</b> <b>pressure</b> in sitting than in standing. The <b>disc</b> <b>pressure</b> data can help to advocate better postures for clinical advice. OBJECTIVE: The aim {{of this paper is}} to develop a procedure to study the compressive load on intervertebral joint in the standing and sitting postures through the approach of motion capture and musculoskeletal modeling. METHODS: The marker data of six subjects performing various standing and sitting postures was obtained during the motion capture experiment and used to train the musculoskeletal model with an enhanced discretized spine developed for subject in the inverse and forward simulations. RESULTS: Compressive loads on L 3 -L 4 and L 4 -L 5 joints are found higher in upright sitting than in upright standing. Slumped sitting, cross-legged sitting and flexion sitting can introduce higher compressive loads on intervertebral joints compared with upright sitting. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate the effects of standing and sitting postures on the spinal joint loads. The results can provide doctors and therapists with more information on clinical advice on better postures for people with spinal problems...|$|E
40|$|Objectives. – To {{examine the}} biomechanisms {{underlying}} adjacent fractures following vertebroplasty, an emerging procedure to stabilize fractured vertebrae. In this procedure, bone cement is injected percutaneously into the vertebral cancellous bone. Once hardened, the cement offers mechanical reinforcement to the weakened vertebra. Recent clinical and biomechanical reports {{suggest that this}} procedure may cause new fractures adjacent to the one augmented. The cause and extend is unclear yet. The focus here is on the biomechanical hypothesis resulting from the rigid cement augmentation. Methods. – A combination of experimental and numerical studies, in additional to a review of recent clinical reports. Results. – The broader finding suggests that vertebroplasty changes the mechanical loading in adjacent vertebrae. Specifically, an increase in adjacent loading {{in the range of}} 17 % has been found. The mechanism underlying this increase seemed to stem from the excessive cement rigidity that reduced the endplate bulge of the augmented vertebra, thereby reducing the local spinal joint flexibility. The reduction in joint flexibility seeks to reverse itself by creating an increase in the inter-vertebral <b>disc</b> <b>pressure.</b> The increased <b>disc</b> <b>pressure</b> seeks to relieve itself by increasing the load on the adjacent vertebra. The increased load on the adjacent vertebra relates directly to an increased risk of fracture. Conclusions. – Although an increasing amount of evidence exists to support this theory of the origin of adjacent fractures, one must be cautious. Vertebroplasty is a relatively new procedure and further observations and, ultimately, prospective clinical studies are required to conclusively determine the cause and extend of adjacent fractures...|$|E
40|$|Low {{back pain}} (LBP) {{is a major}} problem in the industrialized world. The {{aetiology}} of LBP is multicausal: heavy physical workload, sedentary work, whole body vibration, smoking, as well as minimal influence over work conditions, poor social relations and psychological factors all play a dominant role (Thorbjornsson et al. 2000). Heavy physical workload is often cited as a primary factor, and is mostly related to an overload and high intradiscal pressure of the intervertebral discs. After Nachemson measured intervertebral <b>disc</b> <b>pressure</b> in vivo in 1964 and found higher <b>disc</b> <b>pressure</b> in sitting, lifting and bending than in standing and lying down, most physicians concluded that high intradiscal pressure, e. g. from heavy workload, should be avoided. Because of low intradiscal pressure during lying down, bed rest was the first choice in case of LBP, and recommendations for activities were restrictive. It is now evident that bed rest for longer than two days is ineffective in case of LBP (Deyo et al. 1986) and even leads to chronicity and disuse (Waddell 1993; Bortz 1984); there is now worldwide consensus about the value of maintaining or resuming normal activities and doing exercises of any kind (Koes et al. 2001). However, even today, it is common in routine medical practice, that physicians still tend to restrict rather than encourage physical activity and work for patients with LBP (Rainville et al. 2000). It is also remarkable that in daily practice it is not the extent of spinal load that may be most painful, but the lack of spinal motion. Most LBP patients say that: "I can easily do sports, cycling and walking, but sauntering, sitting and even lying down is painful". The controversy between the "spinal load" axiom and this clinical information from patients was the main incentive for the work presented in this thesis...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, non-fusion {{implants}} to stabilise the lumbar spine {{have become}} more and more popular. However, little is known on the load bearing of such dynamic stabilisation systems. In order to investigate the load bearing of discs bridged with rigid and dynamic stabilisation systems, six lumbar cadaver spines were mounted in a spine tester and loaded with pure moments in the three main motion planes. Four different states of the specimens were studied: intact, destabilised, stabilisation with a Dynesys® and stabilisation with an internal fixator. Intradiscal pressure (IDP) measurements were used to assess the load bearing of the bridged disc. In the neutral unloaded position, there were small but not significant differences in <b>disc</b> <b>pressure</b> for the four states of the treated disc (P> 0. 05). Concerning the <b>disc</b> <b>pressure</b> during the course of loading, both the Dynesys® and internal fixator did significantly reduce the pressure change from neutral to extension in comparison to the intact state (− 0. 05, − 0. 04 and + 0. 24  MPa, respectively) (P 0. 05). The devices apparently eliminated the pressure change from neutral to lateral bending (Dynesys 0. 01  MPa, Fixator 0. 01  MPa and intact 0. 24  MPa), but due to large variations in the intact and defect states the differences were not significant (P> 0. 05). In axial rotation, the pressure change for the internal fixator was reduced compared to the intact state; however, the change was only significant in left axial rotation (P 0. 05) in axial rotation. No changes in IDP were seen in the adjacent discs for either the Dynesys or the internal fixator. Our results showed that the IDPs for both devices were similar, but altered compared to the intact disc...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effect of endplate deformity after an osteoporotic vertebral fracture in increasing the risk for adjacent vertebral fractures. Eight human lower thoracic or thoracolumbar specimens, each consisting of five vertebrae were used. To selectively fracture one of the endplates of the middle VB of each specimen a void was created under the target endplate and the specimen was flexed and compressed until failure. The fractured vertebra was subjected to spinal extension under 150  N preload that restored the anterior wall height and vertebral kyphosis, while the fractured endplate remained significantly depressed. The VB was filled with cement to stabilize the fracture, after complete evacuation of its trabecular content to ensure similar cement distribution under both the endplates. Specimens were tested in flexion-extension under 400  N preload while pressure in the discs and strain at the anterior wall of the adjacent vertebrae were recorded. <b>Disc</b> <b>pressure</b> in the intact specimens increased during flexion by 26  ±  14 %. After cementation, <b>disc</b> <b>pressure</b> increased during flexion by 15  ±  11 % in the discs with un-fractured endplates, while decreased by 19  ±  26. 7 % in the discs with the fractured endplates. During flexion, the compressive strain at the anterior wall of the vertebra next to the fractured endplate increased by 94  ±  23 % compared to intact status (p    0. 05). Subsequent flexion with compression to failure resulted in adjacent fracture close to the fractured endplate in six specimens and in a non-adjacent fracture in one specimen, while one specimen had no adjacent fractures. Depression of the fractured endplate alters the pressure profile of the damaged disc resulting in increased compressive loading of the anterior wall of adjacent vertebra that predisposes it to wedge fracture. This data suggests that correction of endplate deformity {{may play a role}} in reducing the risk of adjacent fractures...|$|E

Results of these two approaches are not in good agreement. We stress that if the spectral fit estimates are accurate and can be taken as referential (which is still questionable), the disagreement between the predicted and referential values would represent a rather generic problem for any relativistic QPO model, as no spin influence would appear in the observed 1 /M scaling of the QPO frequencies.

Because of health care cost and sick leave (Fassier 2011; Leclerc et al. 2009), low back pain has both societal and economic adverse consequences. Many treatments are proposed. However no guideline is provided to physician. Treatment depends on patient, on low back pain type and evolution and also on physician knowledge and believes.

Despite safety concerns, cervical pedicle screws have been proposed as an alternative. Pedicle screws {{have been shown to be}} biomechanically stronger than lateral mass screws. No study, however, has investigated the load sharing properties comparing constructs using these screws. To investigate this, 12 fresh-frozen single cervical spine motion segments (C 4 – 5 and C 6 – 7) from six cadavers were isolated. They were randomized to receive either lateral mass or pedicle screw-rod constructs. After preloading, the segments were cyclically loaded with a uniplanar axial load from 0 to 90  N both with and without the construct in place. Pressure data at the disc space were continuously collected using a dynamic pressure sensor. The reduction in <b>disc</b> space <b>pressure</b> between the two constructs was calculated to see if pedicle screw and lateral mass screw-rod constructs differed in their load sharing properties. In both the pedicle screw and lateral mass screw-rod constructs, there was a significant reduction in the <b>disc</b> space <b>pressures</b> from the no-construct to construct conditions.

40|$|The {{issue of}} {{fragmentation}} in self-gravitating gaseous accretion discs has implications {{both for the}} formation of stars in discs in the nuclei of active galaxies, and {{for the formation of}} gaseous planets or brown dwarfs in circumstellar discs. It is now well established that fragmentation occurs if the disc is cooled on a timescale smaller than the local dynamical timescale, while for longer cooling times the disc reaches a quasisteady state in thermal equilibrium, with the cooling rate balanced by the heating due to gravitational stresses. We investigate here how the fragmentation boundary depends on the assumed equation of state. We find that the cooling time required for fragmentation increases as the specific heat ratio γ decreases, exceeding the local dynamical timescale for γ = 7 / 5. This result can be easily interpreted as a consequence of there being a maximum stress (in units of the local <b>disc</b> <b>pressure)</b> that can be sustained by a self-gravitating disc in quasi-equilibrium. Fragmentation occurs if the cooling time is such that the stress required to reach thermal equilibrium exceeds this value, independent of γ.

Even after treating scoliosis {{with the help of}} brace or surgery, the normal spine range of motion is not achieved in most cases. After treating scoliosis either by brace or surgery, the normal posture might be achieved. But, {{it is important to know}} whether the patient is able regain his/her functionality. The mechanical properties of the vertebrae and intervertebral <b>disc</b> <b>pressure</b> after the application of brace and surgery are unknown and yet to be explored. In order to explore it, we come up with the thought of creating a 3 D model of vertebrae. Because scientists and researchers depend upon cadaver specimens to try new fixations where the number of people willing to donate their body for research purpose is very low or nil in most of the countries. Without a sufficient number of cadaver specimens, the research progress remains still or very slow. Thus, creating a 3 D model of vertebrae could yield more importance and convenience to do spine research. A 3 D model of human spine can help in 3 D printing too. In this study, we propose a simple method where the 3 D model of scoliotic vertebrae can be created with the help of DICOM files...|$|E
40|$|In {{explaining}} the damages of primary open-angle glaucoma, the elevated eye pressure {{was assumed to}} be the central causative factor. But epidemiological research found high proportions of the following clinical entities: only elevated pressure without further damages (called ocular hypertension), and only glaucomatous damages without high pressure (called normal- or low-pressure glaucoma). These facts made the pressure-theory doubtful, and therefore it had to be modified. Some authors, though, doubt the general validity of the pressure-theory, and postulate other models for the etiology of glaucomatous damages. According to current knowledge, for the diagnosis and screening of primary open angle glaucoma, emphasis should be put rather on the visual fields and the appearance of the optic <b>disc,</b> while <b>pressure</b> measurements supply further clues...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of a study into the development of bar gauges for the measurement of Pitot pressures in low density expansion tube flows. The bar gauges developed here are modified from the conventional designs for bar gauges. A steel disc of 9 mm diameter and 1 mm thickness is attached to the front of a shielded sensing bar. Semiconductor strain gauges are used as the strain sensing elements. A PCB impact hammer was used to calibrate the bar gauges. Experiments in flows at 9 km/s, with Pitot pressures close to 750 kPa, were done in the X 1 expansion tube at The University of Queensland. Tests were also performed by changing the operation mode of the X 1 facility to run it as a non-reflected shock tunnel. For those tests the flow speed was around 1. 3 km/s and the Pitot pressure was close to 650 kPa. This test flow was used to check the calibration of the bar gauges. The results indicate that the bar gauges developed here can be used to measure Pitot pressures in flows with a test period of up to 100 µs. The quality of the signals can be enhanced by ensuring good contact between the front disk and the sensing bar. Moreover, by isolating the sensing bar electrically from the tunnel the effects of ionisation on noise levels on the strain signal is reduced. In order to obtain the true Pitot pressure measurements, the average <b>disc</b> <b>pressures</b> measured using the presented bar gauges have to be multiplied by a factor of 1. 08 (1 / 0. 93). The overall uncertainty of the Pitot pressure measured is estimated to be ± 7 %, for Pitot pressures of order 600 kPa...|$|R
40|$|Study Design: In vitro {{study using}} porcine spines {{instrumented}} with pedicle screw and rod fixation. Objectives: To determine the intradiscal pressure (IDP) changes {{with the use}} of dynamic and rigid pedicle screw systems in simulated spinal fusion. Summary of Background Data: The intervertebral discs are prone to injury under conditions of altered IDP. The effects of instrumentation with dynamic pedicle screw systems on IDP have not been clearly delineated. Methods: A 2 -level posterior instrumentation was applied to fresh porcine spinal segments (n= 16). Dynamic and rigid pedicle screw constructs along with uninstrumented (n= 6) spinal segments as controls were tested. The spinal segments were subjected to 24, 000 cycles of flexion compression loading at 5 Hz. IDP within the instrumented (L 2 -L 3 and L 3 -L 4) and adjacent (L 1 -L 2 and L 4 -L 5) discs were measured using a pressure transducer needle. Results were recorded at 6000 cycle intervals. Results: Instrumentation increased IDP. Within the instrumented levels, the greatest increase in IDP was found at the L 2 -L 3 disc. Here, after 24, 000 loading cycles, IDP for spines instrumented with mobile screws was 6. 8 times higher than that of uninstrumented spines whereas for rigid screws the factor was 9. 1. For the L 3 -L 4 cases, the presence of instrumentation increased IDP by factors of 1. 7 and 2. 7 for mobile and rigid screws, respectively. In the uninstrumented levels, IDP at L 1 -L 2 and L 4 -L 5 was lower with mobile screws. These were statistically significant at for L 1 -L 2 (24, 000 cycles, P= 0. 008) and L 4 -L 5 level (12, 000, 18, 000, and 24, 000 cycles, P< 0. 04 in all cases). Conclusions: Of the 2 types, mobile screws produced the least increase in IDP. This feature might be beneficial for the fusion process {{while at the same time}} prevent secondary pathology such as premature disc degeneration and facet joint pathology due to excessive <b>disc</b> <b>pressures...</b>|$|R
