Before Kata-Zor sentences Jor-El to prison, Kal-El is launched to Earth to fulfill a prophecy. Adopted by Jonathan and Martha Kent, he forms a romance with Lois Lane in the Daily Planet. However, Lois <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>concerned</b> with exposing Lex Luthor, written as a government agent obsessed with UFO phenomena. Clark reveals himself {{to the world as}} Superman, bringing Kata-Zor's son, Ty-Zor, and three other Kryptonians to Earth. Superman is defeated and killed, and visits Jor-El (who committed suicide on Krypton while in prison) in Kryptonian heaven. Resurrected, he returns to Earth and defeats the four Kryptonians. The script ends with Superman flying off to Krypton in a spaceship.|$|E

25|$|Agent-neutral consequentialism {{ignores the}} {{specific}} value {{a state of}} affairs has for any particular agent. Thus, in an agent-neutral theory, an actor's personal goals do not count any more than anyone else's goals in evaluating what action the actor should take. Agent-focused consequentialism, on the other hand, focuses on the particular needs of the moral agent. Thus, in an agent-focused account, such as one that Peter Railton outlines, the agent might be concerned with the general welfare, but the agent <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>concerned</b> with the immediate welfare of herself and her friends and family.|$|E

The third and final group consists of one school, the configuration or transformation school, a hybrid of the other schools organized into stages, organizational life cycles, or “episodes”.|$|E

Still, at times, a specific feature or trait may become the character's idiosyncratic focus.|$|E

25|$|Although much {{of nursing}} ethics can appear similar to medical ethics, {{there are some}} factors that {{differentiate}} it. Breier-Mackie suggests that nurses' focus on care and nurture, rather than cure of illness, results in a distinctive ethics. Furthermore, nursing ethics emphasizes the ethics of everyday practice rather than moral dilemmas. Nursing ethics <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>concerned</b> with developing the caring relationship than broader principles, such as beneficence and justice. For example, a concern to promote beneficence may be expressed in traditional medical ethics by the exercise of paternalism, where the health professional makes a decision based upon a perspective of acting in the patient's best interests. However, it is argued by some that this approach acts against person-centred values found in nursing ethics.|$|E

25|$|IC design can {{be divided}} into the broad {{categories}} of digital and analog IC design. Digital IC design is to produce components such as microprocessors, FPGAs, memories (RAM, ROM, and flash) and digital ASICs. Digital design focuses on logical correctness, maximizing circuit density, and placing circuits so that clock and timing signals are routed efficiently. Analog IC design also has specializations in power IC design and RF IC design. Analog IC design is used in the design of op-amps, linear regulators, phase locked loops, oscillators and active filters. Analog design <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>concerned</b> with the physics of the semiconductor devices such as gain, matching, power dissipation, and resistance. Fidelity of analog signal amplification and filtering is usually critical and as a result, analog ICs use larger area active devices than digital designs and are usually less dense in circuitry.|$|E
25|$|He {{tended to}} dramatize where {{traditional}} novelists narrated; he <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>concerned</b> with {{the interplay of}} ideas and opinions than of feelings and emotions; his dramatis personae {{is more likely to}} consist of a cast of more or less equal characters than of one outstanding hero or heroine and a host of minor auxiliaries; his novels have a tendency to approximate the Classical unities, with few changes of scene and few if any subplots; his novels are novels of conversation rather than novels of action; in fact, Peacock is so much more interested in what his characters say to one another than in what they do to one another that he often sets out entire chapters of his novels in dialogue form. Plato's Symposium is the literary ancestor of these works, by way of the Deipnosophists of Athenaeus, in which (as in much of Peacock) the conversation relates less to exalted philosophical themes than to the points of a good fish dinner.|$|E

While he is still unsure about being a parent, his father (Harold Ramis) is excited. Alison's mother (Joanna Kerns) tries to persuade her daughter to have an abortion, but Alison decides to keep the child. Later, Alison and Ben decide to give their relationship a chance. The couple's efforts include Ben making an awkward marriage proposal with an empty ring box, promising to get her one someday.

25|$|The Sikh holy book, the Guru Granth Sahib, is {{the highest}} {{authority}} in the Sikhism, {{it is seen as}} the 11th and eternal Guru. It serves as a guide to Sikhs on how to live positive lives, and details what behavior is expected of all Sikhs. It is seemingly silent on the subject of homosexuality; however, married life is encouraged time and time again in Guru Granth Sahib Ji. Whenever marriage is mentioned, it is always in reference to a man and a woman. Some Sikhs believe that Guru Granth Sahib Ji is the complete guide to life, and if a marriage between two of the same sexes is not mentioned, it is therefore not right. The counterargument to this is that man and woman are only mentioned in this way to give light to the relationship of the soul and the soul force as being one. This denies gender and sex as an issue. Thus, Sikhism <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>concerned</b> with ones attainment of enlightenment rather than habitual desires such as sexuality. True love is attained through the Guru and no man speaks on behalf of the Guru as the Granth is open to interpretation and misrepresentation.|$|E

40|$|Consumer {{privacy is}} {{becoming}} an issue of increasing managerial importance as consumers become concerned about marketers’ intrusions on their privacy and insist on {{the protection of the}} confidentiality of their personal information. This study identified the different sociodemographic variables via a national telephonic survey of a sample of 800 South African consumers and determined their level of concern towards privacy protection, misuse of information, solicitation and government protection in privacy information matters. In the privacy protection dimension, it was found that older consumers <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>concerned</b> than younger consumers; English- and Afrikaans-speaking consumers <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>concerned</b> than consumers from other language groups; middle and high income groups <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>concerned</b> than lower income consumers; and females <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>concerned</b> than males. In the information misuse dimension, it was found that older consumers, English-speaking consumers and high income groups <b>were</b> <b>more</b> concerned; middle and high level education groups <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>concerned,</b> as <b>were</b> employed consumers. In the solicitation dimension, it was found that older consumers, English-speaking consumers and high income groups displayed higher levels of concern. Low and middle level education groups were less concerned. In the government protection dimension, the only group that showed higher levels of concern was females in comparison with males. Organisations should not be reactive in their management of privacy issues and wait for an external threat before they implement cohesive policies. Organisations that put off complying with regulations are likely to have more regulatory mechanisms imposed on them, and such delays may not be conducive to a trusting relationship with consumers...|$|R

The central character is Twilight Sparkle, a unicorn mare sent by her mentor Princess Celestia, ruler of Equestria, to the town of Ponyville to study the magic of friendship. In the show's opening episode [...] "Friendship Is Magic", Twilight resents this assignment, as she <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>concerned</b> about the foretold appearance of Nightmare Moon, the evil sister of Celestia. When Nightmare Moon does appear, vowing everlasting night and causing Celestia to disappear, Twilight sets off with five other ponies – Applejack, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, and Rarity – to obtain the Elements of Harmony and defeat Nightmare Moon. Before Twilight can activate the Elements, Nightmare Moon appears and shatters them. In a flash of inspiration, Twilight realizes that each of her new friends represents one of the Elements of Harmony (Honesty, Loyalty, Laughter, Generosity, and Kindness), and that she herself is the final piece, Magic. The magical power of the ponies' friendship reverts Nightmare Moon to a repentant Princess Luna. Celestia reappears, reunites with her sister Princess Luna, and decrees that Twilight shall stay in Ponyville to continue studying the magic of friendship, much to the happiness of Twilight and her new friends.|$|E
