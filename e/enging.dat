40|$|Abstract: Different users {{may want}} to search {{different}} goals when they submit some ambiguous query, to a search engine. The inference of user search goals can be very useful in improving performance of search engine. To conclude user search goals by analyzing search engine query logs a novel approach is proposed. First thing is that, we propose a framework to find out different user search goals for a query by clustering the proposed feedback sessions. Feedback session is built from user click-through data and can efficiently reflect the information needs of users. Second thing is, we propose a novel approach to generate pseudo-documents by using feedback sessions for clustering. For clustering a new algorithm which is bisecting K-means algorithm is used.

40|$|Abstract-The {{effects of}} tetanus toxin and its light and heavy chain {{subunits}} on vasopressin release were investigated in digitonin-permeabilized neurosecretory nerve terminals {{isolated from the}} neural lobe ofthe rat pituitary gland. Exocytosis was induced by chal 1 <b>enging</b> the permeabilized nerve endings with micromolar calcium concentrations. Tetanus toxin inhibited vasopressin release only {{in the presence of}} the reducing agent dithiothreitol. This effect was irreversible. The purified light chain of tetanus toxin strongly inhibited exocytosis in a dose-dependent manner with half-maximal effect at c. 10 nM. The action of the light chain was observed after only 2. 5 min of preincubation. Separated heavy chain subunit had no effect on hormone secretion. Inhibition ofvasopressin release could be prevented by preincubating the light chain of tetanus toxin with an immune serum against tetanus toxin. The data c 1 early demonstrate that in mammalian neurosecretory nerve endings tetanus toxin acts at a step downstream from the activation by Ca 2 + ofthe exocytotic machinery and that the functional domain of this toxin is confined to its light chain. In recent years, increasing use has been made of bacterial, plant and animal toxins in neurobiological research. A potent bacterial neurotoxin synthesize...|$|E

Being common {{in all the}} type of aquatic ecosystems such as freshwater, marine and brackish water fish {{are the first to}} get prone to toxic metals and metalloids. In addition to a number of physiological/biochemical alterations, toxic metals and metalloids cause enhanced generation of varied reactive oxygen species (ROS) ultimately leading to a situ- ation called oxidative stress.

This study establishes {{their values and}} the effect of sun drying on their quality and quantity. Methanolic extracts of five Cantharellus and two Afrocantharellus species were investigated. The investigation used (1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl radical) DPPH as a substrate to determine radical scavenging abilities. Further quantitative analyses for carotenoids, flavonoid, total phenolic compounds and vitamin C content were done using spectrophotometric assay at 515 nm. Comparatively, fresh mushroom had higher vitamin C and Lycopene contents than their dry counterparts with β-carotene. Flavonoid and phenolic compounds were higher in dry forms than those in their fresh counterparts. Radical scavenging ability also varied with fresh forms depicting higher activity compared to dry forms. The variation was low in Afrocantharellus species (0. 8 % and 0. 99 %) while it was higher in Cantharellus species (24. 12 % and 7. 52 %). The highest ability was observed in fresh forms of Cantharellus pseudocibarius (EC 50 < 0. 14 mg/ml) while the least ability (EC 50 = 0. 4 mg/ml) was from dry form of Cantharellus rufopunctatus. This shows that studied {{mushrooms are}} rich in antioxidants and their quality and quantities are affected differently in both forms.

To test {{the hypothesis that}} this response also occurs in vivo, Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (Cu,Zn-SOD) and catalase mRNA levels, were mea- sured in the kidneys of Sprague-Dawley rats 17 days after intravenous injection of streptozotocin (60 mg/ kg body weight) and {{compared with those of}} control rats. Diabetic rats were either left untreated or given differing insulin regimens (2, 3 – 8, 6 – 10 IU/day) in two different experiments that were designed to achieve varying degrees of metabolic control. Cu,Zn-SOD and catalase mRNA levels were mea- sured by Northern blot hybridization and standard- ized by 28 S ribosomal RNA determination. Re- nal Cu,Zn-SOD and catalase mRNA levels were significantly greater in untreated diabetic and in low- dose (2 IU/day) insulin-treated rats than in controls. Treatment with a moderate dose (3 – 8 IU/day) of in- sulin normalized catalase but not Cu,Zn-SOD mRNA levels. The highest insulin regimen (6 – 10 IU/ day), in addition to achieving complete metabolic control as evidenced by normal growth and plasma glucose levels, normalized both catalase and Cu,Zn- SOD mRNA levels. Thus, in rats with streptozoto- cin-induced diabetes Cu,Zn-SOD and catalase renal mRNA levels are greater than in normal rats. This difference is prevented by sufficient insulin dosage to normalize plasma glucose and might be due to an increased production of free radicals...|$|E

40|$|The underrepresentation {{of women}} and {{minorities}} in top leadership positions and politics is un,d eniable and mirrored by the public discussions and attention if a minority member does {{make it into the}} top leadership league. e. g. Barack Obama as the first black president. Social psychological research has been exploring the factors contributing to the emergence and success ofleaders. It has been shown that group prototypicality is one crucial determinant for leadership emergence and success, since it instils a sense of trust and increases influence and compliance in other group members (Hogg & van Knippenberg, 2003). However relying upon group prototypicality for leadership evaluations and choices is one factor contributing to the glass ceiling effect experienced by women and minorities striving for leadership positions. This thesis explores in seven experimental studies how stereotypic thinking affects the use of group prototypicality for leadership evaluations and choices. The studies show that under conditions in which stereotypic thinking is prevalent leadership choices are contingent upon group prototypicality. However, -if stereotypic thinking is challenged via an exposure to a chal 1 <b>enging</b> diversity experience (Crisp & Turner, 2011), the preference for group prototypical leadership candidates is attenuated.
