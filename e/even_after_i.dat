On one {{occasion}} in London, when asked by the soprano Maria Malibran after a recital to extemporise, he created a piece which included the melodies of all the songs she had sung. The music publisher Victor Novello who was present remarked 'He has done some things that seem to me impossible, <b>even</b> <b>after</b> <b>I</b> have heard them done.' At another recital in 1837, where Mendelssohn played the piano for a singer, Robert Schumann ignored the soprano and wrote 'Mendelssohn accompanied like a God'.|$|E

60|$|I dreamed {{this night}} {{of an event}} which had {{occurred}} long before. It was a difference with a Friend, which had not ceased to give me pain, though I had no cause to blame myself.

60|$|The {{weather in}} London was mild and clear. The third <b>evening</b> <b>after</b> <b>I</b> had got settled {{in one of}} those delightfully English hotels {{in the heart of the}} city, yet removed from the traffic, with letter-boxes that still bear the {{initials}} of Victoria, I went to visit some American naval officers in their sitting-room on the ground floor. The cloth had not been removed from the dinner-table, around which we were chatting, when a certain strange sound reached our ears--a sound not to be identified with the distant roar of the motor-busses in Pall Mall, nor with the sharp bark of the taxi-horns, although not unlike them. We sat listening intently, and heard the sound again.|$|R
60|$|So saying, {{she swung}} herself off, {{and she was}} then so near me that I was able to seize her and make {{the rest of her}} descent {{comparatively}} easy. Mrs. Aleshine proved to be a more difficult subject. <b>Even</b> <b>after</b> <b>I</b> had a firm grasp of her capacious waist she refused to let go the ropes, for fear that she might drop into the ocean instead of the boat. But the reproaches of Mrs. Lecks and the downward weight of myself made her loosen her nervous grip; and, although we came very near going overboard together, I safely placed her on one of the thwarts.|$|E
60|$|<b>Even</b> <b>after</b> <b>I</b> had {{acquired}} full confidence, {{and no longer}} needed the agent's help, I sometimes encountered difficulties.

First, I had no plough to turn the earth, no spade or shovel to dig it. Well, this I conquered by making a wooden spade, as I observed before; but this did my work but in a wooden manner; and though it cost me a great many days to make it, yet, for want of iron, it not only wore out the sooner, but made my work the harder, and made it be performed much worse.|$|E

Had I married any man but you, I should have made this a condition of our union; but you I know so well, and so well know I could trust, that I have found a deep satisfaction in placing myself, as it might be, in your power. I know that all my personal property is already yours, without reserve, and that I can make no disposition of the real, <b>even</b> <b>after</b> <b>I</b> come of age, without your consent.

I know that your mind has not changed upon the matter, for had it done so, you would scarcely have spoken to me as you did to-day after Olfan left us. Indeed, I do not altogether understand why I have told you this, since it will not interest you very much and may possibly annoy you in your last hours. I suppose it was because I wished to make a clean breast of it before I pass to where we lose all our loves and hopes." ...|$|E
60|$|A day or {{two later}} Mrs. Strickland sent me round a note asking if I could go and see her that <b>evening</b> <b>after</b> dinner. <b>I</b> found her alone.

Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do; and behold all was vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun." ...|$|R
