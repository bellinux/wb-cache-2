40|$|Background: Restless legs {{syndrome}} (RLS) is {{a common}} movement disorder. The occurrence of this syndrome is due to genetic factors and lifestyle. This study performed to determine restless legs syndrome (RLS) prevalence in Iranian multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and the possible risk factors. Methods : This cross-sectional {{study was conducted with}} MS patients, and the age- and sex-matched control group comprised healthy persons. Then, all subjects were asked about RLS symptoms. After the diagnosis of RLS, the patients were divided into two groups: With and without RLS. In both groups, the following variables were evaluated: Age, sex, other underlying disease, duration of MS, MS course, family history of RLS, history of anemia, and drug intakes. The severity of the disease in subjects diagnosed with RLS was also evaluated. Results: A total of 126 patients in the MS group and 126 healthy controls were included in the study, with no statistically significant differences between them in terms of age and gender. In MS group, 82 (65. 1 %) and, in control group, 16 (12. 7 %) had RLS. The frequency of RLS in the MS patients was significantly higher than that in the control group. Among MS patients, 60 male (73. 2 %) and 22 female (26. 8 %) had RLS. Mean age of MS patients with RLS was significantly higher than that in MS patients without RLS. MS patients and higher EDSS score <b>had</b> <b>more</b> <b>RLS</b> symptoms. Conclusions: We suggest that RLS always be considered during neurological examinations of MS patients...|$|E
40|$|Developmental {{dyslexia}} (DD) is {{a common}} kind of learning disorder, which affects 5 - 18 % of people. It seems important to explore the deficit in visual magnocellular pathway in Chinese developmental dyslexia, for many researches demonstrated {{that one of the}} core deficits of Chinese developmental dyslexia was orthographic deficit which was associated with the deficit in visual magnocellular pathway. Two studies were done to detect the differences among Chinese developmental dyslexics, average readers of the same chronological age (CA controls) and average readers of the same reading level (RL controls) in reaction time, accuracy and visual mismatch negativity (vMMN) elicited by the moving gratings responded by visual magnocellular pathway. There were two grating-conditions which were low contrast/low spatial frequency condition and high contrast/high spatial frequency condition respectively. In ERP study, a modified “cross-modal delayed response” paradigm was used to elicit the vMMN. The results showed that the developmental dyslexics responded slower than CA controls, <b>had</b> <b>more</b> errors than <b>RL</b> controls, and had smaller amplitudes of vMMNs than the two controls in visual magnocellular pathway condition, but not in control condition. That is to say, Chinese developmental dyslexics had deficits in visual magnocellular pathway. 发展性阅读障碍（Developmental dyslexia，DD）是一种常见的学习障碍。与拼音文字发展性阅读障碍的核心缺陷是语音缺陷的结论不同，汉语发展性阅读障碍的主要缺陷之一是正字法加工技能缺陷，而正字法加工技能与视觉大细胞通路有显著相关，所以探索汉语发展性阅读障碍的视觉大细胞通路特点显得尤为重要。本研究从行为方面和脑神经方面对汉语DD者进行视觉大细胞通路特点的探索。在行为方面，本研究采用反应时和正确率作为指标研究发展性阅读障碍组儿童、同年龄对照组儿童和同阅读水平对照组儿童视觉大细胞通路的特点。在脑神经方面，利用视觉失匹配负波（visual mismatch negativity, vMMN）探索发展性阅读障碍组儿童与同年龄对照组儿童和同阅读水平对照组儿童对视觉大细胞通路的敏感性。视觉刺激分为视觉大细胞通路条件（低对比度、低空间频率光栅）和对比条件（高对比度、高空间频率光栅）。研究结果为：行为研究中，在视觉大细胞通路条件下，DD组的反应时比同年龄对照组儿童显著延长，虽然DD组与同阅读水平对照组在反应时上没有差异，但是DD组表现出更多的错误。在ERP研究中，在视觉大细胞通路条件下，发展性阅读障碍组的vMMN波幅显著低于同年龄对照组和同阅读水平对照组，而在对比条件下，发展性阅读障碍组儿童与两个对照组儿童的vMMN波幅没有显著差异。这些结果表明汉语发展性阅读障碍儿童存在视觉大细胞通路缺陷。而且，相关分析发现正字法加工技能测验与视觉大细胞通路条件下的vMMN波幅相关显著...|$|R

The exploratory analysis tries to answer the basic research question whether companies strategically managing reverse flows use services of 3 PL more often compared to companies with ad hoc or operative management and what is the role of costs versus benefits in the context of outsourcing of RL activities. The survey was realized among 150 Czech small, middle and big companies from several industries and the size and type of industry are two other contextual factors related to outsourcing decisions. Results show statistically significant relationship between character of planning hierarchy and number of activities performed by 3 PL, where companies that plan RF strategically, employ 3 PL more often. The survey also shows that companies which outsource <b>more</b> <b>RL</b> activities perceive less financial benefits than nonfinancial benefits. Significant dependence was detected between the size of company and number of both benefits perceived with RF management. Very important result shows that activities which are outsourced distinctly more by the companies planning RL strategically belong to the activities creating higher value for companies.

40|$|While {{friendship}} {{patterns and}} the relationship between friendship status and school adjustment have been studied in same-age classrooms, little is known about friendship patterns and the contribution of friendship status to school adjustment in mixed-age classrooms. The purposes of the present study were to investigate friendship patterns in a large sample of mixed-age (ungraded) primary classrooms and to examine the contribution of friendship status to school adjustment in a smaller subsample of ungraded primary children. Peer acceptance level and age relative to classmates both {{had a significant impact on}} the number of reciprocated friends children had, and on the relative age of their friends. High-accepted and relatively old children <b>had</b> <b>more</b> reciprocated friends than did less accepted and relatively young children. Also, high-accepted children <b>had</b> <b>more</b> relatively old, and intermediate age friends than did than average- and low-accepted children, and average-accepted children <b>had</b> <b>more</b> friends at all relative ages than did low-accepted children. Children who were older in relative age <b>had</b> <b>more</b> friends who were also older in relative age than did children who were intermediate and young in relative age. Intermediate age children <b>had</b> <b>more</b> relatively old friends than did relatively young children. Chi square tests of independence revealed that low-accepted children <b>had</b> <b>more</b> friends who were young in relative age, and high-accepted children <b>had</b> <b>more</b> relatively old friends than expected by random pairing, and that relatively young children <b>had</b> <b>more</b> relatively young friends and relatively old children <b>had</b> <b>more</b> relatively old friends than expected by random pairing. There were some similarities in friendship patterns between the larger data sample and the school adjustment subsample. Peer acceptance influenced friendship patterns in a similar manner, however, there was no significant effect of relative age. Also, high- and average-accepted children <b>had</b> <b>more</b> friends who were young and intermediate in relative age than did relatively young children. High-accepted children also <b>had</b> <b>more</b> relatively old friends than did average and low-accepted children, and average-accepted children <b>had</b> <b>more</b> relatively old friends than did low-accepted children. Chi-square analysis revealed patterns similar to those in the larger sample; high-accepted children <b>had</b> <b>more</b> relatively old friends and low-accepted children <b>had</b> <b>more</b> relatively young friends than expected. There was no significant of relative age on the relative age of children 2 ̆ 7 s friends. In the school adjustment subsample, children 2 ̆ 7 s attitudes toward math, reading, and science were positively related to math, reading, and science achievement scores. Friendship status was significantly related to children 2 ̆ 7 s attitudes toward math and achievement scores. Specifically, if children had at least one friend, they <b>had</b> <b>more</b> positive attitudes toward math and higher average achievement scores. Also, females <b>had</b> <b>more</b> positive attitudes toward math, but not other subjects...|$|R
