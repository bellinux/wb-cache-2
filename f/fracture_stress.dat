50|$|Alloying of {{the solid}} metal alters its LME. Some {{alloying}} elements may increase the severity while others may prevent LME. The action of the alloying element {{is known to be}} segregation to grain boundaries {{of the solid}} metal and alteration of the grain boundary properties. Accordingly, maximum LME is seen in cases where alloy additions elements have saturated the grain boundaries of the solid metal. The hardness and deformation behaviour of the solid metal affect its susceptibility to LME. Generally, harder metals are more severely embrittled. Grain size greatly influences LME. Solids with larger grains are more severely embrittled and the <b>fracture</b> <b>stress</b> varies inversely with the square root of grain diameter. Also the brittle to ductile transition temperature is increased by increasing grain size.|$|E
5000|$|Liquid metal {{embrittlement}} or LME {{is characterized by}} the reduction in the threshold stress intensity, true <b>fracture</b> <b>stress</b> or in the strain to fracture when tested in the presence of liquid metals as compared to that obtained in air / vacuum tests.

A ductile-to-brittle transition behaviour is also exhibited by many metal couples. The shape of the elastic region of the stress-strain curve is not altered, but the plastic region may be changed during LME. Very high crack propagation rates, varying from a few centimeters per second to several meters per second are induced in solid metals by the embrittling liquid metals. An incubation period and a slow pre-critical crack propagation stage generally precede final fracture.|$|E

This subject is addressed with a model system involving an epoxy adhesive on a polished silicon wafer containing its native oxide. The proportions of physical and chemical interactions at the interface, and the in-plane distribution, are varied using self-assembling monolayers of octadecyltrichlorosilane (ODTS). The epoxy interacts strongly with the bare silicon oxide surface, but forms only a very weak interface with the methylated tails of the ODTS monolayer.
