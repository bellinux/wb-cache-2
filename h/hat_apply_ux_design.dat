40|$|As user {{experience}} (<b>UX)</b> <b>design</b> {{continues to grow}} and expand, designers often work in areas with few design patterns or social mores. It is easy to make things that {{people do not want}} or will not adopt. To help avoid this problem, we developed a method called speed dating. This method allows design teams to explore possible futures with target users. Speed dating helps {{to reduce the risk of}} making things that people will not adopt. It also discloses opportunities and user needs that design teams might not observe during fieldwork. Over the last decade, we have used this method in many research projects, teaching it to hundreds of <b>UX</b> <b>design</b> students. This article describes the speed dating method, presenting cases to show how speed dating aids <b>UX</b> <b>design...</b>|$|R

40|$|User Experience (UX) {{is a part}} of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) {{and have}} been a topic of {{discussion}} among the researchers in current age. UX research is vital to understand how users react or experience with a particular system both from users and systems perspectives. This study explore about the <b>UX</b> <b>design</b> of educational games (EG). Educational games have attracted many researches due to its popularity among the younger generation. However, its consumption among students and schools are still very much lacking. Thus {{it is important to understand}} the design issues that may contribute enhancement of user experience while using the applications.

40|$|Abstract According to the {{human-centered design}} process, {{prototyping}} {{is an essential}} element of user experience (<b>UX)</b> <b>design.</b> This literature review aims to provide an overview of user experience prototyping and answer the following questions based on previous literature: How does <b>UX</b> <b>design</b> benefit from prototyping? What kinds of prototypes and prototyping tools exist? In which phases of the <b>UX</b> <b>design</b> process is prototyping most valuable? This literature review reveals that prototyping increases the understanding of user needs and context, allows designers to explore and evaluate design ideas and communicate design decisions. Low-fidelity prototypes provide insight early in the design process when possible designs are explored and initial usability evaluations are conducted. High-fidelity and e. g. multi-fidelity prototypes can include more sophisticated interactive features and act as living specification for developers and other stakeholders. Low-fidelity prototyping tools are widely available and easy to use, while higher fidelity tools are often viewed as time consuming and more difficult to use...|$|R

40|$|The User Experience (UX) {{designers}} are undoubtedly {{aware of how}} many <b>UX</b> <b>design</b> methods currently exist and that sometimes it becomes a problem to choose an appropriate one. What are all of methods that designers have in their “arsenal”? When can they use them? This thesis presents the research on the design methods in the contemporary context of User Experience (UX) and Innovations by using a survey approach. The study is limited to cover the domain of consumer mobile services development and provider companies around the world. The study follows 2 clear objectives: (1) to understand what design methods are currently used in that context {{and to what extent}} they are used (2) to identify at what stage according to the <b>UX</b> <b>design</b> thinking process for creating innovations they are placed. The study contributes to the research in the field of <b>UX</b> <b>design</b> and Innovations and extends the knowledge in that field together with communities’ (UXPA, SIGCHI, SIGSOFT) members’ cooperation.

40|$|Integrating User Experience (<b>UX)</b> <b>design</b> with agile {{development}} {{continues to}} be the subject of academic studies and practitioner discussions. Most of the existing literature focuses on SCRUM and XP, but in this paper we investigate a technical company who use DSDM. Unlike other agile methods, DSDM provides a configurable framework and a set of roles that covers the whole software development process. While elements of the <b>UX</b> <b>design</b> integration experience were similar to those reported with other agile methods, working practices to mitigate the challenges were identified using DSDM’s standard elements. Specifically, communication challenges were mitigated by extending two of DSDM’s standard roles. In addition, a change of focus between a design-led phase and a development-led phase of the project changed the communication challenges. Agile teams need to be aware that this change of focus can happen and the implications that it has for their work...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{discussions of}} how User Experience (UX) {{designers}} and Agile developers {{can work together}} have focused on bringing the disciplines together by merging their processes or adopting specific techniques. This paper reports in detail on one observational study of a mature Scrum team in a large organization, and their interactions with the UX designers working on the same project. The evidence from our study shows that Agile development and <b>UX</b> <b>design</b> practice is not explained by rationalized accounts dealing with processes or techniques. Instead, understanding practice requires examining the wider organizational setting in which the Agile developers and UX designers are embedded. Our account focuses on the situatedness of the work by making reference to values and assumptions in the organizational setting, and the consequences that those values and assumptions had for practice. In this organizational setting, cooperation between the Agile developers and UX designers was achieved through ongoing articulation work by the developers, who were compelled to engage a culturally distinct <b>UX</b> <b>design</b> division. Based on this study, insights into culture, self-organization and purposeful work highlight significant implications for practice...|$|R

40|$|At a {{computational}} {{technology company}} called LTC, a large array of employees {{worked together to}} design the user experience (UX) {{of a variety of}} products. The empirical case study explores the relationship amongst the work of <b>UX</b> <b>design,</b> the work setting, and the larger strategic claims being made about the value, efficacy, and importance of design methods. The main research question is: How is the activity of design reflected and constructed by a local culture and material environment? By addressing the way designing occurs in a particular setting, the dissertation unpacks assumptions about setting and ideology within design studies and human-computer interaction. These assumptions impact the legitimacy of design as work, and challenge accepted justifications for the role of design in the development of technological artifacts. A better understanding of design work explores the proliferation of design as a general strategy for problem-solving, while questioning the agenda of this proliferation. The case study follows three accounts of <b>UX</b> <b>design</b> work at LTC. The research connects these accounts to theoretical concerns within design studies and HCI about agency, the setting of design, and the limits on design practice. Ph. D...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, {{we explore}} {{designing}} for enjoyable interactions with public installations based on body motion tracking. We also discuss evaluation of user experience related to such installations. The subject of user experience (UX) is sparsely researched, and its theoretical foundations and methodological approaches are highly debated. A central issue within {{this debate is}} the transferability and application of different theories and concepts from research to speciﬁc <b>UX</b> <b>design</b> and evaluation practices. Another issue is the application of theories {{to the study of}} UX in different use contexts. To tackle these problems, we decided to ‘jump in at the deep end’. We set out to design an audiovisual installation that facilitated for enjoyable user experiences, without clearly deﬁning our goals or methodological approach beforehand. We immersed ourselves in the subject matter throughout the design process by researching technologies, concepts, theories, and methods while doing practical design and testing of prototypes, thereby grounding our speciﬁc design process in relevant theoretical and methodological approaches. Our installation prototype has been evaluated in lab sessions with expert and amateur participants, as well as displayed in two public contexts. This work exempliﬁes how theories and methodologies {{can be applied to the}} practice of <b>UX</b> <b>design</b> and evaluation, and how different contexts can affect the user experience...|$|R
