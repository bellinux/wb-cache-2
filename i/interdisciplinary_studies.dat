5|$|Shimer is {{accredited}} by the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. Its {{core curriculum}} is {{a sequence of}} sixteen required courses in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences and <b>interdisciplinary</b> <b>studies.</b> Basic-studies courses are generally taken {{during the first two}} years, advanced-studies during the final two years and integrative-studies courses in the final year. In addition to core courses students take electives, which offer basic instruction or in-depth work in particular subjects. Students may also take tutorials, with one or two students per course, tailored to their interests and similar in structure to the Oxford tutorial system.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Interdisciplinary</b> <b>Studies</b> program (INTS), a {{department}} in the School of Urban and Public Affairs, {{is one of the}} largest and fastest growing programs on campus. The INTS program allows students to custom build their own program of study resulting in either a B.A.I.S. or B.S.I.S. degree. <b>Interdisciplinary</b> <b>studies</b> is a thirty-five-year-old academic field and the thirteenth most popular major across the United States. The INTS program at UTA is the largest program of its kind in Texas. In building custom degree plans, students mix the required core components with various disciplinary components to meet the academic and professional needs of the student.|$|E
40|$|The {{dissertation}} analyzes {{what factors}} empower {{the design of}} <b>interdisciplinary</b> <b>study</b> programmes as innovation at university. In order to reveal the peculiarities {{of the development of}} <b>interdisciplinary</b> <b>study</b> programs at the university, the dissertation highlights different interpretations of the concept of interdisciplinarity, discusses the definitions of different <b>interdisciplinary</b> (multiple disciplinarity) <b>study</b> programmes, purifies the peculiarities of <b>interdisciplinary</b> <b>study</b> programmes that influence the process of their design. In addition, the dissertation discusses the features of the empowerment phenomenon and highlights main theoretical factors that could empower the development of <b>interdisciplinary</b> <b>study</b> programs as an innovation in the university. Empirical research allowed making sure that factors empowering the <b>interdisciplinary</b> <b>study</b> programme as innovation design depend on the context of the design of a particular study programme, i. e. different context of an <b>interdisciplinary</b> <b>study</b> programme design shows several different factors of empowerment. Research allowed to confirm the assumption that empowering factors should change when the design of <b>interdisciplinary</b> <b>study</b> programmes becomes a routine activity...|$|R

25|$|Dune was not {{immediately}} a bestseller. By 1968 Herbert had made $20,000 from it, far more than most science fiction novels of the time were generating, {{but not enough to}} let him take up full-time writing. However, the publication of Dune did open doors for him. He was the Seattle Post-Intelligencer's education writer from 1969 to 1972 and lecturer in general studies and <b>interdisciplinary</b> <b>studies</b> at the University of Washington (1970â€“1972). He worked in Vietnam and Pakistan as social and ecological consultant in 1972. In 1973 he was director-photographer of the television show The Tillers.|$|E

25|$|A {{key part}} of the Scripps {{experience}} is the Core Curriculum in <b>Interdisciplinary</b> <b>Studies,</b> a sequence of three classes that encourage students to think critically and challenge ideas. Every first-year student takes Core I in the fall, which introduces students to major ideas that shape the modern world. Core II seminars focus on specific ideas introduced in Core I and are usually team-taught by two professors in different fields, such as physics and art. The concluding Core III classes encourage discussion and critical thinking for first-semester sophomores, culminating in individual projects that often lead to students' senior thesis or project.|$|E

The majors that are available include Biomedical Computing, Business Information Management, Computer Game Science, Computer Science, Computer Science & Engineering, Informatics, Information and Computer Science, and Software Engineering.|$|E
25|$|Velikovsky's revised {{chronology}} {{has been}} rejected by nearly all mainstream historians and Egyptologists. It was claimed, starting with early reviewers, that Velikovsky's usage of material for proof is often very selective. In 1965 the leading cuneiformist Abraham Sachs, in a forum at Brown University, discredited Velikovsky's use of Mesopotamian cuneiform sources. Velikovsky {{was never able to}} refute Sachs' attack. In 1978, following the much-postponed publication of further volumes in Velikovsky's Ages in Chaos series, the United Kingdom-based Society for <b>Interdisciplinary</b> <b>Studies</b> organised a conference in Glasgow specifically to debate the revised chronology. The ultimate conclusion of this work, by scholars including Peter James, John Bimson, Geoffrey Gammonn, and David Rohl, was that the Revised Chronology was untenable. The SIS has continued to publish updates of this ongoing discussion, in particular the work of historian Emmet Sweeney.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} recent of Rensselaer's {{research}} centers is the Center for Biotechnology and <b>Interdisciplinary</b> <b>Studies,</b> a 218,000 square-foot research facility and a national pacesetter for fundamental and applied research in biotechnology. The primary target of the research center is biologics, a research priority based on data-driven understanding of proteomics, protein regulation, and gene regulation. It involves using biocatalysis and synthetic biology tools to block or supplement the actions of specific cells or proteins in the immune system. Over the past decade, CBIS has produced over 2,000 peer-reviewed publications with over 30,000 citations and currently employs over 200 scientists and engineers. The center is also used primarily to train undergraduate and graduate students, with over 1,000 undergraduates and 200 doctoral students trained. The center also has numerous academic and industry partners including the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. These partnerships have resulted in numerous advances over the last decade through new commercial developments in diagnostics, therapeutics, medical devices, and regenerative medicine which are a direct result of research at the center. Examples of advancements include the creation of synthetic heparin, antimicrobial coatings, detoxification chemotherapy, on-demand bio-medicine, implantable sensors, and 3D cellular array chips.|$|E
