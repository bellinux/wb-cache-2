5|$|Roark {{is arrested}} and his action is widely condemned, but Wynand decides {{to use his}} papers to defend his friend.

Faced {{with the prospect of}} closing the paper, Wynand gives in and publishes a denunciation of Roark. At his trial, Roark makes a speech about the value of ego and integrity, and he is found not guilty. Dominique leaves Wynand for Roark. Wynand, who has betrayed his own values by attacking Roark, finally grasps the nature of the power he thought he held. <b>He</b> <b>shuts</b> down the Banner and commissions a final building from Roark, a skyscraper that will serve as a monument to human achievement. Eighteen months later, the Wynand Building is under construction. Dominique, now Roark's wife, enters the site to meet him atop its steel framework.|$|E

2500|$|Beckett's prose pieces {{during the}} late period were not so {{prolific}} as his theatre, {{as suggested by the}} title of the 1976 collection of short prose texts Fizzles (which the American artist Jasper Johns illustrated). Beckett experienced something of a renaissance with the novella Company (1980), which continued with Ill Seen Ill Said (1982) and Worstward Ho (1984), later collected in Nohow On. In these three [...] "'closed space' stories," [...] Beckett continued his preoccupation with memory and its effect on the confined and observed self, {{as well as with the}} positioning of bodies in space, as the opening phrases of Company make clear: [...] "A voice comes to one in the dark. Imagine." [...] "To one on his back in the dark. This he can tell by the pressure on his hind parts and by how the dark changes when <b>he</b> <b>shuts</b> his eyes and again when he opens them again. Only a small part of what is said can be verified. As for example when he hears, You are on your back in the dark. Then he must acknowledge the truth of what is said." [...] Themes of aloneness and the doomed desire to successfully connect with other human beings are expressed in several late pieces, including Company and Rockaby.|$|E

2500|$|In a July 2005 interview, Rowling {{added that}} Draco, unlike Harry, never feels remorse for his actions: [...] "I thought of Draco {{as someone who}} is very capable of compartmentalising his life and his emotions, and always has done.
