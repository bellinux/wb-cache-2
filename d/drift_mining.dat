5|$|Lethbridge is the commercial, financial, {{transportation}} and industrial centre of southern Alberta. The city's economy developed from <b>drift</b> <b>mining</b> for coal {{in the late}} 19th century and agriculture in the early 20th century. Half of the workforce is employed in the health, education, retail and hospitality sectors, and the top five employers are government-based. The only university in Alberta south of Calgary is in Lethbridge, {{and two of the}} three colleges in southern Alberta have campuses in the city. Cultural venues in the city include performing art theatres, museums and sports centres.|$|E
5|$|By {{the turn}} of the 18th century, Felling {{consisted}} of little more than the large Brandling estate and a small scattering of tiny farming villages. However, Ralph Brandling, the incumbent of the Brandling estate at that time, had come to realise the value of the rich coal deposits on his estate and began <b>drift</b> <b>mining</b> around 1670. He initially found the large coal seams under his estate difficult to extract due to their depth, and indeed it was imported coal from Newcastle-upon-Tyne which saw the development of more extensive industries in salt, glass and chemicals which began to attract workers to the area. At around 1750, a large copper-works was opened at the banks of the River Tyne; the first such works to be developed on the river. Encouraged by these developments, Ralph Brandling's son, Charles Brandling, firstly commissioned more extensive mining of near-surface coal on his estate and then, encouraged by the discovery of several strata below his estate, began boring operations in 1758 to allow ultimately for deeper coal extraction. The result was the opening of Felling Colliery in 1779, working on the High Main stratum at a depth of 125 fathoms. A brown paper mill was also opened in 1798.|$|E
25|$|The town {{also has}} a history of coal mining. Coal pits were opened in Hooley Clough in the early 19th century by the Lord of the Manor of Rochdale. During the 19th century a {{colliery}} at Captain Fold was run by the Heywood Coal Company. Two people were killed at Captain Fold Colliery between 1844 and 1848. When the mine flooded in 1852 two more people were killed and the colliery closed soon after. Mining continued in the town with <b>drift</b> <b>mining</b> in Bamford until 1950.|$|E
5000|$|... in 1885 Long Meg <b>Drift</b> <b>mine</b> {{was opened}} by the Long Meg Plaster Company Limited, and the <b>drift</b> <b>mine</b> was {{connected}} to the Midland Railway in 1886.|$|R
50|$|The mine opened about 1889 on {{what had}} been {{operated}} as a <b>drift</b> <b>mine.</b> Commercial development of the <b>drift</b> <b>mine</b> began in 1905 and the first coal was shipped on January 4, 1906. Mine operations ceased in 1953, and the property sold to the City of Beckley.|$|R
50|$|The Drifting-2 (æ¼‚-2, or Piao-2) <b>drifting</b> <b>mine</b> {{is a small}} <b>drifting</b> <b>mine</b> jointly {{developed}} by the 710th Research Institute and Dalian Crane Factory. This <b>drifting</b> <b>mine</b> system {{is the first in}} Chinese service {{to be able to be}} taken apart for easier transportation, and then assembled just before being planted, and it is designed to float just below the surface of the water to avoid being visually detected. This mine is mainly for riverine and coastal use and can also be used as part of the moored mine system.|$|R
25|$|Sub-surface mining {{consists}} of digging tunnels or shafts {{into the earth}} to reach buried ore deposits. Ore, for processing, and waste rock, for disposal, are brought to the surface through the tunnels and shafts. Sub-surface mining can be classified {{by the type of}} access shafts used, the extraction method or the technique used to reach the mineral deposit. <b>Drift</b> <b>mining</b> utilizes horizontal access tunnels, slope mining uses diagonally sloping access shafts, and shaft mining utilizes vertical access shafts. Mining in hard and soft rock formations require different techniques.|$|E
500|$|Historically, other dams {{along the}} river's middle reaches were removed or {{destroyed}} {{during the first}} half of the 20thcentury. The Ament Dam, built in 1902 by the Golden <b>Drift</b> <b>Mining</b> Company to provide water for mining equipment, was slightly upriver of Grants Pass. After the company failed to keep promises to provide irrigation and electric power to the vicinity and because the dam was a [...] "massive fish killer", vigilantes destroyed part of the dam with dynamite in 1912. The damaged dam was completely removed before construction of the Savage Rapids Dam in 1921.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Drift</b> <b>mining</b> {{methods were}} used {{extensively}} to mine placer deposits {{during the early}} years (1899- [...] ) of the Nome mining district. During summer, surface deposits could be worked, but some placer deposits were buried too deeply for surface placering. In addition, water to wash the gold from the placers was not available in the winter. Many miners tunneled into deep placer deposits, bringing out the high-grade gravels to be washed at the spring thaw. Most of the ground in Nome is permafrost. By <b>drift</b> <b>mining,</b> miners were able to recover much of the gold buried under the permafrost.|$|E
50|$|Gold was {{discovered}} on Long Creek in 1910. Seasonal mining was almost continuous until 1977, and continued intermittently in to 1993. Early {{work was done}} by underground <b>drift</b> <b>mining,</b> later work by open-cut methods, and by reworking old tailings.|$|E
50|$|After World War I the <b>drifting</b> contact <b>mine</b> was banned, but was {{occasionally}} {{used during}} World War II. The <b>drifting</b> <b>mines</b> were {{much harder to}} remove than tethered mines after the war, and they caused about the same damage to both sides.|$|R

5000|$|Though {{known as}} a center for {{hydraulic}} mining, there was also <b>drift</b> <b>mining</b> around Blue Tent. [...] In one reported instance, Weston, Holmes and Co set off a blast of 304 kegs of black powder inside a tunnel that ran 65 feet into a hill.|$|E
5000|$|A [...] "drift" [...] is a {{more general}} term for any near-horizontal {{underground}} passage in a mine. Unlike an adit, a drift need not break out to the surface. <b>Drift</b> <b>mining</b> {{is the use of}} drifts to extract ore - in this case the drifts follow the vein.|$|E
50|$|Initial {{exploration}} and mining work {{was carried out}} by means of drift diggings, followed by ground sluicing and hydraulicking later. <b>Drift</b> <b>mining</b> and hydraulicking were both abandoned in the 1930s as there were no dumping facilities for mining waste. Later exploration to bedrock in pursuit of hard-rock ores met with little success.|$|E

50|$|Eckington <b>mine</b> is a <b>drift</b> <b>mine</b> {{situated}} on {{the eastern edge of}} the township of Eckington, Derbyshire, England, 7 mi South-West of Sheffield. , it was the only colliery in production in North East Derbyshire.|$|R
50|$|Adits {{are driven}} {{into the side of}} a hill or {{mountain}}, and are often used when an ore body is located inside the mountain but above the adjacent valley floor or coastal plain. In cases where the mineral vein outcrops at the surface, the adit may follow the lode or vein until it is worked out, in which case the adit is rarely straight. The use of adits for the extraction of ore is generally called <b>drift</b> <b>mining.</b>|$|E
50|$|The No. 2 and No. 3 Rhondda {{house and}} {{bituminous}} coals which outcrop along the valley were quickly proved and the Aber, Caedu and Tynewydd collieries were opened by <b>drift</b> <b>mining</b> {{driven into the}} seams from the mountain sides. In {{the latter part of}} 1865, John Brogden and Sons commenced the sinking of the two shafts at the Wyndham Colliery to prove and work the high quality smokeless dry steam coals of the Lower Coal Measures.|$|E
50|$|The two shafts {{that served}} Daw Mill were first sunk between 1956 and 1959, and 1969 and 1971 respectively. The mine {{was a natural}} {{extension}} of the former collieries Kingsbury Colliery and Dexter Colliery, both of which have also closed. In 1983 an inclined tunnel linking underground workings with the surface was completed. This <b>drift</b> <b>mining</b> enabled Daw Mill to increase its production capacity as it removed the often time-consuming process of winding coal up the shafts.|$|E

5000|$|The {{capacity}} or {{output of}} the mines of the State varies greatly. Thick coals are capable of a greater daily output than thin seams, and {{as a general rule}} <b>drift</b> <b>mines</b> possess greater advantages for loading coal rapidly than shaft mining openings. In many of the mines of the great vein region of the Hocking valley the capacity is equal to 1,200 to 1,500 tons per day. In shaft mines 600 to 700 tons daily is regarded as a good output.The first ton of coal in a shaft mine 100 feet in depth and having a daily capacity of 600 tons frequently costs the mining adventurer upwards of $20,000 (1888), and cases are on record where owing to the extraordinary amount of water in sinking, $100,000 (1888) have been expended before coal was reached. <b>Drift</b> <b>mines,</b> as they require no machinery for pumping water and raising coal, cost less than half the amount required in shaft mining.Water is, however, an expensive item in <b>drift</b> <b>mines</b> opened on the dip slope of the coal, and underground hauling under such conditions is unusually costly.|$|R
