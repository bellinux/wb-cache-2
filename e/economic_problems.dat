40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is {{clarifying}} economical problems of primary and secondary school teachers and effects of these problems on their performance. The data in the study were picked up with qualitative and quantitative ways. Among the primary and secondary school teachers in private and state schools within the municipality boarders of Denizli, 903 teachers were chosen with quantitative method and 109 of the rest were chosen through qualitative method for the proportional group sampling work. According to the findings of the study, problems based on likert type concerning opinions of primary and secondary school teachers <b>economic</b> <b>problem</b> to agree is "completely agree" and <b>economic</b> <b>problem</b> to face is "always" and <b>economic</b> <b>problem</b> influencing the performance is "very".

According to primary and secondary school teachers' opinions our open-ended written poll, the most important <b>economic</b> <b>problem</b> to agree is "insufficient wages" and the most important <b>economic</b> <b>problem</b> to face is home rent, bills, credit card payment" and the most important <b>economic</b> <b>problem</b> influencing the performance is "the income which does not meet the expenditures"...|$|R

5|$|Mired in <b>economic</b> <b>problems,</b> Cuba was {{aided by}} the {{election}} of socialist and anti-imperialist Hugo Chávez to the Venezuelan Presidency in 1999. Castro and Chávez developed a close friendship, with the former acting as a mentor and father-figure to the latter, and together they built an alliance that had repercussions throughout Latin America. In 2000, they signed an agreement through which Cuba would send 20,000 medics to Venezuela, in return receiving 53,000 barrels of oil per day at preferential rates; in 2004, this trade was stepped up, with Cuba sending 40,000 medics and Venezuela providing 90,000 barrels a day. That same year, Castro initiated Misión Milagro, a joint medical project which aimed to provide free eye operations on 300,000 individuals from each nation. The alliance boosted the Cuban economy, and in May 2005 Castro doubled the minimum wage for 1.6 million workers, raised pensions, and delivered new kitchen appliances to Cuba's poorest residents. Some <b>economic</b> <b>problems</b> remained; in 2004, Castro shut down 118 factories, including steel plants, sugar mills and paper processors to compensate for a critical shortage of fuel.|$|E

40|$|Under normal conditions, devoting more {{resources}} to X’s produc-tion produces more X. This follows from {{the nature of the}} physical world, which positively relates quantities of outputs to quantities of inputs used in their production. In principles of economics classes, it is common to highlight that this relationship {{has nothing to do with}} the <b>economic</b> <b>problem.</b> The <b>economic</b> <b>problem</b> asks how to produce X in the least-cost way, whether to produce more or less X, and indeed, whether to produce any X at all given the alternative uses of the inputs required to produce it. Solving the <b>economic</b> <b>problem</b> determines whether a country’s economy develops. It is strange, then, that professional economists have had trouble distinguishing the positive relationship between inputs and outputs from solving the <b>economic</b> <b>problem</b> when it comes to evaluating foreign aid. 1 The purpose of this article is to make this distinction, and in doing so to clarify what aid can and can-not do...|$|R
5|$|A {{slackening}} {{of social}} customs occurred on all social levels; extramarital relationships and illegitimate children were common. Because poverty {{was on the}} rise—especially in the lower classes—many women were forced to find lodgings quickly, for example in convents, o.

5|$|Alfonsín {{began his}} term with many <b>economic</b> <b>problems.</b> The foreign debt was nearly 43billion dollars {{by the end}} of the year, and the country had {{narrowly}} prevented a sovereign default in 1982. During that year, the gross domestic product fell by 5.6%, and the manufacturing profits by 55%. Unemployment was at nearly 10%, and inflation was nearly 209%. It also appeared unlikely that the country would receive the needed foreign investment. The country had a deficit of $6.7billion. Possible solutions such as a devaluation of the currency, privatization of industry, or restrictions on imports, would probably have proven to be unpopular.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the 1973 oil crisis, {{combined}} with the growing influence of Third World alignments such as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and the Non-Aligned Movement, less-powerful countries had more room to assert their independence and often showed themselves resistant to pressure from either superpower. Meanwhile, Moscow was forced to turn its attention inward to deal with the Soviet Union's deep-seated domestic <b>economic</b> <b>problems.</b> During this period, Soviet leaders such as Leonid Brezhnev and Alexei Kosygin embraced the notion of détente.|$|E

5|$|Communally, {{conditions}} for black Harlemites improved by 1943, with better employment in civil services, for instance. <b>Economic</b> <b>problems</b> became exacerbated under wartime conditions; new war and non-war industries and business continued {{to discriminate against}} blacks. Though new projects such as the Harlem River Houses were intended to expand black housing, by 1943, overall Harlem housing had deteriorated as new construction slowed due to diversion of efforts to the war, and buildings were destroyed in preparation for replacement. Although the state of African Americans improved relative to society, individuals could not accelerate their own progress.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, the Alaska Railroad {{purchased}} the Tanana Valley Railroad, which had {{suffered from the}} wartime <b>economic</b> <b>problems.</b> The railroad line was extended westward, until it reached the town of Nenana and a construction party working north from Ship Creek, later renamed Anchorage. Until the railroad was finished and coal from Healy became available, Fairbanks burned wood as a heating source and to provide electricity. In 1913, the town burned between 12,000 and 14,000 cords of wood, with the Northern Commercial Company (owners of the power plant) burning 8,500 cords alone.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{estimated}} that all the English witch trials between the early 15th and early 18th centuries resulted in fewer than 500 executions, so this one series of trials in July and August 1612 accounts for more than two per cent of that total. Court records show that Lancashire was unusual in the north of England for the frequency of its witch trials. Neighbouring Cheshire, for instance, also suffered from <b>economic</b> <b>problems</b> and religious activists, but there only 47 people were indicted for causing harm by witchcraft between 1589 and 1675, of whom 11 were found guilty.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a sequential approach with matrix framework for solving {{various kinds of}} <b>economic</b> dispatch <b>problems.</b> The objective of the <b>economic</b> dispatch <b>problems</b> of electrical power generation is to schedule the committed generating units output so as to meet the required load demand while satisfying the system equality and inequality constraints. This is a maiden approach developed to obtain the optimal dispatches of generating units for all possible load demands of power system in a single execution. The feasibility of the proposed method is demonstrated by solving <b>economic</b> load dispatch <b>problem,</b> combined <b>economic</b> and emission dispatch <b>problem,</b> multiarea <b>economic</b> dispatch <b>problem</b> and <b>economic</b> dispatch <b>problem</b> with multiple fuel options. The proposed methodology is tested with different scale of power systems. The generating unit operational constraints are also considered. The simulation results obtained by proposed methodology for various <b>economic</b> dispatch <b>problems</b> are compared with previous literatures in terms of solution quality. Numerical simulation results indicate an improvement in total cost saving and hence {{the superiority of the}} proposed method is also revealed for <b>economic</b> dispatch <b>problems...</b>|$|R

5000|$|The <b>economic</b> <b>problem</b> is most simply {{explained}} by the question: [...] "How do we satisfy unlimited wants with limited resources?"

The economic problem—and methods to curb it—revolve around the idea of choice in prioritizing which wants can be fulfilled and what to produce for the economy.|$|R
