40|$|In {{response}} to starvation, bacilli and clostridia undergo a specialized program of development {{that results in}} the production of a highly resistant dormant cell type known as the spore. A proteinacious shell, called the coat, encases the spore and {{plays a major role in}} spore survival. The coat is composed of over 25 polypeptide species, organized into several morphologically distinct layers. The mechanisms that <b>guide</b> <b>coat</b> assembly have been largely unknown until recently. We now know that proper formation of the coat relies on the genetic program that guides the synthesis of spore components during development as well as on morphogenetic proteins dedicated to coat assembly. Over 20 structural and morphogenetic genes have been cloned. In this review, we consider the contributions of the known coat and morphogenetic proteins to coat function and assembly. We present a model that describes how morphogenetic proteins direct coat assembly to the specific subcellular site of the nascent spore surface and how they establish the coat layers. We also discuss the importance of posttranslational processing of coat proteins in coat morphogenesis. Finally, we review some of the major outstanding questions in the field...|$|E

40|$|Organic {{thin film}} {{transistors}} (OTFTs) based on single crystalline thin films of organic semiconductors have seen considerable {{development in the}} recent years. The most successful method for the fabrication of single crystalline films are solution-based meniscus <b>guided</b> <b>coating</b> techniques such as dip-coating, solution shearing or zone casting. These upscalable methods enable rapid and efficient film formation without additional processing steps. The single-crystalline film quality {{is strongly dependent on}} solvent choice, substrate temperature and coating speed. So far, however, process optimization has been conducted by trial and error methods, involving, for example, the variation of coating speeds over several orders of magnitude. Through a systematic study of solvent phase change dynamics in the meniscus region, we develop a theoretical framework that links the optimal coating speed to the solvent choice and the substrate temperature. In this way, we can accurately predict an optimal processing window, enabling fast process optimization. Our approach is verified through systematic OTFT fabrication based on films grown with different semiconductors, solvents and substrate temperatures. The use of best predicted coating speeds delivers state of the art devices. In the case of C 8 BTBT, OTFTs show well-behaved characteristics with mobilities up to 7 cm 2 /Vs and onset voltages close to 0 V. Our approach also explains well optimal recipes published in the literature.

40|$|Recent {{efforts in}} {{scientific}} {{research in the}} field of peripheral nerve regeneration have been directed towards the development of artificial nerve guides. We have studied various materials with the aim of obtaining a biocompatible and biodegradable two layer guide for nerve repair. The candidate materials for use as an external layer for the nerve guides were poly(caprolactone) (PCL), a biosynthetic blend between PCL and chitosan (CS) and a synthesised poly(esterurethane) (PU). Blending PCL, which is a biocompatible synthetic polymer, with a natural polymer enhanced the system biocompatibility and biomimetics, fastened the degradation rates and reduced the production costs. Various novel block poly(ester-urethane) s are being synthesised by our group with tailored properties for specific tissue engineering applications. One of these poly(ester-urethane) s, based on a low molecular weight poly(caprolactone) as the macrodiol, cycloesandimethanol as the chain extender and hexamethylene diisocyanate as the chain linker, was investigated for the production of melt extruded nerve guides.

Methods: These techniques simulated the routine of guide wire reprocessing in many hemodynamic services in Brazil and other countries.

Results: A single or double sterilization of the catheters with ethylene oxide was not associated with morphological or chemical changes.

Methods and results: A new self-expanding stent and delivery system (SDS) was deployed through a hydrophilic-coated (Flexor® Ansel; Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN, USA) guiding sheath into the iliac and/or carotid arteries of 23 anaesthetised Yucatan mini swine. The animals were euthanised at three, 30, 90 and 180 days and their brains were removed for histological analysis. In an additional single control animal, the guiding sheath was advanced but no SDS was deployed. Advancement of the <b>coated</b> <b>guiding</b> sheath {{with or without the}} SDS was associated with frequent foreign material in the arterioles of the brain. The embolic material was amorphous, non-refractile, non-crystalline, non-birefringent and typically lightly basophilic with a slightly stippled appearance on haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain. Material was observed at all time points involving 54 % of all study animals (i. e., test and control) and in vitro after incubation in 0. 9 % saline.

The use of coatings containing osseoconductive ceramic particles {{is one of the}} actively explored strategies to improve osseointegration and strengthen the bone-implant interface for general tissue engineering. Our hypothesis is that hydroxyapatite (HA) particles can be coated robustly on specific assemblies of PVA hydrogel fibers for the potential anchoring of ligament replacements. A simple dip-coating method is described to produce composite coatings made of microscopic hydroxyapatite (HA) particles dispersed in a poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) matrix. The materials are compatible with the requirements for implant Good Manufacturing Practices. They are applied to coat bundles of PVA hydrogel fibers used for the development of ligament implants. By means of optical and electronic microscopy, we show that the coating thickness and surface state can be adjusted by varying the composition of the dipping solution. Quantitative analysis based on backscattered electron microscopy show that the exposure of HA at the coating surface can be tuned from 0 to over 55 % by decreasing the weight ratio of PVA over HA from 0. 4 to 0. 1. Abrasion experiments simulating bone-implant contact illustrate how the coating cohesion and wear resistance increase by increasing the content of PVA relative to HA. Using pullout experiments, we find that these coatings adhere well to the fiber bundles and detach by propagation of a crack inside the coating.

The OSIRIS instrument consists of two parts, a high-resolution powder diffractometer and a micro-eV resolution inelastic spectrometer. The incident cold neutron beam has the option of being polarised {{by means of a}} series of interchangeable polarising benders. The inelastic spectrometer consists of an analyser array constructed from pyrolytic graphite crystals situated in nearbackscattering geometry.

Ti / Co 66 at. % Cr 22 at. % Pt 12 at. % (CoCrPt) films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy were deposited on silicon wafers by UHV sputtering. Ti was used as an adhesion layer and texture promoter so that the easy magnetic axis of Co is aligned perpendicular to the sample plane. Magnetic reversal of Ti/CoCrPt films and Ti/CoCrPt/Ti/CoCrPt pseudo spin valve films is a domain nucleation and growth process with a slow time-dependent magnetization reversal which was attributed to growth of reverse domains. The films were patterned into nanosized islands by block copolymer lithography using self assembled polystyrene-polyferrocenyldimethylsilane (PS-PFS) as a mask. The islands reverse their magnetization in a coherent and independent fashion (StonerWohlfarth reversal), in contrast to the continuous film. Micromagnetic simulation confirmed the coherent reversal of the thicker islands. Two graphoepitaxy methods were examined for inducing long range order (LRO) in block copolymers. Nanoimprint lithography with in-situ annealing was successful in guiding the self assembly of the block copolymers in the grooves, however, no LRO was achieved.

In my optical cell sorting and guiding investigations, a new technique for enhancing the dielectric contrast of mammalian cells, which is a result of cells naturally engulfing polymer microspheres from their environment, is introduced.

40|$|The {{design of}} the next {{generation}} of reusable launch vehicles calls for using GRCop- 84 copper alloy liners based on a composition invented at the NASA Glenn Research Center. Despite its considerable advantage over other copper alloys, it is expected that GRCop- 84 will suffer from environmental degradation {{depending on the type of}} rocket fuels used and on thermomechanical fatigue. Applying protective coatings on GRCop- 84 substrates can minimize or eliminate many of these problems and extend the operational life of the combustion liner. This could increase component reliability, shorten depot maintenance turnaround times, and lower operating costs. Therefore, Glenn is actively pursuing the development of advanced coatings technology for GRCop- 84 liners. Technology is being developed in four major areas: (1) new metallic coating compositions, (2) application techniques, (3) test methods, and (4) life prediction design methodology using finite element analysis. The role of finite element analysis in <b>guiding</b> the <b>coating</b> effort is discussed in this report. Thermal analyses were performed at Glenn for different combinations of top- and bondcoat compositions to determine the temperature variation across the coated cross section with the thickness of the top coat. These calculations were conducted for simulated LH 2 /LO 2 booster engine conditions assuming that the bond coat had a constant thickness of 50 m. The preceding graphs show the predicted temperatures at the outer surface of the top coat (hot wall), at the top-coat/bond-coat interface, at the bond-coat/GRCop- 84 interface, and at the GRCop- 84 cold wall as a function of top-coat thickness for Cu- 26 (wt%) Cr top coat (top graph), Ni- 17 (wt%) Cr- 6 %Al- 0. 5 %Y top coat and Cu- 26 %Cr bond coat, and NiAl top coat and Ni bond coat. In all cases, the temperature of the top coat at the hot wall increased with increasing top-coat thickness and with corresponding decreases in the temperatures at the two interfaces and the cold wall. These temperatures are not acutely sensitive to the thermal conductivity of the top coat when it exceeds 25 and 50 W/m/K for low and high heat flux engines. This observation is significant for two reasons. First, several different top-coat compositions can be evaluated as potential protective coatings without loss in the heat-transfer efficiency of the coated system. Second, materials with thermal conductivities less than the critical values of 25 or 50 W/m/K are more likely to act as thermal barrier coatings. The deposition of overlay coatings on GRCop- 84 substrates results in the development of residual stresses. The presence of these residual stresses influences the probability of coating spallation, the thermal cycling life, and the fatigue properties of the coated substrate during use. Since it is important to understand how these stresses develop during the vacuum-plasma-spraying coating deposition process, the nature and magnitudes of the cool-down residual stresses were calculated and compared with experimentally determined values across the coated cross section of a disk specimen. The calculations were conducted assuming that the specimen cools down to room temperature from vacuum plasma-spraying temperatures of either 250 or 650 C. The effects of coating the substrate with and without grit blasting were also theoretically examined. The final graph compares the predicted and the experimental results for a GRCop- 84 disk coated with about a 50 - m-thick Ni bond coat and a 75 - to 100 - m NiAl top coat, where the curves for NASA- 2 assume the presence of a prior residual stress generated by grit blasting under conditions similar to the experimental situation. The predicted cool-down in-plane stresses were compressive in both the NiAl top coat and the Ni bond coat. They were also compressive in the substrate to a depth of about 0. 25 mm from the Ni/GRCop- 84 interface when the vacuum-plasma-spraying temperature was low. However, using a higher plasma spraying temperaturs likely to leave the substrate under a small tensile stress to counter the compressive stresses in the bond and top coats because of the relaxation of residual stresses generated in the substrate during the grit blasting of its surface prior to spraying. These results suggest that the NiAl and Ni coatings are unlikely to spall after spraying as confirmed by the microstructural observations shown in the following photomicrograph of an as-sprayed specimen. Finally, it is noted that the calculated and experimental results are not in complete agreement, which indicates that both the experimental and modeling techniques need further refinement...|$|R
