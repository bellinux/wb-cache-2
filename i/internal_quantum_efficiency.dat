50|$|Iridium {{complexes}} such as Ir(mppy)3 {{have been}} examined {{in the context of}} phosphorescent organic light-emitting diode technology to increase the <b>internal</b> <b>quantum</b> <b>efficiency</b> from 25% to almost 100% by harvesting emission from triplet states.|$|E
50|$|<b>Internal</b> <b>Quantum</b> <b>Efficiency</b> (IQE) is {{the ratio}} of the number of charge {{carriers}} collected by the solar cell to the number of photons of a given energy that shine on the solar cell from outside and are absorbed by the cell.|$|E
50|$|The GML nanofilm only 100 {{nanometers}} thick {{can absorb}} the entire Sun spectrum (0.3-2.0+ eV). At the same time, gradient of the quantum dots size {{can create a}} gradient of the electrochemical potential, acting as an equivalent of built-in electric field inside a nanofilm.

40|$|We {{focus on}} the {{determination}} of the <b>internal</b> luminescence <b>quantum</b> <b>efficiency</b> of a green-emitting organic light-emitting diode (OLED). By considering different geometrical configurations of OLED thin-film stacks, we elucidate the role of the <b>internal</b> luminescence <b>quantum</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the emitter in the thin-film microcavity. Combining optical simulations with experimental results, a comprehensive efficiency analysis is performed. Here the electroluminescence of a set of OLEDs is characterized. Additionally, the devices are characterized using time-resolved photoluminescence measurements. The experimental data are analyzed using optical simulations. This analysis leads to a quantification of <b>internal</b> luminescence <b>quantum</b> <b>efficiency</b> and allows conclusions about competing mechanisms resulting in nonradiative recombination of charge carriers...|$|R
40|$|External <b>quantum</b> <b>efficiency</b> of industrial-grade green InGaN {{light-emitting}} diodes (LEDs) has been measured {{in a wide}} range of operating currents at various temperatures from 13 K to 300 K. Unlike blue LEDs, the efficiency as a function of current is found to have a multi-peak character, which could not be fitted by a simple ABC-model. This observation correlated with splitting of LED emission spectra into two peaks at certain currents. The characterization data are interpreted in terms of non-uniformity of the LED active region, which is tentatively attributed to extended defects like V-pits. We suggest a new approach to evaluation of temperature-dependent light extraction and <b>internal</b> <b>quantum</b> <b>efficiencies</b> taking into account the active region non-uniformity. As a result, the temperature dependence of light extraction and <b>internal</b> <b>quantum</b> <b>efficiencies</b> have been evaluated in the temperature range mentioned above and compared with those of blue LEDs...|$|R

50|$|Non-radiative {{life time}} is the average time before an {{electron}} in the conduction band of a semiconductor recombines with a hole non-radiatively. It is an important parameter in optoelectronics where radiative recombination is required to produce a photon; if the non-radiative life time is shorter than the radiative, then a carrier {{is more likely to}} recombine non-radiatively. This results in low <b>internal</b> <b>quantum</b> <b>efficiency.</b>|$|E
50|$|In OLEDs using {{fluorescent}} {{organic molecules}} only, {{the decay of}} triplet excitons is quantum mechanically forbidden by selection rules, meaning that the lifetime of triplet excitons is long and phosphorescence is not readily observed. Hence it would be expected that in fluorescent OLEDs only the formation of singlet excitons results in the emission of useful radiation, placing a theoretical limit on the <b>internal</b> <b>quantum</b> <b>efficiency</b> (the percentage of excitons formed that result in emission of a photon) of 25%.|$|E

40|$|InGaAs/AlGaAs large {{optical cavity}} (LOC) single quantum well (SQW) lasers {{emitting}} at 980 nm were grown incorporating an AlGaAs/GaAs short-period superlattice layer {{next to the}} quantum well {{in order to improve}} the carder confinement and thus high-temperature operation. Symmetric and asymmetric structures have been realized. High characteristic temperatures T 0 above 300 K between 20 °C and 50 °C operating temperature were measured for the symmetric structures without deterioration of the <b>internal</b> <b>quantum</b> <b>efficiencies</b> (&# 62; 90 %) and low intrinsic losses (about 1 cm- 1). The improvement in the characteristic temperature is mainly attributed to the reduced thermionic emission of the carriers out of the quantum well due to the large effective barrier height of the short-period superlattice. Caused by the incorporation of the short-period superlattice the devices showed a higher series resistance, which could be lowered by switching to asymmetric structures.

50|$|Indium {{antimonide}} photodiode detectors are photovoltaic, generating {{electric current}} when subjected to infrared radiation. InSb's <b>internal</b> <b>quantum</b> <b>efficiency</b> is effectively 100% {{but is a}} function of the thickness particularly for near bandedge photons. Like all narrow bandgap materials InSb detectors require periodic recalibrations, increasing the complexity of the imaging system. This added complexity is worthwhile where extreme sensitivity is required, e.g. in long-range military thermal imaging systems. InSb detectors also require cooling, as they have to operate at cryogenic temperatures (typically 80 K). Large arrays (up to 2048x2048 pixels) are available. HgCdTe and PtSi are materials with similar use.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, Thompson {{has shown}} a very high-efficiency EP-OLED {{approaching}} 100% <b>internal</b> <b>quantum</b> <b>efficiency.</b> The high internal phosphorescence efficiency and charge balance in the structure {{are responsible for the}} high efficiency. He also developed a new white OLED architecture that uses a fluorescent emitting dopant to harness all high energy singlet excitons for blue emission, and phosphorescent dopants to harvest lower-energy triplet excitons for green and red emission. As of now, Thompson currently holds a patent for the invention of multicolor organic light emitting devices. This invention relates to devices used in flat panel electronic displays.Another focus of his is on organic photovoltaics. Thompson’s research highlights recent progress in explaining molecular characteristics which result in photovoltage losses in heterojunction organic photovoltaics. In addition to this research, Thompson grows thin films to control their structure. Then with these films, he can study the nature of energy and charge propagation. He has done work on thin films made of zinc tetraphenylporphyrin (ZnTPP) which are used to prepare Organic solar cells.|$|E
50|$|Indium gallium {{arsenide}} antimonide (InGaAsSb) is a compound III-V semiconductor. (InxGa1−xAsySb1−y) The addition of GaAs {{allows for a}} narrower bandgap (0.5 to 0.6 eV), and therefore better absorption of long wavelengths. Specifically, the bandgap was engineered to 0.55 eV. With this bandgap, the compound achieved a photon-weighted <b>internal</b> <b>quantum</b> <b>efficiency</b> of 79% with a fill factor of 65% for a black body at 1100 °C. This was for a device grown on a GaSb substrate by organometallic vapour phase epitaxy (OMVPE). Devices have been grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and liquid phase epitaxy (LPE). The internal quantum efficiencies (IQE) of these devices are approaching 90%, while devices grown by the other two techniques exceed 95%. The largest problem with InGaAsSb cells is phase separation. Compositional inconsistencies throughout the device degrade its performance. When phase separation can be avoided, the IQE and fill factor of InGaAsSb approach theoretical limits in wavelength ranges near the bandgap energy. However, the Voc/Eg ratio {{is far from the}} ideal. Current methods to manufacture InGaAsSb PVs are expensive and not commercially viable.|$|E
