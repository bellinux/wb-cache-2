5|$|This episode {{revolves}} around Liz Lemon (played by Tina Fey) and Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) {{trying to get}} Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) to make a successful appearance on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, a late night talk show. These attempts are complicated when Tracy <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> reaction to pills prescribed by Dr. Leo Spaceman and he temporarily goes crazy. Meanwhile, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) is preparing {{to give a speech}} at the Waldorf-Astoria.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{eccentric}} member of staff is Alan Statham (Mark Heap), an overbearing, stuttering and pedantic consultant radiologist, whose everyday actions regularly border on insanity. He is desperately and hopelessly {{in love with}} Joanna Clore (Pippa Haywood), the 48-year-old head of human resources with an increasingly sardonic attitude. Their relationship is an open secret, with student doctor Boyce (Oliver Chris), often {{using it as a}} weapon against them, bullying Alan constantly. Joanna's human resources staff also use it against her, in particular Kim Alabaster (Sally Bretton), who <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> attitude towards most of the people she meets, and Naughty Rachel (Katie Lyons), who earned her nickname due to her love of sex. The other HR staff include Harriet Schulenburg (Olivia Colman), an overworked mother of four trapped in an unhappy marriage, and Karen Ball (Lucinda Raikes), who divides her time between doing much of the office's work, trying to attract Martin's affections, and being bullied by Kim and Rachel.|$|E
5|$|The Vedic goddess Nirriti is {{associated}} with death, decay, bad luck, anger, and need. Hymns emphasize offerings to keep her away. Like Nirriti, Dhumavati {{is associated}} with unpromising things and hardship. Jyestha, also an early Hindu goddess, has similarities in iconography with Dhumavati. Like Dhumavati, she is dark, ugly and {{is associated with}} the crow. Jyestha is described as being unable to tolerate any auspiciousness. Also like Dhumavati, Jyestha dwells in quarrels, inauspicious places, and <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> temper. Lakshmana Desika, the commentator on the Saradatilaka-Tantra, identifies Dhumavati with Jyestha. Both Alakshmi, the sister and antithesis of Lakshmi (Shri), the goddess of wealth, luck and beauty, and Dhumavati are described as old, carrying a broom and having a crow banner. Both symbolize hunger, thirst, need, and poverty.|$|E

5|$|In Batesian mimicry {{the mimic}} shares signals {{similar to the}} model, but {{does not have the}} {{attribute}} that makes it unprofitable to predators (e.g., unpalatability). In other words, a Batesian mimic is a sheep in wolf's clothing. It is named after Henry Walter Bates, an English naturalist whose work on butterflies in the Amazon rainforest (described in The Naturalist on the River Amazons) was pioneering in this field of study. Mimics {{are less likely to be}} found out (for example by predators) when in low proportion to their model. This phenomenon is called negative frequency dependent selection, and it applies in most forms of mimicry. Batesian mimicry can only be maintained if the harm caused to the predator by eating a model outweighs the benefit of eating a mimic. The nature of learning is weighted in favor of the mimics, for a predator that <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> first experience with a model tends to avoid anything that looks like it for a long time, and does not re-sample soon to see whether the initial experience was a false negative. However, if mimics become more abundant than models, then the probability of a young predator having a first experience with a mimic increases. Such systems are therefore most likely to be stable where both the model and the mimic occur, and where the model is more abundant than the mimic. This is not the case in Müllerian mimicry, which is described next.|$|E
5|$|Sol is Asher's younger brother, and Asher has {{provided}} for him {{most of his}} life. Asher has been a father figure to Sol since a young age, and Sol depends on him. Looking after Sol takes a toll on Asher, however. Sol is loyal to his brother, but depends on him {{so much that he}} finds it difficult to function without him. Sol likes his family to be together, but they are fractured due to Asher being a troublemaker and their mother being mentally unstable and Sol wants to reunite them. Sol's dependence on Asher also means he finds it difficult to establish his own identity. Asher is willing to put himself out to secure Sol's success, such as being stabbed by his mother and giving away his father's Rolex watch so Sol can get a place in the dance group, and has done things so that Sol would not have to do them himself. Thompson opined that Asher is not necessarily the best role model for Sol, but is a good brother even though the mistakes he makes override the good things he has done for Sol. Cole said that Sol is not a troublemaker but he gets into trouble without meaning to as trouble comes to him. Although he does not bring attention to himself, he <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> temper and hides his feelings with violence. He gets into a few fights throughout the series, and makes situations worse by getting physical. Sol does not understand or think about what he is doing when he loses his temper. Cole also said that trust is an issue with Sol throughout the series.|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, Joey and Chandler console Ross {{while helping}} him {{assemble}} new furniture. Ross begins {{to wonder if}} any woman would be [...] "the right one" [...] for him. Monica goes on her first date with Paul, and while he seems decent and respectful, she discovers from a colleague that he <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> reputation as a womanizer, ending her hopes that she will find a mate. Ross realizes that Rachel could {{be the beginning of}} a new hope for him. He successfully brings up the idea to Rachel of asking her out sometime, and later confesses to Monica about the potential relationship.|$|E
500|$|Charlie (Dominic Monaghan) tells {{a priest}} {{that he is}} going to quit his band because it <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> {{influence}} on him. Soon after, his brother, Liam Pace (Neil Hopkins), tells Charlie that Drive Shaft has gotten a recording contract. Charlie doesn't want to sign the contract because he has qualms about the sex and drugs the band engages in. Liam talks him into signing, promising that Charlie can quit any time he's had enough. One evening at a show, Liam, to Charlie's frustration, starts singing the chorus to [...] "You All Everybody", which is supposed to be sung by Charlie. Liam assures Charlie it won't happen again.|$|E

500|$|After signing for Sheffield United, Evans {{moved to}} Millhouse Green, Penistone, {{in the nearby}} Barnsley area. After the death of former Wales boss and Sheffield United player, coach and manager Gary Speed, Evans {{revealed}} a message under his shirt after scoring his first goal in the FA Cup win over Torquay United, which read: [...] "Rest in peace Speedo." [...] Evans stated regarding the death of Gary Speed that [...] "I was {{a man on a}} mission. I had a message on my top for Gary Speed which I wanted to show. I'm thankful I got the goal... the crowd started singing – it gave me goose pimples... not one person <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> word to say about him, he was a gentleman... even people who haven't met him know how much of a nice man he was... it still hasn't hit home, it still feels surreal." ...|$|E
500|$|Itoi {{chose to}} use the {{pixelated}} style of Mother 2 for the Game Boy Advance Mother 3 because he was uninterested in computer graphics trends. The series' games were written in the hiragana alphabet instead of in kanji (Chinese characters) so as to remain accessible to young children. Itoi described the game world as governed by a [...] "might equals right ... macho" [...] power struggle. The antagonist, Porky, {{was designed as a}} [...] "symbol of humankind", complementing Itoi's view of evil on a fungible morality spectrum with [...] "pranks" [...] and [...] "crimes" [...] at its extremes. Itoi compared {{the way in which the}} characters realize their psychic powers with menstruation, and added that human physiology was [...] "one of his themes". Players sweat when learning an ability based on Itoi's belief of how physical struggle facilitates growth. He also included characters like the Magypsies and Duster (who <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> leg) to show the value of having friends with different qualities.|$|E

[...] Becky Bain for Idolator described the daytime video as [...] "the super-colorful cheery vid" [...] and the nighttime video as a [...] "macabre Halloween makeover." [...] In another review of the video, Bain wrote that the daytime version presented Rihanna as [...] "having the most fun she's had in ages." [...] Bain continued to praise the creative direction for the video, writing [...] "It's so refreshing to see RiRi smiling and ready to party after her gun-weilding , lake-drowning, loving-the-way-you-lie humorless somber phase." [...] Amy Lee for Metro compared the daytime video's colorful stylization to Katy Perry's video for [...] "California Gurls". Nicole James for MTV Buzzworthy compared the nighttime video's dark persona to that of Rihanna's own for [...] "Disturbia". Chris Ryan for the same publication noted that the daytime video was reminiscent of Rihanna's video for [...] "SOS". Ryan {{also noted that the}} video bore similarities to Perry's videos.|$|E

500|$|Biographers have characterised Pick {{as being}} [...] "very shy", and [...] "brilliant but lonely". Christian Barman {{described}} {{him as a person}} who inspired conflicting opinions about his personality and his actions: [...] "a man about whom so many people held so many different views". Pick acknowledged that he could be difficult to work with: [...] "I have always kept in mind my own frailties – a short temper. Impatience with fools, quickness rather than thoroughness. I am a bad hand at the gracious word or casual congratulation." [...] His moralistic character led to friends giving him the nickname [...] "Jonah". Pick valued criticism and savoured challenging debate, though he complained that he found it difficult to get people to stand up to him. UERL board member Sir Ernest Clark considered Pick to be perhaps too efficient and unable to fully delegate and relinquish responsibility: [...] "his own efficiency <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> effect on the efficiency of others... How can the housemaid take pride in a job to which the mistress will insist on putting the finishing touch?" [...] Pick's friend Noel Carrington thought that his attention to detail made him the [...] "ideal inspector general." ...|$|E
500|$|Itoi {{chose to}} use the {{pixelated}} style of Mother 2 for Mother 3 because he was uninterested in computer graphics trends. He {{felt that it was}} only coincidentally related to the resurgence of interest in retrogaming. The series' games were written in the hiragana alphabet instead of in kanji (Chinese characters) so as to remain accessible to young children. Itoi described the world as governed by [...] "might equals right" [...] and its power struggle as [...] "macho". The antagonist, Porky, was designed as a [...] "symbol of humankind". Itoi associated the game's view of evil to the [...] "fun and games" [...] on the spectrum of [...] "pranks" [...] to [...] "crimes", and likened its tone to the lyrics of the song [...] "Reunion" [...] by Kazuko Matsuo, where the subject falls in love with someone the world finds evil. Itoi compared how the characters come to realize their psychic powers with menstruation, and added that human physiology was [...] "one of his themes". As such, players sweat when learning an ability, based on Itoi's belief of how physical struggle facilitates growth. He also included characters like the Magypsies and Duster (who <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> leg) to show the value of having friends with different qualities. Some environments were added to serve specific purposes. For example, Osohe Castle was meant to show the scale of time and Tantane Island was designed to reflect the player's worst nightmares as similar to Mother 2 [...] "hallucinatory city", Moonside. Another of his themes was the duality of the seriousness and lightheartedness of games, which is why he added a serious death scene to the first chapter. Other parts of the game referenced media such as Kiki's Delivery Service.|$|E

2500|$|Edmund Pevensie is the second-youngest of the Pevensie children. He <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> {{relationship}} with his siblings. Edmund {{is known to be}} a liar, and often harasses children younger than him. He often singles out Lucy as his favourite target. In Narnia he meets the White Witch, who plies him with enchanted Turkish delight, drink, and smooth talk. Lured by the White Witch's promise of power and an unlimited supply of the magical treats, Edmund betrays his siblings. He eventually regrets his actions and repents. After he helps Aslan and the good denizens of Narnia defeat the White Witch, he is crowned and named King Edmund the Just. He has no endowments, because of his betrayal.|$|E

The current tonsillectomy [...] "rate" [...] is 0.53 per thousand children and 1.46 per thousand children for combined tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. In the past decade, tonsillectomies have become increasingly low due to orders from the government; specifically by President Obama in 2009 where he commented on {{ear nose and throat}} doctors at a conference [...] "You come in and you’ve got a bad sore throat, or your child <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> sore throat or has repeated sore throats. The doctor may say, 'You know what?
