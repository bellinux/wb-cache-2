5|$|From the 1950s to 2003, the Strategic Commanders {{were the}} Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) and the Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic (SACLANT). The current {{arrangement}} is to separate responsibility between Allied Command Transformation (ACT), responsible for transformation {{and training of}} NATO forces, and Allied Command Operations (ACO), responsible for NATO operations worldwide. Starting in late 2003 NATO has restructured how it commands and deploys its troops by creating several NATO Rapid <b>Deployable</b> Corps, including Eurocorps, I. German/Dutch Corps, Multinational Corps Northeast, and NATO Rapid <b>Deployable</b> Italian Corps among others, as well as naval High Readiness Forces (HRFs), which all report to Allied Command Operations.|$|E
5|$|The 7th Infantry Division is an {{infantry}} {{division of the}} United States Army. Today, it exists as a unique 250-man <b>deployable</b> headquarters at Joint Base Lewis-McChord overseeing several units, though none of the 7th Infantry Division's own historic forces are active.|$|E
5|$|AFSOC {{provides}} Air Force {{special operations}} forces for worldwide deployment and assignment to regional unified commands. The command's SOF are composed of highly trained, rapidly <b>deployable</b> airmen, conducting global special operations missions ranging from precision application of firepower via airstrikes or close air support, to infiltration, exfiltration, resupply and refueling of SOF operational elements.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, LT Isabel Papp, USPHS, {{became the}} first female medical officer to be {{assigned}} to a Port Security Unit (PSU). PSU's are <b>deployable</b> units organized for sustained force protection operations. She {{was also the first}} Hispanic-American female MD to be assigned to a PSU. She had also been the first Hispanic-American female Physician's Assistant in the Coast Guard Reserve.|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{the game}} {{features}} {{a variety of}} weapons which can be utilised to destroy other opponents or for self-defence. Offensive weapons include rockets, plasma bolts, missiles, and grenades, whilst defensive weapons range from <b>deployable</b> mines to energy shields. Every ship is also equipped with a standard energy shield which will protect the player from damage caused by collisions or weapons fire. If a shield runs out, the ship will explode and the player in question will be eliminated from the race.|$|E
5|$|On 2 July, the Danish ship Ark Futura {{arrived in}} the Italian port of Gioia Tauro, {{carrying}} the chemical weapons, which were then loaded onto the U.S. ship Cape Ray. The Cape Ray was equipped with two Field <b>Deployable</b> Hydrolysis Systems capable of neutralizing the poisonous substances and converting them into industrial waste. On 19 July 2014, around 250 protesters gathered at the Souda base to protest {{the elimination of the}} chemical weapons in the nearby region of the Mediterranean Sea.|$|E
5|$|Some recent notable {{projects}} {{have included the}} <b>Deployable</b> Joint Command and Control System and ULTRA AP, a concept combat vehicle. In 2010, researchers developed microfabricated planar ion traps using VLSI techniques {{for use in a}} trapped ion quantum computer. Also in 2010, researchers developed a method of using GPGPU to crack passwords, coming up with a minimum secure password length of 12 characters. Researchers are investigating the use of radar as a possible concussion detection tool.|$|E
5|$|The {{deployment}} to East Timor {{highlighted the}} limits of the Australian Defence Force and the need for an Army Reserve that could effectively provide <b>deployable</b> capabilities and individuals to round-out to the Regular Army in times of heavy operational commitment. As such, in late 2000 the government did what many governments had toyed with since the formation of the citizen force almost a hundred years earlier: enacting legislation that enabled the call-up of Reservists to full-time service in circumstances that fell short of a full scale defence emergency, thereby allowing their deployment overseas, while also protecting their employment and providing remuneration to employers.|$|E
5|$|Turkey has {{the second}} largest {{standing}} military force in NATO, after the US Armed Forces, with an estimated strength of 495,000 <b>deployable</b> forces, according to a 2011 NATO estimate. Turkey {{is one of five}} NATO member states which are part of the nuclear sharing policy of the alliance, together with Belgium, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands. A total of 90 B61 nuclear bombs are hosted at the Incirlik Air Base, 40 of which are allocated for use by the Turkish Air Force in case of a nuclear conflict, but their use requires the approval of NATO.|$|E
5|$|Two Space Shuttle {{missions}} – {{the ill-fated}} STS-51-L (ended by the Challenger disaster) and STS-61-E – {{were scheduled to}} observe Halley's Comet from low Earth orbit. STS-51-L carried the Shuttle-Pointed Tool for Astronomy (SPARTAN-203) satellite, also called the Halley's Comet Experiment <b>Deployable</b> (HCED). STS-61-E was a Columbia mission scheduled for March 1986, carrying the ASTRO-1 platform to study the comet. Due to the suspension of America's manned space program after the Challenger explosion, the mission was canceled, and ASTRO-1 would not fly until late 1990 on STS-35.|$|E
5|$|A delayed or <b>deployable</b> surface {{marker buoy}} (DSMB) is a soft {{inflatable}} tube which {{is attached to}} a reel or spool line at one end, and is inflated by the diver under water and released to float to the surface, deploying the line as it ascends. This provides information to the surface that the diver is about to ascend, and where he is. This equipment is commonly used by recreational and technical divers, and requires a certain level of skill to operate safely. Once deployed, it can be used for the same purposes as the standard surface marker and reel, and in the same way, but they are mostly used to signal the boat that the diver has started ascent or to indicate a problem in technical diving.|$|E

5|$|Since {{receiving}} its startup funding, Florida Atlantic has secured {{additional funds}} from other sources, including federal and private research grants. As a result, both centers {{have engaged in}} academic and industry partnerships, combining expertise in ocean engineering, marine biotechnology, functional genomics, proteomics, and bioinformatics. Researchers, scientists, and students at the centers are designing technologies to explore the sea, harvest renewable energy, discover new medicines, and develop new therapeutics to combat agents of bioterrorism. As {{a result of this}} research, in 2007 the university and Lockheed Martin announced an exclusive licensing agreement to develop and produce a rapidly <b>deployable</b> and autonomous mooring buoy system for military and scientific uses.|$|E
5|$|The IFC's {{return on}} average assets (GAAP basis) {{decreased}} from 3.1% in 2010 to 2.4% in 2011. Its return on average capital (GAAP basis) decreased from 10.1% in 2010 to 8.2% in 2011. The IFC's cash and liquid investments accounted for 83% of its estimated net cash requirements for fiscal years 2012 through 2014. Its external funding liquidity level grew from 190% in 2010 to 266% in 2011. It has a 2.6:1 debt-to-equity ratio and holds 6.6% in reserves against losses on loans to its disbursement portfolio. The IFC's <b>deployable</b> strategic capital decreased from 14% in 2010 to 10% in 2011 {{as a share}} of its total resources available, which grew from $16.8 billion in 2010 to $17.9 billion in 2011.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{will destroy}} the highest-priority chemicals, which were {{scheduled}} for removal from Syria by 31 December, {{on board the}} MV Cape Ray in international waters of the Mediterranean, using an U.S. Army Field <b>Deployable</b> Hydrolysis System. The United Kingdom gave the United States £2.5 million of specialist equipment and training to enable the highest-priority chemicals to be processed more quickly. In addition around 150 tonnes of priority two chemicals, toxic material similar to industrial chemical agents, will be transported to the UK {{with the help of}} the British Royal Navy and destroyed there. The remaining stock of priority two chemicals not going to Britain will be destroyed by commercial companies.|$|E
5|$|Each of the {{branches}} of the ADF has a reserve component. These forces are the Royal Australian Naval Reserve, Australian Army Reserve and Royal Australian Air Force Reserve. The main role of the reserves is to supplement the permanent elements of the ADF during deployments and crises, including natural disasters. This can include attaching individual reservists to regular units or deploying units composed entirely of reserve personnel. As reservists serve on a part-time basis, they are less costly to the government than permanent members of the ADF, but the nature of their service can mean that reservists have a lower level of readiness than regular personnel and require further training before they can be deployed. It has historically proven difficult to set a level of training requirements which allows reservists to be rapidly <b>deployable</b> yet does not act as a disincentive to recruitment and continued participation.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} heavy {{emphasis on}} environmental destruction using a procedural destruction system. Players can break structures by planting explosives on them, or shoot walls to make bullet holes. Players may gain tactical advantages through environmental destruction, and the system aims at encouraging players to utilize creativity and strategy. A bullet-penetration system is featured, in which bullets that pass through structures deal less damage to enemies. In addition to destruction, players can also set up heavy-duty fortifications on walls and <b>deployable</b> shields around them for protection; these can be destroyed through breaching or by utilizing operator specific melee-weapons like sledgehammers. In order to stop attackers' advance, defenders can place traps like barbed-wire and explosive laserwire traps around the maps. Vertical space is a key gameplay element in the game's maps: players can destroy ceilings and floors using breach charges and can ambush enemies by rappelling through windows. Powerful weapons like grenades and breach charges are valuable, as only limited numbers {{can be used in}} a round.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Deployable</b> Operations Group (DOG) was a Coast Guard command {{established}} in July 2007. The DOG established a single command authority to rapidly provide the Coast Guard, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Defense, Department of Justice and other interagency operational commanders adaptive force packages {{drawn from the}} Coast Guard's <b>deployable</b> specialized force units. The DOG was disestablished on 22 April 2013 and its <b>deployable</b> specialized forces (DSF) units were placed {{under the control of}} the Atlantic and Pacific Area Commanders.|$|E

25|$|Headquarters <b>Deployable</b> Joint Task Force-Land (HQ DJTF-L) {{was formed}} by redesignating the {{headquarters}} of the 3rd Land Force Group in late 2011. It was expected that the headquarters would move to Linton Military Camp in the Manawatu after December 2012. As of 1 January 2013, it was announced that the headquarters was to be redesignated HQ <b>Deployable</b> Joint Interagency Task Force (DJIATF) and be moved under the command of Headquarters Joint Forces New Zealand. In late 2014 Colonel John Howard handed over command to Colonel Glenn King.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, Northrop Grumman {{began working}} with DHS Systems LLC, {{manufacturer}} of the <b>Deployable</b> Rapid Assembly Shelter (DRASH) in New York, {{as part of the}} U.S. Army's Standard Integrated Command Post System program.|$|E
25|$|CH-124C : One CH-124 {{operated}} by the Helicopter Operational Test and Evaluation Facility located at CFB Shearwater. Used for testing new gear, and when not testing new gear, it is <b>deployable</b> to any Canadian Forces ship requiring a helicopter.|$|E
25|$|<b>Deployable</b> Tactical Operations System (DTOS)— {{provides}} mobile {{command and}} control platforms {{in support of the}} quick ramp-up of initial emergency response missions for the Corps. DTOS is a system designed to respond to District, Division, National, and International events.|$|E
25|$|The Air Force Mobile Deployment Wing (AFMDW) {{provides}} combat ready, {{integrated and}} <b>deployable</b> air support capabilities to the South African National Defence Force. The AFMDW consists of 18 Deployment Support Unit, Mobile Communications Unit, 140 Squadron and 142 Squadron, 500 Squadron and 501 Squadron.|$|E
25|$|The Royal Navy is a technologically {{sophisticated}} naval force, {{and as of}} April 2015 {{consists of}} 77 commissioned ships. Command of <b>deployable</b> assets is exercised by the Fleet Commander of the Naval Service. Personnel matters are {{the responsibility of the}} Second Sea Lord/Commander-in-Chief Naval Home Command, an appointment usually held by a vice-admiral.|$|E
25|$|After the {{analysis}} phase, business and technical recovery requirements precede the solutions phase. Asset inventories allow for quick identification of <b>deployable</b> resources. For an office-based, IT-intensive business, the plan requirements may cover desks, human resources, applications, data, manual workarounds, computers and peripherals. Other business environments, such as production, distribution, warehousing etc. {{will need to}} cover these elements, but likely have additional issues.|$|E
25|$|The {{operational}} {{component of}} the system of forces include the Army's elements dedicated to the fulfillment of the missions of operational nature. These elements include the operational command bodies, the formations commands and the <b>deployable</b> operational units. These elements are prepared, trained, supported and administratively maintained by the regiments and other bodies of the fix {{component of the}} system of forces.|$|E
25|$|The Royal Signals is a {{corps of}} 10 Regiments and 13 {{independent}} squadrons which provides communications and information systems support to formations of Brigade level and above. Below the Brigade level support {{is provided by}} Battalion Signallers drawn from the parent unit. Within the <b>deployable</b> brigades, the Signal Regiment also provides support to the HQ function including logistics, life support and force protection capabilities.|$|E
25|$|On 7 February 1963, {{the colors}} of the 11th Airborne Division were {{reactivated}} at Fort Benning, GA, as the 11th Air Assault Division (Test). The 11th was a small unit, never intended for <b>deployable</b> status, and used to test the airmobile concept then under development. Units of the 2d Infantry Division, also located at Fort Benning, were “borrowed” for large-scale airmobile tests and maneuvers.|$|E
25|$|The {{radar system}} may {{eventually}} {{be completed by}} 2 mobile TAFLIR (TAktische FLIeger Radars – Tactical Flight Radars). These Ground Master 200 type AN/MPQ-64 radars are {{a variant of the}} Northrop Grumman AN/TPS-75 and are <b>deployable</b> in areas of difficult terrain or where specific coverage is needed. Peacetime TAFLIR deployment locations are at Dübendorf and Emmen. In time of crisis or at war they can be deployed anywhere.|$|E
25|$|There {{were over}} 25 {{specialized}} units within the <b>Deployable</b> Operations Group including the Maritime Security Response Team, Maritime Safety and Security Teams, Law Enforcement Detachments, Port Security Units, the National Strike Force, and Regional Dive Lockers. The DOG also managed Coast Guard personnel {{assigned to the}} Navy Expeditionary Combat Command and {{was involved in the}} selection of Coast Guard candidates to attend Navy BUD/S and serve with Navy SEAL Teams.|$|E
25|$|Use of {{decompression}} buoys: Sub-surface <b>deployable</b> buoys {{allow the}} diver to {{signal that the}} ascent has begun, and indicate {{the position of the}} diver to people on the surface, often the crew of the boat which must pick the divers up after the dive. Deployment skills include controlled inflation, paying out line in a way they avoids snags and jams, maintaining appropriate depth control during the deployment and control of line tension during ascent.|$|E
