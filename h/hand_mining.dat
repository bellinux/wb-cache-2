Using a bargaining game model, I argue {{that the type of}} commodities each country produced {{by the end of the}} nineteenth Century determined the negotiation power of local governments.

The model shows that countries with regions with more autonomy to produce and trade their commodities increase the local power to collect more taxes. While in Brazil coffee was the most important commodity, Mexico relied on mining products. Coffee was produced by local landowners who became economically powerful and they were able that export taxes were collected locally with the proclamation of the 1891 Constitution.

Strip mining profoundly changes the phy-sical and chemical character of the overburden rocks by breaking up the strata and intimately intermixing the various rock types in spoil banks. Thus chemical reactions take place between different rock types and between the rocks and the atmosphere.

On the one hand, {{extractive}} industries can be a positive economic driver, generating considerable revenues, and opportunities for growth. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>mining</b> is often thought {{to be associated with}} negative effects, such as pollution, and violent conflict. Existing research has shown that mine openings trigger a structural change in employment patterns in Africa, whereby women shift from agricultural work to the service sector, or leave the labor force. However, few if any systematic studies have addressed whether this structural shift may impact the level of violence within the household. Drawing on various versions of resource theory, we argue that mining – through such structural change – may increase women's risk of being abused by their partners. Recent advances in the literature on domestic violence (DV) suggest that prevailing gender norms moderate effects of resources. We test this empirically by matching georeferenced data on openings and closings of 147 industrial mines to individual data on abuse for up to 142, 749 women from the Demographic and Health Surveys in 15 sub-Saharan African countries. We find no overall statistically significant effect of mine openings on the risk of partner abuse, although there are heterogeneous effects across countries. Furthermore, mining is associated with increased DV in areas with higher general acceptance of such abuse...|$|E
40|$|In Latin America, {{where in}} some {{countries}} the presence of indigenous communities is still relatively high, the national governments have been confronted with moral obligations to consider the recognition and adherence to {{the human rights of}} the indigenous communities within their domestic legislation. Nevertheless, from a legal point of view, human rights declarations do not contain any legally binding regulations, meaning that states cannot be sanctioned, which limits its value. Therefore, the main question that arises when looking at the concept of indigenous rights is about their purpose and effectiveness. The adherence and respect towards the guidelines of declarations continues to depend on influential actors such as the state, and its attitude towards the legal position of indigenous communities is especially visible when conflicts arise that require the governments to protect certain rights of indigenous peoples. In Chile, most conflicts with the numerous indigenous communities are caused by the mining industry.

Thus, this study shows both the strengths and potential, {{as well as the}} weaknesses of using EHMD. On the one <b>hand,</b> <b>mining</b> such data has the advantage of being able to cover very large samples, or potentially even entire populations, rather than the typically small samples that are used in well-designed studies (Edwards et al.

On the one hand, as shown in the preceding section, by mining EHMD it is possible to answer questions regarding flows between tourism precincts (Kelly [28], Hayllar et al. [22]) and there is also the potential to provide answers to other important questions of tourism studies, such as those relating to typical itineraries of tourists between precincts, or potential interactions between tourists and locals (Hayllar et al. [22]). On the other hand, since EHMD has no ground truth or demographic information attached, assumptions have to be made that are plausible but might still be wrong, such as the assumption that most travelers are indeed tourists.|$|E

During my fieldwork, the city was often described to me as a paradise, with easy living and the ready availability of money often from overseas: tourists on one <b>hand,</b> <b>mining</b> on the other, with other opportunities such as sporadic work on Hollywood movies. Swakopmund is seen as 'safe urbanity' - away from rural life with the opportunities of a city but less challenging than larger metropoles such Windhoek. These (often off-the-cuff) remarks bely a different reality. The disparity between men's representations of themselves - expressed through a culture of 'machismo' - and the stories of their everyday lives indicates a longing for 'something else'. Men project an image of 'traditional dominance' in their relationships with women, who increasingly desire more companionate relationships in line with changing gender norms. Men must often submit to the desires of their wives and girlfriends for fear of losing them to a 'better man', one who is able to provide more. This paper focuses on the lives and roles of men (and, by extension, women) in Swakopmund.

40|$|In the {{capitalistic}} {{drive for}} economic and social 'restaicturing' {{and an increase in}} economic efficiency', some of the industries supporting small-scale enterprises have been marginalised and labelled as 'anachronistic'. Whilst studying the culture of the Queensland small-scale sapphire miner, we took the opportunity to observe and analyse a case of how this phenomenon and its consequences can develop in a specific community. Generally, we found that, when state policy supports and encourages larger enterprises to displace established small-scale enterprises in a particular industry, this can have dire consequences for small communities. In this paper, we discuss the case of the Anakie Gemfields. a small community in Central Queensland. We focus on the years 1970 - 95, the period in which the small-scale sapphire mining industry was displaced by large-scale machinery mining. This Gemfields community emerged in support of the sapphire mining operation that, up to the early 1970 s, was conducted mainly by small-scale miners. These miners worked individually or in small partnerships to extract sapphires from alluvial deposits with hand tools, and later {{with the aid of a}} few mechanised devices that complemented <b>hand</b> <b>mining.</b> In the Marxian tradition, we refer to this type of mining as 'petty bourgeois mining'. The paper outlines how this type of mining has been progressively replaced by large-scale fully capitalist methods, so that few smallscale sapphire miners remained on the Anakie Gemfields by 1995. It also discusses how the shift in the economic composition of this community was accompanied by a sharp decline in its general well-being. By the early 1990 s, the Anakie Gemfields had become a welfare pocket, experiencing unusually high unemployment figures, low incomes and low workforce participation rates...|$|E
