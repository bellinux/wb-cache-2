40|$|In {{the last}} two decades, tuned mass damper {{has been used as}} a passive control method against {{earthquakes}} on tall buildings and bridges. In this paper, the effect of tuned mass damper sys-tem on the seismic behavior of 10 story structure with moment frame has been investigated taking into account the floor rigid-ity. In addition, the effect of TMD system is investigated on Shazand Railway Bridge located in Markazi province, Iran in north to south-west railway. The bridge consists of ten spans. In 1984, during Iran-Iraq war, that’s main span, which has a length of 72 m, was attacked and severely damaged. <b>Eight</b> <b>month</b> <b>later,</b> damaged span replaced with a steel deck. The deck is straight in plan, but the railway is curved and this causes eccentricity. Excessive vibration was observed during the train passage. Although the bridge was retrofitted in two stages, the problem has not been solved yet, and the trains’ speed should be reduced to around 10 km/hr in order to avoid excessive vibration. The present study addressed the effective-ness of tuned mass damper (TMD) in reducing train-induced vibrations of Shazand Railway Bridge. A three dimensional finite-element model of the bridge is developed and dynamic time history analyses under train passage in both as-built and passively controlled with TMD are conducted. Sensitivity anal-yses are performed to demonstrate the effects of the damper parameters on structural response. The results show that con-siderable reduction in acceleration response of the bridge can be achieved by employing proper TMD...|$|R
