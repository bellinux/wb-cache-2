Paul took extensive campaigns and significantly expanded his dominion eastward, over Bosnia and Hum, and also warred successfully against the Republic of Venice, taking the Dalmatian capital Zadar. He was the most powerful Croatian noble {{at the end of}} the 13th century and beginning of the 14th century. He reigned <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>Árpád</b> and Anjou struggle which secured him power over the whole central part of Croatia. He issued his own money and secured de facto independence.|$|R

It was first mentioned as Castrum Dragul in a charter of 1285 as the possession of Demeter of the Hunt-Poznan family. The proprietors had to surrender to Máté Csák III in 1311. After the death of this oligarch in 1321 the castle was overcome by the army of Charles I of Hungary. At that time Drégely Castle served as the county dungeon and held the archives of Hont County.|$|R
50|$|Hóman {{produced}} several serious scholarly works. The {{centre of}} his research was the history of <b>the</b> Hungarian nation <b>during</b> <b>the</b> Middle Ages. Initially he dealt with economic history, social history and the auxiliary sciences of history. He wrote about Hungarian towns <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>Árpád</b> era, social classes, the first state tax and about the Magyar tribes who arrived to the Carpathian Basin. He authored a massive work entitled History of the Hungarian Currency 1000-1325, in which he systematized <b>the</b> Hungarian currency <b>during</b> <b>the</b> Middle Ages' chronology, metrology and history. His other key solo publication was The Finance, Affairs and Economic Policy of the Kingdom of Hungary During the Reign of Charles Robert.|$|R
5000|$|There is a groundwork {{fortress}} {{on the top}} of <b>the</b> <b>Árpád</b> {{hill from}} <b>the</b> Hungarian conquest time. The Danube turn gives a good fortification locality and the region was royal domain <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>Árpád</b> house kings of Hungary. The region was named Pilis forest. The royal palace and the neighbouring monastery played and important role in the life in the 11th century. Specifically, the life of Béla I of Hungary ended here in 1063. The earliest charter was given out by Ladislaus I of Hungary in 1079. In the 12th century Coloman of Hungary decided about the contunuation of the throne for Stephen II of Hungary against the later king Béla II of Hungary. In the Mongolian invasion (1241) the monastery was destroyed, but rebuilt soon. The provost of the monastery also served the king and the royal family. Provost Fülöp was the chancellor of <b>the</b> queen <b>during</b> <b>the</b> times of Béla II of Hungary.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the second}} half of <b>the</b> 13th century, <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>Árpád</b> and Anjou dynasty struggle, Šubić family became hugely {{powerful}} under Paul I Šubić of Bribir who was the longest Croatian Ban (1274-1312), conquered Bosnia and declared himself [...] "Lord of all of Bosnia" [...] (1299-1312), appointed his brother Mladen I Šubić as Ban of Bosnia (1299-1304), and helped Charles I from House of Anjou to be the King of Hungary. After his death in 1312, his son Mladen II Šubić was the Ban of Bosnia (1304-1322) and Ban of Croatia (1312-1322). The kings from House of Anjou intended to strengthen the kingdom by uniting the power and control in their hands, but to do so had to diminish the power of the higher nobility. Already Charles I tried to crash the aristocratic particularism, intention finished by his son Louis the Great (1342-1382), relying on lower nobility and towns. Both ruled without the parliament, and inner nobility struggles only helped them in their intentions. This led to Mladen's defeat at the battle of Bliska in 1322 by a coalition of several Croatian noblemen and Dalmatian coastal towns with support of King himself, exchange of Šubić's castle of Ostrovica for Zrin Castle in Central Croatia (thus this branch was named Zrinski) in 1347. Eventually, Babonić and Nelipić families also succumbed to king's offensive against nobility, but with the centralization of power, Louis managed to force Venice by the Treaty of Zadar in 1358 to give up their possessions in Dalmatia. When king Louis died, without successor the question of succession remained open. The kingdom once again entered the time of internal unrest. Besides King Louis's daughter Mary, Charles III of Naples as the closest king male relative pretended to the throne. In February 1386, two months after his coronation, was assassinated by order of queen Elizabeth of Bosnia. His supporters, bans John of Palisna, John Horvat and Stjepan Lacković planned a rebellion against them, and managed to capture and imprison Elizabeth and Mary. By orders of John of Palisna, Elizabeth was strangled. As the answer for that, Magyars crowned Mary's husband Sigismund of Luxembourg.|$|R
