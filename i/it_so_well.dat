He had not previously played any first-class cricket but, after developing his googly in 1908, he used <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>well</b> in club cricket that Kent offered him a trial. He had played only six first-class matches when he was selected for the fifth Test of the summer's Ashes series, taking five wickets in the first Australian innings and seven overall in the match.|$|E

25|$|Cruyff is {{sometimes}} {{described as a}} typical kind of ‘artist-footballer’ or ‘footballer-thinker’ who considers football, the so-called 'beautiful game', not a purely athletic/physical competition but an artistic-oriented mind-body game. Because of his distinctive footballing views, Cruyff was called ‘the Spinoza of football’ by some. He believed in a certain style of play, which {{has the power to}} put a smile on the people's faces as he described it. When Cruyff, both as a player and as a manager, spoke about football he often mentioned the entertainment value of the game, that there is more to it than winning. In a 2009 interview with Sportmails Martin Samuel, Arsène Wenger, as a devout follower of Cruyff's footballing ideology, once shared his opinion about football's artistic value, “I believe the target of anything in life should be to do <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>well</b> that it becomes an art. When you read some books they are fantastic, the writer touches something in you that you know you would not have brought out of yourself. He makes you discover something interesting in your life. If you are living like an animal, {{what is the point of}} living? What makes daily life interesting is that we try to transform it to something that is close to art. And football is like that. When I watch Barcelona, it is art.” , the author of Cruyff's French biography, called him ‘the greatest actor in the history of football’ because Cruyff was a glorious exception (possibly the only one ever) being the man who ‘played’ outstandingly well multiple roles in the world of football: player, manager, and thinker.|$|E

She explained, [...] "To see him turn like that, {{for me it was}} even more shocking because I know him as a big teddy bear. He played <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>well</b> and I think that cliffhanger of 'I’m gonna kill Jim Halpert' {{is one of the best}} last lines of our episodes ever."

In {{a review of}} Supernatural for Entertainment Weekly, Considine later commended the [...] "throaty emotionalism" [...] with which Des'ree sang [...] "Kissing You". Jim Farber from the Daily News noted the song as the standout track from Supernatural and claimed that it [...] "stands as the only track to deepen the mood, bringing out the indigo pleasures of her voice." [...] The Richmond Times-Dispatch Kate Lipper called the record [...] "an excellent slow song that you can play nonstop". However, Ann Powers from The New York Times wrote that Des'ree is too melodramatic on [...] "Kissing You". In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph, Charlotte Church described the song {{as one of her}} favourites: [...] "This {{is one of the most}} beautiful songs I've ever heard. It's an original sound and they sing <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>well.</b> There's no beat, it's just a lovely, lulling song." ...|$|E

Fellow Los Angeles Times contributor Ed Morales disagreed with his review: [...] "Lechner needs to go into his music room, turn down the lights, snuggle up with his significant other and really listen to 'Romances.' I give his review * and 'Romances' ****" [...] Anne Valdespino of the Los Angeles Daily News praised the selection of songs and Miguel's performance, calling the performer a [...] "class act". The San Diego Union-Tribune music critic Ernesto Portillo Jr. rated Romances three-out-of four stars and claimed that Miguel's [...] "interpretations are first-rate and the music, with production help from famed composer Armando Manzanero, is executed with exquisite precision". However, he questioned {{the need for a}} third in the Romance series as he felt it [...] "diminishes the specialness" [...] of Romance and Segundo Romance noted that not all tracks in the album are [...] "true boleros". El Nuevo Herald editor Eliseo Cardona wrote a mostly positive review of the album. He complimented Miguel's vocals and the productions but stated that Migule's interpretation of [...] "La Gloria Eres Tu" [...] "pales" [...] compared to Lucho Gatica and José José's cover of the song. Ramiro Burr of the San Antonio Express-News said Romances [...] "sparkles with the joy of visiting good friends" [...] and lauded its [...] "timeless music, beautiful orchestration" [...] and complimented Silvetti's arrangements.

It was reported that Lathers had quit baseball permanently to become an automobile salesman.

2500|$|Steve Persall of the St. Petersburg Times {{rated the}} film B and added, [...] "Infamous {{might have been}} viewed as one of this year's better films if Capote hadn't told the same story about the same {{characters}} {{a year ago and}} done <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>well</b> [...] [...] [...] Infamous is inferior, although not drastically so, in almost every respect [...] [...] [...] The most obvious comparisons are to be made about performances. Jones is a much more accurate physical representation of Capote than Hoffman, his high-pitched voice sounding a little more affected than his Oscar-winning predecessor. However, the relative shallowness of McGrath's screenplay doesn't offer as many emotional land mines for Jones to play. [...] delivers an uncanny impersonation, while Hoffman's portrayal was a studiously researched impression, a likely more challenging task. Call this race nearly a draw, with Hoffman simply crossing the finish line first." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} of Peter Salter {{was written in}} a way that for most of the episode, the viewing audience would guess which side Salter was really on. Anthony Head, who was well known for his role as Rupert Giles in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, was cast as Peter Salter; during the audition, producer Simon Crawford Collins noted that Head performed <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>well,</b> that he would be perfect for the role, and was hired. Hugh Laurie was cast as Jools Siviter; the character was created because of bringing in a lighter element to a generally serious series. The character was also created this way as, according to David Wolstencroft, some people in intelligence and military are generally [...] "funny people", although they have been through [...] "some pretty heinous things". It also became the first episode to feature MI6; the service was depicted as more [...] "" [...] compared with MI5, which the series sources confirmed.|$|E

There was not a breath of wind & a very powerful sun. I managed to get up & was wonderfully little out of breath. Brown helped me up the steepest parts, which are rather trying. The falls were not particularly full, but always very fine. I walked up to the very top, just above, them, & rested a little on the heather.
