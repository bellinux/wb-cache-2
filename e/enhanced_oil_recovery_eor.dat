Solar thermal enhanced oil recovery is a form of <b>enhanced</b> <b>oil</b> <b>recovery</b> (<b>EOR),</b> which is key to harvesting California’s heavy crude. Currently, California uses EOR to help produce about 60% of its crude output. By using solar power instead of natural gas to create steam for EOR, solar steam generation reduces the amount of emissions produced during oil extraction, thus lowering the overall carbon intensity of crude. California currently has two solar EOR projects in operation, one in McKittrick, operated by LINN Energy (formerly Berry Petroleum) using enclosed trough technology from GlassPoint Solar, and another in Coalinga operated by Chevron Corporation using BrightSource Energy power tower technology. CARB is currently considering an amendment to allow upstream operators to receive credits for deploying innovative crude production technologies.|$|E

30|$|Without {{a shadow}} of a doubt, global energy demand is {{increasing}} annually and <b>enhancing</b> <b>oil</b> <b>recovery</b> (<b>EOR)</b> from mature reservoirs is of crucial importance. Waterflooding is a popular technique to increase recovery in a candidate oil reservoir; afterward, chemical EOR is a reasonable option to increase recovery further. Polymer flooding is a favorable chemical EOR method due to its impact on sweep efficiency (Standnes and Skjevrak 2014). Vertical heterogeneity may cause incomplete sweep through waterflooding, and polymer fluid is used to drive water within bypassed regions (Needham and Doe 1987). Generally, polymers are responsible for water increasing viscosity and reduction in its relative permeability (Sheng et al. 2015). Therefore, injection of a high-viscosity polymeric fluid leads to mobility ratio improvement, viscous fingering reduction and consequently increasing areal sweep efficiency (Pye 1964; Sandiford 1964).|$|R
40|$|Tertiary (<b>enhanced)</b> <b>oil</b> <b>recovery</b> is that {{additional}} recovery over and {{greater than the}} amount recovered by primary and secondary recovery methods [1]. In other words, <b>enhance</b> <b>oil</b> <b>recovery</b> (<b>EOR)</b> are the actions taken {{in order to increase}} the cumulative oil production after depletion of natural driving forces and water flooding techniques are no more efficient to be carried out. The Air Injection Processes (AIP), one of the gas flooding techniques and is well established in {{the oil and gas industry}} due to its consistency in producing unrecoverable oil. For instance, Water-Alternate-Gas (WAG) technique usually carried out proves to give better recovery. Water slug used in this method stabilizes the gas front and increase sweeping efficiency. Problems that usually occur during displacement are viscous fingering phenomenon and gravity segregation especially when it sweeps vertically. To give better control of viscous fingering, surfactant is added to the water to reduce its interfacial tension. This will gives rise to another variation to WAG which is Surfactant-Alternate-Gas flooding [2][3]...|$|R

This study concerns two key parameters influencing polymer flooding efficiency. As it is expected, some of key parameters such as: salinity and reservoir temperature and pressure, play important roles in improving <b>oil</b> <b>recovery</b> through polymer flooding. Regarding the fact that Hydrolyzed Poly Acryl Amid (HPAM) decomposes in high temperature and pressure conditions, only reservoirs with medium temperature and pressure are suitable for polymer flooding technique. On the other hand, viscosity of polymer solution decreases in high reservoir salinity, therefore HPAM is not effective for reservoirs with high salinity and temperature. We strongly believe that Poly vinyl Alcohol (PVA), as a viscous surfactant and IFT reducer, would be stable in extreme conditions of high salinity and high temperature (above 480 º F) and therefore, {{it can be used}} for reservoirs with high salinity and temperature...|$|R

30|$|Low-salinity water (LSW) {{flooding}} {{has been}} suggested as an effective method for <b>enhancing</b> <b>oil</b> <b>recovery</b> (<b>EOR)</b> in sandstone reservoirs when the salinity of the injection fluids is between 1400 and 5000  ppm (Alotaibi et al. 2010; Austad et al. 2010; Buikema et al. 2011; Hilner et al. 2015; Lager et al. 2008 b; Morrow and Buckley 2011; Piñerez Torrijos et al. 2016; Qiao et al. 2016; Vledder et al. 2010) and {{although most of the}} experiments were done below 100  °C, there appeared to be no limitation on temperature (Lager et al. 2008 a). Low-salinity water flooding may be considerably effective in special conditions and is recommended for increasing <b>oil</b> <b>recovery</b> when the following are encountered: clay must be present in the sandstones, polar components (acidic and/or basic material) present in crude oil, and formation water must contain divalent ions like Ca 2 + (Lager et al. 2007; Tang and Morrow 1999).|$|R
40|$|R o u n d t a b l e Carbon dioxide (CO 2) can be {{an agent}} for <b>enhancing</b> <b>recovery</b> from <b>oil</b> {{reservoirs}} because it acts like a scrubbing agent to contact residual oil in the reservoir and {{makes it easier for}} the oil to flow to producing wells. Old reservoirs that have produced for years are not depleted of oil. They contain residual oil that can’t be moved under primary or secondary flood processes. The tertiary process that could move the greatest amount of residual oil is carbon dioxide flooding. To obtain the residual oil, we need to inject CO 2 to <b>enhance</b> <b>oil</b> <b>recovery</b> (<b>EOR).</b> We may be able to produce up to 20 % of the original oil in place (OOIP).

However, since the viscosity of the gas is an order of magnitude lower than liquid, gas often fails to displace oil in a piston-like manner and tends to by-pass oil in the form of fingers and channels, especially when high permeability streaks present. Another problem encountered by gas injection is gravity segregation due to the low density of gas vs. oil, which causes gas to by-pass oil through gravity tongues (Namani et al. 2012). To overcome these problems, operators often inject a small slug of foaming surfactant before beginning gas injection with the aim of generating foam to reduce the mobility of injected gas as many studies have suggested (Bond et al. 1958), (Hirasaki 1985). This EOR method is called single-cycle surfactant-alternating-gas (SAG) or unsteady state test.|$|R

This study used detailed reservoir simulation and Design of Experiment (DOE) techniques to evaluate the key parameters that affect the performance of oil reservoirs undergoing CO 2 flooding and develop a proxy model for the performance prediction.
