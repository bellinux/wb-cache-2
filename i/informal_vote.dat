Hannegan, former Postmaster General James Farley, US Senator John W. Bricker, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, former federal judge Fred M. Vinson, Ohio Governor Frank Lausche, and Undersecretary of War Robert P. Patterson. After Cincinnati Reds owner Warren Giles and Chicago Cubs owner Philip K. Wrigley raised strong opposition to Frick, formerly the front runner, New York Yankees co-owner Larry MacPhail began to advocate for Chandler. When the owners met in Cleveland, Ohio on April 24, 1945 {{to vote for a}} new commissioner, Chandler's name was not on the short list; the candidates were Frick, Farley, Hannegan, Vinson, Lausche, and Patterson. None of the candidates received the required two-thirds majority, and after lobbying by MacPhail and New York Giants owner Horace Stoneham, the owners took an <b>informal</b> <b>vote</b> to see if anyone had the potential to be elected. Chandler's name appeared in the top three on each of the sixteen ballots. Encouraged, the owners then held another formal vote. After two ballots, Chandler received the necessary majority; a third vote was taken to make the choice unanimous.|$|E

40|$|Some {{opponents of}} {{compulsory}} voting claim that rising rates of <b>informal</b> <b>voting</b> point to growing antipathy towards the institution. In order {{to test this}} claim we examine recent trends in <b>informal</b> <b>voting,</b> focusing upon some recent figures, particularly those of the 2004 Federal election {{when there was a}} sharp rise in <b>informal</b> <b>votes.</b> We suggest that it is not compulsion that is leading to <b>informal</b> <b>voting</b> but rather complexity and its interactions with sociological factors that are brought into play by near-universal turnout.

40|$|The <b>informal</b> <b>voting</b> rate at the 2010 House of Representatives {{election}} was substantially {{higher than that}} recorded at the 2007 House of Representatives election and is the highest since the 1984. In every election, {{it is likely that}} a small proportion of the votes cast will not meet the specified voting requirements and will therefore be deemed informal. Levels of <b>informal</b> <b>voting</b> can provide an indication of people’s engagement with (and understanding of) the electoral process and, together with enrolment participation rates and measures of turnout, are therefore a key indicator of democratic health. The paper provides a profile of <b>informal</b> <b>voting</b> at the 2010 House of Representatives election and presents results from the Australian Electoral Commission’s 2010 House of Representatives Informal Ballot Paper Survey. Data on <b>informal</b> <b>voting</b> at previous House of Representatives elections is also included to provide a historical context for the 2010 figures. Results from the Informal Ballot Paper Survey – and, in particular, findings relating to assumed unintentional and intentional <b>informal</b> <b>voting</b> – show that a challenge remains to maximises electors’ potential participation in the electoral process...|$|R

25|$|In May 2013, an <b>informal</b> <b>vote</b> {{taken by}} faculty listed {{improving}} salaries {{the second highest}} concern, behind maintaining the school's status as a high-research university. But MSU salaries for full professors were ranked the lowest among all 50 states in July 2013. The state legislature appropriated $19 million for all administrators, faculty, and staff at the university, which amounted to about a 5 percent wage increase over two years. That was {{far less than the}} 8 percent wage increase other workers for the state of Montana received.|$|E
2500|$|On 12 December 1981, {{the state}} {{government}} held a referendum, the Power Referendum 1981, {{in an attempt to}} break the deadlock. The referendum gave voters only two choices, one for each dam proposal. In rounded figures, 47% voted in favour of the original Gordon below Franklin scheme, 8% for the compromise Gordon above Olga scheme, and 45% voted informally. There had been a significant campaign for voters to write [...] "No Dams" [...] on their ballot papers, and in total more than 33% of voters did this; these were initially all counted in the <b>informal</b> <b>vote,</b> but some were later recounted as formal as they also included a valid vote for one of the two dam options.|$|E

40|$|Sally Young {{looks at}} {{the rise in the}} level of <b>informal</b> <b>votes</b> cast in the 2004 federal election, which {{highlights}} the need for funding to be restored to the Australian Electoral Commission so that it can conduct adequate community education programs, particularly in electorates with large numbers of Australians from non-English speaking countries. Such a high level of <b>informal</b> <b>voting,</b> she argues, is at odds with the basic democratic value of political equality - a value that can only be achieved when all voters have equal knowledge of how to cast a valid vote...|$|R
2500|$|A {{motion to}} spill the {{leadership}} was voted on, and defeated, in the Liberal Party meeting which commenced at 9am on 9 February. All of the Liberal MPs and senators other than Ross Vasta attended the meeting; Vasta was on paternity leave. A total of 61 members {{voted against the}} motion, 39 supported it and one cast an <b>informal</b> <b>vote.</b> Following the vote Abbott delivered {{a speech to the}} members calling for their support, and promised to consult more with backbench MPs. In this speech, Abbott also made a new commitment to further cut tax rates for small businesses, promised that the 2015 budget would leave families better off and agreed to reduce the role his chief of staff Peta Credlin plays in the government. After the Liberal Party meeting concluded, Abbott made a televised statement in which he said that [...] "The Liberal Party has dealt with the spill motion and now this matter is behind us".|$|E

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{three aspects}} of the geography of political participation; [...] enrolment, turnout, and <b>informal</b> <b>voting</b> [...] for the compulsory electoral system of Western Australia.

Spatial variations in turnout are explained in terms of an alienation and a duty model, with the former being the more important from a politicogeographical perspective.
