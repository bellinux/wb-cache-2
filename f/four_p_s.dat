40|$|Heme oxygenase (HO- 1), the {{rate-limiting enzyme}} in the physio-logical {{breakdown}} of heme, is ubiquitous, and its expression {{can be increased}} by arsenite [As(III) ], and similar other stimuli that induce cellular oxidative stress. Interestingly, {{it has been shown}} that the As(III) -induced HO- 1 is inversely correlated with a de-crease in cytochromes P 450 (<b>P</b> 450 <b>s)</b> activity; however, the direct role for HO- 1 in the inhibition of P 450 enzymes remains unknown. Our results showed that As(III) at a concentration of 5 M de-creased the constitutive and inducible expression of CYP 1 A 1, CYP 1 A 2, CYP 3 A 23, and CYP 3 A 2 at the mRNA, protein, and cata-lytic activity levels. Moreover, As(III) decreased the nuclear accu-mulation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and pregnane X re-ceptor without increasing their degradation. As(III) also increased the binding of cytosolic AhR to heat shock protein 90 and hepatitis B virus X-associated protein 2. In the presence of 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlo-rodibenzo-p-dioxin as an inducer for CYP 1 A and rifampin as an inducer for CYP 3 A, As(III) decreased the enzymatic activity of the <b>four</b> <b>P</b> 450 <b>s</b> more than it decreased their mRNA or protein expres-sion levels. It is noteworthy that treatment with the competitive HO- 1 inhibitor, tin-mesoporphyrin, or supplementing external heme partially reversed the As(III) -mediated decrease in activities of the <b>four</b> <b>P</b> 450 <b>s.</b> In conclusion, the current study provides the first evidence that As(III) decreases CYP 1 A 1, CYP 1 A 2, CYP 3 A 23, and CYP 3 A 2 expression in freshly isolated rat primary hepatocytes. Furthermore, inhibiting the As(III) -mediated induction of HO- 1 par-tially restores the enzymatic activity of these <b>P</b> 450 <b>s</b> that was ini-tially decreased by As(III), confirming the direct role of HO- 1 in the inhibition of <b>P</b> 450 <b>s...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The p 38 {{family of}} mitogen-activated protein kinases is {{believed}} to mediate a variety of leukocyte responses to pro-inflammatory stimuli. There are {{four members of the}} p 38 family, and although activation of the different members has been studied in transiently transfected cells much less is known about activation of the endogenous <b>p</b> 38 <b>s,</b> particularly in myeloid lineage cells. To investigate activation of endogenous <b>p</b> 38 <b>s,</b> we have made monoclonal antibodies specific for each p 38 and have used these antibodies to study p 38 activa-tion by pro-inflammatory stimuli in several human monocytic cell lines.

We incorporated station corrections for P-and S-wave arrival times, estimating the correction times for each station from the averaged differences between the observed and calculated travel times (O − C times). The root mean square (RMS) of the O − C times was reduced from 0.275 to 0.204 s for the P-wave arrival time, and from 0.665 to 0.539 s for the S-wave arrival time, by incorporating the station corrections.

40|$|Steam {{explosion}} is {{a process}} used to enhance enzyme penetration and digestibility of wood. Wood chips are processed with high-pressure steam for a limited time, and the bonding between polysaccharides and lignin is weakened. After this processing, the pressure is rapidly reduced to induce steam explosion where the vapor inside a fiber expands and exerts pressure on the fiber walls. This pressure causes fiber deformation and breakage. In this study, fiber deformation caused by vapor expansion was simulated by single wood fibers using finite element modeling. When pressure is applied inside a fiber, {{it is likely to}} break from the corner and midway between two adjacent corners. The fiber is modeled with <b>four</b> layers (<b>P,</b> <b>S</b> 1, S 2, and S 3). Although the <b>P,</b> <b>S</b> 1, and S 3 layers are very thin, they significantly prevent fiber deformation. The fibers with a thin wall and a low micro-fibril angle (MFA) deform more than the fibers with a thick wall and a higher MFA. It was found that the shape of the fiber {{plays an important role in}} its deformation. The areas of localized strain are the most likely places for fiber splitting. Essentially, fiber wall damage is more likely to occur in (1) thin-walled fibers, i. e., earlywood, (2) fibers with damaged <b>P</b> and <b>S</b> 1 layers, (3) fibers with low MFAs, and (4) fibers with irregular cross-sections.

As expected from its central role in the production of lignin precursors and defense compounds, northern analysis of poly(A) + mRNA demonstrates that transcripts encoding CYP 73 A 9 are induced appreciably within 3 h after wounding.

40|$|The {{location}} {{of a group of}} interneurones projecting to contralateral motor nuclei has been established using retrograde transneuronal transport of horseradish peroxidase conjugated with wheat germ agglutinin (WGA-HRP). After labelling the motoneurones of semitendinosus, medial gastrocnemius or quadriceps muscles, interneurones which were secondarily labelled were found in lamina VIII and in the neighbouring narrow strip of lamina VII. They were found to be distributed from the 4 th lumbar to the 1 st sacral segments, with the highest concentration in the 6 th and 7 th lumbar segments and at the border between the 4 th and 5 th lumbar segments. The electrophysiological properties of lamina VIII interneurones of the 6 th lumbar segment have been investigated using both extracellular and intracellular recording. Many of these interneurones could be antidromically activated following weak stimuli applied in contralateral motor nuclei. Post-synaptic potentials were evoked from a variety of primary afferents including group I muscle afferents. However, when present, the post-synaptic potentials (<b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>s)</b> of group I origin were of considerably smaller amplitudes than <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> evoked from higher threshold muscle or cutaneous afferents and smaller than <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> which followed stimulation of the spinal cord at the thoracic level. <b>P.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> from the latter two sources appear to constitute the main input to lamina VIII interneurones. Group I input has been found in forty lamina VIII interneurones. These were usually affected by either ipsilateral or contralateral group I afferents and only exceptionally by both. Excitatory post-synaptic potentials (e. <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>s)</b> from ipsilateral afferents were evoked in about twice as many neurones as e. <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>s</b> from the contralateral afferents.

The GABA-uptake inhibitors, nipecotic acid and cis- 4 -OH-nipecotic acid (1 mM), greatly prolonged conductance increases associated with both hyperpolarizing and depolarizing responses to ionophoretically applied GABA.

Sodium pentobarbitone (100 microM), a drug that prolongs the open time of GABA-activated chloride channels, potentiated both i. <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>s</b> and responses to ionophoretically applied GABA.

Recurrent excitatory post-synaptic potentials (e. <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>s)</b> were evoked by action potentials {{in a single}} presynaptic neurone or by the antidromic activation of part of the CA 3 pyramidal cell population. The peak amplitude of unitary e. <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>s</b> was 1 - 2 mV at potentials between - 64 and - 70 mV.

Recurrent e. <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>s</b> were often followed by a small (0. 3 mV) hyperpolarization, or undershoot. Recurrent e. <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>s</b> were compared with e. <b>p.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>s</b> evoked by stimulating mossy fibres, which terminate proximally on apical dendrites of CA 3 pyramidal cells.
