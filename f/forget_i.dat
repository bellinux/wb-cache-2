2500|$|Charles's mother, Elizabeth Dickens, did not {{immediately}} support his removal from the boot-blacking warehouse. This influenced Dickens's view that a father should rule the family, and a mother find her proper sphere inside the home: [...] "I never afterwards forgot, I never shall <b>forget,</b> <b>I</b> never can forget, {{that my mother was}} warm for my being sent back". His mother's failure to request his return was a factor in his dissatisfied attitude towards women.|$|E
2500|$|Russo said, [...] "It's {{almost like}} {{in the last four}} years, it's almost like I’ve {{forgotten}} I was at FAN for so long. This (Sirius/XM's Mad Dog Radio) {{is a different kind of}} element, a different kind of show. It's all-consuming. It's so different than what I was used to", Russo said. [...] "You forget what you accomplished in that 20-year period. It's almost like I <b>forget</b> <b>I</b> was at FAN for 20 years." ...|$|E

[...] Neal was so great that he'd just take out the music paper, no score, [...] — trumpet part, [...] — trumpet part, [...] — {{trombone}} part, , and you'd play it the next day. It was the end. Cooking charts. I never <b>forget,</b> <b>I</b> couldn't believe it. I kept watching him. It was fantastic.|$|E

2500|$|After Hutchence's death, Geldof and Yates each gave police {{statements}} {{on the phone}} calls they exchanged with Hutchence that morning but did not volunteer their phone records. Yates's statement on 26 November included [...] "He was frightened and couldn't stand a minute more without his baby... was terribly upset and he said, 'I don't know how I'll live without seeing Tiger'". Yates contended that Geldof had repeatedly said, [...] "Don't <b>forget,</b> <b>I</b> am above the law", referring to his influence since Live Aid. Her statement {{said that she had}} informed Hutchence of the custody hearing being adjourned until 17 December, and that consequently she would not be bringing their daughter out to Australia as previously intended. Yates indicated that Hutchence {{said he was going to}} phone Geldof, [...] "to let Tiger come to Australia".|$|E
2500|$|In 1945, {{his mother}} Martha married British army major Kenneth Stoppard, {{who gave the}} boys his English surname and, in 1946, after the war, moved the family to England. His {{stepfather}} believed strongly that [...] "to be born an Englishman was to have drawn first prize in the lottery of life"– a quote from Cecil Rhodes– telling his small stepson: [...] "Don't you realise that I made you British?" [...] setting up Stoppard's desire as a child to become [...] "an honorary Englishman". [...] "I fairly often find I'm with people who <b>forget</b> <b>I</b> don't quite belong in the world we're in", he says. [...] "I find I put a foot wrong– it could be pronunciation, an arcane bit of English history– and suddenly I'm there naked, as someone with a pass, a press ticket." [...] This is reflected in his characters, he notes, who are [...] "constantly being addressed by the wrong name, with jokes and false trails {{to do with the}} confusion of having two names". Stoppard attended the Dolphin School in Nottinghamshire, and later completed his education at Pocklington School in East Riding, Yorkshire, which he hated.|$|E
2500|$|In February 1995, Yates left Geldof for Michael Hutchence, {{the lead}} singer of INXS, whom she had first met in 1985 when she interviewed him on The Tube. [...] Geldof and Yates {{divorced}} in May 1996, Yates moved in with Hutchence, and had a child with him. Hutchence committed suicide {{in a hotel room}} on 22 November 1997. After Hutchence's death, Geldof and Yates each gave police statements on the phone calls they exchanged with Hutchence that morning but did not volunteer their phone records. Yates's statement on 26 November included [...] "He was frightened and couldn't stand a minute more without his baby ... was terribly upset and he said, 'I don't know how I'll live without seeing Tiger'". Yates contended that Geldof had repeatedly said, [...] "Don't <b>forget,</b> <b>I</b> am above the law", referring to his influence since Live Aid. Geldof's police statements and evidence to the coroner indicated that he patiently listened to Hutchence who was [...] "hectoring and abusive and threatening". A friend of Yates and Geldof confirmed the substance of this call and added that Geldof had said, [...] "I know what time the call ended, it was 20 to 7, I was going to log it as a threatening call". The occupant in the room next to Room 524 heard a loud male voice and swearing at about 5am; the coroner was satisfied that this was Hutchence arguing with Geldof.|$|E

2500|$|Eberhard Grisebach {{visited him}} in March, writing to Helen Spengler of Kirchner's condition: [...] "I spent two mornings with Kirchner which I shall never <b>forget.</b> <b>I</b> found him sitting on a very low chair next to a small, hot stove in a yellow-painted, sloping-roofed attic. Only {{with the help of}} a stick was he able to walk, {{staggering}} around the room. ... A colourfully painted curtain concealed a large collection of paintings. When we began to look at them, he came alive. Together with me, he saw all his experiences drift by on canvas, the small, timid-looking woman set aside what we had seen and brought a bottle of wine. He made short explanatory remarks in a weary voice. Each picture had its own particular colourful character, a great sadness was present in all of them; what I had previously found to be incomprehensible and unfinished now created the same delicate and sensitive impression as his personality. Everywhere a search for style, for psychological understanding of his figures. The most moving was a self- portrait in uniform with his right hand cut off. Then he showed me his travel permit for Switzerland. He wanted to go back to Davos... and implored me to ask father for a medical certificate. ... As the woman with him rightly said, though many people want to help him, nobody is able to do so any longer. ... When I was leaving, I thought of Van Gogh’s fate and thought that it would be his as well, sooner or later. Only later will people understand and see how much he has contributed to painting".|$|E
