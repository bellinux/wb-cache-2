5|$|Gisborough Priory is characterised {{by a few}} {{highly visible}} remains. The priory church survives in a fragmentary state, {{dominated}} by the east wall of the presbytery that stands to its <b>full</b> <b>height.</b> Several of the priory church's column bases can also be seen, as can a number of excavated graves within the presbytery. Elsewhere on the site, {{the outline of the}} cloister is visible but is largely unexcavated, while the ruins of the west (or cellarer's) range constitutes the largest area of other remains above ground. A ruined gatehouse and a still-intact dovecote (the latter off-limits to visitors) stand on the western edges of the site.|$|E
5|$|In {{line with}} the aim {{to make use of}} {{renewable}} resources, the furniture in Poh Ern Shih for its resident monastics is made from bamboo. Bamboo is considered {{to one of the most}} ecologically friendly materials for use in home furnishing and flooring, because it can be harvested without felling the entire tree. There is therefore no need for replanting, and the bamboo is allowed to regain its <b>full</b> <b>height</b> again over about five years, ready to be harvested again.|$|E
5|$|The Salvation Army {{gave the}} castle to the Ministry of Works in 1948, {{and it is}} now owned by English Heritage, classed as a {{scheduled}} monument and a Grade I listed building. Subsidence and landslips have continued; the north-east tower largely collapsed in the 1950s, and further major slippages occurred in 1969, 1970, and 2002. One of the three-storey towers at the eastern side stands to nearly <b>full</b> <b>height</b> with narrow rectangular windows in the upper levels. The second tower has only about one-third of its original form. Some sections of the curtain wall have survived, as well as the foundations of the great hall, solars, and the kitchen.|$|E
50|$|Many mapping {{agencies}} {{consider that}} SR 619 follows Fuller Military Road. However, the legislature of the State of Virginia in 1983 {{released a report}} that concluded that Fuller Road is part of Marine Corps Base Quantico, {{a part of the}} U.S. Government, and as such, the Virginia Department of Transportation has not given Fuller Road any state route designation. Instead, <b>Fuller</b> <b>Heights</b> Road, which services a part of the town of Triangle has been designated as part of SR 619. The gate on Fuller Military Road for Marine Corps Base Quantico is after the intersection with <b>Fuller</b> <b>Heights</b> Road, so residents using SR 619 are not affected.|$|R
50|$|The Prince William County Board of Supervisors {{has gotten}} {{jurisdiction}} and {{passed a resolution}} to widen the portion of Fuller Road between US 1 and <b>Fuller</b> <b>Heights</b> Road to four lanes divided, providing better access to both Triangle and Marine Corps Base Quantico.|$|R
50|$|After the {{intersection}} with US 1, SR 619 continues on Fuller Road for one block, and then immediately turns onto <b>Fuller</b> <b>Heights</b> Road as a two-lane undivided roadway. This route continues until {{the intersection}} with SR 761 (Windsor Road), where SR 619 terminates. South is a gate into the Marine Corps base, and north is more housing in Triangle.|$|R
5|$|The dam was completed, and Beaver Lake was at <b>full</b> <b>height</b> by June 1966. For {{all intents}} and purposes, Harvey's Monte Ne was gone. However, in times of drought, some of the {{structures}} become visible again. The lake dropped to its lowest level on January 22, 1977, more than 27feet (8m) below its average depth, and the amphitheater and bridges were visible {{for the first time}} in more than 10 years. Before the water flooded downtown Monte Ne again, the rest of the buildings were either bulldozed or moved to avoid problems for swimmers, boaters, and fishermen. The few bridges that spanned the lagoon and the amphitheater were not demolished.|$|E
5|$|The {{leaves of}} trees are widely {{gathered}} as fodder for livestock and some can be eaten by humans but {{they tend to}} be high in tannins which makes them bitter. Leaves of the curry tree (Murraya koenigii) are eaten, those of kaffir lime (Citrus × hystrix) (e.g., Thai food) and Ailanthus (e.g., in Korean dishes such as bugak) and those of the European bay tree (Laurus nobilis) and the California bay tree (Umbellularia californica) are used for flavouring food. Camellia sinensis, the source of tea, is a small tree but seldom reaches its <b>full</b> <b>height,</b> being heavily pruned to make picking the leaves easier.|$|E
5|$|Each {{platform}} has two same-level fare control areas, one {{at either}} end of the station, and there are no crossovers or crossunders. The full-time ones are at the north end and each has a turnstile bank, token booth, and two street stairs. The ones on the Manhattan-bound platform go up to the northeast and southeast corners of Bergen and Smith Streets while those on the Coney Island-bound platform go up to the northwest and southwest corners. The fare control areas on the south end of the platforms are unstaffed, containing <b>full</b> <b>height</b> turnstiles and one street stair to the northeast corner of Warren and Smith Streets on the Manhattan-bound platform and the northwest corner for the Coney Island-bound platform. The south fare control area is more heavily used.|$|E

50|$|State Route 619 is a {{secondary}} state highway in the U.S. state of Virginia, and traverses Prince William County. SR 619 provides a cross-county connector {{as well as}} a major artery for commuters. SR 619 is known by four names: Linton Hall Road, Bristow Road, Joplin Road, and <b>Fuller</b> <b>Heights</b> Road. There are also two short concurrencies: one with SR 234 Old in Independent Hill, and one with Fuller Military Road on the border of Marine Corps Base Quantico.|$|R

5|$|From series {{three of}} Robot Wars, the Gauntlet and Trial stages of each heat were dropped, {{with the whole}} of the main {{competition}} formed around direct combat. Razer's first battle of the series was against Backstabber. Scott lowered Razer's arm into an extrusion on Backstabber, and Lewis pushed their opponent into the 'pit', an open hole in the arena floor. In the second round, despite causing damage to Aggrobot, Razer lost due to a mechanical failure: the valve which controls the direction of hydraulic fluid in the arm jammed, causing Razer's arm to raise to its <b>full</b> <b>height</b> and refuse to lower. With its rear wheels off the ground, Razer was weaponless and immobile, and eliminated early from the main competition once more. Outside of the main UK championship, Razer won the concurrent Pinball Warrior Tournament side event and retained the Best Design award.|$|E
5|$|The damaged {{section of}} the Pentagon was rebuilt and {{occupied}} {{within a year of}} the attacks. The temporary World Trade Center PATH station opened in late 2003 and construction of the new 7World Trade Center was completed in 2006. Work on rebuilding the main World Trade Center site was delayed until late 2006 when leaseholder Larry Silverstein and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey agreed on financing. The construction of One World Trade Center began on April 27, 2006, and reached its <b>full</b> <b>height</b> on May 20, 2013. The spire was installed atop the building at that date, putting 1 WTC's height at 1,776 feet (541m) and thus claiming the title of the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere. One WTC finished construction and opened on November 3, 2014.|$|E
5|$|One World Trade Center's steel {{structure}} topped {{out at the}} nominal 104th floor, with a total height of , in August 2012. The tower's antenna was then shipped from Quebec to New York in November 2012, and {{the first section of}} the antenna was hoisted {{to the top of the}} tower on December 12, 2012, and was installed on January 15, 2013. By March 2013, two sections of the antenna had been installed. The spire's completion was scheduled for April 29, 2013, but bad weather delayed the delivery of the final pieces. On May 10, 2013, the final piece of the spire was lifted to the top of One World Trade Center, bringing the tower to its <b>full</b> <b>height</b> of , and making it the fourth-tallest building in the world. In subsequent months, the exterior elevator shaft was removed; the podium glass, interior decorations, and other finishings were being installed; and installation of concrete flooring and steel fittings was completed.|$|E

5|$|The {{remains of}} the priory church are {{dominated}} by the eastern gable wall of the presbytery that still stands to its <b>full</b> <b>height.</b> Its great east window is {{regarded as one of}} the finest examples of late-13th-century church architecture. The design is so close to that of the eastern arm of Ripon Cathedral, which was built around the same time, that it is thought to have been modelled on Ripon's design. The window's tracery has disappeared, as has its sill, but from the stubs and surviving fragments it can be deduced that it had seven major lights (the glazed openings in the window). At its centre was a great circle of tracery filled with trefoiled lights. The main gable of the east wall is flanked by massive buttresses capped with gables and octagonal pinnacles. A similar pair of pinnacles top the main gable, flanking a window of unusual design; a bracket projects from the lower lobe to support a statue (no longer present), possibly of the Virgin Mary, to whom the priory was dedicated.|$|E
5|$|In {{coherence}} scanning interferometry, interference is only achieved {{when the}} path length delays of the interferometer are matched within the coherence {{time of the}} light source. CSI monitors the fringe contrast rather than the phase of the fringes. Fig.17 illustrates a CSI microscope using a Mirau interferometer in the objective; other forms of interferometer used with white light include the Michelson interferometer (for low magnification objectives, where the reference mirror in a Mirau objective would interrupt {{too much of the}} aperture) and the Linnik interferometer (for high magnification objectives with limited working distance). The sample (or alternatively, the objective) is moved vertically over the <b>full</b> <b>height</b> range of the sample, and the position of maximum fringe contrast is found for each pixel. The chief benefit of coherence scanning interferometry is that systems can be designed that do not suffer from the 2pi ambiguity of coherent interferometry, and as seen in Fig.18, which scans a 180μmx140μmx10μm volume, it is well suited to profiling steps and rough surfaces. The axial resolution of the system is determined in part by the coherence length of the light source. Industrial applications include in-process surface metrology, roughness measurement, 3D surface metrology in hard-to-reach spaces and in hostile environments, profilometry of surfaces with high aspect ratio features (grooves, channels, holes), and film thickness measurement (semi-conductor and optical industries, etc.).|$|E
5|$|The cathedral {{went through}} periods of {{enlargement}} and renovation following {{the fires of}} 1270 and 1390 that included the doubling in length of the choir, the provision of outer aisles to {{the northern and southern}} walls of both the nave and choir. Today, these walls are at <b>full</b> <b>height</b> in places and at foundation level in others yet the overall cruciform shape is still discernible. A mostly intact octagonal chapterhouse dates from the major enlargement after the fire of 1270. The gable wall above the double door entrance that links the west towers is nearly complete and was rebuilt following the fire of 1390. It accommodates a large window opening that now only contains stub tracery work and fragments of a large rose window. Recessed and chest tombs in both transepts and in the south aisle of the choir contain effigies of bishops and knights, and large flat slabs in the now grass-covered floor of the cathedral mark the positions of early graves. The homes of the dignitaries and canons, or manses, stood in the chanonry and were destroyed by fire on three occasions: in 1270, 1390 and 1402. The two towers of the west front are mostly complete and were part of the first phase of construction. Only the precentor's manse is substantially intact; two others have been incorporated into private buildings. A protective wall of massive proportions surrounded the cathedral precinct, but only a small section has survived. The wall had four access gates, one of which—the Pans Port—still exists.|$|E
