40|$|Small farm systems {{combining}} {{crop and}} animals are the important categories especially in Bangladesh. The value of crop-animal systems lies in their positive contribution to sustainability and economic growth. A central {{goal of the}} small farm is to generate a minimum target income and a sus-tainable system. These types of small scale farming are widely practiced in South East Asia and East Asia as for example China, Indonesia, Vietnam, where animal production is integrated with fish farming and vegetable production. Increasing population pressure in Bangladesh results in progressively smaller agricultural holdings and traditional grazing areas are taken over for crop production. The production systems in Bangladesh are characterized with small litter size or flocks, no or minimal inputs, low out-puts and periodic destruction of animals by disease. Typically the litter size or flocks are small in num-ber with each household containing 2 - 3 cattle and 7 - 10 poultry. Animals are owned by individual house-holds and mostly maintained under a scavenging system {{with little or no}} inputs for housing, feeding or health care. Under the prevailing situation in Bangladesh like other developing countries, the introduc-tion of more productive integrated intensive farming systems is imperative. Maximum sustainable pro-ductivity can only be achieved by integrating <b>intensive</b> livestock and <b>poultry</b> <b>keeping</b> with crop produc-tion and agroforestry. Farmers consciously diversify the use of their resources to produce mix activities, which are economically rewarding and highly stable. As such in small-scale farms in the tropical coun-tries, cattle, goats, sheep, pigs, chicken, ducks are commonly reared in combination with mixed crop-ping...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} factors {{associated}} with private sector smallholder livestock and the associated income of the poor in the Indian States of Andhra Pradesh. The data used are drawn from the Livelihood Options Study led by the Overseas Development Institute, London, specifically the Census Survey 2001 / 2 and Panel Survey of early 2005. Poorer households depend disproportionally on livestock. Important changes were noted; the average size of any single species declined considerably in the five year period beginning from 1996 / 7, the number of farms keeping the species rose in the 1996 / 7 to 2001 / 2 period but dropped in the recent 2001 / 2 to 2003 / 4 period. The poorer households kept fewer small ruminants and poultry in the latter period but richer households kept more. This might suggest that the technology is shifting towards what the better off can afford like the <b>intensive</b> <b>poultry</b> <b>keeping,</b> {{and that they have}} better access to certain resources such as crop residues. On the other hand, policies such as the ban on grazing by goats will also have affected the poor more since they rely on open-grazing methods. Farmers identified shock/stress variables and natural environment as important for the decrease in livestock population. Livestock act as a very real means of smoothing income by allowing debts to be repaid, farm inputs and medical treatment to be purchased, and dowry to be paid. More than 22 % of the farmers mentioned disease problems as a cause of the decline in livestock population. This problem needs to be addressed, possibly through public-private partnership arrangements as are being tried in other countries...|$|E

40|$|In {{rural areas}} of Tanzania local {{chickens}} are among of the potential enterprises that quickly and reasonably can generate income for the poor households. That potential notwithstanding, the sub sector is facing several production constraints that have limited its potentials for contributing to poverty alleviation. The constraints include low management capacity, low genetic potentials, diseases and poor marketing strategies. Diseases are the major constraint, and in particular New Castle Disease (NCD), which causes high mortality of up to 100 % of the stock. Despite the mentioned constraints local chicken are birds found almost in all farmer households in the rural areas. That situation {{is an indication that}} local chicken is an economic opportunity of which farmers can learn easily the entrepreneurial skills required for making local <b>poultry</b> <b>keeping</b> a reliable source for income generation and household food security. Thus, through capacity building farmers can develop the necessary attitude, knowledge and skills for <b>keeping</b> local <b>poultry</b> as an economic enterprise. Guided by the possibilities for developing enterprising local poultry keepers, the study focused on designing and implementing process for improving capacity of members of local <b>poultry</b> <b>keeping</b> group. Through capacity building to the members the expected outcome is productivity improvement and enhancement of income from the sales of chicken products. The members involved in the local <b>poultry</b> <b>keeping</b> are 36 of which women are 24 and 12 men. The group is located in Kisesa village in Magu district.

For the assay of ARV, RNA was immediately extracted (Trizolâ) and transcribed into cDNA for assaying in a nested-PCR with ARV-specific primers. For AvRV, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was performed with RNA extracts obtained by phenol-chloroform extraction. CAV was additionally investigated through a nested-PCR of thymus and spleen. Results found 5. 55 % positive for ARV and 9. 25 % for AvRV. Also, CAV and ARV genomes were detected in co-infection, in a highly prostrated and claudicating chicken flock. No ARV or AvRV infections were detected in pullets.

40|$|A {{dissertation}} on income generation by rural women through indigenous <b>poultry</b> <b>keeping</b> {{project is a}} result of the Community Needs Assessments (CNA) conducted in Chessa village in Uyui district. Prior to project intervention, the CNA exercise was conducted which came up with the community needs and challenges. The main challenge unveiled with CNA exercise which faces rural women in Chessa Village was income poverty. Rural women were socially oppressed, legally ignored, politically exploited and technologically deprived and subordinated as a production unit for bearing and rearing children. Therefore, Chessa rural women can be considered as underprivileged and less developed. It is expected that the participation of women in IGAs can contribute to enabling households to cope with income shocks, to ensure food security, to avoid an increase in poverty or to prevent vulnerable households from falling below the poverty line. Women’s income is important for achieving economic growth and sustainable development in Chessa Village and thus, their economic contributions should be given importance in policy design. From this study now, the researcher helped rural women to form a group (Upendo group) and came up with the conclusion that in order to eliminate the distressed condition of rural women and bring them to the main stream of development for achieving a sustainable livelihood, Upendo group need to be involved in income generating activities much more actively.

The constraints faced by the extensive poultry farmers were inability to diagnose sick birds (M = 3. 45), lack of market for eggs (M = 2. 52), egg cracking (M = 2. 98), lack of finance (M = 3. 44) and loss of birds/eggs to thieves, predators and hazards (M = 3. 17). The constraints faced by semi-intensive poultry producers were inability to diagnose sick birds (M = 4. 00), lack of feeds (M = 3. 00), transportation difficulties(M = 2. 80), loss of birds and eggs to predators, thieves and hazards(M = 2. 60), lack of finance(M = 3. 80) and egg cracking (M = 3. 40).
