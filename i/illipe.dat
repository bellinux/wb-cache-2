40|$|Tengkawang is {{referred}} {{to a group of}} approximately 16 species of Shorea producing <b>illipe</b> butter from their kernels. The name Tengkawang mostly referred to the Bornean <b>Illipe</b> Nut, even though they are not restrictly distributed in Borneo. Nine of the 16 species belonging to Shorea Section Pachycarpae, two species of Section Brachypterae, three species of Section Mutica and two species of Section Shorea. Recent phylogenetic studies based on molecular markers considered Section Pachycarpae tend to form a monophyletic group. This present study was aimed to investigate the nature of groupings within Tengkawang and their relatedness based on phenotypic traits. Thirteen species of Shorea and one species of Hopea as an outgroup were selected to perform a phenetic analysis. An UPGMA dendrogram of Tengkawang was obtained using average taxonomic distance. Cluster analysis indicated that genetic distance (Dist coefficient) varied from 0. 92 to 0. 24. Two main groups were formed, first group contained exclusively Shorea Section Pachycarpae and second group consisted of the remaining species from various Sections The principal Component Analysis (PCA) was also performed and showed the relative position of 13 of Tengkawang in two-dimension. The PCA has also identified 27 morphological traits having important roles in the grouping of Shorea section Pachycarpae. A comparative phylogenetic analysis using several chloroplast genes was also in accordance to the results of phenetic analysis, and that the Bornean endemic Shorea section Pachycarpae was a monophyletic group...|$|E

These fats are mostly mixtures of various vegetable fats often modified) and can consist of palm and palm kernel oil, <b>illipe</b> fat, shea butter, sal fat and kokum butter. In addition, a large variety of other vegetable oils can be used. Their composition according to triglycerides, fatty acids, sterols and other unsaponifiable components is discussed. Moreover we review {{the literature on}} analytical methods suitable for the detection and identification and determination of foreign fats in cocoa butter and chocolate. None of the methods reviewed here, allows the unequivocal quantification or just detection of foreign fats in chocolate.

40|$|The {{detection}} of vegetable fats added to coca butters in chocolateformulations {{was investigated in}} model mixtures. Cocoa butters varying inorigins, crop and treatment were analysed alone and combined at levels of 5, 10, 15 or 20 % {{to a variety of}} cocoa butter equivalents. Triglyceride profiles were obtained by high resolution GC. The areas of the major triglycerides present were plotted one vs. the other. The plots percentages of specific triglycerides showed the capabilityto detect vegetable fats added to cocoa butters in these model systems, and quantification of the addition could be done down to a 5 % level on a cocoa butter basis. The detection was most difficult {{in the case of the}} addition of <b>illipe</b> fat and the quantification could not be done below 10 %. The results suggest that in chocolate, which contains 20 - 25 % cocoabutter, this detection system is able to reach down to 1 - 2 %, thus well below the proposed 5 % regulatory level. JRC.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The Fourier {{transform}} infrared (FTIR) {{technique in}} combination with multivariate data evaluation was used to analyze {{a wide variety of}} cocoa butters (CB), cocoa butter equivalents (CBE), and mixtures thereof. The sample set con-sisted of 14 CB (10 pure from various geographical origins and 4 commercial mixtures), 18 CBE (12 mixtures and 6 pure CBE from kokum, <b>illipé,</b> and palm midfraction), and 154 mixtures of CB with CBE at various concentrations (ranging from 5 to 20 %). A total of 192 samples were analyzed in triplicate. All CB and CBE were shown to have very characteristic FTIR spectra that gave highly reproducible fingerprints. The main vibrational modes were also elucidated. FTIR can easily be employed to distinguish between pure CB and pure CBE. With prior knowl-edge of which cocoa butter is present in mixtures, FTIR can be applied to distinguish between CB mixed with CBE at the 10 and 20 % levels (corresponding to about 2 and 5 % of CBE in chocolate). However, the study revealed that a single “global” statistical model (multilayer perceptron, radial basis functions, or partial least square regression) was not able to predict the precise level of addition. The FTIR approach detailed here shows great potential as a rapid screening method for distin-guishing between pure vegetable fats and, we believe, could be extended to investigate mixtures of CB and CBE by the estab-lishment of a database...|$|E

40|$|Coming {{from the}} cocoa bean, {{chocolate}} {{is one of}} the most important sectors of the European food industry with sustained growth for many years and creating very high values in the food. Whether the cocoa bean is largely produced in the African countries (Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, and Cameroon), its derivatives are mainly consumed in industrialized countries. After negotiation at EU level, since 23 June 2000, Directive 2000 / 36 has repealed Directive of 1973 and allows the use of other veg¬etable fats (CBEs) cheaper than cocoa butter to chocolate making in limit of 5 % of the total weight of the finished product, at delight of some multinational companies. Are considered CBEs: <b>illipe,</b> palm oil, sal, shea butter and gurgikogum and mango kernels. But, in fact, it is palm oil, which is the substitute. Fifteen years after having authorized the incorporation of palm oil in chocolate, we remark in European level, the evils of it on health and the environment! A sad commentary and especially since the adoption of the Directive has deprived the African planters (sup¬ply of cocoa beans is 70 % of African origin) of a much-needed income to fight against poverty rural area. As firstly, markets have anticipated the decision, prices remained subdued and secondly it redirects a portion of the demand related to the vegetable fats to Asia which focuses supply of palm oil.

30|$|Industrials {{interest}} in fats as raw material, resides in their exceptional quality and potentialities of exploitation in several fields. Hence cocoa butter, palm, palmist and coco oils are so widely exploited that the Codex Stan 210 (1999) established standards {{in order to}} guide traders/industrials. Many other fats like avocado, olive, <b>illipe</b> and jojoba are also involved in cosmetic or pharmaceutical products {{on the basis of}} their interesting characteristics (Pontillon 1996; Joanny 2005; AAK Global 2012) Shea (Vitellaria paradoxa, syn. Butyrospermum parkii, B. paradoxa) butter which represents an important socio-economical agro-resource for its producing countries, is more and more being exploited in several industrial fields (Hall et al. 1996, Schreckenberg 2004; PNUD 2010). This increasing importance is mainly linked to its properties which would justify the wide range of its empiric uses (Hall et al. 1996). Indeed, according to these authors, shea butter has long been used in sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere for medicinal, culinary, and other applications (Tomaszkiewicz-Potepa 2012; Tomaszkiewicz-Potepa and Sliwa 2012). Nowadays, shea buter, mainly the traditional one (called BIO-shea butter) interests cosmetic and pharmaceutical firms (Pontillon 1996; Elias and Carney 2004; Nahm 2011; AAK Global 2012). Nevertheless these firms are highly exigent about shea butter quality. Whereas, the traditional processes often lead to shea butter non-conform to recommended standards (Hall et al. 1996; Mégnanou and Diopoh 2008). Several studies have been undertaken to improve shea butter properties; most of these studies just focused on one or two effecting factors. Those of Mégnanou and Niamke (2013 a) took into account many factors like nuts drying mode and time, kernels quality and roasting time, so did shea butter wrapper hygienic quality. The results drew the effects of such factors on shea butter physicochemical and microbiological characteristics, and consequently induced the optimized traditional process (Bup et al. 2012; Pouliot and Elias 2013; Nsogning et al. 2014). The resulted shea butter was in conformity with the unrefined shea butter standards for trade as proposed by UEMOA (2011). Nevertheless, because of the exigencies of industrials which take into account many other properties, shea butter utilization as raw material (Cosmetic and pharmaceutical) might be linked to its exceptional quality and high potential of exploitation (Honfo et al. 2013, 2014).|$|E
40|$|By definition, “butters” are {{anhydrous}} {{and solid}} fats at room temperature. A {{lot of different}} crude fats and butters are available in Africa and other tropical countries, and their characteristics make often them interesting to valorise. This presentation will focus on a personal experience dealing with production and development of African butters. The production of butters and particularly the shea fat, is done {{by one of the}} two basic methods, roughly described as “traditional or modern”. The rural (traditional) vegetable oil extraction processes, which predominate the extraction technologies in many of the shea kernel producing areas, involve water extraction. This method often employs simple small sized and household equipments; it is based on aqueous extraction techniques to produce oil. The work is very hard but provides jobs, money and “consideration” to the women who are traditionally in charge of this work. Such a traditional method yields not more than 35 % of the kernel oil contents and the product quality is often poor. It is obvious that a major contributing factor to the low yield is the treatment inability to adequately break the kernel cellular structures, a necessity to obtain an efficient oil/fat extraction. The “modern” methods involve the use of mechanical presses and organic solvents; although the methods are quite high-yielding (with extraction rates around 80 %), they are reportedly difficult to perform because of the high latex content in the kernels: in fact the latex agglutinates and clogs the equipment or inhibits an efficient penetration of the extraction solvent. As we all know olein rich vegetable oils are globally abundant but commercial sources of vegetable fats, or “stearin”, are less common. Stearin is used in confectionery for chocolates, cakes, etc. and for margarine industries. The most developed and well-known source of stearin is cocoa butter; the development of this production is historical and is based on the “chocolate business” involving a lot of organisms and industries mainly located in “developed” countries. Beside this, other butters like Shea butter, <b>Illipe,</b> Kokum, Sal and mangoare available sources for substitutes in the production of cocoa butter improvers (CBI), equivalent (CBE) or substitutes (CBS). Other markets for Shea butter exist in the personal care industry; the main reason for this growing interest has been the recognition by the cosmetic industry and consumers of the Sheat butter therapeutic benefits (ultra violet light protection, antiinflammatory, moisturizing, regenerative, anti-eczema and anti-wrinkle properties) due to the presence of a significant fraction of unsaponifiable matters (3 - 15 %) composed of many bioactive chemicals, e. g. triterpene alcohols, phenols, sterols and the poly-isoprenic hydrocarbons like karitenes. In this field of valorisation (cosmetics), the unsaponifiable content is a key factor. In 1992 on the demand of DESLOG company, ITERG worked and patented an interesting method of increasing the unsaponifiable content of Shea butter using cryogenic enrichment by fractionation at about – 30 °C. The final product called CRYOKARITENE (registered trade mark) can be enriched up to more than 50 % of unsaponifiable and shows excellent dermo-cosmetic properties...|$|E
