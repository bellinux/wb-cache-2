40|$|This paper {{describes}} the method {{to evaluate the}} brazed joints quantitatively through the ultrasonic C-scan images defined as three types that are overall area, localized area and honeycomb. For each type of joint, different way is suggested to distinguish the defects. The software {{used to calculate the}} overall area of the brazed joint (S 1) and the area of the defects (S 2) is developed. On the other hand, the influence of the testing parameters on the C-scan images is investigated to establish the <b>inspection</b> <b>specification</b> to assure the consistency and authenticity of the results. It is concluded that using small focus transducer focused on the brazed joints leads to optimum images and the sensitivity for C-scan should be set with the artificial defect. Keyword: brazed joint, C-scan, ultrasonic inspection, quantitative evaluation 1. Instruction The evaluation index {{of the quality of the}} brazed joints used commonly is the defect area or the proportion of the good area in the brazed joints.

40|$|Purpose: Purpose of {{this paper}} is present a {{detailed}} framework to integrate the Computer Aided Design (CAD) and Inspection (CAI) systems through the integration of the Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&T) with the inspection process in coordinate measuring machines (CMMs). Design/methodology/approach: The approach used to develop a prototype of a Knowledge Based System (KBS) applied to inspection process establishes a new methodology for integrate the geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T). The integration is achieved through the definition of the knowledge units for functional properties of GD&T, inspection resources and inspection operations in a common knowledge model. The manufacturing and processing applications are the main topics approach {{of this paper}}. Findings: The findings are focused in modeling the features and interactions between knowledge units associated to topology, geometry and tolerances with the inspection process activities. The implementation of the product knowledge model is presented in a computer platform that extracts and represents the GD&T information in a CAI system. Research limitations/implications: The implications are focused on the automation of the inspection process in a KBS application. The future research is focused on the use of artificial intelligent technique, such as genetic algorithms and neural networks, to optimize the time to execute the inspection process. Practical implications: The main outcomes and implication of the KBS prototype application are focused on the reduction of the time spend to develop the inspection process. This KBS application provides the needed information to elaborate this process without the human interface. Originality/value: The original value {{of this paper is}} the integration of the design and <b>inspection</b> <b>specification</b> in a unique prototype application.

40|$|Today, {{integrated}} circuits are fabricated {{with more and}} more devices existent on a unit area. Consequently, the inspection of such a complicated circuit poses a critical problem. A detailed visual inspection is the most effective method to screen out unreliable IC 2 ̆ 7 s. ^ But such a labor-intensive task is not suitable to be done by human operators. Also, the alignment and wire-bonding of integrated circuit are not yet fully automated. Consequently, the visual inspection process and the wire-bonding process constitute the bottle-neck of IC production. To automate these processes by means of pattern recognition and image processing techniques is a challenge. ^ A formulation of an automatic visual inspection and final packaging system is presented in this thesis. Such a system is composed of three subsystems: (1) the image segmentation and registration subsystem, (2) the visual inspection subsystem, and (3) the final packaging subsystem. The information within the visual inspection subsystem flows among three parts: (1) the visual inspection controller, (2) the design and <b>inspection</b> <b>specification</b> data base, and (3) the library of algorithms. The inspection controller decomposes the inspection job into smaller tasks. For each task, the controller activates a program fetched from the program library to operate on the sensed data by consulting the appropriate reference data. At the end of a task, the controller makes a decision of what to do next, depending on the result of the task. At last, the controller generates a report of the inspection and stops. ^ An integrated system for automatic visual inspection and wirebonding of {{integrated circuits}} is proposed in this thesis. The structure of such an integrated system follows the above general formulation. The functions of the image segmentation and registration subsystem include image segmentation, gross registration, and the microregistration of mask subpatterns. The input image S is first decomposed into the image W of the IC chip and the background. The gross registration of the IC chip is achieved by locating the mask frame. But since an IC image is a multi-layer image, each mask subpattern has to be micro-registered independently. The functions of the visual inspection subsystem include image transformation, detection and identification of IC defects, and classification. The idea of image transformation is to emphasize relevant information and to suppress irrelevant information. Furthermore, contextual information is made use of to remove ambiguity. Each IC defect is to be detected by an individual defect detector. Finally, the IC under inspection is classified into three classes: (1) accept, (2) reject, and (3) to be reworked. The final packaging subsystem solders an acceptable IC chip to the package substrate, detects the misregistration introduced during the soldering process, and then carries out the wire-bonding. ^ Such an integrated system proposed in this thesis is proved to be successful by experimental results. ...|$|E

40|$|A product often {{requires}} inspection {{on more than}} one characteristic. The traditional method determines <b>inspection</b> <b>specifications</b> for each characteristic independently. This practice ignores the interactions among characteristics in determining the disposition of an item, and prohibits tradeoffs among the quality of characteristics. In this paper, two multi-characteristic screening (complete inspection) models are proposed with different information processing requirements. In both models, screening specifications are jointly determined by considering all the economic and stochastic factors associated with the characteristics of interest. However, in Model 1, each characteristic has separate screening <b>specifications</b> and the <b>inspection</b> results of conformance (acceptance or rejections) of all the characteristics are used to determine the disposition of an item. In the second model, a joint screening rule based on an aggregation of characteristics is used to allow direct tradeoffs among the quality of characteristics. To implement the second model, the exact measured values of all characteristics of an item have to be recorded and used for a decision on that item. These two models are formulated and the solution procedures are developed.

In this paper we describe an experiment to validate the effectiveness of PBR in a meeting-based N-fold inspection.

This paper presents the conceptual developments {{of a research}} program that aims to support higher-level cognition in such demanding contexts. These process domains present a major challenge for human cognition because the related knowledge is ill-structured and spans different scientific areas that employ {{a wide spectrum of}} paradigms and models. Further, diverse notations are required to encode the knowledge. Our approach describes a problem space for performing knowledge acquisition in such domains and is set in a wider context of modeling and discovery.

These low cost infrared systems are also being used for detection of the heat-related signature of moisture within buildings (by means of phase-change, capacitive, or conductive mechanisms).

40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{evaluation}} of the predicted safety performance of three USA prototype ambulance vehicles with aftermarket structural modifications. Expected safety performance was analyzed using existing and established automotive safety principles. Information on design and construction of the vehicles was identified, and evaluated via application of basic engineering crashworthiness principles and laws of physics, with a specific focus on countermeasure design for reducing harmful loading and injury causation potential in crashes or sudden decelerations. Data sources used for the analysis included: vehicle <b>specifications,</b> <b>inspections,</b> photographs, crash tests and published crashworthiness and injury mitigation literature. Results demonstrated poor vehicle structural integrity and crashworthiness for these aftermarket modified ambulance vehicles. Assessed crashworthiness performance and occupant protection do not appear optimized even for the minimally structurally modified van. Current interior design features (seat design, patient transport device design, head strike zones and restraint systems) and layout, demonstrated predictable serious crashworthiness and occupant protection hazards. These are projected findings, rather than actual crashworthiness tests – however this is the first comparative automotive safety evaluation of prototype ambulance vehicles. This is key information for a major fleet of vehicles globally which has had minimal automotive safety attention or input to date.

40|$|The Deepwater Horizon {{accident}} {{and the role}} played by the blowout preventer (BOP), formed the basis for this Master thesis. The purpose of this report is to identify some of the challenges related to the BOP. This has been done through studying the technical aspect of the system and safety-critical functions performed by the BOP. Possible failures with a main focus on systematic failures introduced during operation and maintenance have been investigated. Key requirements in relation to the operation and maintenance of the BOP have been identified and the current maintenance practice has been inquired into. Based on this, recommendations to a systematic follow-up of BOP performance that may solve some of the identified challenges shall be presented. Both drilling specific standards and more general standards have been studied in the work with identifying key requirements. Much of the topside equipment has independent protection layers installed to mitigate the risk associated with the operation of a specified hazardous system. This is called safety instrumented systems (SIS). In the event of a demand the SIS can function independently of control system and by this mitigating the risk. For SIS there are two standards, IEC 61508 / 61511, and they apply to all safety instrumented systems in the oil and gas industry. It is these standards which are referred to as “general standards” in this report. The key findings and challenges identified in this report: The main difference between the BOP and other top side equipment is accessibility. BOPs are most of the time stationed subsea, and the time available to perform maintenance is limited. Usually maintenance is performed during the time between wells, and typically the time frame to perform all the necessary activities is too short. The requirements given for maintenance of BOPs (disregarding the test regime of the BOP) is imprecise and insufficient. Therefore maintenance program today is based much on recommendations from the suppliers. This causes problems because very often the recommendations from the supplier are so extensive that {{it is not possible to}} execute them during the time available. In connection with SIL verification it is also a problem with exaggerated performance claims made by equipment manufacturers. In regards to BOP failures the control pod is the component which seems to have the highest failure rate. This is because of increasing complexity in the system during the course of time. The annular preventer also has a higher failure rate in comparison to other components. The reason is because the annular preventer is more frequently subjected to wear than other components during well control activities. It could also be subjected to excessive stress more frequently. Systematic failures are believed to be a contributing factor to BOP failures, both for the control pods, annular preventers and other components. Regarding reliability of the BOP system the drilling specific standards do not state any specific requirements. In OLF 070 on the other hand, which is a guide to the application of IEC 61508 / 61511 in the Norwegian oil industry, there are given three minimum SIL requirements for the three most important safety-critical functions of the BOP. This is the closing of the annular preventer, the pipe ram and the blind shear ram, and they have all been given a minimum SIL 2 requirement. There are however several limitations with these requirements, and factors needed to be considered when verifying SIL requirements for the BOP:. The PFD value is very dependent on the test interval, and with extensive testing it is theoretically possible to meet high SIL requirement with less reliable systems.. Not all failures reveal themselves trough functional testing, and therefore the calculated PFD can give a false sense of safety.. Systematic failures are usually not quantified according to IEC 61508 and therefore most systematic failures are not included in the SIL verification calculations Recommendations: It is important to try to identify all possible failures and failure modes, including systematic failures. Not only is it important to identify systematic failures in order to prevent them, but to the extent possible systematic failures should also be quantified. By doing so it is possible to get a more accurate calculation of the PFD for BOPs. To address systematic errors for BOP systems it can be favorable to look at the IEC 61508 standard. The techniques recommended to be utilized in this report to address systematic errors are: - Project / Lifecycle management - Documentation - Checklists - <b>Inspection</b> of the <b>specification</b> The limited time available to perform necessary maintenance activities for the BOP has also been a recurring theme throughout this report. It is reason to believe that the time period between wells when maintenance work is being done, also is a time period where systematic failures are implemented into the system. Together with other systematic failures such as manufacturing defects, specification mistakes and implementation errors, all should be addressed by the lifecycle management. This then could result in new activities in the maintenance program / testing regime, for instance actual shear testing with pipe (destructive testing). Control function monitoring should be utilized in respect of documenting and analyzing to optimize the preventive maintenance. Effective BOP preventive maintenance requires accurate record keeping on all BOP function cycles, and this can be provided by such a system. By optimizing the preventive maintenance several advantages can be experienced, like for instance reduced downtime, a reduction of unnecessary maintenance, a reduction in systematic errors and increased reliability of the BOP. To address the challenge with limited time to perform maintenance, a second solution should be looked at as well. This involves equipping every drilling rig with two BOPs, which would give the rig crew much more time to insure the integrity of the BOP. Already some rigs do have one spare pod that is installed after each well. The pod taken out is then overhauled and ready to be re-installed after the next well and this method is suggested to be applied for not only the control pod but the entire BOP system. A problem is that most rigs today are not built for having two BOPs onboard. </p...|$|R
