The local dialect of Bahasa Sarawak (Sarawak Malay) dominates the vernacular. Bahasa Sarawak {{is the most common}} language of Sarawak Malays and other indigenous tribes. The Iban language, which has minor regional variations, is the most widely spoken native language, with 34 percent of the Sarawak population speaking it as a first language. The Bidayuh language, with six major dialects, is spoken by 10 percent of the population. The Orang Ulu have about 30 <b>different</b> <b>language</b> dialects. While the ethnic Chinese originate from a variety of backgrounds and speak many different dialects such as Hokkien, Hakka, Fuzhou, and Teochew, they also converse in Malaysian Mandarin.|$|E

5|$|The use {{of writing}} has made {{language}} even {{more useful to}} humans. It {{makes it possible to}} store large amounts of information outside of the human body and retrieve it again, and it allows communication across distances that would otherwise be impossible. Many languages conventionally employ different genres, styles, and registers in written and spoken language, and in some communities, writing traditionally takes place in an entirely <b>different</b> <b>language</b> than the one spoken. There is some evidence that the use of writing also has effects on the cognitive development of humans, perhaps because acquiring literacy generally requires explicit and formal education.|$|E

40|$|Integrating {{information}} in multiple natural languages is a challenging task that often requires manually created linguistic {{resources such as}} a bilingual dictionary or examples of direct translations of text. In this paper, we propose a general cross-lingual text mining method that does not rely {{on any of these}} resources, but can exploit comparable bilingual text corpora to discover mappings between words and documents in <b>different</b> <b>languages.</b> Comparable text corpora are collections of text documents in <b>different</b> <b>languages</b> that are about similar topics; such text corpora are often naturally available (e. g., news articles in <b>different</b> <b>languages</b> published in the same time period). The main idea of our method is to exploit frequency correlations of words in <b>different</b> <b>languages</b> in the comparable corpora and discover mappings between words in <b>different</b> <b>languages.</b> Such mappings can then be used to further discover mappings between documents in <b>different</b> <b>languages,</b> achieving cross-lingual {{information in}}tegration. Evaluation of the proposed method on a 120 MB Chinese-English comparable news collection shows that the proposed method is effective for mapping words and documents in English and Chinese. Since our method only relies on naturally available comparable corpora, it is generally applicable to any language pairs {{as long as we have}} comparable corpora...|$|R

5|$|When {{flying the}} Lithuanian flag with other flags, the {{following}} is the correct order of precedence: The national flag, the historical (state) flag, flags of foreign states, {{the flag of the}} European Union, international NGOs, the presidential standard, military and government standards, county flags, city flags and any others. When foreign flags are used alongside the Lithuanian flag, the flags are sorted according to their countries' names in the Lithuanian language. The only exception is when the congress or meeting held in Lithuanian dictates a <b>different</b> <b>language</b> to be used for sorting. The European Union flag has been hoisted since Lithuania {{became a member of the}} organization. While not mentioned by name in the law, the flag of NATO can be used in Lithuania, since it belongs to that organization as well. It is also common to fly the flags of Estonia and Latvia during certain occasions, mainly the celebration of independence of the three Baltic states. The Law of the Republic of Lithuania on the National Flag and Other Flags governs the rules, use, protocol and manufacturing of the national and other flags used inside the country.|$|E
5|$|In Guazacapán, now a {{municipality}} in Santa Rosa, Pedro de Alvardo {{described his}} encounter {{with people who}} were neither Maya nor Pipil, speaking a <b>different</b> <b>language</b> altogether; these people were probably Xinca. At this point Alvarado's force consisted of 250 Spanish infantry accompanied by 6,000 indigenous allies, mostly Kaqchikel and Cholutec. Alvarado and his army defeated and occupied the most important Xinca city, named as Atiquipaque, usually considered {{to be in the}} Taxisco area. The defending warriors were described by Alvarado as engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat using spears, stakes and poisoned arrows. The battle took place on 26 May 1524 and resulted in a significant reduction of the Xinca population. Alvarado's army continued eastwards from Atiquipaque, seizing several more Xinca cities. Tacuilula feigned a peaceful reception only to unsuccessfully raise arms against the conquistadors within an hour of their arrival. Taxisco and Nancintla fell soon afterwards. Because Alvarado and his allies could not understand the Xinca language, Alvarado took extra precautions on the march eastward by strengthening his vanguard and rearguard with ten cavalry apiece. In spite of these precautions the baggage train was ambushed by a Xinca army soon after leaving Taxisco. Many indigenous allies were killed and most of the baggage was lost, including all the crossbows and ironwork for the horses. This was a serious setback and Alvarado camped his army in Nancintla for eight days, during which time he sent two expeditions against the attacking army. Jorge de Alvarado led the first attempt with thirty to forty cavalry and although they routed the enemy they were unable to retrieve any of the lost baggage, much of which had been destroyed by the Xinca for use as trophies. Pedro de Portocarrero led the second attempt with a large infantry detachment but was unable to engage with the enemy due to the difficult mountain terrain, so returned to Nancintla. Alvarado sent out Xinca messengers to make contact with the enemy but they failed to return. Messengers from the city of Pazaco, in the modern department of Jutiapa, offered peace to the conquistadors but when Alvarado arrived there the next day the inhabitants were preparing for war. Alvarado's troops encountered a sizeable quantity of gathered warriors and quickly routed them through the city's streets. From Pazaco Alvarado crossed the Río Paz and entered what is now El Salvador.|$|E
