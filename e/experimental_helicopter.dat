5|$|The XR-1, {{having been}} {{repaired}} in the meantime, {{was once again}} flying, and a contract had been awarded to Platt-Lepage {{for the construction of}} seven pre-production aircraft, to be built to an improved version of the XR-1A design, and designated YR-1A. Motivated by Congressional concerns about potential favouritism towards Sikorsky Aircraft, which had in the meantime been given a contract for development of an improved version of their VS-300 <b>experimental</b> <b>helicopter,</b> the contract called for delivery of the first YR-1A to the Army in January 1945. However, due to continued financial and flight-testing problems, Platt-Lepage proved incapable of meeting this schedule.|$|E

25|$|In 1951, Percival Aircraft Company {{formed a}} {{helicopter}} division, and began design {{work on a}} medium-sized helicopter designated P.74. They designed the helicopter to meet Air Ministry Specification EH.125D issued in May 1952 for an <b>experimental</b> <b>helicopter</b> to test jet driven rotors. This <b>experimental</b> <b>helicopter</b> had a teardrop-shaped fuselage with a two-seat cockpit in the nose and a large cabin that ran {{the full length of}} the fuselage. Beneath the cabin floor, two Napier Oryx gas generators fed compressed air to the tips of the three rotor blades through triple ejector ducts. The rotor blades used ailerons on the trailing edges with pitch control achieved by a screw jack. The unusual engine location required that exhaust pipes pass through the cabin wall between the rows of seats. This created excessive noise and heat for intended passengers.|$|E

25|$|The Percival P.74 (later Hunting Percival P.74) was a British <b>experimental</b> <b>helicopter</b> {{designed}} in the 1950s {{that was based on}} the use of tip-jet powered rotors. Although innovative, the tip-rotor concept literally failed to get off the ground in the P.74, doomed by its inadequate power source. Rather than being modified, the P.74 was towed off the airfield and scrapped.|$|E

2500|$|Self-described as [...] "the world's {{greatest}} {{scientist and}} outstanding mathematician", and having written {{one of the}} first scientific papers on the aerodynamics of rotary-wing flight, George de Bothezat was a refugee from the Russian Empire who had fled to the United States {{in the wake of the}} Russian Revolution. Having written and lectured extensively on rotorcraft theory, de Bothezat received a contract from the United States Army in 1921 for the construction of an <b>experimental</b> <b>helicopter</b> based on his own principles and those of his assistant Ivan Jerome.|$|E
2500|$|The SE-3101 is an early, <b>experimental</b> <b>helicopter,</b> {{developed}} by the German aviation pioneer Henrich Focke. The helicopter is probably the first French example to have tail anti-torque rotors. It has a single [...] main rotor and a similar layout to many modern helicopters, apart from its use of a double tail rotor. [...] These are mounted with their axes at 45° to the horizontal and with 90° between them, the drive shafts faired within a V-tail-like rear structure. They drive three blade, compressed wood airscrews of 1.60m (5ft2.5in) diameter. [...] The three blades of the main rotor each have a steel spar and are fabric covered; rotor diameter is 7.50m (24ft7in) ...|$|E
