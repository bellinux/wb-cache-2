Search for appropriate spreading codes {{is one of the}} main challenges of OCDMA applications and hence is an important topic which is heavily addressed in the literature. Existing codes have restrictions on code-lengths, weights and correlation properties where the number of generated codes is severely limited. Secondly, we have paid a particular attention to proposing a novel spreading code, hereby referred to as <b>Double</b> <b>Padded</b> Modified Prime Code (DPMPC) which suppresses the multiple-access interference and also enhances the network capacity. Then, we have applied the DPMPC to both coherent and incoherent time-spreading OCDMA transceivers and analysed their overall performances. We have also proposed novel transceivers which are power-efficient, simple and able to accommodate great number of simultaneous users. Accordingly, an advanced two-dimensional frequency-polarization modulation for OCDMA has been introduced, for the first time, to elevate the system security as well as the performance. Finally, the application of OCDMA in the passive optical network leading to the OCDMA-PON architecture has been established including the optical line terminal and network units.

40|$|The {{rehabilitation}} of the knee with a deficient anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) always presents a great challenge. Isokinetic assessment allows muscle performance to be quantified. The antishear device, introduced by Johnson, has the distinct advantage of minimizing the anterior translation force during isokinetic exercise. In a previous report, {{there was a significant}} difference between the Johnson <b>double</b> <b>pad</b> antishear device and the standard single pad device in knee extension. The main purpose of this study was to define a correlation equation such that data generated in the use of the two different devices can be compared for assessment. Ten subjects were tested with the Cybex isokinetic dynamometer with a randomly selected sequence of test speeds. Correlation coefficient (r), regression analysis and paired t tests (P) were performed to estimate the correlation and difference between the two devices. It is concluded that a significant difference in the data generated between the two devices indicated that a single device should be selected to carry out a series of comparisons on a particular subject. However, if the two devices are used in a series of testings, a set of correlation equations has been defined to facilitate such comparison.

Correlation and paired t tests (P) were performed to find out the correlation and difference between the two devices. There was significant difference in performance assessment between the two devices in knee extension (P 0. 05). There was also a high correlation (r > 0. 75) between the two devices. It is concluded that because of the significant difference of data generated between the two devices, it is important to select one single device with each patient during a series of testings...|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} decades, public {{awareness}} of the environmental, economic and social consequences of using fossil fuels has considerably grown. Moreover, not only the supply of fossil resources is limited, but also the environmental impact represents a relevant issue, so leading to an increased consideration of clean and renewable alternatives to traditional technologies. During recent years, the automotive industry has shown a growing interest in electric and hybrid electric vehicles. However, the transition to all-electric transportation is now limited by the high cost of the vehicles, the limited range and the long recharging time. Distributed IPT (inductive power transfer) systems can be the solution to the range restrictions of EVs by charging the vehicle while driving thanks to, a set of loosely coupled coils, so also reducing required battery size as well as overall cost of the vehicle. The concept of wireless power transfer via magnetic induction was introduced two decades ago. Nowadays, this technology is becoming more efficient and more suitable for new applications. This dissertation made an effort to address the requirements of IPT EV battery charging system with high efficiency and good tolerance to misalignment. A survey of a typical IPT for EV application has been reported, while a concentrated DD-BP solution has been proposed in order to enhance the IPT charging system capability of transferring power to a stationary EV with good efficiency and good tolerance to movement. The current trend in EV battery charging application is represented by the lamped coil system, whose different structures have been reviewed. Moreover, this thesis presented the design of a charging pad magnetic structure, called <b>Double</b> D <b>pad</b> combined with a Bipolar secondary pad, in order to enhance coupling performance. A finite element magnetic analysis has been performed in order to obtain the electric parameters of the proposed magnetic coupler. Furthermore, a mathematical model has been developed by considering the different sides of the system. The mathematical model allows to accurately predict the behavior of inductive coils and coreless transformer. A set of simulation has been carried out in order to compare the analytical and simulated results. The proposed EV IPT system has shown the feasibility of using fixed frequency, single pick up system to transfer power efficiently across a large air gap, with variable coupling. This result has been reached by means of proper design of the charging pad magnetics, of tuning network and of a pick-control based on a buck boost converter topology...|$|R
40|$|Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is {{a strong}} orexigenic {{neurotransmitter}} also known to modulate several neuroendocrine axes. alpha-Melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) is an essential anorectic neuropeptide, acting on hypothalamic MC 3 / 4 receptor subtypes. When given as an intracerebroventricular bolus injection, Melanotan-II (MT-II), a non selective MC receptor agonist, inhibits feeding, suppresses the NPY orexigenic action, and reduces basal insulinaemia. We evaluated {{the effects of a}} 7 -day central infusion of MT-II (15 nmol/day) given either alone or in association with NPY (5 nmol/day) in male Sprague-Dawley rats. MT-II produced almost full anorexia for 1 - 2 days but then feeding gradually returned to normal despite continued MT-II infusion. When coinfused with NPY, MT-II also produced the same initial anorectic episode but then maintained feeding to upper normal levels, thus cancelling the hyperphagia driven by NPY. Whereas NPY infusion produced a <b>doubling</b> of fat <b>pad</b> weight, MT-II reduced adiposity by a factor of two compared to pair-fed rats, and vastly curtailed the NPY-driven increase in fat pad weight. MT-II infusion also significantly curtailed the NPY-induced rise in insulin and leptin secretions. NPY infusion significantly inhibited hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin mRNA expression, most likely cancelling the alpha-MSH anorectic activity. As expected from previous studies, chronic NPY infusion strongly inhibited both the gonadotropic and somatotropic axes, and coinfusion of MT-II did not reverse these NPY-driven effects, in sharp contrast with that seen for the metabolic data. MT-II infusion alone had little effect on these axes. In conclusion, chronic MT-II infusion generated a severe but transient reduction in feeding, suggesting an escape phenomenon, and clearly reduced fat pad size. When coinfused with NPY, MT-II was able to cancel most of the NPY effects on feeding, but not those on the neuroendocrine axes. It appears therefore that, as expected, NPY and alpha-MSH closely interact in the control of feeding, whereas the neural pathways by which NPY affects growth and reproduction are distinct and not sensitive to MC peptide modulation...|$|R
40|$|International audienceGNSS signal {{processing}} for a receiver in a geostationary environment {{is more difficult}} than for a classical receiver on Earth in normal conditions. There are numerous differences between the GNSS signals that an Earth user receives and the signals that a geostationary satellite receives. The specific and main characteristics of the GNSS signal received by a geostationary satellite are the following: high C/No values only for ray tangential to the earth, with C/N 0 more frequently between 20 dBHz and 24 dBHz, very important Doppler values (+/- 15 kHz), and poor Dilution Of Precision factor (usually higher than 5). To cope with these particular constraints we propose to elaborate a GPS {{signal processing}} strategy that has the particularity to be autonomous, that is the receiver does not use aiding data" downloaded from Earth to compute its position. In that case, {{the complexity of the}} receiver as well as its cost is lowered. Its integration in the satellite payload is eased too. The geostationary receiver position is computed along the day mainly through an acquisition snapshot process and an orbital filter. As the Doppler range is too large to be processed, as a preliminary step of the strategy, we reduce the Doppler uncertainty by computing the GPS satellite position thanks to almanacs data previously demodulated. This preliminary step is investigated {{in the first part of}} the paper. To be able to process enough GPS signals all along the day, with a geometry as good as possible but still limited due to the situation, we implement an acquisition method that is able to cope with C/N 0 signal values as low as 20 dBHz. Thus, three techniques have been studied and evaluated: the FFT acquisition method, the Half Bit method and the last one is called the <b>Double</b> Block Zero <b>Padding</b> method. Yet, in parallel to that, we have to ensure that the receiver may be autonomous in that it is able to know enough valid ephemeris data from visible satellites to compute its position thanks to the pseudorange measurements. Indeed, the position of the GPS satellites computed thanks to almanacs data is not enough accurate to compute the geostationary satellite receiver position. It has been shown in [2] that the data demodulation threshold must be lowered down to 25 dBHz to be sure to see at least four GPS satellites with valid ephemeris data at any time during the day. Once we have fixed the demodulation threshold to ensure the autonomy of the receiver, the position is computed through acquisition snapshots. But the position estimate obtained after the acquisition process depends on the accuracy of the peak detection and so, it depends on the sampling rate. The results obtained by using the three above mentioned acquisition schemes do not lead to an accurate position calculation mainly because of the geometry of the acquired GPS satellites. That is why we propose to implement a peak extrapolation technique to improve the accuracy of the peak detection and thus, the accuracy of the estimated pseudorange measurement. Last, in order to improve the position estimate accuracy, we propose to implement an orbital filter to be coupled with the GNSS measurements elaborated at the output of the acquisition process, that takes into account the main forces which drive the movement of a geostationary satellite. The performance of this filter is analyzed in the last part of the paper. The aim of the paper is to present and assess the performance of the global strategy outlined above to process GPS signals with a receiver onboard a geostationary satellite based on the former characteristics. This paper is organized as follows: first, the constraints due to the geostationary orbit are briefly remined, then the strategy is presented in a second part, particularly we stress the means to have an autonomous receiver. A third part is dedicated to the three acquisition techniques and their performances in term of position accuracy and availability are presented. A peak acquisition extrapolation is also detailed. In the last part, a Kalman filter using a simple force model to describe the satellite motion is studied to improve the accuracy of the navigation solution. The computational cost of the strategy is also investigated...|$|R

Supermartensitic {{stainless steel}}s are a relatively new group of alloys that contain 11 - 13 % chromium, 2 - 6. 5 % nickel and 0 - 2. 5 % molybdenum. They contain less than 0. 015 % carbon. In comparison, more common martensitic stainless steels contain 0. 1 - 0. 2 % carbon. The decreased carbon content increases the weldability of the steel by reducing the hardness in the heat affected zone and reducing carbide precipitation. This work has investigated the most typical failure mode of supermartensitic stainless steel pipelines in the oil and gas industry. Published results of failure investigations have revealed that this failure mode is hydrogen induced cracking in the weld coarse grained heat affected zone. The hydrogen source is either weld consumables or hydrogen developed on the steel surface because of the negative potential induced by the cathodic protection system. In the latter instance, the cracks have typically appeared in the toe of the fillet weld that attaches the sacrificial anode connection <b>doubler</b> plate (anode <b>pad)</b> to the pipe wall. The objective of the present work was to investigate the influence of the microstructure on the hydrogen cracking susceptibility of two typical pipeline supermartensitic stainless steels. The work has concentrated on the coarse-grained heat affected zone because this is the typical crack initiation point. The hydrogen cracking susceptibility was tested by tensile testing notched steel samples under varying conditions. Three different sets of tensile tests have been carried out. All specimens were subjected to weld heat affected zone simulation using a Smitweld simulator. All samples were first heated to a temperature close to the melting temperature in order to create a microstructure that is typical of the coarse-grained heat affected zone. Some samples were also subjected to a second heat cycle representing an adjacent second weld pass. The peak temperature of this second heat cycle was varied. The tensile test samples were machined after simulation with a 1 mm deep notch in the simulated zone. Two different materials were used throughout the testing, designated steel A and B. Both were rich grade supermartensitic stainless steels typical of the pipeline steels used in the North Sea. The distinct difference between them is that steel A is alloyed with titanium in order to avoid selective corrosion along previous austenite grain boundaries, while steel B is not alloyed with titanium. The first set of samples were tested without any influence of hydrogen and monitored during testing in order to investigate any tendency of local cracking during straining. After the tensile tests these samples were subjected to light microscopy and hardness testing in order to characterise the microstructure of each sample. The second peak temperature was found to have an impact on hardness. A second heat cycle to 500 - 550 oC resulted in an increase in hardness; while a second heat cycle to 625 - 650 oC decreased the hardness. The second set of samples were charged with hydrogen in 3. 5 %NaCl electrolyte prior to tensile testing in order to investigate the tendency for hydrogen embrittlement from hydrogen present in the material prior to straining. This is similar to the case in which hydrogen is introduced through the welding process, and the pipe is installed by reeling at a later stage. The tensile testing was performed at a slow rate (10 - 6 s- 1) in order to allow for the necessary hydrogen diffusion to the crack tip to achieve stepwise hydrogen cracking. A significant reduction in ductility compared to samples without hydrogen was observed. The third set of samples were tested under constant load immersed in 3. 5 % NaCl and subjected to a negative potential corresponding to that induced by the cathodic protection system. The load was increased by a small amount every second day in order to establish the threshold stress for hydrogen cracking during service in seawater with hydrogen being introduced on the steel surface by the cathodic protection system. A significant influence of the second heat cycle was observed. This effect was attributed to both a variation in yield strength and the influence of precipitates on hydrogen solubility and diffusion. Supermartensitic stainless steels contain a certain amount of retained austenite, and this is regarded as beneficial because it increases toughness and ductility. The retained austenite is produced intentionally in pipe products by heat treatment at a temperature where the alloy is partially transformed to austenite, normally 600 - 700 oC. The tendency to form retained austenite in the two materials was investigated by heat treatment of samples at different temperatures and time. Phase transformation temperatures were measured by dilatometer tests and X-Ray diffraction. The highest amount of retained austenite was achieved after a double tempering heat cycle, and the formation of retained austenite required longer heat treatment times in steel A than in steel B. Retained austenite may play a role in the hydrogen embrittlement process because austenite has a much higher hydrogen solubility than martensite has. The effect of the retained austenite on hydrogen cracking was investigated by tensile testing of standard round bar specimens that had been heat treated in order to achieve different levels of retained austenite. A significant effect of the retained austenite was observed. Samples with high amounts of retained austenite experienced a much higher reduction in ductility after hydrogen charging than samples with low amounts of retained austenite. In order to explain this effect, the hydrogen solubility of samples containing different levels of austenite and precipitates was measured. This was achieved by charging the samples to saturation in an electrolyte and performing hydrogen analysis. Carbide precipitation was also found to influence hydrogen solubility, and carbides precipitated at different temperatures were identified by transmission electron microscopy.
