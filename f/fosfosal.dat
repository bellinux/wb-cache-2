40|$|Injectable {{self-curing}} systems {{based on}} PMMA, phosphate-free bioactive glasses {{and the drug}} <b>fosfosal,</b> a phosphate {{derivative of salicylic acid}} with analgesic and moderate anti-inflammatory properties, have been tested in vivo to evaluate their biocompatibility. The model consisted of the injection of dough of cement into a defect created in the femur of rabbits, and the cure of the cement in situ after implantation. The biological response was studied in the short and long terms by macroscopic, radiological and histopathological examination, and quantitatively by histomorphometric and statistical analysis considering the most representative variables at the bone–cement interface: cement, bone marrow, newly formed bone and connective tissue. All bioactive formulations presented resorption of the cement {{at the end of the}} experiment in contrast to the control of PMMA, due to the presence of resorbable components. The presence or absence of the phosphate group added by the drug <b>fosfosal</b> influenced mainly on the new bone formation process. The cement formulated with bioactive glasses and in absence of <b>fosfosal</b> produced the maximum amount of neoformed bone at 2 weeks, and then it resorbed at 4 weeks to give a higher amount of neoformed bone at the end of the experiment, compared with the formulation containing only <b>fosfosal.</b> The presence of <b>fosfosal</b> and bioactive glass together affected the ossification process strongly. The osseous tissue was produced more gradually but it continuously increased giving rise to a more stable bone at the end of the experimentAuthors are grateful to the Comisio´n Interministerial de Ciencia y Tecnología, CICYT, (MAT 2004 - 01654) and the NoE EXPERTISSUES (UE Contract no. 500283 - 2) for financial supportPeer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Advanced {{material}} forum III : {{proceedings of}} the III International Materials Symposium, Aveiro, 2005 <b>Fosfosal,</b> a phosphate derivative of salicylic acid, which presents both analgesic and antiinflammatory properties, {{was used as a}} model drug to study the potential of recently developed chitosan membranes (with different crosslinking degrees) to be used as drug release rate-controlling membranes. The <b>fosfosal</b> permeation across these membranes was studied using an in-house built developed diffusion cell with online automatic monitoring. Experiments were performed using phosphate buffer saline (PBS) solution at 37 ºC. Different flow properties of the detection set up were determined in order to estimate the errors introduced by the automatic online monitoring system. For increasing crosslinking degrees the permeability initially decreased, and then increased, likely {{as a consequence of the}} crosslinking influence on a variety of properties like crystallinity and hydrophilicity that have opposite influence on permeability. In summary, it was possible to control the drug release profile by means of changing the degree of crosslinking of chitosan membranes and to follow the respective release kinetics by means of using the developed diffusion cel...|$|E
