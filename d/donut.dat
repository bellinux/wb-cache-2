5|$|The {{simplest}} {{example of}} a Calabi–Yau manifold is a two-dimensional torus or <b>donut</b> shape. Consider a circle on this surface that goes once through the hole of the <b>donut.</b> An example is the red circle in the figure. There are infinitely many circles like it on a torus; in fact, the entire surface is a union of such circles.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} The effect of {{addition}} of fiber on the quality pastry {{was to determine the}} effect of the addition of wheat fiber on the quality of fried pastry. There were fried 8 kinds of <b>donuts</b> with 0, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 % of wheat fiber (WF 600). The quality assessment <b>donuts</b> included the sensory evaluation, the measurement of the volume <b>donuts,</b> of the firmness, of the crust colour and the crumb colour and the determination of the total content of fat of <b>donuts.</b> The firmness of <b>donuts</b> increased with the increasing the content of wheat fiber. The crust colour and the crumb colour of <b>donuts</b> with wheat fiber were lighter than <b>donuts</b> without wheat fiber. Wheat fiber had the positive effect on the absoprtion of the frying fat because the total content of fat of <b>donuts</b> decreased with the increasing the content of wheat fiber. The addition of up to 3 % of wheat fiber had positive effect on the volume, the appearance, the aroma and the flavour of <b>donuts...</b>|$|R

5|$|In Shanghai {{during the}} 1930s, Sing {{and his friend}} Bone attempt to join the Deadly Axe Gang, which ruthlessly {{controls}} the city {{under the leadership of}} Brother Sum. Sing seeks to restore his confidence after being humiliated as a young boy while trying to protect a mute girl from bullies, due to the failure of the Buddhist Palm method he had learned from a pamphlet he bought from a beggar. Sing and Bone attempt to intimidate the residents of Pig Sty Alley but are chased off by its Landlady. Hearing of this, Sum orders the capture of Sing and Bone, while sending the Gang to reassert its authority {{in the wake of the}} humiliation. Three of the tenants, Coolie, Tailor, and <b>Donut,</b> reveal themselves to be martial arts masters, defeating more than fifty of the Gang. Fearing retribution, the Landlady evicts the three, but they encounter a pair of hired assassins who fight using a magical guqin that launches invisible blades. Coolie is beheaded, and Tailor and <b>Donut</b> are mortally wounded before the Landlady and her husband the Landlord reveal that they too are martial arts masters, having gone into self-exile after the death of their son. The two defeat the assassins but Tailor and <b>Donut</b> die from their injuries. The Landlords temporarily evacuate the other tenants for their safety.|$|E
5|$|As {{noted by}} Pavel Alexandrov and Hermann Weyl in their obituaries, Noether's {{contributions}} to topology illustrate her generosity with ideas and how her insights could transform entire fields of mathematics. In topology, mathematicians study {{the properties of}} objects that remain invariant even under deformation, properties such as their connectedness. A common joke is that a topologist cannot distinguish a <b>donut</b> from a coffee mug, since they can be continuously deformed into one another.|$|E

5|$|During matches, wrestlers have {{a health}} meter that drains as they perform special moves, and {{gradually}} refills {{when they are}} not attacking. Different moves use up different amounts of energy, and certain characters can win any match by repeatedly using a particularly damaging move that does not require much energy. Several different power-ups are also available in the game, including a <b>donut</b> that increases speed, bowling pins that can be used as clubs, and bubble gum that slows players down.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{has been}} {{credited}} with helping to save at least two lives. During the scene in which Homer chokes on a <b>donut,</b> a poster explaining how the Heimlich maneuver works is {{on the wall behind}} him. In May 1992, Chris Bencze was able to save his brother's life by performing the Heimlich Maneuver on him, having seen it in the episode, and in December 2007, Aiden Bateman was able to save his friend Alex Hardy's life by recalling the same.|$|E
5|$|Some hammocks are {{dominated}} by types of vegetation that grow {{in relation to the}} amount of water or type of soil present. The majority of hardwood hammocks create a thin poor soil covering the limestone called humus, made of decaying plant matter and moisture trapped by the structure of the trees. When peat forms the layer atop the limestone of a tree island, bayheads develop, dominated by bay trees such as sweetbay magnolia (Magnolia virginiana) and others like swamp holly (Ilex decidua), wax myrtle (Myrica cerifera), and cocoplum (Chrysobalanus icaco). Willowheads, dominated by willow trees (Salix caroliniana), take hold where the hydroperiod is long, usually around solution or alligator holes, and may surround the holes, giving them a <b>donut</b> appearance from above.|$|E

5|$|The account went viral in 2011 {{and led to}} the reinvigoration of Molyneux's legacy. To many, the two became entwined. Molyneux's {{reputation}} as a dreamer was reclaimed as a positive trait in light of growing opposition to conservative game design, and the parody account became a mouthpiece for that population. The tweets contributed to Molyneux's decision to leave Microsoft Game Studios and pursue riskier game ideas. They also inspired a game jam, in which about 1,000 game developers worldwide created about 300 games based on the tweets {{over the course of a}} weekend. The game jam also brought Molyneux fame within a burgeoning indie game movement. Notable games based on the parody account's ideas include <b>Donut</b> County.|$|E
5|$|The {{tracks in}} Super Mario Kart {{are based on}} {{locations}} in Super Mario World such as <b>Donut</b> Plains. Each of the four cups contains five different tracks {{for a total of}} twenty unique tracks, additionally there are four unique Battle Mode courses. The course outlines are marked out by impassable barriers and feature a variety of bends ranging from sharp hairpins to wide curves which players can power slide around. Numerous obstacles themed from the Mario series appear, such as Thwomps in the Bowser's Castle tracks, the Cheep-Cheeps from Super Mario World in Koopa Beach and pipe barriers which are found in the Mario Circuit tracks. Other features include off-road sections which slow down the karts such as the mud bogs in the Choco Island tracks. Each single player track is littered with coins and power up tiles, as well as turbo tiles which give the karts a boost of speed and jumps which launch the karts into the air.|$|E
25|$|Roughly speaking, a {{topological space}} is a {{geometric}} object, and the homeomorphism is a continuous stretching and bending {{of the object}} into a new shape. Thus, a square and a circle are homeomorphic to each other, but a sphere and a torus are not. An often-repeated mathematical joke is that topologists can't {{tell the difference between}} a coffee cup and a <b>donut,</b> since a sufficiently pliable <b>donut</b> could be reshaped to the form of a coffee cup by creating a dimple and progressively enlarging it, while preserving the <b>donut</b> hole in a cup's handle.|$|E
