[...] The penetrating ability {{of hydrogen}} peroxide {{is not as}} good as ethylene oxide and so there are limitations on the length and diameter of lumens that can be effectively sterilized and guidance is available from the sterilizer manufacturers. Hydrogen peroxide is primary irritant and the contact of the liquid solution with skin will cause bleaching or ulceration depending on the concentration and contact time. It is relatively non-toxic when diluted to low concentrations, but is a dangerous oxidizer at high concentrations (> 10% w/w). The vapour is also hazardous, primarily affecting the eyes and respiratory system. Even short term exposures can be hazardous and NIOSH has set the Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health Level (IDLH) at 75 ppm, less than one tenth the IDLH for ethylene oxide (800 ppm).

50|$|Oxygen {{deficiency}} gas monitors {{are used}} for employee and workforce safety. Cryogenic substances such as liquid nitrogen (LN2), liquid helium (He), and liquid argon (Ar) are inert and can displace oxygen (O2) in a confined space if a leak is present. A rapid decrease of oxygen can provide a very dangerous environment for employees, who may not notice this problem before they suddenly lose consciousness. With this in mind, an oxygen <b>gas</b> <b>monitor</b> {{is important to have}} when cryogenics are present. Laboratories, MRI rooms, pharmaceutical, semiconductor, and cryogenic suppliers are typical users of oxygen monitors.|$|E
50|$|For {{ethylene}} oxide, {{metal oxide}} semiconductor sensors provide a low cost, long life detector, but they lack the sensitivity necessary to detect ethylene oxide at the OSHA PEL. Instead these sensors are used only as gross leak detectors. Gas chromatography offers excellent sensitivity and selectivity towards ethylene oxide, but the monitors tend to maintenance intensive and usually sample and analyze from several measuring points in sequence as opposed to providing continuous monitoring. Electrochemical sensors offer very good sensitivity, fast alarm response times and small size.
