25|$|The {{whole notion}} of {{politics}} is they always present you with this or this or this. I'll get a newspaper to read between the lines. Why {{do you have to}} adhere to prescribed formulas that they have and people argue over them and they're all in a box. And you watch Fox claw CNN, and CNN claw Fox. Sometimes I catch a piece of the news and it seems insanity to me. I quietly support candidates. I'm not out there banging a drum for candidates. But I have supported a candidate and it's a whole other world. Once you've been exposed to it, once or twice or however many times, if you know the facts and see how they're presented, it's mind-boggling. It's a very scary arena to be in, but I do vote. I <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> pull the lever. It's kind of like pulling the lever and watching the trap door fall out from beneath you. Why should we trust any of these people? None of them ever deliver on anything. It's always disappointing.|$|E
500|$|While {{recording}} her demo album, Swift {{worked with}} demo producer Nathan Chapman, whom she {{met in a}} little shed behind a publishing company she was at. Swift said, [...] "I'd always <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> play him some new songs, and the next week he would have this awesome track, on which he played every instrument, and {{it sounded like a}} record. We did this for a period of a year to two years before I got my record deal." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Tea Leaves" [...] {{was written}} by Matthew Weiner and Erin Levy and {{directed}} by series star Jon Hamm. This is the first episode of the series that Jon Hamm had directed, with Hamm saying that he owes thanks to John Slattery for paving the way. As preparation for directing the Rolling Stones concert, Hamm looked over archival photographs of the original concert. [...] "They were kids. The Rolling Stones. It was them and The Beatles. These huge pop explosions. People were really excited about {{it and it was}} a really big deal. And, in a larger sense, gave us a sense of where advertising is going." [...] Reflecting on his directing job, Hamm noted that he tried not to put much distracting style into the show, explaining that [...] "My job was not to <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> muck it up and say, [...] "I'm gonna put my stamp on this." [...] My job was to <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> keep the train on the tracks, basically. We have a very firmly established tone and look to our show that people respond to, and that I love." [...] Although the third episode of the season, it was actually the first episode produced for season, prior to the two-part season premiere, [...] "A Little Kiss".|$|E
60|$|Then I got {{up with a}} soul full of rage, <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> bent scowling {{over that}} person, and began a {{succession}} of rude and raspy questions--and without even offering to sit down.|$|R
6000|$|... "You think then," [...] I said, with secret horror, [...] "she {{came out}} of my brain, <b>and</b> is now <b>gone</b> <b>in</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> may glide out again at an hour and a day when I look not for her?" ...|$|R
2500|$|According to Moore, {{when the}} song was recorded, [...] "We just <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> started playing, just winged it. Just {{followed}} however Elvis felt." [...] According to reports confirmed by Sam Phillips, RCA Victor producer Steve Sholes agreed not to release Presley's version of the song as a single while Perkins' release was hot.|$|R
500|$|The group {{initially}} invited Feldmann to hear its demos, and {{he suggested}} that the band regroup at his studio {{the next day to}} make a fresh start. The next day, the group wrote three songs, including the lead single [...] "Bored to Death". As the band continued to write and record, the trio chose to shelve their earlier recordings and proceeded to write 28 songs in a period of 3–4 weeks. Half of these songs were chosen to be put on the finalized album, in addition to two joke songs. Barker fought for all 28 songs to be on the album, as he felt fans had waited long enough for more new music. The trio, as well as Feldmann, regularly stayed in the studio for up to 18 hours a day. The band members would arrive at the studio with no plan for what to work on for the day. They would then write several songs in only a few hours, aiming to complete them {{by the end of the}} night. Feldmann asked the members to consider what Blink-182, as a group, are all about, to inspire the songwriting. He would encourage the musicians to write with speed, which Hoppus admitted could be frustrating. [...] "John was like, 'Okay: We've got the song structure. Write lyrics. <b>Go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> sing it. <b>Go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> sing it.' Sometimes, I was like, 'I'm not ready to sing!' (and Feldmann would reply) 'No. Go write something great right now!'" [...] Barker was more supportive of this method based on his work with the Transplants, which had a similar speedy approach. [...] "I always feel like your first instinct is your best," [...] Barker remarked.|$|E
500|$|British-Tamil {{recording}} artist M.I.A. {{was one of}} the songwriters of [...] "Elastic Love". According to her, [...] "Elastic Love" [...] was the first track that she recorded, even before she started working on her debut album. She added, [...] "It's the one I made in-between taking time out and having a baby and starting mine". When was asked about why she agreed to work with Aguilera, M.I.A. revealed, [...] "Other people were involved who I respect like Peaches and it was like a sea of women coming together to write this new thing. Christina had also had a baby, you know, so it was kind of an interesting situation". Aguilera's decision not to perform her [...] "trademark warbling" [...] while recording the song disappointed M.I.A., as she detailed in an interview with MTV News UK:I really thought I {{was going to be able}} to <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> get her vocals on to the next level and she didn't want to do it. She was like 'You might think that's great because it's not what you do, but to me I'm really bored of it'. It's interesting getting to work with people who can do things vocally that you can't... but yeah I only heard the song for the first time when everyone else did.|$|E
500|$|Madonna also enlisted American {{professional}} boxer Mike Tyson to give {{a speech}} that would be used on the track. According to the singer, [...] "I was thinking: who is in my eyes super iconic, who do I look up to, who is alive today that's been through what I feel like I've been through, that's been through a lot, survived, has stories to tell, has evolved as human being [...] is a survivor, his name came to mind right away." [...] She also revealed that she was moved and impressed after seen his HBO-documentary [...] "Mike Tyson: Undisputed Truth", directed by Spike Lee and contacted him. Tyson revealed that he ad-libbed his part of the song in one take and was inspired by Benito Mussolini, who Tyson admitted that was seen as arrogant, but he tried to come from a positive perspective and be uplifting. In an interview for Rolling Stone he explained: [...] "I didn't know what the hell I was going there for. I'm just there having a good time and hanging out with Madonna. She has her producer there and I go into the studio and I didn't know if she wanted me to talk or rap. I just <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> start talking. I'm talking about my life and things that I have endured. I'm saying some really crazy stuff. It was really intense." ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{twenty-five years}} ago when I saw a young clerk in Putnam's bookstore. I <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> asked for George Haven Putnam, and handed him my card, and then {{the young man said}} Mr. Putnam was busy and I couldn't see him. Well, I had merely called in a social way, and so it didn't matter.|$|R
60|$|Nearly {{every one}} in the village was {{at the mouth of}} the slope to see the workmen <b>go</b> <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> <b>there</b> Sam <b>and</b> Fred met Skip.|$|R
60|$|The youth {{then got}} his six bushels of money, and with these he betook himself {{straight}} to the kingdom which his sweetheart had told him of. He got his money buried in a lonely spot close to the king's palace, <b>and</b> then <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> asked {{to be taken into}} service. He obtained his request, and was taken on as stableman, to tend the king's horses.|$|R
2500|$|While Governor, Palin vetoed {{public funding}} for private, Christian schools, saying after the fact, [...] "I'm a Christian.... unconstitutional. It's illegal. You can't do that. I had to <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> veto those things and, of course, was accused then of being, 'Oh, you're {{not a real}} {{conservative}} or a real Republican. Otherwise, you would have fought for that.' No, illegal is illegal." ...|$|E
2500|$|McFadden {{was educated}} {{and is now}} a teacher at Saint Eunan's College in Letterkenny, where the success of the 2012 Donegal senior {{football}} team has lifted the spirits of staff, including mathematical whiz Edward Harvey - seen on RTÉ with an enormous grin on his face {{at the end of the}} semi-final against Cork. McFadden told the Irish Examiner, [...] "Eddie Harvey said to me last year when he was in the leisure centre, he'd pop into the jacuzzi and everyone would be talking doom and gloom and the recession. Last summer and this year too, he said he could <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> all anyone would talk about was football. It's great to hear." ...|$|E
2500|$|Soomekh became {{close with}} Lionsgate after {{appearing}} in their film Crash (2004) {{and they wanted}} her in their next big film. Not a fan of horror films she found the role challenging. [...] "I had nightmares the first month I was on set. We were shooting it for two months. People say because you're an actor it's {{not a big deal}} because you <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> it's fake or whatever. But what they don't understand is that it's actually the opposite because, as an actor, when you go in there you have to believe it's real to make your performance real. You have to get lost in the mindframe of this character", she said.|$|E
60|$|RUTH. [Dully] He's {{treated me}} all right. But I've done with that. [Suddenly her lips begin to quiver, and she hides {{them with the}} back of her hand] I never thought I'd see him again, you see. It was just a chance I met him by Hyde Park. We <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> sat down, and he told me all about himself. Oh! Mr. Cokeson, give him another chance.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is a {{pleasant}} house," [...] Harry said; [...] "the girls are pretty and nice, they play and sing well, and are really charming. But what a contrast {{it was the}} other morning when we <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> accidentally ran against them when we were going upstairs with their father, utterly untidy, and, in fact, regular sluts--a maid of all work would look a picture of neatness beside them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You can't <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> alone, <b>and</b> {{without a}} light," [...] said Mulrady, laying {{his hand on}} the arm of the excited man. [...] "Let me get more help and proper tools." ...|$|R
2500|$|Project 86 has {{sometimes}} been labeled a [...] "Christian band", although the band itself eschewed the label. The band considers its art {{to be the best}} conveyance of their message. Frontman Andrew Schwab has offered several statements on the topic. [...] "We're not going to <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> say 'Hey we're the Christian band. We're going to carry ourselves like a normal band. Hopefully people will like our music and investigate into the band [...] and they will learn our beliefs." [...] "If we're playing at Ozzfest or on Family Values...," [...] the band told 7ball after the release of their second album, [...] "there is a greater level of tact necessary in order to reach that sort of audience." [...] In a 2007 interview, Schwab further opined [...] "We always tell people that the goal has been to just write music that we love, and write music hopefully that is challenging and inspiring to people and doesn't sound like everything else out there." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rooney explained: [...] "We {{had changed}} the sound of Jennifer Lopez [...] and we didn't have {{anything}} else on the [...] album we could release as a single. We had to do another remix to keep the momentum going." [...] Then-upcoming artist Ashanti dropped by Irv Gotti's studio in New York. She recalled: [...] "Everyone was there and Ja [...] {{was on the floor}} playing video games, and they had the beat playing in the background. Chris Gotti, Irv Gotti's brother, said 'Ja's supposed to be writing this record for J-Lo, but it doesn't look like he's going to be doing anything tonight. Why don't you <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> see what's happening?' So that's exactly what I did." [...] Ashanti wrote two verses and recorded a demo for the new version of [...] "Ain't It Funny" [...] for Lopez. Gotti and 7 flew out to Los Angeles on September 10, 2001 to record the song with Lopez. The song was due to be recorded the following day, but was postponed due to the September 11 attacks. When work resumed on the song, Gotti called Ashanti from Los Angeles asking her to write another verse for the song. She recalled: [...] "I had to write it over the phone and two-way Irv the lyrics." ...|$|E
2500|$|The first {{recording}} session {{occurred in}} April 2005 {{in the garage}} of Stevens' Nashville, Tennessee home, which {{was used as a}} temporary studio. [...] "It was so hot in that garage the first session", guitarist Chris Rohman recalled in an interview. [...] "We <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> we don't have the songs, we don't know what we're doing, we're stressed, he's stressed, and it's like 90 degrees [...] in the studio. Nobody wanted to be there." [...] Stevens began playing over the chords to [...] "I'm Not Alright", initially titled as [...] "I'll Be Fine", and at that point the band decided to rework the song's lyrical theme. [...] "We're not going to lie. We're {{not going to try to}} sit here and try to sugarcoat what's happening right now or say something because it sounds good. I'm not alright", Matt Hammit said. The previous material they had written was lyrically [...] "shifted to the stuff we were going through at [...] point". [...] "I'm Not Alright", which became the album's lead single, was rewritten and represented the themes of brokenness and confession on The Face of Love. Mark Graalman noted: [...] "It's been an unbelievably hard year for the band. But we've learned to rely on God’s grace, and we've learned to be honest and transparent. [...] Being honest and transparent means not faking it; it has to be OK to say, 'No, I'm not alright'." ...|$|E
5000|$|Casting for {{the show}} had been {{difficult}} for the Freakazoid! staff, as no lead character had been found even after extensive auditions. Eventually, when writer Paul Rugg was brought to demonstrate the voice in a recording session, he ended up filling the role, as he said: [...] "I <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> did it. Then they played it for Steven Spielberg and he said 'Yep! Fine, sure, great,' and then I panicked ... and I had to do it." [...] Rugg {{played the role of}} Freakazoid through the entire series run.|$|R
6000|$|BY and by it was getting-up time. So I {{come down}} the ladder and started for down-stairs; but as I come to the girls' room the door was open, and I see Mary Jane setting by her old hair trunk, which was open and she'd been packing things in it--getting {{ready to go to}} England. But she had stopped now with a folded gown in her lap, and had her face in her hands, crying. I felt awful bad to see it; of course anybody would. I <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> says: ...|$|R
6000|$|Miss Ruck’s eyes made {{light of}} me. “Well, I don’t believe you’re a good American,” she smartly said, “and I never {{supposed}} you were. You’d better <b>go</b> right <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> talk to Mrs. Church.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I say," [...] said Mainwaring, [...] "if you're in a hurry, you'd better <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> knock. I {{hear some}} one {{stirring}} in the kitchen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No wonder," [...] murmured Tournefort. Then {{he added}} insinuatingly: [...] "Why {{not let me}} <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> {{apprehend}} Rateau now? We should have the diamonds and--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then what's the use {{of keeping}} out of sight? I'd rather <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> give them a thrashing, {{like the one we}} gave them on that island." ...|$|E
60|$|The king {{then went}} forth alone {{into the wild}} forest, <b>and</b> wandered <b>there</b> the whole day without seeing a single human being. So it went with him the second day also, but {{on the third day}} he came by {{roundabout}} ways to the little hut. He <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> asked for leave to rest himself for a little on the bench. The queen and the princes were there, but she was poorly clad and so sorrowful that the king did not recognise her, neither did he think for a moment that the two children, who were dressed only in rough skins, were his own sons.|$|R

5000|$|... 1000hp was {{recorded}} in Godsmack's newly built 4,000-square-foot headquarters in Boston. [...] "We just built it this year," [...] explained bassist Robbie Merrill. [...] "We have been looking to have one big place for a long time. All our equipment has been stored in four or five different places {{and we wanted to}} get everything in one room. So we leased out a warehouse for at least five years. We <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> put up some walls and made a studio and a lounger. We basically have all our stuff in storage at one end and at the other end we have the rehearsal space and we have our studio all set to record, as well as the lounge and a kitchen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you know}} that it is {{beginning}} to rain?" [...] he said, holding his umbrella over her head. [...] "We must <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> wait until it pauses." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hall's {{breakout}} role came in 1984, when he {{was cast}} as Farmer Ted, the scrawny, braces-wearing geek, who pursued Molly Ringwald's character in John Hughes' directing debut Sixteen Candles. Hall tried to avoid the clichés of geekness. [...] "I didn't play him with 100 pens sticking out of his pocket," [...] he said. [...] "I just <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> played it like a real kid. The geek is just a typical freshman." [...] Hall landed {{a spot on the}} promotional materials, along with co-star Ringwald. Reviews of the film were positive for Hall and his co-stars, and one for People Weekly even claimed that Hall's performance [...] " [...] the film" [...] from Ringwald. Despite achieving only moderate success at the box office, the film made overnight stars of Ringwald and Hall.|$|R
5000|$|Although [...] "space and time" [...] {{are common}} themes {{throughout}} the release, with {{songs such as}} [...] "Wasted Years", [...] "Caught Somewhere in Time", [...] "Stranger in a Strange Land" [...] and [...] "Deja-Vu", the band never intended {{for it to be}} a concept album, with Harris stating, [...] "We certainly never <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> said, 'Right let's write a load of songs on the subject of time.'"While the majority of the release's songs have disappeared from the band's live shows shortly after its supporting tour, [...] "Wasted Years" [...] and [...] "Heaven Can Wait" [...] have appeared on several subsequent tours. Performances of [...] "Heaven Can Wait" [...] have featured groups of local fans and celebrities invited onstage to sing along during the song's middle section.|$|R
