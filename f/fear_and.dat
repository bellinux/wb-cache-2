40|$|Intense {{fears are}} commonplace for {{children}} with development disabilities (DD). For example, phobias {{have been reported in}} up to 64 % of children with pervasive developmental disorders (Muris, Steerneman, Merckelbach, Holdrinet & Meesters, 1998) and 96 % of children with Williams syndrome (Dykens, 2003). However, limited research has been conducted on the assessment of <b>fears</b> <b>and</b> phobias in children with DD. This poster will review current assess-ment methods and results, methodological considerations, and discuss areas of improvement, focusing on a need for direct behavioral assessment of <b>fears</b> <b>and</b> phobias in children with DD. The phenomenology of <b>fears</b> <b>and</b> phobias has been extensively studied in typically developing children (Gullone, 2000). However, less attention has been directed towards the understanding of <b>fears</b> <b>and</b> phobias in children with developmental disabilities (DD). While 5 % of typically developing children display intense <b>fears</b> <b>and</b> phobias (Ollendick, King & Muris, 2002) a larger percentage of children with a variety o...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} how cognitive determinants and emotional determinants, in particular <b>fears</b> <b>and</b> worries, relate to STI testing behaviour. A {{survey was conducted}} online among 906 participants aged 16 to 26 years who completed a digital questionnaire about sexuality, sexual health, STI testing behaviours and cognitive and emotional factors potentially influencing testing behaviours. The cognitive factors were specified by an extended health belief model (HBM) and encompassed perceived risk and severity of STIs, perceived {{pros and cons of}} STI testing, and perceived behavioural control over STI testing behaviour. Emotional factors referred to <b>fears</b> <b>and</b> worries about STIs and STI testing. All cognitive variables of the extended HBM, as well as <b>fears</b> <b>and</b> worries, were found to be univariately associated with STI testing behaviour. In multivariate analysis, perceived behavioural control was found to add to HBM variables. As predicted the relation between <b>fears</b> <b>and</b> worries and STI testing was mediated by cognitive variables, but only the combination of extended HBM variables reduced the association between <b>fears</b> <b>and</b> worries and STI testing behaviour to non-significance; individual cognitive variables did not significantly mediate this association. Results {{of this study suggest that}} emotions influence cognitions in explaining STI testing behaviour. <b>Fears</b> <b>and</b> worries affect threat perception as well as evaluation of the behaviour, suggesting that threat appraisal and coping appraisal are intricately related and may not work in parallel as suggested by classic social cognitive models. Limitations and implications of the study are discussed...|$|R

5|$|At {{this time}} in the United States, McCarthyism was at its height, {{generating}} <b>fear</b> <b>and</b> suspicion of entertainment industry figures, academics, military figures, and government officials by accusing them of real or suggested links to communist activities. The TSO was required to submit to United States immigration authorities all the names of its musicians and other staff who would be accompanying the tour. The immigration department approved visas for all but seven musicians, suspecting them of communist activities. One of the musicians was later cleared, leaving six musicians who were denied entry.|$|E
5|$|Following <b>Fear</b> <b>and</b> Desire, Kubrick {{began working}} on ideas for a new boxing film. Due to the {{commercial}} failure of his first feature, Kubrick avoided asking for further investments, but commenced a film noir script with Howard O. Sackler. Originally under the title Kiss Me, Kill Me, and then The Nymph and the Maniac, Killer's Kiss (1955) is a 67-minute film noir about a young heavyweight boxer's involvement with a woman being abused by her criminal boss. Like <b>Fear</b> <b>and</b> Desire, it was privately funded by Kubrick's family and friends, with some $40,000 put forward from Bronx pharmacist Morris Bousse. Kubrick began shooting footage in Times Square, and frequently explored during the filming process, experimenting with cinematography and considering the use of unconventional angles and imagery. He initially chose to record the sound on location, but encountered difficulties with shadows from the microphone booms, restricting camera movement. His decision to drop the sound in favor of imagery was a costly one; after 12–14 weeks shooting the picture, he spent some seven months and $35,000 working on the sound.|$|E

5|$|In a {{study of}} 19th-century warfare, {{historian}} James Reid posits that Anderson suffered from delusional paranoia, which exacerbated his aggressive, sadistic personality. He sees Anderson as obsessed with, and greatly enjoying, the ability to inflict <b>fear</b> <b>and</b> suffering in his victims, and suggests he suffered from the most severe type of sadistic personality disorder. Reid draws a parallel between the bashi-bazouks and Anderson's group, arguing that they behaved similarly.|$|E
5|$|In some stories, kitsune have {{difficulty}} hiding their tails {{when they take}} human form; looking for the tail, perhaps when the fox gets drunk or careless, is a common method of discerning the creature's true nature.

Kitsune may also be exposed while in human form by their <b>fear</b> <b>and</b> hatred of dogs, and some become so rattled by their presence that they revert to the form of a fox and flee.|$|E

5|$|It is, as an Upanishad, {{a part of}} {{the corpus}} of Vedanta {{literature}} that presents the philosophical concepts of Hinduism. The Varaha Upanishad emphasizes that liberation from sorrow and fear requires a human being to know the non-dualistic nature of existence, oneness between Self, Brahman and Vishnu, and the role of Yoga in self-liberation, and lists ten Yamas (virtues) as essential to a liberation of one's soul: nonviolence, satya, asteya, brahmacharya, compassion, rectitude, kshama, non-hypocrisy, mitahara, and shaucha. The text describes the Jivanmukta as one whose inner state, amongst other things, is neither affected by happiness nor by suffering inflicted on him, who does not shrink out of fear from the world, nor the world shrinks from him with <b>fear,</b> <b>and</b> whose sense of calm and inner contentment is free from anger, <b>fear,</b> <b>and</b> joy toward others.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the sites}} {{are located in the}} Highlands and Islands. This may be because of the {{relatively}} sparse modern populations and consequent lack of disturbance.
