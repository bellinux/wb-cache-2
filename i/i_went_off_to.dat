500|$|Chartwell {{was mostly}} unused during the Second World War. Its exposed {{position}} in a county so near to German occupied France, meant that it was vulnerable to a German airstrike or commando raid. As a precaution the lakes were covered with brushwood to make the house less identifiable from the air. A rare visit to Chartwell occurred in July 1940, when Churchill inspected aircraft batteries in Kent. His pre-war writing assistant Eric Seal recorded the visit; [...] "In the evening the PM, Mrs C and <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> Chartwell. One {{of the features of}} the place is a whole series of ponds, which are stocked with immense goldfish. The PM loves feeding them". The Churchills instead spent their weekends at Ditchley House, in Oxfordshire, until security improvements were completed at the Prime Minister's official country residence, Chequers, in Buckinghamshire. At dinner at Chequers, in December 1940, John Colville, Churchill's assistant private secretary recorded his master's post-war plans, [...] "He would retire to Chartwell and write a book on the war, which he had already mapped out in his mind chapter by chapter".|$|E
500|$|The band {{performed}} in the UK in April 1982. NME considered that the show [...] "was all very skillfully deployed: a bruisingly clear sound of scathing force, a clockwork, Pavlovian lightshow, a variegation of light and shade in the song order that builds to the unmitigating force of 'Pornography' itself as the climax". However, the mood on stage was not good: The journalist noted that Smith looked [...] "dejected and tired" [...] for his birthday. Behind the scene, Smith's relationship with Gallup was deteriorating. When the tour reached Europe, tension was so high between the two musicians {{that they had a}} fight after a concert in Strasbourg. Tolhurst found out the next day that his two partners [...] "had both gone back to England". At home, Smith heard his father telling him: [...] "Get right back out on that tour! People have bought tickets!" [...] After two more weeks of touring, the band played their final show in Brussels. Tolhurst later related: [...] "I remember sitting in the dressing room thinking, 'oh well, that's the end of the band, then' [...] <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> France for a bit. I guess I ran away. Escaping from the reality of The Cure". Back in England, Smith took a rest with a month's camping holiday to the Lake District to [...] "clean up".|$|E

6000|$|... "The {{hell you}} say!" [...] roared Bacon, as the truth burst upon him. [...] "So that's {{what you do}} when <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> town and leave you to chop wood. So you're goun' to git married, hey?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will lie}} quiet {{as long as}} I am awake, but I cannot answer for myself if <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> sleep, which will not be long, for I am as tired as a dog. To-day's walk would have been nothing if I had been all right, it was the pain that wore me out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, uncle, {{but suppose}} <b>I</b> do <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> the rock, what chance have you of making things appear {{better than they}} are at present?" ...|$|R
60|$|He trotted off, full of merriment {{and good}} cheer, and <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> {{the club to}} sit in the window and watch the traffic coming up one way and going down the other.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> see cattle killed, {{by way of}} {{clearing}} my head, which, as you will perceive, was getting muddled. They say every Englishman goes to the Chicago stock-yards. You shall find them about six miles from the city; and once having seen them, you {{will never forget the}} sight.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> {{the little}} home at Walham Green, and made Marion {{come with me}} to Putney Common. Marion wasn't at home when I got there and I had to fret for a time and talk to her father, who was just back from his office, he explained, and enjoying himself in his own way in the greenhouse.|$|E
6000|$|... "`Now,' says I, `go there an' tell 'em what's took place. It'll be {{the better}} for {{yourself}} if you do.' An' then <b>I</b> <b>went</b> straight <b>off</b> <b>to</b> Brighton." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, what do {{you think}} then, Dad? Wouldn't it be a good idea if <b>I</b> could <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> China or some peppy place, and study {{engineering}} or something by mail?" ...|$|R
60|$|So {{they left}} it at that, and <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> with Peter <b>to</b> get my bone.|$|R
60|$|She follered me to {{the street}} door when I went and called things up the road arter me. I 'ad a snack at a {{coffee-shop}} for my dinner, but I 'adn't got much appetite for it; I was too full of trouble and finding fault with myself, and <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> my work with a 'art as heavy as lead.|$|E
60|$|MINNIE. She thinks I'm not fit {{to talk to}} you. Not that I care, {{except that}} I was fond of her, she's been good to me in her way, and I felt real bad when <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> Newcastle with {{the letter to the}} {{minister}} I never laid eyes on. She'll believe--you know what she'll believe,--it'll trouble her. She's your mother, and you're going away. You might have kept still.|$|E
6000|$|Presently I missed Yoletta {{from the}} room, and {{desiring}} above {{all things to}} have some word of congratulation from her lips, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> seek her. She was standing under the portico waiting for me. [...] "Come," [...] she said, and proceeded to lead me into the music-room, where we sat {{down on one of}} the couches close to the dais; there she produced some large white tablets, and red chalk pencils or crayons.|$|E
5000|$|On 20 April 1867 Campbell married Elizabeth Ann Mills (1849 - 1884) {{and upon}} her death married Rose Wiltshire (1858 - 1891). After her death, he married {{for a third}} time to Maud Batrum (1854 - 1909), to whom he {{remained}} married until his death. [...] He was president of the Music Hall Sick Fund, vice-president of the Music Hall Artistes' Railway Association, and an active Freemason. In 1898 he, Leno, and Johnny Danvers, Leno's performer uncle, built the Granville Theatre, in Fulham. At the opening, Campbell said: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> Peckham Rye there would now be something to keep me memory green".|$|R
6000|$|... "A kind action {{always gets}} its reward, Mikail--always, sooner or later; {{in your case}} it has been sooner, you see. Now <b>I</b> shall <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> sleep, for <b>I</b> feel as drowsy as if I had been up {{for the last three}} nights." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> down <b>to</b> the river, {{studying}} {{over this}} thing, {{and pretty soon}} I noticed that my nigger was following along behind. When we {{was out of sight}} of the house he looked back and around a second, and then comes a-running, and says: ...|$|R
6000|$|After shaving, my mind {{reverted to}} the acting I had seen, and I entertained myself before the cheval glass with some imitations of Jafferay's more exaggerated gestures. [...] "Really, {{one might think}} it a disease," [...] I said--"Stage-Walkitis!" [...] (There's many a truth spoken in jest.) Then, if I {{remember}} rightly, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> see Wembly, and afterwards lunched at the British Museum with Delia. We actually spoke about our prospects, {{in the light of}} my new appointment.|$|E
6000|$|... "With that I {{smoked a}} pipe, {{and took off}} my clo's, and tumbled in, and feeling a little bolder by this time, I blew out the candle. In gittin' into bed I knocked over the snuffers, w'ich fell with an awful clatter, and my heart lep' into my mouth as I lep' under the blankets, and kivered up my head. Howsever, I was {{uncommon}} tired, so before my head was well on the pillow, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> sleep.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir, she is {{over three}} hundred tons. Her {{broadside}} guns are all twelve-pounders, and she carries an eighteen-pounder as a swivel. She had {{a crew of}} seventy men, of whom only eight or ten got ashore, the rest were all accounted for except twelve, who are in irons below. The credit of capturing her, sir, really belongs to Mr. Glover, for although <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> his assistance he would have taken her without my aid, though the pirates were still fighting strongly." ...|$|E
6000|$|MRS. ROBERTS, crestfallen: 'I can't {{feel that}} Edward was to blame. Ed--Oh, <b>I</b> suppose he's <b>gone</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> make himself presentable. But Willis--Where's Willis, Aunt Mary?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall go {{straight}} to the Governor," [...] explained Grindley junior, [...] "and tell him that I consider myself engaged for life to Miss Appleyard. I know what will happen--I know the sort of idea he has got into his head. He will disown me, and <b>I</b> shall <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> Africa." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just that,--and then <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> rather {{suddenly}} <b>to</b> {{the other}} side of the country; and then <b>I</b> had to <b>go</b> up to London. Now I'm going to Patagonia." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{found my}} plans very seriously menaced. It {{looked as if}} the pair might take an {{immediate}} departure, and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part. At the church door, however, they separated, he driving back to the Temple, and she to her own house. 'I shall drive out in the park at five as usual,' she said as she left him. I heard no more. They drove away in different directions, and <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> make my own arrangements." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No one {{attended}} to me, but I worked hard {{all day with}} the others rowing backward and forward between the shore and the ship. When it became dusk they knocked off work, and the men went off to their huts, for it seemed that each {{of them had a}} wife, brown skinned or white. Seeing that nobody paid any attention to me, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> the little captain, who was making his way up to a hut of a better class than the others.|$|E
60|$|But, as I {{was not in}} love, no one {{shook my}} hand, so, leaving the other two to discuss the virtues and graces of the Child of Kings, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> bed filled with the gloomiest forbodings. What a fool I had been not to insist that {{whatever}} expert accompanied Higgs should be a married man. And yet, now when I came to think of it, {{that might not have}} bettered matters, and perhaps would only have added to the transaction a degree of moral turpitude which at present was lacking, since even married men are sometimes weak.|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{left home}} so that I could {{encounter}} new villages, meet people, and because I {{was tired of}} my mother[...] and nothing could have stopped me. And also so <b>I</b> could <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> war. Although I've had the war close-at-hand, I can't say I have experienced it, because I fled from it as often as I could" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is finely felt--I am grateful. But <b>I</b> {{had better}} <b>go,</b> all the same. I {{have made up}} my mind to go, for good and all. You can get on {{exceedingly}} well without me: your operetta is on wheels--it will go of itself. And your Mr. Bull's company fits me 'wie die Faust ins Auge.' I am neglecting my engagements. <b>I</b> must <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> St. Petersburg." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Cruel! I {{will stick}} by {{you in any}} way that you wish. If you think well of it, <b>I</b> will <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> Loughlinter to-morrow, and tell him that you will never return to him. And if you are not safe from him here at Saulsby, you shall go abroad with us. I am sure Violet would not object. I will not be cruel to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{you that}} are unstable! You talk at things and play at things, but you're scared. Would I mind {{it if you}} and <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> poverty, and I had to dig ditches? I would not! But you would. I think you would come to like me, but you won't admit it. I wouldn't have said this, but when you sneer at Myrtle and the mill----If I'm not to have good {{sensible}} things like those, d' you think I'll be content with trying to become a damn dressmaker, after YOU? Are you fair? Are you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I {{walked back}} to Paris, and found {{a crowd of people}} unable to enter, and learned that the gates had been closed by the king's order. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> Saint Denis, and there bought a long rope and an iron hook; and at two in the morning, when I thought that any sentries there might be on the walls would be drowsy, came back again to Paris, threw up my hook, and climbed into one of the bastions near the hut we had marked. There I slept until the morning, and now you see me.|$|E
60|$|I {{was in a}} {{very bad}} humour with myself as <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> see about having the well cleaned out. I had {{offended}} Gussie and I knew {{she would not be}} easily appeased. Nor was she. For a week she kept me politely, studiously, at a distance, in spite of my most humble advances. Rev. Carroll was a frequent caller, ostensibly to make arrangements about a Sunday school they were organizing in a poor part of the community. Gussie and he held long conversations on this enthralling subject. Then Gussie went on another visit to her friend, and when she came back so did Rev. Carroll.|$|E
40|$|Come, dear, {{kiss your}} boy goodbye, Look {{me in the}} eye, promise you’ll not cry Keep love’s fires burning bright, For Uncle Sam will see that things come right. If I know you are brave, I’ll beat the foe, So just smile and kiss me, honey, ere <b>I</b> <b>go.</b> CHORUS For I’m hitting the trail to Normandy, So kiss me goodbye; When we’ve carried the flag to victory, Then back to your arms I’ll fly. So just smile all the while when I’m over the sea, And, honey, keep your love and kisses waiting for me; For I’m hitting the trail to Normandy, So kiss me goodbye. For I’m bye. Sweet heart, I will miss you so When away <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> meet the foe In dreams I will be with you, In spirit I will cross the ocean blue; For your smile will spur me like the flag unfurled, Just one kiss from you and I can free the world...|$|R
50|$|During World War <b>I,</b> Samuel Joseph <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> France {{to fight}} for the British Army, as a captain in the Royal Irish Regiment. On his return he {{personally}} supervised a building development at Sussex Square in London for Winston Churchill.|$|R
60|$|He {{sat down}} in 'is chair behind the bar and <b>went</b> {{straight}} <b>off</b> <b>to</b> sleep with his eyes screwed up as tight as they would go. Then 'e opened his mouth and snored till the glasses shook. I suppose I've {{been one of the}} best customers he ever 'ad, and that's the way he treated me. For two pins I'd ha' knocked 'is ugly 'ead off, but arter waking him up very sudden by dropping my glass on the floor <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> back <b>to</b> the wharf.|$|R
