5|$|When Eva {{was a year}} old, Duarte {{returned}} permanently to {{his legal}} family, leaving Juana Ibarguren and her children in penury. Ibarguren and her children were forced {{to move to the}} poorest area of Junín. Los Toldos was a village <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dusty</b> region of Las Pampas, with a reputation as a desolate place of abject poverty. To support herself and her children, Ibarguren sewed clothes for neighbors. The family was stigmatized by the abandonment of the father and by the illegitimate status of the children under Argentine law, and was consequently somewhat isolated. A desire to expunge this part of her life might have been a motivation for Eva to arrange the destruction of her original birth certificate in 1945.|$|E

Recent years have seen many of the class fitted with on line refuelling, and working from Melbourne to Perth on the SCT Logistics service.|$|E
25|$|Although the park's terrain {{may appear}} rugged and durable, it is {{extremely}} fragile. More than 1 million visitors each year threaten the fragile high desert ecosystem. The problem lies within the soil's crust which is composed of cyanobacteria, algae, fungi, and lichens that grow <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dusty</b> parts of the park. Factors that make Arches National Park sensitive to visitor damage include: semiarid region, and the scarce, unpredictable rainfall, lack of deep freezing, and lack of plant litter which results in soils that have both a low resistance to, and slow recovery from, compressional forces such as foot traffic. Methods of indicating effects on the soil are cytophobic soil crust index, measuring of water infiltration, and t-tests {{that are used to}} compare the values from the undisturbed and disturbed areas.|$|E

40|$|The dust {{charging}} processes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{collections of}} electrons and ions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nonequilibrium <b>dusty</b> plasma with power-law distributions are investigated {{on the basic}} of a new q-distribution function theory in nonextensive statistics. Electrons and ions obey the power-law distributions and are with q-parameters different from each other.

Further we investigate the dust charging processes taking place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> homogeneous <b>dusty</b> plasma where only the particle velocities are power-law distributions and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dust cloud plasma where the particle velocities and densities are both power-law distributions. By numerical analyses, we show that the nonextensive power-law distributions of electrons and ions have significant effects on the dust charging processes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nonequilibrium <b>dusty</b> plasma.

25|$|In the mid-1880s {{the hunt}} for Geronimo was on and Bigelow was {{involved}} with the search, patrolling out of Fort Grant. Many patrols were carried out and the public's attention {{was drawn to the}} hunt. Harper's Weekly sent a young Frederic Remington out to document the historic events. While Remington went out with various cavalry troops of the 10th, he met a friend of an old friend <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dusty</b> west. Bigelow's brother Poultney Bigelow was a former Yale classmate of Remington and had remained in contact with him. This started a friendship which would last for decades. Bigelow allowed Remington to read his journals and see his sketches. While Bigelow never became proficient in his sketches, his journals became the basis of serial articles on {{the hunt for}} Geronimo for his brother's Outing magazine. Remington added a series of freelance sketches for the magazine that included his new friend, John Bigelow.|$|E
25|$|At , Itami confronted Austin Aries, {{following}} the latter's match with No Way Jose, exchanging blows before attacking Aries with a GTS. On October 12 at an NXT live event, Itami suffered a neck injury after a botched powerslam from Riddick Moss {{and would not}} be able to team with Kota Ibushi <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dusty</b> Rhodes Tag Team Classic in which he was scheduled to compete in. In a video announcement published on October 18, Itami vowed to return to in-ring competition at NXT's first show in Japan on December 3. However, at the event, Itami did not compete but was instead in an in-ring segment alongside William Regal where they talked to the crowd. Itami made his televised return on April 19, 2017, where he confronted NXT Champion Bobby Roode, before slapping him and executing a GTS. This led to a match at , in which Itami was unsuccessful in winning the title from Roode. On the June 7 episode of NXT, furious after his loss to Roode, Itami faced Oney Lorcan, which ended in a no-contest after Itami performed three GTS on Lorcan until Kassius Ohno attempted to save Lorcan, teasing a heel turn and a feud between the pair. On the July 5 episode of NXT, Itami teamed with Ohno in a tag team match against Sanity (Killian Dain and Alexander Wolfe), but lost after Itami refused to tag in Ohno. On the July 26 episode of NXT, Itami faced Ohno in the main event, which ended after Itami intentionally disqualified himself with a low blow to Ohno before viciously attacking and laying him out after two GTSs, followed by a 3rd onto the steel steps, cementing his heel turn.|$|E
500|$|There {{are also}} ash cloud {{deposits}} {{on the opposite}} eastern flank of the volcano. Studies of the mountain have to date {{been unable to find}} any correspondence with pyroclastic flows, but several past mudflows have been identified. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dusty</b> Creek, located by the mountain, there is a lahar at least [...] thick, containing pyroclastic flow deposits and other mudflows. However, this large mudflow is part of a [...] thick concentration of past incidents at the volcano that spans the Dusty and Chocolate Creek. In the area at least ten cubic kilometers of lithic debris are contained. Tephra deposits are for the most part constrained to the left flank of the volcano, and at least nine past incidents have been identified. These form several layers of tephra constructing the mountain. Smaller eruptions involving tephra occurred between 6,900-5,500 years ago, 3,450–200 years ago, and as recent as 316–90 years ago.|$|E
40|$|The dust-acoustic {{waves and}} their {{stability}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> permeating <b>dusty</b> plasma with <b>the</b> Maxwellian velocity distribution are investigated. We derive the dust-acoustic wave frequency and instability growth rate in two limiting physical cases that the thermal velocity of <b>the</b> flowing <b>dusty</b> plasma is (a) much larger than, and (b) {{much smaller than}} the phase velocity of the waves. We find that the stability of the waves depend strongly on the velocity of <b>the</b> flowing <b>dusty</b> plasma <b>in</b> <b>the</b> permeating <b>dusty</b> plasma. <b>The</b> numerical analyses are made based on the example that a cometary plasma tail is passing through the interplanetary space plasma. We show that, <b>in</b> case (a), <b>the</b> waves are generally unstable for any flowing velocity, but <b>in</b> case (b), <b>the</b> waves become unstable only when the wave number is small and the flowing velocity is large. When the physical conditions are between these two limiting cases, we gain a strong insight into the dependence of the stability criterions on <b>the</b> physical conditions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> permeating <b>dusty</b> plasma.

40|$|The dust-acoustic {{waves and}} their {{stability}} {{driven by a}} flowing dusty plasma when it cross through a static (target) <b>dusty</b> plasma (<b>the</b> so-called permeating <b>dusty</b> plasma) are investigated when the components of <b>the</b> <b>dusty</b> plasma obey <b>the</b> power-law q-distributions <b>in</b> nonextensive statistics. <b>The</b> frequency, the growth rate and the stability condition of the dust-acoustic waves are derived under this physical situation, which express {{the effects of the}} nonextensivity as well as <b>the</b> flowing <b>dusty</b> plasma velocity on <b>the</b> dust-acoustic waves <b>in</b> this <b>dusty</b> plasma. <b>The</b> numerical results illustrate some new characteristics of the dust-acoustic waves, which are different from those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> permeating <b>dusty</b> plasma when <b>the</b> plasma components are <b>the</b> Maxwellian distribution. <b>In</b> addition, we show that <b>the</b> flowing <b>dusty</b> plasma velocity has a significant effect on <b>the</b> dust-acoustic waves <b>in</b> <b>the</b> permeating <b>dusty</b> plasma with <b>the</b> power-law q-distribution.

2500|$|An {{optically}} thick circumstellar {{environment can}} potentially produce much larger CP than the interstellar medium. Martin suggested that LP light can become CP near a star by multiple scattering in an optically thick asymmetric circumstellar dust cloud.
