5|$|Differentiating between {{infectious}} and non-infectious illness, {{and identifying}} the underlying <b>etiology</b> <b>of</b> infection, {{can be quite}} challenging. For example, {{more than half of}} cases of encephalitis remain undiagnosed, despite extensive testing using state-of-the-art clinical laboratory methods. Metagenomic sequencing shows promise as a sensitive and rapid method to diagnose infection by comparing genetic material found in a patient's sample to a database of thousands of bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens.|$|E
5|$|Humans in {{good health}} excrete urine that is largely free of protein. Therefore, since 1827 {{physicians}} and scientists {{have been interested in}} proteinuria, the excess of protein in human urine, as an indicator of kidney disease. To better understand the <b>etiology</b> <b>of</b> proteinuria, some scientists attempted to study the phenomenon in laboratory animals. Between 1932 and 1933 a number of scientists, including Thomas Addis, independently reported the surprising finding that some healthy rodents have protein in their urine. However, {{it was not until the}} 1960s that the major urinary proteins of mice and rats were first described in detail. It was found that the proteins are primarily made in the liver of males and secreted through the kidneys into the urine in large quantities (milligrams per day).|$|E
5|$|Stuttering (alalia syllabaris), {{also known}} as {{stammering}} (alalia literalis or anarthria literalis), is a speech disorder in which the flow of speech is disrupted by involuntary repetitions and prolongations of sounds, syllables, words or phrases, and involuntary silent pauses or blocks during which the person who stutters is unable to produce sounds. The exact <b>etiology</b> <b>of</b> stuttering is unknown; both genetics and neurophysiology are thought to contribute. There are many treatments and speech-language pathology techniques available that may help increase fluency in some stutterers {{to the point where}} an untrained ear cannot identify a problem; however, there is essentially no cure for the disorder at present.|$|E

40|$|Background: The <b>etiologies</b> <b>of</b> chronic {{urticaria}} (CU) {{in childhood}} remains incompletely understood because of limited data in children. In this study, we aimed to examine possible <b>etiologies</b> <b>of</b> CU in children. Methods: Medical {{records of the}} 67 children who attended our clinic and were diagnosed with CU between January 2001 and July 2012 were analysed retrospectively.

25|$|Some studies say Alzheimer's {{and other}} dementias {{may be caused}} by high blood pressure, since it can cause blood vessel damage through constriction.

40|$|Background: Patients with {{autosomal}} dominant {{polycystic kidney disease}} (ADPKD) have a better survival in chronic dialysis than patients with other <b>etiologies</b> <b>of</b> renal failure. It {{has been suggested that}} extra-renal manifestations of ADPKD may increase the odds of complications and mortality, if these patients are transplanted. Aim: To determine whether survival and complications in transplanted patients with ADPKD are different from kidney graft recipients with other <b>etiologies</b> <b>of</b> renal failure. Subjects and Methods: Four hundred six patients with kidney transplantation were followed in three hospitals between 1976 and 2011 and 19 were carriers of ADPKD. The latter were matched by type of donor, gender, age and date of kidney transplant, with 38 graft recipients with other <b>etiologies</b> <b>of</b> renal failure. Results: Graft and patient 1, 5, 10 and 15 years survival were similar in both groups. Hospitalizations due to viral infections and sepsis were more common in patients with ADPKD. There were no differences in the rate of acute rejection, delayed graft function, cancer, gastrointestinal disorders and hospitalizations due to cardiovascular diseases. The frequency of graft loss due to death with a functioning kidney was similar between both groups. Conclusions: Patient and graft survival in transplanted patients with ADPKD were similar to patients with other <b>etiologies</b> <b>of</b> renal failure. The rate and type of complications were similar between groups with the exception of hospitalizations due to sepsis and viral infections, which were more common in ADPKD patients...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: While exophthalmus is {{quantifiable}} with {{readily available}} measurement tools, {{there is no}} such tool for hypoglobus/hyperglobus. Despite its possible life-threatening causes only few articles address the <b>etiologies</b> <b>of</b> vertical globe displacement in the current literature. The aim of our study was to describe <b>etiologies</b> <b>of</b> hypoglobus and to analyze the ratio of malignant diseases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 3000 portrait photographs taken in our ophthalmology department between 2005 and 2009 were retrospectively screened for patients with vertical globe displacement. Pictures were assessed by three independent ophthalmology-trained observers and matched to the diagnosis based on patient records. RESULTS: 95 patients with supposed vertical globe displacement were identified. Vertical globe displacement was due to an intracranial or orbital disease in 45 patients including 6 patients with a malignant disease. Additional 10 patients had thyroid associated orbitopathy. 11 patients turned out to have mere facial asymmetry, 26 patients had strabism and four patients had an ocular prosthesis. CONCLUSIONS: The <b>etiologies</b> <b>of</b> hypoglobus ranges from orbital fractures to life-threatening malignant tumors. Distinction between apparent and true hypoglobus can be challenging...|$|R
25|$|Casimir Funk, {{who helped}} {{elucidate}} {{the role of}} thiamin in the <b>etiology</b> <b>of</b> beriberi, was an early investigator {{of the problem of}} pellagra.

25|$|Trigonocephaly {{can either}} occur syndromatic or isolated. Trigonocephaly is {{associated}} with the following syndromes: Opitz syndrome, Muenke syndrome, Jacobsen syndrome, Baller-Gerold syndrome and Say-Meyer syndrome. The <b>etiology</b> <b>of</b> trigonocephaly is mostly unknown although there are three main theories. Trigonocephaly is probably a multifactorial congenital condition, but due to limited proof of these theories this cannot safely be concluded.|$|E

Material and Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out at Civil Hospital, Ahmedabad. Patients with thrombocytopenia more than 18 years of age at admission between 1 October and 31 October 2013 were followed up during their stay in hospital, diagnosis were made, and bleeding manifestations and requirement of platelet transfusion were recorded.

25|$|Autism: Oxytocin {{has been}} implicated in the <b>etiology</b> <b>of</b> autism, with one report {{suggesting}} autism is correlated with genomic deletion of the gene containing the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR).

25|$|Many {{drugs have}} been found that lessen the risk of {{neurotoxicity}} from NMDA receptor antagonists.
