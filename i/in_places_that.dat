5|$|After the Union of Lublin in 1569, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth {{had about}} 70 sejmiks (out of those, 24 {{were in the}} Grand Duchy of Lithuania). Jacek Jędruch notes a trend of an {{increasing}} number of sejmiks over time, from about 16 in the 15th century to 104 by the late 18th century, as nobility sought to meet <b>in</b> <b>places</b> <b>that</b> required less travel time. Stanisław Płaza also estimates about 100 {{at the turn of the}} 18th century. Those sejmiks elected 170 deputies (48 from Lithuania). Most sejmiks elected 2 deputies, but there were exceptions. Wojciech Kriegseisen notes that until the late 18th century, there were 44 sejmiks in Poland proper (the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland), 24 in Lithuania, and 1 in Inflanty province.|$|E
5|$|The creek turns {{south and}} enters the John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge 4.5 miles {{upstream}} from its mouth. At this point it passes through the largest freshwater marsh in Pennsylvania before becoming entirely tidal. It turns west-southwest for a few miles, passing by Philadelphia, Folcroft, Norwood, Prospect Park, Tinicum Township, and Ridley Township and receives the tributary Muckinipattis Creek from the right. Darby Creek winds through a large lagoon 30ft deep <b>in</b> <b>places</b> <b>that</b> was dredged in the 1960s. The creek then receives Stony Creek, its last named tributary, from the right and turns south for a few tenths of a mile before reaching its confluence with the Delaware River.|$|E

25|$|Simon (Franklin), Gretchen (Ward) and Sigmund (Pender) are {{a trio of}} apathetic Germans who {{dress in}} black and speak in {{monotonous}} voices. They appear <b>in</b> <b>places</b> <b>that</b> are usually the source of happy, bubbly personalities, like children's TV shows, aerobics shows, or as replacements for a department store Santa, and frequently make comments on the meaninglessness and futility of life, love and other endeavours.|$|E
25|$|Huge {{deposits}} of hematite {{are found in}} banded iron formations. Gray hematite is typically found <b>in</b> <b>places</b> <b>that</b> can have still standing water or mineral hot springs, {{such as those in}} Yellowstone National Park in North America. The mineral can precipitate out of water and collect in layers {{at the bottom of a}} lake, spring, or other standing water. Hematite can also occur without water, however, usually as the result of volcanic activity.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{potential}} diversity of climates in the ET category involving precipitation, extreme temperatures, and relative {{wet and dry}} seasons, this category is rarely subdivided. Rainfall and snowfall are generally slight due to the low vapor pressure {{of water in the}} chilly atmosphere, but as a rule potential evapotranspiration is extremely low, allowing soggy terrain of swamps and bogs even <b>in</b> <b>places</b> <b>that</b> get precipitation typical of deserts of lower and middle latitudes. The amount of native tundra biomass depends more on the local temperature than the amount of precipitation.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{trademarks}} of Bull Curry was his “wildman” {{look with}} bushy eyebrows, maniacal facial expressions and insane eyes that could scare the crowd {{just by looking}} at them. In one case he scared a girl at ringside so badly she had to be carried from the ring in terror. The wild look coupled with his wild brawling style made Bull Curry one of the most hated rule-breakers in wrestling, he was so hated <b>in</b> <b>places</b> <b>that</b> riots broke out more than once as irate fans attacked Curry in the ring.|$|E
25|$|Living Space – Created by Johanna Inman and Anna Norton, Living Space {{consists}} of five videos containing time-lapse {{photographs of the}} ways Eastern State Penitentiary is altered by the changes of weather and light.

The goal was to create photographs which are contemplative. By allowing the public to see the gradual effects of time upon specific places, growth and decay are recognized and explored as components that make Eastern State Penitentiary a more living space.|$|E

25|$|The Pre-Roman Iron Age {{began in}} Estonia about 500 BC and lasted {{until the middle}} of the 1st century AD. The oldest iron items were imported, {{although}} since the 1st century iron was smelted from local marsh and lake ore. Settlement sites were located mostly <b>in</b> <b>places</b> <b>that</b> offered natural protection. Fortresses were built, although used temporarily. The appearance of square Celtic fields surrounded by enclosures in Estonia date from the Pre-Roman Iron Age. The majority of stones with man-made indents, which presumably were connected with magic designed to increase crop fertility, date from this period. A new type of grave, quadrangular burial mounds, began to develop. Burial traditions show the clear beginning of social stratification.|$|E
25|$|Gardner wrote {{papers that}} were {{primarily}} taxonomic, strategraphic or paleoecologic. Her published papers dealt mostly with coastal plain geology. Julia {{took part in}} fieldwork all over the world, including rougher locations such as those throughout Mexico. She spent weeks visiting and spending time <b>in</b> <b>places</b> <b>that</b> other geographers may not have dared visit. Her report on the “Mollusca from the Miocene and Lower Pliocene of Virginia and North Carolina” (Professional Paper 199-A), published in 1943, built partially {{on the work of}} Dr. W. C. Mansfield, and included work Gardner had started up to 20 years earlier. This report included systemic descriptions of over 40 families of mollusca, representing 24 superfamilies and four separate orders.|$|E
25|$|The {{acceptance}} of a vast northern ocean has waxed and waned over the decades. Beginning in 1998, scientists Michael Malin and Kenneth Edgett set out to investigate, using cameras on board the Mars Global Surveyor with a resolution five to ten times better {{than those of the}} Viking spacecraft, <b>in</b> <b>places</b> <b>that</b> would test shorelines proposed by others in the scientific literature. Their analysis was inconclusive at best, and reported that the shoreline varies in elevation by several kilometers, rising and falling from one peak to the next for thousands of miles. This report cast doubt on whether the features truly mark a long-gone sea coast, and has been taken as an argument against the Martian shoreline (and ocean) hypothesis.|$|E

25|$|These {{represent}} three 'leading sectors', {{in which}} there were key innovations, which allowed the economic take off by which the Industrial Revolution is usually defined. This is not to belittle many other inventions, particularly in the textile industry. Without earlier ones, such as the spinning jenny and flying shuttle in the textile industry and the smelting of pig iron with coke, these achievements might have been impossible. Later inventions such as the power loom and Richard Trevithick's high pressure steam engine were also important in the growing industrialisation of Britain. The application of steam engines to powering cotton mills and ironworks enabled these to be built <b>in</b> <b>places</b> <b>that</b> were most convenient because other resources were available, rather than where there was water to power a watermill.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{earthquake}} hit the entire island of Jamaica, {{the citizens of}} Port Royal were at {{a greater risk of}} death due to the perilous sand, falling buildings, and the tsunami that followed. Though the local authorities tried to remove or sink all of the corpses from the water, they were unsuccessful; some simply got away from them, while others were trapped <b>in</b> <b>places</b> <b>that</b> were inaccessible. Improper housing, a lack of medicine or clean water, and {{the fact that most of}} the survivors were homeless led to many people dying of malignant fevers. The earthquake and tsunami killed between 1,000 and 3,000 people combined, nearly half the city's population. Disease ran rampant in the next several months, claiming an estimated 2,000 additional lives.|$|E
25|$|Tetanus {{is often}} {{associated}} with rust, especially rusty nails. Although rust itself does not cause tetanus, objects that accumulate rust are often found outdoors or <b>in</b> <b>places</b> <b>that</b> harbour anaerobic bacteria. Additionally, the rough surface of rusty metal provides a habitat for C.tetani, while a nail affords a means to puncture skin and deliver endospores deep within the body {{at the site of the}} wound. An endospore is a non-metabolizing survival structure that begins to metabolize and cause infection once in an adequate environment. Hence, stepping on a nail (rusty or not) may result in a tetanus infection, as the low-oxygen (anaerobic) environment may exist under the skin, and the puncturing object can deliver endospores to a suitable environment for growth.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the renaissance}} {{and the end}} of the Middle Ages, Baroque {{architecture}} replaced the traditional Gothic style. However, in France, baroque architecture found a greater success in the secular domain than in a religious one. In the secular domain, the Palace of Versailles has many baroque features. Jules Hardouin Mansart, who designed the extensions to Versailles, was one of the most influential French architect of the baroque era; he is famous for his dome at Les Invalides. Some of the most impressive provincial baroque architecture is found <b>in</b> <b>places</b> <b>that</b> were not yet French such as the Place Stanislas in Nancy. On the military architectural side, Vauban designed some of the most efficient fortresses in Europe and became an influential military architect; as a result, imitations of his works can be found all over Europe, the Americas, Russia and Turkey.|$|E
25|$|The {{conversion}} and expression in Roman script of Mandarin and Hokkien into pīnyīn helps non-Mandarin and non-Hokkien speakers with the pronunciation {{of the name}} of a place whilst remaining in tandem with the use of English and Roman script in Singapore. The repackaging of the original names of Lau Pa Sat in Roman script, and inclusion of the appearance of an English translation as a secondary title {{can be seen as a}} way of heightening the sense of authenticity and heritage of the attraction as it is marketed as a culturally-rich area in Singapore, similar to Chinatown and Little India; both of which were formerly cultural enclaves of the distinctive races. Similarly <b>in</b> <b>places</b> <b>that</b> bear cultural significance, the signs are printed in the language associated with the culture, such as The Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall which has an entirely Chinese sign without any translations.|$|E
25|$|Although meteorites {{had been}} sold commercially and {{collected}} by hobbyists for many decades, up {{to the time of}} the Saharan finds of the late 1980s and early 1990s, most meteorites were deposited in or purchased by museums and similar institutions where they were exhibited and made available for scientific research. The sudden availability of large numbers of meteorites that could be found with relative ease <b>in</b> <b>places</b> <b>that</b> were readily accessible (especially compared to Antarctica), led to a rapid rise in commercial collection of meteorites. This process was accelerated when, in 1997, meteorites coming from both the Moon and Mars were found in Libya. By the late 1990s, private meteorite-collecting expeditions had been launched throughout the Sahara. Specimens of the meteorites recovered in this way are still deposited in research collections, but most of the material is sold to private collectors. These expeditions have now brought the total number of well-described meteorites found in Algeria and Libya to more than 500.|$|E
