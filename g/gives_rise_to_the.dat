5|$|Early in {{the fourth}} week the cephalic part bends sharply forward in a cephalic flexure. This flexed part becomes the {{forebrain}} (prosencephalon); the adjoining curving part becomes the midbrain (mesencephalon) and the part caudal to the flexure becomes the hindbrain (rhombencephalon). In the fifth week of developmement five brain vesicles have formed. The forebrain separates into two vesicles an anterior telencephalon and a posterior diencephalon. The telencephalon <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and related structures. The diencephalon <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> thalamus and hypothalamus. The hindbrain also splits into two areas – the metencephalon and the mylencephalon. The metencephalon <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cerebellum and pons. The myelencephalon <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> medulla oblongata. Also during the fifth week, the brain divides into repeating segments called neuromeres. These are known as rhombomeres seen in the hindbrain.|$|E

5|$|Arches 4 and 6 {{produce the}} {{laryngeal}} cartilages. The nerve {{of the sixth}} arch becomes the recurrent laryngeal nerve. The nerve of the fourth arch <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> superior laryngeal nerve. The arteries of the fourth arch, which project between the nerves of the fourth and sixth arches, become the left-sided arch of the aorta and the right subclavian artery. The arteries of the sixth arch persists as the ductus arteriosus on the left, and is obliterated on the right.|$|E
5|$|Epigenetic {{changes in}} {{eukaryotic}} biology serve {{to regulate the}} process of cellular differentiation. During morphogenesis, totipotent stem cells become the various pluripotent cell lines of the embryo, which in turn become fully differentiated cells. A single fertilised egg cell, the zygote, <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> many different plant cell types including parenchyma, xylem vessel elements, phloem sieve tubes, guard cells of the epidermis, etc. as it continues to divide. The process results from the epigenetic activation of some genes and inhibition of others.|$|E
5|$|Telopea truncata is one, and {{possibly}} the most distinctive, of five species from southeastern Australia which make up the genus Telopea. It is the earliest offshoot of a lineage that <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Gippsland waratah (T.oreades) and Monga waratah (T.mongaensis) of southeastern mainland Australia. The perianths of T.truncata are of a single shade of red, whereas those of its mainland relatives are coloured with two distinct shades of red—the surfaces facing {{the centre of the}} flower head are a much brighter red than those facing away.|$|E
50|$|According to Donovan et al (1981) the Stephanoceratidae and Otoitdae {{both have}} their {{origin in the}} Hildoceratoidea, in the Phymatoceratidae. <b>The</b> Otoitidae <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sphaeroceratidae which <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Cardioceraticae, <b>the</b> Stephanoceratidae <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Kosmoceratidae, all within the Stephanoceratoidea.

5|$|The common {{blackbird}} is {{the national}} bird of Sweden, which has a breeding population of 1–2 million pairs, and was featured on a 30öre Christmas postage stamp in 1970; it has also featured {{on a number of}} other stamps issued by European and Asian countries, including a 1966 4d British stamp and an 1998 Irish 30p stamp. This bird—arguably—also <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Serbian name for Kosovo, which is the possessive adjectival form of Serbian kos ("blackbird") as in Kosovo Polje ("Blackbird Field").|$|E
5|$|The {{olfactory}} system {{is made up}} in part of the RMS which stretches from the subventricular zone in {{the wall of the}} lateral ventricle, through the basal forebrain, to the olfactory bulb (OB). VONS is the name given to this pathway, and it consists of the subventricular zone, the RMS, the olfactory tract and the olfactory bulb. Developing neurons leave the subventricular zone and enter the RMS and travel caudally and ventrally along the undersurface of the caudate nucleus; this {{is referred to as the}} descending limb. Upon reaching the ventral side of the caudate nucleus, the neurons follow the rostral limb and travel ventrally and rostrally, entering the anterior olfactory cortex (AOC). The AOC <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> olfactory tract, which ends in the olfactory bulb.|$|E
5|$|A {{diffraction}} grating constructed of layers of chitin and air <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> iridescent colours of various butterfly wing scales {{as well as}} to the tail feathers of birds such as the peacock. Hooke and Newton were correct in their claim that the peacock's colours are created by interference, but the structures responsible, being close to the wavelength of light in scale (see micrographs), were smaller than the striated structures they could see with their light microscopes. Another way to produce a {{diffraction grating}} is with tree-shaped arrays of chitin, as in the wing scales of some of the brilliantly coloured tropical Morpho butterflies (see drawing). Yet another variant exists in Parotia lawesii, Lawes's parotia, a bird of paradise. The barbules of the feathers of its brightly coloured breast patch are V-shaped, creating thin-film microstructures that strongly reflect two different colours, bright blue-green and orange-yellow. When the bird moves the colour switches sharply between these two colours, rather than drifting iridescently. During courtship, the male bird systematically makes small movements to attract females, so the structures must have evolved through sexual selection.|$|E

5|$|As {{with many}} Korean rural folk traditions, {{the sport is}} {{regarded}} as a predictor of future events, specifically harvests. The outcome of a ritualised contest between the two sides of a village (East and West) was seen as an indicator of the abundance (or otherwise) of that year's rice crop, which would be harvested in the autumn; as a result, juldarigi and similar folk sports are predominant in the rice-growing areas of the South. This is due to the common association in Southeast Asia between dragons (which the ropes of the juldarigi are thought to resemble) and rain; as a result juldarigi or similar tug-of-war ceremonies have also historically been staged during periods of drought. The connection of the two ropes used (with one rope's smaller loop being placed through the other's larger loop) is reminiscent of sexual intercourse, which also <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sport's association with fecundity.|$|E
5|$|Bacterial {{contamination}} {{alone in}} absence of obstruction does not usually result in cholangitis. However increased pressure within the biliary system (above 20 cmH2O) resulting from obstruction in the bile duct widens {{spaces between the}} cells lining the duct, bringing bacterially contaminated bile {{in contact with the}} blood stream. It also adversely affects the function of Kupffer cells, which are specialized macrophage cells that assist in preventing bacteria from entering the biliary system. Finally, increased biliary pressure decreases production of IgA immunoglobulins in the bile. This results in bacteremia (bacteria in the blood stream) and <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) comprising fever (often with rigors), tachycardia, increased respiratory rate and increased white blood cell count; SIRS in the presence of suspected or confirmed infection is called sepsis. Biliary obstruction itself disadvantages the immune system and impairs its capability to fight infection, by impairing the function of certain immune system cells (neutrophil granulocytes) and modifying the levels of immune hormones (cytokines).|$|E
5|$|String {{theory is}} a {{theoretical}} framework that attempts to reconcile gravity and quantum mechanics. In string theory, the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. String theory describes how strings propagate through space and interact with each other. In a given version of string theory, {{there is only one}} kind of string, which may look like a small loop or segment of ordinary string, and it can vibrate in different ways. On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string will look just like an ordinary particle, with its mass, charge, and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string. In this way, all of the different elementary particles may be viewed as vibrating strings. One of the vibrational states of a string <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> graviton, a quantum mechanical particle that carries gravitational force.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept of}} duality applies {{as well to}} {{infinite}} graphs embedded in the plane {{as it does to}} finite graphs. However, care is needed to avoid topological complications such as points of the plane that are neither part of an open region disjoint from the graph nor part of an edge or vertex of the graph. When all faces are bounded regions surrounded by a cycle of the graph, an infinite planar graph embedding can also be viewed as a tessellation of the plane, a covering of the plane by closed disks (the tiles of the tessellation) whose interiors (the faces of the embedding) are disjoint open disks. Planar duality <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> notion of a dual tessellation, a tessellation formed by placing a vertex at the center of each tile and connecting the centers of adjacent tiles.|$|E
