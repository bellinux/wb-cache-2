25|$|The {{line from}} Sandvika to Oslo was {{substantially}} upgraded between 1917 and 1922. From 27 February 1917 a passing loop was built at Høvik and standard gauge traffic {{was carried out}} on the northern track. A southern track was then built, which was used by narrow gauge trains. However, both were dual gauge. All–standard gauge operations commenced on 9 February 1920, although the dual gauge was not removed until 1922. Electric traction started operation on 30 August 1922. From 1922 station was served <b>every</b> <b>thirty</b> <b>minutes</b> by the Oslo Commuter Rail service between Sandvika Station and Oslo West Station. An interlocking system was installed on 6 October 1924.|$|E
25|$|Commuter {{traffic on}} the Drammen Line {{increased}} substantially and Parliament decided in 1911 to modernize the line from Oslo West Station to Sandvika Station. The entire line was elevated so that roads could pass naturally below the tracks. This made it necessary to demolish the original station building at Skøyen {{and replace it with}} one designed by Eivind Gleditsch of NSB Arkitektkontor. Completed in 1916, it was placed west of the bridge over Drammensveien. Standard gauge traffic ran on the northern track from 27 February 1917. A southern track was then built, which was used by narrow gauge trains. However, both were dual gauge. All operations switched to standard gauge from 9 February 1920, although the dual gauge was not removed until 1922. Electric traction became operations from 30 August 1922. From 1922 the station was served <b>every</b> <b>thirty</b> <b>minutes</b> by the Oslo Commuter Rail service between Sandvika Station and Oslo West Station. An interlocking system was installed on 14 July 1924.|$|E
25|$|Since August 1940, Dönitz {{had ended}} the {{practice}} of U-boats freelancing and sending only one report per day. U-boat commanders were ordered to signal whenever they found a convoy and shadow it rather than attack. The commander was to send short homing signals <b>every</b> <b>thirty</b> <b>minutes,</b> to guide other U-boats to the convoy. When the pack had assembled, Dönitz gave the order to attack, usually at night, so that the U-boats could fire their torpedoes on the surface. For the tactic to work, U-boats had to signal their positions to Dönitz at Kerneval (across the river from Keroman Submarine Base at Lorient in Brittany). Closer to land, when Condors on Fühlungshalter patrol sighted a convoy, the wireless operator reported its position and course to the BdU and relays of Condors remained over the convoy. When {{the position of a}} convoy was established, the information was passed to the senior officer of a group of U-boats organised for pack attacks, who ordered the boat nearest to the convoy to shadow it and guide the rest by wireless. When the pack had rendezvoused near the convoy, surface attacks would be made on successive nights, the U-boats withdrawing during the day. Dönitz assembled wolfpack Seeräuber (Pirate) of six U-boats, (U-67, U-107, U-108, U-131, U-434 and U-574). The pack was reinforced later by three more boats and was given orders to treat Audacity as a prime target.|$|E
25|$|Stamford {{receives}} very frequent rail {{service on}} the New Haven Line. During peak hours, trains at Stamford come in intervals as little as three or seven minutes apart. Reverse commute trains during rush hours also operate relatively frequently, at intervals of ten to twenty minutes. Off-peak trains in both directions arrive at Stamford <b>every</b> <b>thirty</b> to forty <b>minutes,</b> but usually within a half-hour of each other.|$|R
40|$|Frost is {{a natural}} hazard, which may cause {{significant}} damage to agriculture depending also on the phenological stage of the affected crops. In this paper, several features of the frost-affected areas are examined by using digital data of METEOSAT IR images. In particular the areal extent of frost is delineated by using the estimated temperature from the raw satellite data. Moreover, since digital METEOSAT IR images are recorded <b>every</b> <b>thirty</b> (30) <b>minutes,</b> {{it is possible to}} monitor the changes {{in the size of the}} frost-affected areas as well as the fluctuations in frost intensity and severity. The phenomenon is investigated in several regions in Greece...|$|R
50|$|In the late-1990s, WNCT began {{producing}} the market's original prime time newscast on Fox affiliate WFXI/WYDO (then owned by Piedmont Television) through a news share agreement. Known on-air as Fox News at 10, the broadcast {{could be seen}} <b>every</b> night for <b>thirty</b> <b>minutes.</b> Although it featured most of WNCT's on-air team, the show did maintain a separate news anchor. The outsourcing arrangement was terminated in December 2007 after WCTI became a sister station to WFXI/WYDO through their management by the Bonten Media Group.|$|R

5000|$|At {{one point}} in time, KFVS {{produced}} a nightly prime time newscast on WQTV/WQWQ. Known as Heartland News at 9, the show could be seen for a half-hour and was targeted specifically at a Southeastern Missouri audience. It competed with another broadcast in the time slot on Fox affiliate KBSI which also aired <b>every</b> night for <b>thirty</b> <b>minutes.</b> However, that program was produced by NBC affiliate WPSD-TV so it featured more of a regionalized summary of headlines since it originated from the NBC outlet's facility in Kentucky.|$|R
50|$|On September 12, 2005, WCYB began {{producing}} the area's {{first and only}} prime time newscast on WEMT from a secondary set at WCYB's studios. Known as Fox Tri-Cities 10 O'Clock News, it was originally seen <b>every</b> night for <b>thirty</b> <b>minutes.</b> This was expanded to an hour-long format on September 11, 2006. In October 2008, WEMT's newscast dropped WCYB's on-air look. Instead of using all blue graphics, this station now uses blue and red colors. The station also renamed the weather forecast segment and modified many {{other elements of the}} broadcast to distinguish itself from WCYB.|$|R
30|$|In the pay-per-time and the pay-per-data models, {{apart from}} a payment at the {{beginning}} of the session (messages from 1 to 6 in Section 5.5), it is required that a payment is made from time to time (e.g., <b>every</b> <b>thirty</b> seconds, <b>every</b> <b>minute,</b> etc). Thus, the vendor has to control the time/the data sent and requires a payment once the unit of consumption (seconds or bytes) defined is spent. These payments are requested and made by using the additional payment feature (messages from 8 to 11 in Section 5.5).|$|R
2500|$|Night {{and weekend}} service was {{increased}} in 2004 due to growing ridership during these times. Before the 2004 increase in night service, boats only ran once an hour between midnight and 7 a.m. The ferry had not added more trips during nights and weekends even though Staten Island's population had increased since 1990. [...] In November 2006, additional ferries running every 30 minutes were provided {{during the weekend}} morning hours.

2500|$|On 1 February 1872 the London & North Western Railway (L) began {{a railway}} service between [...] and the District Railway station at Mansion House via the North London Railway, , the West London Railway and Earl's Court, {{replacing}} {{a service that}} had run along {{much of the same}} route to London Victoria. This service became known as the 'outer circle' and was worked with L locomotives and carriages and there was a train <b>every</b> <b>thirty</b> <b>minutes.</b> When the District electrified in 1905, it built electric locomotives to haul the carriages between Earl's Court and Mansion House. The service appears on the 1908 'London Underground' map between Earl's Court and Uxbridge Road as a District Railway service.|$|E
50|$|From 1996 until 2000 {{through a}} news share agreement, WSTM-TV {{produced}} a prime time newscast for Fox affiliate WSYT. Known as Fox 68 News at 10, the broadcast {{could be seen}} <b>every</b> night for <b>thirty</b> <b>minutes.</b> After WSTM-TV declined to renew the arrangement, WSYT then partnered with WTVH to keep the broadcasts continuing. Meanwhile, in 2003, WSTM-TV brought back a weeknight prime time news show for newly acquired sister station WSTQ-LP. Although WTVH would terminate its arrangement with WSYT in April 2006, the nightly 10 o'clock broadcasts were WTVH's most successful having soundly beat WSTM-TV's effort on WSTQ-LP.|$|R

25|$|The {{most common}} way of {{childbirth}} is a vaginal delivery. It involves three stages of labour: the shortening and {{opening of the}} cervix, descent and birth of the baby, and the delivery of the placenta. The first stage typically lasts twelve to nineteen hours, the second stage twenty minutes to two hours, and the third stage five to <b>thirty</b> <b>minutes.</b> The first stage begins with crampy abdominal or back pains that last around half a minute and occur <b>every</b> ten to <b>thirty</b> <b>minutes.</b> The crampy pains become stronger and closer together over time. During the second stage pushing with contractions may occur. In the third stage delayed clamping of the umbilical cord is generally recommended. A number of methods can help with pain such as relaxation techniques, opioids, and spinal blocks.|$|R
2500|$|On 13 March, The Wall Street Journal, citing {{sources in}} the US government, {{asserted}} that Rolls-Royce had received an aircraft health report <b>every</b> <b>thirty</b> <b>minutes</b> for five hours, implying that the aircraft had remained aloft for four hours after its transponder went offline; Malaysia denies the report. [...] The Wall Street Journal later amended its report and stated simply that the belief of continued flight was [...] "based on analysis of signals sent by the Boeing 777's satellite-communication link... the link operated {{in a kind of}} standby mode and sought to establish contact with a satellite or satellites. These transmissions did not include data." [...] The following day, satellite operator Inmarsat released a public statement stating that [...] "routine, automated signals were registered" [...] on its network; analysis of these [...] "keep-alive message" [...] that continued to be sent after air traffic control first lost contact could help pinpoint the aircraft's location.|$|E
2500|$|British gunnery control systems, {{based on}} Dreyer tables, were {{well in advance}} of the German ones, as {{demonstrated}} by the proportion of main calibre hits made on the German fleet. Because of its demonstrated advantages, it was installed on ships progressively as the war went on, had been fitted to a majority of British capital ships by May, 1916, and had been installed on the main guns of all but two of the Grand Fleet's capital ships. The Royal Navy used centralised fire-control systems on their capital ships, directed from a point high up on the ship where the fall of shells could best be seen, utilising a director sight for both training and elevating the guns. In contrast, the German battlecruisers controlled the fire of turrets using a training-only director, which also did not fire the guns at once. The rest of the German capital ships were without even this innovation. German range-finding equipment was generally superior to the British [...] FT24, as its operators were trained to a higher standard due to the complexity of the Zeiss [...] range finders. Their stereoscopic design meant that in certain conditions they could range on a target enshrouded by smoke. The German equipment was not superior in range to the British Barr & Stroud [...] rangefinder found in the newest British capital ships, and, unlike the British range finders, the German range takers had to be replaced as often as <b>every</b> <b>thirty</b> <b>minutes,</b> as their eyesight became impaired, affecting the ranges provided to their gunnery equipment.|$|E

50|$|From 1996 until 2000 {{through a}} news share agreement, NBC {{affiliate}} WSTM-TV produced a prime time newscast on WSYT. Known as Fox 68 News at 10, the broadcast {{could be seen}} <b>every</b> night for <b>thirty</b> <b>minutes.</b> After WSTM-TV declined to renew the arrangement, WSYT then established a new outsourcing agreement with CBS outlet WTVH. As a result, a new nightly news program began airing on this station that was known as Fox 68 Eyewitness News at 10. Eventually, an hour-long weekday morning show (also produced by WTVH) debuted and was called Fox 68 Eyewitness News at 7. Both of the programs featured the same branding as WTVH's newscasts did at the time.|$|R
5000|$|The {{programme}} ran {{for nine}} series, from 12 January 1992 to 4 August 2002. Nearly <b>every</b> episode was <b>thirty</b> <b>minutes</b> long. The final series episode {{was followed by}} an hour-long compilation show on 11 August 2002, and by a two part [...] "Reunion Special" [...] broadcast on 26 and 30 December 2005. The reunion specials were the last appearance of Frank Middlemass, who played Rocky, {{before his death in}} 2006. Actress Joan Sims died in 2001 and the role of Rocky's wife, Madge Darbley-Hardcastle, was not recast; in Series Eight it is mentioned that she was away participating in an Egyptian archaeological dig, and various excuses were used until the series ended.|$|R
5000|$|After Raycom {{acquired}} WSTQ-LP, WSTM-TV began {{producing a}} half-hour prime time newscast called Action News at 10 on UPN 6 which competed with Fox 68 Eyewitness News at 10 seen on WSYT. That program, produced by WTVH, was seen <b>every</b> night for <b>thirty</b> <b>minutes</b> unlike WSTQ-LP's show {{which was only}} aired on weeknights. Action News at 10 would eventually be expanded to a seven night operation on January 8, 2005. In April 2006, WTVH ceased producing all local news programming for WSYT in order to focus on its own newscasts that were cemented in third place by this point. Ironically, the 10 o'clock broadcasts on WSYT were WTVH's most successful having soundly beat WSTM-TV's effort on WSTQ-LP in the ratings.|$|R

50|$|Compared {{to other}} whales, the {{humpback}} whale has extremely long flippers which reach up to 30 {{percent of its}} length of up to 40 ft. At their full grown length they can reach up to 55 feet long, and weighs about one ton for every square foot. The whale appears dark from the top while its flippers and tail, the sides and underside appear partially white and are noticeable when they are beginning dive as are their small dorsal fins. These white markings on their flukes are completely unique, each working as a personal fingerprint that scientists use to identify them. These whales are air breathers, rising to the surface <b>every</b> <b>thirty</b> or so <b>minutes.</b> Their exhale can rise up to 15 feet into the air, clocking at a speed of 300 mph(the human sneeze at its fastest is about 100 mph).|$|R

Tri-Rail added several more trains during peak weekday commuting hours in June 2007, increasing to the current 50 trains per day, as well as increasing weekend service. During [...] "rush-hour," [...] trains ran <b>every</b> twenty to <b>thirty</b> <b>minutes</b> rather than the previous schedule of every hour.

Over 4.2million passengers rode the line in 2009, a record number for the year. This was also the time during which work was being done on I-95 to add the express lanes from the Golden Glades Interchange to the Airport Expressway near downtown Miami.|$|R
