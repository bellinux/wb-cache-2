[...] "In just over 29 minutes, Bookends <b>is</b> <b>stunning</b> in its {{vision of a}} bewildered America in search of itself", said AllMusic writer Thom Jurek, who gave it five stars out of five. Pitchfork Media's Stephen M. Deusner called Bookends the moment in which the duo [...] "were {{settling}} into themselves, losing their folk revival pretensions and emphasizing quirky production techniques to match their soaring vocals". The A.V. Club called it the group's [...] "most musically and conceptually daring album".|$|E
500|$|Upon the Japanese release, {{the critic}} writing for The Japan Times reflected: [...] "If Lost in Translation is the film you'd make when {{all you know}} about Japan are the pampered press junkets at Shinjuku 5-star hotels, then Enter the Void is what you would make if you never got beyond the Roppongi pub-crawl." [...] While the review was largely negative, the author was still {{impressed}} by the visual depiction of the Japanese capital: [...] "Visually, much of the film <b>is</b> <b>stunning</b> ... and the art design by Marc Caro (Delicatessen) takes Tokyo's love of neon gaudiness to a surreal extreme".|$|E

BBC News film critic Jane Crowther said that [...] "Cruz is wonderfully ditzy as the innocent abroad" [...] but remarked that [...] "it's Harold Perrineau Jr as Monica who pockets the movie".

[...] Also in 2000, she played Alejandra Villarreal, who is Matt Damon's love interest in Billy Bob Thornton's film adaptation of the western bestselling novel, All the Pretty Horses. Susan Stark of the Detroit News commented that in the film Thornton was able to guide Damon, Henry Thomas and Cruz to [...] "their most impressive performances in a major movie yet".

500|$|Wainwright {{attended}} McGill University in Montreal for a {{short time}} to study Classical music composition. With his mother's support, he began writing pop songs and learned how to play guitar. Wainwright started performing at the night club Sarajevo, and eventually recorded a demo tape with record producer Pierre Marchand, a family friend, who had worked with Kate and Anna and who later produced Wainwright's second studio album Poses. Songs were recorded at Marchand's studio in Morin-Heights, Quebec, and no edits were made to the simple live tunes. The tape impressed Wainwright's father, who passed the songs along to producer Van Dyke Parks, who in turn presented them to DreamWorks executive Lenny Waronker. Waronker had signed McGarrigle to Warner Bros. Records in the 1970s. Describing his initial reaction to Wainwright's music, Waronker stated: [...] "When I was about to listen to his tape, I remember clearly I was thinking, 'Gee, if he has the mom's musicality and smarts, and the dad's smarts and voice, that'd be nice.' Then I put it on and I said, 'Oh, my God, this <b>is</b> <b>stunning.</b> Wainwright acknowledged that having musicians as parents gave him a [...] "foot in the door", but attributed his success to hard work.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are mixed}} {{impressions}} about Van Gogh's weavers.

It <b>is</b> <b>stunning</b> how much Bibi’s actions serve Tehran’s strategic interests." ...|$|E

[...] The review stated that [...] "Anthony Ward's harmoniously curved set, in which the sky seems to stretch into eternity, again pulses {{with the promise of}} a land on the verge of transformation." [...] The New York Daily News review commented that [...] "Visually, this one <b>is</b> <b>stunning</b> – at times, Anthony Ward's sets have a pastoral, idyllic quality, like Thomas Hart Benton's paintings. At other times, especially in lighting designer David Hersey's lustrous palette, they convey the bleakness of the frontier." [...] The review also stated that the Royal National Theatre [...] "brought it back to us {{in a way that makes}} it seem fresh and vital." [...] However, USA Today gave the production a tepid assessment, its reviewer writing that [...] "A cold breeze blows through this beautiful mornin', and that golden haze is never quite bright enough."

2500|$|In 2005, Bartlett's book The Pathology of Man: A Study of Human Evil was published. The 200,000-word study {{applies the}} science of {{pathology}} to the human species {{in order to identify}} and describe many dispositionally-based pathologies that afflict our species, often without our awareness. A central purpose of the book is to bring together and discuss the work of twentieth century psychologists, psychiatrists, ethologists, psychologically-focused historians, and others who have studied the underlying psychology of human aggression and destructiveness. The conclusions of the study emphasize that human pathology has many originating factors, that people obtain varied cognitive and emotional gratifications from such pathology, and that human pathology is a normal human condition and is therefore generally intractable, at least at this stage of human development. Bartlett describes how deficits in what he defines as moral intelligence combine with the psychology of stupidity, which together form major contributors to the psychological shortcomings that result in human pathology. In critical responses to the book, the study was commended by The Journal of Analytical Psychology: [...] "Bartlett is a lucid, painstaking and illuminating writer. This is certainly a classic work of reference in the field." [...] The Bulletin of the Menninger Clinic appraised the book as [...] "a challenging and thought provoking approach that makes a significant contribution to an aspect of human psychopathology that is rarely or so comprehensively addressed." [...] About the book, M. Scott Peck commented: [...] "he study of evil is just beginning and you are a pioneer." [...] Eric Zillmer, Carl R. Pacifico Professor of Neuropsychology at Drexel University, commended the book: [...] "Steven James Bartlett's The Pathology of Man marks the most comprehensive examination of evil to date. Drawing from different fields of study, including psychology and epistemology, Bartlett sets out on a Tour de Force of delineating the parameters on human evil.... The resulting text is a most welcome addition to the field and provides for fascinating reading. The Pathology of Man is a timely, scholarly, and important piece of work that should appeal to anyone who is interested in understanding human evil." [...] Author and President of the Jewish Life Network Irving Greenberg commented: [...] "This book <b>is</b> <b>stunning,</b> upsetting, gripping.... he book is a moral act of the highest order. These...comments would be incomplete without mentioning the erudition, the intellectual insight and playfulness, the gallows humor and the self-restraint which deepen and lighten this book." [...] Since the publication of The Pathology of Man, Bartlett has published a series of further books and papers related to the same and related subjects.|$|E
