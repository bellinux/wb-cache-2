5000|$|The {{main issue}} in this appeal was {{whether or not the}} Children's Foundation should be <b>held</b> {{vicariously}} <b>liable</b> <b>for</b> the actions of its employee.

40|$|Junior {{doctors in}} most provinces in South Africa are {{compelled}} to work 30 -hour shifts without a break. Shifts in excess of 24 hours can result in serious bodily harm to patients, third parties and the doctors themselves. These risks have been drawn {{to the attention of}} the health authorities but the 30 -hour policy continues to be implemented in all provinces, except recently in the Western Cape. Public health officials may be <b>held</b> directly <b>liable</b> <b>for</b> the harm caused to patients, third parties or the junior doctors themselves, if it can be shown that they are at fault and are acting unlawfully in violation of the Constitution. Where officials carry out the unlawful orders of senior officials, including the minister of health and provincial members of the executive council (MECs) for health, they may not raise the defence of ‘obedience to orders’ and may be <b>held</b> directly <b>liable</b> <b>for</b> harm caused. Superior officials issuing such orders will also be <b>held</b> directly <b>liable</b> <b>for</b> harm caused...|$|R

25|$|As {{a result}} of this criticism, in the 1890s, state courts around the country adopted Rylands v.

State courts' adoption of Rylands, which held that a non-negligent defendant could be <b>held</b> <b>liable</b> <b>for</b> damage caused by the unnatural use of land, foreshadowed the legal system's 20th-century acceptance of strict liability.|$|E

25|$|Similarly, in many {{countries}} in jurisprudence, the defence of infancy {{is a form of}} defence by which a defendant argues that, at the time a law was broken, they were not liable for their actions and thus should not be <b>held</b> <b>liable</b> <b>for</b> a crime. Many courts recognise that defendants who are considered to be juveniles may avoid criminal prosecution on account of their age and in borderline cases the age of the offender is often held to be a mitigating circumstance.|$|E

The only sort of prosecution allowed for a sitting President is that of high treason, which can only be carried out by the Senate, and can only result in removal from office and a ban on regaining the office at a later date.|$|E
25|$|On August 7, 2013, Carmack joined Oculus VR {{as their}} CTO. On November 22, 2013, he {{resigned}} from id Software to work full-time at Oculus VR. Carmack's reason for leaving was because id's parent company ZeniMax Media didn't {{want to support}} Oculus Rift. Carmack's role at both companies later became central to a ZeniMax lawsuit against Oculus parent company Facebook, claiming that Oculus stole ZeniMax's virtual reality intellectual property. The trial jury absolved Carmack of liability, though Oculus and other corporate officers were <b>held</b> <b>liable</b> <b>for</b> trademark, copyright, and contract violations. In February 2017 Carmack sued ZeniMax, claiming the company had refused to pay him the remaining $22.5 million owed him from their purchase of id Software.|$|E

The Government had required {{the return of the}} three C-130As provided to T or a payment of US$2.4 million plus interest, and the court invalidated this request based on existing law (40 USC 544) which states that if a Bill of Sale is provided, that is evidence that the transaction meets all regulatory requirements. In thus ruling, the court determined that despite the transactions being illegal from the Forest Service's perspective, the purchasers could not be <b>held</b> <b>liable</b> <b>for</b> the agency's improper activities.|$|E
