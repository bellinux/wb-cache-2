5|$|The {{line through}} Worle is not <b>electrified,</b> {{but there is}} {{significant}} local support {{for it to be}} <b>electrified</b> as part of the 21st-century modernisation of the Great Western Main Line, partly motivated by worries that unless the line is <b>electrified,</b> Weston-super-Mare will lose direct services to London.|$|E
5|$|The {{western part}} of the Stadtbahn was <b>electrified</b> on 4 July 1993 up to Zoologischer Garten station. The eastern part of the line up to Ostbahnhof had been <b>electrified</b> since 1987. As soon as {{electrification}} reached the Zoo station, ICE trains began to use the station.|$|E
5|$|In the post-War years, translucent, molded plastic, <b>electrified,</b> lit-from-within tree toppers in {{the shape}} of angels and stars became popular. Although Santa Claus and other Christmas icons were {{introduced}} as <b>electrified</b> toppers, the star and the angel of the Victorian era remained the preferred motif. Glass spire ornaments were also popular as toppers.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the decade}} 2002–2012, {{passenger}} numbers at Filton Abbey Wood almost doubled, from 395,000 to 771,000. In the 2006/07 financial year, over 50,000 passengers used Filton Abbey Wood {{to travel to}} or from Bristol Temple Meads. The line through Filton Abbey Wood has a loading gauge of W8, and the line handles over 15 million train tonnes per year. It is not <b>electrified,</b> though it is planned {{that it will be}} <b>electrified</b> as part of the 21st-century modernisation of the Great Western Main Line.|$|E
5|$|The LNWR began {{construction}} {{work on the}} surface section of the new tracks in 1909. By 1911, it had modified the plans to omit the underground section and to split its proposed <b>electrified</b> services into three. The first section was to follow the existing surface route into Euston on newly <b>electrified</b> tracks, the second section was {{to connect with the}} North London Railway at Chalk Farm and continue on <b>electrified</b> tracks from there to Broad Street station in the City of London. The third section involved the extension of the Bakerloo Tube from Paddington to Queen's Park.|$|E
5|$|Victoria's first railway was a 4km Victorian {{broad gauge}} {{line between the}} Melbourne (or City) Terminus (on the site of modern-day Flinders Street station) and Sandridge (now Port Melbourne), {{constructed}} by the Melbourne and Hobson's Bay Railway Company and opened in September 1854. Today, Melbourne's suburban railway network consists of 16 <b>electrified</b> lines, the central City Loop subway, and 200 stations, with a total length of 372km of the <b>electrified</b> lines, operated by Metro Trains Melbourne under franchise to the Government of Victoria.|$|E

However, in July 2009, the Department of Transport under the then Labour Government (in the run-up to the 2010 general election), announced {{that there would be a}} £1bn programme to <b>electrify</b> the whole of the Great Western from London to Swansea as well as to Bristol. The Labour government claimed that the investment would pay for itself over a 40-year period.|$|R

5|$|A fully <b>electrified</b> and double-tracked line, the Trans-Siberian Railway line {{is capable}} of {{transporting}} around 100 million tons of freight annually. The line can handle up to 200,000 TEU of containerized international transit freight per year.|$|E
5|$|After the Met and the District had {{withdrawn}} from the ELR in 1906, services were provided by the South Eastern Railway, the London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway (LB) and the Great Eastern Railway. Both the Met and the District {{wanted to see the}} line <b>electrified,</b> but could not justify the whole cost themselves. Discussions continued, and in 1911 it was agreed that the ELR would be <b>electrified</b> with the UERL providing power and the Met the train service. Parliamentary powers were obtained in 1912 and through services restarted on 31 March 1913, the Met running two trains an hour from both the SER's and the LB's New Cross stations to South Kensington and eight shuttles an hour alternately from the New Cross stations to Shoreditch.|$|E
5|$|After the {{formation}} of the London Passenger Transport Board in 1933, work to electrify the line from Liverpool Street to Shenfield began in association with the LNER. Progress had been halted by the war but work resumed after the end of hostilities. The line between Liverpool Street and Stratford was <b>electrified</b> from 3 December 1946, and the full electrification of the Shenfield line at 1500V DC was completed by late 1949. At the same time electrification of London Underground services in Essex and northeast and east London led to the withdrawal of some services from Liverpool Street, being replaced with LU operations. Electrification continued with the line to Chingford <b>electrified</b> by November 1960.|$|E

5|$|During the 1940s, NSB <b>electrified</b> the Sørland Line, {{although}} {{the final section}} from Egersund to Stavanger was not converted until 1956. In 1957, the Kirkenes–Bjørnevatn Line became the only line to remove the electrification and replace the electric locomotives with diesel power. The 1950s saw the electrification of several regional and commuter lines around Oslo, including the Kongsvinger Line, the Trunk Line and the Dovre Line from Lillestrøm to Hamar, the Vestfold Line and the Eastern Østfold Line. This was largely due to NSB's program to remove all steam locomotives, either by electrification or by dieselization. In the late 1950s and 1960s, several to-be <b>electrified</b> lines were operated with diesel locomotives as an interim solution. The 1960s saw the remaining two steam lines in Southern Norway, the Bergen and Dovre Lines, <b>electrified</b> along with the Gjøvik Line. The Bergen Line was completed in 1964 and the Dovre Line completed in 1970. This finished all the planned electrifications, and the authorities deemed the remaining lines unprofitable to electrify because of low traffic. During the 1990s, a new program was attempted, this time to electrify the entire network, but only the Arendal Line was converted before the program was canceled. However, new lines around Oslo, including the Lieråsen and Oslo Tunnels on the Drammen Line, and the Gardermoen and Asker Lines were <b>electrified</b> {{at the time they}} opened. Further plans have been launched, in particular the section of the Nordland Line from Trondheim to Steinkjer, {{which is part of the}} Trøndelag Commuter Rail, and the Meråker Line, which connects to the <b>electrified</b> Central Line in Sweden.|$|E
5|$|Electric {{locomotives}} {{were first}} acquired with the electrification {{of the suburban}} railways, the E class suburban engines acquired in 1923 and 1928–29, followed by the L class from 1953 when the mainline to Traralgon was <b>electrified</b> for briquette traffic.|$|E

5|$|From 1936, NSB took {{delivery}} of Class 65 multiple units, replacing El 1 {{as the primary}} hauler on the <b>electrified</b> commuter rail network. Class 65 were the first that were optimized for local traffic, with wide doors and turnable seats. NSB took {{delivery of}} 49 units until 1952, although they were also used outside the commuter rail network. The Østfold Line was upgraded to double track and put into service in four sections: from Bekkelaget to Ljan on 1 June 1924, from OsloØ to Bekkelaget on 15 May 1929, from Ljan to Kolbotn on 15 December 1936 and from Kolbotn to Ski on 14 May 1939. The Østfold Line was also the next line to be <b>electrified,</b> which opened in sections between 1936 and 1940. NSB took into use El 8 locomotives on the line.|$|E
5|$|In 1902 the Whitechapel & Bow Railway was opened, {{linking the}} District Railway at Whitechapel to the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway (LT) at an {{above-ground}} junction at Bow, {{to the west}} of Bromley-by-Bow station, and some District services were extended from Whitechapel to East Ham. When the line was <b>electrified</b> in 1906 services to Richmond were withdrawn and the western termini became Hammersmith and Kensington (Addison Road), and to the east services were diverted from the ELR to Whitechapel, until the ELR was <b>electrified</b> in 1914 and services ran from Hammersmith to New Cross (SER) and New Cross (LB). The 6-car electric multiple units were jointly owned by the Met and GWR until 1923 when the GWR sold theirs to the Met.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, the {{decision}} was taken to electrify the railway using power generated from the hospital's own power plant, which was also connected to the National Grid. The line was <b>electrified</b> at 500V DC using a single overhead line.|$|E

5|$|On 15 June 1953, the Trunk Line from Lillestrøm to Eidsvoll took {{electrification}} into use. Further upgrades on the Drammen Line installing {{double track}} {{were put into}} service on 24 July 1953 from Billingstad to Hvalstad, on 29 November 1955 from Hvalstad to Asker and on 9 November 1958 from Sandvika to Billingstad. Between 1953 and 1955, NSB took delivery of 18 Class 67 multiple units. While visually similar to Class 65, they had improved technology and reliability. On 1 February 1961, the Gjøvik Line from OsloØ to Tøyen was put into service with double track and the line from OsloØ to Jaren put into service as <b>electrified.</b> Double track from Tøyen to Grefsen opened on 27 May 1962 and the sections from Jaren to Gjøvik was <b>electrified</b> in 1963.|$|E
