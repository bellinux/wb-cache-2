The catcher typically calls for pitches using hand signals. The calls {{are based on the}} pitcher's mechanics and strengths, as well as the batter's tendencies and weaknesses. Foul tips, bouncing balls in the dirt, and contact with runners during plays at the plate are all events to be handled by the catcher, necessitating the use of protective equipment. This includes a mask, chest and throat protectors, shin guards, and a heavily padded catcher's mitt.|$|E
25|$|The shootings {{took place}} {{in an area that}} is {{strongly}} republican with a notable IRA tradition and presence; accordingly, the locals were suspicious of strangers or unusual activity. Moreover, the lack of roadblocks following the emergency call which had allowed the gunmen to flee in the getaway car through winding country backroads that were difficult to access and exit if one was not familiar with them led journalist Peter Taylor to allege that the UVF unit probably received help from the security forces. Taylor suggested that the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) was the authority <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> have known the exact movements of the IRA volunteers and to have passed-on the relevant information to the UVF hit squad.

Budget cuts, however, have affected placement of public school counselors in Canada, Ireland, the United States, and other countries due to the global recession in recent years. In the United States, rural areas and urban areas traditionally have been under-served by school counselors in public schools due to both funding shortages and often a lack of best practice models. With the advent of No Child Left Behind legislation in the USA and a mandate for school counselors to be working with data and showing evidence-based practice, school counselors able to show and share results in assisting to close gaps are <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> argue for increased school counseling resources and positions for their programs (Hatch & Bowers, 2003, 2005; ASCA, 2012).|$|E

2500|$|Being [...] "out of his ground" [...] {{is defined}} as not having {{any part of the}} batsman's body or his bat {{touching}} the ground behind the crease – i.e., if his bat is slightly elevated from the floor despite being behind the crease, or if his foot is on the crease line itself but not completely across it and touching the ground behind it, then he would be considered out (if stumped). One of the fielding team (such as the wicket-keeper himself) must appeal for the wicket by asking the umpire.

2500|$|The rack, {{like other}} {{intermediate}} gaits, is smoother than the trot because the hooves hitting the ground individually rather in pairs minimizes {{the force and}} bounce the horse transmits to the rider. [...] To achieve this gait the horse must be in a [...] "hollow position". This means that, instead of a rounded back as seen in dressage horses and others that work off their hind quarters, the spine is curved somewhat downward. [...] This puts the racking horse <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> rack without breaking into another gait. If the rider sits back or leans slightly back, this will encourage the hollow position. This allows the hind legs to trail and makes the rack easier for the horse. [...] The downside {{of this is that}} this position weakens the back and makes the horse less able to carry the weight of the rider without strain.|$|E
2500|$|Innovation in the {{construction}} business also included a definite commitment to finish the building on time. Hitherto the financial risk of delays were assumed by the clients.

[...] It is noteworthy that Kreuger & Toll's entire capital would have covered just two days of being late. The client, in turn, agreed to pay a bonus for every day the building was finished before the due date. Kreuger & Toll finished early and subsequently earned completion bonuses for every project.

2500|$|Early in August 1939 [...] {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} addressing his ideas to the various army chiefs of staff by themselves, in other words without their Commander-in-Chief, at the Berghof.

Hitler no doubt considered Wietersheim's disagreements with him as a kind of treason: in 1946 Manstein told the Nuremberg tribunal that after the August 1938 incident Hitler no longer allowed the military to directly question any of his decisions.|$|E
2500|$|On 4 February 1937 Göring invited Raeder to {{a private}} conference which the later accepted.

The results of the conference and conflict were summed up by the Defence Ministry. The supreme commander Werner von Blomberg ordered that aviation units in support of naval operations was {{the domain of the}} Luftwaffe but under Kriegsmarine control. It did not resolve the question of which service should be responsible for aerial operations at sea. After the naval staff complained again at the absence of a resolution on 10 March a new conference was organised with Albert Kesselring, Chief of the General Staff, and Göring on 1 April and 10 May with the same result. Göring attacked Blomberg's and Raeder's views and thus decided that air units should only be put at the disposal of the navy during specific operations. Perhaps exasperated and defeated, Raeder noted on 20 May 1937, [...] "Commander in Chief, Navy has decided that the demand of command by the Navy over all Naval Air units shall not be voiced." [...] Raeder noted that Göring did not accept that the navy should have control of air units, and likely never would.|$|E

This order was borne to Sherman by a messenger, who paddled down the Tennessee in a canoe and floated over Muscle Shoals; it was delivered at Iuka on the 27th. In this Sherman was notified that the rebels were moving a force towards Cleveland, East Tennessee, and might be going to Nashville, in which event his troops were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> beat them there.

But an Opposition that day after day exposes the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Prime Minister to a rain of questions and cross-questions, the only object of which, or an important object of which, is to promote a feeling of insecurity, involving demands for new expenditure of an almost indefinite character, those who, like the right hon.

6000|$|Now it {{is clear}} that the larger portion, if not the whole, of these plants must have reached New Zealand from Australia (or in a few cases Australia from New Zealand), by {{transmission}} across the sea, because we know there has been no actual land connection during the Tertiary period, as proved by the absence of all the Australian mammalia, and almost all the most characteristic Australian birds, insects, and plants. The form of the sea-bed shows that the distance could not have been less than 600 miles, even during the greatest extension of Southern New Zealand and Tasmania; and we have no reason to suppose it to have been less, because in other cases an equally abundant flora of identical species has reached islands at a still greater distance--notably in the case of the Azores and Bermuda. The character of the plants is also just what we should expect: for about two-thirds of them belong to genera of world-wide range in the temperate zones, such as Ranunculus, Drosera, Epilobium, Gnaphalium, Senecio, Convolvulus, Atriplex, Luzula, and many sedges and grasses, whose exceptionally wide distribution shows that they possess exceptional powers of dispersal and vigour of constitution, enabling them not only to reach distant countries, but also to establish themselves there. Another set of plants belong to especially Antarctic or south temperate groups, such as Colobanthus, Acæna, Gaultheria, Pernettya, and Muhlenbeckia, and these may in some cases have reached both Australia and New Zealand from some now submerged Antarctic island. Again, about one-fourth of the whole are alpine plants, and these possess two advantages as colonisers. Their lofty stations place them <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> have their seeds carried away by winds; and they would in this case reach a country which, having derived the earlier portion of its flora from the side of the tropics, would be likely to have its higher mountains and favourable alpine stations to a great extent unoccupied, or occupied by plants unable to compete with specially adapted alpine groups. {504} ...|$|E
