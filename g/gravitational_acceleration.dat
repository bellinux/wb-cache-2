5|$|Analysis of the {{spectrum}} can also reveal the surface gravity of the star. This is usually expressed as log g, the base-10 logarithm of the <b>gravitational</b> <b>acceleration</b> given in CGS units, in this case, cm/s². Beta Pictoris has logg=4.15, implying a surface gravity of 140 m/s², which is {{about half of the}} <b>gravitational</b> <b>acceleration</b> at the surface of the Sun (274m/s²).|$|E
5|$|The Kibble balance {{requires}} extremely {{precise measurement}} of the local <b>gravitational</b> <b>acceleration</b> g in the laboratory, using a gravimeter. For instance, the NIST compensates for Earth's gravity gradient of 309µGal per metre when the elevation {{of the center of}} the gravimeter differs from that of the nearby test mass in the Kibble balance; a change in the weight of a one-kilogram test mass that equates to about 316µg/m.|$|E
5|$|The local <b>gravitational</b> <b>acceleration</b> at {{the poles}} {{is greater than}} at the equator, so, by the Von Zeipel theorem, the local {{luminosity}} is also higher at the poles. This {{is seen as a}} variation in effective temperature over the star: the polar temperature is near 10,000K, while the equatorial temperature is 7,600K. As a result, if Vega were viewed along the plane of its equator, then the luminosity would be about half the apparent luminosity as viewed from the pole. This large temperature difference between the poles and the equator produces a strong 'gravity darkening' effect. As viewed from the poles, this results in a darker (lower intensity) limb than would normally be expected for a spherically symmetric star. The temperature gradient may also mean Vega has a convection zone around the equator, while the remainder of the atmosphere is likely to be in almost pure radiative equilibrium.|$|E
50|$|The above {{scaling law}} states that if lengths {{in the model}} are reduced by some factor, n, then <b>gravitational</b> <b>accelerations</b> must be {{increased}} by the same factor, n {{in order to preserve}} equal stresses in model and prototype.|$|R
25|$|When all densities are {{multiplied by}} 4, and all sizes are halved, orbits are similar; masses are divided by 2, {{gravitational}} forces {{are the same}}, <b>gravitational</b> <b>accelerations</b> are doubled. Hence velocities are the same and orbital periods are halved.|$|R
50|$|The physics modeled {{included}} the mutual Newtonian <b>gravitational</b> <b>accelerations</b> and their relativistic corrections (a modified {{form of the}} Einstein-Infeld-Hoffmann equation), the accelerations caused by the tidal distortion of the Earth, the accelerations caused by {{the figure of the}} Earth and Moon, and a model of the lunar librations.|$|R
25|$|<b>Gravitational</b> <b>acceleration,</b> g(z), {{decreases}} with altitude {{since moving}} up means {{moving away from}} the planet's center.|$|E
25|$|The <b>gravitational</b> <b>acceleration</b> {{varies from}} place to place. Sometimes, it is simply taken to have a {{standard}} value of , which gives the standard weight.|$|E
25|$|As a consequence, for example, {{within a}} shell of uniform {{thickness}} and density there is no net <b>gravitational</b> <b>acceleration</b> anywhere within the hollow sphere.|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} it is {{possible}} to produce strong <b>gravitational</b> <b>accelerations</b> on the free electrons of a conductor in order to obtain electrical current. This allows the conversion of gravitational energy directly into electrical energy. Here, we propose a system that can produce several tens of kilowatts of electrical energy converted from the gravitational energy...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{analyze the}} {{development}} of a collisional granular flow without <b>gravitational</b> <b>accelerations</b> in a shear cell shaped as a racetrack. Variations of the cross-sectional averaged solid volume fraction, mean velocity and fluctuation energy along the straight region of the cell are captured by an integral technique similar to the treatment of boundary layers. The results compare well with data from molecular dynamical simulations of the cell. The theory captures the role of side walls and streamwise temperature variations on the flow development...|$|R
25|$|Scaling of {{distances}} (including {{sizes of}} bodies, {{while keeping the}} densities the same) gives similar orbits without scaling the time: if for example distances are halved, masses are divided by 8, gravitational forces by 16 and <b>gravitational</b> <b>accelerations</b> by 2. Hence velocities are halved and orbital periods remain the same. Similarly, when an object is dropped from a tower, {{the time it takes}} to fall to the ground remains the same with a scale model of the tower on a scale model of the Earth.|$|R
25|$|Modern work on {{gravitational}} theory {{began with}} the work of Galileo Galilei in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. In his famous (though possibly apocryphal) experiment dropping balls from the Tower of Pisa, and later with careful measurements of balls rolling down inclines, Galileo showed that <b>gravitational</b> <b>acceleration</b> is the same for all objects. This was a major departure from Aristotle's belief that heavier objects have a higher <b>gravitational</b> <b>acceleration.</b> Galileo postulated air resistance as the reason that objects with less mass may fall slower in an atmosphere. Galileo's work {{set the stage for the}} formulation of Newton's theory of gravity.|$|E
25|$|The {{gravitational}} field is a vector field {{that describes the}} gravitational force which would be applied on an object in any given point in space, per unit mass. It is actually equal to the <b>gravitational</b> <b>acceleration</b> at that point.|$|E
25|$|The {{gravitational}} field g (also called <b>gravitational</b> <b>acceleration)</b> is a vector field – a vector at each point of space (and time). It is defined {{so that the}} gravitational force experienced by a particle {{is equal to the}} mass of the particle multiplied by the {{gravitational field}} at that point.|$|E
25|$|The {{table below shows}} {{comparative}} <b>gravitational</b> <b>accelerations</b> at {{the surface}} of the Sun, the Earth's moon, each of the planets in the solar system. The “surface” is taken to mean the cloud tops of the gas giants (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune). For the Sun, the surface is taken to mean the photosphere. The values in the table have not been de-rated for the centrifugal effect of planet rotation (and cloud-top wind speeds for the gas giants) and therefore, generally speaking, are similar to the actual gravity that would be experienced near the poles.|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{development}} of a gas-solid flow in an axisymmetric shear cell without <b>gravitational</b> <b>accelerations.</b> A gas pressure gradient imposed on the cell induces a relative motion between the two phases, while the differential rotation of the cell boundaries allows the independent control of the solids agitation. We model variations of the cross-sectional averaged solid volume fraction, mean velocity and fluctuation energy along the cell using a technique similar to the integral treatment of a boundary layer. The theory finds a condition for which fully-developed flows can be achieved in regions of the cell...|$|R

25|$|The high {{accelerations}} that rockets naturally possess {{means that}} rocket vehicles are often capable of vertical takeoff, {{and in some}} cases, with suitable guidance {{and control of the}} engines, also vertical landing. For these operations to be done it is necessary for a vehicle's engines to provide more than the local <b>gravitational</b> <b>acceleration.</b>|$|E
25|$|Three {{integrating}} accelerometers {{measured the}} three components of velocity resulting from vehicle propulsion. The accelerometer measurements were sent through the launch vehicle data adapter (LDVA at location 19) to the LVDC. In the LVDC the accelerometer measurements were {{combined with the}} computed <b>gravitational</b> <b>acceleration</b> to obtain velocity and position of the vehicle.|$|E
25|$|Most often, {{the known}} wave {{parameters}} are the wave height H, mean water depth h, <b>gravitational</b> <b>acceleration</b> g, and either the wavelength λ {{or else the}} period τ. Then the above relations for λ, c and τ are used to find the elliptic parameter m. This requires numerical solution by some iterative method.|$|E
30|$|The GPS {{receiver}} is {{used for}} precise positioning and provides the accurate time reference for the magnetometer measurements. The data on {{the motion of the}} satellites from the GPS receivers can also be used for estimating the accelerations acting on the satellites (van den IJssel and Visser 2007), while minimizing the difference between the GPS tracking data and the predicted orbital motion, based on both modeled and estimated accelerations. If an accurate model is used to represent <b>gravitational</b> <b>accelerations</b> in this estimation procedure, the non-gravitational accelerations, due to satellite aerodynamics and radiation pressure, can be estimated in isolation.|$|R
40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{model for the}} downward spread of a flame in the gas over a semi-infinitely thick fuel bed is presented. Gas-phase chemistry is assumed to proceed at an infinite rate while the fuel bed is taken to pyrolyze at the surface in an Arrhenius fashion. Spread rates and flame shapes are computed for two different ambient oxygen concentrations for <b>gravitational</b> <b>accelerations</b> both below and above that of the earth. Predicted spread rates decrease and actual flame size increases with decreasing gravity. Results agree favorably with available, experimental results and expected results from reduced gravity experimentation...|$|R
40|$|Instabilities {{occurring}} {{during the}} directional constant-rate solidification of a dilute solution of tin in lead are investigated {{as a function}} of gravity with particular emphasis on small constant <b>gravitational</b> <b>accelerations.</b> Two types of instabilities have been identified: (1) convective type that corresponds to long wavelengths, and (2) morphological type that corresponds to short wavelengths. These instabilities are coupled but while the convective instabilities depend strongly on gravity, the morphological instabilities are practically independent of gravity. For low velocities, the convective instabilities occur at much lower solute concentrations than the morphological instabilities, whereas at high velocities the reverse is true...|$|R
25|$|For {{these ideas}} to apply, {{everything}} {{observed in the}} frame has {{to be subject to}} a base-line, common acceleration shared by the frame itself. That situation would apply, for example, to the elevator example, where all objects are subject to the same <b>gravitational</b> <b>acceleration,</b> and the elevator itself accelerates at the same rate.|$|E
25|$|Pendulums are {{affected}} by changes in <b>gravitational</b> <b>acceleration,</b> which varies {{by as much as}} 0.5% at different locations on Earth, so precision pendulum clocks have to be recalibrated after a move. Even moving a pendulum clock {{to the top of a}} tall building can cause it to lose measurable time from the reduction in gravity.|$|E
25|$|During gliding, lift {{plays an}} {{increased}} role. Like drag, lift {{is proportional to}} velocity squared. Gliding animals will typically leap or drop from high locations such as trees, just as in parachuting, and as <b>gravitational</b> <b>acceleration</b> increases their speed, the aerodynamic forces also increase. Because the animal can utilize lift and drag to generate greater aerodynamic force, it can glide at a shallower angle than parachuting animals, allowing it to cover greater horizontal distance in the same loss of altitude, and reach trees further away.|$|E
40|$|The {{in-orbit}} {{dynamics of}} a large, flexible spacecraft has been modeled {{with a computer}} simulation, which was used for designing the control system, developing a deployment and gravity-gradient capture procedure, predicting the steady-state behavior, and designing a series of dynamics experiments for the Radio Astronomy Explorer (RAE) satellite. This flexible body dynamics simulator permits three-dimensional, large-angle rotation of the total spacecraft and includes effects of orbit eccentricity, thermal bending, solar pressure, <b>gravitational</b> <b>accelerations,</b> and the damper system. Flight {{results are consistent with}} the simulator predictions and are presented for the deployment and capture phases, the steady-state mission, and the dynamics experiments...|$|R
50|$|Deformation of the {{material}} is the change in geometry created when stress is applied (as a result of applied forces, <b>gravitational</b> fields, <b>accelerations,</b> thermal expansion, etc.). Deformation is expressed by the displacement field of {{the material}}.|$|R
30|$|Instead of {{directly}} {{using the}} GPS tracking observations for {{the determination of}} non-gravitational accelerations, kinematic orbits are used as pseudo-observations. That approach has already been successfully used by, e.g., Visser and van den IJssel (2016) to estimate calibration parameters for the individual accelerometers of the GOCE satellite. Highly reduced-dynamic orbits are fitted to the kinematic orbits, where the <b>gravitational</b> <b>accelerations</b> are prescribed by state-of-the-art models (e.g., for the mean gravity field and tides) and the non-gravitational accelerations are coestimated. The latter are represented by 3 D piecewise linear functions that have 10 -min time resolution and are expressed in the same satellite body-fixed frame that is used also for the accelerometer measurements.|$|R
25|$|The solar {{gravitational}} {{force on the}} Earth is on average 179 times stronger than the lunar, but because the Sun is on average 389 times farther from the Earth, its field gradient is weaker. The solar tidal force is 46% {{as large as the}} lunar. More precisely, the lunar tidal acceleration (along the Moon–Earth axis, at the Earth's surface) is about 1.1 × 10−7 g, while the solar tidal acceleration (along the Sun–Earth axis, at the Earth's surface) is about 0.52 × 10−7 g, where g is the <b>gravitational</b> <b>acceleration</b> at the Earth's surface. Venus has the largest effect of the other planets, at 0.000113 times the solar effect.|$|E
25|$|These {{objections}} were {{explained by}} Einstein's theory of general relativity, in which gravitation is an attribute of curved spacetime {{instead of being}} due to a force propagated between bodies. In Einstein's theory, energy and momentum distort spacetime in their vicinity, and other particles move in trajectories determined by the geometry of spacetime. This allowed {{a description of the}} motions of light and mass that was consistent with all available observations. In general relativity, the gravitational force is a fictitious force due to the curvature of spacetime, because the <b>gravitational</b> <b>acceleration</b> of a body in free fall is due to its world line being a geodesic of spacetime.|$|E
25|$|Craters are {{ubiquitous}} {{features of}} the mercurian surface. For the purpose of mapping, a fivefold morphologic classification of craters (fig. 10 in McCauley et al., 1981) {{is the basis for}} determining their relative ages. The youngest craters (c5) have sharp rim crests, textured ejecta blankets, and a well-defined field of secondary craters. Under favourable lighting conditions, the youngest craters exhibit bright rays superposed on all older materials. Older craters have increasingly degraded rims and lower relief and have lost their secondary crater fields. The major differences between mercurian and lunar craters are apparently related to the greater <b>gravitational</b> <b>acceleration</b> and the higher impact velocities on Mercury. Continuous ejecta deposits are less extensive, and secondary craters are more sharply defined and clustered nearer their primary crater. Also on Mercury, accentuated secondary craters form prominent crater chains radial to large craters.|$|E
40|$|The {{experimental}} {{approach and}} apparatus of a zero-gravity active crystal growth experiment to test dendritic growth theory at low supercoolings are discussed. The experiment consists of 20 experimental cycles. Estimates {{have been made}} as to how low <b>gravitational</b> <b>accelerations</b> {{would have to be}} reduced to observe convection-free dendritic growth at supercoolings from 0. 01 - 1. 0 K. The experiment requires temperature control of + or - 2 mK and photographic resolution of a few microns with a depth of field of + or - 6 mm. The thermostatic bath and temperature control system, photographic system, growth chamber, and dendrite detection system are described in detail...|$|R
40|$|A {{new set of}} E 2 E (end-to-end) {{simulated}} {{data for}} the GOCE mission has been recently produced by the European Space Agency and used for extensive testing of the procedures for the estimation of the gravity field. These data set spans 60 days and includes the satellite state vector data and orientation parameters, the measured gravity gradients and the measured non <b>gravitational</b> <b>accelerations.</b> These data have been contaminated by realistic in-flight calibration noise and other systematic effects, like biases, which make the analysis more difficult and meaningful. The space-wise solution procedure {{has been applied to}} the E 2 E data with very promising results. However some routines of the procedure had to undergo furthe...|$|R
40|$|Physical {{mechanisms}} that can influence rotation curves of spiral galaxies are discussed. For dark matter studies, possible contributions due to magnetic fields and non-Newtonian <b>gravitational</b> <b>accelerations</b> should be carefully acconted for. We {{point out that}} magnetic fields are particularly important in outermost parts of the disk. In the framework of general relativity the physical reason of an enhanced gravity in spiral galaxies depends on the assumed metric. The additional gravity is provided for Schwarzschild metric by nonluminous mass, whereas for Vaidya metric [1] by emission of radiative energy. In the latter case the non-Newtonian acceleration displays 1 /r behaviour. Also matter flows contribute to non-Newtonian gravity. PACS numbers: 98. 52. Nr., 98. 62. Dm. 1...|$|R
