40|$|When the {{difference}} of pressures between <b>inlet</b> <b>cylinder</b> chamber and exhaust one is small and also the sliding velocity of piston becomes considerably small, the stick-slip motion is generated. Under some assumptions, the approximated practical equations of motion of pneumatic cylinder is obtained. The period of stick-slip motion and the displacement of piston during one period of stick-slip motion are also obtained by approximated equations. Analytical {{results show that the}} period of stick-slip motion and the displacement of piston are affected by the position of piston, orifice area of speed controller, pressure of air supply and so on. For example, in the case of meter-out circuit, the period of stick-slip motion and the displacement of stick-slip motion increase as the volume of exhaust cylinder increases. On the contrary, in meter-in circuit, both period and displacement decrease as the volume of exhaust cylinder increases. In either case, the period and the displacement decrease as the pressure of air supply increases. But the influences of load on the period and the displacement are quite small. These results are shown in various diagrams. The theoretical results agree well with the experimental studies...|$|E

50|$|The {{pneumatic}} {{elements are}} {{most commonly used}} to resemble and take the function of hydraulic cylinders in appropriate models, actuating a digging arm or crane, for example. They can, however, {{also be used to}} build a pneumatic engine, which converts air pressure into rotary motion using the same principles as a steam engine.

50|$|Gas is {{injected}} into the <b>cylinder</b> <b>inlet</b> manifold by individual gas electromagnetic valves installed {{as close to the}} suction valves as possible. The valves are separately timed and controlled by injection control unit. This system interrupts the gas supply to the cylinder during the long overlap of the suction and exhaust valves (just typical for slow-speed and medium-speed engines - within the valve overlap cylinder scavenging is performed). This avoids substantial gas losses and prevents dangerous gas flow to the exhaust manifold.|$|R
50|$|Deflector pistons {{are used}} in {{two-stroke}} engines with crankcase compression, where the gas flow within the cylinder must be carefully directed {{in order to provide}} efficient scavenging. With cross scavenging, the transfer (<b>inlet</b> to the <b>cylinder)</b> and exhaust ports are on directly facing sides of the cylinder wall. To prevent the incoming mixture passing straight across from one port to the other, the piston has a raised rib on its crown. This is intended to deflect the incoming mixture upwards, around the combustion chamber.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{surveys the}} {{publications}} {{available in the}} literature concerning {{the application of the}} second-law of thermodynamics to internal combustion engines. The availability (exergy) balance equations of the engine cylinder and subsystems are reviewed in detail providing also relations concerning the definition of state properties, chemical availability, flow and fuel availability, and dead state. Special attention is given to identification and quantification of second-law efficiencies and the irreversibilities of various processes and subsystems. The latter being particularly important since they are not identified in traditional first-law analysis. In identifying these processes and subsystems, the main differences between second- and first-law analyses are also highlighted. A detailed reference is made to the findings of various researchers in the field over the last 40 years concerning all types of internal combustion engines, i. e. spark ignition, compression ignition (direct or indirect injection), turbocharged or naturally aspirated, during steady-state and transient operation. All of the subsystems (compressor, aftercooler, <b>inlet</b> manifold, <b>cylinder,</b> exhaust manifold, turbine), are also covered. Explicit comparative diagrams, as well as tabulation of typical energy and exergy balances, are presented. The survey extends to the various parametric studies conducted, including among other aspects the very interesting cases of low heat rejection engines, the use of alternative fuels and transient operation.

50|$|Designed {{and built}} by the English Electric Co., four steam turbine units of high pressure, {{intermediate}} pressure and double-flow low pressure turbine cylinders were coupled to 250 MW generators. The steam flow into the turbine was regulated by the hydraulically controlled steam inlet valves to maintain a generating speed of 3000 RPM. The turbine over-speed protection was by weight eccentric rings on the turbine shaft, set to throw-out at a predetermined RPM and shutting the HP <b>cylinder</b> <b>inlet</b> steam valves. Exhaust flow from the HP turbine cylinders passed to the boiler for reheating (with some having been bled off to feed heaters), returned to the IP cylinder (with some bled off to LP feed heaters) and exhausted from the double-flow LP cylinder under vacuum into underslung water-cooled condensers. Condenser cooling water was delivered from a sub-basement ring main around the turbine house.

40|$|Abstract: Turbocharged {{diesel engines}} {{are the most}} used prime mover in the ship {{propulsion}} plants, because of their superior power density and efficiency as compared to other thermal engines. So perfect efficiency and reliability of these engines {{is very important for}} ship safety and economy of navigation. For this reason, many papers are presented in technical literature for the diesel engines faults prediction and analysis. In this paper, a detailed and reliable thermodynamic diesel engine simulation model, including the engine-propulsion system governor, is used for the detailed study of several faults of a four stroke marine turbocharged diesel engine. The presented simulation results describe the behaviour variation of different engine components (<b>cylinders,</b> <b>inlet</b> and outlet manifolds, intercooler, turbocharger, etc.), {{as a consequence of the}} considered engine faults, and allow a prediction of the overall engine performance variation.

40|$|The {{presence}} of solid particle contaminant chips in high performance and complex automotive components like cylinder heads of internal combustion engines {{is a source}} of major concern for the automotive industry.

The outer cylinder {{is connected with}} vertical rectangular inlet and outlet pipes. The inner cylinder dissipates volumetric heat. The fluid flow and heat transfer characteristics between the cylinders are analyzed in detail for various Grashof numbers. The heat transfer rates on the individual faces of the inner cylinder are reported. The bottom face of the inner cylinder is found to associate with much higher heat rates {{than those of the}} other faces. The average Nusselt number on bottom face is more than 2. 5 times of the Nusselt number averaged on all the faces. At a given elevation, local Nusselt number on the inner cylinder faces increases towards cylinder edges.
