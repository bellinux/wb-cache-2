60|$|Just as {{distinctly}} as the daisy and buttercup are meadow flowers, the violet is a bank flower, {{and would}} fain grow always {{on a steep}} slope, towards the sun. And it is so poised on its stem that it shows, when growing on a slope, the full space and opening of its flower,--not at all, in any strain of modesty, hiding itself, though it may easily be, by grass or mossy stone, 'half hidden,'--but, to the <b>full,</b> <b>showing</b> itself, and intending to be lovely and luminous, as fragrant, to the uttermost of its soft power.|$|E

50|$|Each county had {{to raise}} a stated sum which was then divided between all the parishes in the County. Each parish {{appointed}} two Assessors to divide this liability between the individual landowners. John Hampden, who owned land in several parishes in Buckinghamshire, was assessed to £8.4s in his own parish of Great Hampden and he paid this and other assessments in <b>full,</b> <b>showing</b> {{that he was not}} objecting to the amount nor rejecting an obligation to defend his country. But in two parishes, where he owned less land, he refused payment on the point of principle and others followed his example. The two parishes where he refused payment were Great Kimble, where he was assessed to pay £1.11s.6d, and Stoke Mandeville, where his liability was £1.The Assessors for Great Kimble were required to prepare a list of persons failing to pay and this was issued at Great Kimble on 25 January 1635/6. At the head of the list is 'John Hampden 31s.6d.' followed by thirty other names assessed for smaller amounts including the two Assessors themselves and the two parish constables responsible to collect the money.|$|E
50|$|Edison {{and those}} {{traveling}} with him {{returned to the}} United States on September 28; Wangemann and his wife, who accompanied him, stayed in Europe. The first attempt to meet with Bismarck having failed, a second opportunity arose a week later for Wangemann and his wife to go to Friedrichsruh, to Bismarck's castle. While there, he recorded a wax cylinder, {{as reported in the}} press at the time, but which was then lost for more than 120 years. Bismarck, like everyone, was fascinated with the new invention and Wangemann spent several hours with him, even missing his train to Berlin. Wangemann met with Czar Alexander III on October 12. After weeks of postponements, this invitation that had meant so much to Wangemann found the Czar little interested in the phonograph and not interested in making a recording. A second visit took place, but shortly beforehand, the Czar was prevented from seeing Wangemann. While in Berlin, waiting to see the czar, Wangemann gave daytime demonstrations to artists, scientists and civil servants; in the evening, he gave demonstrations in private clubs to their invited members, often drawing crowds. Shortly before leaving Berlin, he organized a charity concert, where he charged admission, possibly his only European appearance with an entrance fee. Despite the 20-mark entrance fee, then equivalent to an average working man's weekly wage, the hall was <b>full,</b> <b>showing</b> how eager people were to hear the voices of Bismarck and the German crown princes.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{a recent}} paper, Stasinski and Voll {{introduced}} a length-like statistic on hyperoctahedral groups and conjectured a product formula for this statistic’s signed distribution over arbitrary descent classes. Stasinski and Voll proved this conjecture {{for a few}} special types of parabolic quotients. We prove this conjecture in <b>full,</b> <b>showing</b> it holds for all parabolic quotients. In {{the case that the}} descent class is a singleton, this formula gives the Poincare ́ polynomials for the varieties of symmetric matrices of a fixed rank. 1...|$|E
