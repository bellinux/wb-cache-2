5000|$|... #Subtitle level 2: Fee simple {{subject to}} an <b>executory</b> <b>limitation</b> ...|$|E
5000|$|A has a possessory {{interest}} in life estate subject to <b>executory</b> <b>limitation</b> (B's executory interest).|$|E
50|$|A {{fee simple}} subject to an <b>executory</b> <b>limitation</b> is an estate that ends when a {{specific}} condition is met and then transfers {{to a third}} party. The interest will not revert to the grantor. If the condition is met, the grantee loses the interest and the third party gains it automatically.|$|E
50|$|Executory {{interests}} usually {{arise when}} a grantor gives property to one person, provided {{that they use}} it a certain way. If the person fails to use it properly, the property transfers to a third party. There are {{two different types of}} executory interests: shifting and springing. <b>Executory</b> <b>limitations</b> transferring ownership from the grantor to a third party are called springing executory interests, and those that transfer from the grantee to a third party are called shifting executory interests.|$|R
50|$|Farwell J {{rejected}} Borland Trustee’s {{argument and}} held the article was valid. The transfer could be made, because the contract engendered in the articles of association are prior to the rights contained in a share. He said {{the argument that the}} article was repugnant to absolute ownership needed to assert, wrongly, that a share is a sum of money dealt with by <b>executory</b> <b>limitations.</b> But in fact a share is an interest and consists of ‘a series of mutual covenants entered into by all the shareholders inter se in accordance with section 16 of the Companies Act 1862.’ The argument about perpetuity has no application because the rule against perpetuities does not apply to personal contracts.|$|R
50|$|Henry {{sought to}} control the {{succession}} {{to some of his}} real property after his death. Toward that end, he placed in his will a shifting <b>executory</b> <b>limitation</b> so that title to some property would pass to his eldest son (who was mentally deficient) and then to his second son, and title to other property would pass to his second son, and then to his fourth son. The estate plan also included provisions for shifting the titles many generations later if certain conditions should occur.|$|E
5000|$|The {{rule has}} its {{origin in the}} Duke of Norfolk's Case of 1682. [...] That case {{concerned}} Henry, 22nd Earl of Arundel, {{who had tried to}} create a shifting <b>executory</b> <b>limitation</b> so that some of his property would pass to his eldest son (who was mentally deficient) and then to his second son, and other property would pass to his second son, but then to his fourth son. The estate plan also included provisions for shifting property many generations later if certain conditions should occur.|$|E
5000|$|In this case, the Earl of Arundel {{tried to}} create a {{shifting}} <b>executory</b> <b>limitation</b> so {{that some of his}} property would pass to his eldest son, Thomas (who was mentally deficient), and then to his second son, Henry. Henry would at first receive other property, but that would pass to the fourth son, Charles, if Henry succeeded to Thomas's property. The estate plan also included provisions for shifting the property many generations later if certain conditions should occur. The earl's sons had the revived title of [...] "Duke of Norfolk".|$|E
5000|$|A {{defeasible estate}} is created when a grantor {{transfers}} land conditionally. Upon the happening {{of the event}} or condition stated by the grantor, the transfer may be void or at least subject to annulment. (An estate not subject to such conditions is called an indefeasible estate.) Historically, the common law has frowned {{on the use of}} defeasible estates as it interferes with the owners' enjoyment of their property and as such has made it difficult to create a valid future interest. Unless a defeasible estate is clearly intended, modern courts will construe the language against this type of estate. Three types of defeasible estates are the fee simple determinable, fee simple subject to an <b>executory</b> <b>limitation</b> or interest, and the fee simple subject to a condition subsequent.|$|E
