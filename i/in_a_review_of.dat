5|$|As {{the series}} progressed, some critics began to express {{frustration}} with the comic. Joey Smith, also with Inside Pulse, found the large cast was difficult to track by the fourth issue. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>review</b> <b>of</b> issue 33, Fulton found the series entertaining, but sometimes thought the plot felt directionless. Not all agreed, however; Paste Magazine included the comic book in its list of favorite horror comics in late 2016.|$|E
5|$|However, in 1955, in {{a similar}} case {{involving}} another woman, Mrs. Clarice B. Covert, who had killed her husband in England with an axe, Federal District Court Judge Edward A.

Around this time, John Updike noticed his work and compared Narayan to Charles Dickens. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>review</b> <b>of</b> Narayan's works published in The New Yorker, Updike called him a writer of a vanishing breed—the writer as a citizen; one who identifies completely with his subjects and with a belief in the significance of humanity.|$|E

Lagrivea belongs to the squirrel family (Sciuridae), which first appears in the Late Eocene of North America and Early Oligocene of Europe. The specific name, vireti, honors Jean Viret for his work on the mammals of La Grive-Saint-Alban.|$|E
5|$|Rasmussen {{was also}} {{involved}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>review</b> <b>of</b> fossil birds from Miocene and Pliocene deposits in North Carolina.

The review found that fossil birds from this period generally closely resemble a modern species or genus, and those that do not can usually be placed in a modern family with a fair degree of confidence.|$|E

Worley comments on the relevance of the book to scholars in various fields, including history, law, law enforcement, and terrorism analysis. Worley concludes his review by recommending {{the book for}} those with a fascination in researching criminal justice or the law. William Abresch comments favorably on Targeted Killing in International Law, in a review for the European Journal of International Law. He writes that the book is an important addition to the field of scholarship regarding how international law governs the practice of targeted killing. Abresch calls the author's writing style logical, and praises the book's organizational structure including its separate sections on use of targeted in war contrasted with use by police.|$|E

5|$|The Malagasy {{hippopotamus}} {{was first}} {{described in the}} mid-19th century by Alfred Grandidier, who unearthed nearly 50 individual hippos from a dried-up swamp at 'Ambolisatra' (thought to be Ambolisaka, near Lake Ihotry), {{a few miles from}} the Mozambique Channel. As many as four different species of hippopotamus were subsequently identified by various researchers. In a careful revision of the fossil record of the Malagasy hippos, Solweig Stuenes concluded that there were only two species of hippopotamus which she classified as Hippopotamus lemerlei and Hippopotamus madagascariensis. In 1990, Faure and Guerin discovered a distinct third species of hippo, which they named Hippopotamus laloumena. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>review</b> <b>of</b> Stuenes work, Harris suggested that Hip. madagascariensis had much in common with the extant pygmy hippopotamus of West Africa. Since the extant pygmy hippopotamus was placed in the genus Hexaprotodon, he used the name Hex. madagascariensis. Some taxonomists, however, consider the modern pygmy hippo to belong to the genus Choeropsis, so this species may also be classified as C. madagascariensis.|$|E
