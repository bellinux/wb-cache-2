40|$|The {{evidence}} {{presented in this}} report suggests that the goals of public policy for older people may not be sufficiently aligned with the corresponding allocation of resources to services for older people. For example, the largest share of the HSE budget on services for older people (72 %) is spent on long-stay care under the Nursing Home Support Scheme, whilst {{less than a third}} (28 %) is spent on supporting people to live at home through the Home Care Package Scheme, the <b>Home</b> <b>Help</b> <b>Scheme</b> and Day Care. The need to review this situation is recognised and helps to explain why a substantial review is currently being undertaken. The policy goal of facilitating older people to live well in their own homes can be achieved, but will require significant re-allocations within the existing budget of services for older people. The proposed social enterprise creates new possibilities for reallocating resources in this way...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the views of older home care recipients on the care that they receive and the preferences of the <b>home</b> <b>help</b> staff to work more flexible times, in order to provide a more person-centred service for the older person. A mixed-methods design was used, incorporating both qualitative and quantitative research methods. The qualitative phase involved five focus groups (total participants: n= 23), to gain information on the recipients’ views on the <b>home</b> <b>help</b> received and how the service may become more person-centred. The quantitative phase involved sending postal questionnaires to Health Service Executive (HSE) <b>home</b> <b>help</b> employees (n= 202) and to <b>home</b> <b>help</b> employees from a voluntary <b>home</b> <b>help</b> agency in Dublin South West (n= 147). The findings from the qualitative phase of the research highlighted that the recipients were mainly satisfied with the service received but would like more communication with <b>home</b> <b>help</b> managers, and to be consulted regarding their care to allow for a more person-centred service. Companionship was also identified as a need for the older person. Data from the quantitative analysis indicated that <b>home</b> <b>help</b> employees, particularly in the HSE, are willing to work outside current contracted hours; for example, 8 p. m. to midnight midweek, or on Sunday evenings. Therefore, the future possibility of recruiting HSE <b>home</b> <b>help</b> staff to work more flexible hours needs to be considered to allow for a more person-centred <b>home</b> <b>help</b> service...|$|R

One of the aims {{was to examine the}} job content of the six new categories of <b>home</b> <b>help,</b> the differences in their work and the correspondence of daily practice with formal job descriptions. Six <b>home</b> <b>help</b> categories were examined: alpha helps; A home helps; B home helps; C and D carers; and specialized E carers - self-registration forms and weekly reports were used for data-collection. For a period of 4 weeks, 458 <b>home</b> <b>helps</b> recorded on these forms all the activities they carried out during and outside home visits. The daily work of alpha <b>helps,</b> A <b>home</b> <b>helps</b> and B caring helps mainly involves housework and psycho-social/supportive activities, whilst B caring helps also carry out some personal care and C carers do some housework, personal care and psycho-social or supportive activities. The main work of D carers consists of personal care and psycho-social activities. Psycho-social activities are mainly carried out by specialized E carers, who also do housework, mostly together with the client. In daily practice, the four subordinate categories of <b>home</b> <b>help</b> carry out more psycho-social and reporting activities, and the three highest categories do more housework compared with their formal job descriptions.

A total of 474 <b>home</b> <b>helps</b> from six categories participated in the study. A structured questionnaire, based on the components of the research model, was used, which consisted of existing scales regarding workload (organizational and job characteristics, working conditions), psychological and physical outcomes (job satisfaction, burnout, health) and capacity for coping (social support, leadership style, coping strategies). Workload, specifically organizational and job characteristics are scored low by alpha helps and, to a lesser degree, by A <b>home</b> <b>helps.</b> The higher categories of <b>home</b> <b>helps</b> experienced relatively bad working conditions. <b>Home</b> <b>helps,</b> except for alpha helps, are, on the whole, quite satisfied with their work, {{which is one of the}} psychological and physical outcomes. The higher categories of <b>home</b> <b>help</b> (C, D and E carers) experienced high feelings of emotional exhaustion. Health, absenteeism and back problems did not differ significantly amongst <b>home</b> <b>helps.</b> When looking at capacity for coping, traditional <b>home</b> <b>helps</b> (A to E) received more social support. The subordinate categories of <b>home</b> <b>help</b> dealt less actively with their problems and sought less social support than the other categories. Alpha helps are not employed by the organization and this might cause low organizational and job characteristics, and little social support. Their satisfaction scores suggest that they would like to see their low organizational involvement changed. The higher categories of <b>home</b> <b>help,</b> who carry out many psychosocial tasks, have higher emotional and mental workload and high burout cores.

Background Leadership factors are an important element of the psychosocial work environment in old age care. The physical distance between leaders and nursing assistants is larger in <b>home</b> <b>help</b> services than in nursing homes. Therefore, it is important to study leadership separately in nursing <b>homes</b> and <b>home</b> <b>help</b> services. Design Assessments from 844 nursing assistants in nursing homes and 288 in <b>home</b> <b>help</b> services (45 nursing homes and 21 <b>home</b> <b>help</b> service units) were analysed. Methods The data were analysed using linear regression. Age, gender, number of staff at the unit, number of years at the current working unit and educational level were controlled in Model 1. Summarised indexes that were based on all independent variables except the main independent variable were additionally controlled in Model 2. Results Psychosocial work environment was related to leadership factors, but stronger associations occurred more frequently in nursing homes than in <b>home</b> <b>help</b> services. Empowering leadership, support from superiors, the primacy of human resources and control over decisions were associated with higher assessments on all the variables that were related to the psychosocial work environment in both the nursing <b>homes</b> and <b>home</b> <b>help</b> services.

40|$|Introduction. Municipal eldercare is {{increasingly}} multifaceted. First line managers in nursing <b>homes</b> and <b>home</b> <b>help</b> services {{are responsible for}} personnel, budget and processes. The resources and work conditions of these managers have changed over time. The first line manager is often responsible not only for economic but also for quality development of their unit. Research focusing on first line management within municipal eldercare is lacking in specific contexts, for example, research on leadership in nursing <b>homes</b> and <b>home</b> <b>help</b> services. Aims. The aim of this thesis is to study and analyze perceptions of leadership in eldercare. The main objective is to analyze differences in leaders’ and nursing assistants’ perceptions of leadership in nursing <b>homes</b> and <b>home</b> <b>help</b> services, and to study leadership factors and their associations with psychosocial work environment among nursing assistants who are engaged in eldercare. Design and methods. This thesis is based on two studies, and uses cross-sectional data from two different surveys: the Developmental Leadership Questionnaire, DLQ (Larsson, 2006 a) and a Questionnaire for Psychological and Social factors at Work, QPS, (Dallner, et al., 2000). Assessments from 21 leaders and 95 nursing assistants in nursing <b>homes</b> and <b>home</b> <b>help</b> services were analyzed in study I. Assessments from 1132 nursing assistants in nursing homes and in <b>home</b> <b>help</b> services (n= 844 nursing homes and n= 288, <b>home</b> <b>help</b> service units) were analyzed in article II. The data were analyzed with descriptive and analytic statistics. Results. Nursing assistants in nursing homes assessed their leaders to be more controlling and observant than nursing assistants in <b>home</b> <b>help</b> services. According the leaders self assessment, leaders in <b>home</b> <b>help</b> services were less successful at being supportive, being a good example, and promoting creativity than leaders in nursing homes. Psychosocial work environment was related to leadership factors, but stronger associations occurred more frequently in nursing homes than in <b>home</b> <b>help</b> services. The leadership factors empowering leadership, support from superiors, focus on human resources and control over decisions were associated with better results on all the variables that {{were related to the}} psychosocial work environment in both nursing homes and in <b>home</b> <b>help</b> services. Conclusions and implications for practice. Organisational differences in conducting leadership in old age care must be considered. Some leadership characteristics are better conditions for creating and maintaining a positive psychosocial work environment for nursing assistants in nursing <b>homes</b> and <b>home</b> <b>help</b> services. Due to the differences in organisational settings, {{it is important to consider}} the differences in conditions for conducting leadership. To influence nursing assistants’ performance and to increase quality in eldercare in the long term, appropriate leadership is necessary. Therefore, it is important for the leaders to provide support in work, help to develop skills, encourage employees to participate in important decisions, and show interest in nursing assistants’ well-being. Also, the leaders might benefit if they reduce the specialisation of work, which counteracts the possibility to have variation in work in nursing <b>homes</b> and <b>home</b> <b>help</b> services. In particular, nursing homes should benefit if they reduce the amount of role conflicts, and if nursing assistants receive reasonable quantitative work demands. The municipality eldercare should take into account the organisational differences in conducting leadership in nursing homes in relation to <b>home</b> <b>help</b> services. Recruiting leaders with characteristics that are desirable in the specific context will create better conditions for a good psychosocial work environment in nursing <b>homes</b> and <b>home</b> <b>help</b> services...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The overall aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{illuminate}} older persons' experience of becoming in need of public <b>home</b> <b>help</b> and their family members' experience of this situation. Further, {{the aim was to}} illuminate experiences of participation in the needs assessment process of older people and influence on decisions about public <b>home</b> <b>help</b> from the perspective of older needs-assessed persons, their family members, assessing <b>home</b> <b>help</b> officers and external <b>home</b> <b>help</b> officers. Method: A qualitative hermeneutic approach and triangulation of sources was used as the methodological strategy. A purposive sample of older persons aged 75 and over, who had gone through the needs assessment process and lived in their ordinary homes, was selected consecutively, retrospectively from <b>home</b> <b>help</b> officers' files on decisions about public <b>home</b> <b>help</b> in two municipalities. Data were collected about the same topic - older needs-assessed persons and family members' participation in the needs assessment, through personal interviews with those involved, the older needs-assessed persons (n= 28, age 75 - 96, Paper I-II), family members (n= 27, age 42 - 93, Paper III) the assessing <b>home</b> <b>help</b> officers (n= 5, age 29 - 50, 26 interviews), and an additional focus group interview with <b>home</b> <b>help</b> officers (n= 9) (Paper IV). Analysis: A qualitative content analysis was used (Paper I-IV) to interpret concrete and abstract meaning content, the latter inspired by hermeneutics to convey the meaning of the utterance, which in each study was interpreted as one overarching category that encompassed principal categories and sub-categories. Findings: To the older persons becoming in need of public <b>home</b> <b>help</b> it meant "Experiencing discontinuity in life as a whole - the countdown has begun" (Paper I). Further, their participation and influence on decisions about public <b>home</b> <b>help</b> when undergoing needs assessment and receiving public <b>home</b> <b>help</b> meant "Having to be satisfied, adjust, and walk a fine line when balancing between needs and available help" (Paper II). To family members with an older next of kin becoming in need of public <b>home</b> <b>help,</b> their participation in the needs assessment procedure and the decisions about their next of kin's public <b>home</b> <b>help</b> meant "Feeling disconfirmed or confirmed in the needs assessment, when feeling pressed by the responsibility and struggling to balance the needs of the family" (Paper III). To <b>home</b> <b>help</b> officers, the participation of older help recipients and family members in the needs assessment procedure and the decisions made about public <b>home</b> <b>help</b> meant "Having to establish boundaries towards family influence {{and at the same time}} use them as a resource" (Paper IV). These findings seem to correspond to and provide an understanding of the meaning of older needs-assessed persons' and family members' participation in the needs assessment as a whole. Conclusion: The needs assessment marked a turning point that can be understood and framed as a larger distressing life transition for both older persons and family members, which could cause difficulties for adequate participation in the needs assessment. Both older persons and family members experienced the needs assessment as difficult to comprehend, they lacked knowledge regarding aims, procedures, and rights and had not perceived what was the actual needs assessment. The older persons' actual ability to participate and communicate varied, and family members could be necessary as representatives, which created a moral conflict for the <b>home</b> <b>help</b> officers. <b>Home</b> <b>help</b> officers' attitudes towards their professional responsibility seemed to influence their management of older persons' and family members' participation. The needs assessment focused solely on the older individual's present situation and mainly physical and practical disabilities and needs, while mental, existential, social and medical needs tended to be neglected. The older persons and family members had little opportunity to participate in the process or to influence the decisions. Older persons felt that help offered in accordance with municipal guidelines had to be accepted, and family members felt mainly disconfirmed in the needs assessment encounter. The forms of the needs assessment and organisational conditions must be reviewed to promote the sense of coherence and participation of those involved...|$|R

40|$|This thesis aims to {{shed light}} on the {{dynamics}} and the complexity in the relationship between power and resistance in labour, from an employee-perspective. This is done by describing and analyzing how a group of employees in municipal <b>home</b> <b>help</b> services interpret and make use of their possibilities to act, in relation to a process of change, initiated by the management, involving new technology. Hand-held computers were implemented by the management and the <b>home</b> <b>helps</b> were supposed to use them to register their daily work performance. A theoretical framework based on power and resistance in accordance with Michel Foucault and Jon McKenzie, together with Ackroyd & Thompson’s concept of self-organization, is used. The study has an ethnographic approach. The empirical material is based on a combination of participant observation, interviews and document analysis. Two major periods of observations were conducted. The first period focused on understanding the work performance and its routines. During the second period, the use of (or rather attempts to use) the hand-held computers was in focus. The interviews with the 11 <b>home</b> <b>helps</b> focused on the meaning and content of their work with regards to work performance, skills and knowledge, possibilities and limitations and their opinions of the ICT project. Five management representatives, a local councillor, a software consultant and a union representative were also interviewed in order to grasp a management perspective. The results show a pattern in the actions of the <b>home</b> <b>helps.</b> It is a rational way of acting where adaptability, responsibility and reliability permeate thoughts and actions. It functions as a premise for how the <b>home</b> <b>helps</b> interpret their possibilities to act at work. They address their loyalty in several directions: to the care recipients, but also to their colleagues, to the management and to the organization as such. This rationality of loyalty is reproduced by the <b>home</b> <b>helps</b> but also by the management. The <b>home</b> <b>helps</b> are aware to a certain extent of the loyalties in their actions and every so often they use them in a conscious way. They reflect on how strong the loyalty should be and towards whom or what it should be directed. The actions of the <b>home</b> <b>helps</b> at work in general and in relation to the ICT project in particular is characterised by loyalty and consent rather than by formal resistance. The <b>home</b> <b>helps</b> don’t show any formal resistance but they do self-organization. They strive towards a relative autonomy and to maintain their dignity. This way of acting is however related to the rationality of loyalty that has a regulating influence on their informal resistance. Despite the limited and informal character of the self-organization of the <b>home</b> <b>helps,</b> it can be considered subversive. It has a possibility of undermining the exercise of power and it creates an alternative professional identity to the one offered by the management...|$|R

A further purpose is to examine whether use of public eldercare is correlated to receipt of informal care and purchase of private services in the Swedish welfare state. The dissertation {{is based on the}} Kungsholmen Study, a population-based longitudinal study. Studies I–III used cross-sectional data from community-dwelling people aged 81 - 100 and examined (I) gender, (II) marital and parental status, and (III) dementia and depressive symptoms as predictors of use of <b>home</b> <b>help.</b> Study IV analyzed factors related to moving into institutional care and receipt of <b>home</b> <b>help</b> from 1994 / 96 to 2000. The majority of support provided to elders living in the community comes from informal sources, even among people living alone. There was considerable overlap between <b>home</b> <b>help</b> and informal care. When all sources of care were considered, childless individuals had comparatively lower odds of receiving care. Factors predicting use of public eldercare and informal care differed depending on whether or not elders coresided. No gender differences in use of formal and informal care were found when controlling for household composition. Living alone, dementia, need of help with household chores, and walking limitations increased the likelihood of using public eldercare. Coresidence, informal care from outside the household, and use of private services decreased the likelihood. Depressive symptoms increased the likelihood of receiving <b>home</b> <b>help</b> and institutionalization when using longitudinal data, but not in the cross-sectional studies. Educational level was of importance and interacted with several factors; persons with higher levels of education were advantaged.

The Public Assistance Act of April 1949 introduced special treatment and assistance (transferred from communal assistance or poor relief) for TB patients, while the law on measures for the deaf and dumb of January 1950 introduced special provisions for the deaf and partially deaf within the framework for the special care of handicapped persons. In addition, the <b>Home</b> <b>Help</b> Act of April 1949 obliged municipalities to operate <b>home</b> <b>help</b> services.|$|R

Temasek Cares also funds a programme to provide a family social worker to assist students from dysfunctional families. Under this programme, the family social worker will visit the students in their <b>homes</b> to <b>help</b> them overcome challenges which affect their emotional well-being and attendance at school. They support the school’s existing counsellors and teachers, who focus on the academic, social, and emotional needs of the student. The family social workers assess the needs of the family, provide counselling, direct the family to available <b>help</b> <b>schemes</b> and programmes, and follow up on progress made. Learning support specialists, such as a literacy coach and an educational psychologist, help students with learning needs to better access the curriculum.|$|R

40|$|Background & Aims: Total {{homocysteine}} (tHcy) {{has been}} suggested as a dementia risk factor. Our aim was to investigate potential differences in tHcy and its determinants (mainly Serum-B 12 and Serum-folate) in relation dementia. We examined the effect of vitamin-B 12 prescription, whether {{a family history of}} dementia, or the need for <b>home</b> <b>help</b> service might have influence on tHcy. Methods: A cross sectional monocenter study comprising 926 consecutive subjects attending our Memory Care Unit. Results: Demented subjects being prescribed vitamin-B 12 had higher Serum-B 12 (p = 0. 025) but also higher tHcy (p =< 0. 001) and S-methylmalonate (p = 0. 032), and lower Serum-folate (p< 0. 001) {{than those who did not}} receive B 12 prescriptions. tHcy levels were higher in subjects in need of <b>home</b> <b>help</b> service (non-dementia: p= 0. 007), this group also had lower S-albumin (dementia: p< 0. 001; non-dementia: p= 0. 004). In multivariate logistic regression analysis with diagnosis of dementia as outcome, both vitamin-B 12 prescriptions, family history of dementia, and existent <b>home</b> <b>help</b> service, predicted dementia (p= 0. 037; 0. 044; 0. 002 respectively). Conclusion: Elderly subjects on vitamin-B 12 prescription appear to have unmet needs of nutritional support, causing elevated homocysteine levels. The <b>home</b> <b>help</b> service should pay a closer attention to nutritional aspects and drug compliance among geriatric patients...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background To {{maintain}} {{the sustainability of}} public long-term care insurance (LTCI) in Japan, a preventive care policy was introduced in 2006 that seeks to promote active improvement in functional status of elderly people who need only light care. This policy promotes the use of day care services to facilitate functional improvement, and contains the use of <b>home</b> <b>help</b> services that provide instrumental activity of daily living (IADL) support. However, the validity of this approach remains to be demonstrated. Methods Subjects comprised 241 people aged 65 years and over who had recently been certified as being eligible for the lightest eligibility level and had began using either <b>home</b> <b>help</b> or day care services between April 2007 and October 2008 in a suburban city of Tokyo. A retrospective cohort study was conducted ending October 2009 to assess changes in the LTCI eligibility level of these subjects. Cox's proportional hazards model was {{used to calculate the}} relative risk of declining in function to eligibility Level 4 among users of the respective services. Results Multivariate analysis adjusted for factors related to service use demonstrated that the risk of decline in functional status was lower for users of <b>home</b> <b>help</b> services than for users of day care services (HR = 0. 55, 95 % CI: 0. 31 - 0. 98). The same result was obtained when stratified by whether the subject lived with family or not. Furthermore, those who used two or more hours of <b>home</b> <b>help</b> services did not show an increase in risk of decline when compared with those who used less than two hours. Conclusions No evidence was obtained to support the effectiveness of the policy of promoting day care services and containing <b>home</b> <b>help</b> services for those requiring light care. </p...|$|R
