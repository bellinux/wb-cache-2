The great St. Columba himself, the builder of many of the old ruins in the valley, climbed the mountains on one notable day to get near heaven with his prayers.

6000|$|To {{the wise}} peasant the green hills and woods round him {{are full of}} never-fading mystery. When the aged countrywoman stands at her door in the evening, and, in her own words, [...] "looks at the {{mountains}} and thinks {{of the goodness of}} God," [...] God is all the nearer, because the pagan powers are not far: because northward in Ben Bulben, famous for hawks, the white square <b>door</b> <b>swings</b> <b>open</b> at sundown, and those wild unchristian riders rush forth upon the fields, while southward the White Lady, who is doubtless Maive herself, wanders under the broad cloud nightcap of Knocknarea.

She passed so close that the skirt of her dress touched him. [...] "He fell down, and was dead three days."

Countless times over the past 50 years, performers have noticed {{a little girl in}} what looks like a school uniform sitting in a side box on the mezzanine.

The male is throttled by an invisible force, (which is actually band member Kalma, complete with top hat, when seen through the super 8 film camera he drops). One of the females is also dragged into the closet to her doom, by the guitarist, Amen. The band then appears, and, magically chaining the second female to a rocking chair, continue to sing the song. Her friends appear again, as zombies (with the female mirroring the deadite Linda from The Evil Dead), later in the song.

As she looks around, relieved, Mr. Lordi attacks her from behind (seen {{through the lens of}} the camera) just as the camera runs out of film.|$|E

I {{wanted to be able to}} move through time and between characters…” According to Ron Charles of the Washington Post “In someone else’s hands, “Commonwealth” would be a saga, a sprawling chronicle of events and relationships spread out over dozens of chapters. But Patchett is daringly elliptical here. Not only are decades missing, but they’re also out of order. We’re not so much told this story as allowed to listen in from another room as a <b>door</b> <b>swings</b> <b>open</b> and closed.” Jeanne Brown, in the Los Angeles Times called it “the 50-year Fallout After an Illicit kiss” She pointed out that forty years after Calvin died, family members are still not sure what happened. “The present story lines are overshadowed by the events of the past, the book’s most contemporary scenes existing primarily as an entrée to older memories.” ...|$|E
