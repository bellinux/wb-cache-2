While working for his two British employers, Mills participated {{in the design of}} locomotives for export to railways throughout the world. In 1926, on the recommendation of Sir WG Armstrong-Whitworth & Co, he was appointed <b>Designing</b> <b>Draughtsman</b> for the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) and emigrated to Western Australia.

5000|$|The {{layout of}} the town's road system was {{apparently}} <b>designed</b> by a <b>draughtsman</b> in Adelaide, without any knowledge of the local geography. [...] There are several roads in Clare that end abruptly at a cliff face, only to continue again {{at the top of}} the cliff.|$|R

5000|$|Fowler {{was not a}} {{hands-on}} engineer in the mould of George Jackson Churchward. Although (as was traditional) designs produced during his tenure were credited to him as [...] "Fowler" [...] locomotives, {{the majority of the}} work was done by his staff with minimal personal involvement from Fowler. An analogy may be made with his successor Sir William Stanier's Princess Coronation (Duchess) class, which was largely <b>designed</b> by LMS <b>draughtsmen</b> while Stanier was out of the country, although Stanier was more deeply involved in other designs during his tenure.|$|R

50|$|A pair of 1000 {{horsepower}} winding engines {{built for}} the Delprat Shaft in Broken Hill in 1900/1901 were <b>designed</b> by head <b>draughtsmen</b> John Wesley, draughtsman William J. May, and Alfred May, and the engineering team which William then converted into the final drawings. The showing of these engines under steam was done under Alfred and William J. May's management partners of the firm. It broke world records in performance output for its type. In 1910, he unveiled the Climax Complete Harvester, which cut a seven-foot swathe and enabled one man to strip, clean and bag 20 acre of wheat in one day. The firm had grown from a five-man operation to having 360 on the payroll, and very few Australian farms or mines were without {{at least one of}} the May Brothers' inventions.|$|R

50|$|Anton Hofer learned {{after his}} school time, during World War II, the {{profession}} of an aircraft constructor and pilot.

Within a few months, he became head of the plant security. In his spare time, he found a new interest: volleyball. A major attendance in the Austrian volleyball team underlines his ability in the 1950s.|$|E
5000|$|All {{members of}} the Royal Engineers are trained combat {{engineers}} and all sappers (privates) and non-commissioned officers also have another trade. These trades include: air conditioning fitter, electrician, general fitter, plant operator mechanic, plumber, bricklayer, plasterer / painter, carpenter & joiner, fabricator, building materials technician, <b>design</b> <b>draughtsman,</b> electrical & mechanical draughtsman, geographic support technician, survey engineer, armoured engineer, driver, engineer IT, engineer logistics specialist, amphibious engineer, bomb disposal specialist, diver or search specialist.

5000|$|Heinz Schröder {{was born}} in Berlin {{and grew up in}} the borough Friedrichshain. Early in his life, he became {{interested}} in puppets and made figures out of potatoes.

After 1945 he worked in the magistrate of East Berlin and later in the district committee of the Free German Youth. From 1953, he performed in the newly founded puppet theater of the Berlin Pioneer Park [...] "Ernst Thälmann" [...] and from 1957 he finally started puppeteering on East German television, which should continue for over 30 years until 1991.|$|E
5000|$|The Austin 7 was {{designed}} at Lickey Grange between 1921 and 1922 in the billiards room (but {{not on the}} billiards table!). This was a 7 horsepower (hp) car. It had been designed in private, at Sir Herbert Austin's expense, at Lickey Grange because the other directors of the Austin Motor company preferred bigger 12 hp-engined cars and were against {{the idea of a}} [...] "small" [...] car. Herbert Austin patented some of the features and so gained a royalty for every Austin 7 sold by the company. Stanley Edge, the young <b>design</b> <b>draughtsman</b> who worked for Sir Herbert, lived at the Lodge but ate his meals in the adjoining library.|$|E
50|$|After leaving Wolves, Punter was on {{the books}} of Leicester City, but {{he moved on to}} Lincoln City without {{appearing}} for Leicester's first team. He made his debut on 12 December 1959 in a 1-0 home defeat to Rotherham United in the Football League Second Division. In the 1960-61 season, Lincoln finished bottom of their division. The following season, Punter, now playing as a centre forward, was the club's leading scorer, though with only eight goals as they suffered a second consecutive relegation. He repeated the achievement the next season in the Fourth Division, this time with 17 goals in all competitions as Lincoln narrowly avoided having to apply for re-election. Punter played his last game for the club in April 1964. He had remained a semi-professional player for the whole of his five years with Lincoln, while continuing his main career as a <b>design</b> <b>draughtsman.</b>|$|E
