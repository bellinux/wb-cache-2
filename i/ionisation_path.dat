In the RPL model, the avalanche multiplication process in the i-region of a diode is modelled by generating random carrier trajectories, which may result in impact ionisation as described by an exponentially decaying probability distribution function (PDF) of the <b>ionisation</b> <b>path</b> length following a hard-threshold dead space...|$|E
40|$|The best-fitted {{electron}} and hole {{impact ionisation}} coefficients are obtained {{and it is}} found that the electron impact ionisation coefficient is higher than the hole impact ionisation coefficient. In this work, the impact ionisation coefficients at low electric fields are extrapolated to a high electric field region of 800 kV/cm. Two proposed models are produced by using the best-fitted electron and hole impact ionization coefficients over the wide range of electric fields. The impact ionisation coefficients for Model A converge at the high electric field region while for Model B the impact ionisation coefficients diverge. It is found that Model A is more suitable and therefore, this model is used to determine the mean multiplication gain and excess noise factor in the short and long devices. A random <b>ionisation</b> <b>path</b> length model is used for the electron- and hole-initiated multiplication in the multiplication region of 0. 1 μm and 0. 2 μm for short devices, and also 1. 3 μm, 2. 0 μm, 3. 6 μm and 4. 6 μm for long devices. The simulation is based on the dead space effect as well as by excluding the dead space effect in our work. It is found that the dead space effect becomes significant in short devices.

40|$|A Monte Carlo (MC) model {{employing}} three {{conduction band}} (CB) and valence band (VB) valleys described analytically {{is shown to}} reproduce successfully results from multiplication measurements performed on AI_xGa_ 1 _-_xAs (x = 0. 0 to 0. 3) p-i-n devices of nominal avalanching thicknesses, W, from 0. 5 #mu#m down to 0. 05 #mu#m. The dead space d, defined as the distance carriers travel before gaining sufficient energy to initiate ionisation, {{is found to be}} insignificant in thick structures but to occupy {{a significant portion of the}} high field region in thinner devices. Also, as the field is increased d is reduced and carriers are accelerated to energies greater than their steady state value resulting in an ionisation overshoot. These results confirm that for the AI_xGa_ 1 _-_xAs compositions investigated here, non-local effects become more important as the device becomes thinner. Multiplication measurements, carried out on Ga_ 0 _. _ 5 _ 2 IN_ 0 _. _ 4 _ 8 P devices (in which W ranges from nominally 2 #mu#m down to the width of a p-n junction) have been analysed assuming that ionisation depends only on the local electric field. The ionisation coefficients deduced are found to fall with decreasing W. When compared to GaAs structures of the same dimensions the total breakdown voltage V_T in Ga_ 0 _. _ 5 _ 2 IN_ 0 _. _ 4 _ 8 P is found to be 1. 8 - 1. 9 times higher across the range of W studied. A simple MC model using a single CB and VB valley was used to interpret these results and showed the existence of a dead space and ionisation overshoot that is similar to, but less prominent than that seen in GaAs. Multiplication and breakdown measurements were conducted on GaAs p-i-n devices (W = 0. 1 #mu#m to 1. 0 #mu#m) across the range 20 K to 500 K, and on Ga_ 0 _. _ 5 _ 2 IN_ 0 _. _ 4 _ 8 P p-i-n devices (W = 0. 2 #mu#m to 1. 0 #mu#m) across the range 20 K to 600 K. Ga_ 0 _. _ 5 _ 2 IN_ 0 _. _ 4 _ 8 P is shown to be more temperature stable than GaAs and the deduced ionisation coefficients for both material systems are shown to decrease with temperature. Using the more economical single valley model, the ionisation overshoot is shown to decrease, whilst the variation in the <b>ionisation</b> <b>path</b> length is shown to increase with temperature.

50|$|In 1931, Failla and Henshaw {{reported}} on {{determination of the}} relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of x rays and γ rays. This {{appears to be the}} first use of the term ‘RBE’. The authors noted that RBE was dependent on the experimental system being studied. Somewhat later, it was pointed out by Zirkle et al. (1952) that the biological effectiveness depends on the spatial distribution of the energy imparted and the density of <b>ionisations</b> per unit <b>path</b> length of the ionising particles. Zirkle et al. coined the term ‘linear energy transfer (LET)’ to be used in radiobiology for the stopping power, i.e. the energy loss per unit path length of a charged particle. The concept was introduced in the 1950s, {{at a time when the}} deployment of nuclear weapons and nuclear reactors spurred research on the biological effects of artificial radioactivity. It had been noticed that those effects depended both on the type and energy spectrum of the radiation, and on the kind of living tissue. The first systematic experiments to determine the RBE were conducted in that decade.|$|R
40|$|Future electron-positron linear {{colliders}} must produce {{bunches of}} tiny emittance grouped in short bunch trains {{in order to}} provide adequately large luminosities. A collimation system must be installed between the end of the main linac and the optical elements of the final focus to protect the detectors from errant beams. With ordinary values of the betatron functions, the transverse beam size is of a few microns. With such sizes, the local deposition of heat of even a single bunch train is so high that no material can survive such an event. The problem is solved by increasing the beam sizes at the location of the collimators. But the use of large betatron functions is costly and can induce strong optical errors. It is therefore important to compute precisely safe beam sizes which allow the survival of the collimators, in order to limit their increase to the minimum needed. The deposition of heat occurs both by <b>ionisation</b> along the <b>path</b> of the particles which traverse the material and by ohmic image current heating at the surface of the collimator, for that fraction of the beam which flies outside the collimator. With small bunches, heat diffusion is substantial even with short bunch trains and helps to reduce the excursion of temperature. The rise of temperature is computed by solving analytically the time-dependent heat equation in two spatial dimensions near an interface with vacuum.

40|$|Abstract. It {{has been}} {{discussed}} ever since among the sci-entific communities, whether non-ionising radiation can al-ter or harm biological systems. While the mechanisms of underlying effects of ionising radiation are well understood and described here, there is less understanding in the effects caused by non-ionising radiation except for heating effects. Recent results have been interpreted, that numerical chromo-some aberrations may be induced by exposure to RF radia-tion. Our own experiments employing the µTEM cell yield results similar to findings observed for aneugenic-inducing chemical agents which can cause spindle disturbances. For comparison purpose to the effects caused by those agents we used the well established human-hamster hybrid (AL) cell line to evaluate the biological effects after exposure to RF ra-diation (835 MHz). 1 Ionising radiation Ionising radiation (IR) can randomly cause damage to all cel-lular components and induces a variety of DNA lesions, like single strand breaks, double strand breaks or base damage. The deposition of energy from IR results {{in the formation of}} excited and ionized molecules. Traditionally, IR damage to DNA is ascribed to both direct and indirect effects. Direct effects result from the direct interaction of the IR with DNA. Indirect effects result from the interaction of DNA with re-active species formed by IR. The underlying chemistry of lesion formation is fairly well understood. The resulting bio-logical effect on mammalian cells is influenced by the dose, dose-rate, and quality of the radiation. The reason is that the biological effectiveness depends on the spatial distribution of the energy imparted and the density of <b>ionisations</b> per unit <b>path</b> length of the ionising particles.

40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with the measurement and interpretation of avalanche noise in avalanche photodiodes (APDs). The design of a measurement system with a higher signal to noise ratio than previous systems reported in the published literature is described. The system uses phase sensitive recovery techniques, which allow the avalanche noise power and photocurrent to be measured unambiguously from the system noise and leakage current of the device under test. Using the measurement system described, avalanche noise measurements have been performed on a range of homojunction GaAs p"+-i-n"+ and n"+-i-p"+ diodes with 'i' region widths, w, from 2. 61 #mu#m to 0. 05 #mu#m, and on a range of homojunction InP p"+-i-n"+ diodes with widths, w, ranging from 2. 40 #mu#m to 0. 24 #mu#m. The results show that, for w #<=# 1 #mu#m, the dependence of excess noise factor F on multiplication does not follow the continuous noise model of McIntyre, which has become well established since its publication in 1966. Instead, a decreasing noise factor is observed as w decreases for a constant multiplication. This reduction in F occurs for both electron and hole initiated multiplication in the thinner w structures even though the ionisation coefficient ratio is close to unity. These results suggest that, in GaAs and in InP, if a thin multiplication region is used it is not always necessary for the greatest ionising carrier type to initiate multiplication for the lowest avalanche noise. To interpret the measurements, a model is used that includes the effect of dead space; the minimum distance a carrier must travel to gain the ionisation threshold energy. The dead space is found to be increasingly important in these thinner structures and restricts carriers to ionising {{in the latter half of}} their transit of the high field. This restriction makes the probability distribution function for the <b>ionisation</b> <b>path</b> length more deterministic and, in turn, reduces the overall unpredictability in the multiplication process, leading to a lower excess noise. The effect of distributed carrier generation, and so of mixed injection, in a 0. 1 #mu#m avalanche region is also investigated experimentally and using a model including dead space. These results show that the noise produced from mixed injection is lower than predicted by McIntyre's model, but higher than that obtained with pure electron or hole injection due to the effect of dead space.
