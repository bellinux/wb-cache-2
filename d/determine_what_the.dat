They conducted contamination and radiation level surveys and found that there was no contamination, but the radiation dose rate was as high as 10 mSv/h near the source, which kept them from getting close enough to <b>determine</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> source was. Surveys to locate the source continued throughout the night. The scrapyard and immediate vicinity were cordoned off, but evacuation was deemed unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|A gene is a {{sequence}} of DNA or RNA which codes for a molecule that has a function. The DNA is first copied into RNA. The RNA can be directly functional or be the intermediate template for a protein that performs a function. The transmission of genes to an organism's offspring {{is the basis of}} the inheritance of phenotypic traits. These genes make up different DNA sequences called genotypes. Genotypes along with environmental and developmental factors <b>determine</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> phenotypes will be. Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes (many different genes) as well as gene–environment interactions. Some genetic traits are instantly visible, such as eye color or number of limbs, and some are not, such as blood type, risk for specific diseases, or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that comprise life.|$|E

A captive Novisuccinea chittenangoensis colony was being maintained at the Rosamond Gifford Zoo in Syracuse, New York, however, the last remaining snails died in November 2002. Other unsuccessful breeding programs were tried in the 1990s: at ESF at Syracuse; at the Wildlife Conservation Park/Bronx Zoo; an early effort at the Rosamond Gifford Zoo (then called the Burnet Park Zoo); at the Seneca Park Zoo (Rochester, New York); and at the Buffalo Zoo.

25|$|Torque can {{be defined}} as the rate of change of angular momentum, {{analogous}} to force. The conservation of angular momentum helps explain many observed phenomena, for example the increase in rotational speed of a spinning figure skater as the skater's arms are contracted, the high rotational rates of neutron stars, the falling cat problem, and precession of tops and gyros. Applications include the gyrocompass, control moment gyroscope, inertial guidance systems, reaction wheels, flying discs or Frisbees and Earth's rotation to name a few.

Fluctuations observed in the maize consumption over time illustrate a peak period in maize production followed by a subsequent decrease. Individuals who had died and been interred in the ossuary at early, had a diet consisting of approximately 54% maize. Over time this increased to 70%, then dropped to 60%.|$|E

It is likely that attention, processing speed, capacity reduction, and inhibitory control may all play a role in these age-related deficits. The brain regions that are active during working memory tasks are also being evaluated, and research has shown that different parts of the brain are activated during working memory in younger adults as compared to older adults. This suggests that younger and older adults are performing these tasks differently.|$|E

He called for United Nations plebiscites in the Somali-inhabited areas outside the republic and asked for the Organization of African Unity to send fact-finding commissions to the areas to <b>determine</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Somali inhabitants of these disputed areas desired.

25|$|The {{question}} of the Bible and slavery {{in the era of}} the Civil War was never a simple question. The issue involved the American expression of a Reformed literal hermeneutic, the failure of hermeneutical alternatives to gain cultural authority, and the exercise of deeply entrenched intuitive racism, as well as the presence of Scripture as an authoritative religious book and slavery as an inherited social-economic relationship. The North– forced to fight on unfriendly terrain that it had helped to create– lost the exegetical war. The South certainly lost the shooting war. But constructive orthodox theology was the major loser when American believers allowed bullets instead of hermeneutical self-consciousness to <b>determine</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Bible said about slavery. For the history of theology in America, the great tragedy of the Civil War is that the most persuasive theologians were the Rev. Drs. William Tecumseh Sherman and Ulysses S. Grant.|$|E
25|$|VNAs {{designed}} for the simultaneous measurement of the S-parameters of networks with more than two ports are feasible but quickly become prohibitively complex and expensive. Usually their purchase is not justified since the required measurements can be obtained using a standard 2-port calibrated VNA with extra measurements followed by the correct interpretation of the results obtained. The required S-parameter matrix can be assembled from successive two port measurements in stages, two ports at a time, on each occasion with the unused ports being terminated in high quality loads equal to the system impedance. One risk {{of this approach is}} that the return loss or VSWR of the loads themselves must be suitably specified to be {{as close as possible to}} a perfect 50 Ohms, or whatever the nominal system impedance is. For a network with many ports there may be a temptation, on grounds of cost, to inadequately specify the VSWRs of the loads.
