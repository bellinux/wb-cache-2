40|$|Atmospheric {{dispersion}} code system SPEEDI (System for Prediction of Environmental <b>Emergency</b> <b>Dose</b> Information) {{has been applied}} to simulate the field experiments conducted over a complex terrain. Two series of tracer release expperiments conducted during stable atmospheric cnditions have been considered for the present study. A diagnostic mass consistent wind field model of the code system simulates the flow over an isolated hill using the routinely measured data from SODARs and meteorological tower. An objective basis for the adjustment of the horizontal and vertical wind components has been incorporated in the model and the results show a great improvement in modelling the flow past the hill. Calculated profiles of the vertical velocity component around the hill have been compared with those observed by the SODARs. The model stream lines show closer agreement with the tetroon trajectory and the ground level concentration patterns. Dispersion calculations are carried out using a Lagrangian particle random walk model and the dispersion parameters obtained from the earlier local field experiment are used in the model. The code is modified in order to utilise the observed turbulence data and the later scheme performs better in simulating high values of the concentrations observed near the source. Summary of the results of all the cases suggests that the accuracy of the code system improves significantly when all these changes are introduced.

40|$|After an {{accidental}} release of radioactivity to atmosphere, modelling assessments {{are needed to}} predict what the contamination levels {{are likely to be}} and what measures need to be taken to protect human health. These predictions will be imprecise due to lack of knowledge {{about the nature of the}} release and the weather, and also due to measurement inaccuracy. This thesis describes work to investigate this imprecision and to find better ways of including it in assessments and representing it in results. It starts by reviewing exposure pathways and the basic dose calculations in an emergency response assessment. The possible variability of key parameters in <b>emergency</b> <b>dose</b> calculations is considered, and ranges are developed for each. The imprecision typically associated with calculational endpoints is explored through a sensitivity study. This has been done using both a simple Gaussian atmospheric dispersion model and also real-time weather data in combination with a complex atmospheric dispersion model. The key parameters influencing assessment imprecision are identified. These are demonstrated to be factors relating to the release, arising from inevitable lack of knowledge in the early stages of an accident, and factors relating to meteorology and dispersion. An alternative improved approach to emergency response assessments is then outlined, which retains a simple and transparent assessment capability but which also indicates the imprecision associated with the results through incomplete knowledge. This tool uses input from real-time atmospheric dispersion and weather prediction tools. A prototype version of the tool has been created and this has been used to produce example results. The final stage of the thesis describes the use of the new tool to develop ways in which imprecise or uncertain information can be presented to decision makers.

40|$|Temporal {{variations}} {{in the amount of}} radionuclides released into the atmosphere during the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station (FNPS 1) accident and their atmospheric and marine dispersion are essential to evaluate the environmental impacts and resultant radiological doses to the public. In this paper, we estimate the detailed atmospheric releases during the accident using a reverse estimation method which calculates the release rates of radionuclides by comparing measurements of air concentration of a radionuclide or its dose rate in the environment with the ones calculated by atmospheric and oceanic transport, dispersion and deposition models. The atmospheric and oceanic models used are WSPEEDI-II (Worldwide version of System for Prediction of Environmental <b>Emergency</b> <b>Dose</b> Information) and SEA-GEARN-FDM (Finite difference oceanic dispersion model), both developed by the authors. A sophisticated deposition scheme, which deals with dry and fog-water depositions, cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activation, and subsequent wet scavenging due to mixed-phase cloud microphysics (in-cloud scavenging) for radioactive iodine gas (I 2 and CH 3 I) and other particles (CsI, Cs, and Te), was incorporated into WSPEEDI-II to improve the surface deposition calculations. The results revealed that the major releases of radionuclides due to the FNPS 1 accident occurred in the following periods during March 2011 : the afternoon of 12 March due to the wet venting and hydrogen explosion at Unit 1, midnight of 14 March when the SRV (safety relief valve) was opened three times at Unit 2, the morning and night of 15 March, and the morning of 16 March. According to the simulation results, the highest radioactive contamination areas around FNPS 1 were created from 15 to 16 March by complicated interactions among rainfall, plume movements, and the temporal variation of release rates. The simulation by WSPEEDI-II using the new source term reproduced the local and regional patterns of cumulative surface deposition of total 131 I and 137 Cs and air dose rate obtained by airborne surveys.

40|$|Introduction/Rationale: Studies of prehospital {{emergency}} pediatric care report frequent miscalculation of drug dosing. The Broselow Tape, {{a medication}} dosing reference guide, is used during emergencies to predict children’s weight {{according to their}} length. Dosing errors commonly occur when providers convert weight from pounds to kilograms, calculate dosages from a weight-based formula, or calculate volumes required to deliver specific medication doses. The Michigan Medication <b>Emergency</b> <b>Dosing</b> and Intervention Card (MI-MEDICard), a new dosing tool, reduces the need for multiple mathematical conversions. This {{study was designed to}} assess differences in dosing errors among paramedics when using the MI-MEDICard in comparison to the Broselow Tape during hypothetical pediatric emergency scenarios. Materials and Methods: Ninety-nine paramedics from five EMS agencies representing urban, suburban and rural response areas completed written tests utilizing the MI-MEDICard and the Broselow tape. Study subjects were randomly assigned into groups varying the order in which the tools were utilized. A crossover study design method was used. Analysis was conducted on the scores from each test and the order in which the dosing tools were used. Results: Average total errors were 5. 63 (± 1. 56) per study subject with using the Broselow Tape and 1. 52 (± 1. 61) using the MI-MEDICard. The maximum total number of errors possible was 9. Error rate reductions by dosing scenario were: epinephrine for cardiac arrest (52 %), epinephrine for anaphylaxis (96 %), dextrose 25 % (94 %), adenosine (38 %), midazolam (58 %), diphenhydramine (68 %), morphine (83 %), and fentanyl (66 %). Discussion: Paramedics have to make decisions quickly, in extremely uncontrolled environments. Such environments are unstable due to, among other factors, emotional escalation, personal safety, scene safety and security, and time pressures. These factors increase stress on the provider and can reduce (or eliminate) clear thinking and skill retention needed for proper patient care. Pediatric medication dosing has been recognized as a high-error activity with the potential to cause serious harm. The MI-MEDICard was designed in hopes to reduce pediatric medication errors and has become a mandatory standard piece of equipment on each advanced life support vehicle in Michigan by MDHHS. However, requiring the use of the MI-MEDICard is only a first step toward assuring a reduction in pediatric medication errors. Conclusion: The use of the MI-MEDICard produced a 73 % reduction in pediatric drug dosing errors. The results of this study demonstrate that supplementing the Broselow Tape with MI-MEDICard should result in a reduction in pediatric medication dosing errors...|$|R

There are fewer data to support treatment of neurologic toxicities associated with local anesthetics. Implementation: Intravenous lipid emulsion 20 % should be available whenever patients receive large doses of local anesthetics in operating rooms and <b>emergency</b> departments. Various <b>dosing</b> protocols {{have been published in}} the medical literature. Although the dosing protocols are based on low-level evidence, a lack of major adverse events makes lipid emulsion an appropriate therapy for treating cardiotoxic symptoms induced by local anesthetics.

40|$|Critical care {{physicians}} are increasingly facing patients receiving oral anticoagulation for either cessation of major haemorrhage or {{to reverse the}} effects of vitamin K antagonists ahead of emergency surgery. Rapid reversal of anticoagulation is particularly essential in cases of life-threatening bleeding. In these situations, guidelines recommend the concomitant administration of prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs) and oral or intravenous vitamin K for the fastest normalisation of the international normalised ratio (INR). Despite their universal recommendation, PCCs remain underused by many physicians who prefer to opt for fresh frozen plasma despite its limitations in anticoagulant reversal, including time to reverse INR and high risk of transfusion-related acute lung injury. In contrast, the lower volume required to normalise INR with PCCs and the room temperature storage facilitate faster preparation and administration time, thus increasing {{the speed at which}} haemorrhages can be treated. PCCs therefore allow faster, more reliable and complete reversal of vitamin K anticoagulation, especially when administered immediately following confirmation of haemorrhage. In the <b>emergency</b> setting, probabilistic <b>dosing</b> may be considered...|$|R

Little is known about the future consequences of this procedure on maternal health. This study investigated the influence of anesthetic/surgical technique and postop-erative analgesia on the onset of chronic pain after three months of cesarean section. Method: This is a prospective randomized study of 443 patients undergoing cesarean section (elective and <b>emergency),</b> with different <b>doses</b> of hyperbaric bupivacaine 0. 5 % and opioids in spinal anesthesia. Patients were alocated into five groups as follow: G 1 received hyperbaric bupi-vacaine (8 mg), sufentanil (2. 5 µg), and morphine (100 µg); G 2 received hyperbaric bupivacaine (10 mg), sufentanil (2. 5 µg), and morphine (100 µg); G 3 received hyperbaric bupivacaine (12. 5 mg) and morphine (100 µg); G 4 received hyperbaric bupivacaine (15 mg) and morphine (100 µg); G 5 received hyperbaric bupivacaine (12. 5 mg) and morphine (100 µg), without perioperative anti-inflammatory.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Rapid {{response}} systems (RRSs) {{are considered}} {{an important tool}} for improving patient safety. We studied the effect of an RRS on the incidence of cardiac arrests and unexpected deaths. METHODS: Retrospective before- after study in a university medical centre. We included 1376 surgical patients before (period 1) and 2410 patients after introduction of the RRS (period 2). Outcome measures were corrected for the baseline covariates age, gender and ASA. RESULTS: The number of patients who experienced a cardiac arrest and/or who died unexpectedly decreased non significantly from 0. 50 % (7 / 1376) in period 1 to 0. 25 % (6 / 2410) in period 2 (odds ratio (OR) 0. 43, CI 0. 14 - 1. 30). The individual number of cardiac arrests decreased non-significantly from 0. 29 % (4 / 1367) to 0. 12 % (3 / 2410) (OR 0. 38, CI 0. 09 - 1. 73) {{and the number of}} unexpected deaths decreased non-significantly from 0. 36 % (5 / 1376) to 0. 17 % (4 / 2410) (OR 0. 42, CI 0. 11 - 1. 59). In contrast, the number of unplanned ICU admissions increased from 2. 47 % (34 / 1376) in period 1 to 4. 15 % (100 / 2400) in period 2 (OR 1. 66, CI 1. 07 - 2. 55). Median APACHE ll score at unplanned ICU admissions was 16 in period 1 versus 16 in period 2 (NS). Adherence to RRS procedures. Observed abnormal early warning scores ? 72 h preceding a cardiac arrest, unexpected death or an unplanned ICU admission increased from 65 % (24 / 37 events) in period 1 to 91 % (91 / 101 events) in period 2 (p?<? 0. 001). Related ward physician interventions increased from 38 % (9 / 24 events) to 89 % (81 / 91 events) (p?<? 0. 001). In period 2, ward physicians activated the medical emergency team in 65 % of the events (59 / 91), although in 16 % (15 / 91 events) activation was delayed for one or two days. The overall medical <b>emergency</b> team <b>dose</b> was 56 / 1000 admissions. CONCLUSIONS: Introduction of an RRS resulted in a 50 % reduction in cardiac arrest rates and/or unexpected death. However, this decrease was not statistically significant partly due to the low base-line incidence. Moreover, delayed activation due to the two-tiered medical emergency team activation procedure and suboptimal adherence of the ward staff to the RRS procedures may have further abated the positive results...|$|R

40|$|Background: Levonorgestrel (0. 75 mg {{given for}} two doses 12 h apart) {{has been proven}} to be an {{effective}} regimen for emergency contraception when the first dose is given within 72 h of unprotected coitus. However, the dosing interval is inconvenient for those taking the first dose in the afternoon. We conducted a randomized study to evaluate two levonorgestrel <b>dosing</b> regimens for <b>emergency</b> contraception. Two <b>doses</b> of levonorgestrel 0. 75 mg were administered with the first dose given up to 120 h after unprotected intercourse. The second dose was given 12 h later in the first regimen and 24 h later in the second regimen. Methods: We conducted a double-blind, randomized trial between 1997 and 2003 at five centres in China. A total of 2071 women requesting emergency contraception within 120 h of unprotected intercourse were recruited. They were randomized to receive two doses of 0. 75 mg of levonorgestrel, given either 24 h apart or 12 h apart. Results: Outcome was unknown for 53 women (24 in the 24 h group and 29 in the 12 h group). Among the remaining 2018 women, the crude pregnancy rate was 1. 9 % in the 24 h group [95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 17 - 2. 94] and 2. 0 % in the 12 h group (95 % CI 1. 19 - 2. 99). The proportion of pregnancies prevented was estimated to be 72 % in the 24 h group and 75 % in the 12 h group. Side-effects were mild in both groups. The efficacy of the 12 h regimen declined significantly when there were further acts of intercourse after treatment (5. 0 versus 1. 0 %, P < 0. 01). This was not observed in the 24 h group. Conclusions: Two doses of 0. 75 mg levonorgestrel given either 24 or 12 h apart are effective for emergency contraception up to 120 h after unprotected intercourse. Further research to investigative more effective methods of emergency contraception is warranted. © European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology 2004; all rights reserved. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
