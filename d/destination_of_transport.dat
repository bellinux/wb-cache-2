40|$|Microtubule-based {{transport}} {{in cells}} {{is powered by}} a small set of distinct motors, yet timing and <b>destination</b> <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> can be controlled in a cargo-specific manner. The mechanistic basis for this specificity is not understood. To address this question, we analyzed the Drosophila Klarsicht (Klar) protein that regulates distinct microtubule-based transport processes. We find that localization of Klar to its cargoes is crucial for Klar function. Using mutations, we identify functionally important regions of Klar that confer distinct cargo specificity. In ovaries, Klar is present on the nuclear envelope, a localization that requires the C-terminal KASH domain. In early embryos, Klar is attached to lipid droplets, a localization mediated by a novel C-terminal domain encoded by an alternatively spliced exon. In cultured cells, these two domains are sufficient for targeting to the correct intracellular location. Our analysis disentangles Klar's modular organization: we propose that a core region integral to motor regulation is attached to variable domains so that the cell can target regulators with overlapping, yet distinct functions to specific cargoes. Such isoform variation may be a general strategy for adapting a common regulatory mechanism to specifically control motion and positioning of multiple organelles...|$|E

DISCUSSldN: Health and Safety Code (H&SC) section 39610 directs the Air Resources Board (Board) to identify upwind air basins that cause or contribute to violations of the State ozone standard in downwind areas and to assess the relative contributions of upwind emissions. This report proposes to amend the transport identification regulation (California Code of Regulations, title 17, section 70500 (c)) and to make conforming notational changes to the transport mitigation regulation (California Code of Regulations, title 17, section 70600). The-identification regulation lists the upwind and downwind areas that are the origin and <b>destination</b> <b>of</b> <b>transported</b> air contaminants referred to as “transport couples. ” The transport mitigation regulation requires air basins which are identified as upwind areas in the transport identification regulation to adopt best available retrofit control technology, as defined in Health and Safety Code section 40406, on all existing stationary sources of ozone precursor emissions. In addition, air basins that are classified as causing “overwhelming ” transport must adopt sufficient control measures to attain the State ozone standard in the downwind areas when conditions are conducive to “overwhelming” transport. 102 Based on the available data, the ARB staff recommends that two new transport couples be added to the transport identification regulation: the San Francisco Bay.

30|$|Software {{implementations}} of bypassing analyze codes during compile {{time and}} {{pass to the}} processor the exact information about the sources and the <b>destinations</b> <b>of</b> bypassed data <b>transports,</b> thus avoiding any additional bypassing and analyzing logic in the hardware. This requires an architecture with an exposed data path that allows such direct programming, like the transport-triggered architectures (TTA) [15, 16], synchronous transfer architecture[17], FlexCore[18], no-instruction-set-computer[19], or static pipelining[20]. A commercial application of the TTA paradigm is the Maxim MAXQ general-purpose microcontroller family [21].|$|R
30|$|Another {{interesting}} {{aspect of}} TTA comes from VLIW inheritance. An instruction defines what data transports {{are to be}} performed on each bus, which leads to wide instruction words. As a matter of fact, for each bus in the system, the instruction word encodes the source field <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> as well as <b>destination</b> field <b>of</b> <b>transport.</b> While increasing number of buses leads to more freedom for the compiler to schedule, it also increases the instruction width. Reducing the connectivity between sockets and buses typically leads to a lower number of bits required to encode data transport for individual bus and narrows the instruction width. However, in order to significantly reduce {{the negative impact of}} the instruction width, instruction compression can be applied. Using dictionary compression [25, 26], for example, the code density can be improved significantly with a decrease in spent energy as well.|$|R

Medical coordinators from the Northern Operations site of the Queensland emergency retrieval service {{were asked to complete}} a survey form about the changes that telehealth made to their retrieval decision-making process. Information was collected in six areas: diagnosis, severity, priority, crew, mode <b>of</b> <b>transport</b> and <b>destination.</b> During a 12 -month period, there were 403 emergency referrals from the five participating sites. There were 136 eligible patient referrals for analysis, of which 90 did not have teleconsultations performed; the most common reasons were that the medical coordinator was too busy with other work or the new procedure was forgotten (n = 39, 43 %). The remaining 46 patients had a teleconsultation during the trial and 44 data sheets were available for analysis. In 21 cases some component of the decision-making process was altered by the use of telehealth, with decisions being significantly altered in nine cases. Most alterations were for severity of patient condition, then diagnosis and priority of transfer. The use of telehealth was thought to be beneficial in confirming the original decision in 30 cases.

40|$|Abstract—In {{order to}} meet the {{overwhelming}} demands of content retrieval for mobile end users, a novel architecture for the next-generation Internet called Cache-and-Forward (CNF) has been proposed to transport content as large “packages ” in a hop by hop manner towards the <b>destination,</b> instead <b>of</b> <b>transporting</b> a stream <b>of</b> small packets along an established TCP/IP connection. In this paper, we investigate how CNF network architecture can be designed for efficient content retrieval for wireless mobile nodes. In particular, we look at Integrated Caching in which we assume each CNF router on the future Internet can cache contents that pass by and reply to content requests with its local copy. We name this content delivery method Caching-n-Capture(CC). We develop a mathematical model for CC to optimize the average content retrieval latency with limited storage on each CNF router. We propose Sequential Reassignment(SR) algorithm to solve the optimization problem. We compare the per-formance of the derived optimal solutions against our integrated caching and routing heuristics. The results show the Sequential Reassignment algorithm significantly reduces the average content retrieval latency by as high as 70 %. I...|$|R

Kinesin-driven cargoes entering the axon were arrested in the axon initial segment (AIS) upon myosin-V recruitment and accumulated in distinct actin-rich hotspots.
