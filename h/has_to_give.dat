5|$|Bart stays up late on Christmas Eve to kill Santa Claus for not {{bringing}} him a dirt bike three Christmases ago. He eventually falls asleep and dreams that the Polar Express, driven by Otto Mann, lands {{in front of}} the house and flies him to the North Pole. Bart meets Santa (Krusty the Clown) only to find out that he has run out of money, since giving out presents in return for cookies every year is not a sustainable business model. Feeling pity, Bart decides that Santa no longer <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> him a dirt bike and leaves with Santa throwing a party in his office after revealing how stupid kids are.|$|E
5|$|The Secret River is a {{story of}} Magical realism, {{blending}} real life and fantasy. Young Calpurnia is an aspiring poet living in rural Central Florida during the Great Depression. Hard times have come to her people; the animals have disappeared, her father is unable to catch fish to sell, and everyone in the community is too weak from hunger to work. Calpurnia bravely leaves home with her little dog, Buggy-Horse, to find the secret river that her neighbor Mother Albirtha has told her about. She intends to catch fish for her father to sell in his shop. When she finds the river she politely asks it to allow her to catch some fish and uses her creativity, and the pink ribbons from her hair, to catch them. On her way home, an owl, a bear and a panther each challenge her, and she <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> away some of her catch to get home. She also shares some fish with Mother Albirtha and takes the rest to her father, who gives them to the starving people in return for future payment. Strengthened by the fish, people begin working again. When the crisis is past Calpurnia searches for the river again, but cannot find it, as she no longer really needs it. Still, she realizes nothing is lost to us forever, and the book ends with one of her poems, expressing this sentiment:Secret River is in my mind.|$|E

25|$|If one adopts the {{classical}} {{point of view}} on categories, that there is a set of morphisms from one object to another (not just a class), then one <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> an additional argument to prove this. If, for example, the abelian category A is small, i.e. has only a set of objects, then this issue will be no problem. Also, if A is a Grothendieck abelian category, then the derived category D(A) is equivalent to a full subcategory of the homotopy category K(A), and hence has only a set of morphisms from one object to another. Grothendieck abelian categories include the category of modules over a ring, the category of sheaves of abelian groups on a topological space, and many other examples.|$|E
25|$|In 1970, R.A. Zimbardo {{viewed the}} play {{as full of}} symbols. The Moon and its phases alluded to in the play, in his view, stand for {{permanence}} in mutability. The play uses the principle of discordia concors in several of its key scenes. Theseus and Hippolyta represent marriage and, symbolically, the reconciliation of the natural seasons or the phases of time. Hippolyta's story arc is that she must submit to Theseus and become a matron. Titania <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up her motherly obsession with the changeling boy and passes through a symbolic death, and Oberon has to once again woo and win his wife. Kehler notes that Zimbardo took for granted the female subordination within the obligatory marriage, social views that were already challenged in the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|From {{the effort}} to resolve the {{conflicts}} brought about between love and reason there arises spiritual progress. As lower forms of love come in conflict with higher ones, human love is limited by many factors. Lust, greed and anger are limiting factors mentioned in many philosophies. The only hope of breaking these limits is {{the appearance of a}} pure form of love, called Divine love. This love can only arise through the grace of spiritual Masters. This is not a momentary event. The Avatar comes to awaken humanity to this higher love. An individual has to develop a conscious longing for this love and <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up all forms of desires except for the desire to attain it. In human love the duality of the lover and the Beloved persist. In Divine love, lover and Beloved are indivisibly one.|$|E

25|$|Living in Chadderton, Greater Manchester, Rachel Bailey is {{a detective}} constable on Syndicate 9, the Major Incident Team for Manchester Metropolitan Police. Upon the {{beginning}} of the first series, her lawyer boyfriend, Nicholas Savage (Rupert Graves), is revealed to be a philanderer, married with two sons in Wilmslow. Rachel, jeopardising her career, uses the Police National Computer (PNC) to locate the address his vehicle is registered to. Meanwhile, she discovers that she is pregnant with his child. Discovering his whereabouts, she reveals to Nick her plans to terminate her pregnancy and proceeds to blackmail him into allowing her to stay in his city centre apartment for free. Her personal and professional life becomes entangled when Savage is the defence barrister for Georgios Stelikos, a man on trial for murder and rape, at which Rachel <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> evidence. Savage uses information Rachel told him to his advantage, to which she denies. She later confides to Janet she perjured herself in court and that she had discussed details of the case to Nick. The jury finds Stelikos innocent, though the evidence points to the opposite. Savage, also upon seeing Rachel, realises that she has not gone through with the abortion, however, she later suffers a miscarriage. Nick's wife discovers his affair and telephones DCI Gill Murray (Amelia Bullmore), Rachel's boss. Murray quizzes Rachel regarding her relationship and whether it caused the collapse of the Stelikos case. She, taking Janet's advice, flatly denies the accusation. As Nick's wife knows of the affair, he evicts her from his apartment, as she has nothing to use against him. As there is no room at her sister Alison's (Sally Lindsay) home, stays with Janet until she can return to her old property.|$|E

No matter what ought to be the relations between such settlements and the aborigines, the fact is they do not get on together, and one or the other <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> way in the end. A system which looks to the extinction of a race is too abhorant for a Nation to indulge in without without entailing upon the wrath of all Christendom, and without engendering in the Citizen a disregard for human life, and the rights of others, dangerous to society. I see no remedy for this except in placing all the indians on large reservations...and giving them absolute protection there." ...|$|E

500|$|Initial work on Grand Theft Auto V {{constituted}} the open world creation, where preliminary models were constructed in-engine during pre-production. The game's setting is the fictional U.S. state of San Andreas and city of Los Santos, based on Southern California and Los Angeles respectively. San Andreas {{was first used}} as [...] setting, which featured three cities separated by open countryside. The team thought that the ambition of including three cities in San Andreas was too great, as it did not emulate the cities {{as well as they}} had hoped. Houser felt that [...] "to do a proper version of L.A....the game <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> you a sense of that sprawlif not completely replicate it", and that dividing the budget and manpower between multiple cities would have detracted from capturing [...] "what L.A. is". Garbut said that PlayStation 2 era technology lacked the technical capabilities to capture Los Angeles properly, such that San Andreas rendition of Los Santos looked like a [...] "backdrop or a game level with pedestrians randomly milling about". The team disregarded San Andreas as a departure point for Grand Theft Auto V because they had moved on to a new generation of consoles and wanted to build the city from scratch. According to Garbut, with the move to the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 hardware, [...] "our processes and the fidelity of the world [...] evolved so much from San Andreas" [...] that using it as a model would have been redundant. The team's focus on one city instead of three meant that they could produce Los Santos in higher quality and at greater scale than in the previous game.|$|E
