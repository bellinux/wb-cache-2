50|$|Before {{becoming}} a full length television documentary, Dinosaur! was a 1984 experimental sequence lasting ten minutes. Conceived and created by Phil Tippett {{with the help}} of Industrial Light & Magic stop-motion animators Randy Dutra (who made the dinosaur molds and skins) and Tom St. Amand (who made the <b>inner</b> <b>articulated</b> metallic skeletons of the dinosaurs), the sequence was titled Prehistoric Beast and tried to improve go motion animation special effects techniques. The story of the short was simple: the chase and predation of a Monoclonius by a Tyrannosaurus. This short animated movie was only released in specialized animation festivals, but it convinced Robert Guenette and Steven Paul Mark to request Tippett's skills in order to transform it into a full-length documentary. They then asked Tippett to realise new sequences with other dinosaur species, like Hadrosaurus, Deinonychus, Struthiomimus and Brontosaurus, with additional images of an asteroid, the one supposed to have crashed into the Earth, causing the dinosaur's extinction. Adding all this new material to the material from Prehistoric Beast resulted in the 1985 Dinosaur! documentary.|$|R

40|$|Ship tankers, used as {{floating}} {{oil storage}} and export units, {{are very sensitive}} to environmental conditions, and their position keeping during a loading operation may be a critical point. For relatively deep wells and harsh environments, the ship is moored at an <b>Articulated</b> Loading <b>Column</b> with a single point mooring system. Nevertheless, for assuring a better positioning and/or uninterrupted loading operations, tankers with additional dynamic positioning capability are employed. In this paper a hybrid control strategy for the ship dynamic positioning is proposed. The control aim is to reduce the plant capital and running costs, trying to pursue a tradeoff between the maximization of a safety index and the minimization of the control effort. For limiting the power peaks and the total energy spent during each loading operation, it is also planned to utilize the main propulsion system to counteract too severe weather conditions. Starting from almost realistic data for the tanker, the mooring, the flexible <b>articulated</b> loading <b>column</b> and the thrusters, and from a statistical characterization of the disturbances and the uncertain dynamics, some simulation results are produced to prove the energy efficiency and show the good performance of the designed controller...|$|R

40|$|This thesis investigates two {{slender body}} problems, namely the static and dynamic {{analysis}} of submarine pipeline spans and the dynamic analysis of marine risers. In view of structural and environmental similarities, {{these problems are}} closely related and where possible common analysis procedures have been developed. For the problem of pipe spanning, {{attention is focused on}} the possibility of vortex induced vibration and the associated question of span assessment. This situation arises when following the discovery of a span, an assess- ment is required to determine if any remedial repair work required. To assist in this assessment, and also to provide a more fundamental understanding of span behaviour, number of mathematical models are developed. First linear beam-column theory is used to determine the span natural frequencies and buckling load for a single span supported continuously on either side by an elastic foundation. The effects of internal/external pressures and product temperature are included and the results presented terms of two independent nondimensional parameters. Next the effects of pipe/soil friction and change in geometry are considered utilising a nonlinear Finite Element model. Theories are developed for a nonlinear pipe element with axial/bending coupling and a nonlinear nonconservative pipe/soil friction element. The effects of initial seabed geometry and finite amplitude vibration are included and it shown that span frequencies are sensitive to both end friction constraints and seabed geometry.. For marine riser dynamics, an attempt is made to synthesise the best parts from the many and varied analysis methods developed to date, into a simple but flexible design-orientated program. The riser is represented using a Finite Element model similar to that employed for the pipeline spans, and a reduced set of equations obtained using a component mode synthesis method. Several riser/ <b>articulated</b> <b>column</b> designs are considered and the results found to agree with published data...|$|R

50|$|Initially only {{available}} as a two-door saloon when launched in April 1971, a three-door hatchback, using an identical body profile but with a full-depth rear door and folding rear seat, was launched the following year. This was Fiat's first supermini-sized hatchback, along with a state-of-the-art transverse-engine/front-wheel-drive layout, with the transmission mounted {{on the end of}} the engine, both design ideas had been fully trialled since 1964, by Fiat's Autobianchi subsidiary with the Autobianchi Primula and 1969 Autobianchi A112 and A111. The 1969 Fiat 128 was the first Fiat badged car to use the same transverse powertrain layout. The 127 used, as the A112, a shrunken version of the 128 platform and the rugged Fiat OHV 100 series 903 cc engine, that had powered the Autobianchi and, with various cylinder capacities, earlier generations of Fiat cars. The 127 also featured a unique transverse leaf spring suspension at the rear. Safety was another area of innovation - the 127 included an <b>articulated</b> steering <b>column</b> and crumple zones for progressive deformation under impact.|$|R

The main facade is very elaborate with six pairs of <b>columns</b> <b>articulating</b> the ground floor and four pairs above them emphasise the main entrance.

[...] The upper floor began in 1744 by the architect Pedro Antonio Menéndez de Ambás and is distinguished by the Neo-Classical style, <b>articulated</b> with Ionic <b>columns</b> and rusticated blocks at the corners.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we present}} the {{characterization}} of soft pneumatic actuators currently under development for active soft orthotics. The actuators are tested statically and dynamically to characterize force and displacement properties needed for use in system design. They are shown to demonstrate remarkably repeatable performance, and very predictable behavior as actuator size (initial length) is varied to adjust total actuation. The results of the characterization are then used to inform design rules for selecting the size and number of actuators for a soft leg orthotic that can produce the force/moment/velocity properties required for a target wearer. The device was tested on a silicone model with <b>inner</b> frame and <b>articulated</b> ankle. Additionally, a portable pneumatic system was developed and characterized, that can actuate the pneumatic actuator over 800 times before refilling the gas supply.

50|$|On September 10, 1804 {{four members}} of the Lewis and Clark {{expedition}} recorded in their journals a fossil discovery {{along the banks of the}} Missouri River in what is now Gregory County of south-central South Dakota. The find was a 45-foot long <b>articulated</b> vertebral <b>column</b> with some ribs and teeth associated that was located at the top of a high ridge. The men interpreted the remains as originating from a giant fish, but today scientists think the specimen was probably a mosasaur, or maybe a plesiosaur. The expedition sent back some of the fossils, but these were later lost. Later, in 1847, Dr. Hiram A. Prout published a description of a fragmentary titanothere jaw discovered in the White River Badlands in the American Journal of Science. Not long afterward, Joseph Leidy described the Oligocene camel Poebrotherium, which was discovered in the same general region as Prout's titanothere jaw. The government responded to these discoveries by dispatching an expedition into the area. In 1850 the Smithsonian sent its own collectors into the area. The Tertiary deposits of the White River Badlands was active for decades and still ongoing in 1920 when the South Dakota School of Mines published its Bulletin No. 13. This publication summarized the results of all the paleontological fieldwork done in the White River Badlands. In 1877, the United States Geological Survey published a report on the ancient plants and invertebrates of South Dakota.|$|R
