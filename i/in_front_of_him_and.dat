Woody and Buzz then leave Sid's house just as Andy and his family drive away toward their new home.|$|E
5|$|For {{several years}} on the series, a {{defining}} characteristic of Todd's personality was his resistance to close relationships and sexual intimacy, which were due to his mistreatment by others, especially his adoptive father, who may have raped {{him when he was}} fourteen. It was also due to his horrific past misdeeds, including his rape of Marty and dysfunctional aspects of his relationship with Blair. Surviving a near-death experience and being presumed dead in 1995 and, upon his return in 1996, finding Blair having sex with Patrick made Todd bitter; seeing Blair with another man sexually, soon after his presumed death, caused him to shut down emotionally. The writers made Todd's fear of intimacy into a prominent obstacle for his relationship with his second wife, Téa. When she at one point attempts to seduce Todd by stripping down naked <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> pleading with him to make love to her, he rejects her, explaining that he no longer trusts himself to be intimate in that way; he subsequently throws her out, practically naked, into the middle of a snowstorm.|$|E
5|$|One month later, Johnson gained {{his first}} air victory. On 26 June Johnson participated in Circus 24. Crossing the coast near Gravelines, Bader warned of 24 Bf 109s nearby, southeast, {{in front of}} the Wing. The Bf 109s saw the British and turned to attack the lower No. 610 Squadron from the rear. While {{watching}} three Bf 109s above him dive to port, Johnson lost sight of his wing commander at 15,000 feet. Immediately a Bf 109E flew <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> turned slightly to port at a range of 150 yards. After receiving hits, the Bf 109's hood was jettisoned and the pilot baled out. Several No. 145 Squadron pilots witnessed the victory. He had expended 278 rounds from P7837's guns. The Bf 109 was one of five lost by Jagdgeschwader 2 (Fighter Wing 2) that day.|$|E

5|$|The Browns {{beat the}} Yankees in the {{eleventh}} {{game of the}} season. It {{was the first of}} three road games the Browns were scheduled to play in a span of eight days. The Browns opened the scoring early in the first quarter with a screen pass from Graham to Motley, who ran 78 yards for a touchdown. An interception by Parseghian on the Yankees' next possession set up another Browns touchdown, a one-yard run by Edgar Jones. The Yankees responded with two touchdowns of their own in the second quarter. The first was a long pass from Pete Layden to Bruce Alford early in the period. On Cleveland's next possession, Graham threw a pass to John Yonakor, but as Yonakor was waiting for the ball to arrive, New York's Otto Schnellbacher jumped <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> made an interception. Schnellbacher had a clear shot at Cleveland's end zone and ran it in for a touchdown that tied the game at 14 points. An interception by Yonakor later in the quarter set up a Groza field goal, and the Browns pulled away as halfback Bob Cowan ran for a touchdown and Groza added another field goal before halftime. Another touchdown by Motley in the third quarter put the Browns ahead by 20 points. The Yankees scored a final touchdown in the fourth quarter to cap a 45-yard drive, but the Browns won the game 34–21. Lavelli was hit in the eye early in the game and had to sit out. Tackle Chubby Grigg and Edgar Jones were also hurt in the game, adding to Cleveland's long list of injured players.|$|E
5|$|The safety {{cars were}} {{deployed}} {{to slow the}} race as marshals worked for twenty-two minutes to dry the spilled oil along the Mulsanne Straight. As the safety cars were recalled, Lotterer in the No. 7 Audi used slower traffic to pass both Porsche drivers <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> take over the race lead, just as Nico Hülkenberg moved to fourth place by passing the remaining Audi cars. In the LMP2 category the safety car had split the field up, leaving the TDS Racing and KCMG Oreca-Nissan cars forty seconds ahead of their class rivals. Richard Bradley for KCMG was able to fight with TDS Racing's Tristan Gommendy on the restart and eventually retake the class lead it had lost at the race start. Lotterer was later forced {{to give up the}} race lead as a puncture on one of the No. 7's tyres required an extra pit stop, allowing Hartley's No. 17 Porsche {{to the front of the}} race. Duval was caught on an approach to a slow zone (which was enforced to allow a marshal to retrieve debris at Indianapolis) by a group of slowed LMGTE cars and took avoiding action by steering right into the grass off track. The No. 8 Audi clipped the No. 51 AF Corse Ferrari's right-hand section and was thrown back sideways across the track, impacting the outside barriers head on heavily driving into Indianapolis corner and ripping the car's front bodywork off. Safety cars were required once again as the barriers needed lengthy repairs, while Duval was able to drive the damaged Audi back to the garage. Repairs took less than five minutes and the car resumed in eighth place.|$|E

25|$|Jean-Pierre Firmin Malher formed his 3rd Division of the VI Corps {{into three}} columns and marched south on 9 October.

25|$|His journey {{started when}} {{he studied the}} Qur'an in a literal way, and he slowly began to {{understand}} the principles lined in the religion. Then something happened to him in America to remove his doubts. He says; {{that while he was}} going to America, he was on the boat (ferry), and he saw the way the boat he was travelling in – was rocking in the huge sea – all under the control of Allah without it sinking or capsizing. At that point he realized the power of Allah. He said Iman (belief) entered into his heart due to this. His second scenario was in San Francisco, when he went on top of a mountain, and he could see the whole of creation <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> he realized the beauty and harmony that existed amongst the creation as a whole. He said that, the sweetness of Iman hit him.|$|E

25|$|The {{siege of}} Jerusalem in 597BCE {{led to the}} city being {{overcome}} by the Babylonians, who then took the young King Jehoiachin into Babylonian captivity, together {{with most of the}} aristocracy. Zedekiah, who had been placed on the throne by Nebuchadnezzar (the Babylonian king), rebelled, and Nebuchadnezzar, who at the time (587/586BCE) was ruler of a most powerful empire, recaptured the city, killed Zedekiah's descendants <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> plucked out Zedekiah's eyes so that that would be the last thing he ever saw. The Babylonians then took Zedekiah into captivity, along with prominent members of Judah. The Babylonians then burnt the temple, destroyed the city's walls, and appointed Gedaliah son of Achikam as governor of Judah. After 52 days of rule, Yishmael, son of Netaniah, a surviving descendant of Zedekiah, assassinated Gedaliah after encouragement by Baalis, the king of Ammon. Some of the remaining population of Judah, fearing the vengeance of Nebuchadnezzar, fled to Egypt.|$|E
25|$|Although {{playing with}} a suspect knee for his last few seasons at Richmond, Swift always gave his best; and, {{considering}} his knee problems, he had a surprising turn of speed. He ended his career at full-back, having played as a half-forward flanker and ruck-rover for his last few seasons, and only moving to full-back {{in the last half}} of his last season, in place of the injured Mick Erwin. Jack Dyer had suggested the move, {{on the basis of his}} own experience with a similar sort of knee injury, Dyer argued that, of all the positions on the field, full-back was the best for Swift, because he would have almost all of his play <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> almost all of his running would be straight ahead, with a minimum of turns and sideways movement. In his first full match in 1967 at full-back, in round 16 (16 August 1967), against Hawthorn, at Glenferrie Oval, despite fears that he was too short to play against Hawthorn's champion full-forward, Peter Hudson, who was 3½ inches taller, Swift held Hudson to three goals, and Richmond won the match, thrashing Hawthorn 23.30 (168) to 7.12 (54).|$|E

He had wanted her {{to go back to a}} normal girl's life after she had gotten her revenge because of the brutality of the life of a samurai.

When he was 17, a woman he rejected attempted suicide <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> Okita came to the conclusion that falling in love was not worth such pain, and he has kept his distance from women ever since. Another hindrance to romance is that he has dedicated his life to the path of the samurai and has vowed to himself that he will never marry. The character is based on the historical figure of Okita Sōji.|$|E

25|$|Starman is {{sent into}} space {{to search for}} Alan, and finds that Alan has {{constructed}} a massive fortress {{on the surface of}} the moon. Before Starman can warn the others, Alan appears <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> tears his gem, the source of his abilities, from his chest, thus rendering him powerless. The Starheart uses its influence to corrupt various metahumans with magical or elemental abilities, which creates chaos across the globe. Realizing that the heroes must defeat Alan in order to end the chaos, Batman recruits Miss Martian to get a mental lock on Starman, which, in turn, provides the Justice League with Alan's location. Batman then assembles a small strikeforce consisting of himself, Jade, Hourman, Donna Troy, Jesse Quick, and Mr. America, all of whom have a low chance of being possessed by the Starheart. Mister Miracle arrives and informs the team that Alan has most likely installed Fourth World defenses in his base and offers to use his knowledge of such technology to guide them through the fortress. When they finally find him, Jade uses her powers to restore Alan to normal. With his sanity restored, Alan chooses to allow the Emerald City he created on the moon to stay, and the city becomes populated by various magical creatures from throughout the DCU.|$|E
