The asymmetrical high-contrast graphic around the ball creates an optimal flicker as the ball rotates for a more powerful visual signal, allowing the player to more easily identify and track the ball.|$|E

40|$|In reliability-based <b>durability</b> design <b>of</b> {{reinforced}} concrete (RC) structures, the depassivation of reinforcing steels is often taken as the durability limit state, {{and the target}} reliability index is a key parameter controlling the long-term <b>durability</b> performance <b>of</b> RC members. This study investigates the impact of target reliability <b>of</b> <b>durability</b> design in design phase on the life-cycle performance and the maintenance cost of RC structures. For this purpose, a chloride diffusion model for steel depassivation of RC members is firstly established; and then the cost models for maintenance of RC beam members are proposed. Based on the detailed section design and the <b>durability</b> limit state <b>of</b> steel depassivation, Monte-Carlo simulation {{is used to calculate}} the reliability index for the <b>durability</b> design <b>of</b> RC beam members; and then according to the defined maintenance inventions and associated costs, the maintenance costs for the whole service life are evaluated for different durability reliability indices. Finally, the impact of target reliability <b>of</b> <b>durability</b> design on the deterioration process and the maintenance cost is discussed...|$|R

5|$|Carpentier’s {{historical}} {{account is}} greatly simplified {{in order to}} increase the contrast between the white land owners and their black slaves. The marvellous, one of the most notable features of the novel, is used as a marker of contrast between the two groups: firstly, because mention of the magical always takes the form of the slaves' point of view, while the more real interpretation of each event is from the whites' perspective; secondly, because the marvellous is used as a weapon to fight injustice. Instances of cruelty and violence between the groups are recounted grotesquely in great detail, which enhances the rivalry. More importantly, by allowing readers to see through the slaves' point of view, Carpentier brings to light the power and <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> the Haitian community and destabilizes the narrative of Western supremacy.|$|E
5|$|The {{strength}} or <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> heavy metals such as chromium, iron, nickel, copper, zinc, molybdenum, tin, tungsten, and lead, {{as well as}} their alloys, makes them useful for the manufacture of artefacts such as tools, machinery, appliances, utensils, pipes, railroad tracks, buildings and bridges, automobiles, locks, furniture, ships, planes, coinage and jewellery. They are also used as alloying additives for enhancing the properties of other metals. Of the two dozen elements that have been used in the world's monetised coinage only two, carbon and aluminium, are not heavy metals. Gold, silver, and platinum are used in jewellery as are (for example) nickel, copper, indium, and cobalt in coloured gold. Low-cost jewellery and children's toys may be made, to a significant degree, of heavy metals such as chromium, nickel, cadmium, or lead.|$|E

5|$|The current match {{ball for}} the Recopa Sudamericana, {{manufactured}} by Nike, is named the Total 90 Omni CSF. It {{is one of}} the many balls produced by the American sports equipment maker for CONMEBOL, replacing the Mercurial Veloci Hi-Vis in 2009. The ball, approved by FIFA and weighing approximately 422 g, has a spherical shape that allows the ball to fly faster, farther, and more accurately. According to Nike, the ball's geometric precision distributes pressure evenly across panels and around the ball. The compressed polyethylene layer stores energy from impact and releases it at launch, and the 6-wing carbon-latex air chamber improves acceleration. Another feature of the ball is its rubber layer; it was designed to allow a better response while retaining the impact energy and releases it in the coup. Its support material of cross-linked nitrogen-expanded foam improves its retention and <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> its shape. Polyester support fabric enhances structure and stability.

5|$|Throughout {{the history}} of fabric {{production}} natural dyes {{have been used to}} apply a form of colour, with dyes from plants, including indigo from Woad, having dozens of compounds whose proportions may vary according to soil type and climate; therefore giving rise to variations in shade. In the case of the Saltire, variations in shades of blue have resulted in the background of the flag ranging from sky blue to navy blue. When incorporated as part of the Union Flag during the 17th century, the dark blue applied to Union Flags destined for maritime use was possibly {{selected on the basis of}} the <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> darker dyes, with this dark blue shade eventually becoming standard on Union Flags both at sea and on land. Some flag manufacturers selected the same navy blue colour trend of the Union Flag for the Saltire itself, leading to a variety of shades of blue being depicted on the flag of Scotland.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Tunnel and {{underground}} engineering {{projects have}} certain failure risks during construction and operation, including the risk <b>of</b> <b>durability</b> failure {{to which the}} study is not enough. In this paper, {{a whole set of}} research method for analysis, assessment and calculation on durability risk was proposed on the basis <b>of</b> identification to <b>durability</b> risk factors <b>of</b> large underground concrete structures. That is: this paper provided a method of reliability calculation by establishing failure mode and limit-state-equations according to reliability theory; then, classified and collated various risk factors by taking methods of analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and fault tree analysis (FTA); after that, the quantitative analysis <b>of</b> structural <b>durability</b> was done in accordance with Monte- Carlo (M-C) method. Finally, as an example, for the project of passage across the Yangtze River in Chongming, Shanghai, the above methods were applied to estimate the risk <b>of</b> <b>durability</b> failure <b>of</b> segment component.
