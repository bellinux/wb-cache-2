5|$|TBI is {{frequently}} difficult to diagnose and treat. Early diagnosis {{is important to}} prevent complications, which include stenosis (narrowing) of the airway, respiratory tract infection, and damage to the lung tissue. Diagnosis involves procedures such as bronchoscopy, radiography, and x-ray computed tomography to visualize the tracheobronchial tree. Signs and symptoms vary based on the location and severity of the injury; they commonly include dyspnea (difficulty breathing), <b>dysphonia</b> (a condition where the voice can be hoarse, weak, or excessively breathy), coughing, and abnormal breath sounds. In the emergency setting, tracheal intubation {{can be used to}} ensure that the airway remains open. In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to repair a TBI.|$|E
5|$|According to Twain, {{she became}} {{depressed}} and lost {{her desire to}} live after the divorce. As a distraction, she began to write a memoir, titled From This Moment On after the 1998 song of the same name. She then re-evaluated her life and noted a pattern of withholding emotions, which affected her voice for both speaking and singing. She explained {{the loss of her}} voice resulted from the cumulative stress of experiencing domestic violence in her childhood, the death of her parents, stress from her musical career, and the divorce. As a result, the singer developed <b>dysphonia,</b> an impairment in the ability to produce sound because of tightened muscles enveloping her voice box. In order to recover, Twain embarked on a documented journey with the series Why Not? with Shania Twain. Twain's wanted go outside her comfort zone and perform once again, while inspiring viewers to be proactive about their own problems.|$|E
5|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} {{vary depending on}} {{what part of the}} tracheobronchial tree is injured and how severely it is damaged. There are no direct signs of TBI, but certain signs suggest the injury and raise a clinician's suspicion that it has occurred. Many of the signs {{and symptoms}} are also present in injuries with similar injury mechanisms such as pneumothorax. Dyspnea and respiratory distress are found in 76–100% of people with TBI, and coughing up blood has been found in up to 25%. However, isolated TBI does not usually cause profuse bleeding; if such bleeding is observed {{it is likely to be}} due to another injury such as a ruptured large blood vessel. The patient may exhibit <b>dysphonia</b> or have diminished breath sounds, and rapid breathing is common. Coughing may be present, and stridor, an abnormal, high-pitched breath sound indicating obstruction of the upper airway can also occur.|$|E

25|$|Goitre (enlarged thyroid). If {{the thyroid}} grows large enough, it may {{compress}} the recurrent laryngeal nerve, producing vocal cord paralysis, <b>dysphonia,</b> and even respiratory stridor. Compression of the sympathetic chain {{may result in}} Horner's syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Laryngeal {{dystonia}} or spasmodic <b>dysphonia</b> {{results from}} abnormal contraction of {{muscles in the}} voice box, resulting in altered voice production. Patients may have a strained-strangled quality to their voice or, in some cases, a whispering or breathy quality.|$|E
25|$|In February 2012, {{following}} a doctor's visit, vocalist Kyo {{was diagnosed with}} vocal nodule <b>dysphonia,</b> leading to Dir En Grey {{pulling out of the}} North American The Still Reckless Tour consisting of Asking Alexandria, Trivium, Motionless in White, and I See Stars. Although Kyo had been hospitalized before in 2006 and 2009 for vocal inflammation, he had not required surgery until this time. Kyo later stated that his condition was treated with medication.|$|E
25|$|SS {{can damage}} vital organs {{of the body}} with {{symptoms}} that may plateau or worsen, or go into remission as with other autoimmune diseases. Some people may experience only the mild symptoms of dry eyes and mouth, while others have symptoms of severe disease. Many patients can treat problems symptomatically. Others are forced to cope with blurred vision, constant eye discomfort, recurrent mouth infections, swollen parotid glands, <b>dysphonia</b> (vocal disorders including hoarseness), and difficulty in swallowing and eating. Debilitating fatigue and joint pain can seriously impair quality of life. Some patients can develop renal (kidney) involvement (autoimmune tubulointerstitial nephritis) leading to proteinuria (excess protein in urine), urinary concentrating defect, and distal renal tubular acidosis.|$|E

In 2005 Morris noticed {{the effects of}} a health disorder, spasmodic <b>dysphonia,</b> which affects both her {{speaking}} and singing voice. Subsequently, she has stopped publicly singing and in October 2015 appeared on Australian Story episode [...] "Raise Your Voice" [...] to publicise the disorder.|$|E

2500|$|Audio Adrenaline is a Christian {{rock band}} that {{formed in the}} mid 1980s at Kentucky Christian University in Grayson, Kentucky. The band gained {{recognition}} during the 1990s and received two Grammy Awards and multiple Dove Awards. [...] Audio Adrenaline were regular performers at the annual Creation Festival, Spirit West Coast festival, Agape Music Festival, and Alive Festival. In 2006, the group disbanded due to lead singer Mark Stuart's spasmodic <b>dysphonia.</b> During this time, they released eight studio albums.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{the root}} of the problem is neurological, doctors have {{explored}} sensorimotor retraining activities to enable the brain to [...] "rewire" [...] itself and eliminate dystonic movements. The work of several doctors such as Nancy Byl and Joaquin Farias has shown that sensorimotor retraining activities and proprioceptive stimulation can induce neuroplasticity, making it possible for patients to recover substantial function that was lost due to Cervical Dystonia, hand dystonia, blepharospasm, oromandibular dystonia, <b>dysphonia</b> and musicians' dystonia.|$|E
2500|$|Any {{injury to}} human vocal folds elicits a wound healing process {{characterized}} by disorganized collagen deposition and, eventually, formation of scar tissue. Verdolini and her group sought {{to detect and}} describe acute tissue response of injured rabbit VF model. They quantified the expression of two biochemical markers: interleukin 1 and prostaglandin E2, which are associated with acute wound healing. They found the secretions of these inflammatory mediators were significantly elevated when collected from injured VF versus normal VF. This result was consistent with their previous study about the function of [...] IL-1 [...] and PGE-2 in wound healing. Investigation about the temporal and magnitude of inflammatory response in VFs may benefit for elucidating subsequent pathological events in vocal fold wounding, which is good for clinician to develop therapeutic targets to minimize scar formation. In the proliferative phase of VFs wound healing, if the production of HA and collagen is not balanced, which means the HA level is lower than normal, the fibrosis of collagen cannot be regulated. Consequently, regenerative-type wound healing turns to be the formation of scar. Scarring {{may lead to the}} deformity of vocal fold edge, the disruption of LPs viscosity and stiffness. Patients suffering from vocal fold scar complain about increased phonatory effort, vocal fatigue, breathlessness, and <b>dysphonia.</b> Vocal fold scar {{is one of the most}} challenging problems for otolaryngologists because it’s hard to be diagnosed at germinal stage and the function necessity of VF is delicate.|$|E
50|$|The {{three types}} of spasmodic <b>dysphonia</b> (SD) are {{adductor}} spasmodic <b>dysphonia,</b> abductor spasmodic <b>dysphonia</b> and mixed spasmodic <b>dysphonia.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Dysphonia</b> can be {{categorized}} into two broad main types: organic and functional. The type of <b>dysphonia</b> {{is dependent on the}} cause of the pathology. While the causes of <b>dysphonia</b> can be divided into five basic categories, all of them result in an interruption of the ability of the vocal folds to vibrate normally during exhalation, which affects the voice. The assessment and diagnosis of <b>dysphonia</b> is done by a multidisciplinary team, and involves the use of a variety of subjective and objective measures, which look at both the quality of the voice as well as the physical state of the larynx. Multiple treatments have been developed to address organic and functional causes of <b>dysphonia.</b> <b>Dysphonia</b> can be targeted through direct therapy, indirect therapy, medical treatments, and surgery. Functional dysphonias may be treated through direct and indirect voice therapies, whereas surgeries are recommended for chronic, organic dysphonias.|$|E
50|$|Mixed spasmodic <b>dysphonia</b> {{involves}} both {{muscles that}} open the vocal folds {{and those that}} close them and therefore has features of both adductor and abductor spasmodic <b>dysphonia.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Voice {{disorders}} can {{be divided}} into 2 broad categories: organic and functional. The distinction between these broad classes stems from their cause, whereby organic <b>dysphonia</b> results from some sort of physiological change in one of the subsystems of speech (for voice, usually respiration, laryngeal anatomy, and/or other parts of the vocal tract are affected). Conversely, functional <b>dysphonia</b> refers to hoarseness resulting from vocal use (i.e. overuse/abuse). Furthermore, according to ASHA, organic <b>dysphonia</b> can be subdivided into structural and neurogenic; neurogenic <b>dysphonia</b> is defined as impacted functioning of the vocal structure due to a neurological problem (in the central nervous system or peripheral nervous system); in contrast, structural <b>dysphonia</b> is defined as impacted functioning of the vocal mechanism that is caused by some sort of physical change (e.g. a lesion on the vocal folds). Notably, an additional subcategory of functional <b>dysphonia</b> recognized by professionals is psychogenic <b>dysphonia,</b> which can be defined as a type of voice disorder that has no known cause and can be presumed to be a product of some sort of psychological stressors in one’s environment. It {{is important to note that}} these types are not mutually exclusive and much overlap occurs. For example, Muscle Tension <b>Dysphonia</b> (MTD) has been found to be a result of many different causes including the following: MTD in the presence of an organic pathology (i.e. organic type), MTD stemming from vocal use (i.e. functional type), and MTD as a result of personality and/or psychological factors (i.e. psychogenic type).|$|E

50|$|Up to now, {{prevalence}} studies investigating {{rates of}} <b>dysphonia</b> on a large-scale level have been limited. According {{to a large}} sample of 55 million patients seeking health-care treatment in the United States, <b>dysphonia</b> {{can be found in}} approximately 1% of the population. Higher rates are reported in females and elderly adults, however, <b>dysphonia</b> can be found in both sexes and across age groups. It is proposed that higher rates in females are due to anatomical differences of the vocal mechanism.|$|E

5000|$|A {{variety of}} {{different}} cause, which result in abnormal vibrations of the vocal folds, can cause <b>dysphonia.</b> These causes can range from vocal abuse and misuse to systemic diseases.

50|$|Voice therapy {{appears to}} be {{ineffective}} in cases of true spasmodic <b>dysphonia,</b> however as {{it is difficult to}} distinguish between spasmodic <b>dysphonia</b> and functional dysphonias and misdiagnosis is relatively common, a trial of voice therapy is often recommended before more invasive procedures are tried. Some also state that it is useful for mild symptoms and as an add-on to botox therapy and others report success in more severe cases.|$|E

50|$|Diarrhea, hypertension, fatigue, {{decreased}} appetite, nausea, <b>dysphonia,</b> hand-foot syndrome, weight decreased, vomiting, asthenia, and constipation are {{the most}} common side effects occurring in more than 20% of patients.|$|E
50|$|Voice {{disorders}} {{range from}} aphonia (loss of phonation) to <b>dysphonia,</b> {{which may be}} phonatory and/or resonance disorders. Phonatory characteristics could include breathiness, hoarseness, harshness, intermittency, pitch, etc. Resonance characteristics refer to overuse or underuse of the resonance chambers resulting in hypernasality or hyponasality. Several examples of voice problems are vocal chord nodules or polyps, vocal chord paralysis, paradoxical vocal fold movement, and spasmodic <b>dysphonia.</b> Vocal chord nodules and polyps are different phenomena, but both {{may be caused by}} vocal abuse, and both may take the form of growths, bumps, or swelling on the vocal chords. Vocal fold paralysis is the inability to move {{one or both of the}} vocal chords, which results in difficulties with voice and perhaps swallowing. Paradoxical vocal fold movement occurs when the vocal chords close when they should actually be open. Spasmodic <b>dysphonia</b> is caused by strained vocal chord movement, which results in awkward voice problems, such as jerkiness or quavering.|$|E
