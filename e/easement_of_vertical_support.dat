40|$|Conference ABSTRACT: In {{the recent}} past {{a number of issues}} {{regarding}} the seismic performance of typical existing hollowcore floor systems have been raised. The most concerning of these is the vulnerability to loss <b>of</b> <b>vertical</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> the floor system at the end floor to seating beam connection. This vulnerability arises due to incompatibilities between the floor system and intrinsic deformations of the neighbouring seismic frames. In a previous contribution by the authors (Jensen et al 2006), a conceptual retrofit strategy for existing hollowcore seating connections was proposed. This paper provides an experimental validation of that strategy through quasi-static cyclic testing of alternative seating connection configurations, adopting varying seating lengths. In general, unfavourable performance was exhibited by the existing seating connections, resulting in loss <b>of</b> <b>vertical</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> the hollowcore unit. In contrast, when additional seating and selective weakening retrofit approaches were implemented, a higher level of seismic performance leading to collapse prevention was achieved. In conclusion, issues and uncertainties associated with the evaluation of the likely failure mechanism, as well as the definition of an appropriate retrofit intervention are discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{identification}} of tensile membrane {{action as a}} sustainable, high-capacity load-bearing mechanism of composite floors under fire conditions {{has led to the}} development of a number of simplified design solutions, because of the unsuitability of finite element analysis for routine design. Prominent amongst these is the Bailey-BRE method, which predicts composite slab capacity by calculating the enhancement of its traditional yield-line load capacity due to tensile membrane action. This method assumes that the two-way bending slab panel, composed internally of parallel unprotected composite beams, is supported on edges which resist vertical deflection. In practice, the protected composite beams which simulate this <b>vertical</b> edge <b>support</b> in fire deflect under the combination of heating and load, and this loss <b>of</b> <b>vertical</b> <b>support</b> induces single-curvature bending, which leads to an eventual structural failure by folding of the slab panel.

40|$|AbstractOn {{the basis}} of a series of the {{full-scale}} fire tests carried out on the composite frame at Cardington, a design method is now well established to calculate the performance of composite flooring systems subject to fire. The method models in a simplified fashion the influence of tensile membrane action in composite floor slabs which are formed as an array of composite beams using solid-web steel downstand beams which are largely unprotected. The development of membrane action depends on the conditions <b>of</b> <b>vertical</b> <b>support</b> maintained around the boundaries of the fire-affected slab panels by protected beams. Cellular beams can achieve the same strength as unperforated I-beams of the same depth, with significantly reduced steel mass, and the ability to accommodate service ducts within the beam depth, and therefore the use of composite cellular beams as floor members is becoming increasingly popular in construction. Due to the general lack of research on perforated sections, the guidance about their design for fire conditions remains rather primitive. Moreover, tensile membrane action in composite floor slabs with cellular steel downstand beams could exhibit very different behaviour in fire from that when solid-web sections are used. A parametric study has been carried out as an initial investigation into the fire performance of cellular beams within composite slab systems, including the effects of tensile membrane action in enhancing the load-carrying capacity. The effects of changes to the edge support conditions are also investigated. The results show the protected perimeter beams maintained their load-carrying capacity and were subject only to small vertical displacements, although web-post buckling was observed to occur on the protected secondary beam near to a support. This suggests that maintenance <b>of</b> <b>vertical</b> <b>support</b> is not sufficient for a slab panel with cellular beams. Web-post buckling or the Vierendeel mechanism may govern the mode of structural failure, indicating that the sizes of openings and their positioning necessitate careful design...|$|R

A steel arch with a span of 163’ (49.5m) supports steel stress ribbons and precast concrete planks over the river complementing the adjacent historic Lancaster Avenue vehicular bridge. The arch spans the entire river and the steel stress ribbons rest upon the arch. The minimal sag profile of the stressed ribbons creates major tension loads which are balanced against the thrust loading in the opposite direction caused by the steel arch. The balancing of these opposing loads minimizes the required size of the foundations. Pre-fabricated concrete planks have been anchored directly to the steel stress ribbons to form the bridge walkway, eliminating the need for temporary scaffolding in the river and on the adjacent shorelines.

40|$|It is well {{recognised}} by earthquake engineers {{that there}} is a strong correlation between the seismic performance <b>of</b> <b>vertical</b> <b>supports</b> (columns and walls) in reinforced concrete (RC) buildings and the axial load acting on them. However, review of the literature has revealed that axial load ratios (ALRs) of a value lower than 0. 2 were often assumed in theoretical and experimental studies. Following the common local engineering practices, the present study shows that wall elements that are commonly part of the lateral load resisting system in buildings can have an ALR as high as 0. 4 or more, especially when the push-and-pull effects due to lateral loads (seismic or wind) are considered. This paper focuses on the determination of the ALR of the medium-rise structural wall buildings in Hong Kong, one of the most commonly used structural forms of residential buildings in the territory.

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{was part of}} a greater research initiative regarding the seismic vulnerability of precast hollowcore floor systems. The primary focus throughout the research programme has been to investigate the susceptibility to loss <b>of</b> <b>vertical</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> the floor system, from the seating beam. Previous research firstly focussed on identifying and understanding preconceived deficiencies with existing seating connection details. This was followed by the validation of amended, superior performing, 'new' seating connection details. However, little consideration has been given to retrofit techniques for already existing buildings, with potentially poor performing existing seating connections. A two-dimensional, single hollowcore unit, seating connection sub-assembly is used to experimentally investigate the seismic behaviour of previously un-tested existing seating connections pre- and post-retrofit. Three existing seating connection configurations, with the hollowcore unit seated directly on the bare concrete seating ledge and with varying seating lengths were tested. These tests were followed by a fourth retrofitted specimen. Both relative rotation between the hollowcore unit and seating beam, and beam elongation 'pull-off' deformations (resulting from the supporting frame deformations) were imposed on the test specimens. In conjunction with this experimental investigation and with prior knowledge from previous investigations, three primary failure mechanisms for existing hollowcore seating connections are summarised. A suite of conceptual retrofit techniques which target the critical structural weaknesses attributed to causing the primary failure mechanisms are outlined. In general, unfavourable performance was exhibited by the existing seating connections in the experimental investigation, resulting in loss <b>of</b> <b>vertical</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> the hollowcore unit under imposed 'pull-off' effects. In contrast, when the retrofit strategy was implemented, a higher level of seismic performance, leading to collapse prevention was achieved. A review is carried out into existing beam elongation numerical models, which are simple and involve only hand-type calculation procedures. The aim of this was to investigate potential methods for predicting the 'pull-off' effects on suspended floor systems. From this, a modification is made to an existing, loading dependent method developed by Matthews (2004). The modified method aimed to more accurately represent the loading dependant nature of beam elongation (and the resulting 'pull-off' effects) as described by Lee and Watanabe (2003). A number of beam elongation predictions for a suite of experimental beam elongation data sets were carried out with the modified method. Good agreement was generally seen, both in terms of prediction of the magnitude of elongation and the shape of the elongation profile...|$|R

40|$|Sandwich panel {{structures}} {{are widely used}} in aerospace, marine, and automotive applications because of their high flexural stiffness, strength-to-weight ratio, good vibration damping, and low through-thickness thermal conductivity. These structures consist of solid face sheets and low-density cellular core structures, which are often based upon honeycomb topologies. The recent progress of additive manufacturing (AM) (popularly known as 3 D printing) processes has allowed lattice configurations to be designed with improved thermal-mechanical properties. The aim of this work is to design and print lattice truss structures (LTS) keeping in mind the flexible nature of AM. Several 3 D printed core structures were created using polymeric material and were tested under low-velocity impact loads. Different unit-cell configurations were compared to aluminum honeycomb cores that are tested under the same conditions. An impact machine was designed and fabricated following the ASTM D 7136 Standard to correctly capture the impact response. The absorption energy {{as well as the}} failure mechanisms of lattice cells under such loads are investigated. The differences in energy-absorption capabilities were captured by integrating the load-displacement curve found from the impact response. Similar manufacturing and sandwich-panel-fabrication processes must be used to accurately compare the impact responses. It is observed that selective placement <b>of</b> <b>vertical</b> <b>support</b> struts in the unit-cell results in an increase in the absorption energy of the sandwich panels. Other unit-cell configurations can be designed with different arrangements <b>of</b> <b>vertical</b> struts into the well-known body centered cubic (BCC) LTS for further improvements in absorption energy capabilities...|$|R

This paper presents a physical study <b>of</b> <b>vertical</b> <b>supported</b> two-dimensional plunging jets using a relatively large-size facility. The air-water flow and turbulence properties were measured with an intrusive phase-detection probe and a total pressure sensor simultaneously. The inflow pre-aeration and turbulence level of the falling jet were carefully characterised, and the effects of jet impact velocity and jet length on air entrainment in plunging pool were investigated. The experimental results were systematically compared to relevant studies. A discussion was developed on the quantification of turbulence intensity in highly-aerated flow based on total pressure measurement. The flow turbulence properties were derived respectively from the interfacial phase-detection signals and total pressure signals. The results highlighted difference in terms of the turbulence intensities between interfacial motions and water-phase turbulence. The present work showed that the jet impact velocity, jet length, inflow disturbance and pre-entrainment of air had considerable effects on air entrainment capacity and subsurface air-water flow properties in plunging jets hence should be carefully characterised in relevant studies...|$|R
