500|$|Jerry's parents, Helen (Liz Sheridan) and Morty Seinfeld, {{are staying}} at Jerry's {{apartment}} in New York City, making themselves at home. He bursts in, wearing baseball clothes, carrying a bat and glove, and proudly tells them that during his softball game, [...] "I made an incredible {{play in the}} field! There was a tag-up at third base and I threw the <b>guy</b> <b>out</b> from left field on a fly! We'll be {{in the championship game}} Wednesday because of me. It was the single greatest moment in my life." ...|$|E
500|$|Capel {{was born}} on October 13, 1961, in Marshall, Texas, and {{attended}} Spring High School in Harris County. As a child, he enjoyed watching the Astros play on weekends. During his senior year in 1979, the Spring Lions won the AAAA conference state championship, and Capel {{was named to the}} All-State team, composed of the best high school players in the state. He set several pitching records at Spring High School. Future teammate Calvin Schiraldi called Capel a [...] "hard thrower when he came out of high school" [...] and [...] "the top <b>guy</b> <b>out</b> of the state in 1980"; Roger Clemens said he was [...] "probably the best pitcher in the state at that time". The Philadelphia Phillies drafted Capel with the 605th overall pick in the 1980 MLB Draft, but instead of signing with the Phillies, he chose to attend the University of Texas.|$|E
500|$|A March 1969 {{meeting between}} Slayton, George Low, Bob Gilruth, and Chris Kraft {{determined}} that Armstrong {{would be the}} first person on the Moon, in some part because NASA management saw Armstrong as a person who did not have a large ego. A press conference held on April 14, 1969, gave the design of the LM cabin as the reason for Armstrong's being first; the hatch opened inwards and to the right, making it difficult for the lunar module pilot, on the right-hand side, to exit first. Slayton added, [...] "Secondly, just on a pure protocol basis, I figured the commander ought to be the first <b>guy</b> <b>out...</b> I changed it as soon as I found they had the time line that showed that. Bob Gilruth approved my decision." [...] At the time of their meeting, the four men did not know about the hatch consideration. The first knowledge of the meeting outside the small group came when Kraft wrote his 2001 autobiography.|$|E

500|$|McElhenny {{was also}} an asset in the {{receiving}} game, becoming a favorite target of quarterback Y. A. Tittle on screen passes. His versatility drew praise from opposing coaches, including George Halas of the Chicago Bears and Steve Owen of the New York Giants. Former Bears quarterback Johnny Lujack lauded McElhenny as [...] "the best running back I have seen in a long, long time." [...] Also noted was his vision; he had an uncanny ability of seeing and reacting to tacklers in his peripheral vision. [...] "If you ever watched McElhenny", explained Washington State coach Jim Sutherland, [...] "you'd think he had eyes {{on the back of}} his head. I've seen him cut away from a tackler that 99 percent of the backs wouldn't even have seen. It wasn't instinct—he just saw the <b>guy,</b> <b>out</b> of the corner of his eye." [...] McElhenny described his playing style as such: [...] "My attitude carrying the ball was fear—not a fear of getting hurt but a fear of getting caught from behind and taken down and embarrassing myself and my teammates." ...|$|E
500|$|Strasburg {{had hoped}} to attend Stanford University but was not {{accepted}} there. Although recruited {{by a number of}} schools across the country, he enrolled at San Diego State University, where both of his parents attended school. He played college baseball for the San Diego State Aztecs, coached by the late Baseball Hall of Fame inductee Tony Gwynn. When he first arrived, he was an unlikely candidate to pitch collegiate baseball at all; he was so overweight and out of shape that his conditioning coach nicknamed him [...] "Slothburg" [...] and encouraged him to quit baseball. He also had a difficult time adjusting to college life, moving out of his dormitory and in with his mother after five days. He acknowledged, [...] "I wasn't the most mature <b>guy</b> <b>out</b> of high school. … The dorm was an overload, too much, too soon." [...] Strasburg responded with an intense workout regimen, losing [...] in the process. He also worked to improve his mental toughness. Coaches tested him by placing him in high-pressure situations and telling him he needed to get strikeouts.|$|E
2500|$|Performing in Westerns was {{a return}} {{to what he had}} done earlier in his career, and McCrea enjoyed the genre. [...] In a 1978 interview, he said: I liked doing comedies, but as I got older I was better suited to do Westerns. Because I think it becomes un{{attractive}} for an older fellow trying to look young, falling in love with attractive girls in those kinds of situations...Anyway, I always felt so much more comfortable in the Western. The minute I got a horse and a hat and a pair of boots on, I felt easier. I didn't feel like I was an actor anymore. I felt like I was the <b>guy</b> <b>out</b> there doing it.|$|E

2500|$|On December 2, 2013, Christie {{said at a}} {{press conference}} that Democrats were just playing {{politics}} by holding hearings into lane closures. [...] "Just because [...] John Wisniewski is obsessed with this, and [...] Loretta Weinberg, it just shows that they really have nothing to do," [...] Christie said. Christie later credited the e-mail documents subpoenaed by the hearings as the first information he had that his staff was involved. When reporter Matt Katz asked, [...] "Governor, did you {{have anything to do with}} these lane closures in September outside the GW Bridge? Have you spoken to--" [...] Christie dismissively joked [...] "I worked the cones, actually, Matt. Unbeknownst to everybody I was actually the <b>guy</b> <b>out</b> there. I was in overalls and a hat. You really are not serious with that question." ...|$|E
60|$|Although {{fearful that}} it might {{overpower}} him, Frank slacked the <b>guy</b> <b>out</b> inch by inch, and as the sloop came up a little farther he saw {{the whole of the}} other boat again. The sloop's bowsprit was level with her quarter. She was scarcely a dozen yards away, leaping, plunging, swaying through a flung-up mass of foam, but they were steadily drawing up with her, and the boy could have shouted in the fierce excitement of the moment. Two or three minutes later they were clear ahead. He could no longer see the other boat, and he dared not risk a glance back at her. Indeed, {{it was a relief to}} him when Harry came scrambling aft.|$|E
6000|$|He did not {{so quickly}} become {{at home with}} the younger portion of the family, but his spirits rose every day. He whistled as he walked in the garden, and Bustle, instead of pacing soberly behind him, now capered, nibbled his pockets, and drew him into games of play which Charles and Amabel were charmed to {{overlook}} from the dressing-room window. There was Guy leaping, bounding, racing, rolling the dog over, tripping him up, twitching his ears, tickling his feet, catching at his tail, laughing at Bustle's springs, contortions, and harmless open-mouthed attacks, while the dog did little less than laugh too, with his intelligent amber eyes, and black and red mouth. Charles began to find a new interest in his listless life in the attempt to draw <b>Guy</b> <b>out,</b> and make him give one of his merry laughs. In this, however, he failed when his wit consisted in allusions to the novels of the day, of which Guy knew nothing. One morning he underwent a regular examination, ending in-- ...|$|E

5000|$|Louder Than the Musics Jono Davies {{wrote that}} [...] "This band {{sounds like a}} mix between Muse and Switchfoot and fans of those bands will enjoy {{checking}} theses <b>guys</b> <b>out.</b> Cold Hard Want is a real rock kind of album with some great tunes that will leave the listener wanting more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure! You know a {{good thing}} when you see one. Why," [...] he went on warmly, [...] "there is stuff in these reminiscences which would stir the blood of a jellyfish. Let me quote you another passage, {{to show that they}} are not only enthralling, but helpful as well. Let me see, where is it? Ah, I have it. 'A bully good way of putting a <b>guy</b> <b>out</b> of {{business}} is this. You don't want to use it in the ring, because rightly speaking it's a foul, but you will find it mighty useful if any thick-neck comes up to you in the street and tries to start anything. It's this way. While he's setting himself for a punch, just place the tips of the fingers of your left hand {{on the right side of}} the chest. Then bring down the heel of your left hand. There isn't a guy living that could stand up against that. The fingers give you a leverage to beat the band. The guy doubles up, and you upper-cut him with your right, and out he goes.' Now, I bet you never knew that before, Mr. Philpotts. Try it on your parishioners." ...|$|E

[...] "We had the tackle, but we didn't secure it and let the <b>guy</b> <b>out</b> the {{backside}} and that's just the discipline of the defense not having backside containment to let that <b>guy</b> <b>out</b> the backdoor. Really I thought {{for a period of time}} we kept shooting ourselves in the foot on both sides of the ball. I give credit to Washington. They did a good job." ...|$|E
