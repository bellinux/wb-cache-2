40|$|The {{market of}} {{financial}} instruments with high risk is developing very dynamically {{in recent years}} and attracts more and more interest of investors. It consists essentially of two groups of instruments, i. e. derivatives and <b>exchange</b> <b>traded</b> <b>product</b> (ETP), and each year new types are introduced and offered to investors. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present the principles concerning financial instruments with high investment risk available on the Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE), because they have quite complex constructions, and to evaluate the development of this market. In order to achieve this aim, statistical data from 2014 - 2016 was analyzed. The results confirm that the financial instruments with high investment risk available on the WSE constitute a diversified and the most numerous group of financial instruments and attract the most interest of investors. Responsible investing requires, however, a good knowledge of how they work and how they can generate profit to not expose oneself to unexpected losses...|$|E

40|$|Within the {{precious}} metals space, we outline and empirically investigate three potential advantages that ETNs may have {{relative to other}} <b>exchange</b> <b>traded</b> <b>products</b> such as ETFs. First, ETNs {{may be able to}} offer investors access to a wider array of assets, commodities, currencies and indices with a greater variety of leverage ratios. We find that ETNs do, in fact, offer investors a much greater variety of leverage ratios in {{the precious}} metals space compared to other <b>exchange</b> <b>traded</b> <b>products.</b> Second, ETNs may be able to offer investors lower annual expenses than comparable ETFs or other similar <b>exchange</b> <b>traded</b> <b>products.</b> We are unable to statistically corroborate this notion. We do, however, note that some <b>exchange</b> <b>traded</b> <b>products</b> charge non-trivial fees (upwards of 3. 74 %) to investors that are not included in the annual expense fee, whereas ETNs assess no such implicit fees. Third, ETNs may enjoy greater price efficiency owing to the absence of tracking error. We find no empirical evidence supporting this possibility...|$|R

However, unlike a standard ETP/ETF, a leveraged product will return a multiple of the return of the underlying asset to the investor.

The VIX ETPs have good trackingperformance, but suffer from time-decay due to the shape of the VIX futures termstructure. This time-decay makes them unsuitable for buy-and-hold investments,but gives rise to a profitable trading strategy using direct and inverse VIX ETPs. The strategy is robust to transaction costs. Despite being negatively correlatedwith the S&P 500, the ETPs perform poorly as hedging tools. By using simplerebalancing rules, the inclusion of VIX ETPs in a portfolio tracking the S&P 500 will decrease the risk-adjusted performance of the portfolio. </p...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2015. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Facilities are {{available}} to individual investors {{to enable them to}} invest directly in a multitude of investments without making use of investment brokers or financial advisors. Although this facility offers the benefit of reduced administration and management fees, it also puts the investor in a position where he is responsible for making his own investment decisions. Since Markowitz’s publication fifty years ago, it has been known that diversification is necessary {{in order to reduce the}} investor’s exposure to any unsystematic investment risk while still obtaining an acceptable return. Studies have shown that human behaviour has an impact on investment decisions and that human nature skews the individual’s perception of diversification and risk and the reality thereof. For this reason, the individual investor is better off making use of quantitative methods in order to ensure a properly diversified portfolio. <b>Exchange</b> <b>traded</b> <b>products</b> are passive, index tracking investments that <b>trade</b> on stock <b>exchanges</b> and pose benefits to individual investors owing to their low administrative costs and inherent levels of diversification. Individual investors are able to purchase <b>exchange</b> <b>traded</b> <b>products</b> such as <b>exchange</b> <b>traded</b> funds (ETFs), <b>exchange</b> <b>traded</b> notes (ETNs) and index tracking unit trusts through various means, including brokerage firms and online trading platforms. These platforms offer little advice to the individual investor on how to select the most suitable investment products and how each product will affect the risk profile of an investor’s portfolio. The purpose of this research assignment was to develop a portfolio optimisation tool that would help the investor obtain the optimal return for his desired level of risk, thereby ensuring efficient diversification. An optimisation model was developed by using performance data from 2009 to 2013 and the resultant optimised portfolio’s performance was evaluated for 2014. It was found that optimisation rendered acceptable results, provided that the covariances between the various ETFs showed equivalence year on year. This requirement limited the number of ETFs that could be included in the model. Improvements to the model were recommended, based on the results of similar research in the field of portfolio optimisation. Further research is proposed that would utilise other optimisation methods, other sources of data and comparisons that are more detailed...|$|R
40|$|Introduction In the past, {{institutions}} {{seeking to}} insulate {{themselves from the}} ravages of inflation have included real estate in their portfolio as a risk management diversification strategy. The events of the late eighties and early nineties have shown that this strategy was not without its drawbacks. In particular, real estate is difficult to value, has inadequate liquidity, and is not traded on a regulated exchange. What institutional investors really need {{is a way to}} achieve the positive aspects of real estate without suffering its drawbacks. Real assets combine the best attributes of real estate and <b>exchange</b> <b>traded</b> <b>products.</b> Real assets [...] - represented as exchange-traded futures [...] - appreciate during inflationary periods; financial assets lose value during these times. It therefore seems necessary to include real assets in any prudent investment program and risk managed diversification strategy.

40|$|While not {{ignoring}} risk, agricultural cooperatives tend {{to accommodate}} risk through {{the holding of}} internal capital reserves rather than engage in active risk management. A lack of information regarding the risk, returns, and the effect on cooperative financial performance of both traditional and innovative risk management strategies is likely a constraint {{to the adoption of}} active risk management by cooperatives. In this research, we examine the influence of alternative risk management strategies on cooperative financial performance, namely the return on assets (ROA) of grain merchandising cooperatives of various sizes. Strategies include traditional <b>exchange</b> <b>traded</b> futures and options strategies, an over-the-counter revenue swap, throughput insurance, and combinations of price and throughput strategies. Each of these strategies, for small, medium, and large size firms, are evaluated using a range of procedures including techniques which rely on mean-variance efficiency as well as evaluation procedures which help determine the ability of a strategy to mitigate downside risk. The results of the simulation exercise provide considerable support for the routine buying of at-the-money put options in setting a commodity floor price. The results also support the use, and perhaps the development, of insurance on cooperative throughput if the insurance product is used in conjunction with a price risk management strategy, in essence providing a hedge against downfalls in revenue. Over-the-counter revenue swaps, while intuitively appealing, did not perform well on average relative to more traditional <b>exchange</b> <b>traded</b> <b>products.</b> This result is especially important given the added counter party risk associated with such contracts. However, in some cases, the revenue swap, as well routine hedging with futures, performed better under a Value-at-Risk evaluation criteria than with a mean-variance criteria. Hence, it is important for cooperative managers to consider these results {{in the context of the}} risk management goals. Agribusiness,...|$|R
30|$|Gold {{has become}} a fairly {{reasonable}} option and a dominant commodity for investors looking for diversification and hedging in the financial market. Compared with other financial markets, venturing in gold has become commercially easier through the introduction of GETFs (Shafiee and Topal, 2010). Among {{the various forms of}} investment in gold, GETFs are better performing and more profitable (Velmurugan et al., 2013). As {{one of the most successful}} products introduced in the exchange, ETFs play a pronounced role in the Indian stock market. The ease of trading brought about by GETFs has increased the volatility of gold (Baur, 2013). In addition, the attractiveness of gold as an investment is growing fast, after the gold <b>exchange</b> <b>traded</b> <b>products</b> were introduced (Shafiee and Topal, 2010). GETFs relate closely with market stability and volatility (Aggarwal and Schofield, 2013). However, prices of ETF are less volatile in the Indian stock market (Goyal and Joshi, 2011). More recently, investors have come to prefer more of these products. GETFs have triggered the appetite for gold, which {{has become a}}n investment vehicle that trades as easily as a stock or share (World Gold Council, 2008). Gold price appreciation in the long term has led to an upsurge in the quantity of this asset demanded by investors, ceteris paribus. This is a consequence of price projections employing the rationale of information disseminated through prices and proves to be the reason for the positive slope of the gold investment demand curve over a prevalent range of price levels (Sazonov and Nikolaev, 2013). GETFs unit prices move in tandem with the equity stock market prices and have a negative correlation with equity investments (Mukesh et al., 2012). This negative correlation allows GETF units to be included in any investment portfolio for risk diversification (Goyal, 2014). Over-estimation and under-estimation are reasons for the gold curve to have a negative slope (Sazonov and Nikolaev, 2013).|$|R
40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this thesis}} is to study risk factor based {{investing}} and test how well MSCI constructs their risk factor based indices. Risk factor based investing has gained {{a lot of media}} exposure in the recent years and “Smart Beta” products are becoming more popular. Blackrock estimated that there are more than 700 <b>exchange</b> <b>traded</b> <b>products</b> available and they have over $ 529 billion in assets under management. Risk factor investing aims to harvest the risk premia associated with factors like size, momentum and value. I tested whether MSCI is able to provide higher Sharpe ratios for higher risk exposure indices and how much they deviated from the parent index of MSCI World. I used the Ledoit & Wolf bootstrap inference test to find out whether the Sharpe ratios of high exposure and high capacity indices differ from each other. Furthermore, I tested how well the Fama & French Three Factor-model with the addition of Carhart momentum factor could explain the returns of MSCI’s risk factor indices. I also constructed different risk factor portfolios using risk-parity methods to see whether it is possible to enhance the returns of risk factor indices by combining them. The main results and conclusions of this thesis were that risk factor investing can provide excess returns. These excess returns are readily available by investing in MSCI’s risk factor indices. Another key finding was that by utilizing risk-parity methods an investor can achieve excess returns over an equally weighted risk factor portfolio and over the MSCI’s own Diversified Mix index. Furthermore, even though MSCI is the world leader in index creation, their way of creating indices doesn’t seem to be very efficient and it would be beneficial to analyse other index providers, too. The data used in this thesis were gathered from “MSCI’s end of day index data search”. The data consists of six risk factor indices from developed countries. The price data ranged from November 1998 to August 2015. For the Ledoit & Wolf test I gathered four high capacity indices and four high exposure indices from the same time period. The proxies for academic factors were provided by Kenneth French on his website...|$|R

40|$|Purpose of {{this article}} is to {{consider}} commodity market interaction between United States and Italy. We use time series for spot prices spanning from January 1999 to May 2012 for crude oil and three ag-commodities: wheat, corn and soybean. These crops have been selected for their relevance in ag-commodity exchanges between US and Italy markets. Market integration between US and Italy agricultural markets is hypothesized given the consistenly high volumes traded between these two countries as well as by the central role of <b>exchange</b> <b>trade</b> for these <b>products,</b> e. g. on Chicago Board of Trade (CBT). The integration between oil and ag-commodity markets is suggested both by the intensive use of energy dependent inputs, (fertilizer, seed, machinery) in production of ag-commodities and their use in biofuel production. Our results suggest: a) market integration between US market crude oil and ag-commodities; b) integration between Italian and US ag-commodity prices and less evidence of integration between Italian ag and oil markets.

40|$|Abstract The {{goal of this}} master’s {{thesis is}} to {{understand}} the performance implications of hedge fund’s tail risk, and the mechanisms of how some funds achieve lower tail risk. The current evidence on the performance implications is mixed, with most empirical hedge fund studies suggesting higher returns to higher risk. This is not obvious since the goal of skillful hedge fund managers is to deliver positive risk-adjusted returns, and indeed a few studies do report higher returns to lower risk. The issue is further complicated by the evidence of asset-level low-risk anomalies, which could create a low-skill alternative for managers to achieving higher returns with lower risk. Using a consolidation of commercial hedge fund databases, we decompose hedge fund tail risk, conditional on market distress, into two components: Systematic Conditional Tail Risk (SCTR) arising predictably via equity market exposure, and Idiosyncratic Conditional Tail Risk (ICTR) arising from unpredictable, proprietary alpha investment technology. First, using a subset of large, 13 F-HR matched hedge funds from March 2000 to June 2013, we show that especially low-ICTR hedge funds deliver superior future risk-adjusted returns. In contrast to existing hedge fund literature our results support the broader view in asset-pricing literature that low risk is associated with higher risk-adjusted returns. The results are robust to the inclusion of additional risk factors, including a low-risk factor, suggesting that the better performance {{could be due to}} skillful hedging rather than harvesting of low-risk anomalies. This skill hypothesis is further supported by the finding that low-risk funds charge higher incentive fees, consistent with economic theory. To further resolve the puzzle of whether low-risk funds outperform high-risk funds, using a large set of funds from January 1994 to June 2013, we run a comprehensive “horse race” between our risk measures and a replication of a large array of existing risk measures. Our results show that for many existing risk measures, the purported risk premium largely diminishes when controlling fund size, suggesting that existing results may be somewhat driven by the inclusion of smaller funds. Our measures SCTR and ICTR consistently show low-risk funds outperforming high-risk funds. Second, using 13 F-HR option holdings data from March 1999 to June 2013, we investigate the underlying hedging mechanism implemented by low tail risk hedge funds. We demonstrate that low-SCTR funds allocate a high fraction of their wealth — consistently over time — to protective option strategies, while low-ICTR funds use costly protective strategies only during the financial crisis. Funds with low ICTR also employ more stock, but not index, options, which fits the idiosyncratic nature of the measure. After the financial crisis, volatility-linked <b>Exchange</b> <b>Traded</b> <b>Products</b> (ETPs) have emerged as a potential alternative to hedging tail risk. We show that, from April 2009 to June 2013, the use of such volatility-linked ETPs is associated with lower SCTR but not ICTR, consistent with the option result, and indeed suggesting a complementary hedging mechanism...|$|R
