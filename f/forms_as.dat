5|$|Architectural designs {{resembling}} plants {{appear in}} the capitals of Ancient Egyptian columns, which were carved to resemble either the Egyptian white lotus or the papyrus. Ancient Greek columns of the Corinthian order are decorated with acanthus leaves. Islamic art, too, makes frequent use of plant motifs and patterns, including on column capitals. These designs became increasingly elaborate and stylised, appearing as complex arabesque and geometric motifs in objects such as the Ardabil Carpet and ten-pointed Persian ceramic star tiles, influencing the decorative arts in the Western world in such <b>forms</b> <b>as</b> the Rococo and later the Arts and Crafts movement.|$|E
5|$|Development of the fertilized eggs is direct, {{in other}} words there is no {{distinctive}} larval form. Juveniles of all groups are generally planktonic, and in most species resemble miniature adult cydippids, gradually developing their adult body <b>forms</b> <b>as</b> they grow. In the genus Beroe, however, the juveniles have large mouths and, like the adults, lack both tentacles and tentacle sheaths, and in some groups, such as the flat, bottom-dwelling platyctenids, the juveniles behave more like true larvae, as they live among the plankton and thus occupy a different ecological niche from their parents, and only attain the adult form by a more radical metamorphosis after dropping to the sea-floor.|$|E
5|$|In 1870, George Bentham {{published}} a thorough revision of Banksia in his landmark publication Flora Australiensis. In Bentham's arrangement, {{the number of}} recognised Banksia species was reduced from 60 to 46. Bentham observed that the characteristics Brown used to define B.australis, B.depressa, B.patula, and B.insularis were unable to distinguish separate <b>forms</b> <b>as</b> more specimens came to light, and hence declared them synonyms of B.marginata. Meissner's four series were replaced by four sections based on leaf, style and pollen-presenter characters. B.marginata was placed in section Eubanksia along with B.integrifolia and B.dentata.|$|E

Bilingual writers such as Asaga gained fame, and noted scholars such as the Mahaviracharya wrote on pure mathematics in the court of King Amoghavarsha I.|$|E
5|$|Lambeosaurus, {{best known}} through L. lambei, was {{quite similar to}} Corythosaurus in {{everything}} but {{the form of the}} head adornment. Compared to Corythosaurus, the crest of Lambeosaurus was shifted forward, and the hollow nasal passages within were {{at the front of the}} crest and stacked vertically. It also can be differentiated from Corythosaurus by its lack of forking nasal processes making up part of the sides of the crest, which is the only way to tell juveniles of the two genera apart, as the crests took on their distinctive <b>forms</b> <b>as</b> the animals aged.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{taxonomy}} and classification {{became the}} focus of natural historians. Carl Linnaeus published a basic taxonomy for the natural world in 1735 (variations of which have been in use ever since), and in the 1750s introduced scientific names for all his species. Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, treated species as artificial categories and living <b>forms</b> <b>as</b> malleable—even suggesting the possibility of common descent. Though he was opposed to evolution, Buffon is a key figure in the history of evolutionary thought; his work influenced the evolutionary theories of both Lamarck and Darwin.|$|E

The Genji Monogatari Emaki, is a late Heian era 12th-century handscroll, consisting of four scrolls, 19 paintings, and 20 sheets of calligraphy.

The scroll is housed at the Gotoh Museum and the Tokugawa Art Museum.|$|E

5|$|Cryptoprocta spelea is {{the only}} extinct carnivoran mammal known from Madagascar; {{recently}} extinct Madagascan animals also include at least 17species of lemurs, {{most of which are}} larger than the living <b>forms,</b> <b>as</b> well as elephant birds and Malagasy hippopotamuses, among others. Subfossil remains of the giant fossa have been found in Holocene cave sites from the northern end of Madagascar along the west coast to the far south, and in the central highlands. Some sites have yielded both C.spelea and smaller remains referable to the living species, C.ferox; however, lack of robust stratigraphic knowledge and no available radiocarbon dating on subfossil Cryptoprocta bones makes it uncertain whether the two species lived in the same region at the same time. The size ratio between the two species is within the range of ratios seen between similar-sized living cats and mongooses found in the same areas, suggesting that the two species may have been able to occur together.|$|E
5|$|Giovanni Pacioni and Giorgio Lalli {{described}} the forms roseus and vinosus from Italy in 2003; roseus has a greyish-whitish cap discolouration, while f. vinosus has a less clearly zonate cap that lacks green tones, and gills with a lilac-pinkish sheen. However, form vinosus, originally described by Lucien Quélet as a variety (Lactarius sanguifluus var. vinosus) in 1881, was invalid, because Quélet's basionym was an illegitimate nomenclatural synonym {{of a species}} named in 1855 by Jean-Baptiste Barla. Later authors {{did not agree with}} the delimitation of these <b>forms</b> <b>as</b> distinct taxa, suggesting that the alternations in appearance represent normal morphological variations brought about by differences in age, and environmental factors such as levels of sunlight and humidity. Lactarius vinosus has often been considered as a variety of L.sanguifluus, but morphological (especially macroscopic characters and spore-ornamentation) and molecular evidence (based on internal transcribed spacer-sequencing) has confirmed that they are separate species.|$|E
5|$|In Cuvier's {{landmark}} 1796 {{paper on}} living and fossil elephants, {{he referred to}} a single catastrophe that destroyed life {{to be replaced by}} the current <b>forms.</b> <b>As</b> a result of his studies of extinct mammals, he realized that animals such as Palaeotherium had lived before the time of the mammoths, which led him to write in terms of multiple geological catastrophes that had wiped out a series of successive faunas. By 1830, a scientific consensus had formed around his ideas as a result of paleobotany and the dinosaur and marine reptile discoveries in Britain. In Great Britain, where natural theology was very influential in the early 19th century, a group of geologists that included Buckland, and Robert Jameson insisted on explicitly linking the most recent of Cuvier's catastrophes to the biblical flood. Catastrophism had a religious overtone in Britain that was absent elsewhere.|$|E
