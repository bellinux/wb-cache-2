Other superstars such as Kane, Val Venis, The New Age Outlaws and Edge were coming through the ranks and exposing the WWF as territory where new talent could ascend, as opposed to WCW. Matters were so heated between the two programs that, when both shows were in the Hampton Roads area {{on the same night}} (Raw Is War in Hampton, Virginia, Nitro in Norfolk, Virginia), DX was sent to film a [...] "war" [...] segment at the Norfolk Scope where they berated WCW and interviewed <b>fans</b> on <b>camera</b> who stated that they received their Nitro tickets for free (presumably in an attempt by WCW to pack the arena to capacity due to low ticket sales).|$|R

A new method of price linking, the representative good approach (RGA), is proposed for measuring product evolution using historical documents. The RGA can shed light on evolutionary patterns of technological change, {{and serve as a}} check against other methods of quality measurement like conventional price linking and hedonics.

40|$|The Microgravity Emissions Laboratory (MEL) was {{developed}} for the support, simulation, and verification of the International Space Station microgravity environment. The MEL utilizes an inertial measurement system using acceleration emissions generated by various operating components of the space station. These emissions, if too large, could hinder the science performed on the space station by disturbing the microgravity environment. Typical test components are disk drives, pumps, motors, solenoids, <b>fans,</b> and <b>cameras.</b> These components will produce inertial forces, which disturb the microgravity on-orbit station environment. These components, usually housed within a station rack, must meet acceleration limits imposed at the rack interface for minimizing the onboard station-operating environment. The NASA Glenn Research Center developed this one-of-a-kind laboratory for testing components and, eventually, rack-level configurations. The MEL approach is to measure the component's generated inertial forces. This force {{is a product of}} the full diagonal mass matrix including the test setup (the center of gravity, mass moment of inertia, and weight) and the resolved diagonal rigid-body acceleration determined from measurements using the 10 apparatus accelerometers. The mass matrix can be test derived. The bifilar torsional pendulum method is used to measure the moment of inertia for the test component...|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that Supreme Court Justices are not <b>fans</b> of <b>cameras</b> — specifically, video cameras. Despite {{continued}} pressure from the press, Congress, and the public to allow cameras into oral arguments, the Justices have steadfastly refused. The policy arguments for allowing cameras in the courtroom focus on cameras as a means to increased transparency of judicial work. Yet these arguments tend to gloss over a significant point about the Court — it is not secretive. The Court allows several avenues of access to its oral arguments including the presence of the public and the press in the audience, the daily release of transcripts, the weekly release of audio recordings and even some live-blogging. These various means of access make clear that this is not simply an issue of transparency versus secrecy. Oral arguments at the Supreme Court are, in all fairness, open and public events. This raises the central question — why the fear of video cameras? After allowing so much access, why not add this additional avenue of communication with the public? Each time the Justices ascend to the bench, they know they {{are at the center of}} the most high-profile show in the American legal system. Why close this single door when the walls around them are made of glass? This Article seeks to answer that question by identifying the qualities of video that make an otherwise open Court suddenly so fearful...|$|R

50|$|Johannes Vermeer {{was born}} in 1632 in Delft, Holland. He worked and lived in Delft all his life, {{although}} {{it is possible that}} he may have done an apprenticeship in another town such as Amsterdam or Utrecht for six years. A major stepping point in Vermeer's career was in 1653 when he joined the Guild of Saint Luke as a master and professional painter. Vermeer painted at a somewhat leisure pace, producing two to three paintings a year and there are 35 known to exist today. Vermeer's work shows that he was most likely a <b>fan</b> of the <b>camera</b> obscura, as parts are in focus as others slightly blur. There is also an intensity to his colors that supports the use of the obscura. Vermeer died at a relatively young age, 43, in 1675. He suffered most likely from a stroke or stress-induced heart attack. The slow rate at which he produced paintings restricted Vermeer from becoming wealthy during his lifetime, and he died in debt.|$|R

5000|$|Sakagami {{notes that}} Live For You! {{basically}} extracted the performance {{system from the}} previous game, but with changes and improvements. Instead of calling it a traditional video game, he describes it as a game that allows the player to freely view and enjoy the singing and dancing. To achieve this goal, the development team included added functionality with camera angles and close-ups during performances. Sakagami had previously talked with Hiroyuki Onoda, the director of The Idolmasters Xbox 360 port, about how <b>fans</b> wanted more <b>camera</b> functionality in the next game, but Sakagami {{wanted it to be}} kept as simple as possible to maintain the lightheartedness in Live For You!. The team also touched on the idea to add in a [...] "sense of unity with the audience" [...] and wanted the player to get excited with the idols during performances, leading {{to the development of the}} rhythm minigame. Over the course of the minigame's development, the staff started with a simple rhythm game and began to take a more different approach to it, but after some trial and error, they returned to their initial idea for the minigame.|$|R
5000|$|Mirror's Edge Catalyst is a first-person action-adventure game {{in which}} the player takes control of Faith Connors as she {{progresses}} through a futuristic city named Glass. Similar to the original Mirror's Edge, players traverse the city using aspects of urban exploration and parkour movements to complete missions and evade or fight enemies. Players can also make use of environmental objects such as zip-lines and ledges, and equipment; this includes a MAG (Manifold Attachment Gear) Rope and a Disruptor to travel across buildings, disable certain systems (such as large <b>fans</b> or security <b>cameras)</b> and aid Faith during combat. When players mark an objective on their map, Faith's [...] "runner vision" [...] is activated and some scenery items automatically highlight in red. These act as guides to lead players towards their objective. The use of levels and linear gameplay found in the first Mirror's Edge has been replaced with an open world, free-roaming environment. This gives players more freedom in traversal, allowing {{for the use of}} multiple paths to reach one's objective. In addition to the campaign's mission, side activities such as time trials, races and environmental puzzles are featured. Additionally, items called GridLeaks can be found across the world that can be collected by players.|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} an improved Filtering Facepiece Respirator (FFR) {{designed to increase}} the comfort of wearers during low-moderate work. The improved FFR aims to lower the deadspace temperature and CO 2 level by an active ventilation fan. The reversing modeling is used to build the 3 D geometric model of this FFR; the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation is then introduced to investigate the flow field. Based on the simulation result, the ventilation fan of the improved FFR can fit the flow field well when placed in the proper blowing orientation; streamlines from this fan show a cup-shape distribution and are perfectly matched {{to the shape of}} the FFR and human face when the fan blowing inward. In the deadspace of the improved FFR, the CO 2 volume fraction is controlled by the optimized flow field. In addition, an experimental prototype of the improved FFR has been tested to validate the simulation. A wireless temperature sensor is used to detect the temperature variation inside the prototype FFR, deadspace temperature is lowered by 2 K compared to the normal FFR without a <b>fan.</b> An infrared <b>camera</b> (IRC) method is used to elucidate the temperature distribution on the prototype FFR's outside surface and the wearer's face, surface temperature is lowered notably. Both inside and outside temperature results from the simulation are in agreement with experimental results. Therefore, adding an inward-blowing fan on the outer surface of an N 95 FFR is a feasible approach to reducing the deadspace CO 2 concentration and improve temperature comfort...|$|R
40|$|This {{exhibition}} {{provides a}} comprehensive {{overview of the}} work {{of one of the most}} influential figures in film, photography and conceptual art. Michael Snow has been producing seminal works since the 1960 s, and he is perhaps best known for Wavelength (1967), which is one of the most influential experimental films ever made. He is an artist who has worked in a wide range of media, including film, photography, sculpture, painting, installation and sound, many of which are represented here. Michael Snow’s primary concern is with the ideas surrounding perception and the role of the viewer in relation to a given object or image. The works draw attention to the gaps between an object and its representation. He is very interested in the processes that are involved in the creation of a filmic image, of representation of an image, in terms of time, light, sound, cropping, projection and illusion. Once you have negotiated the <b>fan,</b> <b>camera</b> and light in the entranceway to gallery space (these form part of a piece entitled Video Fields that you can see fully in Gallery 3, and is described in more detail later on in this Guide.) One of the first works that can be seen in Gallery 1 is Authorization (1969). In this, the artist photographed himself and then placed the photograph on the mirror, repeating this process until his own reflection disappeared, resulting in the final photo in the top left hand corner in which he is totally obscured. This work highlights the process involved in the making of the work, and can draw comparisons with the process of film making. Also included in this gallery space are many other important early works from the late 60 s and early 70 s, such as Blind, Atlantic and Sight (all from 1967). These show a fascination with themes of depth and flatness, framing and field of vision. For example the four layers in the sculpture Blind are based on four stages of a film’s fade-out and can be viewed from outside and inside. (Gallery visitors can walk inside of the sculpture in order to see the full visual effect.) The grids overlap and provide the viewer with differing layers on which they can concentrate and focus. Sight also gives the viewer a frame through which to concentrate their gaze and to re-evaluate what lies beyond the frame. Gallery 2 shows a mixture of works from varying stages of Snow’s career. There are some seminal early works from 1964 - 65 from the ‘Walking Woman’ series (ie. Morningside Heights, Seen, Test Focus Field Figure, Hawaii). This series was based on the same stylised drawing that Snow made and then re-used in various media (including paintings, sculpture, photography and film) between 1961 - 67. The image is always cropped in some way, and used as a repetitive motif through which to explore many different ideas of flatness and illusion. Another key work in this room is Venetian Blind from 1970, in which the artist can be seen photographing himself as he travels around Venice. He repeatedly photographed himself at arms length with his eyes shut, thereby making himself ‘blind’ to the photographic process taking place. At the far end of Gallery 2 is That/Cela/Dat (2000), a recent work that explores another one of the recurrent themes in Snow’s work - that of ‘language’. It consists of texts displayed simultaneously in English, French and Dutch. Snow has described this works as follows, “Sentences are presented on the screen, one word at a time and always within the same framing limits. One word at a time emphasises the pictorial nature of the projection and makes for a spectatorial participation in the nuances of the work’s timing and a prophetic participation in what might be coming next”. In Gallery 3 is a new work entitled Video Fields, which has been commissioned especially for this exhibition. When you entered the building initially you would have confronted by a fan, a bright photographic light and your movements would have been recorded by the camera. This image has then been relayed to the first projection in Gallery 3, but the transmission has been delayed by several minutes. This image of people being buffeted by the artificial wind of the fan is then placed in conjunction with images of fields of grasses being similarly buffeted by actual wind. Both the figures and the landscape are being subjected to an invisible force that changes their appearance. Next to this new work is a slide projection piece entitled Recombinant (1992) in which a wooden panel has been incised and painted. Onto this wall-panel a series of slide images are projected. There are some recognisable images, but the overall impression is of a dialogue between organic and geometric forms, and between painting and sculpture. Lying just beyond Recombinant in the small room at the far end of Gallery 3 is Egg (1985). Given the ideas explored previously it is not surprising that Snow has experimented with the use of Holography. This holographic work explores further the themes of illusion and reality. A real object is brought into direct contact with the illusion, and reinforces the contrast between flat space and three-dimensional spac...|$|R
40|$|A {{micro air vehicle}} (MAV) is a semiautonomous {{airborne}} vehicle {{which measures}} less than 15 cm in any dimension. It {{can be used to}} access situations too dangerous for direct human intervention, e. g., explosive devices planted in buildings and video reconnaissance and surveillance, etc. As demonstrated by flying birds and insects, flapping flight is advantageous for its superior manoeuvrability and much more aerodynamically efficient at small size than the conventional steady-state aerodynamics. Piezoelectric actuators are easy to control, have high power density and can produce high output force but usually the displacement is small. With appropriate stroke amplification mechanisms piezoelectric actuators can be used to drive the flapping wings of MAV. This research aims to develop a piezoelectric fan system with 2 degrees of freedom of motion for flapping wing MAV applications. In this project, piezoelectric fans consisting of a piezoelectric layer and an elastic metal layer were prepared by epoxy bonding. A flexible wing formed by carbon fibre reinforced plastic wing spars and polymer skin was attached to two separate piezoelectric fans to make them coupled. Two sinusoidal voltages signals of different phase were then used to drive the coupled piezoelectric <b>fans.</b> High speed <b>camera</b> photography was used to characterize the two degrees of freedom motion of the wing. Theoretical equations were derived to analyse the performance of the piezoelectric fans in both quasi-static and dynamic operations, and the calculated results agreed well with the finite element analysis (FEA) modelling results. It has been observed that the phase delay between the driving voltages applied to the coupled piezoelectric fans {{plays an important role in}} the control of the flapping v and twisting motions of the wing. Selected factors such as the gap between the two piezoelectric fans which can affect the performances of the wing have been investigated and the experimental results were compared with the FEA modelling results...|$|R
