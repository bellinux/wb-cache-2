40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis {{was to assess the}} effectiveness of using a Wigner-Seitz (WS) cell with an adjusted moderator thickness to produce more accurate resonance self-shielded cross sections for light water reactor (LWR) lattices. The WS approximation has been commonly used in lattice physics calculations for many decades regardless that it has been shown to underestimate k-eff for an infinite LWR lattice by several hundred pcm. The WS cell moderator thickness was adjusted in order make the WS cell <b>Dancoff</b> <b>correction</b> match that for the square unit cell. It was shown that the effectiveness of this method is sensitive to the <b>Dancoff</b> <b>correction</b> which was being calculated from the real three-dimensional geometry because in practice users commonly employ unconverged values for the <b>Dancoff</b> <b>correction.</b> For an infinite lattice the Dancoff adjusted Wigner-Seitz cell (DAWSC) resulted in small improvements in k-eff (- 20 pcm) and reaction rates when using converged Dancoff corrections, however much larger improvements in values (up to 220 pcm) were seen for unconverged values of Dancoff corrections. When the DAWSC method was applied to a boiling water reactor (BWR) bundle, k-eff was worse for the DAWSC cases then for the normal WS cell treatment relative to continuous energy results. Improvements were seen in U 238 absorption reaction rates for DAWSC cases in the inner fuel pins of the bundle; however the results were the opposite for fuel pins on the outer edges of the bundle. These results showed that the DAWSC method failed to account for irregularities in the bundle for the Dancoff corrections that were calculated. The <b>Dancoff</b> <b>correction</b> calculation sequence was evaluated against CASMO 4 e. Good agreement (- 0. 34 % difference) was seen for infinite lattices, however large variations (+ 5 % to - 4 %) were seen among neighboring pins in a BWR lattice. These results for <b>Dancoff</b> <b>correction</b> prediction along with the significant improvements seen in k-eff for infinite lattices using unconverged Dancoff corrections implies that the DAWSC method may work if given the correct values for Dancoff corrections. The originally intended use for a <b>Dancoff</b> <b>correction</b> was to adjust the fuel escape probability for a particular energy group. Conversely, the application of DAWSC uses a single <b>Dancoff</b> <b>correction</b> to effectively change the fuel escape probability for all energy groups. A method for calculating an appropriate <b>Dancoff</b> <b>correction</b> for use in the DAWSC method should be investigated. by Thomas Hayward Roomy. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|The {{advanced}} Very High Temperature gas-cooled Reactor (VHTR), {{which is}} currently being developed, achieves simplification of safety through reliance on innovative features and passive systems. One of the VHTRs innovative features is the reliance on ceramic-coated fuel particles to retain the fission products under extreme accident conditions. The effect of the random fuel kernel distribution in the fuel prismatic block is addressed {{through the use of}} the <b>Dancoff</b> <b>correction</b> factor in the resonance treatment. However, if the fuel kernels are not perfect black absorbers, the <b>Dancoff</b> <b>correction</b> factor is a function of burnup and fuel kernel packing factor, which requires that the <b>Dancoff</b> <b>correction</b> factor be updated during Equilibrium Fuel Cycle (EqFC) analysis. An advanced Kernel-by-Kernel (K-b-K) hexagonal super lattice model can be used to address and update the burnup dependent Dancoff effect during the EqFC analysis. The developed Prismatic Super Homogeneous Lattice Model (PSHLM) is verified by comparing the calculated burnup characteristics of the double-heterogeneous Prismatic Super Kernel-by-Kernel Lattice Model (PSK-b-KLM). This paper summarizes and compares the PSHLM and PSK-b-KLM burnup analysis study and results. This paper also discusses the coupling of a Monte-Carlo code with fuel depletion and buildup code, which provides the fuel burnup analysis tool used to produce the results of the VHTR EqFC burnup analysis...|$|E

40|$|The {{generation}} of multigroup cross sections {{lies at the}} heart of the very high temperature reactor (VHTR) core design, whether the prismatic (block) or pebble-bed type. The design process, generally performed in three steps, is quite involved and its execution is crucial to proper reactor physics analyses. The primary purpose of this project is to develop the CENTRM cross-section processing module of the SCALE code package for application to prismatic or pebble-bed core designs. The team will include a detailed outline of the entire processing procedure for application of CENTRM in a final report complete with demonstration. In addition, they will conduct a thorough verification of the CENTRM code, which has yet to be performed. The tasks for this project are to: Thoroughly test the panel algorithm for neutron slowing down; Develop the panel algorithm for multi-materials; Establish a multigroup convergence 1 D transport acceleration algorithm in the panel formalism; Verify CENTRM in 1 D plane geometry; Create and test the corresponding transport/panel algorithm in spherical and cylindrical geometries; and, Apply the verified CENTRM code to current VHTR core design configurations for an infinite lattice, including assessing effectiveness of <b>Dancoff</b> <b>corrections</b> to simulate TRISO particle heterogeneity...|$|R

Although HTR fuel is rather homogeneously dispersed in the fuel graphite matrix, the heterogeneity effects in between fuel kernels and pebbles cannot be ignored. The double-heterogeneous lattice model recently developed at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) contains tens of thousands of cubic fuel kernel cells, which makes it very difficult to deplete the fuel, kernel by kernel (KbK), for the EqFC analysis. In addition, {{it is not possible to}} preserve the cubic size and packing factor in a spherical fuel pebble. To avoid these difficulties, a newly developed and validated HTR pebble-bed Kernel-by-Kernel spherical (KbK-sph) model, has been developed and verified in this study. The objective of this research is to introduce the KbK-sph model and super whole Pebble lattice model (PLM). The verified double-heterogeneous KbK-sph and pebble homogeneous lattice model (HLM) are used for the fuel burnup chracteristics analysis and important safety parameters validation. This study summarizes and compares the KbK-sph and HLM burnup analyzed results.

As {{one of their}} potential incineration options, partitioning and transmutation in fission reactors are seriously considered worldwide. If implemented, these technologies {{could also be a}} source of nuclear fuel materials required for sustainability of nuclear energy. The objective of this research was to evaluate performance characteristics of Very High Temperature Reactors (VHTRs) and their variations due to configuration adjustments targeting achievability of spectral variations. The development of realistic whole-core 3 D VHTR models and their benchmarking against experimental data was an inherent part of the research effort. Although the performance analysis was primarily focused on prismatic core configurations, 3 D pebble-bed core models were also created and analyzed. The whole-core 3 D models representing the prismatic block and pebble-bed cores were created for use with the SCALE 5. 0 code system. Each of the models required the <b>Dancoff</b> <b>correction</b> factor to be externally calculated. The code system DANCOFF-MCThe whole-core/system 3 D models with multi-heterogeneity treatments were validated by the benchmark problems. Obtained results are in agreement with the available High Temperature Test Reactor data. Preliminary analyses of actinide-fueled VHTR configurations have indicated promising performance characteristics. Utilization of minor actinides as a fuel component would facilitate development of new fuel cycles and support sustainability of a fuel source for nuclear energy assuring future operation of Generation IV nuclear energy systems. was utilized to perform the Dancoff factor calculations...|$|E
40|$|At {{the brink}} of nuclear waste {{repository}} crises, viable alternatives {{for the long term}} radiotoxic wastes are seriously being considered worldwide. Minor actinides serve as one of these targeted wastes. Partitioning and transmutation in fission reactors is one possible incineration option and could potentially serve as a source of nuclear fuel required for sustainability of energy resources. The objective of this research was to evaluate the neutronic performance of the pebble-bed Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) configurations with various fuel loadings. The configuration adjustments and design sensitivity studies specifically targeted the achievability of spectral variations. The development of several realistic full-core 3 D models and validation of all modeling techniques used was a major part of this research effort. In addition, investigating design sensitivities helped identify the parameters of primary interest. The full-core 3 D models representing the prototype and large scale cores were created for use with SCALE 5. 0 and SCALE 5. 1 code systems. Initially the models required the external calculation of a <b>Dancoff</b> <b>correction</b> factor; however, the recent release of SCALE 5. 1 encompassed inherent double heterogeneity modeling capabilities. The full core 3 D models with multi-heterogeneity treatments are in agreement with available pebble-bed High Temperature Test Reactor data and were validated through benchmark studies. Analyses of configurations with various fuel loadings have indicated promising performance and safety characteristics. It was found that through small configuration adjustments, the pebble-bed design can be tweaked to produce desirable spectral shifts. The future operation of Generation IV nuclear energy systems would be greatly facilitated by the utilization of minor actinides as a fuel component. This would offer development of new fuel cycles, and support sustainability of a fuel source...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{effective}} {{cross sections}} (XSs) in the direct whole core calculation code nTRACER are {{evaluated by the}} equivalence theory-based resonance-integral-table method using the WIMS-based library {{as an alternative to}} the subgroup method. The background XSs, as well as the <b>Dancoff</b> <b>correction</b> factors, were evaluated by the enhanced neutron-current method. A method, with pointwise microscopic XSs on a union-lethargy grid, was used for the generation of resonance-interference factors (RIFs) for mixed resonant absorbers. This method was modified by the intermediate-resonance approximation by replacing the potential XSs for the non-absorbing moderator nuclides with the background XSs and neglecting the resonance-elastic scattering. The resonance-escape probability was implemented to incorporate the energy self-shielding effect in the spectrum. The XSs were improved using the proposed method as compared to the narrow resonance infinite mass-based method. The RIFs were improved by 1 % in 235 U, 7 % in 239 Pu, and > 2 % in 240 Pu. To account for thermal feedback, a new feature was incorporated with the interpolation of pre-generated RIFs at the multigroup level and the results compared with the conventional resonance-interference model. This method provided adequate results in terms of XSs and k-eff. The results were verified first by the comparison of RIFs with the exact RIFs, and then comparing the XSs with the McCARD calculations for the homogeneous configurations, with burned fuel containing a mixture of resonant nuclides at different burnups and temperatures. The RIFs and XSs for the mixture showed good agreement, which verified the accuracy of the RIF evaluation using the proposed method. The method was then verified by comparing the XSs for the virtual environment for reactor application-benchmark pin-cell problem, as well as the heterogeneous pin cell containing burned fuel with McCARD. The method works well for homogeneous, as well as heterogeneous configurations...|$|E
