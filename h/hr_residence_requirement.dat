40|$|New {{alternative}} {{processes for}} the continuous production of gluconic acid by Aureobasidium pullulans, using biomass retention by cell immobilization or cross over filtration, {{are described in}} the present work. 315 g/l gluconic acid was continuously produced in chemostat cultures at 21 <b>hrs</b> <b>residence</b> time without any biomass retention. 260 g/l gluconic acid was produced in fluidized bed reactor at 21 <b>hrs</b> <b>residence</b> time. The support carrier was overgrown resulting in limitations of oxygen transfer towards the inner layers of immobilized biomass. 375 g/l gluconic acid was produced under continuous cultivation at 22 <b>hrs</b> of <b>residence</b> time with a formation rate for the generic product of 17 g/(l x h) and a specific gluconic acid productivity of only 0. 74 g/(g x h), using biomass retention by cross over filtration. 370 g/l were obtained at 19 hrs RT and 100 % conversion with 25 g/l biomass and a formation rate of 19 g/(l x h). At 100 % conversion, a selectivity of only 78 % was determined at 22 hrs and of 77 % at 19 hrs RT, because of the very high biomass concentration. Biomass retention makes it possible to break the existing link between growth and residence time...|$|R

40|$|This comment {{argues that}} the Court of Final Appeal (CFA) in Kong Yunming has erred insofar as it applied the {{proportionality}} analysis vis-à-vis any restriction placed on the Art 36 right to social welfare. Even if the CFA was right to apply the proportionality analysis, {{it is argued that}} there is a rational connection between the 7 -year <b>residence</b> <b>requirement</b> and the Government’s aim of ensuring the sustainability of the welfare system by addressing the problems raised by the following issues: (a) immigration from the Mainland under the One-Way Permit scheme; (b) Hong Kong’s ageing population; and (c) the rise in Comprehensive Social Security Assistance Scheme expenditure. Finally, even if the impugned 7 -year <b>residence</b> <b>requirement</b> was unconstitutional, the CFA should have issued a temporary suspension order, rather than restore the 1 -year <b>residence</b> <b>requirement.</b> published_or_final_versio...|$|R
