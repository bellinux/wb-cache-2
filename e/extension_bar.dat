5000|$|Pistols {{made and}} {{imported}} by Glock Ges.m.b.H., {{such as the}} Glock 17, incorporate a design with three levels of integrated safety, known as safe action; there are no external safety switches on these handguns. First, an integrated trigger latch prevents the trigger body from moving unless the trigger is positively squeezed. Second, the gun's striker-firing mechanism is locked in place by an <b>extension</b> <b>bar</b> linked to the trigger; the striker cannot move unless the trigger is depressed. Third, as with most pistols, a firing pin block actuated by the same <b>extension</b> <b>bar</b> prevents the pin coming {{into contact with the}} primer unless the trigger is pulled to clear the block. Although not generally considered a safety feature, the resting state of the gun (excluding a dry/misfire) has the striker in a [...] "half-cocked" [...] state; pulling the trigger will fully cock the weapon before releasing the striker, and the mechanism is designed to have insufficient force to ignite the primer of an active cartridge from this state even if the sear lock and firing pin block both fail.|$|E

30|$|Bone {{formations}} {{along the}} main {{central part of the}} implant (<b>extension</b> <b>bar,</b> lumbar extension rod) occurred in {{more than half of the}} patients. The causes remain hypothetical: patient characteristics such as the individual potential for bone formation, extensive dissection, local haematoma along the implant within the subfacial-submuscular tunnel, damage to the soft tissues or rib periosteum, bacterial colonization and infection, recurrent surgery and local inflammation, as well as the implant’s bulkiness and material properties may all play a role [14, 20, 29, 32, 35]. Type II ossifications are the most troublesome, since they may lead to either direct stiffening of the thorax or restricted spine motion (although they are remote from the spine), which may limit the effect of further device expansion over time by acting as a powerful lateral tether [29]. This phenomenon, called “the law of diminishing returns”, is also encountered in patients with spine-based expandable implants [24, 29].|$|E

However the solution with four implants connected with a bar and a prosthetic superstructure seems to gain more trust. This study aims to present the technological steps of the four connected bar implants with an all ceramic superstructure.

The numerical simulation method was employed in order to assess the tensions in the structures. The results pointed out the decreasing in tensions in the structures when the four implants were connected with a bar in compare with two single or two implants connected by a bar situations. The interfaces between the implants and the mandibular bone are decreasing while the tensions in the bar remain approximately the same with the ones in four implants connected with an <b>extension</b> <b>bar.</b> The connected bar was obtained by SLS/SLM technology.

40|$|A way {{to measure}} muscle {{activity}} is through electromyography (EMG) analysis. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine, via EMG, which triceps exercise elicited the most muscle activation, and which could be defined as the most effective triceps exercise. Fifteen female college students (20 - 24 years old) volunteered and completed this study. On the first day of testing, a one-repetition max (1 RM) was determined for the following exercises: triceps kickbacks, overhead triceps <b>extensions,</b> <b>bar</b> pushdowns, rope pushdowns, closed grip bench press and lying barbell triceps extensions. Dips and triangle push-ups were excluded, as those exercises use body weight as resistance. During the second testing session, subjects performed two, 6 -second isometric contractions to determine a maximal voluntary isometric contraction. Subjects performed one set of seven repetitions for each of the eight exercises. Subjects lifted 70 % of their 1 RM. For the combined EMG values of the entire movement (average of the long head and lateral head), there was not a significant difference between the triangle push-up, kickbacks, and dips. Similarly, for both the long and lateral heads, there was not a significant difference between the triangle push-up, kickbacks, or dips. There was a significant difference (p <. 05) between the long and lateral muscle activation during the rope pushdowns, bar pushdowns and lying barbell triceps extensions. This study concludes that triangle pushups were the best triceps exercise, although kickbacks and dips were equally effective in targeting the triceps brachii muscle...|$|R

30|$|Ossifications of the {{thoracic}} wall deserve special attention. Half {{of the patients}} without pre-existing congenital rib fusions developed an ossification along the <b>extension</b> <b>bar</b> of their rib-to-rib, rib-to-spine or rib-to pelvic implant. This may {{have little or no}} immediate effect on the compliance of the rib cage as long as the stiff titanium implant is in situ, but an intercostal bony bridge hinders lengthening and may affect regional chest wall motion and global chest wall compliance. It should therefore be removed at the time of implant expansion [9]. Instead of an easy, short expansion operation over a small skin incision, exposure and—occasionally—temporary removal of the implant might be indicated in order to provide full access to the ossification and its complete removal. With new-generation magnetic implants, this would even mean an unwanted return to the operating room. There are currently no data on the re-occurrence of such a bridge, the potential effect of remaining fibrous scars and the benefit of removal on pulmonary function. In cases with pre-existing congenital rib fusions, the effect on chest wall compliance might not be as pronounced as in cases with previously normal anatomy. However, it corrupts the goal of maximal thorax expansion during the course of repeat VEPTR lengthening over the years. Type II ossification may also play an important role when it comes to removal of the VEPTR towards the end of growth with or without instrumented fusion of the affected levels. They may not be recognized and—apart from autofusion due to the immobilizing effect of any spinal and paraspinal implant—may compromise the final correction of the deformity [1, 18]. When the affected levels are not included in the definitive fusion at the end of spinal growth, motion will be restricted.|$|E

40|$|Mechanical {{properties}} (seismic velocities and attenuation) of geological {{materials are}} often frequency dependent, which necessitates {{measurements of the}} properties at frequencies relevant to a problem at hand. Conventional acoustic resonant bar tests allow measuring seismic properties of rocks and sediments at sonic frequencies (several kilohertz) that {{are close to the}} frequencies employed for geophysical exploration of oil and gas resources. However, the tests require a long, slender sample, which is often difficult to obtain from the deep subsurface or from weak and fractured geological formations. In this paper, an alternative measurement technique to conventional resonant bar tests is presented. This technique uses only a small, jacketed rock or sediment core sample mediating a pair of long, metal <b>extension</b> <b>bars</b> with attached seismic source and receiver - the same geometry as the split Hopkinson pressure bar test for large-strain, dynamic impact experiments. Because of the length and mass added to the sample, the resonance frequency of the entire system can be lowered significantly, compared to the sample alone. The experiment can be conducted under elevated confining pressures up to tens of MPa and temperatures above 100 C, and concurrently with x-ray CT imaging. The described Split Hopkinson Resonant Bar (SHRB) test is applied in two steps. First, extension and torsion-mode resonance frequencies and attenuation of the entire system are measured. Next, numerical inversions for the complex Young's and shear moduli of the sample are performed. One particularly important step is the correction of the inverted Young's moduli for the effect of sample-rod interfaces. Examples of the application are given for homogeneous, isotropic polymer samples and a natural rock sample...|$|R

We propose a new adaptation strategy, split interfaces, which speeds access to common interface features without disorienting the user. We present a customization facility that allows designers and end users to override Supple’s automatic rendering decisions. We describe a distributed architecture which enables computationally-impoverished devices to benefit from Supple interfaces. Finally, we present experiments and a preliminary user-study that demonstrate the practicality of our approach. ...|$|R
