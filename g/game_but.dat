5|$|In the asylum, Batman {{is faced}} with several supervillains; he must defend himself from an enraged Bane (Fred Tatasciore), subdue {{indiscriminate}} serial killer Victor Zsasz (Danny Jacobs), confront the monstrous Killer Croc (Steven Blum), defeat the plant-controlling Poison Ivy (Tasia Valenza), and battle his way through hallucinogen-induced nightmares created by the Scarecrow (Dino Andrade). The Riddler (Wally Wingert) does not physically appear in the <b>game,</b> <b>but</b> communicates with Batman and challenges him to solve riddles placed around the island. Other characters appearing in the game include the asylum's warden Quincy Sharp (also voiced by Kane), Batman's parents Thomas and Martha Wayne (voiced by Conroy and Valenza respectively), and asylum guard Aaron Cash (Duane R Shepard, Sr). The shape-shifting Clayface appears in cameo, taking on the guise of other characters {{as he tries to}} trick the player into releasing him.

5|$|The {{developers}} {{intended to}} use other Batman characters in the <b>game,</b> <b>but</b> these were removed when it was decided they would not work within the story. For example, Batman's enemy Mr. Freeze did not fit because the character has different motivations to the Joker. Unlike the Riddler, who is obsessed with proving his superiority over Batman, Mr. Freeze does not hold a personal grudge against Batman, and Mr. Freeze would not care about the other villains' plans. A garden maze under Poison Ivy's control was considered as a location; she could grow it in different directions. In its center, Batman would find the Mad Hatter hosting a tea-party, but the developers decided these ideas would not match the game's tone. Batman's vehicles, the Batmobile and Batwing, were considered {{for inclusion in the}} <b>game,</b> <b>but</b> developing unique control mechanics and gameplay segments for them would have taken too much time, and compromised its quality; the vehicles appear in the <b>game,</b> <b>but</b> players cannot control them.|$|E
