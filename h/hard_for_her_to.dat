25|$|The lizards' {{communication}} is somewhat {{similar to their}} human counterparts. Like Nancy, Sarah is more open to the humans and more interested in their world. She is also emotional, and when Charlie asks her a question that is <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> understand (what she would do if Leslie disappeared), she becomes distraught, leading to a confrontation. Leslie shares Charlie's attitude; he does not trust the humans and regards most everything they say with skepticism. Despite these problems, {{at the end of}} the play, some measure of trust is reached between all of them. Leslie decides that he and Sarah will stay on land when Nancy and Charlie, albeit reluctantly, offer to help them.|$|E

She said, [...] "It’s <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> say goodbye and <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> leave...She wants somebody there but she is very broken inside." [...] After years of uncertainty, in which Liam is involved with Hope and Steffy, married to Steffy twice, never legally married to Hope, Steffy becomes pregnant with his child in 2013. Wood was shocked, and said that Steffy is a [...] "wild child" [...] who likes to go to nightclubs and ride motorcycles, but [...] "everything just stops" [...] with her pregnancy. Initially, Steffy does not tell Liam about the baby because she sees him in bed with Hope, and leaves for Paris. Liam discovers the truth and he marries Steffy at the Forrester Mansion. Just before discovering Steffy is carrying his child, Liam nearly marries Hope in a [...] "room service elopement" [...] scheme arranged by Brooke; an ambush that was described as [...] "evil" [...] by Daytime Confidential. Wood felt that Steffy is more mature and level-headed {{as a result of}} her pregnancy. Steffy later loses the child in a motorbike accident, and becomes unconscious.|$|E

The American Broadcasting Company {{describes}} {{her as a}} [...] "fiercely competitive and naturally gifted" [...] person, who can read people instantly which makes it <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> trust anyone, making her relationships short lived. At the 2015 Television Critics Associations Summer Press Tour, Chopra said that she chose the series as her first television project because of the character's appeal, comparing her to [...] "the female Jason Bourne". Chopra chose to depict the character as tough but also feminine, saying [...] "She's as smart as that, but she is also vulnerable and soft. I didn't want to make Alex extremely macho, I wanted to celebrate femininity. You can be an absolute woman and also be smart and tough and not lose your femininity." ...|$|E

She compared it to writing the season six finale, by explaining that the former was [...] "more painful" [...] to write. After the episode aired, Rhimes repeated in a tweet that it was <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> write the finale, adding: [...] "I did not enjoy it. It made me sick and it made me sad." [...] Rhimes also explained the departure of Leigh, whose character died after the plane crash, by saying that the two came to an agreement on the decision to kill Lexie, after extensive discussion. Speaking of Raver's departure whose character left Seattle Grace for MEDCOM, Rhimes elaborated that Raver was offered a contract renewal, but declined.|$|E

[...] Rihanna then shows her dressing room, makeup artists and costumes. She explains how she loves wearing black on stage because she is [...] "good girl gone bad and black is kind of gothic and rock n' roll". Rihanna explains how she is nervous before the beginning of the show because of the atmosphere where all of her fans are screaming her name. According to her, the beginning of the show is up-tempo and loud, before becoming a little bit [...] "mellow" [...] at the middle of it. The show then gets [...] "on party" [...] again with their techno club set-list. The encore consists of [...] "Question Existing" [...] and [...] "Umbrella". According to Rihanna, [...] "Question Existing" [...] is a very personal song which American singer Ne-Yo wrote [...] "on behalf of entertainers". She concluded that it is very <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> call herself a superstar.

500|$|Sex {{has also}} become an {{important}} book in the LGBT community. Ben Shapiro, author of Porn Generation: How Social Liberalism Is Corrupting Our Future, wrote that due to its iconic status [...] "Sex adorns the coffee tables of hundreds of gay men and sperm banks". Mark Blankenship, from the LGBT-oriented website New Now Next stated that [...] "literature changed forever" [...] with the publishing of Sex. Madonna's portrayal of lesbian love scenes in the book sparked debates about her own sexual orientation. This was an adjunct to the singer's public relationship with comedian Sandra Bernhard, with whom she cavorted around, visiting lesbian night-clubs as well as partying. The LGBT community felt {{it was an important}} portrayal for them. They debated whether Madonna was [...] "ripping" [...] them off for publicity. As Carolin Grace from Diva magazine noted: [...] "Madonna became meaningful in early nineties, when Sex came out, and at that point lesbian culture was really changing." [...] She noted how women were coming out about their sexuality and the book's handling of the taboo issue were [...] "a legacy, our contribution to the show. The lesbian sub-cultural references borrowed by Madonna aren't our only possessions." [...] O'Brien argues in her book , that the book had a confusing philosophy. According to the female critics, who pointed out the vacuousness of Madonna's remarks about porn and abuse, the singer did not have a correct idea that behind these fantasies the [...] "reality is too <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> endure", referring to the daily hustles that women have to face at red light districts and brothels. The author felt that despite the courageous premise of genuine exploration of queer sex, the book crossed over into pornography and a wrong portrayal for the community, while being flippant and commercial. She drew an example of the death of pornographic actor Joey Stefano, one of the models of the book, from drug overdose. Stefano had been thrilled {{to be a part of}} the book, but was underpaid. Once Madonna and her team were done with the shoot, [...] "they packed up and left the Gaiety... They left behind the mundane reality and the boys who have to deal with it seven days a week." ...|$|E

Describing training conditions for competitive figure skaters, Kim {{said in an}} October 2010 interview with CNN, [...] "During my early skating years, there were not many ice rinks in Korea and even the few rinks that existed, {{most of them were}} public. Even now, when athletes want to practice, they have to use the rink very early [...] morning or late at night. Also, as there aren't enough ice rinks to facilitate all the figure skating teams, skaters often have to train in different rinks from day to day. Furthermore, as most rinks are too cold, there is always high possibility of injury." [...] As proper skate shops were also lacking, Kim frequently had to wear ill-fitting skates in her teenage years, making it <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> balance and resulting in many injuries.|$|E

2500|$|Debnam-Carey {{viewed the}} {{betrayal}} as a relief and release for {{herself as an}} actor, and as a [...] "very honest" [...] and [...] "open" [...] moment for Lexa.

She said Clarke's portrayer, Eliza Taylor, was [...] "brilliant" [...] and [...] "great to work with and between the two of us, we were just very connected with each other and made sure that that was the strong force of that scene." [...] To Debnam-Carey, Lexa [...] "showing that she cared, even in that moment of betrayal" [...] was Lexa being real. Debnam-Carey argued that even though Lexa was upset by the betrayal, she is a very hardened person and her people continued to be her main concern.

I'm not in that place anymore, like where I'm sad about it. I'm in a very forgiving place about it and everybody's human. But I think I get really choked up because I just realize how lucky I am... And {{a lot of girls}} that grew up with their daddy issues and with not having that figure in their life, you know, take a very different road, and I just feel lucky that I'm not that girl." [...] To promote the album, Clarkson had also performed the song in a stripped-down performance as part of her set list during her Piece by Piece Tour. On February 25, 2016, she performed [...] "Piece by Piece" [...] in a live performance a year after its release on the fifteenth season of American Idol. Her rendition of the song was met with a standing ovation from the audience and critical acclaim from music critics— with Olivia Waring Metro praising it as poignant while USA Todays Erin Jensen describing it as a [...] "heartfelt performance that we just can't get enough of". On March 3, 2016, Clarkson appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show where she discussed her American Idol performance and closed the program with a rendition of the song.|$|E
2500|$|When Jackson {{returned}} to the role, he was given multiple emotional storylines that continually put Lucky in tragic situations. As Jackson resumed the character in October 2009, Lucky is unaware that Elizabeth, his fiancée again, is {{having an affair with}} his brother Nikolas. What started as a joke grows into a physical relationship the same night Elizabeth accepts Lucky's remarriage proposal. Herbst explained to Comcast: [...] "I truly believe that [...] is in love with Lucky and has been in love with him her entire life. But what happened with Nikolas caught her by surprise as much as everybody else. It's <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> articulate it. She just knows that Nikolas did make her feel more like a woman and that in her relationship with Lucky she's very much still that 16-year-old girl that constantly needs to be saved. That's kind of the role that Lucky has played in her life." [...] When Lucky eventually walks in on her with Nikolas, he does not say anything and instead trashes his house and resumes drinking. J Bernard Jones from entertainment website Zap2it described that Lucky: [...] "generally was an emotional wreck, careening all over the place like a pinball. On the other hand, whenever Lucky was with Elizabeth or Nikolas he was cold and detached, imbuing just enough of Jackson's trademark sincerity (some would say over-earnestness) to knock the two cheatin' hearts off-kilter." [...] Lucky is irate by the time he confronts them. Herbst described the scene: [...] "Jonathan actually seemed like one more step {{and he was going to}} take my head off. Honestly, it was not so hard to be present when he was yelling at me like he did." [...] Jones from Zap2it stated that in the confrontation scenes: [...] "Jackson accomplished a much harder task than simply reclaiming the Lucky mantle: he has bridged the gap between his previous run, Jacob Young's and most recently, Greg Vaughan's. Now Lucky seems like a whole person once again, as opposed to a fractured character sliced up over the years by the writers, and fractured by fan loyalties." [...] Lucky, Nikolas and Elizabeth soon learn that Elizabeth is pregnant, and either brother could be the father. Jackson explained Lucky's position: ...|$|E
