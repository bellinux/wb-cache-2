According to engineer Geoff Emerick, [...] "the Beatles {{were looking to}} <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>limb,</b> both musically and sonically... we were utilising a lot of tape varispeeding and other manipulation techniques... limiters and... effects like flanging and ADT." [...] Their recording of [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] required a forty-piece orchestra, which Martin and McCartney took turns conducting. The sessions produced the double A-side single [...] "Strawberry Fields Forever"/"Penny Lane" [...] in February 1967, and the LP followed in June. McCartney's [...] "She's Leaving Home" [...] was an orchestral pop song. MacDonald described the track as [...] " [...] the finest work on Sgt. Pepper—imperishable popular art of its time". Based on an ink drawing by McCartney, the LP's cover included a collage designed by pop artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth, featuring the Beatles in costume as the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, standing {{with a host of}} celebrities. The heavy moustaches worn by the Beatles reflected the growing influence of hippie style trends on the band, while their clothing [...] "spoofed the vogue in Britain for military fashions", wrote Gould. Scholar David Scott Kastan described Sgt. Pepper as [...] "the most important and influential rock-and-roll album ever recorded".|$|E

Kennedy had already {{appointed}} landscape architect Hideo Sasaki, to the commission in 1962. Kennedy privately criticized the Eisenhower commission for [...] "spread a mantle of mediocrity and middle age over the city", and he was now determined to remake the CFA into a body that would promote modern ideas of art and architecture. Walton advised Kennedy on who to appoint to the CFA. The new commissioners included architect Gordon Bunshaft, architect Burnham Kelly, architect John Carl Warnecke (a friend of the Kennedys), sculptor Theodore Roszak, and art critic Aline B. Saarinen. Although Walton himself did not lobby for a position, Kennedy named him to the commission as well. Kennedy warned him, however, that the administration had limited political capital to spend on the arts and that Walton should never put Kennedy {{in a position where}} the president would have to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>limb</b> to rescue him. Walton's chairmanship was easy-going. His leadership style was informal and collegial, and he pushed the commission to shape and prod designers rather than tell them what to do.|$|E

50|$|Burkhard {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{original}} and diverse composers of his generation; he wrote operas, oratorios, sonatas, suites, serenades, cantatas, concertos, organ music, orchestral charts, and chamber music as well. Burkhard believed that it was the composers mission to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>limb</b> to create and discover new modes of expression by combining the old ones, but never following already set musical fashions. The trick was to create a new unique sound that resounded as one solid stylistic sound as that reflected some of what the composer's personality entailed. He would teach his students exactly this and never steer them away from their original findings.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the early}} days of the Reagan Administration, steel firms won {{substantial}} tax breaks in order to deal with imported goods. Instead of modernizing their mills, steel companies shifted capital out of steel and into more profitable areas. In March 1982, U.S. Steel took its concessions and paid $1.4 billion in cash and $4.7 billion in loans for Marathon Oil, saving approximately $500 million in taxes through the merger. The architect of tax concessions to steel firms, Senator Arlen Specter (R-PA), complained that [...] "we <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>limb</b> in Congress and we feel they should be putting it in steel."

There are great gobs of sadness, original comic touches and just the right blend of plot and narrative comments to make this a huge pleasure to read and a learning experience to boot. Fraser has always [...] "owned" [...] the restless, wandering Maritimer as a fictional character, but this complex, exasperating 'split personality character Quann' and the believable world(s) created for him is a real coup. There are so many fresh and honest insights into relationships that I haven't come across before in fiction. And having lived in 1960s Montreal — he's nailed that one solidly .... Great job!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Schmidt has {{publicly}} expressed {{his thoughts on}} various baseball controversies. He has been a vocal advocate for the reinstatement of Pete Rose to baseball.

[...] In his 2006 book, Clearing the Bases: Juiced Players, Monster Salaries, Sham Records, and a Hall of Famers Search for the Soul of Baseball, he somewhat recanted that statement, saying that he understood the desire to get a competitive advantage even though he could not condone breaking the rules to do so.|$|E

The newly created dance tracks firmly match up with the song rhythms, especially if you find music youd actually dance to in real life. The feature works great, and often creates some stellar fun from music that (gasp!) youd actually want to listen to!...The games not perfect by any means, but this is an idea that is long overdue, and I, for one, think it deserves some props." ...|$|E

But coach Stan Heath kept Mercer on scholarship, hoping he would stick around and earn his degree, and after Mercer graduated in August 2009 and fulfilled the legal requirements of a pretrial intervention program to get a misdemeanor drug charge dropped, Heath took a chance by allowing Mercer back on the team for the 2009-10 season. Heath's decision paid dividends, as Mercer became {{a key part of}} the Bulls' emergence in 2009-10. In February 2010, Mercer expressed how grateful he was to be part of a team making a run at the NCAA Tournament: [...] "Coming back has been a blessing.

It may very well be the best new show premiering this fall. It’s a smart, un-condescending cop show that is anchored by a fantastic performance by Maria Bello". Eric Blattberg said, [...] "What makes Prime Suspect compelling enough to see where this show goes is its remarkable cast. This show is not actually bad at all; it's an enjoyable hour, but it's going to need {{a lot of work to}} avoid being lost in the shuffle amongst other established police shows.

The novelist Karen Karbo, reviewing the novel in The New York Times, writes: With '"Layover," [...] Zeidner joins the ranks of Doris Lessing, Margaret Atwood and Fay Weldon, all of whom have written in the women-spiraling-into-madness genre. But Claire is something new. Unlike would-be female nut cases from an earlier time, she doesn't set off on her journey needing to shuck her good-wife persona. She highlights the appropriateness of the name [...] "Newbold", and considers that the novel [...] "really begins to soar" [...] after Claire seduces the teenager, adding: There are few aspects of a novel more compelling than watching the writer <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>limb,</b> wondering how dare she. Claire's odyssey of lust, seduction, desire, control ... never veers from {{what we think of as}} classic male acting out, which forces us to examine why we would more easily accept such behavior in a bereaved father than in a bereaved mother. The review focuses on the novel's treatment of grief, which Karbo describes as [...] "wise and shrewd", and highlights the way in which Claire fails to grieve in an acceptable fashion.|$|E
