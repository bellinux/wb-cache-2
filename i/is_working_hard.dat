500|$|Solid feeds {{are placed}} into three categories: [...] forages (such as hay and grass), {{concentrates}} (including grain or pelleted rations), and supplements (such as prepared vitamin or mineral pellets). [...] Equine nutritionists recommend that 50% {{or more of}} the animal's diet by weight should be forages. [...] If a horse <b>is</b> <b>working</b> <b>hard</b> and requires more energy, the use of grain is increased and the percentage of forage decreased so that the horse obtains the energy content it needs for the work it is performing. [...] However, forage amount should never go below 1% of the horse's body weight per day.|$|E

2500|$|O'Brien is {{a strong}} batsman, {{with the ability to}} clear the ropes. In his record-breaking century against England in the 2011 World Cup he hit the longest six of the tournament. His brother Niall stated that [...] "in the field he was grumpy, he was moping around... when he's like that, he tends to kinda take the bull by the horns". In March 2011 Ireland's coach, Phil Simmons, remarked of O'Brien that [...] "There's a lot more thought to his batting and he has worked on {{different}} things like batting against spin.

2500|$|In Office at Night (1940), another [...] "couple" [...] painting, Hopper {{creates a}} {{psychological}} puzzle. The painting shows a man focusing {{on his work}} papers, while nearby his attractive female secretary pulls a file. Several studies for the painting show how Hopper experimented with the positioning of the two figures, perhaps to heighten the eroticism and the tension. Hopper presents the viewer with the possibilities that the man is either truly uninterested in the woman's appeal or that he <b>is</b> <b>working</b> <b>hard</b> to ignore her. Another interesting aspect of the painting is how Hopper employs three light sources, from a desk lamp, through a window and indirect light from above. Hopper went on to make several [...] "office" [...] pictures, but none with a sensual undercurrent.|$|E

2500|$|Buffalo Gap National Grassland located {{primarily}} in southwestern South Dakota, United States, {{is the second}} largest National Grassland {{in the country and}} covers almost 600,000 acres. [...] The area is mixed prairie and chalky badlands and managed by the U.S. Forest Service. Within this grassland, the Cheyenne River watershed contains some of the finest examples of potential prairie wilderness left in the nation, including the largest remaining roadless area in the Great Plains. Three areas—Red Shirt, Indian Creek, and Chalk Hills—have been proposed for wilderness designation by the South Dakota Wild Grassland Coalition, which <b>is</b> <b>working</b> <b>hard</b> to protect these areas as a legacy to South Dakotans. Red Shirt comprises approximately 16,000 acres and is characterized by colorful striped buttes, mounds and cones rising to stunning grassy plateaus and ridge lines, with Schumacher Canyon and its exposed layers of color-banded clays on steep slopes as its centerpiece. It is northwest of the Pine Ridge Native Reservation and was used by the Lakota for shelter, food, medicinal plants, and burial sites until the Native Wars ended. One can still find remnants of that time throughout the area. Red Shirt borders Black Hills National Forest, where the contrast in landscapes is marked. Black Elk Wilderness, which lies within the forest, contains Black Elk Peak, the highest U.S. pinnacle east of the Rocky Mountains. Hikers can get a stunning view of this from Red Shirt.|$|E
