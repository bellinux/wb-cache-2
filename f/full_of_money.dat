25|$|With {{the reason}} for the late arrival of help {{explained}} (the surveillance team got bored and watched the football instead), and Edna removed, Maurice has mixed reactions about the outcome – he got the suspect and the drugs, but he does not relish the prospect of explaining the missing money. He, Tracy and Tommy leave, and then Sam retrieves the real briefcase <b>full</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> from the extra secret compartment in the table that Maurice didn't know about. He promises Rosie a tomorrow richer in every way, and they disappear into the shower. Then Maurice and Tracy return and take the money, with Tracy giving Maurice a kiss. They depart, with Maurice quietly wishing Rosie the luck she'll need.|$|E

As for John, why, after all, he was just as well satisfied to keep his treasure for himself. So the two shook hands, and then Jacob Stuck jogged away alone, leaving John stuffing his pockets and his hat <b>full</b> <b>of</b> gold <b>money,</b> and I should have liked to have been there, to have had my share.|$|R

He was decorated 17 times for bravery and honor, and was described by colleagues as hard-working and kind. In February 1986, Mendoza led a group of policemen that accosted a van carrying 13 crates <b>full</b> <b>of</b> <b>money,</b> which former Philippine president and dictator Ferdinand Marcos was apparently trying to smuggle out of the country. Mendoza and his team turned the shipment over to authorities, for which he was declared one of the Ten Outstanding Policemen of the Philippines by the Jaycees International that year.|$|E
25|$|The {{setting of}} the SIS offices was {{featured}} in the James Bond films GoldenEye, The World Is Not Enough, Die Another Day, Skyfall and Spectre. SIS allowed filming of the building itself {{for the first time}} in The World is Not Enough for the pre-credits sequence, where a bomb hidden in a briefcase <b>full</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> is detonated inside the building. A Daily Telegraph article said that the British government opposed the filming, but this was denied by a Foreign Office spokesperson. In Skyfall the building is once again attacked by an explosion, this time by a cyber attack turning on a gas line and igniting the fumes, after which SIS operations are moved to a secret underground facility. In Spectre, the evil head of crime organisation SPECTRE, Ernst Stavro Blofeld, traps Agent 007 James Bond alongside the film's Bond girl Dr. Madeleine Swann inside the remains of the building. Blofeld then detonated bombs planted in the building, demolishing what was left of the building fully, though Bond managed to save Dr. Swann and escape before the building exploded.|$|E
25|$|Its story {{focuses on}} the trials of a young cop named Charlie, played by Geoffrey Kennedy, who at the {{beginning}} receives a phone call summoning him for what is presumably his first job. As he leaves his desk, the camera zooms in on a photograph of him standing next to his older brother Brian, played by Brian Krause, {{who is also a}} cop. The film then begins playing the song “Spore” as Charlie joins his brother and a third cop as they enter a residence where they find a dead girl and arrest two thugs, one played by Todd La Torre, as they return to the scene with a bag <b>full</b> <b>of</b> <b>money.</b> The second thug lunges at Brian when he pilfers some of the cash but Charlie restrains him. Later, the chief of police, played by R.J. Adams, is seen looking through a window as the second thug is telling a detective to just ask Charlie about what Brian did during the bust. The chief summons Brian and Charlie to his office where he demands the former to come clean with them but Brian is defiant, forcing the chief to remind him that his brother saw the whole thing. Charlie denies this at first but when the chief threatens to take punitive action against him as well and picks up the phone, he tells them where his brother hid the money, forcing Brian to surrender his badge and gun. Enraged at his brother for rolling on him, Brian physically assaults Charlie later in the police station's parking garage and then makes a quick getaway in a pickup truck driven by La Torre. While recovering at the hospital, Charlie finds solace with a kind and beautiful nurse named Cathy, played by Cathy Baron, {{and the two of them}} later get married. However, the film then rolls into the song “Midnight Lullaby” as Cathy is seen screaming and crying in agony as she dies during childbirth, leaving Charlie to raise their child alone.|$|E

500|$|The Jones-produced {{sessions}} {{started in}} April 1969 at EMI Studios. After {{the first of}} these sessions, Barrett brought in friends to help out: Humble Pie drummer Jerry Shirley, and Jokers Wild (Gilmour's old band) drummer Willie Wilson. For the sessions, Gilmour played bass. Talking to Barrett wasn't easy, said Jones: [...] "It was a case of following him, not playing with him. They were seeing and then playing so they were always a note behind". A few tracks on the album feature overdubs by members of the band Soft Machine. During this time, Barrett also played guitar on the sessions for Soft Machine founder Kevin Ayers' debut LP Joy of a Toy, although his performance on [...] "Religious Experience" [...] (later titled [...] "Singing a Song in the Morning") was not released until the album was reissued in 2003. One time, Barrett had told his flatmate that he was going off [...] "for an afternoon drive". However, he followed Pink Floyd to Ibiza (according to legend, he skipped check-ins and customs, ran onto the runway and attempted to flag down a jet). One of his friends, J. Ryan Eaves, bass player for the short-lived but influential Manchester band [...] "York's Ensemble", later spotted him on a beach wearing messed-up clothes and with a carrier bag <b>full</b> <b>of</b> <b>money.</b> By this point, during the trip, Barrett had asked Gilmour for his help in the recording sessions.|$|E

2500|$|Zen Studios Managing Director Zsolt Kigyossy {{detailed}} {{the reasons for}} focusing primarily on pinball games. [...] "We have guys in the studio who have spent countless hours and pockets <b>full</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> at arcades playing pinball." [...] Kigyossy explained that the design process for the tables begins with a conceptual design on paper. [...] Basic 3D models and shapes are then created and implemented into a test environment. [...] The artists then add graphical details and animations. [...] Once gameplay and visual design is complete a final pass is made [...] "properly lighting the table, so the tables becomes lifelike." [...] Simultaneously other designers work on the LED display system, sound and gameplay mechanics. [...] The game then spends {{two to three months}} in testing before the table is considered ready for release. [...] The entire process takes approximately six months per table. [...] Kigyossy further stated the team plans to [...] "keep the tables coming, support our games long term, and give fans a great selection to choose from." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Live Your Life" [...] was filmed in October 2008 in Los Angeles and was {{directed}} by Anthony Mandler. The video, using the radio edit of the song, stars T.I. and Rihanna. It plays backwards, starting {{with the end of}} T.I.'s day. In the opening scene T.I. is shown walking with bloody wounds culminating in the song beginning. It then goes from a series of underground shots of him with interspersed scenes of Rihanna in a dressing room. T.I. is then shown being thrown out of a car, being kicked by a large man. The video then cuts again to the day with T.I. wearing the same suit seen earlier in the video, but undamaged. He then encounters a group of thugs whom he brawls with. The video then begins a different story arc, showing T.I. before he made his fortune, singing in a recording studio and in front of a house playing dice and dominoes with friends. This portion of the video is interspersed with clips of the other story arc, such as showing T.I. with a briefcase <b>full</b> <b>of</b> <b>money.</b> He is then shown in the bathroom of a bar, before walking out into the bar passing Rihanna who has exited her dressing room. Rihanna performs on stage with a microphone while T.I. talks to a man saying [...] " [...] want out."; the man replies by explaining that there is no getting out, not for him nor for the character that Rihanna plays. T.I slams the money briefcase down on the table and shows it to the man saying that [...] "I'm done. I got myself here, I'll get myself out". Then he is seen walking into that same bar, in a flashback, with a CD in his hand. The man that T.I. spoke to earlier calls him over. This is a flashback showing T.I. trying to get a record deal. The last shot of the video takes place at around {{the same time as the}} first shot of the video. T.I. is walking down the Los Angeles River, raising his hands triumphantly in the air with a bloodied and scarred face. The song's producer, Just Blaze, is briefly seen playing pool in the bar during the second verse and final chorus.|$|E
