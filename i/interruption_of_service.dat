50|$|A {{compromise}} between undergrounding and using overhead lines is installing air cables. Aerial cables are insulated cables spun between poles {{and used for}} power transmission or telecommunication services. An advantage of aerial cables is that their insulation removes the danger of electric shock (unless the cables are damaged). Another advantage is that they forgo the costs - particularly high in rocky areas - of burying. The disadvantages of aerial cables are {{that they have the}} same aesthetic issues as standard overhead lines and that they can be affected by storms. However if the insulation is not destroyed during pylon failure or when hit by a tree, there is no <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>service.</b> Electrical hazards are minimised and re-hanging the cables may be possible without power interruption.|$|E

50|$|The {{son of a}} grocer, Atwood {{was born}} May 25, 1924, in Haverhill, Massachusetts, 40 miles North of Boston. He lived on a small farm {{adjoining}} the ancestral home of the Quaker poet John Greenleaf Whittier. Life on a small farm gave him a fascination with things mechanical and an appreciation for hard work. His parents' ambitions were to provide for him the opportunities they did not have. Following high school, Atwood was sent to Worcester Academy, a one-year college preparatory school. There he became very interested in things technical. Atwood attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), with an <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> in Burma with the U.S. Army Signal Corps from 1943 to 1946. When he returned to MIT, Atwood married Sue Harian, a graduate of Tufts University, and completed his bachelor's and master's degrees in electrical engineering. He served as a research associate in MIT's Instrumentation Laboratory from 1948 to 1952. The head of the instrumentation lab was Dr. C. Stark Draper, the father of inertial guidance and navigation. Under Draper, Atwood contributed numerous patents to the science and became an expert in navigation and guidance electronics and systems engineering.|$|E

Besides the Dresdner and Hamburger Bahnhöfe (which were not operating by the time of WWII) all of Berlin’s other rail termini suffered a similar fate, leaving a network that remained fragmented and inconvenient for decades, exacerbated by the Division of Berlin and the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961 (see below).|$|R
