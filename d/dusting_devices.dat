40|$|Dustacators (combination mineral feeders and {{livestock}} <b>dusting</b> <b>devices)</b> {{were used for}} four beef herds at Kansas State University in 1985. Loose mineral was supplied in all four Dustacator tubs, which were adjusted to low settings. Permethrin dust had no apparent effect on horn flies. Co-Ral® from two sources and Rabon® provided approximately 65 % horn fly reduction during the 53 -day test period. The 1986 experiment compared the effects of Dustacator mineral tub height adjustments and loose vs. block mineral. Co-Hal 1 % dust from a single source was used in all treatments on two Simmental herds and two Polled Hereford herds. Excellent horn fly control was achieved and maintained except for a temporary increase in horn fly numbers in early September in all treatments. Face fly control was inadequate in all treatments in both years. Use of block mineral was related to reduced mineral consumption and self-application of more insecticide dust. High tub adjustment was related to greater mineral consumption but reduced self-application of insecticide. The degree of fly control was not correlated with amount of insecticide used either on a per-cow or per-herd basis. Simmentals consumed nearly twice as much mineral per head as Polled Herefords, but they used only 20 % more insecticide. Including the cost of 1 % Co- Ral dust and equipment costs amortized over 5 years, Dustacators provided acceptable horn fly control and some reduction of face fly numbers for $ 1. 62 per cowlcalf pair, plus labor...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{smart dust}} concept {{has been around}} for almost a decade now, but its {{application}} in transport domain has only been recently investigated. This is a very valuable area of research, as smart dust – being generally perceived as the low-cost, ubiquitous sensor of the future – can {{play an important role in}} Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Our involvement in several transport-related UK and EU funded projects (such as ASTRA [1], EMMA [5], and TRACKSS [7]) gave us the opportunity to carry out feasibility experiments and to develop demonstrations of smart dust applications in transport domain. We have also investigated how smart dust can be used in collaboration with other (more traditional) transport sensors for developing better Co-operative Transport Systems (CTS). This position paper outlines what we have learnt from using smart dust in transport domain, and provides an illustration on the important role that the smart dust technology can play in future ITS. WHAT IS SMART DUST? Smart dust is a network of micro-electro-mechanical devices (also known as motes), which are typically composed of a processing unit, some memory, and a radio chip, which allows them to communicate wirelessly with other smart <b>dust</b> <b>devices</b> within range.

The influence of different <b>dust</b> removal <b>devices</b> on PM 2.5 emission characteristics was also analyzed.

The concentrations and distributions of particulate matter before and after desulfurization devices were also measured in three coal-fired power plants. The results were used to analyze the cleaning effect of wet desulfurization devices on PM 2.5. The findings of this study can provide a reference for the use of wet flue gas desulfurization (WFGD) technology in removing fine particles in flue gas.|$|R

Since the removal efficiency of traditional <b>dust</b> removal <b>devices</b> such as ESP for PM 2. 5 is very low, pretreatment becomes necessary before the dust gets into the dust remover. Acoustic agglomeration {{is one of the}} pretreatment technologies which uses sound wave with high intensity to make fine particles get agglomerate and grow up, and improves the efficiency of traditional <b>dust</b> removal <b>devices</b> for PM 2. 5. In sound wave field, fine particles are carried by the medium which in this paper is air, and vibrate with different amplitude because of different particle sizes, thus relative movement appears and then particles have more chances to collide and get agglomerate. In this paper, the movement of particles with different sizes in travelling wave sound field and standing wave sound field were calculated, including the velocity, displacement, amplitude and so on. The situation that Re< 1 was considered and Viscous force in Stokes region was chose as the main forces here.

40|$|The {{accumulation}} {{of dust and}} soil {{on the surface of}} solar reflectors is an important factor reducing the power output of solar power plants. Therefore the effect of accumulated dust on the specular reflectance of solar mirrors should be understood well in order to improve the site-dependent performance prediction. Furthermore, an optimization of the CSP System maintenance, in particular the cleaning cycles, can be achieved. Our measurements show a noticeable decrease of specular reflectance when the angle of incidence is increased. This effect may be explained by shading and blocking mechanisms caused by dirt particles. The main physical causes of radiation loss being absorption and scattering, the near-angle scattering leads to a further decrease of specular reflectance for smaller angles of acceptance. Within this study mirror samples were both outdoor exposed and indoor artificially soiled. For indoor soiling, the mirror samples were artificially soiled in an in-house developed <b>dusting</b> <b>device</b> using both artificial-standardized dust and real dust collected from an arid outdoor test field at the Negev desert.

40|$|AbstractRespirable {{particulate}} matter, especially {{fine particles}} are doing great harm {{to human health}} and the environment nowadays, but the removal efficiency of traditional <b>dust</b> removal <b>devices</b> for PM 2. 5 is quite low. Acoustic agglomeration is a pretreatment technology of dust removal which uses sound wave with high intensity to make fine particles get agglomerate and grow up, and improves the efficiency of traditional <b>dust</b> removal <b>devices</b> for PM 2. 5 and thus reduces the concentration of fine particle emissions. In this paper, the experimental set-up of acoustic agglomeration is designed and reconstructed. Coal-fired ashes are mixed with air to simulate aerosol emissions from coal-fired power plants. A travelling wave acoustic field is generated in a vertical agglomeration chamber in which the residence time of the aerosol is around 4 s. Preliminary experimental study of the influence of acoustic frequency, SPL and the initial concentration of aerosol on the acoustic agglomeration is conducted. It is found that the efficiency of agglomeration is very sensitive to the change of acoustic frequency and there exists an optimal frequency which in this paper is 1400 Hz. The effect of acoustic agglomeration has a linear relationship with SPL and it is enhanced with the increase of SPL. The increase of the initial number concentration of aerosol can also enhance the agglomeration effect, but the rate of the increase of the agglomeration effect decreases while the initial concentration is getting bigger. When the acoustic frequency is 1400 Hz, the SPL is 142 dB and the initial concentration is 4. 04 × 105 cm- 3, the number concentration of aerosol can be reduced to 35 % of the initial value...|$|R
