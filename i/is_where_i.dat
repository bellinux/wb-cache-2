Of his five siblings, , his older brother Gabriel Zakuani plays for English club Northampton Town {{and is a member}} of the Congolese national team. He might have been able to play for the United States if granted citizenship. He expressed interest in representing the Congolese national team early in his professional career, but considered his chances of playing for England [...] "a long shot".

500|$|The phrase [...] "La Isla Bonita" [...] {{translates}} to [...] "The Beautiful Island" [...] in English. The song has four lines sung in Spanish, a theme which Madonna later incorporated in her 1987 single [...] "Who's That Girl". The lyrics begin by describing Madonna {{as a tourist}} who prays [...] "that the days would last, they went so fast" [...] simultaneously isolating the other Latin people as them ("you can watch them go by"). In her book Women and popular music, author Sheila Whiteley said that the chorus of the song places its emphasis on the incantatory present participle ("Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free, this <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> long to be"). The song draws connotations from the supplicant before its explicit focus on the chorus.|$|E

She {{had been diagnosed with}} the condition in 2006 and that the problem dated to 2000, when she developed an ear infection but continued to perform against the advice of doctors. Despite the setback, Hamasaki stated that she wished to continue singing, and that [...] "as a professional", she wanted to [...] "deliver the best performance for everyone". On May 20, 2017, she wrote that she is also losing hearing in her right ear, and had experienced dizziness and nausea.

He also frequently visits London where he occasionally spends long periods. Vargas Llosa acquired Spanish citizenship in 1993, though he still holds Peruvian nationality. The writer often reiterates his love for both countries. In his Nobel speech he observed: [...] "I carry Peru deep inside me because that <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> was born, grew up, was formed, and lived those experiences of childhood and youth that shaped my personality and forged my calling". He then added: [...] "I love Spain as much as Peru, and my debt to her is as great as my gratitude. If not for Spain, I never would have reached this podium or become a known writer".|$|E
500|$|Wood {{said that}} she is {{sometimes}} puzzled when reading Steffy's scripts, but connects her present storyline to the character's past. She said: [...] "I just think back to all the things Steffy has been through. She {{has a lot of}} deep seeded [...] issues. That <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> think it stems from with her father leaving her, losing her sister, her mom sleeping with her sister’s boyfriend, etc. There are just so many traumatic things! Explaining her reaction to Steffy killing her cousin Aly Forrester (Ashlyn Pearce) in self-defense, Wood stated in August 2015: [...] "When I first heard about it, I was in major shock, of course. Then I started thinking about how everything bad happens to Steffy and that it makes sense that she's a murderer now. It's kind of perfect, really." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Under the Bridge" [...] was {{slightly}} altered because it contained personal lyrics by Anthony Kiedis, and the All Saints covered {{it because they}} liked the overall sound and feeling of the recording. The All Saints version contains samples of the original recording, {{the most important one}} being the distinctive guitar playing in the beginning. The Red Hot Chili Peppers were, however, displeased with this version; Kiedis felt the cover was poorly recreated and, with the omission of the final verse, which contains the line [...] "Under the bridge downtown / <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> drew some blood," [...] it lost all personal significance. He said of All Saints' version: [...] "It was kind of funny, they looked so pretty and clean, it looked like they didn't know what they were singing about." [...] The guitar on [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] was played by Richard Hawley. The original Japanese edition of the album version features a different, more R/pop version of the song.|$|E

Divorced from second husband Tom Hayden, she married billionaire media mogul Ted Turner in 1991 and retired from acting. Fonda was divorced from Turner in 2001. She returned to acting with her first film in 15 years, the 2005 comedy Monster in Law.

500|$|This {{storm of}} {{publicity}} caused {{a flurry of}} activity as readers around France scrambled to obtain the novel. Balzac's friend and La Caricature editor Charles Philipon wrote to the author one week after publication: [...] "there is no getting hold of La Peau de chagrin. Grandville had to stop everything to read it, because the librarian sent round every half-hour {{to ask if he}} had finished." [...] Friends near and far wrote to Balzac indicating their similar difficulties in locating copies. The second edition was released one month later, and it was followed by parodies and derivative works from other writers. Balzac's friend Théophile Gautier included a comical homage in his 1833 story collection Les Jeunes-France when, during a recreation of the feast from Balzac's novel, a character says: [...] "This is the point at which I'm supposed to pour wine down my waistcoat... It says so in black and white on page 171 of La Peau de chagrin... And this <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> have to toss a 100-sou coin in the air {{to see whether or not}} there's a God." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Peggy did return {{briefly in}} 2004 to attend her {{daughter}} Sam's wedding to Andy Hunter (Michael Higgs), {{it was not}} until 2005 that she resumed her role as a series regular. Her full return was announced in January 2005, with John Yorke, the BBC controller of continuing drama series, stating he was [...] "delighted" [...] as [...] " [...] is a hugely loved character and one we think will be stirring things up from the moment she steps back into Walford." [...] Windsor said that she was [...] "over the moon" [...] to return, adding: [...] "I had a great time when I came back to film {{for a couple of weeks}} recently. It really reminded me that the square <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> feel at home." [...] BBC executives hoped that Peggy's return would help to revive EastEnders ratings. Her absence coincided with a two-year ratings slump for EastEnders, with David Liddiment in The Guardian drawing direct correlation between her return and the show's [...] "ratings rejuvenation". The episode in which she returned was watched by 10 million viewers, winning EastEnders a 47% audience share in the timeslot.|$|E
