25|$|The <b>diatreme</b> pipe {{formed by}} {{explosive}} eruption of the lamproite magma through {{a zone of}} weakness in the continental crust.|$|E
25|$|The {{volcanic}} pipe is a <b>diatreme,</b> {{composed of}} olivine lamproite, present as tuff and lava. Peripheral volcanic facies suggest the lamproite eruption formed a maar. At {{the margins of}} the volcanic pipe the lamproite is mixed with a volcanic breccia containing shattered wall rock fragments mixed and milled by the eruption. Minerals in the marginal facies include zeolite minerals, micas, kaolinite and clays, typical of post-eruption hydrothermal circulation.|$|E
25|$|The {{morphology}} of breccias {{associated with}} ore deposits varies from tabular sheeted veins and clastic dikes associated with overpressured sedimentary strata, to large-scale intrusive <b>diatreme</b> breccias (breccia pipes), or even some synsedimentary diatremes formed solely by the overpressure of pore fluid within sedimentary basins. Hydrothermal breccias are usually formed by hydrofracturing of rocks by highly pressured hydrothermal fluids. They {{are typical of}} the epithermal ore environment and are intimately associated with intrusive-related ore deposits such as skarns, greisens and porphyry-related mineralisation. Epithermal deposits are mined for copper, silver and gold.|$|E
50|$|Most {{of these}} rocks occur as dikes, <b>diatremes,</b> lopoliths or laccoliths, and very rarely, intrusions. Most {{kimberlite}} and lamproite occurrences occur as volcanic and subvolcanic <b>diatremes</b> and maars; lavas are virtually unknown.|$|R
50|$|Explosive, hot {{volatile}} rich magma or {{volcanic eruptions}} {{are referred to}} generally as <b>diatremes.</b> <b>Diatremes</b> are not usually associated with diapirs, as they are small-volume magmas which ascend by volatile plumes, not by density contrast with the surrounding mantle.|$|R
50|$|According to radiometric dating the BM <b>diatremes</b> were emplaced about 70 to 78 {{million years}} ago during the Campanian to Maastrichtian stages of the Late Cretaceous epoch. Microfossils from shales {{interbedded}} with kimberlite {{at some of the}} <b>diatremes</b> are consistent with a Late Cretaceous age (Late Albian to Maastrichtian).|$|R
25|$|Shiprock is {{composed}} of fractured volcanic breccia and black dikes of igneous rock called minette, or lamprophyre. It is the erosional remnant of the throat of a volcano, and the volcanic breccia formed in a <b>diatreme.</b> The rock probably was originally formed 2,500–3,000 feet (750–1,000 meters) below the Earth's surface, but it was exposed after {{millions of years of}} erosion. Wall-like sheets of minette, known as dikes, radiate away from the central formation. Radiometric age determinations of the minette establish that these volcanic rocks solidified about 27 million years ago. Shiprock is in the northeastern part of the Navajo Volcanic Field—a field that includes intrusions and flows of minette and other unusual igneous rocks that formed about 30 million years ago. Agathla (El Capitan) in Monument Valley is another prominent volcanic neck in this volcanic field.|$|E
2500|$|A unique {{feature in}} the {{watershed}} is Rutan Hill, also called Volcanic Hill, {{thought to be the}} throat of an ancient, extinct volcano which was active {{at the end of the}} Taconic Orogeny approximately 420 million years ago. This nondescript hill in the Beemerville section of Wantage Township, is the surface expression of a [...] lamprophyric <b>diatreme</b> that is the northern part of the Late Ordovician Beemerville Alkaline Complex that also includes two large nepheline syenite plutons; and several other nearby and much smaller dikes, sills, and diatremes.|$|E
2500|$|The {{kimberlite}} diatremes, or pipes, across Canada {{have also}} been important economically, because kimberlite magmas are the world's main source of gem-quality diamonds. Kimberlite pipes form when kimberlite magmas rise considerably from depths as great as [...] As the kimberlite magmas approach a depth of at least , the magma explodes violently through the Earth's crust, carrying fragments of rock that it has collected along the way and, in the right conditions, possibly diamonds, to the surface. The Eocene (ca. 55-50 Ma) age diatremes of the Lac de Gras kimberlite field in the central Slave craton of the Northwest Territories support two world-class diamond mines, called Ekati and Diavik. Ekati, Canada's first diamond mine, has produced [...] of diamonds out of six open pits between 1998 and 2008, while Diavik, to the southeast, has produced [...] of diamonds since its foundation in 2003. The diamondiferous Drybones Bay kimberlite pipe is the largest <b>diatreme</b> discovered in the Northwest Territories, measuring [...] Diamondiferous diatremes throughout the Northwest Territories and Alberta {{have the potential to}} make Canada one of the world's major producers of gem-quality diamonds.|$|E

40|$|Over 200 <b>diatremes</b> {{occur in}} the Hopi Buttes {{volcanic}} province on the southwestern flank of the Black Mesa basin in northeastern Arizona. The <b>diatremes</b> are funnel-shaped vents with maar craters at the surface. They were formed by phreatomagmatic eruptions along existing northwest-southeast fractures during mid-Pliocene time. Anomalous concentrations of uranium occur in at least 20 of the <b>diatremes.</b> The <b>diatremes</b> and dikes which feed them are composed of lamprophyres, monchiquite, and limburgite. Tuff breccias and agglomerates rimming the vents consist of sedimentary and igneous fragments in a limburgite matrix. The maars contain waterlaid deposits of interlayered tuff, claystone, and marl. The lamprophyres are enriched in light rare earth elements {{and may have been}} derived from a slight partial melting of the upper mantle. Average uranium values are: tuff breccias, 10. 54 ppm; tuffs, 213. 95 ppm; limestones, 58. 213 ppm. The average Th/U ratio in the lampro-phyres is 2. 02. The lack of correlation between U and Hf or Th indicates that uranium traveled in mobile phases and was segregated from many elements in the lamprophyres. Localization of uranium in maar-type <b>diatremes</b> may have occurred as fluids percolated up through frac-tures in the vents and mixed with ground and surface waters...|$|R
