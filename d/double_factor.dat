Nevertheless, he assumed strictly positive observations. Generalization to tables with zero entries is still considered a hard and only partly solved problem.|$|E

40|$|Mechanical {{excavation}} by {{the point}} attack {{bit of the}} long-wall shearers is of key importance in modern mining sites. However, serious wear, heavy airborne dust and excessive power consumption are three major problems in rock cutting using current conical bits. Regarding the above defects and enlightened by the Vicker's indentation tests on brittle materials, a pyramidal bit was put forward in order to replace the cone. Then, two stages of practical work, edge chipping and linear cutting, were set up to investigate the availability and further improvement of the pyramidal bit. An edge chipping test {{can be used to}} simulate the rock cutting process due to the similarity of crack systems. Such experiments were then carried out to comparatively explore the cutting performances based on different crack mechanism, fine grain generations, chip sizes, cutting forces and total energy consumption. Results demonstrated that the pyramidal bit generates less radiated cracks, larger size chips and less energy consumption. Moreover, it was also found that the 2 D crack trajectory of the chip from the side view is close to a straight line. The straight trajectory is angled with the force axis and this angle was found to be linearly correlated with the attack angle. In addition, the chipping force curves were found to be well quadratically fitted. The minimum peak force induced by the pyramidal bit was noted to exist at the orientation of diagonals with and to the free surface. Besides, the best-fit power relationship between the peak force and depth of cut was close to 1. 3 and the power values of the total chipping energy and depth of cut were found to be in a range from 1. 85 to 2. 29. Then, a model describing edge chipping in relation to the peak chipping force, material properties, attack angle and depth of cut was derived in line with the assumptions from the observations in the edge chipping tests. It was discussed that the trajectory of maximum shear stress can be the most likely explanation of the straight crack path observed in chipping experiments. The derivation of toughness based on this derivation provides a convenient way of predicting the rock toughness. Specifically, the power relationship between peak chipping force, total energy and depth of cut are theoretically explained. Linear cutting tests were carried out on Helidon sandstone and Harcourt granite for comparing the cutting and wear performances of all bit configurations. The initial pyramidal bit profile was improved by modifying the top and bottom cutting angles, side surface and setting the optimum cutting orientation, in terms of the result analyses in the cutting tests. Then, cutting performances were investigated and compared in relation to fracture mechanism, crush zone size, fragment size distribution, excavated rock mass, cutting force and specific energy. Results show the higher cutting efficiency of the improved bit configuration is dependent on the larger fraction of big fragments, much lower mean cutting force and specific energy. Fractal analysis quantitatively validates the cutting efficiency by dealing with the larger fracture surface area and 3 D multivariate analyses provide a comprehensive view of the <b>double</b> <b>factor</b> effect. A power relationship was also found between the mean cutting force and depth of cut although the force amplitude is different from that in edge chipping, which further derived the power relationship between specific energy and depth of cut. Besides, PCD bits possessed much higher wear resistance than that of WC bits, which further demonstrates the availability of the potential application of pure PCD material in hard rock cutting...|$|E
40|$|Four {{different}} approaches for {{the calculation of}} the well established decoupling coefficient Ω are compared using measurements at three experimental sites (Tharandt – spruce forest, Grillenburg and Melpitz – grass) and simulations from the soil-vegetation boundary layer model HIRVAC. These investigations aimed to quantify differences between the calculation routines regarding their ability to describe the vegetation-atmosphere coupling of grass and forest with and without water stress. The model HIRVAC used is a vertically highly resolved atmospheric boundary layer model, which includes vegetation. It is coupled with a single-leaf gas exchange model to simulate physiologically based reactions of different vegetation types to changing atmospheric conditions. A multilayer soil water module and a functional parameterisation are the base in order to link the stomata reaction of the gas exchange model to the change of soil water. The omega factor was calculated for the basic formulation according to McNaughton and Jarvis (1983) and three modifications. To compare measurements and simulations for the above mentioned spruce and grass sites, the summer period 2007 {{as well as a}} dry period in June 2000 were used. Additionally a developing water stress situation for three forest canopies (spruce, pine and beech) and for a grass site was simulated. The results showed large differences between the different omega approaches which depend on the vegetation type and the soil moisture. Between the omega values, which were calculated by the used approach, the ranking was always the same not only for the measurements but also for the adapted simulations. The lowest values came from the first modification including <b>doubling</b> <b>factors</b> and summands in all parts of omega equation in relation to the original approach. And the highest values were calculated with the second modification missing one <b>doubling</b> <b>factor</b> in the denominator of the omega equation. For example, the averages of omega ranged in the summer period 2007 from 0. 11 to 0. 19 for the spruce site and moderate soil wetness and from 0. 42 to 0. 58 for the grass site and higher soil wetness. In the case of the simulated drying out of four different canopies the forest stands showed a similar change of omega from about 0. 65 (moderate soil wetness) to 0. 1 (low soil wetness). The absolute change of omega for the grass canopy was smaller than for the forest canopies (on average from 0. 95 to 0. 7). But the differences between the used omega approaches increased. Especially the results from the longer period in summer 2007 demonstrate that the various modifications of the decoupling coefficient lead to a change in the long-term quantity of omega. This has, for example, consequences for the description of the coupling of heterogeneous landscapes...|$|R
