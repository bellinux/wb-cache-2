40|$|Memory {{is created}} by several {{interlinked}} processes in the brain, some of which require long-term gene regulation. Epigenetic mechanisms are likely candidates for regulating memory-related genes. Among these, DNA methylation {{is known to be}} a long lasting <b>genomic</b> <b>mark</b> and may be involved in the establishment of long-term memory. Here we demonstrate that DNA methyltransferases, which induce and maintain DNA methylation, are involved in a particular aspect of associative long-term memory formation in honeybees, but are not required for short-term memory formation. While long-term memory strength itself was not affected by blocking DNA methyltransferases, odor specificity of the memory (memory discriminatory power) was. Conversely, perceptual discriminatory power was normal. These results suggest that different genetic pathways are involved in mediating the strength and discriminatory power of associative odor memories and provide, to our knowledge, the first indication that DNA methyltransferases are involved in stimulus-specific associative long-term memory formation...|$|E
40|$|Using an enhancer-associated {{epigenetic}} signature, we made genome-wide {{predictions of}} transcriptional enhancers in human B and T lymphocytes and {{embryonic stem cells}} (ES cells). We validated and characterized the predicted enhancers using four types of information, including overlap with other <b>genomic</b> <b>marks</b> for enhancers; association with cell-type-specific genes; enrichment of cell-type-specific transcription factor binding sites; and genetic polymorphisms in predicted enhancers. We find that enhancers from ES cells, but not B or T cells, are significantly enriched for DNA sequences derived from transposable elements. This {{may be due to}} the generally relaxed repressive epigenetic state and increased activity of transposable elements in ES cells. We demonstrate that the wealth of new enhancer sequences discerned here provides an invaluable resource for the functional annotation of gene-distal single nucleotide polymorphisms identified through expression quantitative trait loci and genome-wide association studies analyses. Notably, we find GWAS SNPs associated with various cancers are enriched in ES cell enhancers. In comparison, GWAS SNPs associated with diseases due to immune dysregulation are enriched in B and T cell enhancers...|$|R

Here we describe an approach, which we call “chromatin proteomic profiling,” to identify proteins associated with <b>genomic</b> regions <b>marked</b> by specifically modified histones. We used ChIP-MS to identify proteins associated with <b>genomic</b> regions <b>marked</b> by histones modified at specific lysine residues, including H 3 K 27 ac, H 3 K 4 me 3, H 3 K 79 me 2, H 3 K 36 me 3, H 3 K 9 me 3, and H 4 K 20 me 3, in ES cells. We identified 332 known and 114 novel proteins associated with these histone-marked genomic segments. Many of the novel candidates have been implicated in various diseases, and their chromatin association may provide clues to disease mechanisms. More than 100 histone modifications have been described, so similar chromatin proteomic profiling studies should prove to be valuable for identifying many additional chromatin-associated proteins in a broad spectrum of cell types.

40|$|A {{central issue}} in {{evolutionary}} biology {{is the extent}} to which complex social organization is under genetic control. We have found that a single <b>genomic</b> element <b>marked</b> by the protein-encoding gene Gp- 9 is responsible for the existence of two distinct forms of social organization in the fire ant Solenopsis invicta. This genetic factor influences the reproductive phenotypes and behavioral strategies of queens and determines whether workers tolerate a single fertile queen or multiple queens per colony. Furthermore, this factor affects worker tolerance of queens with alternate genotypes, thus explaining the dramatic differences in Gp- 9 allele frequencies observed between the two social forms in the wild.

40|$|DNA {{methylation}} {{is essential}} for embryonic and neuronal differentiation, but the function of most <b>genomic</b> DNA methylation <b>marks</b> is poorly understood. Generally the human genome is highly methylated (> 70 %) except for CpG islands and gene promoters. However, it was recently shown that the IMR 90 human fetal lung fibroblast cells have large regions of the genome with partially methylated domains (PMDs, 70 % average methylation). Using bisulfite conversion followed by high-throughput sequencing (MethylC-seq), we discovered that human SH-SY 5 Y neuronal cells also contain PMDs. We developed a novel hidden Markov model (HMM) to computationally map the genomic locations of PMDs in both cell types and found that autosomal PMDs can be > 9 Mb in length and cover 41 % of the IMR 90 genome and 19 % of the SH-SY 5 Y genome. <b>Genomic</b> regions <b>marked</b> by cell line specific PMDs contain genes that are expressed in a tissue-specific manner, with PMDs being a mark of repressed transcription. Genes contained within N-HMDs (neuronal HMDs, defined as a PMD in IMR 90 but HMD in SH-SY 5 Y) were significantly enriched for calcium signaling, synaptic transmission, and neuron differentiation functions. Autism candidate genes were enriched within PMDs and the largest PMD observed in SH-SY 5 Y cells marked a 10 Mb cluster of cadherin genes with strong genetic association to autism. Our results suggest that these large-scale methylation domain maps could be relevant to interpreting and directing future investigations into the elusive etiology of autism...|$|R

GNAS is an imprinted locus that produces one biallelic (Gsα) and four monoallelic (NESP 55, GNAS-AS 1, XLsα, and A/B) transcripts due to differential methylation of their promoters (DMR). To document imprinting at the GNAS locus in PSCs, we studied GNAS locus DMR methylation and transcript (NESP 55, XLsα, and A/B) expression in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and human {{induced pluripotent stem cells}} (hiPSCs) derived from two human fibroblasts and their progenies. Results showed that (1) methylation at the GNAS locus DMRs is DMR and cell line specific, (2) changes in allelic transcript expression can be independent of a change in allele-specific DNA methylation, and (3) interestingly, methylation at A/B DMR is correlated with A/B transcript expression.

Lactobacillus plantarum is a lactic acid bacterium that is found in a large variety of habitat.

40|$|Abstract Background	Intronic and intergenic long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are {{emerging}} gene expression regulators. The molecular pathogenesis of {{renal cell carcinoma}} (RCC) is still poorly understood, and in particular, limited studies are available for intronic lncRNAs expressed in RCC Methods Microarray experiments were performed with custom-designed arrays enriched with probes for lncRNAs mapping to intronic genomic regions. Samples from 18 primary RCC tumors and 11 nontumor adjacent matched tissues were analyzed. Meta-analyses were performed with microarray expression data from three additional human tissues (normal liver, prostate tumor and kidney nontumor samples), and with large-scale public data for epigenetic regulatory marks and for evolutionarily conserved sequences. Results A signature of 29 intronic lncRNAs differentially expressed between RCC and nontumor samples was obtained (false discovery rate (FDR) < 5 %). A signature of 26 intronic lncRNAs significantly correlated with the RCC five-year patient survival outcome was identified (FDR < 5 %, p-value ≤ 0. 01). We identified 4303 intronic antisense lncRNAs expressed in RCC, of which 22 % were significantly (p < 0. 05) cis correlated with {{the expression of the}} mRNA in the same locus across RCC and three other human tissues. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of those loci pointed to 'regulation of biological processes’ as the main enriched category. A module map analysis of the protein-coding genes significantly (p < 0. 05) trans correlated with the 20 % most abundant lncRNAs, identified 51 enriched GO terms (p < 0. 05). We determined that 60 % of the expressed lncRNAs are evolutionarily conserved. At the genomic loci containing the intronic RCC-expressed lncRNAs, a strong association (p < 0. 001) was found between their transcription start sites and <b>genomic</b> <b>marks</b> such as CpG islands, RNA Pol II binding and histones methylation and acetylation. 	Conclusion	Intronic antisense lncRNAs are widely expressed in RCC tumors. Some of them are significantly altered in RCC in comparison with nontumor samples. The majority of these lncRNAs is evolutionarily conserved and possibly modulated by epigenetic modifications. Our data suggest that these RCC lncRNAs may contribute to the complex network of regulatory RNAs playing a role in renal cell malignant transformation.

40|$|Abstract Background Gene-centric {{analysis}} tools for genome-wide association study data {{are being developed}} both to annotate single locus statistics and to prioritize or group single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) prior to analysis. These approaches require knowledge about the relationships between SNPs on a genotyping platform and genes in the human genome. SNPs in the genome can represent broader genomic regions via linkage disequilibrium (LD), and population-specific patterns of LD can be exploited to generate a data-driven map of SNPs to genes. Methods In this study, we implemented LD-Spline, a database routine that defines the genomic boundaries a particular SNP represents using linkage disequilibrium statistics from the International HapMap Project. We compared the LD-Spline haplotype block partitioning approach {{to that of the}} four gamete rule and the Gabriel et al. approach using simulated data; in addition, we processed two commonly used genome-wide association study platforms. Results We illustrate that LD-Spline performs comparably to the four-gamete rule and the Gabriel et al. approach; however as a SNP-centric approach LD-Spline has the added benefit of systematically identifying a genomic boundary for each SNP, where the global block partitioning approaches may falter due to sampling variation in LD statistics. Conclusion LD-Spline is an integrated database routine that quickly and effectively defines the <b>genomic</b> region <b>marked</b> by a SNP using linkage disequilibrium, with a SNP-centric block definition algorithm. </p...|$|R

It is well established that LTP persistence {{is strongly dependent on}} activation of constitutive and inducible transcription factors, but there is limited information regarding the downstream gene networks and controlling elements that coalesce to stabilise LTP. To identify these gene networks, we used Affymetrix RAT 230. 2 microarrays to detect genes regulated 5 h and 24 h (n = 5) after LTP induction at perforant path synapses in the dentate gyrus of awake adult rats. The functional relationships of the differentially expressed genes were examined using DAVID and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, and compared with our previous data derived 20 min post-LTP induction in vivo. This analysis showed that LTP-related genes are predominantly upregulated at 5 h but that there is pronounced downregulation of gene expression at 24 h after LTP induction. Analysis {{of the structure of the}} networks and canonical pathways predicted a regulation of calcium dynamics via G-protein coupled receptors, dendritogenesis and neurogenesis at the 5 h time-point. By 24 h neurotrophin-NFKB driven pathways of neuronal growth were identified.

40|$|Computational {{methods to}} {{identify}} functional genomic elements using genetic information {{have been very}} successful in determining gene structure and in identifying a handful of cis-regulatory elements. But {{the vast majority of}} regulatory elements have yet to be discovered, and it has become increasingly apparent that their discovery will not come from using genetic information alone. Recently, high-throughput technologies have enabled the creation of information-rich epigenetic maps, most notably for histone modifications. However, tools that search for functional elements using this epigenetic information have been lacking. Here, we describe an unsupervised learning method called ChromaSig to find, in an unbiased fashion, commonly occurring chromatin signatures in both tiling microarray and sequencing data. Applying this algorithm to nine chromatin marks across a 1 % sampling of the human genome in HeLa cells, we recover eight clusters of distinct chromatin signatures, five of which correspond to known patterns associated with transcriptional promoters and enhancers. Interestingly, we observe that the distinct chromatin signatures found at enhancers mark distinct functional classes of enhancers in terms of transcription factor and coactivator binding. In addition, we identify three clusters of novel chromatin signatures that contain evolutionarily conserved sequences and potential cis-regulatory elements.

40|$|Cancer is an aging-associated disease but the {{underlying}} molecular links between these processes are still largely unknown. Gene promoters that become hypermethylated in aging and cancer {{share a common}} chromatin signature in ES cells. In addition, there is also global DNA hypomethylation in both processes. However, any similarities of the regions where this loss of DNA methylation occurs is currently not well characterized, nor is it known whether such regions also share a common chromatin signature in aging and cancer. To address this issue we analysed TCGA DNA methylation data from a total of 2, 311 samples, including control and cancer cases from patients with breast, kidney, thyroid, skin, brain and lung tumors and healthy blood, and integrated the results with histone, chromatin state and transcription factor binding site data from the NIH Roadmap Epigenomics and ENCODE projects.

40|$|In this dissertation, a novel adaptor-mediated PCR-based method, Digestion-ligation-amplification (DLA), was {{developed}} to overcome difficulties of amplifying unknown sequences flanking known DNA sequences in large genomes. Two DLA-based strategies were developed to isolate Mu-tagged alleles. The utility of each approach was validated by independently cloning the gl 4 (glossy 4) gene. Mutants of gl 4 lack the normal accumulation of epicuticular waxes. The gl 4 gene is a homolog of the Arabidopsis CUT 1 gene, which encodes a condensing enzyme involved in the synthesis of very-long-chain fatty acids, which are precursors of epicuticular waxes. Using this novel genome walking strategy, 3 ̆e 40, 000 non-redundant Mu insertion sites were amplified from Mu stocks and sequenced via 454 technology. The chromosomal and genic patterns of Mu insertions were revealed by analyzing the distributions of these Mu insertions.

A <b>genomic</b> element <b>marked</b> by the gene Gp- 9 determines whether workers tolerate one or many fertile queens in their colony. Gp- 9 was recently shown {{to be part of}} a supergene with two nonrecombining variants, SB and Sb. SB/SB and SB/Sb queens differ in how they initiate new colonies, and in many physiological traits, for example odour and maturation rate. To understand how a single genetic element can affect all these traits, we used a microarray to compare gene expression patterns between SB/SB and SB/Sb queens of three different age classes: 1 -day-old unmated queens, 11 -day-old unmated queens and mated, fully reproductive queens collected from mature field colonies. The number of genes that were differentially expressed between SB/SB and SB/Sb queens of the same age class was smallest in 1 -day-old queens, maximal in 11 -day-old queens and intermediate in reproductive queens. Gene ontology analysis showed that SB/SB queens upregulate reproductive genes faster than SB/Sb queens. For all age classes, genes inside the supergene were overrepresented among the differentially expressed genes. Consistent with the hypothesized greater number of transposons in the Sb supergene, 13 transposon genes were upregulated in SB/Sb queens. Viral genes were also upregulated in SB/Sb mature queens, consistent with the known greater parasite load in colonies headed by SB/Sb queens compared with colonies headed by SB/SB queens. Eighteen differentially expressed genes between reproductive queens were involved in chemical signalling. Our results suggest that many genes in the supergene are involved in regulating social organization and queen phenotypes in fire ants...|$|R
40|$|Intraspecific {{variability}} in social organization is common, yet {{the underlying causes}} are rarely known. In the fire ant Solenopsis invicta, the existence of two divergent forms of social organization is {{under the control of}} a single Mendelian <b>genomic</b> element <b>marked</b> by two variants of an odorant-binding protein gene. Here we characterize the genomic region responsible for this important social polymorphism, and show that {{it is part of a}} pair of heteromorphic chromosomes that have many of the key properties of sex chromosomes. The two variants, hereafter referred to as the social B and social b (SB and Sb) chromosomes, are characterized by a large region of approximately 13 [*]megabases (55 % of the chromosome) in which recombination is completely suppressed between SB and Sb. Recombination seems to occur normally between the SB chromosomes but not between Sb chromosomes because Sb/Sb individuals are non-viable. Genomic comparisons revealed limited differentiation between SB and Sb, and the vast majority of the 616 genes identified in the non-recombining region are present in the two variants. The lack of recombination over more than half of the two heteromorphic social chromosomes can be explained by at least one large inversion of around 9 megabases, and this absence of recombination has led to the accumulation of deleterious mutations, including repetitive elements in the non-recombining region of Sb compared with the homologous region of SB. Importantly, most of the genes with demonstrated expression differences between individuals of the two social forms reside in the non-recombining region. These findings highlight how genomic rearrangements can maintain divergent adaptive social phenotypes involving many genes acting together by locally limiting recombination...|$|R

Aberrant changes of histone modification levels are frequently observed in cancer. We have employed ChIP-Seq to identify regulatory elements in human breast cancer cell line, MCF- 7 by comparing histone modification patterns of H 3 K 4 me 1, H 3 K 4 me 3, and H 3 K 9 / 14 ac to those in normal mammary epithelial cell line, MCF- 10 A. The genome-wide analysis shows that H 3 K 4 me 3 and H 3 K 9 / 14 ac are highly enriched at promoter regions and H 3 K 4 me 1 has a relatively broad distribution over proximity of TSSs as well as other genomic regions. We identified that many differentially expressed genes in MCF- 7 have divergent histone modification patterns. To understand the functional roles of distinctively histone-modified regions, we selected 35 <b>genomic</b> regions <b>marked</b> by at least one histone modification and located from 3 to 10 kb upstream of TSS in both MCF- 7 and MCF- 10 A and assessed their transcriptional activities. About 66 % and 60 % of selected regions in MCF- 7 and MCF- 10 A, respectively, enhanced the transcriptional activity. Interestingly, most regions marked by H 3 K 4 me 1 exhibited an enhancer activity. Regions with two or more kinds of histone modifications did show varying activities. In conclusion, our data reflects that comprehensive analysis of histone modification profiles under cell type-specific chromatin environment should provide a better chance for defining functional regulatory elements in the genome...|$|R

Because the demographic parameters (population sizes and igration rates) are common across all autosomal loci, locus-specific estimates of FST will depart from a common distribution only for loci with unusually high or low rates of mutation or for loci that are closely associated with genomic regions having a relationship with fitness. Thus, loci that are statistical outliers showing significantly more among-population differentiation than others may <b>mark</b> <b>genomic</b> regions subject to diversifying selection among the sample populations. Similarly, statistical outliers showing significantly less differentiation among populations than others may <b>mark</b> <b>genomic</b> regions subject to stabilizing selection across the sample populations. We propose several Bayesian hierarchical models to estimate locus-specific effects on FST, and we apply these models to single nucleotide polymorphism data from the HapMap project. Because loci that are physically associated with one another are likely to show similar patterns of variation, we introduce conditional autoregressive models to incorporate the local correlation among loci for high-resolution genomic data. We estimate the posterior distributions of model parameters using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. Model comparison using several criteria, including DIC and LPML, reveals that a model with locus- and population-specific effects is superior to other models for the data used in the analysis. To detect statistical outliers we propose an approach that measures divergence between the posterior distributions of locus-specific effects and the common FST with the Kullback-Leibler divergence measure. We calibrate this measure by comparing values with those produced from the divergence between a biased and a fair 3 coin. We conduct a simulation study to illustrate the performance of our approach for detecting loci subject to stabilizing/divergent selection, and we apply the proposed models to low- and high-resolution SNP data from the HapMap project. Model comparison using DIC and LPML reveals that CAR models are superior to alternative models for the high resolution data. For both low and high resolution data, we identify statistical outliers that are associated with known genes...|$|R

In the present study, we showed in experiments with gnotobiotic mice that the evolution of Lactobacillus reuteri with rodents resulted {{in the emergence of}} host specialization. To identify <b>genomic</b> events <b>marking</b> adaptations to the murine host, we compared the genome of the rodent isolate L. reuteri 100 - 23 with that of the human isolate L. reuteri F 275, and we identified hundreds of genes that were specific to each strain. In order to differentiate true host-specific genome content from strain-level differences, comparative genome hybridizations were performed to query 57 L. reuteri strains originating from six different vertebrate hosts in combination with genome sequence comparisons of nine strains encompassing five phylogenetic lineages of the species. This approach revealed that rodent strains, although showing a high degree of genomic plasticity, possessed a specific genome inventory that was rare or absent in strains from other vertebrate hosts. The distinct genome content of L. reuteri lineages reflected the niche characteristics in the gastrointestinal tracts of their respective hosts, and inactivation of seven out of eight representative rodent-specific genes in L. reuteri 100 - 23 resulted in impaired ecological performance in the gut of mice. The comparative genomic analyses suggested fundamentally different trends of genome evolution in rodent and human L. reuteri populations, with the former possessing a large and adaptable pan-genome while the latter being subjected to a process of reductive evolution. In conclusion, this study provided experimental evidence and a molecular basis for the evolution of host specificity in a vertebrate gut symbiont, and it identified genomic events that have shaped this process...|$|R
40|$|The Mu {{transposon}} {{system of}} maize is highly active, {{with each of}} the ∼ 50 – 100 copies transposing on average once each generation. The approximately one dozen distinct Mu transposons contain highly similar ∼ 215 bp terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) and generate 9 -bp target site duplications (TSDs) upon insertion. Using a novel genome walking strategy that uses these conserved TIRs as primer binding sites, Mu insertion sites were amplified from Mu stocks and sequenced via 454 technology. 94 % of ∼ 965, 000 reads carried Mu TIRs, demonstrating the specificity of this strategy. Among these TIRs, 21 novel Mu TIRs were discovered, revealing additional complexity of the Mu transposon system. The distribution of > 40, 000 non-redundant Mu insertion sites was strikingly non-uniform, such that rates increased in proportion to distance from the centromere. An identified putative Mu transposase binding consensus site does not explain this non-uniformity. An integrated genetic map containing more than 10, 000 genetic markers was constructed and aligned to the sequence of the maize reference genome. Recombination rates (cM/Mb) are also strikingly non-uniform, with rates increasing in proportion to distance from the centromere. Mu insertion site frequencies are strongly correlated with recombination rates. Gene density does not fully explain the chromosomal distribution of Mu insertion and recombination sites, because pronounced preferences for the distal portion of chromosome are still observed even after accounting for gene density. The similarity of the distributions of Mu insertions and meiotic recombination sites suggests that common features, such as chromatin structure, are involved in site selection for both Mu insertion and meiotic recombination. The finding that Mu insertions and meiotic recombination sites both concentrate in <b>genomic</b> regions <b>marked</b> with epigenetic marks of open chromatin provides support for the hypothesis that open chromatin enhances rates of both Mu insertion and meiotic recombination...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{complexes}} {{formed by}} the hematopoietic transcription factor Gata 1 is a complex with the Ldb 1 (LIM domain-binding protein 1) and Tal 1 proteins. It {{is known to be}} important for the development and differentiation of the erythroid cell lineage and is thought to be implicated in long-range interactions. Here, the dynamics of the composition of the complex - in particular, the binding of the negative regulators Eto 2 and Mtgr 1 - are studied, {{in the context of their}} genome-wide targets. This shows that the complex acts almost exclusively as an activator, binding a very specific combination of sequences, with a positioning relative to transcription start site, depending on the type of the core promoter. The activation is accompanied by a net decrease in the relative binding of Eto 2 and Mtgr 1. A Chromosome Conformation Capture sequencing (3 C-seq) assay also shows that the binding of the Ldb 1 complex <b>marks</b> <b>genomic</b> interaction sites in vivo. This establishes the Ldb 1 complex as a positive regulator of the final steps of erythroid differentiation that acts through the shedding of negative regulators and the active interaction between regulatory sequences...|$|R
40|$|A {{candidate}} gene approach {{was taken to}} characterize Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) crystalline (Cry) toxin resistance phenotypes of the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Hubner), and anonymous genomic markers were used to estimate subpopulation differentiation and migration rates that may affect spread of resistance phenotypes in the North American population. Native and transgenic variants of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) crystalline (Cry) toxins control larval lepidopteran feeding upon important agronomic crop plants. Invertebrate Bt resistance phenotypes arise via altered expression of midgut proteases involved in Cry toxin activation (trypsins) and degradation (chymotrypsins), reduced toxin binding to N-acetylgalactoseamine (GalNAc) modified peptide receptors (cadherin, aminopeptidase, or alkaline phosphatase), or receptor glycosylation pathway knockouts (beta- 1, 3 -galactosyltransferases; beta 3 GalT 5). Ostrinia nubilalis trypsin, chymotrypsin, cadherin, and beta 3 GalT 5 cDNA clones, transcript expression, and partial genomic genomic DNA copies were characterized. Mendelian inheritance of trypsin, chymotrypsin, and cadherin genomic DNA markers suggest association between allele segregation and Bt resistance phenotypes can be conducted. Movement of O. nubilalis moths was indirectly estimated by genetic similarity between North American subpopulations using mitochondrial and <b>genomic</b> microsatellite markers. <b>Marker</b> data suggested differentiation between two O. nubilalis ecotypes, univoltine and bivoltine, which may affect movement of Bt resistance phenotypes in northern regions of the Midwest United States...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{classical}} Mendelian inheritance, {{each parent}} donates {{a set of}} chromosomes to its offspring so that maternally and paternally encoded information is expressed equally. The phenomena of X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) and autosomal imprinting in mammals violate this dogma of genetic equality. In XCI, {{one of the two}} female X chromosomes is silenced to equalize X-linked gene dosage between XX and XY individuals. In <b>genomic</b> imprinting, parental <b>marks</b> determine which of the embryo's two autosomal alleles will be expressed. Although XCI and imprinting appear distinct, molecular evidence now shows that they share a surprising number of features. Among them are cis-acting control centers, long-distance regulation and differential DNA methylation. Perhaps one of the most intriguing similarities between XCI and imprinting has been their association with noncoding and antisense RNAs. Very recent data also suggest the common involvement of histone modifications and chromatin-associated factors such as CTCF. Collectively, the evidence suggests that XCI and genomic imprinting may have a common origin. Here, I hypothesize that the need for X-linked dosage compensation was a major driving force in the evolution of genomic imprinting in mammals. I propose that imprinting was first fixed on the X chromosome for XCI and subsequently acquired by autosomes...|$|R
40|$|GADD 45 is an {{evolutionarily}} conserved {{gene that}} encodes a small acidic, nuclear protein {{and is an}} example of a p 53 responsive gene. Gadd 45 protein has been shown to interact with PCNA and also p 21 waf 1. It has been implicated in growth arrest, DNA repair, chromatin structure and signal transduction. The confusing biochemical data has been clarified by the demonstration that Gadd 45 null mice have a phenotype strikingly similar to that of p 53 null mice, being tumour prone and showing <b>marked</b> <b>genomic</b> instability. We have tested the hypothesis that mutations in the GADD 45 coding region might substitute for p 53 abnormalities in tumour cell lines where p 53 is wild type. After generating cDNA from mRNA in a panel of 24 cell lines we sequenced the GADD 45 cDNA and have demonstrated that no mutations can be observed, even in the p 53 wild type cell lines. Such data suggest that Gadd 45 mutations are uncommon in human cancer. From this we postulate that, despite the phenotype of the GADD 45 null mouse, GADD 45 is unlikely to be the key mechanistic determinant of the tumour suppressor activity of the p 53 pathway...|$|R

40|$|We have {{developed}} a strategy to introduce in vitro-methylated DNA into defined chromosomal locations. Using this system, we {{examined the effects of}} methylation on transcription, chromatin structure, histone acetylation, and replication timing by targeting methylated and unmethylated constructs to <b>marked</b> <b>genomic</b> sites. At two sites, which support stable expression from an unmethylated enhancer-reporter construct, introduction of an in vitro-methylated but otherwise identical construct results in specific changes in transgene conformation and activity, including loss of the promoter DNase I-hypersensitive site, localized hypoacetylation of histones H 3 and H 4 within the reporter gene, and a block to transcriptional initiation. Insertion of methylated constructs does not alter the early replication timing of the loci and does not result in de novo methylation of flanking genomic sequences. Methylation at the promoter and gene is stable over time, as is the repression of transcription. Surprisingly, sequences within the enhancer are demethylated, the hypersensitive site forms, and the enhancer is hyperacetylated. Nevertheless, the enhancer is unable to activate the methylated and hypoacetylated reporter. Our findings suggest that CpG methylation represses transcription by interfering with RNA polymerase initiation via a mechanism that involves localized histone deacetylation. This repression is dominant over a remodeled enhancer but neither results in nor requires region-wide changes in DNA replication or chromatin structure...|$|R
