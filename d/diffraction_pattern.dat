5|$|Pale Blue Dot, {{which was}} {{taken with the}} narrow-angle camera, was also {{published}} {{as part of a}} composite picture created from a wide-angle camera photograph showing the Sun and the region of space containing the Earth and Venus. The wide-angle image was inset with two narrow-angle pictures: Pale Blue Dot and a similar photograph of Venus. The wide-angle photograph was taken with the darkest filter (a methane absorption band) and the shortest possible exposure (5 milliseconds), to avoid saturating the camera's vidicon tube with scattered sunlight. Even so, the result was a bright burned-out image with multiple reflections from the optics in the camera and the Sun that appears far larger than the actual dimension of the solar disk. The rays around the Sun are a <b>diffraction</b> <b>pattern</b> of the calibration lamp which is mounted in front of the wide-angle lens.|$|E
5|$|The {{oldest and}} most precise method of X-ray {{crystallography}} is single-crystal X-ray diffraction, in which a beam of X-rays strikes a single crystal, producing scattered beams. When they land {{on a piece of}} film or other detector, these beams make a <b>diffraction</b> <b>pattern</b> of spots; the strengths and angles of these beams are recorded as the crystal is gradually rotated. Each spot is called a reflection, since it corresponds to the reflection of the X-rays from one set of evenly spaced planes within the crystal. For single crystals of sufficient purity and regularity, X-ray diffraction data can determine the mean chemical bond lengths and angles to within a few thousandths of an angstrom and to within a few tenths of a degree, respectively. The atoms in a crystal are not static, but oscillate about their mean positions, usually by less than a few tenths of an angstrom. X-ray crystallography allows measuring the size of these oscillations.|$|E
50|$|The {{result is}} that if the gap is very narrow only <b>diffraction</b> <b>patterns</b> with bright centers can occur.

As the gap becomes larger, the differentials between dark and light bands decrease until a diffraction effect can no longer be detected.|$|R

5|$|X-rays {{are used}} to produce the <b>diffraction</b> <b>pattern</b> because their {{wavelength}} λ is typically the same order of magnitude (1–100 angstroms) as the spacing d between planes in the crystal. In principle, any wave impinging on a regular array of scatterers produces diffraction, as predicted first by Francesco Maria Grimaldi in 1665. To produce significant diffraction, the spacing between the scatterers and the wavelength of the impinging wave should be similar in size. For illustration, the diffraction of sunlight through a bird's feather was first reported by James Gregory in the later 17th century. The first artificial diffraction gratings for visible light were constructed by David Rittenhouse in 1787, and Joseph von Fraunhofer in 1821. However, visible light has too long a wavelength (typically, 5500 angstroms) to observe diffraction from crystals. Prior to the first X-ray diffraction experiments, the spacings between lattice planes in a crystal were not known with certainty.|$|E

Many scientists have distinguished normal and cancerous breast tissue, bone density, and urinary stone types using the X-Ray <b>diffraction</b> <b>patterns</b> resulting from coherent scattering. The {{goal of this}} study was to introduce an optimized method for obtaining X-ray <b>diffraction</b> <b>patterns</b> of different types from biological tissues. Materials and Methods A special tool constituting primary and scatter collimators as well as a sample holder was designed and built. All measurements were done using an X-ray tube, the above-mentioned tool, and a semiconductor detector (HPGe). The X-ray <b>diffraction</b> <b>patterns</b> of some tissue-equivalent materials (acrylic, polyethylene, nylon, and calcium carbonate) and biological tissues (adipose, muscle, and bone) were obtained. Results The corresponding peak positions for adipose, muscle, bone, acrylic, polyethylene, nylon, and calcium carbonate in corresponding X-ray <b>diffraction</b> <b>patterns</b> are located in 1. 1 ± 0. 055 nm- 1, 1. 41 ± 0. 072, 1. 6 ± 0. 08 nm- 1, 0. 8 ± 0. 04 nm- 1, 1. 03 ± 0. 051 nm- 1, 1. 22 ± 0. 061 nm- 1, and 1. 7 ± 0. 085 nm- 1, respectively. Conclusion The X-ray <b>diffraction</b> <b>patterns</b> obtained in this study were in good agreement relative to previous measurements in terms of peak position.

The ability to retrieve phase information from <b>diffraction</b> <b>patterns</b> with heavy atoms, as in X-ray crystallography, would therefore open up new vistas.

Since the expected changes are small the intensities of electron <b>diffraction</b> <b>patterns</b> have to be measured with sufficient accuracy.
