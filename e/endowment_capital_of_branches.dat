40|$|We study {{decisions}} of subjects who are given {{an incentive to}} solve dynamic optimization problems with {{the structure of a}} single-agent, one-sector, closed economy macroeconomic model. The decision task involves a sequence of choices of consumption and investment levels. Treatment variables consist of the initial <b>endowment</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> stock, the production technology available to the economy, and the method of creating the structure of an infinite-horizon model. The study includes and contrasts data from both American and Japanese participants. We find that whether over- or underinvestment relative to the optimum occurs depends on the production technology, but not on the initial <b>endowment</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> stock, nor the subject pool used, nor the method of implementing the infinite horizon. Sudden episodes of maximal consumption called binges, which are always suboptimal, are widely observed. Dynamic optimization, Consumption, Investment, Experiment. ...|$|R

40|$|Subjective {{well-being}} depends on, {{among other}} factors, the household level {{of income and}} wealth, the respondent’s socio-economic characteristics (sex, age, employment status, etc [...] ) and social <b>capital</b> <b>endowment</b> <b>of</b> household place of residence (Sen, 1985). Limited {{attention has been dedicated}} to understanding to what extent people’s perception of their own well-being is influenced by social <b>capital</b> <b>endowment</b> <b>of</b> household place of residence. Interest in this type of problem arises from the need to highlight to what extent subjective perception of well-being depends on individual and family socio-economic conditions and to what extent it depends on the characteristics of the local context of where the family lives. Such evidence would help the central and local authorities and economic operators to choose the appropriate socio-economic measures in order to improve household living conditions.
