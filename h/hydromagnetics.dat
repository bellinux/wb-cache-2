The first three Rockets opened in 2005 at Noah's Ark Water Park (the snake-themed Black Anaconda), Six Flags New England, and the Great Wolf Lodge in the Pocono Mountains. [...] These three Rockets, {{as well as}} another one that opened the {{following}} year at the Great Wolf Lodge at Niagara Falls, used conveyor belts for their uphill sections. (In contrast, the water coasters made by NBGS International, who started building their water coasters at Schlitterbahn parks in the 1990s, use jets of water to blast riders up the hills.) More recent ProSlide Rockets, starting with the Super Tubes Hydrocoaster at WhiteWater World in Australia, have used the ProSlide <b>HydroMagnetics</b> system of Linear Induction Motors placed throughout the ride to launch riders up the uphill sections. <b>HydroMagnetics</b> uses Force Engineering LIM technology, which first gained recognition in the amusement park industry as the power behind launched roller coasters such as Flight of Fear and Speed - The Ride. ProSlide Rockets with <b>HydroMagnetics</b> are the first waterslides to use this same technology, which allows for more flexibility and efficiency in running the waterslides' uphill sections than the previous conveyor-belt system did. [...] In addition to the Supertubes Hydrocoaster, ProSlide also built a LIM-propelled Rocket at the Great Wolf Lodge near Kings Island in 2006; in 2007, LIM-launched Rockets will open at Naju Lake Waterpark in Korea and at Kentucky Kingdom.

We also find further instabilities due to the presence of the magnetic field. One of these, a destabilization of Alfven waves, requires the magnetic parameter to exceed a certain critical value. A second, involving a mixing of hydrodynamic and magnetic modes, occurs for all magnetic-field strengths. These instabilities may be important in tidally distorted or otherwise elliptical disks.

40|$|The paper {{shows that}} the {{experimentally}} observed close alignment of magnetic field minimum variance direction with the average magnetic field for Alfven waves in the solar wind is consistent with theoretically predicted properties of plane large amplitude Alfven waves in the MHD approximation.

Thus, spacecraft magnetometer observations in the solar wind of minimum variance directions strongly peaked about the average magnetic field direction are consistent with plane large amplitude Alfven waves which have wave normals aligned with the directions of minimum variance.

30|$|Mukhopadhyay [14] {{presented}} {{solutions for}} unsteady boundary layer flow and heat transfer over a stretching surface with variable fluid viscosity and thermal diffusivity in presence of wall suction. The study of magnetohydrodynamic flow of an electrically conducting fluid is of considerable interest in modern metallurgical and {{great interest in}} the study of magnetohydrodynamic flow and heat transfer in any medium due to the effect of magnetic field on the boundary layer flow control and on the performance of many systems using electrically conducting fluids. Many industrial processes involve the cooling of continuous strips or filaments by drawing them through a quiescent fluid. During this process, these strips are sometimes stretched. In these cases, the properties of the final product depend to a great extent on the rate of cooling. By drawing these strips in an electrically conducting fluid subjected to magnetic field, the rate of cooling can be controlled and the final product of required characteristics can be obtained. Another important application of <b>hydromagnetics</b> to metallurgy lies in the purification of molten metals from nonmetallic inclusion by the application of magnetic field.|$|E

The equations of motion appropriate to <b>hydromagnetics</b> in a Maxwellian fluid have been established and the analysis has been carried out in terms of normal modes.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of {{an introduction to the}} field of <b>hydromagnetics,</b> followed by three separate studies in this subject. The first is a study of the small-amplitude hydromagnetic radiation from a localized disturbing source in an unbounded dissipationless fluid permeated by a constant uniform magnetic field. The relevant linearized vector wave equation is treated by Fourier transform methods, utilizing the stationary-phase approximation. Asymptotic solutions are obtained for the wave-zone amplitude in the three modes emitted, and these are discussed in some detail; analytically, geometrically, and physically. Expressions are obtained for the angular distribution of the power radiated into these modes by a distributed source. The second study concerns itself with some special two-dimensional hydromagnetic steady flows. Various general properties of these flows are discussed. Ten exact solutions of the exact nonlinear equations of flow are derived and some of their features noted. The third study is an investigation of whether, for the case of a deep 'lake' of dissipationless incompressible conducting fluid in a constant uniform magnetic field, there exist characteristic small-amplitude gravity surface-waves different from those known in hydrodynamics. It is concluded that no surface waves exist at all if the magnetic field has a component normal to the undisturbed surface, and that if the field is tangential to the surface, there are no new wave types with a characteristic dispersion law...|$|E

We take the unperturbed cloud conguration to be in hydrostatic equilibrium. We nd a class of wave solutions which propagate along a pressure supported cylinder (or slab) and have nite (trapped) spatial distributions in the direction perpendicular to the direction of propagation.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{study is}} presented to investigate the influence of variable transport properties and momentum, thermal and mass slip on magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) momentum, heat and mass transfer in a porous media. Slip effects are simulated via careful imposition of boundary conditions at the wall. Joule heating and viscous dissipation are also studied. The governing partial differential boundary layer equations are analyzed using Lie group theory and rendered with appropriate transformations into a system of nonlinear, coupled ordinary differential equations. The multi-physical boundary value problem is dictated by twelve thermophysical parameters- concentration diffusivity parameter (Dc), Hartmann magnetic number (M), permeability parameter (omaga), Eckert number (Ec), momentum slip (a), thermal slip (b), mass (species) slip (d), Prandtl number (Pr), Schmidt number (Sc), power law index for non-isothermal and non-iso-solutal effects (m), viscosity variation parameter (A) and thermal conductivity variation parameter (S). A numerical solution is obtained {{for the effects of}} selected parameters on transport characteristics using the robust Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg fourth-fifth order numerical quadrature method in Maple 16. Excellent correlation is achieved between the present computational results and for the constant transport properties (A=S=Dc= 0), nonporous (omega= 0), non-thermal slip (b= 0), non-solutal slip (d = 0) and non-dissipative solutions without Joule heating (Ec= 0) of Yazdi et al. [35]. Increasing momentum slip enhances temperatures whereas increasing thermal slip reduces them. An increase in thermal conductivity boosts temperatures whereas greater viscosity reduces temperatures. Increasing magnetic parameter suppresses velocity and increasing permeability parameter elevates temperatures. Species concentration is enhanced with increasing concentration diffusivity and permeability parameter but depressed with increasing viscosity. Furthermore concentration is enhanced with momentum slip but reduced with mass slip parameter. Moreover increasing magnetic field is observed to aid species diffusion in the regime.

40|$|We study {{nonlinear}} wave {{phenomena in}} self-gravitating fluid systems, {{with a particular}} emphasis on applications to molecular clouds. This paper presents analytical results for one spatial dimension. We show that a large class of physical systems can be described by theories with a “charge density ” q(ρ); this quantity replaces the density on the right hand side of the Poisson equation for the gravitational potential. We use this formulation to prove general results about nonlinear wave motions in self-gravitating systems. We show {{that in order for}} stationary waves to exist, the total charge (the integral of the charge density over the wave profile) must vanish. This “no-charge ” property for solitary waves is related to the capability of a system to be stable to gravitational perturbations for arbitrarily long wavelengths. We find necessary and sufficient conditions on the charge density for the existence of solitary waves and stationary waves. We study nonlinear wave motions for Jeans-type theories [where q(ρ) = ρ − ρ 0] and find that nonlinear waves of large amplitude are confined to a rather narrow range of wavelengths. We also study wave motions for molecular clouds threaded by magnetic fields and show how the allowed range of wavelengths is affected by the field strength. Since the gravitational force in one spatial dimension does not fall off with distance, we consider two classes of models with more realistic gravity: Yukawa potentials and a pseudo-two-dimensional treatment. We study the allowed types of wave behavior for these models. Finally, we discuss the implications of this work for molecular cloud structure. We argue that molecular clouds can support a wide variety of wave motions and suggest that stationary waves (such as those considered in this paper) may have already been observed.
