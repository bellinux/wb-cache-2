By 1963, their experience allowed them to launch a new intercom, this time designed for apartment blocks or buildings, in other words, an audio door entry system. It {{was the first to}} be designed exclusively in Spain and for years remained the only one.The vertical residential structure adopted in Spanish developmentalism helped spread the audio entry system’s use as an <b>item</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> consumption and facilitated the company’s development. In 1974, Fermax began producing its type T-1 interphone model, a wall-mounted receiver which held sway in the market until 1987, and went on to manufacture 4,500,000 units of what {{is considered one of the}} icons of Spanish industrial design. Fermax started manufacturing video door entry systems as of 1980 and subsequently went on to include other access control systems.|$|E

The choice of the interval and definition of the functions are realized by means of the analysis of databases containing more than six hundred projects of high-speed vessels made of composite materials.

It is possible to get the family of the main dimensions and other characteristics of the vessels made from composite materials, balanced by the ratios of the main dimensions and elements <b>of</b> the <b>mass</b> load, with the help of variations along the basic length. Formulas, reflecting the rational ratios of the vessels from the composites with dominant subsystems, and providing increased characteristics of speed, and with the overall length from 9 up to 26 m, and for different purposes, are obtained.

40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} of the University of Wolverhampton for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. The place and presence of everyday and unworn dress in museums has been largely overlooked in museological and historical accounts of museums and collections. Instead, the focus has been upon the study of elite, spectacular and worn clothing. Similarly, little academic {{attention has been paid to}} small-scale, local government operated social history museums, with the bulk of research being conducted into elite national and metropolitan museums or the spectacle of living history museums. This thesis addresses these omissions through a biographical investigation into a single collection of everyday and unworn clothing held by a small and local social history museum: Walsall Museum’s Hodson Shop Collection. Discovered in 1983, the collection consists of around 5, 000 <b>items</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> produced unsold shop stock, mainly women’s clothing, from between 1920 and the 1960 s. It comprises of the stock of the Hodson General and Fancy Drapers, a small clothing shop located in the lock-making town of Willenhall, West Midlands. Sisters, Edith and Flora Hodson operated the shop between 1920 and around 1971 in the front room of their family home. This thesis provides both a detailed biographical account of the Hodson Shop Collection and a timely account of Walsall Museum’s struggle for survival in an age of increasing austerity. It focuses upon the passage of a large quantity of everyday shop stock items from the world of retail to the museum. Firstly, it demonstrates how the collection has been subject to a range of complex and interconnected external and organisational influences, through an account of its journey to Walsall Museum and its life within the museum, 1983 - 2016. A number of binary oppositions and hierarchies are explored to show how shifting ideas of value have influenced the survival and visibility of the collection and museum. Secondly, it shows how the statuses <b>of</b> everyday and <b>mass</b> produced items are altered by accession to a museum, challenging the assumption that biographical approaches are most suitable for dealing with ‘spectacular’ aspects of material culture. The story of the Hodson Shop Collection challenges the perception of the museum as a safe and static environment...|$|R
40|$|Cluster {{analysis}} (CA) is {{a powerful}} strategy for the exploration of high-dimensional data {{in the absence of}} a-priori hypotheses or data classification models, and the results of CA can then be used to form such models. But even though formal models and classification rules may not exist in these data exploration scenarios, domain scientists and experts generally have a vast amount of non-compiled knowledge and intuition that they can bring to bear in this effort. In CA, there are various popular mechanisms to generate the clusters, however, the results from their nonsupervised deployment rarely fully agree with this expert knowledge and intuition. To this end, our paper describes a comprehensive and intuitive framework to aid scientists in the derivation of classification hierarchies in CA, using k-means as the overall clustering engine, but allowing them to tune its parameters interactively based on a non-distorted compact visual presentation of the inherent characteristics of the data in highdimensional space. These include cluster geometry, composition, spatial relations to neighbors, and others. In essence, we provide all the tools necessary for a high-dimensional activity we call cluster sculpting, and the evolving hierarchy can then be viewed in a space-efficient radial dendrogram. We demonstrate our system {{in the context of the}} mining and classification of a large collection of millions <b>of</b> data <b>items</b> <b>of</b> aerosol <b>mass</b> spectra, but our framework readily applies to any high-dimensional CA scenario...|$|R

In the comparison among the healthy group, the group with cardiac rehabilitation, and the group without cardiac rehabilitation, except for the sub-scale of social inhibition, no significant differences were found. The Cronbach alpha coefficient was 0. 66 - 0. 80. Four factors having the similar structure to the sub-scales were extracted.
