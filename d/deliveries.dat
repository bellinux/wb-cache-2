40|$|Despite {{differences}} among theories, both visionary content and an expressive <b>delivery</b> are consistently associated with charismatic leadership (Awamleh & Gardner, 1999; Holladay & Coombs, 1994). The current {{study investigated the}} effects of content (visionary, nonvisionary) and <b>delivery</b> (strong, weak, written) on ratings of charisma, performance, satisfaction, and self-efficacy. Consistent with previous research, both content and <b>delivery</b> affected perceptions of charisma. However, only <b>delivery</b> affected performance. Specifically, participants in the high <b>delivery</b> and written <b>delivery</b> conditions rated their leaders higher and performed better than participants in the low <b>delivery</b> condition. However, {{there were no differences}} between the high <b>delivery</b> and no <b>delivery</b> conditions, suggesting that the outcomes may have been driven by a negative effect of the low <b>delivery</b> condition, as opposed to a positive effect of the high <b>delivery</b> condition. There was no effect for content or <b>delivery</b> on satisfaction or self-efficacy. Practical and theoretical implications are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The <b>delivery</b> {{of digital}} content and {{services}} to end users in an access-technology agnostic manner {{has the potential to}} promote equitable access. Components of relevant Information and Communication Technology (ICT) functionality comprise of computing, connectivity, content and capacity. These functionalities are extended to include the <b>delivery</b> mechanism. The <b>delivery</b> mechanism is responsible for the actual <b>delivery</b> of digital content {{and services to}} communities or individual end users. The {{purpose of this study is}} describing a content <b>delivery</b> mechanism that provides access-technology agnostic <b>delivery</b> of digital content and services to resource-constrained communities. The proposed <b>delivery</b> mechanism adopts the conceptual service <b>delivery</b> architecture of the telecommunications service <b>delivery</b> platforms. It reuses the concepts of network abstraction and access agnostic <b>delivery</b> pattern to ensure equitable access to digital content and services. Such a <b>delivery</b> mechanism would be able to capitalize on available technological capabilities of resource-constrained communities.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Nasal drug <b>delivery</b> has {{occupied}} {{an important}} {{place in the}} field of drug <b>delivery</b> technology. Transmucosal nasal <b>delivery</b> is a promising drug <b>delivery</b> option where common drug administration’s (e. g. intravenous, intramuscular, and oral) are inapplicable. This route is also advisable for drugs undergoing extensive first pass effect. The physiology of the nose presents obstacles, but offers a promising route for non-invasive systemic <b>delivery</b> of numerous therapies and debatably drug <b>delivery</b> route to the brain. Nasal route is easily accessible for selfadministration without the help of health professionals and no needle stick hazards are associated with nasal administration. To overcome these problems in nasal drug <b>delivery,</b> deep understanding and study of the various factors affecting nasal <b>delivery</b> is muust. Thus present review focuses on various aspects of nasal drug <b>delivery</b> with special emphasis on various formulations available, obstacles, advancement and future prospects in nasal drug <b>delivery...</b>|$|R

Quality data collection proceed by interview, which was carried out with women after <b>delivery</b> on confinement ward in hospital Prachatice.
