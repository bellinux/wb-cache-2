40|$|Determination of {{antibody}} avidity measurements can {{be difficult}} in human serum depending on the population evaluated. We evaluated three approaches for the determination of antibody avidity for immunoglobulin G (IgG). These approaches were (i) elution of bound antibody with increasing concentrations of a chaotropic agent using a single serum dilution, (ii) binding interference of multiple serum dilutions by a single concentration of a chaotrope, and (iii) elution of multiple serum dilutions by a single concentration of a chaotrope. Parameters that affect the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>avidity</b> measurements and their limitations were evaluated with pre- and post-Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccination sera (n = 89). We determined that elution of low-avidity antibodies present in multiple dilutions of the serum sample by a single concentration of a chaotrope (0. 15 M sodium thiocyanate [NaSCN]) was optimal for the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>avidity</b> measurements throughout {{a wide range of}} IgG concentrations (0. 94 to 304. 6 μg/ml). The percent reduction in concentration as determined by the elution assay with 0. 15 M NaSCN correlated highly (r = 0. 84) with weighted averages obtained by an elution assay with multiple solutions of NaSCN. The correlation (r = 0. 57) between elution and binding interference, when a single concentration of a chaotrope was used, was lower than the correlation between the two elution methods (r = 0. 84). We found that the serum dilution, the heterogeneity of the antibody population, and the concentration of the chaotrope were the primary variables affecting avidity determinations. In this study, we present multiple analysis methods depending on the methodology used. We also present the factors that affect the analysis of avidity determinations given the polyclonal nature of human sera. This experimental approach should benefit the evaluation of similar antibodies induced by other bacterial polysaccharide vaccines...|$|E
40|$|After the {{development}} of the new version of the test Vidas Toxo IgG with antigens obtained from tachyzoites cultured on cells, a Vidas avidity test has been recently developed. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the value of the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>avidity</b> on the new Vidas test. This avidity test was performed on 553 sera obtained from pregnant women whose dates of infection had been determined and on 50 sera obtained from immunosuppressed patients. In the group of infection occurring less than 4 months before sampling, the avidity index was 0. 3 for 44 / 46 sera of pregnant women and for 47 / 47 sera of immunosuppressed patients. Thus, the new version of avidity test was helpful primarily to rule out that an infection had occurred within the prior 4 months...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Avidity {{determination}} of antigen-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies is an established serological method to differentiate acute from past infections. In order {{to compare the}} avidity of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) IgG in pairs of serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples, we developed a new technique of avidity testing, the results of which are not influenced by the concentration of specific IgG. Methods The modifications introduced for the new VZV IgG avidity method included the use of urea hydrogen peroxide as denaturing reagent, the adaptation of the assay parameters {{in order to increase}} the sensitivity for the detection of low-level VZV IgG in CSF, and the use of a new calculation method for avidity results. The calculation method is based on the observation that the relationship between the absorbance values of the enzyme immunoassays with and without denaturing washing step is linear. From this relationship, a virtual absorbance ratio can be calculated. To evaluate the new method, a panel of serum samples from patients with acute and past VZV infection was tested as well as pairs of serum and CSF. Results For the serum panel, avidity determination with the modified assay gave results comparable to standard avidity methods. Based on the coefficient of variation, the new calculation method was superior to established methods of avidity calculation. Conclusions The new avidity method permits a meaningful comparison of VZV IgG avidity in serum and CSF and should be of general applicability for easy <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>avidity</b> results, which are not affected by the concentration of specific IgG. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{hemolytic}} plaque {{formation of}} cells producing antibody against heterologous albumins was tested for sensitivity to specific inhibition by free antigen. The inhibition characteristics of plaques {{in this system}} {{were found to be}} a measure for the <b>avidity</b> <b>of</b> the antibody produced by the plaque-forming cells (PFC:s). High avidity-producing PFC:s were more sensitive to inhibition than low avidity PFC:s. Immunization with a high dose of antigen induced PFC:s that produced antibody with a lower avidity as compared to PFC:s from animals immunized with a low dose. The avidity was increased with time. <b>Determinations</b> <b>of</b> <b>avidity</b> at the serum level were also made, and the results were in agreement with the findings at the cellular level. The present method made it possible to demonstrate differences in <b>avidity</b> <b>of</b> antibody {{at the level of the}} single antibody-forming cell.

40|$|<b>Determination</b> <b>of</b> the <b>avidity</b> <b>of</b> {{immunoglobulin}} G (IgG) {{directed against}} a specific marker {{has become an}} established diagnostic tool for identifying or excluding acute infections with pathogens. A novel assay format termed AVIcomp (avidity competition based on mass action) circumventing the conventional chaotropic format has been developed for <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> the <b>avidity</b> <b>of</b> marker-specific IgG in patient specimens. Its applications for cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Toxoplasma gondii are presented. Specific high-avidity IgG from the patient specimen is selectively blocked using a soluble antigen in a sample pretreatment reagent, {{and the amount of}} remaining specific low-avidity IgG is determined relative to that in an untreated control. The comparison of the conventional chaotropic format, represented by the Radim CMV IgG Avidity assay, and the newly developed AVIcomp method, as exemplified by the Architect CMV IgG Avidity assay, on blood drawn within 4 months after seroconversion revealed a sensitivity of 100 % (97. 3 % by an alternative calculation) for the AVIcomp format versus 87. 5 % (75. 7 % by an alternative calculation) for the chaotropic avidity assay. The specificity on 312 CMV IgG reactive and CMV IgM nonreactive specimens from pregnant women was 100 % for the AVIcomp assay and 99. 7 % for the conventional avidity assay. The Architect Toxo IgG Avidity assay showed an agreement of 97. 2 % with the bioMérieux Vidas Toxo IgG Avidity Assay employing chaotropic reagents. These performance data suggest that the AVIcomp format shows superior sensitivity and equivalent specificity for the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> IgG <b>avidity</b> to assays based on the chaotropic method and that the AVIcomp format may also be applicable to other disease states...|$|R

40|$|There is a {{high degree}} of {{variability}} in the serologic response to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, especially in viral capsid antigen (VCA) -IgM antibodies. Therefore, additional tests are needed to confirm primary infection. We evaluated the value <b>of</b> IgG <b>avidity</b> <b>determination</b> in diagnosis <b>of</b> EBV infection in immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. A total of 236 serum samples from immunocompetent patients with symptoms suggestive of EBV infection were tested for the presence of VCA-IgM/IgG antibodies and IgG avidity. Using IgG avidity, acute primary infection was confirmed in 56. 7 % of the immunocompetent patients with positive and in 1. 8 % of patients with negative VCA-IgM. Recent primary infection was documented in 8. 9 % of the IgM positive and 3. 5 % of the IgM negative patients. In patients with indeterminate serology (equivocal IgM), 6. 7 % were classified by avidity index (AI) as acute primary infection, 10. 0 % as post-acute and 83. 3 % as past infection cases. Concerning the 32 immunocompromised patients, recent primary infection was documented in 3 of the 14 IgM positive patients. High AI was detected in 11 of these patients, indicating an IgM response due to reactivation. <b>Determination</b> <b>of</b> IgG <b>avidity</b> in combination with classical serologic markers seems to be a reliable method to confirm primary infection both in immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients.

IgM antibodies were detected by an indirect immunofluorescence test and by three commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Anti-T. gondii IgA was quantified by the a -capture ELISA technique using a commercial kit. As defined by the manufacturer of the IgA ELISA test used, most patients with acute toxoplasmosis have antibody levels > 40 arbitrary units per ml (AU/mL). At this cut-off level, the patient still had a positive ELISA result (45 AU/mL) in a serum sample taken one year after the beginning of clinical manifestations. The IgG avidity-ELISA test was performed with the Falcon assay screening test (F. A. S. T. ®) - ELISA system. Avidity indices compatible with a recent Toxoplasma infection were found only in serum samples taken during the first 5 months after the onset of the clinical symptoms of toxoplasmosis. These results show that the interpretation of positive IgM results as indicative of recently acquired toxoplasmosis requires additional laboratory confirmation either by other tests or by the demonstration of a significant rise in the antibody titers in sequential serum samples...|$|R

40|$|Since its {{introduction}} in 1999, West Nile virus (WNV) infections have spread rapidly across the North American continent. Diagnosis of acute WNV infection by detection of WNV-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) {{is complicated by}} the persistence of detectable IgM for more than 1 year in some patients. IgG antibody avidity testing was assessed as a supplemental assay in the diagnosis of current infections. Three groups of serum samples were assayed in parallel by two different IgG avidity test systems (indirect immunofluorescence test [IIFT] and prototype enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]; EUROIMMUN, Luebeck, Germany). Group I (40 sera taken between 2 and 9 days after the onset of influenza-like symptoms) and group II (40 sera taken between 10 and 43 days after onset) were acute and convalescent specimens from patients with a positive anti-WNV IgM test (ELISA; Focus Diagnostics, Cypress, CA). Group III consisted of 43 patient sera collected between 6 and 12 months after infection. IgG antibodies specific for WNV were detected in 38 % (ELISA) and 50 % (IIFT) of group I sera, in 90 % (ELISA and IIFT) of group II sera, and in 100 % (ELISA and IIFT) of group III sera. Low-avidity IgG antibodies were demonstrated in 86 % (ELISA) and 95 % (IIFT) of IgG-positive patient samples taken between 2 and 43 days after the onset of symptoms (groups I and II). High-avidity IgG antibodies were detected in 100 % of group III sera obtained 6 months or more after the onset of symptoms (ELISA and IIFT).

40|$|Epstein Barr Virus (EBV), also {{classified}} as Human Herpes Virus 4, infects {{the vast majority}} of adults worldwide and establishes both non-productive (latent) and productive (lytic) infection. Classical EBV diagnosis includes quantitative <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> viral DNA and serological analysis, based on the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> IgG and IgM responses against the viral capsid antigen (VCA) and the IgG response against the EBV nuclear antigen- 1 (EBNA- 1). EBV-serology can be misleading in some cases, such as acute infections with low or undetectable VCA IgM, convalescent patients with persistent or reactivated VCA IgM and negative anti- EBNA- 1 IgG, due to a loss of this marker during immunosuppression. In all these cases <b>avidity</b> <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> IgG is helpful to prevent false diagnosis. Avidity represents the stability of the antigen-antibody interaction.

40|$|Age-dependent {{variations}} <b>of</b> antibody <b>avidity</b> {{were studied}} in the C 3 HeB/FeJ mouse. Spleen cells from donors of different ages (10 [...] 720 days) were transferred and stimulated with TNP-HRBC in lethally irradiated syngenic recipients. The anti-TNP antibody response of the donor cells was estimated {{from the number of}} direct PFC per recipient spleen by the Jerne technique with TNP-SRBC. <b>Avidity</b> <b>of</b> the antibodies secreted by PFC was evaluated from the amount of added TNP-BSA that inhibited 50 % of the anti-TNP PFC. Under these experimental conditions allowing the exclusion of any influence of the donor milieu during the immune response, age-dependent variations of the antibody response and avidity could be attributed to changes in the donor spleen cell population. Avidity was found to increase with the response and to vary parabolically with age. After appropriate correction of the number of PFC to make it independent from age, avidity values were fitted by a multiple curvilinear regression in which the independent variables playing a significant role were the corrected number of PFC in its linear term and the age in its linear and quadratic terms.

The analysis <b>of</b> the <b>avidity</b> distribution <b>of</b> antibodies produced by plaque-forming cells (PFC) indicated that the observed decrease in the average avidity is primarily due to the selective loss <b>of</b> high <b>avidity</b> subpopulation <b>of</b> PFC leaving low avidity subpopulation relatively unaffected.

We have established an enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) for avidity (functional affinity) measurements, based {{on the ability of}} urea to dissociate low avidity antibody-antigen complexes. In the avidity ELISA LPS-coated microliter plates are incubated with pig sera and afterwards treated with urea. In parallel the same sera are incubated without subsequent urea treatment.

In the three patients with clinically long-lasting responses to HDC plus HSCT (median 423 days), significant reductions in ACPA-IgG levels after therapy were observed (median level dropped from 215 to 34 arbitrary units/ml; P = 0. 05). In contrast, stable ACPA-IgG levels were observed in three patients who relapsed shortly after HDC plus HSCT (median of 67 days). Clinical responders had ACPA-IgG <b>of</b> lower <b>avidity</b> (r = 0. 75; P = 0. 08) and higher degree of inflammation histologically (r = 0. 73; P = 0. 09). Relapse (after 38 to 530 days) in all patients was preceded by rising levels <b>of</b> low <b>avidity</b> ACPA-IgG (after 30 to 388 days), {{in contrast to the}} stable titres <b>of</b> high <b>avidity</b> TT antibodies. In conclusion, humoral autoimmune responses were differentially modulated by immunoablative therapy in patients with synovial inflammation and low avidity ACPA-IgG autoantibodies as compared with patients with high levels <b>of</b> high <b>avidity</b> ACPA-IgG. The distinct clinical disease course after immunoablative therapy based on levels and <b>avidity</b> <b>of</b> ACPA-IgG indicates that refractory RA is not a single disease entity...|$|R
40|$|High avidity CTL {{are most}} {{effective}} at clearing viruses and cancer cells. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms involved in induction <b>of</b> high <b>avidity</b> CTL is critical for effective vaccines. However, no vaccine approach to selectively induce high avidity CTL in vivo has been discovered. In a new approach, signals from MHC class I (signal 1) and costimulatory molecules (signal 2) were adjusted by varying Ag dose and by use of recombinant poxvirus expressing a triad of costimulatory molecules (B 7 - 1, ICAM- 1, and LFA- 3), respectively. Independent <b>of</b> CTL <b>avidity,</b> a strong signal 1 resulted in an increased frequency of CD 8 + CTL. However, a strong signal 2 was necessary for the induction <b>of</b> high <b>avidity</b> CD 8 + CTL that killed target cells more efficiently, and signal 2 played a more {{crucial role in the}} absence of a strong signal 1. Only CTL induced with strong signal 2 killed tumor cells endogenously expressing low levels of Ag. Signal 2 contributed to the induction <b>of</b> high <b>avidity</b> CD 8 + CTL in both primary and secondary responses. Thus, although signal 2 has been known to increase the quantity of CTL response, in this study we show that it also improves the quality of CTL response. Our data also suggested that dendritic cells play an important role in induction <b>of</b> high <b>avidity</b> CD 8 + CTL in vivo. This strategy to selectively induce higher avidity CTL may lead to more effective vaccines for viruses and cancer...|$|R
40|$|Virus-specific {{cytotoxic}} T lymphocytes (CTL) {{with high}} levels <b>of</b> functional <b>avidity</b> {{have been associated with}} viral clearance in hepatitis C virus infection and enhanced antiviral protective immunity in animal models. However, the role <b>of</b> functional <b>avidity</b> as a determinant of HIV-specific CTL efficacy remains to be assessed. Here, we measured the functional <b>avidities</b> <b>of</b> HIV-specific CTL responses targeting 20 different, optimally defined CTL epitopes restricted by 13 different HLA class I alleles in a cohort comprising 44 HIV controllers and 68 HIV non-controllers. Responses restricted by HLA-B alleles and responses targeting epitopes located in HIV Gag exhibited significantly higher functional avidities than responses restricted by HLA-A or HLA-C molecules (p= 0. 0003) or responses targeting epitopes outside Gag (p< 0. 0001). The functional <b>avidities</b> <b>of</b> Gag-specific and HLA-B-restricted responses were higher in HIV controllers than non-controllers (p= 0. 014 and p= 0. 018) and were not restored in HIV non-controllers initiating antiretroviral therapy. T-cell receptor (TCR) analyses revealed narrower TCR repertoires in higher avidity CTL populations, which were dominated by public TCR sequences in HIV controllers. Together, these data link the presence <b>of</b> high <b>avidity</b> Gag-specific and HLA-B-restricted CTL responses with viral suppression in vivo and provide new insights into the immune parameters that mediate spontaneous control of HIV infection...|$|R

The comparative assessment of the mouse and human PRIG avidity against ovalbumin and horse myoglobin and the <b>avidity</b> <b>of</b> specific monoclonal antibodies against ovalbumin have shown that the <b>avidity</b> <b>of</b> PRIG not only is much less than the <b>avidity</b> <b>of</b> monoclonal antibodies but even exceeds it...|$|R
40|$|Coeliac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy {{triggered}} by ingestion of wheat gluten and related cereals in genetically predisposed individuals. Circulating immunoglobulin A (IgA) class autoantibodies against tissue transglutaminase (IgA–TGA) are highly specific and sensitive serological markers for CD, which is ultimately confirmed by duodenal biopsy. Although CD {{is considered a}} life-long disorder, transient or fluctuating IgA–TGA seropositivity has been observed in asymptomatic individuals on a gluten-containing diet. We set out to explore possible differences in the maturation <b>of</b> IgA–TGA <b>avidity</b> between individuals progressing to CD and subjects remaining healthy despite occasional expression of autoantibodies. We developed a time-resolved fluorometric IgA–TGA assay based on human recombinant tissue transglutaminase (tTG), and further modified the method to also measure urea-dependent <b>avidity</b> <b>of</b> the autoantibodies. We measured the autoantibody titres and <b>avidities</b> <b>of</b> sequential serum samples from 10 children developing CD and 10 children presenting transient or fluctuating autoantibodies. Both the initial titres at seroconversion and peak values of transient/fluctuating IgA–TGA were significantly lower than corresponding autoantibody titres in samples drawn from individuals with progressing CD (P = 0 · 004 and P = 0 · 0002, respectively). However, there were {{no statistically significant differences}} in the initial or peak avidity index values between the two groups <b>of</b> children. The <b>avidity</b> index values increased during the follow-up period (P = 0 · 013 for both groups) with {{no significant difference in the}} rate <b>of</b> <b>avidity</b> maturation between children with transient/fluctuating IgA–TGA and children developing CD. According to our results, high autoantibody titres have a higher predictive value than <b>avidity</b> maturation <b>of</b> TGA-IgA in screening for CD...|$|R
