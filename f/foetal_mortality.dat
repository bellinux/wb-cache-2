40|$|To {{compare the}} change in foetal and {{neonatal}} mortality in the Netherlands between 2004 and 2010 with {{the change in}} other European countries. Descriptive, population-based study. Data from the Euro-Peristat project on foetal and neonatal mortality in European countries were analysed for changes between 2004 and 2010. The Netherlands was compared with 26 other European countries and regions. International differences in registration and policy were taken into account using figures on <b>foetal</b> <b>mortality</b> starting at 28 weeks of pregnancy and neonatal mortality starting at 24 weeks of pregnancy. <b>Foetal</b> <b>mortality</b> in the Netherlands declined by 33 %, from 4. 3 per 1000 births in 2004 to 2. 9 per 1000 births in 2010 while neonatal mortality declined by 21 %, from 2. 8 per 1000 live births in 2004 to 2. 2 per 1000 live births in 2010. Perinatal mortality (the sum of <b>foetal</b> <b>mortality</b> and neonatal mortality) declined by 27 %, from 7. 0 to 5. 1 per 1000. In the European ranking, the Netherlands shifted from 23 rd to 13 th place for foetal mortality; it remained the same for neonatal mortality (15 th of 22 countries) and virtually the same for perinatal mortality (from 15 th to 13 th of 22 countries). Both <b>foetal</b> <b>mortality</b> at 28 + weeks and neonatal mortality at 24 + weeks declined in the Netherlands between 2004 and 2010.

40|$|A best {{evidence}} topic was written {{according to a}} structured protocol. The question addressed was whether cardiopulmonary bypass can be used safely with satisfactory maternal and foetal outcomes in pregnant patients undergoing cardiac surgery. A total of 679 papers were found using the reported searches of which 14 represented the {{best evidence}} to answer the clinical question. The authors, date, journal, study type, population, main outcome measures and results are tabulated. Reported measures were maternal and <b>foetal</b> <b>mortality</b> and complications, mode of delivery, cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic cross-clamp times, perfusate flow rate and tempera-ture and maternal NYHA functional class. The most recent of the best evidence studies, a retrospective observational study of 21 preg-nant patients reported early and late maternal mortalities of 4. 8 and 14. 3 %, respectively, and a <b>foetal</b> <b>mortality</b> of 14. 3 %. Median cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic cross-clamp times were 53 and 35 min, respectively, and the median bypass temperature was 37 °C. Three larger retrospective reviews of the literature reported maternal mortality rates of 2. 9 – 5. 1 % and <b>foetal</b> <b>mortality</b> rates of 19 – 29 %. Mean cardiopulmonary bypass times ranged from 50. 5 to 77. 8 min. Another retrospective observational study reported maternal mor-tality of 13. 3 % and <b>foetal</b> <b>mortality</b> of 38. 5 %. Mean cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic cross-clamp times were 89. 1 and 62. 8 min, re-spectively, with a mean bypass temperature of 31. 8 °C. A retrospective case series reported no maternal mortality and one case of <b>foetal</b> <b>mortality.</b> Median cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic cross-clamp times were 101 and 88 min, respectively.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the timing of <b>foetal</b> <b>mortality</b> in gilts of a segregating F 2 cross of Large White and Meishan pigs on the basis of the length distribution of mummified foetuses and the frequency of non-fresh stillborn piglets in order to establish whether critical periods for <b>foetal</b> <b>mortality</b> exist. All expelled conceptuses and placentae of 192 farrowing gilts with a normal health status were meticulously investigated to recover all mummified foetuses. The length of each mummified foetus was measured. The predicted number of foetuses present per gilt at the early foetal stage of gestation was calculated as the sum of numbers of mummified foetuses and non-fresh stillborn, fresh stillborn and liveborn piglets. Foetal loss was calculated as the sum of mummified foetuses and non-fresh stillborn piglets. The average <b>foetal</b> <b>mortality</b> rate per gilt was 8. 7 %. In total 162 mummified foetuses were found (average 0. 84 per litter), ranging in length from 0. 4 to 33. 0 cm. This indicates a range in foetal age at death of similar to 35 - 100 days. Although mummified foetuses of all lengths within the above mentioned range were found, relatively many had a length of less than 4 cm or of 10 - 21 cm. The total number of non-fresh stillborn piglets (i. e. late foetal deaths) was 58 (average 0. 30 per litter). It can be concluded that <b>foetal</b> <b>mortality</b> occurred in these gilts throughout the period from day 35 to term, with relatively high incidences at the early foetal stage (days 35 - 40), shortly after mid-pregnancy (days 55 - 75) and after similar today 100 of gestation. These three periods coincide with reported periods of change in porcine placental growth. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|International audienceBackground: Ethnic {{disparities in}} {{perinatal}} mortality are well known. This study aims {{to explore the}} contribution of demographic, socioeconomic, health behavioural and pre-existent medical risk factors among different ethnic groups on foetal and early neonatal mortality. Methods: We assessed perinatal mortality from 24. 0 weeks gestation onwards in 554, 234 singleton pregnancies of nulliparous women in the linked Netherlands Perinatal Registry over the period 2000 - 2006. Logistic regression modelling was used. Results: Considerable ethnic differences in perinatal mortality exists especially in <b>foetal</b> <b>mortality.</b> Maternal age, socioeconomic status and pre-existent diseases could not explain these ethnic differences. Late booking visit could explain some differences. Compared to the ethnic Dutch, African women had an increased <b>foetal</b> <b>mortality</b> risk of odds ratio 1. 7 (95 % CI 1. 4 to 2. 1), South Asian women of 1. 8 (1. 4 to 2. 3), other non-Western women of 1. 3 (1. 1 to 1. 6) and Turkish/Moroccan women of 1. 3 (1. 1 to 1. 4). The risk on early neonatal mortality was only increased in other non-Western women, odds ratio 1. 3 (1. 0 to 1. 8). Ethnic differences were even present in the women without risk factors including preterm births. Mortality risk for East-Asian and other Western women was lower or comparable to the ethnic Dutch. Conclusion: Important ethnic differences in <b>foetal</b> <b>mortality</b> exist, especially among women of African and South Asian origin. Ethnic minorities should be more acquainted with the significance of early start of prenatal care. More research on underlying cause of deaths is needed by ethnic group...|$|E

Bacteraemia mostly occurred in the third trimester of pregnancy (45 %) and was community-acquired (79 %). Portals of entry were urinary (55 %) and genital (45 %). E. coli strains belonged mainly to phylogroups B 2 (72 %) and D (17 %). Four clonal lineages (i. e. sequence type complex (STc) 73, STc 95, STc 12 and STc 69) represented 65 % of the strains. The strains exhibited {{a high number of}} virulence factor coding genes (10 (3 – 16)). Six foetuses died (27 %), five of them due to bacteraemia of genital origin (83 %). Foetal deaths occurred despite adequate antibiotic regimens. Strains associated with <b>foetal</b> <b>mortality</b> had fewer virulence factors (8 (6 – 10)) than strains involved in no <b>foetal</b> <b>mortality</b> (11 (4 – 12)) (p 0. 02).

40|$|BACKGROUND Asphyxia is {{a leading}} cause of <b>foetal</b> {{neonatal}} <b>mortality</b> and morbidity. Nucleated red blood cell count (NRBC) produced as compensatory response to asphyxia in foetus and NRBC level can be correlated to asphyxia. Because the present indices are unhelpful in the diagnosis and prediction of the severity of asphyxia, we wished to investigate the relationship between the nucleated RBC count and the severity & immediate outcome of perinatal asphyxia. METHOD This prospective comparative study was conducted in maternity ward of Obstetrics & Gynaecology Department and Paediatric Department of GSVM Medical College, Kanpur (Central UP), from January 2014 to September 2014. Newborns of term gestation were selected after satisfying inclusion criteria and were divided in 2 groups. The control group consisted 60 normal newborns and case group had 60 asphyxiated newborns. The cord blood was collected soon after birth, investigated for pH and making smears that were stained with Leishman’s stain. NRBCs were counted against 100 WBCs. The statistical analysis was done using IMSTAT. RESULTS The mean NRBC count in the study group was 22. 63 ± 6. 95 as compared to 4. 75 ± 2. 04 in the control group (p=< 0. 0001). The NRBC count was significantly higher in low pH, neonates with low Apgar scores of < 3 at 1 minutes, newborns with HIE stage III & in neonates who were neurological abnormal at discharge (P= 0. 0001).

40|$|Perinatal {{mortality}} rates have dropped {{sharply in the}} past few decades, in the Netherlands as well as in all other European countries. However, as the decrease has generally slowed down since the 1980 s, the Netherlands has lost its prominent position in the international ranking of countries with favourable perinatal {{mortality rates}}. This lower ranking is not only the result of the dialectics of progress, but also the consequence of a relatively restrained use of antenatal diagnostics. In addition, the Netherlands is among the European countries scoring highest on a number of important risk factors. This article examines the effect on perinatal mortality rates of known risk factors, in particular the presence of non-western foreigners, multiple births and older mothers. With respect to the latter factor, it is concluded that children of older mothers run a significantly higher risk of <b>foetal</b> <b>mortality,</b> whereas babies of young mothers (including women in their early twenties) run a higher risk of infant mortality. For babies of non-western mothers, infant mortality rates are higher, although there are substantial differences between ethnic backgrounds. First week mortality is most unfavourable for Surinamese and Antillean/Aruban children, and post-neonatal mortality is highest among Turkish and Moroccan babies. The fact that relatively many non-western foreigners from countries with relatively high risks of perinatal mortality have settled in the Netherlands, {{is one of the reasons}} for the fall in the international ranking. Lastly, the increase in the number of multiple births has been stronger in the Netherlands than in most other countries. The higher incidence of assisted reproduction explains most of this increase. ethnicity, <b>foetal</b> <b>mortality,</b> infant and child mortality, mortality, multiple births, neonatal mortality, perinatal mortality, Peristat, risk factors...|$|E
40|$|Aims To {{describe}} {{the outcome of}} pregnancy in patients with structural or ischaemic heart disease. Methods and results In 2007, the European Registry on Pregnancy and Heart disease was initiated by the European Society of Cardiology. Consecutive patients with valvular heart disease, congenital heart disease, ischaemic heart disease (IHD), or cardiomyopathy (CMP) presenting with pregnancy were enrolled. Data for the normal population were derived from the literature. Sixty hospitals in 28 countries enrolled 1321 pregnant women between 2007 and 2011. Median maternal age was 30 years (range 16 - 53). Most patients were in NYHA class I (72 %). Congenital heart disease (66 %) was most prevalent, followed by valvular heart disease 25 %, CMP 7 %, and IHD in 2 %. Maternal death occurred in 1 %, compared with 0. 007 % in the normal population. Highest maternal mortality was found in patients with CMP. During pregnancy, 338 patients (26 %) were hospitalized, 133 for heart failure. Caesarean section was performed in 41 %. <b>Foetal</b> <b>mortality</b> occurred in 1. 7 % and neonatal mortality in 0. 6 %, both {{higher than in the}} normal population. Median duration of pregnancy was 38 weeks (range 24 - 42) and median birth weight 3010 g (range 300 - 4850). In centres of developing countries, maternal and <b>foetal</b> <b>mortality</b> was higher than in centres of developed countries (3. 9 vs. 0. 6 %, P < 0. 001 and 6. 5 vs. 0. 9 % P < 0. 001) Conclusion The vast majority of patients can go safely through pregnancy and delivery as long as adequate pre-pregnancy evaluation and specialized high-quality care during pregnancy and delivery are available. Pregnancy outcomes were markedly worse in patients with CMP and in developing countries...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION Spontaneous rupture of utero-ovarian vessels {{is a rare}} {{cause of}} haemoperitoneum in pregnancy, leading to {{significant}} maternal and <b>foetal</b> morbidity and <b>mortality.</b> Aetiopathogenesis of this condition is still unclear. Establishing clinical diagnosis of this condition is difficult, but very important. Clinical symptoms are nonspecific, and the diagnosis is usually made at laparotomy. CASE OUTLINE We report a case of spontaneous haematoperitoneum in the third trimester of twin pregnancy. Differential diagnosis included uterine rupture and placental abruption. Due to the deteriorated condition of the patient, {{it was decided to}} perform laparotomy which established the diagnosis of ruptured venous varices on the posterior uterine wall. Delivery was performed by caesarean section. The postoperative period was uneventful. CONCLUSION The clinical presentation of spontaneous rupture of utero-ovarian blood vessels is not specific and clinical examination and ultrasonographic scanning may be insufficient for diagnosis. Once the diagnosis of spontaneous haematoperitoneum in pregnancy is established, emergency laparotomy is indicated. Following caesarean delivery, it is necessary to establish surgical haemostasis. There are some authors who suggest leaving the pregnancy intact in cases when the fetus is not viable, although one must have in mind the possibility of recurrent bleeding. The safety of this procedure requires further investigation. It is necessary to have in mind the possibility of blood vessel rupture in all cases of abdominal pain and hypotension of unknown origin during pregnancy...|$|R
40|$|Aims To {{investigate}} {{magnitude and}} determinants of risks during pregnancy {{in women with}} Mustard or Senning repair for complete transposition of the great arteries (TGA). Methods and results Using a nationwide registry (CONCOR), 70 women with Senning (23 %) or Mustard (77 %) repair for TGA were enrolled. A total of 28 patients had 69 pregnancies (two twins), including 17 spontaneous miscarriages and three elective abortions. During 39 of the 49 completed pregnancies, complications were observed. The most important cardiac complication was clinically significant arrhythmia (n= 11, 22 %), especially occurring in patients with a prior history of arrhythmia. Important general pregnancy complications were preeclampsia (n= 5, 10. 2 %) and pregnancy-induced hypertension (n= 4, 8. 2 %). Obstetric complications included premature rupture of membranes (n= 7, 14. 3 %), premature labour (n= 12, 24. 4 %), premature delivery (n= 16, 31. 4 %), and thrombo-embolic complications (n= 2, 4. 1 %). Mean (singleton) pregnancy duration was 36 +/- 5 weeks. Eleven of the 51 children (21. 6 %) were small for gestational age. <b>Foetal</b> and neonatal <b>mortality</b> combined was 11. 8 % (n= 6). No recurrence of congenital heart disease in the offspring was documented. Conclusion In this largest report on pregnancy in women with atrial-corrected TGA to date, {{a high incidence of}} obstetric complications and mortality in the offspring was observe...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Congenital {{complete}} atrioventricular block (CCAVB) is a rare potentially lethal {{disease with}} an estimated incidence of 1 every 15. 000 to 20. 000 live born infants. In structurally normal hearts two kinds of congenital heart block can be identified: one usually diagnosed in utero associated with the circulating maternal anti-SS-A/Ro and anti-SS-B/La antibodies, the other kind is detected later in the neonatal period or during the infancy or childhood and present no clear relation with maternal antibodies. Nowadays, the diagnosis {{can be made in}} utero as early as between week 16 and 28 of gestation by <b>foetal</b> echocardiography. The <b>mortality</b> in isolated CCAVB is estimated between 8 and 16 % and between 4 and 8 % in children and adults. The mortality and morbidity of patients diagnosed outside the neonatal period is significantly lower than those with a in utero diagnosis. Risk factors for worse outcome in CCAVB are the foetal diagnosis, the presence of hydrops fetalis, delivery at 32 weeks gestation, and a ventricular rate < 55 beats/min in early pregnancy (13, 18). Aim of this review is to delineate the current knowledge on CCAVB presenting in children without structural heart disease including aetiology, outcome and management. Also outlined in this review are some of the problems still debated in this issue. (Heart International 2006; 2 : 1 - 5...|$|R
