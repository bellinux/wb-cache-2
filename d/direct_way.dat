5|$|Jharokha Darshan was a daily {{practice}} {{of addressing the}} public audience (darshan) at the balcony (jharokha) at the forts and palaces of medieval kings in India. It was an essential and <b>direct</b> <b>way</b> of communicating face-to-face with the public, and was a practice which {{was adopted by the}} Mughal emperors. The balcony appearance in the name of Jharokha Darshan also spelled jharokha-i darshan was adopted by the 16th-century Mughal Emperor Akbar, even though it was contrary to Islamic injunctions. Earlier, Akbar's father Emperor Humayun had also adopted this Hindu {{practice of}} appearing before his subjects at the jharokha to hear their public grievances.|$|E
5|$|Orson Welles' stage {{production}} of Macbeth sets the play in Haiti, and casts the witches as voodoo priestesses. As with earlier versions, {{the women are}} bystanders {{to the murder of}} Banquo, as well as Lady Macbeth's sleepwalking scene. Their role in each of these scenes suggests they were behind Macbeth's fall in a more <b>direct</b> <b>way</b> than Shakespeare's original portrays. The witches encroach further and further into his domain as the play progresses, appearing in the forest in the first scene and in the castle itself by the end. Directors often have difficulty keeping the witches from being exaggerated and overly-sensational.|$|E
5|$|Blood free {{thyroxine}} and TSH {{levels are}} monitored {{to help determine}} whether the dose is adequate. This is done 4–8 weeks {{after the start of}} treatment or a change in levothyroxine dose. Once the adequate replacement dose has been established, the tests can be repeated after 6 and then 12 months, unless there is a change in symptoms. In people with central/secondary hypothyroidism, TSH is not a reliable marker of hormone replacement and decisions are based mainly on the free T4 level. Levothyroxine is best taken 30–60 minutes before breakfast, or four hours after food, as certain substances such as food and calcium can inhibit the absorption of levothyroxine. There is no <b>direct</b> <b>way</b> of increasing thyroid hormone secretion by the thyroid gland.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop and test a model which could be used to {{interpret}} and assist teaching in an environmentally <b>directed</b> <b>way.</b> Its principal aim was to establish the extent to which elements from a variety of paradigms and teaching methods could be used simultaneously when teaching in an environmentally <b>directed</b> <b>way,</b> depending on the topic and the context within which is taught. An in-depth literature review on theoretical perspectives on environmental education, paradigms relating to environmental education and teaching methods appropriate for environmental education indicated that these partially addressed the problem of the study, namely to determine how elements from a variety of paradigms and teaching methods could be used simultaneously to teach in an environmentally <b>directed</b> <b>way.</b> The theory developed from the literature review facilitated the development of the model mentioned above. An amoeba was used as a metaphor to develop a model which can help facilitate the process of teaching in an environmentally <b>directed</b> <b>way.</b> In developing the model, some examples of influential paradigms and teaching methods were used. None of the examples used for the study converged. Each contributed to the research in its own way. Some teaching methods showed common features of conversion and also addressed the problem of the study in their own ways. The amoeba model was developed from this theory. Qualitative research was further conducted to test the amoeba model. People who are knowledgeable in environmental education were selected to participate in the research. It emerged, from the findings of the research, that the amoeba model concurs positively with the hypothesis that no specific paradigm and teaching method(s) could be regarded as exclusively ideal for teaching in an environmentally <b>directed</b> <b>way.</b> Elements from a variety of paradigms and teaching methods could be used simultaneously for teaching in an environmentally <b>directed</b> <b>way,</b> depending on the topic and the context within which a topic is taught. The amoeba model thus serves as a solution to the problem of the study. Respondents further suggested that the amoeba model should be adopted for use in the South African education system. That is, the thesis should be put in the form of a workbook and teachers should be trained to teach in an environmentally <b>directed</b> <b>way</b> by using this model. Educational StudiesD. Ed.

5|$|Gene {{silencing}} aims {{to reduce}} {{the production of the}} mutant protein, since HD is caused by a single dominant gene encoding a toxic protein. Gene silencing experiments in mouse models have shown that when the expression of mHTT is reduced, symptoms improve. Safety of non-allele specific RNAi and ASO gene silencing has now been demonstrated in mice and the large, human-like brains of primates. Allele-specific silencing attempts to silence mutant HTT while leaving wild-type HTT untouched. One way of accomplishing this is to identify polymorphisms present on only one allele and produce gene silencing drugs that target polymorphisms in only the mutant allele. The first 'gene silencing' trial involving human HD patients began in 2015, testing the safety of IONIS-HTTRx, produced by Ionis Pharmaceuticals and led by UCL Institute of Neurology. Mutant huntingtin was detected and quantified {{for the first time in}} cerebrospinal fluid from Huntington's disease mutation-carriers in 2015 using a novel 'single-molecule counting' immunoassay, providing a <b>direct</b> <b>way</b> to assess whether huntingtin-lowering treatments are achieving the desired effect. Similarly, gene splicing techniques are being looked at to try to repair a genome with the erroneous gene that causes HD, using tools such as CRISPR/Cas9.|$|E

They were also the first band in the United States to publicly utilize the term Afro-Cuban as the band's moniker, thus identifying itself and acknowledging the West African roots of the musical form they were playing.
