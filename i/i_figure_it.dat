2500|$|Wills {{recalled}} {{the early days}} of what became known as Western swing music in a 1949 interview. [...] "Here's the way <b>I</b> <b>figure</b> <b>it.</b> We sure not tryin' to take credit for swingin' it." [...] Speaking of Milt Brown and himself working with songs done by Jimmie Davis, the Skillet Lickers, Jimmie Rodgers, and others, and songs he'd learned from his father, he said that [...] "We'd pull these tunes down an set 'em in a dance category. It wouldn't be a runaway, and just lay a real nice beat behind it an the people would get to really like it. It was nobody intended to start anything in the world. We was just tryin' to find enough tunes to keep 'em dancin' to not have to repeat so much." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "So <b>I</b> <b>figure</b> <b>it.</b> But {{there is}} no {{druggist}} named Schlemp here," [...] went on Tom, [...] "and the druggist here doesn't know of such a fellow." ...|$|E
5000|$|Bunn's playing was [...] "predominantly melodic {{rather than}} chordal". He {{did not use}} a pick; he used [...] "mostly my thumb, that's how <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> <b>it</b> when <b>I</b> first had that first guitar." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{could see}} a small speck drift astern of here, and <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> <b>it</b> was the {{lifeboat}} with her people. Then she came charging in belching flames, sparks and smoke like a volcano." ...|$|R
60|$|As <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> <b>it,</b> out of {{a hundred}} chances we had {{no more than one}} of getting into the fort, and there {{remained}} ninety and nine in favor of our falling victims to Brant's crew.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I don't know. Way <b>I</b> <b>figure</b> <b>it,</b> Myra, {{no sense}} {{suggesting}} {{a lot of}} Things to a boy's mind. Think up enough devilment by himself. But I wonder--It's kind of a hard question. Wonder what Littlefield thinks about it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I yielded {{up a small}} loaf and {{encouraged}} him as best I could: [...] "As <b>I</b> <b>figure</b> <b>it,</b> we are within thirty-five miles of Telegraph Creek; I've kept a careful diary of our travel. If we've passed over the Dease Lake Trail, which is probably about four hundred miles from Hazleton to Glenora, we must be now within thirty-five miles of Telegraph Creek." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We've got fifty cases below," [...] he said, [...] "and as <b>I</b> <b>figure</b> <b>it,</b> {{three cases}} buy a hundred {{thousand}} dollars. There was only a million dollars buried, so thirty cases ought to get it. Though, of course, we've got to allow a margin for the silver and the pennies. That Ecuadoran bunch must have salted down all the coin in sight." ...|$|E
2500|$|... “I {{always knew}} {{in my heart}} one day'that my work would find its way,'I could not tell you how,'there {{was no one there}} for me to show the way'but <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> <b>it</b> out.'I <b>figured</b> <b>it</b> all through for all of you to see today.”~Ellie Manette ...|$|R
5000|$|And, [...] "Stopping is the key; {{you have}} to know when to stop. If I feel so glad that a {{sculpture}} is here, and I don’t care who did <b>it,</b> then <b>I</b> <b>figure</b> <b>it's</b> a good piece." ...|$|R
5000|$|When {{the show}} was number three, <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> <b>it</b> was our acting. When {{it got to be}} number one, I decided it could only be because none of us wears a bra. Farrah Fawcett-Majors on Charlie's Angels ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Puts through {{mine and}} sawmill deals," [...] {{said one of}} the men. [...] "I'd light out for Johnston Lake right away, and if you have the dollars take the cars. Atlantic express is late to-night, waiting the Empress boat, and if you get off at Chumas, you'll only have 'bout twelve leagues to walk. <b>I</b> <b>figure</b> <b>it</b> will cost you four dollars." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, I'll tell you," [...] said Vergil Gunch; [...] "way <b>I</b> <b>figure</b> <b>it</b> is this, and I {{can speak}} by the book, because I've {{talked to a}} lot of doctors and fellows that ought to know, and the way I see it is that it's a good thing to get rid of the saloon, but they ought to let a fellow have beer and light wines." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Billy, {{just wait}} till I get the license renood, and I'll close up this damn caff so tight they'll {{never know what}} hit her. What did that lamb cost? Fifty cents a pound, was it? <b>I</b> <b>figure</b> <b>it,</b> Billy, {{that every one of}} them hogs eats about a dollar's worth a grub for every twenty-five cents they pay on it. As for Alf--by gosh, I'm through with him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I believe so. That’s partly why I’m going. Until I {{read the}} papers this morning I thought I’d stay away. <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> <b>it</b> might be better to let the boy worry through alone {{and see what he}} could make of it.” ...|$|R
5000|$|... "As {{slavery was}} already dead by the bullet, <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> <b>it</b> {{would be better to}} stop the bloodshed," [...] he told a crowd seven years later. That mattered more than [...] "the mere empty, {{abstract}} ceremonial of burying the dead corpse of slavery." ...|$|R
5000|$|... {{attempted}} {{to fool the}} voters by masking the stench of his liberalism, using President Bush and the uniform of the military as a deodorant... I voted for the tax-raising Schmidt but had to hold my nose to do <b>it.</b> <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> <b>it</b> was the lesser of the two evils.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I--Remember {{one time}} you called us 'the Babbitt men' {{and said we}} ought to stick together? I want to. I don't pretend to think this isn't serious. The way the cards are stacked against a young fellow to-day, I can't say I approve of early marriages. But you couldn't have married a better girl than Eunice; and way <b>I</b> <b>figure</b> <b>it,</b> Littlefield is darn lucky to get a Babbitt for a son-in-law! But what {{do you plan to}} do? Course you could go right ahead with the U., and when you'd finished--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, that's your business, I suppose. But I can't {{get away}} with it. Besides that--way <b>I</b> <b>figure</b> <b>it,</b> this illicit love-making is the one game that you always lose at. If you do lose, you feel foolish; and if you win, {{as soon as you}} find out how little it is that you've been scheming for, why then you lose worse than ever. Nature {{stinging}} us, as usual. But at that, I guess a lot of wives in this burg would be surprised if they knew everything that goes on behind their backs, eh, Nattie?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know that}} I can {{condense}} what I have to say," [...] he answered airily, addressing Thurston. [...] "Fact is, {{in the first}} place, and before Mr. Leslie asks a question, I {{want to know whether}} we--that is I--can still come to terms with you. It's tolerably well-known that my colleagues are, so to speak, men of straw, and individually <b>I</b> <b>figure</b> <b>it</b> might be better for both of us if we patched up a compromise. I can't sketch out the rest of my programme in the open air, but, as a general idea, what do you think, Mr. Savine?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How did I know he {{was from}} New York? Well, <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> <b>it</b> {{out as soon as}} he sprung them two words on me. I was in New York myself a couple of years ago, and I noticed some of the earmarks and hoof tracks of the Rancho Manhattan." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "At first, I didn't {{think much}} of [...] "Maggie May." [...] I guess that's because the record company didn't believe in the song. I didn't have much {{confidence}} then. <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> <b>it</b> was best {{to listen to the}} guys who knew better. What I learned is sometimes they do and sometimes they don't." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2008, the visitors' {{locker room}} was officially named [...] "The Fail Room" [...] after alumnus and donor James M. Fail. He commented, [...] "Earlier this year, when I saw the visitors' locker room as a {{potential}} naming right, <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> <b>it</b> was the most appropriate opportunity I would ever have to use my name." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's just as {{well you}} didn't run often into Mary. Joe's sick over her. I never saw a girl with a face and form to equal hers. There's danger here for any man, Shefford. Even for you who think you've turned your back on the world! Any of these Mormon women may {{fall in love with}} you. They CAN'T love their husbands. That's how <b>I</b> <b>figure</b> <b>it.</b> Religion holds them, not love. And the {{peculiar}} thing is this: they're second, third, or fourth wives, all sealed. That means their husbands are old, have picked them out for youth and physical charms, have chosen the very opposite to their first wives, and then have hidden them here in this lonely hole.... Did you ever imagine so terrible a thing?" ...|$|E
6000|$|For {{the first}} time Berrie showed signs of {{weakness}} and distress. [...] "Why, you see, Alec Belden and Mr. Moore were over there {{to look at some}} timber, and old Marm Belden and that Moore girl went along. I suppose they sent word to Cliff, and I presume that Moore girl put him on our trail. Leastwise that's the way <b>I</b> <b>figure</b> <b>it</b> out. That's the worst of the whole business." [...] She admitted this with darkened brow. [...] "Mrs. Belden's tongue is hung in the middle and loose at both ends--and that Moore girl is spiteful mean." [...] She could not keep the contempt out of her voice. [...] "She saw us start off, and she is sure to follow it up and find out what happened on the way home; even if they don't see Cliff they'll talk." ...|$|E
60|$|One figures one of {{the more}} urban highways, one of those along which the light {{railways}} of the second order run, such as that in the valley of Urseren, into which we should presently come. <b>I</b> <b>figure</b> <b>it</b> as one would see it at night, a band a hundred yards perhaps in width, the footpath on either side shaded with high trees and lit softly with orange glowlights; while down the centre the tramway of the road will go, with sometimes a nocturnal tram-car gliding, lit and gay but almost noiselessly, past. Lantern-lit cyclists will flit along the track like fireflies, and ever and again some humming motor-car will hurry by, to or from the Rhoneland or the Rhineland or Switzerland or Italy. Away on either side the lights of the little country homes up the mountain slopes will glow.|$|E
6000|$|This {{is the way}} {{we worked}} our scheme. First, <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> <b>it</b> out by a kind of a proverb. The best grafts in the world are built up on copy-book maxims and psalms and proverbs and Esau's fables. They seem to kind of hit off human nature. Our {{peaceful}} little swindle was constructed on the old saying: [...] "The whole push loves a lover." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Finding {{that our}} {{correspondence}} was using up {{no end of}} time and ink, <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> <b>it</b> {{would be better for}} us to talk things over together comfortably, and as some of you come from Vancouver, and some from round the lake, this place appeared a convenient center," [...] began Savine. [...] "Now, gentlemen, I'm ready to discuss either business or anything else you like." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "It had {{mine and}} Ian Hunter's lyrics originally. But {{in the end}} Bob looked through it and re-did the whole song. I put some stuff into the song that anybody can relate to. It has good ground, because it's one of the facts of life. There's always things you can't have. But <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> <b>it</b> also {{has a kind of}} humorous side to it. Laughter through tears. It's kinda bitter sweet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I guess {{maybe she}} does belong in it. From all I can hear she's in {{everything}} and behind everything {{that looks like}} a reform--lot more than most folks realize. She lets Mrs. Reverend Warren, the president of this-here Thanatopsis Club, think she's running the works, but Miss Sherwin is the secret boss, and nags all the easy-going dames into doing something. But way <b>I</b> <b>figure</b> <b>it</b> out----You see, I'm not interested in these dinky reforms. Miss Sherwin's trying to repair the holes in this barnacle-covered ship of a town by keeping busy bailing out the water. And Pollock tries to repair it by reading poetry to the crew! Me, I want to yank it up on the ways, and fire the poor bum of a shoemaker that built it so it sails crooked, and have it rebuilt right, from the keel up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm educating {{my girls}} to be {{energetic}} and self-reliant. I {{want to bring}} out and develop every spark of latent ability there is in them. Whether the Millville Tribune succeeds or fails is not important; it will at least keep them busy for a time, along new lines, and tax their best resources of intellect and business ability. In other words, this experience is bound to do 'em good, {{and in that way}} <b>I</b> <b>figure</b> <b>it</b> will be worth all it costs--and more. I like the originality of the idea; I'm pleased with the difficulties I see looming ahead; I'm quite sure my girls will rise to every occasion and prove their grit." [...] He paused to knock the ashes from his pipe. [...] "I'm worth a lot of money, Arthur," [...] he continued, meekly, [...] "and some day these three girls will inherit immense fortunes. It is my duty to train them in all practical business ways {{to take care of their}} property." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not begun. All that's {{happened}} {{so far is}} through our not having the sense to keep quiet--worrying them with guns and such foolery. And losing our heads, and rushing off in crowds to where there wasn't any more safety than where we were. They don't want to bother us yet. They're making their things--making {{all the things they}} couldn't bring with them, getting things ready {{for the rest of their}} people. Very likely that's why the cylinders have stopped for a bit, for fear of hitting those who are here. And instead of our rushing about blind, on the howl, or getting dynamite on the chance of busting them up, we've got to fix ourselves up according to the new state of affairs. That's how <b>I</b> <b>figure</b> <b>it</b> out. It isn't quite according to what a man wants for his species, but it's about what the facts point to. And that's the principle I acted upon. Cities, nations, civilisation, progress--it's all over. That game's up. We're beat." ...|$|E
5000|$|Asked in June 2013 by The Guardian {{to comment}} on the early revelations about phone data {{collection}} by the NSA, Tice said: [...] "What is going on is much larger and more systemic than anything anyone has ever suspected or imagined ... <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> <b>it</b> would probably be about 2015 the NSA had the computer capacity ... to collect all digital communications word for word ... But I think I'm wrong. I think they have it right now." ...|$|R
5000|$|Born in Richmond, California, Bradley first {{picked up}} the trumpet at age 13 while {{attending}} Portola Junior High School.He initially wanted to play the drums,but couldn't because his school band already had three drummers. He then decided to play the trumpet because [...] "I knew it only had three valves so <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> <b>it</b> (the trumpet) was simplistic enough and {{would be easy to}} pick up...it's one of the hardest instruments to play." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did. So far as <b>I</b> can <b>figure,</b> <b>it's</b> a {{mine that}} will make its living, and nothing worth while more. 'Bout two or three cents on the dollar." ...|$|R
