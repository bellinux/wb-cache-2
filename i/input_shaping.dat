50|$|<b>Input</b> <b>Shaping</b> is an {{open-loop}} control technique for reducing vibrations in computer-controlled machines. The method works {{by creating a}} command signal that cancels its own vibration. That is, vibration caused by {{the first part of}} the command signal is cancelled by vibration caused by the second part of the command. <b>Input</b> <b>shaping</b> is implemented by convolving a sequence of impulses, an input shaper, with any desired command. The shaped command that results from the convolution is then used to drive the system. If the impulses in the shaper are chosen correctly, then the system will respond without vibration to any unshaped command. The amplitudes and time locations of the impulses are obtained from the system's natural frequencies and damping ratios. Shaping can be made very robust to errors in the system parameters.|$|E

40|$|Image {{appearance}} cues {{are often}} used to derive object shapes, which is usually {{one of the key}} steps of image understanding tasks. However, when image appearance cues are weak or misleading, shape priors become critical to infer and refine the shape derived by these appearance cues. Effective modeling of shape priors is challenging because: 1) shape variation is complex and cannot always be modeled by a parametric probability distribution; 2) a shape instance derived from image appearance cues (<b>input</b> <b>shape)</b> may have gross errors; and 3) local details of the <b>input</b> <b>shape</b> are difficult to preserve if they are not statistically significant in the training data. In this paper we propose a novel Sparse Shape Composition model (SSC) to deal with these three challenges in a unified framework. In our method, training shapes are adaptively composed to infer/refine an <b>input</b> <b>shape.</b> The a-priori information is thus implicitly incorporated on-the-fly. Our model leverages two sparsity observations of the <b>input</b> <b>shape</b> instance: 1) the <b>input</b> <b>shape</b> can be approximately represented by a sparse linear combination of training shapes; 2) parts of the <b>input</b> <b>shape</b> may contain gross errors but such errors are usually sparse. Using L 1 norm relaxation, our model is formulated as a convex optimization problem, which is solved by an efficient alternating minimization framework. Our method is extensively validated on two real world medical applications, 2 D lung localization in X-ray images and 3 D liver segmentation in low-dose CT scans. Compared to state-ofthe-art methods, our model exhibits better performance in both studies. 1...|$|R

The cost function is the residual energy, a quadratic {{function of the}} amplitude of the shaped profile, for each sampling interval. The Schur complement permits representing the quadratic function as a Linear Matrix Inequality. Augmenting the state space model with {{the sensitivity of the}} states to uncertain parameters, <b>input</b> <b>shaped</b> profiles which are robust to model uncertainties can be derived.

40|$|<b>Input</b> <b>shaping</b> and Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) {{feedback}} control are simple, easy-to-implement and generally low cost control strategies. Considering this, {{it is remarkable}} that they are also very effective control techniques. In fact, a majority of the world's {{feedback control}}lers utilize PID (or the subset PD) control. In addition, <b>input</b> <b>shaping</b> has seen significant use on real-world machines such as cranes, micro-mills, coordinate measuring machines, computer disc drive manufacturing machines, spacecraft, etc. However, despite similarities in effectiveness and ease of implementation, <b>input</b> <b>shaping</b> and PID feedback control are fundamentally different strategies. <b>Input</b> <b>shaping</b> is an anticipatory control scheme capable of enabling quick, low-vibration motions. PID feedback control is reactive in nature, and it is primarily required to deal with problems such as modeling errors, disturbances and nonlinearities. Of course, PID control is also used to reduce vibrations (as in the case of <b>input</b> <b>shaping).</b> But, because it is a reactive controller, it is slower than <b>input</b> <b>shaping</b> at eliminating motion-induced vibration. Given their effectiveness and practicality, as well as the fact that they address important and complimentary control issues, it would be advantageous to combine these two control strategies. The result would still be practical and effective, yet would now address a range of system phenomenon beyond that which is capable by either of the individual control techniques. However, there is a definite gap in the state-of-the-art technology for combining these techniques. For example, little research has addressed the intelligent combination of traditional, outside-the-loop <b>input</b> <b>shaping</b> and PID feedback control. In addition, only a few researchers have attempted to place <b>input</b> <b>shaping</b> filters within feedback loops. This research studies the intelligent combination of <b>input</b> <b>shaping</b> and PID feedback control by developing a concurrent design procedure for outside-the-loop input shaping/PID feedback combinations and by analyzing the effect of placing <b>input</b> <b>shaping</b> filters within feedback loops.

40|$|<b>Input</b> <b>shaping</b> {{technique}} {{is widely used}} in reducing or eliminating residual vibration of flexible structures. The exact elimination of the residual vibration via <b>input</b> <b>shaping</b> technique depends on the amplitudes and instants of impulse application.

In this paper, a closed-loop <b>input</b> <b>shaping</b> control scheme is developed for uncertain flexible structures. The algorithm is based on <b>input</b> <b>shaping</b> control and adaptive sliding mode control.

This scheme guarantees closed-loop system stability, and yields good performance and robustness in the presence of parameter uncertainties and external disturbances as well. Furthermore, it is shown that increasing the robustness to parameter uncertainties does not lengthen the duration of the impulse sequence.

40|$|Abstract. Concepts from {{elasticity}} {{are applied}} to analyze modes of variation on shapes in two and three dimensions. This approach represents a physically motivated alternative to shape statistics on a Riemannian shape space, and it robustly treats strong nonlinear geometric variations of the <b>input</b> <b>shapes.</b> To compute a <b>shape</b> average, all <b>input</b> <b>shapes</b> are elastically deformed into the same configuration. That configuration which minimizes the total elastic deformation energy {{is defined as the}} average shape. Each of the deformations from one of the shapes onto the shape average induces a boundary stress. Small amplitude stimulation of these stresses leads to displacements which reflect the impact of every single <b>input</b> <b>shape</b> on the average. To extract the dominant modes of variation, a PCA is performed on this set of displacements. To make the approach computationally tractable, a relaxed formulation is proposed, and sharp contours are approximated via phase fields. For the spatial discretization of the resulting model, piecewise multilinear finite elements are applied. Applications in 2 D and in 3 D demonstrate the qualitative properties of the presented approach. ...|$|R
