5|$|In 1500 polymath Leonardo da Vinci {{provides}} the first {{illustration of the}} thyroid. In 1543 Anatomist Andreas Vesalius gave the first anatomic description and illustration of the <b>gland.</b> In 1656 the thyroid received its name, by the anatomist Thomas Wharton. The <b>gland</b> was named thyroid, meaning shield, as its shape resembled the shields commonly used in Ancient Greece. The English name thyroid <b>gland</b> {{is derived from the}} medical Latin used by Wharton – glandula thyreoidea. Glandula means <b>gland</b> in Latin, and thyreoidea {{can be traced back to}} the Ancient Greek word θυρεοειδής, meaning shield-like/shield-shaped.|$|E
5|$|The adrenal <b>gland</b> secretes {{a number}} of {{different}} hormones which are metabolised by enzymes either within the <b>gland</b> or {{in other parts of the}} body. These hormones are involved in {{a number of}} essential biological functions.|$|E
5|$|The painful stings of {{bees are}} mostly {{associated}} with the poison <b>gland</b> and the Dufour's <b>gland</b> which are abdominal exocrine glands containing various chemicals. In Lasioglossum leucozonium, the Dufour's <b>Gland</b> mostly contains octadecanolide {{as well as some}} eicosanolide. There is also evidence of n-triscosane, n-heptacosane, and 22-docosanolide. However, the secretions of these glands could also be used for nest construction.|$|E
50|$|This type {{of tissue}} can be {{observed}} in sweat <b>glands,</b> mammary <b>glands,</b> circumanal <b>glands,</b> and salivary <b>glands.</b> They protect areas such as the ducts of sweat <b>glands,</b> mammary <b>glands,</b> and salivary <b>glands.</b>|$|R
50|$|Specialized sweat <b>glands,</b> {{including}} the ceruminous <b>glands,</b> mammary <b>glands,</b> ciliary <b>glands</b> of the eyelids, and sweat <b>glands</b> {{of the nasal}} vestibulum, are modified apocrine <b>glands.</b> Ceruminous <b>glands</b> are near the ear canals, and produce cerumen (earwax) that mixes with the oil secreted from sebaceous <b>glands.</b> Mammary <b>glands</b> use apocrine secretion to produce milk.|$|R
50|$|The nasal <b>glands</b> are the seromucous <b>glands</b> in the {{respiratory}} {{region of the}} nasal mucous membrane. The three major types of nasal <b>glands</b> are anterior serous <b>glands,</b> seromucous <b>glands,</b> and Bowman <b>glands.</b>|$|R
5|$|Albatrosses, {{along with}} all Procellariiformes, must excrete the salts they ingest in {{drinking}} sea water and eating marine invertebrates. All birds have an enlarged nasal <b>gland</b> {{at the base of}} the bill, above their eyes. This <b>gland</b> is inactive in species that do not require it, but in the Procellariiformes it acts as a salt <b>gland.</b> Scientists are uncertain as to its exact processes, but do know in general terms that it removes salt by secreting a 5% saline solution that drips out of their nose or is forcibly ejected.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{the finding}} of a {{combination}} of a low pituitary hormone together with a low hormone from the effector <b>gland</b> is indicative of hypopituitarism. Occasionally, the pituitary hormone may be normal but the effector <b>gland</b> hormone decreased; in this case, the pituitary is not responding appropriately to effector hormone changes, and the combination of findings is still suggestive of hypopituitarism.|$|E
5|$|Hypothyroidism {{is caused}} by {{inadequate}} function of the <b>gland</b> itself (primary hypothyroidism), inadequate stimulation by thyroid-stimulating hormone from the pituitary <b>gland</b> (secondary hypothyroidism), or inadequate release of thyrotropin-releasing hormone from the brain's hypothalamus (tertiary hypothyroidism). Primary hypothyroidism is about a thousandfold more common than central hypothyroidism.|$|E
40|$|The {{histological}} {{study of}} the exocrine <b>glands</b> in the swarming females showed the presence of tergal <b>glands,</b> mandibular <b>glands,</b> salivary <b>glands</b> and sternal <b>glands.</b> Tergal and sternal <b>glands</b> are not developed in the physogastric queens, probably, because of a regression process. The development of mandibular <b>glands</b> is similar in swarming females and physogastric queens...|$|R
50|$|Exocrine <b>glands</b> {{are named}} apocrine <b>glands,</b> holocrine <b>glands,</b> or merocrine <b>glands</b> {{based on how}} their {{products}} are excreted.|$|R
50|$|If <b>glands</b> are {{categorized}} by shape, tubular <b>glands</b> contrast with alveolar <b>glands.</b> Tubular <b>glands</b> retain their shape as a tube throughout their length whereas alveolar <b>glands</b> have a saclike secretory portion.|$|R
5|$|Lymphatic {{drainage}} frequently {{passes the}} prelaryngeal lymph nodes (located {{just above the}} isthmus), and the pretracheal and paratracheal lymph nodes. The <b>gland</b> receives sympathetic nerve supply from the superior, middle and inferior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic trunk. The <b>gland</b> receives parasympathetic nerve supply from the superior laryngeal nerve and the recurrent laryngeal nerve.|$|E
5|$|Parathyroid glands {{are small}} {{endocrine}} glands {{in the neck}} of humans and other tetrapods that produce parathyroid hormone. Humans usually have four parathyroid glands, variably located {{on the back of}} the thyroid <b>gland.</b> Parathyroid hormone and calcitonin (one of the hormones made by the thyroid <b>gland)</b> have key roles in regulating the amount of calcium in the blood and within the bones.|$|E
5|$|Slow lorises {{can produce}} a {{secretion}} on their brachial <b>gland</b> (a <b>gland</b> on their arm) which when mixed with their saliva creates a volatile, noxious toxin that can be, if necessary, delivered in a bite to an aggressor. A bite causes a painful swelling and is slow to heal; the toxin is mild and not typically fatal, although an anaphylactic reaction is possible.|$|E
5000|$|Sebaceous <b>glands</b> secrete a lipid product. These <b>glands</b> {{are also}} known as oil <b>glands,</b> e.g. Fordyce spots and meibomian <b>glands.</b>|$|R
50|$|Ceruminous <b>glands</b> (which produce ear wax), mammary <b>glands</b> (which produce milk), and ciliary <b>glands</b> in the eyelids are {{modified}} apocrine sweat <b>glands.</b>|$|R
50|$|Two {{types of}} sweat <b>glands</b> {{can be found}} in humans: eccrine <b>glands</b> and apocrine <b>glands.</b> The eccrine sweat <b>glands</b> are {{distributed}} over much of the body.|$|R
5|$|The abdomen has no {{appendages}} {{except those}} that have been modified to form one to four (usually three) pairs of short, movable spinnerets, which emit silk. Each spinneret has many spigots, each of which is connected to one silk <b>gland.</b> There are at least six types of silk <b>gland,</b> each producing a different type of silk.|$|E
5|$|The {{arcuate nucleus}} and the periventricular {{nucleus of the}} {{hypothalamus}} have dopamine neurons that form an important projection—the tuberoinfundibular pathway which goes to the pituitary <b>gland,</b> where it influences the secretion of the hormone prolactin. Dopamine is the primary neuroendocrine inhibitor of the secretion of prolactin from the anterior pituitary <b>gland.</b> Dopamine produced by neurons in the arcuate nucleus is secreted into the hypophyseal portal system of the median eminence, which supplies the pituitary <b>gland.</b> The prolactin cells that produce prolactin, {{in the absence of}} dopamine, secrete prolactin continuously; dopamine inhibits this secretion. In the context of regulating prolactin secretion, dopamine is occasionally called prolactin-inhibiting factor, prolactin-inhibiting hormone, or prolactostatin.|$|E
5|$|The blood supply, {{drainage}}, and lymphatic drainage of the parathyroid glands {{correspond to}} the thyroid overlying <b>gland.</b>|$|E
50|$|Some human sweat <b>glands</b> {{cannot be}} {{classified}} as either apocrine or eccrine, having characteristics of both; such <b>glands</b> are termed apoeccrine. They are larger than eccrine <b>glands,</b> but smaller than apocrine <b>glands.</b> Their secretory portion has a narrow portion similar to secretory coils in eccrine <b>glands</b> {{as well as a}} wide section reminiscent of apocrine <b>glands.</b>|$|R
5|$|Sebaceous <b>glands</b> {{are also}} found in hairless areas (glabrous skin) of the eyelids, nose, penis, labia minora, the inner mucosal {{membrane}} of the cheek, and nipples. Some sebaceous <b>glands</b> have unique names. Sebaceous <b>glands</b> on the lip and mucosa of the cheek, and on the genitalia, are known as Fordyce spots, and <b>glands</b> on the eyelids are known as meibomian <b>glands.</b> Sebaceous <b>glands</b> of the breast are also known as Montgomery's <b>glands.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Mucous cells excrete mucus. Examples include Brunner's <b>glands,</b> esophageal <b>glands,</b> and pyloric <b>glands</b> ...|$|R
5|$|The {{decision}} on whether to surgically decompress the pituitary <b>gland</b> is complex and mainly dependent on the severity of visual loss and visual field defects. If visual acuity is severely reduced, there are large or worsening visual field defects, or the level of consciousness falls consistently, professional guidelines recommend that surgery is performed. Most commonly, operations on the pituitary <b>gland</b> are performed through transsphenoidal surgery. In this procedure, surgical instruments are passed through the nose towards the sphenoid bone, which is opened to give access to the cavity that contains the pituitary <b>gland.</b> Surgery is most likely to improve vision if there was some remaining vision before surgery, and if surgery is undertaken within a week of the onset of symptoms.|$|E
5|$|The normal {{function}} of the adrenal <b>gland</b> may be impaired by conditions such as infections, tumors, genetic disorders and autoimmune diseases, or as {{a side effect of}} medical therapy. These disorders affect the <b>gland</b> either directly (as with infections or autoimmune diseases) or {{as a result of the}} dysregulation of hormone production (as in some types of Cushing's syndrome) leading to an excess or insufficiency of adrenal hormones and the related symptoms.|$|E
5|$|The {{outermost}} {{zone of the}} {{adrenal cortex}} is the zona glomerulosa. It lies immediately under the fibrous capsule of the <b>gland.</b> Cells in this layer form oval groups, separated by thin strands of connective tissue from the fibrous capsule of the <b>gland</b> and carry wide capillaries.|$|E
50|$|The M3 receptors {{are also}} located in many <b>glands,</b> both {{endocrine}} and exocrine <b>glands,</b> {{and help to}} stimulate secretion in salivary <b>glands</b> and other <b>glands</b> of the body.|$|R
50|$|If <b>glands</b> are {{categorized}} by shape, alveolar <b>glands</b> contrast with tubular <b>glands.</b> Alveolar <b>glands</b> have a saclike secretory portion, thus are also termed saccular <b>glands.</b> They typically have an enlarged lumen (cavity), {{hence the name}} similar to alveoli, the smallest air sacs in the lungs.|$|R
50|$|<b>Glands</b> of Moll, {{also known}} as ciliary <b>glands,</b> are {{modified}} apocrine sweat <b>glands</b> that are found on {{the margin of the}} eyelid. They are next {{to the base of the}} eyelashes, and anterior to the Meibomian <b>glands</b> within the distal eyelid margin. These <b>glands</b> are relatively large and tubular-shaped. The <b>glands</b> of Moll are named after Dutch oculist Jacob Anton Moll (1832-1914).|$|R
5|$|The {{parathyroid}} glands are {{variable in}} number: {{three or more}} small glands, and can usually be located on the posterior surface of the thyroid <b>gland.</b> Occasionally, some individuals may have six, eight, or even more parathyroid glands. Rarely, the parathyroid glands may be within the thyroid <b>gland</b> itself, the chest, or even the thymus.|$|E
5|$|The thyroid <b>gland</b> is a butterfly-shaped organ {{that sits}} {{at the front of}} the neck. It is {{composed}} of two lobes, left and right, connected by a narrow isthmus. The thyroid weighs 25 grams in adults, with each lobe being about 5cm long, 3cm wide and 2cm thick, and the isthmus about 1.25cm in height and width. The <b>gland</b> is usually larger in women, and increases in size in pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|The thyroid <b>gland</b> is {{the only}} source of thyroid hormone in the body; the process {{requires}} iodine and the amino acid tyrosine. Iodine in the bloodstream is taken up by the <b>gland</b> and incorporated into thyroglobulin molecules. The process is controlled by the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH, thyrotropin), which is secreted by the pituitary. Not enough iodine, or not enough TSH, can result in decreased production of thyroid hormones.|$|E
40|$|Morphological, {{histological}} and histochemical {{investigations of}} the cephalic <b>glands</b> of Slevin's ground gecko Stenodactylus slevini Hass 1957 have been conducted. Infralabial, sublingual, lingual, palatine and Harderian <b>glands</b> were detected in S. slevini, but supralabial, Gobe and salt <b>glands</b> are absent. Serous cells {{were found in the}} infralabial and sublingual <b>glands,</b> seromucous cells in the sublingual and palatine <b>glands,</b> mucoserous cells in the Harderian <b>glands</b> and mucous cells in the lingual ones. Proteins were detected mainly in the infralabial, palatine and in the deeper parts of the sublingual <b>glands.</b> Neural mucosubstances were found in the lingual, superficial sublingual, palatine and Harderian glands; carboxylated mucosubstances in the lingual, sublingual and Harderian <b>glands</b> while sulphated mucosubstance occurred only in the lingual <b>glands</b> palatine and in the deeper parts of the sublingual <b>glands.</b> Neural mucosubstances were found in the lingual, superficial sublingual, palatine and Harderian glands; carboxylated mucosubstances in the lingual, sublingual and Harderian <b>glands</b> while sulphated mucosubstance occurred only in the lingual <b>glands...</b>|$|R
5000|$|The gastric <b>glands</b> {{are located}} in {{different}} regions of the stomach. These are the fundic <b>glands,</b> the cardiac <b>glands,</b> and the pyloric <b>glands.</b> The <b>glands</b> and gastric pits {{are located in}} the stomach lining. The <b>glands</b> themselves are in the lamina propria of the mucous membrane and they open into the bases of the gastric pits formed by the epithelium. [...] The various cells of the <b>glands</b> secrete mucus, pepsinogen, hydrochloric acid, intrinsic factor, gastrin, histamine and bicarbonate.|$|R
50|$|The saccate metanephridia are {{excretory}} <b>glands</b> which function {{similarly to}} the metanephridia. They {{are found in}} the arthropods: coxal <b>glands</b> of arachnids, antennal (or green) <b>glands</b> and maxillary <b>glands</b> of crustaceans, etc.|$|R
