25|$|At the 2009 Skate America, Kim placed first {{again after}} the short program with the score of 76.28, which was 17.48 points ahead of her closest {{competitor}} Rachael <b>Flatt.</b> She received +2.20 grade of execution for her triple lutz–triple toe loop combination, the highest ever given for jumps by the ISU in ladies' figure skating.

At the competition, she set a new world record again for the short program under the ISU Judging System.|$|E
25|$|In 1953, Martha White Foods {{sponsored}} the band's regular early morning radio shows on WSM in Nashville, where the duo sang the company's catchy bluegrass jingle written by Pat Twitty. About this time, country music television shows, on which <b>Flatt</b> and Scruggs appeared regularly, went into syndication, vastly increasing the group's exposure. Despite the groups increasing popularity and fan mail, WSM {{did not allow}} <b>Flatt</b> and Scruggs to become members of the Grand Ole Opry at first. According to Tennessean writer Peter Cooper, Bill Monroe was in opposition and worked {{behind the scenes to}} keep <b>Flatt</b> and Scruggs off the Opry to the extent of having petitions made against their membership. In 1955 Martha White Foods' CEO Cohen E. Williams intervened by threatening to pull all of his advertising from WSM unless the band appeared on the Opry in the segment sponsored by his company. As years went by, the band became synonymous with Martha White {{to the extent that the}} advertising jingle itself became a hit, and the band rarely played a concert without it. Fans shouted requests for them to play it, even at Carnegie Hall.|$|E

25|$|Buffett {{was born}} on December 25, 1946, in Pascagoula, Mississippi, and spent part of his {{childhood}} in Mobile, Alabama.

Buffett's grandfather was a sailor, therefore he was exposed to sailing as a child which had an early effect on his life and later in his music. He later lived in Fairhope, Alabama. He graduated from McGill Institute for Boys in 1964. He began playing guitar during his first year at Auburn University before continuing his college years at Pearl River Community College and the University of Southern Mississippi in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, where he received a bachelor's degree in history in 1969.

500|$|Gould {{appeared}} in Wales' three matches of the 1890 Home Nations Championship where he partnered Dickie Garrett, a coal tipper {{who played for}} Penarth, at centre. Gould lost the team captaincy for the first match to Frank Hill, a game which Wales lost to Scotland 5–1, though Gould did score his first international try. The game is also notable for featuring the first appearance of Billy Bancroft, the Swansea all-round sportsman who would take over the captaincy from Gould on his retirement. Bancroft was fullback in Gould's next 18 international games. Gould regained the captaincy for the next game, an encounter with England at Crown <b>Flatt</b> in Dewsbury, and from that point held the captaincy whenever he represented Wales. The encounter was an historic day for Wales, with the country's first win over England, a single try from Buller Stadden giving Wales the victory. The campaign ended in a disappointing away draw with Ireland, which saw the introduction of Tom Graham, a Newport forward who would become Gould's club captain during the 1891–92 [...] "invincible" [...] season.|$|E
2500|$|Neither <b>Flatt</b> nor Scruggs {{spoke to}} each other for the next ten years — until 1979 when <b>Flatt</b> was in the hospital. Scruggs made an unannounced visit to the bedside.

Scruggs {{answered}} yes, but told <b>Flatt</b> they would talk when he was better. [...] <b>Flatt</b> said, [...] "It came as quite a surprise and made me feel good". But Lester <b>Flatt</b> never recovered, and died May 11, 1979. [...] Historian Barry Willis, speaking of the meeting, said [...] "Earl gave Lester his flowers while he was still living".|$|E
