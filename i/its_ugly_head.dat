25|$|Going into 2007, Michigan {{had high}} expectations. Standout players Chad Henne, Mike Hart, and Jake Long all opted {{to return for}} their senior seasons for one last crack at Ohio State and {{a chance at a}} {{national}} championship, causing Michigan to be ranked fifth in the preseason polls. However, Michigan's struggles against the spread offense reared <b>its</b> <b>ugly</b> <b>head</b> again as the Wolverines shockingly lose the opener to the Appalachian State Mountaineers. The game marked the first win by a Division I-AA team over a team ranked in the Associated Press Poll. The next week, Michigan was blown out by Oregon, another spread team. Despite the early rough start, Michigan won their next eight games and went into the Ohio State game with a chance to win the Big Ten championship. However, Michigan once again fell to the Buckeyes, this time 14–3. After the game, Lloyd Carr announced that he would retire from Michigan after the bowl game. In the 2008 Capital One Bowl, Carr's final game, Michigan defeated the defending national champion Florida Gators, led by Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow, 41–35. Carr's accomplishments at Michigan included a 122–40 record, five Big Ten championships, and one national championship.|$|E

Robinson {{intended}} to study towards a medical degree but decided to major in American Studies. During his college days, Robinson began to seriously consider the ordained ministry and said it almost immediately felt right. During high school and then college, Robinson had been exploring philosophical and theological questions and has said, [...] "The Episcopal Church got a hold on me." [...] He graduated from Sewanee cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts degree in American studies in 1969 and attended seminary that fall. Robinson studied for a Master of Divinity degree from the Episcopal General Theological Seminary in New York City. While doing an intern year as a chaplain at the University of Vermont, he began dating his future wife, Isabella [...] "Boo" [...] Martin. Robinson says that about [...] "a month into their relationship, [...] explained his background and his fears about his sexuality." [...] They continued dating and, as Robinson puts it, [...] "about {{a month before the}} marriage, [...] became frightened that ... this thing would raise <b>its</b> <b>ugly</b> <b>head</b> some day, and cause her and me great pain." [...] Robinson and Martin discussed it and decided {{to go ahead with the}} marriage in 1972.|$|E

The two drivers walked out and argued to applause from the fans. Both of them were infuriated with one another, and shared some heated words after the crash. Murphy said [...] "He's got an ego problem that we all know about and it reared <b>its</b> <b>ugly</b> <b>head</b> again, and I'm just not going to put up with it".

5|$|The John Dory, {{though of}} uninviting appearance, is {{considered}} by some persons as the most delicious fish that appears at table; in the general estimation, however, it ranks next to the turbot, but it is far less abundant in our waters, and is not commonly to be procured of sufficient size for a handsome dish, except in some few parts of our coast which are celebrated for it. It may easily be known by its yellow gray colour, its one large dark spot on either side, the long filaments on the back, a general thickness of form, and <b>its</b> very <b>ugly</b> <b>head.</b> It is dressed in the same manner, and served usually with the same sauces as a turbot, but requires less time to boil it.

In 1935, he spoke to a combined meeting of the Zionist Organization of America (ZOA) and Hadassah, declaring that [...] "the solution {{of the problem of}} world Jewry lies in the rebuilding of the national Jewish homeland in Palestine." [...] He stated that [...] "World Jewry is now wrestling with a complexity of major problems, such as the combating of anti-Semitism which is rearing <b>its</b> <b>ugly</b> <b>head</b> in various lands; finding a refuge for the persecuted and exiled Jews of Germany; widening the ever-narrowing channels of economic opportunities for Jews; and preserving and transmitting the spiritual heritage of the Jewish people.

Any method which has such an openly qualiquantological heritage (see Stenner and Stainton Rogers (2004) for a fuller explanation of this disgraceful neologism) risks being singled out and victimized. This is, after all, a method which {{has its roots in}} the psychological laboratories of Charles Spearman and Cyril Burt – laboratories which throughout the 1920 s and 1930 s were responsible for the invention and refinement of the psychometric techniques that still characterize the discipline today (often to the detriment of qualitative techniques).

60|$|And well he might, for at {{that moment}} an {{enormous}} crocodile, which had evidently been watching the water-buck, seized and dragged it into the water. It was not deep, however, and the wounded animal made a desperate plunge, hauled the crocodile several yards, and tore itself out of its hideous jaws. It then jumped into the stream and was swimming across when another crocodile made a dash at it, but Harold sent a ball into <b>its</b> <b>ugly</b> <b>head,</b> which appeared to make it change its mind.

At the same moment Adolay, who sat close to her, grasped her paddle like a double-handed sword, and brought it down with surprising force on the creature's left eye. A shot from the fire-spouter followed; the ball entered the same eye, reached the brain, and the young bull sank to rise no more.|$|E
