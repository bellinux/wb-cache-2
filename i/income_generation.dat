With {{the purpose}} to {{understand}} the farmers' practices and strategies for ruminants supplementation, mixed crop-livestock farms have been surveyed in three agro-ecological zones of Burkina Faso. The results obtained indicated that lactating females' supplementation is almost permanent whatever be {{the period of the}} year, but the objectives vary according to the seasons. In general, animal supplementation during the dry season deals with four major objectives: (i) <b>incomes</b> <b>generation,</b> (ii) care of draught animal, (iii) productivity, and (iv) risks management for animal losses (thefts and mortalities). When the nutritional stress becomes important, <b>incomes</b> <b>generation</b> gives up progressively the ground to the risk management. The supplementation strategy relies on a maximum valorization (70 - 80 % of the cases) of feeds produced in the farm or collected in the bush. Farmers also purchase feeds (salt, cereals bran, agro-industrial by-products) in cash and, livestock remains the frequent source of funds. The results of the study suggest that the development of feeding systems for these mixed crop-livestock farms would focus on alternatives considering the variability of farmers' objectives by the time, and being built on feed that can be easily mobilized by farmers, and offering a low cash cost price, for example green forage and fruit of shrubs rich in energy and nitrogen...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} Granger {{causality}} relationship among <b>income,</b> electricity <b>generation,</b> and carbon-dioxide (CO₂) emissions in Saudi Arabia. It {{is motivated by}} the heightened world concern over global pollution and climate change. There have been many attempts to explain the increase in per-capita CO₂ emissions by relating it to per-capita income growth in a country via the “Environmental Kuznets Curve. ” However, the previous research on CO₂ emissions did not take electricity generation into account. Our multivariate study {{is based on a}} rigorous time-series technique known as long-run structural modeling and investigates two questions: (1) whether real <b>income,</b> electricity <b>generation,</b> and CO₂ emissions are cointegrated or not and (2) if they are cointegrated, this study makes an initial attempt to discern the Granger-causality relationship between them. In particular, we ask what drives CO₂ emissions: <b>income</b> or electricity <b>generation?</b> Saudi Arabia is taken as a case study. Our econometric findings tend to indicate that real <b>income,</b> electricity <b>generation,</b> and CO₂ emissions are cointegrated and that CO₂ emissions are driven mainly by real income, although it appears that at the out-of-sample forecast period electricity generation also started playing a significant role in explaining CO₂ emissions. This study’s findings have significant policy implication since CO₂ emissions are largely income-driven, suggesting that policies should be focused on environment-friendly gross domestic product (GDP) growth. Moreover, not only the production but also the consumption of GDP, in particular the tastes and preferences of high-income individuals, needs to be environment-friendly. These findings have profound policy implications for both the developing and the developed economies of the world. 13 page(s...|$|R
