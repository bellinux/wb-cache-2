The study was a descriptive survey where data was collected using questionnaires with both closed and open ended questions. A total of 60 respondents from 30 tertiary education institutions in Kenya were interviewed and the response rate was 78 %. Findings of the research indicated that there are many determinants of effective capacity in tertiary education institutions in Kenya. The most important were established as operational, facilities and human factors. Other determinants, in order from most to least important were process, <b>external,</b> <b>policy,</b> <b>service,</b> supply chain and other factors.

It was found that these five critical success factors are significantly related.

Empirically, it explores the interaction between EU humanitarian aid and development cooperation, the Common Foreign and Security Policy, and trade policy.

40|$|Development {{cooperation}} will {{be central}} to the <b>external</b> <b>policy</b> of the post-Lisbon Treaty EU. Measuring up to the letter and spirit of the Lisbon Treaty requires strengthening the European Union (EU) as a development actor, while ensuring that development policy is flexible enough to respond to – but not be dominated by – {{the demands of a}} changing foreign policy environment. The new European External Action Service (EEAS) will be the key EU <b>external</b> <b>policy</b> institution and will {{play an important role in}} EU development policymaking. Public debates accompanying the EEAS’ roll-out have highlighted four crucial areas where the new Service can help improve the effectiveness of EU development policy: promoting policy coherence for development, facilitating coordination among actors, fostering professionalism and building legitimacy. All these elements require member states to continue to support the EU <b>external</b> <b>policy</b> integration process, stronger institutional measures to protect development objectives, and strong involvement from the European Commission and Parliament. Improving the coherence, coordination, professionalism and legitimacy of development policy has great potential for increasing the EU’s global influence, both as a development actor and as a foreign policy actor...|$|R
