40|$|Abstract: Mutagenesis in {{crop plants}} {{significantly}} influences the morphological and physiological parameters {{which in turn}} enhances resistance or susceptibility to the infesting insects. Keeping this in view, influence of chemical mutagens viz., <b>Diethyl</b> <b>Sulphate</b> (DES) and Ethyl Methane Sulphonate (EMS) on resistance against whitefly, Bemisia tabaci Gennadius (Aleyrodidae: Hemiptera), in an already identified insect tolerant tomato accession namely Varushanadu Local was studied in comparison with a susceptible check, I 979. The mutagenised plants were evaluated under pot culture conditions at Annamalai University, Annamalainagar, Tamil Nadu, India during 2007 - 2008. Plants of the insect tolerant accession, Varushanadu Local mutagenised with EMS at 0. 2 per cent had the minimum whitefly population (15. 27 numbers/plant) and the maximum plant height (120 cm). But fruit yield was recorded to be the maximum in plants mutagenised with EMS at 0. 3 per cent followed by DES at 0. 1 per cent.

40|$|We report {{measured}} solubilities of five aminium (i. e., monomethyl, dimethyl, trimethyl, <b>diethyl,</b> and triethyl) <b>sulphate</b> salts {{in water}} at 24 °C, and the densities of their aqueous solutions. Using these results, we have converted hygroscopic growth factors determined by Qiu and Zhang (Environ. Sci. Technol. 2012, 46, 4474 - 4480) to a moles {{of water per}} mole of solute basis, and obtained the relationships between concentration and equilibrium relative humidity (water activity) for solutions of the five salts. The results are compared with values predicted using the Extended Aerosol Inorganics Model (E-AIM) of Clegg and co-workers (J. Geophys. Res. 2002, 107, D 14, Art. No. 4207). It is assumed in this model that ion and water activities in the solutions {{are the same as}} those for aqueous (NH) SO at the same molality. The experimental and modelled growth factors agree well in all cases, within the uncertainties of the data, which supports this assumption. Equations for the apparent molar volumes of the aminium sulphate salts in aqueous solutions are presented (based upon the measured densities and literature data), and also activity products of the salts in saturated aqueous solutions (based upon the measured solubilities and assumption of similarity with (NH) SO). Simulations of the deliquescence curves of 1 : 1 and 1 : 9 mass ratio mixtures of monomethyl and dimethyl aminium sulphate with (NH) SO are shown to agree well with the measurements.

40|$|Some of the {{recorded}} properties of a filterable organism (the PAP organism) isolated by Eaton and colleagues from cases of human primary atypical pneumonia {{suggest that it}} may be related biologically to the Mycoplasma (pleuropneumonia-like) group. In further investigation of this possibility now reported {{it was found that the}} organic gold salt, sodium aurothiomalate, which is known to inhibit certain mycoplasmas, would also inhibit infection with the PAP organism in the hamster and chick embryo lung. Some accepted viruses of a similar order of size to the PAP organism-namely, Nigg’s pneumonitis virus of mice (psittacosis group), three strains of influenza virus A, vaccinia and variola viruses-were not inhibited by sodium aurothiomalate. On the other hand, grey lung virus of mice, an organism with some properties resembling those of the PAP organism, was strongly inhibited. Diethyl ether and the antibiotic kanamycin sulphate both inhibited the growth of the PAP organism in chick embryo lung. An intensified Giemsa-staining method revealed small red-purple coccobacillary bodies (later called elementary bodies, EB) in the lungs of chick embryos infected with three different strains of PAP organism isolated, respectively, in 1944, 1954 and 1960 in different parts of the United States. The EB were not seen in uninfected chick embryo lungs. The EB and the antigen of the PAP organism stained by the fluorescent antibody technique occupied essentially the same position in relation to the mesobronchial epithelial cells of chick embryo lung. The formation of both was suppressed in parallel by treatment of inoculum or eggs with <b>diethyl</b> ether, kanamycin <b>sulphate</b> or sodium aurothiomalate.

The risk for laryngeal cancer {{may also have been}} elevated in these workersl. It is unc 1 ear whether the cancer risk is due to the presence of diisopropyl sulphate, which is an intermediate in the process, to isopropyl oils, which are formed as by-products, or to other factors, such as sulphuric acid.

40|$|Many fungal biosynthetic {{pathways}} {{are silent}} in standard culture conditions, and {{activation of the}} silent pathways may enable access to new metabolites with antitumor activities. The aim {{of the present study}} was to develop a practical strategy for microbial chemists to access silent metabolites in fungi. We demonstrated this strategy using a marine-derived fungus Penicillium purpurogenum G 59 and a modified <b>diethyl</b> <b>sulphate</b> mutagenesis procedure. Using this strategy, we discovered four new antitumor compounds named penicimutanolone (1), penicimutanin A (2), penicimutanin B (3), and penicimutatin (4). Structures of the new compounds were elucidated by spectroscopic methods, especially extensive 2 D NMR analysis. Antitumor activities were assayed by the MTT method using human cancer cell lines. Bioassays and HPLC-photodiode array detector (PDAD) -UV and HPLC-electron spray ionization (ESI) -MS analyses were used to estimate the activated secondary metabolite production. Compounds 2 and 3 had novel structures, and 1 was a new compound belonging to a class of very rare natural products from which only four members are so far known. Compounds 1 – 3 inhibited several human cancer cell lines with IC 50 values lower than 20 μM, and 4 inhibited the cell lines to some extent. These results demonstrated the effectiveness of this strategy to discover new compounds by activating silent fungal metabolic pathways. These discoveries provide rationale for the increased use of chemical mutagenesis strategies in silent fungal metabolite studies...|$|E
40|$|AD- 2 - 1 is an {{antitumor}} fungal mutant {{obtained by}} diethyl sulfate mutagenesis of a marine-derived Penicillium purpurogenum G 59. The G 59 strain originally {{did not produce}} any metabolites with antitumor activities in MTT assays using K 562 cells. Tracing newly produced metabolites under guidance of MTT assay and TLC analysis by direct comparison with control G 59 extract, seven new (1 – 7) and two known (8 – 9) lipopeptides were isolated together with five known polyketides 10 – 14 from the extract of mutant AD- 2 - 1. Structures of the seven new compounds including their absolute configurations were determined by spectroscopic and chemical evidences and named as penicimutalides A–G (1 – 7). Seven known compounds were identified as fellutamide B (8), fellutamide C (9), 1 ′-O-methylaverantin (10), averantin (11), averufin (12), nidurufin (13), and sterigmatocystin (14). In the MTT assay, 1 – 14 inhibited several human cancer cell lines to varying extents. All the bioassays and HPLC-photodiode array detector (PDAD) -UV and HPLC-electron spray ionization (ESI) -MS analyses demonstrated that the production of 1 – 14 in the mutant AD- 2 - 1 {{was caused by the}} activated production of silent metabolites in the original G 59 fungal strain.

HPLC-PDAD-UV and HPLC-ESI-MS analyses indicated that the G 59 strain did not produce these metabolites {{and the production of}} 1 – 14 in the mutant AD- 1 - 2 extract was caused by the activation of silent metabolites in the original G 59 strain by DES mutagenesis. The structures of the new compounds, named antineocyclocitrinols A (1) and B (2) and 23 -O-methylantineocyclocitrinol (3), including their absolute configurations were determined by various spectroscopic methods, especially the NMR and Mo 2 -induced CD analyses. Compounds 1 – 3 provide the first examples of the C 25 bicyclo[4. 4. 1]A/B ring steroids with the Z-configuration of 20, 22 -double bond. All of 1 – 14 weakly inhibited several human cancer cell lines to varying extents.

40|$|Propionic acid bacteria, including Propionibacterium acidipropionici, {{are widely}} used in the {{chemical}} industry to produce propionic acid and also for food and feed preservation. However, {{the efficiency of the}} industrial production of these bacteria is limited by their sensitivity to high concentrations of propionic acid excreted into the cultivation medium. Therefore, the development of new biotechnological processes and strains able to overcome this limitation and to improve the profitability of the microbiological production remains  a relevant problem. A new P. acidipropionici FL- 48 strain characterized by an increased resistance to 10 g/L of propionic acid (the number of viable cells after 24 -h cultivation reached 1. 05 × 106) was developed by a two-step induced mutagenesis using UV and <b>diethyl</b> <b>sulphate</b> from the P.  acidipropionici VKPM B- 5723 strain. The mutant strain exceeded the parental strain in the biomass accumulation rate and the amount of produced propionic and acetic acids by 35 %, 20 %, and 16 %, respectively. The stability of such important characteristics as the biomass accumulation rate and the viability on media containing heightened concentrations of propionic acid was confirmed by three sequential monoclonal subculturings on a medium supplemented with 10 g/L of propionic acid. The optimization of the cultivation technology made it possible to determine the optimum seed inoculum dose (10 % of the fermentation medium volume) and the best pH level for the active growth stage (6. 1 ± 0. 1). The scaling up of the fermentation to a 100 -L bioreactor under observance of optimum cultivation conditions demonstrated a high biomass growth rate with a sufficient reproducability; after 20 h of fermentation, the number of viable cells in the culture broth exceeded 1 × 1010  CFU/mL.

40|$|The role of {{specific}} DNA adducts in chromosomal aberration {{was investigated in}} a human lymphoblastoid cell line transfected with drug-metabolising enzymes (MCL- 5) or vector-only (cHol). The cells were treated with ethylating agents which differ in their DNA ethylation profiles, namely the direct-acting carcinogens N-nitroso-N-ethylurea (ENU) and <b>diethyl</b> <b>sulphate</b> (DES), and the indirect-acting N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA). Levels of O 6 and N- 7 ethylguanine (EtGua) were measured by immunoslot-blot analysis, allowing other adduct levels to be inferred. Equimolar (1 mM) treatment with DES or ENU for 28 hr gave similar levels of total DNA alkylation, but a different distribution of particular DNA adducts. The ability of the cell line to respond to genotoxic insult was assessed by measuring DNA repair, cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis. The cells {{were found to have}} normal levels of methylpurine-DNA glycosylase but were lacking methylguanine- methyltransferase. The half-lives of N- 7 and O 6 EtGua were determined to be 37 +/- 4 hr and 29 +/- 14 hr respectively. Cells were unable to arrest in G 1 following y-irradiation, indicative of a mutant p 53 phenotype. The cell line was also resistant to induction of apoptosis, as determined by internucleosomal cleavage and measurement of DNA fragmentation by flow cytometry. DNA strand breaks (critical lesions in aberration formation) were measured by p 53 accumulation and by nick translation with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. ENU-treated cells gave higher p 53 responses than cells treated with equimolar DES, indicating that N- 7 EtGua is not the major adduct responsible for strand breakage. Caffeine co-incubation was shown to abrogate both S-phase and G 2 /M checkpoints, and also increase strand breakage. The frequency of induction of a specific chromosome aberration [t(14 18) ] was investigated, with the effects of ENU (but not DES) and caffeine being synergistic. The important DNA adducts for chromosome aberration formation in this cell line appear to be O 6 EtGua, O 4 EtThy and phosphotriesters. The interplay between phenotype and cellular consequences of particular DNA adducts is highlighted...|$|E
