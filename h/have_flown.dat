5|$|In {{order to}} give its astronauts {{experience}} before these programs started, the Blue Gemini program was proposed, which would have seen USAF astronauts fly on NASA missions in order to practice various techniques required for their own missions. This would have first seen cooperative missions between NASA and the US Air Force, with two missions flying with crews composed of one astronaut from NASA, and one from the USAF, followed by two missions with all-USAF crews, but performing missions for NASA. After these flights, the US Air Force would <b>have</b> <b>flown</b> a number of missions of its own. Firstly, it would <b>have</b> <b>flown</b> a two-man Agena rendezvous and docking mission, followed by two one-man scientific or technology research missions. Other proposed missions included tests of the Astronaut Mobility Unit {{which was designed to}} assist with EVAs, inertial navigation systems, and flying a radar imaging system.|$|E
5|$|As of 2009 a {{total of}} eight {{spacecraft}} <b>have</b> <b>flown</b> around Jupiter and all {{have contributed to the}} present knowledge of the Jovian magnetosphere. The first space probe to reach Jupiter was Pioneer 10 in December 1973, which passed within 2.9RJ {{from the center of the}} planet. Its twin Pioneer 11 visited Jupiter a year later, traveling along a highly inclined trajectory and approaching the planet as close as 1.6RJ.|$|E
50|$|Apollo 10, {{along with}} Apollo 11, {{were the only}} Apollo {{missions}} whose crew were all veterans of spaceflight. Thomas P. Stafford <b>had</b> <b>flown</b> on Gemini 6 and Gemini 9; John W. Young <b>had</b> <b>flown</b> on Gemini 3 and Gemini 10, and Eugene A. Cernan <b>had</b> <b>flown</b> with Stafford on Gemini 9.|$|R
50|$|General Cray {{holds the}} rating of Command Pilot. He <b>has</b> <b>flown</b> more than 2,500 hours. The {{aircraft}} he <b>has</b> <b>flown</b> include the F-16A/B/C/D, AT-38, T-38, and T-37.|$|R
50|$|By 31 December 1968 the {{aircraft}} had made 25,336 flights and <b>had</b> <b>flown</b> for 31,746 hours. Since its previous complete overhaul {{it had made}} 6,429 flights and <b>had</b> <b>flown</b> for 7,188 hours.|$|R
5|$|The Royal Netherlands Air Force, Belgian Air Force, Royal Danish Air Force, Royal Norwegian Air Force, Pakistan Air Force, and Venezuela Air Force <b>have</b> <b>flown</b> the F-16 on combat missions. A Yugoslavian MiG-29 {{was shot}} down by a Dutch F-16AM during the Kosovo War in 1999. Belgian and Danish F-16s also participated in joint {{operations}} over Kosovo during the war. Dutch, Belgian, Danish, and Norwegian F-16s were deployed during the 2011 intervention in Libya and in Afghanistan. In Libya, Norwegian F-16s dropped almost 550 bombs and flew 596 missions, some 17% of the total strike missions including the bombing of Muammar Gaddafi's headquarters.|$|E
5|$|Another {{proposed}} mission {{would have}} seen a Gemini spacecraft rendezvous with a Pegasus satellite in low Earth orbit. The spacecraft would have either been launched directly into an orbit to rendezvous with the Pegasus, or into a lower orbit, subsequently docking with an Agena, and using that to raise its orbit. The Gemini would <b>have</b> <b>flown</b> around the Pegasus, {{and then one of}} the crew would have performed an EVA to recover a piece of one of the spacecraft's micrometeoroid detection panels. This mission would have been used to prove that rendezvous could be accomplished with any spacecraft, to collect data on the satellite's exposure to micrometeoroids — supporting data that the satellite had returned itself, and to demonstrate technology for military flights to inspect hostile satellites.|$|E
5|$|In mid-October, Rush’s son, Huey, was murdered, leading Obama {{to put his}} {{campaign}} on hold. Governor George Ryan called the Illinois Legislature to a special session to re-enact a package of gun-safety bills, a pet issue of Rush, which had been overturned by the Illinois Supreme Court. Obama supported the package, but the session dragged on towards Christmas. Obama annually spent the Christmas vacation in Hawaii with his family visiting his grandmother, who raised him. Obama left Illinois, expecting the session would continue into January. However, a crucial vote took place earlier than expected, failing by five votes with Obama and others absent. Obama came under fire for missing the vote though {{he said he would}} <b>have</b> <b>flown</b> back sooner, but his 18-month-old daughter was sick. Meanwhile, Rush received an outpouring of sympathy that aided {{his campaign}}.|$|E

5|$|Star Dust {{is likely}} to <b>have</b> <b>flown</b> into a nearly {{vertical}} snow field {{near the top of}} the glacier, causing an avalanche that buried the wreckage within seconds and concealed it from searchers. As the compressed snow turned to ice, the wreckage would have been incorporated into the body of the glacier, with fragments emerging many years later and much farther down the mountain. Between 1998 and 2000, about ten per cent of the total expected wreckage emerged from the glacier, prompting several re-examinations of the accident. More debris is expected to emerge in future, not only as a result of normal glacial motion, but also as the glacier melts.|$|E
