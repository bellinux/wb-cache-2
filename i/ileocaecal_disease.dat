40|$|Aim—To {{evaluate}} {{the incidence of}} Crohn's disease in Stockholm County between 1955 and 1989.  Methods—A cohort of 1936 patients with Crohn's disease was retrospectively assembled. Incidence rates and changes in disease distribution were assessed.  Results—The mean increase in incidence was 15 % (95 % confidence intervals 12 % to 18 %) per five year period with a mean annual incidence rate at 4. 6 / 105 {{during the last two}} decades. The mean incidence for the entire study period was similar for men and women. The mean age at diagnosis increased from 25 years in 1960 - 64 to 32 years in 1985 - 89, partly because of an increasing proportion of patients aged at least 60 years at diagnosis. The proportion of patients with colonic Crohn's disease at the time of diagnosis increased from 15 % to 32 % (17 % difference; 95 % confidence intervals 12 % to 23 %) whereas the proportion of patients with <b>ileocaecal</b> <b>disease</b> decreased from 58 % to 41 % (17 % difference; 95 % confidence intervals 10 % to 24 %) during the study period. Elderly patients had a higher proportion of small bowel disease and a lower proportion of ileocolonic disease compared with the younger patients.  Conclusion—The incidence rate of Crohn's disease in Stockholm has stabilised at 4. 6 / 105 and the proportion of elderly patients has increased during a 35 year period. Colonic Crohn's disease has increased in frequency with a reciprocal decrease in <b>ileocaecal</b> <b>disease.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Context: Isolated {{involvement}} of the appendix in Crohn’s disease {{is reported to be}} 0. 2 % to 1. 8 %, and is usually associated with <b>ileocaecal</b> Crohn’s <b>disease</b> in 25 % of ileal and 50 % of caecal disease. While appendicitis in a patient who was previously diagnosed to have ileocaecal Crohn’s may be managed with appendicectomy and ileocaecal resection, appendicectomy alone when performed for appendicitis in a patient with unsuspected <b>ileocaecal</b> Crohn's <b>disease</b> could lead to postoperative complications including enterocutaneous fistula. Case Report: A young female patient who underwent appendicectomy elsewhere for acute appendicitis presented to us with a persistent enterocutaneous fistula of 6 weeks duration. She had complained of general ill health and occasional altered bowel habits for 6 months prior to the acute appendicitis presentation. Our investigations, including a CT scan, suggested the possibility of <b>ileocaecal</b> Crohn’s <b>disease.</b> She underwent excision of the enterocutaneous fistula and ileocaecal resection, and histopathology of the resected specimen confirmed Crohn’s disease. In the postoperative period she received mesasalazine. When last seen 2 years later during her regular follow-up, she was found to be in good health. Conclusion: The possibility of <b>ileocaecal</b> Crohn’s <b>disease</b> should be considered in patients presenting with unexplained postoperative enterocutaneous fistula following appendicectomy. A high index of clinical suspicion is required to make a prompt diagnosis and institute appropriate further treatment in form of ileocaecal resection...|$|R
40|$|Background and aims: The {{importance}} of efficient and safe treatment of Crohns disease is highlighted by its chronicity. Both medical and surgical treatments have shown good {{results in the}} symptomatic control of limited <b>ileocaecal</b> Crohns <b>disease.</b> The {{aim of this study}} was to compare medical treatment with surgical treatment of <b>ileocaecal</b> Crohns <b>disease.</b> Methods: Thirty-six patients from seven hospitals with primary <b>ileocaecal</b> Crohns <b>disease</b> were randomized to either medical or surgical treatment. The medical treatment was induction of remission with budesonide and thereafter maintenance treatment with azathioprine. The surgical treatment was open <b>ileocaecal</b> resection.

Subjective health measured with the 36 -item Short Form Survey Instrument (SF 36) and a visual analogue scale (VAS) were secondary endpoints. Results: There were no differences between the treatment groups in Crohns disease activity index over time. General health, measured as SF 36 score, was higher in patients receiving surgical treatment than in those receiving medical treatment at 1 year, but there was no corresponding difference in VAS. Due to the slow inclusion rate and changes in clinical practice, the study was t = erminated prematurely.

40|$|CROHN'S DISEASE IN STOCKHOLM COUNTY EPIDEMIOLOGICAL PANORAMA AND ASSOCIATED GALLSTONE DISEASE Annika Lapidus, M. D. Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institute, Huddinge University Hospital, SE- 141 86 Stockholm, Sweden Crohn's {{disease is}} a chronic {{inflammatory}} bowel disease of obscure etiology, affecting {{any part of the}} gastrointestinal tract but the ileocaecal region in particular. The annual incidence has gradually been increasing, and the clinical pattern has changed; a shift towards colorectal involvement as well as an increasing number of elderly patients has been observed. Gallstone disease has been a common extraintestinal complication among patients with Crohn's disease, but the true relative risk and the pathogenesis remain unclear. The aims of this thesis were to investigate the epidemiological time trends in Crohn's disease in Stockholm County during a 35 year period between 1955 - 1989, and to evaluate the clinical course of the expanding entity of colorectal Crohn's disease. Furthermore, relative risk and risk factors for developing gallstone disease in patients with Crohn's disease were assessed in patients born 1933 - 1935 and 1953 - 1955. An additional aim, in a separate study, was to investigate what type of gallstones these patients may be prone develop, by examining the bile composition in patients having had ileal resections due to Crohn's disease. The annual incidence of Crohn's disease in Stockholm County increased from 1. 4 to 4. 9 per 100, 000 inhabitants between the 1955 - 1959 and 1985 - 1989 periods, stabilizing at 4. 6 per year during the last two decades. The age specific incidence among those aged 15 - 29 years decreased, whereas the incidence in those aged > 60 years increased. The median age at diagnosis increased from 25 to 32 years. The annual incidence of colorectal Crohn's disease increased from 0. 2 to 1. 6 per 100, 000 inhabitants between 1955 - 1959 and 1985 - 1989. The overall proportion of colorectal Crohn's disease increased from 15 % to 32 % with a corresponding decrease of <b>ileocaecal</b> <b>disease.</b> The frequency of major surgery at first flare-up of colorectal Crohn's disease decreased over time, although the cumulative probability of resection remained unchanged. Half of the patients with colorectal Crohn's disease had at least one surgical resection within ten years from diagnosis and slightly more than half of those patients ultimately received an ileostomy. Patients with left-sided colorectal Crohn's disease were less likely to undergo major surgery, while patients with perianal and rectal fistulas had the highest probability of surgical intervention. A relapse-free course during the initial five years after the first flare-up implied a high probability of remaining in remission. Around 20 % of the patients with colorectal Crohn's disease subsequently developed changes also in the small bowel. Regardless of gender or age, patients with Crohn' s disease had almost twice the prevalence of gallstone disease compared to the general population. The number of previous intestinal resections was the only significant risk factor. Site of disease or type of intestinal resection were not found to be associated with an increased risk for gallstone formation. Short or long ileal resections due to Crohn's disease did not have any major influence on the biliary lipid composition. Nevertheless the cholesterol saturation of bile was significantly lower among the patients than the controls. The bile acid pattern after ileal resection was characterized by a significantly decreased proportion of deoxycholic acid and an increased proportion of ursodeoxycholic acid. Patients having undergone short or long ileal resections due to Crohn's disease had a 50 % higher ratio of bilirubin to bile acids compared with the controls. Patients with Crohn' s disease may therefore develop pigment rather than cholesterol gallstones. It still remains unclear whether the increased prevalence of gallstone disease in patients with Crohn's {{disease is a}}ttributed to secondary morbidity (i. e. surgical management) or Crohn's disease per se. Circumstances at the time of laparotomy, such as use of total parenteral nutrition and/or bowel rest must also be considered in the pathogenesis of gallstone formation in patients with Crohn's disease.

40|$|Introduction. The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the outcome of introduction of early surgery in the course of isolated ileocecal Crohn’s disease, where there is no absolute indication of surgery. Methods. Observational study involving patients with isolated ileocecal Crohn’s disease who underwent early surgical resection (within one year of the presentation of the hospital). A complete blood count, ESR, and CRP were done and compared between the preoperative value, 1 st postoperative visit (3 - 4 weeks), and last follow-up visit. Statistical analysis was done using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to compare the different figures. Results. There was a statistically significant increase in the hemoglobin levels between preoperative, postoperative, and long-term follow-up and a significant decrease in leukocyte count between the pre- and postoperative values (F= 19. 8, p< 0. 001 and F= 8. 9, p= 0. 002, resp.). Similarly, the ESR and CRP values were decreased significantly at long-term follow-up (F= 8. 5, p= 0. 019 and F= 8. 3, p= 0. 013, resp.). Conclusion. Early surgical resection in isolated <b>ileocaecal</b> Crohn’s <b>disease</b> achieved significant biochemical improvements. These successful results in this small number of patients indicate that early surgical intervention may provide better outcomes.

AIMS: We evaluated the possibility of switching from systemic steroids to budesonide (Entocort) in prednisolone/prednisone dependent patients with inactive Crohn's disease affecting the ileum and/or ascending colon. PATIENTS: Steroid dependent patients with a Crohn's disease activity index 200 and an increase of 60 points from baseline or withdrawal due to disease deterioration. RESULTS: After one and 13 weeks without prednisolone, relapse rates were 17 % and 32 %, respectively, in the budesonide group, and 41 % and 65 % in the placebo group (95 % confidence intervals for the difference in percentages - 41 %, - 8 % and - 51 %, - 16 %; p= 0. 004 and p< 0. 001, respectively).

40|$|Treatment of {{patients}} with <b>ileocaecal</b> Crohn's <b>disease</b> who have not responded to conventional therapy is commonly scaled up to biological agents, but surgery can also offer excellent short-term and long-term results. We compared laparoscopic ileocaecal resection with infliximab to assess how they affect health-related quality of life. In this randomised controlled, open-label trial, in 29 teaching hospitals and tertiary care centres in the Netherlands and the UK, adults with non-stricturing, <b>ileocaecal</b> Crohn's <b>disease,</b> in whom conventional therapy has failed were randomly allocated (1 : 1) by an internet randomisation module with biased-coin minimisation for participating centres and perianal fistula to receive laparoscopic ileocaecal resection or infliximab. Eligible patients were aged 18 - 80 years, had active Crohn's disease of the terminal ileum, and had not responded to at least 3 months of conventional therapy with glucocorticosteroids, thiopurines, or methotrexate. Patients with diseased terminal ileum longer than 40 cm or abdominal abscesses were excluded. The primary outcome was quality {{of life on the}} Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) at 12 months. Secondary outcomes were general quality of life, measured by the Short Form- 36 (SF- 36) health survey and its physical and mental component subscales, days unable to participate in social life, days on sick leave, morbidity (additional procedures and hospital admissions), and body image and cosmesis. Analyses of the primary outcome were done in the intention-to-treat population, and safety analyses were done in the per-protocol population. This trial is registered at the Dutch Trial Registry (NTR 1150). Between May 2, 2008, and October 14, 2015, 73 patients were allocated to have resection and 70 to receive infliximab. Corrected for baseline differences, the mean IBDQ score at 12 months was 178 · 1 (95 % CI 171 · 1 - 185 · 0) in the resection group versus 172 · 0 (164 · 3 - 179 · 6) in the infliximab group (mean difference 6 · 1 points, 95 % CI - 4 · 2 to 16 · 4; p= 0 · 25). At 12 months, the mean SF- 36 total score was 112 · 1 (95 % CI 108 · 0 - 116 · 2) in the resection group versus 106 · 5 (102 · 1 - 110 · 9) in the infliximab group (mean difference 5 · 6, 95 % CI - 0 · 4 to 11 · 6), the mean physical component score was 47 · 7 (45 · 7 - 49 · 7) versus 44 · 6 (42 · 5 - 46 · 8; mean difference 3 · 1, 4 · 2 to 6 · 0), and the mean mental component score was 49 · 5 (47 · 0 - 52 · 1) versus 46 · 1 (43 · 3 - 48 · 9; mean difference 3 · 5, - 0 · 3 to 7 · 3). Mean numbers of days of sick leave were 3 · 4 days (SD 7 · 1) in the resection group versus 1 · 4 days (4 · 7) in the infliximab group (p < 0 · 0001), days not able to take part in social life were 1 · 8 days (6 · 3) versus 1 · 1 days (4 · 5; p= 0 · 20), days of scheduled hospital admission were 6 · 5 days (3 · 8) versus 6 · 8 days (3 · 2; p= 0 · 84), and the number {{of patients}} who had unscheduled hospital admissions were 13 (18 %) of 73 versus 15 (21 %) of 70 (p= 0 · 68). Body-image scale mean scores in the patients who had resection were 16 · 0 (95 % CI 15 · 2 - 16 · 8) at baseline versus 17 · 8 (17 · 1 - 18 · 4) at 12 months, and cosmetic scale mean scores were 17 · 6 (16 · 6 - 18 · 6) versus 18 · 6 (17 · 6 - 19 · 6). Surgical intervention-related complications classified as IIIa or worse on the Clavien-Dindo scale occurred in four patients in the resection group. Treatment-related serious adverse events occurred in two patients in the infliximab group. During a median follow-up of 4 years (IQR 2 - 6), 26 (37 %) of 70 patients in the infliximab group had resection, and 19 (26 %) of 73 patients in the resection group received anti-TNF. Laparoscopic resection in patients with limited (diseased terminal ileum < 40 cm), non-stricturing, <b>ileocaecal</b> Crohn's <b>disease</b> in whom conventional therapy has failed could be considered a reasonable alternative to infliximab therapy.

40|$|Hereditary non-polyposis {{colorectal}} cancer (HNPCC) {{has recently been}} linked to germline defects of DNA repair genes. Colorectal tumours in HNPCC frequently show DNA microsatellite instability, {{but it is not}} certain whether this mutator phenotype occurs throughout the morphologically normal colonic mucosa. We have previously used the mPAS histochemical technique in human colorectal mucosa to identify a polymorphism for O-acetyltransferase activity that shows monogenic inheritance and to show that crypt-restricted loss of O-acetyltransferase activity in heterozygotes is due to somatic mutation. We have now used this histochemical technique to measure the somatic mutation frequency in the uninvolved colon of 12 heterozygous patients with HNPCC, 15 with <b>ileocaecal</b> Crohn's <b>disease</b> and 16 with sporadic {{colorectal cancer}} (CRC). HNPCC patients showed a significant increase in mutation frequency with age (Mann-Whitney U, P = 0. 02).

We conclude that germline defects in HNPCC do not result in a generalised increase in liability to mutation in normal colonic mucosa but that a second, somatic, event is required. We postulate that this second event occurs in crypt stem cells at low frequency, giving rise to scattered individual crypts composed of mutation-prone cells. The cells in these crypts are then at high risk of acquiring the mutations that lead to adenomas, and to rapid progression to carcinoma...|$|R

40|$|Prospective {{population-based}} {{studies have}} allowed a re-evaluation {{of the risks}} of insuring patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. Life expectancy, the risk of cancer and working capacity are very much better than previously recognised and are normal for many patients. Three population-based studies in ulcerative colitis have shown a mortality similar to or slightly less {{than the general population}} except in the first year after diagnosis, whilst two have shown a slightly higher mortality (standardized mortality ratio, SMR = 1. 4), except for those with proctitis. In Crohn's disease, two population-based studies have also shown an increased mortality (SMR = 1. 4), which {{is similar to that of}} unskilled manual labourers (SMR = 1. 43) from all causes of death. Three other studies have shown no increase in overall mortality, except in the first 5 years after diagnosis, in those with proximal small intestinal disease and in some patients needing multiple operations. Insurance risks should be evaluated on an individual basis, after details of the extent and pattern of disease have been obtained. Although the 'standard life' in insurance terms differs from that of the general population, because people who seek life assurance are self-selected from a more affluent section of society, many patients can be identified who have a particularly good prognosis.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To {{evaluate}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} the topical corticosteroid budesonide, given in an oral controlled release formulation for maintenance of remission in patients with ileal and <b>ileocaecal</b> Crohn's <b>disease</b> (CD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Out of 176 patients with active CD who had achieved remission (CD activity index score < or = 150) after 10 weeks' treatment with either budesonide or prednisolone, 90 were randomised to continue with once daily treatment of 6 mg budesonide, or 3 mg budesonide or placebo for up to 12 months in a double blind, multicentre trial. Time to symptomatic relapse was calculated using Kaplan-Meier estimates. Morning plasma cortisol was measured at clinic visits and a corticotropin stimulation test was performed {{after three months of}} treatment. RESULTS: Thirty two patients were allocated to the 6 mg budesonide group, 31 to the 3 mg group, and 27 to the placebo group. After three months, 19 per cent of the patients in the 6 mg group had relapsed, compared with 45 per cent in the 3 mg group and 44 per cent in the placebo group (p = 0. 047). The corresponding results after 12 months was 59 per cent in the 6 mg budesonide group, 74 per cent in the 3 mg group, and 63 per cent in the placebo group (p = 0. 44). The median time to relapse or discontinuation was 258 days in the 6 mg group, 139 days in the 3 mg group, and 92 days in the placebo group (p = 0. 021). Mean morning plasma cortisol values increased from entry in all three groups with no statistically significant differences at 12 months. All 13 patients remaining in the placebo group after three months had a normal corticotropin stimulation response, compared with 18 of 23 patients in the 6 mg, and 19 of 21 in the 3 mg budesonide groups (p = 0. 14). Acne and moon face were slightly more common in the budesonide groups.

40|$|Crohn's {{disease is}} a chronic {{inflammatory}} bowel disease which may affect {{any part of the}} gastrointestinal tract with a preference for the terminal ileum and <b>ileocaecal</b> region. The <b>disease</b> was first described in 1932 and has increased during the last decades. The clinical manifestations could be referred to as inflammation, malabsorption and obstruction. The annual incidence of Crohn's disease in the county of Västerbotten, North Sweden, was found to be 4. 9 / 105 inhabitants. In a study of 87 patients in a medical gastrointestinal unit, 23 % of non-operated patients and 66 % of resected patients had increased fecal fat excretion. D-xylose test and lactose tolerance test were abnormal 1 n 19 % and 24 % respectively of the non-operated patients. No clear relation could be found between the outcome of these malabsorption tests and localization, extension or activity of the disease. This suggests the cause of malabsorption 1 n Crohn's disease to be complex and multi- factorial. The morphology of jejunal biopsies from 18 patients with Crohn's disease elsewhere 1 n the gastrointestinal tract demonstrated an abnormal picture 1 n 13 patients when assessed by light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. A high proportion of these patients had abnormal Intestinal absorptive tests. Skeletal muscle biopsies were performed 1 n 13 patients showing a depletion of muscle potassium content and more Infrequently low skeletal muscle magnesium content. This depletion 1 s not reflected by subnormal plasma concentration. In the Initial clinical assessment of a new gamma labelled synthetic bile ac 1 d-SeHCAT, 45 patients, 19 of whom had Crohn's disease, were studied. The outcome of the test correlated well with the excretion of fecal bile acids. It was possible to discriminate patients with terminal Ileal disease from other patient groups. In a follow-up study, the SeHCAT test was modified as to make it simpler and to shorten the test period. Nine patients with Crohn's disease were tested, showing a suffi cent accuracy of the outcome of the test within 48 hours, using simple equipment available in many hospitals. The elimination of radioactivity was calculated as WBR 50 *» the time for 50 % of the administered dose to be excreted. This gives information as to the rate of excretion, reflecting the degree of terminal ileal malfunction. S. 1 - 41 : sammanfattning, s. 43 - 115 : 5 uppsatser digitalisering@um...|$|R
