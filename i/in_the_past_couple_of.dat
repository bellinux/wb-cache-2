25|$|Most of the {{synthesis}} in evo-devo {{has been in}} the field of animal evolution, one reason being the presence of elegant model systems like Drosophila melanogaster, C. elegans, zebrafish and Xenopus laevis. However, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> decades, a wealth of information on plant morphology, coupled with modern molecular techniques has helped shed light on the conserved and unique developmental patterns in the plant kingdom also.|$|E
25|$|Ethnic Russians {{represent}} a significant {{deviation from the}} pattern, with second lowest fertility rate of all major groups, but relatively low median age (37.6 years). This phenomenon is at least {{partly due to the}} fact that children from mixed marriages are often registered as ethnic Russians in the census. The most noticeable trend <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> decades is the convergence of birth rates between minorities (including Muslim minorities) and the Russian majority.|$|E

50|$|The “tough on crime” {{attitudes of}} these recent {{legislative}} events reflect <b>the</b> stance's popularity <b>in</b> public opinion. This {{is true of}} the majority of criminal justice reform policies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>couple</b> decades, including California’s infamous Three Strikes Law.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} caves in this {{limestone}} mountain area with stalagmites and stalactites, {{as well as}} underground rivers and waterfalls. Tu Lan Cave System comprises over 10 caves, {{some of which were}} originally discovered and explored in 1992, and some of which were just found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>couple</b> years.|$|R
25|$|The {{structural}} {{economic changes}} have influenced {{specific aspects of}} the family. However, not all families are affected in the same way. In the U.S., {{whether or not a}} family is dual or single-earner is related to their social class and income. The economic changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> decades have affected middle-class and lower-class families very differently in many aspects, especially since the 1970s economic recession. These family inequalities significantly affect the intersection of Race (United States Census) and Social class in the United States as well.|$|E
25|$|Another {{influential}} {{factor is}} oil revenues. Historically, in periods of {{high oil prices}} and the consequent petrodollar windfall, imports accelerate rapidly in virtually all consumption categories including agricultural products. This, in turn, results in crowding out domestic production and damage to the agriculture sector. After the oil price spikes following 1973, agricultural imports also increased dramatically and caused significant damage to domestic production. Between 1970 and 1976, agricultural imports grew at the staggering annual rate of 35%. This experience was repeated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> years when oil prices were at or over $100 per barrel; {{the result is that}} agricultural imports have increased at a rapid pace and foreign products now form a sizeable chunk of the household consumption basket. Over the past few years, there have been significant price increases in agricultural products in Iran. This is due both to rising domestic demand and to rising global commodity prices.|$|E
500|$|In a {{negative}} review, David Jeffries of Allmusic said that [...] "the glossy 'Lighters' {{feels more like}} a Bruno Mars track than Detroit diesel." [...] Tiny Mix Tapes critic Jakob Dorof stated that the hook is [...] "awful" [...] and sounds like [...] "If I Were a Boy". Dorof continued, [...] "It’s touching, in a Backstreet Boys meets [...] "Forever Young" [...] kind of way". He criticized Eminem for his rapping lyrics [...] "so long as he keeps rapping as fast and shoutingly {{as he has been}} on every last verse he’s released <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> years". Consequence of Sound's reviewer Winston Robbins gave a rather negative review on [...] "Lighters". Robbins believes that Mars' vocal delivery in the chorus does not fit into a rap song and would have done better on a solo record or with another artist, [...] "it is so far from home next to the hard verses of two of rap’s bad boys." [...] David Amidon from music website PopMatters said that [...] "Lighters" [...] was the only disappointing recording of the 11 tracks on the EP deluxe edition and [...] "it’s easy to press the skip button if you’d like to." [...] At the 2012 ASCAP Pop Music Awards it was awarded [...] "Most Performed Song".|$|E

50|$|Intense anti-immigrant hostility {{from some}} {{sectors of the}} U.S. {{population}} and increasingly stringent border control policies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>couple</b> decades have also fed the growing human trafficking trade. These factors have severely restricted the job options of undocumented immigrants to the least desirable jobs, many of which can transform into exploitative forced labor contracts and forced prostitution.|$|R

2500|$|The {{cellular}} phone market was a duopoly with prices artificially high but witnessed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> years the traditional price {{war between the}} incumbents Mobinil and Vodafone. A 500 minutes outbound local and long distance calling plan currently costs approximately US$30 as compared to approximately US$90 in 2005.

2500|$|Since the {{amalgamation}} of Brighton and Hove, {{economic and}} retail data has been produced at a citywide level only. Examples of statistics include: Brighton and Hove's tourism industry contributes £380m {{to the economy}} and employs 20,000 people directly or indirectly; the city has 9,600 registered companies; and a 2001 report identified it as one of five [...] "supercities for the future". <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> years tourists to Brighton and Hove have fallen in numbers. Over 2016, day visitors to Brighton and Hove dropped by an average of 2,400 per day. In August 2017, new figures for the year showed Brighton’s tourism had fallen by a further 1% on the previous year.|$|E
2500|$|Grillo's {{book draws}} a {{portrait}} of the Mexican drug cartels and how they have radically transformed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> decades. For the author, the criminal organizations in Mexico are not gangs; they are a [...] "movement and an industry drawing in hundreds of thousands from bullet-ridden barrios to marijuana-growing mountains". The book explains how the cartels have created paramilitary death squads {{with tens of thousands of}} armed men from the country of Guatemala to the Texan border. It contains testimonies from members inside of the cartels; and while El Narco shows that the [...] "devastation" [...] of the Mexican Drug War may be south of the U.S. border, Grillo pinpoints that the United States [...] "is knee-deep in this conflict".|$|E

The closures have allowed the service to focus its attention on Pakistan and Afghanistan, which are its principal stations. On 12 July 2011, MI6 intelligence officers, along with other intelligence agencies tracked 2 British-Afghans to a hotel in Herat, Afghanistan who were discovered to be trying to [...] "establish contact" [...] with the Taliban or al-Qaeda to learn bomb-making skills; operators from the SAS arrested captured them and they are {{believed to be the first}} Britons to be captured alive in Afghanistan since 2001.|$|E
2500|$|Linkin Park's [...] "What I've Done" [...] was {{included}} on the first [...] and was featured in the film's trailer. Mike Shinoda first alluded to [...] "New Divide" [...] on March 28, 2009, stating [...] "We've {{been working on a}} new song <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> weeks that {{has been a lot of}} fun. The backdrop for the song is built on layered, heavy synths and a sharp performance by [...] Rob Bourdon." [...] On April 24, Shinoda revealed that they were working with film score composer Hans Zimmer, writing various interpretations of [...] "New Divide" [...] to serve as thematic elements for the film. When discussing the Transformers sequel with Blabbermouth, Michael Bay said [...] "I love Linkin Park... they really delivered with 'New Divide' — it's a great song that perfectly matches the film's intensity." [...] Parts of the intro were used in the final Transformers trailer.|$|E
2500|$|Global Underground {{sold over}} 150,000 copies of Oakenfold's {{previous}} Global Underground: New York. A {{spokesperson for the}} label claimed that in the US, demand for UK dance music had been increasing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> years, and now made up over two-thirds of the label's sales.

The soundtrack was produced under Village Roadshow and Warner Bros. and distributed through London-Sire Records.|$|E
50|$|The Nyss {{were once}} among their Iosan cousins as one kind. Centuries ago, the Nyss began a spiritual exodus to the north, {{considering}} themselves the chosen {{people of the}} god Nyssor. Although it is mostly speculated, {{it is possible that}} the Nyss believed the downfall of their Iosan cousins is due to the hyper-advancement of their kind, and the abandonment of the old tribal/nomadic ways. Physically identical but separated widely by culture, the Nyss cultivate a hunter/gatherer society <b>in</b> <b>the</b> extreme north that has flourished <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>couple</b> centuries.|$|R
