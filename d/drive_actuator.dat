Applications envisioned at that time included prisoner of war rescue assistance and electronic intercept missions. The underlying miniaturization support technologies were not fully developed at that time, so that progress in prototype development was not immediately forthcoming from this early set of calculations and concept design.

We chose to explore the developing area of sensing and actuating technologies realized by the scratch <b>drive</b> <b>actuator.</b> This relatively new technology was chosen because we are all space engineers with a strong interest in robotics on the macroscopic scale, and the idea of researching robotics on the microscopic scale was very appealing. Our objective for this project was to gain an understanding of the basic mechanisms that the untethered scratch <b>drive</b> <b>actuator</b> is using, as well as to present an analytical and qualitative analysis of the devices themselves.

40|$|The paper {{reviews the}} {{developments}} made for designing and fabricating a piezoelectric <b>driven</b> <b>actuator</b> and its integration into coplanar wave guide (CPW) microwave structures.

40|$|A 3 -dimensional MEMS {{fabrication}} process to prototype large stroke (> 10 µm) actuators as required {{for use in}} future adaptive optics systems in astronomy and vision science is presented. The Electrochemical Fabrication (EFABTM) process creates metal micro-structures by electroplating multiple, independently patterned layers.

The design freedom enabled by this process {{has been used to}} make both parallel plate and comb <b>drive</b> <b>actuator</b> designs that can have large vertical heights of up to 1 mm.

40|$|Gels, soft {{polymeric}} or {{composite materials}} {{that have a}} high fraction of water, are often found as structural materials and actuators in nature but have so far not found many uses when fabricated synthetically. We first examine some natural systems such as jellyfish, sea anemones, starfish, legumes, and human tissue, all having interesting ways of moving or otherwise reacting to the surrounding environment. Then we discuss swelling and cross-linking of hydrogels, followed by a look at actuation by electrically, thermally, and chemically stimulated gels, noting that electrical stimulation needs a chemical intermediary to show substantial actuation (comparable to human muscle, for instance). Electroactive gels have great potential as sensors and actuators but their actual uses are mainly restricted to passive drug delivery and matrices for sensors.
