50|$|The {{subfield}} of geometry {{studies the}} representation of three-dimensional objects in a <b>discrete</b> <b>digital</b> setting. Because the appearance of an object depends largely on its exterior, boundary representations are most commonly used. Two dimensional surfaces are a good representation for most objects, {{though they may be}} non-manifold. Since surfaces are not finite, <b>discrete</b> <b>digital</b> approximations are used. Polygonal meshes (and to a lesser extent subdivision surfaces) are by far the most common representation, although point-based representations have become more popular recently (see for instance the Symposium on Point-Based Graphics). These representations are Lagrangian, meaning the spatial locations of the samples are independent. Recently, Eulerian surface descriptions (i.e., where spatial samples are fixed) such as level sets have been developed into a useful representation for deforming surfaces which undergo many topological changes (with fluids being the most notable example).|$|E

5000|$|Microcontroller systems provide {{multiple}} {{forms of}} {{input and output}} signals to allow application software to control an external [...] "real-world" [...] system. <b>Discrete</b> <b>digital</b> I/O provides a single bit of data (on or off).

50|$|In electronics, a digital-to-analog {{converter}} (DAC or D-to-A) is a circuit for converting a digital signal (usually binary) to an analog signal (current, voltage or electric charge). Digital-to-analog converters are interfaces between the digital world and analog world. An analog-to-digital converter (abbreviated ADC, A/D or A to D) is an electronic circuit that converts continuous signals to <b>discrete</b> <b>digital</b> numbers.|$|E
50|$|Most useful {{digital systems}} must {{translate}} from continuous analog signals to <b>discrete</b> <b>digital</b> signals. This causes quantization errors. Quantization error {{can be reduced}} if the system stores enough digital data to represent the signal to the desired degree of fidelity. The Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem provides an important guideline {{as to how much}} digital data is needed to accurately portray a given analog signal.|$|E
50|$|One may {{ask for a}} {{discrete}} analog to the Gaussian;this is necessary in <b>discrete</b> applications,particularly <b>digital</b> signal processing.A simple answer is to sample the continuous Gaussian, yielding the sampled Gaussian kernel. However, this discrete function {{does not have the}} discrete analogs of the properties of the continuous function, and can lead to undesired effects, as described in the article scale space implementation.|$|R

50|$|In {{information}} theory, the noisy-channel coding theorem (sometimes Shannon's theorem), establishes {{that for}} any given degree of noise contamination of a communication channel, {{it is possible to}} communicate <b>discrete</b> data (<b>digital</b> information) nearly error-free up to a computable maximum rate through the channel. This result was presented by Claude Shannon in 1948 and was based in part on earlier work and ideas of Harry Nyquist and Ralph Hartley.|$|R
5000|$|In mathematics, more {{specifically}} in harmonic analysis, Walsh functions form a complete orthogonal {{set of functions}} {{that can be used}} to represent any discrete function—just like trigonometric functions can be used to represent any continuous function in Fourier analysis. [...] They can thus be viewed as a <b>discrete,</b> <b>digital</b> counterpart of the continuous, analog system of trigonometric functions on the unit interval. But unlike the sine and cosine functions, which are continuous, Walsh functions are piecewise constant. They take the values −1 and +1 only, on sub-intervals defined by dyadic fractions.|$|E
50|$|Although all {{compliant}} DTS decoders support surround {{configurations of}} up to 5.1 channels, a DTS ES decoder must be used to fully decode discs with 6.0 or 6.1 channels of audio. DTS ES comes in two flavors: DTS ES Matrix and DTS ES Discrete. Depending on the disc and decoder used the Cs (center surround) channel will either be derived from the Ls and Rs of a conventional 5.1 track via matrix decoding, or exist as a fully <b>discrete</b> <b>digital</b> extension to a 5.0 or 5.1 core. In either case, backward compatibility is maintained with non-ES decoders.|$|E
50|$|Analog {{systems do}} not have <b>discrete</b> <b>digital</b> levels in which the signal is encoded. Consequently, the {{original}} signal can be preserved to an accuracy limited only by the intrinsic noise-floor and maximum signal level {{of the media and}} the playback equipment, i.e., the dynamic range of the system. This form of distortion, sometimes called granular or quantization distortion, has been pointed to as a fault of some digital systems and recordings. Knee & Hawksford drew attention to the deficiencies in some early digital recordings, where the digital release was said to be inferior to the analog version.|$|E

5000|$|Analog signal {{processing}} is {{any type of}} {{signal processing}} conducted on continuous analog signals by some analog means (as opposed to the <b>discrete</b> <b>Digital</b> Signal Processing where the signal processing is carried out by a digital process). [...] "Analog" [...] indicates something that is mathematically represented {{as a set of}} continuous values. This differs from [...] "digital" [...] which uses a series of discrete quantities to represent signal. Analog values are typically represented as a voltage, electric current, or electric charge around components in the electronic devices. An error or noise affecting such physical quantities will result in a corresponding error in the signals represented by such physical quantities.|$|E
5000|$|A lower-frequency {{light source}} that is {{insufficient}} in energy {{to create more}} Eu3+ ions can return the trapped electrons to the conduction band. As these mobilized electrons encounter Eu3+ ions, they release a blue-violet 400 nm luminescence. [...] This light is produced {{in proportion to the}} number of trapped electrons, and thus in proportion to the original X-ray signal. It can be collected often by a photomultiplier tube, which is clocked at a specific resolution or pixel capture frequency. The light is thereby converted to an electronic signal and significantly amplified. The electronic signal is then quantized via an ADC to <b>discrete</b> (<b>digital)</b> values for each pixel and placed into the image processor pixel map.|$|E
50|$|Consider {{that the}} nervous system in animals {{is a form of}} hybrid computer. Signals pass across the synapses from one nerve cell to the next as <b>discrete</b> (<b>digital)</b> packets of chemicals, which are then summed within the nerve cell in an analog fashion by {{building}} an electro-chemical potential until its threshold is reached, whereupon it discharges and sends out a series of digital packets to the next nerve cell. The advantages are at least threefold: noise within the system is minimized (and tends not to be additive), no common grounding system is required, and there is minimal degradation of the signal even if there are substantial differences in activity of the cells along a path (only the signal delays tend to vary). The individual nerve cells are analogous to analog computers; the synapses are analogous to digital computers.|$|E

50|$|The spatial {{resolution}} of digital systems (e.g. HDTV and VGA) are fixed {{independently of the}} analog bandwidth because each pixel is digitized, transmitted, and stored as a <b>discrete</b> value. <b>Digital</b> cameras, recorders, and displays must be selected so that the resolution is identical from camera to display. However, in analog systems, {{the resolution of the}} camera, recorder, cabling, amplifiers, transmitters, receivers, and display may all be independent and the overall system resolution is governed by the bandwidth of the lowest performing component.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Discrete</b> <b>digital</b> {{inputs and}} outputs might be {{buffered}} from the microprocessor data bus only by an addressable latch, or might be operated by a specialized input/output IC, such as an Intel 8255 or Motorola 6821 parallel input/output adapter. Later single-chip micrcontrollers have input and output pins available. These input/output circuits usually do not provide enough current to directly operate devices like lamps or motors, so solid-state relays are operated by the microcontroller digital outputs, and inputs are isolated by signal conditioning level-shifting and protection circuits. [...] One or more analog inputs, with an analog multiplexer and common analog to digital converter, are found on some microcontroller boards. Analog outputs may use a digital-to-analog converter or, on some microcontrollers, may be controlled by pulse-width modulation. For discrete inputs, external circuits {{may be required to}} scale inputs, or to provide functions like bridge excitation or cold junction compensation.|$|E
40|$|The Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) {{must be able}} {{to operate}} in various shallow water sea state conditions.
