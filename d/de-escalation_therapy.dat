Aim: This study evaluated factors influencing mortality of patients with Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), including bacterial resistance, prescription errors, and <b>de-escalation</b> of antibiotic <b>therapy.</b> Methods: This retrospective study included 120 cases of Ventilator-associated pneumonia admitted to the adult adult intensive care unit of the Federal University of Uberlândia. The chi-square {{test was used to}} compare qualitative variables.

In addition to treating infections, antibiotic use contributes to the emergence of resistance among pathogenic microorganisms. Therefore, avoiding unnecessary antibiotic use and optimizing the administration of antimicrobial agents will help to improve patient outcomes while minimizing further pressures for resistance. This review will present several strategies aimed at achieving optimal use of antimicrobial agents. It is important to note that each intensive care unit should have a program in place which monitors antibiotic utilization and its effectiveness.

40|$|Defining the {{severity}} of an infection can {{play a central role}} for a correct therapeutic choice, avoiding inadequate antimicrobial treatments. Severe bacterial infections are, in fact, characterized by high morbidity and mortality rates so that the appropriateness of therapy can have a profound clinical impact. Indeed, initial inappropriate empirical therapies, and the further need to modify them, substantially increase the mortality risk. Several strategies have been suggested to improve the clinical outcome of patients affected by severe bacterial infections, {{such as the use of}} guidelines, use of antibiotics in combination, <b>de-escalation</b> <b>therapy,</b> cycling therapy and the use of infectious disease specialist consultation. A closer collaboration between the medical staff in the wards and infectious disease specialists can possibly bridge the gap between different strategies and individual needs of the patient, thereby improving the decision-making process...|$|E
40|$|Nosocomial {{pneumonia}} is {{the second}} most frequent nosocomial infection and represents {{the leading cause of death}} due to hospital acquired infections. In recent years, evidence has accumulated that initial inappropriate antibiotic treatment is an important and independent mortality risk factor for patients with nosocomial pneumonia. On this point, several authors have found that delaying the administration of appropriate antibacterial treatment is associated with an excess in hospital mortality. In this scenario, various strategies have been proposed, such as <b>de-escalation</b> <b>therapy,</b> that attempt to balance the need to provide appropriate initial treatment with limiting the emergence of antibacterial resistance. Another relevant point is the duration of antibiotic therapy: international guidelines suggest that it should be based upon the clinical response, with a standard duration of 14 - 21 days, but several authors have shown that a shorter course could lead to the same clinical results, and significantly reduce both antimicrobial consumption and the emergence of resistant pathogens. The present review deals with the clinical importance of early, shorter antibiotic therapy...|$|E
40|$|Therapy of {{advanced}} Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is {{a rapidly changing}} field due {{to a lot of}} currently emerging data. Treatment approaches are presently based on either the Kairos principle of giving aggressive therapy upfront and considering <b>de-escalation</b> of <b>therapy</b> if the interim PET/CT is negative or the Chronos principle of starting with ABVD followed by escalation of therapy for patients with positive interim PET/CT. The International Prognostic Score (IPS) is still valid for decision-making regarding the type of initial therapy, since patients with a high score do have an inferior progression free survival (PFS) with ABVD compared to those with a low score. Escalated BEACOPP administered upfront improves PFS; however, increase in the overall survival (OS) has not been confirmed yet, and this therapy is accompanied by elevated toxicity and fertility impairment.

40|$|The high morbidity, mortality, {{and health}} care costs {{associated}} with invasive fungal infections, especially in the critical care setting and immunocompromised host, have made it an excellent target for prophylactic, empiric, and preemptive therapy interventions principally based on early identification of risk factors.

40|$|Abstract Ventilator-associated {{pneumonia}} (VAP) is {{the second}} commonest nosocomial infection in paediatric intensive care units. New definitions about VAP have been proposed recently for better epidemiological study and clinical trials. Management approach is mainly based on adult recommendation because of scanty paediatric studies. Multidrug resistant microorganisms can cause both the early and the late onset VAP. Possible risk factors for VAP include longer duration of ventilation, immunodeficiency, use of immunosuppressive drugs, neuromuscular blockade, genetic syndrome(s), reintubation and transport of critical patients. To have a more reliable diagnosis, quantitative or semi-quantitative bacterial cultures using bronchoscopic or nonbronchoscopic methods should be performed before initiation of the <b>de-escalation</b> <b>therapy,</b> which is the current trend of management. The threshold bacterial count of bronchoalveolar lavage in diagnosing pneumonia is still controversial in Paediatrics. Initial empirical treatment with combination antibiotics therapy providing a broad spectrum cover to decrease the mortality should be considered, which could later be narrowed to single sensitive antibiotic based on bacterial culture. Shorter duration of antibiotic(s) of 8 days is equally effective as the 15 -day treatment except in Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia. Good nursing care with utmost infection control practice is the paramount element {{in the prevention of}} VAP...|$|E
40|$|Despite big {{advances}} in antimicrobial therapies and infection strategies, {{the emergence of}} antibiotic resistance represents an emergency situation, especially in immunocompromised hosts. Specifically, infections due to multidrug resistant, gram-negative pathogens are responsible for high mortality rates and may leave few effective antimicrobial options. Furthermore, although new compounds are available for severe methicillin-resistant staphylococcal infections, there is a paucity of novel classes of antimicrobials to target resistant gram-negatives. A careful assessment of the clinical conditions and underlying comorbidities, along with knowledge about the previous history of colonization or infections due to multidrug-resistant bacteria, represent key points in approaching the hematological patient with signs of infection. A <b>de-escalation</b> <b>therapy</b> with initial use of wide-spectrum antimicrobials followed by a reassessment after 72 hours of treatment may represent a good option in severe infections if a resistant pathogen is suspected. Prompt empiric or targeted therapy using combination regimens (ie, antipseudomonal beta-lactam plus an aminoglycoside or a quinolone) {{with the addition of}} colistin, along with increased dosage and therapeutic drug monitoring, represent options for these life-threatening infections. Continuous epidemiological surveillance of local bacteremias is necessary, along with stringent enforcement of antibiotic stewardship programs in cancer patients...|$|E
40|$|Background Despite better prognosis, {{there is}} a group of oropharyngeal {{squamous}} cell carcinoma (SCC) human papillomavirus (HPV) + patients who experience treatment failure and succumb to distant metastasis. Methods Seventy‐eight previously untreated patients nested in a concurrent chemoradiation protocol were reviewed to correlate patterns of local‐regional tumor extent to distant metastasis. Biomarker assessment was: HPV in situ hybridization and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) immunointensity. Results The 3 ‐year disease‐specific survival (DSS) for patients presenting with and without matted nodes was 69 % and 94 %, respectively (p =. 003). Matted nodes were a poor prognostic factor independent of T classification, HPV, EGFR, and smoking status. For patients who were HPV+, 7 of 11 died of distant metastasis and 6 of 7 with distant metastasis had matted nodes. Conclusion Matted nodes are a novel marker of poor prognosis in oropharyngeal SCC independent of established prognostic factors.

40|$|The {{increasingly}} daunting {{problem of}} antimicrobial resistance {{has led to}} an intense focus on optimization of antibiotic therapy, with simultaneous goals of improving patient outcomes and minimizing the contribution of that therapy to making the available antibiotics obsolete. Although even appropriate antibiotic therapy drives resistance, inappropriate therapy may also have adverse effects on the individual patient, {{as well as on the}} bacterial ecology. Recent research has validated the benefit of intelligent utilization of both microbiological data and clinical assessment in the empirical selection of initial broad-spectrum therapy and in further guidance of therapeutic decisions throughout the course of illness by use of a systems approach. Thus, the optimal approach to the critically ill patient with infection involves the initiation of aggressive broad-spectrumempirical therapy followed by timely responses to microbiological and clinical results as they become available. An appropriate response to this information often involves <b>de-escalation</b> of <b>therapy</b> or even its discontinuation.

40|$|AbstractSkin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs) are {{a common}} {{indication}} for antibiotic use in Europe and are associated with considerable morbidity. Treatment of SSTIs, occasionally complicated by infection with meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, can be resource intensive and lead to high healthcare costs. For patients treated in an inpatient setting, once the acute infection has been controlled, a patient may be discharged on suitable oral antibiotic therapy or outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy. The recently confirmed efficacy of single-dose (e. g. oritavancin) and two-dose (e. g. dalbavancin) infusion therapies as well as tedizolid phosphate, a short-duration therapy available both for intravenous (i. v.) and oral use, for treating SSTIs has highlighted the need for clinicians to re-evaluate their current treatment paradigms. In addition, recent clinical trial data reporting a novel endpoint of early clinical response, defined as change in lesion size at 48 – 72 [*]h, may be of value in determining which patients are most suitable for early <b>de-escalation</b> of <b>therapy,</b> including switch from i. v. to oral antibiotics, and subsequent early hospital discharge.

40|$|<b>De-escalation</b> <b>therapy</b> is a {{term that}} {{suggests}} the need to reduce the spectrum {{or the number of}} antibiotics formerly prescribed for critical patients, upon clinical improvement and/or microorganism recovery. the major goal of this concept is the use of broad-spectrum antibiotic agents as initial drugs of choice for severe patients, instead of reserving the most potent agents after an inadequate clinical response, or after the microorganism is recovered. Despite possible commercial concerns and an unproven but possible relationship with enhancing global antibiotic use, the concept was correct and in accordance with scientific evidence. However, the de-escalation component of the concept is very seldom reported, and no large clinical trial on this issue is available until today. To definitely put in practice this concept, comparative large trials must be designed and sponsored to insert this strategy at the same level of evidence of wide initial empiric antibiotic treatments.

40|$|Objective: to {{evaluate}} the efficiency of intravenous and inhaled antibiotic therapy for nosocomial pneumonia caused by gram-negative bacteria by quantifying lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Subjects and methods. Examinations were made in 54 patients with mechanical ventilation-associated nosocomial pneumonia. Conventional de-escalating intravenous antibiotic therapy (with carbapenems) was used in Group 1 (n= 26). Inhaled antibiotic monotherapy with TOBI (tobramycin) in a dose of 300 mg every 12 hours for 10 — 12 days was performed in Group 2 (n= 28). The use of inhaled tobramycin as a monodrug {{was due to the}} absence of other infection foci. LPS was quantified using a diagnostic activated particle-method-endotox spp. kit (A. N. Bakulev Research Center of Cardiovascular Surgery, Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, OOO ROKHAT Research-and-Production Firm, Russia). Results. The first administration of the antibiotic is accompanied by a higher arteriovenous difference in the content of gram-negative bacterial LPS due to increased arterial endotoxemia. Conclusion. Elevated arterial blood LPS levels after initiation of systemic or inhaled antibiotic therapy for nosocomial pneumonia may be employed as an early criterion for its efficiency. Tobramycin inhalations give rise to a significant increase in arterial lipopolysaccharidemia as compared to <b>de-escalation</b> <b>therapy</b> with carbapenems with low rates of adverse reactions and undesirable events.

40|$|AbstractThere is no {{evidence}} supporting the use of <b>de-escalation</b> <b>therapy</b> (DET) among patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). We assessed the outcomes associated with DET among bacteraemic CAP patients. We performed a secondary analysis of the Community-Acquired Pneumonia Organization database, which contains data on 660 bacteraemic patients hospitalized because of CAP in 35 countries (2001 – 2013). Exclusion criteria were death within 72  h from admission and an inappropriate empirical antibiotic regimen. DET was defined as changing an appropriate empirical broad-spectrum regimen to a narrower-spectrum regimen according to culture results within 7 days from hospital admission. Two study groups were identified: patients whose antibiotic therapy was de-escalated (the DET group), and patients whose antibiotic therapy was not de-escalated (the N-DET group). The primary study outcome was 30 -day mortality. Two hundred and sixty-one bacteraemic CAP patients were included. Gram-positive bacteria were responsible for 88. 1 % of the cases (Streptococcus pneumoniae, 75. 9 %). Gram-negative bacteria were responsible for for 7. 3 % of the cases. DET was performed in 165 patients (63. 2 %). The N-DET group was characterized by a more severe presentation at admission. After adjustment for confounders, DET {{was not associated with}} an increased risk of 30 -day mortality. DET seems to be safe among bacteraemic patients with CAP.

40|$|SummaryThe primary {{objective}} of this analysis was to evaluate group 2 carbapenem usage and to model the impact that a formalized de-escalation protocol to ertapenem could potentially have on group 2 carbapenem usage {{in the hope of}} alleviating the selective pressure on Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas. This analysis was conducted in three hospitals within the Detroit Medical Center in 2009. Patients were considered candidates for <b>de-escalation</b> of carbapenem <b>therapy</b> when a group 2 carbapenem was utilized to treat Enterobacteriaceae, such as extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) -producing organisms, or if cultures were negative in non-intensive care unit (ICU) patients.

Apart from the pivotal Phase III trials demonstrating efficacy against placebo and interferon-β- 1 a once weekly, sufficient clinical data are now available to assess its real-world efficacy and safety profile. Approved indications of fingolimod differ between countries. This discrepancy, to some extent, reflects the intermediate position of fingolimod in the expanding lineup of MS medications. With individualization of therapy, appropriate patient selection gets more important. We discuss various scenarios for fingolimod use in relapsing-remitting MS and their pitfalls: as first-line therapy, as escalation therapy after failure of previous immunotherapies, and as <b>de-escalation</b> <b>therapy</b> following highly potent immunotherapies. Potential side effects such as bradycardia, infections, macular edema, teratogenicity, and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy as well as appropriate safety precautions are outlined. Disease reactivation has been described upon fingolimod cessation; therefore, patients should be closely monitored for MS activity for several months after stopping fingolimod. Finally, we discuss preclinical and clinical data indicating neuroprotective effects of fingolimod, which might open the way to future indications such as stroke, Alzheimer’s disease, and other neurodegenerative disorders.

The {{objective of this}} study is to compare disease activity in MS patients who continued on NTZ treatment to those who were switched to subcutaneous interferon 1 b (IFNB) treatment. Methods: 1 -year randomized, rater-blinded, parallel-group, pilot study (ClinicalTrial. gov ID: NCT 01144052). Relapsing remitting MS patients on NTZ for ≥ 12 months who had been free of disease activity on this therapy (no relapses and disability progression for ≥ 6 months, no gadolinium-enhancing lesions on baseline MRI) were randomized to NTZ or IFNB. Primary endpoint was time to first on-study relapse. Additional clinical, MRI and safety parameters were assessed. Analysis was based on intention to treat. Results: 19 patients (NTZ n= 10; IFNB n= 9) with similar baseline characteristics were included. 78 % of IFNB treated patients remained relapse free (NTZ group: 100 %), and 25 % remained free of new T 2 lesions (NTZ group: 62. 5 %). While time to first on-study relapse was not significantly different between groups (p= 0. 125), many secondary clinical and radiological endpoints (number of relapses, proportion of relapse free patients, number of new T 2 lesions) showed a trend, or were significant (new T 2 lesions at month 6) in favoring NTZ.

Early diagnosis and treatment {{are associated with a}} better prognosis. In the last years there have been important developments in antifungal pharmacotherapy. An approach to the new diagnosis tools in the clinical mycology laboratory and an analysis of the use new antifungal agents and its application in different clinical situations has been made. Furthermore, an attempt of developing a state of the art in each clinical scenario (critically ill, hematological, and solid organ transplant patients) has been performed, trying to choose the best strategy for each clinical situation (prophylaxis, pre-emptive, empirical, or targeted therapy). The high mortality rates in these settings make mandatory the application of early <b>de-escalation</b> <b>therapy</b> in critically ill patients with fungal infection. In addition, the possibility of antifungal combination therapy might be considered in solid organ transplant and hematological patients.

40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesThe use {{and demand}} of {{echocardiography}} has increased worldwide. In developed countries, {{this has not}} been translated into improved access outside tertiary centres. Previous studies have favoured the appropriate use of echocardiography over its clinical impact, limiting generalisability to resource constrained settings. Objectives: To assess the impact of an echocardiographic service at district hospital level in Cape Town, South Africa. Methods: A prospective, cross-sectional study was performed. A total of 210 consecutive patients, referred to the echocardiography clinic over a five-month period, were recruited. Transthoracic echocardiography was evaluated by its indication, new information provided, correlation with referring doctor's diagnosis and subsequent management plan. Impact included the escalation and de-escalation in treatment, as well as usefulness without a change in management. Results: The results show that 84 % of the patients' management was impacted by echocardiography. Valvular lesions were the main indication. The most frequent contribution was information provided towards the diagnosis of heart failure and assessment post-myocardial infarction. Fifty-six per cent of the echocardiograms confirming the referring doctor's diagnosis still had a significant impact. The rational prescription of medication had the major impetus, followed by <b>de-escalation</b> of <b>therapy</b> and screening patients for referral to tertiary facilities. Conclusion: Echocardiography has a positive impact on patient management outside tertiary settings, where the definition of impact appears to be different. The value of a normal study, screening prior to upstream referral and usefulness irrespective of change has been established. This should alert policy makers towards the risk of restricted access and promote training...|$|R
40|$|Background: Data {{describing}} real-life {{management and}} treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in Europe are limited. REACH ([URL] webcite) was a retrospective, observational study collecting data on the management of EU patients hospitalized with CAP. The {{purpose of this study}} was to understand patient and disease characteristics in patients hospitalized with CAP and to review current clinical practices and outcomes. Methods: Patients were aged ≥ 18 years, hospitalized with CAP between March 2010 and February 2011, and requiring in-hospital treatment with intravenous antibiotics. An electronic Case Report Form was used to collect patient, disease and treatment variables, including type of CAP, medical history, treatment setting, antibiotics administered and clinical outcomes. Results: Patients (N[*]=[*] 2, 039) were recruited from 128 centres in ten EU countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, UK). The majority of patients were aged ≥ 65 years (56. 4 %) and had CAP only (78. 8 %). Initial antibiotic treatment modification occurred in 28. 9 % of patients and was more likely in certain groups (patients with comorbidities; more severely ill patients; patients with healthcare-associated pneumonia, immunosuppression or recurrent episodes of CAP). Streamlining (<b>de-escalation)</b> of <b>therapy</b> occurred in 5. 1 % of patients. Mean length of hospital stay was 12. 6 days and overall mortality was 7. 2 %. Conclusion: These data provide a current overview of clinical practice in patients with CAP in EU hospitals, revealing high rates of initial antibiotic treatment modification. The findings may precipitate reassessment of optimal management regimens for hospitalized CAP patients...|$|R
40|$|Background: Guidelines for the {{management}} of adults with hospital-acquired (HAP), ventilatorassociated (VAP), and healthcare-associated (HCAP) pneumonia were recently updated. These evidence-based guidelines emphasize early, appropriate antimicrobials, as well as, <b>de-escalation</b> of initial <b>therapy</b> based upon microbiologic cultures and clinical response of the patient, and to shorten duration of therapy to a minimum effective period. Objective: To evaluate adherence to the nosocomial pneumonia guidelines before and after a multifaceted educational intervention in conjunction with the implementation of an adult pneumonia order set. Methods: A three phase, retrospective, observational analysis was performed among patients with nosocomial pneumonia in a tertiary care facility. The phases consisted of an analysis of medical charts to identify empiric antimicrobial therapy for patients with nosocomial pneumonia; education of physicians on the guidelines; and repeat review of medical charts of patients with nosocomial pneumonia to observe for guideline adherence. An adult pneumonia order set was introduced to the medical staff prior to the initiation of the observational analysis and provided a modality for prescribers to be most compliant with the current recommendations for treatin...|$|R
