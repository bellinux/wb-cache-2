40|$|We {{conducted}} a retrospective {{study to determine}} the prevalence of cellulitis condemnations in the Ontario chicken industry and the relative proportion of variation attributable to factors that vary between processors, producers, and lots and over time. The time span studied was April 1998 to April 2001. We obtained condemnation data randomly from the Chicken Farmers of Ontario, Canada and analysed the data with a generalized mixed model. The (weighted) average prevalence of cellulitis in Ontario between April 1998 and 2001 was 0. 94 % (0. 87 %, 1. 03 %). The prevalence of cellulitis ranged from 0 to 14. 9 %, with one outlier at 30 and 95 % of the data between 0 and 2. 58 %. The final mixed model we {{used to describe the}} variation in the prevalence of cellulitis between lots included random effect terms, the plant where the birds were processed, the producer, the <b>quota</b> <b>period</b> when the birds were processed, and the interaction term <b>quota</b> <b>period</b> by processing plant, as well as fixed effects terms, the type of inspection system and the average weight of the birds. The final model containing these variables explained approximately 78 % of the total variation in the data. Our findings indicate all three random effects variables accounted for a significant amount of variation in the cellulitis data; however, the greatest source of variation was ascribed to the plants where the birds were processed. Some of the variation in cellulitis associated with processing plants was explained by the type of inspection system used by the plant, but even after controlling for this factor, there remained a relatively large amount of variation between processing plants (approximately 30 %). These findings suggest there may be discrepancies in the diagnoses of the condition. Some of the variation in the prevalence of cellulitis (~ 13 %) was also attributed to the producer; however, more of the variation in the data was attributed to differences in lot-specific factors (~ 22 %). Therefore, future control efforts for cellulitis should focus on standardizing the classification of cellulitis at processing plants and identifying lot specific factors that may increase the risk of the condition...|$|R

In 1993, however, part of the executionary responsibilities was delegated to the fishing industry. In this new system, responsibilities in the management of individual transferable quota (ITQs) has been devolved to groups of fishermen. This Dutch co-management system proved to be successful in quota management; landings did not exceed <b>quota</b> in the <b>period</b> 1993 - 2001. A 1996 evaluation of the system concluded that the combination of positive inducements and some coercion made individual fishermen decide to become and to remain cooperative; that the fleet succeeded in a more economic use of the quota; and, that the distribution of net benefits had improved to some extent. Both fishermen and government are enthusiastic about the management system. Since January 2002 a Steering group has started to investigate the possibilities to extend the management responsibilities of the fishermen’s groups.

Among these Asian countries, Korea and China are important countries to compare in the textile and apparel industry. According to the WTO (World Trade Organization) International Trade Statistics, China, a developing country, has been ranked first in textile and apparel exports from 2010 to 2012. Despite rising labor costs, reminbi (RMB) appreciation, and lower demand from export markets, China’s textile industry is still growing at a healthy pace and looks to dominate the global apparel sector, both as a producer and as a consumer for years to come (Apparel Technology 2014). In comparison with other Asian textile and apparel players, even though Korea ranked eighth regarding textile and apparel exports in 2010 – 2012, as a developed country, it is also an important.

In 2016, the first year when the law was effective, the female share increased again by 4. 5 percentage points. Using a hand-collected dataset, we investigate whether the rise in female board representation was accompanied by a change in gender differences in board member characteristics and board involvement. We do not find evidence for the "Golden Skirts" phenomenon, i. e., the rise in the female share was not achieved via a few female directors holding multiple board memberships. After controlling for firm heterogeneity, the remuneration of female shareholder (employee) representatives is about 16 (9) percent lower than for males. We interpret this as an overall indication that women are not only underrepresented in German supervisory boards, they are even more underrepresented in important board positions. Indeed, women are less likely to become a chairman and are less often assigned to board committees (except for the nominating committee). Moreover, in 2016 the disadvantage of women (as compared to men) to obtain a committee membership is even larger than in 2009...|$|R
