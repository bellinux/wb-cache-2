5000|$|<b>Decaë</b> is {{strongly}} associated with directors who strongly influenced, or were part of, the French New Wave. These include Jean-Pierre Melville, Louis Malle and Claude Chabrol. <b>Decaë</b> first worked as a cinematographer with Melville on Le Silence de la Mer (1949). <b>Decaë</b> also edited and mixed the sound. Although <b>Decaë</b> worked with Melville on Les enfants terribles, which as Williams commented (1992, p333) [...] "...the work is more accurately {{to be viewed as}} a stunning demonstration of the cinematic possibilities of faithful literary adaptation {{in the hands of a}} gifted director", according to Marie (p 88) it was his distinctive camera work on Bob le flambeur which caught the attention of the Cahiers critics. Malle hired him for his first two features and Chabrol for his first three features. They had been lucky as <b>Decaë</b> was finding it hard to get work at that time as he was being informally shunned by many after participating in a critical film about the Korean War. By the time <b>Decaë</b> worked for François Truffaut on The 400 Blows he came with a reputation, which meant that he was the highest-paid person on the film.|$|R

25|$|The Dukes of Burgundy, {{who ruled}} the Low Countries in the 15th century, {{used the term}} les pays de par <b>deçà</b> (~ the lands over here) for the Low Countries as opposed to les pays de par delà (~ the lands over there) for their {{original}} homeland: Burgundy in present-day east-central France. Under Habsburg rule, Les pays de par <b>deçà</b> developed in pays d'embas (lands down-here), a deictic expression {{in relation to other}} Habsburg possessions in Europe. This was translated as Neder-landen in contemporary Dutch official documents. From a regional point of view, Niderlant was also the area between the Meuse and the lower Rhine in the late Middle Ages. The area known as Oberland (High country) was in this deictic context considered to begin approximately at the nearby higher located Cologne.|$|E
