5|$|In 1789, Adams {{was elected}} Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts {{and served in}} that office until Governor Hancock's death in 1793, when he became acting {{governor}}. The next year, Adams was elected as governor in his own right, {{the first of four}} annual terms. He was generally regarded as the leader of his state's Jeffersonian Republicans, who were opposed to the Federalist Party. Unlike some other Republicans, Adams supported the suppression of the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794 for the same reasons that he had opposed Shays's Rebellion. Like his fellow Republicans, he spoke out against the Jay Treaty in 1796, a position that drew criticism in a state that was increasingly Federalist. In that year's U. S. presidential election, Republicans in Virginia cast 15 electoral votes for Adams {{in an effort to make}} him Jefferson's vice-president, but Federalist <b>John</b> <b>Adams</b> won the election, with Jefferson becoming vice-president. The Adams cousins remained friends, but Samuel was pleased when Jefferson defeated <b>John</b> <b>Adams</b> in the 1800 presidential election.|$|E
5|$|<b>John</b> <b>Adams</b> (October 30 1735– July 4, 1826) was an American patriot {{who served}} as the second President of the United States (1797–1801) and the first Vice President (1789–97). He was a lawyer, diplomat, statesman, {{political}} theorist, and, as a Founding Father, a leader of the movement for American independence from Great Britain. He was also a dedicated diarist and correspondent, particularly with his wife and closest advisor Abigail.|$|E
5|$|<b>John</b> <b>Adams</b> {{predicted}} {{in a famous}} letter, written to his wife on the following day, that July 2 would become a great American holiday. He thought that the vote for independence would be commemorated; he did not foresee that Americans—including himself—would instead celebrate Independence Day on the date when the announcement of that act was finalized.|$|E

5|$|Opinions of Hamilton {{have run}} the gamut: both <b>John</b> <b>Adams</b> and Thomas Jefferson viewed him as unprincipled and dangerously aristocratic. Hamilton's {{reputation}} was mostly negative in the eras of Jeffersonian democracy and Jacksonian democracy. By the Progressive era, Herbert Croly, Henry Cabot Lodge, and Theodore Roosevelt praised his leadership {{of a strong}} government. Several nineteenth- and twentieth-century Republicans entered politics by writing laudatory biographies of Hamilton.|$|E
