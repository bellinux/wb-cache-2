5|$|At the hotel, James locates a {{videotape}} which depicts him killing his dying wife. At {{this point in}} the game, the letter from Mary is shown to have been a blank piece of paper the entire time. In another room, a final meeting with Angela sees her giving up on life as she is unable to cope with her trauma and guilt any longer. She walks into a fire and is not seen again. At this point it is revealed that in Angela's version of Silent Hill the town <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> fire.|$|E

He is a very good professional who <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> the training field. That is why his career has lasted as long as it has. Jerry is a very good influence on the dressing room as well and I'm delighted that he will be staying with us.|$|E

The Erzya language can vary its stress in words to give specific nuances to sentential meaning.|$|E

25|$|In a two wire {{system the}} {{standard}} arrangement for diver communications {{is to have}} the diver's side normally on, so that the surface team can hear anything from the diver at all times except when the surface is sending a message.

25|$|Welsh has {{a simple}} pitch accent {{but this does}} not affect meaning because it <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> the same syllable. It does however make it easier to {{differentiate}} words in rapid speech. The stress accent is normally on the last or penultimate syllable in Welsh, but the pitch accent is always placed on the last syllable of a word as a high pitch.|$|E
25|$|The Shire's fictional Yule {{consists}} of two days called 1 Yule and 2 Yule. The {{last day of the}} year is 1 Yule and {{the first day of the}} next year is 2 Yule.

25|$|Word {{stress is}} {{predictable}} in Hawaiian for words {{with three or}} fewer moras (that is, three or fewer vowels, with diphthongs and long vowels counting as two vowels). In such cases, stress <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> the penultimate mora. Longer words will also follow this pattern, but may in addition have a second stressed syllable which is not predictable. In Hawaiian, a stressed syllable is louder in volume, longer in duration and higher in pitch.|$|E
25|$|Heavy {{volcanic}} loam soils, such as {{are found}} in New Zealand, {{require the use of}} four heavy draught horses to pull a double-furrow plough. Where paddocks are more square than long-rectangular it is more economical to have horses four wide in harness than two-by-two ahead, thus one horse <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> the ploughed land (the sod). The limits of strength and endurance of horses made greater than two-furrow ploughs uneconomic to use on one farm.|$|E

25|$|Doctor Harold Legg is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the British soap opera EastEnders, played by Leonard Fenton. Dr Legg is Walford's original GP. He is widely trusted within the community, and <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> hand to dish out advice. Dr Legg {{appears as a}} regular character between 1985 and 1989, but continues to appear in a recurring role until 1997. He was officially retired in 1999 by executive producer Matthew Robinson, though he has made cameos since this time in 2000, 2004 and 2007.|$|E
25|$|Rogers {{suggested}} that the incongruent individual, who <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> the defensive and cannot be open to all experiences, is not functioning ideally and may even be malfunctioning. They work hard at maintaining/protecting their self-concept. Because their lives are not authentic {{this is a difficult}} task and they are under constant threat. They deploy defense mechanisms to achieve this. He describes two mechanisms: distortion and denial. Distortion occurs when the individual perceives a threat to their self-concept. They distort the perception until it fits their self-concept.|$|E
25|$|Something Wicked This Way Comes can be {{interpreted}} as an allegory of the struggle between good and evil, with the human characters Will, Jim, and Charles on the side of morality, and Mr. Dark and his carnival on the side of sin and temptation. As in many other fictional works revolving around the same concept, good prevails in the end, not with supernatural or physical powers, but with purity of heart. Jim represents good that <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> the verge of giving into temptation, while Will, though he has crises and doubts, is the part of us that resists giving in.|$|E

50|$|The {{most obvious}} {{characteristic}} of flatfish, {{other than their}} flatness, is asymmetry because both eyes {{are on the same}} side of the head in the adult fish. In some families of flatfish, the eyes <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> the right side of the body (dextral or right-eyed flatfish), and in others, they <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> the left (sinistral or left-eyed flatfish). Primitive spiny turbots include equal numbers of right- and left-sided individuals, and are generally more symmetrical than other families.|$|R

25|$|The Dieter Roth Academy {{was founded}} in May 2000 by fifteen close friends and colleagues of Dieter Roth. It now {{includes}} many times that number. In his later years Dieter Roth spoke of his typically innovative idea of an academy  an institution unbound to any one place or building or curriculum. As a passionate traveller, he realised that the best experience a young artist can have is travelling and encountering new people and situations. Consequently the Dieter Roth Academy lives there where its members live and work  on several continents. And <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> the move, having convened now in at least eight countries.|$|E
25|$|Two {{types of}} ambiguities can be distinguished. Parse tree {{ambiguity}} and structural ambiguity. Structural ambiguity {{does not affect}} thermodynamic approaches as the optimal structure selection <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> the basis of lowest free energy scores. Parse tree ambiguity concerns the existence of multiple parse trees per sequence. Such an ambiguity can reveal all possible base-paired structures for the sequence by generating all possible parse trees then finding the optimal one. In the case of structural ambiguity multiple parse trees describe the same secondary structure. This obscures the CYK algorithm decision on finding an optimal structure as the correspondence between the parse tree and the structure is not unique. Grammar ambiguity can be checked for by the conditional-inside algorithm.|$|E
25|$|While the ferries {{no longer}} {{transport}} motor vehicles, they do transport bicycles. There are two bicycle entrances to the ferry from either borough. The bike entrance <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>on</b> {{the first floor}} so bicyclists can enter the ferry from the ground without needing to enter the building. The ground entrance is also reserved exclusively for bike riders (everyone else must use the 2nd floor entrance). Cyclists must dismount and walk their bicycles to the waiting area and onto the boat and bicycles must be stored in the designated bicycle storage area on each boat. Cyclists are subject to screening upon arrival at the ferry terminals. Bicycles may also be taken on the lowest deck of the ferry without charge.|$|E
