30|$|Due to {{the lack}} of {{experimental}} data and the difficulties to measure the variation of pressures, densities, and temperatures of the flowing reactants in the supply-return manifolds, anodes, and cathodes of the fuel cell stack, gases are assumed to behave as an ideal gas with constant specific heats and zero flow fractions. Moreover, and particularly in the supply-return manifolds of the stack, gases are assumed to subject to the isentropic stagnation state. Equations (19), (20), (21), (25), and (27) will be used to determine the pressure, temperature, and velocity of <b>gas</b> leaving the <b>supply</b> <b>manifold</b> of anode and cathode of the fuel cell stack. While under assumption of steady flow, the mass flow rate of <b>gas</b> entering the <b>supply</b> <b>manifold</b> is assumed to be equal to the mass flow rate of gas leaving it.|$|R
25|$|The usual {{configurations}} {{used for}} increased primary <b>gas</b> <b>supply</b> are <b>manifolded</b> or independent twin back mounted cylinders, multiple side mounted cylinders, or rebreathers.

Cylinders may carry a variety of gases depending on when and {{where they will be}} used, and as some may not support life if used at the wrong depth, they are marked for positive identification of the contents. Managing the larger number of cylinders is an additional task loading on the diver. Cylinders are usually labeled with the gas mixture and will also be marked with the maximum operating depth and if applicable, minimum operating depth.|$|R

40|$|Quickly declining {{natural gas}} {{reserves}} {{in some parts}} of the world, increasing demand in today's major gas consuming regions, the emergence of new demand centres and the globalization of natural gas markets caused by the rising importance of liquefied natural gas (LNG) are changing global <b>gas</b> <b>supply</b> structures and will continue to do so over the next decades. Applying a global gas market model, we produce a forecast for global <b>gas</b> <b>supply</b> to 2030 and determine the supplier-specific long-run average costs of <b>gas</b> <b>supplied</b> to three major consuming regions. Results for the three regions are compared and analysed with a focus on costs, supply diversification and the different roles of LNG. We find that while European and Japanese external <b>gas</b> <b>supply</b> will be less diversified in international comparison, <b>gas</b> can be <b>supplied</b> at relatively low costs due to the regions' favourable locations in geographic proximity to large gas producers.

40|$|Natural gas {{has become}} an {{increasingly}} valuable resource and a global commodity. The demand for it has significantly increased. Japan, Korea and Taiwan heavily rely on liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports for their <b>gas</b> <b>supplies</b> from Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia, Australia and the Middle East. On the other hand, countries like Thailand and Singapore import gas via trans-border pipelines. Gas <b>supply</b> interruptions, volatile <b>gas</b> prices, transportation and distribution bottlenecks, and a growing reliance on imports over longer distances have renewed interest on gas security in Asia. This paper examines the relative vulnerability to natural <b>gas</b> <b>supply</b> disruptions of seven gas-importing countries in Asia for year 2008. Based on four indicators of security of <b>gas</b> <b>supply,</b> a composite <b>gas</b> <b>supply</b> security index is estimated as an overall indication of gas vulnerability for our sample countries.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between the 3 D morphology of gas-diffusion layers (GDL) of HT-PEFCs and their functionality is analyzed. A stochastic model describing the microstructure of paper-type GDL is combined with the Lattice-Boltzmann method (LBM) to simulate gas transport within the GDL microstructure. Virtual 3 D microstructures representing paper-type GDL are generated by a stochastic model, where the binder morphology is systematically modified. On these structures single phase, single component gas flow is computed by the LBM. Quality criteria evaluating the spatial homogeneity of <b>gas</b> <b>supply</b> are introduced and related to the binder morphology. The spatial homogeneity of the <b>gas</b> <b>supply</b> is analyzed by a parametrized stochastic model describing the gas flow at the exit of the GDL. This approach gives insight into the spatial structure of the gas flow at the GDL exit. The quality of <b>gas</b> <b>supply</b> is quantified by characterizing size and arrangement of regions with high <b>gas</b> <b>supply.</b> This stochastic <b>gas</b> flow model predicts the quality of <b>gas</b> <b>supply</b> for further binder morphologies. Analyzing the quality criteria and the stochastic evaluation of the spatial structure of the gas flow field at the GDL exit, {{it is found that}} the binder morphology has an essential influence on the <b>gas</b> <b>supply...</b>|$|R

When modeling the shale <b>gas</b> <b>supply</b> in a specific gas field, it {{is of paramount importance}} to determine the <b>gas</b> <b>supply</b> under economic considerations. Two common calculation methods are used in China for this purpose: Method 1 (M 1) is the breakeven analysis, where the <b>gas</b> <b>supply</b> is based on the relationship between costs and revenues, while Method 2 (M 2) is the Geologic Resource Supply-Demand Model, where the supply relies on demand and price scenarios.

In this study, the Fuling shale gas field in the Sichuan Basin was chosen as a study case to forecast the shale <b>gas</b> <b>supply</b> using these two different methods. A sensitivity analysis was performed to discuss the influencing factors of each method and error measures were used to compare the different shale <b>gas</b> <b>supply</b> values calculated by each method. The results shows that M 1 is more sensitive to initial production, while M 2 is more sensitive to gas price.
