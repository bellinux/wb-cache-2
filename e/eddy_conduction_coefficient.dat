40|$|A finite Fourier {{transform}} is used {{to perform}} both linear and nonlinear stability analyses of a Darcy-Lapwood system of convective rolls. The method shows how many modes are unstable, the wave number instability band within each mode, the maximum growth rate (most critical) wave numbers on each mode, and the nonlinear growth rates for each amplitude {{as a function of}} the porous Rayleigh number. Single amplitude controls the nonlinear growth rates and thereby the physical flow rate and fluid velocity, on each mode. They are called the flak amplitudes. A discrete Fourier transform is used for numerical simulations and here frequency combinations appear that the traditional cut-off infinite transforms do not have. The discrete show a stationary solution in the weak instability phase, but when carried past 2 unstable modes they show fluctuating motion where all amplitudes except the flak may be zero on the average. This leads to a flak amplitude scaling process of the heat <b>conduction,</b> producing an <b>eddy</b> heat <b>conduction</b> <b>coefficient</b> where a Nu-RaL relationship is found.

40|$|The paper {{considers}} {{heat conduction}} {{in a model}} chain of composite particles with hard core and elastic external shell. Such model mimics three main features of realistic interatomic potentials - hard repulsive core, quasilinear behavior in a ground state and possibility of dissociation. It has become clear recently, that this latter feature has crucial effect on convergence of the heat <b>conduction</b> <b>coefficient</b> in thermodynamic limit. We demonstrate that in one-dimensional chain of elastic particles with hard core the heat <b>conduction</b> <b>coefficient</b> also converges, as one could expect. Then we explore effect of dimensionality on the heat transport in this model. For this sake, longitudinal and transversal motions of the particles are allowed in a long narrow channel. With varying width of the channel, we observe sharp transition from "one-dimensional" to "two-dimensional" behavior. Namely, the heat <b>conduction</b> <b>coefficient</b> drops by about order of magnitude for relatively small widening of the channel. This transition is not unique for the considered system. Similar phenomenon of transition to quasi- 1 D behavior with growth of aspect ratio of the channel is observed also in a gas of densely packed hard (billiard) particles, both for two- and three-dimensional cases. It is the case {{despite the fact that}} the character of transition in these two systems is not similar, due to different convergence properties of the heat conductivity. In the billiard model, the divergence of the heat <b>conduction</b> <b>coefficient</b> smoothly changes from logarithmic to power-like law with increase of the length.

40|$|The paper {{suggests}} a resolution for recent controversy over convergence of heat conductivity in one-dimensional chains with asymmetric nearest-neighbor potential. We conjecture that the convergence is promoted {{not by the}} mere asymmetry of the potential, but due to ability of the chain to dissociate. In other terms, the attractive part of the potential function should approach a finite value as {{the distance between the}} neighbors grows. To clarify this point, we study the simplest model of this sort [...] a chain of linearly elastic disks with finite diameter. If the distance between the disk centers exceeds their diameter, the disks cease to interact. Formation of gaps between the disks is the only possible mechanism for scattering of the oscillatory waves. Heat conduction in this system turns out to be convergent. Moreover, an asymptotic behavior of the heat <b>conduction</b> <b>coefficient</b> for the case of large densities and relatively low temperatures obeys simple Arrhenius-type law. In the limit of low densities, the heat <b>conduction</b> <b>coefficient</b> converges due to triple disk collisions. Numeric observations in both limits are grounded by analytic arguments. In a chain with Lennard-Jones nearest-neighbor potential the heat conductivity also saturates in a thermodynamic limit and the coefficient also scales according to the Arrhenius law for low temperatures. This finding points on a universal role played by the possibility of dissociation, as convergence of the heat <b>conduction</b> <b>coefficient</b> is considered...|$|R

40|$|We use the {{formalism}} of Gould and Raffelt {{to compute}} the dimensionless thermal <b>conduction</b> <b>coefficients</b> for scattering of dark matter particles with standard model nucleons via cross-sections that depend on the relative velocity or momentum exchanged between particles. Motivated by models invoked to reconcile various recent results in direct detection, we explicitly compute the <b>conduction</b> <b>coefficients</b> α and κ for cross-sections that go as v_ rel^ 2, v_ rel^ 4, v_ rel^- 2, q^ 2, q^ 4 and q^- 2, where v_ rel is the relative DM-nucleus velocity and q is the momentum transferred in the collision. We find that a v_ rel^- 2 dependence can significantly enhance energy transport from the inner solar core to the outer core. The same can true for any q-dependent coupling, if the dark matter mass lies within some specific range for each coupling. This effect can complement direct searches for dark matter; combining these results with state-of-the-art Solar simulations should greatly increase sensitivity to certain DM models. It also seems possible that the so-called Solar Abundance Problem could be resolved by enhanced energy transport in the solar core due to such velocity- or momentum-dependent scatterings.

40|$|The paper revisits recent {{counterintuitive}} {{results on}} divergence of heat <b>conduction</b> <b>coefficient</b> in two-dimensional lattices. It {{was reported that}} in certain lattices with on-site potential, for which one-dimensional chain has convergent conductivity, for the 2 D case {{it turns out to}} diverge. We demonstrate that this conclusion is an artifact caused by insufficient size of the simulated system. To overcome computational restrictions, a ribbon of relatively small width is simulated instead of the square specimen. It is further demonstrated that the heat <b>conduction</b> <b>coefficient</b> in the "long" direction of the ribbon ceases to depend on the width, as the latter achieves only 10 to 20 interparticle distances. So, one can consider the dynamics of much longer systems, than in the traditional setting, and still can gain a reliable information regarding the 2 D lattice. It turns out that for all considered models, for which the conductivity is convergent in the 1 D case, it is indeed convergent in the 2 D case. In the same time, however, the length of the system, necessary to reveal the convergence in the 2 D case, may be much bigger than in its 1 D counterpart. Comment: 6 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

40|$|One-dimensional billiard, i. e. a {{chain of}} colliding {{particles}} with equal masses, is well-known example of completely integrable system. Billiards with different particles are generically not integrable, but still exhibit divergence of a heat <b>conduction</b> <b>coefficient</b> (HCC) in thermodynamic limit. Traditional billiard models imply instantaneous (zero-time) collisions between the particles. We lift this condition and consider the heat transport in {{a chain of}} stiff colliding particles with power-law potential of the nearest-neighbor interaction. The instantaneous collisions correspond to the limit of infinite power in the interaction potential; for finite powers, the interactions take nonzero time. This modification of the model leads to profound physical consequence [...] probability of multiple, in particular, triple particle collisions becomes nonzero. Contrary to the integrable billiard of equal particles, the modified model exhibits saturation of the heat <b>conduction</b> <b>coefficient</b> for large system size. Moreover, identification of scattering events with the triple particle collisions leads to simple definition of characteristic mean free path and kinetic description of the heat transport. This approach allows prediction both of temperature and density dependencies for the HCC limit values. The latter dependence is quite counterintuitive - the HCC is inversely proportional to the particle density in the chain. Both predictions are confirmed by direct numeric simulations.
