2500|$|The {{question}} is often asked, how {{the cab and}} omnibus proprietors take to these innovations. Of course not very kindly, but experience shows that these individuals are more frightened than hurt. At first {{there is a little}} loss of revenue to the cabmen, but in the end the result is no worse, as people get educated to riding everywhere, and cabs get a fair share. The railways were said to have struck a death-blow at the ordinary vehicle traffic, but such did not prove to be true, and, wherever tramways have opened there has been no decrease in the numbers of cabs - Leicester for instance. Since the company have been running per timetable, the bus proprietors {{have done the same thing}} along St. Ann's Well-road, and with good result. For the comfort of the shareholders of the company, it may be stated that the directors will no doubt pay in July (with the <b>interim</b> <b>dividend</b> paid in February), a dividend at the rate of six per cent per annum. When this is taken into full consideration - that is to say, when all the difficulties are duly allowed for, and it is remembered that only a portion of the line is as yet opened - the result is most satisfactory. Indeed all the shares are now quoted at two per cent premium with few vendors. As to the character of the company, I think it is not undue flattery to say that it is efficiently and economically managed as the staff is limited to the mere necessary officials, and the directorate is small. Considering the rail employed is one that is sure to result in great saving to the shareholders, seeing that there will be little or no cost of repairs, and taking into consideration also the fact that the tramway route is populous, and the working expenses small, there is every reason to prophecy success to the company [...] [...] [...] As far as we can make out the estimated weekly receipts of the Tramway Company amount to about £350, and in Whit week we believe as much as £430 was taken, for which upwards of 50,000 people were carried. Taking £350 as the average weekly receipts gives a total of over £17,000 in a year, which is a very large sum indeed for the present branch of tramway service in a town of such proportions as Nottingham [...] [...] [...] There are 212 cabs in the town, so that estimating the earnings at but £2 per week there is a total of £424 weekly, or £20,000 a year. Taking the above as a very moderate estimate, and making a little allowance for omnibuses, 'carriers' carts, , it is fair to suppose that at least £40,000 a year is spent in Nottingham for passenger traffic.|$|E
60|$|In {{the first}} place it does not {{guarantee}} to the small investor any security for his little hoard at all. He comes {{into the world of}} investment ill-informed, credulous or only unintelligently suspicious--and he is as a class continually and systematically deprived of his little accumulations. One great financial operation after another in the modern world, as any well-informed person can witness, eats up the small investor. Some huge, vastly respectable-looking enterprise is floated with a capital of so many scores or hundreds of thousands, divided into so many thousands of ordinary shares, so many five or six per cent. preference, so much debentures. It begins its career with a flourish of prosperity, the ordinary shares for a few years pay seven, eight, ten per cent. The Virtuous Small Man provides for his widow and his old age by buying this estimable security. Its price clambers to a premium, and so it passes slowly and steadily from its first speculative holder {{into the hands of the}} investing public. Then comes a slow, quiet, downward movement, a check at the <b>interim</b> <b>dividend,</b> a rapid contraction. Consider such a case as that of the great British Electric Traction Company which began with ordinary shares at ten, which clambered above twenty-one (21-7/8), which is now (October 1907) fluctuating about two. Its six per cent, preference shares have moved between fourteen and five and a half. Its ordinary shares represent a total capital of £1,333,010, and its preference £1,614,370; so that here in this one concern we have a phantom appearance and disappearance of over two million pounds' worth of value and a real disappearance of perhaps half that amount. It requires only a very slight knowledge of the world to convince one that the bulk of that sum was contributed by the modest investments of mediocre and small people out of touch with the real conditions of the world of finance.|$|E

40|$|Australian {{companies}} pay dividends semi-annually {{with smaller}} 'interim' payments and larger 'final' payments. <b>Interim</b> <b>dividends</b> are declared and paid within a less full information environment than final dividends. We analyze {{the interactions between}} the timing of dividends and their information content, controlling for share repurchase and tax effects. Dividend reductions that are not associated with share repurchases are statistically significantly related to future abnormal earnings and provide {{strong support for the}} information content of dividend reductions. The percentage of dividend reduction is stronger for interim than for final dividend reductions. The market reaction is negatively related to the reduction in imputation tax credit and reacts more aggressively and negatively to interim as compared to final dividend reductions. ...|$|R
50|$|In its 2014 annual report, {{the betting}} firm {{admitted}} that its final dividend in 2011 and the <b>interim</b> and final <b>dividends</b> for 2012 and 2013 were paid erroneously because, by law, the “company {{did not have}} sufficient distributable reserves to make those distributions and so {{they should not have}} been paid by the company to its shareholders”.

5000|$|An act was {{obtained}} the following summer, and work promptly {{began on the}} Mirehouse-Frizington section; by December 1855 {{it was possible to}} run a trial train over this, particular attention being paid to the demonstration that trains could safely be stopped and started on the steep climb from Mirehouse to Moor Row. Opening for general mineral traffic followed in January 1856; the safety of the steep descent to Mirehouse being again insisted upon in a contemporary report: [...] "This incline was descended at the rate of six miles per hour without the appliance of any break except to the engine. This is sufficient to set at rest any doubts which may have been entertained by any one respecting difficulty arising from the gradient on this section of the line." [...] The Egremont branch was sufficiently complete by May 1856 that the directors were taken on an inspection tour of the entire line [...] but a Board of Trade inspection of the line in August 1856 insisted on better siding accommodation at the Whitehaven & Furness's Corkickle station and a more permanent arrangement with the W&FJR before passenger services could be authorised. The WC&ER contributed £2000 towards the required work and the agreement with the W&FJR was extended to ten years. [...] Formal opening ceremonies took place 16 July 1857, but passenger services had been running {{since the start of the}} month. In the last week of July 1858, about 6,400 tons of ore were transported by the WC&ER, three-quarters of this being shipped to Wales through Whitehaven harbour, despite its inadequate provision for the export of ore. An embankment failed at Woodend in October 1858, an adjoining viaduct was then condemned because of mining subsidence and (January-February 1859) services on the Egremont branch terminated at Woodend whilst the suspect section of viaduct was replaced by an embankment. The railway was so profitable that it was decided to pay the £500 cost of this out of current revenue, which still allowed an <b>interim</b> <b>dividend</b> of 4% for the first half of 1859. In 1862, Frizington branch services terminated at Cleator, again because of subsidence.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to empirically {{investigate}} stock price and trading volume reactions to simultaneous <b>interim</b> <b>dividend</b> and earnings announcements by the Greek firms listed on the Athens stock exchange (ASE). Design/methodology/approach – Classical event study methodology was employed to examine the share price and trading volume reaction to interim dividends and earnings announcements. Findings – Results confirm the signaling hypothesis which predicts positive market reaction to the joint dividend and earnings announcements. However, the magnitude of the price reaction initiated by the final dividend announcement seems to be higher than the one by the <b>interim</b> <b>dividend</b> announcement. Research limitations/implications – The observations are not many, although the whole population was included, since there are no data available prior to 1998. Practical implications – The findings are useful to researchers, practitioners and investors who have an interest in firms listed on the ASE for their proper strategic decision making. Originality/value – For the first time, the stock price and trading volume behaviour of firms listed on the ASE around contemporaneous dividend and earnings announcement dates is examined.

40|$|NoThis paper {{contributes}} {{to our understanding}} of compliance with non-mandatory statements of best practice. Specifically, we examine the efficacy of agency-related mechanisms on the degree of disclosure compliance with the ASB Statement on interim reports. Using data drawn from a sample of 259 UK companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, we show that although overall disclosure compliance is high (74. 5 % of the items of information being disclosed), companies do not fully comply with the ASB Statement on interim reports. We employ an ordinary least square (OLS) regression model to establish whether selected company-specific and corporate governance characteristics (proxying for agency-related mechanisms) are related to the degree of disclosure compliance. Our results indicate that multiple listing, company size, <b>interim</b> <b>dividend</b> and new share issuance are positively associated with the degree of compliance. We also find that the degree of disclosure compliance is positively associated with auditor involvement, audit committee independence and audit committee financial expertise. These results have important implications for policy because they suggest that whilst agency-related mechanisms may motivate compliance with best practice non-mandatory statements, full compliance may be unattainable without regulations...|$|E
40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy of the University of LutonThe focus {{of this research is}} the disclosure of accounting information in interim reports. The main objective of the research is to assess disclosure of accounting information in interim reports of UK companies listed on the LSE and to investigate whether variations in interim disclosure can be explained by corporate attributes that differentiate companies. The secondary objective is to examine perceptions of investment analysts regarding the importance of information items disclosed in interim reports for investment decision-making. Employing a disclosure-index framework, a list of 113 information items that are and could be disclosed was compiled and a mail questionnaire forwarded to investment analysts to determine the importance of the items. A cross-sectional disclosure model was developed {{to examine the relationship between}} interim disclosure and companyspecific and corporate governance attributes. The primary findings show that (1) investment analysts perceive information disclosed in interim reports as important for their investment decision-making and that there exists agreement between what companies disclose and what investment analysts perceive as importance items of disclosure, and (2) there are variations in the extent of interim disclosure and that both company-specific and corporate governance variables help explain these variations. The findings indicate that the extent of interim disclosure is positively related to company size, listing status, external auditor involvement, acquisition transactions, payment of an <b>interim</b> <b>dividend,</b> techMARK listing, and substantial institutional investors. The results also show that interim disclosure is negatively related to liquidity ratio, CEO age and shareholding of audit committee members. This research contributes to the disclosure literature in a number of ways.
