5|$|Farmers exploit {{flocking}} {{behavior to}} keep sheep together on unfenced pastures such as hill farming, {{and to move}} them more easily. For this purpose shepherds may use herding dogs in this <b>effort,</b> <b>with</b> a highly bred herding ability. Sheep are food-oriented, and association of humans with regular feeding often results in sheep soliciting people for food. Those who are moving sheep may exploit this behavior by leading sheep with buckets of feed.|$|E

On August 7, 2012, Dean Hall {{announced on}} the game's development blog that the mod {{was going to be}} made into its own game, with Bohemia Interactive as the developer, and himself as the project leader. On October 29, 2012, development of the mod officially transferred to a largely community driven <b>effort</b> <b>with</b> the release of version 1.7.3.|$|E
5|$|In North America, the manga was {{released}} by Viz Media from April 2005 to October 2011. The anime series was later licensed in North America by Toonami Jetstream as a joint <b>effort</b> <b>with</b> Viz Media, and aired on December 17, 2007 on its site, but before its completion, the streaming service was shut down. The whole series was streamed in English by Crunchyroll, while Sentai Filmworks licensed the series, with distribution from Section23 Films on DVDs.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the inspection, Sir Francis Flemming, the Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance, was tasked in February 1558 with {{improving}} the defences on the islands. Flemming was supported in this <b>effort</b> <b>with</b> a shipment of lead to aid in construction, and money raised from the dissolution of the monasteries in England. The building work initially focused on the island of Tresco and was carried out under the direction of John Killigrew, the captain of Pendennis Castle in Falmouth. Tresco was in need of modern defences, but Killigrew also wanted to use the work programme to increase his political influence on the island.|$|E
5|$|Back in Salisbury, the Southern Rhodesian {{government}} was coming {{under pressure from}} Britain to put its armed forces under the purview of a regional command. Huggins decided in late October 1942 to join a unified Southern African Command headed by South Africa's Jan Smuts. This choice was motivated {{by a combination of}} strategic concerns and geopolitical manoeuvring. Apart from considering South Africa a more appropriate partner in geographical, logistical and cultural terms, Huggins feared that the alternative—joining the British East Africa Command—might detract from the autonomous nature of Southern Rhodesia's war <b>effort,</b> <b>with</b> possible constitutional implications. A shift in the deployment of the colony's troops duly occurred. For the rest of the war the majority of Rhodesian servicemen went into the field integrated into South African formations, prominently the 6th Armoured Division.|$|E
5|$|By 1942 Jackson {{had held}} {{a job at}} the Sperry Corporation for several years and his work was {{considered}} essential to the war <b>effort.</b> <b>With</b> a brother serving overseas, he was not permitted to train for combat until June 1944, at which point he signed up for the Air Corps branch of the United States Army. He trained to be a bombardier at what is now Webb Air Force Base in Big Spring, Texas and graduated with the rank of second lieutenant. He served briefly as an instructor and then a combatant in the Pacific Theater of Operations until the surrender of Japan. He left the army in 1946 with the rank of First Lieutenant.|$|E

5|$|During the {{petition}} drive, groups supporting Morse accused the firm collecting the signatures of hiring convicted felons and gathering personal information. Recall backers said that Morse's group was misleading the public. In addition, the recall drives brought in support from national groups {{on both sides}} of the issue. The National Rifle Association (NRA) supported the recall <b>effort</b> <b>with</b> mailers and donations. National groups opposing the recall included America Votes, believed to be financially supported by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, as well as California billionaire Eli Broad.|$|E
5|$|HP {{believed}} that it was no longer cost-effective for individual enterprise systems companies such as itself to develop proprietary microprocessors, so it partnered with Intel in 1994 to develop the IA-64 architecture, derived from EPIC. Intel was willing to undertake a very large development effort on IA-64 in the expectation that the resulting microprocessor would be used by the majority of enterprise systems manufacturers. HP and Intel initiated a large joint development <b>effort</b> <b>with</b> a goal of delivering the first product, Merced, in 1998.|$|E
5|$|He {{was made}} an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1943 by George VI in the Birthday Honours of that year, shortly after resigning his censor post. Approaching the {{conclusion}} of the Second World War, Eggleston made several public appearances in his native United Kingdom on behalf of the Ministry of Information, including at the White Rock Pavilion on 20 April 1945, where he expressed Canadian support for the British war <b>effort,</b> <b>with</b> particular admiration for the Battle of Britain.|$|E

5|$|In 1965, San Diego State began {{offering}} {{a doctorate in}} chemistry in a joint <b>effort</b> <b>with</b> University of California, San Diego. By 1991, the campus had eight different doctorate programs. Research became a vital practice of the faculty during the 1960s. By 1965, more than 200 books had been authored by SDSC faculty. Federal research grants increased from $398,202 in 1961 to $1,184,387 in 1967. Faculty research included medical and scientific research, teacher enhancement, Peace Corps training, and a review of nursing curricula.|$|E
5|$|More unorthodox {{methods were}} also explored. Astrosystems International {{developed}} a so-called “Quartz Chamber” which burned pure oxygen and aircraft fuel, converting the chemical energy into light. The system was {{planned to be}} evaluated within a year, and installed in a similar arrangement to the more conventional BIAS. A plan, codenamed Moonshine, was also put forward. Moonshine {{was to be a}} joint <b>effort</b> <b>with</b> NASA to determine the feasibility of a geosynchronous satellite that could in project light directly down on any desired location.|$|E
5|$|On 9 October 1941, President Roosevelt {{approved}} the atomic program after he convened {{a meeting with}} Vannevar Bush and Vice President Henry A. Wallace. To control the program, he created a Top Policy Group consisting of himself—although he never attended a meeting—Wallace, Bush, Conant, Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, and the Chief of Staff of the Army, General George C. Marshall. Roosevelt chose the Army to run the project rather than the Navy, because the Army had more experience with management of large-scale construction projects. He also agreed to coordinate the <b>effort</b> <b>with</b> that of the British, and on 11 October he {{sent a message to}} Prime Minister Winston Churchill, suggesting that they correspond on atomic matters.|$|E

5|$|On April 1, 1998, seven {{counties}} in Minnesota were declared federal disaster areas: Brown, Le Sueur, Nicollet, Rice, Cottonwood, Blue Earth and Nobles. The money allotted {{from the federal}} government allowed the affected towns to clean up the damage and begin the rebuilding process. In addition to the federal dollars, the state of Minnesota contributed $27.6million to the cleanup and rebuilding <b>effort,</b> <b>with</b> $1.35million designated specifically for the preservation of the historical buildings in St. Peter. Most of St. Peter's buildings that were on the National Historic Register were damaged, but only one—a French Second Empire school building built in 1871 (St. Peter Central School)—had to be demolished. Three years after the tornado, the City of St. Peter reported that its population had grown by 2%; an unusual feat for a town that had so recently endured a natural disaster.|$|E

At the Elimination Chamber pay-per-view, Phoenix successfully defended her championship against Tamina, in a point where her association with Phoenix started splitting up, and on the March 22 episode of Superstars, Phoenix teamed with Eve Torres against Natalya and Tamina, in a losing <b>effort,</b> <b>with</b> this effectively ensuring the ending for the team.|$|E
5|$|Stiller {{joined his}} parents in the family film Heavyweights (1995), in which he played two roles, and had an uncredited {{supporting}} role in Adam Sandler's Happy Gilmore (1996). Next, he had lead roles in If Lucy Fell and Flirting with Disaster, before tackling his next directorial <b>effort</b> <b>with</b> The Cable Guy, which starred Jim Carrey. Stiller once again was featured in his own film, as twins. The film received mixed reviews, but was noted for paying the highest salary for an actor up to that point, as Carrey received $20million {{for his work in}} the film.

5|$|The Hokies {{struggled}} back in {{the third}} quarter, scoring six unanswered points to close the score to 3516. In the fourth quarter, however, Tennessee answered Virginia Tech's <b>effort</b> <b>with</b> 10points, putting the game {{out of reach for}} the Hokies, who managed only a single touchdown in the fourth quarter. The Hokies fumbled the ball five times—losing it once—and threw twointerceptions, allowing Tennessee to cruise to an easy victory, 4523. Tennessee running back James Stewart was named the game's most valuable player.|$|E
5|$|The {{events of}} the game are set 20 years after the Crystal War, a devastating war where the Middle Land nations of Bastok, San d'Oria and Windurst fought and {{defeated}} the Shadow Lord and his army of Beastmen. Players deal with the aftermath of this conflict in the original story, and may travel {{back in time to}} aid in the war <b>effort</b> <b>with</b> the expansion pack Wings of the Goddess. Several parallel worlds are available, such as Dynamis and Abyssea, in which the beastmen won the Crystal War and conquered the land.|$|E
5|$|Up {{to the end}} of 1940, Coastal Command's Anti-shipping Operations (ASO) {{campaign}} against German seaborne trade in north-west European waters had claimed a direct attack on only six vessels, totalling 5,561 tons, and 14 others badly damaged. In exchange, 158 aircraft were shot down or lost to other causes; 26 for every enemy vessel. Human casualties amounted to 600 men including 46 to 50 POWs. Coastal Command's performance contrasted heavily with the service' joint mine-laying <b>effort</b> <b>with</b> Bomber Command, that sank 86 enemy vessels in the same period, (totalling 82,983 tons) and ten others damaged for the loss of just 31 aircraft. The performance of Coastal Command's strike wings was down to poor intelligence and equipment, which it was refused, in favour of diverting them to other roles.|$|E
