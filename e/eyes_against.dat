5|$|The head {{is small}} and streamlined, adding to the agility of the cheetah. Saharan cheetah have narrow canine faces. Small, short, and rounded, the ears are marked by black patches on the back; the edges and base of the ears are tawny. The high-set eyes have round pupils. The whiskers, shorter and fewer in number than those of other felids, are fine and inconspicuous. The {{pronounced}} tear streaks are unique to the cheetah. These streaks originate {{from the corner of}} the eyes and run down the nose to the mouth. Their role is obscurethey may be serving as a shield for the <b>eyes</b> <b>against</b> the sun's glare, a helpful feature as the cheetah hunts mainly during the day; another purpose could be to define facial expressions.|$|E
5|$|Several {{more recent}} studies have raised the {{possibility}} that the dinosaur was omnivorous and used its tusks for prey killing during an occasional hunt. In 2000, Paul Barrett suggested that the shape of the premaxillary teeth and the fine serration of the tusks are reminiscent of carnivorous animals, hinting at facultative carnivory. Muntjacs, in contrast, lack serration on their tusks. In 2008, Butler and colleagues argued that the enlarged tusks formed early {{in the development of the}} individual, and therefore could not constitute sexual dimorphism. Combat with conspecifics thus is an unlikely function, as enlarged tusks would be expected only in males if they were a tool for combat. Instead, feeding or defence functions are more likely. It has also been suggested that Heterodontosaurus could have used its jugal bosses to deliver blows during combat, and that the palpebral bone could have protected the <b>eyes</b> <b>against</b> such attacks. In 2011, Norman and colleagues drew attention to the arms and hands, which are relatively long and equipped with large, recurved claws. These features, in combination with the long hindlimbs that allowed for fast running, would have made the animal capable of seizing small prey. As an omnivore, Heterodontosaurus would have had a significant selection advantage during the dry season when vegetation was scarce.|$|E
25|$|Proper {{protection}} such as {{welding goggles}} should be worn at all times, including {{to protect the}} <b>eyes</b> <b>against</b> glare and flying sparks. Special safety eyewear must be used—both to protect the welder {{and to provide a}} clear view through the yellow-orange flare given off by the incandescing flux. In the 1940s cobalt melters’ glasses were borrowed from steel foundries and were still available until the 1980s. However, the lack of protection from impact, ultra-violet, infrared and blue light caused severe eyestrain and eye damage. Didymium eyewear, developed for glassblowers in the 1960s, was also borrowed—until many complained of eye problems from excessive infrared, blue light, and insufficient shading. Today very good eye protection can be found designed especially for gas-welding aluminum that cuts the sodium orange flare completely and provides the necessary protection from ultraviolet, infrared, blue light and impact, according to ANSI Z87-1989 safety standards for a Special Purpose Lens.|$|E

Specialized glasses {{may be used for}} viewing specific visual information (such as stereoscopy) or 3D glasses for viewing three-dimensional movies.
