40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedRoll angle {{is often a}} limiting factor during high-speed turns and repetitive turning maneuvers. Navy and Coast Guard surface ships are designed for high-speed operation. Sharper turns at higher speeds, and repetitive high-speed turns can increase ship survivability by helping these vessels avoid incoming threats. This is particularly true if the amount and direction of roll during the turn is controlled, since the ship's susceptibility to radar and other sensors may be diminished at certain angles. Sharper turns at higher speeds can also reduce {{the time it takes}} to reach a person in the water, improving the chances for successful rescue. Controlled roll during repetitive sharp turns can make high-speed pursuit safer and more likely to succeed. The objective of this thesis is to study the effects of <b>fin</b> <b>stabilizers</b> on a ship's turning performance. <b>Fin</b> <b>stabilizers,</b> commonly added to a ship design for the sole purpose of minimizing unwanted roll during ordinary operations, are shown to also favorably influence both the magnitude and direction of heel experienced during high speed and repetitive maneuvers.

40|$|Small Waterplane Area Twin Hull (SWATH) and Catamaran {{vessels are}} known to have more stable {{platform}} as compared to mono-hulls. A further advantage of SWATH as compared to Catamaran is its smaller waterplane area that provides better seakeeping qualities. However, the significant drawback of the SWATH vessel is when encountering head-sea at high forward speed. Due to its low stiffness, it has a tendency for large pitch motions. Consequently, this may lead to excessive trim or even deck wetness. This phenomenon will not only degrade the comfortability but also results in structural damage with greater safety risks. In this research a modified SWATH design is proposed. The proposed design concept represents a combination of Catamaran and SWATH vessel hull features that will lead to reduce in bow-diving but still maintains good seakeeping capabilities. This is then called the Semi- SWATH vessel. In addition, the full-design of this vessel has been equipped by fixed fore fins and controllable aft fins attached on each lower hull. In the development of controllable aft fins, the PID controller system was applied to obtain an optimal vesselâ€™s ride performance at speeds of 15 (medium) and 20 (high) knots. In this research work, the seakeeping performance of Semi-SWATH vessel was evaluated using time-domain simulation approach. The effect of <b>fin</b> <b>stabilizer</b> on the bare hull performance is considered.

Calculations for a typical large warship indicated that the free surface effect could reduce the cost by about one-third, and the weight of the overall stabilization system by about 22 %.

A flutter {{analysis}} of the new prototype 18 -meter glass glider, the JS 1 Revelation, was performed. The analysis was conducted in two main parts, a modal analysis done by a ground vibration test, followed by a flutter prediction. A ground vibration test {{was performed on the}} glider in two configurations: with no water ballast and with water ballast in the wings. For each of these cases the 1 st, 2 nd and 3 rd symmetric and anti-symmetric wing bending modes and wing torsion modes were extracted as well as <b>fin,</b> <b>stabilizer</b> and fuselage modes. All of these modes were extracted in the frequency range 1 Hz - 32 Hz. The natural frequency, modal damping and mode shape of each mode are among the modal results.
