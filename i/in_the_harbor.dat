5|$|She {{remained}} in service until 14 June 1936, {{when she was}} placed in reserve. Her name was reused for the new battleship Strasbourg, so the old cruiser was renamed Strassbourg II. The cruiser was subsequently used as a barracks ship in Lorient until 1944, when she was seized by the Germans and scuttled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>harbor</b> to protect the U-boat pens <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>harbor</b> from torpedo attack. Barrage balloons and anti-torpedo nets were attached to the ship to strengthen the defenses of the U-boat pens. Her wreck remains <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>harbor,</b> and is visible at low tide.|$|E

5|$|On 14 September, Spee {{decided to}} use his two armored cruisers to raid the British base at Apia; he sent Nürnberg to escort the squadron's colliers to the {{rendezvous}} location. At the Battle of Papeete on 22 September, Nürnberg {{and the rest of}} the East Asia Squadron bombarded the colony. During the bombardment, the French gunboat Zélée was sunk by gunfire from the German ships. Fear of mines <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>harbor</b> prevented von Spee from seizing the coal that lay <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>harbor.</b> By 12 October, the squadron had reached Easter Island. There they were joined by Dresden and Leipzig, which had sailed from American waters. After a week in the area, the ships departed for Chile.|$|E

The Germans attacked the colony, and in the ensuing Battle of Papeete, they sank the French gunboat Zélée. The ships came under fire from French shore batteries but were undamaged.

5|$|A {{quarter of}} the homes in Cihuatlán, Jalisco, were totally destroyed, leaving many homeless. In Manzanillo, Colima, 40 percent of all homes were destroyed, and four ships <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>harbor</b> were sunk. Large {{portions}} of Colima and Jalisco were isolated by flooding. Hundreds of people were stranded. Minatitlán, Colima, suffered especially, as 800people out of its population of 1000 were dead or missing, according to a message sent to President Adolfo López Mateos. In Colima, all coconut plantations were blown down {{and thousands of people}} were left out of work.

50|$|It is {{currently}} believed that bacterial biofilms play an integral role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>harboring</b> of chronic infection by tonsil and adenoid tissue so contributing to recurrent sinusitis and recurrent or persistent ear disease.

5|$|After her reacquisition, the Ward Line placed SS Siboney in transatlantic {{service on}} a New York to Havana, Tenerife, Bilbao, Santander, and Vigo route. On 9September 1920, the ship ran aground <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>harbor</b> at Vigo. Initial efforts to re-float her were unsuccessful, but by late October, Siboney had been {{repaired}} {{enough to make}} it to Shields. Despite considerable damage, Siboney was refitted and placed in service again and, by March 1921, the Ward Line was advertising passage to Spain via Havana aboard her. The Ward Line, however, abandoned the New York–Cuba–Spain service later in 1921 {{due to a lack of}} passengers.|$|E
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War II in September 1939, a degaussing coil was installed just above the waterline to protect the ship from magnetic mines. Her first wartime operation saw her participating in laying a minefield off the German coast in the North Sea on 3 September. She conducted the operation with the other light cruisers Nürnberg, Leipzig, Köln, and Königsberg and sixteen destroyers. After laying her first set of mines, she returned to Wilhelmshaven to restock her mines. While moored <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>harbor,</b> she was attacked by British bombers on 4 September; German anti-aircraft gunners shot down {{four of the five}} Blenheim bombers, one of which inadvertently crashed into the ship. Twenty-nine men were killed or wounded in the crash.|$|E
5|$|Berkshire No. 7 is a {{wood and}} steel barge {{constructed}} in 1935.

Dailey and the Priscilla Dailey <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>harbor</b> of Bridgeport, Connecticut on the west side of the Pequonnock River.

5|$|Cormoran {{was based}} in Tsingtao with {{unusable}} engines; she was scuttled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>harbor</b> since {{she was no longer}} operational.

After the United States entered the war in April 1917, she was seized and commissioned into the US Navy as USS Schurz; she served as an escort until she was accidentally sunk following a collision with a freighter in June 1918. Seeadler and Condor, meanwhile, had been converted into mine storage hulks after the start of the war. Seeadler was destroyed by an accidental explosion in 1917. Condor was {{the only member of the}} class to survive the war, and she was scrapped in 1921.|$|E
5|$|From here Alcibiades {{joined in}} the siege of Byzantium along with Theramenes and Thrasyllus. A portion of the {{citizens}} of the city, demoralized and hungry, decided to surrender the city to Alcibiades for similar terms as the Selymbrians had received. On the designated night the defenders left their posts, and the Athenians attacked the Peloponnesian garrison in the city and their boats <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>harbor.</b> The portion of the citizenry that remained loyal to the Peloponnesians fought so savagely that Alcibiades issued a statement {{in the midst of the}} fighting which guaranteed their safety and this persuaded the remaining citizens to turn against the Peloponnesian garrison, which was nearly totally destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Königsberg {{served as}} a {{training}} ship for naval cadets throughout the 1930s, and joined the non-intervention patrols during the Spanish Civil War in the late 1930s.
