40|$|In this paper, we are {{concerned}} with denoising in experimentally obtained electronic speckle pattern interferometry (ESPI) speckle fringe patterns with poor quality. We extend the application of two existing oriented partial differential equation (PDE) filters, including the second-order single oriented PDE filter and the <b>double</b> <b>oriented</b> PDE filter, to two experimentally obtained ESPI speckle fringe patterns with very poor quality, and compare them with other efficient filtering methods, including the adaptive weighted filter, the improved nonlinear complex diffusion PDE, and the windowed Fourier transform method. All of the five filters have been illustrated to be efficient denoising methods through previous comparative analyses in published papers. The experimental results have demonstrated that the two oriented PDE models are applicable to low-quality ESPI speckle fringe patterns. Then for solving the main shortcoming of the two oriented PDE models, we develop the numerically fast algorithms based on Gauss-Seidel strategy for the two oriented PDE models. The proposed numerical algorithms are capable of accelerating the convergence greatly, and perform significantly better in terms of computational efficiency. Our numerically fast algorithms are extended automatically to some other PDE filtering models. (C) 2013 Optical Society of Americ...|$|E
40|$|REDISCOVERING THE "THEORY OF IMPUTATION". The {{criminal}} {{doctrine of}} Joachim Hruschka. The main {{objective of the}} thesis is to present, based on an extensive study of the scientific work of Joachim Hruschka, the personal and largely extravagant criminal doctrine of this German legal scholar. Furthermore, an equally central focus {{of the work is}} to uncover the dynamics of "imputation" (or the so called "ascription"), in light of the direct impact it exercises on the process of application of the law. The second remark is <b>double</b> <b>oriented.</b> On the one hand, it aims at signaling the "creative" dimension implied in each act of supposedly "neutral" application of the norms. On the other, the study of the theory of imputation, {{as well as that of}} its historical development, wishes to serve as a stimulus for further and deeper interests. Indeed, notwithstanding its ancient origins, the theory of imputation is still able to reveal how each human judgment remains unavoidably grounded on the reality of human experience. The different themes are strictly interconnected. The above-mentioned extravagance of Hruschka's reflections, in fact, is due precisely to the fact that the bases of his legal reasoning and doctrines are not to be identified in enacted and positive norms, but consist in logic principles and, above all, in his "Zurechnungstheorie": a theory of imputation that he himself shaped and developed. This theory, which largely inherits the thought of natural-law moral philosophers, is the skeleton around which Hruschka re-builds the whole system of criminal law. It is the instrument he uses to prove the fallacy, or the intrinsic reasonableness, of specific laws, of particular jurisprudential opinions, of more general criminal doctrines. This work is structured into two sections: one theoretical and one practical. The first section is developed in the first three chapters. A brief introduction illustrates the reasons that make a study on imputation still relevant (chapter I). The second chapter describes and analyses in depth the philosophical and juridical reflections, which were ground for the development of Hruschka's theory of ascription. Finally, an exhaustive and deep description of the structure of this Zurechnungstheorie is offered in chapter III. In the second part of the research project, the Author shows how Hruschka uses his personal theory of imputation in order to solve some of the most typical hard cases of criminal law, while adopting a mostly original method, which he himself defines "logic-analytic", of looking at the legal system and at its institutes. In these pages, along with the conclusions reached by the German scholar, and with the reasoning behind them, the Author presents the conclusions and the reasoning formulated, on the same topics, by Italian jurisprudence and by some of its legal experts. This comparative analysis aims at verifying conformities and, where it seems appropriate, at suggesting opportune modifications to either the conclusion reached or the reasoning employed (chapter IV). The closing chapter underlies some inconsistencies of the doctrine developed by Joachim Hruschka, promoting further studies on the epistemic character of its theses (chapter V). ...|$|E

He was brought in by then-caretaker manager Kevin Nugent, who said — [...] "Jimmy is joining from Chelsea and he will be a good addition to the squad. He has great ability and can play anywhere across the midfield". Smith made his debut for the club five days after joining, on 7 February, playing the whole match in the club's 0-0 away draw at Tranmere Rovers. He played regularly throughout the rest of the season, scoring his first goal for the club in a 2-1 victory over Colchester United at Brisbane Road in April 2009, a late winner that ensured Orient had all but secured their League One status for another season. Smith made 16 appearances during the successful loan spell, scoring once, as the club went from inside the relegation zone to finishing comfortably in mid-table during his three-month stay. He returned to Chelsea at the end of the season with a year remaining on his contract, but opted to leave the club to sign for Leyton Orient on a permanent basis, signing a two-year deal with the East London club. On the move, Smith stated — [...] "The best thing about Orient is I know where I'm going to be from one week to the next. It's the reason I left Chelsea even though I had a year left on my contract".

40|$|Ordered {{nanoporous}} silica films have attracted great interest for their potential use to template nanowires for photovoltaics and thermoelectrics. However, {{it is crucial}} to develop films such that an electrode under the nanoporous film is accessible to solution species via facile mass transport through well-defined pores. Here, we quantitatively measure the electrode accessibility and the effective species diffusivity for nearly all the known {{nanoporous silica}} film structures formed by evaporation-induced self-assembly upon dip-coating or spin-coating. Grazing-angle of incidence small-angle X-ray scattering was used to verify the nanoscale structure of the films and to ensure that all films were highly ordered and oriented. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was then used to assess the transport properties. A model has been developed that separates the electrode/film kinetics and the film transport properties from the film/solution interface and bulk solution effects. Accounting for this, the accessible area of the nanoporous film coated FTO electrode (1 - theta) is obtained from the high-frequency data, while the effective diffusivity of the ferrocene dimethanol (D-FDM) redox couple is obtained from intermediate frequencies. It was found that the degree of order and orientation in the film, in addition to the symmetry/topology, is a dominant factor that determines these two key parameters. The EIS data show that the (211) <b>oriented</b> <b>double</b> gyroid, (110) <b>oriented</b> distorted body center cubic, and (211) distorted primitive cubic silica films have significant accessibility (larger than 26 % of geometric area). However, the double-gyroid films showed the highest diffusivity by over an order of magnitude. Both the (10) oriented 2 D hexagonal and (111) oriented rhombohedral films were found to be highly blocking with only small accessibility due to microporosity. The impedance data were also collected to study the stability of the nanoporous silica films in aqueous solutions as a function of pH.

This converts the Q(II) (D) phase into a Q(II) (G) phase with two coexisting orientations, with the and axes parallel to the symmetry axis, as demonstrated by small-angle X-ray scattering. The process can then be reversed, to recover the initial orientation of Q(II) (D) phase.

50|$|The {{reaction}} mechanism for an oxidation of an alcohol to an aldehyde {{according to the}} so-called hypervalent twisting mechanism involves a ligand exchange reaction replacing the hydroxyl group by the alcohol followed by a twist and an elimination reaction. The twist is a requirement because the iodine to oxygen <b>double</b> bond is <b>oriented</b> out of plane with the alkoxy group and the concerted elimination {{would not be able}} to take place. This twist reaction is a rearrangement in which the oxygen atom is moved into a proper plane for a 5 membered cyclic transition state in the elimination reaction and is calculated by Computational chemistry to be the rate-determining step in the oxidation. The twist mechanism also explains why oxidation is faster for larger alcohols than for small alcohols. The twist is driven forward by the steric hindrance that exists between the ortho hydrogen atom and the protons from the alkoxy group and larger alkoxy groups create larger steric repulsion. The same computation predicts a much faster reacting IBX derivative with a 100 fold reaction rate when this ortho hydrogen atom is replaced by a methyl group thus facilitating the twist until the elimination reaction takes prevalence as the rate determining step.|$|R

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this thesis was to validate the sustained counter air diffusion (SCAD) method at preventing natural circulation onset in diffusion dominated air ingress accidents. The analysis presented in this thesis starts with a vertically oriented rupture of a coaxial pipe. Air enters into the reactor cavity at a rate dictated by diffusion, until the buoyancy force {{is strong enough to}} initiate natural convective flow through the reactor. The SCAD method, developed by Yan et al. reduces the buoyancy force in a high temperature gas reactor (HTGR), during the lengthy diffusion phase, by injecting minute amounts of helium into the top of the reactor to set up a counter helium-air diffusion circuit. By delaying the onset of natural circulation, air enters the reactor only at diffusion transport rates, instead of much higher natural convection transport rates. Thus, the air ingress rate is reduced by several orders of magnitude. Without the continuous convective driven supply of "fresh" air the threat of oxidizing graphite components is significantly reduced. To validate SCAD a small scale simulated Pebble Bed Reactor (PBR) was constructed and a series of air ingress experiments with and without helium injection were conducted. In addition, Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) simulations were performed using FLUENT @ to model the experiment and gain further insight into the behavior of the flow field leading up to the onset of natural circulation. In order to have the CFD predicted natural circulation onset time better match the experimentally determined onset time, the initial helium fraction in the numerical model had to be reduced by 15 %. This reduction is within the uncertainty of the experimental set-up. This change helped display an important feature of the behavior of air ingress accidents. With the initial helium fraction in the simulated reactor at 100 % {{the first half of the}} transient is a very slow completely diffusion dominated transport phase. The second half of the transient had an air transport rate that had an increasing natural convective transport contribution leading up to the onset of natural circulation and complete natural convective transport. Reducing the initial helium fraction by only 15 % caused that initial very slow, pure diffusion transport phase to be bypassed and the natural circulation onset time was dictated by the combined effects of free convection and diffusion transport, not simply diffusion. A full scale PBR experiencing a similar accident will have the core entirely filled with helium. Thus, for a vertically <b>oriented</b> <b>double</b> ended guillotine (DEG) large-break loss of coolant accident (LB-LOCA) the subsequent air ingress rate will be dictated by the slow diffusion of air into the reactor cavity, for most of the transient. For the helium injection tests, even at the at the lowest tested injection rate, both the experiment and the CFD simulation showed that natural circulation was prevented over a time period twice as long as the time to onset. The tests showed that without helium injection, natural circulation started after about 117 minutes on average. With helium injection, natural circulation did not start after 240 minutes when the experiment was terminated. Additional injection tests were run where after 240 minutes the helium injection was terminated, but data continued to be taken. In these tests natural circulation was initiated in approximately 120 minutes after termination of helium injection confirming the helium injection flow was preventing natural circulation from starting. The lowest tested helium injection rate corresponded to 0. 01 % of the test assembly's total volume per minute, demonstrating how small of a flow rate is needed for the SCAD method to work. Minimal helium injection is not intended to be an emergency core cooling system but rather a system to prevent or delay natural circulation which would result in a large amount of air ingress. The system response was formulated non-dimensionally to quantify the impact SCAD has on the driving parameters that impact the onset of natural circulation, namely the buoyancy force, mass flow rate, and density ratio between the hot and cold leg. The results showed that SCAD suppresses the buoyancy force and forces a mass flow (transport) rate that causes any changes in the hot leg density to be counter-acted by density changes in the cold leg. The transport rate that is established is orders of magnitude less than the natural circulation transport rate. Using the driving nondimensional parameters, a methodology was also developed in order to formulate a correlation to estimate the minimum injection rate (MIR) of helium to prevent the onset of natural circulation. In order to properly derive a correlation for the MIR, further experiments and/or simulations are required over different geometrical configurations. The non-dimensional analysis showed that Yan's MIR estimate was conservative for the experimental configuration, and would be conservative for a full scale PBR. Therefore, Yan's MIR calculation was used to provide an order of magnitude estimate for the helium injection rate in a full scale PBR. The resulting MIR of helium for a full scale PBR was 5. 36 g/hr, which corresponds to storing only 11. 6 kg of helium on-site to prevent the onset of natural circulation for three full months. The experiment and CFD simulations were performed using an inverted U-tube which simulates a vertically oriented pipe configuration. If the pipe break occurs in a horizontal configuration, the air ingress phenomena could be substantially different depending on the break size and orientation. Thus, this thesis concludes that the method is capable of preventing natural circulation onset as long as air ingress occurs at transport rates comparable to diffusion after the break occurs. by Joseph Paul Yurko.
