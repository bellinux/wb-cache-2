500|$|... "Headlines (Friendship Never Ends)" [...] has {{received}} generally mixed reviews from music critics. Talia Kraines, writing for BBC Music was positive in her review, {{and called the}} song a [...] "classic Spice ballad". According to a writer from The Daily Collegian, [...] "for the naysayers, who say the Spice Girls time has passed, two new tunes, [...] "Headlines (Friendship Never Ends)" [...] and [...] "Voodoo" [...] may grab your attention". Nick Levine from Digital Spy commented in his positive review, [...] "'Headlines' won't be the first tune you skip to on the Spice Girls' Greatest Hits album – or, in all honesty, the tenth – but, as <b>its</b> <b>pretty,</b> gently melodic chorus surges gracefully, the feeling that comes over you is unmistakable. Nostalgia's a funny old thing, isn't it?" ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} positive reception from critics. Jenny Eliscu of Rolling Stone {{wrote that}} [...] "Rough Landing, Holly" [...] and [...] "Lights and Sounds", {{the latter being}} the title track, [...] "boast seismic alt-rock riffs and mosh-worthy refrains." [...] Tom Beaujor of Entertainment Weekly reported that the song was a [...] "blustery tale of puppy love gone to the dogs that will surely make for a great ringtone." [...] Sputnikmusic wrote: [...] "So how typical to have the next song, 'Rough Landing, Holly', slap you right on the mouth with a face-melting violin solo. Yeah, a violin solo. And <b>its</b> <b>pretty</b> damn good. The beat follows right along with impossible-sounding drum rolls while the guitar distortion is {{the backbone of the}} song." [...] In the Allmusic review, critic Heather Phares wrote, [...] "...Yellowcard expands on its expected sound. Songs like the title track, 'Rough Landing, Holly,' and 'Down on My Head' are tightly crafted, state-of-the-art examples of shiny, earnest punk-pop that sounds sunny even when it's sad". Tony Pascarella of AbsolutePunk.net noted that [...] "we see flashes of the 'old' band on 'Rough Landing, Holly', but it’s not nearly widespread enough for my liking (although the song is possibly the best one on the new album)." [...] Bart Gottula of The Clarion commented that the song [...] "is probably one of the best songs" [...] off Lights and Sounds and concluded that it was because of its [...] "effective use of every instrument, a soulful blend of guitar, and excellent lyrics." ...|$|E
500|$|After graduating, Hedlund {{signed with}} the Trenton Titans of the East Coast Hockey League for the final games of the 2001–02 season. He played in two games as a rookie and did not record a stat during the regular season, but in six playoff games he spent six minutes in the penalty box. In the 2002–03 season, he played in 13 games for Trenton {{recording}} a goal and two assists before he was called up to the American Hockey League's Binghamton Senators. In Binghamton, he played in 59 games scoring one goal and adding seven assists. On January 16, 2004, against the Albany River Rats, Hedlund broke a 17-game streak {{in which he had}} gone scoreless after he recorded his first career overtime goal and his second career game-winner. His previous goal was a game-winning shot against Syracuse. He ended the 2003–04 season with four goals and 19 assists in 80 games. Before the 2004–05 season, Hedlund spent time in training camp with the Ottawa Senators before he was reassigned to Binghamton. The NHL season would eventually be locked out which saw players such as goaltender Dominik Hašek join the AHL. When Hasek began working out with Binghamton, Hedlund commented, [...] "He's just one of the guys when he's here, he just wants to put in his time and get some good work in, and make sure he's ready to go, so you just got to appreciate a guy like that being here and doing that kind of work, so <b>its</b> <b>pretty</b> fun." [...] A season preview produced by the website Hockey's Future commented about Hedlund saying that, [...] "A fan-favorite, Hedlund gives it everything he has despite limited talent." [...] Against the Manitoba Moose on October 31, Hedlund scored a goal from the blue line that tied the game, however the Senators ended up losing 5–3. Following the season, he and Philadelphia Phantoms player Ben Stafford were named the AHL's Men of the Year. During the season he played in 75 games, scoring two goals with 13 assists. In the playoffs, he played in six games recording two assists.|$|E
