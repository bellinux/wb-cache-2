Although formally congratulated by the regime, Agârbiceanu fell out with its censorship apparatus. According to various accounts, he allowed the censors to operate multiple changes, {{as long as the}} substance of his writing was not itself altered. Portions of his work were cut out during reediting, and a novel, Prăbușirea ("The Downfall"), serialized in Gazeta Literară, was so crudely handled that seven of its pages were lost forever.|$|E
