25|$|Side reins {{are usually}} used for more {{advanced}} horses. They give the horse something {{to take contact}} with, encourage balance and correct <b>head</b> <b>carriage,</b> help develop self-carriage, and keep the horse from putting its head too low. Side reins may be attached from the bit to the surcingle rings, or from the bit to the billets of the girth.|$|E
25|$|Stepper motors {{were and}} still are often used in {{computer}} printers, optical scanners, and digital photocopiers to move the optical scanning element, the print <b>head</b> <b>carriage</b> (of dot matrix and inkjet printers), and the platen or feed rollers. Likewise, many computer plotters (which since the early 1990s have been replaced with large-format inkjet and laser printers) used rotary stepper motors for pen and platen movement; the typical alternatives here were either linear stepper motors or servomotors with closed-loop analog control systems.|$|E
2500|$|Western {{pleasure}} - {{the rider}} must show the horse {{together with other}} horses in an arena at a walk, jog (a slow, controlled trot), and lope (a slow, controlled canter). In some breed competitions, a judge may ask for an extended canter and/or a hand gallop, and, less often, {{an extension of the}} jog. [...] The horse must remain under control on a loose rein, with low <b>head</b> <b>carriage,</b> the rider directing the horse with nearly invisible aids and minimal interference.|$|E
5000|$|In the International Stakes, he {{was ignored}} by the betting public and started the race as a 28-1 {{outsider}} whilst the inexperienced three-year-old Sabrehill was made favourite. He produced an upset, however, making a strong run in the straight he [...] "swept past" [...] Sabrehill inside the last furlong to win the Group One prize by {{one and a half}} lengths. After the race his trainer, Michael Stoute, explained his view that the horse had been misunderstood: [...] "People think these horses with high <b>head</b> <b>carriages</b> are absolute crabs but that's not always the case. He's more lazy than anything else and he's answered the questions today".|$|R

50|$|The noseband is fitted {{into the}} bridle so {{has a certain}} amount of action, and is not on a {{separate}} headstall (also called sliphead) as is a cavesson. Harness bridles may feature a fancy browband, rosettes, and other ornamentation. An overcheck or sidecheck are sometimes used to control a horse’s <b>head</b> <b>carriage</b> and may be used in conjunction with an overcheck bit.|$|E
5000|$|A {{martingale}} is any {{of several}} designs of tack {{that are used}} on horses to control <b>head</b> <b>carriage.</b> Martingales {{may be seen in}} a wide variety of equestrian disciplines, both riding and driving. Rules for their use vary widely; in some disciplines they are never used, others allow them for schooling but not in judged performance, and some organizations allow certain designs in competition.|$|E
5000|$|Miniature Dachshunds are low to ground, long in {{body and}} short of leg, with robust muscular development. Where the muscles contract, {{the skin of the}} Miniature Dachshund is elastic and pliable without {{excessive}} wrinkling. Appearing neither crippled, awkward, nor cramped in his capacity for movement, the Miniature Dachshund is well-balanced with bold and confident <b>head</b> <b>carriage</b> and intelligent, alert facial expression. His keen nose gives him an advantage over most other breeds for trailing.|$|E

Carriage is designed with universal mounting platform so that slim tools, weld heads, or X-ray units can be interchanged without need for realinement...|$|R
50|$|Elasticized side reins {{are often}} used with {{training}} young horses prior to being ridden. They help accustom a horse to the feel {{of pressure on the}} bit, and reward the horse when it gives or flexes to bit pressure. Solid side reins are usually used for more advanced horses. They give the horse something to take contact with, encourage balance and correct <b>head</b> <b>carriage,</b> help a horse develop self-carriage, and help stop a horse from over-bending in the neck.|$|E
50|$|The {{movement}} of the scapula across the rib cage {{in relation to the}} humerus is known as the scapulohumeral rhythm, and this helps to achieve a further range of movement. This range can be compromised by anything that changes the position of the scapula. This could be an imbalance in parts of the large trapezius muscles that hold the scapula in place. Such an imbalance could cause a forward <b>head</b> <b>carriage</b> which in turn can affect the range of movements of the shoulder.|$|E

5000|$|The term {{bearing rein}} {{is derived from}} the {{definition}} of [...] "bearing" [...] which means [...] "the manner in which one bears or conducts one's self; mien; behavior; carriage." [...] The reference suggested that high <b>head</b> <b>carriage</b> was a sign of nobility or pride. However, 19th century critics of the bearing rein applied a pejorative meaning to the word, meaning [...] "patient endurance; suffering without complaint". Modern harness trainers prefer the more accurate terminology [...] "overcheck" [...] and [...] "check rein".|$|E

50|$|Different {{styles of}} noseband are fitted {{according}} to their purpose. A horse {{must be able to}} part its teeth and open its mouth slightly (not visible on the outside) in order to flex correctly at the jaw, relax and come onto the bit. An excessively tight noseband will prevent this. If a horse cannot relax its jaw, it will have problems with proper <b>head</b> <b>carriage,</b> and the rider may then try to force the horse into position by pulling back on the reins or using artificial leverage devices.|$|E
50|$|The {{widespread}} {{adoption of}} video-display terminals (VDTs) {{in the mid-1970s}} ushered {{in the second phase}} of command-line systems. These cut latency further, because characters could be thrown on the phosphor dots of a screen more quickly than a printer <b>head</b> or <b>carriage</b> can move. They helped quell conservative resistance to interactive programming by cutting ink and paper consumables out of the cost picture, and were to the first TV generation of the late 1950s and 60s even more iconic and comfortable than teleprinters had been to the computer pioneers of the 1940s.|$|R
60|$|He {{had entered}} the town, where the arcaded streets exuded their {{peculiar}} pungent smell of cows and leather, wood-smoke, wine-casks, and drains. The sound of rapid wheels over the stones made him turn his <b>head.</b> A <b>carriage</b> drawn by red-roan horses was passing at a great pace. People stared at it, standing still, and looking alarmed. It swung {{from side to side}} and vanished round a corner. Harz saw Mr. Nicholas Treffry in a long, whitish dust-coat; his Italian servant, perched behind, was holding to the seat-rail, with a nervous grin on his dark face.|$|R

50|$|Horses that {{naturally}} have an upright neck with high <b>head</b> <b>carriage,</b> {{as well as}} animated gaits and high action are best at saddle seat. They should be very energetic but still remain responsive to the rider's aids. Several breeds do well in this discipline, with the most well-known being the American Saddlebred. Other breeds commonly exhibited in saddle seat style are the National Show Horse, Tennessee Walking Horses, Racking Horses, Spotted Saddle Horses, Morgans, and Arabians. In addition, Hackneys, Dutch Harness Horses, Paso Finos, Missouri Foxtrotters, and Rocky Mountain Horses are sometimes shown in this discipline. Less often, Friesians and Andalusians are exhibited.|$|E
5000|$|At four Ezzoud {{had some}} successes, but began {{to acquire a}} {{reputation}} for unpredictability. His nervous demeanour and high, awkward <b>head</b> <b>carriage</b> lead many observers to question his temperament. He began by recording his first Group win in the Earl of Sefton Stakes at Newmarket, beating Cloud of Dust by {{one and a half}} lengths. He was then sent to Ireland, where he was made favourite for the Tattersalls Gold Cup (then a Group Two Race), but after taking the lead a furlong from the finish, he was caught in the last strides and beaten a short head by George Augustus. He was made favourite again in his next race, and again he disappointed his supporters, finishing unplaced in the Prince of Wales's Stakes at Royal Ascot.|$|E
50|$|Guttural pouch empyema is {{characterized}} by the accretion of purulent, bacteria infested exudate in the pouch. The bacteria is primarily Streptococcus equi, the infectious agent of strangles. Clinically apparent symptoms include painful swelling of the parotid area and recurrent infected nasal discharge, and in severe circumstances, difficulty breathing and abnormal <b>head</b> <b>carriage</b> may be observable. Fever, anorexia, difficulty swallowing and soft palate displacement {{may or may not be}} seen. Empyema is often secondary to guttural pouch tympany (distention of the pouches with air) in foals and weanlings. Arabians, in particular, are inclined to guttural pouch tympany, as many have a congenital defect in the pharyngeal orifices of the pouches. The infection can also be due to the rupture of the nearby retropharyngeal lymph nodes, usually caused by an abscess.|$|E
