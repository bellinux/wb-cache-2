40|$|Objective: To analyze {{predictive}} {{factors of}} acute urinary retention requiring catheterization after 125 I prostate brachytherapy. Methods:Agroupof 227 consecutivepatientswith localizedprostatecancerwere treatedwith 125 I prostate brachytherapy between September 2003 and December 2004. The clinical, treatment-related and dosimetric factors were evaluated {{for the need}} <b>for</b> <b>catheterization</b> owing to urinary retention. Results: Twelve patients (5. 3 %) required catheterization. The median time to onset was 2 days after implantation (range 1 – 7 days). Univariateanalysis demonstrated that pre-implant ultrasound prostate volume, number of seeds, number of needles and neoadjuvant hormonal manipulation were predictive <b>for</b> <b>catheterization.</b> In multivariate analysis, the number of needles and neoad-juvant hormonal manipulation were significant independent predictive factors <b>for</b> <b>catheterization</b> (P = 0. 002 and 0. 025, respectively). The risk of catheterization in the cluster in which the number of needles was> 24 was 4. 07 times as highas that in thecluster inwhich thenumberofneedleswas < 24 [11. 3 % versus 3. 0 %, P = 0. 020; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 24 – 13. 36], and the risk in the hormonally manipulated patients was 7. 05 times as high as that in the hormone-naı̈ve patients (7. 7 % versus 1. 2 %, P = 0. 034; 95 % CI 0. 89 – 55. 64). Conclusion: Our {{data suggest that the}} number of needles and hormonal manipulation might be the strongest predictors <b>for</b> <b>catheterization.</b> Key words: prostate cancer – brachytherapy – iodine- 125 – urinary morbidity – catheterizatio...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectivesWe {{sought to}} {{determine}} whether the stringent stress test criteria for crossover to cardiac catheterization in the conservative arm of the Fast Revascularization During Instability in Coronary Artery Disease (FRISC-II) trial subjected this strategy to a disadvantage by failing to identify patients with surgical coronary artery disease (CAD). BackgroundIn FRISC-II, an invasive strategy provided superior outcomes compared with a conservative strategy for patients with acute coronary syndromes. However, compared with the stress test criteria <b>for</b> crossover to <b>catheterization</b> in the Veterans Affairs Non–Q-Wave Infarction Strategies in Hospital (VANQWISH) trial, the FRISC-II criteria were more restrictive and did not use nuclear imaging or pharmacologic stress testing. MethodsWe analyzed the conservative arm of VANQWISH to identify the prevalence of surgical CAD in those patients who met the VANQWISH, but not FRISC-II, criteria <b>for</b> <b>catheterization.</b> ResultsOf 385 VANQWISH patients, 90 (23 %) met the FRISC-II criteria <b>for</b> <b>catheterization.</b> Another 98 patients (25 %) met only VANQWISH stress test criteria (60 patients by exercise and 38 by pharmacologic nuclear stress testing). Among subjects who underwent predischarge angiography, those meeting only VANQWISH stress test criteria had a high prevalence of surgical CAD (51 %), comparable to patients who met FRISC-II criteria (54 %, p = 0. 805). ConclusionsThe overly stringent risk stratification protocol for conservative-arm patients in FRISC-II could have failed to identify almost as many patients with surgical CAD as it identified. A lower threshold <b>for</b> <b>catheterization</b> in the FRISC-II conservative patients might have improved their outcomes and therefore diminished the putative benefit of an invasive strategy...|$|R
