5|$|Uxmal is a Mayan {{city in the}} Puuc Hills of Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico. The Governor's Palace at Uxmal {{is often}} used as an exemplar of why it is {{important}} to combine ethnographic and alignment data. The palace is aligned with an azimuth of 118° on the pyramid of Cehtzuc. This alignment corresponds approximately to the southernmost rising and, with a much greater precision, to the northernmost setting of Venus; both phenomena occur once every eight years. By itself this would not be sufficient to argue for a meaningful connection between the two events. The palace has to be aligned in one direction or another and why should the rising of Venus be any more important than the rising of the Sun, Moon, other planets, Sirius et cetera? The answer given <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>not</b> only does the palace point towards significant points of Venus, it is also covered in glyphs which stand for Venus and Mayan zodiacal constellations. Moreover, the great northerly extremes of Venus always occur in late April or early May, coinciding with the onset of the rainy season. The Venus glyphs placed in the cheeks of the Maya rain god Chac, most likely referring to the concomitance of these phenomena, support the west-working orientation scheme.|$|E

25|$|Abu Rawash is {{the site}} of Egypt's most northerly pyramid (other than the ruins of Lepsius pyramid number one)— the mostly ruined Pyramid of Djedefre, son and {{successor}} of Khufu. Originally it was thought that this pyramid had never been completed, but the current archaeological consensus <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>not</b> only was it completed, but that it was originally about {{the same size as the}} Pyramid of Menkaure, which would have placed it among the half-dozen or so largest pyramids in Egypt.|$|E

500|$|The {{main problem}} with this theory is that of {{erroneous}} representations. There are two unavoidable problems {{with the idea that}} [...] "a symbol expresses a property if it is ... necessary that all and only the presences of such a property cause the occurrences". The first <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>not</b> all horses cause occurrences of horse. The second <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>not</b> only horses cause occurrences of horse. Sometimes the A(horses) are caused by A (horses), but at other times—when, for example, because of the distance or conditions of low visibility, one has confused a cow for a horse—the A (horses) are caused by B (cows). In this case the symbol A doesn’t express just the property A, but the disjunction of properties A or B. The crude causal theory is therefore incapable of distinguishing the case in which the content of a symbol is disjunctive from the case in which it isn’t. This gives rise to what Fodor calls the [...] "problem of disjunction".|$|E

500|$|One {{deficiency}} {{of the classical}} derivative <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>not</b> very many functions are differentiable. Nevertheless, {{there is a way}} of extending the notion of the derivative so that all continuous functions and many other functions can be differentiated using a concept known as the weak derivative. The idea is to embed the continuous functions in a larger space called the space of distributions and only require that a function is differentiable [...] "on average".|$|E

500|$|Although Hypsilophodontidae was {{interpreted}} as a natural group in the early 1990s, this hypothesis has fallen out of favor and Hypsilophodontidae {{has been found to}} be an unnatural family composed of a variety of animals more or less closely related to Iguanodontia (paraphyly), with various small clades of closely related taxa. [...] "Hypsilophodontidae" [...] and [...] "hypsilophodont" [...] are better understood as informal terms for an evolutionary grade, not a true clade. Thescelosaurus has been regarded as both very basal and very derived among the hypsilophodonts. One issue that has potentially interfered with classifying Thescelosaurus <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>not</b> all of the remains assigned to T. neglectus necessarily belong to it. Clint Boyd and colleagues found that while the clade Thescelosaurus included the genus Bugenasaura and the species that had been assigned to that genus, there were at least two and possibly three species within Thescelosaurus, and several specimens previously assigned to T. neglectus could not yet be assigned to a species within the genus. It appears to be closely related to Parksosaurus.|$|E
500|$|Although Canning {{said that}} the {{announcement}} of Kurt as prom queen [...] "effectively caught [...] off guard, right in the gut, as good TV should", others were critical of the story at that moment, including Brown, who {{said that the}}re was no logic to Kurt's victory, no explanation of how it might have happened, and no sense in Figgins acceding to it. Semigran and VanDerWerff also called Figgins's actions into question. The sequence after the announcement was lauded by Fallon and Canning, who were impressed by the spliced presentation of multiple aftermaths. Poniewozik said it led to the episode's [...] "theme of community—that <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>not</b> all these characters' problems may be equal, but that they're best able to handle them when they recognize what they have in common. Everyone ... can feel like an outsider on prom night." [...] VanDerWerff also talked about the sense of community, which [...] "has mostly been absent in season two", and noted that [...] "Glee somehow found a way to show off the best AND worst of high school and worked past its own storytelling issues to capture raw emotion." ...|$|E
500|$|Weinberg rose {{to success}} as the drummer for Springsteen's E Street Band, as his {{powerful}} yet controlled beat solved the E Street Band's drumming instabilities. On Born to Run (1975), Weinberg's drumming evoked {{two of his}} idols, Ringo Starr and Levon Helm, and he covered his snare drum with heavy paper towels to capture some of the Memphis soul sound. While travelling on tour, Weinberg became known for his exact requests, such as specifying the particular brand of paper towels to use for his drums or the standards for his hotel rooms. Weinberg never adopted the [...] "rock and roll lifestyle"; he treated his music seriously and kept to the mantra, [...] "Show up, do a good job, and give them more than their money's worth." [...] One compromise Weinberg did have to make was sometimes playing on the High Holy Days. During shows, Springsteen built up the personas of his bandmates, and Weinberg was frequently referred to as [...] "the Mighty Max". Weinberg started a long practice of keeping his eyes on Springsteen every moment during the show, even when Springsteen was behind the stage, as he never knew when Springsteen would change a tempo or suddenly deviate from the set list. Decades later, E Street guitarist Steve Van Zandt would say of Weinberg, [...] "What nobody understands <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>not</b> only is Max a great drummer, Max reads Bruce's mind. You can't learn that." [...] Weinberg bought a house overlooking the water in Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey, triggering a lifelong interest in real estate and home design.|$|E

2500|$|For smaller photon fluxes, the {{photomultiplier}} can {{be operated}} in photon-counting, or Geiger, mode (see also Single-photon avalanche diode). In Geiger mode the photomultiplier gain is set so high (using high voltage) {{that a single}} photo-electron resulting from a single photon incident on the primary surface generates a very large current at the output circuit. However, owing to the avalanche of current, a reset of the photomultiplier is required. In either case, the photomultiplier can detect individual photons. The drawback, however, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>not</b> every photon incident on the primary surface is counted either because of less-than-perfect efficiency of the photomultiplier, or because a second photon can arrive at the photomultiplier during the [...] "dead time" [...] associated with a first photon and never be noticed.|$|E
