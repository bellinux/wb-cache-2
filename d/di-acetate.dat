50|$|Sodium lauroamphoacetate is {{produced}} in a 2 step process. Firstly lauric acid reacts with aminoethylethanolamine (AEEA); this initially produces the amide however heating causes this to cyclize to give the imidazoline group. This reacts with 1 equivalent of sodium chloroacetate to give the final product. A reaction with 2 equivalents gives the <b>di-acetate,</b> which is also marketed as di-sodium lauroamphoacetate.|$|E

40|$|The electrodimerisation of acroleine on a zinc‐copper {{couple in}} the {{presence}} of acetic acid gives 1, 5 ‐hexadiene‐ 3, 4 ‐diol 5 in 76 % yield, the ratio meso/dl being 60 / 40. Gas chromatographic analysis of the reaction mixture reveals the presence of threo‐ and erythro‐ 1 ‐hexene‐ 3, 4 ‐diol and of the mono‐ and <b>di‐acetates</b> (meso/dl) of 4, especially when large quantities of acetic acid are used. Optimum conditions are described in order to minimize these side‐reactions. Starting from 4, two new routes to 1, 3, 5 ‐hexatriene 1 has been developped, namely by treating the bistosylate derivative of 4 with sodium iodide in 2 ‐(2 ‐ethoxy‐ethoxy) ethanol (adaptation of Linstead's reaction) and by a modification of Corey's method, where 4 is treated with N′, N′‐thiocarbonyl‐diimidazole and the resulting cyclic thiocarbonate decomposed in triphenylphosphite. Hexatriene is obtained respectively in 52 and 47 % overall yield, the cis/trans ratios being 10 / 90 and 20 / 80. Although these reaction schemes appear to be non‐stereospecific, they constitute two new valuable methods to cis‐ 1, 3, 5 ‐hexatriene. Copyright © 1974 Wiley‐VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

40|$|A general {{survey was}} carried out on the sediments of {{seventeen}} lakes, ranging from oligotrophic to eutrophic, in the English Lake District. Several variables not directly concerned with the population of bacteria were measured to provide background information. Estimates {{of the total population}} of bacteria and of the population of filamentous bacteria were made using direct counts with acridine orange and fluorescein <b>di-acetate,</b> and counts by an MPN technique. The counts with acridine orange showed an upward trend with increasing degree of enrichment of the lakes, particularly at the eutrophic end of the spectrum. The distribution pattern obtained with the fluorochrome fluorescein <b>di-acetate</b> was different with an apparent upward trend in the intermediate lakes. The viable counts of the bacterial population in the sediments did not agree with the ranking of the lakes according to published information from the Freshwater Biological Association, although a slight upward trend was observed in the distribution of the viable filamentous bacteria. The preliminary survey led to the selection of three lakes representing the oligrotrophic, mesotrophic and eutrophic states in which a more detailed investigation on the population of filamentous bacteria was made. The profundal and littoral zones of the three lakes were investigated particularly in relation to the different groups of filamentous bacteria and their vertical distribution in the sediments. The groups of filamentous bacteria were described based on morphological and cytochemical tests. A tentative key for identification of filamentous bacteria was devised...|$|E

Esterification is the general name for a chemical reaction in which two reactants ethylene glycol and acetic acid form an ester as a product. Since the reaction was occurred in equilibrium and reversible manner, the reaction was become slowly without catalyst. The reaction {{was carried out in}} the presence of Seralite SRC- 120 and Molecular Sieve 13 x as acid catalyst with investigated temperature range from 333 to 363 K and varying amount of 0. 5 wt% to 2. 0 wt% catalyst load. It was found that as increase reaction time as increase mole fraction of product, conversion of reactant and selectivity of ethylene glycol <b>di-acetate</b> (EGDA) but decrease the selectivity of ethylene glycol mono-acetate (EGMA). The maximum conversion of acetic acid and ethylene glycol were obtained 46. 12 % and 100 % during 10 hour reaction time with 1. 5 wt% amount of catalyst loading respectively. But Molecular sieve 13 x has been given only 78 % conversion of ethylene glycol with 4. 0 wt% catalyst loading The selectivity of ethylene glycol <b>di-acetate</b> has been observed 66 percentages with amount of 0. 5 wt% Seralite SRC- 120 as a catalyst.

40|$|Objectives: We have {{investigated}} {{the use of a}} viability dye, chloromethylfluorescein <b>di-acetate</b> (CMFDA), for antifungal susceptibility testing in a fluorescence microplate (FM) assay format. Methods: For this FM assay, conidia were incubated in increasing concentrations of antifungal drug for 16 h and stained with CMFDA. Fluorescence, measured as mean fluorescence units (MFU) in a fluorescence microplate reader, was graphed relative to that of a drug-free control, and the MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of the drug that resulted in complete reduction (100 %) in MFU for amphotericin B, or 90 % reduction in MFU for itraconazole and voriconazole. Susceptibilities of 10 clinical isolates of Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus terreus and Aspergillus niger to amphotericin B, itraconazole and voriconazole were tested in a blinded fashion using the FM and the NCCLS methods.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of multi-drug-resistant bacteria, {{coupled with the}} lack of new antibiotics in development, is fast evolving into a global crisis. New strategies utilizing existing antibacterial agents are urgently needed. We propose one such strategy in which four outmoded β-lactam antibiotics (ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalothin and oxacillin) and a well-known antiseptic (chlorhexidine <b>di-acetate)</b> were fashioned into a group of uniform materials based on organic salts (GUMBOS) as an alternative to conventional combination drug dosing strategies. The antibacterial activity of precursor ions (e. g., chlorhexidine diacetate and β-lactam antibiotics), GUMBOS and their unreacted mixtures were studied with 25 clinical isolates with varying antibiotic resistance using a micro-broth dilution method. Acute cytotoxicity and therapeutic indices were determined using fibroblasts, endothelial and cervical cell lines. Intestinal permeability was predicted using a parallel artificial membrane permeability assay. GUMBOS formed from ineffective β-lactam antibiotics and cytotoxic chlorhexidine diacetate exhibited unique pharmacological properties and profound antibacterial activity at lower concentrations than the unreacted mixture of precursor ions at equivalent stoichiometry. Reduced cytotoxicity to invasive cell types commonly found in superficial and chronic wounds was also observed using GUMBOS. GUMBOS show promise as an alternative combination drug strategy for treating wound infections caused by drug-resistant bacteria...|$|E
40|$|Inter-cropping {{mustard and}} oilseed radish in potato {{production}} {{has been shown}} to suppress potato cyst nematode (PCN) reproduction in field plots. This suppressive effect is mostly attributed to the release of glucosinolate (GSL) hydrolysis products such as isothiocyanates, following chopping and incorporation of the crop biomass. This study examined the degradation of sinigrin introduced into soil where Indian mustard and oilseed radish were cultivated and the effect on PCN suppression. Glucosinolate degradation was measured by introducing sinigrin into the soil samples pre-planting, pre- and post-incorporation of the brassicas, while the soil microbial activity was quantified as the concentration of fluorescein <b>di-acetate</b> (FDA) g− 1 oven dry soil. Sinigrin was significantly (P < 0. 001) degraded pre- and post-incorporation of the brassicas cultivated in unsterilized soil. The total microbial activity increased significantly (P < 0. 001) pre- and post-incorporation of brassicas when compared with fallow controls. Unsterilized soils planted with oilseed radish resulted in a significant (P < 0. 027) suppression of G. pallida encysted eggs (30 – 35 % mortality). Microbial activity correlated positively with G. pallida mortality (R 2 = 0. 94, P < 0. 001), but inversely with sinigrin degradation. This study has revealed that brassicas used for biofumigation may affect soil borne pests and pathogens not just after incorporation of the crop residues, but also during active growth of these plants...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAbstractBackgroundCulture {{collapse}} due to {{high temperatures}} can significantly impact the profitability of outdoor algal cultivation systems. The objective {{of this study was}} to model for the first time the impact of high temperatures on algal activity and viability. ResultsViability measurements on Dunaliella salina cultures were based on cytometry with two fluorescent markers (erythrosine and fluorescein <b>di-acetate),</b> and photosynthetic activity was measured by Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM) fluorometry. Kinetic studies revealed that viability and activity losses during exposure to high temperatures could be described by a Weibull model. Both mortality and activity were shown to be functions of the thermal dose received by the algae, defined as the product of duration of exposure to high temperatures and an exponential function of temperature. Simulations at five climatic locations revealed that culture collapse {{due to high}} temperatures could impact productivity of D. salina in non-temperature-controlled outdoor photobioreactors by 35 and 40 % in arid and Mediterranean climates, respectively. ConclusionsThe model developed in this study can be used to forecast the impact of high temperatures on algal biofuel productivity. When coupled with models predicting the temperature of outdoor cultivation systems, this model can also be used to select the best combination of location, system geometry, and algal species to minimize the risks of culture collapse and therefore maximize biofuel productivity...|$|E
40|$|Several {{lines of}} {{indirect}} evidence {{have suggested that}} nitric oxide may {{play an important role}} during light adaptation of the vertebrate retina. We aimed to verify directly the effect of light on nitric oxide release in the isolated carp retina and to investigate the relationship between nitric oxide and dopamine, an established neuromodulator of retinal light adaptation. Using a biochemical nitric oxide assay, we found that steady or flicker light stimulation enhanced retinal nitric oxide production from a basal level. The metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist L-amino- 4 -phosphonobutyric acid, inhibited the light adaptation-induced nitric oxide production suggesting that the underlying cellular pathway involved centre-depolarizing bipolar cell activity. Application of exogenous dopamine to retinas in the dark significantly enhanced the basal production of nitric oxide and importantly, inhibition of endogenous dopaminergic activity completely suppressed the light-evoked nitric oxide release. The effect of dopamine was mediated through the D 1 receptor subtype. Imaging of the nitric oxide-sensitive fluorescent indicator 4, 5 -diaminofluorescein <b>di-acetate</b> in retinal slices revealed that activation of D 1 receptors resulted in nitric oxide production from two main spatial sources corresponding to the photoreceptor inner segment region and the inner nuclear layer. The results taken together would suggest that during the progression of retinal light adaptation there is a switch from dopaminergic to nitrergic control, probably to induce further neuromodulatory effects at higher levels of illumination and to enable more efficient spreading of the light adaptive signal...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the project}} was to develop a small {{production}} platform for citronellal processing. The objective {{of the study was to}} develop a single continuous flow reactor system for the synthesis of novel derivatives of citronellal and isopulegol. The first step was to develop a continuous flow reactor system for the isopulegol synthesis. The stainless steel tubular fixed-bed reactor equipped with a reaction column (I. D: 9. 53 mm and length: 120 mm) was used for the study. The reactor column was packed with H-ZMS- 5 zeolite extrusion catalyst. The solvent-free cyclisation reaction of citronellal was investigated and at optimum conditions, 100 % of citronellal conversion and almost 100 % selectivity towards isopulegol was achieved. A good catalytic performance was observed from the H-ZSM- 5 catalyst and proved to be stable for a prolonged reaction time. The second reaction step was to develop a continuous flow reactor system for the synthesis of isopulegyl-ether derivatives. A UniQsis FlowSyn reactor system equipped with a stainless steel reactor column was used for the study. The reactor column was packed with amberlyst- 15 dry catalyst. Wherein, n-propanol was employed as a model etherifying agent and as a reaction solvent. At optimum reaction condition, only 30 % selectivity of isopulegyl propoxy-ether was achieved. The reaction was found to depend highly on temperature and residence time. The increase of these parameters was found to increase the side reactions and reduced the selectivity of the desired product. Other heterogeneous catalysts such as H-beta zeolite, aluminium pillared clay, Aluminium oxide and H-ZSM- 5 were also evaluated in the reaction. Among these catalysts, a catalytic activity was observed with H-beta zeolite (19 %) and aluminium pillared clay (5 %). Based on these results, none of the evaluated catalysts provided the desired selectivity (greater than 70 %) towards the isopulegyl propoxy-ether, therefore the process was not investigated further. In light of this, the isopulegol etherification synthetic route was terminated. Consequently, another analogue of citronellal was used as an alternative intermediate in place of isopulegol, namely para-menthane- 3, 8 -diol (PMD). The initial studies for the synthesis of the novel PMD di-esters from isopulegol were performed in the batch-scale reactor. In a solvent-free reaction, acetic anhydride was initially used as a model acetylating agent. The reaction was performed using polymer-bound scandium triflate (PS-Sc(OTf) 3) catalyst. The effect of reaction parameters such as temperature, molar ratio, and reaction time were studied towards the PMD conversion and di-esters selectivity. At optimum reaction conditions, PMD conversion of 70 % and <b>di-acetate</b> selectivity of 67 % were observed. The reaction was found to follow the zeroth-order kinetics with respect to PMD conversion and obeyed the Arrhenius equation. Other types of di-ester derivatives were synthesized from PMD by varying the carbon chain length of the acetylating agent. The prepared compounds were separated from the product mixtures by vacuum distillation, purified on a column chromatography and characterised by FT-IR, GC-MS, and 1 H-NMR, 13 C-NMR. The developed methodology was optimised in flow by using an ArrheniumOne microwave-assisted continuous-flow fixed-bed reactor system. A detailed experimental design was used to carry-out the reactions. The reaction parameters such as temperature and flow-rate were studied towards the PMD conversion and di-ester selectivity. From the experimental design analysis, the di-ester selectivity was found to depend highly on the residence time (flow-rate) and significantly on temperature. The PMD conversion and di-ester selectivity were found to increase with decrease in the flow-rate. The conversion and selectivity achieved in the continuous flow process were significantly higher than the achieved in the batch-scale process with respect to the residence time...|$|E
