25|$|Rising Storm {{was mostly}} well {{received}} by critics. In one review by Booklist, the reviewer calls the novel suspenseful, also noting {{how the story}} echoes the journey to maturity. Another review, by VOYA, noted that while the books lacks humor and depth, there was still appeal in the hidden world of the warrior cats. A BookLoons review particularly praised the ending, calling it a cliffhanger. However, Children's Literature was not as positive, saying it was getting <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> all of the characters' relatives and leaders.|$|E
500|$|The {{eventual}} {{winner was}} Viktor Radugin's [...] "Be glorious, Russia" [...] (Славься, Россия! ("Slavsya, Rossiya!)). However, {{none of the}} lyrics were officially adopted by Yeltsin or the Russian government. One {{of the reasons that}} partially explained the lack of lyrics was the original use of Glinka's composition: the praise of the Tsar and of the Russian Orthodox Church. Other complaints raised about the song were that it was <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember,</b> uninspiring, and musically complicated. It {{was one of the few}} national anthems that lacked official lyrics during this period. [...] The only other wordless national anthems in the period from 1990 to 2000 were [...] "My Belarusy" [...] of Belarus (until 2002), [...] "Marcha Real" [...] of Spain, and [...] "Intermeco" [...] of Bosnia and Herzegovina ...|$|E
500|$|The album {{title is}} rooted in the idea of [...] "yielding to nature," [...] a theme central to Daniel Quinn's novel Ishmael. The band members read the book while working on the album. Regarding the title, McCready said, [...] "I think the title Yield has to do with maybe being more {{comfortable}} within ourselves, with this band....we're all a little bit older and a little more relaxed and maybe just kind of yielding to those anxieties and not trying to fight it so much...That's what it kind of feels to me– yielding, letting something else happen and going with it." [...] Vedder said, [...] "Let's say that hypothetically speaking, the title does mean something...You can fight so much, {{and then you have to}} think, 'What are the real battles?' 'What's really important?' You get to a certain point, and it's really <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> what music is and to remember what drives you." ...|$|E
50|$|In {{the study}} of aging, Patrick Rabbitt {{proposed}} an effortfulness hypothesis in the 1960s: that as their hearing became less acute with age, people would require additional effort to make out what was said and that this effort made it <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> it.|$|R

Because of this, recital of longer gin is sometimes {{seen as more}} accomplished (being <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember,</b> {{and more likely to}} vary from the standard melodic form). The vocal may be accompanied by traditional Japanese instruments such as the Koto or Shakuhachi. Dress may be Western (suit) or traditional (kimono or yukata).|$|R
50|$|According to {{the journal}} of Law and Human Behaviour, {{children}} who have been through traumatic events will find it <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> a regular event as opposed to a non-traumatic event. In a study conducted by Goodman, they found that non-abused children were more accurate in answering specific questions and made fewer errors in identifying an unfamiliar person in pictures.|$|R
500|$|Ikumi created other girl–animal {{combinations}} while {{designing the}} four other Mew Mews, including a mouse girl with the same green coloring as Retasu. However, the mouse design {{was one of several}} designs rejected for use in the series as the choices were narrowed down. Once the main Mew Mew designs were finalized, Ikumi named them after various foods: Ichigo (Strawberry), Minto (Mint), Retasu (Lettuce), Bu-Ling (Pudding), and Zakuro (Pomegranate). During one of the project meetings, an unnamed editor remarked that the names might be <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> and suggested naming the characters after various colors instead, but the food names were kept. Although Ikumi initially suggested calling Ichigo's main attack [...] "Strawberry Bell Bell" [...] as a joke, the editorial team thought it was funny and kept the name. Ikumi noted that future attack names were decided by which sounded funniest. The only character from Ikumi's Tokyo Black Cat Girl to retain his original name and general appearance was Masha, but his gender was changed to female in Tokyo Mew Mew.|$|E
500|$|Since Zelenka's first appearance, David Nykl's fluent Czech was {{worked into}} Stargate Atlantis {{as part of}} Zelenka. Approximately half of Zelenka's Czech lines were scripted (in English), which Nykl then {{translated}} verbatim. The other half was ad-libbed and usually included swearing. His usual Czech exclamations include [...] and [...] Nykl normally speaks with a Canadian accent, but Zelenka had a thick Czech accent; Nykl found it increasingly <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> {{to put on the}} accent as the show went on. The late season 1 episode [...] "Letters from Pegasus" [...] features a minute-long non-subtitled monologue in which Zelenka describes the city of Atlantis in his mothertongue. Nykl translated the scripted monologue at home and performed it in Czech the next day. A version in English was initially planned to be filmed but was dropped after Nykl's successful first take. The end of Zelenka's video message ("drž se miláčku" [...] "take care, darling") was ad-libbed, but Nykl left it to the writers to create Zelenka's backstory. But during the show's run, Zelenka only ever mentions having a brother, a sister, and a nephew, and is never shown to be or have been in a romantic relationship.|$|E
500|$|Between 2013 and 2016, Sheen {{starred in}} and {{produced}} Showtime's Masters of Sex. He and Lizzy Caplan portrayed the 1960s human sexuality pioneers Masters and Johnson; the series chronicled [...] "their unusual lives, romance and pop culture trajectory, which saw them {{go from a}} Midwestern teaching hospital to the cover of Time magazine and Johnny Carson's couch". David Sims of The Atlantic described Sheen's portrayal of Masters as [...] "an intensely honest and unsympathetic one" [...] while Sonia Saraiya of The A.V. Club said Sheen played the role [...] "so seamlessly it's <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> that there's a British actor there who has played flamboyant news personalities and prime ministers." [...] Sean T. Collins of The Observer described Masters as [...] "a singularly unappealing figure": [...] "It's not that Michael Sheen is bad in the role. On the contrary! Sheen's skill in playing Masters as an asshole who oscillates between headache-inducing self-repression and volcanic rage renders him unpleasant {{to spend more than}} two minutes with at a time." [...] Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter remarked: [...] "Masters has never been very likable. In fact, it's a testament to Sheen's performance — and Caplan's nuanced Johnson offsetting Masters — that anyone still cares what happens to Masters on a personal level." [...] He received a Golden Globe nomination for his performance in late 2013.|$|E
5000|$|... "An actor’s {{greatest}} attribute {{is to have}} a good memory, but I've {{always had}} a bad one." [...] That didn’t stop him from working that much <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> his lines on stage and screen, and it was some old-fashioned blood, sweat and tears that brought the brothers their success. He has three children; his daughter Jodie Yemm is an actress.|$|R

500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{stated that}} Moore [...] "has the {{superficial}} attributes for the job: The urbanity, the quizzically raised eyebrow, the calm under fire and in bed". However, {{he felt that}} Moore wasn't satisfactory in living up to the legacy left by Sean Connery in the preceding films. He rated the villains [...] "a little banal", adding that the film [...] "doesn't have a Bond villain worthy of the Goldfingers, Dr. Nos and Oddjobs of the past." [...] Chris Nashawaty similarly argues that Dr. Kananga/Mr. Big is the worst villain of the Roger Moore James Bond films. BBC Films reviewer William Mager praised the use of locations, but said that the plot was [...] "convoluted". He stated that [...] "Connery and Lazenby had an air of concealed thuggishness, clenched fists at the ready, but in Moore's case a sardonic quip and a raised eyebrow are his deadliest weapons". Reviewer Leonard Maltin rated the film {{two and a half}} stars out of four, describing it as a [...] "barely memorable, overlong James Bond movie" [...] that [...] "seems merely an excuse to film wild chase sequences". Danny Peary noted that Jane Seymour portrays [...] "one of the Bond series's most beautiful heroines" [...] but had little praise for Moore, whom he described as making [...] "an unimpressive debut as James Bond in Tom Mankiewicz's unimaginative adaptation of Ian Fleming's second novel…The movie stumbles along most of the way. It's <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> Moore is playing Bond at times – in fact, if he and Seymour were black, the picture could pass as one of the black exploitation films of the day. There are few interesting action sequences – a motorboat chase is trite enough to begin with, but the filmmakers make it worse by throwing in some stupid Louisiana cops, including pot-bellied Sheriff Pepper." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{an article}} in The New Yorker, Adelman said of Rumsfeld, a friend and {{associate}} of 36 years: “How could this happen to someone so good, so competent? This war made me doubt the past. Was I wrong all those years, or was he just better back then? The Donald Rumsfeld of today is not the Donald Rumsfeld I knew, but maybe I was wrong about the old Donald Rumsfeld. It’s a terrible way to end a career. It’s <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember,</b> but he was once the future.” ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{traditional}} {{method is}} ultimately faster {{and much more}} compact; but it requires two significantly more difficult multiplications which pupils may at first struggle with [...] Compared to the grid method, traditional long multiplication may also be more abstract and less manifestly clear , so some pupils find it <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> what is <b>to</b> be done at each stage and why [...] Pupils may therefore be encouraged for quite a period to use the simpler grid method alongside the more efficient traditional long multiplication method, as a check and a fall-back.|$|R
5000|$|Dan Lucas of Drowned in Sound {{was more}} {{critical}} of the album, stating, [...] "Life of Pause sounds effortless {{but not in a}} good way: it sounds like a de rigueur acclaimed indie album. It sounds like a record that’s designed to be acclaimed and liked but not remembered. The extra spark that made the likes of ‘Chinatown, ‘Paradise’ or ‘The Body in Rainfall’ such magnificent, memorable tracks is missing here. It is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> criticise such a well-crafted, enjoyable album that appears to have been made specifically with someone like me in mind. The thing is that in six weeks’ time it will be even <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> it." ...|$|R
2500|$|When {{questioned}} about which songs he played on, especially ones where there exists some controversy {{as to what}} his exact role was, Page often points {{out that it is}} <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> exactly what he did given the enormous number of sessions he was playing at the time. In a radio interview he explained that [...] "I was doing three sessions a day, fifteen sessions a week. Sometimes I would be playing with a group, sometimes I could be doing film music, it could be a folk session... I was able to fit all these different roles." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, Carol's {{policy was}} doomed by the {{reluctance}} of France and Britain to fight wars with the totalitarian powers of Germany, Italy and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union attacked Romania and declared the annexation of Bukovina and Bessarabia (which was to be renamed Moldova), and when Carol turned to the only possible hope - that is, assistance from the former [...] "eternal foe", Nazi Germany - he was angrily rejected by Hitler personally, {{who did not have}} to try <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> how Carol had previously humiliated the cause of his ideology. Carol was forced to acknowledge the annexation, leading directly to his overthrow in a coup led by Ion Antonescu.|$|E

50|$|The SuperMemo program stores a {{database}} of questions and answers constructed by the user. When reviewing information saved in the database, the program uses the SuperMemo algorithm to decide what questions to show the user. The user then answers the question and rates their recall - did they answer the question easily, with hesitation, not at all, and so on - and their rating {{is used to calculate}} how soon they should be shown the question again.

2500|$|The <b>hardest</b> {{passwords}} <b>to</b> crack, {{for a given}} {{length and}} character set, are random character strings; if long enough they resist brute force attacks (because there are many characters) and guessing attacks (due to high entropy). However, such passwords are typically the <b>hardest</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember.</b> The imposition of a requirement for such passwords in a password policy may encourage users to write them down, store them in PDAs or cellphones, or share them with others as a safeguard against memory failure. While some people consider each of these user resorts to increase security risks, others suggest the absurdity of expecting users <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> distinct complex passwords {{for each of the}} dozens of accounts they access. For example, in 2005, security expert Bruce Schneier recommended writing down one's password: ...|$|R
50|$|Each show {{starts with}} the host giving a 'difficult-to-spell' word and an example {{mnemonic}} <b>to</b> help <b>remember</b> that spelling, {{and by the end}} of the show the panellists have to have devised their own. In episode one Julian Fellowes gave the example arithmetic: A Rat In The House Might Eat The Ice Cream; and Ned Sherrin's version (which earned his team the win as the final points were tied) was: As Richard Interred The Head Master Every Tiny Infant Cheered. By the end of series 1, even Julian Fellowes had realized that these so-called mnemonics were invariably <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> than the spellings - particularly as they were rarely related to the words in question.|$|R

Reid told the Times that Sidarth only received a nickname from Allen campaign staff because he would not give his real name. Interviewed that day on CNN, however, Sidarth recalled shaking Allen's hand {{earlier in the week}} and giving his name. [...] "He's very good with names, legendarily. He tries very <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> peoples' names when meeting them," [...] Sidarth said.

2500|$|Vladimir stands {{through most}} of the play whereas Estragon sits down {{numerous}} times and even dozes off. [...] "Estragon is inert and Vladimir restless." [...] Vladimir looks at the sky and muses on religious or philosophical matters. Estragon [...] "belongs to the stone", preoccupied with mundane things, what he can get to eat and how to ease his physical aches and pains; he is direct, intuitive. He finds it <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> but can recall certain things when prompted, e.g., when Vladimir asks: [...] "Do you remember the Gospels?" [...] Estragon tells Vladimir about the coloured maps of the Holy Land and that he planned to honeymoon by the Dead Sea; it is his short-term memory that is poorest and points {{to the fact that he}} may, in fact, be suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Al Alvarez writes: [...] "But perhaps Estragon's forgetfulness is the cement binding their relationship together. He continually forgets, Vladimir continually reminds him; between them they pass the time." [...] They have been together for fifty years but when asked–by Pozzo–they do not reveal their actual ages.|$|E
2500|$|In {{an attempt}} to show that Vanzetti's {{revolver}} {{was taken from the}} slain Berardelli, the prosecution traced the history of Berardelli's [...]38 Harrington & Richardson (H) revolver. Berardelli's wife testified {{that she and her husband}} dropped off the gun for repair at the Iver Johnson Co. of Boston a few weeks before the murder. According to the foreman of the Iver Johnson repair shop, Berardelli's revolver was given a repair tag with the number of 94765, and this number was recorded in the repair logbook with the statement [...] "H. & R. revolver, [...]38-calibre, new hammer, repairing, half an hour". However, the shop books did not record the gun's serial number, and the caliber was apparently incorrectly labeled as [...]32 instead of [...]38-caliber. The shop foreman testified that a new spring and hammer were put into Berardelli's Harrington & Richardson revolver. The gun was claimed and the half-hour repair paid for, though the date and identity of the claimant were not recorded. After examining Vanzetti's [...]38 revolver, the foreman testified that Vanzetti's gun had a new replacement hammer in keeping with the repair performed on Berardelli's revolver. The foreman explained that the shop was always kept busy repairing 20 to 30 revolvers per day, which made it very <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> individual guns or keep reliable records of when they were picked up by their owners. But, he said that unclaimed guns were sold by Iver Johnson at the end of each year, and the shop had no record of an unclaimed gun sale of Berardelli's revolver. To reinforce the conclusion that Berardelli had reclaimed his revolver from the repair shop, the prosecution called a witness who testified that he had seen Berardelli in possession of a [...]38 nickel-plated revolver the Saturday night before the Braintree robbery.|$|E
5000|$|Miller {{recognized}} that the correspondence between the limits of one-dimensional absolute judgment and of short-term memory span was only a coincidence, because only the first limit, not the second, can be characterized in information-theoretic terms (i.e., as a roughly constant number of bits). Therefore, there is nothing [...] "magical" [...] about the number seven, and Miller used the expression only rhetorically. Nevertheless, {{the idea of a}} [...] "magical number 7" [...] inspired much theorizing, rigorous and less rigorous, about the capacity limits of human cognition. Nonetheless, the number seven constitutes a useful heuristic, reminding us that lists that are much longer than that become significantly <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> and process simultaneously.|$|R
50|$|In 2006 {{the band}} home {{recorded}} Let It Loose, a demo EP, which was successful locally. Their next demo EP, Money City Blues, had minor {{local and national}} radio airplay in 2007. Later that year an offer was rumoured to arise from American country singer Ben Kweller to record their album. The band renamed themselves The Howlin' Novocaines (with influence by blues artist Howlin' Wolf) as not to clash with an overseas band also named The Novocaines. The band then joined the Australian band The Vasco Era on national tour through Australia. While on tour they changed their name back, stating that fans found the longer name <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> (because they were all goldfish).|$|R
50|$|The {{preferred}} web {{authentication system}} for web applications is the password, despite its poor usability and several security concerns. This widely used system usually contains mechanisms that {{were intended to}} increase security (e.g. requiring users to have high entropy passwords) but lead to password systems being less usable and inadvertently less secure. This is because users find these high entropy passwords <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember.</b> Application creators {{need to make a}} paradigm shift to develop more usable authentication systems that take the user’s needs into account. Replacing the ubiquitous password based systems with more usable (and possibly more secure) systems could lead to major benefits for both the owners of the application and its users.|$|R
2500|$|Generally, {{the band}} improvised {{late at night}} and in very dim light, working on [...] "huge" [...] reels of tape, so that they, Eno and Dravs could play for over an hour without needing to change reels. According to Eno, [...] "strange new worlds took shape out of bewildering deserts of confusion, consolidated, lived gloriously {{for a few minutes and}} then crumbled away." [...] They never tried making {{anything}} twice: [...] "once it had gone, we went somewhere else." [...] Ben Fenner, who was engineering the sessions, [...] "attentively and unobtrusively coped" [...] with unpredictable instrument and level changes in near-total darkness, leaving the band and the producers to [...] "wander around our new landscapes." [...] Dravs generally worked on the material alone, improvising at the studio console, as James and Eno were busy recording Laid, but as Laid neared completion, the band and Eno spent more time in the [...] "wild" [...] studio where Wah Wah was being edited, where they worked long days, but there was [...] "always enough going on to prevent any loss of momentum," [...] and [...] "things happened very quickly." [...] Eno completed his mixes for the jams in a single afternoon, where he spent time trying to [...] "get a little of each jam onto DAT because there was so much new work flying around that it was <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> it all." [...] He had made 55 mixes that day and never mixed anything twice, not expecting to use these mixes for the final album, but he decided that this fast, impulsive way of working was [...] "right in the spirit of the performances," [...] and that the results, as he described them, [...] "often make a cinematic, impressionistic counterpoint to the elaborate post-industrial drama of Markus' mixes." [...] He commented that [...] "they set each other off well: the combination feels like being at the edge of somewhere - where industry merges with landscape, metal with space, corrupted machinery with unsettled weather patterns, data-noise with insect chatter." ...|$|E

Ricks writes:Dylan's is an art in which sins are laid bare (and resisted), virtues are valued (and manifested), and the graces brought home. The seven deadly sins, the four cardinal virtues (<b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember?),</b> and the three heavenly graces: these make up everybody's world, but Dylan's in particular.
