40|$|The {{present study}} {{involves}} {{modifications to the}} nucleic acid backbone in which {{one or more of}} the phosphodiester oxygen atoms are substituted with methylene groups. Nucleic acids modified in this manner are expected to be isosteric with their natural counterparts and, due to the chemical stability of the phosphorus-carbon bond, should be resistant to cleavage by nucleases that break the bond between the phosphorus and the oxygen. ^ Generation of nucleic acids containing phosphorus-carbon linkages began with the synthesis of the dTMP analogue, 5 ′-phosphonomethyl- 5 ′-deoxythymidine (pcdT), in which the 5 ′ oxygen has been substituted with a methylene group. In order to obtain a potential substrate for enzymatic DNA synthesis, pcdT was converted to the corresponding dTTP analogue, (diphospho) - 5 ′-phosphonomethyl- 5 ′-deoxythymidine (pppcdT) by chemical pyrophosphorylation. ^ Studies with this analogue using reverse transcriptase (RT) demonstrated that it is an acceptable substrate and capable of completely substituting as the thymidine monomer for cDNA synthesis. Furthermore, reverse transcriptase can be shown to incorporate pppcdT into DNA utilizing both RNA and DNA templates. Single stranded DNA containing the <b>incorporated</b> <b>analogue</b> can also serve as a template for the synthesis of a normal complementary DNA strand with RT. However, RT cannot accept pppcdT as a substrate for the synthesis of a complementary strand when a cDNA containing the <b>incorporated</b> <b>analogue</b> is used as the template. In addition, studies with DNA-dependent DNA polymerases show that these enzymes are unable to use pppcdT as a substrate. ^ In order to study the analogues mentioned above in vivo, 5 ′-phosphonomethyl analogues of nucleoside phosphate triesters were synthesized bearing lipophilic blocking groups designed to facilitate passive diffusion through cell membranes. These analogues were assayed for cellular cytotoxicity using established tumor cell lines. Data from preliminary assays demonstrated cytotoxicity in the μM range towards a prostate adenocarcinoma cell line (PC- 3). ^ We also developed a system of automated oligonucleotide synthesis based on a new support material that can be recycled. This allows an oligonucleotide synthesizer to operate continuously without the necessity for replacing the support cassette between runs. After ten rounds of synthesis on the same support cassette, a hexamer (dC) 6 was still being produced in good yields. ...|$|E

40|$|Human DNA topoisomerase I {{not only}} has DNA {{relaxing}} activity, but also splicing factors phosphorylating activity. Topo I shows strong preference for ATP as the phosphate donor. We used photoaffinity labeling with the ATP analogue [alpha- 32 P] 8 -azidoadenosine- 5 '-triphosphate combined with limited proteolysis to characterize Topo I domains involved in ATP binding. The majority of <b>incorporated</b> <b>analogue</b> was associated with two fragments derived from N-terminal and C-terminal regions of Topo I, respectively. However, mutational analysis showed that deletion of the first 138 N-terminal residues, known to be dispensable for topoisomerase activity, did not change the binding of ATP or the kinase activity. In contrast, deletion of 162 residues from the C-terminal domain was deleterious for ATP binding, kinase and topoisomerase activities. Furthermore, a C-terminal tyrosine 723 mutant lacking topoisomerase activity is still able to bind ATP and to phosphorylate SF 2 /ASF, suggesting that the two functions of Topo I can be separated.

40|$|The {{thymidine}} analogue 5 -bromodeoxyuridine (BUdR) has a differential {{effect on the}} synthesis of tissue-specific products and molecules required for growth and division. Proliferating myogenic cells cultured in BUdR fail to fuse and fail to initiate the synthesis of contractile protein filaments. Conversely, BUdR has but a minor effect on cell viability and reproductive integrity. Low concentrations of BUdR result in an enhancement of cell number relative to the controls; higher concentrations are cytotoxic. Suppression of myogenesis is reversible after at least 10 cell generations {{of growth in the}} analogue. Cells that do not synthesize DNA, such as postmitotic myoblasts and myotubes, are not affected by BUdR. Incorporation of BUdR for one round of DNA synthesis was accomplished by first incubating myogenic cells, prior to fusion, in 5 -fluorodeoxyuridine (FUdR) to block DNA synthesis and collect cells in the presynthetic phase. The cells were then allowed to synthesize either normal DNA or BU-DNA for one S period by circumventing the FUdR block with BUdR or BUdR plus thymidine (TdR). The cultures were continued in FUdR to prevent dilution of the <b>incorporated</b> <b>analogue</b> by further division. After 3 days, the cultures from the FUdR-BUdR series showed the typical BUdR effect; the cells were excessively flattened and few multinucleated myotubes formed. Cells in the control cultures were of normal morphology, and multinucleated myotubes were present. These results were confirmed in another experiment in which BUdR 3 H was added to 2 -day cultures in which myotubes were forming. Fusion of thymidine 3 H-labeled cells begins at 8 hr after the preceding S phase. In contrast, cells which incorporate BUdR- 3 H for one S period do not fuse with normal myotubes...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, safety-critical {{systems in}} for {{instance}} {{the automotive industry}} routinely consist of complex Systems-on-Chip in increasingly advanced processes. The decreased reliability for advanced processes, along with the harsh environmental conditions in cars, causes serious concerns for the dependability of those SoCs. For this reason, some digital IP vendors for those systems are already starting to incorporate additional information on IPs to system designers, for instance to include safety parameters. This provides system designers with a possibility to optimize/guarantee their design along an additional design axis (e. g. safety). As most automotive SoCs <b>incorporate</b> <b>analogue</b> front/back-ends, a similar requirement {{would also have to}} be included for analogue/mixed-signal IPs.

40|$|Deranged {{oxidative}} metabolism is a property of many tumour cells. Oxidation of the deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) pool, {{as well as}} DNA, is {{a major cause of}} genome instability. Here, we report that two Y-family DNA polymerases of the archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus strains P 1 and P 2 incorporate oxidized dNTPs into nascent DNA in an erroneous manner: the polymerases exclusively incorporate 8 -OH-dGTP opposite adenine in the template, and incorporate 2 -OH-dATP opposite guanine more efficiently than opposite thymine. The rate of extension of the nascent DNA chain following on from these <b>incorporated</b> <b>analogues</b> is only slightly reduced. These DNA polymerases have been shown to bypass a variety of DNA lesions. Thus, our results suggest that the Y-family DNA polymerases promote mutagenesis through the erroneous incorporation of oxidized dNTPs during DNA synthesis, in addition to facilitating translesion DNA synthesis.

Of the three dipeptides, dAbu-dAla, dNva-dAla, and dVal-dAla, only dNva-dAla (5 × 10 − 4 M) inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli W in the presence of 5 × 10 − 6 M d-cycloserine. This concentration of d-cycloserine did not inhibit growth, but it potentiated the bactericidal activity of the dipeptide. The lack of antibacterial activity observed with dAbu-dAla and dVal-dAla was correlated with the poor ability of these dipeptides to be taken up via the dipeptide transport system of this organism. Prevention of lysis induced by dNva-dAla plus d-cycloserine by certain dipeptides and not by others supported this correlation. It is proposed that the d-norvalyl residue of the dipeptide is incorporated in vivo into position 4 of the peptide subunit of peptidoglycan, and that this subunit is not an effective substrate in the reaction(s) catalyzed by the penicillin-susceptible enzyme(s) of cross-linked peptidoglycan synthesis...|$|R

40|$|Landscape Evolution Modelling (LEM) {{technologies}} {{provide a}} means by which it is possible to simulate the long-term geomorphic stability of a conceptual rehabilitated landform. However, simulations rarely consider the potential effects of anthropogenic climate change and consequently risk not accounting for the range of rainfall variability that might be expected in both the near and far future. One issue is that high resolution (both spatial and temporal) rainfall projections incorporating the potential effects of greenhouse forcing are required as input. However, projections of rainfall change are still highly uncertain for many regions, particularly at sub annual/seasonal scales. This is the case for northern Australia, where a decrease or an increase in rainfall post 2030 is considered equally likely based on climate model simulations. The aim of this study is therefore to investigate a spatial analogue approach to develop point scale hourly rainfall scenarios to be used as input to the CAESAR - Lisflood LEM to test the sensitivity of the geomorphic stability of a conceptual rehabilitated landform to potential changes in climate. Importantly, the scenarios incorporate the range of projected potential increase/decrease in rainfall for northern Australia and capture the expected envelope of erosion rates and erosion patterns (i. e. where erosion and deposition occurs) over a 100 year modelled period. We show that all rainfall scenarios produce sediment output and gullying greater than that of the surrounding natural system, however a ‘wetter’ future climate produces the highest output. Importantly, <b>incorporating</b> <b>analogue</b> rainfall scenarios into LEM has the capacity to both improve landform design and enhance the modelling software.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Computer and Electronical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. An active {{magnetic}} bearing (AMB) involves the suspension of a rotor by means of electromagnetic actuators. An AMB system comprises actuators, position sensors, a controller and power amplifiers. Conventional position sensors for rotor position sensing are expensive. The McTronX Research Group at the North-West University is currently conducting research on self-sensing, a method of extracting rotor position from the current and voltage actuation signals of the AMB. It was deemed necessary to develop a complete platform that will enable the implementation of self-sensing algorithms. The platform <b>incorporates</b> <b>analogue</b> circuitry, embedded devices and switching power amplifiers. The system will thus integrate all the electronics required for AMB suspension, and is thus dubbed: an Integrated Controller. The development of the integrated controller presented unique design challenges not yet faced by the McTronX group. To increase the chances of success and minimize some of the risks, the integrated controller was developed in collaboration with an industry partner. The collaboration required a systems engineering approach to the project. A detail type B specification was drawn up {{to aid in the}} project management process. The specification includes important detail such as the functional architectures, functional capabilities, performance specifications and physical constraints of the integrated controller. Some self-sensing algorithms can be implemented by means of analogue circuitry, and some can only be implemented in the digital domain. These digital algorithms are computationally intensive and require powerful processors. Digital signal processors (DSPs) and field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) both exhibit unique architectures ideal for digital signal processing. Both these devices were implemented in the integrated controller, with the DSP as the main processor and the FPGA the co-processor. Although the integrated controller can operate as a stand-alone system, it has several communication interfaces (RS 485, USB and RS 232). This allows the system to work in conjunction with other integrated controllers, to be controlled by a master controller or to communicate to a personal computer (PC). Testing the integrated controller involved the closed loop current control of an AMB power amplifier, facilitating all critical functional aspects. The integrated controller's performance meets the required specifications and is expected to successfully facilitate future self-sensing investigations. Master...|$|R
