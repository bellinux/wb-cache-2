5|$|Kafka shared time {{at quarterback}} with Persa {{due to his}} {{strained}} hamstring on November 7 against the 4th-ranked, and previously undefeated, Iowa Hawkeyes. Northwestern coming into the game was a 16-point underdog, but still beat Iowa 17–10 in Northwestern's first win over a nationally ranked top-ten team since they won against Ohio State in 2004. Persa <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> game early to receive X-rays for a hand injury, which forced Kafka to play more than original planned. He finished as Northwestern’s leading passer with 72yards on ten completions.|$|E
5|$|Kinslow {{made his}} MLB debut with the Washington Nationals of the NL on June4, 1886 as their {{starting}} catcher. He injured {{his finger in}} the third inning trying to catch a bad pitch thrown by Bob Barr, and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> game. On June15, he was again injured by a Barr pitch, and forced to leave the game with a dislocated finger. He played in three games for the Nationals in 1886, collecting two hits in eight at bats.|$|E
5|$|The Amps were an American alternative/indie rock group. Formed by Kim Deal in 1995 {{after her}} band the Breeders went on hiatus, the group {{consisted}} of Deal, vocals and guitars; Luis Lerma, bass; Nate Farley, guitars; and the Breeders' Jim Macpherson, drums. The Breeders' Kelley Deal, Kim's sister, was also briefly involved, but <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> band due to drug problems. The group was named when Kim Deal started calling herself Tammy Ampersand for fun, and the band Tammy and the Amps. They recorded the album Pacer in Ireland and the United States.|$|E

5|$|As part {{of these}} works, the Peddars Way was redirected. It had {{previously}} run straight across the de Warenne estates, but it was now diverted so that travellers coming from the south <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> main road, progress west around the priory and the castle fishpond, before reaching {{the southern end of}} the walled town and the route to the north. If they intended to enter the castle, they would have needed to enter through the town's western gate, then the castle's gatehouse, before probably passing through a ceremonial sequence of rooms in order to finally meet the lord. The route was designed to highlight the important symbols of the de Warenne lordship of the region and provide a dramatic view of the castle, and may have been a response to the political uncertainties of the Anarchy years.|$|E
5|$|Born April 22, 1994 in York, Maine, Robinson {{is the son}} of the Elisabeth and Jeffrey Robinson and the {{youngest}} of their three children (after sister Marta and brother Eli). Jeffrey, who is , had played one season for the Maine Black Bears men's basketball team. Robinson grew up on the remote New Hampshire island of New Castle where his Maude H. Trefethen Elementary School 6th grade graduating class was composed of four students and he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> island to continue his education. He attended Rye Junior High School and elected to attend The Governor's Academy rather than Portsmouth High School, which was the public high school for students in New Castle. Without Robinson, Portsmouth still reached four consecutive New Hampshire Interscholastic Athletic Association final fours and won the 2012 state championship.|$|E
5|$|Gaveston's {{return to}} grace was only temporary. On 26 February 1307, Edward I {{announced}} that the prince's favourite <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> realm shortly after 30 April that year. This time it seems the punishment was not intended for Gaveston, though, but for the Prince of Wales. According to Walter of Guisborough, the prince appeared before the King to request that his own county of Ponthieu be given to Gaveston. Edward I, enraged, tore out handfuls of his son's hair and threw {{him out of the}} royal chambers. Though Guisborough cannot necessarily be trusted on the details of the events, the story reflects the general exasperation the King felt with the prince's favouritism towards Gaveston, and the lavish gifts bestowed on the favourite. This extravagance was clearly seen on Gaveston's departure, when Prince Edward equipped him with horses, luxurious clothes, and £260 of money.|$|E

5|$|His initial {{appearance}} of the 1914season was in relief on April 17, {{a game in which}} he pitched 4innings, and gave up three runs in 6–5victory over the Reds. He followed that with two consecutive strong games as the starting pitcher, allowing just one unearned run in each game; the second was a complete game against the Reds. On June12, he started the game against New York, only to be injured in the third inning when he was hit in the hand by a ball batted by Fred Merkel, and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> game. The injury did not cause Lavender to lose much playing time. He pitched a four-inning relief appearance on June19, followed by a complete game shutout on June27 against the Reds. On August17, he pitched a second shutout during the season, a 3-0victory over the Brooklyn Robins.|$|E
5|$|Hobbs played {{just five}} {{first-class}} matches in 1921, when Australia toured England. In his opening first-class game, he played against the touring team, but tore the same thigh muscle injured in Australia. He missed the opening two Tests, but once recovered, scored a century for Surrey; as England trailed 2–0 in the five-Test series, the selectors chose {{him for the}} third Test. In the days approaching the match, played in Leeds, he suffered from increasing stomach pain but reluctantly played. On {{the first day of}} the match, he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> field, and after a day of rest the pain worsened. He consulted Sir Berkley Moynihan, a prominent surgeon based in Leeds, who diagnosed acute appendicitis and operated the same day. In the opinion of the surgeon, Hobbs would not have lived another five hours without surgery. He missed the rest of the season.|$|E
5|$|Hoping {{to become}} a schoolteacher, Kimball spent one {{semester}} at the University of Arizona {{in the spring of}} 1917, but he received an army draft notice later that year. During that time, he courted Camilla Eyring (18941987), a schoolteacher at Gila Academy (modern Eastern Arizona College), where Kimball had attended high school. They began dating in August 1917 and exchanged letters regularly after Kimball left for a semester at Brigham Young University (BYU) the next month. After one month at BYU, Kimball was notified that his call into the army was imminent, and he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> university and return to his hometown. He returned to Arizona, but his army group was never called up for duty before World War I, ended with the signing of the Armistice of 11 November 1918.|$|E

5|$|In June 2015, Doyle {{signed a}} two-year {{contract}} with Blackpool, newly relegated to League One. He was named club captain, and selected as starting goalkeeper, ahead of Kyle Letheren, {{for the opening}} match of the season, away to Colchester United. He made several saves to keep his team in the match, but damaged a shoulder in thwarting Colchester's Gavin Massey and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> field. After an initial prognosis of three months out, a scan suggested he could return to action within a month. He {{was back in the}} team for the visit to Scunthorpe United on 5 September, and produced a man-of-the-match performance that earned him a place in the Football League's Team of the Week as Blackpool won their first match of the season. Ankle ligament damage suffered in early November kept him out until the new year.|$|E
5|$|Khambatta also faced {{difficulties}} during filming. Due to the actress' personal objections, {{she would}} not appear nude as {{called for in the}} script during the Ilia probe's appearance. The producers got her to agree to wear a thin skin-colored body stocking, but she caught a cold {{as a result of the}} shower mist, created by dropping dry ice into warm water and funneling the vapors into the shower by a hidden tube. Khambatta <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> location repeatedly to avoid hypercapnia. One scene required the Ilia probe to slice through a steel door in the sickbay; doors made out of paper, corrugated cardboard covered in aluminum foil, and cork were tested before the proper effect was reached. The illuminated button in the hollow of the probe's throat was a 12–volt light bulb that Khambatta could turn on and off via hidden wires; the bulb's heat eventually caused a slight burn.|$|E
5|$|Manchester City manager Joe Mercer {{named his}} {{team for the}} final several days in advance. Glyn Pardoe missed {{training}} on Monday 21st with a leg injury, but after the fitness of Pardoe, Tony Coleman and Alan Oakes was tested in a practice match, all three were passed fit. Leicester City named a 14-man squad before travelling to a training camp in Bisham on the Tuesday. Manchester City travelled south on the Thursday, staying in Weybridge. Leicester had fitness doubts over Dave Gibson, Len Glover and John Sjoberg, but initially expected all three to be available for the final. However, in a practice match against Brentford, Sjoberg <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> field with a groin injury. His place in the team was taken by Alan Woollett.|$|E

5|$|Nina Tucker is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the Australian soap opera Neighbours, played by Delta Goodrem. She made her first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 11 June 2002. Goodrem {{was approached by}} producers after they saw her video for her debut single. Goodrem, who had just signed a record deal, almost turned down the role of Nina as she felt the character did not suit her style of music. The role was rewritten for her and she joined the cast. A year later, {{she was diagnosed with}} Hodgkin's lymphoma and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> show for treatment. Once her health improved, she made a return to Neighbours in 2004 to tie up Nina's storylines. In 2005, Neighbours celebrated its 20th anniversary with an episode that featured many ex-cast members, in which Goodrem reprised her role as Nina once more. She returned again in March 2015 for the show's 30th anniversary.|$|E
5|$|The Fourth Round held First Division club Cardiff City in snowy {{conditions}} at Ninian Park. Vale won 2–0, and their victory was {{aided by the}} fact that Cardiff goalkeeper Ron Howells <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> pitch after 20 minutes after being knocked out following a collision with defender Derrick Sullivan, leaving his ten-man team to play 70 minutes with defender Alf Sherwood in goal. Vale attacked through the wings to get in numerous crosses to the box, from which Ken Griffiths and Albert Leake scored their goals. Centre-half Tommy Cheadle restricted centre-forward Trevor Ford to a quiet game, and at full-time the pair were full of bruises but still left the pitch with a handshake and a smile. Cardiff placed a £25,000 transfer bid for winger Colin Askey, and after their offer was rejected Cardiff stated they were prepared to pay more than £25,000, but Port Vale refused any negotiations. Other top clubs also made inquiries, but were all turned away.|$|E
5|$|The divorce with Anna Neda in 1324 worsened the {{relations}} between Bulgaria and Serbia which had been cordial {{since the beginning of}} the 14th century. Anna Neda <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> capital Tarnovo with her sons and sought refuge from her brother Stephen Dečanski, the king of Serbia. Dečanski, who was engaged in war against his cousin Stephen Vladislav II, was in no position to oppose Michael Shishman. The Bulgarian emperor even acknowledged his rival as King of Serbia but his help to Vladislav was insufficient. In the spring of 1324 Dečanski sent the future Serbian archbishop Danilo II to negotiate with the Bulgarian emperor in Tarnovo but his mission was inconclusive. The two countries were again on the opposite sides in the Byzantine civil war when the Bulgarians allied with Andronikos III while the Serbs supported his grandfather.|$|E
