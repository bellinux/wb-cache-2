Earned <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> {{divided into}} three categories: Battle Experience, Support Experience, and Command <b>Experience.</b> Battle <b>Experience</b> <b>is</b> gained from elimination of enemy soldiers, the capture of base facilities, and exploring and interacting with the game world. Support <b>Experience</b> <b>is</b> earned through [...] "Assist" [...] kills: after aiding another player, the first player gains a percentage of experience the other player gains through kills. Command <b>Experience</b> <b>was</b> gained from leading a squad or platoon in a successful base capture. Functionally, Battle Experience and Support <b>Experience</b> <b>are</b> identical, both contributing towards Battle Rank, which lead to benefits {{such as the ability}} to use different equipment, implants, or appearance upgrades. Accumulated Command Experience let the player use several team-oriented abilities.|$|R

5|$|During {{a family}} {{vacation}} to New York when Lawrence was 14, she was spotted on the street by a talent scout who arranged for her to audition for agents. Lawrence's mother was not keen on allowing her to pursue an acting career, but briefly moved {{to the city to}} let her read for roles. After Lawrence's first cold reading, the agents said that hers was the best they had heard from someone that young; Lawrence's mother convinced her that they were lying. Lawrence said her early <b>experiences</b> <b>were</b> difficult as she felt lonely and friendless. She signed on with the CESD Talent Agency, who convinced her parents to let her audition for roles in Los Angeles. Lawrence's mother agreed to let her pursue acting on the condition that she graduate from high school. Lawrence was eventually home-schooled in Los Angeles, and graduated two years early with good grades. Considering acting to be a natural fit for her, she turned down several offers for modelling assignments at the time. Between her acting jobs in the city, she made regular visits to Louisville, during which she served as an assistant nurse at her mother's camp.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} {{psilocybin}} are highly variable and {{depend on the}} mindset and {{environment in which the}} user has the experience, factors commonly referred to as set and setting. In the early 1960s, Timothy Leary and colleagues at Harvard University investigated the role of set and setting on the effects of psilocybin. They administered the drug to 175 volunteers from various backgrounds in an environment intended to be similar to a comfortable living room. Ninety-eight of the subjects were given questionnaires to assess their experiences and the contribution of background and situational factors. Individuals who had experience with psilocybin prior to the study reported more pleasant experiences than those for whom the drug was novel. Group size, dosage, preparation, and expectancy were important determinants of the drug response. In general, those placed in groups of more than eight individuals felt that the groups were less supportive, and their <b>experiences</b> <b>were</b> less pleasant. Conversely, smaller groups (fewer than six individuals) were seen as more supportive. Participants also reported having more positive reactions to the drug in those groups. Leary and colleagues proposed that psilocybin heightens suggestibility, making an individual more receptive to interpersonal interactions and environmental stimuli. These findings were affirmed in a later review by Jos ten Berge (1999), who concluded that dosage, set, and setting were fundamental factors in determining the outcome of experiments that tested the effects of psychedelic drugs on artists' creativity.|$|E

40|$|That current {{ideals of}} {{cognition}} impoverish <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> a classical observation, and complaint, {{of the early}} Frankfurt School. Adorno reacts to this phenomenon in several ways, among them his conception of metaphysical <b>experiences.</b> Metaphysical <b>experiences</b> <b>are</b> conventionally understood as promissory notes, as metaphors for rich experiences. This article takes {{a different view of}} metaphysical experiences. It discusses them in light of Adorno's notion that objects have priority in experience and of his further remark that metaphysical <b>experiences</b> <b>are</b> constituted by error. It argues that rather than promissory notes or metaphors for rich <b>experiences,</b> metaphysical <b>experiences</b> <b>are</b> attempts at taking things literally...|$|R

30|$|Overall, I do {{not find}} {{statistically}} significant evidence that foreign <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> favored overall by employers in Myanmar.

This is true for both the Singapore and Malaysia experiences, as well as for both local and foreign employers.|$|R
40|$|The commonsense view of {{religious}} <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> {{that it is}} a preconceptual, immediate affective event. Work in philosophy and psychology, however, suggest that religious <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> an attributional cognitive phenomenon. Here the neural correlates of a religious <b>experience</b> <b>are</b> investigated using functional neuroimaging. During religious recitation, self-identified religious subjects activated a frontal-parietal circuit, composed of the dorsolateral prefrontal, dorsomedial frontal and medial parietal cortex.

5000|$|In phenomenology, empathy {{describes}} {{the experience of}} something from the other's viewpoint, without confusion between self and other. This draws on the sense of agency.
