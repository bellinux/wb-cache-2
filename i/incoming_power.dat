25|$|During {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s, various {{industrial}} enterprises and governmental institutions developed in Salaspils, {{such as the}} nuclear plant and four branches of the Academy of Science. Large multi-storied housing blocks appeared to house <b>incoming</b> <b>power</b> plant workers, {{many of whom were}} Russians. In a few decades Salaspils transformed from a very peaceful rural settlement to a mikroraion-style town. Due to the rapid development, Soviet authorities ordered construction of the Riga HES and Riga TEC-2. The dam created a massive reservoir that flooded monuments of Salaspils ancient history. The last unsubmerged sections of old Salaspils have been preserved at Salaspils railway station.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{introduction}} in the 1990s, high-frequency ballasts {{have been}} used in general lighting fixtures with either rapid start or pre-heat lamps. These ballasts convert the <b>incoming</b> <b>power</b> to an output frequency in excess of [...] This increases lamp efficiency. These are used in several applications, including new generation tanning lamp systems, whereby a 100 watt lamp (e.g., F71T12BP) can be lit using 90 watts of actual power while obtaining the same luminous flux (measured in lumens) as magnetic ballasts. [...] These ballasts operate with voltages that can be almost 600 volts, requiring some consideration in housing design, and can cause a minor limitation in the length of the wire leads from the ballast to the lamp ends.|$|E

5000|$|Electronic {{means of}} {{creating}} three phases where the <b>incoming</b> <b>power</b> is rectified, and the three-phase power is synthesized with electronics. Power electronic devices directly produce a three-phase waveform from single-phase power, using a rectifier and inverter combination. This also offers {{the advantage of}} variable frequency.|$|E
50|$|Meter tails (or, tails): Separated core cables used {{to connect}} the <b>incoming</b> <b>power</b> supply to a {{premises}} with the distribution board. Typically in a domestic environment, connects the electricity meter (which {{is owned by the}} power company and treated as the incoming source) to the consumer unit.|$|E
5000|$|Not all {{equipment}} requires voltage correction. These transformers {{are used}} when electrical equipment has a voltage requirement that is {{slightly out of}} tolerance with the <b>incoming</b> <b>power</b> supply. This is most common when using 240 V equipment in a business with 208 V service or vice versa.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{beneficial}} effects brought {{by the presence of}} multiple receivers to a slotted Aloha scheme. Starting from an analytical angle, we review and compare some recent results that characterize the throughput of such systems under different channel models, {{based on the assumption that}} <b>incoming</b> <b>powers</b> at receivers follow an i. i. d. distribution. While practical in some scenarios, this hypothesis does not hold when the path loss experienced by different users, or by a user seen by different receivers, starts to play a role. We shed light on this aspect by means of detailed simulations, and derive some relevant insights on the achievable diversity gain. The impact of successive interference cancelation in this context is also evaluated...|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} form of VSD {{technology}} in the air compressor industry is a variable-frequency drive, which converts the <b>incoming</b> AC <b>power</b> to DC and then back to a quasi-sinusoidal AC power using an inverter switching circuit. The variable-frequency drive article provides additional information on electronic speed controls used with various types of AC motors.|$|R
50|$|Lightning {{and other}} high-energy {{transient}} voltage surges can be suppressed {{with a whole}} house surge protector. These products are more expensive than simple single-outlet surge protectors, and often need professional installation on the <b>incoming</b> electrical <b>power</b> feed; however, they provide whole house protection from surges via that path. Damage from direct lightning strikes via other paths must be controlled separately.|$|R
50|$|If {{protection}} fails or is absent, lightning {{that strikes}} the electrical system introduces thousands of kilovolts that may damage the transmission lines, {{and can also}} cause severe damage to transformers and other electrical or electronic devices. Lightning-produced extreme voltage spikes in <b>incoming</b> <b>power</b> lines can damage electrical home appliances or even produce death.|$|E

50|$|Various {{technologies}} {{can be used}} {{to avoid}} overvoltage, but it must be done so efficiently so that energy savings resulting from using the correct voltage are not offset by energy wasted within the device used to do so.

40|$|On 1 July 1997, {{sovereignty}} over Hong Kong was {{returned from the}} UK to the People's Republic of China (PRC). This article identifies the impact of such a political transition on the Hong Kong higher education system during the transitional period between 1982 and 1997. The struggles among the departing and <b>incoming</b> sovereign <b>powers</b> and local groups are also examined. The article argues that, during this period, three related colonial transition processes - decolonisation, neocolonisation and recolonisation - co-existed in Hong Kong higher education {{within the framework of}} 'one country, two systems'. These processes can be seen as resistance to each other: for example, neocolonisation as resistance to decolonisation and recolonisation as resistance to neocolonisation. They are further complicated by the spectra of their accommodation and resistance by the three major actors. On different occasions, the local government and groups played different or even contradictory roles as decolonising, neocolonising or recolonising agents. They selectively participated in the three processes so as to create facilitating conditions for and obstacles to the control of higher education by the <b>incoming</b> ruling <b>power</b> in the post- 1997 era. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
50|$|An {{uninterruptible}} {{power supply}} {{can be used to}} switch off of mains power if there is a transient (temporary) condition on the line. However, cheaper UPS units create poor-quality power themselves, akin to imposing a higher-frequency and lower-amplitude square wave atop the sine wave. High-quality UPS units utilize a double conversion topology which breaks down <b>incoming</b> AC <b>power</b> into DC, charges the batteries, then remanufactures an AC sine wave. This remanufactured sine wave is of higher quality than the original AC power feed.|$|R
50|$|There is a snag {{when using}} these {{expressions}} {{to estimate the}} temperature of a particular asteroid. The calculation requires the Bond albedo A (the proportion of total <b>incoming</b> <b>power</b> reflected, taking into account all directions), while the IRAS and MSX albedo data that is available for asteroids gives only the geometric albedo p which characterises only the strength of light reflected back to the source (the Sun).|$|E
50|$|In data centers, larger PDUs {{are needed}} to power {{multiple}} server cabinets. Each server cabinet or rows of cabinets may require multiple high current circuits possibly from different phases of <b>incoming</b> <b>power</b> or different UPSs. Standalone cabinet PDUs are self-contained units that include main breakers, individual circuit breakers, and power monitoring panels. The cabinet provides internal bus bars for neutral and grounding. Prepunched top and bottom panels allow for safe cable entry.|$|E

We {{show that a}} light intensity pattern and a light polarization pattern produce two distinct material transport processes whose direction and kinetics can be independently controlled. The kinetics of the intensity-driven deformation scales with the <b>incoming</b> light <b>power</b> while the kinetics of the polarization-driven mass transport scales with the amplitude of the electromagnetic field pattern. We conclude that these two processes are fully independent {{one from the other}} and originate from two different microscopic mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|Abstract − Some {{measuring}} {{systems are}} very sensitive on disturbances <b>incoming</b> from <b>power</b> supplies. If no accumulators are used for their power supply, which ensure a minimum signal noise and transmission jamming signal from power network, special power supplies have to be constructed for them. An example of a possible influence of a disturbance, which spreads along to the power supply on high pure sine-wave signal source, is presented in our contribution, whereas the requirements on the power supply are also specified. Furthermore, {{an analysis of the}} construction of these sources is effected and a sample of the source construction and records are introduced...|$|R
50|$|A power {{distribution}} center (PDC) is electrical equipment designed {{to regulate the}} distribution of electrical power to various equipment, be that to machines in a factory or to various systems on an automotive vehicle. Typically, a switchgear supplies power to the PDC. The PDC housing contains a transformer, which steps down the <b>incoming</b> <b>power</b> to a lower voltage to feed other plant loads such as motor control centers (MCC's). Feeder breakers for these loads will be located on the PDC. PDC's will often contain additional protective relays, monitoring equipment, fuses, terminal points, etc.|$|E

In many cases, off-the-shelf hardware with modified firmware designed to exploit this weakness was sold to pirates for use in tampering with cards for the US-based DirecTV system.|$|E

5000|$|In {{an online}} UPS, the {{batteries}} are always {{connected to the}} inverter, so that no power transfer switches are necessary. When power loss occurs, the rectifier simply drops out of the circuit and the batteries keep the power steady and unchanged. When power is restored, the rectifier resumes carrying most of the load and begins charging the batteries, though the charging current may be limited to prevent the high-power rectifier from overheating the batteries and boiling off the electrolyte. The main advantage of an on-line UPS {{is its ability to}} provide an [...] "electrical firewall" [...] between the <b>incoming</b> utility <b>power</b> and sensitive electronic equipment.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose to}} operate a superconducting {{transition}} edge sensor (TES) using {{a different type of}} biasing, in which the resistance of the TES is kept constant by means of feedback on the bias voltage and is independent of the <b>incoming</b> signal <b>power.</b> By combining a large negative electrothermal feedback with a load independent resistance, this approach can significantly linearise the response of the detector in the large signal limit. The electrothermal feedback is enhanced in comparison with the commonly applied voltage biasing, which further increases the speed of the detector. Furthermore, in frequency domain multiplexed (FDM) readout, the sinusoidal bias voltages for each TES can be generated cryogenically with the readout SQUIDs. Comment: 4 pages, 2 figure...|$|R

The engines are mated to a front-wheel-drive transaxle. There is no center differential. The transaxle is bolted to torque transfer unit that spins a center drive shaft that powers the rear differential unit. The rear differential is a T-shaped device. Power coming from the engine is transferred via a central hypoid gear that delivers power to each rear axle. Power to the each axle is modulated by identical planetary gear sets and electromagnetic clutch packs which can vary <b>incoming</b> <b>power</b> side to side.|$|E
