50|$|A {{number of}} verbs in Spanish employ a dative construction. Many of these verbs express {{psychological}} states; {{the most common}} one is <b>gustar,</b> which is equivalent to English like (but syntactically functions like be pleasant to). The verb agrees with the formal/morphological subject, but the subject is usually placed after the verb instead of before, as usual. The dative construction requires a clitic pronoun; if the dative argument is a full noun phrase or needs to be explicitly stated, it is shown by a phrase with the preposition a.|$|E

5000|$|Rock {{and roll}} first broke into Uruguayan audiences {{with the arrival}} of British band The Beatles in the early 1960s. A wave of bands {{appeared}} in Montevideo, including Los Shakers, Los Mockers, Los Iracundos and Los Malditos, who became major figures in the so-called Uruguayan Invasion of Argentina. [...] With the coming of the military dictatorship in 1973, the Uruguayan rock scene effectively died; since the mid-1980s it has resurged. Since the beginning of the 2000s Uruguayan rock has achieved a great popularity. Popular bands like La Vela Puerca, No Te Va <b>Gustar,</b> El Cuarteto de Nos, La Trampa or Buitres have a massive following in the Southern Cone. Annual festivals throughout the country like Pilsen Rock in Durazno, Semana de Lavalleja and Minas & Abril in Minas, or Semana de la Cerveza in Paysandú, peaked more than 100,000 people several years with some of those groups as closing guests.Other important bands are: Trotsky Vengaran, Hereford, Once Tiros, Bufón, La Triple Nelson and La Tabaré.|$|E

40|$|In Spanish, people {{generally}} distinguish {{three kinds of}} psychological verbs, those that are syntactically realized like temer, like preocupar and like <b>gustar.</b> One of the peculiarities of these verbs is that, despite their semantic relatedness, each type of verbs shows up a different correspondence pattern between thematic roles and grammatical functions. In this paper I develop a unified account of these empirical data, based on Lexical Mapping Theory. As the difference between preocupar and the other kinds of verbs seems to be mainly semantic, and more specifically aspectual, I propose to reformulate the thematic theory of Dowty (1991), {{in order to accommodate}} aspectual differences; more specifically, the proto-role linking of arguments is made dependent in part on the aspectual decomposition of the event denoted by a verb. In order to explain the syntactic differences between temer and <b>gustar,</b> I propose to modify the mapping theory, by introducing an optional rule operating on the thematic structure of the <b>gustar</b> verbs. These modifications give as an additional result a more consistent analysis of Spanish (and generally Romance) indirect objects and a preliminary analysis of the Spanish leísmo (through which an object, traditionally analyzed as a direct object, can be marked with dative morphology) as it operate...|$|E

We begin with Parret's hypothesis to homologate semiotics and pragmatics on the basis of five axes in inclusive relation, and where the subjectivity —as an organizing principle of language— is the dominant element. We have attempted to realize a textual analysis of Gongora's sonnet: «La dulce boca que a <b>gustar</b> convida», in which we include the study of modal competence and communicative intentionality, fundamentally, with the goal of context semiotization. We think this exercise shows the possible harmonization that can exist between semiotic and pragmatic studies, and especially its essential complementarity...|$|E
