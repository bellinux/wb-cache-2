5|$|Although Cincinnati's African Americans were {{initially}} {{pressed into service}} at bayonet point, after the appointment of William Dickson as commander of the black troops their treatment improved significantly. Dickson promised {{that they would be}} treated fairly and kept together as a distinct unit, to be called the Black Brigade. He then allowed them to return home to prepare for military service, with orders to report the next morning for duty. About four hundred men were released that day, September 4, and the next morning about seven hundred reported for duty. Among those men was Beaty, who served in Company Number 1 of the Brigade's 3rd Regiment. Despite the danger of Confederate attack, the unarmed unit was assigned to build defenses near the Licking River in Kentucky, <b>far</b> <b>in</b> <b>advance</b> of the Union lines. For the next fifteen days, they cleared forests, constructed forts, magazines and roads, and dug trenches and rifle pits. The brigade was disbanded on September 20, the threat of attack having receded.|$|E
5|$|Planning for a {{light rail}} system on Portland's west side started in 1979, with a {{groundbreaking}} coming in 1993 on the Westside MAX project. The line originally was to terminate at Willow Creek/185th, but lobbying by Hillsboro mayor Shirley Huffman and others secured funding to extend the line to downtown. Plans for the station originally called {{for the construction of}} a branch of the Hillsboro Public Library at the stop. Due to cost overruns when building the Robertson Tunnel through the West Hills, the library was canceled and a Books by Rail program was added to the Hillsboro Central station. TriMet also canceled plans for security cameras at the station. The park-and-ride lot opened on March 3, 1997, served by two bus lines (61 and 88), because it was ready for use. The original planned opening date of September 1997 for Westside MAX as far as 185th Avenue had been postponed by one year, due to delays in constructing the Robertson Tunnel, resulting in Willow Creek park-and-ride's being completed <b>far</b> <b>in</b> <b>advance</b> of the start of MAX service and related bus-service expansion.|$|E
5|$|Wheeler {{established}} a new archaeological journal, Ancient India, planning {{for it to}} be published twice a year. He had trouble securing printing paper and faced various delays; the first issue was released in January 1946, and he would release three further volumes during his stay. Wheeler married Kim Collingridge in Simla, before he and his wife took part in an Indian Cultural Mission to Iran. The Indian government had deemed Wheeler ideal to lead the group, which departed via train to Zahidan before visiting Persepolis, Tehran, Isfahan, Shiraz, Pasargadae, and Kashan. Wheeler enjoyed the trip, and was envious of Tehran's archaeological museum and library, which was <b>far</b> <b>in</b> <b>advance</b> of anything then found in India. Crossing into Iraq, in Baghdad the team caught a flight back to Delhi. In 1946, he was involved in a second cultural mission, this time to Afghanistan, where he expressed a particular interest in the kingdom of ancient Bactria and visited the archaeology of Balkh.|$|E

5|$|The naval {{section of}} Alsos flew into Paris soon {{after it had}} been liberated in August 1944. They went down to Bordeaux to inspect the {{captured}} German destroyer Z39. After the Alsos Mission became convinced that the Germans had not developed an atomic bomb, the naval section became the Naval Technical Mission Europe. They were {{particularly interested in the}} work of Dr Hellmuth Walter in the development of submarines and rockets. Most of the targets that they were interested in lay in the British sector, so they worked closely with their English allies. In {{the last days of the}} war, the Naval Technical Mission was part of a 75-man task force, most of whom were from 30 Assault Unit, that made a dash for Kiel, entering the city <b>far</b> <b>in</b> <b>advance</b> of the Allied advance. The whole garrison of the city, some 150,000 men, surrendered to the task force. They drove to Admiral Karl Dönitz's headquarters in Flensburg, where they saw but did not speak with him, as Dönitz was on his way to surrender. They spoke instead to Admiral Otto Backenköhler, and persuaded him to sign a release for German scientists, so men like Walter could freely discuss their work with the Allies. From April to December 1945, Mumma also served as assistant naval attaché.|$|E

As judged by the criteria of replication, GWASs have been among the most successful epidemio logical study designs to date, in no small measure due to large sample sizes, stringent quality control, simplicity of experimental design, and collaborative transparency between researchers.
