25|$|Wine is an {{integral}} part of Jewish laws and traditions. The Kiddush <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>blessing</b> recited over wine or grape juice to sanctify the Shabbat. On Pesach (Passover) during the Seder, it is a Rabbinic obligation of adults to drink four cups of wine. In the Tabernacle and in the Temple in Jerusalem, the libation of wine was part of the sacrificial service. Note that this does not mean that wine is a symbol of blood, a common misconception that contributes to the Christian myth of the blood libel.|$|E
25|$|Samasyā (Hindi: समस्या, meaning Difficulty): This canto, a soliloquy by Aṣṭāvakra in his mother's womb, {{deals with}} the notion of Samasyā or a difficulty. The canto is replete with pathos (Karuṇa Rasa), heroism (Vīra Rasa) and optimism. In the first 30 verses, various metaphors are painted for difficulty, which is {{universal}} and extremely powerful. Faith in God and determined action are the ways {{to get out of a}} difficulty, and Aṣṭāvakra is resolute that he will get out of his predicament too. In verses 61 to 82, the real nature of the Ātman (Self), without beginning and end, without birth and death, and beyond mortal difficulties is presented, according to the poet's philosophy of Viśiṣṭādvaita. Aṣṭāvakra then tells Kahola about his (Kahola's) imminent repentance, and that he is determined intent to live the life of a disabled. He requests his father not to curse anybody in future, and the canto ends with optimistic prophesies by Aṣṭāvakra that the curse of his father <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>blessing</b> in disguise for the disabled of the world, as Aṣṭāvakra will be their role model.|$|E

500|$|The {{concept of}} theodicy was {{expanded}} mainly {{with the thought}} of Weber and his addition of ethical considerations to the subject of religion. There is this ethical part of religion, including [...] "(1) soteriology and (2) theodicy. These mean, respectively, how people understand themselves {{to be able to be}} in a correct relationship with supernatural powers, and how to explain evil – or why bad things seem to happen to those who seem to be good people". There is a separation of different theodicies with regard to class. [...] "Theodicies of misfortune tend to the belief that wealth and other manifestations of privilege are indications or signs of evil.... In contrast, theodicies of fortune emphasise the notion that privileges are a blessing and are deserved." [...] Weber also writes that [...] "the affluent embrace good fortune theodicies, which emphasise that prosperity <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>blessing</b> of God... theodices of misfortune emphasise that affluence is a sign of evil and that suffering in this world will be rewarded in the next." [...] Thus these two distinctions can be applied not only to class structure within society but denomination and racial segregation within religion.|$|E
500|$|Khaled Hosseini {{considers}} pain, love, {{and familial}} {{love to be}} the primary themes of And the Mountains Echoed. The separation of the two siblings, Abdullah and Pari, is [...] "the heart of the book". Both subsequently become [...] "victims of the passage of time": Abdullah, who is older and remembers Pari, agonizes over her loss for most of his life, while Pari is younger and able to forget her brother after losing him. However, {{towards the end of the}} book, Pari is informed that she was adopted and that she has a brother, Abdullah; she locates him in the United States only to discover that he is suffering from Alzheimer's disease and has forgotten her. Hosseini stated, [...] "The question is raised a number of times about whether memory <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>blessing</b> — something that safeguards in all the things that are dear to you — or is memory a curse — something that makes you relive the most painful parts of your life, the toil, the struggle, the sorrows." [...] Thus, the combination of these events make And the Mountains Echoed [...] "kind of like a fairytale turned on its head".|$|E

2500|$|... 2012. On July 9, 2012, the Episcopal Church {{passed a}} {{resolution}} approving an official liturgy for blessing same-sex unions. This liturgy, called “The Witnessing and Blessing of a Lifelong Covenant” offers a blessing close to marriage, but the church is {{clear that it is}} not marriage. According to Rev. Ruth Meyers, chairwoman of the Standing Commission on Liturgy and Music, “There are a lot of similarities. The couple give their consent to being joined in lifelong commitment, they exchange vows. There’s the possibility of exchanging rings, or, for couples who have been together for some time and already have rings, to have their rings blessed. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>blessing</b> over the couple. But we’re clear at this point {{that this is not a}} marriage because the Episcopal Church is not in agreement in its understanding of marriage.” The resolution enables priests to bestow the church’s blessing on gay couples even if they live in a state where same-sex marriage is illegal; however, bishops who do not approve of the liturgy can prohibit their priests from using it. The resolution is provisional and will be reviewed in three years.|$|E

2500|$|Based upon a {{view that}} life begins at conception, Protestant author Randy Alcorn rejects all forms of {{hormonal}} contraceptives, while James Dobson and obstetrician and minister William R. Cutrer reject only certain forms of them. Dobson and Cutrer view progesterone-only birth control pills as potentially problematic, since they may be potentially abortive contraceptives because of the theoretical possibility {{that they may have}} a slight secondary action of preventing a fertilized embryo from implanting within the uterine wall, while Alcorn implicates all hormonal contraceptives as problematic in these regards. Dobson's Focus on the Family states,Dr. Dobson would emphasize as foundational his strict concurrence with the biblical teaching that every child <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>blessing</b> from God ... While affirming that human life begins with fertilization (the union of sperm and egg), his interpretation of Scripture leads him to believe that the prevention of fertilization is not morally wrong. However, he would oppose any method of birth control that acts after fertilization and terminates a conceived human life by preventing its implantation in the womb ... After two years of extended deliberation and prayer, the PRC {{has not been able to}} reach a consensus as to the likelihood, or even the possibility, that these medications might contribute to the loss of human life after fertilization. The majority of the experts to which Dr. Dobson has spoken feel that the pill does not have an abortifacient effect. A minority of the experts feel that when conception occurs on the pill, there is enough of a possibility for an abortifacient effect , however remote, to warrant informing women about it.|$|E
