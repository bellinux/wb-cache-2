40|$|Abstract One of {{the crucial}} issue {{in the field of}} {{autonomous}} mobile robotics is the vitality of energy efficiency of robots and the entire system they form. By efficiency here we re-fer to ability of robots (or the system in which they are de-ployed) to maintain their survival throughout the course of the operation so as to provide themselves with the opportu-nity of attaining energy once needed. In this paper, issue of recharging of a group of autonomous worker robots in their working environment has been addressed. To deliver the ob-jective, a tanker robot’s planner, capable of determining an <b>energy</b> <b>supply</b> <b>route</b> based on regression analysis techniques, has been implemented. Specifically we have examined the practicality of ordinary and weighted least squares (OLS and WLS respectively) as well as orthogonal least abso-lute values (ORLAV) regressions for recharging route com-putation (hence the terms Least Square Recharging Route (LSRR) and Orthogonal Recharging Route (ORR)). Stud-ies were conducted (while examining OLS and WLS tech-niques) to analyze the effect of various uncertainties which may exist in location information of the robots with regards to the recharging route. It has been proven that ORLAV based planner may result to a recharging route that mini-mizes the cumulative sum of worker robots distance traver-sal during the recharging process, irrespective of tanker lo-cation. Simulations in both, environment with and without obstacles, have been conducted to examine the practicality of the techniques in contrast with fixed charging station sce...|$|E

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{significance}} of <b>energy</b> <b>supply</b> <b>routes</b> in cellular energetic homeostasis, net phosphoryl fluxes catalyzed by creatine kinase (CK), adenylate kinase (AK) and glycolytic enzymes were quantified using 18 O-phosphoryl labeling. Diaphragm muscle from double M-CK/ScCKmit knockout mice exhibited virtually no CK-catalyzed phosphotransfer. Deletion of the cytosolic M-CK reduced CK-catalyzed phosphotransfer by 20 %, while {{the absence of the}} mitochondrial ScCKmit isoform did not affect creatine phosphate metabolic flux. Contribution of the AK-catalyzed phosphotransfer to total cellular ATP turnover was 15. 0, 17. 2, 20. 2 and 28. 0 % in wild type, ScCKmit, M-CK and M-CK/ScCKmit deficient muscles, respectively. Glycolytic phosphotransfer, assessed by G- 6 -P 18 O-phosphoryl labeling, was elevated by 32 and 65 % in M-CK and M-CK/ScCKmit deficient muscles, respectively. Inhibition of glyceraldehyde 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) /phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) in CK deficient muscles abolished inorganic phosphate compartmentation and redirected high-energy phosphoryl flux through the AK network. Under such conditions, AK phosphotransfer rate was equal to 86 % of the total cellular ATP turnover concomitant with almost normal muscle performance. This indicates that near-equilibrium glycolytic phosphotransfer reactions catalyzed by the GAPDH/PGK support {{a significant portion of the}} high-energy phosphoryl transfer in CK deficient muscles. However, CK deficient muscles displayed aberrant ATPase-ATPsynthase communication along with lower energetic efficiency (P/O ratio), and were more sensitive to metabolic stress induced by chemical hypoxia. Thus, redistribution of phosphotransfer through glycolytic and AK networks contributes to energetic homeostasis in muscles under genetic and metabolic stress complementing loss of CK function...|$|R

40|$|Currently, China {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} actors in the international energy arena. Increasing economic growth requires The People’s Republic of China (the PRC), first, to expand its <b>energy</b> <b>supply</b> providers (diversification), and, second, to make this supply a secure one. Due to the rapidly changing market of energy, it is important to understand what factors place the main stress on the current energy policies and drive it to change. The essay addresses the following question: Why is China altering its current energy policy in the Middle East and pursuing diversification of <b>energy</b> <b>supply</b> in Central Asia and Russia? There are four main triggers pushing the PRC to a change: security, environment, technology and geopolitics. These four are acting as both separate issues and interconnected factors. The essay argues that China's high dependence on the Middle Eastern energy exports does not allow the PRC to switch to other suppliers completely in the nearest future. On the contrary, friendly relations between Persian Gulf countries and China should be used towards the creation of the triad energy framework (China—Central Asia—Russia or the Middle East—Central Asia+Russia—China). Central Asia serves as both the primary secure supplier of energy to China and as the transit point. This transit option connects China with the Middle East through the land which are the safe <b>supplying</b> <b>routes</b> Chinese government is pursuing. Moreover, the growing worldwide environmental concern requires China to reconsider its current <b>energy</b> <b>supply</b> strategies. Thus, the geopolitical switch may stimulate more environmentally friendly consumption and production of energy by the means of gas. Finally, gas and more specifically the Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) has a bigger potential in Central Asian, Russia, and China than in the Middle East allowing China not only to pursue cleaner <b>energy</b> <b>supply</b> but to overcome certain security issues...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Efficient <b>energy</b> <b>supply,</b> storage, and {{distribution}} are key technical challenges for design {{and operation of}} electronic systems. In particular, <b>energy</b> <b>supply</b> is the most scarce resource and constraint for mobile embedded systems where the supply lifetime, cost, weight, size, and portability are major concerns. With the advent of newer electrical <b>energy</b> <b>supply</b> and storage technologies, <b>energy</b> <b>supplies</b> with differing energy/power storage densities, cost, size, and recycling abilities are becoming available. Efficient system design requires an exact matching between the fluctuating load demands and the underlying energy resources.
