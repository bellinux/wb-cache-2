Acetoxybenzoate was hydrolysed by almost all the organ homogenates in the order of p-> m-> o- compounds. Salicylamide, salicyluric acid, salicylalanine, salicylleucine, and salicylglutamic acid were not hydrolysed enzymatically.

The purified reaction center originally contained approximately six molecules of chlorophyll a, two β-carotene and two pheophytin a per one photochemically active pheophytin a. The treatment with 30 – 50 % water-saturated ether extracted one β-carotene, {{as well as}} one chlorophyll a that absorbs at 677 nm, remaining 62 % of the photochemical activity to reduce pheophytin a. With 60 – 80 % water-saturated ether, almost all the β-carotenes were extracted, remaining the 49 % activity without additional loss of chlorophyll. The absorption, fluorescence excitation and linear dichroism spectra demonstrated two spectral forms of β-carotene. The short-wavelength form of β-carotene with absorption peaks at 429, 458 and 489 nm was selectively <b>extracted</b> <b>with</b> <b>ether</b> at low water content, whereas the long-wavelength form with peaks at 443, 473 and 507 nm was extractable only at the higher water content.

40|$|The {{discrepancy}} between the testos-terone concentrations with and without extraction was further investigated. We deduced that the serum could not con-tain excess testosterone bound to some unknown or modified binding protein, as all protein-bound testosterone should have been <b>extracted</b> <b>with</b> the <b>ether.</b> This point was further elaborated by extract-ing the sample after acid hydrolysis be-fore assay, again giving < 0. 5 nmollL. Accordingly, we assayed for testosterone conjugates that might be present. Serum proteins were precipitated with ethanol, aliquots of the supernatant evaporated, redissolved in water, and either treated with sulfatase or acid hydrolysis to obtain testosterone free of sulfate or other con-jugates such as glucuronide.
