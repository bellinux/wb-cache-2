5000|$|<b>Gray's</b> <b>monitors</b> (Varanus olivaceus) were {{introduced}} to the collection in 2010, becoming the only <b>Gray's</b> <b>monitors</b> on display in a UK zoo, and 1 of only 2 zoos in Europe. [...] These very specialised lizards are a focal point of the direction which the reptile house at the park is heading in, and at 2 years of age at the time of arrival it will be a number of years before the park can try to achieve the first breeding of this species in Europe. The collection currently has a pair of this species to try to achieve this.|$|R
50|$|Reptiles and Amphibians The reptile and {{amphibian}} species {{currently held}} at the park include tortoises, turtles, various species of crocodiles, snakes, spiders, chameleons, various species of frog, <b>gray's</b> <b>monitors,</b> gila monsters, rhinoceros iguanas and many more.|$|R
5000|$|Avilon Zoo has {{successfully}} bred the <b>Gray's</b> <b>monitor</b> lizard (Varanus olivaceus) or [...] "butaan" [...] ex situ (in captivity).

50|$|Other {{unique and}} {{threatened}} reptiles include <b>Gray's</b> <b>monitor</b> and the Philippine forest turtle. There are two newly discovered species of frugivorous monitor lizard, the Panay monitor lizard {{from the island}} of Panay and Northern Sierra Madre forest monitor from north east Luzon, {{there are only three}} species of monitor lizards that are specialized frugivores.|$|R
50|$|Varanus bitatawa was {{described}} as a new species in April 2010 by biologists from the University of Kansas. DNA analysis has revealed genetic divergence between this species and its closest relative, <b>Gray's</b> <b>Monitor</b> (Varanus olivaceus), which is also a fruit-eater, but lives on the southern end of Luzon, rather than the northern end where the forest monitor lizard lives.|$|R

25|$|The zoo {{supports}} many conservation projects including Okapi Conservation - Epulu Research Station, Zaire, International Rhino Foundation, Chimp Haven, Bushmeat Crisis Task Force, <b>Gray's</b> <b>Monitor</b> Lizard In The Philippines, Taxon Advisory Groups (Tag), Bowling For Rhinos, and the Thailand Hornbill Project - Adopt A Hornbill Nest. In {{addition to}} conservation, sustainability {{efforts by the}} zoo include growing bamboo and cabbage to function {{as part of the}} landscape aesthetic throughout the zoo. The overgrowth is harvested and used as food for the zoo's herbivores.|$|R
50|$|Reptile House was {{refurbished}} {{and most}} of it re-built through much of 2008 through to 2010, to make the improvements required for the growth of the animal collection (from 18 species in 2008 to 46 species at the start of 2011). A wide variety of reptiles, amphibians and invertebrates are housed in the reptile collection including; western diamondback rattlesnake, <b>Gray's</b> <b>monitors,</b> Cuban crocodile, dwarf crocodiles, common snapping turtles, white lipped tree vipers, rhinoceros iguanas, golden mantella frogs (for which Wingham Wildlife Park hold the ESF studbook) and many more.|$|R
50|$|It is {{well known}} for its diet, which {{consists}} primarily of ripe fruit, especially Pandanus. A number of prey items are, however, also consumed, including snails, crabs, spiders, beetles, birds and eggs. Monitors are generally carnivorous animals, which makes the <b>Gray's</b> <b>monitor</b> somewhat of an exception amongst the varanid family. Such an unusual diet may be as a result of competition over food with the water monitors, which share their range. One of the only fruits readily eaten by this species in captivity is grapes, with these and fruit powder supplementing a captive diet of insects and rodents.|$|R
25|$|The zoo {{is active}} in {{conservation}} and species-preservation efforts. Its Institute for Conservation Research (formerly the Center for Reproduction of Endangered Species) raises California condors, giant pandas, tigers, black rhinos, polar bears, orangutans, peninsular pronghorn, desert tortoises, African penguins, mountain yellow-legged frogs, Pacific pocket mice, Francois' langurs, giraffes, quino checkerspot butterflies, Hawaiian crows, light-footed clapper rails, <b>Gray's</b> <b>monitors,</b> tree lobsters, clouded leopards, Galapagos tortoises, Tahiti lorikeets, lion-tailed macaques, mhorr gazelles, gorillas, Przewalski's horses, koalas, burrowing owls, elephants, Tasmanian devils, okapi, southwestern pond turtle, and 145 other endangered species. As a result, they have reintroduced more than 30 endangered species back into the wild, and have conserved habitat at 50 field sites. They also have over 200 conservation scientists working in 35 countries around the world. It employs numerous professional geneticists, cytologists, and veterinarians and maintains a cryopreservation facility for rare sperm and eggs called the frozen zoo.|$|R
50|$|The LAIR (Living Amphibians, Invertebrates, and Reptiles), {{which opened}} in 2012, is a $14 million indoor-outdoor exhibit complex that focuses on herps and {{terrestrial}} arthropods. Guests first pass through the Oak Woodland Pond, where local species can move in and live among native plants. The next feature is the 6000 sq ft main building where the Damp Forest houses poison dart frogs, Chinese giant salamanders, and a recreation of a Daintree Rainforest river with archerfish, Australian lungfish, and Fly River turtles. The Mangshan pitviper, west African green mamba, South American bushmaster and other snakes live in the next segment of the building, Betty's Bite and Squeeze Room, named after GLAZA co-chair Betty White. Guests can see keepers care for animals behind the scenes in the Behind the Glass room. The Care and Conservation Room showcases <b>Gray's</b> <b>monitor</b> and other endangered reptiles. After the main building is Arroyo Lagarto, a set of outdoor exhibits for Madagascar radiated tortoise, Madagascar spider tortoise, desert lizards, and California desert tortoise. A 2000 sq ft secondary building, the Desert LAIR, houses the Gila monster, Sonoran toad, Arizona Desert hairy scorpion, California kingsnake, and other species from Mexico, Arizona, and Southern California. The LAIR ends with Crocodile Swamp, an outdoor exhibit home to false gharials.|$|R
50|$|The World Wide Web {{was born}} on a NeXTCube with a 256Mhz cpu, 2GB of disk, and a <b>gray</b> scale <b>monitor</b> running NeXTSTEP OS. Sir Tim Berners-Lee put the first web page online on August 6, 1991 while working for CERN in Geneva Switzerland. Online gaming started in the early seventies. At that time Dial-up {{bulletin}} boards provided players with a way of playing games over the internet. In the 1990s, new technologies enabled gaming sites to pop {{up all over the}} internet. The client-server system provided online gaming a way to function on a large scale.|$|R

50|$|Returning to Liverpool University in 1947 as Reader, he {{established}} the Department of Anaesthesia, and introduced tubocurarine with mechanical lung ventilation. This {{became known as}} the ‘Liverpool technique’, based on the triad of unconsciousness, analgesia and muscle relaxation, with a markedly lower complication rate than deep inhalational anaesthesia. <b>Gray</b> introduced train-of-four <b>monitoring,</b> still used today. He also worked with Gordon Jackson Rees at Liverpool, developing safer methods for paediatric anaesthesia.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to generate accurate, current data on distribution (distance to shore, travel path) and behavior (travel speed, migration timing) of gray whales migrating along the central Oregon coast (Pacific Ocean). Migration paths of tracked whales seem to follow a constant depth rather than following the shoreline. Speed estimates were within range of values reported by others. As expected, migration paths of some gray whales cross through areas of proposed wave energy development. This baseline information combined with further observations to <b>monitor</b> <b>gray</b> whale behavior after wave energy facilities are installed can be used to determine potential effects and to evaluate the need for and effectiveness of mitigation measures...|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} production Bearcat {{was introduced}} in the Series A of 1912. The first public mention of the car (then spelled “Bear Cat” [...] ) is in an advertisement in the 1912 program for the Indianapolis 500 mile race. This ad also was the first to use the soon to be famous Stutz slogan “The Car that made good in a day” referring to the Stutz racer’s 11th-place finish in the 1911 Indianapolis 500. The Series E of 1913 brought electric lights and starter. A six-cylinder option was available for an extra $250.00 (equivalent to $ in [...] ). The doorless body style lasted through 1916. A sales catalog lists the available colors for the Series E as vermillion, <b>monitor</b> <b>gray,</b> and Mercedes red. Wire wheels were listed as a $125 option (equivalent to $ in [...] ).|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the effects of variant <b>monitor</b> <b>gray</b> scale levels and workplace illumination levels on operators' ability to discriminate between different colors on a monochrome monitor. It was determined that 8 -gray scale viewing resulted in significantly worse discrimination performance compared to 16 - and 32 -gray scale viewing and that there was only a negligible difference found between 16 and 32 shades of gray. Therefore, it is recommended that monitors used while performing remote manipulation tasks have 16 or above shades of gray since this evaluation has found levels lower than this to be unacceptable for color discrimination task. There was no significant performance difference found between a high and a low workplace illumination condition. Further analysis was conducted to determine which specific combinations of colors can be used in conjunction with each other to ensure errorfree color coding/brightness discrimination performance while viewing a monochrome monitor. It was found that 92 three-color combination and 9 four-color combinations could be used with 100 percent accuracy. The results can help to determine which gray scale levels should be provided on monochrome monitors as well as which colors to use to ensure the maximal performance of remotely-viewed color discrimination/coding tasks...|$|R
40|$|Link Data Processor Medical Engineering Co., Tehran, Iran"nThere is need {{of using}} patient's past-deciphered re-sults and images for {{accurate}} diagnosis {{of disease and}} treatment follow up. "n&lsquo;APAX VIEWER' is software that enables you to see the various medical images. Its function related to {{the management of the}} database helps the doctors to prepare for the education, research and conference as well as to save the images into their personal computers. And it also can help the doctors to manage effectively the patient's data of diagnosis and treatment, connected with the Hos-pital Information System (HIS). "nDiagnostic version of APAX viewer is a viewer for diagnosticians that uses multi monitor of portrait type, which requires 2 to 4 monitors, optimized to diagnose. "nOne of the features of APAX is Patient Time Table or MIH (Medical Image History) that display the patient's past-deciphered results and images which all images have the same Patient ID. It shows images in 3 Months, 6 Months, 1 Year, 2 Years, 3 Years, 4 Years and 5 Years ago and can open each exam or series as selected. "nAPAX has 4 viewing modes: Compare (comparing images of old exams), Exam (comparing exams of one patient), Series (comparing series of one patient) and Normal (viewing one patient). "n 2 or 4 monitors provide for easy and rapid side-by side comparison viewing of images, regardless of whether they are different representations of the same image or two images of the same patient that were obtained at different times. Radiologist can dictate the interpretation on the same workstation and save it as file in patient database. Also he can type his/her report or interpretation on APAX Radiology Information System (RIS) or other RIS on the same workstation instantly. All APAX icons are gray which are compatible with <b>gray</b> scale medical <b>monitors.</b> "nAbove features cause APAX to be ergonomic for using by Radiologists...|$|R
