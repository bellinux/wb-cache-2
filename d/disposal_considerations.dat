40|$|Reactor Pressure Vessel (RPV) Head {{replacements}} {{have come}} to the forefront due to erosion/corrosion and wastage problems resulting from the susceptibility of the RPV Head alloy steel material to water/boric acid corrosion from reactor coolant leakage through the various RPV Head penetrations. A case in point is the recent Davis-Besse RPV Head project, where detailed inspections in early 2002 revealed significant wastage of head material adjacent to one of the Control Rod Drive Mechanism (CRDM) nozzles. In lieu of making ASME weld repairs to the damaged head, Davis-Besse made the decision to replace the RPV Head. The decision was made on the basis that the required weld repair would be too extensive and almost impractical. This paper presents the packaging, transport, and <b>disposal</b> <b>considerations</b> for the damaged Davis-Besse RPV Head. It addresses the requirements necessary to meet Davis Besse needs, as well as the regulatory criteria, for shipping and burial of the head. It focuses on the radiological characterization, shipping/disposal package design, site preparation and packaging, and the transportation and emergency response plans that were developed for the Davis-Besse RPV Head project...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Studies of the U {{decay series}} (138 U 234 U 23 ~ {{have been carried}} out on samples from {{unaltered}} bedrock and highly altered fracture/crush zones from drillcore Km 3 (Kamlunge t st-site). The fracture zones are characterized byabundant iron oxide coatings (hematite and hydroxy iron oxides) resulting from the passage of hydrothermal solutions coeval with the Lina granite intrusion. Enrichments of U and Th, thought to be due to co-precipitation (or preferential sorption) processes to-gether with the iron-oxides, are also present. The isotopic results how that {{out of a total of}} twelve rock samples measured, six indicate isotopic disequi-librium mostly due to unequal depletions of 234 U and 238 U; one near-surface sample indicated some minor assimilation of U. The major fracture zones generally indicate removal of total U. This has resulted from interaction with groundwaters which are still marginally oxidizing, even at depths of 375 m. Isotopic disequilibrium has occurred within recent geological times, i. e. during the last 0. 5 Ma as imposed by the half-lives of 234 U and 23 ~ In terms of radioactive <b>disposal</b> <b>considerations,</b> the results are important in that: (1) the investigated bedrock environment (100 - 500 m) is generally reducing; however (2) there is some vidence to indicate that rock/water interactions, leading to the removal of total U, have resulted from the presence ofless reducing roundwaters within those large-scale fracture/ crush zones which intersect the bedrock surface...|$|E

40|$|This report {{covers the}} third {{part of a larger}} U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) project to assess the {{life-cycle}} environmental and resource impacts in the manufacturing, transport, use, and disposal of light-emitting diode (LED) lighting products in relation to incumbent lighting technologies. All three reports are available on the DOE website (www. ssl. energy. gov/tech_reports. html). • Part 1 : Review of the Life-Cycle Energy Consumption of Incandescent, Compact Fluorescent and LED Lamps; • Part 2 : LED Manufacturing and Performance; • Part 3 : LED Environmental Testing. Parts 1 and 2 were published in February and June 2012, respectively. The Part 1 report included a summary of the life-cycle assessment (LCA) process and methodology, provided a literature review of more than 25 existing LCA studies of various lamp types, and performed a meta-analysis comparing LED lamps with incandescent and compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs). Drawing from the Part 1 findings, Part 2 performed a more detailed assessment of the LED manufacturing process and used these findings to provide a comparative LCA taking into consideration a wider range of environmental impacts. Both reports concluded that the life-cycle environmental impact of a given lamp is dominated by the energy used during lamp operation—the upstream generation of electricity drives the total environmental footprint of the product. However, a more detailed understanding of end-of-life <b>disposal</b> <b>considerations</b> for LED products has become increasingly important as their installation base has grown. The Part 3 study (reported herein) was undertaken to augment the LCA findings with chemical analysis of a variety of LED, CFL, and incandescent lamps using standard testing procedures. A total of 22 samples, representing 11 different models, were tested to determine whether any of 17 elements were present at levels exceeding California or Federal regulatory thresholds for hazardous waste. Key findings include: • The selected models were generally found to be below thresholds for Federally regulated elements; • All CFLs and LED lamps and most incandescent lamps exceeded California thresholds for Copper; • Most CFL samples exceeded California thresholds for Antimony and Nickel, and half of the LED samples exceeded California thresholds for Zinc; • The greatest contributors were the screw bases, drivers, ballasts, and wires or filaments; • Overall concentrations in LED lamps were comparable to cell phones and other types of electronic devices, and were generally attributable to components other than the internal LED light sources; • Although the life-cycle environmental impact of the LED lamps is favorable when compared to CFLs and incandescent lamps, recycling will likely gain importance as consumer adoption increases. This study was exploratory in nature and was not intended to provide a definitive indication of regulatory compliance for any specific lamp model or technology. Further study would be needed to more broadly characterize the various light source technologies; to more accurately and precisely characterize a specific model; or to determine whether product redesign would be appropriate...|$|E

40|$|Higher {{activity}} {{radioactive wastes}} remain hazardous for extremely long timescales, {{of up to}} hundreds of thousands of years. Disposing of such wastes deep underground presents the internationally accepted best solution for isolating them from the surface environment on associated timescales. Geological disposal programmes need to assess potential releases from such facilities on long timescales to inform siting and design decisions and to help build confidence that they will provide an adequate degree of safety. Assessments of geological <b>disposal</b> include <b>consideration</b> of the wastes, the engineered facility, the host geology and the surface and near-surface environment including the biosphere.

40|$|The {{disposal}} of long-lived intermediate- and some low-level wastes (ILW/LLW) in vaults backfilled with cementitious material {{is one of}} a number of generic <b>disposal</b> concepts under <b>consideration</b> in the UK. The employment of a cementitious backfill results in the generation and persistence of a high pH (pH 12. 5 to 10. 5) environment within the disposal system. These conditions are favourable in terms of reducing the mobility of some radionuclides, however they also promote the chemical degradation of cellulosic materials present in some wastes. This alkaline chemical degradation of cellulose results in the generation of a range of soluble products some of which are able to complex radionuclides and potentially enhance their mobility (e. g. iso-saccharinic acid). This report reviews the current understanding regarding alkaline cellulose degradation and the associated impacts of radiolytic and microbial processes. Conceptual and mathematical models developed to describe alkaline cellulose degradation are also outlined and discussed.

For this reason, four disposal alternatives (KRS- 1, A-KRS- 1, A-KRS- 21, and A-KRS- 22) have been developed in order {{to carry out the}} direct disposal of the CANDU spent fuel. The objective {{of this study is to}} conduct cost efficiency analysis of the <b>disposal</b> alternatives in <b>consideration</b> of price volatility for the radioactive waste repository. To derive future price volatility, this study used the ARIMA model. As a result, A-KRS- 1 is the most efficient in terms of price per bundle using 2015 price. As for the results using ARIMA model, except in the case of KRS- 1, the cost per bundle of A-KRS- 1, A-KRS- 21, and A-KRS- 22 is decreased. Cost estimation using ARIMA model shows little change or decreases in cost while cost estimation using inflation rates for 2020 resulted in approximately 7. 2 % increases compared to 2015 for all options.

In a letter, dated December 5, 1969, this agency asked for technical assistance, as authorized by the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, in developing discharge standards appropriate for Las Vegas Bay, Lake Mead, and the Lower Colorado River. The subsequent study was performed by EPA from January through August, 1970. The establishment of Nevada State Water Quality Standards for these waters will enable responsible officials to develop solutions for water quality problems in Las Vegas Bay and Las Vegas Wash. Water quality standards are needed in order to (1) abate present nuisance conditions in waters of Las Vegas Bay, Lake Mead, and the Lower Colorado River, and (2) to provide a basis for the evaluation of alternative waste <b>disposal</b> plans under <b>consideration</b> by local districts using Lake Mead and the Lower Colorado River for sewage disposal.

The curtailment of Las Vegas Wash effluent discharge may provide some mitigation for present nuisance algal conditions found in the Las Vegas Bay arm of Lake Mead. However, under this plan, it is also possible that the nutrients discharged to the river could support nuisance algal growth in downstream impoundments.

To guide the study three research questions were formulated. This was achieved through administration of structured questionnaires in three randomly sampled schools. Findings show regular grass clearing, sweeping of the school compound and painting, landscaping and planting of flowers, good drainage and refuse disposal are strategies adopted for managing the school environment.   While lack of gardeners to keep the school compound clean, erosion, students and teachers not being responsive to environmental issues, difficulties to inculcate in students environmental values due to different home upbringing, lack of funds to procure working tools/implements and waste disposal challenges were some identified challenges in the school environmental management. Three hypotheses were put forward to be tested in the study: 1) There is no significant difference in strategies adopted in the management of school environment 2) Management of school environment has no significant effect on student study/reading habit 3) The challenges of managing school environment have no significant effect on the quality of school environment. Statistical results from tested hypotheses show significant relation and correlation in all. Result for hypothesis one shows that there is significant difference in strategies adopted in the management of school environment.

40|$|Although {{significant}} {{effort has}} been dedicated {{to the study of}} burnup-credit issues over the past decade, U. S. studies to-date have primarily focused on spent pressurized-water-reactor (PWR) fuel. The current licensing approach taken by the U. S. Department of Energy for burnup credit in transportation seeks approval for PWR fuel only. Burnup credit for boiling-water-reactor (BWR) fuel has not yet been formally sought. Burnup credit for PWR fuel was pursued first because: (1) nearly two-thirds (by mass) of the total discharged commercial spent fuel in the United States is PWR fuel, (2) it can substantially increase the fuel assembly capacity with respect to current designs for PWR storage and transportation casks, and (3) fuel depletion in PWRs is generally less complicated than fuel depletion in BWRs. However, due to international needs, the increased enrichment of modern BWR fuels, and criticality safety issues related to permanent disposal within the United States, more attention has recently focused on spent BWR fuel. Specifically, credit for fuel burnup in the criticality safety analysis for long-term disposal of spent nuclear fuel enables improved design efficiency, which, due to the large mass of fissile material that will be stored in the repository, can have substantial financial benefits. For criticality safety purposes, current PWR storage and transportation canister designs employ flux traps between assemblies. Credit for fuel burnup will eliminate the need for these flux traps, and thus, significantly increase the PWR assembly capacity (for a fixed canister volume). Increases in assembly capacity of approximately one-third are expected. In contrast, current BWR canister designs do not require flux traps for criticality safety, and thus, are already at their maximum capacity in terms of physical storage. Therefore, benefits associated with burnup credit for BWR storage and transportation casks may be limited to increasing the enrichment capacity and/or decreasing the neutron absorber concentration. However, regulations associated with permanent <b>disposal</b> require <b>consideration</b> of scenarios and/or package conditions that are not relevant or credible for storage or transportation, and as a result, necessitate credit for burnup in BWR fuel to maintain capacity objectives. Burnup credit relies on depletion calculations to provide a conservative estimate of spent fuel contents and subsequent criticality calculations to assess the value of k{sub eff} for a spent fuel cask or a fuel configuration under a variety of postulated conditions. Therefore, validation is necessary to quantify biases and uncertainties between analytic predictions and measured isotopics. However, the design and operational aspects of BWRs result in a more heterogeneous and time-varying reactor configuration than those of PWRs. Thus, BWR spent fuel analyses and validation efforts are significantly more complicated than those of their PWR counterparts. BWR spent fuel assemblies are manufactured with variable enrichments, both radially and axially, are exposed to time- and spatially-varying void distributions, contain integral burnable absorber rods, and are subject to partial control-blade insertion during operation. The latter is especially true in older fuel assemblies. Away-from-reactor depletion tools used for characterization of spent fuel have typically been developed and validated for more homogeneous PWR fuel assemblies without integral burnable absorber rods, and thus must be reassessed for BWR configurations to determine a conservative methodology for estimating the isotopic content of spent BWR fuel. This report examines the use of SAS 2 H 8 for calculating spent BWR fuel isotopics for burnup-credit criticality safety analyses and assesses the adequacy of SAS 2 H for this task. The effects of SAS 2 H modeling assumptions on calculated spent BWR fuel isotopics and the effects of depletion assumptions on calculated k{sub inf} values are investigated. Detailed two-dimensional (2 -D) HELIOS 9 assembly calculations are compared to one-dimensional (1 -D) cylindrical approximations performed using the SAS 2 H sequence of SCALE. 10 SAS 2 H uses a 1 -D transport solution (XSDRNPM) to generate three-group fuel-averaged fluxes, which are used in the point depletion ORIGEN-S code. Studies focused on the effect of geometric modeling with approximate 1 -D models and the effect of variations in relevant depletion parameters are presented...|$|R
40|$|The Soviet Union {{operates}} {{a vast and}} growing radioactive waste management system. Detailed information on this system is rare and a general overall picture only emerges after a review of {{a great deal of}} literature. Poor waste management practices and slow implementation of environmental restoration activities have caused a great deal of national concern. The release of information on the cause and extent of an accident involving high-level waste at the Kyshtym production reactor site in 1957, as well as other contamination at the site, serve to highlight past Soviet waste management practices. As a result, the area of waste management is now receiving greater emphasis, and more public disclosures. Little is known about Soviet waste management practices related to uranium mining, conversion, and fuel fabrication processes. However, releases of radioactive material to the environment from uranium mining and milling operations, such as from mill tailings piles, are causing public concern. Official Soviet policy calls for a closed fuel cycle, with reprocessing of power reactor fuel that has been cooled for five years. For power reactors, only VVER- 440 reactor fuel has been reprocessed in any significant amount, and a decision on the disposition of RBMK reactor fuel has been postponed indefinitely. Soviet reprocessing efforts are falling behind schedule; thus longer storage times for spent fuel will be required, primarily at multiple reactor stations. Information on reprocessing in the Soviet Union has been severely limited until 1989, when two reprocessing sites were acknowledged by the Soviets. A 400 -metric ton (MT) per year reprocessing facility, located at Kyshtym, has been operational since 1949 for reprocessing production reactor fuel. This facility is reported to have been reprocessing VVER- 440 and naval reactor fuel since 1978, with about 2000 MT of VVER- 440 fuel being reprocessed by July 1989. A second facility, located near Krasnoyarsk and having a 1500 MT per year capacity as the first of several modules, was about 30 % completed by July 1989. The completion of this plant was subsequently "indefinitely postponed. " The initial reprocessing scheme at the Kyshtym site used sodium uranyl acetate precipitation from fuel dissolved in nitric acid solutions. The basic method~ ology now appears {{to be based on the}} conventional PUREX process. Dry reprocessing on a pilot or laboratory scale has been under way in Dimitrovgrad since 1984, and a larger unit is now being built, according to the French CEA. Perhaps significantly, much research is being done on partitioning high-level waste into element fractions. The Soviets appear to have the technology to remove radioactive noble gases released during reprocessing operations; however, there are no indications of its implementation. Millions of curies of liquid low- and intermediate-level wastes have been disposed of by well injection into underground areas where they were supposedly contained by watertight rock strata. Some gaseous wastes were also disposed of by well injection. This practice is not referred to in recent literature and thus may not be widely used today. Rather, it appears that these waste streams are now first treated to reduce volume, and then solidified using bitumen or concrete. These solidified liquid wastes from Soviet nuclear power reactor operations, along with solid wastes, are disposed of in shallow-land burial sites located at most large power reactor stations. In addition, 35 shallow-land burial sites have been alluded to by the Soviets for disposal of industrial, medical, and research low-level wastes as well as ionization sources. Research on tritium-bearing and other gaseous wastes is mentioned, as well as a waste minimization program aimed at reducing the volume of waste streams by 30 %. The Soviets have announced that their high-level waste management plan is to 1) store liquid wastes for 3 - 5 years; 2) incorporate the waste into glass (at a final glass volume of 100 - 150 liters/MT of fuel reprocessed); 3) set it aside in air-cooled storage for 30 - 50 years; and 4 } provide for its final disposal in a deep geologic repository. High-level waste solidification research started in the 1950 s, and a pilot vitrification facility has operated for 10 years at Kyshtym. A fully radioactive unit also operated there for about two years until 1988 and produced 160 MT of HLW phosphate glass, containing 3. 9 x 106 curies of radioactivity. [This corresponds to radioactivity in about 10 MT of 10 -year-old power reactor fuel. ] Problems with the glass melter electrodes have caused this latter plant to shut down, but a new design and plant are being developed. A site near Krasnoyarsk has also recently been referred to as a disposal site for low- and intermediate-level waste streams and possibly for vitrified wastes from Kyshtym. Deep geologic disposal of vitrified high-level waste has been studied, at a modest level of effort, over the last decade in the Soviet Union. Key <b>disposal</b> concepts under <b>consideration</b> include mining shafts, deep drill holes, and underground excavations. Although a variety of host rock types have been addressed, the emphasis appears to be on salt, clay, and granite. The Soviet Union appears to require the use of man-made barriers and waste packages in permanent disposal, but the geologic formation will be relied upon as the primary protective barrier. The construction schedule for a Soviet repository has not been stated. Meanwhile, a decision on the first repository site may be made in 1990, with a candidate site being at Chelyabinsk...|$|R
