500|$|English is a pluricentric language, {{which means}} that no one {{national}} authority sets the standard {{for use of the}} language. But English is not a divided language, despite a long-standing joke originally attributed to George Bernard Shaw that the United Kingdom and the United States are [...] "two countries separated by a common language". Spoken English, for example English used in broadcasting, generally follows national pronunciation standards that are also <b>established</b> <b>by</b> <b>custom</b> rather than by regulation. International broadcasters are usually identifiable as coming from one country rather than another through their accents, but newsreader scripts are also composed largely in international standard written English. The norms of standard written English are maintained purely by the consensus of educated English-speakers around the world, without any oversight by any government or international organisation.|$|E
60|$|As {{a sort of}} {{inverted}} memory, expectation {{follows the}} same laws; hence, while a belief of expectation is, in most cases, as Hume truly says, <b>established</b> <b>by</b> <b>custom,</b> or the repetition of weak impressions, it may quite well be based upon a single strong experience. In the absence of language, a specific memory cannot be strengthened by repetition. It is obvious that that which has happened cannot happen again, with the same collateral associations of co-existence and succession. But, memories of the co-existence and succession of impressions are capable of being indefinitely strengthened by the recurrence of similar impressions, in the same order, even though the collateral associations are totally different; in fact, the ideas of these impressions become generic.|$|E

For {{you need}} not think {{that even if you}} {{obtained}} a majority of representatives in the existing parliament, you could immediately compel any system of business, broadly contrary to that now <b>established</b> <b>by</b> <b>custom.</b> If you could pass laws to-morrow, wholly favorable to yourselves, as you might think, because unfavorable to your masters, and to the upper classes of society,--the only result would be that the riches of the country would at once leave it, and you would perish in riot and famine. Be assured that no great change for the better can ever be easily accomplished, or quickly; nor by impulsive, ill-regulated effort, nor by bad men; nor even by good men, without much suffering. The suffering must, indeed, come, one way or another, in all greatly critical periods; the only question, for us, is whether we will reach our ends (if we ever reach them) through a chain of involuntary miseries, many of them useless, and all ignoble; or whether we will know the worst at once, and deal with it by the wisely sharp methods of Godsped courage.|$|E

A joint research project was undertaken <b>by</b> the Australian <b>Customs</b> Service (Customs),Royal Guide Dogs Associations of Australia (RGDAA) and The University of Melbourne. The aims were to establish a breeding program for Drug Detector Dogs(Detector Dogs) and to further improve the RGDAA breeding program. Behavioural studies were conducted on the RGDAA breeding population of Labradors(Guide Dog population) and a ‘trial’ breeding population was <b>established</b> <b>by</b> <b>Customs</b> during the research (Detector Dog population). We defined traits important for success as a Detector Dog and designed an aptitude test (CRR test) to measure the traits. We found some sex differences for individual traits within the combined Guide Dog and Detector Dog populations. However, no sex difference was observed in terms of overall performance. Within the Detector Dog population, dogs selected to start a Detector Dog training course performed significantly better on the CRR test than dogs not selected to start a course.

6000|$|Then, again, {{in regard}} to {{proprietary}} rights over immovables (the principal kind of property in a rude age) these rights were of very varying extent and duration. By the Jewish law property in immovables was only a temporary concession; on the Sabbatical year it returned to the common stock to be redistributed; though we may surmise that in the historical times of the Jewish state this rule may have been successfully evaded. In many countries of Asia, before European ideas intervened, nothing existed to which the expression property in land, as we understand the phrase, is strictly applicable. The ownership was broken up among several distinct parties, whose rights were determined rather by custom than by law. The government was part owner, having {{the right to a}} heavy rent. Ancient ideas and even ancient laws limited the government share to some particular fraction of the gross produce, but practically there was no fixed limit. The government might make over its share to an individual, who then became possessed of the right of collection and all the other rights of the state, but not those of any private person connected with the soil. These private rights were of various kinds. The actual cultivators or such of them as had been long settled on the land, had a right to retain possession; it was held unlawful to evict them while they paid the rent--a rent not in general fixed by agreement, but by the custom of the neighborhood. Between the actual cultivators and the state, or the substitute to whom the state had transferred its rights, there were intermediate persons with rights of various extent. There were officers of government who collected the state's share of the produce, sometimes for large districts, who, though bound to pay over to government all they collected, after deducting a percentage, were often hereditary officers. There were also, in many cases village communities, consisting of the reputed descendants of the first settlers of a village, who shared among themselves either the land or its produce according to rules <b>established</b> <b>by</b> <b>custom,</b> either cultivating it themselves or employing others to cultivate it for them, and whose rights in the land approached nearer to those of a landed proprietor, as understood in England, than those of any other party concerned. But the proprietary right of the village was not individual, but collective; inalienable (the rights of individual sharers could only be sold or mortgaged with the consent of the community) and governed by fixed rules. In mediæval Europe almost all land was held from the sovereign on tenure of service, either military or agricultural; and in Great Britain even now, when the services as well as all the reserved rights of the sovereign have long since fallen into disuse or been commuted for taxation, the theory of the law does not acknowledge an absolute right of property in land in any individual; the fullest landed proprietor known to the law, the freeholder, is but a [...] "tenant" [...] of the Crown. In Russia, even when the cultivators of the soil were serfs of the landed proprietor, his proprietary right in the land was limited by rights of theirs belonging to them as a collective body managing its own affairs, and with which he could not interfere. And in most of the countries of continental Europe when serfage was abolished or went out of use, those who had cultivated the land as serfs remained in possession of rights as well as subject to obligations. The great land reforms of Stein and his successors in Prussia consisted in abolishing both the rights and the obligations, and dividing the land bodily between the proprietor and the peasant, instead of leaving each of them with a limited right over the whole. In other cases, as in Tuscany, the metayer farmer is virtually co-proprietor with the landlord, since custom, though not law, guarantees to him a permanent possession and half the gross produce, so long as he fulfils the customary conditions of his tenure.|$|E
5000|$|Kelsen assumes, however, {{that the}} {{scientific}} {{representation of a}} positive-legal order, as a hierarchy of legal propositions, must have a guarantor of unity. This guarantor cannot be other than {{a component of the}} representation, hence a legal proposition. Being a legal proposition, it counts as a representation of an actual norm. So Kelsen calls it, elliptically, a 'basic norm (Grundnorm)'. [...] A basic norm is 'presupposed' in legal science for each order of positive law, to make it possible to understand that material as an order of positive law. This norm is simply that 'the historically first constitution is to be obeyed'. That constitution may have become <b>established</b> <b>by</b> <b>custom</b> or by revolution: the jurist does not evaluate the circumstances.|$|E

5000|$|A Treatise on Orders {{evaluates the}} three orders {{and how they}} {{function}} in society. Loyseau puts particular emphasis {{on the fact that}} these orders were <b>established</b> <b>by</b> social <b>custom</b> and tradition, not mandate or law. [...] He defines each order by the role it served in society, and shows how they were afforded certain rights and obligations not shared. The rigorous boundaries and roles of each order allowed absolutely no social mobility, but there was some mobility within their own hierarchy. Loyseau believed the advantage to such a system was that it created a whole society, without fragments, with every person knowing his or her clearly defined place.|$|R
50|$|The two {{opposing}} armies {{met at the}} locale called Sokhoista which lay {{on the border of}} the district of Basean (now Pasinler District, Turkey). The Georgian chronicle of Prince Vakhushti provides with some details of the battle. According to this source, the nobles of Samtskhe resented the refusal of the Georgian kings to allow them to fight in the vanguard as it long had been <b>established</b> <b>by</b> a medieval <b>custom,</b> and refused {{to take part in the}} battle at all. The hard-contested action lasted from the dawn to the evening, and ended in a decisive Ottoman victory.|$|R
50|$|In {{regions that}} use the US Letter paper format by 11 inches (215 by 280 mm); United States, Canada, and in part Mexico and the Philippines), a three-hole {{standard}} is widely used. The holes are positioned symmetrically, with the centers 4.25 in apart. The diameter of the holes varies between manufacturers, with typical values being 1/4 to 5/16 in. The 5/16 value is most commonly used, as it allows for looser tolerances in both ring binder and paper punching. The distance of the hole center to the paper edge also varies, with 1/2 in being a typical value. Unlike ISO 838, this 3-hole system appears to have no well-established official specification, and is a de facto standard <b>established</b> <b>by</b> <b>custom</b> and tradition. It can only be applied to paper formats that are at least 9.5 in high.|$|E
50|$|The {{length of}} the diver's {{umbilical}} {{will depend on the}} operational parameters. As a general rule a short umbilical is cheaper and more manageable than a longer one, and provided that it is long enough, shorter is generally safer. The standby diver or bellman's umbilical should generally be about 2m longer than that of the working diver to allow easy access to the diver in an emergency. A common length <b>established</b> <b>by</b> <b>custom</b> and experience is 30m for a closed bell diver's umbilical, but this may be varied when circumstances require. For surface oriented work it is often necessary to use a longer umbilical. Deployable length may be controlled by tying off the umbilical {{to reduce the risk of}} the diver approaching known hazards too closely. The IMCA specification is 5m minimum distance from a hazard.|$|E
5000|$|The {{privileges}} {{granted to}} each tenant, and the exact services {{he was to}} render to the Lord of the Manor in return for them, were described in the roll or book kept by the Steward, who gave {{a copy of the}} relevant entry to the tenant. Consequently, these tenants were afterwards called copyholders, in contrast to freeholders. The actual term [...] "copyhold" [...] is first recorded in 1483, and [...] "copyholder" [...] in 1511-12. The specific rights and duties of copyholders varied greatly from one manor to another and many were <b>established</b> <b>by</b> <b>custom.</b> Initially, some works and services to the Lord were required of copyholders (4 days work per year for example), but these were commuted later to a rent equivalent. Each manor custom laid out rights to use various resources of the land such as wood and pasture, and numbers of animals allowed on the common. Copyholds very commonly required the payment of a type of death duty called an heriot upon the decease of the copyholder; to the Lord of the manor.|$|E
50|$|The {{boundaries}} of Ruxton have been <b>established</b> largely <b>by</b> local <b>custom.</b> Both the eastern boundary, Charles Street, and the western, Falls Road, are generally agreed upon. The {{northern and southern}} boundaries are somewhat imprecise. To the northeast, Ruxton and neighboring Riderwood are bounded by the Baltimore Beltway (I-695); to the northwest, affiliation with Ruxton follows West Joppa Road, the Old Court Road extension alongside the Baltimore-Harrisburg Expressway (I-83), and finally Ruxton Road to the intersection with Falls. A southern boundary can be discerned by drawing a crude line from the southerly intersection of Bellona Avenue and Charles to the intersection of West Lake Avenue and Falls.|$|R
5000|$|International {{humanitarian}} law (IHL) {{is the law}} that regulates the conduct of war (jus in bello). It is that branch of international law which seeks to limit the effects of armed conflict by protecting persons who are not participating in hostilities, and by restricting and regulating the means and methods of warfare available to combatants. IHL is inspired by considerations of humanity and the mitigation of human suffering. [...] "It comprises a set of rules, <b>established</b> <b>by</b> treaty or <b>custom,</b> that seeks to protect persons and property/objects that are (or may be) affected by armed conflict and limits the rights of parties to a conflict to use methods and means of warfare of their choice". It includes [...] "the Geneva Conventions and the Hague Conventions, as well as subsequent treaties, case law, and customary international law." [...] It defines the conduct and responsibilities of belligerent nations, neutral nations, and individuals engaged in warfare, in relation {{to each other and}} to protected persons, usually meaning non-combatants. It is designed to balance humanitarian concerns and military necessity, and subjects warfare to the rule of law by limiting its destructive effect and mitigating human suffering.|$|R

50|$|The Board of Selectmen is an {{outgrowth}} of, or an agent of, the major decision-making body, the Town Meeting. The office has evolved {{through more than}} three hundred years of tradition and custom. In addition to those duties which have been <b>established</b> <b>by</b> <b>custom,</b> the Selectmen's powers and duties are determined by the provisions of the Massachusetts General Laws and the respective town bylaws. The Selectmen have general supervision over all matters not specifically delegated by law or town vote to some other officer or board. The Selectmen meet regularly on Monday night in the Proctor School Library. All meetings {{are open to the public}} and are televised and can be viewed on Channel 10/47, the Community Channel. Selectmen's meetings, like those of all public boards and committees, must be posted at least 48 hours in advance. They are open to the public and subject to the requirements of the state Open Meeting Law Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 39, Section 23B. The Board may retire to executive session only to discuss those matters permitted by law. The Board must state which of the eight provisions is being invoked at that time. All minutes are a matter of public record except when they need to remain secret long enough to protect the legal purposes of the session.|$|E
40|$|Although {{much has}} been written about Oregon 2 ̆ 7 s unique legacy of public {{privilege}} to use private beaches, scholarship has tended to focus on articulation as well as spirited critique of the custom doctrine. More recently, commentators have addressed the question of whether the public 2 ̆ 7 s beach rights can withstand scrutiny under the constitutional takings doctrine. In contrast, this article assumes that the custom doctrine is sufficiently embedded in Oregon 2 ̆ 7 s history and case law as precedent to withstand reconsideration of the doctrine and to constitute a background principle of state law for purposes of the takings doctrine.

5000|$|Although Letters of Marque and Reprisal were {{sometimes}} issued before a formal declaration of war, as {{happened during the}} American Revolution when the rebelling colonies of Massachusetts, Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania all granted Letters of Marque months before the Continental Congress's official Declaration of Independence of July 1776, {{by the turn of}} the 19th century it was generally accepted that a sovereign government first had to declare war.

60|$|It {{has been}} {{the aim of the}} Administration to enforce honesty and {{efficiency}} in all public offices. Every public servant who has violated the trust placed in him has been proceeded against with all the rigor of the law. If bad men have secured places, it {{has been the}} fault of the system <b>established</b> <b>by</b> law and <b>custom</b> for making appointments, or the fault of those who recommend for Government positions persons not sufficiently well known to them personally, or who give letters indorsing the characters of office seekers without a proper sense of the grave responsibility which such a course devolves upon them. A civil-service reform which can correct this abuse is much desired. In mercantile pursuits the business man who gives a letter of recommendation to a friend to enable him to obtain credit from a stranger is regarded as morally responsible for the integrity of his friend and his ability to meet his obligations. A reformatory law which would enforce this principle against all indorsers of persons for public place would insure great caution in making recommendations. A salutary lesson has been taught the careless and the dishonest public servant in the great number of prosecutions and convictions of the last two years.|$|R
