40|$|Commission {{to analyze}} and better {{understand}} a series of degraded pipe tests under seismic loading that were conducted in Japan. These efforts were undertaken as part of collaborative efforts between the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the Japan Nuclear Energy Safety Organization (JNES), who conducted a multi-year test program for the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan to investigate the behavior of typical Nuclear Power Plant piping systems under large seismic loads. JNES provided the test results for the evaluations given in this report. Emc 2 worked with BNL on the degraded piping system analyses. This report describes Emc 2 ’s post-test analyses of the large-scale piping system tests and discusses insights gained from this program. The analyses in these efforts are of value to understanding margins that degraded piping has under seismic loading for: (a) Transition Break Size rule for CFR 50. 46 a applications, (b) Leak-Before-Break analyses in NRC’s SRP 3. 6. 3, and (c) pipe flaw tolerance by ASME code evaluations. The JNES tests analyzed were of both the simple degraded component tests, e. g., a nozzle with a short section of straight pipe and a circumferential surface crack in the joining girth weld; as well as combined component tests from a 1 / 3 -scale section of the main recirculation system of a BWR. The combined component tests had circumferential cracks at a nozzle girth weld and <b>elbow</b> <b>girth</b> weld of the main pip...|$|E
