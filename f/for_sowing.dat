40|$|Currently, swine {{building}} ventilation {{design is}} based on heat and moisture rates measured in the 1950 s and 1970 s. Advancements in genetics, nutrition and management practices to increase productivity and pork quality during this period likely have led to considerable changes in heat and moisture production rates of the animals and their housing systems. This study quantifies total heat production rate (THP), house-level moisture production rate (MP) and house-level sensible heat production rate (SHP) of a 4300 -sow breeding, gestation, and farrowing facility in Iowa for 17 consecutive months. THP was determined using indirect animal calorimetry, MP was determined from mass balance, and SHP was calculated as the difference between THP and latent heat production (LHP). A Mobile Air Emission Monitoring Unit (MAEMU) was installed to monitor the deep-pit breeding-early gestation barn (1800 head), the deep-pit late gestation barn (1800 head), and two shallow-pit (pull-plug) farrowing rooms (40 head per room). This paper reports on data collected from February 2012 through {{the completion of the}} study in June 2013. Preliminary results from the study show that THP averages 373 W/sow <b>for</b> <b>sows</b> in the breeding/early gestation stage, 376 W/sow <b>for</b> <b>sows</b> in the late gestation stage, and 1191 W/sow+litter <b>for</b> <b>sows</b> and litters in the lactation stage. The house-level MP averages 198 g/hr-sow <b>for</b> <b>sows</b> in the breeding/early gestation stage, 192 g/hr-sow <b>for</b> <b>sows</b> in the late gestation stage, 818 g/hr-sow <b>for</b> <b>sows</b> and litters in the lactation stage.

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} the long-term impact of zinc (Zn) supplementation on claw lesions, claw conformation, and histological and mechanical claw characteristics of sows housed in groups on rubber top layer or concrete floors during gestation. Materials and methods: Six groups of 21 ± 4 sows were allotted to group housing on different floor types for 80 days during gestation. Within each group, sows were randomly allocated {{to one of}} three diets supplementing a basal diet (46. 6 and 128. 9 mg Zn per kg during gestation and lactation, respectively) with 0, 50, or 100 mg Zn per kg.

Histological and mechanical characteristics were evaluated on claw samples of 36 sows after slaughter.

The aims of our study were to derive equations <b>for</b> <b>sow</b> RFI during lactation (SRFI) and to evaluate the effect of selection for RFI during growth on sow traits during lactation. Data were obtained on 2 divergent lines selected for 7 generations for low and high RFI during growth in purebred Large Whites. The RFI was measured on candidates for selection (1, 065 pigs), and sow performance data were available <b>for</b> 480 <b>sows</b> having from 1 to 3 parities (1, 071 parities). Traits measured were sow daily feed intake (SDFI); sow BW and body composition before farrowing and at weaning (28. 4 +/- 1. 7 d); number of piglets born total, born alive, and surviving at weaning; and litter weight, average piglet BW, and within-litter SD of piglet BW at birth, 21 d of age (when creep feeding was available), and weaning. Sow RFI was defined as the difference between observed SDFI and SDFI predicted <b>for</b> <b>sow</b> maintenance and production. Daily production requirements were quantified by litter size and daily litter BW gain as well as daily changes in sow body reserves. The SRFI represented 24 % of the phenotypic variability of SDFI. Heritability estimates for RFI and SRFI were both 0. 14. The genetic correlation between RFI and SRFI was 0. 29 +/- 0. 23. Genetic correlations of RFI with sow traits were low to moderate, consistent with responses to selection; selection for low RFI during growth reduced SDFI and increased number of piglets and litter growth, but also increased mobilization of body reserves. No effect on rebreeding performance was found. Metabolic changes previously observed during growth in response to selection might explain part of the better efficiency of the low-RFI sows, decreasing basal metabolism and favoring rapid allocation of resources to lactation. We propose to consider SRFI as an alternative to SDFI to select <b>for</b> efficient <b>sows</b> with reduced input demands during lactation...|$|R
