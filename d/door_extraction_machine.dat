40|$|Abstract — This paper {{focused on}} {{fabrication}} of areca fiber <b>extraction</b> <b>machine.</b> This is basically removing fiber from areca husk. The areca husk is outer cover of areca nut {{which consists of}} fiber. These fibers are being extracted manually. This has several problems such has time consuming, low production rate, human error, low quality fiber, more workers and skilled labours. This paper aims {{to overcome these problems}} by fabricating areca fiber <b>extraction</b> <b>machine</b> which automates the fiber <b>extraction</b> process. This <b>machine</b> consists of 3 phase ac motor which is directly coupled to driven shaft. The driven shaft is enclosed in a casing which is designed {{in such a way that}} only dust is removed and fiber comes out of rectangular duct at lower side of casing. The driven shaft is supported by two bearings and has blades which are designed by modifying the blade design of coconut husk decorticating machine. Thus this machine will be helpful for rural entrepreneurs and farmers. Keywords—Areca fiber, Blade, <b>Extraction</b> <b>machine.</b> I...|$|R
50|$|The {{objectives}} of post-treatment vary between different industries where {{in order to}} perform an efficient and economical process; the decanter centrifuge must be tailored to the task at hand. In the food manufacturing industry, decanter centrifuges are utilised in oil <b>extraction</b> <b>machines.</b> An oil <b>extraction</b> <b>machine</b> can process up to fifteen metric tonnes per hour of organic wastes and are found either within the process plant or outdoors if designed for the climate. The waste material enters the inlet chute and is softened into a sludge which is then steam heated. This mixture then enters a three-phase decanter centrifuge, {{also known as a}} tricanter centrifuge.|$|R

40|$|This was a {{collaborative}} report by 4 mechanical engineering students. A pharmaceutical company makes {{a product that}} requires them to extract medical grade salve from tubes {{so that it can}} be mixed with another salve. Currently, the company has workers manually twist off the caps and put the tubes into an <b>extraction</b> <b>machine.</b> This current method has caused several workers to develop wrist problems and does not allow the company to meet demand. A process was created to automate the removal of the caps from the salve tubes. A feed system was designed to be able to be able to be continuously loaded with multiple tubes and feed one tube at a time into the tube holder. A tube holder was designed to hold the body of a tube firmly so that the cap can be cut without salve being squeezed out. A cutting process was created based off of finite element analysis of the interaction of a blade tip and the tube. A blade cuts the cap off of the tube after it is fed into the tube holder. An assembly using two linear actuators was designed to move the tube holder over and up into the <b>extraction</b> <b>machine</b> consisting of a squeezing roll set. Motion analysis using data from real components found that the designed machine can run with a three second cycle time. This simulated cycle time would allow the company to meet their production demand. The designed machine would cost roughly $ 5, 487. B. A. (Bachelor of Arts...|$|R
