40|$|Abstract The goal of {{this chapter}} is to provide an opinionated {{overview}} of the psychologically based account of <b>personal</b> <b>identity</b> {{and the role of}} agency within such an account. I describe the essential points of the psychological criterion of <b>personal</b> <b>identity.</b> Then, I discuss how the psychological criterion is related to the Reductionist View of <b>personal</b> <b>identity</b> and whether it is committed to what Derek Parfit names the Extreme Claim. I further discuss how the agency-based views of <b>personal</b> <b>identity</b> can be accommodated within Derek Parfit’s psychologically based view of <b>personal</b> <b>identity.</b> I end the chapter by discussing how an agency-based view, as most notably developed by Christine Korsgaard, could be used to vindicate practical concerns that are traditionally related to <b>personal</b> <b>identity...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{paper offers}} {{an account of}} how {{individuals}} act as agents when we employ a narrative approach to explaining their <b>personal</b> <b>identities.</b> It applies Korsgaard's idea of a "reflective structure of consciousness" to provide foundations for a richer account of the individual economic agent, and uses this to explain and distinguish the concepts of <b>personal</b> <b>identity,</b> individual identity, and social identity. The paper argues that individuals' <b>personal</b> <b>identities</b> may be in conflict with their socially constructed individual identities. Individuals' social identities are represented as a link between <b>personal</b> <b>identity,</b> and individual identity. The overall framework is proposed {{as an alternative to}} the atomistic individual conception and a contribution to the socially embedded individual conception...|$|R

40|$|In post-traditional societies, {{identity}} has been pervasively {{understood as a}} ‘thing’ one needs to and can endeavour to achieve or create. Many studies about identity in the {{humanities and social sciences}} have increasingly been approached in both reified and impersonal ways. These trends in understanding identity have made a significant impact on research into education and identity. This thesis aims to demonstrate the complexity of <b>personal</b> <b>identity</b> on a theoretical level and endeavours to rethink the theoretical understanding of <b>personal</b> <b>identity</b> in relation to the notion of learning. Based on Paul Ricoeur and Charles Taylor’s theories of <b>personal</b> <b>identity,</b> this thesis argues that <b>personal</b> <b>identity</b> needs to be understood both as sameness and as selfhood at a conceptual level. Ontologically, the former belongs to the category of ‘thing’, ‘substance’ in terms of permanence in time. The latter belongs the category of ‘being’ in terms of permanence in time. This thesis will argue that this conceptual understanding of <b>personal</b> <b>identity</b> suggests that identity is largely ‘shaped’ by social, cultural, traditional, moral and ethical dimensions in the human world over time, rather than merely being a result of personal endeavour as an individual creation or/and an adaptation to constant social changes. The moral and ethical dimensions of <b>personal</b> <b>identity</b> also suggest that the need for and ‘meaning’ of <b>personal</b> <b>identity</b> to a person in his/her life cannot be simply approached in an objective manner through impersonal terms. Rather, <b>personal</b> <b>identity</b> constitutively depends on self-interpretation, which highlights the role of narrative in understanding <b>personal</b> <b>identity.</b> This thesis further argues that a new understanding about reflexive learning relevant to <b>personal</b> <b>identity</b> can be drawn from this theoretical understanding of <b>personal</b> <b>identity</b> and narrative. This new understanding is based on a person’s reflexivity not only in the dialectical frameworks between sameness, self and others, but also in different moral frameworks. What this presents us with is a different view of lifelong learning as an alternative to lifelong learning implied in the notion of a ‘reflexive project of the self’.

40|$|The {{issue of}} <b>personal</b> <b>identity</b> and its {{management}} {{is a major}} problematic area for action, communication and representation within the information society. Surprisingly, whereas theorisation of <b>personal</b> <b>identity</b> as an individual and social construct is well-established, theorisation of identity as a technological construct is less well-formulated. This means that whereas technological developments {{in the area of}} so-called <b>personal</b> <b>identity</b> management move forward at pace, much of this research and development lacks firm theoretical underpinnings. This paper builds upon previous work and attempts a tentative theorisation of the issue of <b>personal</b> <b>identity</b> in terms of a framework we refer to as the enactment of significance. We argue that this conception better enables us to understand more clearly the way in which <b>personal</b> <b>identity</b> is enacted through the complex entanglement of action, communication and representation and the bearing such entanglement has on contemporary considerations of information, systems and technology...|$|R

40|$|Many {{critics of}} {{increasing}} {{freedom of trade}} and of movement, and the phenomena of cosmopolitanism and globalization that result from such freedom, insist that the consequence of greater trade and movement is {{a net loss of}} identity. Globalization is, they allege, destructive of <b>personal</b> <b>identity</b> itself, which they see as reliant on sharply delineated differences among cultures. This paper sets out the anti-globalist critique and then shows that cosmopolitanism and globalization are hardly new phenomena, but have deep roots in European civilization. The threat allegedly posed by globalization to <b>personal</b> <b>identity</b> is described and the arguments of its main proponents given, followed by a critique of the theory of <b>personal</b> <b>identity</b> implicit in the argument and an alternative theory of <b>personal</b> <b>identity</b> (a “focal theory”) is described; that theory is both truer to lived human experience and fully compatible with the securing of <b>personal</b> <b>identity</b> {{in the context of an}} increasingly globalized world of free individuals...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to unpack some of the socio-technical {{relationships}} inherent in contemporary notions of <b>personal</b> <b>identity</b> management. For this purpose it considers the issue of <b>personal</b> <b>identity</b> management in terms of a framework, which distinguishes between the related processes of authentication, identification and enrolment. Design/methodology/approach – The conceptual model described in this paper is reflected against an important recent case in which issues of <b>personal</b> <b>identity</b> management are being enacted: the introduction of a UK national identity card. Both this issue and case are particularly examined in the light of the growth of e-Government in the UK. Findings – The paper relates issues associated with the technical infrastructure of e-Government with some of the costs and benefits associated with the social infrastructure of e-Government. This device offers a useful framing for a whole range of issues surrounding individual-organisation interaction in the Information Society that rely on elements of <b>personal</b> <b>identity</b> management. Research limitations/implications – In the paper the issue of <b>personal</b> <b>identity</b> management is under-represented in the Information Systems and Information Management literature. The conceptual approach adopted in the paper is used to identify areas of further research in terms of issues relevant to the technical infrastructure of e-Government. Practical implications – The paper identifies a number of <b>personal</b> <b>identity</b> management issues embedded in the technical infrastructure required for effective e-Government. Originality/value – This paper raises the importance of <b>personal</b> <b>identity</b> management to the success of the e-Government agenda. It also links classic information management issues to the issue of <b>personal</b> <b>identity</b> management and identifies the challenges for e-Government within this...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{is to provide a}} brief {{examination}} of the historical accounts of philosophical theories of <b>personal</b> <b>identity</b> and show the influence that each has had on the development of contemporary theories. In doing so, the thesis explores the problems associated with these theories, attempting to establish a meta-theory (i. e. a theory about theories) of <b>personal</b> <b>identity.</b> What is demonstrated is that the fundamental problems of <b>personal</b> <b>identity</b> arise from issues related to the use of language, as well as assumptions involving the concept of personhood. By demonstrating that our understanding of personhood is relative to frameworks of understanding based on assumption, the meta-theory states that propositions made about persons are not factual statements, but are, rather, matters of contingency. As such, propositions about persons contain truth-value only within a particular frame of reference that is based on these assumptions. Therefore, the problems that traditionally arise in theories of <b>personal</b> <b>identity</b> [...] problems with dualism, the mental criterion, and bodily criterion [...] result from a flawed approach to the problem altogether. The conclusion is {{that it is possible to}} construct a theory of <b>personal</b> <b>identity</b> (a relative theory), but not the theory of <b>personal</b> <b>identity</b> (one which is definitive and strictly conclusive) ...|$|R
50|$|People {{who have}} no Swedish <b>personal</b> <b>identity</b> number can receive a {{co-ordination}} number (samordningsnummer) instead.

It is structured along the same lines, but with the day in the date of birth advanced by 60 (giving a number between 61 and 91). The reason for this routine {{is that there is a}} risk of running out of <b>personal</b> <b>identity</b> numbers. It is easier to get a co-ordination number than a <b>personal</b> <b>identity</b> number because the latter require evidence of work or education which would last at least a year, so many students or workers get a co-ordination number first and later a <b>personal</b> <b>identity</b> number. A Swedish <b>identity</b> card require <b>personal</b> <b>identity</b> number, while a bank account is troublesome to get with only a co-ordination number.|$|R
