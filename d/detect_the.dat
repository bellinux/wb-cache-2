5|$|Design {{of novel}} {{biocatalysts}} and biosensors.

5|$|Gamma ray {{astronomy}} observes astronomical objects at {{the shortest}} wavelengths {{of the electromagnetic}} spectrum. Gamma rays may be observed directly by satellites such as the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory or by specialized telescopes called atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes. The Cherenkov telescopes do not <b>detect</b> <b>the</b> gamma rays directly but instead <b>detect</b> <b>the</b> flashes of visible light produced when gamma rays are absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|A {{series of}} almost-collisions in 2005 in similar {{circumstances}} {{in the tunnel}} between Foggy Bottom and Rosslyn stations led to a new test procedure which would have identified the faulty circuit after installation.

5|$|Another {{potential}} health problem is {{spinal muscular atrophy}} (SMA), another genetically inherited disease which causes {{the loss of the}} spinal-cord neurons which activate the skeletal muscles of the trunk and limbs. Symptoms are normally seen within 3–4 months of age and result in muscle atrophy, muscle weakness, and a shortened life span. A test is offered to <b>detect</b> <b>the</b> genes responsible for SMA.|$|E
5|$|Cadmium zinc {{telluride}} (CZT) is a semiconductive alloy {{that can}} be divided into an array of small sensing devices.

When behind an absorbing mask, the CZT sensor array can determine the direction of the rays.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} leading up to D-Day, {{full-scale}} rehearsals of Operation Peppermint were carried out in order to test the plan and the equipment.

50|$|An aspirating smoke {{detector}} (ASD) {{is a system}} used in active fire protection, consisting of a central detection unit which draws air through a network of pipes to <b>detect</b> smoke. <b>The</b> sampling chamber {{is based on a}} nephelometer that <b>detects</b> <b>the</b> presence of smoke particles suspended in air by <b>detecting</b> <b>the</b> light scattered by them in the chamber. ASDs can typically detect smoke before it is visible to the naked eye.|$|R

Type 123A could <b>detect</b> <b>the</b> distance to underwater sounds but could not determine the depth.|$|E

5|$|A {{search of}} this star by the Hubble Space Telescope {{revealed}} no stellar companions, although {{this does not}} preclude the presence of smaller companions that are below the telescope's detection limit, such as a planet orbiting within one astronomical unit of the star. No excess infrared emission has been detected, which may indicate {{the lack of a}} debris disk in orbit around it. Radial velocity measurements of this star using the Near Infrared Spectrometer (NIRSPEC) instrument at the Keck II observatory have not revealed any variations that might otherwise indicate the presence of an orbiting companion. This instrumentation is sensitive enough to <b>detect</b> <b>the</b> gravitational perturbations massive, short period companions with the mass of Neptune or greater.|$|E
5|$|Adult female rabbit fleas, Spilopsyllus cuniculi, can <b>detect</b> <b>the</b> {{changing}} {{levels of}} cortisol and corticosterone hormones in the rabbit's blood that indicate {{it is getting}} close to giving birth. This triggers sexual maturity in the fleas and they start producing eggs. As soon as the baby rabbits are born, the fleas make their way down to them and once on board they start feeding, mating, and laying eggs. After 12 days, the adult fleas make {{their way back to}} the mother. They complete this mini-migration every time she gives birth.|$|E
5|$|After 24 hours, only 2,500 {{men of the}} 101st and 2,000 of the 82nd Airborne {{were under}} the control of their divisions, {{approximately}} a third of the force dropped. This wide dispersal had the effect of confusing the Germans and fragmenting their response. The 7th Army received notification of the parachute drops at 01:20, but Rundstedt did not initially believe that a major invasion was underway. The destruction of radar stations along the Normandy coast in the week before the invasion meant that the Germans did not <b>detect</b> <b>the</b> approaching fleet until 02:00.|$|E

5|$|Although chest {{radiography}} {{is an important}} part of the diagnosis, it is often not sensitive enough to <b>detect</b> <b>the</b> condition early after the injury. In a third of cases, pulmonary contusion is not visible on the first chest radiograph performed. It takes an average of sixhours for the characteristic white regions to show up on a chest X-ray, and the contusion may not become apparent for 48hours. When a pulmonary contusion is apparent in an X-ray, it suggests that the trauma to the chest was severe and that a CT scan might reveal other injuries that were missed with X-ray.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{including}} {{birds and}} turtles can <b>detect</b> <b>the</b> Earth's magnetic field, {{and use the}} field to navigate during migration. Some {{researchers have found that}} cows and wild deer tend to align their bodies north-south while relaxing, but not when the animals are under high-voltage power lines, suggesting that magnetism is responsible. Other researchers reported in 2011 that they could not replicate those findings using different Google Earth images.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{that feed}} on the spiny scallop include starfish, {{particularly}} the ochre star (Pisaster ochraceus) and the sunflower star (Pycnopodia helianthoides), octopuses and sea otters. The scallop can swim and does so to escape from predators, repeatedly opening and shutting its valves in a clapping action. Each time the valves close, water is expelled through {{a gap in the}} mantle on the dorsal side of the hinge and the animal moves margin first, a form of jet propulsion. It has chemoreceptors on the mantle margins which <b>detect</b> <b>the</b> approach of a starfish and enable it to take evasive action. It also responds in this way to predators that feed on sponges, such as nudibranchs of the genus Archidoris spp..|$|E
