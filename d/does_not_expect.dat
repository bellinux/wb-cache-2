As they look out to the star of a nebula, she imagines, as the Mayans did, that their souls will meet there after life and when the star goes supernova. In the 26th century, future space {{traveler}} Tommy travels there for the event, in a spaceship made of an enclosed biosphere containing the Tree of Life he seeded above her grave.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, Scully learns that she, but not Mulder, is being {{given a chance to}} prove her worth at the FBI, and—paired with a new partner—she investigates a crime scene photographer with an uncanny knack for arriving {{just in time to see}} his victims' final moments. What she <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>expect,</b> however, is for Death to play a role himself.|$|E
5|$|As {{time goes}} by, Rumpelstiltskin and Belle develop a strong bond with each other. After {{a few months}} of living with him, Belle asks the dark one why she found children's {{clothing}} upstairs. Rumpelstiltskin tells her it belonged to his son whom he unfortunately lost along with his wife. Gaston arrives to take Belle back but Rumpelstiltskin turns him into a rose and presents it to her as a gift. When asked about Gaston, Belle says that it was an arranged marriage, not one of love. She left him because she wanted to be heroic and there are not many chances for women to be heroic. Rumpelstiltskin asks Belle to go into town to buy more straw, and she cannot believe he trusts her to come back. Rumpelstiltskin says he <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>expect</b> to see her again.|$|E

Therefore, to remove an entire vdev that is in active use, or {{to reduce the size}} of a pool, the data stored on it must be moved to other vdevs (or if easier, it can be deleted and later {{restored}} from backups/copies) so that the devices making up the vdev can be freed for other use or the pool deleted and recreated using fewer vdevs or a smaller size.|$|E
25|$|At the Intel Developer Forum on March 9, 2006, Microsoft {{announced}} {{a change in}} their plans to support EFI in Windows Vista. The UEFI 2.0 specification (which replaces EFI 1.10) was not completed until early 2006, {{and at the time}} of Microsoft's announcement, no firmware manufacturers had completed a production implementation which could be used for testing. As a result, {{the decision was made to}} postpone the introduction of UEFI support to Windows; support for UEFI on 64-bit platforms was postponed until Vista Service Pack 1 and Windows Server 2008 and 32-bit UEFI will not be supported, as Microsoft <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>expect</b> many such systems to be built as the market moves to 64-bit processors.|$|E
25|$|After {{dealing with}} {{increasing}} back pain for several seasons, Braves starter Tim Hudson underwent back surgery on November 28, 2011. Hudson {{stated that he}} had been using anti-inflammatory medication {{for the past two years}} to deal with the pain. After the procedure, Hudson's mobility has greatly improved and he anticipates that the surgery will prolong his career. Because the procedure requires three to six months for proper recovery, Hudson <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>expect</b> his 2012 debut to come until early May. In his absence Randall Delgado will occupy his rotation spot. Recovering with haste, Hudson started the final exhibition game in Florida on April 2 against the New York Mets. In two scoreless innings of work, Hudson allowed only one hit and struck out two while throwing every pitch in his arsenal.|$|E

As they arrive, Pozzo trips over Lucky and they together fall into a motionless heap. Estragon sees an opportunity to exact revenge on Lucky for kicking him earlier. The issue is debated lengthily until Pozzo shocks the pair by revealing {{that he is now}} blind and Lucky is now mute. Pozzo further claims to have lost all sense of time, and assures the others that he cannot remember meeting them before, but also <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>expect</b> to recall today's events tomorrow. His commanding arrogance from yesterday appears to have been replaced by humility and insight. His parting wordswhich Vladimir expands upon laterare ones of utter despair.

25|$|Provide an {{algorithm}} that secures a win for one player, or a {{draw for}} either, against any possible moves by the opponent, {{from the beginning}} of the game. That is, produce at least one complete ideal game (all moves start to end) with proof that each move is optimal for the player making it. It does not necessarily mean a computer program using the solution will play optimally against an imperfect opponent. For example, the checkers program Chinook will never turn a drawn position into a losing position (since the weak solution of checkers proves that it is a draw), but it might possibly turn a winning position into a drawn position because Chinook <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>expect</b> the opponent to play a move that will not win but could possibly lose, and so it does not analyze such moves completely.|$|E
25|$|February Shadows {{contains}} several non-traditional literary {{devices that}} became popular in Austrian {{literature in the}} 1980s in novels that dealt with subject matter relating to World War II, and especially Austria's participation in the war. Reichart utilizes these unconventional devices to illustrate Hilde's denial of pain and her struggle to remain emotionally stable. The use of fragmented sentences allows the reader to understand Hilde's inability and refusal to connect one idea to another as she attempts to repress memories. The truncated thoughts represented by the short and incomplete sentences display her own prohibition to remember the past coherently. Even Reichart's incorrect punctuation enhances the emotions of the story. Reichart often places periods {{in the middle of}} sentences, creating sharp and abrupt stops to ideas, as if Hilde is trying to smother her own thoughts. Reichart also ends interrogatives without question marks as if Hilde is hopelessly inquiring and <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>expect</b> to receive an answer.|$|E

Adams calls his game an open-ended [...] "story generator". The game's code base is proprietary, and Adams has stated {{he has no plans to}} release it into the open source domain, citing the risk of them going into financial trouble. He explained he would consider releasing its source if he could not maintain it anymore, seeing different game developers taking it up. He says that he does not mind any modifications as long as he is not put into risk.|$|E

There is no backward compatibility with songs or controllers from previous editions of the franchise; FreeStyleGames' developer Jamie Jackson justified the decision, explaining that Guitar Hero Live was a [...] "completely new game" [...] that existing content would not work with due to the change in core gameplay. There is not any traditional downloadable content for {{the game in the}} form of additional songs, instead using the streaming nature of GHTV to provide new songs.

500|$|In Darkly Dreaming Dexter, the two {{are already}} together, but it is {{explained}} that Dexter started dating her solely to improve his [...] "disguise" [...] as a normal person. Because she was brutalized by her now-jailed ex-husband, Rita fears intimacy and <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>expect</b> much of Dexter; this suits the asexual Dexter perfectly. By the novel's climax, Dexter admits that he is fond of her children, Astor and Cody, the closest he can get to feeling love. By a humorous misunderstanding, the couple become engaged in Dearly Devoted Dexter and married {{at the end of}} Dexter in the Dark. In the books, Rita is scatter-brained and easily upset, prone to speaking in disjointed, rambling sentences that Dexter often finds incomprehensible. The only quality that Dexter truly appreciates about her is that she is an excellent cook. She is a physical fitness buff; she and Dexter regularly go for [...] runs, long bike rides, and weightlifting sessions together. In the fifth book, Dexter is Delicious, she gives birth to Dexter's daughter Lily Anne. In Dearly Devoted Dexter, Dexter discovers that Cody and Astor are budding sociopaths and decides to provide them with the same [...] "guidance" [...] that his adoptive father Harry gave to him; namely, to teach them how to be careful, efficient killers of those who [...] "deserve it". Rita is kept in the dark about the true nature of their relationship. She suspects that something is wrong with the children when she discovers them torturing a cat, but Dexter is able to reassure her that they didn't understand what they were doing. The television series is based on Darkly Dreaming Dexter. In Dexter's Final Cut, Dexter has an affair with TV star Jackie Forrest, and briefly considers leaving Rita. At the end of the novel, however, both Rita and Jackie are murdered by Robert Chase, a pedophile intent on kidnapping Astor.|$|E
500|$|It was renewed for a {{third season}} on March 6, 2010. As part of a {{reorganization}} of its 2010 midseason line up to capture more market for American Idol, the Fox network shifted Fringe to 9:00p.m. on Fridays. [...] This timeslot, commonly considered the [...] "Friday night death slot" [...] for several previous Fox shows due to cancellation shortly following the move to that slot, left critics considering the show's fate. [...] While The X-Files originally premiered during this slot and {{would continue to be}} a highly successful series, critics were unsure if Fringe could duplicate this performance. [...] In this slot, the show competed with Supernatural, a series that attracts similar types of viewers. Fox's Entertainment President Kevin Reilly, in response to these concerns, stated that 45% of Fringes viewership is from time shifting recording through digital video receivers, and <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>expect</b> the viewership numbers to change significantly with the change to Friday. Reilly further postulated that [...] "If it does anywhere near what it did on Thursdays, we can glue that show to the schedule because it can be a big win for us". Further promoted by the critical reaction to the rescheduling, the Fox network created a self-deprecating promotional advertisement acknowledging the reputation of the time slot, including quotes from other media outlets concerned about the move, but asserted that the move would [...] "re-animate" [...] the show. The network also created a music video, set to [...] "Echoes" [...] by the band Klaxons as a means of summarizing the third season to date prior to the first Friday broadcast. Joshua Jackson, who plays Peter Bishop on the show, cautioned that time-shifted viewership {{may not be enough to}} save the show: [...] "It's not that not enough people are watching Fringe, it's that not enough people are watching Fringe during the hour that it's on the air, which is key for the network." ...|$|E
