50|$|Another {{suggestion}} by Burridge is that Akhenaten {{may have}} suffered from Marfan's Syndrome. Marfan's syndrome, unlike Froelich's, does not result in any lack of intelligence or sterility. It {{is associated with a}} sunken chest, long curved spider-like fingers (arachnodactyly), occasional congenital heart difficulties, a high curved or slightly cleft palate, and a highly curved cornea or dislocated lens of the eye, with the requirement for bright light to see well. Marfan's sufferers tend towards being taller than average, with a long, thin face, and elongated skull, overgrown ribs, a <b>funnel</b> or pigeon <b>chest,</b> and larger pelvis, with enlarged thighs and spindly calves. Marfan's syndrome is a dominant characteristic, and sufferers have a 50% chance of passing it on to their children. All of these symptoms arguably sometimes appear in depictions of Akhenaten and of his children. Recent CT scans of Tutankhamun report a cleft palate and a fairly long head, as well as an abnormal curvature of the spine and fusion of the upper vertebrae, a condition associated with scoliosis, all conditions associated with Marfan's syndrome. However, DNA tests on Tutankhamun, in 2010, proved negative for Marfan Syndrome. More recently, Homocystinuria was suggested as a possible diagnosis. Patients suffering from homocystinuria have Marfan habitus. However, as an autosomal recessive disease, it seems to fit better into Akhenaten's family tree — Akhenaten's parents, Amenhotep III and Tiye, were probably healthy, and Marfan Syndrome was ruled out following DNA tests on Tutankhamun in 2010.|$|R

40|$|Summary. Aim of {{the study}} – to {{establish}} the indications for surgical treatment of the <b>funnel</b> <b>chest.</b> Patients and methods. There was a retrospective and prospective analysis performed of the methods of investigation and treatment of 504 patients operated for the <b>funnel</b> <b>chest</b> {{during the period of}} 35 years (1968 – 2002). In order to make a right diagnosis and to establish the indications for surgical treatment a standard algorithm of investi-gations was prepared: examination, collecting the detailed life history, establishing a type and a degree of deformation, chest and column radiological examination, ECG, spirography and heart ultrasound examination. Results. On basis of physical examination and anamnestic data the most clinical signs and complaints were established. The heart compression was found in preopera-tive X-rays in 476 (94. 4 %) patients, the heart was rotated and dislocated in 441 (87. 5 %) patients. Postoperatively 96. 1 % of patients were free of the heart compression symp-toms and for 71. 8 % the heart rotation has disappeared. The pathological ECG findings were recorded for 382 (71. 8 %) patients and abnormal spirograms were taken for 31 (8. 5 %) patients. Conclusions. The following indications for the <b>funnel</b> <b>chest</b> surgical treatment were established: – obvious <b>funnel</b> <b>chest</b> diagnozed by physical examination, – complaints and disturbances clear from anamnestic data, – heart rotation and compression established by radiological examination, – pathological findings in cardiorespiratory system (ECG, echocardiography, and spirography).

40|$|Sternocostal {{elevation}} (SCE) and sternal turnover (STO) {{are effective}} methods of correction for pectus excavatum; however, few reports address {{a comparison of}} intraoperative and postoperative complications in these procedures. From 1985 to 1997 we studied the intraoperative duration, intraoperative blood loss, duration of drainage, and postoperative complications in 1, 076 <b>funnel</b> <b>chest</b> patients treated at our department. Of the 1, 076 cases, of which 841 were men and 235 were women {{with an average age}} of 10. 6 ± 8. 5 years, SCE and STO were performed on 874 and 202 patients, respectively.

40|$|Purpose: The paper {{presents}} physicochemical {{properties and}} biomechanical analysis of fixation plates made ofCr-Ni-Mo stainless steel {{used in the}} <b>funnel</b> <b>chest</b> treatment. Design/methodology/approach: The corrosion tests were realized by recording of anodic polarization curveswith {{the use of the}} potentiodynamic method. The VoltaLab® PGP 201 system for electrochemical tests wasapplied. The numerical analysis was performed for: the stabilizer of 460 mm length, 16 mm width and 4. 5 mmthickness, the stabilizer of 460 mm length, 16 mm width and 3. 5 mm thickness, the stabilizer of 460 mm length, 16 mm width and 2. 5 mm thickness. Findings: The tests showed that structure of the steel the plates were made of, met the PN-ISO 5832 - 1 standard. The surface damage is induced in the given deformation regions and is a potential reason of corrosion. The numerical analysis shows that stresses in plates didn’t exceed the yield point: for the stainless steelRp 0, 2 min = 590 MPa. Values of maximum displacements occuring in the stabilizing bar in the range of clinicallyacceptable displacements. Research limitations/implications: The obtained results are the basis for the optimization of physicochemicaland mechanical properties of the metallic biomaterial.

40|$|Moire {{topography}} is {{a simple}} non-invasive method for objectively depicting the surface contour of the body. This technique was used {{in an attempt to}} accurately and objectively measure and record the degree of deformity for various anterior chest deformities, especially <b>funnel</b> <b>chest,</b> as this remains a problem in its treatment. A new classification of three types of transverse section, determined by symmetry, and three types of longitudinal section, determined by degree of depression, as well as a new index, the ratio of the thickness of the chest wall to its width, called the Moire Index, is proposed in order to evaluate the operative results. This was applied in 30 <b>funnel</b> <b>chest</b> cases and the following conclusions were obtained; 1) The new apparatus used for Moire topography in the supine position for the measurement of chest deformities was clinically very accurate and useful. 2) The results of the classification consisted of 14 symmetric (I) type and 16 asymmetric (II, III) type in the transverse section and 3 nondepressive (A) type and 27 depressive (B, C) type in the longitudinal section. 3) According to evaluation by the Moire Index, <b>funnel</b> <b>chest</b> is a complicated deformity with depression of the sternum and costal cartilages, an asymmetrical thoracic cage, and a flat chest. 4) The sternal turnover method, developed by our department, is useful for the correction of deformity of the lower and middle part of the chest wall.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the influence of <b>funnel</b> <b>chest</b> on lung lobar volume and the correlation of lung lobar volume to the severity of <b>funnel</b> <b>chest,</b> which was measured by using computed tomographic (CT) images. Fifty-one patients with <b>funnel</b> <b>chest</b> (group 1) and 28 children without <b>funnel</b> <b>chest</b> (group 2) were selected for this study. The CT scans were obtained from the apex to the base of the lung at inspiratory phase. The outlines of the lung lobes were traced, and the area of the lung lobes in a cross-sectional plane was calculated. The lobar volume was determined by the thickness of scan space multiplied by the total area of all slices in each lobe. There was no difference between total lung capacity of group 1 and group 2. The left lower lobar volumes of group 1 was significantly smaller than group 2 (362 ± 269 ml vs 539 ± 361 ml). Both the ratios of the left lower lobar and left lung volume to the whole lung volume were significantly smaller group 1 than in group 2 (19. 39 ± 2. 88 % vs 24. 01 ± 1. 98 %, 42. 87 ± 2. 99 % vs 45. 91 ± 1. 58 %, respectively). On the other hand, ratios of the right lower lobar, left upper lobar and right lung volume to the whole lung volume were larger in group 1 (27. 71 ± 3. 32 % vs 25. 97 ± 2. 03 %, 23. 47 ± 2. 20 % vs 21. 90 ± 1. 44 %, 57. 14 ± 2. 99 % vs 54. 09 ± 1. 58 %, respectively). There were correlations between the pectus index (p= 0. 0109, r=- 0. 354) and the ratio of the left lower lobar volume to the whole lung volume to the depression rate (p= 0. 0174, r=- 0. 332) and between the pectus index (p= 0. 0053,,r,= 0. 385) and the ratio of each lung to the depression rate (p= 0. 0004,,r,= 0. 476). A new index, the ratio of the left to the right side of the heart, indicating the grade of heart displacement to the left was created and adapted for the study. The left-right ratio of the heart was significantly larger in group 1 than in group 2 (82. 0 ± 4. 7 vs 67. 8 ± 3. 0), and there were correlations of the left-right ratio of the heart to the ratio of the right upper lobar volume (p= 0. 0443, r= 0. 227), the right lower lobar (p= 0. 0043, r= 0. 318), the left upper lobar volume (p= 0. 0014, r= 0. 353), the left lower lobar volume (p< 0. 0001, r=- 0. 675) and each lung to the whole lung volume (p< 0. 0001,,r,= 0. 528).

40|$|AbstractObjective: The {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to assess how}} a surgical correction of <b>funnel</b> <b>chest</b> modifies right ventricular structure and function. Methods: Before and 6 months after surgery in 42 patients (27 male and 15 female patients, aged 5 - 31 years), a pectus index was calculated and echocardiographic examinations of the right ventricle were performed, with calculation of systolic, diastolic, and stroke volume indices. Right ventricular volume was estimated by subtracting the left ventricular volume {{from that of the}} entire heart. The values of the right ventricular volumes and the pectus index before and after the operation, as well as the changes in the indices, were compared. Results: Statistically significant changes in the pectus index and the right ventricular volume indices after surgery were noted. No correlation was observed between the changes in the pectus index and the changes in any right ventricular volume indices.

The incidence {{in the general population}} has been reported 7. 9 / 1000 based on examinations of 15000 individuals in London. During the period from March 1963 to January 1991, there were 61 procedures performed for correction of <b>funnel</b> <b>chest</b> at the Department of Thoracic Surgery, University Hospital, Landspitalinn, Reykjavik, Iceland. The patients ranged from 4 to 36 years of age, 45 males and 16 females. Fifty three were considered to have severe deformity and 8 less severe. All the procedures for <b>funnel</b> <b>chest</b> were performed in the same way after 1970. Transverse or longitudinal skin incisions were made over the sternum, the depressed costal cartilages on both sides were resected subperichondrially, transverse sternal osteotomi was done above the depressed part and the sternum lifted anteriorly and fixed with an iron rod driven through the sternum. The ends of the rod were sitting on the ribs on both sides and fixed with a wire to a rib at one end but no fixation was at the other end, thus giving the rod opportunity to move with breathing and exertion. The rod was usually removed after approximately 12 	months when the thorax was stable. The cosmetic results were considered good or fair in 54 cases but unsatisfactory in six and in one case informations were missing from the medical record. Spirometry was performed in 29 cases and showed minor deviation in pulmonary function in 13 	but was grossly abnormal in one. E. C. G. was performed in 53 cases with minor abnormality in 14 but markedly abnormal in one. Heart catheterizations were done in 2 cases one was normal and the other abnormal. It was the same patient who had severe symtoms of pulmomary and cardiac dysfunction before operation, but he became completely asymtomatic postoperatively. There was no mortality or severe complications. There were six infections but those and other minor complications could be treated easily.

40|$|ObjectiveThe Erlangen {{technique}} of <b>funnel</b> <b>chest</b> correction {{is carried out}} through an anterior incision, and an essential step is retrosternal mobilization. After elevation of the funnel, the chest wall is stabilized with a lightweight transsternal metal implant. Forces necessary to elevate the chest wall were measured at defined intervals during the operation to prospectively assess the effect of peristernal and retrosternal dissection. MethodsOver a 3 -year period, systematic tension measurements were carried out on 100 consecutive patients with symmetric <b>funnel</b> <b>chest</b> to assess the effect of individual steps in mobilization of the sternum. ResultsWhereas in adolescents the extraction force is about 175 N, in adults {{it is not possible}} to elevate the sternum to the desired level without surgical mobilization because the force required is, on average, more than 200 N. Only about 50 % of this tension can be eliminated by costal chondrotomy. To reduce the tension further and achieve a stable result without the need for heavy-duty internal fixation, we carry out a retrosternal dissection, including removal of the slips of the diaphragm and the insertions of the transversus thoracis muscle. The mean tension at the end of the procedure is 25 N. ConclusionsOur measurements show that retrosternal dissection is the decisive step in the Erlangen technique, which might explain the low relapse rate and allow for a less extensive anterolateral mobilization...|$|E

40|$|Summary. A {{very rare}} case is being described; common pleural cavity was accidentally {{diagnosed}} in a 3 -year-old boy operated for <b>funnel</b> <b>chest</b> (pectus excavatum). During 36 years 516 patients were operated in our department and we often notice pectus excavatum associated with {{other types of}} congenital pathology but only one had the common pleural space. In normal human beings pleural space is divided into left and right chambers sepa-rated by the mediastinum with no communication in between. In some mammals such as pigs, cows etc. a congenital communication is found between the pleural cavities, but this type of communication is very rare in humans and most often is of acquired origin. Pleural communication may also develop after major cardiothoracic surgery. In this case a 3 -year-old male patient was admitted for the elective surgery on pectus excavatum. Clinical exami-nation showed a very deep <b>funnel</b> <b>chest.</b> Both the heart and the mediastinum are left-shifted by the deformed breastbone; it is clearly demonstrated on a plain and lateral X-ray. On the left, beside the main vessels, an indistinct patch is noted. Typical M. Ravitch procedure was performed, by accident the pleural space was opened. Both pleural cavities had an evident communication along the anterior mediastinum. The torn pleura was sutured, the excess air removed by a puncture. Postoperative period was uneventful, additional treatment was not needed; currently the boy is feeling well.

Unfortunately, the baby died in urosepsis and renal failure in his 3 rd week of life, despite urine drainage surgery and peritoneal dialysis undertaken. According {{to the best of our}} knowledge, this is an unique combination of rare anomalies in PBS patients...|$|E
40|$|Variability in patients' {{postoperative}} pain experience {{and response to}} treatment challenges effective pain management. Variability in pain reflects individual differences in inhibitory pain modulation and psychological sensitivity, which in turn may be clinically relevant for the disposition to acquire pain. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effects of conditioned pain modulation and situational pain catastrophizing on {{postoperative pain}} and pain persistency. Preoperatively, 42 healthy males undergoing <b>funnel</b> <b>chest</b> surgery completed the Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and Beck's Depression Inventory before undergoing a sequential conditioned pain modulation paradigm. Subsequently, the Pain Catastrophizing Scale was introduced and patients were instructed to reference the conditioning pain while answering. Ratings of movement-evoked pain and consumption of morphine equivalents were obtained during postoperative days 2 - 5. Pain was reevaluated at six months postoperatively. Patients reporting persistent pain at six months follow-up (n =  15) were not significantly different from pain-free patients (n =  16) concerning preoperative conditioned pain modulation response (Z =  1. 0, P =  0. 3) or level of catastrophizing (Z =  0. 4, P =  1. 0). In the acute postoperative phase, situational pain catastrophizing predicted movement-evoked pain, independently of anxiety and depression (β =  1. 0, P =  0. 007) whereas conditioned pain modulation predicted morphine consumption (β = - 0. 005, P =  0. 001). Preoperative conditioned pain modulation and situational pain catastrophizing were not associated with the development of persistent postoperative pain following <b>funnel</b> <b>chest</b> repair. Secondary outcome analyses indicated that conditioned pain modulation predicted morphine consumption and situational pain catastrophizing predicted movement-evoked pain intensity in the acute postoperative phase. These findings may have important implications for developing strategies to treat or prevent acute postoperative pain in selected patients. Pain may be predicted and the malfunctioning pain inhibition mechanism as tested with CPM may be treated with suitable drugs augmenting descending inhibition...|$|E
40|$|Correção simultânea de defeito congênito intracardíaco e {{pectus excavatum}} Simultaneous repair of {{congenital}} heart defect and pectus excavatum The author describes the simultaneous treatment of pectus excavatum and congenital intracardiac defect (atrial septal defect) {{represented by the}} interatrial foramen secundum. An 8 -year-old boy, with clinical and echocardiography diagnosis of atrial septal defect associated with pectus excavatum was referred to a simultaneous surgical treatment of both abnormalities. The simultaneous surgical treatment of both pectus excavatum and congenital intracardiac defects {{make it difficult to}} access the heart. In this case, the simultaneous surgical treatment of atrial septal defect and pectus excavatum was a valuable alternative to surgical repair of both abnormalities, mainly due to its cosmetic outcome.

40|$|Objective: {{the study}} is {{concerned}} with the analysis of influence of severity and presence of certain phenotypic signs of nonspecific dysplasia of connective tissue (NDCT) on manifestation and rate of progression of <b>funnel</b> <b>chest</b> deformity (FCD) in children. Materials and methods. 98 patients with FCD aged from 4 to 18 years have been examined. The degree of FCD has been estimated by the index of Gizhytskaya (IG). The structure of phenotypic signs of NDCT has been determined according to M. J. Glesby (1989), the severity of the NDCT has been evaluated by L. N. Phomina tables (2000). Results. It is established, that the degree of FCD in children is significantly associated with severity of NDCT. Conclusion. Prognostically unfavourable factor for rapid progression of FCD in children has been determined by the prevalence of skeletal and articular manifestations among phenotypic signs of NDCT against the background of minimal changes of the skin...|$|E
40|$|The {{penetration}} of ticarcillin and clavulanate into cartilage {{was investigated in}} 20 subjects undergoing <b>funnel</b> <b>chest</b> correction. Cartilage samples, obtained 120 or 180 min after administration of ticarcillin/clavulanate (mean dose: ticarcillin 700 mg/kg, clavulanate 4 - 7 mg/kg), were divided into core samples and outer covering portions. After 120 min, the mean ticarcillin in the outer portion was 110 mg/kg {{and that in the}} core sample was 0 - 81 mg/kg; at 180 min the mean concentration in the outer portion was 6 - 47 mg/kg and ticarcillin was undetectable in all but two core samples. Clavulanate was shown to decline with time in spiked cartilage preparations and the results in this investigation may underestimate penetration. Clavulanate was unde-tectable in most core samples. In the outer portion the mean concentration was 1 - 30 mg/kg at 120 min and 0 - 62 mg/kg at 180 min. The penetration gradient requires further elucidation and should be considered when chemotherapy for infection in cartilage is discussed...|$|E
