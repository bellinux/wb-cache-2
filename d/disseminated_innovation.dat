50|$|From 1961-2014, {{the nonprofit}} Human Interaction Research Institute (HIRI) helped nonprofits, funders and {{communities}} handle {{the challenges of}} innovation and change, using behavioral science strategies. The Institute was based in Los Angeles. Its work ranged from research, to technical assistance on systems change, to <b>disseminating</b> <b>innovations</b> or helping others to do so. The emphasis in all these activities was on the complex human dynamics of change - how to get people personally committed to change and feel rewarded for their involvement, and how to address people's fears and resistances about change.|$|R

40|$|Sharing {{learning}} {{designs that}} have been previously trialled and proven successful {{is a means of}} <b>disseminating</b> <b>innovation</b> and best teaching practice whilst at the same time conserving teacher time and effort. Generic learning designs provide a lesson scaffold that can introduce innovative teaching strategies to lecturers without requiring them to become experts in learning design or theory. The LAMS Activity Planner is a tool that uses generic learning designs to provide comprehensive guidance for academics that will assist them in the development of inspiring learning design examples and supportive activities. In this paper, two learning design examples, WebQuests and Web Dilemma, illustrate how generic learning designs can be used to share and reuse good teaching practice...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about {{innovation}} and power. Human nature {{has always been}} expressed by our capacity to innovate and adapt to almost any environment (Bowlby, 1962; Giddens, 1991). In the 20 th century, the primary function of business organisations was to invent, produce and commercialise their products and services in different markets. As a matter of fact, business organisations {{in the last century}} proved to be the best way of <b>disseminating</b> <b>innovation</b> (Schön, 1971). Currently in the 21 st century, there is a call to better understand how new ideas, technology and sources of knowledge are managed, {{based on the premise that}} novelty can unfold anywhere and that innovation cannot be considered a linear process consisting of a chain of activities...|$|R
40|$|Two {{organizational}} structures for a retail chain are examined for {{their effect on}} the rate of firm innovation. A centralized organization is defined as one in which store practices are mandated from corporate headquarters (HQ) and this results in HQ being the sole source of new ideas. A decentralized organization gives freedom to store managers to adopt their own ideas and <b>disseminates</b> <b>innovations</b> made by store managers. The difference in average profit between the centralized and decentralized organizations {{is found to be}} a non-monotonic function of innovative opportunities. The centralized organization is preferred when innovative opportunities are moderate while the decentralized organization is preferred when such opportunities are rich. Centralization also tends to fare better in environments in which ideas are relatively complex...|$|R
30|$|The {{conceptual}} model {{has already been}} used in practice as a research framework and has been found applicable in analyzing (governmental) programs that aim to <b>disseminate</b> organizational <b>innovations</b> {{in the form of}} management practices that are new to small and medium-size firms (Steiber and Alänge 2013 d).|$|R
40|$|Innovation {{is vital}} to the economies and {{companies}} that want to compete in an increasingly globalized world. This has been widely studied in the production of goods; however, in the service sector is poorly understood. The Knowledge Intensive Business Services (KIBS) are intermediate companies that provide services to businesses and cover several areas, from legal consulting to human resources, through research and development (R&D), accounting, marketing, etc. This paper presents a review of studies conducted to determine the relevance of KIBS regarding the generation of innovation in production and its role in the national innovation system. Research shows that the influence of KIBS helps to create and <b>disseminate</b> <b>innovation</b> in enterprises and in the regions where they operate, that is why their role is important in the innovation system and in the economy of countries...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—It {{is poorly}} {{understood}} how developers discover and adopt software development innovations such as tools, libraries, frameworks, or web sites that support developers. Yet, {{being aware of}} and choosing appropriate tools and components can {{have a significant impact}} on the outcome of a software project. In our study, we investigate link sharing on Stack Overflow to gain insights into how software developers discover and <b>disseminate</b> <b>innovations.</b> We find that link sharing is a significant phenomenon on Stack Overflow, that Stack Overflow is an important resource for software development innovation dissemination and that its part of a larger interconnected network of online resources used and referenced by developers. This knowledge can guide researchers and practitioners who build tools and services that support software developers in the exploration, discovery, and adoption of software development innovations.

Would they have spread {{very quickly and}} become the religious icons that they have become? The champions of copyright routinely claim {{that it is the}} best way to encourage and <b>disseminate</b> <b>innovation.</b> But in the past week, by odd coincidence, this writer encountered two stories that show how the market-based paradigm of copyright law is stifling religiously inspired creativity. The two cases – one involving Indonesia batik designers and the other ministers who copy or emulate sermons from the Internet – show that copyright law is not a natural, inevitable system for regulating culture; it’s a belief-system every bit as much as Christianity or Islam...|$|R
40|$|Literature {{indicates}} {{that the use of}} promising innovations in mental health care can be improved. The advancement of telepsychology is one innovation that has been utilized as a method to reduce rural health disparities and increase the number of people with access to mental health services. This paper describes a successful pilot telepsychology program implemented in a rural community to increase access to mental health services and the model’s replication and expansion into four additional communities using concepts described in an Interactive Systems Framework. The Interactive Systems Framework highlights how building local capacity specific to organizational functioning and innovations are necessary to support, deliver, and <b>disseminate</b> <b>innovations</b> within new settings. Based on the knowledge gained from this telepsychology innovation, the application of an Interactive Systems Framework and funding mechanisms are discussed...|$|R
30|$|<b>Disseminating</b> {{educational}} <b>innovations</b> via ‘mass market channels’ (Rogers [2003]) such as websites, conference presentations, and journal publications {{can raise}} awareness of an innovation.

[2010]; Rogers [2003]).|$|R
40|$|Dissemination of {{learning}} and teaching innovation in higher education requires approaches to change that are socially contextualised, dynamic and self-reflexive. This article, therefore, presents a methodology for dissemination employing an embedding heuristic and engaging in participatory action research. The embedding approach emphasises three organisational domains of action: first, the capacity of communities of practice and distributed leaders to generate organisational commitment and seed activities; second, formal and informal organisational policies and procedures that provide reciprocal processes for initiating and systematically sustaining curricular change; and, third, accessible resources, tools and databases that support implementation of innovation. The methodology is applicable for <b>disseminating</b> <b>innovations</b> beyond disciplinary silos across faculties, and more widely, potentially across universities and other institutions. Academic leaders, academic developers and others charged with facilitating pedagogical change may find this dissemination methodology applicable to embedding innovation {{in a range of}} domains, and as a useful heuristic for planning, diagnosis or evaluation...|$|R

40|$|Responding to cities' {{calls for}} aid in combating traffic {{congestion}} and urban decline, the 1956 Federal-Aid Highway Act and its Highway Trust Fund endowment {{paved the way}} for Interstate highways into American cities. As president of the American Municipal Association, Nashville's mayor, Ben West, led the charge for such funds to pay for comprehensive urban planning on a metropolitan scale. As chairman of the National Committee on Urban Transportation, he oversaw unprecedented efforts to promote and <b>disseminate</b> <b>innovation</b> in transportation planning methods - methods that Congress made mandatory for highway funds after 1962 and that remain important today. Based on archival research and interviews with transportation planners of the era, this thesis reconstructs the social, political, intellectual, and technological context out of which metropolitan transportation planning emerged in the 1950 s. In doing so, it examines the four-step method of travel demand forecasting as a product of social and municipal reform...|$|R

50|$|More recently, Doz has {{developed}} ideas around the drivers of strategic agility {{and the management}} of global innovation. In his 2008 book with former Nokia executive Mikko Kosonen, Fast Strategy, Doz drew on interviews with 150 executives to identify the capabilities that successful companies must possess {{if they are to}} adapt successfully to changes in the competitive environment that challenge their existing business models and strategies. In a parallel stream of work he developed ideas on managing innovation and learning in global organizations, which culminated in a 2012 book with Keeley Wilson, Managing Global Innovation, that presented frameworks for addressing the challenge of sourcing and <b>disseminating</b> <b>innovations</b> and best practices in a global network. Most recently, he has been exploring the application of the ideas on organizational and strategic agility developed in Fast Strategy with a number of national and regional governments, including Finland and Scotland.|$|R
30|$|As {{can be seen}} in the table, the {{influencing}} factors in the external context were all relevant both for a better understanding of and for comparing the creation, diffusion, and sustaining of the two categories of innovations. In addition, a traditional market was nonexistent in both cases so interpersonal diffusion channels were highly relevant. Decisions about how to develop the organizational innovation were mainly based on top management’s or board members’ experience and beliefs. Both cases also affect several subsystems within the organization. However, GIS is more tacit and less standardized; thus, several factors in the internal context—such as search and learning processes, transfer and implementation costs, inertia, and costs for sustaining the innovation—may presumably be negatively affected, while a wider dissemination of GIS to other companies and organizations could be limited. However, the ongoing effort to develop an ISO standard 32 might help <b>disseminate</b> <b>innovation</b> management much as the ISO 9000 and 14000 standards have diffused quality management and environmental management.|$|R

40|$|Ways {{in which}} program innovators, policy developers, and {{educational}} researchers think about {{and engage in}} <b>disseminating</b> <b>innovations</b> to schools can prove a major barrier to reform. A process for effective dissemination using the coaching model in the accelerated schools program is described here. Accelerated schools draw on three principles: unity of purpose, empowerment coupled with responsibility, and building on strengths. To help spread this philosophy, educators from the schools and from the central office are trained as primary disseminators. The rapid growth of accelerated schools is mainly due to these trained coaches who either work at the district level or {{who are responsible for}} the implementation of the accelerated schools model at their own school.

40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between firms and open source communities. Open source communities create, adopt, adapt, or <b>disseminate</b> <b>innovation</b> in a manner very different from a proprietary approach. To put this in context, we first define {{what is meant by}} open source community and then examine the roles members may play in these communities. Next, we illustrate that a firm can participate in an open source development community in different ways, depending on its level of sponsorship of that community. We assert that the degree of influence desired by the firm should connect to its business strategy and the firm needs to determine how its participation and support can be used to enhance its competitive position and provide new value to its customers. We next explore three main strategies to leverage and engage communities. We also examine how community interactions are affected by the degree of openness when engaging the community and how this relates to the firm's ability to protect the competitive advantage of its proprietary assets. This discussion will help firms with strategic planning when considering how to tap into this source of technical innovation that lies outside their boundaries...|$|R
