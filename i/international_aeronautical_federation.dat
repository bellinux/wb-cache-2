50|$|Since the Soviets {{had plenty}} of lift {{capability}} from launch vehicles derived from their R-7 Semyorka intercontinental ballistic missile, the Vostok craft was much heavier than Mercury. Details of the Vostok design were not publicly disclosed until four years after Gagarin's flight, and the identity of rocket and spacecraft designer Sergei Korolev (the Soviet counterpart to Faget and Wernher von Braun) was not publicly disclosed until {{after his death in}} 1966. The capsule was a sphere completely covered in ablative heat shield material, 2.3 m in diameter, weighing 2460 kg. This shape required covering the capsule with a nose cone to maintain a low-drag profile for launch. The interior cabin was a cylinder approximately 1 m (about the size of a telephone booth), nearly perpendicular to the capsule's longitudinal axis. The cosmonaut sat in an ejection seat with his own parachute for escape during a launch emergency. The capsule had its own parachute for landing on the ground. Although official Soviet sources (including Gagarin himself, who was forced to lie by his superiors) stated that Gagarin had landed inside his capsule (thus qualifying for the first manned spaceflight according to <b>International</b> <b>Aeronautical</b> <b>Federation</b> (IAF) rules), it was later revealed that, like subsequent Vostok cosmonauts, Gagarin had ejected and landed separately from the capsule. The capsule was serviced by an aft-facing conical equipment module 2.25 m long by 2.43 m, weighing 2270 kg containing nitrogen and oxygen breathing gasses, batteries, fuel, attitude control thrusters, and the retrorocket. It could support flights as long as ten days. The Soviets launched a total of six successful manned Vostok capsules, the last two pairs in cocurrent flights. The longest flight was just short of five days, on Vostok 5 in June 14-19, 1963.|$|E
