We investigate the nature of dynamic <b>insurance</b> <b>contracts</b> by considering both conditional and unconditional dynamic contracts. An unconditional dynamic <b>contract</b> has <b>insurance</b> companies offering <b>contracts</b> where the terms of the contract depend on time, but not on the occurrence of past accidents. Conditional dynamic contracts make the actual contract also depend on individual past performance (like in car insurances). We investigate whether allowing insurance companies to offer dynamic <b>insurance</b> <b>contracts</b> results in Pareto- improvements over static contracts. Our main results are as follows. When agents only differ in their accidental expenditures, then dynamic <b>insurance</b> <b>contracts</b> yield a welfare improvement only if dynamic contracts are conditional on past performance. When, however, agents' expenditures differ just a little bit dynamic <b>insurance</b> <b>contracts</b> are strictly Pareto improving even for unconditional dynamic contracts...|$|R

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the law {{applicable}} to <b>insurance</b> <b>contracts</b> in the EU, most notably on the Regulation No 593 / 2008 on the Law Applicable to Contractual Obligations (Rome I), which will replace the Rome Convention. The conflict of law rules relating to <b>insurance</b> <b>contracts</b> have {{always been one of}} the most complicated areas in (European) private international law. The conflict rules emanate from diverse sources - various directives and the Rome Convention - and lack cohesion and uniformity. The conversion of the Rome Convention into the Rome I Regulation was an excellent opportunity to get rid of this maze and to formulate uniform conflict rules for <b>insurance</b> <b>contracts.</b> The Commission proposal did not include a rule on <b>insurance</b> <b>contracts,</b> but a special rule was introduced during the negotiations. The difficult negotiations on this provision demonstrated clearly the complexity and delicacy of the matter. Various proposals were put forward and special consultations were launched, but the final result, laid down in Article 7 Rome I, seems to be no more than a complex compromise. The Regulation of international <b>insurance</b> <b>contracts</b> still remains unnecessarily complicated, fragmented and incomprehensible. In my opinion, therefore, the new rule in Article 7 is disappointing. Rather than removing the current divergences, the introduction of Article 7 mainly conceals them. It may be hoped that on the occasion of the evaluation of the Rome I Regulation, the conflict rules on <b>insurance</b> <b>contracts</b> will be carefully reconsidered...|$|R
