5|$|Tropical Storm Bob flooded {{roads and}} downed trees in Florida. Rough seas broke over sea walls in southwestern {{parts of the}} state, and the {{combination}} of high tides and heavy rain caused forced the closure of causeways to Sanibel Island and Marco Island, leaving the islands temporarily isolated. They were re-opened when the waters receded, though the causeway to Sanibel Island sustained some damage. Florida Power & Light Co. reported that 1,200 to 1,500residences were without power on July 23. <b>In</b> <b>Palm</b> <b>Beach</b> <b>County,</b> rainfall from the storm caused agricultural damage.|$|E
5|$|On April 10, 2008, Ice {{was arrested}} <b>in</b> <b>Palm</b> <b>Beach</b> <b>County</b> on a battery charge for {{allegedly}} kicking and hitting his wife.

Ice was ordered by a Florida court to stay away from his wife following his arrest, and to communicate with his children only if Morales accompanied him. The judge told Ice that he could only contact his wife via telephone. On April 29, 2008, Ice's lawyers, Bradford Cohen and Joseph LoRusso, were able to get the case dropped after providing the state attorney with evidence that conflicted with what was originally reported.|$|E

5|$|Along {{the east}} coast of Florida, the most severe damage was {{reported}} from Miami to Fort Pierce, particularly <b>in</b> <b>Palm</b> <b>Beach</b> <b>County.</b> In West Palm Beach, one of the most severely affected coastal cities, a total of 1,711houses were destroyed and 6,369 others suffered damage, which left about 2,100families homeless. Additionally, the hurricane demolished 268businesses and affected 490others. There were four deaths, and severe damage totaling just under $13.8 million (1928USD). At Palm Beach, which had many houses owned by wealthy individuals, approximately 1,500houses and 500businesses were destroyed. Damage totaled around $10million. Inland, many communities on the southern and eastern shores of Lake Okeechobee, such as the cities of Belle Glade, Canal Point, Chosen, Miami Locks (today Lake Harbor), Pahokee, and South Bay, were ravaged by flooding after storm surge resulted in water pouring out of the shallow lake over the small dikes. Numerous structures were swept away or destroyed, and at least 2,500people drowned. Overall, the hurricane left at least $25million in damage.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{hurricane}} remained near the coastline, Hurricane David failed to cause extreme damage in Florida. The storm's winds shattered windows in stores near {{the coast and}} caused property damage, including blowing {{the frame of the}} Palm Beach Jai Alai fronton and downing the 186-foot (57-m) WJNO AM radio tower in West Palm Beach into the Intracoastal Waterway. A few roofs were torn off, and numerous buildings were flooded from over six inches (150 mm) of rainfall. A 450-foot (140-m) crane was even snapped in two at the St. Lucie Nuclear Power Plant. The hurricane spawned over 10 tornadoes while passing over the state, though none caused deaths or injuries. Total damages in Florida amounted to $95 million ($270 million in 2005 USD), of which $30 million occurred <b>in</b> <b>Palm</b> <b>Beach</b> <b>County,</b> mostly from crop damage. Two journalists with TODAY newspaper from Brevard County followed {{the hurricane}} path from South Florida to Cocoa, FL and experienced extremely high winds as they reported on the hurricane.|$|E

5|$|Having recovered, {{the company}} worked to expand {{geographically}} into markets like Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., {{and by the}} end of 1998 reported that revenue had surpassed pre-crisis levels. Growth continued over subsequent years, in part through the $29million acquisition of Fresh Samantha, a large juice company based in Saco, Maine, in 2000. This allowed Odwalla to expand into additional East Coast markets, but incurred high transportation costs as products had to be shipped across the United States from California. To address this problem the company announced plans to build a second production facility <b>in</b> <b>Palm</b> <b>Beach</b> <b>County,</b> Florida. However, facing difficulties in obtaining building permits and allocating sufficient funds, the project was first delayed and eventually cancelled. Odwalla produced and sold products under both its own and the Fresh Samantha brand names for a few years; however, in 2003, the company decided to stop selling juice under the Fresh Samantha name and to only sell Odwalla-brand juice.|$|E
5|$|On August25, Florida's Emergency Operations Center was {{activated}} in Tallahassee {{to monitor}} {{the progress of the}} hurricane. Before Katrina moved ashore, schools and businesses were closed in the Miami area. Cruise ships altered their paths due to seaports in southeastern Florida closing. Officials in Miami-Dade County advised residents in mobile homes or with special needs to evacuate. To the north in Broward County, residents east of the Intracoastal Waterway or in mobile homes were advised to leave their homes. Evacuation orders were issued for offshore islands <b>in</b> <b>Palm</b> <b>Beach</b> <b>County,</b> and for residents in mobile homes south of Lantana Road. Shelters were opened across the region. Officials closed the Miami International Airport, Fort Lauderdale – Hollywood International Airport, Key West International Airport, and Florida Keys Marathon Airport due to the storm. In Monroe and Collier counties, schools were closed, and a shelter was opened in Immokalee.|$|E
5|$|Despite passing {{closest to}} the Florida Keys, impact was minimal, limited to {{tropical}} storm-force winds and light rainfall. The outerbands of Isaac produced heavy precipitation further north, especially in Palm Beach, St. Lucie and Indian River counties. In the former, the resultant flooding left numerous residents in Royal Palm Beach and Loxahatchee isolated. There was extensive street flooding, and water entered a few houses. Damage <b>in</b> <b>Palm</b> <b>Beach</b> <b>County</b> alone was nearly $71.6million (2012USD). Inland flooding was also reported in several other counties, though losses were generally minor. A tornado in Indian River County damaged 118mobile homes and 15single family homes. Further north in Central Florida and the Panhandle, the storm spawned four other tornadoes. Tides along the Gulf Coast of Florida caused erosion and coastal flooding in Bay, Collier, Franklin, Gulf, and Wakulla counties. Though winds caused little damage, around 113,000customers were left without electricity in South Florida. The storm resulted in two indirect fatalities, both caused by vehicles driving on slick roads in Palm Beach and Okeechobee counties. Throughout the state, damage reached approximately $91.45million.|$|E

5|$|Powerful surf {{affected}} the northern coastlines {{of the islands}} in the Greater Antilles. Strong swells also lashed the Bahamas. During most hurricanes, {{the location of the}} Bahamas prevents powerful swells of Atlantic hurricanes from striking southeast Florida. However, the combination of the location, forward speed, and strength of Isabel produced strong swells through the Providence Channel onto a narrow 10mile (16km) stretch of the southeastern Florida coastline; wave heights peaked at 14feet (4.3m) at Delray Beach. The swells capsized a watercraft and injured its twopassengers at Boynton Beach, and a swimmer required assistance to be rescued near Juno Beach. Minor beach erosion was reported <b>in</b> <b>Palm</b> <b>Beach</b> <b>County.</b> In the northern portion of the state, waves reached up to 15feet (4.5m) in height at Flagler Beach, causing the Flagler Beach Pier to be closed due to damaged boards from the waves. Rip currents from Isabel killed a surfer at an unguarded beach in Nassau County, with an additional six people requiring rescue from the currents. The beaches were later closed during the worst of the rough surf.|$|E
