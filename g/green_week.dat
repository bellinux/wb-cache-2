5|$|The Portway is {{regularly}} closed to through traffic {{in order to}} cater for other events besides routine maintenance. The annual Bristol Half Marathon in September uses the Portway {{as part of its}} route and the annual Bristol's Biggest Bike Ride also uses the road which is closed to motor traffic for the day. A series of Peaceful Portway festivals take place immediately after the sporting events while the road is still closed, allowing visitors to enjoy the scenery of the Avon Gorge without any traffic. In 2009, city councillor John Rogers proposed that the Portway be closed to motor traffic on summer Sundays to allow cycling in a car free environment. In 2015, the Portway was closed for five consecutive Sundays over May and June. The Mayor of Bristol, George Ferguson said the closure tied in with Big <b>Green</b> <b>Week,</b> an annual festival promoting eco-friendly activities around Bristol, where several events along the road were happening anyway.|$|E

500|$|Not all reviews were positive. IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning did {{not enjoy}} the green theme in the episode, reasoning that it [...] "just seemed {{to get in the}} way of everything else happening in 'Sun Tea'." [...] He was not thrilled with Jack and Tracy's storyline, noting it was missing heart and emotion, and overall it felt [...] "flat". Canning felt that Al Gore's cameo was [...] "fun but wholly unnecessary." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad gave [...] "Sun Tea" [...] a mixed review, noting [...] "I don't know how funny it was, though. I mean, sure, there was still a ton of great lines tonight... but not all of them hit the mark like they usually do." [...] Nonetheless, Sassone concluded [...] "...any 30 Rock episode with Dr. Spaceman and a couple of digs at NBC's <b>Green</b> <b>Week</b> is still a pretty good one." [...] Meredith Blake, writing for the Los Angeles Times, said this episode of 30 Rock was [...] "even more of a comedy drag race than usual." ...|$|E

500|$|Television {{columnist}} Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger {{was positive}} about the episode, writing [...] "This was the strongest overall Thursday this season for NBC's comedies, and 'Sun Tea' brought the evening to a fine close. Not all of it worked, but enough of it did... that I was left happy." [...] He opined that if the episode gave more time to Kathy being represented by Teddy Ruxpin [...] "I would have given 'Sun Tea' my stamp of approval". In regards to the environment story, Sepinwall said it [...] "tied in nicely with both Frank's disgusting jars and the apartment plot". Nick Catucci [...] of New York magazine said that the episode was [...] "chockablock with great mini-sketches, gags, and flights of fancy." [...] Catucci enjoyed Tracy's Cosby dream, while he was anesthetized, calling it [...] "delightful". The A.V. Clubs Steven Hyden enjoyed the episode, writing it was [...] "one of the funniest and most enjoyable episodes of the season." [...] Hyden commented that Liz's plot had [...] "a string of craaazy [...] jokes. But they were amusing to laugh-out-loud jokes." [...] "I wouldn't claim {{that it was an}} absolutely top tier episode [...] but what the hell, it had some pretty great moments", said Sean Gandert for Paste magazine. Gandert enjoyed Jack/Tracy and Liz's plots, respectively, was glad that Chris Parnell returned as Dr. Spaceman, and said that Gore [...] "also rarely disappoints", but was not complimentary towards NBC [...] " [...] its <b>green</b> <b>week</b> thing" [...] into [...] "Sun Tea". Time contributor James Poniewozik observed that [...] "the best bits" [...] from this episode were [...] "Teddy Ruxpin the lawyer; the declaration that 'I, Bertram Geiss, am still Daddy's fancy boy'; and, especially, the show's treatment of the Green Is Universal mandate." ...|$|E
