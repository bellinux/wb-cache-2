[...] First, proteins may be purified {{according to their}} isoelectric points by running them through a pH graded gel or an <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>column.</b> [...] Second, proteins can be separated according to their size or molecular weight via size exclusion chromatography or by SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) analysis. Proteins are often purified by using 2D-PAGE and are then analysed by peptide mass fingerprinting to establish the protein identity. This is very useful for scientific purposes and the detection limits for protein are nowadays very low and nanogram amounts of protein are sufficient for their analysis. Thirdly, proteins may be separated by polarity/hydrophobicity via high performance liquid chromatography or reversed-phase chromatography.|$|E

Three methods for the process of dissolution and loading were used. The standard bomb method, requiring the use of <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>columns</b> yielded two valid data points, which, when plotted on a Pb-U concordia diagram, show an age of formation of approximately 1560 mya. Most of the samples processed by the standard boi:ib nethod, however, were contaminated by the <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>columns.</b> Minibombs were constructed which which could dissolve small amounts of zircon and did not {{require the use of}} <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>columns.</b> In the first" minibomb technique, small numbers of zircons were dissolved.

The compounds which form complexes with these ions remained adsorbed on these columns, whereas the others were released. The subsequent elution with the mixture 1 : 1 ethanol/ 1 N sulphuric acid then allowed the extraction also of adsorbed phenols.

50|$|Mixed bed {{deionization}} is a 50/50 {{mixture of}} cation and anion resin combined {{in a single}} <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>column.</b> With proper pretreatment, product water purified from a single pass through a mixed bed <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>column</b> is the purest that can be made. Most commonly, mixed bed demineralizers are used for final water polishing to clean the last few ions within water prior to use. Small mixed bed deionization units have no regeneration capability. Commercial mixed bed deionization units have elaborate internal water and regenerant distribution systems for regeneration. A control system operates pumps and valves for the regenerants of spent anions and cations resins within the <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>column.</b> Each is regenerated separately, then remixed during the regeneration process. Because of the high quality of product water achieved, {{and because of the}} expense and difficulty of regeneration, mixed bed demineralizers are used only when the highest purity water is required.|$|E

50|$|Ion {{exchange}} {{can also}} be used to remove hardness from water by exchanging calcium and magnesium ions for sodium ions in an <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>column.</b> Liquid (aqueous) phase ion exchange desalination has been demonstrated. In this technique anions and cations in salt water are exchanged for carbonate anions and calcium cations respectively using electrophoresis. Calcium and carbonate ions then react to form calcium carbonate, which then precipitates leaving behind fresh water. The desalination occurs at ambient temperature and pressure and requires no membranes or solid ion exchangers. Theoretical energy efficiency of this method is on par with electrodialysis and reverse osmosis.|$|E

Testing in support of facility design was performed with different sizes of <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>columns</b> to provide a basis for comparing results obtained using small-scale with radioactive samples and full design-height (i. e., pilot-scale) with simulant. Results indicate good comparison between small-scale radioactive tests and pilot-scale simulant tests. Because of the cost of performing radioactive tests and the unavailability of large sample volumes, understanding scale-up of performance parameters is critical to ensure that the system will perform as designed. The consistency of scale-up of <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>columns</b> using SuperLigÒ 644 and 639 resins has been demonstrated. Maintaining constant residence time, i. e., Column Volumes per hour, yields similar breakthrough profiles with resin columns ranging from 3. 5 cm to 230 cm in height.

5000|$|A [...] "strong" [...] ion {{exchanger}} will not lose the charge on its matrix once the column is equilibrated {{and so a}} wide range of pH buffers can be used. [...] "Weak" [...] {{ion exchanger}}s have a range of pH values in which they will maintain their charge. If the pH of the buffer used for a weak <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>column</b> goes out of the capacity range of the matrix, the column will lose its charge distribution and the molecule of interest may be lost. Despite the smaller pH range of weak ion exchangers, they are often used over strong ion exchangers due to their having greater specificity. In some experiments, the retention times of weak ion exchangers are just long enough to obtain desired data at a high specificity.|$|E
50|$|The {{prevailing}} {{method to}} increase the sensitivity of analytical methods has been multi-dimensional chromatography. This practice uses other analysis techniques in conjunction with liquid chromatography. For example, mass spectrometry (MS) has very much gained in popularity as an on-line analytical technique following HPLC. It is limited, however, in that MS, like nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) or electrospray ionization techniques (ESI), is only feasible when using very small quantities of solute and solvent; LC-MS is used with nano or capillary scale techniques, but cannot be used in prep-scale. Another tactic for increasing selectivity in multi-dimensional chromatography is to use two columns with different selectivity orthogonally; ie… linking an <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>column</b> to a C18 endcapped column. In 2007, Karger reported that, through multi-dimensional chromatography and other techniques, starting with only about 12,000 cells containing 1-4μg of protein, {{he was able to}} identify 1867 unique proteins. Of those, Karger can isolate 4 that may be of interest as cervical cancer markers. Today, liquid chromatographers using multi-dimensional LC can isolate compounds at the femtomole (10−15 mole) and attomole (10−18 mole) levels.|$|E
