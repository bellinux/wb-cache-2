5|$|After Burebista's death, {{the empire}} {{he had created}} {{dissolved}} into smaller kingdoms. From the reign of Tiberius to Domitian, Dacian activity was reduced into a defensive state. The Romans abandoned plans of mounting an invasion against Dacia. In 86 AD, however, the king Decebalus successfully re-united the Dacian kingdom under his control. Domitian attempted a hasty invasion against the Dacians which ended in disaster. A second invasion later brought peace between Rome and Dacia for nearly a decade, until in 98 AD Trajan became emperor. Trajan also pursued two conquests of Dacia, the first in 101–102 AD which concluded in a Roman victory. Decebalus was forced to agree to harsh terms of peace, but did not honour them. This sparked a second invasion of Dacia in 106 AD which ended the <b>independence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dacian kingdom, and brought about its break-up.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, Croatia {{became a}} one-party Socialist federal {{unit of the}} Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Croatia was ruled by the Communists and enjoyed a degree of {{autonomy}} within the Yugoslav federation. In 1967, a group of Croatian authors and linguists published the Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Language, demanding greater autonomy for the Croatian language. The declaration contributed to a national movement seeking greater civil rights and decentralization of the Yugoslav economy, culminating in the Croatian Spring of 1971, which was suppressed by Yugoslav leadership. The 1974 Yugoslav Constitution gave increased autonomy to federal units, essentially fulfilling a goal of the Croatian Spring and providing a legal basis for <b>independence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> federative constituents.|$|E
