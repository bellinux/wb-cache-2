5|$|When Philip Sclater first {{described}} the black catbird in 1858, from a specimen collected in Omoa Honduras, he assigned {{it to the}} monotypic genus Melanoptila, which he created at the same time. At least one subsequent ornithologist assigned the species to the genus Turdus, believing {{it to be a}} thrush, but most agreed with Sclater's assessment. DNA studies have since shown that it is most closely related to various endemic Antillean mimids and the gray catbird, and it is sometimes included with the latter species in the genus Dumetella. Although some taxonomists place the birds from Mexico's Cozumel Island in a separate subspecies (M. g. cozumelana), most authorities <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> such distinction is warranted and the species is generally regarded as monotypic throughout its range.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, the U.S. Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is {{providing}} healthcare services for approximately one million {{gay and lesbian}} veterans. With {{the repeal of the}} Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell policy, more gay and lesbian veterans will be seeking medical care. However, as noted by Sherman and her coauthors, there are many concerns regarding the healthcare needs of the gay and lesbian veterans, and many veterans <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> they have adequate and equitable healthcare services from the VHA. The researchers assert that veterans who are missing quality healthcare are less likely to maintain good health and positive well-being.|$|E
500|$|Based on the {{positive}} response he had received in San Francisco, MGM again cast Tracy as a priest in Boys Town (1938). Portraying Edward J. Flanagan, a Catholic priest and founder of Boys Town, was a role Tracy took seriously: [...] "I'm so anxious {{to do a good}} job as Father Flanagan that it worries me, keeps me awake at night." [...] Tracy received strong reviews for his performance, and the movie grossed $4 million worldwide. For the second year running, Tracy received an Academy Award for Best Actor. He was humble about the recognition, saying in his acceptance speech: [...] "I honestly <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> I can accept this award... I can accept it only as it was meant to be for a great man—Father Flanagan". He immediately sent the Academy Award statuette to Flanagan. Tracy was listed as the fifth biggest money-making star of 1938.|$|E

2500|$|At an anti-war {{rally at}} the Iowa Memorial Union in Iowa City, Iowa, on October 20, 1965, 20-year-old Stephen Lynn Smith, {{a student at}} the University of Iowa, spoke to the crowd and burned his draft card.

[...] He had {{previously}} alerted newspaper reporters and two television stations, and they were present to record his act. Smith said he was against the involvement of the US in Vietnam, and that he was against the system of conscription. In November 1966 he was found guilty and placed on probation for three years.|$|E

2500|$|... "Disorders of sex development" [...] (DSD) is a contested term, defined {{to include}} {{congenital}} {{conditions in which}} development of chromosomal, gonadal, or anatomical sex is atypical. Members of the Lawson Wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Society and the European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology adopted this term in their [...] "Consensus statement on management of intersex disorders". While it adopted the term, to open [...] "many more doors", the now defunct Intersex Society of North America itself remarked that intersex is not a disorder. Other intersex people, activists, supporters, and academics have contested {{the adoption of the}} terminology and its implied status as a [...] "disorder", seeing this as offensive to intersex individuals who <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> {{there is something wrong with}} them, regard the DSD consensus paper as reinforcing the normativity of early surgical interventions, and criticizing the treatment protocols associated with the new taxonomy.|$|E

In the eccentric British group’s latest show the most explicit target is clearly the Turner Prize: the attitude {{can be summed up}} in one painting, Charles Thomson’s Sir Nicholas Serota Makes an Acquisitions Decision". 160 paintings from the show, were offered as a donation to the Tate, including Thomson's painting of Serota, but [...] "not surprisingly" [...] rejected by Serota, who said, [...] "We <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> the work is of sufficient quality in terms of accomplishment, innovation or originality of thought to warrant preservation in perpetuity in the national collection." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{bisexual}} community (also {{known as}} the bisexual/pansexual, bi/pan/fluid, or non-monosexual community) includes members of the LGBT community who identify as bisexual, pansexual or fluid. Because some bisexual people <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> they fit into either the gay or the heterosexual world, and {{because they have a}} tendency to be [...] "invisible" [...] in public, some bisexual persons are committed to forming their own communities, culture, and political movements. Some who identify as bisexual may merge themselves into either homosexual or heterosexual society. Other bisexual people see this merging as enforced rather than voluntary; bisexual people can face exclusion from both homosexual and heterosexual society on coming out. Psychologist Beth Firestein states that bisexuals tend to internalize social tensions related to their choice of partners and feel pressured to label themselves as homosexuals instead of occupying the difficult middle ground where attraction to people of both sexes would defy society's value on monogamy. These social tensions and pressure may affect bisexuals' mental health, and specific therapy methods have been developed for bisexuals to address this concern.|$|E

2500|$|The {{definition}} {{and application of}} secularism, especially the place of religion in society, varies among Muslim countries as it does among western countries. As the concept of secularism varies among secularists in the Muslim world, reactions of Muslim intellectuals to the pressure of secularization also varies. On the one hand, secularism is condemned by some Muslim intellectuals who <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> religious influence should {{be removed from the}} public sphere. On the other hand, secularism is claimed by others to be compatible with Islam. For example, the quest for secularism has inspired some Muslim scholars who argue that secular government {{is the best way to}} observe sharia; [...] "enforcing [...] through coercive power of the state negates its religious nature, because Muslims would be observing the law of the state and not freely performing their religious obligation as Muslims" [...] says Abdullahi Ahmed An-Na'im, a professor of law at Emory University and author of Islam and the secular state : negotiating the future of Shariʻa. Moreover, some scholars [...] argue that secular states have existed in the Muslim world since the Middle Ages.|$|E
2500|$|... "Copyright {{protection}} for computer software is a given, but I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> the courts should be astute to extend that protection into {{a region where}} only the functional effects of a program are in issue. There is a respectable case for saying that copyright is not, in general, concerned with functional effects, {{and there is some}} advantage in a bright line rule protecting only the claimant's embodiment of the function in software and not some superset of that software. The case is not truly analogous with the plot of a novel, because the plot is part of the work itself. The user interface {{is not part of the}} work itself. One could permute all the letters and other codes in the command names, and it would still work in the same way, and all that would be lost is a modest mnemonic advantage. To approach the problem in this way may at least be consistent with the distinction between idea and expression that finds its way into the Software Directive, but, of course, it draws the line between idea and expression in a particular place which some would say lies too far on the side of expression. I think, however, that such is the independence of the particular form of the actual codes used from the overall functioning of the software that it is legitimate to separate them in this way, and not to afford them separate protection when the underlying software is not even arguably copied." ...|$|E
