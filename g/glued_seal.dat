40|$|Iatrogenic preterm prelabor rupture of {{membranes}} (iPPROM) {{remains the}} main complication after invasive interventions into the intrauterine cavity. Here, the proteolytic stability of mussel-mimetic tissue adhesive (mussel <b>glue)</b> and its <b>sealing</b> behavior on punctured fetal membranes are evaluated. The proteolytic degradation of mussel glue and fibrin glue were compared in vitro. Critical pressures of punctured and sealed fetal membranes were determined under close to physiological conditions using a custom-made inflation device. An inverse finite element procedure {{was applied to}} estimate mechanical parameters of mussel glue. Mussel glue was insensitive whereas fibrin glue was sensitive towards proteolytic degradation. Mussel <b>glue</b> <b>sealed</b> 3. 7 mm fetal membrane defect up to 60 mbar (45 mmHg) when applied under wet conditions, whereas fibrin glue needed dry membrane surfaces for reliable <b>sealing.</b> The mussel <b>glue</b> can be represented by a neo-Hookean material model with elastic coefficient C(1) = 9. 63 kPa.

40|$|BACKGROUND:The bi 1 ayer gelatin sealing sheet was {{developed}} as a safe, effective, easy-to-handle and low-cost hemostatic agent. OBJECTIVE:To examine the feasibility of gelatin sealing sheets using a canine aterial hemorrhage mode 1. METHODS:In vivo degradation of gelatin sealing sheets was examined by implanting subcutaneously in rats. For the hemostatic and anti-adhesion efficacy investigations, femoral arteries of dogs were pricked with syringe needle to make as mall hole, and a gelatin(i. e. experimental group) or fibrin <b>glue</b> <b>sealing</b> sheet (i. e. control group) was applied on the hole to stop bleeding (n= 8). After discontinuation of the bleeding, the skin incisions were closed and re-examined 4 weeks postoperatively. RESULTS:From the degradation study, 4 h thermally treated gelatin sheet which degraded within 3 weeks in vivo was chosen for the further hemostatic study. In all cases of gelatin and fibrin <b>glue</b> <b>sealing</b> sheets, bleeding from the needle hole on canine femoral arteries was effectively stopped. Postoperative adhesions and inflammation at the site {{in the experimental group}} were significantly less than those in the control group (P< 0. 01 for adhesion scores). CONCLUSIONS:The gelatin sealing sheet was found to be as effective as the fibrin <b>glue</b> <b>sealing</b> sheet as a surgical hemostatic agent, and more effective in preventing postoperative adhesions. 博士（医学）・甲第 632 号・平成 27 年 3 月 16 日Copyright © 2015 IOS Pres...|$|R

40|$|Background and Study Aims. When {{performing}} endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) {{for patients}} on antithrombotic agents, {{the frequency of}} delayed bleeding is expected to increase. Th endoscopic polyglycolic acid (PGA) felt and fibrin <b>glue</b> <b>sealing</b> method could be a new method for prevention of delayed bleeding. Patients and Methods. The safety and efficacy of the endoscopic tissue sealing method with PGA sheets and fibrin glue {{for the prevention of}} post-ESD bleeding were examined in 104 patients taking antithrombotic agents. During the study period, 70 patients taking antithrombotic agents did not undergo the sealing method, 36 patients discontinued antithrombotic agents, and 724 patients had not received antithrombotic therapy. Results. Delayed bleeding rates were 3. 8 % (4 / 104) in the sealing group, 12. 9 % (9 / 70) in the nonsealing group, 8. 3 % (3 / 36) in the discontinuation group, and 4. 6 % (33 / 724) in the nonantithrombotic therapy group. Thus, the delayed bleeding rate was signific ntly lower in the sealing group than in the nonsealing group and comparable to that in the nonantithrombotic therapy group. Conclusions. This PGA felt and fi rin <b>glue</b> <b>sealing</b> method might become a promising post-ESD bleeding prevention method in patients taking antithrombotic agents (UMIN 000013990, UMIN 000013993). 長崎大学学位論文 学位記番号:博(医歯薬) 甲第 869 号 学位授与年月日:平成 28 年 6 月 1 日Author: Hiroko Fukuda, Naoyuki Yamaguchi, Hajime Isomoto, Kayoko Matsushima, Hitomi Minami, Yuko Akazawa, Ken Ohnita, Fuminao Takeshima, Saburo Shikuwa, and Kazuhiko NakaoCitation: Gastroenterology Research and Practice, 2016, 1457357; 201...|$|R

After excision, processing, and staining, light microscopic analysis was performed on the sections, using subjective histological description and histomorphometry. Capsule quality, capsule thickness, interstitial quality, and total score were evaluated. To compare the samples with glue and without glue, analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests were carried out. No complications were observed. In general, the glue remnants remained visible at 3 and 6 weeks of implantation, accompanied by an inflammatory reaction and macrophage activity. At 12 weeks, all samples showed good tissue integration without evidence of glue.

30|$|Potentiometric {{transducers}} {{based on}} pH-sensitive field-effect transistors were produced at the JSC “Kwazar” facilities (Kiev, Ukraine). Each transducer contained a differential pair of two identical p-channel field-effect transistors {{placed on a}} single crystal with the total area of 8  mm[*]×[*] 8  mm. N-type (100) silicon wafer {{was used as a}} substrate. The gate of dielectric layer was formed from thermally oxidized SiO 2 film 50  nm thick and Si 3 N 4 film of the same thickness deposited in the low-pressure reactor. The gate area had zigzag-shaped geometry with the length to width ratio of 100, which provided sufficient gain factor of p-channel transistors. The p-type conducting busses covered with a dielectric layer were used to form the electric contact to the transistor drain and source areas. The crystal with FETs was mounted on the specifically designed printed-circuit boards (5  cm[*]×[*] 0.8  cm) for convenient connection. There were two pH-FETs on each chip, which allows measurements in differential mode to avoid an influence of the non-specific changes in output signal associated with the fluctuations in temperature, environmental pH, and electrical noise. The contact from the chip to the board copper layer was made by ultrasonic welding with an epoxy <b>glue</b> <b>sealing.</b> The signals from both transistors were recorded, and then, the signal from the reference transistor (covered with the “blank” membrane) was subtracted from the signal of the transistor covered with the enzymatic membrane (biorecognition element). The transistors demonstrated pH-sensitivity of approximately 40  mV/pH and transconductance of 400 – 500  μA/V, thus providing pH-sensitivity of the transistor channel current of 15 – 20  μA/pH.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Advanced {{industrial}} robots {{are composed of}} several indepen-dent control systems. Particularly, robots that perform process-intensive tasks such as painting, <b>gluing,</b> and <b>sealing</b> have dedicated process control systems that {{are more or less}} loosely coupled with the motion control system. Validating software for such robotic systems is challenging. A major {{reason for this is that}} testing the software for such systems re-quires access to physical systems to test many of their characteristics. In this paper, we present a method, developed at ABB Robotics in collab-oration with SIMULA, for automated testing of such process control sys-tems. Our approach draws on previous work from continuous integration and the use of well-established constraint-based testing and optimization techniques. We present a constraint-based model for automatically gen-erating test sequences where we both generate and execute the tests as part of a continuous integration process. We also present results from a pilot installation at ABB Robotic where ABB’s Integrated Process Con-trol system has been tested. The results show that the model is both able to discover completely new errors and to detect old reintroduced errors. From this experience, we report on lessons learned from implementing an automatic test generation and execution process for a distributed control system for {{industrial robots}}. ...|$|R

The problems of DBS implantation considered here include stereotactic planning, draping, creation and use of the burhole, physiological testing, anchoring of the electrode, financial considerations, and overall technique. Fourteen categories of operative nuances were identified and described in detail. These include the use of specific anatomical relationships for planning, the use of clear and watertight drapes, countersinking of the burhole, the use of gelfoam and tissue <b>glue</b> to <b>seal</b> the burhole, methods to review the entire microelectrode data simultaneously, blinded communication with the patient during macrostimulation, fluoroscopic marking, MRI compatible protection of the electrode tip, financial considerations effecting choice of operative materials, and restriction to a single operator.

50|$|Industrial {{applications}} of membranes require hundreds {{to thousands of}} square meters of membranes and therefore {{an efficient way to}} reduce the footprint by packing them is required. Membranes first became commercially viable when low cost methods of housing in ‘modules’ were achieved. Membranes are not self-supporting. They need to be stayed by a porous support that can withstand the pressures required to operate the NF membrane without hindering the performance of the membrane. To do this effectively, the module needs to provide a channel to remove the membrane permeation and provide appropriate flow condition that reduces the phenomena of concentration polarisation. A good design minimises pressure losses on both the feed side and permeate side and thus energy requirements. Leakage of the feed into the permeate stream must also be prevented. This can be done through either the use of permanent <b>seals</b> such as <b>glue</b> or replaceable <b>seals</b> such as O-rings.|$|R

5000|$|Adhesions form as {{a natural}} part of the body’s healing process after surgery in a similar way that a scar forms. The term [...] "adhesion" [...] is applied when the scar extends from within one tissue across to another, usually across a virtual space such as the peritoneal cavity. Adhesion {{formation}} post-surgery typically occurs when two injured surfaces are close to one another. This often causes inflammation and causes fibrin deposits onto the damaged tissues. The fibrin then connects the two adjacent structures where damage of the tissues occurred. The fibrin acts like a <b>glue</b> to <b>seal</b> the injury and builds the fledgling adhesion, said at this point to be [...] "fibrinous." [...] In body cavities such as the peritoneal, pericardial and synovial cavities, a family of fibrinolytic enzymes may act to limit the extent of the initial fibrinous adhesion, and may even dissolve it. In many cases however the production or activity of these enzymes are compromised because of injury, and the fibrinous adhesion persists. If this is allowed to happen, tissue repair cells such as macrophages, fibroblasts and blood vessel cells, penetrate into the fibrinous adhesion, and lay down collagen and other matrix substances to form a permanent fibrous adhesion. In 2002, Giuseppe Martucciello's research group showed a possible role could be played by microscopic foreign bodies (FB) accidentally contaminating the operative field during surgery. These data suggested that two different stimuli are necessary for adhesion formation: a direct lesion of the mesothelial layers and a solid substrate (FB).|$|R

At either 3 or 7 days follow-up, anastomotic bursting pressure was measured and tissue was obtained for histology and collagen content assessment after which animals were sacrificed. Three rats in the control (15 %), three in the fibrin glue (15 %), and one in the collagen group (4. 8 %) died due to anastomotic complications (P = 0. 497). Anastomotic bursting pressures were not significantly different between groups at 3 and 7 days follow-up (P = 0. 659 and P = 0. 427, respectively).

40|$|Background: Anastomotic leakage {{remains a}} major {{complication}} following colorectal surgery, with a largely unknown pathophysiology and limited treatment options. Previous clinical studies {{have revealed that}} many leakages on colo-rectal anastomoses remain subclinical. Prior attempts at prophylactic mechanical sealing of gastrointestinal anastomoses, i. e., the application of various forms of mesh and fibrin components, have been disappointing. We therefore decided {{to determine whether a}} collagen patch coated with fibrin glue components (TachoSil and reg;) is able to seal leaking colonic anastomoses and thereby prevent clinical leakage and peritonitis. Material and methods: Prospective study on 20 pigs operated with experimentally induced defects in colonic anastomoses randomized to sealing vs. no sealing with a collagen patch coated with fibrin glue components. The primary study endpoints were visible leakage at the anastomotic site, death or illness causing sacrifice and fecal peritonitis (local or diffuse). Results: A significant reduction in macroscopic anastomotic leakage in the group of pigs with sealed anastomoses was found (2 / 10 vs. 9 / 10, p= 0. 0055). Furthermore, macroscopic examination of the abdominal cavity (n= 20) showed a significant decrease in peritonitis in the sealed vs. non-sealed groups (2 vs. 9, p= 0. 0055). Additionally, a reduction, although non-significant, in dead and sacrificed animals {{before the end of the}} observation period (1 vs. 4) was found in the sealed group.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Iatrogenic preterm prelabour rupture {{of fetal}} {{membranes}} (iPPROM) remains the main complication after invasive interventions into the intrauterine cavity. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the sealing capability and tissue interaction of mussel-mimetic tissue adhesive (mussel glue) in comparison to fibrin glue on punctured fetal membranes in vivo. STUDY DESIGN: A mid-gestational rabbit model was used for testing the materials. The fetal sacs of pregnant rabbits at day 23 were randomly assigned into experimental groups: unoperated (negative control), unclosed puncture (positive control), commercially available fibrin glue (FG) with decellularized amnion scaffold (DAM), mussel glue (MG) with DAM, or mussel glue alone. Evaluation was done at term (30 days' gestation) assessing fetal survival, fetal membrane integrity and histology of the membranes. RESULTS: Fetal survival was not significantly lower in any of the treatment groups compared to the negative control. All plugging materials could be found at the end of the pregnancy and no adverse effects on the fetus or the pregnant does could be observed. Sac integrity was higher in all treatment groups compared to the positive control group but significant only in the FG+DAM group. Cellular infiltration could be seen in fibrin glue and DAM in contrast to mussel glue which was only tightly adhering to the surrounding tissue. These cells were mostly of mesenchymal phenotype staining positive for vimentin. CD 68 positive macrophages were found clustered around all the plugging materials, but their numbers were only significantly increased for the mussel glue alone group compared to negative controls. CONCLUSIONS: Mussel <b>glues</b> performance in <b>sealing</b> fetal membranes in the rabbit model was comparable to that of fibrin glue.

This means {{the loss of}} the three main laryngeal functions: phonation; respiration; and the prevention of aspiration during deglutition. Laryngectomy patients have various options to restore phonation such as an esophageal voice, an electrolaryngeal voice or a tracheo-esophageal voice with a shunt valve. In the latter case a silicone rubber shunt valve is placed in the tracheo-esophageal wall and phonation is generated when exhaled air is forced through the shunt valve to the esophagus and neopharynx. The EUREKA project “Newvoice” aims at improving the plight of laryngectomees by realizing several subprojects. The outcome of the project should be a market ready, voiceproducing shunt prosthesis, and new biofilm-resistant silicone rubber and soft tissue interfaces like tissue connectors, which enable hands-free control of an improved “new voice” and prevention of trachea irritation. The latter is the main subject of this thesis. Difficulties in the fixation of prostheses for voice rehabilitation after laryngectomy In Chapter 2 we reviewed the literature on fixation problems with shunt valves, tracheostoma valves and heat and moisture exchange (HME) filters. Despite 22 years of experience (at the time of publication) with the implantation of tracheoesophageal shunt valves and many improvements in the materials used and the design, problems still remain such as biofilm formation with subsequent leakage through the valve, the need for frequent and inconvenient replacements, fistula enlargement leading to leakage around the device and reduced fixation, and infections. The high financial cost of shunt valves is a drawback to their use worldwide. To enable hands-free speech, different types of tracheostoma valve (TSV) have been developed. These valves are fixed to the skin or to the tracheostoma by means of an intratracheal device. An HME filter is used to protect the airway and maintain physiological balance. Such devices are only suitable for a select group of patients as fixation to the skin or trachea can be a major problem. Speaking and coughing cause pressure increases, which often result in mucous leakage and disconnection of the valve and/or HME filter. As fixation of TSVs and HME filters is difficult, only a minority of patients uses the devices and benefit from hands-free speech. Animal models for tracheal research Preliminary research concerning tracheal reconstruction and fixation possibilities to the trachea and esophagus was necessary before prototypes were tested invivo. Tracheal research contains two main areas of interest: tracheal reconstruction and tracheal fixation. Tracheal reconstructions are aimed at rearranging or replacing parts of the tracheal tissue using implantation and transplantation techniques. The indications for tracheal reconstruction are numerous: obstructing tracheal tumors, trauma, post-intubation tissue reactions, etc. Although in past years much progress has been made, none of the new developed techniques have resulted in a large-scale clinical application for (near complete) trachea replacement. Tissue engineering {{is believed to be the}} technique that will provide a solution for reconstruction of tracheal defects. However, developing functional tracheal tissue from different cultured cell types is still a challenge. Tracheal fixation research is relatively new in the field and concentrates on solving fixation-related problems for laryngectomized patients. It was found that the animal models used for tracheal research vary widely and in most publications proper scientific arguments for animal selection are never mentioned. It showed that the choice of animal models is a multifactorial process in which non-scientific arguments tend to play a key role. In this chapter (3) the results of post-mortem investigations and information for biomaterials scientists about tracheal research and the animal models used were listed. Consequently, after design and production of tissue connector prototypes, animal experiments were designed. Goats were thought to be the best animal models for these purposes. The tracheostoma tissue connector (TS-TC) and tracheo-esophageal tissue connector (TE-TC) were reported separately. In vivo experiments with tracheostoma tissue connector prototypes In a goat model a tracheostoma was created and the prototypes were implanted. After 6 weeks of subcutaneous implantation, percutaneous screws were inserted. After twelve weeks, the experiment was terminated and the implants with the surrounding tissues were processed and examined histologically by means of light microscopy. The clinical appearance during weeks 7 to 12 varied from very poor to relatively good. Histologically, the implants showed a uniform inflammatory response. Titanium or silicone rubber rings surrounding the tracheostoma subcutaneously combined with polypropylene mesh failed to immobilize the skin and subcutaneous tissue sufficiently. As a consequence, the classical mechanism of percutaneous implant failure was demonstrated. Chapter 4 describes two prototypes and the subsequent histological analysis of the device-tissue explants. Experimental results of the tracheo-esophageal tissue connector for improved fixation of shunt valves in laryngectomized patients To solve the fixation related problems of the TE shunt valve, a TE-TC was devised to serve as an interface between the patient’s tissue (trachea and esophagus) and a shunt valve. The TE-TC was defined as a permucosal connection constructed from a titanium ring (filled with a silicon rubber plug) combined with polypropylene or titanium mesh. After implantation in adult goats for 12 weeks the implants were submitted to histological investigation. Firm implant fixation was achieved. In nearly all animals (18 / 19), no signs of infection of the implant was seen. In total 11 / 19 animals died before the end of the experiment due to complications not related to the implant. In a pilot experiment (n= 2) it was found that implantation of a TETC including punction of the dorsal tracheal wall was technically feasible and postoperatively safe for the animals. The TE-TC was considered a device with potential in the solution for fixation-related problems in tracheo-esophageal shunt valve voice rehabilitation. Histological assessment of titanium and polypropylene fiber mesh with and without fibrin tissue glue Both TS-TC and the TE-TC were stabilized by tissue ingrowth in mesh. Polypropylene (PP) and titanium (Ti) mesh are well-known surgical implants that provoke a relative low foreign body reaction. Firm stabilization of the implant is important to prevent migration and subsequent failure of the operation. Fibrin tissue glues are commercially available adhesives and are widely accepted in the medical field for hemorrhage, surgical bleeding, support of wound healing, wound and tissue <b>gluing,</b> <b>sealing</b> and closure but also as anti-adhesive agent in certain applications. Objective of this study was to evaluate the additional histological effect of fibrin glue application combined with two different types of mesh. Six pieces mesh of each (Ti, Ti with glue, PP and PP with glue), were subcutaneously implanted for 3, 6 and 12 weeks. After excision, processing and staining, light microscopic analysis was performed on the coupes using subjective histological description and histomorphometry. Capsule quality, capsule thickness, interstitial quality and total score were calculated. The samples with glue and without glue were compared by means of analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests. No complications were observed. In general the glue remnants remained visible at 3 and 6 weeks of implantation, accompanied by an inflammatory reaction and macrophage activity. In general the Ti group scored higher than the PP group, which is in line with the literature. At 12 weeks all samples showed good tissue integration without evidence of glue. The samples with glue clearly demonstrated a prolonged inflammatory response and were surrounded by fibrous tissue capsules that were significantly thicker compared to the samples without glue (P< 0. 05). It was demonstrated that the addition of fibrin tissue glue to the mesh implants induced a prolonged inflammatory response and thicker fibrous capsules after implantation. The Saanen goat as animal model for post-laryngectomy research: practical implications In our implantation experiments several problems and complications of the selected Saane goat model were encountered. The postoperative course of this animal model was described in detail. Surgery consisted of a laryngo-tracheal separation and implantation of a tracheoesophageal and tracheostoma tissue connector with fibrin tissue glue. Postoperative care consisted of frequent stoma care. All animals survived the surgical procedure. However, postoperative care was extensive, labor-intensive and accompanied by several complications (11 (58 %) animals died before the end of the experiment). Establishment of the percutaneous connection after 6 weeks was found to be a critical point from where the tracheostoma tissue connector starts to cause infection. In one animal, the TE-TC got infected due to a seroma that had formed subcutaneously, inferior of the tracheostoma. It was concluded that this goat model has certain disadvantages and can only be used for shortterm experiments with intensive care. Further refinements of the model were considered a necessity before new experiments are carried out. Conclusions Prosthetic tracheo-esophageal voice rehabilitation can be regarded as a successful approach to regain speech after surgical removal of the larynx. Fixation-related and other problems, however, require frequent visits of patients to the ENT outpatient clinic. HME filters used in TE speech can stay attached relative successfully because fixation is supported by a finger used to close the tracheostoma. The use of automatic TSVs is only possible in selected cases. Therefore the TS-TC prototype has been proposed as an improvement of this. However, it has not proven to be a successful strategy in our animal model. Alternative research efforts are required to realize an improved fixation of these devices. Fixation of TE shunt valves is in many cases not sufficient and leads to serious problems for patients. The TE-TC proved to be successful for implantation in the tracheo-esophageal wall. Isolated experiments with TE-TCs that include perforation of the esophageal wall are necessary before a patient-ready and market-ready product can be achieved. The animal model is not ideal because the tracheostomy implies an unpredictable course concerning airway and respiratory safety and, tissues of the implantation area are very mobile. For selected purposes this model is appropriate for short time experiments. The application of mesh for fixation of implants is favorable because firm integration in tissue has been demonstrated. Following the progress of the Newvoice project, concerning the development of TE and tracheostoma tissue connectors, the results show that additional research efforts are needed. Depending on the results of the next experiments, clinical application of the tissue connectors could be possible in the future. ...|$|R
