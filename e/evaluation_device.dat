50|$|Farmers' {{markets are}} markets in which {{producers}} sell directly to consumers. While farmers' markets {{do not have}} a measurable impact on the United States economy as a whole, many studies have found that farmers' markets impact state and municipal economies as well as vendors, local businesses, and consumers. These impacts are measured using the IMPLAN Input-Output Model and the Sticky Economic <b>Evaluation</b> <b>Device</b> (SEED), in addition to other methods. The economic impacts that are most frequently measured include effects on the revenue and income of local growers and local businesses, the effects on job creation, and the effects on other sectors of state and local economies. Some obstacles that may reduce impact or create negative economic effects include over-saturation, socioeconomic barriers, the opportunity cost of farmers' markets, and the projected unsustainable growth of farmers' markets in the United States.|$|E
5000|$|Market Umbrella is {{a nonprofit}} {{organization}} that developed the Sticky Economic <b>Evaluation</b> <b>Device</b> (SEED), a tool that measures the economic impact of a public market on neighboring businesses. SEED multiplies the annual revenue generated by consumers of the market and abutting businesses by the multiplier. Specifically, the Regional Input-Output Modeling System II multiplier is used, which is generated by the BEA (BEA). The RIMS II multiplier measures how many dollars remain in the regional or local economy. [...] "The greater the interaction each dollar has with the local economy, the larger the multiplier." [...] This methodology also gathers information through customer-intercept surveys and head count tabulation in order to calculate the economic impact the market has on its region. Market Umbrella provides markets with access to their survey templates and facilitates report generating through the use of online accounts on their website. The sales tax revenue generated by market consumers, including purchases at neighboring businesses, is additionally captured. The SEED methodology, developed with farmers' markets in mind, has been used to measure the economic impact of Crescent City Farmers' Markets.|$|E
