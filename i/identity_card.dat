40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Within the growing field of surveillance studies, national <b>identity</b> <b>cards</b> and related issues have become an important research topic. Most research in this field, however, does not consider the role of media {{in the development of}} surveillance. This research examines the history of mediated public debates about <b>identity</b> <b>cards</b> in the U. K. In the U. K, since the <b>Identity</b> <b>Cards</b> Bill 2004, National <b>Identity</b> <b>cards</b> have been widely debated across the British national newspapers once again after several heated historical debates in WWI, WWII, and the 1990 s. It is this thesis s purpose to analyze the role of the British national newspapers in generating support and resistance in the development of British national <b>identity</b> <b>cards</b> in the past one hundred years, respectively in 1915, 1919, 1939, 1951, and from 1994 to 2008. This thesis also seeks to find out the continuities and changes in the way British national newspapers influence the repeated introduction and withdrawal of <b>identity</b> <b>cards</b> over time. Specifically, by employing the methods of content and frame analysis, the thesis examines the actors involved in the mediated debate of British national <b>identity</b> <b>cards,</b> their argumentation, the frames underlying the argumentation and the themes appeared in the debates, in order to find out to what extent the British print media supported or opposed the <b>identity</b> <b>cards</b> over time...|$|R

5|$|Attempts {{were made}} to {{photograph}} the corpse for the naval <b>identity</b> <b>card</b> Martin would have to carry, but the results were unsatisfactory, and {{it was obvious that}} the images were of a cadaver. Montagu and Cholmondeley conducted a search for people who resembled the corpse, finding Captain Ronnie Reed of MI5; Reed agreed to be photographed for the <b>identity</b> <b>card,</b> wearing Royal Marine uniform. As the three cards and passes needed looked too new for a long-serving officer, they were issued as recent replacements for lost originals. Montagu spent the next few weeks rubbing all three cards on his trousers to provide a used sheen to them. To provide a used look to the uniform, it was worn by Cholmondeley, who was about the same build. The only non-issue part to the uniform was the underwear, which was in short supply in war-rationed Britain, so a pair of good-quality woollen underwear, owned by the late Herbert Fisher, the Warden of New College, Oxford, was used.|$|E
