40|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{applying}} laws or principles originated from thermal systems to granular athermal systems, {{we may need to}} properly define the critical temperature concept in <b>granular</b> <b>powders.</b> The conventional environmental temperature in thermal systems is too weak to drive movements of particles in <b>granular</b> <b>powders</b> and cannot function as a thermal energy indicator. For maintaining the same functionality as in thermal systems, the temperature in <b>granular</b> <b>powders</b> is defined analogously and uniformly in this article. The newly defined granular temperature is utilized to describe and explain {{one of the most important}} phenomena observed in <b>granular</b> <b>powders,</b> the jamming transition, by introducing jamming temperature and jamming volume fraction concepts. The predictions from the equations of the jamming volume fractions for several cases like <b>granular</b> <b>powders</b> under shear or vibration are in line with experimental observations and empirical solutions in powder handlings. The goal of this article is to establish similar concepts in <b>granular</b> <b>powders,</b> allowing <b>granular</b> <b>powders</b> to be described with common laws or principles we are familiar with in thermal systems. Our intention is to build a bridge between thermal systems and <b>granular</b> <b>powders</b> to account for many similarities already found between these two systems.

40|$|The {{viscosity}} {{concept of}} thermal systems is borrowed {{to describe the}} flowability of <b>granular</b> <b>powders</b> in this article with the granular temperature is defined analogously. Eyrings rate process theory and free volume concept, which have been proved to be very powerful in dealing with many thermally activated phenomena {{in a wide variety}} of fields, are utilized to derive viscosity equations of <b>granular</b> <b>powders</b> under a simple shear. The obtained viscosity equations are examined only with empirical experimental observations in describing powder flowability, due to the lack of instruments and methodology for directly determining the viscosity of granular materials. The continuous shear thickening rather than the discontinuous shear thickening are predicted and found to be dependent on shear rate, the cohesive energy between particles, and the particle volume fraction, though the discontinuous shear thickening may still occur if certain conditions are met during shear, such as local particle volume fractions approach to the jamming point created by the shear induced inhomogeneity. A fundamental mechanism on how dry <b>granular</b> <b>powders</b> flow is proposed on the basis of what are demonstrated from the viscosity equations. The work presented in this article may lay a foundation to scale powder flowability in a more fundamental and consistent manner, at least providing an approach to consistently define the viscosity of <b>granular</b> <b>powders.</b> Since the same approaches are employed to derive the viscosity equations of <b>granular</b> <b>powders</b> as used to derive viscosity equations of liquids, colloidal suspensions, and polymeric materials, both athermal and thermal systems are thus unified with a single methodology.

The powders produced a rapid and marked fibrosis of equal severity. It is concluded that aluminium rather than any additive in the powders is the fibrogenic agent. The protective action of stearine demonstrated in vitro was not confirmed in vivo, suggesting that pulmonary fibrosis may also occur in men handling stearine-containing powders.

The friction of the system and the buoyancy of the immersed metallic spheres were predetermined. The drag on the sphere was then the only unknown. It was found that the drag is a function of three dimensionless groups, namely Reynolds number, Froude number and the ratio of the diameter of the metallic spheres to the mean diameter of the glass beads or powders forming the fluidized beds. For spheres above a certain diameter deviation occurred in the measurement of the drag owing to wall effect...|$|R

(Antibiotics-resistant lactic acid bacteria),and Biolactis? powder (Lactobacillus casei) before and after applying the pressure-heat sealing used in making discrete preparations of these products. The numbers of live lactic bacteria in all preparations were significantly reduced by pressure-heat sealing with a drop to 1 / 4 of that stated in the package insert for Lac-B? <b>granular</b> <b>powder.</b> In the case of Lebenin? and Biolactis? powder,the bacteria numbers dropped to 1 / 10 and 1 / 70 of those stated,respectively. It is thus unlikely {{that the number of}} live bacteria stated in the package inserts would be achieved for these products and one could not expect the clinical effects of the bacteria to be fully manifested when discrete preparations of the latter two products were orally administered. In order to clarify whether the numbers of live lactic acid bacteria were reduced by heat-treatment during the sealing of the package,all products were maintained at 115 °C for 5 seconds in a thermostat. The results were almost identical to those obtained for pressure-heat sealing,suggesting that the decreases in numbers of the live bacteria in discrete preparations was mainly due to the heat-treatment involved in pressure-heat sealing. In conclusion,we propose that when making discrete preparations of lactic acid bacteria products,in particular Lebenin? and Biolactis? powder,no heating should be used in the sealing process. 一般論文Regular Article...|$|E

40|$|We {{report on}} {{laboratory}} experiments designed {{to investigate the}} microphysical processes that result in rate- and state-dependent friction behavior. We study the effect of relative humidity (RH) (< 5 to 100 %) in velocity stepping tests (10 – 20 mm/s) and slidehold-slide (SHS) tests (3 – 1000 s) on 3 mm thick layers of quartz and alumina powders sheared at 25 MPa normal stresses. <b>Granular</b> <b>powders</b> are conditioned in situ under controlled RH to create new surface area before shearing. We find a transition from velocity strengthening to velocity-weakening frictional behavior as RH increases. The transition occurs at 30 – 35 % RH for quartz and 55 – 60 % RH for alumina. Frictional healing is negligible at low humidity and increases with increasing RH for both materials. The coefficient of sliding friction is independent of humidity. We use normal stress vibrations in SHS tests to isolate chemically assisted healing mechanisms operative within contact junctions from compaction induced granular strengthening. We find that reorganization of granular particles influences friction but that chemically assisted mechanisms dominate. Our data show that rate- and state-dependent friction behavior for granular materials, including time-dependent healing and steady state velocity dependence, {{is the result of}} chemically assisted mechanisms that can be reduced or turned off at low humidity at room temperature in quartz and alumina.
