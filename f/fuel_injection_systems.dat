Based on the experiment and parameter those have been experimented, the engine performance on the conventional system is lower at the high engine rotation than electronic <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>system,</b> and when the engine rotation is low, the engine performance of the conventional system is higher than electronic <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>system,</b> and the specific fuel consumption on the conventional engine system at high engine rotation is more wastefully than electronic <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>system,</b> but at low engine rotation, the conventional engine system is more economical than electronic <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R
2500|$|In {{the last}} years of World War II, {{aircraft}} engines that exceeded a specific horsepower of greater than 1.0, were equipped first with distributed fuel injection and later with direct injection, which became the fuel system of choice. Using the same principles as the pressure carburetor to measure air flow into the engine, the distributed fuel injection system used individual fuel lines to each cylinder, injecting the fuel at the intake port. [...] The direct-injection systems differed only in that it injected the fuel directly into the cylinder head, much like a diesel engine fuel system. These fuel control devices were individually sized and calibrated to fit almost all piston aircraft engines used by both civil and allied military aircraft made in the post war era. These <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>systems</b> are found on high performance general aviation piston engines that continue flying into the 21st century.|$|E
2500|$|The {{relationship}} between {{the rotation of the}} camshaft and the rotation of the crankshaft is of critical importance. Since the valves control the flow of the air/fuel mixture intake and exhaust gases, they must be opened and closed at the appropriate time during the stroke of the piston. For this reason, the camshaft is connected to the crankshaft either directly, via a gear mechanism, or indirectly via a belt or chain called a timing belt or timing chain. [...] Direct drive using gears is unusual because of the cost. The frequently reversing torque caused by the slope of the cams tends to cause gear rattle which for an all-metal gear train requires further expense of a cam damper. Rolls-Royce V8 (1954) used gear drive as, unlike chain, it could be made silent and to last the life of the engine. Where gears are used in cheaper cars, they tend to be made from resilient fibre rather than metal, except in racing engines that have a high maintenance routine. Fibre gears have a short life span and must be replaced regularly, much like a timing belt. In some designs the camshaft also drives the distributor and the oil and fuel pumps. [...] Some vehicles may have the power steering pump driven by the camshaft. [...] With some early <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>systems,</b> cams on the camshaft would operate the fuel injectors. Honda redesigned the VF750 motorcycle from chain drive to the gear drive VFR750 due to insurmountable problems with the VF750 Hi-Vo inverted chain drive.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} work, a {{theoretical}} and computational investigation is {{conducted to examine}} {{the performance of a}} <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>system</b> fitted with a constant pressure valve, used to power a high speed direct injection (DI) diesel engine. The delivery valve (conventional layout) in the <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>system</b> of diesel engines is used to provide a residual pressure in the fuel pipeline for the next injection. However, this layout often results in secondary injections which have a serious effect on engine performance. This problem is more severe in the cases of maintaining high residual pressure values. The use of a secondary valve placed inside the delivery valve, called the constant pressure valve, eliminates this problem by relieving the fuel pipe from the high pressure fluctuations caused by the pressure waves reflected at the injector end and the delivery valve chamber. A relevant experimental investigation is conducted with such a <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>system</b> on a high speed direct injection diesel engine, examining the effect of load and speed on the performance of the <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>system.</b> The experimental results compare well with the theoretical results obtained from a comprehensive simulation model developed by the present authors. Also, results are presented using the simulation model for the same <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>system</b> without being fitted with the constant pressure valve, revealing the occurrence of secondary injections at a high engine speed. The simulation model offers very useful information concerning the design of such a <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>system</b> and may be used during the development procedure providing economy in time and {{a better understanding of the}} entire injection process...|$|R
