5|$|Jiskra swore an oath {{of loyalty}} to Emperor Frederick on 10 March 1461. Pope Pius II offered to mediate a peace treaty between the Emperor and Matthias. George of Poděbrady also offered his assistance. The representatives of the Emperor and Matthias signed a truce in Olomouc in April 1460. The Pope soon offered {{financial}} support for an anti-Ottoman campaign. However, John Jiskra returned from Poland, renewing the armed conflicts with Czech mercenaries in early 1460. Matthias seized a newly erected fort from the Czechs {{but he could not}} force them to obey him. The costs of his five-month-long campaign in Upper Hungary were paid for by an <b>extraordinary</b> <b>tax.</b> Matthias entered into an alliance with the Emperor's rebellious brother Albert VI, Archduke of Austria. George of Poděbrady sided with the Emperor, although the marriage of his daughterwho became known as Catherine in Hungaryto Matthias was celebrated on 1 May 1461. Relations between Matthias and his father-in-law deteriorated because of the Czech mercenaries' continued presence in Upper Hungary. Matthias launched a new campaign against them after the Diet authorized him to collect an <b>extraordinary</b> <b>tax</b> in mid-1461. However, he did not defeat Jiskra, who even captured Késmárk (now Kežmarok, Slovakia).|$|E
5|$|Having {{realised}} the Hungarian Estates' growing dissatisfaction, Matthias held a Diet in November. The Diet again authorized him to levy an <b>extraordinary</b> <b>tax,</b> stipulating {{that the}} sum of all taxes payable per porta could not exceed one florin. The Estates also {{made it clear that they}} opposed the war in Bohemia. George of Poděbrady died on 22 March 1471. The Diet of Bohemia proper elected Vladislaus Jagiello king on 27 May. The papal legate Lorenzo Roverella soon declared Vladislaus's election void and confirmed Matthias's position as King of Bohemia, but the Imperial Diet refused Matthias's claim.|$|E
5|$|Matthias {{expelled}} George of Poděbrady's {{troops from}} Silesia. Matthias's army was encircled and routed at Uherský Brod on 2 November, {{forcing him to}} withdraw to Hungary. Matthias soon ordered the collection of an <b>extraordinary</b> <b>tax</b> without holding a Diet, raising widespread discontent among the Hungarian Estates. He visited Emperor Frederick in Vienna on 11 February 1470, hoping the Emperor would contribute to {{the costs of the}} war against Poděbrady. Although the negotiations lasted for a month, no compromise was worked out. The Emperor also refused to commit himself to promoting Matthias's election as King of the Romans. After a month, Matthias left Vienna without taking formal leave of Frederick III.|$|E
5000|$|Tekalif-i örfiye: <b>Extraordinary</b> <b>taxes</b> (at least initially); their extemporised nature {{means that}} they were not always {{recorded}} in some tax registers.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the late}} 17th and early 18th century - {{a period of}} {{continuous}} warfare for the Ottoman Empire - these <b>extraordinary</b> <b>taxes</b> soon became routine.|$|R

5|$|The Diet of 1468 {{authorized}} Matthias to levy an <b>extraordinary</b> <b>tax</b> {{to finance}} the new war, but only after 8 prelates and 13 secular lords pledged on the King's behalf {{that he would not}} demand such charges in the future. Matthias also exercised royal prerogatives to increase his revenues. For instance, he ordered a Palatine's eyre in a county, the cost of which were to be covered by the local inhabitants but soon authorized the county to redeem the cancellation of this irksome duty.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for a war against the Ottomans, Matthias held a Diet at Tolna in March 1463. Although the Estates authorized him to levy a one-florin <b>extraordinary</b> <b>tax,</b> he did not intervene when Mehmed II invaded Bosnia in June. In a month, the Ottomans murdered King Stephen Tomašević and conquered the whole country. Matthias only adopted an offensive foreign policy after the terms of his peace with Emperor Frederick were ratified in Wiener Neustadt on 19 July 1463. He led his troops to Bosnia and conquered Jajce and other forts in its northern parts. The conquered regions were organized into a new defensive province, or banate. Assisted by Stefan Vukčić, Duke of Saint Sava, Matthias also conquered Bosanska Krajina and granted it to the Duke, who accepted his suzerainty.|$|E
25|$|When a {{campaign}} (profectio) {{of the king}} is announced to the bishop (of Metz, in this case) the bishop will send an official to the abbot, and the abbot will assemble his ministeriales. He will inform them of the campaign, and they will assemble the following men and equipment...: one wagon with six cows and six men; one packhorse with saddle and equipment and two men, the leader and the driver...If the king moves the army to Italy, all the peasant farms shall contribute for that purpose their usual taxes (that is, probably an entire annual rent as an <b>extraordinary</b> <b>tax).</b> But if the army moves against Saxony, Flanders or elsewhere {{on this side of}} the Alps, only half that amount will be given. From these additional taxes the wagons and pack animals will be loaded with rations and other items necessary for the journey.|$|E
50|$|After a muafname {{was issued}} to a town, the urban {{population}} would be exempted {{from some of}} the taxes on raya, such as resm-i çift. Taxation in the Ottoman Empire was complex, including various routine and <b>extraordinary</b> <b>taxes,</b> and different rates for social groups; a muafname might apply to {{one or more of these}} taxes.|$|R
5000|$|Tekalif-i orfiye was {{a blanket}} terms for several {{different}} ad hoc charges which were, initially, <b>extraordinary</b> <b>taxes</b> raised in war-time. They were variously paid in cash or in kind, and rates could vary (to an extent), {{depending on the}} community's ability to pay. By {{the time of the}} Tanzimat reforms, tekalif-i orfiye included ninety different excise taxes.|$|R
50|$|The tax was {{collected}} annually, on 1 March, from the holder of the timar or their tax-farmer. Some exemptions from resm-i çift were granted, {{but this was}} less common than exemptions from <b>extraordinary</b> <b>taxes.</b> Some of the sadat were initially considered exempt from taxes such as the resm-i çift, but this exemption ended in the 17th century; there were various exemptions for those involved in salt-making and mining.|$|R
500|$|Matthias's bride Beatrice of Naples {{arrived in}} Hungary in late 1476. Matthias married her in Buda on 22 December that year. The new Queen soon {{established}} a rigid etiquette, making direct contacts between the King and his subjects more difficult. According to Bonfini, Matthias also [...] "improved his board and manner of life, introduced sumptuous banquets, disdaining humility {{at home and}} beautified the dining rooms" [...] after his marriage. According to a contemporaneous record, around that time Matthias's revenues amounted about 500,000 florins, half of which derived from the tax of the royal treasury and the <b>extraordinary</b> <b>tax.</b>|$|E
500|$|Stephen Zápolya {{said the}} King's death {{relieved}} [...] "Hungary {{of the trouble}} and oppression from which it had suffered so far". Royal authority quickly diminished because various claimantsJohn Corvinus, Maximilian of the Romans, Vladislaus Jagiellon, and the latter's younger brother, John Albertwere fighting for the crown. Vladislaus Jagiellon triumphed because the barons regarded him as a weak ruler and he gained the support of Matthias's wealthy widow by promising to marry her. Vladislaus was elected king after he promised he would abolish all [...] "harmful innovations" [...] introduced by Matthias, especially the <b>extraordinary</b> <b>tax.</b> Vladislaus could not finance {{the maintenance of the}} Black Army and the unpaid mercenaries began plundering the countryside. A royal force led by Paul Kinizsi eliminated them on the river Száva in 1492.|$|E
500|$|The envoys of Matthias and Emperor Frederick agreed a {{peace treaty}} on 3 April 1462. According to the agreement, the Emperor was to return the Holy Crown of Hungary for 80,000 golden florins, but his right to use the title King of Hungary along with Matthias was confirmed. In {{accordance}} with the treaty, the Emperor adopted Matthias, which granted him the right to succeed his [...] "son" [...] if Matthias died without a legitimate heir. Within a month, Jiskra yielded to Matthias. He surrendered all the forts he held in Upper Hungary to the King's representatives; as compensation he received a large domain near the Tisza and 25,000 golden florins. To pay the large amounts stipulated in his treaties with the Emperor and Jiskra, Matthias collected an <b>extraordinary</b> <b>tax</b> {{with the consent of}} the Royal Council. The Diet, which assembled in mid-1462, confirmed this decision but only after 9 prelates and 19 barons promised that no extraordinary taxes would be introduced thereafter. Through hiring mercenaries among Jiskra's companions, Matthias began organizing a professional army, which became known as the [...] "Black Army" [...] in following decades.|$|E
25|$|Due to an Australian Taxation Office {{ruling in}} 2006, the club {{proposed}} a shareholder restructure {{that would have}} seen the B Class shareholders power reduced significantly and some voting rights returned to members. This was done to avoid <b>extraordinary</b> <b>taxes</b> being placed on the club, but the move was blocked in December by Bob Ansett and his proxies who feared that the restructure would make the club vulnerable to further takeover bids.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} counter the {{tendency}} to decentralisation, diminish {{the power of the}} nobility, and evade the control of the fueros on him, Theobald turned to the bourgeoisie. He exacted <b>extraordinary</b> <b>taxes</b> and imposts from them, but they supported him nevertheless because he granted them rights, prestige, and political clout. He extended the fueros of Pamplona to Lantz and Estella to Tiebas - nowadays in ruins and depopulated - and Torralba Del Río. He founded Espinal (Aurizberri, near Roncesvalles) in 1269.|$|R
5|$|At the Diet of March 1467, two {{traditional}} {{taxes were}} renamed; the chamber's profit was thereafter collected as tax {{of the royal}} treasury and the thirtieth as the Crown's customs. Because of this change, all previous tax exemptions became void, increasing state revenues. Matthias set about centralizing the administration of royal revenues. He entrusted {{the administration of the}} Crown's customs to John Ernuszt, a converted Jewish merchant. Within two years, Ernuszt was responsible for the collection of all ordinary and <b>extraordinary</b> <b>taxes,</b> and the management of the salt mines.|$|R
50|$|Poland's {{successive}} kings granted privileges to {{the nobility}} {{at the time}} of their election to the throne (the privileges being specified in the king-elect's Pacta conventa) and at other times in exchange for ad hoc permission to raise an <b>extraordinary</b> <b>tax</b> or a pospolite ruszenie.|$|E
50|$|His {{prestige}} also increased. Lesser noblemen began regarding {{him as an}} able protector. Rudolph I, King of Hungary, tasked {{him with}} {{the collection of the}} two-florin <b>extraordinary</b> <b>tax</b> payable by each peasant households in Gömör County in 1582, and in Borsod County in 1584. He was made the captain of Szendrő in 1585. By that time Sigismund, like most of his peers in Upper Hungary, had converted from Lutheranism to Calvinism.|$|E
50|$|Amcazade Huseyin {{started with}} {{economic}} and financial reforms. The excise duties on tobacco and coffee, which had quadrupled during the war to provide finance for military effort, were substantially reduced and so too the duties on essential consumer goods, for example soap and cooking oil. During the war special imposition taxes were created and {{those who could not}} pay these <b>extraordinary</b> <b>tax</b> impositions were heavily fined. Amcazade Huseyin abolished these <b>extraordinary</b> <b>tax</b> impositions and issued a tax amnesty on those who were not able to pay and who were required to pay heavy fines. The rates of traditional taxes were adjusted down so that they matched the ability to pay. Debased coins struck during the war were replaced by coins of full value. New cultivators, from nomadic Turcomans, were induced to settle in places like Urfa, Malatya, Antalya and Cyprus where the numbers of agricultural peasants had decreased to very low levels. Efforts were made to develop a new manufacturing base, in place of devastated Ottoman craft industries and replacing imports from Europe.|$|E
50|$|Yazid ibn Abi Muslim's {{tenure in}} Ifriqiya {{was not a}} happy one. Perhaps recalling the brutish {{administration}} of his mentor al-Hajjaj in Wasit (Iraq), Yazid ibn Abi Muslim showed little respect for non-Arab Muslims under his jurisdiction. His predecessor in Kairouan, Ismail ibn Abd Allah ibn Abu al-Muhajjar had put much effort into integrating Muslim Berbers into the Caliphal mainstream. Yazid immediately went about undoing all that, relegating Berber officers and increasing fiscal exactions upon the Berber populace. Side-stepping the legal prohibitions, Yazid re-imposed the jizyah (non-Muslim poll taxes) on Muslim Berbers and expanded other <b>extraordinary</b> <b>taxes</b> and tributes.|$|R
5|$|Matthias's {{ordinary}} revenues amounted around 250,000 golden florins {{per year}} when his reign began. A decree passed at the Diet of 1458 explicitly prohibited {{the imposition of}} <b>extraordinary</b> <b>taxes.</b> However, an <b>extraordinary</b> taxone golden florin per each porta or peasant householdwas levied late that year. The Ottomans occupied the fort of Golubac in Serbia in August 1458; Matthias ordered the mobilization of all noblemen. He made a raid into Ottoman territory and defeated the enemy forces in minor skirmishes. King Stephen Thomas of Bosnia accepted Matthias's suzerainty.

50|$|Charles Albert of Sardinia had united the Sardinian {{army and}} countless volunteers from Lombardy, Veneto {{and many other}} Italian regions, but the defeat of his force by Radetzky at Novara in 1849 led to a {{hardening}} in the Austrian government's attitude. In just one year, from August 1848 to August 1849, the Austrians carried out 961 hangings and executions, requisitioned many expatriates' goods and imposed heavy <b>taxes</b> and <b>extraordinary</b> <b>taxes</b> on the people. The repressive policy was directly carried out by field marshal Radetzky, governor general, but strongly supported from the imperial court in Vienna. In all, they allowed no ambiguity as to the occupying power's real intentions.|$|R
50|$|Vladislaus's brother, Sigismund, who {{had been}} crowned King of Poland, married John's sister, Barbara Zápolya in early 1512, which {{increased}} John's prestige. To show off his wealth, John went with Barbara to Poland accompanied by 800 horsemen who wore gilded cloths. John made a raid in Ottoman Bulgaria in summer 1513. After returning to Transylvania, he crushed a revolt in Hermanstadt (now Sibiu in Romania) and forced the townspeople to pay an <b>extraordinary</b> <b>tax.</b>|$|E

50|$|In 718, Ismail ibn Abd Allah was {{appointed}} by Caliph Omar II to replace his predecessor's appointee, the unpopular Muhammad ibn Yazid.

As such, Ismail encouraged conversions among the Berbers of North Africa and curbed the abuses of the Arab military caste. Ismail adhered to Islamic law and eliminated <b>extraordinary</b> <b>taxes</b> and slave-tributes on Berber populations. He is credited for completing the conversion of the Berber population to Islam.|$|R
50|$|The Diet of Hungary voted an <b>extraordinary</b> <b>tax</b> {{to finance}} the defense of Slavonia and Croatia against the Ottomans in early 1593.

After the Ottoman Grand Vizier, Koca Sinan Pasha, invaded Transdanubia, rumours about his plan to transform Upper Hungary into a voivodate (vassal state) were spreading. Sigismund urged the influential Nicholas Pálffy to persuade Rudolph I to launch a counter-invasion against the Ottomans without delay.

5000|$|The {{brothers}} {{knew that}} the collection of an <b>extraordinary</b> <b>tax</b> (which had been levied {{in the autumn of}} 1185) angered the population, especially in the region of Anchialos (now Pomorie in Bulgaria). However, initially they could not provoke the discontented people into rebellion, because their compatriots looked [...] "askance at the magnitude of the undertaking", according to Choniates.

25|$|Before the mid-14th {{century when}} the Polish monarchs granted {{privileges}} to Polish nobles, {{they did so}} on a provincial basis.

However, {{with the rise of}} the unified szlachta class, the way in which privileges were granted began to change. As a class, the szlachta first acquired country-wide privileges in the mid-14th century, with the first one being the Privilege of Buda, issued by Casimir the Great in 1355. Under the terms of this privilege, the king promised not to levy any <b>extraordinary</b> <b>taxes,</b> and to compensate the nobles for any losses they suffered on his behalf while fighting abroad.|$|R
