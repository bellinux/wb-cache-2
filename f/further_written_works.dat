The latter said, [...] "The idea of the song is 'We're not gonna leave you stranded' and that's what the chorus is. So me and Bono started going back and forth with ideas, and he was like, 'You know this word stranded keeps standing out to me' and I asked him to sing it, and he put me on hold 'cause he's recording the ideas on a Dictaphone — so he did it there and then on the phone."

500|$|Black {{later said}} that Roddenberry removed {{a large part}} of Johnson's work, and that Johnson's {{original}} work was better than Roddenberry's edited version. Johnson was pleased with the final episode, although he was concerned that viewers might not understand Star Trek after watching [...] "The Man Trap" [...] owing to differences in characterization between this episode {{and the rest of the}} series. He admitted that he did not like Spock and was concerned that the character would not be understood after this episode. Roddenberry was pleased with Johnson's work, and offered him <b>further</b> <b>writing</b> <b>work</b> on [...] "What Are Little Girls Made Of?", which had been written by Robert Bloch. Roddenberry only wanted Johnson to [...] "polish" [...] the script; Johnson, feeling he was unable to improve it without starting from scratch, turned down the offer, but expressed the desire to work on the show again. He later wrote a story outline titled [...] "Rock-A-Bye Baby, or Die!" [...] in which the Enterprise would have become a childlike sentient being who idolizes Kirk as its father. This was not commissioned, so [...] "The Man Trap" [...] was Johnson's only work on the franchise.|$|R

50|$|After Chen was conquered, Sui {{began to}} apply its laws over Chen's former territory—which brought resentment from the gentry, {{as they had}} been treated {{preferentially}} under Chen and its predecessor dynasties in the south. Su Wei <b>further</b> <b>wrote</b> a <b>work</b> known as the Five Teachings (五教, Wu Jiao) which is no longer extant but thought to be a work about loyalty to Sui and ordered that all former Chen subjects read and memorize it, leading to further resentment. When a rumor spread that Sui would move Chen subjects into the Guanzhong region in 590, nearly all of former Chen realm rose in rebellion, but in an unorganized manner. Emperor Wen sent Yang Su to quell the rebellions, and the rebels were no match for Yang Su; within the year, the rebellions were put down.|$|R

The second and third movements of [...] "Karn Evil 9" [...] were completed {{in the first half of}} that month, with the third impression being the first track to be recorded at Advision. The muse's sped-up and altered voice from the second movement and the 'computer' voice from the third movement were contributed by Emerson, and his only vocal credit in the trio's repertoire.

5000|$|<b>Further</b> <b>writing</b> on Rose's <b>work</b> by Carter Ratcliff {{appeared}} in the exhibition catalogue for the show at The Albany Institute of History & Art is titled [...] "Stephanie Rose: Upstage" [...] “because, in the theater of Rose’s art, everyone is always trying to upstage everyone else—or, rather, every image tries, tirelessly, to upstage every other. This is the twist, the amazing thing: they all succeed.” In addressing her painterly engagement with the historical past, Carter Ratcliff concluded: “For this is what true artists do: they immerse themselves in history, each reinventing a personal and therefore entirely relevant version of the past, and they live this past {{as if it were}} present… In these paintings of Rose’s…past and present are unified, but not on equal terms. The present wins out, and that is why these paintings are so vividly alive, now and for us, in the moment of coming face to face with them.” ...|$|R

Anonima's anti-commercial stance (see statement below), including their ultimate refusal {{to interact with the}} commercial artworld, had the effect of removing them from the lexicon of known artists from that time. In a catalog essay for Frank Hewitt's 1992 retrospective at the Robert Hull Fleming Museum in Burlington, Vermont, William C. Lipke wrote that the artists believed that [...] "commercialization and popularization obfuscated the real issues" [...] being addressed by their <b>work.</b> <b>Further</b> he <b>writes</b> that <b>work</b> by Anonima is [...] "better understood in light of the theories and data of perceptual psychology; the commitment to a systemic study of visual information irrespective of stylistic or economic pressures." ...|$|R
25|$|William Scott {{was born}} in Kent in the early 1570s. Scott {{produced}} the Model while a law student at the Inner Temple, probably completing {{much of the work}} during the summer vacation of 1599. Scott was related to the Henrician poet Sir Thomas Wyatt through his mother's side of the family: his uncle George Wyatt of Boxley (1553-1624), to whom Scott dedicated his Du Bartas translation, was Thomas' grandson (and the only surviving son of the rebel leader Sir Thomas Wyatt the Younger). Possibly as a result of dedicating the Model to Sir Henry Lee, Scott entered Lee's employment and served as MP for New Woodstock in 1601. In 1604 he travelled to Russia as part of Sir Thomas Smythe's embassy to the Russian Tsar Boris Gudunov. Little is known about the rest of Scott's career. He married Barbara Tomlyn in 1610 or 1611 and settled in Westenhanger, Kent He died in 1617.

40|$|Plan B Paper. 2015. Master of Science in Education- Montessori [...] University of Wisconsin-River Falls. Teacher Education Department. 55 leaves. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 48 - 49). In this high-tech age, handwriting {{in modern}} society is at a decline; {{this is true}} in education as well. The Common Core ignores the importance of handwriting; Montessori curriculum {{highlights the importance of}} writing skills. Handwriting has been shown to boost brainpower, aid in memory, improve motor skills as well as become a gateway to reading. This study was done to discover what classroom strategies support the development of handwriting in a mixed age class and to gain insight into what benefits result for the child in learning this skill. This action research project was conducted in a Montessori preschool in a Midwest city area. Twenty preschool participants ages 2 1 / 2 to 5 years old were studied and evaluated over an 8 -month period of time. The Montessori didactic materials, which have been used in Montessori classrooms for over a hundred years, were used to teach handwriting. In addition, writing was added to other subject areas to <b>further</b> encourage <b>writing</b> <b>work.</b> Observation, photographs, small-group presentations, student and parent interviews and handwriting samples were used to compile data. The results were positive. Students grew in handwriting ability and they chose handwriting works on their own. The Montessori materials proved effective; however they were even more effective when combined with a whole Montessori approach. This includes the preliminary works done in Practical Life and Sensorial to strengthen the hands and develop concentration and coordination. Parents also noticed a change in their children's handwriting and believed that Montessori materials were beneficial. As modern education moves away from handwriting instruction this study shows that handwriting is still essential and necessary for the whole education of the child and can be readily integrated into an early childhood curriculum...|$|R

50|$|How to Read Donald Duck has {{inspired}} a critical tradition in Latin America, {{dedicated to the}} study of the relationship between culture and dependency. The idea of the work that there was a rigid equation between the media of the United States and American imperialism has, however, been questioned and revised by later works. The work is considered a groundbreaking analysis of the ways the Donald Duck comics were depicted and circulated in Chile. It has influenced intellectuals in both Latin America and the world at large. Media analysts in Latin America have continued the study of the apparent connections between culture, identity, and social domination, building on the tradition of the work, among them Jésus Martín-Barbero and Carlos Monsiváis. A new generation of critics has <b>written</b> <b>further</b> <b>works</b> about the links between the identity of Latin America and media culture, among them Néstor García Canclini, Beatriz Sarlo, and Daniel Mato. According to McClennen, the domination of Latin America by cultural imports from the United States has continued into the 21st century.
