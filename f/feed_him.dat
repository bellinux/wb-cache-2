5|$|Unlike the Robinson Crusoe of the novel, who craved human contact, {{most of the}} Warsaw Crusoes {{tried to}} avoid it at all cost. This contradiction was noted by both the Robinsons and those who wrote about them after the war. Being {{discovered}} by the Germans in almost all cases meant immediate death. There were, however, some exceptions, the best known being that of Szpilman's encounter with Wilm Hosenfeld, a captain of the Wehrmacht who helped to hide and <b>feed</b> <b>him.</b> In a few instances those captured were first forced to help the Germans with the looting of the city's ruins, before being either executed or sent to the Pruszków camp.|$|E
5|$|At the old lady's house, Gary {{has been}} fed a lot. The old lady puts out fresh sheets of flyers {{given to her}} by Patrick. Upon reading them, Gary realizes that SpongeBob truly loves him and wants him back. He tries to leave, but instead of doing that, he ends up going to the closet, filled with empty snail shells. When the old lady tries to <b>feed</b> <b>him</b> again, Gary finds that the old lady most likely has {{sinister}} motives—she is possibly trying to fatten and then eat him. He makes his escape, but the old lady chases him out onto the streets. Gary quickly finds one of the gangster snails he saw before, which the old lady now mistakes for Miss Tuftsy, and takes him home instead. Back home, SpongeBob gives up on his search for Gary, and tries to forget about him by taking a walk, but his memories keep coming to mind and upsetting him. He is constantly reminded as the streets are filled with posters and signs for Gary. SpongeBob then hears a meow. At first he thinks he is imagining Gary is there, but then he turns around to find Gary is actually at his side, and he is overjoyed to see his beloved pet again.|$|E

25|$|Another {{example of}} Durvasa's benevolent {{side is the}} {{incident}} when he granted Duryodhana a boon. During the Pandavas' exile, Durvasa and several disciples arrived at Hastinapura. Duryodhana with his maternal uncle Shakuni managed to gratify the sage. Durvasa was pleased enough to grant him a boon. Duryodhana, secretly wanting Durvasa to curse the Pandavas in anger, asked the sage to visit his cousins in the forest after Draupadi had eaten her meal, knowing that the Pandavas would then have nothing to <b>feed</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{sensitive}} caregiver responds socially to {{attempts to}} initiate social interaction, playfully to {{his attempts to}} initiate play.

When he is distressed, she knows what kinds and degree of soothing he requires to comfort him – and she knows that sometimes a few words or a distraction will be all that is needed. On the other hand, the mother who responds inappropriately tries to socialize with the baby when he is hungry, play with him when he is tired, or <b>feed</b> <b>him</b> when he is trying to initiate social interaction.|$|E
25|$|Bo Yibo {{was born}} in Taiyuan, the capital of Shanxi, which {{had become one of}} the poorest provinces in China by the early 20th century.

After graduating from high school in Taiyuan he attended Beijing University. While studying in Beijing he joined the Chinese Communist Party, four years after it was founded, in 1925.|$|E
25|$|Cline's privately {{published}} work Hope for high risk and rage filled children also cites family therapist and hypnotherapist Milton Erickson as a source, and reprints {{parts of a}} case of Erickson's published in 1961. The report describes {{the case of a}} divorced mother with a non-compliant son. Erickson advised the mother to sit on the child {{for hours at a time}} and to <b>feed</b> <b>him</b> only on cold oatmeal while she and a daughter ate appetizing food. The child did increase in compliance, and Erickson noted, with apparent approval, that he trembled when his mother looked at him. Cline commented, with respect to this and other cases, that in his opinion all bonds were trauma bonds. According to Cline, it illustrates the three essential components of 1) taking control, 2) the child's expression of rage; and, 3) relaxation and the development of bonding.|$|E

25|$|On February 3, Bryant made seven three-pointers {{and scored}} a season-high 38 points, {{including}} 14 of the team's 18 {{points in the}} last 5:02 of the game, for a 119–115 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves. The win ended a 10-game losing streak, and the Lakers averted establishing the longest losing streak in franchise history. Bryant became just the fourth NBA player over 37 years old to log at least 35 points, five rebounds, and five assists in a game. Bryant was the leading overall vote-getter for the 2016 All-Star Game with 1.9 million votes, ahead of Stephen Curry's 1.6 million. Having moved to small forward that season, Bryant was selected as a frontcourt starter for the first time. Playing in his first All-Star game since 2013, Bryant had 10 points, six rebounds, and seven assists. West teammates offered to <b>feed</b> <b>him</b> the ball {{in an attempt to}} get him another All-Star MVP, but he declined.|$|E

500|$|Most 798ers were {{characterized}} by a Southern accent, cowboy boots, and unique welder's hats. They {{were the only people}} to weld the [...] pipe of the main pipeline, and outside observers characterized them as arrogant and [...] "redneck". As a fellow welder stated at the time, [...] "Take your typical 798 pipeline welder and <b>feed</b> <b>him</b> a few drinks, and he'll probably tell you that he's God's greatest gift to welding." [...] This attitude generated resentment from other pipeline workers, and the conflict caused large-scale brawls. In some instances, Alaska State Troopers had to be flown to pipeline camps in order to break up small riots. Toward the end of the pipeline project, a series of bumper stickers was produced with the slogan [...] "Happiness is 10,000 Okies going south with a Texan under each arm." ...|$|E

500|$|Kafka's {{laryngeal}} tuberculosis worsened and in March 1924 {{he returned}} from Berlin to Prague, where members of his family, principally his sister Ottla, took care of him. He went to Dr. Hoffmann's sanatorium in Kierling just outside Vienna for treatment on 10 April, and died there on 3 June 1924. The cause of death seemed to be starvation: the condition of Kafka's throat made eating too painful for him, and since parenteral nutrition {{had not yet been}} developed, {{there was no way to}} <b>feed</b> <b>him.</b> Kafka was editing [...] "A Hunger Artist" [...] on his deathbed, a story whose composition he had begun before his throat closed to the point that he could not take any nourishment. His body was brought back to Prague where he was buried on 11 June 1924, in the New Jewish Cemetery in Prague-Žižkov. Kafka was unknown during his own lifetime, but he did not consider fame important. He became famous soon after his death. The Kafka tombstone was designed by architect Leopold Ehrmann.|$|E

500|$|Barr {{was posted}} to North Africa on 28September 1941, to fly with No.3 Squadron {{under the command}} of Squadron Leader Peter Jeffrey. He {{converted}} to P-40D Tomahawk fighters at an RAF operational training unit in Khartoum. There he also received his [...] "goolie chit", a piece of paper to be shown to local tribesmen in the event he was shot down, reading in Arabic: [...] "don't kill the bearer, <b>feed</b> <b>him</b> and protect him, take him to the English and you will be rewarded. Peace be upon you." [...] Returning to North Africa, Barr achieved his first aerial victory, over a Messerschmitt Bf110, on 12December. He followed this up with a Junkers Ju88 and a Messerschmitt Bf109 the next day. The squadron then re-equipped with P-40E Kittyhawks; Barr was flying the new model when he became an ace on New Year's Day 1942, shooting down two Junkers Ju87 Stukas. On 8March, he led a flight of six Kittyhawks to intercept a raid on Tobruk by twelve Ju87s escorted by ten Macchi C.202s and two Bf109s. The Australians destroyed six Macchis and three Ju87s without loss, Barr personally accounting for one of the Macchis.|$|E

In one 1937 novelization, the Queen vows the Huntsman would pay dearly for {{allowing}} her stepdaughter to escape, but first she would deal with Snow White herself. In another version, the Huntsman would too be dragged to the dungeon when the Queen finds out that he has betrayed her, and the Queen might smash her own Mirror in anger. Later, after transforming herself, she decides to punish the Prince for having scorned her. She informs the Prince of her plan to have the Dwarfs bury Snow White alive and then leaves him to his death, still chained and trapped in a subterranean chamber filling with water to slowly drown. She then makes her way to the Dwarfs' cottage with the poisoned apple, while birds and forest animals were to help the Prince escape the Queen's minions and find his horse as would race to try and save Snow White.|$|E
500|$|The {{finished}} {{pilot was}} 28 minutes long, which {{was too long}} to air, as Parker and Stone {{did not realize that}} more time should be allowed for television commercials during the half-hour spot reserved for an episode on Comedy Central. In order to shorten the episode to 22 minutes, the creators cut out about ten minutes worth of material, and added back another three minutes, in order to tie up the changed storyline. For example, in the original pilot, Cartman farts fire because some older kids <b>feed</b> <b>him</b> hot tamales, while in the shortened version, he does so because of the alien probe implanted in him. Other scenes focused more heavily on the character Pip. The scene where he is introduced was later inserted into the fifth episode of the series, [...] "An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig", in its original, cutout animation form. The storyline additions were created with the use of computer animation, and all subsequent episodes of the series have been computer animated. While the creators' aim was for the computer animation to visually simulate the cardboard cutout animation, the techniques were not perfected until later in the series, and as a result, the two styles of animation are easily distinguishable in the pilot.|$|E
500|$|Brian Donlevy as Professor Bernard Quatermass: Donlevy reprised {{his role}} as the eponymous professor, much to the despair of Nigel Kneale, who had heavily criticised his {{interpretation}} of the role in The Quatermass Xperiment. As had been the case on The Quatermass Xperiment, Donlevy's alcoholism presented challenges for the production. Nigel Kneale recalled visiting the set one day: “He [...] was so full of whiskey he could hardly stand up. He staggered over to the set and looked dazedly around. They held up an idiot board with his lines on and he said, “What's this movie called?” and they said, “Well, it's called Quatermass 2”. He said, “I've got to say all that? There's too much talk. Cut down some of the talk”. He tried to read it and he had to have go after go after go, so crippled with drink he hardly knew who he was”. Val Guest has denied Kneale's claims, saying “So many stories have been concocted since, about how he was a paralytic. It's absolute balls, because he was not paralytic. He wasn't stone cold sober either, but he was a pro and he knew his lines”. Guest also recalled, “By after lunch he would come to me and say “Give me a breakdown of the story so far. Where have I just been before this scene?” We used to <b>feed</b> <b>him</b> black coffee all morning but then we discovered he was lacing it. But he was a very professional actor and very easy to work with”.|$|E
