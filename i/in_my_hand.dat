500|$|Domestically, the Cold War {{was in the}} {{forefront}} of national consciousness. In February 1950, Senator Joseph McCarthy rose suddenly to national fame when he claimed [...] "I have here <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> a list" [...] of over 200 communists who were employed in the State Department. McCarthy made the claim in The Wheeling speech. In September 1950, the USCongress passed the McCarran Internal Security Act, which required communist organizations to register with the government, and formed the Subversive Activities Control Board to investigate persons suspected of engaging in subversive activities. High-profile hearings involving alleged communists included the 1950 conviction of Alger Hiss, the 1951 trial of the Rosenbergs, and the 1954 investigation of J. Robert Oppenheimer.|$|E

500|$|McCarthy {{experienced}} a meteoric rise in national profile on February 9, 1950, {{when he gave}} a Lincoln Day speech to the Republican Women's Club of Wheeling, West Virginia.

However, it is generally agreed that he produced a piece of paper that he claimed contained a list of known Communists working for the State Department. McCarthy is usually quoted to have said: [...] "The State Department is infested with communists.

500|$|Ali {{learned that}} his {{regurgitation}} talents {{had the potential to}} entertain and to earn money through performance at the age of fifteen:I tried out my tricks first of all in the street, swallowing many glasses of water and then pouring forth a great fountain {{from one side of the}} road to the other... A cafe proprietor saw me doing this one day, and chased me down the street. I thought he wanted to beat me up, but no—all he did was to put a coin <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> and ask me to repeat the trick. Finally, he was so delighted that he asked me to come to his cafe and entertain the customers. Taking his abilities on the road, Ali met an Italian man in Cairo who signed him to a contract for music hall performances. Ali performed under contract throughout Europe and at times for heads of state. According to Ali, in or about 1914 he was summoned by Tsar NicholasII of Russia to perform at the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg, Russia. He stated that the Tsar [...] "must have liked my performance because he awarded me a special decoration, which is now one of my most treasured possessions." [...] Following World War I, Ali began managing his own affairs and toured the world, learning more tricks as he went.|$|E

2500|$|In June 1900, Weber {{was almost}} 21 and {{was living with}} her parents and two sisters at 1717 Fremont Street, Allegheny, Pennsylvania, where she was a music student.

She toured the United States as a concert pianist with renowned harpist Mrs Apt Thomas until her final performance in Charleston, South Carolina a year later. After an unfortunate incident when a piano key broke during a recital, Weber retired from the concert stage, having lost her nerve to play in public. Weber describes the incident that precipitated her retirement: [...] "Just as I started to play a black key came off <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand.</b> I kept forgetting that the key was not there, and reaching for it. The incident broke my nerve. I could not finish and I never appeared on the concert stage again.
