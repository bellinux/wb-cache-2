50|$|The VMSC will {{request the}} {{information}} needed {{for it to}} deliver the Short Message to its recipient by sending a Send_Info_for_MT_SMS message to the VLR. The VLR will then instigate a page request, or subscriber search, for the destination subscribers Mobile Subscriber <b>ISDN</b> <b>Number</b> (MSISDN), and return the result to the VMSC. Since a typical deployment sees the VLR being co-located with the MSC, this message flow is usually internal to the platform. Should the page or search for the subscriber fail, the VLR will indicate the failure cause to the VMSC, which will abort the Short Message delivery procedure and return the failure to the SMSC (see the Failed Short Message delivery section below). If the page of the handset was successful, the VMSC will then send to the SMSC indicating successful delivery. The GMSC component of the SMSC passes {{the result of the}} delivery attempt to the Service Centre. In the case of successful delivery, the delivered text message will be removed from the Store and Forward Engine (SFE) and, if requested, a delivery report sent to the text originator. If the delivery failed, the SMSC invokes a retry procedure to periodically make further attempts at delivery; additionally, it may register with the HLR to receive a notification when the B-Party becomes available for Short Message delivery in the future (see the Failed Short Message delivery section below).|$|E
40|$|This Standard {{is one of}} {{a series}} of ECMA Standards which are {{applicable}} to Private Integrated Services Networks (PISNs). Its purpose is to serve as a general and common reference for all addressing-related statements in other standards on PISNs. This Standard is based on the ISDN concept as developed by ITU-T and refined by ETSI for European applications, but modified to cover the particularities of PISNs. It conforms to the framework of International Standards for Open Systems Interconnection as defined by ISO/IEC. This particular Standard enables the Administrator of a PISN to choose whether • the <b>ISDN</b> <b>Numbering</b> Plan according to ITU-T Rec. E. 164, or • a Private Numbering Plan, or • an Implicit Numbering Plan, or • an OSI NSAP addressing plan, or • any combination of these numbering plans shall be employed as native numbering plan(s) in its PISN (PISN NP). In addition, the Administrator can employ PISN subaddressing in order to expand the addressing capacity beyond the capacity of the PISN NP. The impact of this on terminal interchangeability between accesses of public and private ISDNs is indicated in annex D...|$|R
50|$|In Germany, ISDN {{was very}} popular with an {{installed}} base of 25 million channels (29% of all subscriber lines in Germany as of 2003 and 20% of all ISDN channels worldwide). Due {{to the success of}} <b>ISDN,</b> the <b>number</b> of installed analog lines was decreasing. Deutsche Telekom (DTAG) offered both BRI and PRI. Competing phone companies often offered ISDN only and no analog lines. However, these operators generally offered free hardware that also allows the use of POTS equipment, such as NTBAs with integrated terminal adapters. Because of the widespread availability of ADSL services, ISDN was primarily used for voice and fax traffic.|$|R
50|$|There is {{a second}} viewpoint: that of the {{telephone}} industry, where ISDN is a core technology. A telephone network {{can be thought of}} as a collection of wires strung between switching systems. The common electrical specification for the signals on these wires is T1 or E1. Between telephone company switches, the signaling is performed via SS7. Normally, a PBX is connected via a T1 with robbed bit signaling to indicate on-hook or off-hook conditions and MF and DTMF tones to encode the destination <b>number.</b> <b>ISDN</b> is much better because messages can be sent much more quickly than by trying to encode numbers as long (100 ms per digit) tone sequences. This results in faster call setup times. Also, a greater number of features are available and fraud is reduced.|$|R
40|$|VoIP {{services}} {{are becoming increasingly}} a big competition to existing telephony services (POTS / <b>ISDN).</b> The increas-ing <b>number</b> of customers using VoIP makes VoIP services a valuable target for attackers that want {{to bring down the}} service, take it over or simply abuse it to distribute their own content, like SPAM. Hence, the need arises to protect VoIP services from all kinds of attacks that target network band-width, server capacity or server architectural constrains. In this article we present VoIP Defender, a generic security architecture, called VoIP-Defender, to monitor, detect, an-alyze and counter attacks relevant for a SIP-based VoIP in-frastructure. The VoIP-Defender is highly scalable and can be easily extended with new detection algorithms. Analy-sis and traffic control can be performed from the SIP layer down to the transport-, network- and MAC layer. VoIP De-fender is designed to work fully transparent to clients and SIP servers, and can analyze and filter traffic in real time, which we demonstrate with measurements with our imple-mentation. 1...|$|R
