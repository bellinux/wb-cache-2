50|$|Events moved fast thereafter. Confederate troops {{withdrew from}} Norfolk and Suffolk, Virginia and {{set fire to}} the Navy Yard at Portsmouth, Virginia. San Jacinto helped to provide naval support as U.S. troops {{occupied}} the <b>evacuated</b> <b>area.</b> In the early hours of 11 May, Virginia's crew set the dreaded Southern ironclad ablaze and she blew up before dawn.|$|R
50|$|The Stormvloedwaarschuwingsdienst (SVSD; Storm Surge Warning Service) makes a {{water level}} {{forecast}} {{in case of}} a storm surge and warns the responsible parties in the affected coastal districts. These can then take appropriate measures depending on the expected water levels, such as <b>evacuating</b> <b>areas</b> outside the dikes, closing barriers and in extreme cases patrolling the dikes during the storm.|$|R
5000|$|If {{evacuation}} orders are given too early, the hurricane can change course {{and leave the}} <b>evacuated</b> <b>area</b> unscathed. People may think they have weathered hurricanes before, when in reality the hurricane didn't hit them directly, giving them false confidence. Those who have lived on the coast for ten or more years are the most resistant to evacuating. http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:dmakGqrXA9sJ:www.scseagrant.org/pdf_files/ch_summer_02.pdf+hurricane+evacuation+refuse+old-timers&hl=en&client=firefox-a ...|$|R

25|$|From 22 September 1944 {{to the end}} of the war, {{there was}} gas {{available}} only two hours per day. Electricity stopped on 9 October. The German occupiers built a thick, black wall through the Haarlemmerhout (in the south of the city), as well as at the Jan Gijzenvaart in the <b>evacuated</b> <b>area.</b> The wall was called Mauer-muur and was meant to help defend the city.|$|R
50|$|ARP wardens ensured the {{blackout}} was observed, sounded air raid sirens, safely guided people into public air raid shelters, issued and checked gas masks, <b>evacuated</b> <b>areas</b> around unexploded bombs, rescued people where possible from bomb damaged properties, located temporary accommodation {{for those who}} had been bombed out, and reporting to their Control Centre about incidents, fires, etc. and to call in other services as required.|$|R

50|$|In June 1941, {{weeks after}} the German {{invasion}} began, Stalin also directed the employment of a scorched earth policy of destroying the infrastructure and food supplies of areas before the Germans could seize them, and he also directed that partisans were {{to be set up}} in <b>evacuated</b> <b>areas.</b> He also ordered the NKVD to murder around one hundred thousand political prisoners in areas where the Wehrmacht approached, while others were deported east.|$|R
50|$|While {{there remains}} the {{potential}} for sudden devastation from a tsunami, warning systems can be effective. For example, {{if there were a}} very large subduction zone earthquake (moment magnitude 9.0) off the west coast of the United States, people in Japan, would therefore have more than 12 hours (and likely warnings from warning systems in Hawaii and elsewhere) before any tsunami arrived, giving them some time to <b>evacuate</b> <b>areas</b> likely to be affected.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the event}} of a major incident, such as civil unrest or a major disaster, many governments {{maintain}} the right to declare a state of emergency, which gives them extensive powers over the daily lives of their citizens, and may include temporary curtailment on certain civil rights, including the right to trial (for instance to discourage looting of an <b>evacuated</b> <b>area,</b> a shoot on sight policy, however unlikely, may be in force) ...|$|R
5000|$|The Israeli Air Force issued {{warnings}} to civilians prior to military actions {{by way of}} leaflet droppings to <b>evacuate</b> <b>areas</b> {{in which it was}} intending to strike against Hezbollah strongholds. These leaflets warned residents of southern Lebanon to <b>evacuate</b> an <b>area</b> approximately 32 km wide, giving civilian populations time to evacuate despite providing an early warning to the intended target, Hezbollah militants. The New York Times noted that [...] "Israel has been careful to drop leaflets warning civilians in southern Beirut and southern Lebanon where it knows that Hezbollah keeps stores of rockets and launchers in apartment houses, garages and homes." [...] Also, general leaflets explaining Israel's desire not to bring harm to the Lebanese populace were dropped, asking civilians to [...] "refrain from being located in places in relation to Hezbollah." ...|$|R
25|$|In Florida, the American Red Cross {{and local}} {{officials}} in South Florida took precautions while residents <b>evacuated</b> low-lying <b>areas</b> in the Everglades.|$|R
2500|$|Anticipating floods {{before they}} occur allows for {{precautions}} {{to be taken}} and people to be warned [...] {{so that they can be}} prepared in advance for flooding conditions. For example, farmers can remove animals from low-lying areas and utility services can put in place emergency provisions to re-route services if needed. Emergency services can also make provisions to have enough resources available ahead of time to respond to emergencies as they occur. People can <b>evacuate</b> <b>areas</b> to be flooded.|$|R

30|$|Twenty-five {{years after}} the Chernobyl {{accident}}, the third and most recent NPP-related accident occurred when an underwater earthquake triggered a tsunami that hit the Japanese coastline, causing massive damage at the Fukushima Daiichi NPP (U.S. NRC 2013 d). The Japanese government in its initial response evacuated approximately 160, 000 people living within a 12 - to 19 -mile radius of the Fukushima plant (Morris-Suzuki et al. 2012), but the impacted areas {{have proven to be}} much wider than the <b>evacuated</b> <b>areas.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Holcomb Firewas a {{wildfire}} {{that burned}} due north of Big Bear Lake near Highway 18 in the San Bernardino National Forest in San Bernardino County, California. Within several days, the fire would consume some 1,500 plus acres as it threatened {{the areas of}} Baldwin Lake (San Bernardino County, California) and Highway 18. However, while the fire rapidly grew in size, {{the head of the}} fire was seen to be moving away from structures, thus leaving <b>evacuated</b> <b>areas</b> under voluntary evacuation.|$|R
5000|$|The first, unofficial, {{committee}} {{was composed of}} Weitz; Ezra Danin, head of the Arab section of the SHAI, the intelligence arm of the Haganah; and Eliyahu Sasson, head of the Middle East Affairs Department of the Foreign Ministry. Danin told Weitz that to prevent {{the return of the}} refugees who had already left, they must be [...] "confronted with a fait accomplis." [...] He proposed the destruction of Arab homes, settling Jewish immigrants in <b>evacuated</b> <b>areas,</b> and expropriating Arab property.|$|R

50|$|As of Thursday, July 5, {{the fire}} was at 90 percent containment, with 776 {{personnel}} working the fire (fewer people than the day before). Thirty-seven homes that were evacuated were by now reported to have been burglarized, and authorities were offering up to $50,000 {{for information on the}} culprits. In addition, 28 vehicles, many packed with evacuee's belongings, also were broken into after residents fled the fire. The National Guard was summoned to secure and help protect properties within the <b>evacuated</b> <b>areas.</b> On July 10, 2012, {{the fire was}} 100 percent contained.|$|R
5000|$|NGO airlift support {{had been}} {{temporarily}} suspended pending the further {{assessment of the}} situation at the Fukushima Nuclear Plant. CMAT Directors spoke with Canadian Nuclear Officials who stated: [...] "Standard Personal Protective Equipment (PPE: coveralls, masks, gloves) would be adequate {{if they had to}} go inside the <b>evacuated</b> <b>area,</b> but at 100+ km away, no one would have received a significant radiation dose, even at Chernoble." [...] The Canadian Nuclear Official was also confident that only small amounts of radioactive material were recently released in Japan, and in a controlled manner.|$|R
