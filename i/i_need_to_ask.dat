40|$|Listening… {{can involve}} the {{listener}} in an intense, efficacious, and {{complex set of}} communicative acts in which one is not speaking, discussing, or disclosing, but sitting quietly, watching, and feeling-the-place, through all the senses…. In the process, one becomes {{a part of the}} scene, hearing and feeling with it (Carbaugh 1999 : 259). To listen this way involves much more than providing a chance for words to be spoken; it includes tuning in and getting the listening frequency clear. As a non-Indigenous person seeking to conduct qualitative research that listens to Aboriginal people, <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> how I can tune into the “active attentiveness” described by Carbaugh (1999) in order to listen {{in a manner that is}} appropriate, respectful and minimises my inherent white privilege. In addressing this question I draw on the work of Indigenous authors and academics, critical whiteness studies and my own experiences learning from Aboriginal people in a number of contexts over the past ten to fifteen years. History in Australia since colonization has created a situation where Aboriginal voices are white noise to the ears of many non-Indigenous people. This paper proposes that white privilege and the resulting white noise can be minimised and greater clarity given to Aboriginal voices by privileging Indigenous knowledge and ways of working when addressing Indigenous issues. To minimise the interference of white noise, non-Indigenous people would do well to adopt a position that recognises, acknowledges and utilises some of the strengths that can be learned from Aboriginal culture and Indigenous authors. This paper outlines a model of apprentice, allied listening for non-Indigenous researchers to adopt when preparing to conduct research alongside Indigenous people. Such an approach involves Re-learning of history, Reviewing of the researcher’s beliefs and placing Relating at the centre of the listening approach. Each of these aspects of listening is based on privileging of Indigenous voices...|$|E

The Whittakers and Dr Nowak {{are members of the}} same evangelical church, Riverwood Community Church, and they have grown to be friends over the past few years. Dr Nowak examined Amber, performed a rapid strep test, which was positive, and informed her that she had a streptococcal pharyngitis. “Try not to kiss any boys this week, ” Dr Nowak said with a smile. “Actually, now that you mention it, ” Amber said, “that’s something I wanted to ask you about. My boyfriend and I have been together {{for more than a year}} now, and we’ve been talking seriously about marriage. ” “That’s great! I’m glad to hear things are going well, ” Dr Nowak said. “Well, that’s not all: we feel we’re ready to start having sex, and <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you to write me a prescription for birth control pills. ” Dr Nowak paused for a moment, then explained, “You know, Amber, I appreciate you sharing this with me, but I imagine you know how I feel about premarital sex. As your doctor, friend, and fellow Christian, I think this is an unwise decision, and I can’t in good conscience help you do something I think is wrong. ” “But doctor, we’ve both thought about it, and we love each other, so why put it off any longer?” “As a physician, ” Dr Nowak replied, “I’m committed to doing what’s in my patients’ best interest. And I believe, based on the Scriptures we both read and on our common understanding of God’s nature and purposes for us, that sex is the consummation of a spiritual union between husband and wife. Sex is created by God to be enjoyed in the context of marriage, and saving it for that moment makes it all the more special. I realize that’s difficult, and it’s not what our culture at large believes. But if we call ourselves Christians, we need to carry our beliefs into every aspect of our identity? including something as personal as our sexuality. ...|$|E

40|$|When {{compared}} to other women in Australia Aboriginal women are considered the most socially and economically disadvantaged and have the poorest health status. Aboriginal women in Rockhampton, Central Queensland are not excluded from this lived reality. This research has explored Aboriginal women’s perceptions and experiences of health and health services in Rockhampton. Drawing on these experiences, and centring the voices of these women, the study reports on findings concerning cross-cultural issues, communication, policy, practice and service delivery. Importantly, the study has built new knowledge identifying the complex relationship between identity, body and well-being. In undertaking this study, I have developed a ‘talkin’ up’ research process in collaboration with other Aboriginal women. That is, by asking what Aboriginal women in Rockhampton wanted me as an Aboriginal woman researcher to explore and what type of process I would work through with Aboriginal women as the participants. The research has been informed and guided by these Aboriginal women and thus has witnessed the articulations of a more accurate portrayal of Aboriginal women’s perceptions and experiences of health services. I take the witnessing to be partly personally empowering, partly sharing and partly a taking of ownership of experience. As those women interviewed explained, our story here is told ‘by us’. In undertaking such a research process, <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> {{what it means to}} be an Indigenous researcher and what is a good Indigenous research process? These are addressed at length within the thesis. This research process has not involved examining health services with regards to their service provision or their implementation of more empowering practices to improve health outcomes for Aboriginal women. This remains to be done. This research, has instead attempted to answer the question ‘how the relationship between health services and Aboriginal women can be more empowering from the viewpoints of Aboriginal women?’ The assumption underpinning this study is that empowering and re-empowering practices for Aboriginal women can lead to improved health outcomes. The study found : Aboriginal women had requirements of health services relating to cultural comfort of health service environments Aboriginal women did not access one health provider for all their health needs, they ‘shopped around’ to meet their general health, Women’s Business and relationship and privacy requirements Aboriginal women’s health is impacted upon by stereotypes held of Aboriginal women around skin colour and Aboriginality Aboriginal women have an understanding of what is required to improve the interactions between health service providers and Aboriginal wome...|$|R
