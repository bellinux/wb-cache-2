40|$|Flow through porous {{media has}} been used to model resin {{impregnation}} in composites manufacturing processes such as resin transfer molding. Many numerical schemes have been used to explore the efficiency and accuracy in description of the movement of the liquid front when it is introduced through injection gates into a mold containing stationary and compacted fibrous porous media. In all numerical schemes, injection gates are modelled with a single node. Mathematically, a single node definition for a finite radius <b>injection</b> <b>gate</b> imparts a singularity. In this paper, an approach to avoid this singularity by modelling the <b>injection</b> <b>gate</b> with more than one node is presented. An analytical solution relating the fill time to the <b>injection</b> <b>gate</b> radius is developed for a constant pressure injection from a spherical <b>injection</b> <b>gate</b> into an isotropic media. A new parameter ‘mesh density level’, defined as the ratio of the injection radius to the element size, is used to investigate the accuracy and the convergence of the numerical results. It is shown that the numerical results converge when the mesh density level is increased. The accuracy of the results depends on the ratio of the flow-front radius to the <b>injection</b> <b>gate</b> radius {{as well as on the}} mesh density level. In many situations, a spherical <b>injection</b> <b>gate</b> may not represent the correct physics and model simplification may be necessary. The impact of such simplifications is also quantified. The systematic analysis presented in this paper should prove useful to the modeller in taking the decision whether to select the proper, geometric definition for the <b>injection</b> <b>gate</b> to obtain accurate results or to define the <b>injection</b> <b>gate</b> using a single node and be aware of the errors introduced due to the singularity...|$|E

40|$|Injection Molding (IM) is {{considered}} {{to be the most important}} process for mass-producing plastic products. One of the biggest challenges facing injection molders is to determine the best settings for the controllable process variables (CPVs). Selecting the proper settings is crucial because the behavior of the polymeric material during shaping is highly influenced by the process variables. The difficulty of optimizing an IM process is that the performance measures (PMs), such as surface quality or cycle time that characterize the adequacy of the part for its intended purpose usually show conflicting behavior. Furthermore, in actual molding, the CPVs will vary over some range during molding. This inconsistency of the process variables will lead to variability in the PMs. In high precision manufacturing, in particular for micro and nano scale components and devices, this variability needs to be minimized, and if possible eliminated. Thus, the variability in the PMs needs to be included in the optimization problem. The aim of this work is to demonstrate a method based on CAE, statistical testing, artificial neural networks (ANNs), and data envelopment analysis (DEA) to find the optimal compromises between multiple PMs and their variability to prescribe the values for the CPVs in IM. We present an example where the optimization is carried out in two phases. Phase one uses the PMs that are significantly affected by the <b>injection</b> <b>gate</b> location in order to prescribe two possible injection gates. Phase two of the optimization uses Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to find a PM-based efficient frontier for each <b>injection</b> <b>gate</b> considering process variability.

40|$|The {{significant}} off-stage {{gate current}} of nitrided-oxide n-MOSFETs {{can be attributed}} to severe hot-hole <b>injection</b> into the <b>gate</b> oxide during band-to-band (B-B) tunneling due to a nitridation-induced lowering of barrier height for hole injection.

A subsequent hot-electron <b>injection</b> into the <b>gate</b> oxide can neutralize these trapped holes and make the reduced GIDL current recover, even increase beyond the original value.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effects of}} hydrodynamically induced textile {{deformation}} during resin injection in Liquid Composites Molding processes have been experimentally investigated for various fiber volume fractions in a rectangular flow channel with linear <b>injection</b> <b>gate.</b> For layups from bi-directional 45 engineered glass fiber fabric, three deformation effects have been identified: Wrinkling of the topmost fabric layer for low fiber volume fractions, instantaneous in-plane compression of the layup during fiber wetting for intermediate fiber volume fractions, delayed in-plane compression of the wetted {{part of the}} fabric for high fiber volume fractions. The deformation behavior is determined by the fabric stiffness and the fixation in the flow channel due to clamping. The fabric has been experimentally characterized with respect to compressibility and coefficient of static friction {{in order to understand the}} clamping effect. The injection pressure, which is critical for deformation, has been determined as function of the fiber volume fraction, i. e. as function of the clamping pressure. The characteristics of the function have been correlated with the three observed deformation effects. A simple mechanical model for description of layup displacement and compression, implying visco-elastic behavior of the fabric and clamping with friction on the flow channel walls for various impregnation states, is presented.

40|$|Fibre {{reinforced}} plastics (FRP) are of considerable {{interest to the}} automotive industry. Intelligent application of these materials could reduce vehicle weight for higher operating efficiency, at a reduced manufacturing cost. The principal use of FRP in high volume (greater than 100, 000 parts per annum) has been restricted to non-structural body panels made from short fibre reinforcement. Long fibre reinforced composites are ideal for load bearing structures resulting from a high specific strength. However, a high volume technique to produce these components at a moderate cost has not been realised. One long fibre reinforcement process {{with the potential to}} meet the high volume demands of the automotive industry is resin transfer moulding (RTM). Prolonged cycle times are an obstacle to high volume RTM. Cycle time is dictated by thermal quench near the <b>injection</b> <b>gate</b> from cold resin entering the hot mould. Heat recovery by the mould, and coincident heating of the resin to initiate cure is necessary to complete the cycle. Microwave preheating of the resin before injection reduces thermal quench. Since microwave heating is volumetric, low conductivity resins can be heated uniformly and efficiently. In-line resin preheating has been developed for its compatibility with high volume RTM. The use of an in-line microwave resin preheating system to reduce cycle time was investigated. This system was incorporated into the automatic RTM cycle. The resin temperature could be held constant or profiled during injection using a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) power controller. Both injection techniques reduced cycle time, although temperature profiling enabled coincident resin cure across the mould for a maximum cycle time reduction. Resin preheating had no adverse affects on the RTM process or laminates. This suggested that the microwave resin preheating system could be retrofitted within an existing RTM facility to reduce the component cycle time without damaging the mould or degrading component quality...|$|E
40|$|International audienceComposite {{materials}} often {{suffer from}} process-induced defects such as voids that lower their overall performance and thus limit their wider application. Void formation mechanisms and detrimental effects of voids on mechanical properties of composite parts {{have been studied}} extensively. In contrast, limited void reduction strategies are available for the industry. In this study, post-cure compression is proposed as a void reduction technique for thermosetting composites. A resin transfer molded composite disk is fabricated by injecting a thermosetting resin into center-gated mold cavity preloaded with randomly-oriented glass fiber preform. After cure, void content is studied at 25. 4 mm (1 ") and 50. 8 mm (2 ") away from the <b>injection</b> <b>gate</b> of the 76. 2 mm (3 ") -radius composite disk. Two adjacent samples are obtained from each location; the first is utilized as a baseline {{and the second is}} compressed at 70 °C, slightly above the glass transition temperature, until reaching 6 % compression in thickness. Void content, shape and size in each specimen are obtained via microscopic image analysis. Resulting level of voids as well as void morphologies from the four samples are compared in order to assess post-cure compression effects. Initial void content is measured at 2. 13 %. Post-cure compression is observed to induce a 37. 8 % decrease in void content down to 1. 33 %. Considerable difference is also observed in void morphology. Voids become smaller after compression with almost 27 % decrease in the average void size, from 44. 7 µm down to 32. 7 µm. With respect to void shape, voids become more elongated after compression as the so-called shape ratio decreases from 0. 85 to 0. 73. Circular voids dropped from 42. 3 % in the baselines to 32. 7 % in the compressed samples. In contrast, elliptical and irregular void frequencies increased by 8. 3 and 56. 7 %, respectively. Post-cure compression is thus found to be applicable to thermosetting composites for void reduction. However, combining post-cure compression with other void reduction techniques such as vacuum assistance and packing might yield higher void reduction rates and lower the occurrence of irregular voids...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} an approach of how warpage (i. e. part deflection) and injection pressure of an intricate geometry could be minimised by selecting an optimal thermoplastic material and <b>injection</b> <b>gate</b> location (through which the molten plastic {{flows into the}} cavity). The numerical analyses for mould filling considered four gate locations along with a PP (polypropylene), PS (polystyrene) and a fibre-filled PP material (each had different shrinkage characteristics, mechanical property and viscosity). Results of the cavity filling simulations indicated that (on average) the largest and smallest warpage was predicted with the PP and PS respectively. The warpage of the fibre-filled PP showed the most gate location dependent behaviour. In addition, the lowest injection pressure {{was associated with the}} fibre-filled PP. For reduced pressure, the best and second best solutions for gate location were the top and middle ones. In addition, specific attention was paid to differential fibre orientation, {{as one of the most}} important factors responsible for part warpage. In an attempt to maximise the part stiffness, the fibre-filled PP was selected. It became clear that the gate location affected the melt flow evolution and therefore the fibre orientation. Simulation results showed that bidirectional flow and asymmetrical fibre distribution was achieved with the gate positioned at the mid-section of the part. Unidirectional flow and therefore symmetrical fibre distribution could be achieved by placing the gate at the top section of the part. The injection moulding experimental utilised the fibre-filled PP along with the two aforementioned gate locations. It was discovered that warpage was present when the middle gate was applied, but it was successfully eliminated using the top gate location. It can be stated that differential fibre orientation did not cause warpage, but the asymmetrical distribution of fibre orientation did. The information discussed in the paper may be particularly useful in the early mould/part design stages when any modification can still be easily and cost-effectively implemented. An important finding is that the final gate location should only be chosen after the thermoplastic material properties and melt flow direction have been taken into account. The successful reduction of warpage and injection pressure may help to reduce the amount of production waste and energy consumption, ensuring defect-free sustainable manufacturing...|$|E
