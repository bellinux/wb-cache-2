40|$|A dual {{self-powered}} biosensing system <b>integrated</b> {{with energy}} <b>amplification</b> <b>circuit</b> is described, for simultaneously monitoring glucose and lactate. The self-powered biosensing system {{is based on}} the conventional enzymatic biofuel cell equipped with three 4 mm x 4 mm massively dense mesh network of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) bioelectrodes in parallel configuration. The bioelectrodes employed pyroquinoline quinone glucose dehydrogenase (PQQ-GDH) as the biocatalyst for the glucose oxidation and D-Lactate dehydrogenase (D-LDH) as the biocatalyst for lactate oxidation. A common laccase modified-MWCNTs bioelectrode served as the cathode for the reduction of molecular oxygen. Two charge pump circuits were coupled with 0. 1 mF capacitors functioning as transducers. The advantages of employing capacitors were coupled with the efficient energy amplification of the charge pump circuit to amplify the power output from each of the biofuel and charge/discharge the corresponding capacitor. Under operating conditions, the open circuit voltages and short circuit current densities for 180 mg/dL glucose and 25 mM lactate were 339. 2 mV and 228. 75 µA/cm 2 and 370 mV and 66. 17 µA/cm 2, respectively. The responses for glucose and lactate were linear up to 630 mg/dL and 30 mM with sensitivities of 20. 11 Hz/ mM cm- 2 and 9. 869 Hz/ mM cm- 2, respectively. The potential of the described system was demonstrated to provide stable voltage and current output that was capable of driving the charge pump circuit integrated with the capacitor for simultaneously monitoring glucose and lactate. These results were in good agreement with those previously reported...|$|R

40|$|Nucleic acids are information-dense, {{programmable}} polymers {{that can}} be engineered into primers, probes, molecular motors, and signal <b>amplification</b> <b>circuits</b> for computation, diagnostic, and therapeutic purposes. Signal <b>amplification</b> <b>circuits</b> increase the signal-to-noise ratio of target nucleic acids {{in the absence of}} enzymes and thermal cycling. Amplification is made possible via toehold mediated strand displacement – a process where one nucleic acid strand binds to a nucleation site on a complementary helix, which then displaces one of the two strands in a nucleic acid complex. When compared to polymerase chain reactions (PCR), the sensitivity and stability of toehold-mediated strand displacement reactions suffer from circuit leakage – reactions of the system {{in the absence of an}} initiator. Presented here, from a materials science and engineering perspective, defect engineering has improved the leakage performance of model strand displacement systems made from DNA. Engineered defects used in this study included mismatched base pairs and alternative nucleic acids – both of which are known to impact the stability of hybridization. To identify sources of leakage in a model signal <b>amplification</b> <b>circuit,</b> availability was defined as the probability that a DNA base (A. T. C. G) was unpaired at equilibrium. This design metric was calculated using NUPACK, a thermodynamic modeling tool. To further understand the relationship between leakage rates and secondary structures, mutual availability was defined as the sum of all pairwise products of the availabilities of the corresponding bases in solution. This thermodynamic analysis yielded rational design principles for how to minimize leakage by as much as 4 -fold by site-specifically introducing mismatched base pairs into DNA duplex regions. To further reduce leakage, chemically modified locked nucleic acids (LNAs) were site-specifically introduced into a model DNA strand displacement system. Briefly described, LNAs are geometrically restricted RNA analogues with enhanced thermo-mechanical stability towards their complement base. When compared to a DNA control with identical sequences, the leakage exhibited by a hybrid DNA/LNA system was reduced from 1. 48 M- 1 s- 1 (for the DNA system) to 0. 03 M- 1 s- 1. In addition, the signal-to-noise ratio increased ~ 50 -fold for a similar hybrid system. This research provides insight into the sources of leakage in DNA strand-displacement systems, as well as how to maximize strand-displacement performance via the selective introduction of hybridization defects. Rational design of future nucleic acid signal <b>amplification</b> <b>circuits</b> will lead to broader applications in a variety of fields that range from DNA computation to point-of-care diagnostics and therapeutics...|$|R
