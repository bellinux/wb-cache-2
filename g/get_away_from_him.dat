25|$|Pepé Le Pew storylines {{typically}} involve Pepé {{in pursuit}} of a female black cat, whom Pepé mistakes for a skunk ("la belle femme skunk fatale"). The cat, who was retroactively named Penelope Pussycat, often has a white stripe painted down her back, usually by accident (such as by squeezing under a fence with wet white paint). Penelope frantically races to <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> because of his putrid odour, his overly aggressive manner or both, while Pepé hops after her at a leisurely pace.|$|E
500|$|Mathew Hayman {{described}} his reaction as [...] "disbelief". He had broken {{his arm in}} a crash at the Omloop Het Nieuwsblad {{at the beginning of}} the classics season and had barely raced before the race began. He said that he had realised that the other riders were not superior to him after they failed to <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> in the closing kilometres. He stated that he could [...] "gamble" [...] and that it had paid off. Hayman's team manager, Shayne Bannan, described him as [...] "so professional" [...] and suggested that he had been helped by good preparation and motivation combined with a lack of expectation; he called it [...] "an incredible ride".|$|E
500|$|Karofsky is {{featured}} in the first eleven episodes of the second season continuing his bullying ways; in the sixth, [...] "Never Been Kissed", he especially targets Kurt, who is gay. After he slams Kurt into a locker, Kurt chases after and confronts him, and an increasingly agitated Karofsky abruptly grabs Kurt and kisses him. Before Karofsky can initiate a second kiss, a stunned Kurt shoves him away, and Karofsky leaves. Kurt and his new gay friend Blaine Anderson (Darren Criss) later {{try to talk to}} him about being gay and closeted, but he denies that the kiss happened and soon resumes his bullying. He even threatens to kill Kurt if he tells anyone else about the kiss. Kurt's father Burt (Mike O'Malley) finds out about the threat, but not the kiss, and Karofsky is soon expelled, but is allowed to return by the school board because no physical violence to Kurt had been witnessed; Kurt transfers to Dalton Academy to <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E

Riegels told the Associated Press, [...] "I was running toward the sidelines when I picked up the ball... I started to turn to my left toward Tech's goal. Somebody shoved me and I bounded right off into a tackler. In {{pivoting}} to <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>him,</b> I completely lost my bearings." [...] Teammate and quarterback Benny Lom chased Riegels, screaming at him to stop.

[...] The Bears chose to punt rather than risk a play so close to their own end zone, but Maree blocked Lom's punt for a safety, giving Tech a 2–0 lead.|$|E
500|$|The Philadelphia Inquirer spoke {{positively}} {{about the}} action scenes, noting the [...] "epic shootouts that bookend Hard-Boiled, John Woo's blood-soaked Hong Kong gangster extravaganza, are wondrously staged, brilliantly photographed tableaux." [...] The Boston Herald proclaimed {{the film as}} [...] "arguably Woo's masterpiece, it is an action film to end all action films, an experience so deliriously cinematic it makes [...] "True Romance," [...] a film that clearly aspires to it, look like a cheap copy" [...] A review in Newsday gave the film {{three and a half}} stars, stating that [...] "Mayhem has never looked better than in John Woo's latest high-caliber cops-and-robbers thriller, even if the plot is a bit slippery" [...] and that John Woo [...] "has blasted the action genre onto a whole new level. His shootouts are a ballet; his firebombings are poetry. And while he lets the body count <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>him,</b> he constantly fascinates, through a combination of chaos and an excruciating control over what we're allowed to see." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1957 Paris, {{a series}} of mysterious killings are {{committed}} against young women of the same blood type who are found dead and drained of their blood. These killings are reported in the press as being performed by a murderer coined The Vampire. The journalist Pierre Lantin (Dario Michaelis) begins to investigate, and becomes more involved when his fiancee, the dancer Nora Duval is kidnapped. As Inspector Chantal (Carlo D'Angelo) examines the crime scene, Lantin arrives predicting that the crime was committed by The Vampire.

She brought the person a candle, and noticed that he wore a large cloak. The moment she had handed him the candle, however, he threw off the cloak and [...] "presented a most hideous and frightful appearance", vomiting blue and white flame from his mouth while his eyes resembled [...] "red balls of fire". Miss Alsop {{reported that}} he wore a large helmet and that his clothing, which appeared to be very tight-fitting, resembled white oilskin.

2500|$|Eschewing Capitol Studios, which Brian {{considered}} inadequate, engineer Chuck Britz often {{collaborated with}} him at Western 3 of United Western Recorders, also serving as a buffer between Brian and the oft-berating Murry whenever he was present. Once Britz assembled a preliminary recording setup, Brian would take over the console, directing the instrumentalists from the booth using an intercom or verbal gestures after supplying them with chord charts that were sometimes written incorrectly. According to some reports, even though Britz was responsible for setting up recording, Brian would then adjust his configuration to a large extent. Asher adds: [...] "As unorganized or even unproductive as he [...] could be in other situations, when he got into a recording session, you had the sense he had ideas that were gonna <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> if he didn't get 'em done right away. He was willing to have people be relaxed and joke a little bit, {{but he wanted to}} get work done. And he sometimes lost his temper just a little bit if Chuck couldn't find a take." [...] At Gold Star Studios, Brian worked mainly with engineers Stan Ross and, with lesser frequency, Larry Levine. Ross said of Brian, [...] " [...] liked the sound Gold Star got on the instrumentation, but he did the voices elsewhere because we were limited to two or three tracks and that wasn't enough for voice overdubbing. ... The tracks were really rhythm pads that would be sweetened after the voices were put on." ...|$|E

2500|$|At 15:04 {{my flight}} was {{attacked}} by three MiGs, two from the ‘10 o’clock’ and one from the ´6 o’clock´. Initially I didn’t see this last one because I had been concentrating on those approaching head-on. My WSO excitedly warned me about this rapidly approaching MiG, which was within firing range of my #3 and #4. I hesitated a while before interrupting my attack against the two MiGs in front, because I had seen the ‘Olds’ flight passing below us a few seconds before. I thought that the plane seen by my WSO {{could be one of}} them. Despite that, I suddenly turned left and then right, and caught sight of the third MiG. I ordered to my numbers 3 and 4 to break right. [...] As they did so, the MiG broke left for some mysterious reason and for a split second we were side by side. [...] We were so close that, besides the red stars in his wings, I could clearly see the pilot’s face. [...] I began a horizontal barrel roll to <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> and into an attack position, once in position, I launched a Sidewinder. [...] The missile missed because the evading MiG broke left at full throttle. [...] But when he did it, he put himself {{in the line of fire}} of my number 2, Captain Everett T. Raspberry. [...] I ordered him to follow the prey, because the two aircraft that I initially saw had been placed in my forward sector. [...] I was in an advantageous position, so I fired two AIM-9s against them in a quick sequence, and I turned to place myself as wingman of my #2, Captain Raspberry. [...] I kept on descending besides Captain Raspberry and I remember that I thought that he was still out of the optimal launching envelope. But he performed a barrel roll that placed him in a perfect position again and he launched an AIM-9 which hit against the tail section of the MiG-21. It was shaken violently and later fell in a slow, almost plane spin.|$|E

After the game, he protested to the media that the pitch had <b>gotten</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> {{and that he had}} no reason to hit Youkilis as he had a 2-2 count. Before the following game, during the YES Pre-Game Show, Joe Torre told reporters that after Proctor's ejection, Proctor stormed into Torre's office and insisted that he did not throw at Youkilis intentionally, an explanation Torre accepted. Torre, however, did not protest Proctor's resulting one-game suspension.|$|R
