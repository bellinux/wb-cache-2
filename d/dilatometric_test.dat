40|$|The alkali-silica {{reaction}} {{is one of}} the most damaging chemical reactions taking place in concrete, which can cause fatal damage. ASR originates under following conditions: high moisture (> 80 %), sufficient amount of alkaline ions (Ca 2 +, Na+, K+) and use of reactive aggregates (low crystaline or deformed quartz, amorphous SiO 2). Reactive aggretates react with high alkaline pore solution and produce hydrofile gels. These gels absorb water and swell. <b>Dilatometric</b> <b>test</b> methods are commonly used to evaluate the reactivity of aggregates. The principle of <b>dilatometric</b> <b>test</b> methods is simple. Mortar or concrete prisms are created in a laboratory, then they are stored in the special environment, which accelerates the inception of ASR. The creation and expansion of alkali-silica gels cause prism's length changes. The major goal of this diploma thesis was to evaluate the alkali-silica reactivity potential of quartz-rich rocks using microscopic (polarizing microscopy, scanning electron microscopy combined with SEM/BSE image analysis) and dilatometric (ASTM C 1260, RILEM AAR- 4. 1) methods. Rocks were assessed as reactive, potentially reactive and non-reactive by the ASTM C 1260 method.
