With hundreds of thousands of processors in one machine the parallelism is extreme, but so are the techniques that must be applied to obtain performance with that many processors. In this work we present optimizations of a Grid-based projector-augmented wave method software, GPAW, for the Blue Gene/P architecture. The improvements are achieved by exploring the advantage of shared and distributed memory programming also known as <b>hybrid</b> <b>programming</b> and blocked communication to improve latency hiding. The work focuses on optimizing a very time consuming operation in GPAW, the stencil operation, and different <b>hybrid</b> <b>programming</b> approaches are evaluated. The work succeeds in demonstrating a <b>hybrid</b> <b>programming</b> model, which is clearly beneficial compared to the original flat programming model. In total an improvement of 1. 94 compared to the original implementation is obtained. The results we demonstrate here are reasonably general and may be applied to other stencil codes...|$|E

40|$|Program slicing is {{a program}} {{decomposition}} technique that transforms a large program into a smaller one that contains only statements relevant to the computation of a selected function. Applications of program slicing {{can be found in}} software testing, debugging and maintenance where program slicing essentially reduces the amount of data that has to be analyzed in order to comprehend a program or parts of its functionality. In this thesis, two program slicing algorithms based on the notion of removable blocks are presented and they are (1) a general static program slicing algorithm and (2) criterion based <b>hybrid</b> <b>program</b> slicing algorithm. The thesis introduced new syntax tree representation using removable blocks and theorized a new navigation technique for the same. The new static slicing algorithm combined with the enhanced dynamic slicing algorithm is used to derive the criterion based hybrid slicing algorithm. The <b>hybrid</b> <b>program</b> slicing algorithm allows the user to define the range of accuracy between static and dynamic program slicing. These algorithms compute slices that are executable for structured and object-oriented programs. It uses the executable property of new static slicing to reduce the input source code to dynamic slicing to save the time and space.

40|$|Abstract—Many {{scientific}} {{applications are}} programmed using <b>hybrid</b> <b>programming</b> models that use both message-passing and sharedmemory, {{due to the}} increasing prevalence of large-scale systems with multicore, multisocket nodes. Previous work has shown that energy efficiency can be improved using software-controlled execution schemes that consider both the programming model and the power-aware execution capabilities of the system. However, such approaches have focused on identifying optimal resource utilization for one programming model, either shared-memory or message-passing, in isolation. The potential solution space, thus the challenge, increases substantially when optimizing hybrid models since the possible resource configurations increase exponentially. Nonetheless, with the accelerating adoption of <b>hybrid</b> <b>programming</b> models, we increasingly need improved energy efficiency in hybrid parallel applications on large-scale systems. In this work, we present new software-controlled execution schemes that consider the effects of dynamic concurrency throttling (DCT) and dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) {{in the context of}} <b>hybrid</b> <b>programming</b> models. Specifically, we present predictive models and novel algorithms based on statistical analysis that anticipate application power and time requirements under different concurrency and frequency configurations. We apply our models and methods to the NPB MZ benchmarks and selected applications from the ASC Sequoia codes. Overall, we achieve substantial energy savings (8. 74 % on average and up to 13. 8 %) with some performance gain (up to 7. 5 %) or negligible performance loss.

Typically, each model has its own strengths in performance or programmability for some kinds of applications but limitations for others. As a result, multiple programming models are often com-bined in a complimentary manner to exploit their mer-its and hide their weaknesses. However, existing models can only be loosely coupled due to their isolated runtime systems. In this paper, we present Transformer, the first sys-tem that supports <b>hybrid</b> <b>programming</b> models for data-intensive applications. Transformer has two unique con-tributions. First, Transformer offers a programming abstraction in a unified runtime system for different programming model implementations, such as Dryad, Spark, Pregel, and PowerGraph.

This was accomplished through systematic literature review of the qualitative research on counselor professional identity and identity development and the completion of a qualitative grounded theory exploration of doctoral students in a <b>hybrid</b> CE <b>program</b> as they developed their professional identity. The literature review consisted of twelve studies, and identified the areas of counselor professional identity mostly frequently studied and those that had been understudied, it highlighted the most common qualitative methodologies used, and revealed eight overarching themes across the studies reviewed. These results set the foundation for the grounded theory examination of how doctoral students in a <b>hybrid</b> CE <b>program</b> experienced their identity development as they transitioned from practitioner to educator. This grounded theory study looked at the experiences of nine individuals who were either currently enrolled in, or who recently graduated from a <b>hybrid</b> CE doctoral <b>program.</b> Three rounds of semi-structured interviews were completed, audio recorded and transcribed. A member check was conducted by email. Through the coding process, four categories emerged; beginning <b>hybrid</b> doctoral <b>program,</b> learning how to be a counselor educator (CE), connecting with others, and evolving sense of professional identity. Connecting with others developed as the central category because of its essential relationship to the professional identity experience of doctoral students in their <b>hybrid</b> <b>programs.</b> Beginning <b>hybrid</b> doctoral <b>program</b> emerged as the context of this study, and represented the <b>hybrid</b> <b>program</b> and certain experiences and qualities each participant had prior to starting their respective doctoral program. This context proved to be critical in fully understanding the professional identity development of the participants. This study provides a qualitative descriptive view of how doctoral students in a <b>hybrid</b> CE <b>program</b> experience their professional identity development.
