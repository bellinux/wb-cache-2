5|$|The bridge {{consists}} of two spans, 64.1 feet and 81.10 feet, with a 3.2 feet gap between them. The combined trussed portions of the bridge are 149.1 feet long. The bridge's Town lattice is an unusual design choice, but the later addition of the queen trusses are also unusual, resulting in a unique visual appearance by the bridge's unequal spans. This gives the appearance of kingposts within the queenposts. Since {{the addition of the}} steel <b>I-beam</b> flooring in 1973, the trusses have supported nothing but themselves. The State of Connecticut's lists the bridge as CT 1338 and the May 2012 inspection of the bridge found the deck and superstructure conditions to be satisfactory and condition of the substructure to be fair. The West Cornwall Covered bridge has been appraised as functionally obsolete.|$|E
5|$|The Grand Street Bridge {{opened for}} traffic in 1919, {{but had to}} be closed in 1932 after the {{southeast}} pier was excessively settled. The Connecticut Highway Department and federal government provided the funds required to remove the bascule leaves and replace the pier in 1936. As {{a part of the}} renovations, a new floor and electrical system were installed. In 1965, the bridge floor was replaced with steel grating atop 14-inch (36-cm) <b>I-beam</b> stringers. In 1984, the eastern approach span and northwest trunnion post, the point where the bridge pivots, were reconstructed as part of what would be the bridge's last major renovations. Other minor repairs to the bridge's steel and masonry were done during the project. The bridge was closed in the 1990s and it was dismantled in 1999. In 2010, the United States Coast Guard struck the rule pertaining to the operation of the bridge due to its removal. Previously, the rule stated that the bridge need not open for the passage of vessels.|$|E
5|$|The Grand Street Bridge was a {{double-leaf}} deck-girder {{bascule bridge}} in Bridgeport, Connecticut, United States, that spanned the Pequonnock River and connected Grand Street and Artic Street. It {{was one of}} three movable bridges planned by the City of Bridgeport in 1916 {{at the request of the}} War Department during World War I. Construction was completed in 1919, but the delays surrounding the construction went to the Connecticut Supreme Court in case of Edward DeV. Tompkins, Inc. vs. City of Bridgeport, Connecticut. The court ruled in favor of Tompkins and awarded damages equal to the contract. In 1936, the bridge had excessive settling and required the replacement of its southeast pier. As part of the repairs, a new floor and electrical system were installed. In 1965, the floor was replaced with a steel grate on <b>I-beam</b> floor. In 1984, the eastern approach span was replaced and the northwest trunnion post was reconstructed. The bridge was closed in the 1990s and dismantled in 1999.|$|E

It was found that the moment modification factors of double symmetric <b>I-beams</b> presently used in design formulas to predict the buckling capacities of monosymmetric <b>I-beams</b> could be unsafe. Consequently, alternative simple approximate formulas are derived from the energy method, based on the study of the buckled mode shapes of monosymmetric <b>I-beams.</b> The proposed formulas retain the familiar form of the well-known solution of beams under uniform moment.

25|$|Modern track {{typically}} uses hot-rolled steel with {{a profile}} of an asymmetrical rounded <b>I-beam.</b> Unlike some other uses of iron and steel, railway rails are subject to very high stresses {{and have to be}} made of very high-quality steel alloy.

The stronger the rails and the rest of the trackwork, the heavier and faster the trains the track can carry.|$|E
25|$|A truss can {{be thought}} of as a beam where the web {{consists}} of a series of separate members instead of a continuous plate. In the truss, the lower horizontal member (the bottom chord) and the upper horizontal member (the top chord) carry tension and compression, fulfilling the same function as the flanges of an <b>I-beam.</b> Which chord carries tension and which carries compression depends on the overall direction of bending. In the truss pictured above right, the bottom chord is in tension, and the top chord in compression.|$|E
25|$|Conversion to an AGT {{system was}} {{relatively}} straightforward. The steel wheels were replaced with rubber ones, which ran {{in a narrow}} concrete guideway structure instead of the <b>I-beam</b> rails. The guideway was roughly {{the size and shape}} of a pedestrian sidewalk, with short vertical extension on either side to form a U-shape. Small horizontal wheels at the front of the cars pressed against the vertical sections and guided the main wheels around corners. Power was provided via a third rail system attached to the top of the right vertical extension (as seen in the direction of travel).|$|E

25|$|Another {{example of}} the Bf 109's {{advanced}} design {{was the use of}} a single, <b>I-beam</b> main spar in the wing, positioned more aft than usual (to give enough room for the retracted wheel), thus forming a stiff D-shaped torsion box. Most aircraft of the era used two spars, near the front and rear edges of the wings, but the D-box was much stiffer torsionally, and eliminated the need for the rear spar. The wing profile was the NACA 2R1 14.2 at the root and NACA 2R1 11.35 at the tip, with a thickness to chord ratio of 14.2% at the root and 11.35% at the tip.|$|E
25|$|The bridges in Fulton County exhibit {{two types}} of steel truss bridge construction, Pratt bridge and Parker, which were the most common early types of steel truss bridges. Due to {{variation}} within each type of bridge, the collection in Fulton County offered {{a unique opportunity to}} view the evolution of late 19th and early 20th century steel truss bridge construction. For example, the now-demolished London Mills Bridge, a Pratt built in 1883, features pinned connection and double eyebars for the lower chord and for the diagonals. This is compared to the also destroyed Indian Ford Bridge, a Pratt bridge built in 1917, which used riveted connections and <b>I-beam</b> construction for its lower chords and diagonals.|$|E
25|$|The French Nieuport 11 {{and later}} on, the Nieuport 17 and the British Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5 aircraft, the Lewis was mounted above the top wing, {{sometimes}} on a Foster mount, which allowed firing directly forward outside the propeller arc. The Foster mount usually incorporated an arc-shaped <b>I-beam</b> rail as its rearmost structural member, that a Lewis gun could be slid backwards and downwards along the rail towards the cockpit, {{to allow the}} ammunition drum to be changed in flight — but fighter ace Albert Ball V.C. also understood that the Lewis gun in such a mount also retained its original trigger, and could thus be fired upwards. He used the upward firing Lewis to attack solitary German two-seater aircraft from below and behind, where the observer could not see him or fire back. It was {{his use of the}} weapon in this way, in a Nieuport, that led to its later introduction on the S.E.5/S.E.5a. Ball had acted in a consultant capacity on the development of this aeroplane. The later Sopwith Dolphin, already armed with twin synchronized Vickers guns just forward of the pilot and just above its V-8 engine, could also use one or two Lewis guns mounted on the forward crossbar of its cabane structure, between the top wing panels, as an anti-Zeppelin measure.|$|E

500|$|This myth {{was derived}} from two misconceptions: First, that tornadoes always travel in a northeasterly direction, and second, that debris from a {{structure}} will be carried away {{in the direction of}} the tornado's propagation, leaving anyone taking shelter on the side of the structure facing the tornado's approach unharmed. The seriousness of these misconceptions began to be revealed in the 1960s and 1970s, when surveys of major tornado damage in residential areas showed that the section of a house {{in the direction of the}} tornado's approach is actually the [...] safe. Additionally, many tornadoes have traveled in directions other than northeasterly, including the Jarrell Tornado (F5 on the Fujita scale), which moved south-southwesterly. Because determining a tornado's direction of approach can take time away from seeking shelter, official advice is to seek shelter in an interior room on the lowest floor of a building, under a staircase, <b>I-beam,</b> or sturdy piece of furniture if possible.|$|E
500|$|This {{underground}} station has two tracks and one island platform. Both track walls have a lime green trim {{line with a}} medium Kelly green border. Small [...] "205" [...] signs are placed below them at regular intervals. The platform has a row of concrete-clad <b>I-beam</b> columns on both sides; these are painted medium Hunter green. There is clear evidence of water damage and mold due to poor drainage in numerous areas along the platform ceiling, the wall tiles, and {{to a number of}} the support columns. The station is also notorious for having piles of trash bags on the platform and at entrances, as well as for large amounts of litter on the tracks due to an absence of trash cans. 205th Street station was declared one of the five worst in the system in terms of maintenance and appearance by the New York City Transit Riders Council in 2005, problems which have persisted into the 2010s.|$|E
500|$|Post-war {{analysis}} by the U.S. Naval Technical Mission to Japan noted that Shinano had serious design flaws. Specifically, the joint between the waterline armor belt on the upper hull and the anti-torpedo bulge on the underwater portion was poorly designed, a trait shared by the Yamato-class battleships; Archerfishs torpedoes all exploded along this joint. The force of the torpedo explosions also dislodged an <b>I-beam</b> {{in one of the}} boiler rooms which punched a hole into another boiler room. In addition, the failure to test for water-tightness in each compartment played a role as potential leaks could not be found and patched before Shinano put to sea. The executive officer blamed the large amount of water that entered the ship on the failure to air-test the compartments for leaks. [...] He reported hearing air rushing through gaps in the water-tight doors just minutes after the last torpedo hit—a sign that seawater was rapidly entering the ship, proving the doors were unseaworthy.|$|E
