50|$|A <b>Flinders</b> <b>bar</b> is a {{vertical}} soft iron bar {{placed in a}} tube on the fore side of a compass binnacle. The <b>Flinders</b> <b>bar</b> is used to counteract the vertical magnetism inherent within a ship and is usually calibrated {{as part of the}} process known as swinging the compass, where deviations caused by this inherent magnetism are negated by the use of horizontal (or quadrantal) correctors.|$|E
50|$|Where the {{deviation}} from a compass point cannot be counteracted {{through the use}} of <b>Flinders</b> <b>bar,</b> Kelvin's balls, Heeling error magnets and Horizontal magnets, a deviation card, or graph, is produced. This card, or graph, lists {{the deviation}} for various compass courses and is referred to by the navigator when compass courses need to be corrected.|$|E
50|$|The complex {{features}} a central LED pillar and interactive floor which is prominent next to BAR36. The bar hosts free live entertainment 6 {{nights a week}} and serves food from 4pm-8pm every night. The Reef Hotel Casino also houses the Merchant Artisan Food & Coffee cafe plus four restaurants: Tamarind, Caf√© China Noodle Bar (in the former Cairns Customs House), Cafe China Restaurant and <b>Flinders</b> <b>Bar</b> & Grill. It also hosts the Cairns Zoom & Wildlife Dome on the rooftop.|$|E
50|$|Flinders' {{proposal}} {{for the use of}} iron bars to be used to compensate for the magnetic deviations caused by iron on board a ship resulted in them being known as <b>Flinders</b> <b>bars.</b>|$|R
50|$|Guglielmino's tour {{to launch}} the record {{included}} a notable show where he supported Brian Chase from the Yeah Yeah Yeahs at <b>Flinders</b> <b>Bar</b> in Sydney. He also recorded a live track with the renowned Australian musician Kate Miller-Heidke for the web program 'Press Record'. At {{the end of his}} 2012 tour it was announced that Edward Guglielmino had been shortlisted for the prestigious Grant McLennan Fellowship. In December 2012 Sunshine State was listen {{as one of the top}} ten records from Queensland in 2012 by Noel Mengel in the Courier Mail.|$|E
50|$|At his suggestion, in 1810 the Admiralty {{established}} a School of Naval Architecture; the Admiralty also appointed Inman its first Principal. In 1812 he conducted experiments with Flinders {{which led to}} the invention of the <b>Flinders</b> <b>Bar,</b> used for marine compass correction. At the same time as teaching in the school and publishing mathematical texts for the use of his pupils, he translated a French text on the architecture of shipbuilding, and continued his own studies, gaining his doctorate in Divinity in 1820. In recognition of his work in nautical astronomy he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society.|$|E
