40|$|The Authenticated Tracking and Monitoring System (ATMS) {{answers the}} need for global {{monitoring}} of the status and location of sensitive items on a worldwide basis, 24 hours a day. The ATMS concept uses wireless sensor packs to monitor {{the status of the}} items and environmental conditions, to collect a variety of sensor event data, and to transmit the data through the INMARSAT satellite communication system, which then sends that data to appropriate ground stations for tracking and monitoring. Authentication and encryption algorithms are used throughout the system to secure the data during communication activities. A typical ATMS application would be to track and monitor the safety and security of a number of <b>items</b> <b>in</b> <b>transit</b> along a scheduled shipping route. The resulting tracking, timing, and status information could then be processed to ensure compliance with various agreements...|$|R

The resulting tracking, timing, and status information could then be processed to ensure compliance with various agreements. Following discussions between the Australian Safeguards Office (ASO), the US Department of Energy (DOE), and Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) in early 1995, the parties mutually agreed to conduct and evaluate a field trial prototype ATMS to track and monitor shipments of uranium ore concentrate (UOC) from an operating uranium mine in Australia to a final destination in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, with numerous stops along the way. During the months of February and March 1998, the trial was conducted on a worldwide basis, with tracking and monitoring stations located at sites in both Australia and the US. This paper describes ATMS and the trial...|$|R
30|$|Sensors {{are used}} in many {{different}} ways. These range from the real-time monitoring of water quality in oceans through sensors connected to buoys that send information over general packet radio services (GPRS) networks, to monitoring goods being shipped around the world, and smart power grids that create conditions for more rational planning and consumption in production processes, and can all be achieved by means of microchips implanted in objects that communicate with each other. Retailers can tag individual objects using radio frequency identifiers (RFID) to solve {{a number of problems}} all at once. Examples of the areas of application include accurate inventories, control of losses and unattended walk-through point-of-sale terminals. Warehouses can become fully automatic, with <b>items</b> being checked <b>in</b> and out and orders automatically passed to suppliers. <b>Items</b> <b>in</b> <b>transit</b> make intelligent decisions about their routing based on information received from readers and positioning systems. Weather forecasting infrastructure can work with in-ground sensors and irrigation-control software. Irrigation systems can be activated on the basis of intelligent decisions involving the level of moisture in the soil and the likelihood of precipitations. Roadside sensors can detect the flow of cars with RFID-based automatic motorway toll payment tags and provide traffic reports. All sorts of things can give their location to their owners, including keys, wallets, glasses, jewellery and tools. Some IoT-type applications are not new. Among these are toll payment tags, security access key cards, devices to track stolen cars and various types of identity tags for retail goods and livestock.|$|R
