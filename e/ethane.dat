A number of new compounds have been reported and a number of older syntheses have been improved. In general, it has been found that benzene, alkyland alkoxyl-substituted benzenes give satisfactory yields of <b>ethanes,</b> whereas the more reactive phenols, amines, and heterocyclic compounds give only resinous products, and the less reactive halogenated benzenes, nitrobenzene, benzoic acid, and fused-ring aromatics fail to react.

5|$|Makemake (minor-planet {{designation}} 136472 Makemake) is a dwarf {{planet and}} perhaps the largest Kuiper belt object in the classical population, with a diameter approximately two thirds that of Pluto. Makemake has one known satellite, S/2015 (136472) 1. Makemake's extremely low average temperature, about , means its surface is covered with methane, <b>ethane,</b> and possibly nitrogen ices.|$|E
5|$|Neptune's spectra {{suggest that}} its lower {{stratosphere}} is hazy due to condensation of products of ultraviolet photolysis of methane, such as <b>ethane</b> and ethyne. The stratosphere {{is also home}} to trace amounts of carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide. The stratosphere of Neptune is warmer than that of Uranus due to the elevated concentration of hydrocarbons.|$|E
5|$|All {{living things}} on Earth (including methanogens) use liquid {{water as a}} solvent; it is speculated that life on Titan might instead use a liquid hydrocarbon, such as methane or <b>ethane.</b> Water is a {{stronger}} solvent than methane. Water is also more chemically reactive, and can break down large organic molecules through hydrolysis. A life-form whose solvent was a hydrocarbon would not face the risk of its biomolecules being destroyed in this way.|$|E
40|$|The {{relative}} ground-state {{energies of}} the rotational isomers of some halogenated <b>ethanes</b> and the rates and barriers to interconversions of these isomers have been determined by {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} spectroscopy. In the <b>ethanes</b> studied in this research, those with a single fluorine {{were found to have}} the ^(19) F resonance of the least populated conformation at highest field, while that of the most populated conformation was found at the lowest field. All three barriers for interconversion could be determined for the <b>ethanes</b> substituted so as to give three distinguishable conformations. For these cases {{it was found that the}} highest barrier separates the two least populated conformations and the lowest barrier separates the most stable conformations. The substances for which complete nmr line-shape analysis have given the equilibrium constants, rates, and barriers for internal rotation include 1, 1, 2 -tribromo- 1, 2 -dichloro- 2 -fluoroethane, 1, 1 - dibromo- 1, 2, 2 -trichloro- 2 -fluoroethane, 1 -bromo- 1, 1, 2, 2 -tetrachloro- 2 -fluoroethane, 1, 1, 2, 2 -tetrabromo- 1 -chloro- 2 -fluoroethane, 1, 2 -dibromo- 1, 1, 2 -trichloro- 2 -fluoroethane, 1, 1, 2 -tribromo- 1 -chloro- 2 -fluoroethane, 1 -bromo-l, 1, 2 -trichloro- 2 -fluoroethanaen,d 1, 2 -dibromo- 1, 1, 24 richloro- 3, 3, 3 -trifluoropropane. For those <b>ethanes</b> carrying five halogens other than fluorine, the barriers (to rotation) range from 13. 2 to 14. 8 kcal/mol, while for those with four halogens other than fluorine, the barriers range from 9. 0 to 10. 2 kcal/mol. The ground-state energy differences for all of the <b>ethanes</b> studied did not exceed 0. 3 kcal/mol...|$|R
25|$|Because {{halogenated}} <b>ethanes</b> can undergo further {{free radical}} halogenation, this process {{results in a}} mixture of several halogenated products. In the chemical industry, more selective chemical reactions are used for the production of any particular two-carbon haloalkane.|$|R

[...] The selectivity ratio S3(CH2)9/S6(CH2)18 is 6.0 for Os4(CO)12 and 1.5 for W(CO)6, rationalized by greater steric effects in the Os cluster, leading to a preference for the smaller ring product.|$|R
5|$|Astronomers hypothesized, {{based on}} its {{interior}} chemistry, that the comet formed in the Uranus and Neptune Oort cloud region of the Solar System. A comet which forms farther from the Sun {{is expected to have}} greater amounts of ices with low freezing temperatures, such as <b>ethane,</b> which was present in Tempel 1.

5|$|In June 2008, the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer on Cassini {{confirmed}} {{the presence of}} liquid <b>ethane</b> beyond doubt in Ontario Lacus. On December 21, 2008, Cassini passed directly over Ontario Lacus and observed specular reflection in radar. The strength of the reflection saturated the probe's receiver, indicating that the lake level did not vary by more than 3mm (implying either that surface winds were minimal, or the lake's hydrocarbon fluid is viscous).|$|E
5|$|Trace {{amounts of}} ammonia, acetylene, <b>ethane,</b> propane, {{phosphine}} and methane {{have been detected}} in Saturn's atmosphere. The upper clouds are composed of ammonia crystals, while the lower level clouds appear to consist of either ammonium hydrosulfide (NH4SH) or water. Ultraviolet radiation from the Sun causes methane photolysis in the upper atmosphere, leading {{to a series of}} hydrocarbon chemical reactions with the resulting products being carried downward by eddies and diffusion. This photochemical cycle is modulated by Saturn's annual seasonal cycle.|$|E
40|$|Heat-activated persulfate {{oxidative}} {{treatment of}} chlorinated organic solvents containing chlorinated ethenes and <b>ethanes</b> in soil was investigated with different persulfate dosages (20 [*]g/L, 40 [*]g/L, and 60 [*]g/L) and different temperatures (30 °C, 40 °C, and 50 °C). Chlorinated organic solvents removal was increased as persulfate concentration increase. The persulfate dosage of 20 [*]g/L {{with the highest}} OE (oxidant efficiency) value was economically suitable for chlorinated organic solvents removal. The increasing temperature contributed to the increasing depletion of chlorinated organic solvents.

50|$|Chlorination is {{generally}} highly exothermic. Both saturated and unsaturated compounds react directly with chlorine, the former usually requiring UV light to initiate homolysis of chlorine.

5|$|Clouds {{typically}} cover 1% of Titan's disk, though outburst {{events have}} been observed in which the cloud cover rapidly expands {{to as much as}} 8%. One hypothesis asserts that the southern clouds are formed when heightened levels of sunlight during the southern summer generate uplift in the atmosphere, resulting in convection. This explanation is {{complicated by the fact that}} cloud formation has been observed not only after the southern summer solstice but also during mid-spring. Increased methane humidity at the south pole possibly contributes to the rapid increases in cloud size. It was summer in Titan's southern hemisphere until 2010, when Saturn's orbit, which governs Titan's motion, moved Titan's northern hemisphere into the sunlight. When the seasons switch, it is expected that <b>ethane</b> will begin to condense over the south pole.|$|E
5|$|Spectral {{analysis}} of Makemake's surface revealed that methane must {{be present in}} the form of large grains at least one centimetre in size. In addition to methane, large amounts of <b>ethane</b> and tholins as well as smaller amounts of ethylene, acetylene and high-mass alkanes (like propane) may be present, most likely created by photolysis of methane by solar radiation. The tholins are probably responsible for the red color of the visible spectrum. Although evidence exists for the presence of nitrogen ice on its surface, at least mixed with other ices, there is nowhere near the same level of nitrogen as on Pluto and Triton, where it composes more than 98percent of the crust. The relative lack of nitrogen ice suggests that its supply of nitrogen has somehow been depleted over the age of the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|The {{surface of}} the nucleus is {{generally}} dry, dusty or rocky, suggesting that the ices are hidden beneath a surface crust several metres thick. In addition to the gases already mentioned, the nuclei contain a variety of organic compounds, which may include methanol, hydrogen cyanide, formaldehyde, ethanol, and <b>ethane</b> and perhaps more complex molecules such as long-chain hydrocarbons and amino acids. In 2009, {{it was confirmed that}} the amino acid glycine had been found in the comet dust recovered by NASA's Stardust mission. In August 2011, a report, based on NASA studies of meteorites found on Earth, was published suggesting DNA and RNA components (adenine, guanine, and related organic molecules) may have been formed on asteroids and comets.|$|E

5|$|A lake (from Latin lacus) is a terrain feature (or {{physical}} feature), a body {{of liquid}} {{on the surface of}} a world that is localized to the bottom of basin (another type of landform or terrain feature; that is, it is not global) and moves slowly if it moves at all. On Earth, {{a body of}} water is considered a lake when it is inland, not part of the ocean, is larger and deeper than a pond, and is fed by a river. The only world other than Earth known to harbor lakes is Titan, Saturn's largest moon, which has lakes of <b>ethane,</b> most likely mixed with methane. It is not known if Titan's lakes are fed by rivers, though Titan's surface is carved by numerous river beds. Natural lakes on Earth are generally found in mountainous areas, rift zones, and areas with ongoing or recent glaciation. Other lakes are found in endorheic basins or along the courses of mature rivers. In some parts of the world, there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last Ice Age. All lakes are temporary over geologic time scales, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{detailed}} analysis of KBOs was impossible, and so astronomers were only able to determine the most basic facts about their makeup, primarily their color. These first data showed {{a broad range of}} colors among KBOs, ranging from neutral grey to deep red. This suggested that their surfaces were composed {{of a wide range of}} compounds, from dirty ices to hydrocarbons. This diversity was startling, as astronomers had expected KBOs to be uniformly dark, having lost most of the volatile ices from their surfaces to the effects of cosmic rays. Various solutions were suggested for this discrepancy, including resurfacing by impacts or outgassing. Jewitt and Luu's spectral analysis of the known Kuiper belt objects in 2001 found that the variation in color was too extreme to be easily explained by random impacts. The radiation from the Sun is thought to have chemically altered methane on the surface of KBOs, producing products such as tholins. Makemake has been shown to possess a number of hydrocarbons derived from the radiation-processing of methane, including <b>ethane,</b> ethylene and acetylene.|$|E
25|$|After methane, <b>ethane</b> is {{the second-largest}} {{component}} of natural gas. Natural gas from different gas fields varies in <b>ethane</b> content {{from less than}} 1% to more than 6% by volume. Prior to the 1960s, <b>ethane</b> and larger molecules were typically not separated from the methane component of natural gas, but simply burnt along with the methane as a fuel. Today, <b>ethane</b> is an important petrochemical feedstock and is separated from the other components of natural gas in most well-developed gas fields. <b>Ethane</b> can also be separated from petroleum gas, a mixture of gaseous hydrocarbons produced as a byproduct of petroleum refining. Economics of building and running processing plants can change, however. If the relative value of sending the unprocessed natural gas to a consumer exceeds the value of extracting <b>ethane,</b> <b>ethane</b> extraction might not be run, which could cause operational issues managing the changing quality of the gas in downstream systems.|$|E

40|$|The {{microbial}} degradation of chlorinated and nonchlorinated methanes, <b>ethanes,</b> and <b>ethanes</b> by a mixed methane-oxidizing culture grown under chemostat and batch conditions is evaluated and {{compared with that}} by two pure methanotrophic strains: CAC 1 (isolated from the mixed culture) and Methylosinus trichosporium OB 3 b. With the exception of 1, 1 -dichloroethylene, the transformation capacity (Tc) for each chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbon was generally found to be in inverse proportion to its chlorine content within each aliphatic group (i. e., methanes, <b>ethanes,</b> and ethenes), whereas similar trends were not observed for degradation rate constants. Tc trends were similar for all methane-oxidizing cultures tested. None of the cultures were able to degrade the fully chlorinated aliphatics such as perchloroethylene and carbon tetrachloride. Of the four cultures tested, the chemostat-grown mixed culture exhibited the highest Tc for trichloroethylene, cis- 1, 2 -dichloroethylene, tetrachloroethane, 1, 1, 1 -trichloroethane, and 1, 2 -dichloroethane, whereas the pure batch-grown OB 3 b culture exhibited the highest Tc for all other compounds tested. The product toxicity of chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons in a mixture containing multiple compounds was cumulative and predictable when using parameters measured from the degradation of individual compounds. The Tc for each chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbon in a mixture (Tcmix) and the total Tc for the mixture (sigma Tcmix) are functions of the individual Tc, the initial substrate concentration (S 0), and the first-order rate constant (k/Ks) of each compound in the mixture, indicating the importance of identifying the properties and compositions of all potentially degradable compounds in a contaminant mixture...|$|R
