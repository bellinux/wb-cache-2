One Gaussian was introduced to <b>fit</b> the <b>S</b> 1 signal; its relative intensity decreased with the decrease of the NPs concentration. Two Gaussians (the low-field and high-field components) were used to describe S 2 signal and its shift toward higher magnetic field, in particular, this shift was modeled by diminishing of the low-field component contribution.

40|$|R. (Martin) v Mahony, a {{decision}} of the Irish High Court of 1910, continues to be acknowledged by modern textbook writers as a leading authority for the classical rule that certiorari could not correct error of law. This rule, which considerably reduced judicial superintendence of magistrates 2 ̆ 7 courts, had been established by the English court of Queen 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Bench</b> in the 1840 s. However, the rule was repudiated by the Exchequer Division in Ireland in the late 1880 s, which developed a novel, liberal theory of certiorari. This doctrinal innovation, which was used in overturning convictions under the anti-boycotting statute, the Criminal Law and Procedure Act 1887, appalled sections of Lord Salisbury 2 ̆ 7 s government, was disapproved of by the English courts, and split the Irish judiciary. The division caused by the doctrine persisted until 1910 when the Irish High Court, having assembled in banc in Martin 2 ̆ 7 s Case in order to resolve the impasse, re-established orthodox English doctrine...|$|R

40|$|This article takes a {{fresh look}} at the {{increasingly}} discussed topic of the scarcity of civil cases reaching trial in the Article III system.

They also apply economic analysis to the present flight from jury trials to ADR, examining the role of jury verdicts in the economics of forum choice, especially as relates to the 2 ̆ 2 verdict bubble, 2 ̆ 2 i. e., the perception engendered by reports of high-end verdicts. The authors conclude by suggesting that the federal courts might increase the attractiveness of the jury trial option by offering the possibility of a 2 ̆ 2 select 2 ̆ 2 jury in the appropriate case, with, for example, a venire specially qualified by education or experience in complex or technical cases, for which there is historical precedent...|$|R
40|$|I {{write this}} after re-reading Steven M Wise 2 ̆ 7 s Though the Heavens May Fall. My argument, if convincing, {{undermines}} {{the basis of}} the book. Probably the most famous decision in English law is that of Lord Mansfield in Somerset v. Stewart in 1772. It is very short and very dramatic; indeed, it is so rhetorical that much of what is vital is overlooked [...] as it was meant to be. Somerset was Stewart 2 ̆ 7 s slave in Virginia and was brought to England by his owner. Somerset travelled extensively in the service of his master, to Bristol and Edinburgh, for example. But two years after they left America, Somerset left Stewart. Stewart was incensed by Somerset 2 ̆ 7 s ingratitude and advertised for his return. Somerset was captured by slave-catchers and, on Stewart 2 ̆ 7 s orders, was put on the Ann and Mary bound for Jamaica [...] virtually a death sentence for Somerset. On request from Somerset 2 ̆ 7 s friends, Lord Mansfield issued a writ of habeas corpus to the ship 2 ̆ 7 s captain, and Somerset was removed from the ship and placed under the authority of the Court of King 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Bench.</b> The case of Somerset v Stewart was heard in the Court of King 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Bench</b> before Mansfield on 14 May 1772. Mansfield 2 ̆ 7 s judgment opens by stating: 2 ̆ 7 The question is, if the owner has a right to detain the slave, for the sending him over to be sold in Jamaica 2 ̆ 7. The issue as so expressed is a very narrow one. On the face of it, the issue is not whether Somerset is free or not. Even less is it a declaration {{that there can be no}} slaves in England. As Wise puts it, 2 ̆ 7 Somerset was Mansfield 2 ̆ 7 s minimum antislavery position 2 ̆ 7. His decision was understood as meaning that in his view there could be no slaves in England. But, in subsequent correspondence, Mansfield rote 2 ̆ 7 nothing more was then determined, that that there was no right in the master forcibly to take the salve and carry him abroad 2 ̆ 7. Again, he insisted that he had gone 2 ̆ 7 no further than to determine the master had no right to compel the slave to go into a foreign country 2 ̆ 7. I believe that the correspondence, obfuscating as it is, gives his true position on the case. Mansfield is 2 ̆ 7 hiding the ball 2 ̆ 7, as he should...|$|R

It is contended, on the other hand, that the coroner is a judicial officer of very ancient authority, that his jurisdiction has been most beneficially exercised, and that by means of his tribunal crimes which would otherwise be concealed or be compromised, are dragged into light.
