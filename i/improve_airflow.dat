5|$|Some teams {{modified}} {{their cars}} {{in preparation for}} the event. Red Bull and Williams revised their brake ducts. Williams team changed their brake ducts at the front to <b>improve</b> <b>airflow</b> inside the tyres and direct the duct towards their car's central section more efficiently. Red Bull's brake ducts, which had been changed for the third consecutive Grand Prix, reintroduced a small fin seen at the Singapore Grand Prix; for Korea two aerodynamic fins were fitted and a larger duct was introduced. McLaren modified a version of their front wings first introduced in Singapore. The team added a vertical gurney flap and an additional vertical slot at the front wing endplate to <b>improve</b> <b>airflow</b> outside the front tyres and increase the amount of downforce and therefore grip produced by the bodywork. The team also brought a new rear wing and tested a new revision of their F-duct system that débuted at the Japanese Grand Prix in Suzuka. Ferrari revised their diffuser with curved profiles and one large middle plate designed to improve the extraction of air {{from the bottom of the}} F10. As in Suzuka, Toro Rosso ran an F-duct system in the Friday practice sessions.|$|E
5|$|The station's {{architecture}} is an austere combination {{of concrete and}} stainless steel, with stacked banks of escalators supported from the cross-bracing structures spanning the station box and routes for passengers entering or leaving the station separated from those changing between lines. As with the other underground stations on the extension, the Jubilee line platforms feature platform screen doors to <b>improve</b> <b>airflow</b> through the system and increase safety. The station design won a number of awards including Civic Trust awards in 2000 and 2002, the Royal Fine Art Commission Millennium Building of the Year award in 2000 and the RIBA Award for Architecture in 2001. Both projects were jointly short-listed in 2001 for the RIBA's prestigious Stirling Prize.|$|E
25|$|During warm, still days, the {{building}} relies {{mostly on the}} stack effect while air is taken from the shady north side of {{the building}}. Low-energy fans in the tops of the stacks {{can also be used to}} <b>improve</b> <b>airflow.</b>|$|E

500|$|With Spain {{being the}} first race in Western Europe, and a mid-season test {{coming up after the}} race, many teams {{introduced}} their first major car updates for the Grand Prix. Mercedes ran a new front wing with a [...] "more pointy" [...] nose during first free practice. Other changes were made to the engine cover and the rear wing. McLaren made more significant changes to their MP4-31, most notably on the front wing, which Sky Sports commentator Ted Kravitz called the [...] "most intricate front wing I've ever seen". Force India updated their VJM09 to <b>improve</b> <b>airflow.</b> According to the team, they were looking for improved driveability rather than faster lap times. Renault introduced a new chassis for Jolyon Palmer. More significantly, the French manufacturer debuted a new version of their power unit for both their works team and Red Bull at the two-day test following the race. All other teams except for Sauber also made changes to their cars, with the Swiss team continuing their financial struggles. They also announced that they would be forced to miss the mid-season test, being unable to field a development driver, with regulations demanding that two out of four test days be driven by young driver talents.|$|E
2500|$|The {{oil cooler}} was housed with the coolant {{radiator}} {{in a big}} airscoop {{on top of the}} engine cowling, closer to the cockpit than was the case on the Il-2. The gunner's position was enclosed in the armored shell, unlike that in the Il-2, and was equipped with a [...] Berezin UBK machine gun on a VU-8 flexible mount. Otherwise the gun armament was identical to the older aircraft with a pair of [...] VYa cannon with a total 300 rounds and a pair of [...] ShKAS machine guns with 1500 rounds in the wings. Optionally two [...] Nudelman-Suranov NS-37s could be installed instead of the VYa-23 cannon. The rear fuselage was lengthened by [...] to <b>improve</b> <b>airflow</b> and the landing gear was lengthened to accommodate the larger propeller. The landing gear nacelles were modified accordingly.|$|E
2500|$|The Skyline GT-R Nismo, {{identified}} by the model code suffix [...] "RA", was introduced on 22 February 1990 and attracted a premium of [...] over the standard car. It existed to homologate a number of changes related to performance, aerodynamics, weight-saving and reliability for Group A racing. Those rules required a production run of 500 units, under the [...] "Evolution" [...] special regulations, but an additional 60 were produced and held by Nissan to turn into race cars, giving a total production of 560 units. Aerodynamic changes include: two additional ducts in the front bumper and removal of the protective honeycomb mesh to <b>improve</b> <b>airflow</b> to the intercooler, a bonnet lip spoiler to direct more air into the engine bay, deeper rear spats, and an additional boot lip spoiler to provide more downforce. The Nismo specification deletes ABS, which are not legal in Group A, and the rear wiper to save weight. The bonnet and front bumpers are aluminium rather than the standard steel, again to save weight. Overall the GT-R Nismo weighs 1400kg compared to 1430kg for the standard GT-R. Tyres are Bridgestone RE71 in 225/55R16 fitted to 16" [...] alloys. Mechanically the GT-R Nismo uses the RB26 engine of the 'standard' GT-R but replaces the stock Garrett T03 turbos with larger T04B models, sacrificing the faster spin up of ceramic turbo wheels for the enhanced reliability of steel wheels. The GT-R Nismo was only available in colour code KH2 [...] "Gun Grey Metallic". Other minor, but noticeable, changes include a circular [...] "Nismo" [...] logo on the right-rear of the boot lip, lack of radio tuning controls on the dashboard console (since a radio was optional), and cross-drilled brake rotors. Nismo-branded options available included a 260km/h speedo, 3" [...] cat-back exhaust system, front suspension tower brace, sports shock absorbers, 17" [...] alloy wheels, and a rear spoiler with built-in tail light.|$|E
50|$|Maybach's tubular {{honeycomb}} radiator featured a rectangular grill of 8,070 square shaped pipes of 6x6 mm, with <b>improved</b> <b>airflow.</b>|$|R
50|$|Another factor <b>improving</b> <b>airflow</b> is the {{gap between}} the tractor and trailer is {{minimized}} to lessen the amount of turbulence created by air flowing into the gap.|$|R
50|$|The new intake {{manifold}} greatly <b>improved</b> <b>airflow.</b> To meet emissions standards, an EGR tube was placedin the {{intake manifold}} to reduce combustion temperatures. The 3800 Series II {{was on the}} Ward's 10 Best Engines list for 1995 through 1997.|$|R

5000|$|Major {{design changes}} to the 4.3L V6 for the 1996 model year. Like other small block Chevrolet V8s, the 4.3L engine {{received}} redesigned heads which had <b>improved</b> <b>airflow</b> and combustion efficiency. These heads {{are referred to as}} Vortec heads.|$|R
50|$|A further {{advantage}} of the design is the heat-venting capacity of aerodynamically optimized mudflaps. The <b>improved</b> <b>airflow,</b> commonly engineered into high-performance automobiles, promotes the quick release of otherwise re-circulated water and air from the fenderwell while improving performance by cooling the tires and brakes.|$|R
30|$|We {{conclude}} that compared to corn oil, {{a combination of}} borage and echium seed oils <b>improves</b> <b>airflow</b> obstruction in mild to moderate asthmatics who carry the variant allele in the LTC 4 S gene (A- 444 C). Botanical oil supplementation may have therapeutic potential in asthma if used in a personalized manner.|$|R
5000|$|Physically, OU {{cabinets}} {{maintain the}} same 24" [...] external width as traditional server cabinets to maintain compatibility with existing server infrastructure. However, an OpenU is slightly taller, to <b>improve</b> <b>airflow</b> and cable management.|$|E

5000|$|Cooling was {{provided}} by a pumped water system. Maybach's tubular radiator, patented in 1897, known as a honeycomb radiator, was similar to [...] ones. Its rectangular grille had [...] pipes with a square cross section of 6 mm × 6 mm to <b>improve</b> <b>airflow,</b> and held 9 L of water. The airflow was assisted by a fan located behind the radiator.|$|E
50|$|The {{car body}} was {{developed}} using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) before the car ever saw a wind tunnel. Every {{area from the}} outer skin to the lightweight, composite undertray to the cooling airflow (even {{the shape of the}} exterior mirrors) was optimised using this process. The higher, squarer tail is more efficient aerodynamically than a lower, rounded one, and the XF's coupé-like roofline and raised bootlid lip <b>improve</b> <b>airflow</b> over the rear of the car.|$|E
5000|$|Aerodynamics: {{models have}} a {{redesigned}} front bumper skirt, {{which are more}} aerodynamic, and reduces drag further through use of a smaller lower grill.
