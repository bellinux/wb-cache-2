[...] Capitalizing on Ohno's fame, Alaska Airlines were his primary sponsor for the 2010 Winter Games and designed a Boeing 737–800 jet with his image on the side.|$|E

He reported as a correspondent to his Chinese readers that [...] "the average American is like a child; <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a new toy to play with, whether it is Radio City or a mahjong set, and like a child as well, he quickly tires of playing with it. The average American always has to have fun, and this fun is somewhat different from pleasure and even more different from true happiness".|$|E

2500|$|Josh Brolin as George W. Bush: Stone's {{original}} {{idea for the}} main role was to propose it to Harrison Ford, who he said had [...] "a pretty similar face as of George Bush". Stone then cast Christian Bale, who spent months researching for the role, but dropped out after he was {{not satisfied with the}} prosthetic makeup tests. Stone remarked, [...] "Christian's a very methodical actor and <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the makeup thing work for him." [...] Brolin, cast at the [...] "last minute", spent months working on Bush's distinctive vocal style, calling hotels in Texas and talking to the people at the front desk, listening to their accents. The actor also watched videos of Bush walking. Brolin said, [...] "It changes over the years, how he walks in his 30s, how he walks in foreign lands, before 9/11 and afterward. People hold their emotions in their bodies. They can't fake it. Especially him." ...|$|E
2500|$|In early October 2014, Kilbey {{explained}} that Willson-Piper was {{not asked to}} leave the band, {{but that he had}} simply not replied to the various attempts made to contact him (Willson-Piper had relocated to Sweden). Realizing that Willson-Piper would not respond, and in agreement with Powles at the time, [...] Kilbey said [...] "Yes, we have to find someone with stature. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> his own trip, he can’t be some weedy little guy coming in to play guitar. It has to be somebody with experience and gravitas." [...] As part of the same interview, Haug {{explained that}} he had {{received a phone call from}} Kilbey while he was returning home from a funeral. Without first greeting Haug, Kilbey simply asked, [...] "If I asked you to join The Church, what would you say?" [...] and ended the call after Haug's affirmative, but bewildered, response. Haug said that joining the Church was the [...] "last thing" [...] that would have entered his mind, but that [...] "it just really seemed to work".|$|E
2500|$|Pittsburgh got {{the ball}} back on their own 22-yard line with 2:37 {{left in the game}} and two timeouts remaining. On their first play, a holding penalty pushed them back 10 yards. Roethlisberger then {{completed}} a pass to Holmes for 14 yards. After an incompletion, Roethlisberger threw it to Holmes again for a first down. An 11-yard reception by Nate Washington followed, and a 4-yard run by Roethlisberger forced the Steelers to burn their first timeout. On the very next play, he completed a pass to Holmes, who took it 40 yards to the Cardinals' 6-yard line after safety Aaron Francisco fell down. Two plays later, Roethlisberger found Mewelde Moore covered in the flat, then Ward covered. He looked and then threw to Holmes, who ran a flag route in the right corner. Holmes caught the pass in the back corner of the end zone for a touchdown, managing to land with his toes inbounds before falling out of bounds. [...] "My feet never left the ground," [...] said Holmes. [...] "All I did was extend my arms and use my toes as an extension to catch up to the ball." [...] After a booth review, the touchdown pass stood. Reed's ensuing extra point put the Steelers in front 27–23 with 35 seconds remaining. Following the ensuing kickoff, Warner completed a 20-yard pass to Fitzgerald and a 13-yarder to J. J. Arrington, moving the ball to the Steelers 44. With 15 seconds left, Warner prepared to attempt a Hail Mary pass, but linebacker LaMarr Woodley forced a fumble while sacking Warner. Defensive end Brett Keisel recovered the fumble, giving the ball back to Pittsburgh with five seconds left. [...] Many viewers assumed that the play had not been reviewed for a possible incomplete pass, but NFL Head of Officiating Mike Pereira later explained that it actually was reviewed, unnoticed by the public: [...] "We confirmed it was a fumble. The replay assistant in the replay booth saw it was clearly a fumble. The ball got knocked loose and was rolling in his hand before it started forward. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> total control." [...] It was the first and only Super Bowl in which Warner was involved not to be decided on the final play of the game. Roethlisberger took a knee, securing the Steelers' sixth Super Bowl victory and surpassing the Dallas Cowboys and San Francisco 49ers to set a new NFL record for most Super Bowl wins by a team.|$|E

6000|$|Now, first, as to {{the impossibility}} of getting our great army into existence. All those people who write and talk so glibly in favour of {{conscription}} seem to forget that to take a common man, and more particularly a townsman, clap him into a uniform and put a rifle in his hand {{does not make a}} soldier. He has to be taught not only the use of his weapons, but the methods of a strange and unfamiliar life out of doors; he has to be not simply drilled, but accustomed to the difficult modern necessities of open order fighting, of taking cover, of entrenchment, and <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> created within him, so that it will stand the shock of seeing men killed round about him, confidence in himself, in his officers, and the methods and weapons of his side. Body, mind, and imagination have all to be trained--and they need trainers. The conversion of a thousand citizens into anything better than a sheep-like militia demands the enthusiastic services of scores of able and experienced instructors who know what war is; the creation of a universal army demands the services of many scores of thousands of not simply [...] "old soldiers," [...] but keen, expert, modern-minded officers.|$|E
