500|$|In Hibbett and colleagues' 1997 publication, Protomycena {{was placed}} in the {{subfamily}} Myceneae, which at the time was considered part of the Tricholomataceae family; Mycena is currently classified in the Mycenaceae family. The placement was based solely on the visible structures, or macromorphology of the fruit body. [...] Many of the features which are typically used to classify species into fungal families and subfamilies are based on microscopic features not visible or preserved in the amber specimen. Consequently, the assignment to Mycena is provisional (the authors also note certain similarities with extant members of Marasmius), and the describing authors leave open the option of treating the genus placement as incertae sedis (uncertain placement) within the Agaricales. Protomycena is distinct from other amber-preserved mushroom taxa such as Coprinites, in the <b>grooved</b> <b>surface</b> of its pileus and its [...] gills.|$|E
2500|$|However, the {{majority}} of scallops are free-living and can swim with brief bursts of speed to escape predators (mostly starfish) by rapidly opening and closing their valves. [...] Indeed, everything about their characteristic shell shape – its symmetry, narrowness, smooth and/ or <b>grooved</b> <b>surface,</b> small flexible hinge, powerful adductor muscle, and continuous and uniformly curved edge – facilitates such activity. They often do this in spurts of several seconds before closing the shell entirely and sinking back {{to the bottom of}} their environment. Scallops are able to move through the water column either forward/ ventrally (termed swimming) by sucking water in through the space between their valves, an area called the gape, and ejecting it through small holes near the hinge line called exhalant apertures, or backward/ dorsally (termed jumping) by ejecting the water out the same way it came in (i.e., ventrally). [...] A jumping scallop will usually land on the sea floor between each contraction of its valves, whereas a swimming scallop will stay in the water column for most or all of its contractions and will travel a much greater distance (though seldom at a height of more than one meter off the sea bed and seldom for a distance of greater than five meters). [...] Both jumping and swimming movements are very energy-intensive and most scallops cannot perform more than four or five in a row before becoming completely exhausted and requiring several hours of rest. Should a swimming scallop land on its left side, it is capable of flipping itself over to its right side via a similar shell-clapping movement called the righting reflex. So-called singing scallops are rumored to make an audible, soft popping sound as they flap their shells underwater (though whether or not this happens is open to some debate). [...] Other scallops can extend their foot from between their valves, and by contracting the muscles in their foot, they can burrow into sand.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigated}} the coalescence of two droplets on decimillimeter-scaled <b>grooved</b> <b>surfaces</b> {{by using a}} high-speed camera and compared the coalescence process of isometric/anisometric droplets on parallel/vertical <b>grooved</b> <b>surfaces.</b> During the experiment, a syringe needle was inserted {{from the bottom of}} the substrates in order to obtain a horizontal coalescence of a preplaced static droplet and a slowly growing quasi-static droplet. The results show that the whole coalescence process can be divided into the coalesce process and the oscillation process. When the droplets are isometric, on parallel <b>grooved</b> <b>surfaces,</b> due to the guiding effect of grooves, they oscillate sharply by the direction of grooves, accompanied by reciprocating contact line. On vertical <b>grooved</b> <b>surfaces,</b> limited by the energy barrier of vertical grooves, the oscillation of droplet is weaker and the contact line is almost fixed, while the vertical amplitude of oscillation is distinct. Different phenomena are observed when the droplets are anisometric: the smaller droplet is attracted to the other side, resulting in an asymmetrical coalescence process. Besides, the height of liquid bridge, the lasting time of coalescence and the length of contact line increase as the overall volume of the two droplets increases...|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} a numerical analysis and experimental study on condensation heat transfer and fluid flow for filmwise condensation on trapezoid <b>grooved</b> <b>surfaces.</b> First, a physical model was properly simplified {{based on some}} reasonable assumptions. Then, the coupled non-linear governing equations for the mass transfer, fluid flow, and two-dimensional thermal conduction were developed. The relationship between z-coordinate and heat transfer was obtained by solving the equations numerically. The influences of groove length and basic angle were discussed. The calculation {{results showed that the}} heat flux decreased with increase in groove length, and the decline range also decreased gradually. The calculation results also suggested that the heat flux through groove with α[*]=[*] 60 ° was lower than the groove with α[*]=[*] 75 ° {{at the top of the}} groove, while the opposite conclusion was obtained at the low parts. The distributions of wall temperature and heat flux on trapezoid groove were also studied systematically. The distribution of surface temperature and heat flux presents obvious lateral inhomogeneity, and the maximum wall temperature and heat flux were both obtained in region II. The thermal resistance of groove with α[*]=[*] 60 ° was lower but the liquid-discharged ability was better than that of groove with α[*]=[*] 75 °. In order to validate the feasibility and reliability of the present analyses and to further investigate the heat transfer performance of trapezoid <b>grooved</b> <b>surfaces,</b> experiments were carried out with three condensing plates including two trapezoid <b>grooved</b> <b>surfaces</b> in different physical dimensions and one smooth surface. The experimental data obtained under various schooling were compared with the calculations, and the experimental results for different condensing plates are all in good agreement with the numerical model, with a maximum deviation less than 15 %. Moreover, the trapezoid grooves can enhance the condensation heat transfer by 1. 5 – 2. 5 times higher than the smooth surface. The present analyses are feasible and can be used in the parameter design and heat transfer calculation of trapezoid <b>grooved</b> <b>surfaces...</b>|$|R

40|$|Measurements of {{the mean}} {{pressure}} distributions and Strouhal numbers on partially grooved cylinders with different groove subtend angles were made over a Reynolds number range of 2. 0 × 104 to 1. 3 × 105 which was within the subcritical regime of smooth cylinder.

In general, a progressive shift of the flow regime to lower Reynolds number was observed with higher subtend angle and a subtend angle of 75 deg was found for optimum drag reduction.

50|$|Runway {{conditions}} affect {{take off}} and landing performance of an aircraft. The runway may be made up of concrete, asphalt, gravel or grass. An important safety concern at airports is the contamination of the runways due to ice, snow, water, rubber deposits etc. The landing distance required by an aircraft is much more in case of low friction runways which do not facilitate effective braking to occur. Aquaplaning is a phenomenon in which directional control is lost {{because of the presence of}} film of water between the rubber tires and the runway surface. The construction of <b>grooved</b> <b>surface</b> runways and regular maintenance, especially rubber removal, both help reduce runway slipperiness and facilitate good ground handling and effective braking.|$|E
