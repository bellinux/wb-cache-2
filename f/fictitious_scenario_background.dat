40|$|AbstractCompared to adults, {{relatively}} {{little is known}} about autobiographical memory and the ability to imagine <b>fictitious</b> and future <b>scenarios</b> in school-aged children, despite the importance of these functions for development and subsequent independent living. Even less is understood about the effect of early hippocampal damage on children's memory and imagination abilities. To bridge this gap, we devised a novel naturalistic autobiographical memory task that enabled us to formally assess the memory for recent autobiographical experiences in healthy school-aged children. Contemporaneous with the autobiographical memories being formed, the children also imagined and described <b>fictitious</b> <b>scenarios.</b> Having established the performance of healthy school-aged children on these tasks, we proceeded to make comparisons with children (n= 21) who had experienced neonatal hypoxia/ischaemia, and consequent bilateral hippocampal damage. Our results showed that healthy children could recall autobiographical events, including spatiotemporal information and specific episodic details. By contrast, children who had experienced neonatal hypoxia/ischaemia had impaired recall, with the specific details of episodes being lost. Despite this significant memory deficit they were able to construct <b>fictitious</b> <b>scenarios.</b> This is in clear contrast to adults with hippocampal damage, who typically have impaired autobiographical memory and deficits in the construction of <b>fictitious</b> and future <b>scenarios.</b> We speculate that the paediatric patients’ relatively intact semantic memory and/or some functionality in their residual hippocampi may underpin their scene construction ability...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1994 There is a {{widespread}} problem with looting and vandalism of cultural resources in the Pacific Northwest. To combat this problem law enforcement must have {{the assistance of the}} archaeological community. To be able to assist law enforcement, archaeologists and cultural resource specialists must have the proper training in cultural resource law and crime prevention. The focus {{of this study is to}} investigate the preparedness of archaeologists and cultural resource specialists within the federal government, specifically the United State Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management, to assist in the investigation and prevention of cultural resource crime. To answer this question a survey was sent out to all of the aforementioned subjects within the Pacific Northwest. This survey asked for data concerning types of cultural resources affected by crime, prevention methods, training, opinions on quality of training, and demographic information. The respondent was also asked to reply to various <b>fictitious</b> <b>scenarios</b> concerning cultural resource crime, and the answers compared to a control group made up of law enforcement personnel. Information obtained from this survey showed that there is a lack of training among both of these agencies. A large percentage of the respondents feel that their training was either nonexistent or was lacking in depth and quality. The ability of the subject group to make decisions concerning the <b>fictitious</b> <b>scenarios</b> was closely analogous to those made by the law enforcement group. However, from information obtained from the respondents and from analysis of other data these scenarios may not have been a good indicator of the preparedness of the subject group. To improve their abilities at preventing and assisting in the investigation of cultural resource crimes, all archaeologists and cultural resource specialists need to have the opportunity to have access to quality training.

40|$|SummaryThe {{activities}} {{of the mind and}} brain never cease. Although many of our waking hours are spent processing sensory input and executing behavioral responses, moments of unoccupied rest free us to wander through thoughts of the past and future, create daydreams, and imagine <b>fictitious</b> <b>scenarios.</b> During sleep, when attention to sensory input is at a minimum, the mind continues to process information, using memory fragments to create the images, thoughts, and narratives that we commonly call ‘dreaming’. Far from being a random or meaningless distraction, spontaneous cognition during states of sleep and resting wakefulness appears to serve important functions related to processing past memories and planning for the future. From single-cell recordings in rodents to behavioral studies in humans, recent studies in the neurosciences suggest a new conception of dreaming as part of a continuum of adaptive cognitive processing occurring across the full range of mind/brain states...|$|R

30|$|For {{unmanned}} air vehicles (UAVs) {{to survive}} hostile operational environments, {{it is always}} preferable to utilize all wireless positioning sources available to fuse a robust position. While belief propagation is a well-established method for all source data fusion, {{it is not an}} easy job to handle all the mathematics therein. In this work, a comprehensive mathematical framework for belief propagation-based all-source positioning of UAVs is developed, taking wireless sources including Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) space vehicles, peer UAVs, ground control stations, and signal of opportunities. Based on the mathematical framework, a positioning algorithm named Belief propagation-based Opportunistic Positioning of UAVs (BOPU) is proposed, with an unscented particle filter for Bayesian approximation. The robustness of the proposed BOPU is evaluated by a <b>fictitious</b> <b>scenario</b> that a group of formation flying UAVs encounter GNSS countermeasures en route. Four different configurations of measurements availability are simulated. The results show that the performance of BOPU varies only slightly with different measurements availability.|$|R
40|$|Even {{when we are}} ostensibly {{doing nothing}} – as during states of rest, sleep, and reverie – the brain {{continues}} to process information. In resting wakefulness, the mind generates thoughts, plans for the future, and imagines <b>fictitious</b> <b>scenarios.</b> In sleep, when the demands of sensory input are reduced, our experience turns to the thoughts and images we call dreaming. Far from being a meaningless distraction, the content of these subjective experiences provides an important and unique {{source of information about}} the activities of the resting mind and brain. In both wakefulness and sleep, spontaneous experience combines recent and remote memory fragments into novel scenarios. These conscious experiences may reflect the consolidation of recent memory into long-term storage, an adaptive process that functions to extract general knowledge about the world and adaptively respond to future events.

We propose an approach where several characterizing values in a given environment - trust of source, certainty of data, and importance (of data) in the current processing step - are used to compute new output characteristics of a knowledge processing system. These values represent the trustworthiness and the certainty of the output in multi-step processing systems based on all used sources and input data.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study of perceptions about gay, lesbian, and heterosexual domestic violence in Sweden. Undergraduate students (N = 1009) read one of eight <b>fictitious</b> <b>scenarios</b> of domestic violence in married couple relationships, where sexual orientation, sex of victim and batterer, and severity of violence were varied. Perceptions of seriousness of the described incident and attitudes toward women, gays and lesbians were measured. Domestic violence was perceived as more serious in cases where: the respondent was a woman, the batterer was a man, the victim was a woman, or the battering was severe. Wife-battering in a heterosexual relationship was considered the most serious case in both the less and more severe battering scenario. Where battering was less severe, domestic violence in gay and lesbian relationships was perceived as more serious than heterosexual husband-battering; this difference disappeared in the severe battering scenario. Negative attitudes toward gays, lesbians, and women were associated with less concern about domestic violence in all types of relationships. The findings suggest that stereotypes about gays, lesbians, and women affect perceptions of domestic violence, but mainly when violence is less severe...|$|R
