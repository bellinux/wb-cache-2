40|$|This Master Thesis was {{conducted}} at Octapharma AB in Stockholm. Anticomplementary activity (ACA) {{is a measure of}} the product’s abilities to activate the complement system. IgG aggregates are mainly responsible for this activation. Two different performances of a method for determination of ACA in Octagam® are available. The two performances are based on the reference method for test of ACA in immunoglobulins in the <b>European</b> <b>Pharmacopoeia</b> Commission <b>Guideline</b> 6. 0 (chapter 2. 6. 17). The method is carried out either in test tubes or on microtiter plates. The test tube method can be performed either in a manual manner or modified, being more automated. The latter performance has been applied in this study. The plate method is more automated than both of the tube methods. The plate method and the manual tube method have earlier seemed to result in different outcomes, which was the basis for this thesis. The plate method and the modified test tube method have been compared and robustness parameters have been studied in order to see which factors influence on the end result. The adequacy of using Human Biological Reference Preparation (human BRP) as a control for the ACA method in general has also been investigated. Samples of the product are outside the scope of this thesis and have not been investigated. According to this study, the plate method and the modified tube method are not comparable with regard to complement titration results and to ACA of the BRP control. A higher precision is gained with the plate method. This in combination with the higher degree of automation makes the plate method advantageous in several aspects. When it comes to the robustness of the ACA method in general, the sheep red blood cells (SRBC) used are critical. Haemolysin dilution and complement activity seem to be critical as well. Human BRP is, according to this study more adequate as a reference for the plate method than for the tube method. An In house control is believed to be more representative to the ACA method in general as it is of the same nature as the samples analysed, in contrast to the human BRP...|$|R
40|$|Rationale. The task of import {{substitution}} {{in health care}} and the development of normative legal acts in the framework of the Eurasian Economic Community raises the questions of harmonization of national requirements with international ones, including the standardization of drugs. Thereby, the assessment of the quality of domestic recombinant human erythropoietin in accordance with <b>European</b> <b>Pharmacopoeia</b> requirements is very actual. The main indicator of drug quality is specific activity of drug (rhepo). In Russian Federation it is determined by the influence of the drug on erythropoiesis stimulation. This effect of erythropoietin is measured by counting the number of reticulocytes using the flow cytometry and light microscopy. The latter method of calculation is not included in <b>European</b> <b>Pharmacopoeia.</b> Adequate assessment of this indicator is required for the development of national requirements for quality control of drugs rhepo harmonized with <b>European</b> <b>Pharmacopoeia.</b> Purpose of the work. The study aimed the comparative evaluation of the accuracy of the specific erythropoietin activity determination method using the flow cytometry and light microscopy data to provide the harmonization of the draft General monograph with <b>European</b> <b>Pharmacopoeia.</b> Research methods. The erythropoietin specific activity was determined in vivo in normocythaemic mice using the flow cytometry in accordance with the <b>European</b> <b>Pharmacopoeia</b> and light microscopy. We have compared the effects of two independent dilution series of erythropoietin <b>European</b> <b>Pharmacopoeia</b> standard sample. Results. The results of specific erythropoietin activity determination obtained by two different methods of measurement differed in the offset from the reference value (certified value). In flow cytometry data, the offset varied between 1 - 8 %, the results of light microscopy showed higher variability ranging from 4 to 31 %. The estimation of intermediate precision showed twice lower dispersion of specific erythropoietin activity measurements obtained by flow cytometry in comparison with light immersion microscopy data. Conclusion. Specific erythropoietin drug activity determination with flow cytometry is characterized by high accuracy and meets the <b>European</b> <b>Pharmacopoeia</b> requirements. We have considered the possibility of light microscopy usage for the same task {{in the absence of a}} flow cytometer. The usage of light microscopy requires increasing its accuracy in order to harmonize the method with <b>European</b> <b>Pharmacopoeia</b> requirements...|$|R
