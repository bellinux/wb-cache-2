40|$|A {{computational}} {{fluid flow}} {{analysis on the}} flow <b>diverter</b> <b>system</b> under consideration for the Space Shuttle main engine high pressure fuel turbopump (SSME HPFTP) is proposed. A three dimensional viscous flow environment is computed to optimize the geometric configuration and location of the flow <b>diverter</b> <b>system.</b> The analysis consists of a fully turbulent cold flow calculation by Navier-Stokes equations and a Baldwin-Lomax turbulence model. The equations are numerically by a finite difference/element procedure. The results will provide the steady and unsteady pressure field and thermal environment required to assess {{the usefulness of the}} flow <b>diverter</b> <b>system</b> <b>in</b> deflecting the cold flow away from the hot turbine components. A geometry optimization study determines the best diverter shape and location to avoid larger thermal gradients on the rotor/stator components...|$|R
