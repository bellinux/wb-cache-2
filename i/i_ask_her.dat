Next day <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>her.</b> She laugh and says: 'Sitka Charley, that is none of your business. I give you one {{thousand}} dollars take me to Dawson. That only is your business.' Next day after that <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> what is her name. She laugh, then she says, 'Mary Jones, that is my name.' I do not know her name, but I know {{all the time that}} Mary Jones is not her name.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} away from England so long," [...] Francis {{continued}} slowly, [...] "that my memory has suffered. Yet that lady's face was somehow familiar. May <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> name?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never, {{under any}} circumstances, would <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> again. You may make your mind up to that. As sure as you stand there, she will marry Daniel Thwaite, if she lives another twelvemonth." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> {{if she had}} any suggestions. She said, {{what about}} Tempest Storm? <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> {{if she had any}} other suggestions. Well, she said, what about Sunny Day? Well, I said, I guess {{it might as well be}} Tempest Storm.|$|R
60|$|HIGGINS. You didn't. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her.</b> If you'd {{known her}} you wouldn't have <b>asked</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> {{to marry}} me in a year's time. She shook her head.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's what <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>her.</b> Her {{answer is}} that she loves me only too well. She's so afraid of being a burden {{to me that she}} gives me my freedom till I've taken another year to think." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is Mrs. Porter {{the mother}} of the child, or are you? What has Mrs. Porter to do with it? Why should <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> permission? How does it happen to be any {{business}} of Mrs. Porter's at all?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Tyrrel {{turned to}} him without one word of reproach. [...] "Well, we're no rivals now," [...] he answered, generously. [...] "Even if she would have me--even if she loved me well--how could <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> to take--her brother's murderer?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> {{the hours}} she worked, {{and she said}} it {{depended}} on the season.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her,</b> {{and looked}} curiously at her, because {{she looked so}} curiously at me.|$|R
60|$|I made no answer, but {{turning to}} Pomona, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> what this all meant.|$|R
6000|$|Airy, fairy Lilian, [...] Flitting, fairy Lilian, [...] When <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> if she love me, [...] Claps {{her tiny}} hands above me, [...] Laughing all she can; [...] She'll {{not tell me}} if she love me, [...] Cruel little Lilian.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{sorry to}} baulk Feemy of her walk, Captain Ussher, {{if she did}} say so. It's not very often <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> to put herself out for me; but this afternoon, I shall feel obliged to her not to go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{write to}} you, Sir Henry, {{in order that}} your Queen may {{preserve}} for me my country, it being in her hands. The Boers are coming into it, and I do not like them. Their actions are cruel among us black people. We are like money, they sell us and our children. <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>Her</b> Majesty to pity me, and to hear that which I write quickly. I wish to hear upon what conditions Her Majesty will receive me, and my country and my people, under her protection. I am weary with fighting. I do not like war, and <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>Her</b> Majesty to give me peace. I am very much distressed that my people are being destroyed by war, and I wish them to obtain peace. <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>Her</b> Majesty to defend me, as she defends all her people. There are three things which distress me very much--war, selling people, and drink. All these things I shall find in the Boers, and it is these things which destroy people to make an end {{of them in the}} country. The custom of the Boers has always been to cause people to be sold, and to-day they are still selling people. Last year I saw them pass with two waggons full of people whom they had bought at the river at Tanane" [...] (Lake Ngate).|$|E
60|$|On Monday {{at breakfast}} <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> casually {{if she had}} yet found a Gretchen.|$|R
60|$|We {{turned over}} some more photographs, and <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> {{if she had}} always lived at Grimwinter.|$|R
60|$|A creek {{separated}} {{us for a}} few minutes. When we {{came together}} again <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> a question.|$|R
6000|$|... “Well, mother, I met {{her again}} {{unexpectedly}} {{more than two}} and a half years ago in London. Her father had come over here to live, and has a fine house at Dulwich. I have just been staying there for a week, and I have some hope that when <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> she will consent to be my wife.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What I have done, I have undone!" [...] said Stangrave, looking up. [...] "If I have wronged her, I {{have offered}} to right her; if I have left her, I have sought her again; and if I left her when I knew nothing, now that I know all, <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> here, before you, to become my wife!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now that's a pity,' said Bob, looking regretfully after Anne. 'I didn't {{remember}} {{that she was}} a quick-tempered sort of girl at all. Tell her, Mrs. Garland, that <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> pardon. But of course I didn't know she was too proud to accept a little present--how should I? Upon my life if it wasn't for Matilda I'd--Well, that can't be, of course.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> {{to explain}} her meaning, but she only said that little boys couldn't {{understand}} those things.|$|R
60|$|IVY. I {{know what}} Mrs. Strangway said it was, 'cause <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> once, {{before she went}} away.|$|R
60|$|Not {{wishing to}} pursue this subject, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> what her father was doing with the metal plates.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never have I passed such {{a day in}} my life," [...] Von Hartmann cried, {{stamping}} {{upon the}} floor. [...] "My experiment has failed. Von Althaus has insulted me. Two students have dragged me along the public road. My wife nearly faints when <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> for dinner, and my daughter flies at me and hugs me like a grizzly bear." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I know that. I {{think that}} if <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> to take me for about two guineas a week {{it will be very}} moderate. It costs me so much more now in London. And the money I am {{spending}} besides in cabs and finery--I am afraid, Constance, that I am degenerating because I have this money, and that I am forgetting how many poor people are in actual want." ...|$|E
60|$|Cre. My hurt is nothing, sir; but I appeal To wise Tiresias, if my {{accusation}} Be {{not most}} true. The first of Laius' blood Gave him his death. Is there a prince before her? Then she is faultless, and <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> pardon. And may this blood ne'er cease to drop, O Thebes, If pity of thy sufferings {{did not move}} me, To shew the cure which heaven itself prescribed.|$|E
5000|$|Quotation {{or direct}} speech: Carol said [...] "Go ahead" [...] when <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> if the {{launcher}} was ready.|$|R
60|$|As {{she was in}} such a {{communicative}} humour, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> if she {{had dreamed}} at all that night.|$|R
60|$|Then, after apologising {{for putting}} so many {{questions}} to <b>her,</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> if she could tell me her name.|$|R
6000|$|... "She is nice every way," [...] {{she told}} the unconvinced Aunt Olivia. [...] "She's clever and well read. She is {{sensible}} and frank. She {{has a sense of}} humour {{and a great deal of}} insight into character--witness her liking for your niece! She can talk interestingly and she can also be silent when silence is becoming. And she has the finest profile I ever saw. Aunt Olivia, may <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> to visit me next winter?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And ought I not to be? Didn't <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> {{three times}} before she said yes? Those are the wives for wear, sir. None of the fruit that falls at a shaking for me! Hasn't she stuck by me in every climate, and in every land I was in? Not a fellow in the company had such a wife. Wouldn't I throw myself off this coach this moment, {{to give her a}} moment's peace? That I would, though; d----me if I wouldn't.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One evening I went, as was my wont, to see Blanche. She was radiant: she {{was wild}} with spirits: a saucy triumph blazed in her blue eyes. She talked, she rattled in her childish way. She uttered, {{in the course}} of her rhapsody, a hint--an intimation--so terrible that the truth flashed across me in a moment. Did <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>her?</b> She would lie to me. But I know how to make {{falsehood}} impossible. Add I ORDERED HER TO GO TO SLEEP." ...|$|E
60|$|So <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> {{who were}} {{the men who had}} sat at the long table. She became rather stiff and curt.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why?" [...] <b>I</b> <b>asked.</b> <b>Her</b> {{agitation}} had communicated {{itself to}} me. [...] "I thought you weren't going until Thursday. What's the matter?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> if {{that were}} not our destination? On her motioning Yes, with the same hasty gesture as before, I stopped an empty coach that was coming by, and we got into it. When <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> where the coachman was to drive, she answered, 'Anywhere near Golden Square! And quick!'--then shrunk into a corner, with one {{trembling}} hand before her face, and the other making the former gesture, {{as if she could}} not bear a voice.|$|R
