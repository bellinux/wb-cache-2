40|$|SKF Gothenburg is {{planning}} on a restructuring of their production area and {{sees this as}} an excellent opportunity to update and make their internal logistics more efficient. This thesis suggests how a more efficient internal logistics can be achieved with higher fill ratios and minimal environmental impact. Also resource savings linked to the internal material handling will be reviewed. To carry out properly informed and substantial improvements a field study in form of surveys, interviews and forms have been completed. The result is a current status analysis where potential areas of improvement have been clarified. The <b>driving</b> <b>schedules</b> have carefully been reviewed and modifications {{have been made to}} meet the demands and requirements set by the company. The study has resulted in updated <b>driving</b> <b>schedules</b> that take account of the restructured production area whilst meeting the productions daily requirements. A more efficient transport logistics with better use of resources have been achieved through increased fill ratios and reduced truck transportation outside, this with a minimal impact on the environment. The <b>driving</b> <b>schedules,</b> which the project resulted in, have high flexibility. Due to the constant changes that take place in the production area the <b>driving</b> <b>schedules</b> should rather be considered as a basis to further develop, than a finished result. The low amount of data available at the project's start-up required an own field study that resulted in own primary data. The reliability of the generated data had benefited if more time was available, a larger time frame for data collection had led to a broader and deeper understanding of the internal logistics. Despite the projects short time frame, the result is considered to be reliable. The conclusion is that with a good knowledge of how a company's internal transport flows look, minor changes can lead to big differences in terms of reduced environmental impact, more efficient internal transports and resource savings...|$|R
40|$|The {{large scale}} {{penetration}} of electric vehicles (EVs) will introduce technical {{challenges to the}} distribution grid, but also carries the potential for vehicle-to-grid services. Namely, if available in large enough numbers, EVs {{can be used as}} a distributed energy resource (DER) and their presence can influence optimal DER investment and scheduling decisions in microgrids. In this work, a novel EV fleet aggregator model is introduced in a stochastic formulation of DER-CAM [1], an optimization tool used to address DER investment and scheduling problems. This is used to assess the impact of EV interconnections on optimal DER solutions considering uncertainty in EV <b>driving</b> <b>schedules.</b> Optimization results indicate that EVs can have a significant impact on DER investments, particularly if considering short payback periods. Furthermore, results suggest that uncertainty in <b>driving</b> <b>schedules</b> carries little significance to total energy costs, which is corroborated by results obtained using the stochastic formulation of the problem...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Simulation of {{electric}} vehicles, hybrid electric vehicles, and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles over <b>driving</b> <b>schedules</b> within a full dynamic hybrid and electric vehicle simulator requires battery models capable of predicting state-of-charge, I-V characteristics, and dynamic behavior of different battery types. A battery model capable of reproducing lithium-ion, nickel-metal hydride, and lead-acid I-V characteristics (with minimal model alterations) is proposed. A battery-testing apparatus {{was designed to}} measure the proposed parameters of the battery model for all three battery types and simulate <b>driving</b> <b>schedules</b> with a programmed source and load configuration. A multiple time-constant battery model was used for modeling lithium-ion batteries; verification of time constants in the seconds to minutes and hour ranges {{has been shown in}} numerous research articles and a time constant in the millisecond range is verified here with experiments. Lack of significant time constants in the millisecond range is validated through direct testing. A modeled capacity-rate effect within the state-of-charge determination portion of the proposed model is verified experimentally to ensure accurate prediction of battery state of charge after lengthy <b>driving</b> <b>schedules.</b> The battery model was programmed into a Matlab/Simulink environment and used as a power source for plug-in hybrid electric vehicle simulations. Results from simulations of lithium-ion battery packs show that the proposed battery model behaves well with the other subcomponents of the vehicle simulator; accuracy of the model and prediction of battery internal losses depends on the extent of tests performed on the battery used for the simulation. Extraction of model parameters and their dependence on temperature and cycle number is ongoing, as well as validation of the Simulink model with hardware-in-the-loop “driving schedule ” cycling of real batteries...|$|R

40|$|Fatigue (sleepiness, tiredness) is {{the largest}} identifi-able and {{preventable}} cause of accidents in transport operations (between 15 % and 20 % of all accidents), more than that of alcohol or drug related incidents in all modes of transportation. Drowsiness can produce {{the same types of}} effects as alcohol; slowed reaction time, decreased awareness and impaired judgment, all of which increase the risk of having an accident. Driver fatigue should be considered in the early phases of planning and making of <b>driving</b> <b>schedules.</b> Drive and rest regulations are imposed by different councils to ensure a marginal fatigue management. This thesis concerns development of an algorithm which makes optimized <b>driving</b> <b>schedules</b> to manage drivers' fatigue for commercial transports. Here the vehicle routing problem (VRP) with time windows was solved using dynamic programming. Then an alertness prediction model, the sleep-wake predictor, was used to evaluate the schedules in the first step and then was incorporated into the algorithm to produce optimized schedules based on predicted alertness. Alertness based optimization improved the average driving alertness, and also decreased the duration of high accident risk (HRD) intervals. In the simulations, the alertness level has increased 4 % and HRD decreases by 9 % in average. However, as a result, the traveled distance will go up 22 %, which will increase the total cost in another way. A more detailed analysis can be done considering actual accident and regular transportation costs, and further improve the algorithm to be used in real life scheduling problems...|$|R

40|$|We {{present an}} adaptive-gain second order sliding mode (SOSM) control {{applied to a}} hybrid power system for {{electric}} vehicle applications. The main advantage of the adaptive SOSM {{is that it does}} not require the upper bound of the uncertainty. The proposed hybrid system consists of a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) with a unidirectional DC/DC converter and a Li-ion battery stack with a bidirectional DC/DC converter, where the PEMFC is employed as the primary energy source and the battery is employed as the second energy source. One of the main limitations of the FC is its slow dynamics mainly due to the air-feed system and fuel-delivery system. Fuel starvation phenomenon will occur during fast load demand. Therefore, the second energy source is required to assist the main source to improve system perofrmance. The proposed energy management system contains two cascade control structures, which are used to regulate the fuel cell and battery currents to track the given reference currents and stabilize the DC bus voltage while satisfying the physical limitations.
