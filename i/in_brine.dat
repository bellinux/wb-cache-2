5|$|Despite {{these reports}} of toxicity, L.torminosus {{mushrooms}} are prepared in Finland, Russia, and other northern and eastern European countries by parboiling, soaking <b>in</b> <b>brine</b> for several days, or pickling, after {{which it is}} valued for its peppery taste. In Norway, it is roasted and added to coffee. Mushrooms are harvested for commercial sale in Finland. The nutrient composition of Finnish specimens has been analyzed and found to contain the following components (as a percentage of dry weight): protein, 17.2%; phosphorus, 0.46%; calcium, 0.12%; magnesium, 0.088%; potassium, 2.97%; sodium 0.011%.|$|E
5|$|Tzfat cheese, a {{white cheese}} <b>in</b> <b>brine,</b> similar to feta, was first {{produced}} by the Meiri dairy in Safed in 1837 and is still produced there by descendants of the original cheese makers. The Meiri dairy also became famous for its production of the Balkan-style brinza cheese, which became known as Bulgarian cheese due to its popularity in the early 1950s among Jewish immigrants from Bulgaria. Other dairies now also produce many varieties of these cheeses. Bulgarian yogurt, introduced to Israel by Bulgarian Jewish survivors of the Holocaust, is {{used to make a}} traditional yogurt and cucumber soup.|$|E
5|$|Puffins {{have been}} hunted by man since time immemorial. Coastal {{communities}} and island dwellers with few natural resources at their disposal, made {{good use of}} the seafoods that they found on their cliffs and shores. Puffins were caught and eaten fresh, salted <b>in</b> <b>brine</b> or smoked and dried. Their feathers were used in bedding and their eggs were eaten, {{but not to the}} same extent as those of some other seabirds, being more difficult to extract from the nest. In most countries, Atlantic puffins are now protected by legislation, and in the countries where hunting is still permitted, strict laws prevent over-exploitation. They are still caught and eaten in Iceland and the Faroe Islands, but there have been calls for an outright ban on hunting them in Iceland because of concern over the dwindling number of birds successfully raising chicks.|$|E

40|$|Previously we have {{proposed}} {{a model for the}} acetate-enhanced corrosion of carbon steel <b>in</b> oilfield <b>brines</b> based on acetic acid (C 2 H 4 O 2, HOAc) as the dominant reactant in the cathodic reactions leading to corrosion and suggested that corrosion rates may be predicted from a knowledge of the equilibrium composition of the brine; concentrations of HOAc > 1 mM should flag a warning to possible acetate-enhanced corrosion. In this paper, we show that acetate ions <b>in</b> the <b>brine</b> also contribute to enhanced rates of corrosion through a second, although less-important, mechanism-the catalysis of the hydration of carbon dioxide (COj to carbonic acid (H 2 CO 3). We also consider further the role of bicarbonate. Bicarbonate increases the pH and therefore decreases the equilibrium concentration of HOAc <b>in</b> the <b>brine,</b> and, indeed, it is the presence of bicarbonate <b>in</b> <b>brines</b> that prevents acetate-enhanced corrosion from being a major hazard in a large number of oilfield pipelines. It is also the concentration of bicarbonate <b>in</b> the <b>brine</b> that controls the structure of the corrosion film on the carbon steel surface...|$|R

40|$|Eighteen {{strains of}} {{extremely}} halophilic bacteria and three strains of moderately halophilic bacteria were isolated from four different solar salt environments. Growth tests on carbohydrates, low-molecular-weight carboxylic acids, and complex medium {{demonstrated that the}} moderate halophiles and strains of the extreme halophiles Haloarcula and Halococcus grew {{on most of the}} substrates tested. Among the Halobacterium isolates were several metabolic groups: strains that grew on a broad range of substrates and strains that were essentially confined to either amino acid (peptone) or carbohydrate oxidation. One strain (WS- 4) only grew well on pyruvate and acetate. Most strains of extreme halophiles grew by anaerobic fermentation and possibly by nitrate reduction. Tests of growth potential <b>in</b> natural saltern <b>brines</b> demonstrated that none of the halobacteria grew well <b>in</b> <b>brines</b> which harbor the densest populations of these bacteria in solar salterns. All grew best <b>in</b> <b>brines</b> which were unsaturated with NaCl. The high concentrations of Na+ and Mg 2 + found <b>in</b> saltern crystallizer <b>brines</b> limited bacterial growth, but the concentrations of K+ found <b>in</b> these <b>brines</b> had little effect. MgSO 4 was relatively more inhibitory to the extreme halophiles than was MgCl 2, but the reverse was true for the moderate halophiles...|$|R

25|$|The {{polyphenol}} {{composition of}} olive fruits varies during fruit ripening and during processing by fermentation when olives are immersed whole <b>in</b> <b>brine</b> or crushed to produce oil. In raw fruit, total polyphenol contents, {{as measured by}} the Folin method, are 117mg/100 g in black olives and 161mg/100 g in green olives, compared to 55 and 21mg/100 g for extra virgin and virgin olive oil, respectively. Olive fruit contains several types of polyphenols, mainly tyrosols, phenolic acids, flavonols and flavones, and for black olives, anthocyanins. The main bitter flavor of olives before curing results from oleuropein and its aglycone which total in content, respectively, 72 and 82mg/100 g in black olives, and 56 and 59mg/100 g in green olives.|$|E
25|$|In the Spring of 1855, as the Crimean war developed, Darwin was {{pondering the}} war of nature, taking the then current analogy with an {{industrial}} economy further than others, and wondering how species spread. He was dismissive of the ideas that others had put forward of sunken continents like Atlantis, and began experimenting in his house with soaking seeds <b>in</b> <b>brine</b> then seeing if they could germinate. He reported his results in Gardeners' Chronicle and roped in his curate friends including Henslow. The consul in Norway sent seed pods which had washed ashore. Hooker was able to identify them as coming from the Caribbean {{and get them to}} germinate at Kew. Investigation of variation brought him back to animal husbandry. He now began dissecting domestic animals and breeding pigeons, joining a pigeon fancier's club: very unorthodox behaviour for naturalists at that time.|$|E
25|$|However, Alessandro Volta, {{a friend}} and fellow scientist, disagreed, believing this {{phenomenon}} was caused by two different metals joined together by a moist intermediary. He verified this hypothesis through experiment, and published the results in 1791. In 1800, Volta invented the first true battery, which {{came to be known}} as the voltaic pile. The voltaic pile consisted of pairs of copper and zinc discs piled on top of each other, separated by a layer of cloth or cardboard soaked <b>in</b> <b>brine</b> (i.e., the electrolyte). Unlike the Leyden jar, the voltaic pile produced a continuous electricity and stable current, and lost little charge over time when not in use, though his early models could not produce a voltage strong enough to produce sparks. He experimented with various metals and found that zinc and silver gave the best results.|$|E
40|$|A {{model system}} for {{studying}} lipid oxidation of salted cod muscle {{was used for}} investigating the interaction effects of including antioxidants and copper <b>in</b> the <b>brine.</b> The results showed that ascorbate might have pro-oxidative or anti-oxidative effects depending on the ascorbate and metal concentrations. Without added copper <b>in</b> the <b>brine,</b> concentrations of ascorbate ≤ 500 ppm had a pro-oxidative effect. With 5 ppm copper added <b>in</b> the <b>brine,</b> low concentrations of ascorbate (≤ 50 ppm) inhibited the formation of TBARS in the cured product. At slightly higher concentrations (100 - 200 ppm), the anti-oxidative properties were lost. Above 200 ppm the ascorbate reduced the oxidation level in the salt ripened product. The application of ascorbate as an antioxidant in salt curing of cod, {{requires the use of}} high concentrations (≥ 1000 ppm) <b>in</b> the <b>brine.</b> When similar concentrations (0. 5 mM) of EDTA, citrate or ascorbate were included with 3 ppm copper <b>in</b> the <b>brine,</b> EDTA was the only antioxidant that efficiently inhibited copper-induced lipid oxidation...|$|R

25|$|In the kitchen, tempeh {{is often}} {{prepared}} by cutting it into pieces, soaking <b>in</b> <b>brine</b> or salty sauce, and then frying. Cooked tempeh can be eaten alone, or used in chili, stir fries, soups, salads, sandwiches, and stews. Tempeh's complex flavor {{has been described}} as nutty, meaty, and mushroom-like. It freezes well, and is now commonly available in many western supermarkets, as well as in ethnic markets and health food stores. Tempeh performs well in a cheese grater, after which it may be used in the place of ground beef (as in tacos). When thin-sliced and deep-fried in oil, tempeh obtains a crisp golden crust while maintaining a soft interior—its sponge-like consistency makes it suitable for marinating. Dried tempeh (whether cooked or raw) is more portable and less perishable and may be used as a stew base. Sometimes when tempeh is diced and left, they will create white feathery fluff which bonds the cut—this is the Rhizopus mold still growing—this is normal and perfectly edible.|$|E
500|$|As cattle {{were the}} basis of Celtic wealth, butter and cheese were {{generally}} made from cows' milk. [...] The Celts were amongst the earliest producers of butter in Britain, and {{for hundreds of years}} after the Romans left the country butter was the primary cooking medium and basis for sauces.

500|$|Production methods {{moved from}} the {{traditional}} dry-curing process of rubbing salt, spices and sugar into the bacon to the less labour-intensive wet-curing {{process in which the}} bacon is left to soak <b>in</b> <b>brine.</b> [...] Wet curing {{can also be used to}} increase the water content of the meat to add bulk and to add sodium nitrate and phosphates to shorten the process, which can then take as little as six hours compared to 2–3 days for dry curing.|$|E
40|$|The redox {{stability}} of plutonium (VI) <b>in</b> WIPP <b>brine</b> was investigated by monitoring the oxidation {{state as a}} function of time using a combination of absorption spectrometry, radiochemical counting and filtration.

Two synthetic brines, Brine A and ERDA- 6, and two underground collected brines, DH- 36 and G-Seep, were used. The {{stability of}} Pu(VI) depended on the brine composition and the speciation of the plutonium <b>in</b> that <b>brine.</b> When carbonate was present, a Pu(VI) -carbonate complex was observed that was stable. In the absence of carbonate, Pu(VI) hydrolytic species predominated which had a wide range of stability <b>in</b> the <b>brines</b> investigated.

After 4 -week incubation at 40  °C under light/dark cycles, a 24  % of abiotic degradation was observed <b>in</b> untreated <b>brines.</b> The stimulation of native brines community with LOM addition allowed an additional 12. 8  % oil attenuation due to biodegradation processes. Successional changes in the active microbial community structure due to the oil contamination (16 S rRNA DGGE approach) showed the selection of one phylotype affiliated to Salinibacter and the disappearance of Haloquadratum walsbyi <b>in</b> untreated <b>brines.</b> <b>In</b> LOM-amended microcosms, phylotypes related to Salinibacter, Haloarcula, Haloterrigena and Halorhabdus were selected. An effect of hydrocarbon contamination was only observed in the bacterial community with the inhibition of two dominant proteobacterial phylotypes. This study further confirms that short-term and moderate oil biodegradation is possible <b>in</b> LOM-stimulated <b>brines.</b> Biodegradation should be much more reduced under in situ conditions.
