In The Wrongs of Woman the heroine's indulgence on romantic fantasies fostered by novels themselves is depicted as particularly detrimental.|$|E

5|$|Lactuca sativa is {{a member}} of the Lactuca (lettuce) genus and the Asteraceae (sunflower or aster) family. The species was first {{described}} in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus in the second volume of his Species Plantarum. Synonyms for L.sativa include Lactuca scariola var. sativa, L.scariola var. integrata and L.scariola var. integrifolia. L.scariola <b>is</b> <b>itself</b> <b>a</b> synonym for L.serriola, the common wild or prickly lettuce. L.sativa also has many identified taxonomic groups, subspecies and varieties, which delineate the various cultivar groups of domesticated lettuce. Lettuce is closely related to several Lactuca species from southwest Asia; the closest relationship is to L.serriola, an aggressive weed common in temperate and subtropical zones in much of the world.|$|E
5|$|Lambda Tucanae is {{an optical}} double—that is, {{the name is}} given to two stars (Lambda1 and Lambda2) which appear close {{together}} from our viewpoint, but are in fact far apart in space. Lambda1 <b>is</b> <b>itself</b> <b>a</b> binary star, with two components—a yellow-white star of spectral type F7IV-V and an apparent magnitude of 6.22, and a yellow main sequence star of spectral type G1V and an apparent magnitude of 7.28. The system is 186 light-years distant. Lambda2 is an orange subgiant of spectral type K2III that is expanding and cooling and has left the main sequence. Of apparent magnitude 5.46, it is approximately 220 light-years distant from Earth.|$|E
5|$|The sum of a {{geometric}} series <b>is</b> <b>itself</b> <b>a</b> result even older than Euler.

A 19th-century reaction against such liberal summation methods resulted in the definition that still dominates today: the sum of a series is defined to be the limit of the sequence of its partial sums. A corresponding proof of the theorem explicitly computes that sequence; {{it can be found}} in any proof-based introduction to calculus or analysis.|$|E

5|$|All named {{species of}} Plateosaurus except the type species and P.gracilis {{have turned out}} to be junior {{synonyms}} of the type species or invalid names. Von Huene practically erected a new species and sometimes a new genus for each relatively complete find from Trossingen (three species of Pachysaurus and seven of Plateosaurus) and Halberstadt (one species of Gresslyosaurus and eight of Plateosaurus). Later, he merged several of these species, but remained convinced that more than one genus and more than one species of Plateosaurus was present in both localities. Jaekel also believed that the Halberstadt material included several plateosaurid dinosaurs, as well as non-plateosaurid prosauropods. Systematic research by Galton drastically reduced the number of genera and species. Galton synonymised all cranial material, and described differences between the syntypes of P.engelhardti and the Trossingen material, which he referred to P.longiceps. Galton recognized P.trossingensis, P.fraasianus and P.integer to be identical to P.longiceps. Markus Moser, however, showed that P.longiceps <b>is</b> <b>itself</b> <b>a</b> junior synonym of P.engelhardti. Furthermore, a variety of species in other genera were created for material belonging to P.engelhardti, including Dimodosaurus poligniensis, Gresslyosaurus robustus, Gresslyosaurus torgeri, Pachysaurus ajax, Pachysaurus giganteus, Pachysaurus magnus and Pachysaurus wetzelianus.|$|E
5|$|Since {{bupropion}} is metabolized to hydroxybupropion by the CYP2B6 enzyme, {{drug interactions}} with CYP2B6 inhibitors are possible: this includes medications like paroxetine, sertraline, fluoxetine, diazepam, clopidogrel, and orphenadrine. The expected {{result is the}} increase of bupropion and decrease of hydroxybupropion blood concentration. The reverse effect (decrease of bupropion and increase of hydroxybupropion) can be expected with CYP2B6 inducers, such as carbamazepine, clotrimazole, rifampicin, ritonavir, St John's wort, phenobarbital, phenytoin and others. Conversely, because bupropion <b>is</b> <b>itself</b> <b>a</b> strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 (Ki = 21μM), as is its active metabolite, hydroxybupropion (Ki = 13.3μM), it can slow the clearance of other drugs metabolized by this enzyme. As an example, the ratio of dextromethorphan (a drug that is mainly metabolized by CYP2D6) to its major metabolite dextrorphan increased approximately 35-fold when it was administered to people being treated with 300mg/day bupropion, indicative of a major drug interaction with a common over-the-counter medicine.|$|E
5|$|The two {{roots of}} any {{quadratic}} equation {{may be of}} three possible types: two different real numbers, two identical real numbers (i.e., a degenerate double root), or a pair of complex conjugate roots. The first case corresponds to the usual situation; each pair of roots corresponds {{to a pair of}} solutions that are related by circle inversion, as described below (Figure6). In the second case, both roots are identical, corresponding to a solution circle that transforms into itself under inversion. In this case, one of the given circles <b>is</b> <b>itself</b> <b>a</b> solution to the Apollonius problem, and the number of distinct solutions is reduced by one. The third case of complex conjugate radii does not correspond to a geometrically possible solution for Apollonius' problem, since a solution circle cannot have an imaginary radius; therefore, the number of solutions is reduced by two. Interestingly, Apollonius' problem cannot have seven solutions, although it may have any other number of solutions from zero to eight.|$|E

5|$|Beta, Delta and Kappa are {{multiple}} star systems containing six, two and four stars respectively. Located near {{the tail of}} the toucan, Beta Tucanae's two brightest components, Beta1 and Beta2 are separated by an angle of 27 arcseconds and have apparent magnitudes of 4.4 and 4.5 respectively. They can be separated in small telescopes. A third star, Beta3 Tucanae, is separated by 10 arcminutes from the two, and able {{to be seen as a}} separate star with the unaided eye. Each star <b>is</b> <b>itself</b> <b>a</b> binary star, making six in total. Lying in the southwestern corner of the constellation around 251 light-years away from Earth, Delta Tucanae consists of a blue-white primary contrasting with a yellowish companion. Delta Tucanae A is a main sequence star of spectral type B9.5V and an apparent magnitude of 4.49. The companion has an apparent magnitude of 9.3. The Kappa Tucanae system shines with a combined apparent magnitude of 4.25, and is located around 68 light-years from the Solar System. The brighter component is a yellowish star, known as Kappa Tucanae A with an apparent magnitude of 5.33 and spectral type F6V, while the fainter lies 5 arcseconds to the northwest. Known as Kappa Tucanae B, it has an apparent magnitude of 7.58 and spectral type K1V. Five arcminutes to the northwest is a fainter star of apparent magnitude 7.24 —actually a pair of orange main sequence stars of spectral types K2V and K3V, which can be seen individually as stars one arcsecond apart with a telescope such as a Dobsonian with high power.|$|E
