60|$|When {{he passed}} Allerby mill Kit looked about. Icicles covered the <b>idle</b> <b>wheel,</b> a snow cornice {{hung over the}} flagged roof, and water splashed softly in the half-frozen race. Farther on, the snowy road was {{checkered}} by the shadows of hedges and bare trees. Low roofs, touched by hoar-frost, rose behind the trunks, and {{here and there a}} gleam of yellow light shone out. The road, however, was empty, as Kit was relieved to note.|$|E
60|$|I {{made my way}} to the wheel, where Tom Spink stood. He did {{not notice}} me. With one hand holding the <b>idle</b> <b>wheel,</b> he was leaning out to one side, his eyes fixed in a fascinated stare. I {{followed}} its direction, on between the chart-house and the port-jigger shrouds, and on across a mountain sea that was very vague in the moonlight. And then I saw it! The Elsinore's stern was flung skyward, and across that cold ocean I saw land--black rocks and snow-covered slopes and crags. And toward this land the Elsinore, now almost before the wind, was driving.|$|E
40|$|Idele Wheel whining is a {{phenomenon}} which is predominantly familiar to motor vehicle gear boxes. Usually all the gear wheels are in constant tooth engagement. For this reason one gear wheel from each gear must be supplied with a bearing in order to permit the differences in rotational speeds across the shafts. These wheels, most of which rotate on roller bearings, are described as idle wheels. At very low temperatures in the start up phase a whine like noise is produced by the loose wheel. The noise emission {{does not come from}} the tooth engagements but from the <b>idle</b> <b>wheel</b> bearing. Extensive measurements of idle wheels were carried out at a test stand. A simulation program for lightly respectively not loaded roller bearings has been developped in order to clarify the mechanism of origin of the noise. The foundation for the calculation of the forces in the lubricant film is the instationary hydrodynamic lubricant theory. In order to estimate the critical oil viscosity for noise, simple equations are available to the designer. (orig.)

40|$|The symmetries of a {{physical}} theory are often associated with two things: conservation laws (via e. g. Noether's and Schur's theorems) and representational redundancies ("gauge symmetry"). But how can {{a physical}} theory's symmetries give rise to interesting (in the sense of non-trivial) conservation laws, if symmetries are transformations that correspond to no genuine physical difference? In this article, I argue for a disambiguation {{in the notion of}} symmetry. The central distinction is between what I call "analytic" and "synthetic" symmetries, so called because of an analogy with analytic and synthetic propositions. "Analytic" symmetries are the turning of <b>idle</b> <b>wheels</b> in a theory's formalism, and correspond to no physical change; "synthetic" symmetries cover all the rest. I argue that analytic symmetries are distinguished because they act as fixed points or constraints in any interpretation of a theory, and as such are akin to Poincaré's conventions or Reichenbach's 'axioms of co-ordination', or 'relativized constitutive a priori principles'...|$|R
40|$|Werner Heisenberg's 1925 paper ‘Quantum-theoretical re-interpretation of {{kinematic}} {{and mechanical}} relations’ {{marks the beginning}} of quantum mechanics. Heisenberg famously claims that the paper is {{based on the idea that}} the new quantum mechanics should be ‘founded exclusively upon relationships between quantities which in principle are observable’. My paper is an attempt to understand this observability principle, and to see whether its employment is philosophically defensible. Against interpretations of ‘observability’ along empiricist or positivist lines I argue that such readings are philosophically unsatisfying. Moreover, a careful comparison of Heisenberg's reinterpretation of classical kinematics with Einstein's argument against absolute simultaneity reveals that the positivist reading does not fit with Heisenberg's strategy in the paper. Instead the appeal to observability should be understood as a specific criticism of the causal inefficacy of orbital electron motion in Bohr's atomic model. I conclude that the tacit philosophical principle behind Heisenberg's argument is not a positivistic connection between observability and meaning, but the idea that a theory should not contain causally <b>idle</b> <b>wheels.</b> postprin...|$|R
40|$|The commercially {{available}} wheel chairs for amputees donot have the functionality for climbing staircases. In our project, we have designed a manually operated wheelchair that can travel on both plane terrains {{and also in}} the staircases. In our project, instead of using normal wheels we have used penta wheel. The steel rod is penta shaped and each rod is equally inclined of 72 ° from each other. At the time of climbing, one wheel that is the <b>idle</b> <b>wheel</b> will be in contact with the ground and the another wheel will be in contact with the stair. The motion takes place only when we pull the wheel chair backwards towards the staircase. The main aim of our project is to provide stability to the person who travels in the wheel chair (i. e., a large support base and maintain the overall centre of gravity as low as possible). The main aim of our project is to afford this stair climbing facilities for middle class people. The main drawback of electric powered stair climbing wheel chair is its cost and weight. In our project, we tried to fabricate a low cost stair climbing wheel chair that can be bought by a middle class people...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{aim of the}} {{research}} is the development of a small-scale ground mobile robot for surveillance and inspection; the main design goals are mobility in indoor environments with step climbing ability, pivoting around a vertical axis and without oscillations for stable vision, mobility in unstructured environments, low mechanical and control complexity. Design/methodology/approach – The proposed hybrid leg-wheel robot is characterized by a main body equipped with two actuated wheels and two praying Mantis rotating legs; a rear frame with two <b>idle</b> <b>wheels</b> is connected to the main body by a vertical revolute joint for steering; a second revolute joint allows the rear axle to roll. The geometrical synthesis of the robot has been performed using a nondimensional approach for generality’s sake. Findings – The experimental campaign on the first prototype confirms the fulfilment of the design objectives; the robot can efficiently walk in unstructured environments realizing a mixed wheeled-legged locomotion. Practical implications – Thanks to the operative flexibility of Mantis in indoor and outdoor environments, the range of potential applications is wide: surveillance, inspection, monitoring of dangerous locations, intervention in case of terroristic attacks, military tasks. Originality/value – Different from other robots of similar size, Mantis combines high speed and energetic efficiency, stable vision, capability of climbing over high steps, obstacles and unevenness...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} the experimental {{campaign on the}} prototype of the small scale ground mobile robot Mantis 2. 0. It is a hybrid leg-wheel mobile robot, designed for surveillance and inspection tasks, with a maximum payload (camera, sensors) of 1 kg. Its locomotion system has been conceived to operate both in outdoor environments, on irregular and yielding terrains, and in indoor locations characterized by steps and stairs. Other operative requirements are good speed, energetic efficiency and stable camera vision without oscillations on flat terrains. The Mantis architecture {{is based on a}} main body with two front actuated wheels, a passive rear axle with two <b>idle</b> <b>wheels</b> and two rotating legs. While motion on flat and even ground is purely wheeled, with differential steering, when additional traction is required, for example in case of ground irregularities or obstacles, the front legs can rotate, performing a mixed leg-wheel locomotion. The profile of the legs is inspired by the praying mantis, and is specially designed to climb square steps and stairs, grasping the top of the step and lifting up the robot body. For stair/step descent, the legs are equipped with passive degrees of freedom for shock absorption. The multibody simulations and the experimental tests on the Mantis 1. 0 prototype have shown the effectiveness of the proposed leg profile both for step climbing and for locomotion on uneven terrains and obstacles. The Mantis 2. 0 prototype is equipped with auxiliary passive wheels, which reduce friction between legs and step upper surface in the last phase of step climbing, which is the most critical, in order to improve the reliability of the whole manoeuvre for all friction conditions. The auxiliary wheels are connected to the legs by one-way bearings, in order to avoid loss of traction during the mixed leg-wheel locomotion. The results of the experimental campaign confirm the goodness of the Mantis design, which represents potentially a versatile multipurpose platform {{for a wide range of}} unmanned applications. The next step of the research will be the development of an autonomous or semi-autonomous guidance system, capable of coordinating legs and wheels for obstacle climbing without human intervention...|$|R

The explosion severed the mooring lines and the wreck drifted downriver and washed up at Albina.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a {{digital signal processing}} analysis of diesel engine idle vibration in automobiles, and {{an analysis of the}} human subjective response to the idle vibration which occurs at the steering wheel. In order to quantify the variations in the diesel idle vibration that can be introduced by the engine technology, the vehicle, and the fuel type, a set of acceleration time histories were measured at the engine block and at the steering wheel for two automobiles equipped with 4 -cylinder engines which had different injection systems and which operated under different fuel conditions. A combination of time domain, frequency domain and time-frequency wavelet-based analysis were used. Both the continuous wavelet transform and the discrete orthogonal wavelet transform were applied to the steering wheel acceleration time histories in order to analyse the statistical variation in terms of both instantaneous variations, and the cycle-to-cycle variations which occur across complete thermodynamic engine cycles. The combination of orthogonal wavelet transform and time-varying auto-covariance analysis, performed across a complete engine thermodynamic cycle, was identified as the most sensitive method for describing the statistical variation in diesel idle vibration. The second-order engine harmonic H 2 was found to account for most of the vibrational energy at the steering <b>wheel</b> when at <b>idle.</b> Amplitude modulation of the second-order engine harmonic H 2 by the half-order engine harmonic H 112 has been identified as the main characteristic of the steering wheel signature of automobiles at <b>idle.</b> The steering <b>wheel</b> <b>idle</b> vibration produced by different engines and different fuel conditions have therefore been described in terms of the amplitude modulation depth "mil that characterises the idle waveform. Four psychophysical response tests, determined by the combination of two test protocols and two semantic descriptors, were performed. A model of the growth in the human subjective response to diesel idle vibration has been proposed in which the response scale {{is a function of the}} modulation depth parameter "mil. The model is defined over two regions of modulation depth. For values of "m" less than 0. 2, humans have been found to be unable to distinguish variations in idle modulation. For values of "m" greater than 0. 2, the human response grows as a power function with respect to modulation depth. Based on the current findings, suggestions for future research are also provided...|$|R
