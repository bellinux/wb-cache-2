40|$|TRACT The current design {{trend of}} {{rotating}} machines like turbogenerators, compressors, turbines, and pumps {{is focused on}} obtaining both high dynamic performances and high versatility of machines in different operating conditions. The first target is nowadays achieved by equipping machines with tilting <b>pad</b> <b>journal</b> bearings. For the second target, State-of-the-Art researches {{are focused on the}} development of active systems able to adapt the dynamic behavior of the machine to the external environment and new operating conditions. Typical causes of large vibration in rotating machines are faults, residual unbalance, resonance condition and instabilities. Aiming at vibration reduction, in recent years many studies are carried out to investigate different solutions; one of them is based on active tilting <b>pad</b> <b>journal</b> bearing. In this paper, the authors investigate, by simulations, the reduction of shaft vibration by controlling the motion of the pads of a tilting <b>pad</b> <b>journal</b> bearing. The basic idea is to balance the exciting force on the shaft with a suitable resulting force of the oil-film pressure distribution. In particular, a sliding mode controller has been considered and both angular rotation of the pads about the pivot and the radial motion of the pivot have been analyzed. Sliding mode control guarantees high robustness of the control system in real applications that can be characterized by a strong non-linear behavior. In the paper a general consideration about the bearing, the actuating methods and the control system have been provided.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of thermal effects is of expressive {{importance in the}} context of rotordynamics to evaluate the behavior of hydrodynamic bearings because these effects can influence their dynamic characteristics under specific operational conditions. For this reason, a thermohydrodynamic model is developed in this work, in which the pressure distribution in the oil film and the temperature distribution are calculated together. From the pressure distribution, the velocity distribution field is determined, as well as the viscous dissipation, and consequently, the temperature distribution. The finite volume method is applied to solve the Reynolds equation and the energy equation in the thermohydrodynamic model (THD). The results show that the temperature is higher as the rotational speed increases due to the shear rate of the oil film. The maximum temperature in the bearing occurs in the overloaded pad, near the outlet boundary. The experimental tests were performed in a tilting <b>pad</b> <b>journal</b> bearing operating in a steam turbine to validate the model.

40|$|Due to {{government}} regulations together with {{health and safety}} reasons, there are increasing demands on reducing hazardous polluting chemicals from fossil fuel power plants. Therefore, more efforts are imposed on using renewable resources such as water, wind, solar and tide to produce clean/green electricity. On top of that, there is another increasing demand from Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) to operate power plants with higher load while keep the power loss to the minimum. These requirements drive conventional fluid film bearings to its mechanical and temperature limits. This calls {{for the development of}} new bearing system designs. An outstanding tribological performance such as low start-up and break-away friction, excellent resistance to chemical attack and anti-seizure properties, can be achieved by introducing compliant polymer liners. At the same time, bearings with compliant liners may alter rotor-bearing system dynamic behaviour compared to the systems with conventional white metal bearings. The research approach of this thesis is to implement compliant liner on bearing surface, impose synchronous shaft excitation and investigate the effect of bearing design parameters on bearing dynamic response. Plain cylindrical journal bearings with different compliant liner thicknesses were analysed using a FEM approach. The numerical model was compared with an in-house developed code based on the finite difference method (FDM) for a bearing operated at steady state conditions. Results obtained by the numerical models showed good agreement. After verification of the numerical model for fixed geometry journal bearings, models for tilting <b>pad</b> <b>journal</b> bearings were developed. Dynamic behaviour of the tilting <b>pad</b> <b>journal</b> bearing with three pads with line pivot geometry was compared with published data. A good agreement was obtained between the two numerical models. The effect of pad pivot geometry on bearing dynamic response was investigated. Vertical and horizontal shaft configurations were compared in terms of the effect of preload factor, radial clearance, pivot offset, and pad inclination angles. Influence of the elastic properties of compliant liners was also studied. All these factors significantly affect bearing dynamic response. It is shown how these factors should be selected to control the journal orbit sizes. Misalignments in compliant tilting <b>pad</b> <b>journal</b> bearings were analysed for load between pivots and load on pivots with consideration of thermal effects. Significant improvements in bearing performance were obtained with compliant bearings compared to white metal bearings. Furthermore, different polymer materials (PTFE, UHMWPE, pure PEEK and PEEK composite) were characterized using Frequency Response Function (FRF). It was shown that as the excitation frequency increased the equivalent stiffness was more or less constant while equivalent damping decreased exponentially. PTFE had similar equivalent stiffness compared to PEEK. As for equivalent damping, PTFE had slightly higher damping compared to PEEK or UHMWPE.

The conditions examined were primarily concerned with operation at high speed (> 200 ft/sec) and light load (< 50 psi specific pressure). The stimulus for this work was the observation of significantly higher than predicted pad temperatures in several steam turbine service applications. The bearings involved were of the conventional pressurized supply (flooded), centrally pivoted, self-aligning type, loaded between pad. High temperatures occurred on both four and five inch diameter bearings designed to operate at shaft speeds up to 14, 000 rpm. To investigate this, four and five inch diameter bearings of almost identical design to the service bearings were tested in a laboratory steam turbine at shaft speeds up to 16, 000 rpm.

Abstract: This work aims {{to analyze}} the thermohydrodynamic behavior of tilting <b>pad</b> <b>journal</b> bearings and evaluate the temperature influence on the dynamics characteristics (equivalent stiffness and damping coefficients) of these bearings. For this reason, a thermohydrodynamic model was developed to analyze tilting <b>pad</b> <b>journal</b> bearings, leading to {{the evaluation of the}} pressure distribution in the oil film jointly with the temperature distribution. The Finite Volume Method is applied in this thermohydrodynamic model to solve the Reynolds' Equation and the Energy Equation. From the distributions of pressure and temperature in the oil film, it is possible to determine the hydrodynamic forces on the bearing, the equilibrium position of the shaft in the bearing and, consequently, the equivalent stiffness and damping coefficients. The results obtained through the thermohydrodynamic model (THD) were compared with the results obtained through the hydrodynamic model (HD), in which the oil film is considered isoviscous, what enables the analysis of the influence of the temperature variation of the oil film in the determination of the equivalent stiffness and damping coefficients of the bearing. The experimental validation of the developed thermohydrodynamic model was accomplished using the temperature measurements obtained in a tilting <b>pad</b> <b>journal</b> bearing operating in a steam turbine.

Results of these data reduction efforts have been compared with vibration tolerance limits.

40|$|A novel tilting <b>pad</b> <b>journal</b> bearing model {{including}} pivot flexibility {{as well as}} temporal fluid inertia {{effects on}} the thin film fluid flow aims to accurately predict the bearing forced performance. The predictive model also accounts for the thermal energy transport effects in a TPJB. A Fortran program with an Excel GUI models TPJBs and delivers predictions of the bearing static and dynamic forced performance. The calculation algorithm uses a Newton-Raphson procedure for successful iterations on the equilibrium pad radial and transverse displacements and journal center displacements, even for bearings pads with very soft pivots. The predictive model accounts for the effect of film temperature on the operating bearing and pad clearances by calculating the thermal expansion of the <b>journal</b> and <b>pad</b> surfaces. The pad inlet thermal mixing coefficient (lambda) influences moderately the predicted fluid film temperature field. Pad pivot flexibility decreases significantly and dominates the bearing stiffness and damping coefficients when the pivot stiffness is lower than 10 % of the fluid film stiffness coefficients (with rigid pivots). Pivot flexibility has a more pronounced effect on reducing the bearing damping coefficients than the stiffness coefficients. Pad pivot flexibility may still affect the bearing behavior at a light load condition for a bearing with a large pad preload. Pad pivot flexibility, {{as well as the}} fluid inertia and the pads? mass and mass moment of inertia, could influence the bearing impedance coefficients, in particular at high whirl frequencies. The stiffness and damping coefficients of a TPJB increase with a reduction in the operating bearing and pad clearances. The work delivers a predictive tool benchmarked against a number of experimental results for test bearings available in the recent literature. The static and dynamic forced performance characteristics of actual TPJBs can not be accurately predicted unless their pad flexibility and pivot flexibility, fluid film temperature, pad inlet thermal mixing coefficient, operating bearing and pad clearances, among others are well known in advance. However, the extensive archival literature showcasing test procedures and experimental results for TPJBs does not report the above parameters. Thus, reasonable assumptions on the magnitude of certain elusive parameters for use in the predictive TPJB model are necessary...|$|R
40|$|Oil film forces System {{identification}} a b s t r a c t A {{new method}} of modeling and identification of weak nonlinear behavior of tilting <b>pad</b> <b>journal</b> bearings (TPJBs) is proposed. A novel nonlinear {{model of a}} TPJB based on a Taylor series expansion of oil film forces, consistent with the transient form of Reynolds differential equation (the original model), is developed. The least mean square technique in time domain is employed to identify Taylor series coefficients of the nonlinear model. The terms with dominant effects on the nonlinear oil film forces are chosen using the subset selection method. Good agreement is achieved between the predicated response obtained from the original model and the one evaluated through using the identified nonlinear model. & 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Analysis, design, {{and testing}} of two types of pivoted <b>pad</b> <b>journal</b> {{bearings}} and a spiral-grooved thrust bearing suitable for direct installation into the NASA 2 to 15 KW Brayton Cycle Rotating Unit (BRU) have been accomplished. Both types of tilting pad bearing assemblies are of the preloaded type, consisting of three pads with one pad flexibly mounted. One type utilizes a non-conforming pivot, while the other replaces the conventional spherical pivot with a cruciform flexible member. The thrust bearing is flexure mounted to accommodate static machine mislinement. Test results indicate that both types of journal bearings should satisfy the requirements imposed by the BRU. Hydrostatic tests of the spiral-grooved thrust bearing showed it {{to be free of}} pneumatic hammer with as many as 24 orifices over the BRU pressure and load range...|$|R
