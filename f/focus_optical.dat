40|$|We {{present a}} novel method to {{transport}} ultra cold atoms in a <b>focused</b> <b>optical</b> lattice over macroscopic distances of many Rayleigh ranges. With this method ultra cold atoms were transported over 5 cm in 250 ms without significant atom loss or heating.

Thus, the presented method is well suited for tightly <b>focused</b> <b>optical</b> lattices that have sufficient trap depth only close to the focus. Tight focusing is usually required for far-detuned optical traps or traps that require high laser intensity for other reasons. The transport time is short and thus compatible with the operation of an optical lattice clock in which atoms are probed in a well designed environment spatially separated from the preparation and detection region.

40|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the case of}} quasi-monochromatic waves, a <b>focused</b> <b>optical</b> pulse in the few-cycle limit may exhibit two independent curved wavefronts, associated with phase and group retardations, respectively. <b>Focusing</b> <b>optical</b> elements will generally affect these two wavefronts differently, thus leading to very different behavior of the pulse near focus. As limiting cases, we consider an ideal diffractive lens introducing only phase retardations and a perfect non-dispersive refractive lens (or a curved mirror) introducing equal phase and group retardations. We study the resulting diffraction effects on the pulse, finding both strong deformations of the pulse shape and shifts in the spectrum. We then show how important these effects can be in highly nonlinear optics, by studying their role in attosecond pulse generation. In particular, the focusing effects are found to affect substantially the generation of isolated attosecond pulses in gases from few-cycle fundamental optical fields.

We demonstrate that the optimum condition is achieved when the radiation quality factor (Q_(rad)) of optical antennas is matched to their absorption quality factor (Q_(abs)). We achieve this condition experimentally by fabricating the optical antennas on a dielectric (SiO 2) coated ground plane (metal substrate) and controlling the antenna radiation through optimizing the dielectric thickness.
