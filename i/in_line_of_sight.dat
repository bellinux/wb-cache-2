25|$|On 6 April 2012, Darchinyan lost to WBC bantamweight {{champion}} Shinsuke Yamanaka in Yamanaka's {{home country}} of Japan. The fight {{was not without}} controversy. Darchinyan was slightly ahead on one card {{and the other two}} were even after the fourth round. In the fourth, a clash of heads opened a bloody cut on Darchinyan's eyebrow and nose. Yamanaka hit Darchinyan with an elbow on the same eyebrow in round five, severing the cut. The referee was not <b>in</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> to see this. Blood was pouring more rapidly out of Darchinyan's eyebrow afterward and the ringside doctor examined it. A fight would usually be stopped and given a technical decision at this point, but the cut was controversially ruled to have been caused by a punch by the ringside doctor, who examined the cut in the sixth round, when Darchinyan was ahead on points. Darchinyan, fighting with blood in his eyes {{for the rest of the}} fight, lost via decision. The headbutt and elbow thrown by Yamanaka had raised much controversy, as Darchinyan was winning the fight beforehand and his performance seemed to slow down as consequence. The result is currently being protested by Team Darchinyan with photographic proof Yamanaka used an illegal headbutt and elbow.|$|E
2500|$|According to a 1942 Japanese after action report, [...] "In {{order to}} keep strict radio silence, steps such as taking off fuses in the circuit, and holding and sealing the keys were taken. During the operation, the strict radio silence was {{perfectly}} carried out... The Kido Butai used the radio instruments {{for the first time}} on the day of the attack since they had been fixed at the base approximately twenty days before and proved they worked well. Paper flaps had been inserted between key points of some transmitters on board [...] to keep the strictest radio silence..." [...] Commander Genda, who helped plan the attack, stated, [...] "We kept absolute Radio Silence." [...] For two weeks before the attack, the ships of Kido Butai used flag and light signals (semaphore and blinker), which were sufficient since task force members remained <b>in</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> for the entire transit time. Kazuiyoshi Koichi, the Communications Officer for , dismantled vital transmitter parts and kept them in a box that he used as a pillow to prevent Hiei from making any radio transmissions until the attack commenced. Lieutenant Commander Chuichi Yoshoka, communications officer of the flagship, Akagi, said he did not recall any ship sending a radio message before the attack. Furthermore, Captain Kijiro, in charge of the Kido Butais three screening submarines, stated nothing of interest happened on the way to Hawaii, presumably including signals received from the supposedly radio silent Kido Butai. Vice Admiral Ryūnosuke Kusaka stated, [...] "It is needless to say that the strictest radio silence was ordered to be maintained in every ship of the Task Force. To keep radio silence was easy to say, but not so easy to maintain." [...] There is nothing in the Japanese logs or after action report indicating that radio silence was broken until after the attack. Kusaka worried about this when it was briefly broken on the way home.|$|E
40|$|The Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) {{has allowed}} precise {{determinations}} {{of the column}} densities of molecular hydrogen () <b>in</b> Galactic <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> {{with a wide range}} of pathlengths and extinction properties. However, survey studies <b>of</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> with greater extinction have been mostly restricted to the low-J states (lower total angular momentum) in which most molecular hydrogen is observed. This paper presents a survey of column densities for the molecular hydrogen in states of greater rotational excitation (J ≥ 2) <b>in</b> Galactic <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> with ≳ 20. This study is comprehensive through the highest excited state detectable <b>in</b> each <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight.</b> J= 5 is observed <b>in</b> every <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight,</b> and we detect J= 7 <b>in</b> four <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight,</b> J= 8 <b>in</b> one <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight,</b> and vibrationally excited <b>in</b> two <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight.</b> We compared the apparent b-values and velocity offsets of the higher-J states relative to the dominant low-J states and we found no evidence of any trends that might provide insight into the formation of higher-J, although these results are the most affected by the limits of the FUSE resolution. We also derive excitation temperatures based on the column densities of the different states. We confirm that at least two distinct temperatures are necessary to adequately describe these <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight,</b> and that more temperatures are probably necessary. Total column density is known to be correlated with other molecules; we explore if correlations vary as a function of J for several molecules, most importantly CH and CH^+. Finally, we briefly discuss interpretations <b>of</b> selected <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> by comparing them to models computed using the Meudon PDR code.

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{multiphase}} {{structure of the}} circumgalactic medium (CGM) probed by synthetic spectra through a cosmological zoom-in galaxy formation simulation. We employ a Bayesian method for modeling a combination <b>of</b> absorption <b>lines</b> to derive physical properties of absorbers regardless of the signal-to-noise or whether a particular line is actually detected. This allows us to treat detections (including saturated systems) and non-detections in a uniform manner. We find that <b>in</b> the <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> passing through localized density structures, absorption <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> low, intermediate and high ions {{are present in the}} spectrum and overlap in velocity space. To our surprise, all of the ions can be combined to derive the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> (LOS) mass-weighted properties, although the ions are not co-spatial. <b>In</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> that go through the hot halo, only HI and high ions are present. <b>In</b> such <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight,</b> the absorption <b>lines</b> are typically broad due to the complex velocity fields across the entire halo. We show that the derived gas density, temperature, and metallicity match closely the corresponding HI mass-weighted averages along the LOS.
