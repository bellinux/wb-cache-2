As a <b>fastener</b> <b>assembly</b> is tightened, the arch-like protrusions are compressed and the change in distance between {{the base of the}} protrusions of the DTI washer and the protrusion apex, correlates to a value of tensile force induced into the fastener. This distance can be verified by insertion of a tapered feeler gage between the protrusions to the bolt shank.

40|$|The {{motivation}} {{of this research}} is to explore the viability of a method to directly verify whether or not an anaerobic adhesive within a threaded <b>fastener</b> <b>assembly</b> has cured sufficiently to provide secondary locking. Direct verification was implemented via the application of a test torque in the loosening direction of a <b>fastener</b> <b>assembly</b> with Loctite (given a 24 hour cure time). A three phase test plan was developed with the intent of identifying and utilizing this verification torque value which is unique to a given <b>fastener</b> <b>assembly.</b> It was proved that the direct verification method, as outlined in the test plan, was in fact a valid method of verification in some cases. Results were dependent on the materials and coatings of the fastener assemblies. The curing properties of the liquid locking compound (LLC) with plain steel specimens resulted in a verification test that could accurately predict sufficient locking and cure (using distributions in torque measurements). Tests with zinc coated and stainless steel specimens, however, did not produce the same level of predictability in cure as the plain steel specimens. The direct verification method as defined herein is not suited to certain materials and coatings. The less predictable curing properties of the stainless steel specimens caused complications in determining a verification torque that could reliably determine cure, resulting in dropping stainless steel from static and dynamic testing. The zinc coated specimen data was more consistent, but the adhesive did not add sufficient breakaway strength to the <b>fastener</b> <b>assembly</b> needed to define a usable verification value. These results led {{to the conclusion that the}} direct verification method as presented in this work is limited to more active material selections. One possibility to improve the secondary locking of less active materials is the use of a higher strength adhesive. Testing to observe the effect of application of verification torque on the secondary locking was also performed. Multiple verifications were found to be destructive to the point that just over a third of samples failed that might have otherwise passed a single verification test. The single verification testing, on the other hand, caused substantially less locking mechanism degradation, leading to the use of a single verification torque in further testing...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Over the past two decades, {{a major part of}} the manufacturing and assembly market has been driven by its customer requirements. Increasing customer demand for personalised products create the demand for smaller batch sizes, shorter production times, lower costs, and the flexibility to produce families of products - or different parts - with the same sets of equipment. Consequently, manufacturing companies have deployed various automation systems and production strategies to improve their resource efficiency and move towards right-first-time production. However, many of these automated systems, which are involved with robot-based, repeatable assembly automation, require component- specific fixtures for accurate positioning and extensive robot programming, to achieve flexibility in their production. Threaded fastening operations are widely used in assembly. In high-volume production, the fastening processes are commonly automated using jigs, fixtures, and semi-automated tools. This form of automation delivers reliable assembly results at the expense of flexibility and requires component variability to be adequately controlled. On the other hand, in low- volume, high- value manufacturing, fastening processes are typically carried out manually by skilled workers. This research is aimed at addressing the aforementioned issues by developing a freeform automated threaded <b>fastener</b> <b>assembly</b> system that uses 3 D visual guidance. The proof-of-concept system developed focuses on picking up fasteners from clutter, identifying a hole feature in an imprecisely positioned target component and carry out torque-controlled fastening. This approach has achieved flexibility and adaptability without the use of dedicated fixtures and robot programming. This research also investigates and evaluates different 3 D imaging technology to identify the suitable technology required for <b>fastener</b> <b>assembly</b> in a non-structured industrial environment. The proposed solution utilises the commercially available technologies to enhance the precision and speed of identification of components for assembly processes, thereby improving and validating the possibility of reliably implementing this solution for industrial applications. As a part of this research, a number of novel algorithms are developed to robustly identify assembly components located in a random environment by enhancing the existing methods and technologies within the domain of the fastening processes. A bolt identification algorithm was developed to identify bolts located in a random clutter by enhancing the existing surface-based matching algorithm. A novel hole feature identification algorithm was developed to detect threaded holes and identify its size and location in 3 D. The developed bolt and feature identification algorithms are robust and has sub-millimetre accuracy required to perform successful <b>fastener</b> <b>assembly</b> in industrial conditions. In addition, the processing time required for these identification algorithms - to identify and localise bolts and hole features - is less than a second, thereby increasing the speed of <b>fastener</b> <b>assembly...</b>|$|E

The industry calls for faster, more sensitive and reliable NDT techniques for the detection and characterization of potential flaws nearby rivets. In this context, the use of simulation can reduce the development time, to optimize the design and to evaluate the performances of an inspection procedure. In this perspective, CEA and EADS have started a collaborative work aimed at extending the simulation capabilities of the CIVA software platform [1] to deal with flaw detection in a fastened assembly. The configuration under consideration in the paper consists in a layered planar structure with a flaw nearby a fastener. The EC probe is moved along the surface, above the <b>fastener</b> <b>assembly.</b> In a previous work, a model based on a volumetric integral method (VIM) to handle a fastener in a multilayer structure [2] has been built. The latter has been tested with experimental data. Now, we are interested in the addition of a flaw nearby a rivet in the same structure. It mostly has to cope with a scale issue between the size of the rivet and the one of the flaw, the latter being much smaller in a direction than the former.

30|$|Hydrogen {{embrittlement}} {{is a form}} {{of environmentally}} assisted failure which is caused by the action of hydrogen often in combination with residual or applied stress resulting in the reduction of the load bearing capacity of a component. The materials used for industrial processes are generally Fe- and Ni-based alloys that offer high corrosion and creep resistance, but the structure of the alloy is not totally immune to this type of embrittlement. Generally a small quantity of hydrogen is sufficient to cause failures because it has the ability to magnify its effect by migrating to regions of high triaxial stress. The problem of hydrogen embrittlement has been of great concern in various industries. For instance, in power plants, several major components such as steam generator tubes, boilers, steam/water pipe lines, and water box of condensers and other auxiliary components like bolts, nuts, screw <b>fasteners,</b> and supporting <b>assemblies</b> are commonly fabricated from plain carbon steels as well as from low and high alloy steels.

40|$|Composite {{materials}} are widely appreciated by the engineers for aerospace applications {{because of their}} property tailorability, high specific strength, high specific stiffness, less weight and many other advantages. Various technologies are used worldwide for fabrication of these composite structures. One of such {{state of the art}} technologies is co-curing, where the primary structure is co-cured along with the secondary structure by eliminating the fasteners and allowing many other benefits of co-curing. The integral structure realized through co-curing approach will result in cost benefits by reducing the part count, <b>fasteners</b> and <b>assembly</b> time. Such type of fabrication is adopted in transport aircraft wing and empennage structures where the substructure members like spars, ribs etc are co-cured with the skin forming co-cured joints. When such joints are present in wing structures they are subjected to direct or in-direct out-of-plane loads caused by pressure generated due to the presence of fuel. The behavior and the strength of these joints under out-of- plane loads are of concern and has been the topic of many analytical and experimental studies. However, only limited information is available in the open literature. For the present study a typical transport aircraft wing, which is made of composites and fabricated using co-curing technology, is considered. The co-cured wing structure with internal fuel pressure imparting out-of-plane loads on joints are addressed in this paper. The joint strength assessment through feature level test by introducing the same level of defect concentration on such joints would be time consuming and expensive. On the other hand Finite Element (FE) analysis using suitable commercial software with appropriate model of the joint would provide a substantial understanding on the strength of the joint. In the present paper attempts are made to understand the structural behavior of typical co-cured composite joints subjected to pull-off load, in presence and absence of a typical manufacturing defect. The authors demonstrate here the approach to predict the failure strength of co-cured joints under contemplation analytically using a polynomial invariant based three dimensional failure theory. The paper explains the methodology established for predicting failure strength under pull-off load which is a first step towards certification of co-cured joints with and without manufacturing defects. ...|$|R

(Mechanical Engineering) Abstract: The {{document}} {{reports on}} research conducted on titanium bolt assemblies {{pertaining to the}} surface friction behaviour between the sliding surfaces of a screw and nut within a <b>fastener</b> <b>assembly.</b> The research was motivated by problems encountered in the dental implant industry whereby the prescribed preload after application of the fixation torque was not achieved. The insufficient preload in the abutment screw led to implant failure due to the dynamic nature of its maxillofacial function and resulting in tissue growth into micro-spaces because of joint separation between the abutment and implant. Commercially pure Grade 4 titanium screws were sulphurically anodised to various oxide layer thicknesses {{in an attempt to}} reduce the coefficient of friction within the implant assembly. Testing procedures involved the design and manufacturing of the experimental specimen and testing fixture, anodising of screws, friction coefficient measurement, oxide layer thickness measurement, surface hardness measurement, and surface typography investigation. The design process of the specimen and the testing fixture included various FEA (Finite element analysis) in optimising both of the aforementioned systems of the research and conclusively generate accurate results and findings to compare with each other. Oxide layer thickness measurement was conducted by wavelength reflectance theory and visual measurement of the oxide layer using a scanning electron microscope. The surface hardness of the material was measured using a Vickers hardness tester while surface typography investigation was performed using a scanning electron microscope. Findings of the experiments revealed that the coefficient of friction reduces by 10 % to 40 % as the anodising voltage is increased up to an oxide layer thickness of 0. 4 μm, where after the surface friction coefficient increases to eventually surpass the coefficient of friction for untreated fastener assemblies. Untightening examination exhibited similar behaviour to fixation, where the removal friction coefficient reduces to attain a minimum of 0. 69 at an oxide thickness of 0. 06 μm. The untightening coefficient of friction was at a maximum at the increased oxide layer thicknesses of 0. 97 μm to 3. 4 μm. Oxide layer thickness investigation revealed that the thickness of the oxide layer increases exponentially as the anodising voltage is increased. The increase in anodising voltage also [...] ...|$|E
