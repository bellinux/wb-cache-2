50|$|The case, {{now known}} as Ex parte Milligan, was argued before the U.S. Supreme Court on March 5 and March 13, 1866. The Court was asked to {{consider}} three questions. Should a writ of habeas corpus be issued, based on Milligan's petition? Should Milligan be discharged from custody? Did the military commission have jurisdiction to try and sentence Milligan? The Court only considered the issues relating {{to whether or not}} the commission's proceedings were constitutional, and Milligan's eligibility for a <b>discharge</b> <b>from</b> <b>prison.</b> The Court did not evaluate the charges or the evidence presented in the trial by the military commission, and the Supreme Court case did not affect the military commission's finding that Milligan and the others had been involved in a conspiracy. The legal team representing the United States was U.S. Attorney General James Speed, Henry Stanbery, and Benjamin F. Butler, a Civil War general who became a congressman and governor of Massachusetts. Milligan's representatives included James A. Garfield, a member of Congress and a future U.S. president; Jeremiah S. Black, President James Buchanan's U.S. Attorney General and U.S. Secretary of State; David Dudley Field, a New York lawyer and brother of U.S. Supreme Court justice Stephen Johnson Field; and Joseph E.

40|$|AbstractThe aims of {{this study}} were to examine {{unfavorable}} attitudes toward receiving methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) and associated factors among inmates using intravenous heroin in Taiwan. A total of 315 inmates using intravenous heroin were recruited. Their unfavorable attitudes toward receiving MMT after <b>discharge</b> <b>from</b> <b>prison</b> were evaluated using the Client Attitudes Toward Methadone Programs Scale. The associations of unfavorable attitudes toward receiving MMT with sociodemographic and drug-using characteristics, human immunodeficiency virus serostatus, perceived family support, and depression were examined using multiple regression analysis. The results {{of this study}} showed that the mean score of unfavorable attitudes toward receiving MMT, determined on the Client Attitudes Toward Methadone Programs Scale, was 9. 918 (standard deviation= 2. 277, range= 5 – 20). Heroin-using inmates who were young, started using heroin earlier, perceived many advantages and few disadvantages of heroin use, had never received MMT, and had severe depression, had unfavorable attitudes toward receiving MMT. Based on the results of this study, we suggest that inmates who have the factors associated with unfavorable attitudes toward receiving MMT should receive intervention and motivational interviewing to improve their attitudes toward MMT and to increase their opportunity to receive MMT after <b>discharge</b> <b>from</b> <b>prison...</b>|$|E

40|$|Justifications for the {{development}} of special correctional pro grams and for the choice of sentencing disposition for an individual offender are frequently based on claims of greater rehabilitative efficacy. While considerable evidence exists that some types of offenders have relatively more or less likelihood of recidivism than others, there is, as yet, almost no evidence that available correctional alternatives have any impact on those likelihoods. The article reviews findings from studies of correc tion in California for five critical choices in offender process ing : (1) imprisonment or probation, (2) length of stay in prison, (3) treatment program in prison, (4) intensity of parole or probation supervision, and (5) outright <b>discharge</b> <b>from</b> <b>prison</b> or release on parole. The authors conclude that variations in recidivism rates among these alternatives are, for the most part, attributable to initial differences among the types of offenders processed and that the remaining differences in violation rate between programs may be accounted for by differences in inter preting an event as a violation or in officially designating it as such. No evidence was found to support claims of superior re habilitative efficacy of one correctional alternative over another...|$|E
40|$|Magister Artium - MARecidivism, the {{tendency}} to revert to crime upon release from prison, {{seems to be an}} uncontrollable phenomenon as inmates keep on re-offending, which impacts negatively on the already overcrowded correctional centres in South Africa. Life in prison is harsh and overpopulation leads to numerous communicable diseases such as tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and other sexuality transmitted infections. Offenders participate in various rehabilitation programmes during their incarceration. However, the challenge is to sustain these rehabilitation efforts after their <b>discharge</b> <b>from</b> <b>prison.</b> Offenders released into society face numerous obstacles such as the need for employment, food, shelter, and the stigma of having been imprisoned. The community is reluctant to receive perpetrators back into society after their release from prison. Consequently, ex-offenders struggle to find employment because of this stigma, which often translates into family break-ups. They are then expected to invent new ways of making a living and surviving without any help from society; in, they resort to crime, which in turn results in recidivism. The research comprises an exploratory study of the challenges that offenders face upon release and which contribute to recidivism in the Department of Correctional Services (DCS). The West Coast Medium ‘A’ Correctional Centre in the Western Cape has been selected as the case study area. Although offenders attend various rehabilitation programmes inside the prison, it has become apparent that upon their release this rehabilitation is not sustained. The qualitative methodology used for this research included semi-structured interviews in order to gather information on the challenges that contribute to recidivism. Offenders, parolees, family members, the Head of Social Reintegration, a social worker, a representative of NICRO, the Chairperson of the Atlantis Community Police Forum, and a spokesperson for SAPS Atlantis were interviewed in order to gather the relevant information.

40|$|Background: The {{mental health}} of female prisoners as a high-risk group is very important. Evaluating their health needs has been {{neglected}} in most societies. The purpose {{of this research is}} to evaluate the relation between the type of crime committed and the mental health status of the female prisoners in Urmia province, Iran. Methods: This descriptive-analytical study was conducted on 150 female prisoners in 2016. The standard questionnaire of general health with 28 questions and also a questionnaire including demographic information, the type of crime, and the conviction period were used in order to evaluate the mental health status. The collected information was analysed through SPSS 16 and by using chi-square test, Fisher’s exact test and one-way ANOVA. Results: The results showed that 74 % of the female prisoners were suspected to have mental disorder and the least of it was depression with 20. 4 per cent being affected by it and the most severe mental disorder pertaining to social function with 78 % being affected. Also, the prisoner who had committed murder or had been accomplices for murder, and those sentenced to death had the worst mental health. The statistical relation between mental health and the type of crime and the length of the sentence was significant and the odds ratio of mental disorders among women who were sentenced for murder and for being accomplices to murder was 2. 4 times that of women who were convicted for crimes related to drugs. Conclusion: Considering the poor {{mental health of}} female prisoners and its relationship with the severity of the crime and the conviction period, it is necessary to make policies to promote mental health in prisoners in order to promote the other aspects of prisoners’ health and also to prevent the recurrence of crime after the <b>discharge</b> <b>from</b> <b>prison.</b>  ...|$|E

40|$|Background and Objective(s) : Unplanned pregnancies {{are disproportionately}} high among female inmates, and incarceration {{provides}} {{a unique opportunity}} for care may be otherwise difficult to obtain, including reproductive health and family planning services, specifically the provision of contraception. It is known that women are 14 {{times more likely to}} initiate contraception if education and services are provided within the prison (Clarke et al., 2006 b). Despite decades of research identifying the unmet need, very few prisons around the country provide any sort of sexual health or family planning care to prisoners (Braithwaite, Treadwell, 2 ̆ 6 Arriola, 2008). Methods: This project involves the creation of new program and implementation of a new model of care within the existing health care structure at Vermont’s sole women’s prison, Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility (CRCF). First, determination of the most appropriate model of care; second, building a curriculum based on existing evidence-based practice guidelines; and third, implementation of the program using a one-year pilot program. Quality metrics, as yet undetermined and {{beyond the scope of this}} project, will need to be monitored throughout the year by the research and quality team within the prison to measure impact of the new program. Results: Partnership with the Vermont Department of Justice, Department of Corrections, Centurion Health, and Planned Parenthood was necessary for completion of the project. A one-year pilot program begins June 2017, including group and individual education sessions and coordination with staff to expand family planning services within the existing health care clinic, as well as a referral system for care outside of the scope of the clinic. Implications: Despite decades of research demonstrating the need and female inmates desire to obtain contraception before <b>discharge</b> <b>from</b> <b>prison,</b> multiple barriers to accessing care still exist, making reproductive services limited in U. S. women’s prisons. The pilot program will serve as a model for other prisons, and quality measures throughout the year will be vital in demonstrating the success of the program. Extreme attention to ethics and adaptations appropriate to working with a vulnerable population of imprisoned women were central to the completion of this project...|$|E
40|$|At {{the end of}} June {{there were}} 9, 500 people in Ireland on {{methadone}} maintenance treatment (MMT). Of those, 514 were receiving methadone in prisons across the country, HSE data shows. The latter figure, according to Dr Des Crowley, Dublin-based prison doctor at Mountjoy Prison and HSE Dublin North East GP coordinator of Addiction Services, represents a dramatic improvement in addiction services for prisoners. In the past, anyone on methadone maintenance treatment entering prison was forced to withdraw from treatment, as it was not provided. “Treatment was piecemeal,” Dr Crowley told IMN. “Initially there was a detox for people going into prison and then it moved onto putting people who were HIV positive on a methadone programme,” he outlined. “In 2004 anyone entering prison while on a methadone programme was maintained on their programme and subsequently people who were identified as requiring methadone treatment were initiated on {{it for the first}} time. ” Dr Crowley has been working with the addiction services since 1995 and as outlined above, the services have changed beyond recognition in the prison setting since this time. “Access to services, waiting times and the type of service that is now provided have all improved,” he said. “People are no longer taken out of treatment for giving an opiate positive drug screen or for behavioural issues. Doses are much more optimal…and there’s a more comprehensive treatment package available for prisoners. ” Dr Crowley has a keen interest in improving links between prison and community addiction services for patients on methadone maintenance treatment. He spoke about the issue at the recent ICGP Summer School and highlighted the challenges in ensuring that prisoners receiving treatment continue to maintain treatment when released into the community. If someone in prison requests methadone treatment, every effort is made to ensure that they receive it, but as many committal periods are short this can make linking prisoners up with community services problematic, Dr Crowley stated. He added that waiting lists for community methadone services outside Dublin was also a factor in prisoners’ maintaining treatment. The Irish Prison Service (IPS) is the lead on the implementation of Action 43 of the National Drugs Strategy, which refers to the continued “expansion of treatment, rehabilitation and other health and social services in prisons”, Dr Crowley outlined. The action also states that “an agreed protocol for the seamless provision of treatment services as a person moves between prison (including prisoners on remand) and the community” should be developed. Dr Crowley explained that there is a group in the IPS that is charged with implementing the action and with looking at difficulties in placing former prisoners in community services. “We’re looking at creating a central register held by the health directorate in the IPS for anybody in the prison who is having difficulty accessing treatment because of a block or gap within the community,” he stated. “It’s a question of looking at the way the services are designed and looking at what the blocks are in getting people into treatment. They may not necessarily be resource issues but in some areas they may need more clinicians and services. It’s a combination of resources and management, I think. ” Turning to the culture within prisons, Dr Crowley maintained that the injecting culture had been virtually eliminated due to the introduction of better treatment programmes in prisons and the community. “The injecting culture in prisons has changed. There was a high injecting culture in prisons in the past, but that has been pretty much eliminated now. ” Previously ad hoc addiction services in some prisons have also become more streamlined and structured. In Mountjoy, where Dr Crowley tends to prisoners once a week, part of the medical unit is now totally dedicated to drug treatment. There are a variety of distinct treatment programmes in place provided by a multidisciplinary team of addiction doctors, nurses and counsellors and patients can choose to be referred to various pathways. In tandem with the expansion of the unit there are plans to introduce a new database to track patients after they are released from prison to see if they stay on their treatment programme. “We did an audit for 2012 to see if people did attend their community clinic and all bar four patients who were discharged on methadone maintenance returned to their community clinic,” Dr Crowley imparted. The extension of the methadone maintenance treatment programmes to open prisons and training units. The programme has now been extended to the units so that prisoners on methadone who move to the units can choose to maintain their treatment. The infrastructure and arrangements needed to facilitate the development have recently been implemented and to date two patients on methadone have been transferred to open centres. “That’s very exciting because it means people don’t have to choose to detox to have the option of going to an open unit to get access to different types of training,” Dr Crowley stated. “It’s a positive way of looking at methadone as being similar to other medications. Initially, with some of the open units you weren’t even allowed to be on psychiatric medication I think, so that was the first change that happened, and now we’ve come one step further. Asked why the programme had not been provided in open units heretofore, Dr Crowley replied, “I think people found it difficult to comprehend that rehabilitation could be associated with being on methadone”. “Often people think that {{the only way you can}} rehabilitate is if you detox but that’s not the case. There are rehabilitation pathways that include being on methadone and for people with major dependency issues it can sometimes be a more appropriate route for them to take. ” The prescribing of naloxone on <b>discharge</b> <b>from</b> <b>prison</b> is another matter currently under consideration. The move could see prisoners who are undergoing detoxification being given naloxone for use in the event that they overdose, Dr Crowley explained. “This would be for people who are detoxing coming out of prison, not for people on methadone as they’d be linked up with a clinic so their chance of overdosing would be low. “A national pilot is being developed and we’re looking at how that can be rolled out within a prison setting, because it would operate differently in a prison setting compared to the community. ” Those who are detoxing and who relapse into opioid use have a high risk of overdosing. If implemented, the move could reduce the incidence of overdose, especially during the first two to four weeks of release from prison. It is apparent that while many challenges remain in providing a comprehensive methadone maintenance service to prisoners through to their release into the community, improvements are taking place. Dr Crowley, although recognising the difficulties around waiting lists for treatment outside Dublin, believes huge advancements have been made in the provision of methadone treatment services in prisons and the community. “I really enjoy the job and I feel very proud of developments and work done in the last 15 years. I think it has radically changed. Community services have radically changed but I think in the prison service there has been even greater change; it’s been dramatic. ...|$|E

One such instrument is the Sexual Violence Risk Assessment- 20 (SVR- 20), translated and adapted to Spanish by the Advanced Studies in Violence Group at the University of Barcelona. The goal {{of this study is to}} assess the capacity of the SVR- 20 for predicting sexual violence recidivism in a Spanish sample of sex offender prison inmates. The method used was a retrospective study based on the files of 163 sex offenders who had been <b>discharged</b> <b>from</b> <b>prison.</b> Data were analyzed using the logistic regression technique. Of the total sample, 79. 9 % of non-recidivists and 70. 8 % of recidivists were correctly clas-sified. The ROC curve obtained for the model shows very good discriminant capacity for the SVR- 20, with an AUC value of 0. 83. The main conclusion of this study is that the Spanish adaptation of the SVR- 20 is a useful instrument for improv-ing the prediction of sexual violence risk...|$|R

For many decades armies of workers had entered the state to pursue the harvest of a number of crops, or to pick up whatever work was available on their way west in pursuit of a more rewarding life. The U. S. population was highly mobile and migration played an essential role in a vigorously expanding economy. Ailing transients, especially tubercular cases, had as their destination the pure, dry air of the Southwest. To these we can add indeterminate numbers of seasonal workers, ex-veterans, homeless boys, peddlers, beggars, and rootless individuals, some of who had recently been <b>discharged</b> <b>from</b> <b>prisons</b> or <b>from</b> other institutions. People on the move usually traveled by horse-drawn prairie schooner, by rail, or made their way by hitchhiking. In the 1920 s low-priced used autos enabled many families to travel with relative ease over considerable distances 2 ̆ 7 ! Migrants, however, were often unprepared for the rigors of their journey, and they inevitably presented a local welfare problem when their resources were totally exhausted and they were forced to seek public relief...|$|R
