5|$|In 1970, Boeing's 747 {{became the}} first {{wide-body}} jetliner to enter service. The 747 was the first passenger jet wide enough to feature a twin-aisle cabin. Two years later, the manufacturer began a <b>development</b> <b>study,</b> code-named 7X7, for a new wide-body aircraft intended to replace the 707 and other early generation narrow-body jets. The aircraft would also provide twin-aisle seating, but in a smaller fuselage than the existing 747, McDonnell Douglas DC-10, and Lockheed L-1011 TriStar wide-bodies. To defray {{the high cost of}} development, Boeing signed risk-sharing agreements with Italian corporation Aeritalia and the Civil Transport Development Corporation (CTDC), a consortium of Japanese aerospace companies. This marked the manufacturer's first major international joint venture, and both Aeritalia and the CTDC received supply contracts in return for their early participation. The initial 7X7 was conceived as a short take-off and landing airliner intended for short-distance flights, but customers were unenthusiastic about the concept, leading to its redefinition as a mid-size, transcontinental-range airliner. At this stage the proposed aircraft featured two or three engines, with possible configurations including over-wing engines and a T-tail.|$|E

25|$|The Philippines is {{the largest}} {{exporter}} of nurses in the world supplying 25% of all overseas nurses. An Organisation for Economic Co-operation and <b>Development</b> <b>study</b> reported that one of every six foreign-born nurses in the OECD countries is from the Philippines. Of all employed Filipino RNs, roughly 85% are working overseas. This is partially {{in response to the}} inability of Filipino nurses to enter their domestic workforce {{due to a lack of}} jobs and instead become heavily dependent upon international job markets for nurses. The United States has an especially prominent representation of Filipino nurses. Of the 100,000 foreign nurses working in the U.S. as of 2000, 32.6% were from the Philippines.|$|E
25|$|In their {{review of}} data from the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and <b>Development</b> <b>Study</b> (a {{longitudinal}} birth cohort study; n = 941) Moffitt et al. report that while men exhibit more aggression overall, gender is not a reliable predictor of interpersonal aggression, including psychological aggression. The study found that whether male or female, aggressive people share a cluster of traits, including high rates of suspicion and jealousy; sudden and drastic mood swings; poor self-control; and higher than average rates of approval of violence and aggression (in American society, females are, on average, approved of violence against males). Moffitt et al. also argue that antisocial men exhibit two distinct types of interpersonal aggression (one against strangers, the other against intimate female partners), while antisocial women are rarely aggressive against anyone other than intimate male partners.|$|E

40|$|Since the {{establishment}} of <b>Development</b> <b>Studies</b> at several European universities {{at the end of}} the 1960 s, these institutes evolved from an amalgam of left-inclined students and professors towards representatives of an established academic discipline. The author critically reflects upon the transformations that have taken place over that period. In doing so, he first outlines the foundational characteristics of <b>Development</b> <b>Studies</b> and then gives a subjective account of the current situation. In his view, contemporary <b>Development</b> <b>Studies</b> are challenged by 1) a market logic which has penetrated academia and stands in a contradiction to the critical contents of <b>Development</b> <b>Studies</b> and 2) the material and discursive processes of globalisation which require a shift in analytical perspective, disciplinary approach and methods. When addressing the future perspectives of <b>Development</b> <b>Studies</b> in the concluding part, the author argues for a return to a critical research tradition. Critical theory within <b>Development</b> <b>Studies</b> should incorporate new analytical schemes to analyse the economic, political and socio-cultural realities of globalisation. At the same time, <b>Development</b> <b>Studies</b> should not be afraid to reassert a normative approach. That quest might well take us towards a sort of neo-dependency paradigm...|$|R
2500|$|The Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and <b>Development</b> <b>Study</b> is a {{prospective}} study that looked at changes in sexual behavior, attraction, and identity among around 1,000 New Zealanders born in 1972 or 1973. Samples were first interviewed in 1993, {{when they were}} 21, and again at ages 26, 32, and 38, in 2010/2011. The study found a strong decrease in the share of women who self-reported exclusive heterosexual attraction from age 21 (88.3%) to age 26 (82.5%), but a small increase at age 32 (84.2%) and again at 38 (87.6%). By contrast, among men, the share self-reporting exclusive heterosexual attraction remained largely stable between ages 21 (94.9%) and 32 (94.2%), with a small decrease at age 38 (92.9%). Sexual identity was only assessed at ages 32 and 38. At age 32, 0.9% of women and 1.3% of men self-identified as gay, and 2.9% of women and 1.7% of men as bisexual. Additionally, 1.5% of women and 2.2% of men identified as [...] "other". At age 38, 1.1% of women and 1.7% of men self-identified as gay, and 2.6% of women and 3% of men as bisexual, with 1.1% of women and 0.2% of men identifying as [...] "other". While sexual attraction changed more for women than for men, changes among men were more consistently to greater homosexuality, while changes among women past age 26 occurred equally in both directions (i.e., to both more and less heterosexual attraction). Researchers discussed several factors behind the changes, from age effects to cultural effects, with homosexuality, especially female homosexuality, becoming more socially acceptable in the West in the 1990s and 2000s.|$|E

40|$|The “fate of {{development}} studies” {{in the context}} of the dominant thinking on development as propagated by development theorists was one of the main themes highlighted in the 5 th International Malaysian Studies Conference (MSC 5). 1 Indeed, the MSC 5 convenors evoke the call for a reflection on the implications for and the future of <b>development</b> <b>studies</b> in Malaysia. Reflection on the fate and future of <b>development</b> <b>studies</b> in Malaysia requires us, in particular, to understand how <b>development</b> <b>studies</b> has been understood as an academic discipline and implemented by institutions of higher learning. This article undertakes to do a historical appraisal of <b>development</b> <b>studies</b> as an academic discipline under the guidance of the following questions: (i) How <b>development</b> <b>studies</b> emerge as a (serious) academic discipline in institutions of higher learning; (ii) How these institutions of higher learning define “development” and “development studies”; and (iii) What are their objectives/rationale, methodology and scope? Through this historical appraisal, this article hopes to configurate a model of <b>development</b> <b>studies</b> that incorporates not only the substantive components (interdisciplinary subject matter) but also the praxis component (‘doing’ development through for example, immersion and advocacy) in order to make <b>development</b> <b>studies</b> a socially responsible and relevant field in development process and plannin...|$|R
