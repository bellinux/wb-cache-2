5|$|Delaware Route 202 (DE 202), {{also known}} as Concord Avenue, is a short state highway in Wilmington, Delaware.

5|$|Great mullein is a {{biennial}} {{and generally}} requires winter dormancy {{before it can}} flower. This dormancy is linked to starch degradation activated by low temperatures in the root, and gibberellin application bypasses this requirement. Seeds germinate almost solely in bare soil, at temperatures between 10°C and 40°C. While they can germinate in total darkness if proper conditions are present (tests give a 35% germination rate under ideal conditions), in the wild, they in practice only do so when exposed to light, or {{very close to the}} soil surface, which explains the plant's habitat preferences. While it can also grow in areas where some vegetation already exists, growth of the rosettes on bare soil <b>is</b> <b>four</b> to seven times more rapid.|$|E
5|$|His {{first study}} of {{mathematics}} began with papers by George Pólya {{and by the}} crystallographer Friedrich Haag on plane symmetry groups, sent {{to him by his}} brother Berend, a geologist. He carefully studied the 17 wallpaper groups, and created periodic tilings with 43 drawings of different types of symmetry. From this point on he developed a mathematical approach to expressions of symmetry in his art works using his own notation. Starting in 1937, he created woodcuts based on the 17 groups. His Metamorphosis I (1937) began a series of designs that told a story through the use of pictures. In Metamorphosis I, he transformed convex polygons into regular patterns in a plane to form a human motif. He extended the approach in his piece Metamorphosis III, which <b>is</b> <b>four</b> metres long.|$|E
