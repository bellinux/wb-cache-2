5|$|Both Malene Arpe of the Toronto Star and Daniel Fienberg of Zap2it were <b>disappointed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> episode's audio {{commentary}} featuring Jennifer Carpenter, Erik King, Lauren Vélez and David Zayas on {{the first}} season DVD.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reaction}} was generally favourable, with reviewers being {{impressed by the}} beauty of the graphics and the thrilling depiction of speed. They were however, slightly <b>disappointed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> shallow nature of the gameplay. A newer version of the arcade game was released in 2003, incorporating motion simulator technology into the arcade cabinet.|$|E
5|$|The {{reaction}} to the award was surprise, with the award's lack of reasoning a particular concern. The Venezuelans were keenly <b>disappointed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> outcome, though they honored their counsel for their efforts (their delegation's Secretary, Severo Mallet-Prevost, received the Order of the Liberator in 1944), and abided by the award.|$|E
25|$|The 2009 {{season was}} again very <b>disappointing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> club relegated from Tippeligaen and saved from {{liquidation}} {{at the very}} last moment.|$|R
50|$|Jen from TV Overmind gave a good {{review to}} the episode {{stating that the}} writers did not <b>disappoint</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{brothers}} reunion scene and {{it could not have}} been better.|$|R
5000|$|Intensive {{drilling}} {{has taken}} place in Chicontepec in recent years, starting with a contract for 500 new wells offered in December 2008. However, results in terms of output have been <b>disappointing,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> field still yielding a modest [...] in May 2012.|$|R
5|$|Although Brumund's {{publication}} included {{drawings of}} Borobudur, the Batavia Society still {{felt that it}} was incomplete. In April 1873, van Kinsbergen set off to the monument. Cleaning, digging and other technical difficulties delayed his start in taking pictures until August that year. The wet monsoon season further hampered his work, resulting in a series of only 43 photographs taken between August to December. The Society was <b>disappointed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> number of photographs, although satisfied with the printing and artistic quality.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge {{was also}} {{concerned}} with easing overland {{transport of goods}} to Virginia. In mid-1795, he, Robert Barr, Elijah Craig, and Harry Toulmin formed a committee {{to raise funds for}} a road connecting the Cumberland Gap to central Kentucky. Breckinridge was <b>disappointed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> quality of the route, which was finished in late 1796, concluding that the individual maintaining it was keeping most of the tolls instead of using them for the road's upkeep.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary critics gave {{mixed reviews}} of the DVD. Some were <b>disappointed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> low quality {{and the lack of}} clarity of the videos, while others praised the {{collection}} for being a reminder of Madonna as the visual artist. Celebration: The Video Collection debuted {{at the top of the}} Billboard Top Music Videos and the top of the DVD charts in Australia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Spain and Switzerland. It was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipment of 100,000 copies across United States.|$|E
50|$|After the {{previous}} season's {{run to the}} semi-final of the League Cup, the team's performance in that competition this season was very <b>disappointing,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Blues falling at the first hurdle, losing 2-1 to West Bromwich Albion {{in the third round}} tie played at The Hawthorns.|$|R
40|$|Despite reform efforts, the {{economic}} performance of Latin American countries during the 1990 s was <b>disappointing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> exception of Chile, which grew at almost 7 % per year. This paper {{tries to explain}} this difference. Following recent literature that hiEconomic growth, reforms, institutions, financial development...|$|R
50|$|The same {{presentation}} {{also points}} out that the telescope's location, only 115 km NW of Beijing, is far from ideal, being in an area with high levels of both atmospheric and light pollution. The telescope has generally been <b>disappointing,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> side receiving only 120 clear nights per year.|$|R
5|$|In 1852 Staunton {{published}} his book The Chess Tournament, which recounted {{in detail the}} efforts required to make the London International Tournament happen and presented all the games with his comments on the play. Unfortunately some of Staunton's comments {{in the book and}} in The Illustrated London News were intemperate, because he was <b>disappointed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> placing he achieved.|$|E
5|$|In January 2016, Avery Bradley left Mitchell Butler to {{sign with}} Pelinka after being <b>disappointed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> results of a {{contract}} extension. During the lead-up to the 2016 NBA draft, Buddy Hield, the consensus college {{player of the year}} in 2015–16, signed with Pelinka. Marquese Chriss also signed with Pelinka. Hield was drafted 6th and Chriss was selected 8th.|$|E
5|$|Also in the off-season, Gillis fired Luongo's goaltending coach Ian Clark {{and hired}} Roland Melanson in his place. Luongo {{had been a}} {{personal}} friend of Clark's and publicly stated being surprised and <b>disappointed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> switch. The decision to hire Melanson was largely precipitated on his willingness to work with Luongo on a full-time basis – something Clark was unable to do. Despite the coaching change at the club level, Luongo retained Clark as his personal coach for his summer training. He began working with Melanson {{leading up to the}} 2010–11 season and employed several changes in his playing style, which included playing deeper into his crease instead of challenging shooters.|$|E
25|$|Two {{trials of}} {{primidone}} for athetosis have been published. In one, small doses of primidone successfully treated eighteen out of thirty-one children. In a subsequent pilot trial {{in which children}} who experienced improvement were switched to placebo, the results were much more <b>disappointing,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> two subjects who experienced subjective improvement also experiencing this on placebo.|$|R
50|$|In the 2001-02 season, Gianluca Vialli {{was named}} as Taylor's {{managerial}} replacement. Vialli made several high-profile signings, and wage bills at <b>the</b> club soared, <b>with</b> Vialli himself earning {{almost a million}} pounds a year. However, <b>the</b> season was <b>disappointing,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> club finishing 14th in the division, and Vialli was sacked after only one season, having refused to resign.|$|R

5|$|As well as Thunderhawks, Anderson {{developed}} {{other ideas}} for a remake. A 1976 concept, Inter-Galactic Rescue 4, {{was to have}} featured a variable-configuration craft capable of performing rescues on land and sea, in air and in space; Anderson pitched the idea to NBC, who rejected it. This was followed in 1984 by another proposed updating, T-Force, which at first could not be pursued owing {{to a lack of}} funding. Development resumed in 1993, when it was decided to produce the series, now titled GFI, using cel animation. But Anderson was <b>disappointed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> results and the production was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Pei {{designed}} a new museum for Luxembourg, the Musée d'art moderne Grand-Duc Jean, {{commonly known as}} the Mudam. Drawing from the original shape of the Fort Thüngen walls where the museum was located, Pei planned to remove a portion of the original foundation. Public resistance to the historical loss forced a revision of his plan, however, and the project was nearly abandoned. The size of the building was halved, and it was set back from the original wall segments to preserve the foundation. Pei was <b>disappointed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> alterations, but remained involved in the building process even during construction.|$|E
5|$|Castro was {{initially}} <b>disappointed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> project {{as he did}} not want to solely imitate José's vocals, Ferrer's absence and his desire to record Jose's lesser known songs. According to Castro, it was the decisions of the executive producers of his record label, Universal Music Latino, to only have Botija produce the album and to record José José's more recognized songs. He later retracted his statement, commending Botija and referred to the disc as his best, only lamenting he could not record José's lesser known songs. José expressed satisfaction with the result.|$|E
25|$|From the beginning, Gilruth's plans did not {{progress}} as planned. He {{did his best}} to promote mining and agriculture, including the development of a meatworks in Darwin by the English firm, Vesteys. However, these attempts to achieve economic development proved <b>disappointing.</b> <b>With</b> <b>the</b> outbreak of World War I in August 1914, the Commonwealth government lost interest in development of the Northern Territory as Federal funds were diverted towards the war.|$|R
50|$|The {{modification}} {{of the tax code}} has left many local residents <b>disappointed</b> <b>with</b> both <b>the</b> county and WalMart, which was initially sold to the public as a source of tax revenue.|$|R
50|$|A {{profitable}} season also {{delivered in}} the Welsh Cup where Ystalyfera equalled their highest progress reaching the Third Round for the seventh time.Opportunity to achieve success in the elusive Swansea Valley cup proved <b>disappointing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> termination of the event due {{to the failure of}} participating teams to complete the fixtures.This season finished with great promise from an averagely young side, playing a fast positive style of play and much fun to watch.|$|R
5|$|Despite his partial {{recovery}} evident in America, Weber {{felt that he}} was unable to resume regular teaching at that time and continued on as a private scholar, helped by an inheritance in 1907. In 1909, <b>disappointed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Verein, he co-founded the German Sociological Association (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Soziologie, or DGS) and served as its first treasurer. He would, however, resign from the DGS in 1912. In 1912, Weber tried to organise a left-wing political party to combine social-democrats and liberals. This attempt was unsuccessful, in part because many liberals feared social-democratic revolutionary ideals.|$|E
5|$|Muhammad Ilyas, {{the founder}} of Tablighi Jamaat, {{wanted to create a}} {{movement}} that would enjoin good and forbid evil as the Qur'an decreed, as his teacher Rasheed Ahmad Gangohi dreamed of doing. The inspiration for this came during his second pilgrimage to Mecca in 1926. What he lacked in scholarly learning, presence, charisma or speaking ability, he made up for in zeal. He initially tried to establish a network of mosque-based religious schools to educate the Mewati Muslims about Islamic beliefs and practices. Shortly afterwards, he was <b>disappointed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> reality that these institutions were producing religious functionaries, but not preachers.|$|E
5|$|Paintings by Bellette {{were among}} those of twelve Australian artists {{included}} in the 1953 Arts Council of Great Britain exhibition in London, five regional British cities, and at the Venice Biennale. Bellette {{was one of only}} two women represented, the other being Constance Stokes. As with her Sulman prize-winners, Bellette's subjects were classically themed works: Electra (1944) and Oedipus (1945). Arts Council chairman Kenneth Clark was <b>disappointed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> response of British critics to the exhibition, and their focus on a theme of nationhood paid little regard to the works of Bellette and several others.|$|E
50|$|Taylor was {{replaced}} by Gianluca Vialli. Vialli made several high-profile signings, and wage bills at <b>the</b> club soared, <b>with</b> Vialli himself earning almost a million pounds a year. However, <b>the</b> season was <b>disappointing,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> club finishing 14th in the division, and Vialli was sacked after only one season, having refused to resign. He {{was replaced}} by Ray Lewington, {{who had come to}} the club the previous summer as Vialli's reserve team manager.|$|R
5000|$|In 1985 and 1986, Wynne was {{coach of}} West Perth. In his first seasons <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{recently}} christened [...] "Falcons", {{a policy of}} developing youth saw the club play finals {{for only the second}} time since 1978, but with crippling injury problems West Perth failed in the first semi-final against the experienced Swan Districts, led by a devastating display from Garry Sidebottom. 1986 was <b>disappointing,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Falcons winning only nine games plus a draw, and Wynne was replaced by Bruce Monteath for the 1987 season.|$|R
50|$|On July 1 2017, as a {{free agent}} from his <b>disappointing</b> tenure <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Sabres, Kulikov was signed to a three-year, $12.99 million {{contract}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Winnipeg Jets.|$|R
5|$|Reviews of the Nintendo DSi were {{generally}} positive; although IGN and bit-tech decried the console's lack of exclusive software and {{removal of the}} GBA cartridge slot, its added functionality caused many journalists to recommend it {{to those who had}} not purchased a previous DS model. Numerous critics were <b>disappointed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> limited resolution of DSi's cameras, though others such as Ars Technica and GameSpot agreed they were adequate for the handheld's display. CNET and PCWorld considered the DSi Shop {{to be the most important}} buying incentive for current DS owners. Some critics believed the DSi XL was not an essential upgrade. GamePro and Wired UK, on the other hand, praised the DSi XL's larger screens for improving the gaming experience and revitalizing older DS games.|$|E
5|$|Sagan {{revealed}} {{that he had been}} told on the radio that he had to ride hard {{to stay away from the}} chasing group, but that he had no power left in the final part of the race as he had done the majority of the work in the breakaway. Nevertheless, he said that he was happy with the race. Cancellara, meanwhile, said that, although he was <b>disappointed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> result in itself, he had pride in the way he had performed in coming back from his mechanical failure. After his long pursuit, with the help of several teammates in different groups, he had barely been able to follow the other riders in the group on the Tiegemberg.|$|E
5|$|The Champs Sports Bowl {{was thus}} forced to select Boston College. Boston College players and fans, {{owing to the}} {{decreased}} status of the Champs Sports Bowl {{when compared with the}} Orange, Chick-fil-A, and Gator Bowls, were <b>disappointed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> selection and match against Michigan State. Had Boston College won the ACC Championship Game, it would have earned the automatic bid to the Orange Bowl, and Virginia Tech would have been selected by the Chick-fil-A Bowl, which had earlier expressed an interest in inviting the Hokies to the game for a second straight year. Clemson would have been bumped down to the Gator Bowl, and Virginia would have been forced into the Champs Sports Bowl.|$|E
50|$|On May 19, the Saigon Heat {{and head}} coach Anthony Garbelotto {{mutually}} agreed to terminate his contract after a <b>disappointing</b> season <b>with</b> <b>the</b> ASEAN Basketball League team.|$|R
50|$|By 2004, {{the reformist}} sentiments {{that had led}} PDI-P to victory in the 1999 {{elections}} had died down. Many were <b>disappointed</b> <b>with</b> what <b>the</b> reform process had achieved thus far and were also <b>disappointed</b> <b>with</b> Megawati's presidency. This {{was reflected in the}} 2004 legislative election, PDI-P obtained 18.5% of the total vote, down from the 33.7% it obtained in1999.|$|R
25|$|In 1916, the Blackburn Aircraft Company {{designed}} and built two prototypes of an anti-submarine floatplane designated the Blackburn G.P. or Blackburn General Purpose. It was not ordered but Blackburn developed a landplane version as the Blackburn R.T.1 Kangaroo (Reconnaissance Torpedo Type 1). The first aircraft was delivered to Martlesham Heath in January 1918. Test results were <b>disappointing,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> rear fuselage being prone to twisting and the aircraft suffering control problems, {{which led to the}} order for fifty aircraft being cut to twenty, most of which were already partly built.|$|R
