The small intestine efficiently absorbs a range of dietary triglyceride, suggesting intestinal adaptation to various triglyceride intakes. In the current study, we analyze intestinal mRNA levels of proteins involved in intestinal triglyceride metabolism in lean and <b>diet</b> <b>induced</b> <b>obese</b> <b>mice.</b> <b>Obese</b> <b>mice</b> show increased intestinal adipose differentiation related protein, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, acyl-CoA oxidase, diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2, apolipoprotein A-IV, fatty acid transporter and liver fatty acid binding protein mRNA levels. We also analyzed mRNA levels of proteins involved in intestinal triglyceride metabolism in lean and <b>diet</b> <b>induced</b> <b>obese</b> <b>mice</b> {{in response to a}} high fat challenge. Lean mice have increased tail interacting protein of 47 kDa, adipose differentiation related protein, adipose triglyceride lipase, comparative gene identification 58, diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2, microsomal triglyceride transfer protein and fatty acid transporter mRNA levels post bolus. Conversely, <b>diet</b> <b>induced</b> <b>obese</b> <b>mice</b> do not have increased mRNA levels post bolus and lipolytic enzyme mRNA levels are decreased. Lipid droplet associated protein levels also dynamically increase and later decrease post bolus in lean mice.

40|$|To {{address the}} {{possible}} involvement of VGF peptides in obesity and diabetes, we studied {{type 2 diabetes}} (T 2 D) and obese patients, and high-fat <b>diet</b> <b>induced</b> <b>obese</b> <b>mice.</b> Two VGF peptides (NAPP- 19 and QQET- 30) were identified in human plasma by HPLC-ESI-MS. The VGF C-terminus, the above two cleaved peptides, and the TLQP- 21 related peptide/s were studied using ELISA and immunohistochemistry. In euglycemic patients, plasma NAPPE and TLQP like peptides were significantly reduced with obesity (74 ± 10 vs. 167 ± 28, and 92 ± 10 vs. 191 ± 19 pmol/ml, mean+SEM, n = 10 and 6, obese vs. normal BMI, respectively, p< 0. 03). Upon a standard glucose load, a distinct response was shown for VGF C-terminus, TLQP and QQET-like (ERVW immunoreactive) peptides in euglycemic normal BMI patients, but was virtually abolished in euglycemic obese, and in T 2 D patients independently of BMI. High-fat <b>diet</b> <b>induced</b> <b>obese</b> <b>mice</b> showed reduced plasma VGF C-terminus, NAPPE and QQET-like (ERVW) peptide/s (3 ± 0. 2 vs. 4. 6 ± 0. 3, 22 ± 3. 5 vs. 34 ± 1. 3, and 48 ± 7 vs. 100 ± 7 pmol/ml, mean+SEM, n = 8 /group, obese vs. slim, respectively, p< 0. 03), {{with a loss of}} the response to glucose for all VGF peptides studied. In immunohistochemistry, TLQP and/or VGF C-terminus antibodies labelled VGF containing perikarya in mouse celiac ganglia, pancreatic islet cells and thin beaded nerve fibres in brown adipose tissues, with fewer in white adipose tissue. Upon the glucose load, tyrosine hydroxylase and VGF C-terminus immunoreactive axons became apparent in pancreatic islets of slim animals, but not in obese animals. Alltogether, a significant loss of VGF peptide immunoreactivity and/or their response to glucose was demonstrated in obese patients, with or without T 2 D, in parallel with a similar loss in high-fat <b>diet</b> <b>induced</b> <b>obese</b> <b>mice.</b> An involvement of VGF in metabolic regulations, including those of brown and/or white adipose tissues is underlined, and may point out specific VGF peptides as potential targets for diagnosis and/or treatment...|$|R
40|$|Obesity is an {{underlying}} risk {{factor in the}} development of cardiovascular disease, dyslipidemia and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Increased hepatic lipid accumulation is a hallmark in the progression of NAFLD and impairments in liver phosphatidylcholine (PC) metabolism may be central to the pathogenesis. Hepatic PC biosynthesis, which is linked to the one-carbon (C 1) metabolism by phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase, is known to be important for hepatic lipid export by VLDL particles. Here, we assessed the influence of a high-fat (HF) diet and NAFLD status in mice on hepatic methyl-group expenditure and C 1 -metabolism by analyzing changes in gene expression, protein levels, metabolite concentrations, and nuclear epigenetic processes. In livers from HF <b>diet</b> <b>induced</b> <b>obese</b> <b>mice</b> a significant downregulation of cystathionine b-synthase (CBS) and an increased betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT) expression were observed. Experiments in vitro, using hepatoma cells stimulated with peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPARa) agonist WY 14, 643, revealed a significantly reduced Cbs mRNA expression. Moreover, metabolite measurements identified decreased hepatic cystathionine and L-a-amino-n-butyrate concentrations as part of the transsulfuration pathway and reduced hepatic betaine concentrations, but no metabolite changes in the methionine cycle in HF diet fed mic...|$|R
40|$|Obesity {{has been}} implicated as a {{significant}} risk factor for development of pancreatic cancer. In the setting of obesity, a systemic chronic inflammatory response is characterized by alterations in the production and secretion {{of a wide variety}} of growth factors. Leptin is a hormone whose level increases drastically in the serum of obese patients. High fat <b>diet</b> <b>induced</b> obesity in mice leads to an overall increased body weight, pancreatic weight, serum leptin, and pancreatic tissue leptin levels. Here we report the contribution of obesity and leptin to pancreatic cancer growth utilizing an in vivo orthotopic murine pancreatic cancer model, which resulted in increased tumor proliferation with concomitant increased tumor burden in the <b>diet</b> <b>induced</b> <b>obese</b> <b>mice</b> compared to lean mice. Human and murine pancreatic cancer cell lines were found to express the short as well as the long form of the leptin receptor and functionally responded to leptin induced activation through an increased phosphorylation of AKT 473. In vitro, leptin stimulation increased cellular migration which was blocked by addition of a PI 3 K inhibitor. In vivo, depletion of the leptin receptor through shRNA knockdown partially abrogated increased orthotopic tumor growth in <b>obese</b> <b>mice.</b> These findings suggest that leptin contributes to pancreatic tumor growth through activation of the PI 3 K/AKT pathway, which promotes pancreatic tumor cell migration...|$|R
40|$|Obesity is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} condition characterized by activation and infiltration of proinflammatory immune cells and a dysregulated production of proinflammatory cytokines. While {{known as a}} key regulator of immune natural killer (NK) cell function and development, we have recently demonstrated that reduced expression of the cytokine Interleukin- 15 (IL- 15) is closely linked with increased body weight and adiposity in mice and humans. Previously, we and others have shown that obese individuals have lower circulating levels of IL- 15 and NK cells. Lean IL- 15 overexpressing (IL- 15 tg) mice had an accumulation in adipose NK cells compared to wildtype and NK cell deficient obese IL- 15 (-/-) mice. Since IL- 15 induces weight loss in IL- 15 (-/-) and <b>diet</b> <b>induced</b> <b>obese</b> <b>mice</b> and has effects on various lymphocytes, {{the aim of this}} paper was to determine if lymphocytes, particularly NK cells, play a role in IL- 15 mediated weight loss. Acute IL- 15 treatment resulted in an increased accumulation of NK, NKT, and CD 3 (+) T cells in adipose tissue of B 6 mice. Mice depleted of NK and NKT cells had similar weight loss comparable to controls treated with IL- 15. Finally, IL- 15 treatment induces significant weight loss in lymphocyte deficient RAG 2 (-/-) γc(-/-) mice independent of food intake. Fat pad cross-sections show decreased pad size with cytokine treatment is due to adipocyte shrinkage. These results clearly suggest that IL- 15 mediates weight loss independent of lymphocytes...|$|R
40|$|Eotaxin is an {{important}} inflammatory chemokine in eosinophil chemotaxis and activation and, thus, is implicated in asthma. Recently, obesity was {{associated with an increased}} prevalence of asthma, but the relationship between obesity and eotaxin expression has only been partially understood in <b>obese</b> <b>mice</b> and human studies. Therefore, we studied the expression patterns of eotaxin in 3 T 3 -L 1 preadipocytes/adipocytes to determine whether eotaxin levels are influenced by body weight gain and/or reduction in diet-induced <b>obese</b> <b>mice.</b> First, we investigated eotaxin expression during differentiation in 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes. Then, we treated 3 T 3 -L 1 preadipocytes/adipocytes with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), eotaxin, interleukin (IL) - 4, IL- 5, or leptin. To examine the effects of weight loss in high-fat <b>diet</b> <b>induced</b> <b>obese</b> <b>mice,</b> we fed C 57 BL/ 6 mice a high-fat diet or a normal diet for 26 weeks. Then, half of the high-fat diet group were fed a normal diet until 30 weeks to reduce weight. Epididymal adipose tissue, visceral adipose tissue, serum, and bronchoalveolar fluid of mice were examined for eotaxin expression. The results showed that eotaxin expression levels increased with adipocyte differentiation and that more eotaxin was expressed when the cells were stimulated with TNF-α, eotaxin, IL- 4, IL- 5, or leptin. An in vivo study showed that eotaxin levels were reduced in visceral adipose tissues when high-fat diet fed mice underwent weight loss. Taken together, these results indicate a close relationship between eotaxin expression and obesity as well as weight loss, thus, they indirectly show a relation to asthma...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Obesity is {{characterized}} by excessive fat mass and is associated with serious diseases such as type 2 diabetes. Targeting excess fat mass by sustained lipolysis {{has been a major}} challenge for anti-obesity therapies due to unwanted side effects. TLQP- 21, a neuropeptide encoded by the pro-peptide VGF (non-acronymic), that binds the complement 3 a receptor 1 (C 3 aR 1) on the adipocyte membrane, is emerging as a novel modulator of adipocyte functions and a potential target for obesity-associated diseases. The molecular mechanism is still largely uncharacterized. Methods: We used a combination of pharmacological and genetic gain and loss of function approaches. 3 T 3 -L 1 and mature murine adipocytes were used for in vitro experiments. Chronic in vivo experiments were conducted on diet-induced obese wild type, β 1, β 2, β 3 -adrenergic receptor (AR) deficient and C 3 aR 1 knockout mice. Acute in vivo lipolysis experiments were conducted on Sprague Dawley rats. Results: We demonstrated that TLQP- 21 does not possess lipolytic properties per se. Rather, it enhances β-AR activation-induced lipolysis by a mechanism requiring Ca 2 + mobilization and ERK activation of Hormone Sensitive Lipase (HSL). TLQP- 21 acutely potentiated isoproterenol-induced lipolysis in vivo. Finally, chronic peripheral TLQP- 21 treatment decreases body weight and fat mass in <b>diet</b> <b>induced</b> <b>obese</b> <b>mice</b> by a mechanism involving β-adrenergic and C 3 a receptor activation without associated adverse metabolic effects. Conclusions: In conclusion, our data identify an alternative pathway modulating lipolysis that could be targeted to diminish fat mass in obesity without the side effects typically observed when using potent pro-lipolytic molecules...|$|R
40|$|Background: Hepatic {{ischemia}} and reperfusion injury (IRI) {{is a major}} complication in liver surgery, and {{hepatic steatosis}} is a primary factor aggravating cellular injury during IRI. Both pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are key mediators of hepatic IRI. Ischemic preconditioning (IpreC), remote ischemia preconditioning (RIPC) and ischemic postconditioning (IpostC) have offered protections on hepatic IRI, but all these methods have their own shortcomings. Grape seed proanthocyanidins (GSP) has {{a broad spectrum of}} pharmacological properties against oxidative stress. Thus, GSP has potential protective effects against hepatic IRI. Methods: C 57 BL/ 6 mice suffering 30 mins hepatic ischemia process were sacrificed after 1 h reperfusion to build murine warm hepatic IRI model. The mice were injected GSP intraperitoneally 10, 20, 40 mg/kg/day for 3 weeks as pharmacological preconditioning. <b>Obese</b> <b>mice</b> fed with high-fat diet for 24 weeks before used. Three pathways related to IRI, including ROS elimination, pro-inflammatory cytokines release and hypoxia responses were examined. Results: Our data show that GSP could significantly reduce hepatic IRI by protecting hepatocyte function and increasing the activity of ROS scavengers, as well as decreasing cytokines levels. At the same time, GSP also enhance the hypoxia tolerance response. Combined GSP and postconditioning can provided synergistic protection. In the <b>obese</b> <b>mice</b> suffering hepatic IRI group, GSP was more effective than postconditioning on protecting liver against IRI, and the combined strategy was obviously superior to the solo treatment. Conclusion: GSP could protect liver against IRI: particularly in high-fat <b>diet</b> <b>induced</b> <b>obese</b> <b>mice.</b> GSP used as pharmacological preconditioning and combined with other protocols have huge potential to be used in clinical. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background/Aims: Liver X receptors (LXR) is key {{transcription}} {{factor in the}} regulation of lipid and cholesterol metabolism, in addition, LXRα has been implicated as regulator of inflammation. LXRα activation is associated with hepatic steatosis and hyperlipidemia in mice. Fenofibrate, a PPARα agonist and omega- 3, an antihypertriglyceride agent, lead to a reduction of hyperlipidemia. The {{aim of this study}} to investigate whether concurrent effect of LXRα and fenofibrate or omega- 3 can produce synergic benefits in high-fat <b>diet</b> <b>induced</b> <b>obese</b> <b>mice.</b> Methods: Normal chow and high-fat diet mice treated with LXRα agonist (T 0901317), or combined fenofibrate or omega- 3 for 4 weeks. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed on liver tissue extracts after animal sacrifice. SREBP 1 c, FAS, SCD- 1, PPAR-α, and MCP- 1 mRNA expressions were assessed with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Results: LXRα agonist increase intrahepatic fat amount in normal chow group. Degree of intrahepatic inflammation was not different among LXRα agonist, or combined with fenofibrate/omega- 3. In NAFLD model, the combined treatment with fenofibrate did not increase hepatic steatosis. LXRα agonist and/or fenofibrate or omega- 3 decreased intrahepatic inflammation. In high-fat diet groups, combined treatment with fenofibrate markedly reduced the expression of genes involved in lipogenesis, including srebp- 1 c, fas and scd 1. Furthermore, LXRα agonist and/or fenofibrate or omega 3 treatment decreased expression of abca- 1, abcg 5, and abcg 8 genes, three vital genes for cholesterol efflux in <b>diet</b> <b>induced</b> fatty liver model, but those expressions were opposite in normal chow group. Intraheptic MCP- 1, and TNF-α expression and markers of inflammasome were also decreased in NAFLD group.

40|$|The obesity {{epidemic}} {{is on the}} rise, and currently represents the largest global health threat. Westernization and advances in food production {{have led to a}} contemporary diet comprised of 49 % energy from carbohydrates, 35 % from fats and 16 % from proteins. Former studies have demonstrated the weight-reducing benefits of increasing the amount of dietary protein at the expense of sucrose in high-fat diets, but the impact of specific proteins has not been elucidated. An unpublished study from our group discovered that different protein sources exert dissimilar obesogenic effects in mice when included in a high-protein diet. While proteins from pork promoted obesity development and proteins from cod had an intermediate effect, casein was the only protein to protect against diet-induces obesity. Moreover, the study registered a higher energy intake in the mice fed pork compared to the mice fed cod. We undertook our current study to investigate the obesogenic effect of different proteins and the satiating effect of cod proteins in a high-fat high-protein diet. Additionally, we aimed to expound on the various mechanisms by which different proteins affect obesity development. Thus, obesity-prone C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were fed high-fat high-protein diets with casein, cod or pork as the protein source, with one pork group being pair fed with the group fed cod. Furthermore, we found it interesting to explore the weight-reducing effects of the same protein sources on <b>diet</b> <b>induced</b> <b>obese</b> <b>mice.</b> Hence, <b>obese</b> C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were fed low-fat diets with casein, cod or pork as the protein source. In agreement with earlier studies, our results demonstrated that casein was the only protein to attenuate the obesogenic effect of a high-fat diet. On the contrary, mice fed pork gained a significant amount of fat mass and had an impaired glucose tolerance. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that cod-protein had an intermediate effect. In contrast to previous observations, the cod proteins did not promote satiety in a higher degree than proteins from pork. In our second animal experiment, we observed a significantly higher weight loss and an improved glucose tolerance in <b>obese</b> <b>mice</b> fed a low fat diet with casein. Collectively, our results underscore that the dietary protein source is an important factor to abrogate the development of obesity, and implies that it might be beneficial {{to increase the amount of}} dietary casein at the expense of pork proteins...|$|R
40|$|Radix Pueraria lobata (RP) {{has been}} {{reported}} to prevent obesity and improve glucose metabolism; however, the mechanism responsible for these effects has not been elucidated. The mechanism underlying anti-obesity effect of RP was investigated in high-fat <b>diet</b> (HFD) <b>induced</b> <b>obese</b> <b>mice</b> and skeletal muscle cells (C 2 C 12). Five-week-old C 5 BL/ 6 mice were fed a HFD containing or not containing RP (100 or 300 mg/kg) or metformin (250 mg/kg) for 16 weeks. RP reduced body weight gain, lipid accumulation in liver, and adipocyte and blood lipid levels. In addition, RP dose-dependently improved hyperglycemia, insulinemia, and glucose tolerance, and prevented the skeletal muscle atrophy induced by HFD. Furthermore, RP increased the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator- 1 alpha (PGC- 1 α) expression and phosphorylation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in skeletal muscle tissues. RP and its main component, puerarin, increased mitochondrial biogenesis and myotube hypertrophy in C 2 C 12 cells. The present study demonstrates that RP can prevent diet-induced obesity, glucose tolerance, and skeletal muscle atrophy in mouse models of obesity. The mechanism responsible for the effect of RP appears {{to be related to the}} upregulation of energy metabolism in skeletal muscle, which at the molecular level may be associated with PGC- 1 α and AMPK activation...|$|R

Here, we investigated the effects of ARA on obesity and glucose intolerance by examining energy metabolism in skeletal muscle and brown fat in high-fat <b>diet</b> (HFD) <b>induced</b> <b>obese</b> <b>mice.</b> ARA decreased body weight gain, hepatic lipid levels and serum total cholesterol levels, but did not modify food intake.

In addition, the numbers of brown adipocytes and the expressions of PGC 1 α and uncoupling protein 1 (UCP 1) were elevated in the brown adipose tissues of ARA treated mice.

In this study, we examined its effects on the development of type 2 diabetes by using adipocyte-specific HIF- 1 α knockout (ahKO) mice. ahKO mice showed improved glucose tolerance compared with wild type (WT) mice. Macrophage infiltration and mRNA levels of monocyte chemotactic protein- 1 (MCP- 1) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) were decreased in the epididymal adipose tissues of high fat <b>diet</b> <b>induced</b> <b>obese</b> ahKO <b>mice.</b> The results indicated that the obesity-induced adipose tissue inflammation was suppressed in ahKO mice.

Interestingly, adiponectin, whose serum levels were increased in the <b>obese</b> ahKO <b>mice</b> compared with the <b>obese</b> WT <b>mice,</b> stimulated GLP- 1 secretion from cultured intestinal L cells. Therefore, insulin secretion may have been enhanced through the adiponectin-GLP- 1 pathway in the ahKO mice.

On the other hand, the chronic inflammatory status in the male genital tract may directly impair spermatogenesis and is even associated with male subfertility.

To address this question, we used a high fat <b>diet</b> (HFD) <b>induced</b> <b>obese</b> <b>mouse</b> model and recruited obese patients from the clinic. We detected increased levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), and NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing- 3 (NLRP 3) in genital tract tissues including testis, epididymis, seminal vesicle, prostate, and serum from <b>obese</b> <b>mice.</b> Meanwhile, the levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and corticosterone {{were significantly higher than}} those in the control group in serum.

For overweight and obese male patients, the increased levels of TNF-α and IL- 6 were also observed in their seminal plasma.

Here we aimed to use the splicing factor SRSF 1 that contribute to the production of these different isoforms as a target to uncover new anti-obesity drug. Subjects/Methods: Small molecules modulating SR protein activity and splicing, we re tested for their abilities to interact with SRSF 1 and to modulate LMNA (AS). Using an LMNA luciferase reporter we selected molecules that were tested in <b>Diet</b> <b>Induced</b> <b>Obese</b> (DIO) <b>mice.</b> Transcriptomic analyses were performed in the white adipose tissues from untreated and treated DIO mice and mice fed a chow diet. Results: We identified a small molecule that specifically interacted with the RS domain of SRSF 1.

A global transcriptomic analysis revealed similar profiles of White adipose tissue (WAT) from DIO mice treated with ABX 300 and from untreated mice fed a chow diet. Mice treated with ABX 300 exhibited an increase in O 2 consumption and a switch in fuel preference toward lipids.

Thus, {{we hypothesized}} that CSE/H 2 S system regulates lipolysis which contributed to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. We treated rat adipocyte with DL-propargylglycine (PAG, a CSE inhibitor), L-cysteine (an H 2 S precursor) plus pyridoxial phosphate (co-enzyme) or the H 2 S chronic release donor GYY 4137, then the glycerol level was assayed for assessing the lipolysis. Then, the effects of PAG and GYY 4137 on insulin resistance in high fatty <b>diet</b> (HFD) <b>induced</b> <b>obese</b> <b>mice</b> were investigated. Here, we found that PAG time-dependently increased basal or isoproterenol stimulated lipolysis. However, L-cysteine plus pyridoxial phosphate or GYY 4137 significantly reduced it. PAG increased phosphorylated protein kinase A substrate, perilipin 1 and hormone sensitive lipase, but L-cysteine and GYY 4137 decreased the parameters. In HFD <b>induced</b> <b>obese</b> <b>mice,</b> PAG increased adipose basal lipolysis, thus blunted fat mass increase, resulting in lowering insulin resistance evidenced by reduction of fasting glucose, insulin level, HOMA index, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) curve area and elevating the insulin tolerance test (ITT) response. GYY 4137 inhibited lipolysis in vivo without increasing fat mass, but also ameliorated the insulin resistance in HFD mice. These results implicated that inhibition endogenous CSE/H 2 S system in adipocytes increased lipolysis by a protein kinase A-perilipin/hormone-sensitive lipase pathway, thus blunted fat mass increase and reduced insulin resistance in obese mice; giving H 2 S donor decreased lipolysis, also reduced insulin resistance induced by HFD. Our data showed that increase or decrease H 2 S induced opposite lipolysis, but had {{the same effect on}} insulin resistance.

Here, we investigated the role of sirtuins, especially the adipose-tissue abundant SIRT- 2 on transition from early to late sepsis in obese with sepsis. Sepsis was induced using cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) in ob/ob mice. We measured microvascular inflammation in response to lipopolysaccharide/normal saline re-stimulation as a "second-hit" (marker of immune function) at different time points to track phases of sepsis in ob/ob mice. We determined SIRT- 2 expression during different phases of sepsis. We studied the effect of SIRT- 2 inhibition during the hypo-inflammatory phase on immune function and 7 -day survival. We used a RAW 264. 7 (RAW) cell model of sepsis for mechanistic studies. We confirmed key findings in <b>diet</b> <b>induced</b> <b>obese</b> (DIO) <b>mice</b> with sepsis. We observed that the ob/ob-septic mice showed an enhanced early inflammation and a persistent and prolonged hypo-inflammatory phase when compared to WT mice. Unlike WT mice that showed increased SIRT 1 expression, we found that SIRT 2 levels were increased in ob/ob mice during hypo-inflammation. SIRT- 2 inhibition in ob/ob mice during the hypo-inflammatory phase of sepsis reversed the repressed microvascular inflammation in vivo via activation of endothelial cells and circulating leukocytes and significantly improved survival. We confirmed the key finding {{of the role of}} SIRT 2 during hypo-inflammatory phase of sepsis in this project in DIO-sepsis mice.

HFD-fed mice became hyperglycemic after 2 months of feeding regimen. Metformin treatment following hyperglycemia slowed body weight gain and restored systemic glucose levels to control levels. Retinal function measured by ERG showed decreased amplitudes and delayed implicit times in oscillatory potentials after 1 month of HFD and decreased amplitudes and delayed implicit times in a-wave, b-wave, and oscillatory potentials starting 2 months of HFD. Metformin treatment after 2 months of HFD was not able to restore ERG responses in HFD-fed mice. Furthermore, metformin treatment was not able to recover HFD-induced neovascularization.

40|$|<b>Diet</b> <b>induced</b> <b>obese</b> (DIO) <b>mice</b> can be {{stratified}} {{according to}} their weight gain in response to high fat diet as low responders (LDR) and high responders (HDR). This allows the study of β-cell failure and the transitions to prediabetes (LDR) and early diabetes (HDR). C 57 BL/ 6 N mice were fed for 8 weeks with a normal chow diet (ND) or a high fat diet and stratified as LDR and HDR. Freshly isolated islets from ND, LDR and HDR mice were studied ex-vivo for mitochondrial metabolism, AMPK activity and signalling, the expression and activity of key enzymes of energy metabolism, cholesterol synthesis, and mRNA profiling. Severely compromised glucose-induced insulin secretion in HDR islets, as compared to ND and LDR islets, was associated with suppressed AMP-kinase activity. HDR islets also showed reduced acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity and enhanced activity of 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, which led respectively to elevated fatty acid oxidation and increased cholesterol biosynthesis. HDR islets also displayed mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarization and reduced ATP turnover {{in the presence of}} elevated glucose. Expression of protein kinase Cε, which reduces both lipolysis and production of signals for insulin secretion, was elevated in DIO islets. Genes whose expression increased or decreased by more than 1. 2 -fold were minor between LDR and ND islets (17 differentially expressed), but were prominent between HDR and ND islets (1508 differentially expressed). In HDR islets, particularly affected genes were related to cell cycle and proliferation, AMPK signaling, mitochondrial metabolism and cholesterol metabolism. In conclusion, chronically reduced AMPK activity, mitochondrial dysfunction, elevated cholesterol biosynthesis in islets, and substantial alterations in gene expression accompany β-cell failure in HDR islets. The β-cell compensation process in the prediabetic state (LDR) is largely independent of transcriptional adaptive changes, whereas the transition to early diabetes (HDR) is associated with major alterations in gene expression...|$|R

Recent works aim at developing dual PPAR α/γ agonists devoid of the side effects of the antidiabetic agents thiazolidinediones and the dual-agonists glitazars. We studied the molecular mechanism of action of a new compound, LT 175, and the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism in cell and animal models. In cell-based assays LT 175 activates both PPARα and PPARγ. Because of the unique structural properties of the ligand-receptor complex, we studied the coregulator recruitment by FRET, which revealed that LT 175 activates both PPARα and PPARγ. Because of the unique structural properties of the ligand-receptor complex, we studied the coregulator recruitment by FRET, which revealed that LT 175 is a full PPARα and a partial PPARγ agonist. We tested the biological activity of LT 175 in mouse adipocytes, showing lower lipid accumulation than the PPARγ full agonist rosiglitazone, which may be explained by the lower expression of genes for fatty acid uptake (CD 36) and glycerol 3 -phosphate formation (PEPCK and GYK). Using PPRE-LUC reporter mice we showed that LT 175 switches on the PPAR-dependent transcription program in typical target tissues. Administration of LT 175 to <b>Diet</b> <b>Induced</b> <b>Obese</b> (DIO) <b>mice</b> decreases plasma glucose, insulin, Non-Esterified Fatty Acids (NEFA), triglycerides and cholesterol while it increases adiponectin and FGF 21 levels, ameliorating the metabolic profile and insulin sensitivity. Data obtained by RT-qPCR in DIO and db/db mice show that LT 175 enhances the expression of PPAR target genes in the liver and adipose tissue. LT 175, opposite to rosiglitazone, does not increase the expression of renal sodium transporter ENaCγ, which is involved in fluid retention. These results indicate that LT 175 has favourable effects on glucose and lipid metabolism with a reduction of some of the major side-effects and could therefore represent a new PPAR ligand with a more favourable profile as compared to glitazones.

40|$|The {{cannabinoid}} receptor 2 (CB 2) {{is well known}} for its immune modulatory role. However, recent localisation of CB 2 receptors in metabolically active tissue suggests that the CB 2 receptor plays a significant role in energy homeostasis. This study was designed to investigate the impact of chronic CB 2 receptor stimulation on food intake, body weight and mood. Lean male C 57 BL/ 6 mice were injected i. p. with the selective CB 2 receptor agonist, JWH- 015 (0. 0, 1. 0, 5. 0 and 10. 0 mg kg- 1) to establish dose response parameters. Mice made obese following exposure to a diet consisting of 19. 4 MJ/kg (4641 Kcal/kg) of energy (19. 0 % protein, 21. 0 % total fat, 4. 7 % crude fiber, and 4. 7 % AD fiber were given either vehicle or 10 mg/kg JWH- 015. Impact on mood, food intake, body weight, plasma metabolites, expression of key metabolic proteins in the brown adipose tissue (BAT) and white adipose tissue (WAT), and markers of inflammation were measured. High dose (10 mg/kg) JWH- 015 reduced food intake after 1, 2, 4, and 24 h in lean mice. When given to <b>diet</b> <b>induced</b> <b>obese</b> (DIO) <b>mice,</b> a 10 mg/kg dose of JWH- 015 significantly reduced body weight compared to vehicle. This dose led to a shift in markers of lipid metabolism and inflammation in WAT consistent with lipolysis and improved immune response. Furthermore, JWH- 015 (10 mg/kg) produced a transient reduction in food intake and significant reduction in fat mass and adipocyte cell size. Importantly, JWH- 015 produced an anxiolytic response in the elevated plus maze while having no effect on immobility time in the forced swim test. It should be noted that though the 10 mg/kg dose produced positive effects on the obese state, the possibility that these effects are mediated via non-CB 2 receptor mechanisms cannot be ruled out.

40|$|In {{the general}} population, {{one in five}} couples {{experiences}} difficulty in conceiving a child. The role of obesity on women’s fecundity has become a focus of attention in recent years. Successful treatment of infertility through Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) is also compromised {{by the presence of}} obesity, which occurs in 30 % of women seeking treatment. A negative correlation exists between increased body mass index (BMI) and the number of collected oocytes and a lower birth rate after ART. Furthermore, {{a number of studies have}} established that weight loss improves natural conception rates in overweight women. Whether weight management can improve success rates in overweight / obese women undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) has not been studied. The purpose of this project was to explore the role of short–term weight loss on potential pregnancy outcomes in overweight / obese women undergoing IVF programme. However, to establish this relationship, we proposed to carry out two studies to assess the following: (I) The feasibility of very low calorie diet (VLCD) during IVF treatment with respect to duration, level of restriction and tolerability of the diet during hormonal down regulation in women (Chapter 2). (II) How energy restriction may affect the quality of an early embryo in <b>diet</b> - <b>induced</b> <b>obese</b> <b>mice</b> with respect to various body weight and caloric intake (Chapter 3). In study (I), women preferred a shorter dietary intervention with greater energy restriction (456 kcal per day) to gradual energy restriction (1200 kcal / day for the first week, and afterward, 456 kcal / day) prior to oocyte transfer. Women were able to comply with the VLCD during IVF treatment and both dietary groups achieved a significant weight loss (mean 6. 3 %). In study (II), by using <b>obese</b> <b>mice,</b> the effect of rapid weight loss (mean 12 %) was observed after 5 days of energy restriction. Ovulation rate was greater in the Obese group (HFD) (55. 6 %) and equal in both Control (CD) and Energy Restricted (HF / ER) (44. 4 %) groups. The HF / ER group showed higher fertilisation rate (80 %) than HFD and CD (55 % and 45. 5 %, correspondingly). The blastocyst stage was reached by half of the cultured embryos in both HF / ER and HFD groups and 33 % in the CD group. The quality of embryos that completed blastocyst formation did not differ between groups. However, postfertilisation development in females fed a high fat diet was slower compared to CD and HF / ER groups. In conclusion, this work illustrated a weight management prior conception and use of VLCD during IVF treatment in clinical study needs further investigation with regard to the dietary duration, level of energy restriction and how this combination will influence IVF treatment outcomes. Furthermore, as we were unable to determine the question of how the dietary intervention affects the quality of oocytes and the animal study illustrated a promising result, thus further studies are required.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of obesity is reaching epidemic proportions {{and is one of}} the major healthcare problems worldwide. Bariatric surgery is the only treatment option with a satisfying efficacy, but is, given its invasiveness, only suitable for morbidly obese patients. Therefore, there is an unmet need for new therapies for the treatment of obesity. Food intake is mainly regulated in the central nervous system, but relies on input from the periphery, including neural and hormonal signals from the gut in response to the nutritional state. Gut peptide hormone plasma levels fluctuate in response to luminal nutrient availability and are crucial in gut-brain communication. In addition, changes in secretion and motor patterns further contribute to appetite signaling. Bariatric surgery results in an efficacious body weight loss and is accompanied by restoration of postprandial plasma gut peptide hormone levels (ghrelin, GLP- 1, PYY), known to be dysregulated in obesity. These changes are thought to be involved in the beneficial effects of bariatric surgery on body weight and food intake. Targeting the release of gut peptides to influence food intake might be a valuable, non-invasive alternative for bariatric surgery. Bitter taste receptors (TAS 2 Rs) on the tongue detect potentially toxic substances and prevent ingestion by eliciting aversive reactions. Recently, these receptors have been found in tissues other than the oral cavity, suggesting additional functions besides the judgment of food quality. Previous work from our group has described the expression of the bitter taste receptor associated G-protein subunit α-gustducin in ghrelin producing cells of the mouse stomach. Intra-gastric delivery of bitter compounds resulted in rises in plasma ghrelin levels, accompanied by a short lasting increase in food intake. This was however followed by a longer lasting decrease in food intake, correlating with a decrease in gastric emptying rate. The latter was shown to be independent of anorexigenic gut peptide release, and was suggested to involve a direct effect on smooth muscle. These results suggest a possible role of intestinal TAS 2 Rs in the regulation of appetite. This PhD-project consisted of two major aims. The first aim was to verify whether smooth muscle of the gut also expresses TAS 2 Rs, and whether bitter agonists affect intestinal motility in vitro and in vivo. The second aim was to study the involvement of the gustatory signaling pathway in the development of obesity, and to verify whether prolonged treatment with bitter agonists would influence body weight gain and food intake in <b>obese</b> <b>mice.</b> In the first part, mRNA expression of TAS 2 Rs and the full canonical taste signaling pathway was demonstrated in smooth muscle tissue of the mouse gut and in cultured human gastric smooth muscle cells. Some bitter agonists induced concentration- and region-dependent contractility changes in intestinal smooth muscle strips. These were further characterized for denatonium benzoate (DB) in mouse fundic smooth muscle strips. DB induced contractions at lower concentrations and relaxations at higher concentrations. The contractions were mediated via a taste-signaling dependent pathway, involving increases in intracellular Ca 2 + originating from both intracellular and extracellular sources. The contraction was partially masked through activation of a hyperpolarizing K+-efflux. The relaxation at higher concentrations was most likely TAS 2 R-independent. In human gastric smooth muscle cells, DB or chloroquine induced concentration-dependent rises in intracellular Ca 2 +-levels and ERK-phosphorylation. Intra-gastric administration of DB in mice delayed gastric emptying via a TAS 2 R-mediated pathway. Finally, healthy volunteers receiving an intra-gastric infusion of DB had an impaired gastric accommodation reflex and showed a decreased nutrient volume intake and early satiation. Our results demonstrate that bitter tastants can directly influence contractility of smooth muscle, and also have in vivo effects on intestinal motility. It remains however to be demonstrated whether the effects seen in vivo are directly mediated through effects on smooth muscle or also involve endocrine effects. Nevertheless, these results suggest that targeting extra-oral TAS 2 Rs may be of therapeutic value for the treatment of gastrointestinal motility disorders or obesity. In the second part of this PhD-project we aimed to elucidate whether targeting the gustatory signaling pathway and more specifically TAS 2 Rs may interfere with the development of obesity. α-gustducin-/- (α-gust-/-) mice gained less weight on a high-fat diet than wild type mice, despite an increased food intake. Correspondingly, these mice had a decreased mass of white adipose tissue and decreased plasma levels of leptin. In addition mRNA expression of uncoupling protein 1, the thermogenic gene that is the hallmark of brown adipocytes, was increased in white adipose tissue of α-gust-/- mice and resulted in an increased heat production in these mice. Our findings therefore suggest that the gustatory signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of browning of white adipose tissue resulting in an increased heat production and decreased body weight gain in α-gust-/- mice. Daily intra-gastric treatment of high-fat <b>diet</b> <b>induced</b> <b>obese</b> <b>mice</b> with bitter agonists (DB or quinine) for 4 weeks resulted in an α-gustducin-dependent decrease in body weight gain, with minor changes in food intake for DB but not quinine. Postprandial plasma levels of the gut peptides only changed modestly and are unlikely to explain the bitter agonist induced changes in body weight. The presence of mTas 2 Rs and α-gustducin was demonstrated in white adipose tissue and in a pre-adipocyte cell line, 3 T 3 -F 442 A. Treatment of pre-adipocytes with DB or quinine resulted in an inhibition of differentiation, demonstrating a direct effect of bitter agonists on adipocyte metabolism. In conclusion, the gustatory signalling pathway seems involved in the induction of diet-induced obesity, through its involvement in the regulation of WAT browning. Intra-gastric bitter treatment inhibits weight gain, possibly by directly affecting adipocyte metabolism. To conclude, this thesis has contributed to our knowledge regarding the expression and function of extra-oral bitter taste receptors. TAS 2 Rs seem to be omnipresent in the human body and appear to fulfill a wide range of functions, of which not all have been uncovered. Some of the proposed functions of TAS 2 Rs, e. g. the activation of the innate immune system in the airways, serve to protect the body from toxic substances or invading pathogens and are thus analogue to the function of TAS 2 Rs on the tongue. In other tissues, e. g. the testis, the function of TAS 2 Rs remains speculative. Notwithstanding their sometimes unclear role, TAS 2 Rs might emerge as therapeutic targets in a wide range of disorders, including, as shown by us, obesity and gastrointestinal motility disorders. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|From {{a medical}} perspective, obesity {{may be defined}} as a degree of {{relative}} adiposity sufficient to derange metabolic physiology in a manner that negatively impacts the health of the individual. While population-based cut points based on body mass index (BMI) are frequently used as a means of identifying such individuals, this is an imprecise approach since the critical levels of adiposity in this regard differ substantially among individuals. Our common genetic predisposition to increased adiposity, coupled with an environment conducive to positive energy balance results in an increasing prevalence of human obesity. Weight loss, even when initially successful, is very difficult to maintain due, in part, to a feedback system involving metabolic, behavioral, neuroendocrine and autonomic responses that are initiated to maintain somatic energy stores (fat) at a level considered `ideal' by the central nervous system (CNS). Circulating leptin is an important afferent signal to the CNS relating peripheral energy stores with modulations in key leptin sensing area sensitivity possibly implicated in the functional and molecular basis of defense of body weight. These physiological responses, which include increased metabolic efficiency at lower body weight, may be engaged in individuals at different levels of body fat depending on their genetic makeup, as well as on gestational and post-natal environmental factors that have determined the so-called "set-point". In the work presented in this dissertation the following aspects of the physiology of the defense of body weight were explored: 1) whether levels (thresholds) of defended adiposity can be raised or lowered by environmental manipulation; 2) the physiological and molecular changes that mediate increased metabolic efficiency following weight loss, 3) leptin's role in setting the threshold; 4) the effects of ambient temperature on metabolic phenotypes of weight perturbed to assess whether torpor contributes to metabolic adaptation; and 5) whether changes in gut microbiota accompany changes in diet composition and/or body weight. To assess whether the threshold for defended body weight could be increased or decreased by environmental manipulations (i. e. high fat diet and weight restriction), we identified bioenergetic, behavioral, and CNS structural responses of C 57 BL/ 6 J in long term <b>diet</b> <b>induced</b> <b>obese</b> (DIO) male <b>mice</b> to weight reduction. We found that maintenance of a body weight 20 % below that imposed by a high fat diet results in metabolic adaptation - energy expenditure below that expected for body mass and composition - and structural changes of synapses onto arcuate pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) cell bodies. These changes are qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those observed in weight-reduced animals that were never obese, suggesting that the previously obese animals are now "defending" a higher body weight. Maintenance of a lower body weight for more than 3 months was not accompanied by remission of the increased metabolic efficiency. Thus, the consequence of long term elevation of body weight suggests an increase in defended body fat that does not abate with time. Mice can enter torpor - a state of decreased metabolic rate and concomitant decrease in body temperature - as a defense mechanism in times of low caloric availability and/or decreased ambient room temperatures. Declines in circulating leptin concentrations and low ambient room temperature have both been implicated in the onset of torpor. To assess the effects of ambient room temperature and leptin concentrations on metabolic adaptation, we characterized C 57 BL/ 6 J and leptin deficient (Lepob) mice following weight perturbation at both 22 °C and 30 °C ambients. Weight-reduced C 57 BL/ 6 J mice show metabolic adaptation at both ambient temperatures and do not enter torpor whereas weight-reduced Lepob animals readily enter torpor at 22 °C. This suggests that sufficiently high absolute leptin concentrations may impede the onset of torpor and that torpor itself does not contribute to metabolic adaptation in mice that have an intact leptin axis. To assess whether hyperleptinemia per se was capable of increasing the threshold for defended body weight, leptin was infused by minipumps into C 57 BL/ 6 J mice for 18 weeks and body weight and metabolic parameters were studied following cessation of leptin infusion. Leptin infused mice did not defend elevated body weights compared to PBS infused mice suggesting that leptin alone may not be capable of setting the threshold for body weight defense implying that other changes accompanying obesity (i. e. increased free fatty acids, endoplasmic reticulum stress and/or inflammation of leptin-sensitive neural areas) are implicated. A caveat and possible confound to this study is the possibility of antibody production against the exogenous leptin that could have drastically decreased the amount of bioavailable leptin in these mice. This experiment did not assess antibody production but subsequent studies should do so. Finally, gut microbiota have been implicated in the regulation of body weight possibly by impacting insulin resistance, inflammation, and adiposity via interactions with epithelial and endocrine cells. We assessed changes in relative abundances of cecal microbiota in mice following sustained changes in body weight and diet composition. In diet-induced <b>obese</b> (DIO) <b>mice,</b> we find that weight reduction resulted in shifts in specific bacteria abundance (Akkermansia and Mucispirillum) and that these changes were correlated with leptin concentrations. Leptin modulates mucin production in the gut possibly altering local microniches for certain bacteria providing a functional link between adiposity and gut-specific changes in bacterial populations. Overall, the major findings of these experiments are that the threshold for body weight defense can be raised but not lowered, that metabolic adaptation observed in weight-reduced mice is not a result of torpor, and that hyperleptinemia (if no anti-bodies were produced) per se isolated from other obesity-related changes does not appear capable of raising the threshold...|$|R

Adiponectin, an adipokine, {{has been shown to}} have antidiabetic effects by improving fat oxidation and glucose uptake. PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of adiponectin incubation, in high fat <b>diet</b> <b>induced</b> <b>obese</b> rats, on measures of skeletal muscle substrate metabolism including glycogen, glucose transporter 4 (GLUT 4), lipid, and mitochondrial contents. METHODS: Male Sprague Dawley rats were fed a Western-style (21 % fat by weight; 41 % total energy) high fat diet for 9 weeks to induce obesity, then, for 6 weeks, either continued the Western Diet (WD) or were fed a standard Chow Diet (WCD) (4. 8 % fat; 0. 74 % saturated; 2 % mono; 1. 77 % poly); a control group followed a 15 -week chow diet (CD). Following the 15 -week diet intervention, right and left hind-leg extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles were incubated in an organ bath (Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing 2000 mg/L glucose) with or without 0. 1 mg/ml adiponectin for 30 minutes. Glycogen content was measured with periodic acid-schiff staining, GLUT 4 (ab 654), lipid (bodipy), and mitochondrial (ab 14744) contents were measured using immunohistochemical techniques and quantified with imageJ software. RESULTS: There were no changes in substrate concentrations with adiponectin incubation in any diet group. However, the change (D) in glycogen, with adiponectin, was greater in animals fed a control chow diet compared to animals that followed a 15 -week high fat Western-style diet (WD) (change (D); CD: 0. 11 ± 0. 07 vs. WD: - 0. 25 ± 0. 14; one-way ANOVA p= 0. 048). When change in lipid content, after adiponectin treatment, was compared, animals fed high fat diets showed impaired preservation of lipid compared to the control group (change (D); CD: 25. 9 ± 11. 2 vs. WD: - 21. 1 ± 14. 8 p= 0. 02; CD: 25. 9 ± 11. 2 vs. WCD: - 18. 8 ± 7. 7 p= 0. 02).

Methods: Rats were randomly divided into seven groups: (i) non-obese control (NOB), (ii) Obese control (OB), (iii) orlistat (50 mg/ kg; p. o.), (iv) ethyl acetate extract of Commiphora mukul (gum resin) (200 mg/kg; p. o.), (v) ethanolic extract of Lagenaria siceraria (fruit) (200 mg/kg; p. o.) were examined individually, (vi) C. mukul and L. siceraria (200 mg/kg; p. o.) and (vii) C. mukul and L. siceraria (400 mg/kg; p. o.) extracts were administered in combination {{to the high}} fat-diet-induced obese rats for 30 days to evaluate its synergistic activity. Results: For synergistic effect, after combination treatment caused most significant (P< 0. 001) reduction in body weight, fasting blood glucose, serum levels of cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL, VLDL and increase levels of HDL. Conclusions: The result demonstrated that combination C. mukul and L. siceraria has ameliorated the high fat <b>diet</b> <b>induced</b> obesity...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was to {{investigate}} the anti-obesity effects of the freeze dried powder of ethanolic extract of Licorice (Glycyrrhiza Glabra) (LP) in a rat model of high-fat <b>diet</b> <b>induced</b> obesity and hyperlipidemia. Male wistar rats were fed with a high-fat diet for 8 weeks to induce obesity and hyperlipidemia. High fat <b>diet</b> <b>induced</b> <b>obese</b> rats exhibited increases in body weight gain, adipose tissue mass and levels of serum glucose, triglycerides and total cholesterol compared to rats fed a normal chow diet. However, administration of LP (100 - 400 mg/kg, o. d., p. o) along with high-fat diet for 8 weeks significantly reduced high fat diet-induced increases in body weight gain and adipose tissue mass in a dose dependant manner. Moreover, LP attenuated high fat <b>diet</b> <b>induced</b> increased levels of serum glucose, triglycerides and total cholesterol. The antiobesity effects of LP were comparable to orlistat, a well reported pancreatic lipase inhibitor. The antiobesity activity of LP appears to be mediated by decreasing dietary fat absorption from the intestine as LP dose dependently attenuated the raisin...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Angiogenesis {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} to modulate adipogenesis and obesity. This study was undertaken {{to determine whether the}} botanical drug ALS-L 1023 (ALS), which exhibits antiangiogenic activity, can regulate adipose tissue growth in high-fat-diet-induced <b>obese</b> <b>mice.</b> Materials and Methods: The effects of ALS on angiogenesis and extracellular matrix remodeling were measured using in vitro assays. The effects of ALS on adipose tissue growth was investigated in nutritionally <b>obese</b> <b>mice.</b> Results: ALS inhibited angiogenesis in a concentration-dependent manner in the tube formation assay and the VEGF-induced proliferation assay using human umbilical vein endothelial cells. ALS also suppressed matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity in vitro. ALS administration to high-fat-diet-induced <b>obese</b> <b>mice</b> significantly reduced body weight gain, adipose tissue mass, and adipocyte size compared with the findings in the controls. ALS treatment decreased blood vessel density and MMP activity in adipose tissues. ALS reduced the mRNA levels of angiogenic factors (VEGFs and FGF- 2) and MMPs (MMP- 2 and MMP- 9), whereas it increased the mRNA levels of angiogenic inhibitors (TSP- 1 and TIMPs) in adipose tissues. Conclusion: These results suggest that in vivo and in vitro treatment with ALS, which has antiangiogenic and MMP inhibitory activities, reduces adipose tissue mass in nutritionally <b>induced</b> <b>obese</b> <b>mice,</b> providing evidence that adipose tissue growth can be regulated by angiogenesis inhibitors...|$|R
40|$|Obesity is {{prevalent}} {{worldwide and}} is a major risk factor for the development and progression of kidney disease. Hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) {{plays an important role}} in renal physiological and pathophysiological processes. However, whether H 2 S is able to mitigate kidney injury induced by obesity in mice remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that H 2 S significantly reduced the accumulation of lipids in the kidneys of high fat diet- (HFD-) <b>induced</b> <b>obese</b> <b>mice.</b> The results of hematoxylin and eosin, periodic acid-Schiff, and Masson’s trichrome staining showed that H 2 S ameliorated the kidney structure, decreased the extent of interstitial injury, and reduced the degree of kidney fibrosis in HFD-induced <b>obese</b> <b>mice.</b> We found that H 2 S decreased the expression levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin- (IL-) 6, and monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 but increased the expression level of IL- 10. Furthermore, H 2 S treatment decreased the protein expression of p 50, p 65, and p-p 65 in the kidney of HFD-induced <b>obese</b> <b>mice.</b> In conclusion, H 2 S is able to mitigate renal injury in HFD-induced <b>obese</b> <b>mice</b> through the reduction of kidney inflammation by downregulating the expression of nuclear factor-kappa B. H 2 S or its releasing compounds may serve as a potential therapeutic molecule for obesity-induced kidney injury...|$|R
