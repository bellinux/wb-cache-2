500|$|Entertainment website Bollywood Hungama {{reported}} that Kalki Koechlin {{was set to}} star in Menon's upcoming film. The published reports revealed that Koechlin would be {{playing the role of}} the young, brash, and social-media-savvy Tara Deshpande. Koechlin's co-star from That Girl in Yellow Boots (2011) and Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara (2011), Naseeruddin Shah, joined the cast after he was approached by Menon, who sent him the film's script in an e-mail. Shah, who did not have any prior knowledge of Menon's work, accepted the male lead role in the film. To prepare for the role, Koechlin worked on the dialect in which her character spoke, an amalgamation of Hindi and English. She also dyed her hair black for the role, as Menon wanted <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> more [...] "earthy". In an interview with Gulf News, Koechlin said she loved the film's vibe and compared it to the American drama Lost In Translation (2003). In a separate e-mail interview with Arti Daniel of The Khaleej Times, Shah said that Waiting was his way of making up to the audience for the spate of [...] "ghastly movies" [...] that he did in 2014.|$|E
500|$|Koechlin {{appeared}} alongside Parineeti Chopra, Richa Chadda, and Bhumi Pednekar in Y-Films's mini web-series Man's World, a satire {{on gender}} roles. The series {{was released on}} YouTube in April 2015. She then starred in Anu Menon's Waiting, an independent film {{about the relationship between}} two people who befriend each other in a hospital, while nursing their respective comatose spouses. Koechlin played the role of Tara Deshpande, a young and brash social media-savvy. She dyed her hair black for the role, as Menon wanted <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> more [...] "earthy". The film had its world premiere at the Dubai International Film Festival (DIFF) in December 2015, and had its theatrical release in India on 27 May 2016. The film and her performance received positive critical reviews. Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com called the film [...] "absolutely riveting", and also lauded the [...] "stunningly unhindered" [...] Koechlin writing that she used her aura, [...] "in the most mesmeric fashion to create a woman we sympathise with and wish well for". Film critic Kunal Guha thought that film belonged to Koechlin who, [...] "impresses by managing to wordlessly convey her character's state of mind in every scene".|$|E

500|$|Hollywood-based Mark Garbarino was Chopra's makeup artist. At first, {{they wanted}} <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> exactly like Kom by using {{prosthetic}} makeup. Chopra did a prosthetic {{test in the}} United States which included heavier eyelids for a more East-Asian look. However, the final result did not appeal to the makers. Also, the prosthetic would not hold during filming of the heavy-action boxing scenes. It was later reported that Chopra's look would be created post production by using visual effects. However, the results were unsatisfactory and hence this idea was also dropped. Chopra said [...] "We tried a bunch of stuff – Visual effects, prosthetics, makeup, [...] it looked too gimmicky. That's when {{we decided to go}} with just carrying the essence of the film, rather than the outer, cosmetic part." [...] Later, Uday Shirali, Chopra's makeup artist since Agneepath (2012), was hired. For creating boxing scars, makeup artist Subhash Shinde was employed. His biggest challenges were to make the fight marks look as realistic as possible as it required {{a lot of time and}} detailing. He stated, [...] "Every punch or scar needed to look real, change colour and age with time on screen, and shouldn't look like they were created using makeup." [...] He did some research by visiting hospitals to understand more about skin injuries.|$|E

The egg contains video clips of a man calling himself The Doctor, having half of a conversation with the viewer. Larry gives Sally a list of the DVDs and she leaves for the police station. There she meets DI Billy Shipton, who explains that there have been several disappearances at Wester Drumlins and shows her an impound lot containing a locked fake police box. Sally leaves but remembers the Yale key and returns to find that Billy and the phone box have disappeared. She immediately receives a call from a much older Billy, who is on his death bed at the hospital. She visits him and he explains that after she left the lot, he discovered the Angels trying to retrieve the police box. He then suddenly found himself in 1969, where he met the Doctor and was asked to relay a message to Sally decades later. Billy subsequently married and started a video production house that was responsible for putting the Easter egg on the DVDs. Before Billy dies he tells Sally the Doctor's message, which instructs <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at the list. Sally realises that the list is her own DVD collection and that the Easter egg is meant for her.|$|E
500|$|Gordimer says Rosa's role {{in society}} is {{imprinted}} on her from a young age by her activist parents, and she grows up {{in the shadow of}} her father's political legacy. Scholar Carol P. Marsh-Lockett writes that everyone sees Rosa as Lionel Burger's daughter with duties and responsibilities to her father, and not Rosa the individual. In fulfilling these expectations, she denies herself an identity of her own. JanMohamed says it is only when Conrad encourages <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> beyond her self-sacrifices that Rosa starts examining the conflicts in her life, namely her commitment to help others versus her desire for a private life. In an attempt to resolve these conflicts, Rosa contemplates turning to blacks, but she is wary of this because, according to the book's anonymous narrator, white South Africans tend to use blacks as a way [...] "of perceiving sensual redemption, as romantics do, or of perceiving fears, as racialists do". JanMohamed notes that Rosa's father was a romantic who established genuine friendships with blacks to overcome his [...] "sensual redemption", but she is unsure of where she stands. Visel says that Rosa's only way to free herself from these commitments to her family and the revolution is to [...] "defect" [...] and go to France. John Cooke, in his essay [...] "Leaving the Mother's House", notes that [...] "By putting her defection in such stark terms, Gordimer makes her strongest statement of the need, whatever the consequence, of a child to claim a life of her own".|$|E
