He told website Idolator that he was [...] "absolutely livid", and added, [...] "If I was going around and selling the same track to the biggest artists in the world, <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>would</b> my career last?

He is also known for asking bizarre questions such as [...] "If you were to carpet Florida, <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>would</b> it take to vacuum it?" [...] and [...] "If a monkey were to bite you, what kind of drugs do you suppose they'd give you?". He annoys Joe, Brian, Lowell and Antonio when he wins a charity contest sponsored by Sandpiper and demands to be flown to Las Cruces, New Mexico, far beyond the scope of Sandpiper's routes.|$|E
2500|$|On June 22, 2014, Savant made {{an error}} in a word problem. [...] The {{question}} was: If two people could complete a project in six hours, <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>would</b> it take each of them to do identical projects on their own, given that one took four hours longer than the other? Her answer was 10 hours and 14 hours, reasoning that if together it took them 6 hours to complete a project, then the total effort was 12 [...] "man hours". If they then each do a separate full project, the total effort needed would be 24 hours, so the answer (10+14) needed to add up to 24 with a difference of 4. However, this {{ignores the fact that}} the two people get different amounts of work done per hour: if they are working jointly on a project, they can maximize their combined productivity, but if they split the work in half, one person will finish sooner and can't fully contribute. This subtlety causes the problem to require solving a quadratic equation and thus to not have a rational solution, instead the answer is approximately 10.32 and 14.32 hours (or more precisely, [...] and [...] ). Savant later acknowledged the error.|$|E
