50|$|Fully {{chromium-plated}} bumpers {{were provided}} {{instead of the}} previous black and chromium edged type and the standardization of Magna type wheels with large section tyres helped {{the appearance of the}} car. The <b>instrument</b> <b>board</b> and other interior woodwork were redesigned. The windscreen was centrally controlled and was given dual wipers working from the bottom. The rear quarter windows were hinged to open. The upholstery was redesigned and could be had in all leather or in a combination of cloth and leather.

Advertisements for the OE when introduced in 1922 noted the electric lighting now included six lamps, an <b>instrument</b> <b>board</b> lamp and gauges together with both an electric horn and a bulb horn. By 1927 the advertised equipment was limited to: bucket-shaped front seats adjustable for leg room; wire wheels and Dunlop cord tyres, two spare wheels and tyres; spring gaiters; luggage grid and windscreen wiper (singular).|$|E

40|$|A cubesat {{attitude}} control system (ACS) was designed at the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) to provide sub-degree pointing capabilities using low cost, COTS attitude sensors, COTS miniature reaction wheels, and a developmental micro-propulsion system. The ACS sensors and actuators were integrated onto a 3 D-printed plastic 3 U cubesat breadboard (10 cm x 10 cm x 30 cm) with a custom designed <b>instrument</b> <b>board</b> and typical cubesat COTS hardware for the electrical, power, and data handling and processing systems. In addition to the cubesat development, a low-cost air bearing was designed and 3 D printed in order to float the cubesat in the test environment. Systems integration and verification were performed at the MSFC Small Projects Rapid Integration & Test Environment laboratory. Using {{a combination of both}} the miniature reaction wheels and the micro-propulsion system, the open and closed loop control capabilities of the ACS were tested in the Flight Robotics Laboratory.

40|$|Abstract—Gaze {{tracking}} {{is crucial}} for studying driver’s attention, detecting fatigue, and improving driver assistance systems, {{but it is difficult}} in natural driving environments due to nonuniform and highly variable illumination and large head movements. Traditional calibrations that require subjects to follow calibrators are very cumbersome to be implemented in daily driving situations. A new automatic calibration method, based on a single camera for determining the head orientation and which utilizes the side mirrors, the rear-view mirror, the <b>instrument</b> <b>board,</b> and different zones in the windshield as calibration points, is presented in this paper. Supported by a self-learning algorithm, the system tracks the head and categorizes the head pose in 12 gaze zones based on facial features. The particle filter is used to estimate the head pose to obtain an accurate gaze zone by updating the calibration parameters. Experimental results show that, after several hours of driving, the automatic calibration method without driver’s corporation can achieve the same accuracy as a manual calibration method. The mean error of estimated eye gazes was less than 5 ◦ in day and night driving. Index Terms—Calibration, gaze tracking, head orientation. I...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} is directed towards {{development of a}} chip-scale timing unit (clock) {{to be used in}} new systems that aim to improve {{the quantity and quality of}} data transmittal from small spacecrafts. The quantity and quality of data transmission are directly influenced by the speed and accuracy of the on-board clock. NASA roadmap identifies major technical challenges for space clocks using current technologies (i. e., quartz resonators), namely sensitivity to on-board thermal environment conditions and susceptibility to g-force, and ionizing radiation effects. The timing units developed under this project will enhance the current Small Satellites capabilities. With this technology Small Sats can make big contributions and pioneer an industry for future military, civilian, and commercial missions. The proposed approach directly tackles the stated technical challenges by developing a chip-scale all silicon integrated clock that has 10 x better frequency stability compared to quartz-based clocks and 100 x lower acceleration sensitivity at 10 x higher speed. It is based on a new generation of phonon traps/resonators that are both passively and actively compensated to reach unprecedented frequency accuracy and stability. The proposed timing unit is stable across a wide range of temperatures. Recent measurements from a CubeSat indicate a temperature variation of - 40 to 120 degree C for solar panels in geo orbit. For the main <b>instrument</b> <b>board,</b> the temperature is controlled at - 2 to - 10 degree C using thermal insulation to maintain the thermal fluctuation at a minimum. Assuming the timing unit experiences a worst case temperature fluctuation of - 40 to + 40 degree C, the frequency output can be maintained stable to less than 2 ppb using a feedback control loop. To do so, the proposed system includes a single phonon trap that exhibits two modes with significantly different temperature coefficient of frequencies (TCFs). In the feedback control loop, the dual mode oscillator is phase-locked at a stable operating point, where the phonon trap resonator is heated to a desired oven-set temperature. The proposed performance cannot be obtained from any other current, or planned product, with a solution that offers high science value through a small-size (The low SWaP of the proposed system makes it an ideal candidate for CubeSats of as small as one unit (1 U) with size of 10 x 10 x 10 cm 3. The low weight of the proposed clocks is several orders of magnitude smaller than the total weight of 1 U to 3 U CubeSats (1 kg up to 5 kg total), and its power consumption is a negligible fraction of the total system power (1 W up to 6 W (3 U)) ...|$|E
