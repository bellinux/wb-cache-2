We also prove that the inverse deformation/displacement jump of a defect line is independent of the cut-surface when its g. <b>disclination</b> <b>strength</b> vanishes. An explicit formula for the displacement jump of a single localized composite defect line in terms of given g. disclination and dislocation strengths is deduced based on the Weingarten theorem for g. disclination theory (Weingarten-gd theorem) at finite deformation.

The incompatibility is measured by the Riemann curvature tensor, which we find to be nonzero for both radial hedgehog defects and escaped <b>disclinations</b> of <b>strength</b> + 1 in circular cylinders. Analogous problems for conventional nonlinearly elastic solids do not possess solutions with such incompatibilities.

40|$|The isochoric {{extension}} of a cylindrical, nematic-elastomeric specimen is studied. Numerical solutions {{of the resulting}} boundary-value problem predict that, for sufficiently large extensions, there exists a region surrounding the cylinder axis wherein molecular asphericity vanishes.

Astate of this type corresponds to a <b>disclination</b> of <b>strength</b> + 1 located along the cylinder axis. The disclination core is associated with the region of vanishing asphericity, in which the polymeric molecules are shaped as spherical coils, and the core radius is taken to be the location of the energy drop. At a generic point outside of the core radius, the polymeric molecules are shaped as ellipsoidal coils of revolution oblate about the cylinder radius. For realistic values of the material parameters, the energy criterion yields a core of approximately 0. 015 µm, which is consistent with observations in conventional liquid-crystal melts. ...|$|R

The material exhibits an energetic preference for states involving a <b>disclination</b> of <b>strength</b> + 1 along the cylinder axis surrounded by a region in which the conformation of the polymer chains is indeed biaxial. We show that such states represent minimizers of the total free-energy. Also, the reactive pressure necessary to enforce the constraint of material incompressibility within the disclination core {{is found to be}} reduced by an order of magnitude when the conformation is biaxial rather than uniaxial. A bifurcation analysis is used to analytically determine the thresholds of axial expansion and contraction at which the material prefers a disclinated state.

For sufficiently large extensions, there exists an isotropic core of material surrounding the cylinder axis where the asphericity vanishes and in which the polymeric molecules are shaped as spherical coils. This region, corresponding to a <b>disclination</b> of <b>strength</b> + 1 manifesting itself along the axis, is bounded by a narrow transition layer across which the asphericity drops rapidly and attains a nontrivial negative value.

Along with the area of steeply changing asphericity between isotropic and anisotropic regimes, a marked drop in the free-energy density is observed. The boundary of the disclination core is associated with the location of this energy drop. For realistic choices of material parameters, this criterion yields a core on the order of 10 − 2 μm, which coincides with observations in conventional liquid crystal melts.

40|$|International audienceDisclinations in nematic liquid {{crystals}} usually adopt {{a straight}} shape {{in order to}} minimize their elastic energy. Once created {{in the course of a}} nonequilibrium process such as a temperature quench from the isotropic to the nematic phase, the topologically stable <b>disclinations</b> of half-integer <b>strength</b> either annihilate each other in pairs of opposite strength or form topologically unstable <b>disclinations</b> of integer <b>strength.</b> In this article, we demonstrate that the annihilation process can be inhibited and the defects can be deformed by an applied electric field. We study the disclination lines in the deep uniaxial nematic phase, located at the boundary between two different types of walls, the so-called π wall (a planar soliton stabilized by the surface anchoring) and the Brochard-Léger (BL) wall stabilized by the applied electric field. By changing the electric voltage, one can control the energy of director deformations associated with the two walls and thus control the deformation and dynamics of the disclination line. At small voltages, the disclinations are straight lines connecting the opposite plates of the cell, located at the two ends of the π walls. The π walls tend to shrink. When the voltage increases above EF, the Fréedericksz threshold, the BL walls appear and connect pairs of disclinations along a path complementary to the π wall. At E> 2 EF, the BL walls store sufficient energy to prevent shrinking of the π walls. Reconstruction of the three-dimensional director configuration using a fluorescent confocal polarizing microscopy demonstrates that the disclinations are strongly bent in the region between the π and the BL walls. The distortions and the related dynamics are associated with the transformation of the BL wall into two surface disclination lines; we characterize it experimentally as a function of the applied electric field, the cell thickness, and the sample temperature. A simple model captures the essential details of the experimental data...|$|R

The objectives are {{to explore the}} mechanisms for the generation of disclinations in a nonhomogeneous flow and to study the coupling between the flow and the polymer configuration. The Doi theory, generalized to spatially varying flows and approximated by the quadratic closure, is used to model the evolution of LCP configurations. This, along with the equations of motion for the fluid, is solved by a finite-element method. The flow modification by the polymer stress is mild for the parameters used, but the LCP exhibits complex orientational behavior in {{different regions of the}} flow domain. For relatively weak nematic strength, a steady state is reached in which the director is oriented either along or transverse to the streamline, depending upon local flow conditions and the deformation history. A pair of <b>disclinations,</b> with <b>strength</b> 61 / 2, are identified in the steady state, and the LCP configuration at the disclinations confirms the model of a structured defect core proposed by Greco and Marrucci ~ 1992 !.

40|$|Abstract. The {{anisotropic}} mechanical {{response of}} f. c. c. metals deformed up to large strains at low homologous temperatures {{is controlled by}} interfaces, namely by fragment and grain boundaries. The proposed model starts from initial grain orientations and the corresponding slip rates as predicted by a full constraints (FC) Taylor code. It describes the cell structure development on the microscopic scale and the fragment structure development on the mesoscopic scale in terms of evolution equations for dislocation densities in the twelve f. c. c. slip systems and for disclination densities in six fragment boundary families, respectively. The redundant dislocation densities (or: the cell walls) and the immobile <b>disclination</b> densities and <b>strengths</b> (or: the fragment boundary triple junctions) are connected to critical resolved shear stress (CRSS) contributions.

40|$|The authors {{develop a}} theory for {{uniaxial}} nematic elastomers with variable asphericity. As {{an application of}} the theory, they consider the time-independent, isochoric radial expansion of a right circular cylinder. Numerical solutions to the resulting differential equation are obtained {{for a range of}} radial expansions. For all expansions considered, there exists an isotropic core of material surrounding the cylinder axis where the asphericity vanishes and in which the polymeric chains are shaped as spherical coils. This region, corresponding to a <b>disclination</b> of <b>strength</b> + 1 along the axis, is bounded by a narrow transition layer across which the asphericity increases rapidly and attains a non-trivial positive value. The material thereby becomes anisotropic away from the disclination so that the polymeric chains are shaped as ellipsoidal coils of revolution prolate about cylinder radius. In accordance with the area of steeply changing asphericity between isotropic and anisotropic regimes, a marked drop in the free-energy density is observed. The boundary of the disclination core is associated with the location of this energy drop. For realistic choices of material parameters, this criterion yields a core on the order of 10 {sup - 2 } {micro}m, which coincides with observations in conventional liquid-crystal melts. Also occurring at the core boundary, and further confirming its location, are sharp transitions in the behavior of the constitutively determined contributions to the deformational stress and a change in the pressure. Furthermore, the constitutively determined contribution to the orientational stress is completely concentrated at the core boundary.

40|$|Axial {{orientation}} of discotic columnar liquid crystals in nanopores of inorganic templates, with the columns {{parallel to the}} axis of the nanochannels, is considered desirable for applications such as production of molecular wires. Here, we evaluate experimentally {{the role of the}} rigidity of the LC columns in achieving such orientation in nanopores where the planar anchoring (i. e., columns parallel to wall surface) is enforced. We studied the columnar phase of several discotic compounds with increasing column rigidity in the following order: dendronized carbazole, hexakis(hexyloxy) triphenylene (HAT 6), a 1 : 1 HAT 6 -trinitrofluorenone (TNF) complex, and a helicene derivative. Using 2 -D X-ray diffraction, AFM, grazing incidence diffraction, and polarized microscopy, we observed that the {{orientation of}} the columns changes from circular concentric to axial with increasing column rigidity. Additionally, when the rigidity is borderline, increasing pore diameter can change the configuration from axial back to circular. We derive expressions for distortion free energy that suggest that the orientation is determined by the competition between, on the one hand, the distortion energy of the 2 -d lattice and the mismatch of its crystallographic facets with the curved pore wall in the axial orientation and, on the other hand, the bend energy of the columns in the circular configuration. Furthermore, the highly detailed AFM images of the core of the <b>disclinations</b> of <b>strength</b> + 1 and + 1 / 2 {{in the center of the}} pore reveal that the columns spiral down to the very center of the disclination and that there is no amorphous or misaligned region at the core, as suggested previously...|$|R

The existence of these two kinds of defects points toward the complex nature {{of the structure of}} the B 7 phase, which is at the same time a columnar and a smectic phase. Our observations fit the model [M.

However, we demonstrate that the gradient flow dynamics for this energy is not able to adequately describe defect evolution. Motivated by similarity with dislocation dynamics in solids, a novel 2 D-model of disclination dynamics in nematics is proposed. The model is based on the extended Oseen-Frank energy and takes into account thermodynamics and the kinematics of conservation of defect topological charge. We validate this model through computations of disclination equilibria, annihilation, repulsion, and splitting.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we studied nematic liquid {{crystals}} using molecular dynamics simulations {{based on the}} coarse grained Gay-Berne potential. The elastic and dynamical properties of the nematic bulk were calculated {{and the impact of}} the system size and simulation run time were investigated showing that both have to be considered carefully. For the bend fluctuations we observed propagating modes for the director and velocity components. This contradicts statements found in the literature that assume these modes are overdamped. We derive from nematodynamics that this assumption may not be valid for all systems and hence we argue that propagating modes may be observed in experiments. Furthermore we studied defect structures forming due to nanoparticle inclusions in nematics. Depending on the particle size and the surface anchoring three different defect types were observed: Saturn ring, surface-ring and boojum defects. The satellite defect was found to be unstable for the particle sizes studied here, which is in agreement with theoretical predictions. For two nanoparticles in close proximity entangled defects formed, similar to experimental observations for micron sized particles. We explain the three-ring structure, which was observed in other molecular simulations, as a superposition of the different entangled states. Finally we calculated the line tension and viscous drag of a single <b>disclination</b> line of <b>strength</b> - 1 / 2. Nanoparticles placed in close proximity of the single disclination experienced highly non-linear attractive forces.

40|$|The {{theory and}} {{computation}} of line defects {{are discussed in}} the context of both solids and liquid crystals. This dissertation includes four parts. The Generalized Disclination theory is discussed and applied to numerous interfacial and bulk line defect problems. An augmented Oseen-Frank energy as well as a novel 2 D-model is proposed and demonstrated for disclination dynamics in liquid crystal. A model based on kinematics and thermodynamics is devised to predict tactoid dynamics during the process of the isotropic-nematic phase transition in LCLC. In {{the first part of the}} thesis, the utility of the notion of generalized disclinations in materials science is discussed within the physical context of modeling interfacial and bulk line defects. The Burgers vector of a disclination dipole in linear elasticity is derived, clearly demonstrating the equivalence of its stress field to that of an edge dislocation. An explicit formula for the displacement jump of a single localized composite defect line in terms of given g. <b>disclination</b> and dislocation <b>strengths</b> is deduced based on the Weingarten theorem for g. disclination theory at finite deformation. The Burgers vector of a g. disclination dipole at finite deformation is also derived. In the second part, a numerical method is developed to solve for the stress and distortion fields of g. disclination systems. Problems of small and finite deformation theory are considered. The fields of various line defects and grain/phase boundary problems are approximated. It is demonstrated that while the far-field topological identity of a dislocation of appropriate strength and a disclinationdipole plus a slip dislocation comprising a disconnection are the same, the latter microstructure is energetically favorable. This underscores the complementary importance of all of topology, geometry, and energetics (plus kinetics) in understanding defect mechanics. It is established that finite element approximations of fields of interfacial and bulk line defects can be achieved in a systematic and routine manner, thus contributing to the study of intricate defect microstructures in the scientific understanding and predictive design of materials. In the third part, nonsingular disclination dynamics in a uniaxial nematic liquid crystal is modeled within a mathematical framework where the kinematics is a direct extension of the classical way of identifying these line defects with singularities of a unit vector field representing the nematic director. We devise a natural augmentation of the Oseen-Frank energy to account for physical situations where infinite director gradients have zero associated energy cost, as would be necessary for modeling half-integer <b>strength</b> <b>disclinations</b> within the framework of the director theory. A novel 2 D-model of disclination dynamics in nematics is proposed, which is based on the extended Oseen-Frank energy and takes into account thermodynamics and the kinematics of conservation of defect topological charge. We validate this model through computations of disclination equilibria, annihilation, repulsion, and splitting. In the fourth part, the isotropic-nematic phase transition in chromonic liquid crystals is studied. We simulate such tactoid equilibria and dynamics with a model using degree of order, a variable length director as state descriptors, and an interfacial descriptor. We introduce an augmented Oseen-Frank energy, with non-convexity in both interfacial energy and the dependence of the energy on the degree of order. A strategy is devised based on continuum kinematics and thermodynamics. The model is used to predict tactoid dynamics during the process of phase transition. We reproduce observed behaviors in experiments and perform an experimentally testable parametric study of the effect of bulk elastic and tactoid interfacial energy constants on the interaction of interfacial and bulk fields in the tactoids...|$|R
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of side-chain liquid crystalline polyacetylenes containing phenyl benzoate mesogens with octyl spacers and cyano (2 a) or methoxy tails (2 b) is accomplished, and the tuning of the molecular alignments of 2 b is realized by simple mechanical perturbations. The acetylene monomers, 10 -[4 -(4 '-R-phenoxycarbonyl) phenoxycarbonyl]- 1 -decynes [R = cyano (1 a), methoxy (1 b) ], are prepared by two consecutive esterification reactions of 10 -undecynoic acid. None {{of the two}} monomers are liquid crystalline, but la exhibits an unusual crystal-crystal transition at 70. 5 degrees C, probably due to its strong intermolecular =C-H [...] . N=C- hydrogen bonding. The polymerizations of 1 initiated by the WCl 6 -Ph 4 Sn/dioxane complex yield yellow powdery polymers (2) with M-w of ca. 30 000, whose molecular structures are characterized by NMR, IR, and UV spectroscopy. The mesomorphic behavior of 2 is investigated by DSC, POM, and XRD: 2 a exhibits smecticity in a temperature range as wide as over 100 degrees C (k 80. 4 s(A) 194. 8 i), while 2 b displays smectic and nematic mesophases in the temperature region of 95 - 140 degrees C (k 95. 6 s(A) 113. 9 n 140. 8 i). Rotational agitation of the nematic 2 b generates the <b>disclinations</b> of high <b>strengths</b> (s up to 2), and translational shear creates the inversion walls, solidification of which produces the well-ordered bands aligned parallel to the shear direction. Such phenomena have not previously been observed in the "conventional" side-chain liquid crystalline polymers with flexible backbones, suggesting that the rigid polyacetylene backbone of 2 b {{plays an important role}} in inducing the novel molecular alignments aided by the external mechanical force...|$|R
