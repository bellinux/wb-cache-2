5|$|A ship of {{the line}} was a large, unarmored wooden sailing ship which mounted a battery of up to 120 smoothbore guns and carronades. The ship {{of the line}} {{developed}} gradually over centuries and, apart from growing in size, <b>it</b> <b>changed</b> little between the adoption of line of battle tactics in the early 17th century {{and the end of}} the sailing battleship's heyday in the 1830s. From 1794, the alternative term 'line of battle ship' was contracted (informally at first) to 'battle ship' or 'battleship'.|$|E
5|$|An oak made pulpit {{stands in}} front of the choir facing the nave. It {{originated}} in the north of France, probably in the mid-1500s. Its French Renaissance style suggests that it was made during the reign of Henry II. The lectern is also oak and dates from the 1600s. It had been used in a church near Avranches, France, for 200 years. A private individual purchased it shortly before the confiscation of church property during the French Revolution. <b>It</b> <b>changed</b> hands several times before Hibben obtained it for the chapel.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Change Management, a {{core process}} of the Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL), is {{concerned}} with the management of changes to networks and services to satisfy business goals and to minimize costly disruptions on the business. As part of <b>Change</b> Management, <b>IT</b> <b>changes</b> are planned for and scheduled for execution. With several uncoordinated IT operators and different (semi-) automated tools participating in the generation of <b>IT</b> <b>change</b> plans conflicts among them are likely to occur. Furthermore, state of the art <b>IT</b> <b>change</b> planners fail to prevent conflicts among plans. Conflicting <b>IT</b> <b>changes,</b> which render each other infeasible, ultimately lead to failed <b>IT</b> <b>change</b> plans and threaten the continuity of a business due to unsatisfied business goals. To tackle this problem we propose an algorithm for the automated detection of conflicting <b>IT</b> <b>change</b> plans. The algorithm is applied to several <b>IT</b> <b>changes</b> from the network and service management domain. Using simulation we identify and discuss characteristics of <b>IT</b> <b>changes</b> and plans that make deciding conflict freeness among plans more difficult. We find that our algorithm is able to decide the absence of conflicts among synthetically generated <b>IT</b> <b>change</b> plans (1 - 200 CRs per plan, up to 2000 CRs in total) in the context of large CMDBs (50, 000 CIs) and modestly skewed <b>IT</b> <b>changes.</b> The advantage of our solution lies within the tight integration of object-oriented models, frequently used to describe CMDBs in research and commercial systems. Furthermore, existing <b>IT</b> <b>change</b> planners and schedulers remain unchanged while our solution prevents inter-plan conflicts. I...|$|R
