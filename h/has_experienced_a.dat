5|$|The Providence {{metropolitan}} area includes Providence, Fall River, Massachusetts, and Warwick, and {{is estimated to}} have a population of 1,622,520.

5|$|From {{the launch}} of the {{original}} iPhone to the iPhone 4S, iPhones used 3.5-inch displays—which are smaller than screens used by flagship phones from competitors. The iPhone 5 and its immediate successors featured a display that was taller, but the same width as prior models, measuring at 4 inches diagonally. Following Apple's loss in smartphone market share to companies producing phones with larger displays, reports as early as January 2014 suggested that Apple was preparing to launch new iPhone models with larger, 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch displays. Reports prior to its unveiling also speculated that Apple might use a new iPhone model to introduce a mobile payments platform using near-field communications—a technology that has been incorporated into many Android phones, but <b>has</b> <b>experienced</b> <b>a</b> low adoption rate among users.|$|E
5|$|Gulf Oil Corporation (GOC) {{ceased to}} exist as an {{independent}} company in 1985, when it merged with Standard Oil of California (SOCAL), with both re-branding as Chevron in the United States. Gulf Canada, Gulf's main Canadian subsidiary, was sold the same year with retail outlets to Ultramar and Petro Canada and what became Gulf Canada Resources to Olympia & York. However, the Gulf brand name {{and a number of}} the constituent business divisions of GOC survived. Gulf <b>has</b> <b>experienced</b> <b>a</b> significant revival since 1990, emerging as a flexible network of allied business interests based on partnerships, franchises and agencies.|$|E
5|$|Shipping {{is another}} import sector with Maersk, the world's largest {{shipping}} company, having their world headquarters in Copenhagen. The city has an industrial harbour, Copenhagen Port.

The central {{location in the}} Øresund Region allows the ports {{to act as a}} hub for freight that is transported onward to the Baltic countries.

5|$|Stones {{sponsored}} the Rugby Football League Championship and its successor the Rugby Super League from 1986 until 1997. A well known series of television advertisements for the brand from 1983 until 1991, starring Tony Barton and Michael Angelis, became the longest running bitter advertisements in the country. Since {{the withdrawal of}} the majority of marketing support by Bass in 1997 in favour of the Worthington ale brand, the beer <b>has</b> <b>experienced</b> <b>a</b> marked decline in sales volumes, although it remains among the twenty highest selling ale brands in the United Kingdom.|$|E

After several decades of decline, King Street <b>has</b> <b>experienced</b> <b>a</b> revival since 2005 following a successful streetscaping project. A popular beer bar that opened that year {{set the tone}} for later establishments, many of them craft beer oriented. Subsequently, the district has become the home of many bars, restaurants, stores, and night clubs, as well as an arts district and two craft breweries to the north. As a result of this growth, the King Street District emerged as Jacksonville's beer hub in the 2010s.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of {{the failed}} Nordic bid to host the Euro 2008, Lerkendal was, along with Ullevaal Stadion, {{proposed}} as Norwegian venues. To reach the required spectator capacity of 30,000 seats, the plans called for {{the roof of the}} Adidas stand to be removed to allow for a temporary third tier. Additional seating would be created by adding a single row {{at the bottom of the}} four stands, and building capacity in the corners. The proposal would have given a spectator capacity of 30,849, although it would have been reduced after the championship by removing the extra tier. Similar plans were launched for the Norwegian–Swedish bid for Euro 2016, where the cost of the stadium upgrades was estimated at NOK800 million. In 2007, the club management stated that they wanted to sell out all matches before they made further expansions to the stadium, independent of the plans to host the Euro. Construction of stands in the corners could give 4,000 additional seats, although these would be the most costly to build and at the same time give the worst view of the pitch. Construction could be done by first building two of the corners. Since then, Rosenborg <b>has</b> <b>experienced</b> <b>a</b> significant drop in attendance. The failed Trondheim bid for the 2018 Winter Olympics, launched in 2007, called for Lerkendal to be the Olympic Stadium and host the opening and closing ceremonies.|$|E

5|$|Cassidy {{travels to}} Thailand {{in pursuit of}} Dragovic. Believing that Cassidy <b>has</b> <b>experienced</b> <b>a</b> nervous breakdown, the US {{authorities}} have sent Reed to detain {{him as soon as}} he arrives. Tony and his partner, Nung, are told to assist with the arrest. At Suvarnabhumi airport, Cassidy flees as the police try to arrest him. Reed, who has been bought off by Dragovic, kills Nung and frames Cassidy for the murder. Vitayakul pursues Cassidy through the streets, but Cassidy escapes; he travels to a nightclub in Poipet, where — after torturing one of Dragovic's men — he discovers the location of Dragovic's current operations. Vitayakul and Reed arrive at the nightclub and attempt to arrest Cassidy. After fighting with Vitayakul, Cassidy escapes injured. Meanwhile, Reed uses the timing of a call on Vitayakul's cell phone to discover the identity of an informant: Vitayakul's girlfriend, Min. While Cassidy is attempting to locate Janko, Dragovic's illegitimate son, who oversees Dragovic's southeast Asian human trafficking business, a shootout erupts between Cassidy and Janko's men. Janko flees the warehouse but is killed by Ivan and Goran Dragovic, his half-brothers, on behalf of their father. Vitayakul arrives and attempts to kill Cassidy, but after learning the truth about his partner's death, he kills Reed instead. Before dying, Janko reveals his father's location.|$|E
5|$|In {{common with}} many small Scottish islands, Papa Stour's {{population}} peaked in the 19th century and <b>has</b> <b>experienced</b> <b>a</b> significant decline since then (see e.g. Mingulay). By 1970 the island school had {{closed and the}} population had declined to sixteen 'fairly elderly' residents, but an advertisement in Exchange and Mart reversed the decline. A croft and five sheep were offered free of charge to incomers which brought a flood of applicants. By 1981 the census recorded a population of 33. However, by 2005 the population had fallen to 20 after serious discord between islanders led to several court cases. A number of people left the island and the school closed. By early 2008 the population had dropped to just nine after a family of seven left. The 2011 census recorded a usually resident population of 15 - during the decade 2011-11 Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4% to 103,702.|$|E
