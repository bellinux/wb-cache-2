Conte assured him that all the substances were IAAF compliant.|$|E
5|$|In North America, Tricholoma pardinum can be {{confused}} with T.nigrum and forms of T.virgatum that have more streaked rather than spotted caps. A form of T.pardinum in North America can be nearly white with pale scales, and may {{be confused}} with the whitish edible species T.resplendens. Microscopically, the presence of clamp connections sets T.pardinum apart from most other members of the genus, although the similar-looking (though more tan-coloured) T.venenatum also has them. According to Alexander H. Smith, T.huronense is closely related, but can be distinguished from T.pardinum by its narrower gills, its tendency to form <b>drops</b> <b>of</b> reddish liquid on the gills and stalk, and an ash-grey and scaly stalk surface.|$|E

The latter is retold in the Thai and Malaysian version of the Ramayana. Though Hanuman strings from Shiva's seed, he is also considered as a combined son of Vishnu and Shiva.|$|E
5|$|Mephedrone can be {{synthesised}} {{in several}} ways. The simplest method, {{due to the}} availability of the compounds, is to add 4-methylpropiophenone dissolved in glacial acetic acid to bromine, creating an oil fraction of 4'-methyl-2-bromopropiophenone. The oil fraction can then be dissolved in dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) and <b>drops</b> <b>of</b> the solution added to another solution of CH2Cl2-containing methylamine hydrochloride and triethylamine. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is then added and the aqueous layer is removed and turned alkaline using sodium hydroxide before the amine is extracted using CH2Cl2. The CH2Cl2 is then evaporated using a vacuum, creating an oil which is then dissolved in a nonaqueous ether. Finally, HCl gas is bubbled through the mixture to produce 4-methylmethcathinone hydrochloride. This method produces a mixture of both enantiomers and requires similar knowledge to that required to synthesise amphetamines and MDMA.|$|E
5|$|Oliphant {{followed}} up the work by constructing a particle accelerator that could fire protons {{with up to}} 600,000 electronvolts of energy. He soon confirmed the results of Cockroft and Walton on the artificial disintegration of the nucleus and positive ions. He produced a series of six papers over the following two years. In 1933, the Cavendish Laboratory received {{a gift from the}} American physical chemist Gilbert N. Lewis of a few <b>drops</b> <b>of</b> heavy water. The accelerator was used to fire heavy hydrogen nuclei (deuterons, which Rutherford called diplons) at various targets.

40|$|AbstractThe {{pressure}} <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> gas-solid flow for absorber sphere {{pneumatic conveying}} {{is important for}} the design and operation of the gas circulator. The simplified one-dimension model is introduced to predict the pressure <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> gas- solid flow for absorber sphere pneumatic conveying. The pressure <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> gas-solid flow in the vertical pipe is the main component part of the total gas-solid flow for absorber sphere conveying. The pressure <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> gas-solid flow for absorber sphere conveying in the vertical pipe with the inside diameter 47 mm and conveying height 23 m is predicted by the simplified model. The superficial gas velocity considered is in the range of 1. 5 to 3. 0 times of the terminal velocity of a single particle. The solid mass flow rate considered is in the range of 0. 2 to 1. 2 kg/s. Particle velocity, solid friction factor and solid mass flow rate are important parameters to predict pressure <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> vertical pipe. The typical empirical correlations of particle velocity and solid friction factor reported in the literature are adopted to predict the pressure <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> vertical pipe. The superficial gas velocity for absorber sphere conveying is suggested to be two times of the terminal velocity of a single particle. For the suggested superficial gas velocity, the predicted pressure <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> vertical pipe by using empirical correlations is in the range of 15 to 20 kPa and 31 to 50 kPa for solid mass flow rate at 0. 2 kg/s and 1. 2 kg/s, respectively. For the suggested superficial gas velocity, the relatively conservative predicted pressure <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> vertical pipe is in the range of 20 to 78 kPa for solid mass flow rate in the range of 0. 2 to 1. 2 kg/s. Further work is needed to verify the pressure drop model and to modify the key parameters for absorber sphere conveying in helium...|$|R

5|$|The Abbey Shield was {{designed}} by Pierre de Chaignon la Rose of Harvard University. It incorporates the personal coat of Saint Anselm of Canterbury and the first seal {{of the state of}} New Hampshire. In 1927, by a monastic vote, the shield design was incorporated as the official shield of Saint Anselm Abbey and the college. The drops in each quadrant represent the three <b>drops</b> <b>of</b> blood on Anselm's coat of arms, and the sheaf of five arrows is taken from the first shield of the State of New Hampshire, representing the five original counties of the state. Hence, the Abbey Shield has been interpreted as Saint Anselm of New Hampshire.|$|E

5|$|Busch stopped {{painting}} in 1896 and signed-over all publication rights to Bassermann Verlag for 50,000 gold marks. Busch, now aged 64, felt old. He needed spectacles for writing and painting, {{and his hands}} trembled slightly. In 1898, together with his aging sister Fanny Nöldeke, he accepted Bassermann's suggestion {{to move into a}} large parsonage in Mechtshausen. Busch read biographies, novels and stories in German, English and French. He organized his works and wrote letters and poems. Most of the poems from the collections Schein und Sein and Zu guter Letzt were written in 1899. The following years were eventless for Busch. He developed a sore throat in early January 1908, and his doctor detected a weak heart. During the night of 8–9 January 1908 Busch slept uneasily, taking camphor, and a few <b>drops</b> <b>of</b> morphine as a tranquilizer.

5|$|By {{the late}} 19th century {{scientists}} realized that air could be liquefied and its components isolated by compressing and cooling it. Using a cascade method, Swiss chemist and physicist Raoul Pierre Pictet evaporated liquid sulfur dioxide {{in order to}} liquefy carbon dioxide, which in turn was evaporated to cool oxygen gas enough to liquefy it. He sent a telegram on December 22, 1877 to the French Academy of Sciences in Paris announcing his discovery of liquid oxygen. Just two days later, French physicist Louis Paul Cailletet announced his own method of liquefying molecular oxygen. Only a few <b>drops</b> <b>of</b> the liquid were produced in each case and no meaningful analysis could be conducted.

The added size and weight of the 3D cameras meant the filmmakers {{were not able to}} use existing equipment such as Steadicam rigs. Instead the camera operator worked on a Segway to achieve the look of a Steadicam shot. Much of the action scenes were shot in front of a green screen.
