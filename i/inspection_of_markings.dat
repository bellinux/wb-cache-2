40|$|Nowadays, vision-based {{inspection}} {{systems are}} present in many stages of the industrial manufacturing process. Their versatility, which permits to accommodate {{a broad range of}} inspection requirements, is however limited by the time consuming system setup performed at each production change. This work aims at providing a configuration assistant that helps to speed up this system setup, considering the peculiarities of industrial vision systems. The pursued principle, which is to maximize the discriminating power of the features involved in the inspection decision, leads to an optimization problem based on a high dimensional objective function. Several objective functions based on various metrics are proposed, their optimization being performed with the help of various search heuristics such as genetic methods and simulated annealing methods. The experimental results obtained with an industrial inspection system are presented, considering the particular case of the visual <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> <b>markings</b> found on top of molded integrated circuits. These results show the effectiveness of the presented objective functions and search methods, and validate the configuration assistant as well...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a {{real time}} {{industrial}} machine vision system incorporating {{optical character recognition}} (OCR) is employed to inspect markings on integrated circuit (IC) chips. This inspection is carried out while the ICs are coming out from the manufacturing line. A TSSOP-DGG type of IC package from Texas Instruments {{is used in the}} investigation. The IC chip markings are laser printed. This inspection system tests whether the laser printed marking on IC chips is proper. The inspection has to identify print errors such as illegible characters, missing characters and upside down printing. The vision <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> the printed <b>markings</b> on the IC chip is carried out in three phases, namely, image preprocessing, feature extraction and classification. The MATLAB platform and its toolboxes are used for designing the inspection processing technique. Speed <b>of</b> the marking <b>inspection</b> is mostly dependent on the effectiveness of the feature extraction technique. The performances of four feature extraction techniques are compared in terms of their respective speed. The feature extracted data are used in a neural network for classifying the marking errors. A suggestion to optimize the number of input neurons of the neural network for a fast classification is also presented...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} Colored Petri Net {{approach}} to model check three atomicity properties for the NetBill electronic cash system. We {{verify that the}} protocol satisfies money atomicity, goods atomicity and certified delivery {{in the presence of}} potential site or communication failures and all possible unilateral transaction abort cases. Model checking is performed in CPN Tools, a graphical ML-based tool for editing and analyzing Colored Petri Nets (CP-nets). In case of property violation, protocol failure analysis aims in exploring all property violation scenarios, in order to correct the protocol's design. Model checking exploits the provided state space exploration functions and the supported Computation Tree like temporal logic (CTL). On the other hand, protocol failure analysis is performed by <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> appropriately selected <b>markings</b> and if necessary, by interactively simulating certain property violation scenarios. In ecommerce, Colored Petri Net model checking has been used in verifying absence of deadlocks, absence of livelocks and absence of unexpected dead transitions, as well as in verifying a protocol against its service. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to employ CP-nets for model checking atomicity properties. We believe that the described approach can also be applied in model checking other functional properties that are not directly related to the structural properties of the generated state space graph...|$|R
