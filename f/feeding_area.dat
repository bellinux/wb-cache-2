5|$|The Swan Coastal Plain {{north of}} Perth {{has become an}} {{important}} <b>feeding</b> <b>area.</b> There, cockatoos also forage in the Gnangara pine plantations, where they feed on the seeds of Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) and maritime pine (Pinus pinaster). Carnaby's black cockatoos have come to depend on these plantations since the early 20th century. Almost two-thirds of the Carnaby's black cockatoos in the Perth–Peel Coastal Plain roost in the Gnangara-Pinjar pine plantation. Other non-native plants that the birds also consume include Erodium species, doublegee (Emex australis) seeds, {{the fruit of the}} umbrella tree (Schefflera actinophylla), seeds of liquidambar (Liquidambar styraciflua), sunflower (Helianthus annuus), jacaranda (Jacaranda mimosifolia), almond (Prunus amygdalus), onion grass (Romulea rosea), white cedar (Melia azedarach), and hibiscus flowers.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of sea terns have light grey or white body plumage as adults, {{with a black}} cap to the head. The legs and bill are various combinations of red, orange, yellow, or black depending on species. The pale plumage is conspicuous from a distance at sea, and may attract other birds to a good <b>feeding</b> <b>area</b> for these fish-eating species. When seen against the sky, the white underparts also help to hide the hunting bird from its intended prey. The Inca tern has mainly dark plumage, and three species that mainly eat insects, the black tern, white-winged tern, and black-bellied tern, have black underparts in the breeding season. The Anous noddies have dark plumage with a pale head cap. The reason for their dark plumage is unknown, {{but it has been}} suggested that in tropical areas, where food resources are scarce, the less conspicuous colouration makes it harder for other noddies to detect a feeding bird. Plumage type, especially the head pattern, is linked to the phylogeny of the terns, and the pale-capped, dark-bodied noddies are believed to have diverged earlier than the other genera from an ancestral white-headed gull, followed by the partially black-headed Onychoprion and Sternula groupings.|$|E

500|$|Although fin {{whales are}} {{certainly}} migratory, moving seasonally {{in and out}} of high-latitude feeding areas, the overall migration pattern is not well understood. Acoustic readings from passive-listening hydrophone arrays indicate a southward migration of the North Atlantic fin whale occurs in the autumn from the Labrador-Newfoundland region, south past Bermuda, and into the West Indies. One or more populations of fin whales are thought to remain year-round in high latitudes, moving offshore, but not southward in late autumn. [...] A study based on resightings of identified fin whales in Massachusetts Bay indicates that calves often learn migratory routes from their mothers and return to their mother's <b>feeding</b> <b>area</b> in subsequent years.|$|E

40|$|Investigation of {{the migratory}} {{movement}} of humpback whales past New Zealand in the 1950 s and early 1960 s {{suggested that the}} primary factor influencing the migratory flow past New Zealand was behaviour associated with breeding and feeding. To the north humpback whales gathered in concentrated breeding assemblages, along the Great Barrier Reef, Australia and nearby islands of the Western Pacific, at locations with suitable coastal conditions. To the south humpback whales dispersed widely across the Antarctic <b>Area</b> V <b>feeding</b> <b>areas.</b> Discovery Tag marks provided the first evidence of linkages between Eastern Australia, New Zealand and Oceania and Antarctic <b>Area</b> V <b>feeding</b> <b>areas</b> and also revealed low levels of intermingling of individual humpbacks between isolated tropical breeding grounds in estern Australia, Eastern Australia and Oceania. A simultaneous, near total collapse of the Eastern Australian, Norfolk Island, New Zealand and Oceania stocks occurred in the early 1960 ’s {{as a result of}} commercial whaling, particularly the illegal whaling conducted by the Soviets in the <b>Area</b> V <b>feeding</b> <b>areas.</b> Recent photo- dentification and genetic studies have identified at least 5 discrete breeding sub-populations in Australia and Oceania; Western Australia (D), Eastern Australia (E 1), New Caledonia (E 2), Tonga (E 3) and Cook Island’s and French Polynesia (F). Also evident are low levels of intermingling amongst breeding sub-populations consistent with the degree of genetic differentiation. Photoidentification has confirmed linkages between Antarctic <b>Area</b> V <b>feeding</b> <b>areas</b> and Eastern Australia and one genotype match has been reported between Antarctic <b>Area</b> V <b>feeding</b> <b>areas</b> and Oceania breeding grounds. Recent abundance estimates show steady increases of the Eastern Australian population, some recovery in the New Caledonia and Tonga population with little evidence of recovery at other known Oceania breeding areas and in New Zealand. Studies to date have provided no conclusive evidence of the migratory destination of the New Zealand population traveling from Antarctic <b>Area</b> V <b>feeding</b> <b>areas</b> to tropical breeding grounds. Here we use recent photo-identification data to investigate and discuss the migratory destination of humpback whales traveling through New Zealand waters and suggest the hypothesis that humpbacks with site fidelity to Eastern Australia may migrate past the South Island of New Zealand including through the Cook Strait and Foveaux Strait...|$|R

40|$|Important {{nursery grounds}} for Patagonian {{grenadier}} (Macruronus magellanicus) are located {{mainly in the}} Northwest Patagonian Inner Sea (42 ºS- 44 ºS), from which juvenile must to disperse or migrate offshore, then along the Chilean coast either northward or southward. The objective {{of this paper was}} to estimate northward spring juvenile migration of the Patagonian grenadier from nursery to <b>feeding</b> <b>areas,</b> which are located near Talcahuano (35 º 00 ’S- 37 º 10 ’S). Length-frequency data (LFD) were obtained from an acoustic survey carried out in November 1999, which covered from 35 ºS to 47 ºS. Generalized linear model was used to describe the presence of juvenile per latitude and depth, and to infer the origin and displacement of juveniles. Subsequently, LFD data were grouped according to latitudinal strata. Grouped LFD were decomposed into normal component groups, from which mean, standard deviation and proportion were estimated from the mixed LFD. The average length of the identified groups were sorted from south to north, and linked to compute significant increment in fish length and age per kilometers. The length increment per time was not due to growth, rather they was due to spatial displacement of juvenile from southern nursery grounds to northern <b>feeding</b> <b>areas.</b> Although homing to <b>feeding</b> <b>areas</b> and/or high residency (partial migration) have been postulated, it seems that recruitment of juveniles to northern <b>feeding</b> <b>areas</b> are origintaed from NPIS nurseries.
