5|$|V-Series: {{introduced}} in October 2006, the Commodore V featured air conditioning, a sports-oriented body kit including 17-inch alloy wheels, a rear spoiler and colour-matched wing mirrors and exterior <b>door</b> <b>handles.</b>|$|E
5|$|MY09: {{models were}} {{launched}} on 15 March 2008. Six airbags were made standard across the range—Omega and SV6 variants were previously fitted with two and four airbags respectively. Omega models also received standard fitment of air conditioning, 16-inch alloy wheels, body colour wing mirrors and <b>door</b> <b>handles,</b> {{and a new}} grille insert with chrome highlights. Revised alloy wheel designs were featured on the Calais (seven-spoke) and Calais V (10-spoke).|$|E
5|$|Initially, Nakashima, Francois Sammer (a Czech {{architect}} {{who had worked}} for Le Corbusier in Russia) and Chandulal (a devotee who had trained as an engineer), built a full-scale model of the dormitory in order to test the feasibility of the design, and then used it as a laboratory to further refine the construction methods. Nakashima's duties included doing very explicit detail drawings showing, for example, the design of the concrete formwork. Devotees even donated brass utensils so that they could be melted down to make <b>door</b> <b>handles</b> and hinges.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Current {{approaches}} for opening door usually {{focus on the}} recognition of <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> in a fixed position, {{but in the process}} of door opening, a manipulator with a mobile platform is very important under real-world scenarios, which brings significance to the location and distance measurement of a <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> when the mobile platform is moving. In this paper, a method for location of a <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> in HSI color space is presented. The image of the <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> is captured by the kinect for Xbox 360, and is processed in HSI color space, resulting in a rectangle frame fitted to the <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> to be displayed in real time. The distance value of the <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> is obtained from the depth image. Experiment results show the efficiency of the proposed method...|$|R
50|$|The Lever lock <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> on a {{backplate}} {{is another}} type of <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> which operates similarly to the lever latch <b>door</b> <b>handle.</b> This type of handle on a backplate consists of a lever and just below it, a key hole cut. This allows a key to be inserted into the door to control a mortice sash lock. Just the like the lever latch, the door can be opened and shut by pushing the handle but can also be locked using a key. This locking mechanism is why this type of <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> is used for front and back doors of residential housing.|$|R
50|$|A <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> is an {{attached}} {{object or}} mechanism used to manually open or close a door. In the United States, a <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> generally refers to any fixed or lever-operated door latch device. The term door knob or doorknob tends {{to refer to}} round operating mechanisms.|$|R
25|$|Designed by Alfa Centro Stile {{under the}} {{guidance}} of head designer Walter de'Silva the 156s shape was distinctly Alfa Romeo. Its style included high curved flanks, retro styled front <b>door</b> <b>handles,</b> recessed rear <b>door</b> <b>handles,</b> and a dramatic deep grille, which necessitated a highly unusual off-centre licence plate holder. The car {{was one of the first}} saloons, and wagons, to feature hidden rear <b>door</b> <b>handles</b> and prominent front <b>door</b> <b>handles</b> to give it a coupé look. The design was influenced by three historical Alfa Romeo models: the 1900, the Giulietta and the Giulia. The 156 achieved a drag coefficient (Cd) of 0.31.|$|E
25|$|In early 2011, {{a number}} of new Prop 65 consent {{agreements}} were reported, covering vinyl inflatable structures, vinyl lounge chairs, inspection lights with clamp handles, brass <b>door</b> <b>handles,</b> cadmium in jewelry and a revised judgment for fashion accessories.|$|E
25|$|A new AMC {{safety and}} styling feature was also {{introduced}} on the 1968 Rebels; the flush-mounted paddle-style <b>door</b> <b>handles.</b> These replaced the former push-button design {{and become an}} enduring AMC signature on its passenger cars through 1988 and the Jeep Wrangler until 2006.|$|E
50|$|On {{a balcony}} whose door has an outside shutter, a special <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> {{is used on}} the outer side. The {{protruding}} part of such handle (usually ring-shaped) can be folded sideways, so that the shutter can be fully closed without being obstructed by the <b>door</b> <b>handle.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} and basic type of <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> is the Lever latch <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> on a {{backplate}} found in residential houses and commercial and public buildings. Doors fitted with this handle has a latch {{which is used to}} keep the door shut. The <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> features only a lever handle which operates this latch. When the handle is pushed down, the spindle rotates which “passes through the door and the tubular latch inside the door allowing the door to be opened”. This type of <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> is normally found on doors leading into the living and dining rooms as they don’t require any type of locking. The lever latch handle is also easy to install and use and is available in a variety of styles and finishes.|$|R

25|$|The inner {{decoration}} {{of the main}} auditorium was completely modified in 1933 according to principles of New Objectivity. The stucco and chandeliers were all removed, the organ case lost most of its ornaments.

Black Bird's Eye Maple wood with gray interior {{was a new}} interior option for that year.|$|E
25|$|Developed from mid-2005 to November 2005, it was {{a concept}} vehicle that previewed {{the design of the}} V36-based G coupe.

25|$|Lotus used {{a variety}} of parts from other cars to reduce {{development}} costs. Esprits built before 1993 used many British Leyland parts and those built in the mid- to late-1980s incorporated more Toyota parts while those built after 1993 had many GM (Vauxhall, Opel) parts. <b>Door</b> <b>handles</b> from the Morris Marina/Austin Allegro were used until the S4 model in 1994 when GM Calibra <b>door</b> <b>handles</b> were used. Early cars used a Momo steering wheel, while later ones had the same wheel as the Pontiac Trans Am. Headlight lift motors came from the Pontiac Fiero. The aerial mount and whip on the S4 and V8 was the same as the GM Calibra and Tigra. The side mirrors were from the Citroën CX. Non-SE fog lamps from about 1989 were GM Astra MK1. The fan motors came from the Ford Fiesta Mk2. The alternator on the V8 models was a standard GM unit also found in the V6 Opel Omega B and the earlier Lotus Carlton/Omega, which also provided interior plastic fittings such as <b>door</b> <b>handles</b> and steering column covering. The clutch master and slave cylinders on 1998 and newer models were Girling parts shared with the series 2A Land Rover. The S1 and S2 shared some front suspension components with the Opel Ascona. The GT3's Brembo front brake pads were the same as on a Fiat Coupé Turbo or a Peugeot 406 3.0 V6. The SE's fuel pump was from the Renault Fuego.|$|E
25|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{shape of}} the car was designed by Oscar Jankovits, probably inspired by contemporary aerodynamic theories such as Paul Jaray's,and built at the Jankovits garage between 1935 and 1937. It was a barchetta with central driving position, with fully integrated wings (ponton styling). The body shell was streamlined to minimise turbulence in the air flow, fully enveloping the underbody and integrating <b>door</b> <b>handles</b> and lights.|$|E
25|$|When {{framed in}} wood for snug fitting of a door, the doorway {{consists}} of two vertical jambs on either side, a lintel or head jamb at the top, and perhaps a threshold at the bottom. When a door {{has more than one}} movable section, one of the sections may be called a leaf. See door furniture for a discussion of attachments to doors such as <b>door</b> <b>handles,</b> doorknobs, and door knockers.|$|E

Caprice including rear roof mounted climate control and stereo controls for rear passengers- rear passengers were also provided with two headphone jacks in the rear parcel shelf and could listen to a different audio source to the front occupants.
