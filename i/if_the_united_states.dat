5|$|During the 1790s, American {{merchant}} vessels {{began to}} fall prey to Barbary Pirates in the Mediterranean, most notably from Algiers. Congress's response was the Naval Act of 1794.

5|$|On May 26, 1952 twelve {{members of}} the TSO board met to review their {{decision}} not to renew the contracts.

It was decided that the contracts would not be renewed, but <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> immigration officials would issue entry permits to the six musicians by September 1, the TSO would renew the contracts. This decision created a controversy and a split within the TSO board, which eventually led to the resignation of two members, Mrs. Edmund Boyd and Mrs. R. B.

5|$|The Constitutional Convention convened by the Articles of Confederation Congress in 1787 {{provided}} for a ratification {{process in the}} states that was duly transmitted by Congress to each state. As Virginians {{went to the polls}} to elect delegates to its state convention, six states had ratified including the two other largest states of Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. But Virginia bisected the new nation from the Atlantic Ocean to the Mississippi River; its admission into the prospective union was critical <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> as a nation-state were to have contiguous continental territory.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese Army and Navy {{had their}} own {{independent}} atomic-bomb programs and therefore the Japanese understood enough to know how very difficult building it would be. Therefore, many Japanese {{and in particular the}} military members of the government refused to believe the United States had built an atomic bomb, and the Japanese military ordered their own independent tests to determine the cause of Hiroshima's destruction. Admiral Soemu Toyoda, the Chief of the Naval General Staff, argued that even <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> had made one, they could not have many more. American strategists, having anticipated a reaction like Toyoda's, planned to drop a second bomb shortly after the first, to convince the Japanese that the U.S. had a large supply.|$|E
5|$|FairTax proponents {{argue that}} the {{proposal}} would provide tax burden visibility and reduce compliance and efficiency costs by 90%, returning {{a large share of}} money to the productive economy. The Beacon Hill Institute concluded that the FairTax would save $346.51 billion in administrative costs and would be a much more efficient taxation system. Bill Archer, former head of the House Ways and Means Committee, asked Princeton University Econometrics to survey 500 European and Asian companies regarding the effect on their business decisions <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> enacted the FairTax. 400 of those companies stated they would build their next plant in the United States, and 100 companies said they would move their corporate headquarters to the United States. Supporters {{argue that the}} U.S. has the highest combined statutory corporate income tax rate among OECD countries along with being the only country with no border adjustment element in its tax system. Proponents state that because the FairTax eliminates corporate income taxes and is automatically border adjustable, the competitive tax advantage of foreign producers would be eliminated, immediately boosting U.S. competitiveness overseas and at home.|$|E
