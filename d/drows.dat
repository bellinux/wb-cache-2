60|$|Such {{possession}} of supernatural wisdom is still imputed by the natives of the Orkney and Zetland Islands {{to the people}} called <b>Drows,</b> being a corruption of duergar or dwarfs, and who may, in most other respects, be identified with the Caledonian fairies. Lucas Jacobson Debes, who dates his description of Feroe from his Pathmos, in Thorshaven, March 12, 1670, dedicates a long chapter to the spectres who disturbed his congregation, and sometimes carried off his hearers. The actors in these disturbances he states to be the Skow, or Biergen-Trold--i.e., {{the spirits of the}} woods and mountains, sometimes called subterranean people, and adds, they appeared in deep caverns and among horrid rocks; as also, that they haunted the places where murders or other deeds of mortal sin had been acted. They appear to have been the genuine northern dwarfs, or Trows, another pronunciation of Trollds, and are considered by the reverend author as something very little better than actual fiends.|$|E
60|$|Such as it was, {{the popular}} {{system of the}} Celts easily {{received}} the northern admixture of <b>Drows</b> and Duergar, which gave the belief, perhaps, a darker colouring than originally belonged to the British fairyland. It was from the same source also, in all probability, that additional legends were obtained of a gigantic and malignant female, the Hecate of this mythology, who rode on the storm and marshalled the rambling host of wanderers under her grim banner. This hag (in all respects the reverse of the Mab or Titania of the Celtic creed) was called Nicneven in that later system which blended {{the faith of the}} Celts and of the Goths on this subject. The great Scottish poet Dunbar has made a spirited description of this Hecate riding at the head of witches and good neighbours (fairies, namely), sorceresses and elves, indifferently, upon the ghostly eve of All-Hallow Mass.[26] In Italy we hear of the hags arraying themselves under the orders of Diana (in her triple character of Hecate, doubtless) and Herodias, who were the joint leaders of their choir. But we return to the more simple fairy belief, as entertained by the Celts before they were conquered by the Saxons.|$|E

50|$|As a race, <b>drow</b> {{are usually}} evil. Exceptions exist, {{the most notable}} being Drizzt Do'Urden, Jarlaxle Baenre, and Liriel Baenre, but these are highly unusual. (Note that even Liriel Baenre was arguably of evil {{alignment}} for the first portion of her life, only shifting to a good alignment after close relationships with several good-aligned characters.) Originally, <b>drow</b> were chaotic evil in alignment. Beginning with 3rd edition D&D, <b>drow</b> are usually neutral evil. There have been encounters with non-evil <b>drow,</b> but these are distrusted {{as much as their}} brethren, due to their reputation.

40|$|Background. Remifentanil {{has been}} {{suggested}} as an ideal opioid for patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) in labour, but the safety profile has not been established. The aims of this preliminary prospective observational study were to investigate the maternal side-effects and early neonatal effects, and to assess the placental transfer of remifentanil PCA during labour. Methods. Women with no known obstetric complications or contraindication to remifentanil were recruited (n= 50). Remifentanil was administered at a bolus dose of 0. 5 mg kg 1 and a lockout period of 2 min. A visual analogue scale {{was used to assess}} pain, nausea and itching. Maternal observations were recorded hourly and fetal heart rate trace was assessed every 2 h. Umbilical cord gases, 1 and 5 min Apgar scores and neurological evaluation of the neonate were recorded. Maternal venous blood and umbilical artery and vein cord blood samples were collected for analysis of remifentanil concentration. Results. Fifty women enrolled in the study (24 multiparous, 26 primiparous). There was no evidence of cardiovascular instability or respiratory depression. Pain scores decreased signi-ficantly, but there was no significant change in nausea after initiating the PCA. A statistically significant increase in itching was found to be clinically mild and 22 women were slightly <b>drows...</b>|$|E
5000|$|... 1991's The <b>Drow</b> of the Underdark, a 128-page sourcebook {{all about}} the <b>drow,</b> {{expanded}} the <b>drow</b> significantly for the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons second edition version of the Forgotten Realms setting. The first chapter explains [...] "The Nature of Dark Elves", augmenting {{the information in the}} Monstrous Compendium entry. It describes their variable physical builds, their alert and inquisitive intelligence, their highly developed senses, the personal magic that all <b>drow</b> are trained in; it also details <b>drow</b> wizards (the most dangerous <b>drow</b> likely to be encountered outside the Underdark), as well as the driders, misfit <b>drow</b> who have failed a test of Lolth. Dark Elven Society is detailed in the second chapter. <b>Drow</b> society, being strongly matriarchal, allows the females to hold all positions of power in the government, and to choose and discard mates freely. Social station {{is the most important thing}} in <b>drow</b> society, making ascension to greater power a <b>drow's</b> ultimate goal. <b>Drow</b> have a strong affinity for arachnids, as most worship the spider goddess Lolth, and spiders dwell freely among <b>drow</b> communities. The third chapter details [...] "Drow Religion" [...] in the Forgotten Realms setting; as the majority of <b>drow</b> worship Lolth (or [...] "Lloth", formerly known as Araushnee in ancient times), they simply don't speak of or recognize those who do not. <b>Drow</b> deities in this world include Eilistraee, the [...] "Dark Maiden", the goddess of good-aligned <b>drow,</b> and of song, dance, swordwork, and hunting; Ghaunadaur, That Which Lurks (also known as [...] "The Elder Elemental Eye"), a tentacled dark purple blob served by ropers and patron of oozes and all things subterranean; Lolth; and Vhaeraun, the god of thievery and the patron god of <b>drow</b> males in opposition to the matriarchy of <b>drow</b> society. [...] "The High History of the Drow" [...] in the Realms is revealed in the fourth chapter, detailing the descent of the Ilythiiri (the original [...] "Dark Elves") of the southern jungles into the underground, and their dark wars as they became the <b>drow</b> they are today. The fifth chapter details 27 new [...] "Drow Spells" [...] for both wizards and priests; the sixth chapter includes dozens of [...] "Drow Magical Items", some of which previously appeared in first edition AD&D sources; the seventh chapter details [...] "Drow Craftwork", discussing their unique clothing and weaponry, their poison, as well as mining and engineering, and <b>drow</b> artisans. The eighth chapter briefly describes [...] "Drow Language", while the ninth chapter goes into [...] "Drow Nomenclature" [...] by providing example female and male given names and <b>drow</b> house names, and the tenth chapter provides [...] "A Selected Glossary of Deep Drow". [...] "Dark Elven Symbols" [...] are described in the eleventh chapter, including <b>drow</b> runes such as way-marker runes, sacred glyphs, house defense glyphs; the twelfth chapter, [...] "The Spider and the Axe: War in the Depths" [...] details an [...] "ideal longterm camapaign setting" [...] involving a war between <b>drow</b> and dwarves; the thirteenth chapter provides a brief look at [...] "The Underdark", but advises readers to see the Queen of the Spiders series and the Dwarves Deep sourcebook for further information. The fourteenth chapter provides game statistics for several [...] "Monsters of the Underdark" [...] that associate with <b>drow,</b> or compete with them, including the deep dragon, the myrlochar, the deep rothe, the yochlol, and several species of spider and spider-like creatures. According to The Complete Book of Elves, <b>drow</b> are not welcome in Evermeet and are turned away.|$|R
50|$|In Mongoose Publishing's <b>Drow</b> War trilogy, the <b>drow</b> are recast as lawful evil villains and {{likened to}} the Nazis. The {{author of the}} series has stated {{that this was a}} {{deliberate}} reaction to the prevalence of renegade, non-evil <b>drow</b> characters.|$|R
5000|$|The Advanced Dungeons & Dragons game's {{second edition}} product Monstrous Compendium Volume Two {{describes}} {{the world of}} the <b>drow,</b> where violent conflict is part of everyday life, so much so that most <b>drow</b> encountered are ready for a fight. Their inherent magic use comes from training in magic, which all <b>drow</b> receive. Not long after the creation of the elves, they were torn into rival factions, one evil and one good; after a great civil war, those who followed the path of evil and chaos were driven far from the world's forests and into the bleak, lightless caverns and tunnels of the underworld. Most creatures who live on the surface have never met a <b>drow,</b> but those who have seen a <b>drow</b> city report nightmarish buildings constructed of stone and minerals, carved into weird, fantastic shapes. <b>Drow</b> society is fragmented into opposing noble houses and merchant families, and they base their rigid class system on the belief that the strongest should rule. Female <b>drow</b> tend to fill many positions of great importance, with priests of the dark goddess Lolth holding a very high place in society. <b>Drow</b> fighters are required to go through rigorous training in their youth, and those who fail are put to death. <b>Drow</b> use giant lizards as pack animals, use bugbears and troglodytes as servants, and have alliances with many of the underworld's evil inhabitants such as mind flayers. <b>Drow</b> constantly war with other underground neighbors such as dwarves and dark gnomes (svirfneblin), and keep slaves of all types - including allies who fail to live up to <b>drow</b> expectations. The Complete Book of Elves by Colin McComb focuses some of its attention on the <b>drow.</b> The Elfwar is presented, an elven myth in which the elves were one people until the Spider Queen Lolth used the dissent among the elves to gain a foothold; the elves of Lolth took the name <b>Drow</b> to signify their new allegiance, but as they massed to conquer the other elves, Corellon Larethian and his followers drove Lolth and her people deep into the earth, where they chose to remain. The dark elves who became the <b>drow</b> were originally simply elves who held more with the tenets of might than those of justice, and as they quested for power they became corrupted and turned against their fairer brethren. Dark elves rarely produce half-elves, as they would slaughter any fool who trusts them. <b>Drow</b> infravision is described as so intense that their eyes actually radiate heat; therefore, a character viewing a <b>drow</b> through infravision would see two burning eyes atop a normally glowing torso. Any elf character of good or neutral alignment, even <b>drow,</b> is allowed into the realm of Arvanaith where elves go upon reaching old age. The book notes that <b>drow</b> player characters have a large number of benefits while suffering few disadvantages, but that [...] "the major disadvantage to being a <b>drow</b> is being a drow." [...] <b>Drow</b> characters are extraordinarily dexterous and intelligent, but have the typically low elf constitution; also, their personalities are described as grating at best, and all other elves hate the <b>drow</b> which affects their reactions to a <b>drow</b> character.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Drow</b> {{characters}} are extremely intelligent, charismatic and dexterous, but share surface elves' comparative frailty and slight frames. Females {{tend to be}} bigger and stronger than males. <b>Drow</b> are characterized by white or silver hair and obsidian black skin. Their eyes are red (or rarely gray, violet, or yellow) in darkness and can be many different colors in normal light. <b>Drow</b> have several kinds of innate spell powers and spell resistance. This is balanced by their weakness in daylight. Also, <b>drow</b> weapons and armor (usually made of adamantite or another metal unique to the Underdark) slowly lose their magical properties if exposed to the sun. In Advanced Dungeons & Dragons second edition, adamantite disintegrates upon exposure to sunlight unless specifically treated. <b>Drow</b> also employ the unusual hand crossbow, firing small, though very lethal, darts. Half-drow {{are the result of}} crossbreeding between another race and a <b>drow,</b> and share characteristics of both. (The term [...] "half-drow" [...] usually refers to one who is half <b>drow</b> and half human.) Half-drow are also generally evil; however, half-drow of differing alignments are more common than non-evil full <b>drow.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>drow</b> appear {{first for}} this edition in the Monstrous Compendium Volume Two (1989), which expands the {{information}} on <b>drow</b> society. Also included in the entry for <b>drow</b> is a description and statistics for the drider. This entry is reprinted with some minor modifications in the Monstrous Manual (1993).|$|R
5000|$|Vhaeraun ( [...] ), {{also known}} as the Masked Lord and the Masked God of Night, is the <b>drow</b> god of thievery, <b>drow</b> males, and evil {{activity}} on the surface world in many Dungeons & Dragons campaign settings. His worshipers include assassins, male <b>drow</b> and half-drow, poisoners, shadowdancers, rogues, and thieves.|$|R
50|$|<b>Drow</b> society, religion, history, magic, craftwork, and {{language}} for the Forgotten Realms campaign setting is detailed significantly in The <b>Drow</b> of the Underdark (1991), by Ed Greenwood. Greenwood {{appears in the}} book's introduction as a narrator, explaining how he came across {{the information in the}} book: a discussion with Elminster, and chance encounter with a former apprentice of Elminster - the <b>drow</b> lady, Susprina Arkhenneld - as the two explain the <b>drow</b> of the world to the narrator.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Drow</b> {{society is}} based upon violence, murder, cunning, and the {{philosophy}} that only the strong survive (though in <b>Drow</b> tongue, a quirk of the language creates a reversal of cause-and-effect; more correctly, it can be translated as [...] "those who survive are strong"). Hence, most <b>Drow</b> plot endlessly to murder or otherwise incapacitate their rivals and enemy <b>Drow</b> using deceit and betrayal. <b>Drow,</b> particularly in higher positions, are constantly wary of assassins and the like. One of the quirks of this constant infighting is the relatively short lifespan of the average <b>Drow.</b> While being just as long lived as their surface cousins, living {{as long as a}} thousand years; you are very unlikely to meet an elderly <b>Drow.</b> Consequently, they are the only race of Elves that matches the fertility of 'lesser' races, such as humans. Their society, as a whole, is seemingly nonviable. The only reason they do not murder themselves to extinction is by the will of Lolth, working primarily through her clergy. Lolth does not tolerate any <b>Drow</b> that threaten to bring down her society, and the clergy make certain that perpetrators cease their destructive actions by either threatening or killing them.|$|R
5000|$|D3 Vault of the <b>Drow</b> {{is set in}} Erelhei-Cinlu, an {{underground}} stronghold of the <b>drow,</b> and the Fane of Lolth, their evil spider-goddess. [...] After traveling for league after league into the Underdark, the adventurers come upon Erelhei-Cinlu, the vast subterranean city of the <b>drow.</b> The adventure is written in a very open-ended fashion, giving the Dungeon Master (DM) free rein to script any number of mini-campaigns or adventures taking place inside the <b>drow</b> capital. An extensive overview of the <b>drow</b> power structure is given for just this purpose. Eventually, the players may discover an astral gate leading to {{the plane of the}} Abyss, leading into the Q1 module.|$|R
50|$|The <b>drow</b> are {{presented}} as a player character race for 2nd edition in The Complete Book of Elves (1992). <b>Drow</b> deities Lolth, Kiaransalee, Vhaeraun, and Zinzerena are described in Monster Mythology (1992). The <b>drow</b> are later presented as a playable character race again in Player's Option: Skills & Powers (1995).|$|R
50|$|In {{the game}} Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn, {{there is a}} <b>drow</b> female in the <b>drow</b> city of Ust Natha that bears Qilué's name.|$|R
50|$|Glorfathel, Ambergris and Afafrenfere enter Gauntlgrym {{in pursuit}} of Drizzt, and the Shadovar {{teleport}} in {{to the city to}} intercept the three companions as well. A fight ensues, but is interrupted as they are ambushed by Ravel's <b>drow</b> force. The three are captured by the <b>drow,</b> but Entreri is able to convince the <b>drow</b> that they are agents of Bregen D'aerthe, and the <b>drow</b> decide to let them go. All the <b>drow</b> except for Brach'thal (who has allied with the primordial) retreat to the lower levels as the battle between the primordial elementals, the Shadovar, and the three companions intensifies. This interrupts Gol'fanin's ongoing work on a sword and shield of great magical power for Tiago.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the world}} of Greyhawk, the <b>drow</b> were driven {{underground}} by their surface-dwelling relatives because of ideological differences. There they eventually adapted to their surroundings, especially by attracting {{the attention of the}} goddess Lolth, [...] "Queen of Spiders". The center of <b>drow</b> civilization is the subterranean city Erelhei-Cinlu, and its surrounding Vault, commonly called the Vault of the <b>Drow.</b>|$|R
50|$|The psionic lich for the Ravenloft {{campaign}} setting {{first appeared}} in Dragon #174 (October 1991), and then appeared in Van Richten's Guide to the Lich (1993), Ravenloft Monstrous Compendium Appendix III: Creatures of Darkness (1994), Monstrous Compendium Annual One (1994), and Van Richten's Monster Hunter's Compendium (1999). Several other lich variants were also introduced in the Ravenloft Monstrous Compendium Appendix III, including the defiler lich and demi-defiler lich, the <b>drow</b> lich (and the <b>drow</b> demilich, the drider lich, the <b>drow</b> priestess lich, and the <b>drow</b> wizard lich), and the elemental lich and demi-elemental lich.|$|R
