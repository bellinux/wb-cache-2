25|$|The domovoi {{is also an}} oracle, as his {{behavior}} foretells or forewarns about the future.

Usually <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>a</b> V or U-trench and a wall or dragon’s teeth row, while moats, hedgehogs and berms have been used very rarely because they are difficult to be camouflaged. Behind this lies an extensive, at least 30-meter-wide anti-infantry entanglement, which is a mixed system of apron fences, wire concertinas, electric fences, traps, mines, nail spikes and spike pits. Both elements are well camouflaged by good location (relief) and by plants (e.g. small height bushes in front of ditches).|$|E
25|$|Sometimes the {{original}} {{meaning of the}} adjective is retained, but the whole compound still means something more specific {{than the sum of}} the elements. For example, savanyú káposzta, lit. ’sour cabbage’, actually ’sauerkraut’, is more than a cabbage that tastes sour: <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>a</b> type of pickled food, yet it is written with a space. On the other hand, mobiltelefon ’mobile phone’ is written in one word, although it is actually a telephone that is mobile – writing in one word may be justified by the different technology, as distinguished from a cordless telephone, which is also portable.|$|E

The attacking three are usually two wing-backs or wingers with the central player of the three occupying a central attacking midfield or second striker role behind the centre-forward. The midfield three consists of two centre midfielders ahead of one central defensive midfielder or alternatively one central midfielder and two defensive midfielders. The defensive three can consist of three centre-backs or one centre-back with a full-back either side.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} homogeneous space {{concept is}} a special case of that of principal bundle: <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>a</b> principal bundle with base a single point. In other words the local theory of principal bundles {{is that of a}} family of principal homogeneous spaces depending on some parameters in the base. The 'origin' can be supplied by a section of the bundlesuch sections are usually assumed to exist locally on the basethe bundle being locally trivial, so that the local structure is that of a cartesian product. But sections will often not exist globally. For example a differential manifold M has a principal bundle of frames associated to its tangent bundle. A global section will exist (by definition) only when M is parallelizable, which implies strong topological restrictions.|$|E

500|$|The name Milnrow {{is derived}} from Old English, but its meaning has not been deciphered with any certainty.

500|$|Allmusic {{reviewer}} James Christopher Monger said [...] "The Downfall of Us All" [...] {{would gain}} an extra [...] "life in countless montages on MTV reality shows and 30-second cola commercials".

Monger called the backing vocals [...] "exciting at first", but felt that they [...] "eventually dissolve into the waves of distortion mid-album", becoming an [...] "audio equivalent of an energy drink crash". The final track, [...] "If <b>It</b> <b>Means</b> <b>a</b> Lot to You", as Monger noted, {{was different from the}} preceding tracks, as they were [...] "deafening, ultimately forgettable, over-compressed slabs of twentysomething angst".
