40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} the oral aselective dopamine congener <b>ibopamine,</b> heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac rhythm, electrocardiographic (ECG) parameters and plasma catecholamines were studied in ten healthy subjects on three occasions: without medication, after 100 mg oral <b>ibopamine</b> and after combined treatment of <b>ibopamine</b> and the dopamine antagonist metoclopramide. <b>Ibopamine</b> was well tolerated by all subjects. No significant changes in heart rate or blood pressure were seen during either <b>ibopamine</b> alone or during concomitant metoclopramide administration. In addition, there were no differences in PR-, QRS- and QTc- intervals on the ECG and plasma norepinephrine, epinephrine and dopamine levels were unchanged. None of the ten volunteers showed proarrhythmia from <b>ibopamine.</b> However, in one subject, episodes of accelerated idioventricular rhythm were observed after <b>ibopamine,</b> which were asymptomatic and did not exceed a rate of 51 beats/minute. During concomitant metoclopramide infusion, <b>ibopamine</b> did not induce accelerated idioventricular rhythm.

40|$|Programmed {{electrical}} stimulation {{was performed in}} 12 patients with moderate to severe congestive heart failure and ventricular tachycardia (VT) to study possible arrhythmogenic properties of <b>ibopamine,</b> a new orally active dopamine agonist. <b>Ibopamine</b> induced no significant changes in spontaneous cycle length, PR, QRS, QTc, AH or HV intervals, and also right ventricular effective refractory periods were unaffected (for paced cycle lengths of 600 and 430 ms, respectively, using 1 extrastimulus: 287 +/- 16 ms at baseline vs 283 +/- 27 ms after <b>ibopamine</b> and 270 +/- 23 ms during the control study vs 262 +/- 19 ms after <b>ibopamine).</b> In 6 of the 8 patients with coronary artery disease but in none of the 4 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, sustained VT was induced before and after <b>ibopamine.</b> Proarrhythmia was present in 1 patient, who became inducible after <b>ibopamine.</b> However, 1 patient had sustained VT only at baseline but not after <b>ibopamine.</b> The number of extrastimuli required for VT induction was equal (2. 7 +/- 0. 2 vs 2. 7 +/- 0. 2). Holter monitoring showed no changes in ventricular premature complexes, ventricular couplets and runs of VT after 1 week of <b>ibopamine</b> therapy. The signal-averaged electrocardiogram was abnormal in 11 and showed late potentials in 5 patients, but no changes occurred after <b>ibopamine.</b> During hemodynamic evaluation, increases in cardiac (32 %) and stroke volume (34 %) indexes were seen after administration of 100 mg of <b>ibopamine,</b> accompanied by a decrease in vascular resistance and filling pressures. Plasma norepinephrine decreased significantly after <b>ibopamine</b> (p = 0. 02) but plasma epinephrine was unaffected.

A small and temporary rise of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was found after <b>ibopamine</b> without but not with metoclopramide pretreatment. No differences in effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) but a small rise in sodium excretion were observed comparing <b>ibopamine</b> with control.

40|$|PURPOSE: <b>Ibopamine</b> is a prodrug of N-methyldopamine {{that has}} a non-cycloplegic {{mydriatic}} action due to its alpha-adrenergic properties {{and is able to}} induce, when topically given, a transient increase of intraocular pressure (IOP) in eyes with hydrodynamic disorders.

Forty patients (20 open-angle glaucoma patients and 20 healthy subjects) were treated with <b>ibopamine</b> 2 % eye drops and phenylephrine 10 % eye drops. RESULTS: <b>Ibopamine</b> induced a significant increase in IOP only in glaucomatous eyes (p< 0. 001) without a significant hypertensive effect in normal eyes. <b>Ibopamine</b> and phenylephrine showed a similar mydriatic activity but <b>ibopamine</b> was able to induce an hypertensive effect only in glaucomatous eyes.

40|$|The {{effects of}} 100 mg <b>ibopamine,</b> an orally active aselective {{dopamine}} (DA) agonist, on plasma catecholamines was evaluated in 8 healthy men during sympathetic stimulation by graded exercise in a single-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study. The exercise consisted of progressive cycling activity less-than-or-equal-to 90 % {{of the previously}} determined VO 2 max. Graded exercise resulted {{in an increase in}} systolic and mean blood pressure (SBP, MBP), heart rate, norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine level, with a decrease in diastolic BP (DBP). The increase in NE was significantly blunted by <b>ibopamine</b> as compared with placebo. No differences for BP, heart rate (HR), or epinephrine between placebo- and <b>ibopamine</b> study day were noted. In previous studies, <b>ibopamine</b> decreased resting plasma NE in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), whereas plasma NE was not altered by <b>ibopamine</b> in healthy volunteers. This different outcome in both categories might therefore be explained by the absence of substantial sympathetic stimulation in normal humans at rest. Because {{it is reasonable to assume}} that the effect of <b>ibopamine</b> on systemic and local hemodynamics is negligible as compared with the effect of exercise in the healthy volunteers, the plasma decrease caused by <b>ibopamine</b> is probably related to stimulation of DA 2 -receptors.

40|$|Background: Topically {{administered}} 2 % <b>ibopamine</b> (a dopaminergic agonist) induces a transitory ocular hypertension in 92 % {{of patients}} with primary open-angle glaucoma and in 52 % {{of patients with}} normal tension glaucoma. In normal eyes, <b>ibopamine</b> {{has no effect on}} IOP. Purpose: The aim {{of the present study was}} to verify, by means of fluorophotometric techniques, which hydrodynamic changes could be induced in normal and glaucomatous eyes, stimulating the D 1 receptor with 2 % <b>ibopamine</b> administered topically. In addiction, we wanted to evaluate if <b>ibopamine</b> could modify IOP before and after an experimentally induced outflow system impairment in rabbits. Methods: In study 1 we performed a measurement of aqueous humor flow in 6 healthy volunteers and in 6 glaucomatous patients, before and after 2 % <b>ibopamine</b> administration. In study 2 the alteration of outflow pathways was induced by means of Laminaria Digitata in 10 rabbits. Results: After 2 % <b>ibopamine</b> administration we found a significant increase in aqueous humor production, both in glaucomatous (P = 0. 035) and normal eyes (P = 0. 004). In rabbits, we found no significant change in IOP at basal conditions. After experimentally induced outflow system impairment by laminaria, we observed a marked increase in IOP (+ 13. 5 mmHg SD 7. 2; P < = 0. 001) following <b>ibopamine</b> administration. Conclusions: These experimental data have a diagnostic value in glaucoma, since they show how an intraocular hypertensive response due to <b>ibopamine</b> in normotensive eyes is a sign of initial outflow impairment, Moreover, the possibility to increase the aqueous humor production sets new trends in the treatment of post surgical ocular hypotony...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To compare intraocular {{pressure}} (IOP) rise in normal individuals and primary open-angle glaucoma patients {{and the safety}} and efficacy of <b>ibopamine</b> eye drops in different concentrations as a provocative test for glaucoma. METHODS: Glaucoma patients underwent (same eye) the <b>ibopamine</b> provocative test with two concentrations, 1 % and 2 %, in a random sequence at least 3 weeks apart, {{but not more than}} 3 months. The normal individuals were randomly submitted to one of the concentrations of <b>ibopamine</b> (1 % and 2 %). The test was considered positive if there was an IOP rise greater than 3 or 4 mmHg at 30 or 45 minutes to test which subset of the test has the best sensitivity (Se) /specificity (Sp). RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in any of the IOP measurements, comparing 1 % with 2 % <b>ibopamine.</b> The IOP was significantly higher at 30 and 45 minutes with both concentrations (p< 0. 001). The best sensitivity/specificity ratio was achieved with the cutoff point set as greater than 3 mmHg at 45 minutes with 2 % <b>ibopamine</b> (area under the ROC curve: 0. 864, Se: 84. 6 %; Sp: 73. 3 %). All patients described a slight burning after ibopamine's instillation. CONCLUSION: 2 % <b>ibopamine</b> is recommended as a provocative test for glaucoma.

40|$|<b>Ibopamine</b> is the prodrug of epinine or N-methyl dopamine. <b>Ibopamine</b> {{stimulates the}} DA 1 and DA 2 dopaminergic receptors, the beta 1 and beta 2 adrenoceptors, and the alpha 1 and alpha 2 adrenoceptors. <b>Ibopamine</b> has {{varying degrees of}} {{affinity}} for these various families, being the highest for the dopamine receptors and the lowest for the alpha adrenergic receptors. In the clinical setting, there is a dose-related hemodynamic and neurohormonal response. In patients with heart failure (HF), low doses appear to exert beneficial neurohormonal, hemodynamic, and renal effects, without increased inotropic effects. However, at higher doses (> 200 mg) <b>ibopamine</b> exerts effects that {{do not appear to}} be clinically useful in long-term treatment of chronic HF. Several small trials have suggested a benefit of <b>ibopamine</b> on exercise performance in patients with mild to moderate HF.

40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence that both neurohumoral and hemodynamic factors {{play a role}} in disease progression in chronic heart failure (CHF). To examine the influence of the oral dopamine agonist <b>ibopamine</b> on these factors, we studied 20 rats with chronic myocardial infarction and CHF, and compared them with 20 normal rats. After 6 weeks, rats were randomly divided between control treatment (50 %) or <b>ibopamine</b> (50 %) for 3 weeks. At the end of the study, plasma and tissue neurohumoral parameters, as well as hemodynamics, were determined. In infarcted rats, the elevated plasma norepinephrine (PNE) levels were reduced by <b>ibopamine</b> (251 +/- 19 vs. 138 +/- 32 pg/ml; p < 0. 05). Other plasma neurohormones measured (epinephrine, renin, aldosterone, and angiotensin converting enzyme [ACE]) were not significantly increased in rats with myocardial infarction and were not affected by <b>ibopamine.</b> Cardiac (tissue) ACE was increased in infarcted rats (12. 1 +/- 1. 9 U/l/min) and was significantly lowered by <b>ibopamine</b> (9. 6 +/- 1. 0 U/l/min; p < 0. 05); renal ACE was unaffected. Blood pressure and heart rate were similar in the two groups and were not influenced by <b>ibopamine</b> treatment.

40|$|To {{study the}} hemodynamic and renal {{effects of the}} orally (p. o.) active {{dopamine}} (DA) agonist <b>ibopamine,</b> we examined 10 patients with mild to moderate congestive heart failure (CHF), who were stable while treated with digoxin and diuretics. All patients were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II-III; their mean age was 63 years (range 51 - 79 years), and mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 28 % (range 18 - 36 %). The protocol consisted of a control study-day with measurements of renal characteristics including glomerular filtration rate (GFR), effective renal plasma flow (ERPF), and filtration fraction (FF). One week Later, systemic and renal hemodynamics were measured simultaneously before and after patients received one 100 -mg tablet of <b>ibopamine.</b> <b>Ibopamine</b> caused a slight but significant increase in both ERPF (from 288 +/- 32 ml/min/ 1. 73 m(2) at baseline to 316 +/- 32 ml/min/ 1. 73 m(2) after <b>ibopamine)</b> and GFR (from 77 +/- 8 to 85 +/- 8 ml/min/ 1. 73 m(2); both p < 0. 05); FF was not affected (mean value 0. 26 +/- 0. 02). Sodium excretion was not influenced by <b>ibopamine,</b> but diuresis increased significantly. Cardiac output (CO) increased significantly (from 4. 0 +/- 0. 4 L/min at baseline {{to a maximum of}} 5. 0 L/min after <b>ibopamine,</b> p < 0. 05), mainly due to decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR). Heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) were unchanged throughout the studies. The percentage of contribution of CO to renal blood flow (RBF) was not significantly affected by <b>ibopamine.</b> In conclusion, <b>ibopamine</b> causes a slight but significant increase in both ERPF and GFR and a significant increase in diuresis, but no increase in sodium excretion in patients with mild to moderate CHF. In addition, the drug increases CO and decreases SVR to a similar extent. Therefore, the renal effects of <b>ibopamine</b> with equal pre- and postglomerular vasodilation, appear to be primarily due to its systemic hemodynamic effects...|$|E
40|$|<b>Ibopamine</b> is a pro-drug of epinine, a {{dopamine}} analogue, which stimulates dopaminergic, beta-adrenergic and, at high concentrations, alpha-adrenergic receptors. On {{the basis}} of the results obtained by the authors since 5 years, <b>ibopamine</b> administered topically at a concentration of 2 % owns the property of determining, besides a marked mydriasis without cycloplegia, an ocular hypertensiue activity lasting 1 to 2 hours, in 92 % of patients with high-tension open-angle glaucoma, in 34 % of subjects with borderline IOP and in 76 % of patients with normal pressure glaucoma.

These data speak in favour of the clinical application of <b>ibopamine</b> as a valuable provocative test in glaucoma.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{correlate}} the <b>ibopamine</b> provocative {{test with}} the diurnal tension curve (highest intraocular pressure-IOP and range) in glaucoma. METHODS: This is a prospective case series including glaucoma patients from the Federal University of Goiás, Glaucoma Service.

Intraocular pressure was checked before and 30 and 45 minutes after the second <b>ibopamine</b> instillation. Thereafter, the diurnal tension curve of each patient was assessed with five independent measurements (at every 2 : 30 hours), from 8 : 00 o'clock AM to 6 : 00 o'clock PM. Pearson's correlation coefficient {{was used to test}} the linear relation between the intraocular pressure after the <b>ibopamine</b> instillation with the highest intraocular pressure value and the intraocular pressure range in the diurnal curve. RESULTS: Thirty-one eyes from 22 patients were included.

40|$|Purpose. <b>Ibopamine</b> is a {{new drug}} with {{mydriatic}} properties without cycloplegia. <b>Ibopamine</b> induces no increase of IOP in healthy eyes but in patients with POAG it provokes an increase of IOP in a high precentage of eyes (92 %). In view of such properties <b>Ibopamine</b> was proposed as provocative test in the diagnostic iter of glaucoma. The present paper describes our last results about these findings. Methods. We performed an <b>Ibopamine</b> provocative test in 2 groups of subjects: 1) 163 healthy normotensive volunteers (326 eyes); 2) 175 patients with POAG (250 eyes). In 80 patients (40 healthy volunteers and 40 POAG patients) the test was repeated after pretreatement with an alpha-blocker (thymoxamine) to evaluate the influence of mydriasis on the hypertensive response. Results. No IOP increase over 2 mmHg were ever observed in healthy volunteers (mean changes - 0. 9 mmHg SD 1. 88). In POAG patients we noticed an increase greater than 3 mmHg in 90 % (224 eyes) of the examined eyes (mean increase 7. 8 mmHg SD 4. 2). The pretreatment with thymoxamine did not modify significantly the hypertensive response to <b>Ibopamine.</b> Conclusions.

40|$|PURPOSE. To {{compare the}} {{mydriatic}} effects of 2 % <b>ibopamine</b> and collyrium containing 10 % phenylephrine + 0. 5 % tropicamide and {{to study the}} associated drug in patients with ocular pseudoexfoliation (PEX) syndrome. METHODS. This was a prospective, comparative, interventional clinical study. The study group consisted of 20 patients with ocular PEX syndrome. Intervention procedures included administration of 10 % phenylephrine- 0. 5 % tropicamide versus 2 % <b>ibopamine</b> versus 2 % <b>ibopamine</b> followed by the combination drug. Main outcome measurement was mydriatic efficacy {{measured in terms of}} mean pupil diameter. Adverse effects on intraocular pressure (IOP) were measured with a Goldmann applanation tonometer. Mean premedication pupil diameters in all patients were less than 3. 5 mm. RESULTS. Instillation of 10 % phenylephrine- 0. 5 % tropicamide caused significantly greater mydriasis than 2 % <b>ibopamine</b> (pupil diameters: 6. 17 mm, SD= 1. 14 versus 5. 33 mm, SD= 1. 34; p< 0. 001). Combined use of both collyria significantly increased mydriasis (7. 19 mm; SD= 0. 69) compared with that induced by either of the products alone (p< 0. 001). Inadequate mydriasis (pupil diameters < 5. 5 mm) was observed in 2 patients after administration of 10 % phenylephrine- 0. 5 % tropicamide and in 10 following instillation of 2 % <b>ibopamine,</b> but the addition of 10 % phenylephrine - 0. 5 % tropicamide to ibopamine-treated eyes resulted in adequate dilation in all cases. IOP increases of 4 mmHg over baseline values were observed in 12 (60 %) patients after 2 % <b>ibopamine.</b> CONCLUSIONS. In patients with ocular PEX, instillation of 2 % <b>ibopamine</b> exerts a significant additive effect on mydriasis induced with 10 % phenylephrine- 0. 5 % tropicamide with only minimal increases in IOP.

40|$|Background Drugs {{that improve}} {{symptoms}} {{in patients with}} heart failure must also be assessed for their effects on survival. <b>Ibopamine</b> stimulates DA- 1 and DA- 2 receptors and causes peripheral and renal vasodilatation; the drug improves symptoms of heart failure. We assessed the effect of <b>ibopamine</b> on survival in patients with advanced heart failure in a multicentre, randomised placebo-controlled study. Methods Patients with advanced severe heart failure (New York Heart Association classes III and IV) and evidence of severe left-ventricular disease, who were already receiving optimum treatment for heart failure, were randomly allocated oral <b>ibopamine</b> 100 mg three times daily or placebo. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. The {{study was designed to}} recruit 2200 patients, and the minimum duration of treatment would be 6 months. We did intention-to-treat and on-treatment analyses; a post-hoc subgroup analysis was also done. Findings After we had recruited 1906 patients the trial was stopped early, because of an excess of deaths among patients in the <b>ibopamine</b> group. 232 (25 %) of 953 patients in the <b>ibopamine</b> group died, compared with 193 (20 %) of 953 patients in the placebo group (relative risk 1. 26 [95 % CI 1. 04 - 1. 53], p= 0. 017). The average length of follow-up was 347 days in the <b>ibopamine</b> group and 363 days in the placebo group. In multivariate analysis, only the use of antiarrhythmic drugs at baseline was a significant independent predictor of increased fatality in ibopamine-treated patients. Interpretation <b>Ibopamine</b> seems to increase the risk of death among patients with advanced heart failure who are already receiving optimum therapy, but the reasons for this increase are not clear. Our finding that antiarrhythmic treatment {{was a significant predictor of}} increased mortality in ibopamine-treated patients may be important, but exploratory analyses must be interpreted with caution...|$|E
40|$|In a {{prospective}} open study we evaluated whether intravenous dopamine infusions {{can be safely}} switched to enterally administered <b>ibopamine</b> in dopamine-dependent patients. Six patients defined as being clinically stable, normovolaemic, but dopamine dependent, i. e. with repeated inability to stop intravenous dopamine, were included. <b>Ibopamine</b> was administered via a nasogastric or nasoduodenal tube. During the initial 48 -hour period of <b>ibopamine</b> administration the dopamine infusion was gradually decreased and then discontinued.

40|$|Objectives. This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the efficacy and safety of long-term treatment with the orally active dopamine agonist <b>ibopamine</b> in patients with mild to moderate chronic congestive heart failure and to compare the results with those of treatment with digoxin and placebo. Background. <b>Ibopamine</b> and digoxin are drugs that exert hemodynamic and neurohumoral effects. Because there is accumulating evidence that progression of disease in chronic heart failure is related not only to hemodynamic but also to neurohumoral factors, both drugs might be expected to have a favorable long-term effect. Methods. We studied 161 patients with mild to moderate chronic heart failure (80 % in New York Heart Association functional class II and 20 % in class In), who were treated with <b>ibopamine</b> (n = 53), digoxin (n = 55) or placebo (n = 53) for 6 months. Background therapy consisted of furosemide (0 to 80 mg); all other drugs for heart failure were excluded. Clinical assessments were made at baseline and after 1, 3 and 6 months. Results. Of the 161 patients, 128 (80 %) completed the study. Compared with placebo, digoxin but not <b>ibopamine</b> significantly increased exercise time after 6 months (p = 0. 008 by intention to treat analysis). <b>Ibopamine</b> was only effective in patients with relatively preserved left ventricular function, as it significantly increased exercise time in this subgroup (for patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction > 0. 30; p = 0. 018 vs, placebo). No patient receiving digoxin withdrew from the study because of progression of heart failure, compared with six patients receiving <b>ibopamine</b> and two receiving placebo. At 6 months, plasma norepinephrine was decreased with digoxin and <b>ibopamine</b> therapy (- 106 and - 13 pg/ml, respectively) but increased with placebo administration (+ 62 pg/ml) (both p < 0. 05 vs. placebo). Plasma aldosterone was unaffected, but renin was decreased by both agents after 6 months (p < 0. 05 vs. placebo). Total mortality and ambulatory arrhythmias were not significantly affected by the two drugs. Conclusions. <b>Ibopamine</b> and digoxin both inhibit neurohumoral activation in patients with mild to moderate chronic heart failure. However, the clinical effects of these drugs are different and appear {{to be related to the}} degree of left ventricular dysfunction...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the effects of <b>ibopamine</b> 100 mg three times daily compared with captopril 25 mg three times daily on exercise capacity in patients with chronic heart failure. DESIGN: A randomised, double blind, parallel group comparison of the addition of <b>ibopamine</b> versus captopril during a period of 24 weeks. SETTING: 26 outpatient cardiology clinics in seven European countries. PATIENTS: 266 patients, with mild to moderate chronic heart failure (New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II, 81 % and III, 19 %) and evidence of an enlarged left ventricle. Patients received concomitant treatment with diuretics and/or digitalis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Exercise duration after 24 weeks of treatment, compared with baseline. RESULTS: Mean (SD) ejection fraction was 29 (8) % and the baseline exercise duration in the captopril and <b>ibopamine</b> groups 665 (160) and 675 (174) seconds, respectively. At the end of the study, exercise duration had improved in both groups, by 29 seconds in the <b>ibopamine</b> group (P < 0. 01), and by 24 seconds in the captopril group (P < 0. 05). There was no difference between groups (P = 0. 69, 95 % confidence interval - 22 to 33). NYHA class, signs and symptoms score, and dyspnoea and fatigue index improved equally in both groups. The total number of adverse events was the same in both treatment groups, but gastrointestinal complaints occurred more often in the <b>ibopamine</b> group. The number of patients with premature withdrawals was no different. CONCLUSIONS: No difference was detected between the effect of captopril and <b>ibopamine</b> on exercise time in patients with mild to moderate heart failure during a treatment period of 24 weeks...|$|E
