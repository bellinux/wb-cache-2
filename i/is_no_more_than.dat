5|$|Userkaf's pyramid {{is part of}} {{a larger}} {{mortuary}} complex comprising a mortuary temple, an offering chapel and a cult pyramid as well as separate pyramid and mortuary temple for Userkaf's wife, queen Neferhetepes. Userkaf's mortuary temple and cult pyramid are today completely ruined and difficult to recognize. The pyramid of the queen <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a mound of rubble, with its funerary chamber exposed by stone robbers.|$|E
5|$|Fra Mauro {{is thought}} to have been formed from ejecta, or debris, from the impact which formed Mare Imbrium. During Apollo 14, the crew members sampled ejecta from Cone crater, a feature close in {{proximity}} to the immediate landing site of the mission, which provided insight into the composition of material deep inside the formation. Data from the mission has helped to determine the approximate age of Mare Imbrium, suggesting that it <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> about 4.25 billion years old.|$|E

5|$|Mount Bailey {{heads the}} Mount Bailey chain, which {{consists}} of the mountain and smaller cinder cones trending north. Similarly to its neighbor Mount Thielsen, it is a shield volcano with precipitous summit slopes, and the two are almost equal in appearance. Built {{around the same time}} as Rodley Butte, according to morphological study, the current volcano <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 100,000 years old, and formed relatively close to Diamond Peak's current cone. Despite its similarity to Rodley Butte, both in age and original composition, Bailey switched from erupting basaltic andesite to pure andesite (silicon dioxide).|$|E
5|$|The 767 {{features}} a twin-aisle cabin with a typical configuration of six abreast in business class and seven across in economy. The standard seven abreast, 2–3–2 economy class layout places approximately 87percent of all seats at a window or aisle. As a result, the aircraft can be largely occupied before center seats {{need to be}} filled, and each passenger <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one seat from the aisle. It is possible to configure the aircraft with extra seats for up to an eight abreast configuration, but this is less common.|$|E
5|$|The Old Man of Hoy is a 449-foot (137m) sea stack on {{the island}} of Hoy, part of the Orkney {{archipelago}} off the north coast of Scotland. Formed from Old Red Sandstone, {{it is one of the}} tallest stacks in Britain. The Old Man is popular with climbers, and was first climbed in 1966. Created by the erosion of a cliff through hydraulic action some time after 1750, the stack <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a few hundred years old, and may soon collapse into the sea.|$|E

5|$|Examination of M87 at far {{infrared}} wavelengths shows an excess emission at wavelengths longer than 25μm. Normally such emission {{may be an}} indication of thermal emission by warm dust. However, {{in the case of}} M87, the emission appears to be fully explained by synchrotron radiation from the jet. Within the galaxy, silicate grains are expected to survive for no more than 46million years because of the X-ray emission from the core. This dust may be destroyed by the hostile environment or expelled from the galaxy. The combined mass of dust in this galaxy <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 70,000 times the mass of the Sun. By comparison, the Milky Way contains about a hundred million (108) solar masses worth of dust.|$|E
5|$|The {{return of}} royal burials to Thebes {{after the end}} of the Amarna period marks a change to the layout of royal burials, with the {{intermediate}} 'jogged axis' gradually giving way to the 'straight axis' of later dynasties. In the Western Valley, there is a tomb commencement that is thought to have been started for Akhenaten, but it <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a gateway and a series of steps. The tomb of Ay, Tutankhamun's successor is close by. It is likely that this tomb was started for Tutankhamun (its decoration is of a similar style) but later usurped for Ay's burial. This would mean that KV62 may have been Ay's original tomb, which would explain the smaller size and unusual layout for a royal tomb.|$|E
