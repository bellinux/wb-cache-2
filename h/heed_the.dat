5|$|During {{his reign}} as emperor, Caracalla raised the annual pay {{of an average}} legionary from 2000 sesterces (500 denarii) to 2700–3000 sesterces (675–750 denarii). He lavished many {{benefits}} on the army, which he both feared and admired, {{in accordance with the}} advice given by his father on his deathbed always to <b>heed</b> <b>the</b> welfare of the soldiers and ignore everyone else. Caracalla needed to gain and keep the trust of the military, and he did so with generous pay raises and popular gestures. He spent much of his time with the soldiers, so much so that he began to imitate their dress and adopt their manners.|$|E
5|$|A {{little over}} {{an hour after the}} committee's meeting, Governor Taylor {{declared}} a state of insurrection and called out the state militia. He called the legislature into special session, not in Frankfort, but in heavily Republican London, which he insisted was a safer location. Defiant Democratic legislators refused to <b>heed</b> <b>the</b> call to London, but when they attempted to convene first in the state capitol and later in other public locations in Frankfort, they found the doors barred by armed citizens. On January 31, 1900, they convened secretly in a Frankfort hotel, with no Republicans present, and voted to certify the findings of the contest committee, invalidating enough votes to make Goebel governor. Goebel was sworn in, and immediately ordered the state militia to stand down. He also ordered the General Assembly to reconvene in Frankfort. The Republican militia refused to disband, and a rival Democratic militia formed across the lawn of the state capitol. Civil war seemed possible.|$|E
5|$|At noon on September 3, a {{hurricane}} watch was issued for the Leeward Islands, which at 6 p.m. was upgraded to a warning. Also at 6 p.m., hurricane watches were raised for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, which at 6 a.m. on September 4, were upgraded to warnings. By 6 a.m. on September 5, hurricane warnings were dropped for the Leeward Islands, and at 9 a.m., southwest Puerto Rico and the Virgin Island's hurricane warnings were downgraded to gale warnings. By noon, all remaining hurricane warnings for Puerto Rico were changed to gale warnings. In Puerto Rico, flood warnings were issued on September 5, although some {{residents in the}} region did not <b>heed</b> <b>the</b> notice; many returned to their homes after the hurricane passed to the north. On Vieques Island, about 1,700 United States Marines evacuated to naval ships. Officials advised small boats to remain at port, and thousands of residents evacuated to schools set up as Red Cross shelters. Along the Cuban coast, about 3,000people evacuated inland or to churches and schools; while in the Bahamas, stores closed and boats were sent to port.|$|E

5|$|Dokeianos re-appears in 1050, when he {{held the}} titles of patrikios and vestarches, {{as part of an}} {{imperial}} expedition against the Pechenegs who raided Thrace. The imperial commander-in-chief, the eunuch praipositos Constantine, a militarily inexperienced court favourite of Emperor Constantine IX (r. 1042–55), listened to his advice on fortifying the army's encampment, but when the Pechenegs appeared before Adrianople, he refused to <b>heed</b> <b>the</b> opinion of the magistros Constantine Arianites to wait and attack the Pechenegs on their return journey, and instead marched to meet them in the open field of Basilike Libas, resulting in a devastating defeat: Arianites fell, while Dokeianos was taken prisoner. As he was brought before the Pecheneg leader, however, Dokeianos seized a sword from one of his guards and slashed at the leader, cutting off one of his arms, whereupon the enraged Pechenegs killed him and, according to Michael Attaleiates, opened his belly, cut off his arms and legs and placed them in it.|$|E
5|$|While {{weakening}} after peaking in intensity, Oliwa passed about 60miles (95km) {{north of}} Agrihan in the Northern Marianas Islands. Sustained winds {{on the island}} reached 75mph (120km/h), with gusts to 85mph (135km/h). The winds downed two coconut trees onto a radio antenna, which left the island temporarily without contact to the outside world. On the Japanese island of Kyushu, where Oliwa made landfall as a weakened typhoon, thousands of homes were flooded, and dozens were destroyed. Its slow movement caused heavy rainfall that created a mudslide in Tashiro, Kagoshima, killing three people. Across Kagoshima Prefecture, officials issued evacuations due to flooding, although many did not <b>heed</b> <b>the</b> warnings. In the prefecture, the typhoon destroyed 131buildings and damaged about 1,700more. Damage there was estimated at 14million yen (1997JPY, $150,000 in 1997USD). Across Japan, Typhoon Oliwa caused 12fatalities and displaced a total of 30,000people. Total damage amounted to 4.36billion yen ($50.1million USD). Offshore the South Korea coast, the winds and strong waves wrecked 28vessels, and 10people were reported missing from one ship.|$|E

25|$|A Japanese {{government}} {{study found}} that 58% of people in coastal areas in Iwate, Miyagi, and Fukushima prefectures heeded tsunami warnings immediately after the quake and headed for higher ground.

25|$|Hopkins' {{support of}} Abraham Lincoln also often {{put him at}} odds with some of Maryland's most {{prominent}} people, particularly Supreme Court Justice Roger B.

In 1862 Hopkins {{wrote a letter to}} Lincoln requesting the President not to <b>heed</b> <b>the</b> detractors' calls and continue to keep soldiers stationed in Maryland. Hopkins also pledged financial and logistic support to Lincoln, in particular the free use of the B railway system.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} stages of World War II, Thompson worked at an {{aircraft}} factory where he was investigated by the FBI because of his early Communist Party affiliation. These events were fodder for his semi-autobiographical debut novel, Now And On Earth (1942). Featuring little of the violence and crime that later permeated his writing, though it did establish his bleak, pessimistic tone, it was positively reviewed but sold poorly. His second novel, <b>Heed</b> <b>The</b> Thunder (1946), found Thompson steering towards crime; it details a warped and violent Nebraska family, partly modeled on his own extended clan.|$|E
25|$|On March 27, Lin Fei-fan, one of {{the student}} leaders of the movement, called for a March 30 rally filling the Ketagalan Boulevard leading from the Presidential Office to the {{legislature}} {{in order to put}} pressure on President Ma to <b>heed</b> <b>the</b> demonstrators' demands. The organizers behind the demonstration said around 500,000 people massed in the March 30 rally, while the police estimate the figure to be 116,000. Twenty-two NGOs also took part in the rally. Hundreds of people opposing the movement held a concurrent rally in the same area, but left before the students dispersed.|$|E

25|$|Local legends by the Chagga {{people tell}} {{how a man}} named Tone once {{provoked}} a god, Ruwa, to bring famine upon the land. The people became angry at Tone, forcing him to flee. Nobody wanted to protect him but a solitary dweller who had stones that turned miraculously into cattle. The dweller bid that Tone never open the stable of the cattle. When Tone did not <b>heed</b> <b>the</b> warning and the cattle escaped, Tone followed them, but the fleeing cattle threw up hills to run on, including Mawenzi and Kibo. Tone finally collapsed on Kibo, ending the pursuit.|$|E
25|$|The {{air traffic}} {{controller}} had instructed a Boeing 707 to take off and help guide the 757 back in to land, but before the 707 could take off, the 757's left wingtip struck the water, approximately 25 minutes after the emergency declaration, revealing to the crew the true altitude of the airliner; the pilots struggled with the controls and managed to get airborne again for 17 seconds, but the aircraft crashed inverted into the water. All 70 passengers and crew died. The official accident report concluded that the flight crew, distracted by the conflicting warnings, did not <b>heed</b> <b>the</b> radar altimeter reading after descending through 2,500 feet.|$|E
25|$|Early on {{the morning}} of 8 June 2007, Newcastle Port Corporation radioed the 56 moored ships waiting off the coast to load coal to warn them to move out to sea to escape an {{approaching}} storm. Pasha Bulker, along with 10 other ships, did not <b>heed</b> <b>the</b> warning. As the storm hit, Pasha Bulker could not clear the coast and it beached at 9:51am. The ship never called for tug assistance, ran aground with a fully operational engine room and still had both anchors stored in the hawsepipes leading some maritime experts to believe that proper precautions were not taken by the ship's captain.|$|E

25|$|In {{the name}} of his fellow bishops Edmund admonished Henry III of England at Westminster, on 2 February 1234, to <b>heed</b> <b>the</b> example of his father, John of England. A week after his consecration he again {{appeared}} before the king with the barons and bishops, this time threatening Henry with excommunication if he refused to dismiss his councillors, particularly Peter des Roches, Bishop of Winchester. Henry yielded, and the favourites were dismissed, Hubert de Burgh (whom they had imprisoned) was released and reconciled to the king and soon the archbishop was sent to Wales to negotiate peace with Llywelyn the Great. Edmund's success, however, turned the king against him.|$|E
25|$|The post {{election}} violence therefore is, in part, {{a consequence}} of the failure of President Kibaki and his first Government to exert political control over the country or to maintain sufficient legitimacy as would have allowed a civilised contest with him at the polls to be possible. Kibaki's regime failed to unite the country, and allowed feelings of marginalisation to fester into what became the post election violence. He and his then Government were complacent in the support they considered they would receive in any election from the majority Kikuyu community and failed to <b>heed</b> <b>the</b> views of the legitimate leaders of other communities.|$|E
