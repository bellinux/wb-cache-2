25|$|Tom Ridge: I’m {{familiar}} with his claims. I’m not {{familiar with}} how accurate they are. This is a global scourge. It’s really a case of first impression for everybody. As {{secretary of homeland security}} after 9/11, I dare say America was confronted with a set of challenges it had never seen before and we acted with what we thought was in the best interest for securing America. We also looked back at what we did and made some adjustments. I’ll <b>just</b> <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> at that. We can kill bin Laden and eliminate a lot of these other extremists, but that whole belief system is out there. It doesn’t take too many people to buy in to it to cause enormous damage.|$|E
500|$|At {{a midnight}} {{show the same}} month, four men rushed onto the stage in an {{apparent}} attack. Security men leapt to Presley's defense, and the singer's karate instinct took over as he ejected one invader from the stage himself. Following the show, he became obsessed {{with the idea that}} the men had been sent by Mike Stone to kill him. Though they were shown to have been only overexuberant fans, he raged, [...] "There's too much pain in me... Stone [...] die." [...] His outbursts continued with such intensity that a physician was unable to calm him, despite administering large doses of medication. After another two full days of raging, Red West, his friend and bodyguard, felt compelled to get a price for a contract killing and was relieved when Presley decided, [...] "Aw hell, let's <b>just</b> <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> for now. Maybe it's a bit heavy." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{couple of}} months later, Toyah {{received}} a letter from Phil asking her to visit him in prison and in return he would plead guilty to raping her. Until the letter arrived, Toyah had been piecing her life back together by getting her job back at the Rovers and starting a romance with Sam. Of how Toyah felt about the letter, Taylor told Adrian Lobb from Inside Soap, [...] "By the time Toyah gets the letter, she has grown a little stronger. But it comes as a complete surprise. Toyah doesn't trust Phil, obviously, and she thinks he's playing games. While part of her wants to confront him about the attack, there's another side of her that wants to let it go, and <b>just</b> <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> to the courts to deal with him." [...] Toyah agreed to Phil's request to visit him and Taylor said that Toyah believed that seeing Phil in person would help her {{to come to terms with}} what happened. When Toyah came face to face with Phil, her first thought was how pathetic he looked. When Phil tried to make excuses for what he had done, Toyah did not feel any pity and told him to plead guilty, which he agreed to do. Toyah left the prison feeling [...] "tearful, but triumphant" [...] and Taylor commented that while she would never fully recover from her ordeal, Toyah was determined to look towards the future.|$|E

We would rather put all the names in a hat and draw one out, <b>just</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>it</b> to chance." ...|$|R

He is a popular man in the regiment; and as he is only <b>just</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>it</b> he is known to them all, while there are not above {{a quarter of the}} men who knew me as a comrade in the old days." ...|$|R
2500|$|McKay was {{concerned}} with missionary work, and coined the phrase [...] "very member a missionary" [...] {{in order to encourage}} church members to become more engaged in that work, and not <b>just</b> <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> to the full-time missionaries.|$|E
2500|$|In his December 8, 2010 {{appearance}} on The Colbert Report, Stephen Colbert asked Fairey {{how he felt}} about having done the [...] "HOPE" [...] portrait of Obama and how [...] "that hope was working out for him now?" [...] to which Fairey replied: [...] "You know, I'm proud of it as a piece of grassroots activism, but I'll <b>just</b> <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> at that".|$|E
2500|$|Sometimes with {{creative}} things [...] all comes together [...] and sometimes things almost {{come together and}} it's better to <b>just</b> <b>leave</b> <b>it.</b> So we love that song. We had a ball shooting the video. It {{just so happens that}} the whole thing, for some reason or another, didn't quite come together so we just decided to leave it. And that's what happened.|$|E

60|$|Jumper drew a {{long breath}} and settled his long hind feet for a great jump, hoping to so take Whitey the Owl by {{surprise}} {{that he might be}} able to get away. And as Jumper did this, he looked over to that stump where Whitey had been sitting so long. Whitey was <b>just</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>it</b> on his great silent wings, and his fierce yellow eyes were fixed in the direction of Shadow the Weasel. He had seen that moving black spot which was the tip of Shadow's tail.|$|R

2500|$|In late 2009, they {{announced}} that writing has begun on Series 5, but by May 2010, Turner said: [...] "We sort of {{felt like it}} was the end two years ago. We thought, ‘We’ve done enough and the well is dry and we can’t think of any more ideas’ … We think we might <b>just</b> <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> for now." [...] The movie was was released in 2012.|$|E
2500|$|The album {{takes its}} title from a quote often {{attributed}} to Hassan-i-Sabbah: [...] "Nothing is true, everything is permitted". When {{it comes to}} how this quote relates to the album's concept, Turner is again reluctant to reveal too much. [...] "I'll just say that much of working on this record, for me, was about the power and nature of perception, {{and the ways in}} which it affects our behavior and the way we see the world," [...] he says. [...] "I'll <b>just</b> <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> at that, and people can draw their own conclusions." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Reagan Administration {{actively}} {{sought to}} diminish Israel's voice and {{influence over the}} deal. In public speeches, Administration officials admonished Israel for getting involved in a U.S. foreign policy matter. Secretary of State Alexander Haig said the President must be [...] "free of the restraints of overriding external vetoes," [...] {{and went on to}} say that were the AWACS deal blocked by Israeli influence, there would be [...] "serious implications on all American policies in the Middle East. ... I'll <b>just</b> <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> there." [...] Reagan himself declared, [...] "It is not the business of other nations to make American foreign policy." ...|$|E
5000|$|It frightened the {{residents}} {{in the area and}} some of the merchants wrote letters to the police department asking them to deny a permit to the owners. The Ambassador group had to cancel the Grateful Dead, who were booked for June 15, 1967, after posters were already made and equipment was already trucked in. On June 29, 1967, the Washington Star printed [...] "the hippies and the not so hip tangled over whether a total involvement teenage night spot should open or not in Washington". By the time of the meeting, Finestra, Rodgers and Mednick decided not to change the name, instead <b>just</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>it</b> as The Ambassador Theater.|$|R

2500|$|The [...] "independent school" [...] {{system has}} divided {{public opinion in}} Sweden. During the 2010 {{election}} neither political block suggested abandoning the program. A poll conducted in 2011 by Synovate found that Swedes who want to ban companies from operating schools for profit outnumbered those that don't. The Swedish model has been put forward as a possible model for similar solutions in both the United Kingdom and the United States, where Per Unckel, County Governor of Stockholm and former Conservative Minister of Education, in 2009 summarised {{the advantages of the}} Swedish system in an opinion piece produced by the Libertarian think tank Pacific Research Institute: [...] "Education is so important that you can’t <b>just</b> <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> to one producer. Because we know from monopoly systems that they do not fulfill all wishes".|$|E
2500|$|Elvis and Priscilla {{separated}} on February 23, 1972, {{and filed}} for legal separation on July 26. To avoid Priscilla's {{having to make}} her home address available on the public records and therefore risking the security of both her and Lisa Marie, Elvis filed for divorce on January 8, 1973. Later that month, Elvis reportedly became paranoid about Stone and said: [...] "There's too much pain in me... Stone [...] die." [...] His outbursts continued with such intensity that a physician was unable to calm him, even with large doses of medication. After another two days of raging, Elvis' friend and bodyguard, Red West, made enquiries to arrange a contract killing of Stone, but was relieved when Elvis said, [...] "Aw hell, let's <b>just</b> <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> for now. Maybe it's a bit heavy." [...] The divorce was finalized on October 9, 1973.|$|E
2500|$|In August, {{the band}} played at the Skanderborg Festival in Denmark and Parkenfestivalen in Bodø, Norway. In September, the band {{announced}} that they would release The Best of Suede on 1 November 2010. The compilation, put together by Anderson, consisted of singles, album tracks and B-sides. Shortly after the release, Suede made a short European tour from late November into December covering Spain, France, Belgium, Sweden, the Netherlands and Germany. The band concluded the tour on 7 December at the O2 Arena in London. Suede were subsequently asked whether they would produce any new material and Anderson said, [...] "Unless we were all convinced {{it would be an}} amazing record, I think we'd rather <b>just</b> <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> alone. It's not like we have to at the moment, it has to feel special and that's always been our criteria." ...|$|E
50|$|Grapus's {{split up}} {{was linked to}} a desire to {{continue}} the form of action which Grapus represented. In order to continue the Grapus mode of production, to begin {{a new form of}} adventure with new people. Their mode of production is one of conflict. “We are in conflict with the clients, but there is also conflict between us. Everyone can talk about and work on everyone else’s project.” That principle of creative conflict has been very difficult to maintain in the 1980s. When the old-timers start arguing between themselves, the younger people <b>just</b> <b>leave.</b> <b>It’s</b> like a conflict between the bosses rather than a conflict between creative peers. For the younger members of Grapus to play their part completely, we need complete equality. Thus forming three new Grapus groups.|$|R
60|$|It is glorious {{news that}} you like Tom Sawyer so well. I mean {{to see to it}} that your review of it shall have plenty of time to appear before the other notices. Mrs. Clemens decides with you that the book should issue as a book for boys, pure and simple--and so do I. It is surely the correct idea. As to that last chapter, I think of <b>just</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>it</b> off and adding nothing in its place. Something told me that the book was done when I got to that point--and so the strong temptation to put Huck's life at the Widow's into detail, instead of generalizing it in a {{paragraph}} was resisted. Just send Sawyer to me by express--I enclose money for it. If it should get lost it will be no great matter.|$|R

2500|$|In an {{interview}} on November 28, 2011, Lee Ranaldo said that Sonic Youth are [...] "ending for a while". [...] "I'm feeling {{optimistic about the future}} no matter what happens at this point", Ranaldo said. [...] "It was a pretty good tour overall. I mean, {{there was a little bit}} of tiptoeing around and some different situations with the travelling – you know, they're not sharing a room any more or anything like that [...] It remains to be seen at this point what happens. I think they are certainly the last shows for a while and I guess I'd <b>just</b> <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> at that." [...] Ranaldo also suggested there are no plans for Sonic Youth to record new material. [...] "There's tons and tons of archival projects and things like that still going on," [...] he said. [...] "I'm just happy right now to let the future take its course." ...|$|E
2500|$|Romney {{got into}} a long {{discussion}} with moderator George Stephanopoulos over whether states {{have the right to}} ban contraception or whether that was trumped by a constitutional right to privacy. Romney said, [...] "So you're asking, given the fact that there's no state that wants to do so and I don't know of any candidate that wants to do so, you're asking could it constitutionally be done? We can ask our constitutionalist here," [...] gesturing to Ron Paul, which drew laughter and applause from the audience. The discussion continued until Romney grew frustrated at the repeated questioning and asserted, [...] "States don't want to ban contraception. So why would we try {{and put it in the}} Constitution?... Contraception, it's working just fine, <b>just</b> <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> alone." [...] Stephanopoulos later joked on The Colbert Report that he had a bet with fellow moderator Diane Sawyer that he could get Romney to say [...] "contraceptions are working just fine". Jon Huntsman, in response to a question on civil unions, joked, [...] "I'm a married man. I've been married for 28 years. I have seven kids. Glad we're off the contraception discussion." ...|$|E

5000|$|Later in 916, Qing Prefecture (慶州, {{in modern}} Qingyang, Gansu) turned against Later Liang and {{surrendered}} to Qi's general Li Jizhi (李繼陟). Zhu Zhen ordered He Gui to command a Later Liang {{task force to}} counterattack, and He Gui's counterattack quickly captured Qi's Ning (寧州) and Yan (衍州) (both in modern Qingyang). [...] After Qing also fell to him in fall 917, Zhu Zhen rewarded him by making him the military governor of Xuanyi Circuit (宣義, headquartered in modern Anyang, Henan) and giving him the honorary chancellor designation of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (同中書門下平章事). Shortly after, Zhu Zhen further made him overall commander of the Later Liang forces on the northern border with Jin. (The chancellor Jing Xiang, however, appeared to be dismayed over the choice, as he submitted petition in which he urged Zhu Zhen to pay more personal attention to the campaign against Jin rather than <b>just</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>it</b> to He Gui and other generals.) ...|$|R

Then they say, 'Can’t you write another?' But if I write a sequel, let me predict what readers will say.
