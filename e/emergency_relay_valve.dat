50|$|With {{a service}} brake <b>relay</b> <b>valve</b> installed, the hose that {{connects to the}} primary delivery-port output of the foot-valve becomes a control-line (i.e., The air from the foot-valve “dead ends” at the <b>relay</b> <b>valve's</b> control-port.). Only low-volume air-signals are {{required}} to travel {{back and forth between}} the foot-valve's delivery port and the <b>relay</b> <b>valve's</b> control port; therefore, the air-volume supplied by the delivery port is now only a tiny-fraction of what otherwise would have been required had the <b>relay</b> <b>valve</b> not been installed. This reduces the delay between the application of the front and rear brakes to only a fraction of a second. When the driver depresses the brake pedal, a small amount of air momentarily opens the <b>relay</b> <b>valve's</b> supply port, which then directs air from the remote air-supply directly to the rear service brake chambers, and quickly applies the rear service brakes. The pressure delivered to the service brake chambers in this manner will equal the control-pressure delivered by the foot-valve to the <b>relay</b> <b>valve.</b> When the driver partially or fully releases the brake pedal, the control-pressure delivered by the foot-valve decreases; this causes the <b>relay</b> <b>valve's</b> supply port to close, and its exhaust port to momentarily open, thus preventing a pneumatic short-circuit from occurring while the air exhausts from all rear service brake chambers.|$|R
50|$|<b>Relay</b> <b>valves</b> {{are tested}} for {{durability}} before use through a seat test with air. In pressure at 80 psig or more, a 2-inch or smaller <b>relay</b> <b>valve</b> should not be tested for less than 15 seconds under pressure or for less than 30 seconds if it is at 3 inches in size.|$|R
50|$|Without <b>relay</b> <b>valves,</b> {{it would}} take too long for {{sufficient}} air to travel from the brake pedal valve {{to the rear of}} the truck or trailer in order to apply the rear service brakes concurrently with the front service brakes, resulting in a condition known as brake lag. To correct this condition on a long-wheel-base vehicle, a <b>relay</b> <b>valve</b> is installed near the rear service brake chambers. In tractors as well as straight-trucks, a remote air-supply is provided in the form of a large diameter pipe connected between the primary reservoir and the <b>relay</b> <b>valve</b> for remote service brake application.|$|R

A {{simulation}} {{tool for}} proportional <b>relay</b> <b>valve</b> of commercial vehicle pneumatic EBS (Electronically controlled Braking System) {{has been developed}} using MATLAB/Simulink environment and validated by testing on hardware-in-the-loop test bench focused on its pressure hysteresis characteristic.

50|$|A <b>relay</b> <b>valve</b> is an {{air-operated}} valve {{typically used}} in air brake systems to remotely control the brakes {{at the rear}} of a heavy truck or semi-trailer in a tractor-trailer combination. <b>Relay</b> <b>valves</b> are necessary in heavy trucks in order to speed-up rear-brake application and release, since air takes longer to travel {{to the rear of the}} vehicle than the front of the vehicle, where the front service brakes, foot-valve, parking-control valve, and trailer-supply valve (if applicable) are located.|$|R
50|$|A {{spring brake}} <b>relay</b> <b>valve</b> {{works on the}} same {{principle}} as the service brake <b>relay</b> <b>valve,</b> although it has the opposite effect. This type of <b>relay</b> <b>valve</b> responds to a major drop in pressure at its control-port by opening its exhaust port, which causes the air from each spring brake chamber under its control to remotely exhaust, thus applying the spring brakes much-more-quickly than would otherwise be possible if the air were required to discharge via the yellow parking-control valve on the dashboard. In a dual-circuit air brake system, air from both the primary and secondary reservoirs is fed into the supply-port of the parking-control valve, {{as well as the}} supply-port of this relay valve; it is merged via yet another two-way check valve. The delivery-port output of the parking-control valve connects to the control-port of this relay valve; this enables the spring brakes to be controlled via this valve. The merged air from the parking-control valve prevents air-loss from only one braking circuit from causing the spring brakes to automatically apply. This gives the driver more control, and prevents the vehicle from grinding to a halt in an unsafe location. However, with this increased control, comes increased responsibility {{on the part of the}} driver: If air is lost from the primary circuit alone, the spring brakes must be manually applied by the driver via the parking-control valve; otherwise, the front service brakes may not be enough to stop the vehicle safely in an emergency—especially if the vehicle is heavily loaded, and/or traveling at a high-speed. In fact, the driver's failure to manually apply the spring brakes in this situation could lead to catastrophic failure of the front brakes due to overheating, since it could cause the front service brakes to exceed their design-limit for energy absorption.QR1C air valve speeds up the process, with anti compounding, meaning trailer and service brakes will function 1 second between each other.The <b>relay</b> <b>valve's</b> function is analogous to the transistor used in electronic circuits.|$|R
2500|$|In North America, Westinghouse Air Brake {{supplied}} High Speed Control {{brake equipment}} for several post-World War II streamlined passenger trains. [...] This was an electrically controlled overlay on conventional D-22 passenger and 24-RL locomotive brake equipment. [...] On the conventional side, {{the control valve}} set a reference pressure in a volume, which set brake cylinder pressure via a <b>relay</b> <b>valve.</b> On the electric side, pressure from a second straight-air trainline controlled the <b>relay</b> <b>valve</b> via a two-way check valve. This [...] "straight air" [...] trainline was charged (from reservoirs on each car) and released by magnet valves on each car, controlled electrically by a 3 wire trainline, in turn controlled by an [...] "electro-pneumatic master controller" [...] in the controlling locomotive.

The <b>relay</b> <b>valve</b> was equipped with four diaphragms, magnet valves, electric control equipment, and an axle-mounted speed sensor, so that at speeds over [...] full braking force was applied, and reduced in steps at [...] , bringing the train to a gentle stop. [...] Each axle was also equipped with anti-lock brake equipment. [...] The combination minimized braking distances, allowing more full-speed running between stops. The [...] "straight air" [...] (electro-pneumatic trainline), [...] anti-lock, and speed graduating portions of the system were not dependent on each other in any way, and {{any or all of}} these options could be supplied separately.|$|R
40|$|Statistics {{indicate}} that defects in brake system {{contribute significantly to}} fatal crashes involving commercial vehicles. Hence {{there is a need}} for developing preventive and active safety measures for assessing the performance of an air brake system in trucks. Existing techniques for assessing the performance of brakes are infrastructure intensive, time and labor intensive. The premise of this thesis is that model-based diagnostic techniques can be employed to overcome these limitations of existing tech- niques. The design of a model-based diagnostic system requires the development and experimental corroboration of a mathematical model of the evolution of pressure in each brake chamber of a truck in response to the application of brake pedal input by the driver, when there are no faults or defects in the brake system. This thesis is aimed at modeling and experimentally corroborating a subsystem of an air brake system, namely the pneumatic <b>relay</b> <b>valve.</b> The pneumatic <b>relay</b> <b>valve</b> takes a input signal from the primary delivery of a treadle valve and meters air from a storage reservoir to Type 30 rear brake chambers. A description of the development of the model, the experimental setup and corroborating experimental results are provided...|$|R
50|$|The {{control system}} is further {{divided into two}} service brake {{circuits}}, the parking brake circuit, and the trailer brake circuit. The dual service brake circuits are further split into front and rear wheel circuits which receive compressed air from their individual reservoirs for added safety {{in case of an}} air leak. The service brakes are applied by means of a brake pedal air valve which regulates both circuits. The parking brake is the air operated spring brake type where its applied by spring force in the spring brake cylinder and released by compressed air via hand control valve. The trailer brake consists of a direct two line system: the supply line (marked red) and the separate control or service line (marked blue). The supply line receives air from the prime mover park brake air tank via a park brake <b>relay</b> <b>valve</b> and the control line is regulated via the trailer brake <b>relay</b> <b>valve.</b> The operating signals for the relay are provided by the prime mover brake pedal air valve, trailer service brake hand control (subject to local heavy vehicle legislation) and the prime mover park brake hand control.|$|R
50|$|In a truck’s {{air brake}} system, <b>relay</b> <b>valves</b> get a signal when a driver presses the treadle, which then opens the valve and allows air {{to enter the}} brake chamber via air inlet. The {{diaphragm}} gets pushed, then the rod, then the slack adjuster which twists to turn the brake camshaft. Next, it moves the disc, wedge or s-cam, which pushes the brake shoes and lining, creating friction. This friction slows and eventually stops the brake drum’s turning, which stops the wheel.|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} control the trailer service brakes, the merged outputs (i.e., merged via 2 two-way check valves {{connected}} in-series to give three inputs) of the foot-valve and trailer-hand-valve (if applicable) are directed through the tractor-protection valve, and onward towards the trailer <b>relay</b> <b>valve</b> via the blue service line. In tractors that are not equipped with a trailer hand valve, only the merged outputs of the foot-valve (i.e., via a single two-way check valve) are directed towards the trailer relay valve; however, {{the fact that the}} foot-valve's delivery-port outputs are still merged enables the trailer's service brakes to still be controlled even if there is failure within one braking circuit of the tractor.|$|R

50|$|To build a {{functionally}} complete logic system, <b>relays,</b> <b>valves</b> (vacuum tubes), or transistors can be used. The simplest {{family of}} logic gates using bipolar transistors is called resistor-transistor logic (RTL). Unlike simple diode logic gates (which {{do not have}} a gain element), RTL gates can be cascaded indefinitely to produce more complex logic functions. RTL gates were used in early integrated circuits. For higher speed and better density, the resistors used in RTL were replaced by diodes resulting in diode-transistor logic (DTL). Transistor-transistor logic (TTL) then supplanted DTL. As integrated circuits became more complex, bipolar transistors were replaced with smaller field-effect transistors (MOSFETs); see PMOS and NMOS. To reduce power consumption still further, most contemporary chip implementations of digital systems now use CMOS logic. CMOS uses complementary (both n-channel and p-channel) MOSFET devices to achieve a high speed with low power dissipation.|$|R

40|$|Air {{brake system}} has been widely used in heavy trucks and {{intercity}} buses for its great superiority over other brake system. The practical performance of air brake system may be greatly different from if we analyze it with static theory. Thus, {{it is necessary to}} build an integrate air brake system model to simulate the process of brake accurately. However, the dynamic mathematic model of air brake system is very complicate, which makes the model hard to be solved. In this paper, the components of air brake system are decomposed to several basic standard pneumatic components, and then build the system based on these basic standard pneumatic components. The standard pneumatic components which are built in the software-MWorks based on Modelica language include cylinder, nozzle, air reservoir, volume, and air pipe.
