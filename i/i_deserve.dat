The interior had paintings of Titus, Hadrian & Marcus Aurelius with these inscriptions beneath each painting: 'Diem perdidi' (I have lost the day), 'Pro me: si merear in me' (For me, but if <b>I</b> <b>deserve</b> it, against me) & 'Ita regnes imperator, ut privatus regi tevelis' (So govern when an emperor, as, if a private person, you would desire to be governed). The building was demolished in 1759.|$|E
500|$|In April 1999, the BBC {{announced}} plans to overhaul its Six O'Clock News bulletin, and that an in-depth sports preview fronted by Rollason would {{be included in the}} programme's Friday edition. She began presenting the slot in May, and made her last onscreen appearance on 18 June. Rollason was awarded an MBE in the 1999 Birthday Honours for her services to broadcasting and charities, and in July 1999 attended a ceremony at Buckingham Palace to be presented with the honour by the Queen. Speaking about the occasion, Rollason said, [...] "I cried when I received the news. I don't feel <b>I</b> <b>deserve</b> it but I'm very thrilled that so many women are coming through in sport broadcasting now." [...] Also in July, she received an honorary degree from the University of Brighton, which was presented to her at her home after she became too ill to attend the ceremony. Shortly before that she was honoured with an award for courage at the 1999 Pride of Britain Awards.|$|E
500|$|On May 18, 2007, the San Francisco Chronicle {{reported}} that Oakland general manager Billy Beane was considering adding Henderson to the roster for one game in September, provided {{it did not}} [...] "infringe on {{the integrity of the}} roster or of the season", so that Henderson could retire as an Oakland A's player. A month later, Henderson appeared to reject the overture, saying, [...] "One day? I don't want one day. I want to play again, man. I don't want nobody's spot... I just want to see if <b>I</b> <b>deserve</b> to be out there. If I don't, just get rid of me, release me. And if I belong, you don't have to pay me but the minimum — and I'll donate every penny of that to some charity. So, how's that hurtin' anybody?... Don't say goodbye for me... When I want that one day they want to give me so bad, I'll let you know." [...] The Athletics retired Henderson's #24 on August 1, 2009.|$|E

500|$|Musically, [...] "What Have You Done for Me Lately" [...] is {{described}} as an uptempo dance song. It begins with a conversation {{with one of her}} friends, who asks Jackson the title question. Lyrically, it involves the singer asking why her lover was not as attentive as he once was. He was not treating her as well as he used to, and she calls him a [...] "loser" [...] in response. [...] "I never ask for more than <b>I</b> <b>deserve,</b> you know it's the truth. You seem to think you're God's gift to this earth. I'm telling you no way", Jackson sings. Veda A. McCoy in the book Lifepower: Six Winning Strategies to a Life of Purpose, Passion & Power expressed that the song reminded that [...] "life is about more than just what you say. Life is also about what you do". Vibe noted that with [...] "What Have You Done for Me Lately", Jackson stands up for men. New York magazine's Chris Smith called the song's chorus [...] "fully belligerent". In a Billboard publication, Nelson George noted its [...] "tauting, tigerish" [...] beat. Ed Gonzalez from Slant Magazine commented, [...] "Nothing sends me into a trembling, corner-cowering stupor than a giggly, under-enunciated Janet Jackson jam." ...|$|E
2500|$|Before {{his first}} parole hearing in 2002, Berkowitz {{sent a letter}} to New York Governor George Pataki asking that it be canceled. He wrote, [...] "In all honesty, I believe that <b>I</b> <b>deserve</b> to be in prison {{for the rest of my}} life. I have, with God's help, long ago come to terms with my {{situation}} and I have accepted my punishment." [...] Officials at the Sullivan facility duly rejected his case.|$|E

Maometto asks for his seal to be returned, but telling him that she gave it to her father and that she has married Calbo, she stabs herself and dies on her mother's tomb.|$|E

2500|$|Backed up by {{a simple}} beat and minimal synth arrangement, Saporta sings about finding the girl he’s been missing: [...] "Girl, I’ve {{been all over the}} world looking for you / I’m known for taking what I think <b>I</b> <b>deserve,</b> and you’re overdue." [...] Sabi, {{provides}} the chorus and the [...] "la-la-la-la-la" [...] melody that carries the song as Saporta sings [...] "You make me feel that…," [...] but never quite finishes the thought. According to Monica Herrera, a writer from Rolling Stone, the song has a riff that suggests Pink's [...] "Raise Your Glass".|$|E

2500|$|Governor Liu, in his embarrassment, {{first tried}} to conceal what had happened. When the emperor became suspicious, he ordered Liu's {{immediate}} recall and demotion. Instead of complying, Liu committed suicide by slicing his throat with a stationery knife, writing as blood was pouring from his neck: [...] "There {{is no way}} to pay back the emperor's favor. <b>I</b> <b>deserve</b> death with my crime". While this kind of suicide in the face of bureaucratic failure apparently was not unusual in Qing China, it reportedly enraged the Emperor nonetheless. Sorting out the Mien (the Chinese word for [...] "Burmese") was now a matter of imperial prestige. The Emperor now appointed Yang Yingju, an experienced frontier officer with long service in Xinjiang and Guangzhou.|$|E

2500|$|On October 22, 2014, CNN Newsroom host Carol Costello {{reported}} on the audio release of Bristol Palin being assaulted by a man at a get-together in Alaska. [...] Costello laughed and called it [...] "quite possibly the best {{minute and a half}} of audio we’ve ever come across." [...] She was instantly criticized for making fun of a woman who was being physically abused by a man she didn't know, as well as for being a hypocrite after recently calling for ESPN to suspend Stephen A. Smith after comments he made about women during the Ray Rice controversy. [...] Costello eventually apologized in a statement to Politico, stating: [...] "Over the past few days, I have been roundly criticized for joking about a brawl involving the Palin family. [...] In retrospect, <b>I</b> <b>deserve</b> such criticism and would like to apologize." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ferguson had emptied two 15-round {{magazines}} {{during the}} shooting. While he was reloading his third magazine, somebody yelled, [...] "Grab him!" [...] Three passengers – Michael O'Connor, Kevin Blum, and Mark McEntee – tackled Ferguson and pinned him {{to one of}} the train's seats. Several other passengers ran forward to grab his arms and legs and help hold him pinned across a three-seat row with his head towards the window and legs towards the aisle. While he was pinned, Ferguson said, [...] "Oh God, what did I do? What did I do? <b>I</b> <b>deserve</b> whatever I get." [...] He also repeatedly pleaded with those holding him, [...] "Don't shoot me. I'm sorry, I'm sorry." [...] Five to six people continued to hold him pinned for some time while they awaited relief. While those who had not tackled him, but were holding him down, inquired as to the location of the gun, they were assured that it had been kicked away and that there had only been one gunman. Most, if not all passengers still in the car were concerned that no further violence take place and that the shooter be held rather than attacked. He was held down for several minutes. Soon, Andrew Roderick, an off-duty Long Island Rail Road police officer who was picking up his wife from the train, boarded the train car and handcuffed Ferguson.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the middle}} of the {{controversy}} about Lindner’s remarks his lawyer sent a routine legal request for discovery to Rep. Neva Walker, an African-American DFL member from Minneapolis. The letter was addressed to her as “Walker-Black”. Walker had never been married, didn’t use a hyphenated name, and had never had the last name Black. It appeared as if someone forgot to remove the race notation before signing and sending out that letter. James Anderson, Lindner's lawyer, apologized to Walker saying it was a [...] "simple mistake. [...] I {{can tell you that the}} person typing the letter apparently looked at the file and put the words together wrong [...]” Walker said [...] "I do believe it was an accident and somebody forgot to erase it. ...I am an elected official and <b>I</b> <b>deserve</b> respect, and that misprint is a lack of respect." [...] The lawyer said [...] "Basically, it's a tempest in a teapot," [...] he said, adding that [...] "some people are just hypersensitive if from a simple mistake they can call someone a racist." [...] Walker responded, [...] "It's easy to say that when you're not on the receiving of a racist comment, but racist attacks are emotionally and mentally draining. And I am far from sensitive. It takes a lot to offend me. ...Folks who are so focused on this issue don't realize that there is a pattern with this particular representative." ...|$|E
