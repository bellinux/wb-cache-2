40|$|This paper reviews {{trends in}} capital flows and capital-like flows such as {{official}} grants and remittances to low-income countries {{over the period}} 1981 - 2006. The survey reveals a broadbased increase in such flows {{as a share of}} low-income country GDP across major regions, countries with differing commodity export composition, and countries with differing debt relief status. The increase in inflows is dominated by an increase in private sector inflows, mostly in the form of private transfers and <b>foreign</b> direct investment. <b>Official</b> <b>sector</b> inflows have remained comparatively constant as a share of low-income country GDP and even declined in the most recent years. The paper concludes with some tentative policy conclusions and has a discussion of data issues in the annexes.

40|$|The Eurozone {{debt crisis}} is {{entering}} its third year. The original {{objective of the}} <b>official</b> <b>sector’s</b> response to the crisis [...] containment [...] has failed. All of the countries of peripheral Europe are now in play; three of them (Greece, Ireland and Portugal) operate under full <b>official</b> <b>sector</b> bailout programs. The prospect of the crisis engulfing the larger peripheral countries, Spain and Italy, has sparked {{a new round of}} <b>official</b> <b>sector</b> containment measures. These will involve active intervention by <b>official</b> <b>sector</b> players such as the European Central Bank in order to preserve market access for the affected countries. This article surveys the options now facing the sovereign debtors and their <b>official</b> <b>sector</b> sponsors. It concludes that there are no painless or riskless options. In the end, the question may come down to this [...] to what extent will the <b>official</b> <b>sector</b> sponsors of peripheral Europe be prepared to take on their own shoulders (and off of the shoulders of private sector lenders) {{a significant portion of the}} debt stocks of these countries during this period of fiscal adjustment...|$|R

5000|$|The anti-bribery {{provisions}} of the FCPA make it unlawful for a U.S. person, and certain foreign issuers of securities, to make a payment to a <b>foreign</b> <b>official</b> {{for the purpose of}} obtaining or retaining business for or with, or directing business to, any person. Since the 1998 Amendment of FCPA they also apply to foreign firms and persons who take any act in furtherance of such a corrupt payment while in the U.S. The meaning of <b>foreign</b> <b>official</b> is broad. For example, an owner of a bank who is also the minister of finance would count as a <b>foreign</b> <b>official</b> according to the U.S. government. Doctors at government-owned or managed hospitals are also considered to be <b>foreign</b> <b>officials</b> under the FCPA, as is anyone working for a government-owned or managed institution or enterprise. Employees of international organizations such as the United Nations are also considered to be <b>foreign</b> <b>officials</b> under the FCPA. A 2014 federal appellate court decision has provided guidance on how the term [...] "foreign official" [...] is defined under FCPA.|$|R

40|$|Recently the United State Supreme Court made a {{decision}} on whether the U. S. Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) should apply to a <b>foreign</b> <b>official.</b> In a U. S court, a civil action was brought by some victims of human rights violations, such as torture and extrajudicial killings in Somalia, commanded by a former Somalian government official who was Defense Minister {{at the time of}} such violations. The <b>foreign</b> <b>official</b> claimed immunity from the jurisdiction of the U. S. courts under the FSIA which grants immunity, with exceptions, to a foreign state including "agency or instrumentality of a foreign state. " He contended that since he was a high-ranking government official, he could be categorized as an "agency or instrumentality of a foreign state," and subsequently, he is immune as a foreign state The Supreme Court rejected his claim, denying the application of the FSIA to the immunity of <b>foreign</b> <b>officials.</b> The Court's main argument is that an "agency or instrumentality" under the FSIA means an "entity" which includes a legal person, not a natural person. Thus, the immunity issue of a <b>foreign</b> <b>official</b> cannot be analyzed by the FSIA, but by the common law such as case laws. This decision is quite meaningful since it clearly sets up the scope of the FSIA by distinguishing immunity for a foreign state from that for <b>foreign</b> <b>officials.</b> With this new decision, the Court abrogated precedents of lower courts which have allowed or discussed immunity of <b>foreign</b> <b>officials</b> under the FSIA. Although this decision left open some important questions, such as whether a former <b>foreign</b> <b>official</b> can be immune if he acted within his official capacity, whether human right violations can be regarded as acts committed within or outside the scope of official capacity, whether such human right violations may be subject to exceptions to immunity, etc., the decision at least primarily may prevent a <b>foreign</b> <b>official</b> from simply raising his immunity defense under the FSIA. Consequently, it is expected that immunity of <b>foreign</b> <b>officials</b> will be scrutinized, by applying the well-recognized common law including international law. This paper takes a glance at the FSIA from its legislative history to rules on immunity for a foreign state to find out whether the FSIA may apply to <b>foreign</b> <b>officials,</b> and then reviews backgrounds and discussions of this case from lower courts to the Supreme Court.

50|$|The {{process of}} {{recognising}} if an entity is {{doing business with}} an individual who {{would be considered a}} <b>foreign</b> <b>official</b> is not only necessary from a compliance perspective, but also necessary when evaluating the risks in a company's business model. This process can be very simple or may be quite complex depending on how many relationships an entity has in place. The process of identifying <b>foreign</b> <b>officials</b> is typically carried out by the comparisons of client or third-party lists with lists of <b>foreign</b> <b>officials</b> that contain the names and positions of such officials, as well as unique identifiers such as dates of birth, photos, and contact numbers.|$|R

40|$|If Greece’s debt is unsustainable, {{and most}} {{observers}} (including the IMF) {{seem to think}} it is, the country’s only source of funding {{will continue to be}} <b>official</b> <b>sector</b> bailout loans. Languishing for a decade or more as a ward of the <b>official</b> <b>sector</b> is undesirable from all perspectives. The Greeks bridle under what they see as foreign imposed austerity; the taxpayers who fund the <b>official</b> <b>sector</b> loans to Greece balk at the prospect of shoveling good money after bad. The question then is how to facilitate Greece’s ability to tap the private capital markets at tolerable interest rates. The IMF’s answer? Write off {{a significant portion of the}} official European loans to Greece or, at the very least, stretch out the grace and repayment periods of those loans until the Crack of Doom. There may be an alternative [...] persuading the <b>official</b> <b>sector</b> voluntarily to subordinate its credits, on a targeted basis, to new borrowings by Greece from the private markets. If the alternatives for the <b>official</b> <b>sector</b> are to lend the money itself (with the risk that the funds may never be recovered), or to write off their existing Greek loans now as a means of rendering the country presentable to the markets, subordination may be a more politically palatable option...|$|R

40|$|It {{is often}} argued that low skilled workers have an {{incentive}} to escape to the unofficial sector, if welfare benefits come too close to the net wage in the <b>official</b> <b>sector.</b> Upper limits of welfare benefits often serve as an instrument to ensure a sufficiently high income differential between sectors. However, if unofficial sector income is insecure, and if a change of sectors is costly, an option value of working in the <b>official</b> <b>sector</b> has to be taken into account. This option value reduces the incentive for low skilled workers to give up <b>official</b> <b>sector</b> jobs. Upper limits of welfare benefits might therefore be defined less restrictively.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{question}} of whether recent international policy initiatives to facilitate financial rescues in emerging market countries have influenced debtors' incentives to access <b>official</b> <b>sector</b> resources is examined. A country's systemic importance is highlighted as a key characteristic that drives access to <b>official</b> <b>sector</b> finance. The effect of these policy initiatives on IMF programme participation is estimated using a pooled probit model. The safety net implied by policy changes to permit exceptional access is shown to have a greater marginal impact on the use of <b>official</b> <b>sector</b> resources, the more systemically important the debtor country is. The paper's results can be interpreted as offering some support for the presence of debtor-country moral hazard. ...|$|R

50|$|As {{a result}} of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission {{investigations}} in the mid-1970s, over 400 U.S. companies admitted making questionable or illegal payments in excess of $300 million to <b>foreign</b> government <b>officials,</b> politicians, and political parties. The abuses ran the gamut from bribery of high <b>foreign</b> <b>officials</b> to secure some type of favorable action by a foreign government to so-called facilitating payments that were made to ensure that government functionaries discharged certain ministerial or clerical duties. If the official {{has no choice but}} to bribe, and bribery is legal in the country, bribing is seen as greasing the wheels. One major example was the Lockheed bribery scandals, in which officials of aerospace company Lockheed paid <b>foreign</b> <b>officials</b> to favor their company's products.
