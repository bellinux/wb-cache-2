Araya's younger brother, Johnny Araya, who was thirteen or fourteen at the time, was a roadie who set up the back line and sound. The band hardly made enough money to sustain themselves, only buying the [...] "essentials" [...] such as food, gas, and beer. Araya asserts, [...] "We basically used whatever money we got to get from point A to point B. When we got back, Brian was like, 'So, where's the money?' And we were like, 'What money?' At that time, we didn't realize that you had to ask for money up front. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> a lot of money sent directly to him, and we were supposed to pick up the rest." ...|$|E
500|$|Some of Landy's {{patients}} included Alice Cooper, Richard Harris, Rod Steiger, and Gig Young, {{who died}} in an apparent murder-suicide {{along with his wife}} in 1978. In a 1976 interview with Rolling Stone, Landy claimed that he had treated others, but that he was in no position to explain his background. He added, [...] "I've treated a tremendous number of people in show business; for some reason I {{seem to be able to}} relate to them. I think I have a nice reputation that says I'm unorthodox by orthodox standards but basically unique by unorthodox standards." [...] Unusually, he had his own press kit. Doctor and former colleague Solon D. Samuels described Landy as [...] "a maverick in the field of psychology. He's done things that no other psychologist has done in treating the psychotic and the drug addict.... What he was doing really was translating the hospital environment to the home environment. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> some remarkable results – with people who can afford it." ...|$|E

He took 'em, and while the storm was on some cattle-thieves, headed by Andy Andrews, came along. Link says Andrews and his gang took the horses away, but I think Link made a deal with the hoss-thieves, for the next day I see Link with a roll of bank-bills, and I know Mr. Merwell didn't give him the money. He had about two hundred dollars, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> the wad from Andrews--on his promise not to open his mouth." ...|$|E

6000|$|We {{were torn}} apart by a {{financial}} accident to my uncle of which I did not at first grasp the full bearings. He had developed what I regarded as an innocent intellectual recreation which he called stock-market meteorology. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> the idea from one use of curves in the graphic presentation of associated variations that he saw me plotting. He secured some of my squared paper and, having cast about for a time, decided to trace {{the rise and fall}} of certain lines and railways. [...] "There's something in this, George," [...] he said, and I little dreamt that among other things that were in it, was the whole of his spare money and most of what my mother had left to him in trust for me.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know whether}} the Arab {{understood}} just what I said, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> the gist of it. He spoke sharp to his men, and they never touched us afterwards. I could not quite make out what they were taking us for, because I can say honestly we were not much good at carrying--not half as good {{as one of the}} slaves. The first day or two we carried a good manful load. Then our shoes went to pieces, and we got that footsore and bad we could scarcely crawl along, let alone carrying loads. Tom said he thought that the Arab was a-taking us to sell as curios to some fellow who had never seen white men before, and it turned out as he was right. After we had been travelling for nigh a month we came to a big village; and there was great excitement over our coming, and for two days there were feastings, while the Arab sold part of his goods to the people for gold dust and ivory.|$|E

When he heard Thelonious Monk, a celebrated pianist and accompanist to bop players Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie and Kenny Clarke, he remarked, [...] "I like it, I like that very much.

I felt such as his problems that they were, short sperm longevity, they could be overcome by careful management of the mares - so we never covered a mare more than once.|$|E
5000|$|He looked {{increasingly}} ill, I mean, we all did, but Jeffrey looked particularly so. His pallor, you know. He {{was physically}} suffering. And {{then he went}} to Japan. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> involved in some kind of relief work ... Helping earthquake victims. This seemed to {{have a positive effect on}} him, you know, spiritually. Then he went back to the states. The phone calls that I got from him there, he seemed really well. Or comparatively well. And happy, you know. And then, I think, Henry Rollins phoned me to tell me that he died.|$|E
5000|$|In 1996, Palmer {{published}} a less-than-flattering {{view of his}} relationship with Earl Weaver, titled 'Together We Were Eleven Foot Nine: The Twenty-Year Friendship of Hall of Fame Pitcher Jim Palmer and Orioles Manager Earl Weaver." [...] In a January 2013 USA Today article, Palmer was quoted as saying, [...] "He wasn't a warm and fuzzy guy, but Earl got us to those World Series... I've seen a lot of Broadway shows in my time, but I never saw a better show than Earl with an umpire. Some people wondered if that was staged. I don't think so. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> lost in the moment." ...|$|E
5000|$|On 6 November 2010, it was {{confirmed}} by Rushden & Diamonds that Nicholls had joined the club's coaching staff. Rushden manager Justin Edinburgh said of him: [...] "He didn't feel his body could train and play anymore... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> <b>got</b> good knowledge and will probably give us a different perspective... the players will learn from him and I feel if I can give someone the opportunity it's {{the right thing to}} do."

He also drew praise from Hall of Fame tackle Dan Dierdorf, [...] "Hedgecock won't ever lead the NFL in rushing but he'll lead block for a lot a yards and he's a gifted recevier with soft hands who runs good routes."

But Craig had no illusions about Pryde's dramatic ability: as an actor he never really existed: {{but the idea of}} acting, the idea of the theatre - or rather the smell of the place, meant a lot to him.

He looks lots hearvier, altho’ he doesn’t weigh much more than he used to. Personally, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> flabby from little or no exercise!

I looked “okay,” but still a “brunch coat” is a “b. c. ” 2 ̆ 6 I felt embarrassed!—So, I just pleaded “headache” 2 ̆ 6 came up here (3 rd floor). I felt terrible to have acted that way; but I couldn’t bear to think those people were probably thinking “well, with him gone, she can look like a slob. ” Honey, I’m always dressed, wear all my jewelry, cologne, etc. 2 ̆ 6 so, I felt twice as bad to be “caught” that way. Spoke to Lt. Embry—any, to us—she’s a good conversationalist, 2 ̆ 6 sounds swell. We’re getting together next week-end. You know, I think I like her already! Well, I moved upstairs “for good” today. I really cleaned the place up 2 ̆ 6 everything is done—I’m proud of it 2 ̆ 6 shall take a “snap” of it first chance I have! Uk rec’d your letter today 2 ̆ 6 will answer it shortly.

5000|$|Shortly after Yale, Sellers and his friend, William Reineke {{purchased}} {{a piece of}} land near Warren, Vermont, known by the name Prickly Mountain, while Peter Gluck embarked on projects elsewhere. From these beginnings a new way of making architecture developed, resulting in structures unmoored from architectural tradition. The three young architects were motivated by the idea that they could control the economics and construction of their buildings, as well as the design. At the time, Sellers was quoted as saying: [...] "The architect is irresponsible today in thinking he has to sit in his office and wait for some client to come up and say, all right build me that. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the architect has got to change his whole scope if he's going to survive {{as an integral part of}} our future society. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> <b>got</b> to play the role of the entrepreneur as well." ...|$|R
