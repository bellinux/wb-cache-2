40|$|The Bachelor's work {{is called}} "Experience of the {{application}} of the Act on Health Insurance". The work describes targets and principles, concept and structure of the new Act on <b>Health</b> <b>Insurance.</b> A separate part deals with <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> benefits, <b>obligations</b> of employers, insured persons and social security authorities. For comparison the work presents the <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> system before the new enforceable <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> legal regulations came into force, i. e. before 31 st December 2008. The aim of the work is to describe experience {{of the application}} of the new Act on <b>Health</b> <b>Insurance,</b> its pros and cons from the perspective of insured persons, employers and employees of social security authorities; {{to find out if the}} reduction of expenses for <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> benefits was achieved and the insured persons are better motivated to reduce their sickness leave. To find out given problems I choose a qualitative research, inquiry method, semi-standardized discussion technique and document analysis method, secondary data analysis technique. Discussions were held with 12 respondents from insured persons, employers and employees of social security authorities. The research shows that after the new Act on <b>Health</b> <b>Insurance</b> took effect the expenses for <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> benefits have decreased and the insured persons have been motivated to decrease their temporary sickness leave. A majority of the respondents is convinced of the increased administrative burden of the new system. Within the performed research were acquired opinions of insured persons, employers and employees of social security authorities which can serve as a topic of a potential discussion about an amendment of the Act on <b>Health</b> <b>Insurance...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{improvements}} in longevity observed {{in many countries}} {{over the past century}} have been significant. The risk that the longevity experience is higher than the one forecasted, i. e. longevity risk, is explicitly consideredin Solvency II standard formula as a sub-module of the life underwriting risk module. The life underwriting risk module includes all the life <b>insurance</b> and reinsurance <b>obligations,</b> except the SLT <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>obligations</b> (EIOPA 2012), where the longevity risk is one of the seven sub-modules. According to Solvency II, solvency capital requirements (from herein SCRs) can be computed by a standard formula or an internal model. Nevertheless, the scenario in which the insurance companies operate is often more complex than that one assumed by the standard formula. According to the standard formula the SCR is represented as the change in net asset value due to longevity shock which is a permanent 20 % reduction of mortality rates for all ages. A constant shock is not reasonable for all ages and maturities. The scenario related to the standard formula may lead to a biased allocation of capital, because of the volatility of longevity phenomenon in respect of different ages. In this paper we examine the adequacy of SCRs {{on the basis of the}} standard formula. To correctly calculate the solvency capital requirement we follow a multi-period approach in the sense that we evaluate at the beginning of each year the amount of capital that the insurer need to meet its future obligations year by year till the contract will be in force. We examine the adequacy of the shocks structure suggested by the standard formula studying its impact on the SCR for longevity risk (SCRLong) and liabilities at different ages...|$|R

40|$|Using matched {{data from}} the 1996 to 2004 Current Population Survey (CPS), we examine racial {{patterns}} in annual transitions {{into and out of}} <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> coverage. We first decompose racial differences in static <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> coverage rates into group differences in transition rates into and out of <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> coverage. The low rate of <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> coverage among African-Americans is due almost entirely to higher annual rates of losing <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> than whites. Among the uninsured, African-Americans have similar rates of gaining <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> in the following year as whites. Estimates from the matched CPS also indicate that the lower rate of <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> coverage among Asians is almost entirely accounted for by a relatively high rate of losing <b>health</b> <b>insurance.</b> In contrast to these findings, differences in <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> coverage between Latinos and whites are due to group differences in both the rate of <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> loss and gain. Using logit regression estimates, we also calculate non-linear decompositions for the racial gaps in <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> loss and gain. We find that two main factors are responsible for differences in <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> loss between working-age whites and minorities: job loss and education level. Higher rates of job loss account for 30 percent of the <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> gap for African-Americans and Asians, and 16 percent of the <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> gap for Latinos. Lower levels of education explain roughly 15 percent of the gap for African-Americans and Latinos (Asians' higher levels of education serve to close the gap). Higher rates of welfare and SSI participation among African-Americans also serve to widen the gap in <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> loss by 8 percent. race, <b>health</b> <b>insurance,</b> insurance dynamics...|$|R

40|$|In my thesis, I {{deal with}} the issue of {{perception}} of <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> companies in the South Bohemian Region. That is, how South Bohemian citizens perceive <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> companies and whether they are satisfied with the services that <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> companies provide. In the theoretical part, I present basic information about public <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> system in the Czech Republic. I mention the history of <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> evolution, its systems, and principles of its operation. I also deal with legislature which is the cornerstone of this system. Most of the laws were passed in the 1990 ?s when the Czech Republic began to develop the current version of <b>health</b> <b>insurance.</b> Since its inception, these laws have been amended several times. Public <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> system in our country is based on the Bismarck model, which is based on the existence of multiple <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> companies and contractual relationships between <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> companies and <b>health</b> care facilities. Furthermore, the theoretical part refers about <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> companies as such, whose activities are governed by Act No. 551 / 1991 Coll., on the General <b>Health</b> <b>Insurance</b> Company, and Act No. 280 / 1992 Coll., on departmental, professional, occupational and other <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> companies. The practical part describes the results of my research focused on the aforementioned issue of perception of <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> companies in the South Bohemian Region. The results have been obtained through quantitative analysis. The method of questioning, the technique of questionnaires, was used. In this research, two of three assumed hypotheses have been confirmed. The research shows that <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> clients in the South Bohemian Region are satisfied with local and time availability of their <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> company subsidiaries. Furthermore, the research carried out shows that citizens respect the opinion of their general practitioners on the selection of their <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> company. In contrast, what good (preventive) programs <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> companies offer is not crucial for citizens when selecting a <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> company. The knowledge gained can form the basis for further research, but it can also serve to <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> companies themselves to improve their services.
