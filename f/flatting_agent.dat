The thermal {{conductivity}} & insulating adhesive was prepared by mixed with diamond particles, epoxy resin (E- 20), methanol etherified amino resin, {{ethylene glycol monobutyl ether}} (BCS), mixed diethyl ester (DBE), and other additives. The influence on rheological behavior of different particle sizes, volume content of diamond particles was studied. Meantime, {{the effect of}} different concentration of dispersant and <b>flatting</b> <b>agent</b> was also investigated. The mechanism of the rheological behavior was analyzed...|$|E
40|$|It is a {{well known}} fact that the {{incorporation}} of so-called flatting agents into clear finishes results in lowered specular gloss readings. This study proposes to explain the effect produced by such agents in producing surface texture with subsequent flatting, and to statistically evaluate the percentage of specular gloss which can be attributed directly {{to the production of}} this surface texture by the agents in question. ^ It was found that 79 % of a given specular gloss reading can be directly attributed to the surface texture or roughness of the finish involved when the silica type flatting agents are used, and that 66 % of the gloss can be explained by surface texture when the stearate type agents are used. This leads to the conclusion that surface roughness is a prime prerequisite of flatting, but that some other factor, peculiar to the <b>flatting</b> <b>agent</b> under test, is also responsible to a lesser degree for the specular gloss reading finally obtained. ^ Other conditions have been investigated and statistically evaluated for these two types of agent, and these include work on ideal conditions for grinding each type of agent, in regard to percentage of agent {{to be used in the}} grind mix, and the effect of aging of flatted lacquers on their flatting ability. ...|$|E
40|$|An {{electrochemical}} {{test system}} of computer programs {{has been written}} that controls electrochemical instrumentation to carry out galvanic current, impedance and corrosion current tests, and processes the data. This test system {{has been applied to}} the study of corrosion mechanisms for painted and unpainted metals. Laboratory simulated atmospheric conditions in a pollution gas box, PGB, shown that mass loss of uncoupled steel increases markedly with increase in [SO 2] up to 1 ppm, but that Zn, Al are relatively unaffected, whereas Zn- 55 %Al alloy shows a modest increase. Sacrificial protection of a steel substrate may therefore be difficult at the higher [SO 2]. However, ACM tests reveal the opposite is true when steel is galvanically coupled to Zn- 55 %Al alloy, which has difficulty providing sacrificial protection at zero and [SO 2], and a mechanism is proposed. Corrosion of Fe, Zn- 55 %Al and Zn in the presence of up to 1 ppm [SO 2] appears to be under mixed control, the first because increases in [SO 2] cause increases in corrosion brought about by depolarization of anodic and cathodic reactions. Random partial short circuits in Zn and Fe ACMs in third and fourth PGB cycles due to electron conducting corrosion products can make interpretation of data difficult. This has been modelled by the inclusion of an interfacial corrosion product resistance, Rcp in the metal/solution equivalent circuit. Several methods are presented {{in order to determine the}} effect of Rcp. Mass losses for Fe, Zn- 55 %Al and Zn have been calculated from ACM galvanic current, impedance, and corrosion current data over the [SO 2] range and compared with weighed mass loss. The impedance test has been applied to study the permeation of chloride ions through paint films (painted Zn- 55 %Al coated steel), the rate of which appears to be rapid for the films tested, and about 50 % complete within several minutes. Solution uptake has been modelled by an equivalent circuit and paint film degradation is shown to occur predominantly at direct or D-type areas where the film resistance follows the resistance of the solution. Comparisons between free and attached film results, both here and below, provide evidence that the high frequency Nyquist semicircle contains paint film information and not metal substrate information. Impedance tests have also been applied to study the effect of paint film <b>flatting</b> <b>agent</b> particles, which was found to be minimal, on solution uptake. Corrosion resistance of the substrate is controlled by the rate of degradation of the paint film, both of which decrease from the moment of sample immersion. Water initially enters the film but after a few hours this rate slows down and paint film degradation, probably resulting from hydrolysis of the silicone modified polyester top coat portion of the paint film, plus ingress of chloride ions, increase so that substrate corrosion also increases. Sample failure time decreases as solution chloride ion concentration increases, in agreement with outdoor exposure results. This is opposite to some other paint films where performance life is controlled by the solution osmotic pressure. Water uptake over the first few days is greater for attached than for free films, thought due to some special influence of the substrate. However, attached films perform better for a number of reasons. The capacitance method for calculating water uptake is more convenient experimentally but not as meaningful as the gravimetric method due to the superimposed effect of paint film degradation occurring after a few hours with these films. A comparison of single frequency and wide frequency range impedance methods indicates that the steeply rising, falling sections of 1 kHz resistive, capacitive/time trends can be simply explained by the rate of decline of paint film resistance...|$|E

30|$|Today, wooden surface layers are {{commonly}} used {{for the protection of}} the furniture and decorative elements produced from wood and other structural elements. Protective liquid surface treatments such as paints and varnishes are often used to extend the esthetic and economic life of wooden material surfaces [15 – 17]. The main purpose of a surface treatment is to protect the surface of wood and give it a good appearance. Varnishes and paints are the most used coating materials and are usually the outermost layer of the treated wood. Coating materials consist of binders, fillers, pigments, <b>flatting</b> <b>agents,</b> solvents, and additives. The main properties of the materials to be used for surface treatment depend greatly on the binder. Binder materials commonly used for the treatment of wood include amino resins, polyurethane, acrylate, polyester, and nitrocellulose. Special properties can be achieved by the use of a combination of these materials [18]. At the present time, role and importance of water-based coatings used to create the protective layer are great. The water-based systems are becoming more broadly used with the passage of time owing to their superior characteristics as being more environmentally friendly (lower volatile organic compound-VOC, lower toxic effect, and lower solvent content, etc.) than solvent-based systems and being less harmful for their user [19]. In addition, these systems have good light and fire resistance [18].|$|R

40|$|Several Mobile Agent based {{distributed}} network management {{models have been}} proposed in recent times to address the scalability and flexibility problems of centralized (SNMP or CMIP management models) models. Though the use of Mobile Agents to distribute and delegate management tasks comes handy {{in dealing with the}} previously stated issues, many of the agent-based management frameworks like initial flat bed models and static mid-level managers employing mobile agents models cannot efficiently meet the demands of current networks which are growing in size and complexity. Moreover, varied technologies, such as SONET, ATM, Ethernet, DWDM etc., present at different layers of the Access, Metro and Core (long haul) sections of the network, have contributed to the complexity in terms of their own framing and protocol structures. Thus, controlling and managing the traffic in these networks is a challenging task. This paper presents an intelligent scalable hierarchical agent based model for the management of large-scale complex networks to address aforesaid issues. The cost estimation, carried out with a view to compute the overall management cost in terms of management data overhead, is being presented. The results obtained thereafter establish the usefulness of the presented architecture as compare to centralized and <b>flat</b> bed <b>agent</b> based models.

40|$|We {{develop and}} test {{experimentally}} a theoretical {{model of the}} role of self-esteem, generated by private feedback regarding relative performance, on the behavior of agents working on an effort provision task for a <b>flat</b> wage. <b>Agents</b> work harder and expect to rank better when they are told they may learn their ranking, relative to cases when they are told feedback will not be provided. Individuals who learn that they have ranked better than expected decrease their output but expect an even better rank in the future, while those who were told they ranked worse than expected increase their output {{and at the same time}} lower their rank expectations going forward. These effects are stronger in earlier rounds of the task, while subjects learn how they compare to their peers. This rank hierarchy is established early on, and remains relatively stable afterwards. Private relative rank information helps create a ratcheting effect in the group’s average output, which is mainly due to the fight for dominance at the top of the hierarchy. Hence, in environments where monetary incentives are weak, moral hazard may be mitigated by providing feedback to agents regarding their relative performance, and by optimally choosing the reference peer group...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine how simple agents similar to Braitenberg {{vehicles}} can exhibit chaotic movement patterns. The agents are wall following robots {{as described by}} Steve Mesburger and Alfred Hubler in their paper "Chaos in Wall Following Robots". These agents uses a simple forward facing distance sensor, with a limited field of view "phi" for navigation. An agent drives forward at a constant velocity and uses the sensor to turn right when it {{is too close to}} an object and left when it is too far away. For a <b>flat</b> wall the <b>agent</b> stays a fixed distance from the wall and travels along it, regardless of the sensor's capabilities. But, if the wall represents a periodic function, the agent drives on a periodic path when the sensor has a narrow field of view. The agent's trajectory transitions to chaos when the sensor's field of view is increased. Numerical experiments were performed with square, triangle, and sawtooth waves for the wall, to find this pattern. The bifurcations of the agents were analyzed, finding both border collision and period doubling bifurcations. Detailed experimental results will be reported separately...|$|R
50|$|Wollastonite has {{industrial}} importance worldwide. It {{is used in}} many industries, {{mostly by}} tile factories which have incorporated it into the manufacturing of ceramic to improve many performance parameters, and {{this is due to}} its fluxing properties, freedom from volatile constituents, whiteness, and acicular particle shape. In ceramics, wollastonite decreases shrinkage and gas evolution during firing, increases green and fired strength, maintains brightness during firing, permits fast firing, and reduces crazing, cracking, and glaze defects. In metallurgical applications, wollastonite serves as a flux for welding, a source for calcium oxide, a slag conditioner, and to protect the surface of molten metal during the continuous casting of steel. As an additive in paint, it improves the durability of the paint film, acts as a pH buffer, improves its resistance to weathering, reduces gloss, reduces pigment consumption, and acts as a <b>flatting</b> and suspending <b>agent.</b> In plastics, wollastonite improves tensile and flexural strength, reduces resin consumption, and improves thermal and dimensional stability at elevated temperatures. Surface treatments are used to improve the adhesion between the wollastonite and the polymers to which it is added. As a substitute for asbestos in floor tiles, friction products, insulating board and panels, paint, plastics, and roofing products, wollastonite is resistant to chemical attack, inert, stable at high temperatures, and improves flexural and tensile strength. In some industries, it is used in different percentages of impurities, such as its use as a fabricator of mineral wool insulation, or as an ornamental building material.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: With {{the recent}} advent of many 1 -step {{adhesive}} systems, clinicians’ preference {{have also been}} shifting to these systems in the clinics, although, these adhesives are being reported to produce lower bond strength compared to 2 - or 3 -step adhesives. Most of the 1 -step adhesives are universal adhesives usable either in a self-etching mode or in a total-etching mode with a prior phosphoric acid etching step. Furthermore, bond strength of total-etch adhesives to moist dentin {{was found to be}} higher than that of dry dentin in a number of studies. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the bond performance of an universal adhesive to dentin in different etching strategies using micro-tensile bond strength (μTBS) to dentin, SEM and TEM. Methods: Two adhesive systems used were, CLEARFIL Universal Bond (CUB) and 2 -step self- etch adhesive CLEARFIL Mega Bond (CMB). K-ETCHANT Syringe (Ech) was used as an etching <b>agent.</b> <b>Flat</b> dentin surfaces of human molars were exposed and polished using # 600 SiC paper under running water. The prepared dentin surfaces were then subdivided into the following four groups: MB (CMB in self-etch mode) - the control, NE (CUB without Ech), ED (CUB applied in dry conditions following Ech) and EW (CUB applied in wet conditions following Ech). After resin composite build-up, each specimen was sectioned after water storage at 37 °C for 24 hours to obtain beams with a bonded area of 1 mm 2. µTBS test was performed at a cross-head speed of 1 mm/min using half of the beams from each group. Rest of the beams was tested after 6 months. The data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance and Tukey’s test. Results: Only ED showed significantly lower µTBS after 6 months compared to its 24 hours counterpart. There was no significant difference between the 4 groups in both 24 hours and 6 months. CUB showed stable adhesion durability regardless of the strategies. Conclusion: CLEARFIL Universal Bond (CUB) showed sufficient dentin bond strength in both self-etch and total-etch strategies. In terms of bond durability, wet bonding to acid-etched dentin may be preferred over bonding to dry acid-etched dentin. 目的：臨床において 1 ステップ接着システムが広く使用されている．その多くはセルフエッチモードでも，リン酸エッチングと併用するトータルエッチモードでも使用できるユニバーサルボンドである．しかし，接着強さは従来型の接着システムと比較すると低いという報告もある．また，脱灰象牙質へのレジンの浸透には処理面を完全に乾燥しないウェットボンディングが有効という報告もある．そこで，象牙質湿潤状態がユニバーサルボンド CLEARFIL Universal Bond（CUB）のトータルエッチモードでの接着性能に与える影響を微小引張り試験，走査電子顕微鏡（SEM）および透過電子顕微鏡（TEM）で検討した． 材料と方法：接着材として CUB，充填材として CLEARFIL AP-X Shade A 3 （AP-X），表面処理材として K-ETCHANT Syringe（Ech），接着材の比較材料として CLEARFIL Mega Bond（CMB）を用いた． 28 本のヒト抜去大臼歯を歯軸に対して歯科技工用トリマーにて 垂直に研削し，象牙質面を露出させ耐水研磨紙# 600 で研磨，水洗したものを被着面とした． 歯面処理は以下 4 条件で行った． 1.
