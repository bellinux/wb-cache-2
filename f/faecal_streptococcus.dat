40|$|Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is a multisystem illness, {{which may}} be {{associated}} with imbalances in gut microbiota. This study builds on recent evidence that sleep may be influenced by gut microbiota, by assessing whether changes to microbiota in a clinical population known to have both poor sleep and high rates of colonization with gram-positive <b>faecal</b> <b>Streptococcus,</b> can improve sleep. Twenty-one CFS participants completed a 22 - day open label trial. Faecal microbiota analysis was performed at baseline {{and at the end of}} the trial. Participants were administered erythromycin 400 mg b. d. for 6 days. Actigraphy and questionnaires were used to monitor sleep, symptoms and mood. Changes in patients who showed a clinically significant change in <b>faecal</b> <b>Streptococcus</b> after treatment (responders; defined as post-therapy distribution&lt; 6 %) were compared to participants who did not respond to treatment. In the seven responders, there was a significant increase in actigraphic total sleep time (p= 0. 028) from baseline to follow up, compared with non-responders. Improved vigour scores were associated with a lower Streptococcus count (ρ=- 0. 90, p= 0. 037). For both the responders and the whole group, poorer mood was associated with higher Lactobacillus. Short term antibiotic treatment appears to be insufficient to effect sustainable changes in the gut ecosystem in most CFS participants. Some improvement in objective sleep parameters and mood were found in participants with reduced levels of gram-positive gut microbiota after antibiotic treatment, which is encouraging. Further study of possible links between gut microorganisms and sleep and mood disturbances is warranted...|$|E

The organoleptic properties including appearance, odour and taste {{were used for}} the physical assessment while flame photometry, atomic absorption spectrophotometer, titration, gravimetry and evaporation to dryness were used to determine the chemical constituents and the serial dilution technique used in determining the total bacterial count, coliform count and <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococcus</b> count. Biochemical tests were carried out to further characterize the organisms isolated. The sanitary conditions on the slaughter slabs and within the abattoir grounds was also assessed to determine the effect on the water quality of the wells used in dressing carcasses and other activities. All the wells sampled were clear and without colour, odour and taste with PH and temperature values ranging between 6. 41 – 6. 75 and 24. 5 oc – 28. 4 oc respectively. The mean values obtained in the samples from groups A, B and C for calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, zinc and copper were all within the WHO, 1971; 1995 recommendations while the iron, (3. 00 mg/L); Lead (0. 09 mg/L); chloride (312. 07 mg/L) and total solid (2100. 00 mg/L) in group A samples exceeded the recommended values of 0. 1 - 1. 00 mg/L; 0. 05 mg/L; 200 mg/L and 500 - 1500 mg/L respectively.

40|$|Thesis (MSc (Environmental Sciences)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. Water {{resources}} in the North West Province are characterised by an overall scarcity due to non–perennial rivers being the dominating water sources. However, increases in water demand from all social, environmental and economic entities {{have resulted in the}} inevitable deterioration of surface waters resulting in increasing threats of faecal and chemical pollution. The quality of 5 surface water systems in the North West Province was assessed by monitoring the physico–chemical properties of the water as well as the levels and diversity of <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci.</b> The Mooi, Harts, Schoonspruit and Vaal Rivers were sampled during one warm–rainy season in 2010 and one cold–dry season in 2011. Dissimilarly, the opposite was employed for Barberspan as it was sampled during one cold–dry season in 2010 and one warm–rainy season in 2011. The average physico–chemical and microbial levels measured at some sites during both seasons were elevated and exceeded the acceptable South African Target Water Quality Range (TWQR) for full and intermediate recreational contact, livestock watering and irrigation. Seasonal variation patterns were observed in both physico–chemical and microbial levels. All surface water systems had relatively lower pH and electrical conductivity levels during the warm–rainy season as compared to the cold–dry season. In addition, water samples collected during the warm–rainy season from the Harts River, Barberspan and Vaal River had higher bacterial levels (total coliforms, faecal coliforms, E. coli and <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci)</b> compared to samples collected during the cold–dry season. The Schoonspruit River had higher bacterial levels during the cold–dry season compared to the warm–rainy season. A total of 80 and 59 presumptive <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci</b> isolates were obtained in 2010 and 2011, respectively. Biochemical tests and 16 S rRNA gene sequencing were used to identify all <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci</b> isolates. A total of 6 <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci</b> species were identified and these included: Enterococcus faecium, E. faecalis, E. mundtii, E. casseliflavus, E. gallinarum and E hirae. Haemolysis and antibiotic resistant iii patterns were used for the characterisation of all <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci</b> isolates. Of the 80 and 59 <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci</b> isolates obtained, 32. 5 % and 6. 8 % displayed ?–haemolysis. Furthermore, dominant multiple antibiotic resistance patterns were observed for <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci</b> isolates at most sites in both years. <b>Faecal</b> <b>streptococci</b> isolates obtained in 2010 were resistant to Penicillin G (10 ?g), Neomycin (30 ?g) and Vancomycin (30 ?g) and susceptible to Amoxicillin (10 ?g) and Streptomycin (300 ?g). Isolates obtained in 2011 were also resistant to Penicillin G (10 ?g) and Neomycin (30 ?g) but also to Amoxicillin (10 ?g) and Ciprofloxacin (5 ?g). Furthermore, the 2011 isolates were susceptible to Chloramphenicol (30 ?g) and Trimethoprim (2. 5 ?g). The physico–chemical and microbial levels measured at several sites exceeded acceptable limits and proved unsuitable for applications such as full and intermediate recreational activities, livestock watering as well as irrigation. In addition, it appears that the physico–chemical and microbial levels were influenced by the season of collection. The multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) phenotype data of <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci</b> isolates obtained for the different sites suggests that their exposure history to several antibiotics was similar. This is most probably due to a uniform pollution pattern along the system. The presence and isolation of <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci,</b> particularly those capable of causing ?–haemolysis, in surface water systems used for livestock watering and cultural activities is an important health care concern. The significance is outlined when the serious nature of the diseases and infections that could be caused by some of the pathogens (E. faecalis and E. faecium) isolated in this study as well as their emerging antimicrobial resistances is considered.

Diarrhoea prevalence rate for the children in Dhaka slums is 214. 29. The total costs of children’s diarrhoea (adding all the direct and indirect) in Dhaka slums is Tk. 133. 88 over a 15 day time interval. The water quality is measured at the point-of-use and the point-of-source by the total coliform, faecal coliform, and <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci</b> tests per 100 ml water.

40|$|Thesis (M. Dip.) [...] Cape Technikon, 1990 The die-off in {{the marine}} {{environment}} of micro-organisms that are present in sewage was investigated. A literature survey was carried out and studies were done in the laboratory, at an offshore outfall and at a surf-zone outfall. In the laboratory raw sewage was mixed with sea water at known dilutions and the die-off of <b>faecal</b> coliforms, <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci</b> and coliphage was monitored. At the offshore sewage outfall a tracer, Rhodamine B. was released in the pump station {{and the distribution of}} the plume around the diffuser was determined by means of the Rhodamine B concentrations and faecal colifonns counts. At the factory surf-zone outlet the Rhodamine B was injected into the pipeline. Samples were taken at 50 and 100 meter distance from the outlet. Thedie-off of <b>faecal</b> colifonns, <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci</b> and coliphage was monitored. The following results were obtained: Literature study: (i) Coliforms • Temperatures of 15 QC and lower are conducive to survival while nutrients, at a concentration as low as 2, 5 mg/L organic carbon, stimulate growth. A rise in salinity has a negative effect on the organisms. • The T 90 value in direct sunlight is 35 days). Changes in weather• conditions, sunlight intensity, hours of sunlight, depth and turbidity of seawater and different seasons are the most important factors accounting for the variations in the T 90 values. • It is, therefore, important for the initial dilution to be large enough. This will ensure that the bacterial counts conform to the water quality criteria, as the die-off rates {{in the marine}} environment are slow and not always adequate, except around mid day. • Faecal coliforms as a single parameter is not considered to be the best indicator of marine pollution. • The 1 : 4 ratio between faecal coliforms and <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci</b> for human faeces and 1 : 0, 7 ratio for animal waste are not applicable in the marine environment. The survival of <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci</b> in seawater is better than that of faecal coliforms and the ratio therefore changes. (ii) Enterococci and pathogens • The T 90 value for <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci</b> is double that of coliforms and also varies in the dark. In direct sunlight any change in sunlight intensity, change the T 90 values. • In general the numbers of <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci</b> and pathogens occuring in sewage are smaller than those of coliforms, but their survival time is longer. This could lead to a situation where the water quality complies with the criteria according to the coliform counts, while a health risk may exist due to th survival of pathogens...|$|R

40|$|Infection with a <b>faecal</b> <b>Streptococcus</b> species {{belonging}} to Lancefield group D {{has been a}} major cause of mortalities on certain trout farms on the escarpment of the Mpumalanga Province in the Republic of South Africa. Evidence is given of a connection between subclinical gas bubble disease and infection with this organism in rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss. The condition causes serious losses during the summer months when water temperatures rise above 18 °C. The larger table-size fish are affected first and present with exophthalmos before developing signs of a typical bacterial septicaemia. The design of the water supply to the fish ponds on these farms allowed supersaturation of the water with atmospheric gas. Vortex formation at water extraction points appears to have been the main cause of air entrainment into the water supply leading to the ponds. By correcting the faults responsible for the development of hyperbaric gas pressure in the water, it was possible to control this disease on two badly affected farms. The overlapping similarities in the clinical signs and pathology of gas bubble disease and that seen in fish suffering from Streptococcus D infection are discussed, as well as the diagnostically significant changes in the gill tissues that are specific to subclinical exposure to gas supersaturation in the water. An explanation is given for the increased susceptibility to infection with this organism. The articles have been scanned with a HP Scanjet 8300; 600 dpi, saved in TIFF format.

The description of a microbiological community of drinking water distribution systems is intended for a safe and proper use of drinking water. These studies were aimed at characterising the microbial condition of the drinking water supply system in Lithuania by means of culture-based methods and biochemical techniques. Samples of drinking water (in cities supplied in centralised way from taps, wells, and boreholes) were collected in different locations in Lithuania. Seeking to grow microflora present in water the membrane filtration method was applied to study the samples. Most often water samples were studied to identify coliform bacteria (Citrobacter spp., En-terobacter spp., Klebsiella spp., Serratia spp.), Escherichia coli (or faecal coliform), Enterococci (or fecal Strepto-coccus), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (other non-fermentative gram-negative bacteria) according to the international ISO standards. Large amounts of non-fermenting gram-negative bacteria were found in centralised urban water. The investigation showed that more than 50 % of the wells under study had increased microbial contamination with faecal coliform bacteria and <b>faecal</b> <b>Streptococcus.</b> Bacteria of the Pseudomonas group, CDC group and oth-er non-fermentative gram-negative bacteria were detected in more than 30 % samples of centralised urban water studied...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to investigate the}} microbiological composition of urban surface water runoff and sediments in both North London and Valencia. The survey focused primarily on the relationships between indicator microorganisms (total coliforms, faecal coliforms and faecal streptococci) and water quality, and between indicator microorganisms and pathogens (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella) which cause waterborne disease. High levels of microorganisms were found in dry weather flow sanitary wastewater, combined sewage, urban receiving stream, beach outfall and storm water runoff as well as sediments. Pathogenic bacteria were consistently isolated from the urban water courses. Pseudomonas aeruginosa were recovered at high concentration and Salmonella required concentration for enumeration. The results indicated that storm water runoff from urban areas contain high levels of indicator microorganisms and pathogenic bacteria. The pollution appears to be predominantly of non-human origin and is mainly derived from animal wastes. In general, the runoff resembled dilute raw sewage in microbiological composition and obversely represents a public health risk. Although some connection between bacteria densities and selected environmental factors is apparent, the relationship is not simple. Factors such as BOD₅, flow, temperature, pH, faecal deposit age and hydrologic proximity of pollution sources all affect bacterial densities in runoff and according to different water sources. However, the parameter of bacterial loading {{may be used in}} survey of aquatic environment to estimate probable bacteria density ranges. The characteristics of bacterial concentration in different layers of sediments and bacterial release from sediment in a continuous flow tank have also been investigated. Indicator and pathogenic bacteria occur at the highest concentration in the upper layers of sediment. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was more easy released than indicator microorganisms. The microbial release peak was detected at 6 hours. The ratio of faecal coliform to <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococcus</b> densities can be used to help identify particular sources of faecal pollution and had relatively small fluctuation rate after faeces deposited in water under 4 °C than 20 °C...|$|E
40|$|Increasing water {{shortage}} hast to be anticipated worldwide. Therefore since {{many years now}} so called "Alternative Sanitation Systems", which bases on {{the aims of the}} recycling management, are examined. Main features of these approaches are the separation of domestic waste water flows according to their characteristics into the grey water, the brown water or the yellow water fraction. Thus, the partial flows can be treated appropriately and the reuse of nutrients contained in the partial flows (e. g. nitrogen, phosphors or potassium) and the water itself is possible. In consideration with these aspects, within the research project KOMPLETT (2005 - 2009) purification schemes for separated grey and black water (brown and yellow water) were carried out and tested at different scales. Besides biological treatment using membrane bioreactor technology (MBR) the developed process comprises components for physical-chemical degradation and removal of organic compounds, disinfection and elimination of trace elements. The results of the investigations show, that the developed process scheme produces very high effluent qualities for purified grey and black water. In particular for grey water the produced water quality meets highest requirements for utilization, e. g. drinking water standards. Within the blackwater process the purified water can be reused for toilet flushing without any restriction. Relevant hygienic-microbiological organisms, as well as organic compounds were eliminated certainly in the black water treatment process. E. g. E. coli and <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococcus</b> were not detectable in 100 mL after the MBR. Hence, with the selected process technology domestic water cycle for separated grey and blackwater can be closed. The KOMPLETT water recycling technology is designed as a decentralized system. Therefore stable system operation is of highest importance. In particular as the purification scheme bases on biological treatment process. Therefore a special feature of the project was the development and integration of new and innovative sanitary products, involving antimicrobial surfaces and water saving flushing toilets (3. 5 L per flush) in order to reduce impacts of detergents and disinfectants on the biological treatment. Within the project antimicrobial surfaces based on silver ions as well as self-purifying surfaces using the photo-catalytic effect of titanium dioxide (TiO 2) were developed and tested in laboratory {{as well as in the}} final pilot phase. There the treatment technology and sanitary products were coupled and water cycles were closed. Furthermore in this part of the project the consumers' acceptance among the new sanitary products using nanotechnology was ascertained. It could be shown, that the examined sliver-doped and photo-catalytic surfaces can inhibit or rather minimize microbiological growth. In comparison to the undoped surfaces a reduction of > 1 to 3 log 10 levels according to the selected test organisms E. coli and S. aureus were detected. Accordingly, contaminations of black water by microorganisms could be reduced significantly at source. As a consequence the application of disinfectant and detergents could be minimized. Therefore, influences on biological treatment process through detergents used for toilet cleaning are reduced to a necessary minimum and no operational problems encountered throughout the study...|$|E

The latest has {{significant effect on}} Total Bacterial Count (TBC), Total and Fecal Coliforms (TC and CT) and reduction time (P< 0. 001). The effect is highly significant for TBC, <b>faecal</b> <b>Streptococci</b> (P< 0. 01) and significant only for Yeasts (P< 0. 05). No effect was observed for other microbiological variables. The variability of the chemical composition is significant for density and protein (P< 0. 05), highly for pH, Dornic acidity, freezing point and solids-non-fat (P< 0. 01). Lactose, fat and total solids are independent. The semi-arid zone contains milks with a high density, weak freezing point and less loaded on TBC, TC, FC and Moulds. They are rich in protein, fat and total solids. They differ from those other zones by the highest frequency of <b>faecal</b> <b>Streptococci</b> and absence of Staphylococcus aureus.

40|$|Intertidal {{sediment}} {{samples from}} three EU recognised bathing waters in Morecambe Bay, Lancashire, U. K. (Morecambe North, Morecambe South and Heysham) were analysed for thermophilic campylobacters, salmonellae, faecal coliforms and <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci</b> over a 12 -month period. Campylobacters show a strong seasonality. They are generally absent {{in the summer}} months but are consistently present in the winter. The main Campylobacter species isolated were C. lari and urease-positive thermophilic campylobacters (UPTC), {{both of which are}} associated with avian hosts. C. jejuni and C. coli and Salmonella were not isolated from the sediments. Faecal coliforms and <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci</b> were isolated throughout the year with no obvious seasonal trends in their numbers. Higher numbers were found at Morecambe North and South than at Heysham. There was no discernible relationship between the numbers of campylobacters and faecal indicators. Faecal indicators were found predominantly in the surface layers of the sediments and declined in number with depth. Campylobacters were restricted to the surface layer. Experimental results for the in situ deposition of bacteria onto clean, sterile surfaces from the water column during tidal cover showed deposition rates equivalent to approximately 0. 1 % of the total population of faecal coliforms, 0. 01 % of the <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci</b> and 1 % of the campylobacters in the sediments. These rates of accretion were not high enough to be detected during routine sampling carried out before and after high water, using standard methods. The results show that the sediments act as a reservoir for bacteria, especially the faecal indicators. In rough weather resuspension can contribute significantly to bacterial numbers in the surface waters...|$|R

Portugal does {{not comply with}} a series of drinking water parameters (iron, manganese, total coliforms, <b>faecal</b> coliforms, <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci</b> and clostridium) laid down in the EU drinking water directive. For example, almost 50% of water supply zones do not comply as regards total coliforms, while 20% of the zones do not comply with the faecal coliforms parameter.|$|R
30|$|Similar to our results, high {{efficiencies}} of coliform elimination {{have reported}} by some authors. Pereira-Neto et al. (1986) have studied pathogen inactivation in four compost piles, employing the aerated static pile system. They have evaluated pathogen inactivation {{by means of}} the commonly used indicator organisms. E. coli and <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci</b> reduced from approximately 107  org/g ww to less than 102 org/g ww with a removal percentage of 100 similar to our results. Similarly, during open-air windrow composting of beef feedlot manure, Larney et al. (2003) have reported that more than 99.9  % of total coliform and E. coli was eliminated in the first 7  days. In the study of Banegas et al. (2007), during the composting process, Salmonella, faecal coliforms (E. coli), and <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci</b> were determined in samples taken after 1, 30, 60 and 90  days of composting. Similar to our results, they have reported that at the high temperatures (between 57 and 61  °C) reached during composting most pathogens were destroyed, making resulting composts safer for agricultural use.|$|R
40|$|Background: Urban {{water sources}} of Khamis Mushait Governorate, southwestern Saudi Arabia, were studied {{to assess their}} {{bacteriological}} characteristics and suitability for potable purposes. A cross-sectional epidemiological method was adopted to investigate the four main urban water sources (i. e. bottled, desalinated, surface, and well water). These were sampled and examined between February and June 2007. Results: A total of 95 water samples from bottled, desalinated, surface, and well water were collected randomly from the study area using different gathering and analysing techniques. The bacteriological examination of water samples included the most probable number of presumptive coliforms, faecal coliforms, and <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci</b> (MPN/ 100 ml). The {{results showed that the}} total coliform count (MPN/ 100 ml) was not detected in any samples taken from bottled water, while it was detected in those taken from desalinated, surface, and well water: percentages were 12. 9, 80. 0, and 100. 0, respectively. Faecal coliforms were detected in desalinated, surface, and well water, with percentages of 3. 23, 60. 0 and 87. 88, respectively. About 6. 45 % of desalinated water, 53. 33 % of surface water, and 57. 58 % of well water was found positive for <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci.</b> Colonies o...|$|R

The antimicrobial effectiveness of TTO is determined in terms of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) or minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC). The isolates include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), S. aureus, <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci,</b> BETA-haemolytic streptococci, coagulasenegative staphylococci, Pseudomonas spp. and coliform bacilli. Eleven Candida spp. isolates from skin and vaginal swabs also are tested. Using an agar dilution assay, the MICs of TTO in 88 out of 90 isolates was 0. 5 - 1. 0 % (v/v), whilst with P. aeruginosa it was > 2 % (v/v). A broth microdilution method {{was used to determine}} MIC and minimum cidal concentration (MCC) of 80 isolates. In 64 isolates, TTO produced an inhibitory and cidal effect at 3 % and 4 % (v/v), respectively. S. aureus and Candida spp. were the most susceptible to TTO, with MICs and MBCs of 0. 5 % and 1 %, respectively. P. aeruginosa and the <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci</b> isolates, with MICs and MBCs of > 8 %, were resistant to TT...|$|R
40|$|Three {{different}} set of experiments were conducted using normal seawater, filtered seawater and re-circulatory system {{for the improvement of}} meat quality of the green mussel Perna viridis) in terms of bacterial quality and biochemical composition. Total plate count, <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci</b> count, and conforms were examined to analyse the bacterial load of mussel and the surrounding water. The most significant bacterial reduction was obtained in the re-circulatory system followed by filtered seawater. Coliforms and <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci</b> were able to completely eliminated from the mussels through these treatments. The experimental mussels were fed ad libitum with cultured micro algae during the experimental period. The nutritional quality of mussel meat studied in terms of biochemical components showed clear significant difference between control and experiment. The condition index, dry meat weight, protein and carbohydrate percentage of the mussel meat was found to increase significantly at the end of all the experiments. The studies showed that the meat quality of the mussels harvested from nature could be improved in terms of bacterial reduction {{and at the same time}} increasing the nutritional quality through these types of short-term treatment in captivity by providing feed and quality seawater...|$|R

40|$|Bacterial {{contaminants}} of Vhuswa__a traditional maize-based weaning food, {{and domestic}} drinking-water stored in impoverished rural households in Venda of Limpopo province, South Africa, were determined. One hundred and twenty-five samples of Vhuswa fed to children aged {{less than five}} years were assessed for Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella, and Shigella. The microbiolo-gical quality of 125 drinking-water samples was also evaluated using total coliforms, faecal coliforms, and <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci</b> as indicators. The frequency of isolation of E. coli, Salmonella, Shigella, and C. jejuni from the Vhuswa samples was 70 %, 5 %, 5 %, and 2 % respectively. The geometric mean counts of total coliforms, faecal coliforms, and <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci</b> in tap-water stored in household containers ranged from 4. 9 x 102 to 5. 8 x 103 cfu 100 mL- 1, 2. 6 x 102 to 3. 7 x 103 cfu 100 mL- 1, and 3. 1 x 103 to 5. 8 x 103 cfu 100 mL- 1 respectively, and for stored spring water it was 5. 1 x 103 cfu 100 mL- 1, 3. 2 x 103 cfu 100 mL- 1, and 5. 1 x 103 cfu 100 mL- 1 respectively.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effect of seasonal variation on the physical, chemical and biological properties of groundwater around Karu abattoir. Water samples were collected from different wells at different distances around the abattoir comprising Group A (within abattoir), Group B (60 m from abattoir) and Group C (200 - 300 m from abattoir) for wet and dry seasons. Parameters analysed are temperature, turbidity, TDS, TSS, pH, DO, BOD, total hardness, conductivity, iron content, nitrate, sulphate, E. coli and <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci.</b> Result of the analyses showed that all the parameters have higher concentration during the wet season than in the dry season in all the Groups, except for BOD, sulphate and iron. Paired sample t-test results revealed that parameters such as TDS, conductivity, DO, nitrate, sulphate and iron have no significant variation in all the Groups. Most of the parameters have their mean values within the WHO standards in both seasons; however mean values for TSS, E. coli and <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci</b> are higher than the guideline provisions, while DO {{does not meet the}} recommended values in both seasons; and BOD values are higher than WHO standard.

40|$|Classical {{bacterial}} {{indicators and}} organic matter contents were analyzed for sediment samples and the suspended particles {{collected from the}} sewage waste of Islamabad city. The suspended particles were most affected by proximity of point source and sewage overflows, which were associated with significant increases in the concentration of <b>faecal</b> coliforms, <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci</b> and Clostridium perfringens spores. In contrast, only faecal coliform counts significantly increased in sediments with increasing distance from the point source. Sewage overflow again resulted in increased concentrations of <b>faecal</b> coliforms, <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci</b> and Clostridium perfringens spores in suspended particulate matter. Faecal coliforms were identified as the most useful indicator of faecal pollution as only this indicator correlated significantly to the organic matter contents (r = 0. 88, r s = 0. 93) for sediment samples. The amount of organic matter in suspended particulate matter was not significantly different but a gradual increase in the organic matter with an average value of 2 to 3 % was detected in the sediment samples with increasing distance from the point source. Our findings indicate {{a high level of}} faecal pollution in Nullah Leh, particularly coliforms, in amounts several magnitudes higher than the standards permit.

40|$|This study {{deals with}} the {{examination}} of quality of seawater bathing areas in Greece over a 10 -year period and identifies risk factors for high bacteria indicator organism concentrations. Qualitative descriptive analysis was applied and the microbiological test results of 231, 205 water samples were associated with pollution markers and other parameters. Measurements of Escherichia coli (99. 6 %) and enterococci (100 %) {{were found to be}} in accordance with the mandatory value guidelines set by the new European Directive. An increasing trend for the yearly mean value of <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci</b> was noted. Using logistic regression analysis, phenolic smell (OR 2. 10, CI 2. 04 - 2. 16), rainfall the day before sampling (OR 1. 67, CI = 1. 64 - 1. 74), high seas (OR = 1. 42, CI 1. 39 - 1. 46) and rainfall on the day of sampling (OR = 1. 27, CI = 1. 20 - 1. 33) were positively independently associated with high levels of bacterial indicators (total coliforms, <b>faecal</b> coliforms, <b>faecal</b> <b>streptococci</b> and E. coli). The highest risk, absolute risk value 42. 8 % (RR = 3. 17, CI 2. 97 - 3. 38), was measured when previous day rainfall, phenolic smell and high seas were simultaneously recorded.
