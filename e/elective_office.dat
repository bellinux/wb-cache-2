5|$|Chief Justice Melville Fuller {{delivered}} {{the opinion of}} the court on May 21, 1900. This opinion held that there were no federal issues in question in the case, and that the court lacked jurisdiction. The opinion affirmed the state court of appeals' assertion that an <b>elective</b> <b>office</b> was not property. Justices Gray, White, Shiras, and Peckham concurred with the majority opinion.|$|E
5|$|Harding {{wished to}} try again for <b>elective</b> <b>office.</b> Though a {{longtime}} admirer of Foraker (by then a U.S. senator), he had been careful to maintain {{good relations with the}} party faction led by the state's other U.S. senator, Mark Hanna, McKinley's political manager and chairman of the Republican National Committee (RNC). Both Foraker and Hanna supported Harding for state Senate in 1899; he gained the Republican nomination and was easily elected to a two-year term.|$|E
5|$|On April 6, 1900, the Court of Appeals upheld Judge Field's {{decision}} {{by a vote}} of 6–1. The majority opinion held that an elected office is not property and thus not subject to the protections guaranteed in the Fourteenth Amendment. As a creation of the Kentucky Constitution, the court held, any <b>elective</b> <b>office</b> is conferred and held only subject to the provisions of that constitution. This put the matter beyond the reach of any judicial review, according to the court.|$|E

5|$|Claiming the General Assembly's {{decision}} was invalid, Taylor sued to prevent Beckham from exercising {{the authority of}} the governor's office. Beckham countersued Taylor for possession of the state capitol and governor's mansion. The suits were consolidated and heard in Jefferson County circuit court, which claimed it had no authority to interfere with the method of deciding contested elections prescribed by the state constitution, an outcome that favored Beckham. The Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld the circuit court's decision on appeal and rejected Taylor's claim that he had been deprived of property without due process by stating that an <b>elective</b> <b>office</b> was not property and thus not protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.|$|E
5|$|John C. Lodge was {{a member}} of the {{constitutional}} convention which drafted the Michigan Constitution of 1908, a former member of the Michigan Legislature and Detroit alderman and councilman. He later served as Mayor of Detroit in 1918–1919 before returned to the City Common Council from 1932 to 1947. He was then elected to the Wayne County Board of Supervisors from 1948 until 1950. In total, he held <b>elective</b> <b>office</b> longer than anyone in city history. He died on February 6, 1950, and the future Lodge Freeway was named in his honor on January 20, 1953. The entire freeway, including segments previously named for James Couzens and the Northwestern Highway was named the John C. Lodge Freeway in 1987, although the service drives retained their original names.|$|E
5|$|Mallory {{resigned}} {{after the}} Confederate government had fled from Richmond {{at the end}} of the war, and he and several of his colleagues in the cabinet were imprisoned and charged with treason. After more than a year in prison, the public mood had softened, and he was granted parole by President Andrew Johnson. He returned to Florida, where he supported his family in his final years by again practicing law. Unable to hold <b>elective</b> <b>office</b> by the terms of his parole, he continued to make his opinions known by writing letters to newspapers. His health began to deteriorate, although he was not incapacitated until the very end. He died on November 9, 1873.|$|E

5|$|Although Jinnah {{initially}} opposed separate electorates for Muslims, he {{used this}} means to gain his first <b>elective</b> <b>office</b> in 1909, as Bombay's Muslim representative on the Imperial Legislative Council. He was a compromise candidate when two older, better-known Muslims who were seeking the post deadlocked. The council, {{which had been}} expanded to 60 members as part of reforms enacted by Minto, recommended legislation to the Viceroy. Only officials could vote in the council; non-official members, such as Jinnah, had no vote. Throughout his legal career, Jinnah practised probate law (with many clients from India's nobility), and in 1911 introduced the Wakf Validation Act to place Muslim religious trusts on a sound legal footing under British Indian law. Two years later, the measure passed, the first act sponsored by non-officials to pass the council and be enacted by the Viceroy. Jinnah was also appointed to a committee which helped to establish the Indian Military Academy in Dehra Dun.|$|E
5|$|Collins {{followed}} up her {{success in the}} 1985 special session with a push for more higher education funding in the 1986 legislative session. Lawmakers obliged by approving an additional $100million for {{higher education in the}} biennial budget. They also approved implementation of a pilot preschool program and the purchase of new reading textbooks, but failed to act on Collins' request for an additional $3.9million to improve the state's vocational education system. Legislators approved calling a referendum on a constitutional amendment– supported by Collins– to make the state superintendent of education an appointive, rather than <b>elective,</b> <b>office.</b> The amendment was defeated by the state's voters in November 1986, despite a Collins-led campaign in favor of it. The increased corporate tax intended {{to cover the cost of}} the increased education budget was, however, inadequate. In 1987, a plan to increase revenue through changes in the state income tax was abandoned when Wallace Wilkinson, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee who would go on to succeed Collins, announced his opposition to it.|$|E
5|$|Returning to California, Solis became Director of the California Student Opportunity and Access Program in 1982, to help {{disadvantaged}} youth gain necessary {{preparation for}} college. In particular, {{she worked with}} the Whittier Union High School District. Friends urged her to try for <b>elective</b> <b>office,</b> and so in 1985, she ran for the Board of Trustees of the Rio Hondo Community College District. She campaigned hard and overtook an incumbent and one other better established candidate to become the top placer. She was reelected in 1989. During her time on the board, she worked towards improved vocational job training at the college and sought {{to increase the number}} of tenured faculty positions held by minorities and women. She joined several California chambers of commerce, women's organizations, and Latino organizations. She gained added political visibility in 1991 when she was named to the Los Angeles County Commission on Insurance by Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria Molina, a political mentor. Solis also served as chief of staff for State Senator Art Torres.|$|E

5|$|The Greenbackers {{nominated}} Weaver {{for president}} in 1880, but he received only 3.3 {{percent of the popular}} vote. After several more attempts at elected office, he was again elected to the House in 1884 and 1886. In Congress, he worked for expansion of the money supply and for the opening of Indian Territory to white settlement. As the Greenback Party fell apart, a new anti-big business third party, the People's Party ("Populists"), arose. Weaver helped to organize the party and was their nominee {{for president in}} 1892. This time he was more successful and gained 8.5 {{percent of the popular vote}} and won five states, but still fell far short of victory. The Populists merged with the Democrats by the end of the 19th century, and Weaver went with them, promoting the candidacy of William Jennings Bryan for president in 1896, 1900, and 1908. After serving as mayor of his home town, Colfax, Iowa, Weaver retired from his pursuit of <b>elective</b> <b>office.</b> He died in Iowa in 1912. Most of Weaver's political goals remained unfulfilled at his death, but many came to pass in the following decades.|$|E

25|$|To hold an <b>elective</b> <b>office,</b> {{one had to}} be of {{a family}} that had {{previously}} held office.
