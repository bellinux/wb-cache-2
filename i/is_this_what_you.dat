25|$|The {{recording}} {{sessions for}} <b>Is</b> <b>This</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Want? began in London in June 1968. The {{majority of the}} songs were recorded in Los Angeles in October–November that year, after Harrison had completed work on the Beatles' White Album. Among the other guest musicians on the album {{were members of the}} Wrecking Crew, Eric Clapton, Nicky Hopkins, Klaus Voormann and John Barham. Although the album received favourable reviews, it failed to achieve commercial success. The 2010 reissue includes bonus tracks covering the rest of Lomax's output while on Apple Records.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, Apple reissued <b>Is</b> <b>This</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Want? as both an {{individual}} release {{and as part}} of the seventeen-disc box set titled The Apple Box. [...] "Sour Milk Sea" [...] also appeared on the accompanying two-CD compilation, [...] In conjunction with these releases, a mono mix of the song was made available for digital download.|$|E
500|$|Mixing on [...] "Savoy Truffle" [...] {{was also}} {{completed}} on 14 October, after which Harrison left for Los Angeles to produce Jackie Lomax's album <b>Is</b> <b>This</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Want? The stereo and mono mixes {{of the song}} differ in their editing of the lead guitar parts; in addition, the mono version omits the organ over the third verse.|$|E

500|$|Harrison wrote [...] "Sour Milk Sea" [...] {{to promote}} Transcendental Meditation, which the Beatles had been {{studying}} in Rishikesh with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. The group recorded a demo of the song while considering material for their 1968 double album, The Beatles (also known as the White Album). On release, Lomax's single was overshadowed in Apple's [...] "Our First Four" [...] promotional campaign by the Beatles' [...] "Hey Jude" [...] and Mary Hopkin's [...] "Those Were the Days"; it enjoyed only minor success internationally, becoming a top 30 hit in Canada. Together with its B-side, the Lomax-written [...] "The Eagle Laughs at You", the song was included on the singer's only Apple album, <b>Is</b> <b>This</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Want?, released in March 1969.|$|E
500|$|... "Butterflies" [...] was {{recorded}} by Michael Jackson in 2001 for his tenth studio album, Invincible, which was released the same year. The song {{was written by}} Andre Harris and Marsha Ambrosius, who is {{one half of the}} London bred neo-soul act Floetry, and was produced by Jackson and Harris. Jackson first met Ambrosius and Natalie Stewart, who {{is also a member of}} Floetry, through John McClain, who is DreamWorks's senior urban executive and Jackson's manager. Stewart said she was surprised that Jackson invited her and Ambrosius to a studio and asked for their input on the recording of the track. She recalled in an interview with LAUNCH magazine, [...] "It was incredible because he asked, he continually asked, 'Marsh, what's the next harmony? Girls, does this sound right? What do you think? <b>Is</b> <b>this</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> were looking for? He was so open".|$|E
500|$|During the 2010 {{shows of}} the tour, the {{performance}} of [...] "Monster" [...] was changed a little to include an ending, where Gaga is portrayed as getting killed by a murderer, after which she lies [...] "dying" [...] {{in a pool of}} blood. Her performances of that scene in Manchester, England, triggered protests from family groups and fans {{in the aftermath of the}} Cumbria shootings, in which 12 people were murdered by a taxi driver. [...] "What happened in Bradford is very fresh in people's minds and given all the violence which happened in Cumbria just hours earlier, it was insensitive," [...] said Lynn Costello of Mothers Against Violence. Chris Rock later defended her flamboyant, provocative behavior. [...] "Well, she's Lady Gaga," [...] he said. [...] "She's not 'Lady Behave Yourself.' Do you want great behavior from a person named Gaga? <b>Is</b> <b>this</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> were expecting?" ...|$|E

500|$|In his {{preview of}} Apple's 2010 reissues, for Rolling Stone, David Fricke listed <b>Is</b> <b>This</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Want? third among the label's top five non-Beatle album {{releases}} and praised [...] "Sour Milk Sea" [...] as, variously, a [...] "get-off-your-ass rocker" [...] and [...] "dynamite". Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot considered {{it to be}} [...] "a knockout version". Among reviews of the Come and Get It compilation, Douglas Wolk of Pitchfork Media opined that [...] "Sour Milk Sea" [...] "would've {{been one of the}} best songs on [...] if George had kept it for himself", while Uncuts David Cavanagh described the track as [...] "sensational". AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine calls the song [...] "a dense, brilliant, and soulful psychedelic rocker". In his liner notes to the compilation, Andy Davis, formerly the editor of Record Collector magazine, highlights [...] "Sour Milk Sea" [...] as [...] "the greatest record The Beatles never made".|$|E
500|$|The song's exhortation to [...] "Get back {{to where}} you should be" [...] was partly {{appropriated}} by McCartney in his lyrics to [...] "Get Back", which the Beatles recorded in January 1969. Both sides of Lomax's single were included on his only album for Apple, <b>Is</b> <b>This</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Want?, released in March 1969. The album similarly failed to achieve commercial success, a result that perplexed the Beatles, who continued to believe in his talents. Due to the song's strong association with the Beatles and Eric Clapton, [...] "Sour Milk Sea" [...] retained a degree of renown among rock music fans; Danny Eccleston of Mojo magazine later {{described it as a}} [...] "cult rendering". In 1970, Sour Milk Sea, one of singer Freddie Mercury's pre-Queen bands, was named after the track. In June the following year, Apple re-released [...] "Sour Milk Sea" [...] with [...] "Fall Inside Your Eyes" [...] on the B-side, but this single also failed to chart.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Is</b> <b>This</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Want? is {{the debut}} album by English rock and soul singer Jackie Lomax, {{released}} in 1969 on the Beatles' Apple record label. It {{was produced by}} George Harrison and features contributions from Harrison's Beatles bandmates Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr. The album includes Lomax's debut single for Apple, the Harrison-written [...] "Sour Milk Sea", while the US version added [...] "New Day", which was produced by Lomax and released as a non-album single in Britain.|$|E

[...] Mi Fang felt ashamed when he heard Yu Fan's remark.|$|E
2500|$|Author Bill Harry {{has written}} that Lomax's lack of chart success [...] "completely baffled The Beatles because Jackie {{had one of the}} rare and {{distinctive}} voices which have the potential of turning its owner into a superstar". Leng attributes the album's underachievement to the Beatles' inexperience as label owners. He says that they relied too heavily on establishing their artists with a hit single and that, after [...] "Sour Milk Sea" [...] had failed to become a hit, this formula left <b>Is</b> <b>This</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Want? without an adequate marketing strategy.|$|E
2500|$|Barham {{also worked}} on Harrison's {{projects}} with acts signed to the Beatles' Apple record label. Among these releases was <b>Is</b> <b>This</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Want? (1969) by Jackie Lomax, That's the Way God Planned It (1969) by Billy Preston, and Radha Krishna Temple (London)'s 1970 hit single [...] "Govinda". The latter was a musical adaptation of a sacred Hindu poem from the Satya Yuga. Through his connection with Harrison, Barham also played harpsichord on Yoko Ono's [...] "Who Has Seen the Wind?", released in February 1970 as the B-side to John Lennon's Spector-produced single [...] "Instant Karma!" ...|$|E

2500|$|On release, <b>Is</b> <b>This</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Want? {{received}} enthusiastic reviews. In a 1970 {{interview with}} Robert Greenfield of Rolling Stone, however, Lomax lamented that commentators {{tended to focus}} on the line-up of superstar backing musicians, saying, [...] "they're always talkin' about who's on the album and not the album itself." [...] Writing in ZigZag in July 1974, Andy Childs advised the magazine's readers: [...] "it's worth its weight in gold, so if it's absent from your collection, add it to your shopping list of second-hand records." [...] Greenfield and Childs both recognised Harrison's [...] "Sour Milk Sea" [...] as a highlight of the album.|$|E
2500|$|Recording resumed in London in December 1968, with {{horns and}} backing vocals being overdubbed on [...] "Baby You're a Lover" [...] and [...] "You've Got Me Thinking". The album (in its UK version) was {{completed}} in London during January 1969, in between Harrison's commitments to the Beatles' ill-fated Get Back project. Although only John Barham would be credited for orchestration on <b>Is</b> <b>This</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Want?, Beatles producer George Martin can be heard on Get Back audio tapes from 10 January wondering whether Harrison, who had just walked out on the band, would be attending a strings overdubbing session Martin had arranged that evening for one of Lomax's tracks.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Is</b> <b>This</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Want? was {{released}} in the UK on 21 March 1969 (with the Apple catalogue number SAPCOR 6), and in the United States on 19 May (as Apple ST 3354). The accompanying single, [...] "New Day", was issued on 9 May and 2 June, respectively, in Britain and America. Apple promoted Lomax as an enigmatic singer in the mould of Jim Morrison, yet, according to Harrison biographer Simon Leng, the public's response to the suggestive album title was [...] "an apathetic 'no'". The single failed to chart and the album's only placing was number 145 on the Billboard Top LPs listing in the US during a nine-week chart stay.|$|E

2500|$|Recording for <b>Is</b> <b>This</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Want? {{began at}} EMI Studios in London in June 1968 and {{continued}} through the summer in between Harrison's work on the Beatles' White Album. While working alone at Trident Studios, {{down the hall from}} where the band were recording, Lomax was invited to add backing vocals to [...] "Dear Prudence" [...] in late August; he had also joined the backing chorus for [...] "Hey Jude" [...] earlier that month. The songs recorded for Lomax's project included [...] "Sour Milk Sea" [...] and [...] "The Eagle Laughs at You", the A- and B-side of his debut single, released in August 1968, and [...] "You've Got Me Thinking".|$|E
2500|$|The US {{version of}} <b>Is</b> <b>This</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Want?, which was issued {{two months after}} the British release, {{included}} [...] "New Day", a Lomax composition that was originally intended as a standalone single. Lomax later said he had to push to persuade Apple that it was worth recording. The sessions in March–April 1969 were his first as a producer, supported by longtime Beatles associate Mal Evans. Lomax also worked closely with Barham on the song's descending brass parts. The backing musicians were previously listed as Clapton, Starr and Billy Preston, but author John Winn states that this is incorrect, given the playing styles heard on the recording and Lomax's subsequent comments. Winn credits Harrison for one of the guitar parts, while Lomax stated that he was also accompanied by his live band at the time: Tim Renwick, Chris Hatfield, Billy Kinsley and Pete Clark.|$|E
2500|$|According to the album's liner notes, [...] "No Time or Space" [...] was {{recorded}} [...] "in California in November 1968 {{with the assistance}} of Bernie Krause". Krause later said that [...] "No Time or Space" [...] (UK LP side two, US LP side one) was essentially a recording of him demonstrating the Moog III to Harrison in Los Angeles, following a session for Jackie Lomax's album <b>Is</b> <b>This</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Want?, which Harrison was producing at the time. Krause also claimed that the demonstration {{was recorded}} without his knowledge and nor would he have given his consent, since his playing was a preview of a piece he intended to include on the next Beaver & Krause album. Krause's name was originally included on the front cover of Electronic Sound, under Harrison's credit, but it was painted over at Krause's insistence. The words [...] "Assisted by Bernie Krause" [...] can nevertheless still be read under the silver ink on original LP pressings.|$|E
