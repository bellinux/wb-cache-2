5|$|Occasionally, {{influenza}} {{can cause}} severe illness including primary viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia. The obvious symptom is trouble breathing. In addition, <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> (or presumably an adult) {{seems to be}} getting better and then relapses with a high fever, that is a danger sign since this relapse can be bacterial pneumonia.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of Kids Can Say No!, many {{teachers}} who showed the film to their students reported receiving disclosures of abuse. Because many of the teachers said they were unsure of {{how to deal with}} the disclosures, Harris and Skippon collaborated on the 1986 sequel Beyond the Scare. Kids Can Say No! encourages children to report abuse they experience and Beyond the Scare advises teachers about what to do <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> makes such a disclosure.|$|E
25|$|Children will mirror {{their parents}} in this aspect of speech. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>child's</b> parents engage in code-switching in their own speech, this will affect the child's {{perception}} of the appropriateness of mixing languages.|$|R
50|$|<b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>children</b> {{less than}} one and is unable to breathe at all then five back blows {{followed}} by five chest thrusts should be done. In children {{over the age of}} one abdominal thrusts are recommended.|$|R

5|$|Obayashi {{already had}} {{experience}} with special effects {{from his work}} on television commercials. Obayashi and the cameraman oversaw the special effects for the film. Obayashi desired the special effects to look unrealistic, as <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> created them. For the scene in which Ai Matsubara's character vanishes under the blood, Obayashi had her suspended nude, pouring buckets of blue paint on her to create a blue-screen chroma key effect where the blue colored parts of her body would deteriorate on camera. The outcome {{of a lot of}} these effects would be unknown until the film was completed. Obayashi stated that sometimes the effects did not turn out how he originally envisioned them.|$|E
5|$|This act {{introduced}} the 11+ examination to determine <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> should {{be eligible for}} a grammar school, secondary modern or technical college, under the Tripartite System, but has since been phased out across {{the majority of the}} United Kingdom, with just several boroughs in England and Northern Ireland still using it. League tables published in March 2007 showed grammar schools throughout the country were outperforming comprehensive schools; data published ten years later in 2017 suggested a similar clear division between student attainment in grammar schools compared to comprehensive schools.|$|E
5|$|A truce term {{is a word}} {{or short}} phrase {{accepted}} within a community of children as an effective way of calling for a temporary respite or truce during a game or activity, such as tag or its variants. Common examples in English speaking cultures are barley, fainites, crosses, kings and exe(s)in the United Kingdom, pegs and nibs in New Zealand and variants of barley in Australia. In the United States, terms based on time-out have, from the 1950s onwards, largely supplanted earlier common terms based on kings and exe(s). Since the late 1980s time-out has been recorded in other English speaking cultures besides the US. Examples of use of truce terms are <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> has a stitch or wants to raise a point on {{the rules of the}} game.|$|E
25|$|Suppose {{that the}} node to delete is node <b>A.</b> <b>If</b> <b>A</b> has no <b>children,</b> {{deletion}} {{is accomplished by}} setting the <b>child</b> of <b>A's</b> parent to null. <b>If</b> <b>A</b> has one <b>child,</b> set the parent of <b>A's</b> <b>child</b> to <b>A's</b> parent and set the <b>child</b> of <b>A's</b> parent to <b>A's</b> <b>child.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{diagnosis}} can {{be confirmed}} in the laboratory by finding an absence or deficiency of the ATM protein in cultured blood cells, an absence or deficiency of ATM function (kinase assay), or mutations in both copies of the cell’s ATM gene. These more specialized tests are not always needed, but are particularly helpful <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>child’s</b> symptoms are atypical.|$|R
30|$|A severe lumbar curve {{can be a}} major {{difficulty}} in walking due to the resulting apparent leg length inequality. Additionally, <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>child’s</b> curve is very supple, he may need to expend an extra effort to stretch out the spine before the push on the crutch straightens the spine sufficiently to allow clearance during swing phase.|$|R
5|$|Harris {{said that}} {{he came up with}} the idea for the film on a 1982 Canadian tour when he saw Vancouver's Green Thumb Theatre {{production}} of Feeling Yes, Feeling No, a play about child sexual abuse. Kids Can Say No!, released in October 1985 on VHS in the United Kingdom, was the first British children's film about sexual abuse and was purchased by police forces, educational institutions, and libraries across Europe. Upon the film's release, The Times obtained opinions from four sexual-abuse experts, who unanimously opposed using Kids Can Say No! or any other film to teach children about the subject. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation received a positive response to its 1988 broadcast of Kids Can Say No! and therefore broadcast it a second time that year. Harris and Skippon collaborated on the 1986 sequel Beyond the Scare, which advises teachers about what to do <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> discloses abuse. Showings of Kids Can Say No! eventually decreased as VHS became less popular.|$|E
5|$|Past {{experiences}} {{or general}} knowledge {{is often called}} upon in conversation, {{so it is a}} useful context for children to learn words. Recalling past experiences allows the child to call upon their own visual, tactical, oral, and/or auditory references. For example, <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> once went to a zoo and saw an elephant, but did not know the word elephant, an adult could later help the child recall this event, describing the size and color of the animal, how big its ears were, its trunk, and the sound it made, then using the word elephant to refer to the animal. Calling upon prior knowledge is used not only in conversation, but often in book reading as well to help explain what is happening in a story by relating it back to the child's own experiences.|$|E
5|$|In October 1857 the inquisitor of Bologna, a Dominican friar called Father Pier Gaetano Feletti, {{learned of}} rumours {{to the effect}} that a secret baptism had been {{administered}} to one of the city's Jewish children by a Catholic servant. If true, this would make the child a Catholic {{in the eyes of the}} Church—a fact with secular as well as spiritual ramifications since the Church stance was that children they considered to be Christians could not be raised by non-Christians, and should be taken from their parents in such circumstances. Cases like this were not uncommon in 19th-century Italy, and often revolved around the baptism of a Jewish child by a Christian servant. The official Church position was that Catholics should not baptise Jewish children without the parents' consent, except <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> was on the brink of death—in these cases the Church considered the customary deferment to parental authority to be outweighed by the importance of allowing the child's soul to be saved and go to Heaven, and permitted baptism without the parents' assent. Many Jewish families feared clandestine baptisms by their Christian maids; to counter this perceived threat some households required Christians leaving their employment to sign notarised statements confirming that they had never baptised any of the children.|$|E

25|$|Vomiting often {{occurs during}} the first hour or two of {{treatment}} with ORS, especially <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> drinks the solution too quickly, but this seldom prevents successful rehydration {{since most of the}} fluid is still absorbed. WHO recommends that <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> vomits, to wait five or ten minutes and then start to give the solution again more slowly.|$|E
25|$|For example, <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> grows from 1nbsp&m to 1.5nbsp&m {{between the}} ages of two and six years, then, at some time between two and six years of age, the child's height must have been 1.25nbsp&m.|$|E
25|$|The Code also instituted the {{principle}} of the equality {{of men and women in}} relation to citizenship. Moreover, <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> did not possess his own goods, the necessary costs of his upbringing were predicated on those of the father.|$|E
50|$|<b>If,</b> however, <b>a</b> <b>child</b> with Down {{syndrome}} has seizures {{that are}} difficult to control, the child is at risk to develop an autistic spectrum disorder.|$|R
25|$|Also {{important}} was selecting the right day for intercourse <b>if</b> <b>a</b> person desired <b>children.</b> After the woman's period, the first, third or fifth days were the best. If on {{these days the}} man ejaculated after midnight, the child would likely be male. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> female <b>child</b> was desired, the man needed to ejaculate on the second, fourth or sixth days after the cessation of the woman's period.|$|R
50|$|Some states, such as Minnesota, have {{statutes}} {{allowing for}} a charge of <b>a</b> vehicular homicide <b>if</b> <b>an</b> unborn <b>child</b> is killed or injured by a motorist.|$|R
25|$|The {{aim of the}} {{campaign}} was {{for the government to}} allow controlled access to the sex offender registry, so parents with young children could know <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> sex-offender was living in their area. Sarah Payne's mother has always insisted that such a law would have saved her daughter's life.|$|E
25|$|<b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> of the {{deceased}} needs to change clothes during the shiva period, s/he must tear the changed clothes.

Children of {{the deceased}} may never sew the rent clothes, but any other mourner may mend the clothing 30 days after the burial.|$|E
25|$|A {{child may}} be {{eligible}} for Medicaid regardless of the eligibility status of his parents. Thus, a {{child may be}} covered by Medicaid based on his individual status even if his parents are not eligible. Similarly, <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> lives with someone other than a parent, he may still be eligible based on its individual status.|$|E
5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>child</b> born in Leiden (1622 - died 1623 at Plymouth, Massachusetts.) Bradford’s list of {{passengers}} stated “His wife was left behind, and <b>a</b> <b>child</b> which came afterwards.” <b>If</b> so, <b>a</b> <b>child</b> was {{not mentioned in}} Samuel’s will.|$|R
40|$|Untreated dental diseases, {{particularly}} dental caries, {{can lead}} to a range of adverse impacts on children, including pain and infection. Yet caries is preventable <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>child’s</b> basic oral health needs are met. Dental neglect occurs when there is persistent failure to meet those needs. Dentists and paediatricians can work together with other health and social care professionals to identify children with dental neglect and to intervene to safeguard their oral and general health and development...|$|R
5000|$|The series {{attracted}} considerable press attention over {{allegations of}} [...] "child abuse and cruelty". As a result, the UK government has [...] "ordered <b>a</b> review of <b>child</b> employment laws". Although {{there was much}} dispute {{over the fact that}} boys and girls would be living alone, they were provided with food, money and hygiene equipment, and there were trained chaperons that would step in <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>child's</b> safety was compromised.The UK regulator for TV and Radio OFCOM received over 180 complaints regarding the points stated above.|$|R
25|$|Among the South Slavs, {{and also}} among the Kashubs {{of what is now}} {{northern}} Poland, there was the belief that <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> was born with hair, a birthmark or a caul on their head, they were supposed to possess shape-shifting abilities. Though capable of turning into any animal they wished, it was commonly believed that such people preferred to turn into a wolf.|$|E
25|$|The Rabbis {{taught in}} a Baraita that <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> is {{intelligent}} enough to ask the four questions, the child asks them. If the child is not intelligent enough, the wife asks them. If the wife does not ask the questions, {{the leader of the}} seder asks them. And even two scholars who know the laws of Passover must ask one another (if no one else can ask).|$|E
25|$|A common aspect among abusers is {{that they}} {{witnessed}} abuse in their childhood, in other words they were participants in a chain of intergenerational cycles of domestic violence. That does not mean, conversely, that <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> witnesses or is subject to violence that they will become abusers. Understanding and breaking the intergenerational abuse patterns may do more to reduce domestic violence than other remedies for managing the abuse.|$|E
50|$|Prior to {{the passing}} of the Act, {{legitimacy}} was governed by the Legitimacy Act 1926. Under that act, the marriage of <b>a</b> <b>child's</b> parents after its birth did not legitimise it when one of the parents was married to a third person at the birth of the child. Although the Royal Commission on Marriage and Divorce recommended keeping this on the statute books by a vote of twelve to seven, Section 1 repealed this and allowed <b>a</b> <b>child</b> to be legitimised when his parents married, regardless of their past status. This was retroactive; <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>child's</b> parents were married when the Act came into force, the child was legitimised.|$|R
50|$|Individual {{differences}} in language development and comprehension may cause difficulties in determining <b>a</b> <b>child's</b> relative competence {{with the child}} testimony process and the trial. Although attorneys are required to use language that is developmentally appropriate with young child witnesses, children may still have difficulty understanding the difficult terminology associated with the courtroom. Even <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>child's</b> report is accurate, adults can also make inaccurate inferences based {{on his or her}} report. However, some research suggests that the reliability of children's communicative competence can be minimized by better and clearer instructions as well as by more thorough preparation before the trial.|$|R
50|$|The spouses of the {{children}} (that is, spouses of B, C, and D) are not considered. Spouses are {{not a part of}} the branch. Therefore, even if B, C, or D died leaving a spouse as well as children, all (100%) of the assets pass to {{the children}} and (0%) nothing passes to the spouses of <b>As</b> <b>children</b> B, C, and D. From the example above, <b>if</b> <b>As</b> <b>child</b> B died before As death, As grandchildren B1 and B2 would each receive half of Bs share. Even <b>if</b> B had <b>a</b> living spouse at the time of As death, that person would receive nothing from As estate.|$|R
