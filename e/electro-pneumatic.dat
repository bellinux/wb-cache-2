5|$|The {{development}} of pneumatic and <b>electro-pneumatic</b> key {{actions in the}} late 19th century {{made it possible to}} locate the console independently of the pipes, greatly expanding the possibilities in organ design. Electric stop actions were also developed, which allowed sophisticated combination actions to be created.|$|E
5|$|The organ {{has four}} manuals, 88speaking stops and 4565pipes. It works {{by way of}} air pressure, {{controlled}} by an electric current and operated by the keys of the organ console; this opens and closes valves within the wind chests, allowing the pipes to speak. This type of motion is called <b>electro-pneumatic</b> action.|$|E
5|$|A {{more recent}} {{development}} is the electric action which uses low voltage DC to control the key and/or stop mechanisms. Electricity may control the action indirectly through air pressure valves (pneumatics), {{in which case the}} action is <b>electro-pneumatic.</b> In such actions, an electromagnet attracts a small pilot valve which lets wind go to a bellows ("pneumatic") which opens the pallet. When electricity operates the action directly without the assistance of pneumatics, it is commonly referred to as direct electric action. In this type, the electromagnet's armature carries a disc pallet.|$|E

50|$|The {{faculty of}} the College of Engineering now trains {{technicians}} and engineers sent by local industries, visiting faculty, and senior students from different universities in the country. With industrial-type equipments and overseas-trained instructors, the University, through its Mechatronics Engineering - Automation Research and Training (MEE-ART) Center, offers a short-term training courses in basic and advanced pneumatics, industrial automation, mechatronics, <b>electro-pneumatics,</b> and programmable logic control.|$|R
50|$|A major {{application}} of relay logic is {{the control of}} routing and signalling on railways. This safety critical application uses interlocking to ensure conflicting routes can never be selected and helps reduce accidents. Elevators are another common application - large relay logic circuits were employed from the 1930s onward to replace the human elevator operator, but have been progressively superseded with modern solid-state controls in recent years.Relay logic is also used for controlling and automation purposes in electro-hydraulics and <b>electro-pneumatics.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 1932 {{the line}} to Upminster was {{electrified}} and new vehicles were purchased. After the District Railway became part of London Underground, similar cars were ordered to allow the Metropolitan line be extended to Barking and replace some of the rapidly deteriorating original wooden trailers. The 1935–40 New Works Programme fitted <b>electro-pneumatic</b> brakes and air-operated doors {{to most of the}} District line stock and allowed the remaining wooden cars to be scrapped. A number of motor cars were not suitable for conversion and so some trains retained their hand-worked doors and these ran until 1957.|$|E

25|$|Some {{of these}} {{refurbished}} organs {{have had their}} original <b>electro-pneumatic</b> relays replaced with electronic and/or computerized relays and modern, electronic consoles.|$|E
25|$|The <b>electro-pneumatic</b> {{action was}} invented by Robert Hope-Jones, and is {{considered}} by many to be the single most significant development in pipe organs. Up to the turn of the 20th century, all pipe organs were operated by a tracker, tubular pneumatic, or pneumatic Barker-lever action, where the keys and pedals were physically connected to the pipe valves via wooden trackers, except in the case of tubular pneumatic, where all actions were operated by air pressure. Hope-Jones' <b>electro-pneumatic</b> action eliminated this by using wind pressure, controlled by electric solenoids, to operate the pipe valves, and solenoids and pistons to control and operate the various stop tabs, controls, keys and pedals on the console. This action allowed the console to be physically detached from the organ. All signals from the console were transmitted by an electric cable to an <b>electro-pneumatic</b> relay, and from there to the pipes and effects in the organ chambers.|$|E
25|$|After {{the advent}} of {{unification}} and the <b>electro-pneumatic</b> action, builders of church organs started to see the advantages of these systems. As a result, several organ builders began adopting these concepts for use in their church organs. Among these were Austin, Möller, Aeolian-Skinner and Kimball, who used <b>electro-pneumatic</b> action in many of their organs. Today, approximately one fourth of all new or rebuilt church pipe organs use an <b>electro-pneumatic</b> action either exclusively, or as an augmentation to existing tracker actions. In the same vein, some amount of unification was utilized in some church organs, and even today many church pipe organs utilize some degree of unification in areas where it is not critical to the classical sound sought in such instruments, or in instruments where space for pipes is limited. With stops such as the 32' bourdon in the pedal division, or a 16' reed in a manual division, the basic theatre organ concept of extension is commonly—but discreetly—used by even the most noted organ builders.|$|E
25|$|Although 169 Queensland railway {{stations}} had interlocking by 1918, {{mechanical interlocking}} technology eventually became obsolete, as electrical interlocking or <b>electro-pneumatic</b> systems replaced it. Computerised Centralised Traffic Control (CTC) signalling systems now control {{most of the}} network.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of other {{automatic}} train couplings similar to the Scharfenberg coupler, but not necessarily compatible with it. Older US transit operators continue to use these non-Janney <b>electro-pneumatic</b> coupler designs and have used them for decades.|$|E
25|$|Electro-vacuum brakes {{have also}} been used with {{considerable}} success on South African electric multiple unit trains. Despite requiring larger and heavier equipment as stated above, {{the performance of the}} electro-vacuum brake approached that of contemporary <b>electro-pneumatic</b> brakes. However, their use has not been repeated.|$|E
25|$|In {{the days}} of silent film, sound effects were added by the {{operator}} of a theater organ or photoplayer, both of which also supplied the soundtrack of the film. Theater organ sound effects are usually electric or <b>electro-pneumatic,</b> and activated by a button pressed with the hand or foot.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} 1889 {{signal box}} {{was replaced with}} an <b>electro-pneumatic</b> power-operated box based on the Westinghouse system. Work started in October 1907 and it opened on 5 April 1908. It was built directly over the River Clyde, sitting between the two river bridges, above {{the level of the}} tracks. Inside was a frame of 374 miniature levers, making it the longest power frame ever built in Great Britain.|$|E
25|$|Passenger trains {{have had}} {{for a long time}} a 3-wire version of the <b>electro-pneumatic</b> brake, which gives seven levels of braking force. In most cases the system is not fail-safe, with the wires being {{energized}} in sequence to apply the brakes, but the conventional automatic air brake is also provided to act as a fail safe, and in most cases can be used independently {{in the event of a}} failure of the EP brakes.|$|E
25|$|Each Fratelli Ruffatti organ is unique.The tonal {{planning}} of each instrument takes {{into consideration the}} ideas and musical needs of the customer {{as well as the}} space available and the acoustic environment. The primary objective of the aesthetic design is to blend with the existing architecture. Although most Ruffatti instruments utilize the traditional mechanical action, they also produce instruments with <b>electro-pneumatic</b> and all-electric actions. While Ruffatti's continue to refine the sounds of Italian principals and flutes, they have added a wide variety of European and American organ sounds previously unknown in Italy, making their instruments international.|$|E
25|$|The British Rail Class 423 (or 4Vep (Vestibuled <b>Electro-Pneumatic</b> brake)) {{electrical}} {{multiple units}} were built by British Rail (BR) at York Works from 1967 to 1974, although the MBSOs and TSOs {{of the first}} 20, 7701-7720, were constructed at Derby Works. They feature manually opening doors next to every seating row and were the last coaching stock built in this pattern for BR. They were mostly found working outer suburban services in South London, and rural services in Kent and Sussex, up to 2005 when they were finally replaced by Electrostar and Desiro units. The fleet had a lifespan of 38 years.|$|E
25|$|A ninth {{platform}} {{was added}} to Central station in 1889, but a major expansion {{took place in the}} years 1901–1906, when the platforms were lengthened and four platforms added on the west side; a second river crossing was provided. In 1904 Bridge Street station was substantially changed to provide carriage washing and stabling facilities; it closed as a passenger station on 1 March 1905. Central station was operated by a single signal box, staffed with ten men. It was commissioned on 3 May 1908; it had 374 miniature levers, the largest of its type in the world, operating points and signals by <b>electro-pneumatic</b> and electro-magnetic equipment.|$|E
25|$|In 1931 {{the organ}} was reconstructed by Henry WillisIII {{when the number}} of stops was {{increased}} to 120 and <b>electro-pneumatic</b> action introduced for the combination systems and some of the key action. Its power source was still the Rockingham electric blowing plant which had replaced the two steam engines (one of 1855 and a second which had been added in about 1877 to run the increased pressure required since 1867 for some reed stops. In the interim this higher pressure had been hand blown!) The 1924 electric blowers remained in use until 2000 when the present new low and high pressure blowers were fitted by David Wells.|$|E
25|$|On 1 July 1933 the District Railway amalgamated {{with other}} Underground railways, tramway {{companies}} and bus operators {{to form the}} London Passenger Transport Board, and from 23 October 1933 Piccadilly line trains ran through to Uxbridge and the District line shuttle withdrawn. Most of the trailer cars on the District line were the 1904–05 B Stock type with wooden bodies, but motor cars were less than fifteen years old. The 1935–40 New Works Programme saw the Q Stock formed from these motor cars, upgraded with <b>electro-pneumatic</b> brakes and guard controlled air-operated doors, and the trailers replaced with new vehicles. The off-peak District line services on the Hounslow branch were withdrawn on 29 April 1935 and South Acton served by a shuttle to Acton Town.|$|E
500|$|An organ {{contains}} two actions, or systems of moving parts. When a key is depressed, the key action admits wind into a pipe. The stop action allows the organist to control which ranks are engaged. An action may be mechanical, pneumatic, or electrical (or {{some combination of}} these, such as <b>electro-pneumatic</b> action). [...] The key action is independent of the stop action, allowing an organ to combine a mechanical key action along with an electric stop action.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} organ {{was moved}} from its central {{position in the}} crossing to the north transept during Scott's restoration. The instrument performed badly following the move, which was attributed to the cold and dampness of its new position. Consequently, it {{was moved to the}} south transept, but it performed no better there, and in 1889 it was sold to Haydock church. The present organ was built in 1890 by Forster and Andrews and partly rebuilt in about 1925. It was again rebuilt in 1973 by Charles Whiteley and Company, who installed <b>electro-pneumatic</b> action among other additions and repairs. Rushworth and Dreaper made further additions during their 1994 restoration. [...] The parish registers date back to 1539 and contain much material relating to Nantwich's history. [...] There is a ring of eight bells, four of which were cast by Rudhall of Gloucester in 1713, and the other four by John Taylor and Company in 1922.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Electro-pneumatic</b> or EP brakes are {{a type of}} {{air brake}} that allows for {{immediate}} application of brakes throughout the train instead of the sequential application. EP brakes have been in British practice since 1949 and also used in German high-speed trains (most notably the ICE) since the late 1980s, they are fully described in <b>Electro-pneumatic</b> brake system on British railway trains. [...] <b>Electro-pneumatic</b> brakes are currently in testing in North America and South Africa in captive service ore and coal trains.|$|E
2500|$|In 1871 an {{explosion}} of the Luxembourg powder magazine caused major damage to the organ. It was not until 1906 that it was restored, with innovative <b>electro-pneumatic</b> components. [...] These gradually deteriorated, and another major restoration was undertaken in the 1960s by Alfred Kern & fils.|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} [...] "special shanks" [...] have been {{developed}} by various manufacturers. Over the years {{a fair number of}} these proprietary systems evolved, but the remaining shanks in use today are: SDS+, SDS-MAX, and SPLINE SHANK. [...] These shanks were developed in order to allow for the bit to [...] "slide" [...] back and forth while rotating, so that the drill bit can efficiently transfer the force of the <b>electro-pneumatic</b> hammering mechanism to the working surface.|$|E
2500|$|Normally Kilburn High Road and Stonebridge Power House which {{controlled}} only plain {{track with}} crossovers were switched out and only Queens Park, Willesden and Harrow boxes were staffed {{for at least}} part of the day, to deal with junction and siding traffic. In the early 1980s manual control of signalling was needed for a few months after dragging gear on a train destroyed many electric train-stops which were of a design almost confined to this line (LU train-stops are mostly <b>electro-pneumatic).</b> By this time the signal boxes at Stonebridge Power House and Kilburn High Road had been abolished. Emergency crossovers at other locations were controlled by [...] ground frames enclosed in structures the size of a garden shed.|$|E
2500|$|Several of {{the systems}} within the Class 24s were {{standard}}. The braking system was the standard BR system, adopted {{as part of the}} Modernisation Plan, of locomotive air and train vacuum brake, both applied by a single handle via a proportional valve. Similarly the connection for multiple working was the standard <b>electro-pneumatic</b> system designated [...] "Blue Star" [...] with each loco bearing a small blue coloured 5-pointed star above each buffer to denote this. Also common was the provision of a door to allow staff to pass between locomotives, or between a locomotive and adjacent coach. In practice these were rarely used and were sealed shut at overhaul during the 1970s to reduce draughts in the cab.|$|E
2500|$|Recent {{tracker action}} {{instruments}} exist at West Vancouver United Church (Pasi Organ Builders), Christ Church Cathedral (Vancouver) (Kenneth Jones), the Danish Lutheran Church in Burnaby (Marcussen), the UBC School of Music (Casavant Frères) and Gloria Dei Lutheran Church in North Vancouver (Koppejan). Organs in acoustically [...] "live" [...] spaces [...] include those of [...] St. Paul's Anglican (Casavant Frères, circa 1913), Holy Rosary Roman Catholic Cathedral (Karn-Warren, rebuilt by Casavant Frères) and [...] St. James' Anglican Church (Casavant Frères). The largest <b>electro-pneumatic</b> instruments {{are those of}} St Andrews-Wesley United Church, Ryerson United Church (Casavant Frères), Holy Trinity Anglican Pro-Cathedral in New Westminster (rebuilt by Harold Keefer), Star of the Sea Catholic Church in South Surrey (Koppejan) and the historic Casavant Frères of Holy Trinity Anglican.|$|E
2500|$|The Scharfenberg coupler (...) is {{probably}} the most commonly used type of fully automatic coupling. Designed in 1903 by Karl Scharfenberg in Königsberg, Germany (today Kaliningrad, Russia), it has gradually spread from transit trains to regular passenger service trains, although outside Europe its use is generally restricted to mass transit systems. The Schaku coupler is superior in many ways to the AAR (Janney/Knuckle) coupler because it makes the electrical and also the pneumatic connections and disconnections automatic. However, there is no standard for the placement of these <b>electro-pneumatic</b> connections. Some rail companies have them placed on the sides while others have them placed above the mechanical portion of the Schaku coupler. The main disadvantage to the Scharfenberg coupler is its low maximum tonnage, which makes it unsuitable for freight operations.|$|E
