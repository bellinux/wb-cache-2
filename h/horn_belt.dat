50|$|The {{traditional}} Laz men's costume {{consists of}} a peculiar bandanalike kerchief covering the entire head above the eyes, knotted {{on the side and}} hanging down to the shoulder and the upper back; a snug-fitting jacket of coarse brown homespun with loose sleeves; and baggy dark brown woolen trousers tucked into slim, knee-high leather boots. The women's costume was similar to the wide-skirted princess gown found throughout Georgia but worn with a similar kerchief to that of the men and with a rich scarf tied around the hips. Laz men crafted excellent homemade rifles and even while at the plow were usually seen bristling with arms: rifle, pistol, powder <b>horn,</b> cartridge <b>belts</b> across the chest, a dagger at the hip, and a coil of rope for trussing captives.|$|R
5000|$|Among {{the grave}} goods, {{now in the}} British Museum, were 19 vessels for feasting and drinking, at least three weapon sets, a lyre, a gaming board, and rich textiles, the whole {{ensemble}} [...] "recognisably {{a version of the}} standard Germanic princely kit". Many of the objects seem to be of Kentish origin. The several gold braids in the burial may have been a symbol of royalty, and the largest <b>horns</b> and the <b>belt</b> buckle were apparently already old when buried, suggesting the treasure of a [...] "Kentish princely family".|$|R
5000|$|Very {{little is}} known about Queen Yu in history, {{including}} when or where she was born. Qian Chu's first wife Sun Taizhen died in 976, so he must have married (or elevated from concubinage) Queen Yu as his queen after that time, {{but it is not clear}} when, nor is it completely clear that it was before Wuyue was absorbed by its suzerain Song in 978. [...] Qian Chu, after Wuyue's absorption into Song, carried a number of noble titles in succession — King of Huaihai, King of Hannan, King of Nanyang, Prince of Xu, and Prince of Deng (and was eventually posthumously created the King of Qin), but it is unclear what titles Queen Yu carried during that period. [...] After Qian Chu's death in 988, Qian Chu's oldest son Qian Weijun and other sons submitted much of his wealth to then-reigning Emperor Taizong of Song, and it was said that part of the tribute was from Queen Yu — including gold, silver, rhinoceros <b>horns,</b> jade <b>belts,</b> and crystal Buddha statues. [...] There was no subsequent historical reference to her.|$|R

Natural Resources Research Institute, University of Minnesota Duluth, 5013 Miller Trunk Highway, Duluth, MN 55811 - 1442 Most of the Mesabi Purchase is {{underlain}} by granitic {{rocks of}} the Giants Range Batholith that exhibit an extremely low mineral potential {{to host a}} metallic deposit. This low potential is demonstrated {{by the lack of}} mineral exploration and other core holes drilled in the area by mineral exploration companies. In fact, the vast majority of drill holes shown in the area are associated with scientific holes drilled by the Minnesota Geological Survey for mapping purposes as a follow-up of regional geophysical interpretations. The copper-nickel-PGE mineralization located to the east in the Duluth Complex does not occur in the Mesabi Purchase area. The various types of geologic terrains, and their mineral potential, albeit low in almost all cases, are listed below: • Giants Range Batholith granitic rocks (pink, purple, and orange units on map) : 1. Rare Earth Elements (REEs - unknown, but most likely low to moderate potential in spatially-limited deposits; currently being investigated by NRRI throughout Minnesota); 2. Gold along fault zones or contact zones with Greenstone Belt (unknown potential, but unlikely in spatially-limited deposits); 3. Road Aggregate (crushed rock); and 4. Dimension Stone • Greenstone Belt (North Half of Block – green, pale green, and yellow units on map) : 1. Copper-Zinc associated with Volcanic Hosted Massive Sulfide deposits (very low potential overall, with moderate potential in T. 61 N., R. 17 W.); 2. Gold associated with shear zones and faulted rock (very low potential overall, with weak potential in T. 61 N., R. 17 W.); • Small granitic to syenitic plutons associated with a Greenstone terrain (circular pink units on map) with a low to moderate potential of hosting Rare Earth Elements; 2 • Virginia <b>Horn</b> Greenstone <b>Belt</b> (extreme southeastern corner) : 1. Gold associated with a syn-volcanic Quartz Feldspar Porphyry (very low potential that has been tested by three drill holes); and • Mesabi Iron Range (red unit on extreme southern fringe of block) : 1. Magnetic Taconite ores (the potential of these ores are negligible as most of the rock has already been mined out at the Minntac West Pit, Minntac East Pit, and Minorca Pit); and 2. Road Aggregate (crushed rock – also negligible as in the above category). 3. Mine tailings for various aggregates, bridge deck surfaces, etc. Detailed Township and Range Descriptions T. 61 N., R. 21 W.
