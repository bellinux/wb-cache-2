25|$|Motility is {{encouraged}} {{by the use of}} prokinetic drugs such as erythromycin, metoclopramide, bethanechol and lidocaine, as well as through vigorous walking, which has also been shown to have a beneficial effect on GI motility.

Metoclopramide has been shown to reduce reflux and hospital stay, but does has excitatory effects on the central nervous system. Anti-inflammatory drugs are used to decrease inflammation of the GI tract, which is thought to be the underlying cause of the disease, as well as to help control any absorption of LPS in cases of endotoxemia since the substance decreases motility However, care must be taken when giving these drugs, as NSAIDs have been shown to alter <b>intestinal</b> <b>motility.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to fluid support, impactions are often treated with intestinal lubricants and laxatives to help move the obstruction along. Mineral oil {{is the most}} commonly used lubricant for large colon impactions, and is administered via nasogastric tube, up to 4 liters once or twice daily. It helps coat the intestine, but is not very effective for severe impactions or sand colic since it may simply bypass the obstruction. Mineral oil has the added benefit of crudely measuring GI transit time, a process which normally takes around 18 hours, since it is obvious when it is passed. The detergent dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (DDS) is also commonly given in oral fluids. It is more effective in softening an impaction than mineral oil, and helps stimulate <b>intestinal</b> <b>motility,</b> but can inhibit fluid absorption from the intestine and is potentially toxic so is only given in small amounts, two separate times 48 hours apart. Epsom salts are also useful for impactions, since they act both as an osmotic agent, to increase fluid in the GI tract, and as a laxative, but do run the risk of dehydration and diarrhea. Strong laxatives are not recommended for treating impactions.|$|E
25|$|Small {{amounts of}} food is usually {{introduced}} {{as soon as}} possible after surgery, usually within 18–36 hours, to encourage motility and reduce the risk of ileus and the formation of adhesions. Often horses are stall rested with short bouts of hand walking to encourage <b>intestinal</b> <b>motility.</b> The incision site is carefully monitored for dehiscence, or complete failure of the incision leading to spillage of the abdominal contents out of the incision site, and the horse is not allowed turn-out until the incision has healed, usually after 30 days of stall rest. Abdominal bandages are sometimes used to help prevent the risk of dehiscence. Incisional infection doubles the time required for postoperative care, and dehiscence may lead to intestinal herniation, which reduces the likelihood of return to athletic function. Therefore, antibiotics are given 2–3 days after surgery, and temperature is constantly monitored, to help assess if an infection is present. Antibiotics are not used long-term due to the risk of antimicrobial resistance. The incision usually takes 6 months to reach 80% strength, while intestinal healing following resection and anastomosis is much faster, at a rate to 100% strength in 3 weeks. After the incision has healed adequately, the horse is turned out in a small area for another 2–3 months, and light exercise is added to improve the tone and strength of the abdominal musculature.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Infants with {{gastroschisis}} (GS) {{still face}} severe morbidity. Prenatal closure may prevent gastrointestinal organ damage, but intrauterine GS repair (GSR) {{has not been}} established yet. Methods: In New Zealand White rabbits we developed and compared GS versus GSR: creation of GS was achieved by hysterotomy, right-sided laparotomy of the fetus and pressure on the abdominal wall to provoke evisceration. GSR was accomplished by careful reposition of eviscerated organs and a running suture of the fetal abdominal wall. For study purposes, 18 animals were divided equally into 3 groups: GS, GS with GSR after 2 h, and unmanipulated controls (C). Vitality was assessed by echocardiography. After 5 h all animals were sacrificed. Results: GSR inflicted no increased mortality, because all fetuses survived GS or GS with GSR. All fetuses with GS demonstrated significant evisceration of abdominal organs. In contrast, the abdominal wall of the fetuses from GSR was intact. Conclusion:The present animal model demonstrated the technical feasibility and success of an intrauterine repair of GS for the first time. However, further long-term studies (leaving GS and GSR in utero for several days) {{will be necessary to}} compare survival rates and <b>intestinal</b> injury, <b>motility</b> or absorption.

40|$|Chronic {{intestinal}} pseudo-obstruction is {{a severe}} syndrome {{characterized by a}} profound derangement of the <b>intestinal</b> propulsive <b>motility</b> that resembles mechanical obstruction, {{in the absence of}} any mechanical obstruction. This syndrome represents one of the main causes of intestinal failure and is characterized by impairment of physical growth and development as well as by a high rate of morbidity and mortality. It may be idiopathic or secondary to a variety of diseases. Most cases are sporadic, even though familial forms with either dominant or recessive autosomal inheritance have been described. Based on histological features intestinal pseudo-obstruction is classified into 3 main groups: neuropathies, mesenchymopathies, and myopathics, according to the predominant involvement of enteric neurones, interstitial cells of Cajal, and smooth muscle cells, respectively. Treatment of intestinal pseudo-obstruction involves nutritional, pharmacological, and surgical therapies, but it is often frustrating and does not change the natural Course in the majority of cases. The nutritional management has a crucial importance in pediatric age and involves the administration of special formulae, the enteral delivery of nutrients, by a nasogastric tube, percutaneous gastrostomy, or jejunostomy.
