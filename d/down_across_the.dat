5|$|July 1, 2013: A {{series of}} three tornadoes touch <b>down</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> state; one in Fairfield County and two in Hartford County. Majority of impact limited to downed trees, though the EF1 caused notable {{structural}} damage near East Windsor.|$|E
5|$|In the Bahamas, wind gusts reached 110mph (170km/h) on Grand Bahama. Bermuda {{was also}} {{impacted}} by the hurricane, with strong winds blowing roofs off buildings, including {{a portion of the}} roof on the House of Assembly of Bermuda, and the sides of some structures were knocked down. Electrical light wires and telephone lines were <b>down</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> island. Kindley Air Force Base and the U.S. Naval Base received minimal damage. Damages exceeded $1million.|$|E
5|$|Less than 30seconds {{after the}} {{subsequent}} kick-off, United forced another corner, but Schmeichel stayed in his penalty area this time under instruction from Ferguson. Beckham again swung the corner in, finding {{the head of}} Sheringham, who nodded the ball <b>down</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> face of goal. Solskjær reacted fastest, shot out a foot and poked {{the ball into the}} roof of the Bayern goal for United to take the lead. The goal was timed at 90+2:17'. Solskjær celebrated by sliding on his knees, mimicking Basler's earlier celebration, before quickly being mobbed by the United players, substitutes and coaching staff. Schmeichel, in his own penalty area, cartwheeled with glee.|$|E

5|$|The {{outbreak}} {{began with}} an isolated F2 over the Florida Keys on August26; no tornadoes were recorded the following day as the storm traversed the Gulf of Mexico. Four weak tornadoes were observed on August28 as the hurricane approached land, each causing little damage. Coincident with Katrina's landfall, activity began in earnest on August29 with numerous tornadoes touching down across Gulf Coast states. Georgia suffered {{the greatest impact on}} this day, with multiple F1 and F2 tornadoes causing significant damage; one person died in Carroll County, marking the first known instance of a tornado-related death in the state during August. A record 18tornadoes touched down across Georgia on August29, far exceeding the previous daily record of just 2tornadoes for the month throughout the state. Activity diminished over the subsequent two days as the former hurricane moved northward. Several more tornadoes touched <b>down</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Mid-Atlantic states before the cessation of the outbreak just after midnight local time on August31.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{development}} of Tropical Storm Earl, tropical storm watches were issued for Barbados, St. Vincent, and St. Lucia. This watch was modified to a tropical storm warning by August14 at 2100UTC, {{with the addition of}} the islands of the Grenadines, Trinidad, Tobago, and Grenada. The tropical storm warning for Barbados was changed to a tropical storm watch the following day at 1200UTC, and all tropical cyclone watches and warnings were discontinued by 1800UTC. In preparation of the storm, several hundred people in Grenada evacuated from low-lying areas to schools set up as shelters. Shopkeepers boarded windows, while airports were temporarily shut <b>down</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Leeward Islands. Initial forecasts predicted that Earl would strengthen considerably into a hurricane and head towards Florida once in the Caribbean Sea, a state already impacted heavily earlier in the month by Hurricane Charley. The local officials urged residents to exercise caution, but not panic due to the large errors in long-range forecasts. These warnings eased upon the system's degeneration into an open tropical wave.|$|E
25|$|Holly's Restaurant During the 1980s and 1990s, every Kmart store had a Holly's in-store restaurant. Starting {{from the}} late 1980s, they were {{progressively}} shut <b>down</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> country, with the last Holly's at Kmart Horsham closing down on June 25, 2010.|$|E
5|$|October 23, 1878– The Gale of 1878 {{passes to}} the west of New Jersey, {{producing}} winds of up to 84mph (136km/h). Strong winds uproof around 150houses in Camden, while telegraph lines and trees are <b>downed</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> state. In addition, many railroad lines are either washed out or blown over. The hurricane causes high tides and strong flooding, destroying several houses along the coastline. In all, the hurricane causes 8 deaths and severe damage.|$|R

25|$|Six of Ulster's nine counties, Antrim, Armagh, Down, Fermanagh, Londonderry and Tyrone, {{including}} the former parliamentary boroughs of Belfast and Londonderry, form Northern Ireland which remained {{part of the}} United Kingdom after the partition of Ireland in 1921. Three Ulster counties – Cavan, Donegal and Monaghan – form part of the Republic of Ireland. About half of Ulster's population lives in counties Antrim and <b>Down.</b> <b>Across</b> <b>the</b> nine counties, according to the aggregate UK 2011 Census for Northern Ireland, and the ROI 2011 Census for counties Cavan, Donegal and Monaghan, there is a Roman Catholic majority over Protestant of 50.8% to 42.7%.|$|E
25|$|After sunrise, severe {{storms and}} tornadoes {{continued}} {{further to the}} east, and the Storm Prediction Center later issued a moderate risk for parts of Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi, along with an enhanced risk for parts of Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, and Florida. This included a 10% risk area for tornadoes, and numerous tornadoes touched <b>down</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> threat area, several of which were strong and caused significant damage. During {{the early morning hours}} of January 22, a deadly EF3 tornado produced devastating damage and obliterated a mobile home park near Adel, Georgia, killing 11 people along its path. Numerous other people were injured in the state because of the storms.|$|E
25|$|According to legend, {{the columns}} are {{the remains of}} a {{causeway}} built by a giant. The story goes that the Irish giant Fionn mac Cumhaill (Finn MacCool), from the Fenian Cycle of Gaelic mythology, was challenged to a fight by the Scottish giant Benandonner. Fionn accepted the challenge and built the causeway across the North Channel so that the two giants could meet. In one version of the story, Fionn defeats Benandonner. In another, Fionn hides from Benandonner when he realises that his foe is much bigger than he is. Fionn's wife, Oonagh, disguises Fionn as a baby and tucks him in a cradle. When Benandonner sees the size of the 'baby', he reckons that its father, Fionn, must be a giant among giants. He flees back to Scotland in fright, destroying the causeway behind him so that Fionn would be unable to chase him <b>down.</b> <b>Across</b> <b>the</b> sea, there are identical basalt columns (a part of the same ancient lava flow) at Fingal's Cave on the Scottish isle of Staffa, and {{it is possible that the}} story was influenced by this.|$|E

25|$|Additional tornadoes touched <b>down</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> {{southeast}} {{and the eastern}} Ohio Valley from central Ohio to North Carolina {{but the bulk of}} the activity took place across central and southern Georgia where nearly 20 tornadoes were confirmed in that state alone. One tornado went through the city of Macon, Georgia, causing extensive damage to some buildings at Macon State College. This forced the closure of the Macon campus for repair. A violent EF4 was also confirmed near Darien in McIntosh County where numerous buildings near Interstate 95 were heavily damaged or destroyed. This was the first violent tornado in Georgia since an F4 hit four counties north of Atlanta on March 27, 1994. The tornado that occurred during the Palm Sunday tornado outbreak of 1994 killed three and injured 20 over a nearly 50-mile path. Georgia Governor Sonny Perdue {{declared a state of emergency}} for at least six counties across the state. In addition to the tornado fatalities, one person was killed due to straight line winds in Barrow County, Georgia.|$|E
500|$|On May2, {{a strong}} area of low {{pressure}} {{moved out of}} the Rocky Mountains and into the High Plains, producing scattered severe weather and ten tornadoes in Nebraska. The following day, atmospheric conditions across Oklahoma became significantly more favorable for an outbreak of severe weather. Wind profiles across the region strongly favored tornadic activity, with the Storm Prediction Center stating, [...] "it became more obvious something major was looming" [...] by the afternoon hours. Numerous supercell thunderstorms developed across the state as well as bordering areas in Kansas and Texas. Over the following 48hours, May3–4, 116tornadoes touched <b>down</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Central United States. Following the extensive outbreak, activity became increasingly scattered from May5 to 8, with 26tornadoes touching <b>down</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Eastern United States and Quebec.|$|E
500|$|Winds gusted {{as high as}} [...] at Sea Rim State Park as Frances lashed the coast. [...] The lowest {{pressure}} {{reported from}} a land station was [...] at Rockport, Texas. [...] Three tornadoes touched <b>down</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Lone Star State, at Caney Creek, La Porte, and Galveston. [...] A major disaster declaration was issued for Brazoria, Galveston, and Harris counties.|$|E
500|$|In Bermuda, Arlene {{produced}} {{winds up}} to 85mph (140km/h) and a pressure of 974.5mbar (hPa; 28.78inHg) was recorded during its passage. A maximum gust of 98mph (158km/h) was recorded at Kindley Air Force Base. Tree limbs and power lines were <b>downed</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> island, {{a few small}} boats sank in rough seas and flooding was reported in some areas. The hurricane produced {{one of the highest}} tropical cyclone-related rainfall totals on the island, peaking at , in addition to an estimated [...] storm surge. In all, damage in Bermuda amounted to $300,000 (1963USD; $2.1million 2009USD).|$|R
50|$|Located at {{the western}} edge of the Vale of Pewsey (part of the North Wessex Downs AONB), it is also the highest summit along a 50 km ridge {{extending}} all the way from <b>the</b> South <b>Downs,</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> southern Chilterns and into Wiltshire. Milk Hill is the second highest point between Bristol and London after Walbury Hill in West Berkshire (297 m / 974 ft.), and is thus also the second highest chalk hill in the UK, again behind Walbury Hill, though it has a slightly greater prominence.|$|R
50|$|Slowly {{moving through}} the Ryukyu Islands for several days, Haikui brought a {{prolonged}} period of heavy rain and high winds to several islands. On Okinawa, sustained winds peaked at 72 km/h and gusts were recorded up to 122 km/h. Rainfall amounted to about 9 in, bringing several dams to full or near-full capacity. No reports of major damage were received on Okinawa, though numerous tree limbs were <b>downed</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> island. A total of 353 flights to and from Naha International Airport were canceled, affecting more than 70,000 passengers.|$|R
500|$|The stern section {{seems to}} have descended almost vertically, {{probably}} rotating as it fell. Empty tanks and cofferdams imploded as it descended, tearing open the structure and folding back the steel ribbing of the poop deck. The section landed {{with such force that}} it buried itself about [...] deep at the rudder. The decks pancaked down {{on top of each other}} and the hull plating splayed out to the sides. Debris continued to rain <b>down</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> seabed for several hours after the sinking.|$|E
500|$|Roger Penske {{was one of}} {{the main}} advocates of the series {{returning}} to Detroit, and his company provided $6 million to improve the course on Belle Isle Park. Over [...] of concrete was laid <b>down</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> paddock and the race course, and the lighting and drainage were both repaired in the lead up to the event. The race was scheduled for the weekend after the Indianapolis 500, a slot that had previously been held by the Firestone 550 at the Texas Motor Speedway. The move created tension with Eddie Gossage, the track director in Texas.|$|E
500|$|Crillon {{closed up}} {{the town and}} {{prepared}} for action. The Prussians unlimbered their artillery and fired on the town gates; Mayr's men and the Prussian grenadiers knocked out the obstructions. A few precise hits cleared {{their way into the}} town and the Allied resistance disappeared in cannon smoke; the Allied troops rapidly withdrew from the town across the bridge over the Saale and, as they withdrew, they set fire to the bridge to prevent the Prussians from following them. [...] A conflagration consumed the wooden bridge so rapidly that 630 men, most of the garrison, were trapped on the wrong side. They surrendered with their arms and equipment. Saxe-Hildburghausen, at Burgwerben, ordered a barrage laid <b>down</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Saale to prevent the Prussians from repairing the bridge. Frederick's gunners responded in kind and the two shelled each other until about 3:00 pm.|$|E

500|$|Fearing {{a repeat}} of the damage left by Hurricane Ignacio a month earlier, many {{residents}} stocked up on supplies, secured their homes and evacuated to emergency shelters. The government of Mexico issued hurricane warnings for areas of the eastern coast of the Baja California Peninsula and the west coast of the mainland on September 21. Tropical storm warnings were issued for the Mexican coastline to the Colorado River on September 23, but were discontinued later that day. Forecasters also predicted that the hurricane might cause 4 [...] 6feet (1.2 [...] 1.8m) of storm surge, 8inches (20.3cm) of rain, serious flash flooding, and mudslides. Many schools and tourist destinations were used as emergency shelters and most seaports and airports were closed <b>down.</b> <b>Across</b> <b>the</b> Gulf of California, in the state of Sonora, authorities of the municipality of Empalme monitored the status of the Punta de Agua dam, located 20mi (30km) upstream of the municipal seat, which threatened to overtop and flood the city. As a result, 300 residents were evacuated to shelters on higher ground.|$|E
500|$|San Lorenzo Colossal Head4 (also {{known as}} San Lorenzo Monument4) weighs 6 tons {{and has been}} moved to the Museo de Antropología de Xalapa. Colossal Head4 is [...] high, [...] wide and [...] deep. The head was {{discovered}} by Matthew Stirling in 1946, [...] northwest of the principal mound, {{at the edge of}} a gully. When excavated, it was found to be lying on its right-hand side and in a very good state of preservation. Ceramic materials excavated with the head became mixed with ceramics associated with Head5, making ceramic dating of the monument difficult. The headdress is decorated with a horizontal band formed of four sculpted cords, similar to those of Head3. On the right-hand side, three tassels descend from the upper portion of the headdress; they terminate in a total of eight strips that hang <b>down</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> horizontal band. These tassels are judged to represent hair rather than cords. Also on the right hand side, two cords descend across the ear and continue to the base of the monument. On the left-hand side, three vertical cords descend across the ear. The earflare is only visible on the right hand side; it is formed of a plain disc and peg. The face is that of an ageing man with a creased forehead, low cheekbones and a prominent chin. The lips are thick and slightly parted.|$|E
500|$|On Kauai, the Hanalei River {{rose above}} its normal level, {{leading to the}} closure of the Hanalei School. Several tree limbs and small trees were blown <b>down</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> island. Rainfall on Kauai peaked at [...] at Mount Wai'ale'ale and on Maui, up to [...] fell in Kaupo Gap. On the leeward side of the mountains, {{rainfall}} peaked at [...] in Kihei, an area that rarely records rainfall in August. Throughout the island, the total amount of water in reservoirs increased to 104.5million gallons (395.5million liters) from 77.8million gallons (294.5million liters) prior to Felicia. Rainfall in some areas was heavy enough at times to reduce visibility to several feet. Streets in these areas were covered with muddy water. Localized heavy rainfall fell on the Big Island, peaking at [...] in Kealakekua. In Wailua Beach, there was one lifeguard rescue that resulted in the swimmer being sent to a local hospital. Three other people were swept away {{at the mouth of the}} Wailua River, all of whom were quickly rescued. In Honolulu, runoff from the storm resulted in large amounts of trash and debris along the local beaches. Private contractors were dispatched to the affected coastlines to trap and remove the trash. Officials were forced to close the beaches along Hanauma Bay after swells from Felicia pushed an estimated 2,000 Portuguese Man o' War siphonophorae into the region. The beaches were later re-opened on August14.|$|E
