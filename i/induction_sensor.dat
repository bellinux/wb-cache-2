40|$|We have {{developed}} and tested code to optimise electromagnetic (EM) sensors {{to improve performance}} of the ARMIT B field <b>induction</b> coil <b>sensor</b> at desired frequencies. We aim to use the optimised parameters to develop a compact air core transmitter, which will {{form the basis for}} developing a compact ferromagnetic core transmitter. Techniques for optimising <b>induction</b> coil <b>sensors</b> are well established in literature and use analytical equations for the objective and constraint functions. Alternatives for EM sensor design are also well documented. In contrast, the design of compact transmitter systems needed for portability or in boreholes have limited discussion in the literature and have many more design constraints than sensors. Our ultimate intention is to use established sensor optimisation techniques to build a compact transmitter with sufficient magnetic dipole moment. To optimise an ARMIT <b>induction</b> current <b>sensor</b> we develop the algebraic expression for the total internal sensor noise to use as a constraint function. The objective function is the weight of the sensor. We aim to achieve noise goals of v / and v / frequencies of 1 Hz and 2 kHz, respectively. 1 Hz was chosen because that is a common base-frequency for conductive sulphide exploration and 2 kHz was chosen as being appropriate for nuclear magnetic resonance investigations. We use numerical non-linear constraint optimization techniques to predict a target noise level of 1 pT at 1 Hz., At this stage we predict the best 2 kHz sensor to have 4 fT noise at 2 kHz. This was based on existing dimensional and weight constraints on the <b>induction</b> coil <b>sensor.</b> We introduce an analogous method of transmitter optimisation using transmitter dipole moment as the objective function...|$|R

40|$|In Flanders, {{the risk}} of {{destruction}} of archaeologically valuable sites is high due to the intensive building activity. The aim of archaeological prospection is to estimate the archaeological value of a terrain without complete excavation. For this purpose, earth sciences are increasingly adopted to reconstruct the paleo-environment and to increase the archaeological evidence. An important geoarchaeological prospection method is geophysical prospection, where sensors are used to map the natural soil variability and to detect anthropogenic traces without disturbing the soil. The three most applied sensor types for archaeological prospection are the magnetometer, the electrical resistivity meter and the ground penetrating radar. A fourth type, based on electromagnetic induction is less often used, despite its apparent advantages. It can measure two physical properties simultaneously, the electrical conductivity and the magnetic susceptibility. The instrument does not require soil contact and is therefore easily mounted on a motorized platform. Recently, new sensors were developed with multiple receiver coils, each having a specific spatial sensitivity. The potential of these sensors for archaeology was not evaluated until now. The goal of this doctoral research was to test the use of electromagnetic <b>induction</b> <b>sensors</b> for geoarchaeological prospection. First, a motorized sensor platform was developed to measure large areas per day in a high resolution, so that apart from the archaeological site, also its broader context can be mapped. Computer software was written {{to be able to}} process the data and to correct errors such as time drift. Second, the sensitivity of the sensor configurations was tested on an experimental site where structures of known dimensions and physical properties were buried. The results proofed that the coil configuration of the sensor has a large impact on the detection level. Third, the electrical and magnetic response of the electromagnetic <b>induction</b> <b>sensors</b> were compared with magnetometer and electrical resistivity sensors. Finally, the sensors were evaluated on different sites with Medieval or Bronze Age traces in varying environmental settings and with field verification by auger observations...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} glacial period (Weichselian), wind-blown loess was {{deposited}} over the undulating landscape of central Belgium, {{which had been}} formed in surfacing Tertiary marine sediments. Since valleys were covered with a thicker loess layer than were elevated areas, the present topography is much flatter. Reconstructing the palaeolandscape at a detailed scale is almost impossible by conventional procedures based on soil augering. Therefore, {{the use of the}} EM 38 DD electromagnetic <b>induction</b> <b>sensor</b> was evaluated as an alternative for mapping the depth to the Tertiary clay substrate. On our 2 -ha study site, strong non-linear relationships (R- 2 = 0. 85) were found between the apparent electrical conductivities (ECa) measured by the vertical orientation of the EM 38 DD and the depth to the Tertiary clay (z(clay)) {{on the one hand and}} between the combination of the EC(a) s measured by the vertical and horizontal orientations of the EM 38 DD and z(clay) on the other hand. These predictions were validated by independent observations of the depth to the Tertiary clay, and r values of 0. 84 (using only the measurements in the vertical orientation) and 0. 85 (using both measurements in the vertical and horizontal orientations), with an average error of 0. 26 m, were found. Our dense ECa measurements (2 m x 2 m resolution) allowed us to build a three-dimensional surface of the depth to the Tertiary substrate, reconstructing the palaeotopography beneath the loess cover and revealing distinct erosion patterns. The continuity of these was confirmed by an analysis of surface flow patterns on the reconstructed palaeotopography. The non-invasive, quick, and cost-effective electromagnetic <b>induction</b> <b>sensor</b> offers new possibilities in reconstructing and analysing the Quaternary palaeotopography beneath the loess cover...|$|E

A distinct change of the induction voltage is observed around the resonance frequency of the vortex core.
