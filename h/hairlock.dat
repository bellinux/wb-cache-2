5000|$|A dinosaur {{skeleton}} is {{stolen from}} the [...] "Museum of Unnatural History" [...] so <b>Hairlock</b> Combs (a parody of Sherlock Holmes) and his assistant Dr. Gotsum disguise themselves as a horse and visit {{the scene of the}} crime. It is ultimately revealed that the thief is a concert xylophonist who is obsessed with using the skeleton as his instrument. Throughout the film, he repeats the phrase, [...] "The best bones of all go to Symphony Hall!" ...|$|E
40|$|Shah-Waardenburg {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} congenital disorder with variable clinical expression, characterised by aganglionosis of the rectosigmoid (Hirschsprung disease), and abnormal melanocyte migration, resulting in pigmentary abnormalities and sensorineural deafness (Waardenburg syndrome). Mutations in the EDN, EDNRB and SOX 10 genes {{can be found in}} patients with this syndrome. SOX 10 mutations are specifically associated with a more severe phenotype called PCWH: peripheral demyelinating neuropathy, central dysmyelinating leukodystrophy, Waardenburg syndrome, and Hirschsprung disease. Neuronal expression of SOX 10 occurs in neural crest cells during early embryonic development and in glial cells of the peripheral and central nervous systems during late embryonic development and in adults. We present a 4 -year-old girl with the PCWH phenotype associated with a de novo nonsense mutation (S 384 X) in SOX 10. Main clinical features were mental retardation, peripheral neuropathy, deafness, Hirschsprung disease, distal arthrogryposis, white <b>hairlock,</b> and growth retardation. She presented with hypotonia, developmental delay, reduced peripheral nerve conduction velocities, and radiologically assessed central hypomyelination. Subsequently, the formation of abnormal myelin within the central and peripheral nervous system was functionally and radiologically assessed. Children presenting with features of Waardenburg syndrome and neurological dysfunction should be tested for mutations in the SOX 10 gene to enable diagnosis and counselling.

2500|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} (e.g., Campbell 1985) that the first Rasta locks were copied from Kenya in 1953, when images of the independence struggle of the feared Mau Mau insurgents, who grew their [...] "dreaded locks" [...] while hiding in the mountains, appeared in newsreels and other publications that reached Jamaica. However, a more recent study by Barry Chevannes has traced the first <b>hairlocked</b> Rastas to a subgroup first appearing in 1949, known as Youth Black Faith.|$|R
5000|$|Koyomi's {{cousin and}} the Chairman of Hiragi Academy's main branch. She runs her {{school as a}} prison where the {{students}} are forced to compete against each other with the least ranked ones suffering severe prejudice from their higher ranked peers and suffering risk of being expelled. Bent on stopping Alice's tyranny, Jun'ichirō bets his own freedom to challenge her, and she agrees to relinquish her post of chairman to him should he win. With this purpose, Jun'ichirō transfers to her school along with a team composed of Suzune, Makina, Sachiko, Kōtarō and Nanami {{with the task of}} defeating all other students and assimilate their groups in a period of three months. Jun'ichirō nicknames her as [...] "Brioche Rolls", as her <b>hairlocks</b> look like such to him. Once Jun'ichirō wins the bet, she refuses to give up, and he allows her to remain the chairman with the condition of {{looking for a way to}} make the school a fun place for everyone, promising to have a rematch against her once she does it.|$|R
