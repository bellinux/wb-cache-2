500|$|Johansson {{attended}} PS 41, {{an elementary}} school in Greenwich Village, Manhattan. Growing up, her family {{did not have much}} money. Her parents divorced when she was 13. Johansson was particularly close to her maternal grandmother, Dorothy Sloan, a bookkeeper and schoolteacher; they often spent time together and Johansson considered Sloan her best friend. Interested in a career in the spotlight from an early age, Johansson often put on song-and-dance routines for her family. She was particularly fond of musical theater and jazz hands. She took lessons in tap dance, and states that her parents were supportive of her career choice. Describing her childhood, she says it [...] "was filled with things that I loved to do, and also very normal things: I lived in New York, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> life and went to a regular school." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{tour was}} chronicled in the {{documentary}} titled I'm Going to Tell You a Secret. Originally called The Re-Invented Process {{in reference to the}} tour and the exhibition X-STaTIC Pro=CeSS, the documentary was filmed during Madonna's visit to North America and Europe from May 24 to September 14, 2004.

The documentary emerged from Madonna's urge to show her artistic side on the tour and her devotion towards the Jewish mysticism Kabbalah. Unlike her 1991 documentary, , which portrayed Hollywood glamour, I'm Going to Tell You a Secret clarified from its beginning that it was about the singer's views on life and spirituality. [...] "It's a different me, I have a husband, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>family,</b> my whole life has changed. It would be pretty strange if I was behaving the same way I did 12 years ago— that would be a little freaky. No more Evian bottles!", Madonna told MTV, with the last bit referring to a scene of her performing fellatio on an Evian bottle in Truth or Dare.|$|E
2500|$|... "Also, I have a {{different}} vision of life. It has been almost 15 years. I am now a 40-year-old woman. I left home when I was young. But <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> who have sacrificed everything for me, and I would like to pay them back somehow. And more than that, I have a child, a 15-month-old son {{and he is a}} child I would like to be close to, like any mother. I would like to bring up my son to be a good man. That is now my objective." ...|$|E

5000|$|I did {{not speak}} my first Ojibwa word or set foot on my {{traditional}} territory until I was twenty-six.

2500|$|In an {{interview}} in October 2001, Mundine said of the 11 September terrorist attacks, [...] "They call it an act of terrorism, {{but if you can}} understand religion, and our way of life, it’s not about terrorism. It’s about fighting for God’s law, and America’s brought it upon themselves". Offering some insight into his tendency to make controversial comments in the media, Mundine stated that [...] "If you want to toe the line, {{if you want to be}} some corporate guy and say the right things, do the right things, you might be okay in the media's eye, but it won't be real for me." [...] Mundine later claimed he was taken out of context stating: [...] "Those comments were just spun around like I was clapping my hands. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> too, I know what it is like to suffer the loss of someone close to me, and I would never wish that upon anyone. The point I was trying to get across was that it was in a war state of mind, and there is always going to be tit for tat, so why put yourself in a situation where you can endanger people. I have got nothing against any American, I have got nothing against any human being. It breaks my heart that people think I would even have that line of thought about being happy about people dying. That is crap and I want to clarify that because it is wrong." ...|$|E

But she couldn't, for the life of her, tell my name or who I was. So I told her I was her boy.|$|R

Even to produce the MS. of this will occupy me, at the most favourable opinion, till the middle of next year; really five years were wanting, when I could have made a book; but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>family,</b> and - perhaps I could not make the book after all.|$|E
6000|$|Killy laughed. It was {{a shrill}} laugh. [...] "I should say not," [...] said he. [...] "I eat spiders and worms {{and all sorts}} of insects big enough to give a fellow a decent bite. But for real good eating give me a fat Meadow Mouse. I don't object to a Sparrow or some other small bird now and then, {{especially}} when <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> of hungry youngsters to feed. But take it the season through, I live mostly on grasshoppers and insects and Meadow Mice. I do a lot of good in this world, I'd have you know." ...|$|E
2500|$|Alderman {{says he was}} {{motivated}} by financial conditions after being left off the contract list of Australian players in 1984. [...] "The board was; not thinking of me for the future.! I was 28 and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> to think of, The {{opportunity to go to}} South Africa and to get a nest egg came up. It pointed out to me the lack of security you have when you play this, game. 'It's so fickle: one minute you are up,'the next you are down." ...|$|R
5000|$|Attempting {{to explain}} his prodigious directorial output, Douglas told Bertrand Tavernier: <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> large <b>family</b> to feed, and it's only {{occasionally}} that I find a story that interests me." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No, Mr. Mason. I don't {{think it}} will be better that I should go to them. I know Round and Crook well, and don't mean to say a word against them; but if I go any farther into this affair I must do it with the principal. I am not going to cut my own throat for the sake of mending any man's little finger. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> of sixteen children, Mr. Mason, and I have to look about very sharp,--very sharp indeed." [...] Then there was another pause, and Mr. Dockwrath began to {{perceive}} that Mr. Mason was not by nature an open, demonstrative, or communicative man. If anything further was to be done, he himself must open out a little. [...] "The fact is, Mr. Mason, that I have come across documents which you should have had at that trial. Round and Crook ought to have had them, only they weren't half sharp. Why, sir, Mr. Usbech had been your father's man of business for years upon years, and yet they didn't half go through his papers. They turned 'em over and looked at 'em; but never thought of seeing what little facts might be proved." ...|$|E
6000|$|One thing embarrasses me. No {{one ever}} seems to {{understand}} my attitude about that book; the stuff sent {{was never meant}} for other than a first state; I never meant it to appear as a book. Knowing well that I have never had one hour of inspiration since it was begun, and have only beaten out my metal by brute force and patient repetition, I hoped some day to get a [...] "spate of style" [...] and burnish it--fine mixed metaphor. I am now so sick that I intend, when the Letters are done and some more written that will be wanted, simply to make a book of it by the pruning-knife. I cannot fight longer; I am sensible of having done worse than I hoped, worse than I feared; all I can do now is {{to do the best}} I can for the future, and clear the book, like a piece of bush, with axe and cutlass.

60|$|The first {{consideration}} was {{of great}} moment to me. My trade was a saddler, and as my dealings were chiefly {{not by a}} shop or chance trade, but among the merchants trading to the English colonies in America, so my effects lay {{very much in the}} hands of such. I was a single man, it is true; but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> of servants, who[22] I kept at my business; <b>had</b> <b>a</b> house, shop, and warehouses filled with goods; and in short to leave them all as things in such a case must be left, that is to say, without any overseer or person fit to be trusted with them, had been to hazard the loss, not only of my trade, but of my goods, and indeed of all <b>I</b> <b>had</b> in the world.|$|R

5000|$|In 2011, Kurt Vile's fourth studio album, Smoke Ring for My Halo, was {{met with}} {{critical}} acclaim and its release significantly expanded his fan base. Reflecting on the extensive touring schedule which accompanied the album, Vile noted, [...] "Things were going good and people were coming to our shows, which is nice, but it's also draining. And <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>family,</b> so {{there are all kinds}} of psychological things weighing you down. So it's not like a cushy lifestyle — there's struggle and urgency in there in its own right. Ultimately you want some kind of struggle." [...] Vile began writing tracks for his fifth studio album whilst on tour, practicing them during soundchecks: [...] "The record was written all over the place, on tour," [...] Vile elaborated [...] "I was playing more gigs and more soundchecks and I was creating these sort of more epic tunes." ...|$|E
