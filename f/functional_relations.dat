25|$|In {{examining}} living organisms, biologists {{are confronted}} with diverse levels of complexity (e.g. chemical, physiological, psychological, social). They therefore investigate causal and <b>functional</b> <b>relations</b> within and between these levels. A biochemist might examine, for instance, the influence of social and ecological conditions on the release of certain neurotransmitters and hormones, {{and the effects of}} such releases on behaviour, e.g. stress during birth has a tocolytic (contraction-suppressing) effect.|$|E
25|$|In {{some cases}} the complex {{interactions}} between inhibitory and excitatory neurons can be simplified using mean field theory, which {{gives rise to the}} population model of neural networks. While many neurotheorists prefer such models with reduced complexity, others argue that uncovering structural <b>functional</b> <b>relations</b> depends on including as much neuronal and network structure as possible. Models of this type are typically built in large simulation platforms like GENESIS or NEURON. There have been some attempts to provide unified methods that bridge and integrate these levels of complexity.|$|E

Drawing from postmodern schools of thought, postcolonial studies analyze the politics of knowledge (creation, control, and distribution) by examining the <b>functional</b> <b>relations</b> {{of social and political}} power that sustain colonialism and neocolonialism—the imperial regime's depictions (social, political, cultural) of the colonizer and of the colonized.|$|E
30|$|Various generalizations of the Hurwitz-Lerch zeta {{function}} {{have been}} actively investigated by many authors. Very recently, Srivastava presented a systematic investigation of numerous interesting properties of some families of generating functions and their partial sums which {{are associated with}} various classes of the extended Hurwitz-Lerch zeta functions. In this paper, firstly, we show that by using the Poisson summation formula, the analytic continuation of the Lerch zeta function can be explained and the <b>functional</b> <b>relation</b> for the Lerch zeta function can be obtained in a very elementary way. Secondly, we present another <b>functional</b> <b>relation</b> for the Lerch zeta function and derive the well-known <b>functional</b> <b>relation</b> for the Hurwitz zeta function from our formula by following the lines of Apostol’s argument.|$|R

500|$|A {{prevalent}} {{idea in the}} 18th {{and early}} 19th centuries was that illness {{was a result of}} the condition of the whole body. [...] The environment and the activity of the patient thus played a large part in any treatment. [...] The epitome of this kind of thinking was the concept of the vital force, which was supposed to govern the chemical processes within the body. [...] This theory held that organic compounds could only be formed within living organisms, where the vital force could come into play. [...] This belief had been known to be false ever since Friedrich Wöhler succeeded in synthesising urea from inorganic precursors in 1828. [...] Nevertheless, the vital force continued to be invoked to explain organic chemistry in Bird's time. [...] Sometime {{in the middle of the}} 19th century, a new way of thinking started to take shape, especially among younger physicians, fuelled by rapid advances in the understanding of chemistry. [...] For the first time, it became possible to identify specific chemical reactions with specific organs of the body, and to trace their effects through the various <b>functional</b> <b>relations</b> of the organs and the exchanges between them.Vinten-Johansen, pp. 85–86 ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{investigate}} the thermodynamic properties of conformal gravity in four dimensions. We compute the area(or entropy) <b>functional</b> <b>relation</b> for this black hole. We consider both de-Sitter (dS) and anti de-Sitter (AdS) cases. We derive the Cosmic-Censorship-Inequality {{which is an}} important relation in general relativity that relates the total mass of a spacetime {{to the area of}} all the black hole horizons. Local thermodynamic stability is studied by computing the specific heat. The second order phase transition occurs at a certain condition. Various type of second order phase structure has been given for various values of a and the cosmological constant Λ in the Appendix. When a= 0, one obtains the result of Schwarzschild-dS and Schwarzschild-AdS cases. In the limit aM<< 1, one obtains the result of Grumiller space-time. Where a is non-trivial Rindler parameter or Rindler acceleration and M is the mass parameter. The thermodynamic volume <b>functional</b> <b>relation</b> is derived in the extended phase space, where the cosmological constant treated as a thermodynamic pressure and its conjugate variable as a thermodynamic volume.

60|$|We may now sum up our {{discussion}} of causality. We found first that the law of causality, as usually stated by philosophers, is false, and is not employed in science. We then considered the nature of scientific laws, and found that, instead of stating that one event A is always followed by another event B, they stated <b>functional</b> <b>relations</b> between certain events at certain times, which we called determinants, and other events at earlier or later times or at the same time. We were unable to find any a priori category involved: the existence of scientific laws appeared as a purely empirical fact, not necessarily universal, except in a trivial and scientifically useless form. We found that a system with one set of determinants may very likely have other sets of a quite different kind, that, for example, a mechanically determined system may also be teleologically or volitionally determined. Finally we considered the problem of free will: here {{we found that the}} reasons for supposing volitions to be determined are strong but not conclusive, and we decided that even if volitions are mechanically determined, that is no reason for denying freedom in the sense revealed by introspection, or for supposing that mechanical events are not determined by volitions. The problem of free will versus determinism is therefore, if we were right, mainly illusory, but in part not yet capable of being decisively solved.|$|E
60|$|Sexual Selection.--Inasmuch as peculiarities {{often appear}} under {{domestication}} in one sex and become hereditarily attached to that sex, the same fact probably occurs under nature, and if so, natural selection {{will be able}} to modify one sex in its <b>functional</b> <b>relations</b> to the other sex, or in relation to wholly different habits of life in the two sexes, as is sometimes the case {88} with insects. And this leads me {{to say a few words}} on what I call Sexual Selection. This depends, not on a struggle for existence, but on a struggle between the males for possession of the females; the result is not death to the unsuccessful competitor, but few or no offspring. Sexual selection is, therefore, less rigorous than natural selection. Generally, the most vigorous males, those which are best fitted for their places in nature, will leave most progeny. But in many cases, victory depends not on general vigour, but on having special weapons, confined to the male sex. A hornless stag or spurless cock would have a poor chance of leaving offspring. Sexual selection by always allowing the victor to breed might surely give indomitable courage, length to the spur, and strength to the wing to strike in the spurred leg, as well as the brutal cock-fighter, who knows well that he can improve his breed by careful selection of the best cocks. How low in the scale of nature the law of battle descends, I know not; male alligators have been described as fighting, bellowing, and whirling round, like Indians in a war-dance, for the possession of the females; male salmons have been seen fighting all day long; male stag-beetles often bear wounds from the huge mandibles of other males. The war is, perhaps, severest between the males of polygamous animals, and these seem oftenest provided with special weapons. The males of carnivorous animals are already well armed; though to them and to others, special means of defence may be given through means of sexual selection, as the mane to the lion, the shoulder-pad to the boar, and the hooked jaw to the male salmon; for the shield may be as important for victory, as the sword or spear.|$|E
