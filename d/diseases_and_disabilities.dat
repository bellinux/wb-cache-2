2500|$|The theory {{holds that}} {{the human body is}} filled with four basic substances, called humors, which are in balance when a person is healthy. <b>Diseases</b> <b>and</b> <b>disabilities</b> {{supposedly}} resulted from an excess or deficit of one of these four humors. Disease could also be the result of the [...] "corruption" [...] of {{one or more of the}} humors, which could be caused by environmental circumstances, dietary changes, or many other factors. These deficits were thought to be caused by vapors inhaled or absorbed by the body. The four humors are black bile, yellow bile, phlegm, and blood. These terms only partly correspond to the modern medical terminology, in which there is no distinction between black and yellow bile, and in which phlegm has a very different meaning. These [...] "humors" [...] may have their roots in the appearance of a blood sedimentation test made in open air, which exhibits a dark clot at the bottom ("black bile"), a layer of unclotted erythrocytes ("blood"), a layer of white blood cells ("phlegm") and a layer of clear yellow serum ("yellow bile"). It was believed that these were the basic substances from which all liquids in the body were made.|$|E

40|$|Aim: To {{describe}} the Dynamic Analyses to Optimise Ageing (DYNOPTA) project and illustrate its contributions to understanding ageing through innovative methodology, and investigations on outcomes {{based on the}} project themes. DYNOPTA provides a platform and technical expertise {{that may be used}} to combine other national and international datasets. Methods: The DYNOPTA project has pooled and harmonised data from nine Australian longitudinal studies to create the largest available longitudinal dataset (n= 50652) on ageing in Australia. Results: A range of findings have resulted from the study to date, including methodological advances, prevalence rates of <b>disease</b> <b>and</b> <b>disability,</b> <b>and</b> mapping trajectories of ageing with and without increasing morbidity. DYNOPTA also forms the basis of a microsimulation model that will provide projections of future costs of <b>disease</b> <b>and</b> <b>disability</b> for the baby boomer cohort. Conclusion: DYNOPTA contributes significantly to the Australian evidence base on ageing to inform key social and health policy domains...|$|R

Third, we propose general characteristics of useful measures of the public’s health.

5000|$|Geriatrics or {{geriatric}} {{medicine is}} a specialty {{that focuses on}} health care of elderly people. It aims to promote health by preventing and treating <b>diseases</b> <b>and</b> <b>disabilities</b> in older adults. There is no set age at which patients may be {{under the care of}} a geriatrician or geriatric physician, a physician who specializes in the care of elderly people. Rather, this decision is determined by the individual patient's needs, and the availability of a specialist. It is important to note the difference between geriatrics, the care of aged people, and gerontology, which is the study of the aging process itself. The term geriatrics comes from the Greek γέρων geron meaning [...] "old man", and ιατρός iatros meaning [...] "healer". However, geriatrics is sometimes called medical gerontology.|$|E

5000|$|Founded in 1986, the Ray Charles Foundation {{maintains}} the mission statement of financially supporting institutions and {{organizations in the}} research of hearing disorders. Originally known as [...] "The Robinson Foundation for Hearing Disorders", it was renamed in 2006, and has since provided financial donations to numerous institutions involved in hearing loss research and education.

The organization's philanthropic views stem from Charles' own views on giving, as the musician often contributed cochlear implant donations to those who could not afford the procedure. Charles was recorded as saying that the reason he has given so much more time and money to the hearing impaired, rather than the visually impaired, was that music saved his life, and he wouldn't know what to do if he couldn't experience it.|$|E
