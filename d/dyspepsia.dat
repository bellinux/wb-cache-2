5|$|Colonization with H. pylori is not {{a disease}} in and of itself, but a {{condition}} associated {{with a number of}} disorders of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Testing for H. pylori is recommended if peptic ulcer disease or low-grade gastric MALT lymphoma is present, after endoscopic resection of early gastric cancer, first-degree relatives with gastric cancer, and in certain cases of <b>dyspepsia,</b> not routinely. Several ways of testing exist. One can test noninvasively for H. pylori infection with a blood antibody test, stool antigen test, or with the carbon urea breath test (in which the patient drinks 14C—or 13C-labelled urea, which the bacterium metabolizes, producing labelled carbon dioxide that can be detected in the breath). Also, a urine ELISA test with a 96% sensitivity and 79% specificity is available. None of the test methods is completely failsafe. Even biopsy is dependent on the location of the biopsy. Blood antibody tests, for example, range from 76% to 84% sensitivity. Some drugs can affect H. pylori urease activity and give false negatives with the urea-based tests. The most accurate method for detecting H. pylori infection is with a histological examination from two sites after endoscopic biopsy, combined with either a rapid urease test or microbial culture.|$|E

25|$|Esomeprazole {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Nexium (or Nexum) among others, is a proton-pump {{inhibitor}} which reduces stomach acid. It {{is used in the}} treatment of <b>dyspepsia,</b> peptic ulcer disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs) {{are effective}} in relieving the pain of primary dysmenorrhea. They can have side effects of nausea, <b>dyspepsia,</b> peptic ulcer, and diarrhea. People {{who are unable to}} take the more common NSAIDs may be prescribed a COX-2 inhibitor.|$|E
25|$|Anti-inflammatory {{medication}} like NSAIDs {{may also}} be used. NSAIDs are the first-line medications in ovulatory menorrhagia, resulting in an average reduction of 20-46% in menstrual blood flow. For this purpose, NSAIDs are ingested for only 5 days of the menstrual cycle, limiting their most common adverse effect of <b>dyspepsia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Alexithymia is {{correlated}} with certain personality disorders, substance use disorders, some anxiety disorders, and sexual disorders, {{as well as}} certain physical illnesses, such as hypertension, inflammatory bowel disease, and functional <b>dyspepsia.</b> Alexithymia is further linked with disorders such as migraine headaches, lower back pain, irritable bowel syndrome, asthma, nausea, allergies, and fibromyalgia.|$|E
25|$|The {{next most}} {{commonly}} reported {{adverse effects of}} taking misoprostol by mouth {{for the prevention of}} gastric ulcers are: abdominal pain, nausea, flatulence, headache, <b>dyspepsia,</b> vomiting, and constipation, but none of these adverse effects occurred more often than when taking placebos. In practice, fever is almost universal when multiple doses are given every 4 to 6 hours.|$|E
25|$|Fentanyl's {{most common}} side effects (more than 10% of patients) include diarrhoea, nausea, constipation, dry mouth, somnolence, confusion, {{asthenia}} (weakness), sweating, and less frequently (3 to 10 % of patients) abdominal pain, headache, fatigue, anorexia and weight loss, dizziness, nervousness, hallucinations, anxiety, depression, flu-like symptoms, <b>dyspepsia</b> (indigestion), dyspnoea (shortness of breath), hypoventilation, apnoea, and urinary retention. Fentanyl use {{has also been}} associated with aphasia.|$|E
25|$|A {{peculiar}} {{outbreak of}} Nyctalopia or night-blindness affected {{many of the}} prisoners in 1806. They became severely dyspeptic and completely blind from sunset until dawn, {{to the extent that}} their fitter companions had to lead them around the camp. Various treatments were tried and failed; finally they were cured with black hellebore, given as snuff, which relieved the <b>dyspepsia</b> and restored their night vision within a few days.|$|E
25|$|Problems of {{gastrointestinal}} function {{are usually}} not well diagnosed by endoscopy since motion or secretion of the gastrointestinal tract are not easily inspected by EGD. Nonetheless, findings such as excess fluid or poor motion of the gut during endoscopy can be suggestive of disorders of function. Irritable bowel syndrome and functional <b>dyspepsia</b> are not diagnosed with EGD, but EGD may be helpful in excluding other diseases that mimic these common disorders.|$|E
25|$|To {{reduce the}} {{possibility}} of peptic ulcers, indometacin should be prescribed at the lowest dosage needed to achieve a therapeutic effect, usually between 50–200mg/day. It should always be taken with food. Nearly all patients benefit from an ulcer protective drug (e.g. highly dosed antacids, ranitidine 150mg at bedtime, or omeprazole 20mg at bedtime). Other common gastrointestinal complaints, including <b>dyspepsia,</b> heartburn and mild diarrhea are less serious and rarely require discontinuation of indometacin.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} adverse effects are {{flushing}} (e.g., warmth, redness, itching or tingling), headache, pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, <b>dyspepsia,</b> nausea, vomiting, rhinitis, pruritus and rash. These can be minimized by initiating therapy at low dosages, increasing dosage gradually, and avoiding administration {{on an empty}} stomach. High doses of niacin often temporarily reduce blood pressure {{as a result of}} acute vasodilation. In the longer term, high-dose niacin use may persistently lower blood pressure in individuals with hypertension, but {{more research is needed to}} determine the extent of this effect.|$|E
25|$|The Pharmacopeé of Lyons, {{published}} in 1786, says that cedar tree oil can induce vomiting, and suggests it helps medicate tumors and ulcers. Physicians contemporary {{to the discovery}} of creosote recommended ointments and pills made from tar or pitch to treat skin diseases. Tar water had been used as a folk remedy since the Middle Ages to treat affections like <b>dyspepsia.</b> Bishop Berkeley wrote several works on the medical virtues of tar water, including a philosophical work in 1744 titled Siris: a chain of philosophical reflexions and inquiries concerning the virtues of tar water, and divers other subjects connected together and arising one from another, and a poem where he praised its virtues. Pyroligneous acid was also used at the time in a medicinal water called Aqua Binelli.|$|E
25|$|In December, President Davis asked Bragg to take {{command of}} the Trans-Mississippi Department, but Bragg declined. He was {{concerned}} for the prospects of victory west of the Mississippi River and about the poorly supplied and ill-disciplined troops there. He was also experiencing one of his periodic episodes of ill health that would plague him throughout the war. For years he had suffered from rheumatism, <b>dyspepsia,</b> nerves, and severe migraine headaches, ailments that undoubtedly contributed to his disagreeable personal style. The command went to Earl Van Dorn. Bragg proposed to Davis that he change his strategy of attempting to defend every square mile of Confederate territory, recommending that his troops were of less value on the Gulf Coast {{than they would be}} farther to the north, concentrated with other forces for an attack against the Union Army in Tennessee. Bragg transported about 10,000 men to Corinth, Mississippi, in February 1862 and was charged with improving the poor discipline of the Confederate troops already assembled under General Albert Sidney Johnston.|$|E
25|$|In April 1889, Florence Maybrick bought flypaper {{containing}} arsenic {{from a local}} chemist's {{shop and}} later soaked it {{in a bowl of}} water. At her trial, she claimed that this method allowed her to extract the arsenic for cosmetic use. James Maybrick was taken ill on 27 April 1889 after self-administering a double dose of strychnine. His doctors treated him for acute <b>dyspepsia,</b> but his condition deteriorated. On 8 May Florence Maybrick wrote a compromising letter to Brierley, which was intercepted by Alice Yapp, the nanny. Yapp passed it to James Maybrick's brother, Edwin, who was staying at Battlecrease. Edwin, himself by many accounts one of Florence's lovers, shared the contents of the letter with his brother Michael Maybrick, who was effectively the head of the family. By Michael's orders Florence was immediately deposed as mistress of her house and held under house arrest. On 9 May a nurse reported that Mrs Maybrick had surreptitiously tampered with a Valentine's Meat Juice bottle that was afterwards found to contain a half-grain of arsenic. Mrs Maybrick later testified that her husband had begged her to administer it as a pick-me-up. However, he never drank its contents.|$|E

[...] Eddy asked Crafts {{to set up a}} practice with her, but the plan came to nothing. In addition to teaching, Eddy had started to write; toward the end of 1866 she began work on an allegorical interpretation of Genesis, intended as the first volume of a book (never published), The Bible in its Spiritual Meaning.|$|E
500|$|Scholar Judith Farr {{notes that}} Dickinson, during her lifetime, [...] "was known more widely as a gardener, perhaps, {{than as a}} poet". Dickinson studied botany {{from the age of}} nine and, along with her sister, tended the garden at Homestead. During her lifetime, she {{assembled}} a collection of pressed plants in a sixty-six page leather-bound herbarium. It contained 424 pressed flower specimens that she collected, classified, and labeled using the Linnaean system. The Homestead garden was well-known and admired locally in its time. It has not survived but efforts to revive it have begun. Dickinson kept no garden notebooks or plant lists, but a clear impression can be formed from the letters and recollections of friends and family. Her niece, Martha Dickinson Bianchi, remembered [...] "carpets of lily-of-the-valley and pansies, platoons of sweetpeas, hyacinths, enough in May to give all the bees of summer <b>dyspepsia.</b> There were ribbons of peony hedges and drifts of daffodils in season, marigolds to distraction—a butterfly utopia". In particular, Dickinson cultivated scented exotic flowers, writing that she [...] "could inhabit the Spice Isles merely by crossing the dining room to the conservatory, where the plants hang in baskets". Dickinson would often send her friends bunches of flowers with verses attached, but [...] "they valued the posy more than the poetry".|$|E
500|$|In 1844, Prescott {{was painted}} by Joseph Alexander Ames, and also {{commissioned}} a bust from Richard Saltonstall Greenough. He was not active in researching for the Conquest of Peru until spring 1844, {{although he had}} already decided to write a work concerning Inca civilization while researching pre-Columbian Mexico, and listened to Inca Garcilaso de la Vega's Comentarios Reales de los Incas. He further studied Pedro Cieza de León's Crónicas del Perú, the works of Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa and Diego Fernández's Primera y segunda parte de la Historia del Piru. Prescott's progress was stalled by the unexpected death of his brother Edward at sea. His daughter Elizabeth was seriously ill, so Prescott and his family traveled to Niagara, which he considered a more healthy environment for her. After her recovery, they returned to Nahant in the summer, where Prescott started drafting the Conquest, and, as was his custom, spent the autumn in Peperell. Prescott's father {{died at the age}} of 82 on December8, which deeply upset him. He took a two-month break from writing to support his widowed mother and settle matters concerning his father's estate. His father left numerous stocks, shares and property that amounted to $343,736.86, almost all of which was shared between Prescott and his sister. Prescott was elected to the Institut de France in February 1845, in recognition of his accomplishments as a historian. He took the place of Martín Fernández de Navarrete, who had died the previous year, after a vote was cast. He was also admitted to the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin. In the summer of 1845, a collection of articles Prescott had published in the North American Review were published as Biographical and Critical Miscellanies by Bentley in octavo, and an edition was also prepared simultaneously by Harper & Brothers in New York. Prescott was writing 12pages of the work per day in the summer of 1845, and completed the first two chapters of the Conquest. He used the inheritance from his father to buy a house on Beacon Street in Boston. The building is now a National Historic Landmark, and is also known as the William Hickling Prescott House. Prescott moved into the house during December 1845, and set himself a year to finish the Conquest of Peru. In March, his eyesight, which had recovered significantly, suddenly deteriorated. Prescott was also suffering from acute <b>dyspepsia</b> and rheumatism, and he travelled to Nahant to [...] "benefit from the sea-air". This did not prevent him travelling to Washington, where he dined at the White House with President James K. Polk. He was also entertained by John Y. Mason, the former United States Secretary of the Navy, who informed him that a copy of Prescott's Conquest of Mexico had been placed in the library of every fighting ship. [...] The Conquest of Peru was completed in March 1847. As with previous works, it was published by Harper & Brothers in the United States and Bentley in Britain. The original US print run was 7,500copies, and the books were sold for $1 each. It was translated into Spanish, French, German and Dutch, and sold excellently. As with his previous works, it was also well-received critically.|$|E

Fluoxetine is considered the most stimulating of the SSRIs (that is, it is most prone to causing insomnia and agitation). It also appears to be the most prone of the SSRIs for producing dermatologic reactions (e.g. urticaria (hives), rash, itchiness, etc.).|$|E

2500|$|A {{recurring}} story concerns Jackson's love of lemons, {{which he}} allegedly gnawed whole to alleviate symptoms of <b>dyspepsia.</b> General Richard Taylor, son of President Zachary Taylor, wrote {{a passage in}} his war memoirs about Jackson eating lemons: [...] "Where Jackson got his lemons 'no fellow could find out,' but he was rarely without one." [...] However, recent research by his biographer, James I. Robertson, Jr., has found that none of Jackson's contemporaries, including members of his staff, his friends, or his wife, recorded any unusual obsessions with lemons. Jackson thought of a lemon as a [...] "rare treat ... enjoyed greatly whenever it could {{be obtained from the}} enemy's camp". Jackson was fond of all fruits, particularly peaches, [...] "but he enjoyed with relish lemons, oranges, watermelons, apples, grapes, berries, or whatever was available." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many {{physiological}} {{changes in}} the body are associated with fear, summarized as the fight-or-flight response. An inborn response for coping with danger, it works by accelerating the breathing rate (hyperventilation), heart rate, constriction of the peripheral blood vessels leading to blushing and vasodilation of the central vessels (pooling), [...] increasing muscle tension including the muscles attached to each hair follicle to contract and causing [...] "goose bumps", or more clinically, piloerection (making a cold person warmer or a frightened animal look more impressive), sweating, increased blood glucose (hyperglycemia), increased serum calcium, increase in white blood cells called neutrophilic leukocytes, alertness leading to sleep disturbance and [...] "butterflies in the stomach" [...] (<b>dyspepsia).</b> This primitive mechanism may help an organism survive by either running away or fighting the danger. With the series of physiological changes, the consciousness realizes an emotion of fear.|$|E

McDonnell returned to the city on August 13, 1888, reportedly [...] "looking well and hearty", but intended to arrange to extend his leave of absence and return to Derby the following evening. He was on duty at the stationhouse that day and, leaving orders for a morning wake up call at 9 am, went to bed in the sergeants' room on the second floor at around 10:00 pm. He was seen [...] "sleeping peacefully" [...] by a Sergeant Reilly at 6 am, however he was found dead three hours later when a doorman came to wake him up.

2500|$|There is {{evidence}} that abnormalities occur in the gut flora of individuals who have IBS, such as reduced diversity, a decrease in bacteria belonging to the phylum Bacteroidetes, {{and an increase in}} those belonging to the phylum Firmicutes.

Antibodies against common components (namely flagellin) of the commensal gut flora are a common occurrence in IBS affected individuals.
