40|$|Mathematical {{modelling}} {{and computer}} simulation of grain drying are now {{widely used in}} agricultural engineering research. Several models have been proposed to describe the heat and mass transfer processes in the basic types of convective <b>grain</b> <b>drier.</b> Most of these models, however, have been derived under assumptions which are not explicitly stated and which restrict their applications from the outset. Furthermore, the differences which exist between various models are not always clarified in the literature. It is important with an ever-increasing demand for the accurate modelling of drying systems, for the researcher to understand the basic assumptions inherent in a particular model and hence {{to be aware of}} its limitations. In addition, the problems of obtaining satisfactory solutions for particular models have generally been given only a cursory treatment. The purpose of this work is, firstly, to provide a general framework from which mathematical models for any type of drier may be derived under suitable assumptions. The use of this framework is illustrated by the formulation of models for the four basic types of convective <b>grain</b> <b>drier,</b> namely fixed bed, concurrent flow, counterflow and crossflow. Previous work is then discussed in the context of these models. The resulting systems of differential equations for each of the models obtained are non-linear and have, in general, no analytical solution. The analytical/semi-analytical solutions to particular problems associated with the above cases are pursued as far as possible. However, as is evident from this investigation, purely numerical techniques provide the only practicable means of obtaining an accurate solution to any grain drying problem of current interest. Therefore, suitable computational techniques were devised and implemented for the solution of the three distinct cases, namely the fixed bed, steadystate concurrent flow and steady-state counterflow problems. These techniques are described together with appropriate validation cases...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{original}} projects undertaken under the cooperative agreement No. DE-FC 04 - 87 AL 42558 between the Massachusetts Photovoltaic Program and the United States Department of Energy was to design, build, and test a <b>grain</b> <b>drier</b> which utilized solar energy effectively. Different grains have different drying requirements, and the <b>grain</b> <b>drier</b> team chose to design the drier for rice because of the worldwide economic importance of this staple food and {{also because of the}} challenges that drying rice presents. Rice loses much of its market value if it is exposed to large temperature changes while drying; therefore, a solar rice drier must be designed so as to try to level the temperature variations which naturally arise from the intermittency of the solar source. The design team committed itself early in the project to a hybrid concept, where solar energy is utilized in two ways: it is captured {open_quote}thermally{close_quote} in a rock-bed which acts {{at the same time as}} thermal storage and buffer, and it is converted {open_quote}directly{close_quote} in a small photovoltaic panel which generates electricity to power a small fan to circulate air through the rock-bed and the grain during daylight hours. At night, natural convection drives the air flow. The design of most of the system is flexible, in that the drier can be built with materials available at the intended site, with non-specialized labor. The team has purposely avoided any {open_quote}high tech{close_quote} solution which would increase the drier cost for third-world users. Therefore, the drier design does not incorporate selective surfaces or a vacuum, two common methods of enhancing solar thermal performance. The design does incorporate a small but relatively high value element, the PV panel and fan package. A major part of the group effort was devoted to data acquisition, to analyze the effects of different modifications on the drier performance. The results of the effort are summarized in this report...|$|E

A study was undertaken to compare the observed final <b>grain</b> <b>dry</b> weight of five groups of wheat genotypes differing in earliness (extra early, medium early, medium late, late and a control group of high yielding NS cultivars) with the observed duration and average and maximum rates of grain filling in two different environments. Correlation coefficients {{were used to determine}} which grain filling parameter had more influence on final <b>grain</b> <b>dry</b> weight, in an environment common for our country (2002), final <b>grain</b> <b>dry</b> weight was strongly positively correlated with the average and maximum rates and strongly negatively correlated with the duration of grain filling. The medium late and control groups had the highest final <b>grain</b> <b>dry</b> weights. Correlations between final <b>grain</b> <b>dry</b> weight and the duration and average rate of grain filling were positive in an unfavorable environment (2001). The NS cultivars and extra early genotypes had the highest final grain dry-weights. The rate and duration of grain filling are usually negatively correlated. The influence of grain filling parameters on final <b>grain</b> <b>dry</b> weight is not the same in different environments, so the ability of the genotype to compensate for the low grain filling rate with grain fill prolongation in unfavorable environments might be more important. The observed average grain filling rate is probably more important as a parameter for describing these processes than the maximum one...|$|R

Microfilm. xxiv, 193 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmThe {{effect of}} weather on {{agricultural}} production and processing is of vital concern to all farmers. <b>Grain</b> <b>drying</b> systems, {{especially in the}} developing world, are complex and weather dependent 0 Because of the large degree of risk due to the random nature of weather, farmers in developing nations have had problems in the adoption of artificial <b>drying.</b> The centralized <b>grain</b> <b>drying</b> facilities are usually designed without considering adequately the random effects of weather. As a result, most <b>grain</b> <b>drying</b> investments {{are found to be}} uneconomical. Efficient design and economic operation can only be achieved through better understanding of all the relevant variables and their interrelationships in the entire drying system. A general simulation model for <b>grain</b> <b>drying</b> (WEGDM) was developed ~ including the pertinent weather variables, either stochastic or deterministic, into a meaningful analysis. It is built to be general enough to simulate most <b>grain</b> <b>drying</b> systems. The model consists of three major computer programs, namely, Simulation Program for Weather Variables (SPWV); Simulation Program for Grainflow, Drying and Management (SPGDM); and Simulation Program for Financial Analysis (SPFA). The SPWV program simulates sunny and no-sunny days for <b>grain</b> <b>drying</b> harvest and no-harvest days; wind and no-wind days for grain harvesting; using Markov Transition Probabilities. The SPGDM program simulates the amount of grain flow, moisture content of the grain and grain losses in various stages of grain handling and processing. The program SPFA is designed to calculate and gather all pertinent cost information into a meaningful economic analysis. The Net Present Value (NPV) of cash flow has been considered as a decision criterion of the model. The main program with 23 subroutines in the FORTRAN 77 language has been designed to make the program flexible and easy to follow. The grain paddy and the Los Banos area of the Philippines were chosen for development and verification of this model. The application of the model is extensive. Design of a grain processing complex, economic analysis of an existing plant, feasibility study of a <b>grain</b> <b>drying</b> plant and evaluation of alternative drying strategies are the important areas of application of the model...|$|R

The objectives of this study were: To enumerate and quantify the fixed and variable components of the total costs associated with commercial <b>grain</b> <b>drying</b> in Nebraska.

To analyze the above objectives in terms of plant utilization and various aspects of economies of size. This study has a two-fold purpose.
