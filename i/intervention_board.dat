40|$|Introduction: Emergency {{physicians}} frequently perform {{endotracheal intubation}} and mechanical ventilation. The impact of instituting early post-intubation <b>interventions</b> on patients <b>boarding</b> {{in the emergency}} department (ED) is not well studied. We sought to determine the impact of post-intubation interventions (arterial blood gas sampling, obtaining a chest x-ray (CXR), gastric decompression, early sedation, appropriate initial tidal volume, and quantitative capnography) on outcomes of mortality, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator days, and intensive care unit (ICU) length-of-stay (LOS). Methods: This was an observational, retrospective study of patients intubated in the ED at a large tertiary-care teaching hospital and included patients in the ED for greater than two hours post-intubation.  We excluded them if they had incomplete data, were designated “do not resuscitate,” were managed primarily by the trauma team, or had surgery within six hours after intubation. Results: Of 169 patients meeting criteria, 15 died and 10 developed VAP.  The mortality odds ratio (OR) in patients receiving CXR was 0. 10 (95 % CI 0. 01 to 0. 98), and 0. 11 (95 % CI 0. 03 to 0. 46) in patients receiving early sedation. The mortality OR for patients with 3 or fewer interventions was 4. 25 (95 % CI 1. 15 to 15. 75) when {{compared to patients with}} 5 or more interventions.  There was no significant relationship between VAP rate, ventilator days, or ICU LOS and any of the intervention groups. Conclusion: The performance of a CXR and early sedation as well as performing five or more vs. three or fewer post-intubation <b>interventions</b> in <b>boarding</b> adult ED patients was associated with decreased mortality.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the World Bank's lending and knowledge building activities that have improved pension systems in client countries during the past two decades. The objectives of this report are: i) to describe the policy framework that has guided the Bank's work on pension related issues; ii) to present relevant information about {{the nature and extent of}} the Bank's lending and policy advisory work in this area; and iii) to discuss some of the results that have been achieved through this work as well as future policy directions. The overview covers the level and characteristics of all lending operations that included a component related to pensions during FY 2002 - 07, as well as over a longer time period going back to 1984 when the Bank initiated a meaningful level of pension work. Thus, this report updates the portfolio review that was a central element of the Bank's Independent Evaluation Group's (IEG) review of pension work that covered the period from 1984 through early 2004.

The association between board activity and corporate governance variables is complex and multi-faceted. The two testable propositions {{in the study were}} that: an association exists between board activity and an array of corporate governance mechanisms; and that board activity adds value to the firm and by inference to shareholders. Board activity, measured by the frequency of board meetings, had a negative but lagged relationship with financial performance, a negative relationship with the size of the board, a negative relationship with insider ownership, a positive relationship with both the number of block holders and the number of other directorships held by directors, and insignificant relationships to both board independence and the number of committees.

The purpose of this review is to identify adult eating behaviors that are known to strongly affect the energy intake side of the energy balance and that may be readily amenable to prevention and intervention efforts in primary care. Restaurant and fast food consumption, large portion sizes, and consumption of beverages with sugar added increase energy intake and are highly associated with weight gain and obesity. Conversely, consumption of low energy dense food, ie, fruits and vegetables, and routine healthy breakfast consumption can help to maintain or lose weight. These distinct behaviors represent concrete negative and positive eating patterns on which primary care providers can focus when counseling overweight and obese patients.

The deregulation of export slaughter facilities, Supplementary Minimum Prices, Producer <b>Board</b> <b>intervention,</b> declining livestock numbers and domestic cost pressures have all affected the performance of the domestically based processing sector. Major changes in market access and demand have influenced off-shore marketing operations, particularly for sheepmeats. Additionally, there has been a change in the type of meat exported with a greater proportion of further processed product shipped in recent years. As an example of the impact of these developments on livestock producers, the producer share of the United Kingdom wholesale market return for a representative prime lamb carcase has fallen from 40 per cent in 1978 to 25 per cent in 1988. In this article the pattern of intervention in the New Zealand pastoral meat industries from the mid- 1960 s is detailed, emphasising the different environments of the beef and sheepmeat enterprises. Then the principal factors influencing domestic processing margins for these products are empirically examined.

40|$|Background: Asthma {{has been}} linked to stroke, but it is unknown if hay fever is related to stroke. This study was {{designed}} to investigate if there is an association between a reported history of hay fever and stroke during a 4. 4 -year study period. Methods: Analysis was performed of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study, a cohort of mid-dle aged and elderly adults. We examined the association of a reported history of hay fever to the devel-opment of stroke. Results: There were 9272 participants meeting our criteria, of which 125 had strokes. Of those with a history of hay fever, 2. 2 % had a stroke. Of those without a history of hay fever, 1. 25 % had a stroke. Participants with a history of hay fever had an unadjusted hazard ratio of 1. 72 (95 % CI, 1. 08 – 2. 27) for stroke versus participants without hay fever. Risk of stroke remained significant (hazard ratio, 1. 87 [95 % CI, 1. 17 – 2. 99]) after controlling for age, sex, race, smoking status, body mass index, diabetes, hypertension, alcohol use, and hyperlipidemia.

40|$|The {{morphological}} changes affecting a small mountain catchment in {{the territory}} of Modena (Italy) have been taken into account. In particular, based on detailed field surveys and analysis of remote sensing imagery, an assessment was made on the natural and anthropogenic agents which have modelled this basin in the past 80 years. For several decades, the Torrent Corlo catchment was subject to intense exploitation of clay raw materials in order to supply a flourishing ceramic tile industry. As a result, a strong, negative impact has affected the landscape and, in some areas, the geomorphological evolution due to man’s activities greatly surpasses the changes ascribable to natural processes, such as landslides or stream channel processes. Since 2008, all quarrying activities have ceased and the local public administration has started a project of reclamation of the abandoned clay pits, although {{it will not be}} possible to restore completely the original, natural features of this catchment. A comparison is made with the sub-catchment Rio delle Vigne valley, which has been spared from anthropogenic changes and has been affected only by natural gravity-induced processes, which have produced some twelve landslides. The final products of this research are the implementation of the first geomorphological map of the T. Corlo mountain catchment and an updated version of the hydrological hazard map, in which active and dormant landslides are much more numerous than those mapped in any other previous geological map (s. l.).

The Methodist Church could not control the influx of people, and therefore transferred ownership of the farm to the Ministry of Local Government in 1983. By 2002 the population was 113,884. Epworth had not been planned as an urban residential area, and therefore this rapid increase in population was occurring on land without any water supply or sanitation facilities. Epworth became the only informal settlement to have been tolerated by the Zimbabwean Government in the post-independence period because of the long history of settlement by some of the residents.The government decided to upgrade rather than demolish the informal settlement. Since most residents of Epworth had settled in the area spontaneously, public utilities such as water, sewage and electricity were lacking before government <b>intervention.</b> A Local <b>Board</b> formed in 1986 under the Urban Councils Act, and whose members are elected by the community, is responsible for managing the area including the collection of rates and other levies.Epworth was initially developed into four sub-areas but as the population increased it expanded to nine sub-areas that had extensive squatter settlements.

40|$|Mobility, {{the ability}} to walk safely and independently, is an {{important}} component of everyday life that is dependent on adequate balance control (Shumway-Cook et al., 2002). Age-related declines in balance control lead to avoidance of activity, which ultimately further degrades the balance control system (Shumway-Cook 2 ̆ 6 Woollacott, 2010). Exercise has been deemed {{the most important factor in}} improving balance in older adults (NIH, 2008). Training paradigms have been developed to improve balance control in older adults. It is important to compare training programs to determine their relative efficacy on improving gait. ^ The overall objective of this study was to examine if balance training while standing would lead to improved gait. A second objective of the study was to determine the relative efficacy of training with a traditional wobble board versus the Biodex Balance System SD™. During wobble board training, the participant attempts to maintain balance while standing on an unstable platform. The Biodex provides visual feedback regarding the participants’ movements during weight-shifting tasks on an unstable platform. The <b>intervention</b> groups (wobble <b>board,</b> n= 9; Biodex, n= 9) trained three times per week for six weeks, while non-exercise control older adults (n= 19) maintained their regular activities for six weeks. The variability of steady state gait improved with Biodex training, but did not improve with wobble board training. Improvements in gait speed during obstacle crossing were similar for both Biodex and wobble board training. These findings indicate that gait can be improved without specifically training gait. Overall, Biodex training was found to be superior to wobble board training for improving gait parameters. ...|$|R
