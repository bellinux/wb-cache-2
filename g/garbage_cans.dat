5|$|The {{state of}} grizzly bear populations in Banff {{is seen as}} a proxy for {{ecological}} integrity. To keep bears away from humans, an electric fence was put up around the summer gondola and parking lot at Lake Louise in 2001. Bear-proof <b>garbage</b> <b>cans,</b> which do not allow bears to access their contents, help to deter them from human sites. The fruit of Buffaloberry bushes is eaten by bears, so the bushes have been removed in some areas where the risk of a bear–human encounter is high.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the game}} was never completed, {{only a small portion}} of the {{intended}} gameplay exists. During the playable segment, Mustafa, through conversations with other detainees, discovers that another detainee is planning an escape but needs a pair of pliers to make the attempt. Mustafa must join a work detail to gain access to the pliers, hide the pliers in a garbage can to prevent them from being found during a search, recover them at night (which requires Mustafa to find a way to pry open the area that the <b>garbage</b> <b>cans</b> are stored in), and deliver them to the other detainee. The playable section ends when Mustafa delivers the pliers. Other interactions during the playable section include speaking with a detainee who, after complaining that a guard threw her copy of the Quran to the ground, mentions the existence of a partially built tunnel from a previous escape attempt.|$|E

5|$|Decades {{of efforts}} to {{eradicate}} or simply thin the rat population in the system have been unsuccessful. In March 2009, the Transit Authority announced a series of changes to its vermin control strategy, including new poison formulas and experimental trap designs. In October 2011, the MTA announced a new initiative to clean 25 subway stations, along with their garbage rooms, of rat infestations. Also in October 2011, the MTA announced a pilot program aimed at reducing levels of garbage in the subways by removing all garbage bins from the subway platforms. The initiative is being tested at the Eighth Street–New York University and Flushing–Main Street stations. As of March 2016, stations along the BMT Jamaica Line, BMT Myrtle Avenue Line, and various other stations had their <b>garbage</b> <b>cans</b> removed due {{to the success of}} the program.|$|E
5|$|Juan caused {{widespread}} {{structural and}} vegetation damage across the region, particularly {{in and around}} the Halifax Regional Municipality. Extensive damage to trees was reported, which blocked many streets and knocked down power lines. Many homes and businesses suffered property damage, particularly roof damage on structures, and some weaker structures were destroyed. HRM estimated that 31% of residential homes suffered some degree of damage and 27% of homes had enough damage to warrant an insurance claim. In Downtown Halifax, erosion-control boulders the size of <b>garbage</b> <b>cans</b> were hurled from Halifax Harbour onto boardwalks and parking lots and piers. The Victoria General Hospital experienced roof and water damage and was evacuated during the storm, as were numerous tall apartment buildings and other multi-family residences. Billboards and signs were also destroyed, and dozens of vehicles were crushed by trees and other debris. The city's cherished Point Pleasant Park and Public Gardens suffered massive loss of trees and remained closed for months.|$|E
25|$|Maintenance {{measures}} include proper {{storage of}} garbage, removal of water sources, and elimination of environments suitable for nesting. <b>Garbage</b> <b>cans</b> {{need to be}} rat-resistant and made out of metal rather than plastic. Because rats easily chew through plastic, the Health Department recommends placing plastic garbage bags inside rat-resistant metal <b>garbage</b> <b>cans.</b> Garbage should be placed {{out on the street}} close to the pickup time, rather than the night before.|$|E

25|$|As {{the year}} progresses, the colony changes its style of obtaining food {{for both the}} larvae and adults. In April, when the queen {{normally}} lays her eggs, the workers actively go out and forage. However, typically around the fall season, a change is observed in the colony as the foraging workers turn into scavengers. Instead of putting forth the effort to find food sources, the workers try to take what is more easily available. For example, European hornets have been seen hovering around <b>garbage</b> <b>cans</b> and picnic areas in the fall.|$|E

It was at the Old Chauffeur's Club where Josephine met Willie Wells and married him the same year. However, the marriage lasted less than a year.

25|$|V. acadica, {{like other}} members of the V. rufa group, rely on live {{arthropod}} prey as their main source of protein and collect natural carbohydrate sources. V. acadica workers are known to prey on live caterpillars, flies, and hemipterans. V. acadica wasps do not scavenge or forage on freshly killed insects. The diet of V. rufa group species contain less variety than those of the larger colony wasps like those in the V. vulgaris group. It has been suggested that V. acadica are not considered pests by humans because they exclusively hunt for live prey and do not scavenge from areas like <b>garbage</b> <b>cans</b> and picnic areas where they would most likely encounter humans.|$|E
25|$|During {{the worst}} years of Cabrini–Green's problems, {{vandalism}} increased substantially. Gang members and miscreants covered interior walls with graffiti and damaged doors, windows, and elevators. Rat and cockroach infestations were commonplace, rotting garbage stacked up in clogged trash chutes (it once piled {{up to the}} 15th floor), and basic utilities (water, electricity, etc.) often malfunctioned and were left unrepaired. On the exterior, boarded-up windows, burned-out areas of the façade, and pavement instead of green space—all {{in the name of}} economizing on maintenance—created an atmosphere of decay and government neglect. The balconies were fenced in to prevent residents from emptying <b>garbage</b> <b>cans</b> into the yard, and from falling or being thrown to their deaths. This created the appearance of a large prison tier, or of animal cages, which further enraged community leaders of the residents.|$|E

500|$|Within ten years, over 200 {{bald eagles}} were visiting during winter and early spring each day, {{and the job}} of feeding them became more involved. To have enough fish to last through the winter, she would begin in August to {{stockpile}} fish scraps and freezer burned fish donated by her employer and by other local companies. The fish was sometimes supplemented by moose meat that Keene salvaged when she heard of a road-killed moose on the highway. She began feeding the eagles at about December 1 of each year, a job that took up to three hours' work each morning. Keene obtained permission from her employer to use a company forklift to move the large containers of stockpiled fish scraps and freezer-burned salmon, halibut, rockfish, cod, and herring out of the company's large freezers. She then transferred the fish by hand into barrels or <b>garbage</b> <b>cans,</b> which she loaded up in her pickup truck. Then she would drive the load to her motorhome, [...] about [...] from the Seward Fisheries plant, and cut the fish into fist-sized pieces to be thrown out to the eagles. If the fish was fully frozen, she would use an axe, chainsaw, or blowtorch to break the fish down into smaller chunks, or might even have to lug the large <b>garbage</b> <b>cans</b> into her motorhome to thaw. [...] "I don't know if anyone else would do this," [...] she told a reporter in 1986. [...] "My motorhome smells like fish. My yard is fish. My truck is fish. I am fish. It gets kind of gross sometimes, especially when you're handling a lot of slimy carcasses." ...|$|E
500|$|Thousands {{of people}} had {{gathered}} {{in front of the}} Stonewall, which had opened again, choking Christopher Street until the crowd spilled into adjoining blocks. The throng surrounded buses and cars, harassing the occupants unless they either admitted they were gay or indicated their support for the demonstrators. Sylvia Rivera saw a friend of hers jump on a nearby car trying to drive through; the crowd rocked the car back and forth, terrifying its occupants. Another of Rivera's friends, Marsha P. Johnson, an African-American street queen, climbed a lamppost and dropped a heavy bag onto the hood of a police car, shattering the windshield. As on the previous evening, fires were started in <b>garbage</b> <b>cans</b> throughout the neighborhood. More than a hundred police were present from the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Ninth Precincts, but after 2:00a.m. the TPF arrived again. Kick lines and police chases waxed and waned; when police captured demonstrators, whom the majority of witnesses described as [...] "sissies" [...] or [...] "swishes", the crowd surged to recapture them.

Dodger goes to Manzini's antique shop where he works. Manzini takes Dodger's clothes and cleans them while warning him {{to stay away from}} the <b>garbage</b> <b>can.</b> Later, Dodger sees Tangerine, Juice's girlfriend, who seems to be the most compassionate one towards Dodger, and tries to persuade her to buy something. Dodger is attracted to Tangerine and covertly smells her hair while she is distracted. The other bullies enter the shop and attempt to rough up Dodger again, but he manages to outwit them. However, amidst the tussle, the <b>garbage</b> <b>can</b> is knocked over. The bullies then bring Dodger into a sewer, handcuff him to a rail, and open a sewage pipe on him.

2500|$|Corot, however, would {{complete}} his own scenic paintings {{back in his}} studio where they would often be revised to his preconceptions.

As a result, his art was sometimes criticised as being [...] "vulgar," [...] because he painted what he saw: [...] "rutted and edged hodgepodge of bushes, mounds of earth, and trees {{in various stages of}} development." [...] According to one source, details such as those were equivalent to today's art showing <b>garbage</b> <b>cans</b> or beer bottles {{on the side of a}} street scene.
