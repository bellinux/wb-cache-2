40|$|An {{experimental}} study of electrostatical atomized and dispersed diesel <b>fuel</b> <b>jets</b> was conducted at various back pressures to 40 atm. A new electrostatic injection technique was utilized to generate continuous, stable fuel sprays at charge densities of 1. 5 to 2. 0 C/m 3 of fluid at one atm, and about 1. 0 C/m 3 at 40 atm. Flowrates were varied from 0. 5 to 2. 5 ml/s and electric potentials to - 18 kV. Visual observations showed that significant enhanced dispersion of charged <b>fuel</b> <b>jets</b> occurred at high back pressures compared to aerodynamic breakup and dispersion.

40|$|Abstract. There {{are mainly}} four {{pathways}} to get liquid fuels from the coal including the direct liquefaction process, the Fischer-Tropsch process, coal-tar refining, and pyrolysis process. The characteristics {{of these four}} processed have been described. As the first two pathways {{are considered to be}} promising, the characteristics of these two types of coal-based <b>jet</b> <b>fuels</b> are discussed and the component characteristics of coal-based synthesis fuels are investigated, respectively. The component characteristics of coal-based <b>jet</b> <b>fuels</b> are compared with the traditional petroleum-based <b>jet</b> <b>fuels.</b> There are large differences between the properties of the coal-based <b>jet</b> <b>fuel</b> via direct and indirect liquefaction pathways. Comparing with the conventional petroleum-based <b>jet</b> <b>fuel,</b> the coal-based <b>jet</b> <b>fuel</b> via direct liquefaction pathway has the higher aromatics content, while the fuel via indirect pathway (F-T process) has more paraffin and nearly no naphthenes or aromatics.

We then focus our analyses on the specific ways in which <b>jet</b> <b>fuel</b> hedging by airlines can affect firm value. Specifically, we investigate the effect of <b>jet</b> <b>fuel</b> hedging on firm value based on different hedging levels, different levels of <b>jet</b> <b>fuel</b> exposures, different hedger types, different operating costs spent on <b>jet</b> <b>fuel,</b> and different levels of <b>jet</b> <b>fuel</b> price volatility.
