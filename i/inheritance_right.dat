Thus, it is possible that two or more sisters (and their heirs after their deaths) have an equally valid claim to the title; in such a case, the title goes into abeyance. The abeyance ends either when there is only one remaining claimant due to deaths of the other claimants, or when the Sovereign [...] "terminates" [...] the abeyance in favour of one of the heirs.

With the exception of a short period, she remained in office until 1778. This was an unprecedented achievement, as women normally did not hold any of the offices of the Inquisition. She temporarily gave up the office in 1762 of her own inclination to her late spouse's uncle Canon Testaferrata, who was the preferred choice of Inquisitor Durinito. However, Canon Testaferrata accepted the office unwillingly; he pointed out that he was old and that the <b>inheritance</b> <b>right</b> to the office must be protected for her son, and after his death in 1763, she accepted to resume the office until her son became of legal majority.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the importance of}} property rights {{in the process of}} economic development of poor countries. The first chapter {{examines the}} impact of female property <b>inheritance</b> <b>rights</b> on human capital investment of women. Using plausibly exogenous variation created by amendments to the female inheritance law in India, I find that exposure to improved female <b>inheritance</b> <b>rights</b> increased the mean educational attainment of women. I also provide some suggestive evidence that the mechanism behind such an effect may be explained by the complementarity between female <b>inheritance</b> <b>rights</b> and education in the context of household property management rather than by a relaxation in the household budget constraint following reduction in dowry payments at the time of marriage. The second chapter looks at the intergenerational impact of improving mothers' property <b>inheritance</b> <b>rights</b> on their children's education. Using the same legal amendment to female inheritance laws as in chapter 1, I find that stronger <b>inheritance</b> <b>rights</b> of mothers had a positive impact on the mean education level of their daughters, but had little effect on that of sons. The chapter also provides suggestive evidence that the underlying mechanism of this effect appears to be an improvement in mothers' intra-household bargaining power rather than their increased access to credit as a result of improvement in <b>inheritance</b> <b>rights</b> following the reform. The third chapter (joint with Maitreesh Ghatak) examines the impact of land reform legislation, aimed at strengthening property rights, on agricultural productivity in India. We find heterogeneous treatment effects of land reform on productivity, both across types of land reform as well as across states of India. We argue that a plausible explanation for such observed inter-state heterogeneity in land reform experience may be found in the differential emphasis laid by states on different components of land reform, in particular ceiling versus tenancy laws...|$|R
