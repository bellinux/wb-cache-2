40|$|This {{article is}} {{concerned}} with the risks associated with the monopolisation of information that is available from a single source only. Although there is a longstanding consensus that sole-source databases should not receive protection under the <b>EU</b> <b>Database</b> Directive, and there are legislative provisions to ensure that lawful users have access to a database’s contents, Ryanair v PR Aviation challenges this assumption by affirming that the use of non-protected databases can be restricted by contract. Owners of non-protected databases can contractually exclude lawful users from taking the benefit of statutorily permitted uses, because such databases are not covered from the legislation that declares this kind of contract null and void. We argue that this judgment is not consistent with the legislative history and can have a profound impact on the functioning of the digital single market, where new information services, such as meta-search engines or price-comparison websites, base their operation on the systematic extraction and re-utilisation of materials available from online sources. This is an issue that the Commission should address in a forthcoming evaluation of the Database Directive...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To provide oscillometric blood {{pressure}} (BP) reference values in European non-overweight school children. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis from the IDEFICS study (www. ideficsstudy. <b>eu)</b> <b>database.</b> METHODS: Standardised BP and anthropometric measures {{were obtained from}} children aged 2 to 10. 9 years, participating in the 2007 - 2008 and 2009 - 2010 IDEFICS surveys. Age- and height-specific systolic and diastolic pressure percentiles were calculated by GAMLSS, separately for boys and girls, in both the entire population (n = 16 937) and the non-overweight children only (n = 13 547). The robustness of the models was tested by sensitivity analyses carried out in both population samples. RESULTS: Percentiles of BP distribution in non-overweight children were provided by age and height strata, separately for boys and girls. Diastolic BP norms were slightly higher in girls than in boys for similar age and height, while systolic BP values tended to be higher in boys starting from age 5 years. Sensitivity analysis, comparing BP distributions obtained in all children with those of non-overweight children, showed that the inclusion of overweight/obese individuals shifted the references values upward, in particular systolic BP in girls at the extreme percentiles. CONCLUSIONS: The present analysis provides updated and timely information about reference values for BP in children aged 2 to < 11 years that may be useful for monitoring and planning population strategies for disease prevention...|$|E

In the present work were evaluated the pesticide residue contamination on these aliments, and possible risks {{for the consumer}} health. Pesticide residues were evaluated in 364 bean samples and 143 rice samples commercialized in Sao Paulo City (BRAZIL). A multi-residue method (DFG S 19) was employed with gas and liquid chromatography identifi cation and quantifi cation. Dietary intake estimation was processed using the Acute Dietary Ingestion (ADI) based on national data regarding food consumption. Residues of pesticides that, according to the Brazilian legislation, are not allowed for this culture were detected respectively in 4. 5 % and 3. 6 % of the bean and rice samples. However, none of the samples had pesticide residues above the Maximum Residue Level (MRL). The European Union (<b>EU)</b> <b>database</b> showed that 7. 3 % of the bean sample and 85. 7 % of rice presented pesticide residues above the MRL. The toxicological parameter used for assessing the risk of contamination (ADI < 100 %) was not exceeded in none of the commodities. The results do not pose a hazard for the consumer’s health.

40|$|Web {{wrapping}} technologies {{were developed}} in the 90 s {{in the middle of}} the dot com boom to facilitate the extraction of web data. In recent years, the underlying architecture of web wrapping technologies is also been used for other applications such as information integration between legacy systems in large enterprises. Despite the relatively widespread use of this technology, there is currently no uniform way of characterizing web wrapping toolkits, unlike say, a digital camera which can be described in terms of the size of its sensor or storage capacity. The focus of this thesis therefore is to develop a taxonomy or classification scheme that can be used to effectively describe a web wrapping toolkit in terms of its retrieval, extraction and conversion features. For this purpose, some 20 toolkits are studied and of which, verification tests were performed on 9 of these toolkits where evaluation copies are available.

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{understand}} the reasons behind the considerable complications facing the project to develop a new, second generation version of the Schengen Information System (SIS II). Despite the centrality of this large-scale <b>EU</b> <b>database</b> for immigration and border control purposes and the increasing prioritisation of security technologies within the EU’s internal security strategy, the project has encountered substantial delays, an escalating budget, political crises and criticisms of the new system’s potential impact on fundamental rights. To uncover {{the underlying causes of}} these difficulties and deficiencies, the paper examines the decision-making processes that have shaped the development of SIS II over the last decade. It argues that there are strong parallels between the policy processes surrounding SIS II and decision-making under the old Schengen regime, where expert driven, security oriented and fragmented decision-making took place outside the EU framework and beyond the reach of democratic and judicial oversight. The paper contends that decision-making on SIS II undermines principles of proportionality, accountability and fundamental rights and, by extension, puts into question the political legitimacy of the EU’s Area of Freedom, Security and Justice. The paper concludes with a set of policy recommendations intended to inform the future development of large-scale EU IT systems.

40|$|Objectives of {{the thesis}} are – 1) to {{identify}} the legal problems coming from mashups of Open Govern-ment Data (OGD) and 2) to purpose an informal ontology to help technical reusers of Public Sector Informa-tion to utilize datasets according to their intended purpose and {{in compliance with the}} legal obligations that govern the rights to reuse the data. A survey of national OGD portals found that the majority of OGD are released under inappropriate li-censes, not fully complying with the legal rules that apply to the reuse of the data. Open Government Data can be released and covered by multiple licensing regimes, up to 33 in a single country. We have analysed the European Union (EU) legal framework of reuse of Public Sector Information (PSI), the <b>EU</b> <b>Database</b> Directive and copyright framework and other legal sources (e. g., licenses, legal notices, and terms of use) that can apply to open government Datasets. From this deep analysis we have modelled several major concepts in an Informal Ontology of Open Government Data Licenses Framework for a Mash-up Model (iOGDL 4 M). The iOGDL 4 M will be used for qualifying datasets in order to improve the accuracy of their legal anno-tation. The iOGDL 4 M also aims to connect each applicable legal rule to official legal texts in order to direct legal experts and reusers to primary sources. This research aims to present 1) a legal analysis of OGD regulation in the European Union and its mem-ber states; 2) the Survey of National Open Government Data Portals and analysis of the most commonly applied licenses and legal notices and their compatibility; and 3) the Informal Ontology of Open Govern-ment Data Licenses Framework for a Mash-up Model.

40|$|The {{capacity}} to assemble, store, and make available information in databases is ever growing. This development has accelerated in recent decades, {{driven by the}} advent and increased use of digital networks. Already at an early stage, it led to demands for legal protection of databases. In most countries databases have been protected in national legislation based on copyright principles. However, this kind of protection has been regarded as insufficient. The {{reason for this is}} that copyright protection only covers the selection or arrangement of the contents of the database. By rearranging the contents, it is possible to avoid liability for copyright infringement. To address the specific needs of producers of databases, the then European community adopted a directive in 1996 on the legal protection of databases. The Directive aims to harmonise copyright protection for databases and to introduce a new, sui generis, right for the legal protection of databases. The sui generis right protects the investments in obtaining, verifying, and presenting the contents in a database. The sui generis right has been described in the literature as one of the most complex intellectual property rights ever established. Its complexity resides in the unclear relationship between the requirements for protection and the content and scope of protection. This dissertation describes, analyses, compares and systematises the legal protection for databases as provided for in the <b>EU</b> <b>Database</b> Directive – both in relation to copyright and sui generis protection, but also in relation to the intellectual property system in general and principles and rules on unfair competition. The study also describes and analyses the Directive as implemented into Swedish law. To do this, it makes use of relevant legal sources, with particular account taken of relevant sources of EU law such as the Directive itself, adjacent directives in the field of copyright and related rights, as well as unfair competition law and the case law and legal method developed by the Court of Justice of the European Union. The study also draws on underlying theories of intellectual property protection and unfair competition law, as well as arguments based on unjust enrichment and pure economic loss. The study establishes how the sui generis right serves as a legal hybrid between traditional intellectual property rights and protection against unfair competition. The structure of the right resembles traditional intellectual property rights, with requirements for protection, provisions on exclusive rights, exceptions and limitations and a term of protection. At the same time, the content and scope of protection provide measures similar to those countering unfair competition with aspects of protection against pure economic loss. The right protects against certain activities carried out in the market rather than providing protection for a traditional object of intellectual property law. When implementing the Directive, the Swedish legislator overlooked these aspects of the sui generis right, creating legal uncertainties when interpreting and applying the national legislation. The study concludes with a look forward and suggestions for future research...|$|E
