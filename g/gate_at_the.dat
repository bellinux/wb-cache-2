5|$|Another {{theory is}} that Madeleine, nearly four at the time, left the {{apartment}} by herself, perhaps to look for her parents, and was abducted by a passer-by or fell {{into one of the}} open construction sites nearby. This is widely regarded as unlikely. According to her mother, Madeleine would have had to open the unlocked patio doors, close the curtains behind her, close the door again, open and close the child <b>gate</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> top of the stairs, then open and close the gate leading to the street.|$|E
5|$|At 20:30 {{the parents}} left 5A to dine {{with their friends}} in the Ocean Club's open-air tapas {{restaurant}}, located {{on the other side}} of the pool. 5A lay about 55 metres (160ft) from the restaurant as the crow flies, but getting to the restaurant involved walking along a public street to reach the doors of the Ocean Club resort, then walking through the resort to the other side of the pool, a distance of about 82 metres (295ft). The top of the apartment was visible from the tapas restaurant, but not the doors. The patio doors could be locked only from the inside, so the McCanns left them closed but unlocked, with the curtains drawn, so they could let themselves in that way when checking on the children. There was a child-safety <b>gate</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> top of the steps from the patio and a low <b>gate</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bottom, which led to the street.|$|E
5|$|By the 16th {{century the}} castle was 'tending to ruin', and {{following}} his {{victory in the}} English Civil War Oliver Cromwell decreed its destruction in 1655, a process which was completed within a fortnight. The castle had stood on the main route from Bristol to London, and following its destruction a commercial avenue opened along Castle Street from the mediaeval city towards Old Market. The demolition of Lawford's <b>Gate</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> eastern end of Old Market Street extended this into West Street, creating an uninterrupted route into the bustling heart of Bristol.|$|E

5|$|The Chicago Union Stock Yards Fire {{started on}} December 22, 1910, {{destroying}} $400,000 {{of property and}} killing twenty-one firemen, including the Fire Marshal James J. Horan. Fifty engine companies and seven hook and ladder companies fought the fire until it was declared extinguished by Chief Seyferlich on December 23. In 2004, a memorial to all Chicago firefighters who {{have died in the}} line of duty was erected just behind the Union Stock Yards <b>Gate</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> intersection of Exchange Avenue and Peoria Street.|$|E
5|$|The {{ground floor}} of the monastery is where ritual dances are performed. The walls of the monastery also have a profusion of thangkas of Buddhist deities and saints. Curtains are {{suspended}} over the balcony and these are painted with Buddhist symbols. Within the precincts of the monastery there are residential buildings to accommodate about 700 monks, which now houses 450 monks. The abbot of the monastery resides in a house located near the <b>gate</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> southeastern corner of the monastery.|$|E

Alternatively, if the party used the Epoch to break Lavos's outer shell, Marle will help her father hang Nadia's bell at the festival and accidentally get carried away by several balloons. Crono jumps on to help her, but cannot bring them down to earth. Hanging on in each other's arms, the pair travel through the cloudy, moonlit sky.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{completion}} of the project's first phase, the vicinity around the Wazir Khan mosque had been encroached upon by illegally erected shops which blocked off much of the mosque from the surrounding neighborhood. Tangled power lines further spoiled views of the mosque, and the Wazir Khan Chowk had been badly neglected and had shrunk in size due to illegally constructed shops. The {{first phase of the}} project removed illegally constructed shops, restoring views of the mosque. Wazir Khan Chowk was extensively rehabilitated by removal of encroachments, while the well of Dina Nath was restored. Power lines along the project corridor were also placed underground, and the Chitta <b>Gate</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> eastern entrance to Wazir Khan Chowk was rehabilitated.|$|E
5|$|The Arch of Caracalla {{is one of}} Volubilis' most {{distinctive}} sights, situated {{at the end of}} the city's main street, the Decumanus Maximus. Although it is not architecturally outstanding, the triumphal arch forms a striking visual contrast with the smaller Tingis <b>Gate</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> far end of the decumanus. It was built in 217 by the city's governor, Marcus Aurelius Sebastenus, to honour the emperor Caracalla and his mother Julia Domna. Caracalla was himself a North African and had recently extended Roman citizenship to the inhabitants of Rome's provinces. However, by the time the arch was finished both Caracalla and Julia had been murdered by a usurper.|$|E
5|$|The {{internal}} unrest {{reached its}} most serious {{stage in the}} two civil wars or marches upon Rome by the consul Lucius Cornelius Sulla {{at the beginning of}} 82 BC. In the Battle of the Colline <b>Gate</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> very door of the city of Rome, a Roman army under Sulla bested an army of the Roman senate and its Samnite allies. Whatever the merits of his grievances against those in power of the state, his actions marked a watershed of the willingness of Roman troops to wage war against one another that was {{to pave the way for}} the wars of the triumvirate, the overthrowing of the Senate as the de facto head of the Roman state, and the eventual endemic usurpation of power by contenders for the emperor-ship in the later Empire.|$|E

5|$|The {{internal}} unrest {{reached its}} most serious state, however, {{in the two}} civil wars that were caused by the clash between generals Gaius Marius and Lucius Cornelius Sulla starting from 88 BC. In the Battle of the Colline <b>Gate</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> very door {{of the city of}} Rome, a Roman army under Sulla bested an army of the Marius supporters and entered the city. Sulla's actions marked a watershed in the willingness of Roman troops to wage war against one another that was {{to pave the way for}} the wars which ultimately overthrew the Republic, and caused the founding of the Roman Empire.|$|E
5|$|The {{terminal}} {{consists of}} a single building, with an integrated control tower, capable of handling 120passengers per hour. The facade is covered in Russian larch; the focus on wood as a dominant material was common for Norwegian architecture the 1990s, and is also seen at Oslo Airport, Gardermoen (opened in 1998) and for the venues of the 1994 Winter Olympics. The terminal was designed by Alta-based architect Solveig Thorsen and is shaped like an aircraft wing, similar to the terminal building at Gardermoen. There is a single <b>gate</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> airport, which prior to the installation of security control was 17steps from the entrance.|$|E
5|$|Each of the game's worlds feature eight main levels, with a boss {{appearing}} {{at the end}} of every fourth and eighth level. Hidden throughout each of these levels are five Flowers and twenty Red Coins, the latter of which are hidden behind specific coins in each level. Collecting Flowers adds flowers to the <b>gate</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of each level (not including boss levels). If the player manages to land on an open flower after jumping through the end gate, they can play a bonus game during which they can earn extra lives or bonus items that can be activated from the pause menu, such as additional stars or maginifying glasses that reveal the location of hidden Red Coins. At the end of each level, players receive a score based on how many Flowers and Red Coins they found, as well as how many stars they have remaining, with a maximum score of 100 awarded for finding all Flowers and Red Coins and ending the level with 30 stars. Completing all levels in a world with a score of 100 unlocks two additional levels for that world.|$|E
