The division split, with one half marching south towards Basse-Terre and the other north. Neither met serious opposition, the militia forces deserting in large numbers and abandoning their fortifications as the British approached. Messages were sent by the approaching British ordering the surrender of towns and forts, and both forces made rapid progress over the following two days. On 30 January, Ernouf took up a position with his remaining garrison in the Beaupère–St. Louis Ridge highlands that guarded the approaches to Basse-Terre, Hislop forming his men in front of Ernouf's position. Later in the day, Harcourt's men came ashore to the north of Basse-Terre, outflanking the strongest French positions at Trois-Rivières and forcing their withdrawal to Basse-Terre itself.|$|E
5|$|Barnes {{was born}} in the Small Heath area of Birmingham, in the shadow of St Andrew's, the home stadium of Birmingham City. Support for Birmingham City ran in the family; his uncle played for the club in the 1920s. In 1943, aged 14, he began work at the Post Office. He played {{football}} for the works team, and quickly received an invitation to play for Moor Green, one of the strongest amateur teams in the area. His performances for Moor Green resulted in interest from Birmingham City, and Barnes became part of their junior team, Birmingham City Colts. Barnes worked at the Post Office during the day, trained with Moor Green <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening,</b> <b>and</b> played for Birmingham City Colts at the weekend. However, the Colts stopped selecting Barnes after a clash of matches, in which Barnes chose to play for a local team instead of the Colts. Barnes then resumed playing for Moor Green.|$|E

Approximately a thousand people attended anniversary masses there in both 1991 and 1999, with about 400 attending in 2007, and thousands come to her grave each year, including chartered buses from New Orleans.|$|E
40|$|Motivated by {{a recent}} {{experiment}} on the bilayer Y 1 -x Cax Ba 2 Cu 3 Oy superconductor and based on a bilayer t-J model, we calculate the spin susceptibility at different doping densities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>even</b> <b>and</b> odd channels <b>in</b> a bilayer system. It is found that the intensity of <b>the</b> resonance peak <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>even</b> channel is much weaker than that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> odd one, with the resonance position being at a higher frequency. While this difference decreases as the doping increases, both the position and amplitude of <b>the</b> resonance peaks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two channels are very similar <b>in</b> <b>the</b> deeply overdoped sample. Moreover, <b>the</b> resonance frequency <b>in</b> <b>the</b> odd channel {{is found to be}} linear with the critical temperature Tc, while the resonance frequency increases as doping decreases <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>even</b> channel <b>and</b> tends to saturate at the underdoped sample.

5|$|DST's {{potential}} {{to save energy}} comes primarily from its effects on residential lighting, which consumes about 3.5% of electricity in the United States and Canada. Delaying the nominal time of sunset and sunrise reduces the use of artificial light <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening</b> <b>and</b> increases it in the morning. As Franklin's 1784 satire pointed out, lighting costs are reduced if the evening reduction outweighs the morning increase, as in high-latitude summer when most people wake up well after sunrise. An early goal of DST was to reduce evening usage of incandescent lighting, once a primary use of electricity. Although energy conservation remains an important goal, energy usage patterns have greatly changed since then, and recent research is limited and reports contradictory results. Electricity use is greatly affected by geography, climate, and economics, {{making it hard to}} generalize from single studies.|$|E
5|$|Kitti's hog-nosed bat has a brief {{activity}} period, leaving its roost {{for only}} 30 minutes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening</b> <b>and</b> 20 minutes at dawn. These short flights are easily interrupted by heavy rain or cold temperatures. During this period, the bat forages within fields of cassava and kapok {{or around the}} tops of bamboo clumps and teak trees, within one kilometre of the roosting site. The wings seem to be shaped for hovering flight, and the gut contents of specimens include spiders and insects that are presumably gleaned off foliage. Nevertheless, most prey is probably caught in flight. Main staples of the bat's diet include small flies (Chloropidae, Agromyzidae, and Anthomyiidae), hymenopterans, and psocopterans.|$|E
5|$|On occasion, the {{convection}} of {{the system}} would flare up, {{and in the early}} morning hours of November 3, the Naval Air Station at Boca Chica, Florida reported winds of 50mph (80km/h), which would mean the depression may have attained tropical storm status. A similar report was filed at the Air Force Station at Cudjoe Key. After another reconnaissance flight was sent out to study the system, and recorded that surface area temperatures had dropped, the flight-level winds had reached 92mph (147km/h) and the surface area pressure had reached 998millibars (29.47 inHg). <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening</b> <b>and</b> overnight hours of November 3, the tropical depression continued to the northeast, making landfall in Florida at a location near Tampa Bay.

5|$|Warwick's army heavily outnumbered Edward's, {{although}} sources {{differ on}} exact numbers. Lancastrian strength ranges from 10,000–30,000 men, with 7,000–15,000 on the Yorkist side. Facing this disadvantage, Edward hurried {{to meet the}} Lancastrians with a surprise attack. He brought Henry VI along to prevent the Lancastrians from retaking their king. Edward reached Barnet <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening,</b> <b>and</b> without knowing the precise location of his foes, prepared the battle line.

5|$|Counter-attacks by the 4th Guards Division, {{reinforced}} by {{a battalion of}} the 220th Division, forced the 6th Canadian Infantry Brigade back to the start line.

On the evening of 21 August, three parties went forward to bomb the German position from the flanks but were only moderately successful. An additional attack planned for 22 August failed to materialize, due to battalion-level misunderstandings. A brigade reserve unit was ordered to remedy the situation by attacking a slagheap called Green Crassier and the mine complex at Fosse St. Louis. The attack was repulsed, with the majority of the attackers being killed, wounded or taken prisoner. The Germans held on to the area until the beginning of the final German retreat in 1918.|$|E
5|$|In a {{biological}} symbiosis one organism typically shores up some weakness or deficiency of the other(s). As {{in such a}} symbiosis, Odin the father of all humans and gods, though in human form was imperfect by himself. As a separate entity he lacked depth perception (being one-eyed) and he was apparently also uninformed and forgetful. But his weaknesses were compensated by his ravens, Hugin (mind) and Munin (memory) {{who were part of}} him. They perched on his shoulders and reconnoitered {{to the ends of the}} earth each day to return <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening</b> <b>and</b> tell him the news. He also had two wolves at his side, and the man/god-raven-wolf association was like one single organism in which the ravens were the eyes, mind, and memory, and the wolves the providers of meat and nourishment.

I wondered if the Odin myth was a metaphor that playfully and poetically encapsulates ancient knowledge of our prehistoric past as hunters in association with two allies to produce a powerful hunting alliance. It would reflect a past that we have long forgotten and whose meaning has been obscured and badly frayed as we abandoned our hunting cultures to become herders and agriculturists, to whom ravens act as competitors.|$|E
40|$|Phenotypic {{records of}} within-year {{spawning}} date in two cultivated populations of coho salmon, named as <b>even</b> (n= 2272) <b>and</b> odd (n= 1347) year classes are analyzed. Both populations {{were selected for}} harvest weight and early spawning for four generations, using independent culling levels. Hat-vest weight was selected using breeding values obtained from an animal model in males and females, while early spawning was selected phenotypically only in females. A post-selection analysis to estimate breeding values in both characters allowed comparison of the phenotypic response (R) and genetic selection response (GR) to selection for early spawning, narrow sense heritability (h(2)), and genetic Correlation with harvest weight (r(g)). Mean spawning dates were 13 and 15 days earlier after four generations of selection <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>even</b> <b>and</b> odd year class, respectively. This represents a phenotypic response to selection of - 2. 74 +/- 0. 7 (P = 0. 03) and - 3. 23 +/- 1. 3 (P = 0. 09) days per generation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>even</b> <b>and</b> odd year classes, respectively. The heritability estimates, by regression of the selection differential on phenotypic change, were h(2) = 1. 78 +/- 0. 37 (P < 0. 05) for <b>the</b> <b>even</b> year class <b>and</b> h(2) = 1. 90 +/- 0. 42 (P < 0. 05) for the odd year class. In both cases, calculated values were greater than the highest possible value for heritability (h(2) = 1) which indicates that the response is overestimated due to a positive environmental effect which was not quantified. The estimates of narrow sense heritability using an animal model were high in both populations (even year class h(2) = 0. 40 +/- 0. 05, odd year class h(2) = 0. 44 +/- 0. 06). Breeding value analysis showed the genetic selection response was - 0. 62 and - 1. 13 days per generation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>even</b> <b>and</b> odd year classes, respectively. The genetic correlation between spawning date and harvest weight was low in both year classes (even r(g) = 0. 25 +/- 0. 13; odd r(g) = - 0. 02 +/- 0. 24). The genetic selection differentials (GS) were lower in males than in females (even year class GS(f) = - 1. 12 y GS(m) = - 0. 13; odd year class GS(f) = - 1. 46; GS(m) = - 0. 36), which reflects selection practiced only on females...|$|R

A baronial army led by Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Hertford, laid siege to the castle on 17 April that year. Having marched from the earl's castle to Tonbridge the army {{attacked}} from the Rochester side of the river, either the south or west. While the army advanced towards the city the royalist garrison set alight the suburbs. The king's hall within the castle was also burned down, although it is unclear why. An army under Simon de Montfort marched from London {{with the intention of}} attacking the city from another direction. The earl's first two attempts to cross the Medway were fought back, but he was successful on 18April, Good Friday. The method used is uncertain, although it involved a fire-ship. The smoke may have been used as cover for the rebels, or the ship may have been used to burn the bridge while the army travelled by water.
