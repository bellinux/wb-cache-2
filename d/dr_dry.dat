Preliminary observations by <b>Dr.</b> <b>Dry</b> and myself suggested that orderly relations existed between the fibre type arrays on the back and britch positions.

40|$|The {{original}} {{purpose of the}} present thesis was to answer this question: "To what extent is a britch of high halo-hair abundance an indicator of the non-kemp hairiness of the fleece?" It was assumed by <b>Dr</b> <b>Dry</b> in the light of earlier observations, that, on a britch with very many halo-hairs, the large Curly Tip fibres would be very hairy, and this has proved to be so. Especially did we want to learn about the degree of hairiness {{on the part of the}} fleece near to the britch. The gradient over the body from the britch was also much in mind, all the more because the boundary between the area on the britch with very many halo hairs and the neighbouring region with far fewer halo hairs is often abrupt. The aim of the work was that just defined, but the analysis of the samples examined provided information on a number of other matters, several of which may be thought more interesting than the problem proposed at the outset.

40|$|Field {{trials were}} carried out during 1999 - 2003 in {{southern}} Sweden in order to evaluate the effect of anaerobically digested, source separated food waste originating from households as fertiliser in cereal pro-duction.

40|$|Recent {{development}} of “dry” dilution refrigerators has used mechanical cryocoolers and Joule–Thomson expansion stages to cool and liquefy the circulating ^ 3 He. While {{this approach has}} been highly successful, we propose three alternative designs that use independently-cooled condensers. In the first, the circulating helium is precooled by a mechanical cooler, and liquified by self-contained ^ 4 He sorption coolers. In the second, the helium is liquefied by a closed-cycle, continuous flow ^ 4 He refrigerator operating from a room temperature pump. Finally, the third scheme uses a separate ^ 4 He Joule–Thomson stage to cool the ^ 3 He condenser. The condensers in all these schemes are analogous to the “ 1 -K pot” in a conventional dilution refrigerator. Such an approach would be advantageous in certain applications, such as instrumentation for astronomy and particle physics experiment, where a thermal stage at approximately 1 K would allow an alternative heat sink to the still for electronics and radiation shielding, or quantum computer research where {{a large number of}} coaxial cables must be heat sunk in the cryostat. Furthermore, the behaviour of such a refrigerator is simplified due to the separation of the condenser stage from the dilution circuit, removing the complex interaction between the 4 -K, Joule–Thomson, still and mixing chamber stages found in current <b>dry</b> <b>DR</b> designs. ...|$|R
40|$|For {{experiments}} at sub-Kelvin temperatures, researchers usually {{work with}} Helium- 3, 4 dilution refrigerators (DR).

These so-called <b>dry</b> <b>DRs</b> {{consist of a}} two-stage pulse tube cryocooler, a Helium- 3, 4 dilution unit and an intermediate Joule-Thomson cooling stage. In our new design, the circulating Helium- 3 of the DR was precooled by the PTR in three heat exchangers to a temperature of about 2. 5 K, and then directly run to the flow restriction of the dilution unit without further precooling. These three heat exchangers were attached at the first stage, at the second regenerator, and at {{the second stage of}} the PTR. An important feature of the PTR was utilized, namely the excess refrigeration capacity of its second stage regenerator, which can be used without impairing the cooling capacity and the base temperature of the second stage. The precooling temperature of 2. 5 K was low enough to operate a DR. Temperature sensors were placed in all critical locations of the cryostat. We give details of the temperature profile of the cryostat, and present cooling capacity data of the DR.

60|$|Dr. Lincecum of Texan fame {{has even}} {{improved}} upon Solomon by his discovery of those still {{more interesting and}} curious creatures, the agricultural ants of Texas. America is essentially a farming country, and the agricultural ants are born farmers. They make regular clearings around their nests, and on these clearings they allow nothing to grow except {{a particular kind of}} grain, known as ant-rice. Dr. Lincecum maintains that the tiny farmers actually sow and cultivate the ant-rice. Dr. McCook, on the other hand, is of opinion that the rice sows itself, and that the insects' part is limited to preventing any other plants or weeds from encroaching on the appropriated area. In any case, be they squatters or planters, it is certain that the rice, when ripe, is duly harvested, and that it is, to say the least, encouraged by the ants, to the exclusion of all other competitors. 'After the maturing and harvesting of the seed,' says <b>Dr.</b> Lincecum, 'the <b>dry</b> stubble is cut away and removed from the pavement, which is thus left fallow until the ensuing autumn, when the same species of grass, and in the same circle, appears again, and receives the same agricultural care as did the previous crop.'

40|$|The <b>dry</b> {{reforming}} (<b>DR)</b> is {{a promising}} technology for utilization of greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, to produce synthesis gas for downstream synthesis of valuable chemicals and fuels. In this study, equilibrium of <b>DR</b> and autothermal <b>dry</b> reforming (ATDR) of vegetable oils was investigated by Gibbs free energy minimization method. The effects of various process variables of DR and ATDR of vegetable oils such as temperature (673 – 1273 [*]K), carbon dioxide-to-carbon mole ratio (CCMR) (0. 5 – 3. 0), and oxygen-to-carbon mole ratio (OCMR) (0 – 1. 0) were studied to obtain equilibrium products composition, thermodynamically promising operating conditions, and thermoneutral {{conditions of the}} process. The study revealed that insignificant amount of coke and compounds containing two or more carbon atoms were formed for both DR and ATDR of vegetable oils. The hydrogen yield was found to increase with increase in temperatures for DR of vegetable oil. At temperature 983 K and above, the hydrogen yield was found to increase with CCMR, reach maxima, and then decrease with further increase in CCMR. The carbon dioxide conversion and yield of CO and water were increased and yield of methane was decreased with increase in temperature. The yield of CO and water were increased and the conversion {{of carbon dioxide and}} yield of methane were decreased with increase of CCMR. For ATDR of vegetable oils, the reduced yield of CO and methane and enhanced yield of water and hydrogen (up to temperature of maximum hydrogen yield) were observed compared to that of DR. From critical analysis of the results of DR and ATDR of vegetable oil, the optimum conditions for maximum yield of hydrogen with very low yield of methane were determined as 1000 – 1050 [*]K, CCMR of about 1, and oxygen-to-carbon mole ratio of 0. 6 – 0. 7.

60|$|As Professor Asa Gray has {{expressed}} {{his belief that}} this species and L. acuminata, {{as well as some}} species in the allied genus Drymispermum, are dimorphic or heterostyled (3/15. 'American Journal of Science' 1865 page 101 and Seemann's 'Journal of Botany' volume 3 1865 page 305.), I procured from Kew, through the kindness of <b>Dr.</b> Hooker, two <b>dried</b> flowers of the former species, an inhabitant of the Friendly Islands in the Pacific. The pistil of the long-styled form is to that of the short-styled as 100 to 86 in length; the stigma projects just above the throat of the corolla, and is surrounded by five anthers, the tips of which reach up almost to its base; and lower down, within the tubular corolla, five other and rather smaller anthers are seated. In the short-styled form, the stigma stands some way down the tube of the corolla, nearly on a level with the lower anthers of the other form: it differs remarkably from the stigma of the long-styled form, in being more papillose, and in being longer in the ratio of 100 to 60. The anthers of the upper stamens in the short-styled form are supported on free filaments, and project above the throat of the corolla, whilst the anthers of the lower stamens are seated in the throat on a level with the upper stamens of the other form. The diameters of a considerable number of grains from both sets of anthers in both forms were measured, but they did not differ in any trustworthy degree. The mean diameter of twenty-two grains from the short-styled flower was to that of twenty-four grains from the long-styled, as 100 to 99. The anthers of the upper stamens in the short-styled form appeared to be poorly developed, and contained a considerable number of shrivelled grains which were omitted in striking the above average. Notwithstanding the fact of the pollen-grains from the two forms not differing in diameter in any appreciable degree, there can hardly be a doubt from the great difference in the two forms in the length of the pistil, and especially of the stigma, together with its more papillose condition in the short-styled form, that the present species is truly heterostyled. This case resembles that of Linum grandiflorum, in which the sole difference between the two forms consists in the length of the pistils and stigmas. From the great length of the tubular corolla of Leucosmia, {{it is clear that the}} flowers are cross-fertilised by large Lepidoptera or by honey-sucking birds, and the position of the stamens in two whorls one beneath the other, which is a character that I have not seen in any other heterostyled dimorphic plant, probably serves to smear the inserted organ thoroughly with pollen.|$|R
40|$|In 2006 {{the global}} demand for primary energy {{amounted}} to nearly 12 {{million tons of}} oil equivalent (Mtoe), to a large extent (over 80 %) supplied by fossil fuels, i. e. coal, oil, and natural gas. According to the scenario suggested by the International Energy Agency (IEA), energy demand will rise in 2030 to about 17 Mtoe. Fossil fuels will remain largely dominant. Over 70 % of the expected demand for the period 2008 - 2030 will be due to the developing countries (China, India, Middle East, Africa, Latin America). Approximately 50 % of this energy demand will involve the generation of electricity, but a significant proportion (20 %) will be linked to the transport sector, while the remaining 30 % will be distributed between industry, services and residential use. Obviously, predictions of growth in energy demand suggested some problems: if the availability of primary sources, mainly fossil fuels, will be sufficient to meet the demand in quantity, quality and distribution; whether the progressive increase in the use of fossil sources will be compatible with environmentally sustainable development, what role other sources of energy such as nuclear and renewables can play in the future landscape and economical development?. In this scenario, the hydrogen plays a key role as an energy carrier. But the hydrogen is not available in its free form; hydrogen atoms are only available linked to other natural resources, and it must extracted somehow. Currently, most of the hydrogen on the planet is produced by steam reforming of methane, as it is the most abundant gas among the fossil fuels, at an acceptable cost and easily available through the dense network of distribution (pipelines). However, there are also other techniques of syngas production such as the partial oxidation (CPOX), the oxy steam reforming (OSR), which has the characteristic of being able to be made autothermal (ATR) and the <b>dry</b> reforming (<b>DR).</b> The <b>dry</b> reforming is particularly interesting because it uses as a reagent mixture methane and carbon dioxide, two gases with particular heavy greenhouse effect. In this regard the biogas (mixture of carbon dioxide and methane), produced by anaerobic digestion basically from biomass, is particularly suitable for this process since it allows avoiding the preventive separation of CO 2 from methane in the production process of syngas. The main aim of this doctoral thesis is the study of the process of syngas production from methane and biogas on catalysts supported on ceramic monoliths made of cordierite, using the steam reforming (SR) process and oxy-steam reforming (OSR) process. The tests were carried out in collaboration with the Institute of Advanced Techniques for Energy "Nicola Giordano" (CNR -ITAE) in Messina (Italy). This thesis is constituted by an introductory part that covers topics related to the production and storage of hydrogen (Chapter 1, "Introduction"); a central part which describes the pilot plant used to carry on tests on steam reforming and oxy steam reforming of methane and biogas, and the preparation of the various tested structured catalysts (Chapter 2, "Experimental part"); and a final part which consists of four papers describing the various experimental works carried out (Chapters 3 to 6). Finally, conclusions on the work done are reported (Chapter 7, "Conclusions"). Chapter 3, "Methane oxy-steam reforming reaction: performances of Ru/γ-Al 2 O 3 catalysts loaded on structured cordierite monoliths", reports the process of production of syngas via oxy-steam reforming of methane on Ru structured catalyst supported on γ-Al 2 O 3 as carrier. In particular, the influence of the catalyst loading, the influence of the O/C and S/C ratios, the influence of the reaction temperature and the space velocity, were specifically addressed. Chapter 4, "Syngas production by methane oxy-steam reforming: performance of Me/CeO 2 (Me = Rh, Pt, Ni) catalyst lined on cordierite monoliths", presents the process of production of syngas via oxy-steam reforming comparing the performances of three structured catalysts, based on noble and non-noble metals (Rh, Pt and Ni) supported on CeO 2 as carrier, focusing on the comparison of the influence of reaction temperature and space velocity on the reactor performance. Chapter 5, "Comparative Study on Steam and Oxydative Steam Reforming of Methane with Ru and Rh Based Catalysts supported on Cordierite Monoliths", shows the comparison between the processes of steam reforming and oxy-steam reforming of methane on two structured catalysts (Ru/γ-Al 2 O 3 and Rh/CeO 2). The two different processes on the two catalysts were studied separately, and then compared. Moreover, an energy requirement discussion on the two processes was addresses (with the support of a series of Aspen Plus® simulations), with specific reference to the energy required for the vaporization of water (the only liquid reagent), and the energy required by the reforming reaction with respect to the moles of methane fed to the process. Chapter 6, "Biogas Steam and Oxy-Steam Reforming processes over structured catalysts based on Me/CeO 2 (Me = Rh, Pt, Ni) coated on cordierite monoliths", describes the comparison between the processes of steam reforming and oxy-steam reforming of biogas on three structured catalysts, based on noble and non-noble metals (Rh, Pt and Ni) supported on CeO 2 as carrier. At the time of the submission of the present doctoral thesis to the external Commission, December 2013, the first paper, presented on Chapter 3, has been submitted to the peer reviewed "International Journal of Hydrogen Energy" (manuscript nr. HE-S- 13 - 04515 - 2), while the other three papers, Chapters 4 to 6, are almost ready for the submission to other international peer reviewed journals ("Applied Catalysis B: Environment", "Applied Energy", and "Industrial Engineering and Chemistry Research"...|$|R
