50|$|In {{the early}} days of the site, LacusCurtius was often the only English source online for a number of the primary texts {{presented}} by Thayer. The English translations, and usually the Greek or Latin originals, were not scanned, but transcribed manually from Loeb Classical Library editions that had entered public domain, and less often from other sources. Though many of these primary texts could after a decade be found elsewhere on the web, Thayer's versions feature <b>enhanced</b> <b>functionalities.</b> They provide direct word-links to terms in Smith's Dictionary and other secondary sources on LacusCurtius and elsewhere, and often link quoted or cited passages to the full text of other ancient sources. Thayer corrects typographical errors in the Loeb editions, with a note on the original error, and on occasion provides his own commentary to update his source material, most of which is near or more than a century old.|$|E

These defects correspond to high-energy configurations which are not energetically favorable under thermal equilibrium.

The details of the entire process including potential energy curves are given, which suggests {{the reliability of the}} proposed single-atom doping method.|$|E

In ejection operations, we unload targeted weirs by displacing microparticles from their capture faces via electrode activation. In exclusion-based operations, we prevent weir loading by activating selected on-chip electrodes before introducing microparticles into the system. Our work describes the device’s passive loading dynamics and demonstrates <b>enhanced</b> <b>functionalities</b> by forming a variety of particle patterns. National Institutes of Health (U. S.)

30|$|We are {{assisting}} {{a growing}} demand of RFID systems with <b>enhanced</b> <b>functionalities,</b> including accurate localization and sensing, {{while maintaining the}} cost of the tag as low as possible [3, 4]. Localization capability of tags can be obtained through the exploitation of the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) or phase estimates [5]. The former does not offer good accuracies due to the unpredictable nature of the wireless fading phenomenon, whereas the latter suffers from phase ambiguity and clutter interference (i.e., the part of the interrogation signal backscattered by the surrounding environment). Other recent solutions exploit radically new technologies such as ultrawide bandwidth (UWB) [6 – 8].|$|E

We find that the diode behavior is greatly tuned with external gate potentials, Zeeman splittings or lead magnetizations.
