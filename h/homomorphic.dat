25|$|There are {{at least}} two {{structurally}} equivalent formal definitions of quasigroup. One defines a quasigroup as a set with one binary operation, and the other, from universal algebra, defines a quasigroup as having three primitive operations.

25|$|The semilattice part of {{the result}} above is {{achieved}} via an infinitary semilattice-theoretical statement URP (Uniform Refinement Property). If we want to disprove Schmidt's problem, the idea is (1) to prove that any generalized Boolean semilattice satisfies URP (which is easy), (2) that URP is preserved under <b>homomorphic</b> image under a weakly distributive homomorphism (which is also easy), and (3) that there exists a distributive (∨,0)-semilattice of cardinality ℵ2 that does not satisfy URP (which is difficult, and uses Kuratowski's Free Set Theorem).|$|E
25|$|In general, {{arbitrary}} direct sums {{and direct}} limits of flat modules are flat, {{a consequence of}} the fact that the tensor product commutes with direct sums and direct limits (in fact with all colimits), and that both direct sums and direct limits are exact functors. Submodules and factor modules of flat modules need not be flat in general (e.g. Z/nZ is not a flat Z-module for n>1). However we have the following result: the <b>homomorphic</b> image of a flat module M is flat if and only if the kernel is a pure submodule of M.|$|E

2500|$|Another method uses unit quaternions. Multiplication of {{rotation}} matrices is <b>homomorphic</b> to multiplication of quaternions, and multiplication by a unit quaternion rotates the unit sphere.

2500|$|A subalgebra of a {{power set}} algebra is called a field of sets; {{equivalently}} a field of sets {{is a set of}} subsets of some set W including the empty set and W and closed under finite union and complement with respect to W (and hence also under finite intersection). Birkhoff's [...] representation theorem for Boolean algebras states that every Boolean algebra is isomorphic to a field of sets. Now Birkhoff's HSP theorem for varieties can be stated as, every class of models of the equational theory of a class C of algebras is the <b>Homomorphic</b> image of a Subalgebra of a direct Product of algebras of C. Normally all three of H, S, and P are needed; what the first of these two Birkhoff theorems shows is that for the special case of the variety of Boolean algebras Homomorphism can be replaced by Isomorphism. Birkhoff's HSP theorem for varieties in general therefore becomes Birkhoff's ISP theorem for the variety of Boolean algebras.|$|E
2500|$|The finite {{elements}} F of *R form a local ring, {{and in fact}} a valuation ring, with the unique maximal ideal S being the infinitesimals; the quotient F/S is isomorphic to the reals. Hence we have a <b>homomorphic</b> mapping, st(x), from F to R whose kernel consists of the infinitesimals and which sends every element x of F to a unique real number whose difference from x is in S; which is to say, is infinitesimal. Put another way, every finite nonstandard real number is [...] "very close" [...] to a unique real number, {{in the sense that}} if x is a finite nonstandard real, then there exists one and only one real number st(x) such that xnbsp&ndash&nbsp&st(x) is infinitesimal. This number st(x) is called the standard part of x, conceptually the same as x to the nearest real number.

2500|$|In {{line with}} David Bohm's approach, Basil Hiley and {{mathematician}} Maurice de Gosson {{showed that the}} quantum potential {{can be seen as}} a consequence of a projection of an underlying structure, more specifically of a non-commutative algebraic structure, onto a subspace such as ordinary space (-space). In algebraic terms, the quantum potential {{can be seen as a}}rising from the relation between implicate and explicate orders: if a non-commutative algebra is employed to describe the non-commutative structure of the quantum formalism, it turns out that it is impossible to define an underlying space, but that rather [...] "shadow spaces" [...] (<b>homomorphic</b> spaces) can be constructed and that in so doing the quantum potential appears. The quantum potential approach can be seen as a way to construct the shadow spaces. The quantum potential thus results as a distortion due to the projection of the underlying space into -space, in similar manner as a Mercator projection inevitably results in a distortion in a geographical map. There exists complete symmetry between the -representation, and the quantum potential as it appears in configuration space can be seen as arising from the dispersion of the momentum -representation.|$|E

50|$|In 2010, Marten van Dijk, Craig Gentry, Shai Halevi and Vinod Vaikuntanathan {{presented}} a second fully <b>homomorphic</b> encryption scheme,which uses {{many of the}} tools of Gentry's construction, but which does not require ideal lattices.

The Levieil-Naccache scheme supports only additions, but it can be modified to also support a small number of multiplications.Many refinements and optimizations of the scheme of van Dijk et al. were proposed in a sequence of works by Jean-Sébastien Coron, Tancrède Lepoint, Avradip Mandal, David Naccache, and Mehdi Tibouchi.Some of these works included also implementations of the resulting schemes.|$|E
