25|$|Fluoride {{glass is}} {{a class of}} non-oxide optical quality glasses {{composed}} of fluorides of various metals.

Thus, although heavy metal <b>fluoride</b> <b>glasses</b> (HMFG) exhibit very low optical attenuation, they are not only difficult to manufacture, but are quite fragile, and have poor resistance to moisture and other environmental attacks. Their best attribute is that they lack the absorption band associated with the hydroxyl (OH) group (3,200–3,600cm−1; i.e., 2,777–3,125nm or 2.78–3.13 μm), which is present in nearly all oxide-based glasses.|$|E

50|$|A large {{variety of}} {{multicomponent}} <b>fluoride</b> <b>glasses</b> have been fabricated but few {{can be drawn}} into optical fiber. The fiber fabrication is similar to any glass-fiber drawing technology. All methods involve fabrication from the melt, which createsinherent problems such as the formation of bubbles, core-clad interface irregularities, and small preform sizes. The process occurs at 310 °C in a controlled atmosphere (to minimize contamination by moisture or oxygen impurities which significantlyweaken the fiber) using a narrow heat zone compared to silica. Drawing is complicated by a small difference (only 124 °C) between the glass transition temperature and the crystallization temperature. As a result, ZBLAN fibers often contain undesired crystallites. The concentration of crystallites was shown in 1998 to be reduced by growing ZBLAN in zero gravity (see figure) which reduces convection processes.|$|E
