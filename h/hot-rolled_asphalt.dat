40|$|X-ray {{computed}} tomography provides {{a powerful tool}} to analyse morphological information in porous materials like metallic foams. Additionally {{in some cases the}} composition can be quantified, which is performed exemplarily at porous asphalt pavement materials. In practice the dust infiltration is added to the 3 -phase standard mixture of <b>hot-rolled</b> <b>asphalt</b> consisting of mineral, binder and air. X-ray {{computed tomography}} measurements applied to open-pored noise reducing asphalt pavements will be presented. The results are completed with measurements of reproducibility and an estimation of uncertainty in the composition of the samples.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{researches}} {{have been done}} worldwide to evaluate {{the damage caused by}} water in bituminous pavements. The use of the retained strength ratios obtained from laboratory moisture damage tests is a useful tool in making quantitative predictions of the related damage caused by water. This study involved laboratory work on the effect of water on the performance of bituminous mixtures. Comparisons are made between the performances of <b>Hot-rolled</b> <b>Asphalt</b> (HRA) bituminous mixtures containing base bitumen of 50 pen grade to that of a polymer-fibre reinforced HRA mixture. Two types of polymer fibre were studied, namely polypropylene and polyester and these fibre were added in different concentrations in the bituminous mixtures. Changes in both the cohesive properties of the bitumen and the adhesion of the bitumen to the aggregate surface were observed as a result of exposing the bituminous mixtures to moisture. The effect of polymer fibre reinforcement in bituminous mixtures helps reduce the level of moisture damage. This was evident in the lower moisture susceptibility achieved in the polymer fibre reinforced bituminous mixtures as compared to the control mixture. The additional bitumen in the fibre reinforced mixtures also afforded an increased film thickness on the aggregate particles, thus affording additional protection of the mixtures from moisture. The reinforcement of polymer fibres in bituminous mixtures also acts to decrease the moisture sensitivity of the bitumen to aggregate bonding. This {{may be due to the}} strengthening of the wetted binder matrix that helps promote both adhesion and cohesion retention...|$|E
