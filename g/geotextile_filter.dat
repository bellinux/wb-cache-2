50|$|New {{drainage}} systems incorporate <b>geotextile</b> <b>filters</b> that retain and prevent fine grains of soil from passing into and clogging the drain. Geotextiles are synthetic textile fabrics specially manufactured for civil and environmental engineering applications.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Nonwoven {{geotextiles}} {{are commonly}} used in filtration applications. For some applications, however, a nonwoven <b>geotextile</b> <b>filter</b> {{may not have the}} required mechanical properties to withstand deformations, and an additional woven geotextile is usually employed in design. While reinforcement is an important function expected from these two-layer geotextile systems, filtration is another function that is critical for the long-term performance. Recent observations in <b>geotextile</b> <b>filter</b> design suggested that the filtration characteristics of these systems can be highly different than those of single-layer systems. A laboratory test program was undertaken to evaluate the filtration performance of four different woven/nonwoven geotextile combinations with fly ash and bottom-sea dredged sediments. For comparison, these geomaterials were also tested with two single-woven geotextiles. The results indicated that both fly ash and dredged sediments could be successfully filtered by a variety of woven geotextiles and nonwoven/woven combinations. Results also showed that use of a two-layer geotextile system, rather than a single-woven geotextile, significantly increased the filtration capacity. Higher amounts of fines accumulated at the sediment-geotextile interface than the fly ash-geotextile interfaces, indicating that geotextiles are more prone to clogging during filtering dredged sediments...|$|E

40|$|Suspended solids in {{stormwater}} runoff {{create a}} range of water quality problems; their removal lessens the deleterious impact of stormwater runoff on aquatic ecosystems. In this study, three geotextiles were tested in laboratory column tests with influent suspensions having hydraulic loading rates, total suspended solids (TSS) concentrations, and particle size distributions (PSDs) similar to those reported for urban highway stormwater runoff. After a short ripening period, the geotextile filters removed TSS from 100 - 200 mg/L to below a target concentration of 30 mg/L. A lower geotextile permittivity resulted in an increased percentage of TSS captured by the filter; however, the total mass of solids captured was unaffected because lower permittivity resulted in lower total solids loaded to the filter overall. In general, {{the effectiveness of the}} <b>geotextile</b> <b>filter</b> at retaining suspended solids increased as filter opening sizes decreased and as influent particle sizes increased. The hydraulic conductivity of a <b>geotextile</b> <b>filter,</b> which was related to TSS captured via a power function, was higher for geotextiles with higher permittivity and larger opening sizes and for larger influent particle sizes. Overall, the filter with the second highest permittivity (0. 8 s- 1), NW 2, was the most successful geotextile tested. TSS removal in the geotextile laboratory tests was comparable to reported values from sand filters in literature under similar loading conditions. Sand filters in laboratory tests had greater TSS removal than geotextile filters. However, the sand filters clogged at a lower total solids loading than the geotextiles. The applicability of existing filtration criteria for geotextiles for stormwater treatment is addressed, and four new retention criteria ratios specifically for stormwater filtration which use two filter opening sizes and two particle diameters, such as (095 /D 60) /(O 30 /D 10) > 0. 05, are introduced. Results from field testing are analyzed; the <b>geotextile</b> <b>filter</b> reduced TSS concentrations in runoff by an average of 84 % with input TSS event mean concentrations (EMCs) ranging from 22 - 185 mg/L and output EMCs ranging from 1. 7 - 22 mg/L.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{application}} of a surface, permeable reactive barrier has been implemented at a remote site in the Canadian Arctic for the remediation of soils and water contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} 2 {{applications}} of geotextiles in coastal and hydraulic engineering: <b>Geotextiles</b> in <b>filters</b> and revetments, and in sand filled structures. Geotextiles are often replacing granular filters. However, {{they have different}} properties than a granular filter. For a the application of geotextiles in revetments, {{the consequences of the}} different properties will be shown: How permeability is influenced by a geotextile and what can be the consequences of the weight differences between granular and <b>geotextile</b> <b>filters.</b> In another application, the <b>filter</b> properties of <b>geotextiles</b> are only secondary. In geotextile tubes and containers the geotextile is used as ‘wrapping material’ to create large units that will not erode during wave attack. The structures with geotextile tubes and containers serve as an alternative for rock based structures. The first of these structures were more or less constructed by trial and error, but research on the shape of the structures, the stability under wave attack and the durability of the used material has given the possibility to use design tools for these structures. Recently also the morphological aspects of these structures have been investi-gated. This is of importance because regularly structures with geotextile tubes fail due to insufficient toe protection against the scour hole that develops in front of the structure, leading to undermining of the structure. Recent research in the Delta Flume of Deltares and the Large Wave Flume in Hannover has led to better understanding what mechanisms determine the stability under wave attack. It is shown that therefore also the degree of filling is of importance and the position of the water level with respect to the tube has a large influence...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{series of}} {{filtration}} tests {{were performed to}} examine <b>geotextile</b> <b>filters</b> and internally unstable soils (broad and gap-graded soils) under non-steady state hy-draulic conditions. Eight different nonwoven geotextiles with four model soils and one natural soil were tested. It was observed that for broad and gap-graded soils the internal stability can be characterized by the coefficient of curvature, Cc, of the soil, and that these soils have a strong effect on the filtration performance of the soil/geotextile sys-tem. Soil piping failure was measured for some filtration systems for soils with a Cc greater than seven. The instantaneous application of a high hydraulic gradient only has a short-term influence on the filtration performance.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the use of {{nonwoven}} geotextiles and geocomposite drainage layers as moisture barriers in geotechnical applications where capillary flow is expected.

This study includes an evaluation of the material properties governing the hydraulic behavior of soils and geosynthetics in these applications, as well as an investigation of capillary rise using physical models of layered soil-geosynthetic systems. Capillary rise was observed to occur rapidly in a control model containing only soil, while capillary rise occurred more slowly when a nonwoven geotextile was placed between two soil layers. This is attributed to the low hydraulic conductivity of the geotextile when unsaturated. Capillary rise was prevented when using a geocomposite between two soil layers, due to the presence of an air gap in the geonet between the two <b>geotextiles.</b> <b>Filter</b> paper measurements indicate that negative water pressure is transmitted from the soil through the nonwoven geotextile, but not across the geocomposite...|$|R

40|$|Sediment {{control devices}} (SCDs) are {{critical}} to reducing the contamination of waterways from adjacent construction sites. Perimeter sediment controls retard the flow of surface runoff water originating on site and subsequently reduce solid, nutrient, and metal concentrations suspended in the flowing water. Silt fence is a commonly used SCD comprised of <b>geotextile</b> <b>filter</b> fabric, steel or wood support posts, and wire mesh reinforcement. The Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) uses an extensive amount of silt fence every year, and because of high degradation of geotextile in the field, the silt fence installations are rarely recycled. This research measures the performance of five SCDs (two types of silt fence, mulch berm, compost sock, and straw bales) at suspended solid, turbidity, nutrient, and metal reduction. A life cycle analysis (LCA) is performed to identify environmental impacts associated with material production, assembly, installation, use on site, and disposal. An impact analysis is performed according to for each SCD. Results of the impact analysis are compared to determine the SCD with lowest overall environmental impact. Results of the SCD performance study show that silt fence installations performed the best at reducing suspended solids and turbidity, mulch was best at reducing nutrients, and compost was the best at reducing metal concentrations.

40|$|Geotextile filters {{protecting}} {{drainage systems}} at oil sand mining operations must filter mixtures of heavy {{oil and water}} during construction of the oil sand plants and during operation of the mine. The filtration properties of seven non-woven geotextiles to water and oil were determined over a range of hydraulic gradients and confining pressures. The <b>geotextile</b> <b>filter</b> design criteria considered the grain size distribution, coefficient of uniformity, density and permeability of the sand surrounding the drainage systems and the apparent opening size, porosity and permeability of the geotextile filters. Permeability criteria, retention criteria and clogging criteria were examined for the non-woven fabrics. Geotextile filters for water and oil permeants should be made of fibers that are both hydrophobic (repelling water) and oleophobic (repelling oil) to provide a higher permeability for a given porosity. The environment {{in a mixture of}} heavy oil and water is aggressive. To meet the chemical environmental durability criterion, the fibers must be chemically compatible with the heavy oil fluid so that there is no significant change in pore size or reduction of permeability due to fiber swelling and degregation.

40|$|The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) {{recently}} completed a study to evaluate the performance of edge drain systems placed along portland cement concrete (PCC) pavements. To date, a variety of edge drain designs, backfill materials, and placement methods have been used and have resulted in {{varying degrees of success}} when measured against overall pavement performance. This study investigated several different types of edge drain systems that have been used by Caltrans. Their performance was evaluated, and it was observed that more than 70 percent of the surveyed edge drains were not performing efficiently or as designed. This poor overall result can be attributed to design flaws, improper construction practices, and lack of maintenance. Generally, the performance of originally constructed edge drains was better than retrofit projects, since originally constructed edge drains are generally equipped with larger diameter drain pipes, deeper trenches, and treated permeable bases. Edge drain trenches in retrofit projects are generally not deep enough to effectively collect all infiltrated water from the PCC and base layers. The <b>geotextile</b> <b>filter</b> fabric materials found in excavated projects are not soil-specific, which can cause clogging and eventually reduce the ability of these edge drains to allow free flow of water.

40|$|Maintenance of {{ballasted}} railway tracks {{is a major}} {{cost for}} railway infrastructure owners. In many developed countries, much of the railway infrastructure is mature and was built for service requirements long since superseded. The increased demands on historic infrastructure {{can lead to the}} development or exacerbation of localised trackbed problems that require disproportionate levels of maintenance. Identifying these and applying cost effective remediation has the potential to reduce maintenance spend in the long term. However, it is not always clear what the most cost effective remediation will be. One type of localised maintenance issue is the development of wet beds or wet spots, which can occur where saturated clayey subgrade soils are overloaded and result in the development of mud pumping as trains pass. This leads to the migration of fines into the ballast bed and a deterioration in local track performance. Over time the track overlying the wet bed settles disproportionately more, sleepers become progressively more voided, and train ride quality deteriorates. Maintenance of the wet bed may involve locally digging out and replacing the ballast; however, unless the underlying cause is addressed the problem is likely to recur, requiring repeated localised maintenance interventions. This is costly, reactive and ultimately an ineffective approach to managing the problem. This paper presents a study of a wet bed in the UK, both prior to and after a full track renewal. Transient track deflections during train passage were monitored using sleeper mounted geophones and high speed filming techniques. Loaded track geometry data were obtained from a track recording vehicle. It is shown that local maintenance interventions were generally ineffective, but that a renewal of the top 200 mm of the trackbed including placement of a <b>geotextile</b> <b>filter</b> and geogrid appears to have been successful in remediating the problem, {{at least in the short}} term...|$|E
40|$|Eutrophication, {{the rapid}} growth of blue green algae in surface water, has become an {{environmental}} issue worldwide. In Canada, it has been also identified as one of the leading risks to surface water quality especially lake water quality. Lake Caron, an artificial lake, located in the municipality of Saint-Anne Des Lacs, Quebec, has been suffering from eutrophication due to high concentrations of nutrients and chlorophyll α since 2008. The objectives of the study are to evaluate the water quality parameters of a eutrophic lake, to treat eutrophic lake water samples by filtration using non-woven geotextiles and hence evaluate the effectiveness of non-woven <b>geotextiles</b> as a <b>filter</b> media, and assess the relationship among various water quality parameters. To achieve these objectives, water samples from the lake were analysed for two consecutive years. Further, a small scale field experiment was conducted beside the lake by using non-woven <b>geotextiles</b> as <b>filter</b> media. Custom made geotextiles of distinct apparent opening sizes and materials (TE-GTX 300 – 110 µm, TE-GTN 300 – 90 µm, TE-GTN 350 – 90 µm and TE-GTN 340 - 75 µm) were used in different combinations to find the best combination providing maximum efficiency in removing nutrients and suspended solids to achieve acceptable level within shorter period of time. Several combinations of <b>geotextile</b> <b>filters</b> were tried for different initial turbidity range of lake water. For an initial turbidity ranging from 4 to 9 NTU, filtration with the combination of 2 layers of 110 μm (TE-GTX 300) followed by 3 layers of 90 μm (TE-GTN 350) showed the best result at 7 th day of filtration, whereas filtration with a filter media consisting of 2 layers of 110 μm (TE-GTX 300) and 3 layers of 75 μm (TE-GTN 340) geotextiles had been found to restore the water quality at the 3 rd day of filtration for an initial turbidity ranging from 9 to 14 NTU. The combination of 1 layer of 110 μm (TE-GTX 300) with 4 layers of 90 μm (TE-GTN 300) showed the best result at 2 nd day during filtration for an initial turbidity higher than 14 NTU. For the first two category (4 to 9 NTU and 9 to 14 NTU) the removal efficiencies were 66, 100 and 96 % for removing total P (TP), TSS and turbidity, respectively. For the remaining categories (14 to 19 NTU and higher than 19 NTU), the removal efficiencies were more than 90 % for TP and turbidity and more than 96 % efficiency had been found in case of TSS removal. TSS removal correlates with the reduction of turbidity, TP and COD concentration. Initial flow rates through the filter decrease with increasing number of filter layers and decreasing pore size of the filter media. A higher TSS decreases the flow rate through the filter and increases clogging. <b>Geotextiles</b> as a <b>filter</b> media have shown potential for improvement of surface water quality in terms of nutrients, turbidity and TSS removal...|$|R

He discussed the need for both adequate permeability and soil retention, along with adequate fabric strength and proper elongation and {{set the tone for}} geotextile use in filtration situations.|$|R
40|$|Eutrophication {{has been}} {{identified}} as one of the leading risks to surface water quality especially for lake water quality in Canada. The objective of the study is {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} nonwoven geotextiles in reducing the nutrients and suspended solids to improve lake water quality. A small scale field experiment was conducted beside a lake by using nonwoven <b>geotextiles</b> as <b>filter</b> media. Custom-made <b>geotextiles</b> were used in different combinations to provide maximum efficiency in removing nutrients and suspended solids (SS) to achieve an acceptable level within a shorter period of time. For an initial turbidity ranging from 4 to 9 NTU, 2 layers of 110 μm pore size filters with 3 layers of 90 μm pore size showed the best result at the 7 th day of filtration, whereas 2 layers of 110 μm pore size with 3 layers of 75 μm pore size geotextiles had been found to restore the water quality at the 3 rd day of filtration for an initial turbidity ranging from 9 to 14 NTU. The combination of 1 layer of 110 μm pore size with 4 layers of 90 μm pore size showed the best result at the 2 nd day during filtration for an initial turbidity higher than 14 NTU. TSS removal correlated with reduction of turbidity, TP and COD concentration. Initial flow rates through the filter decreased with an increase in filter layers and decrease in <b>filter</b> pore size. <b>Geotextiles</b> as <b>filter</b> media have shown potential for improvement of surface water quality in terms of nutrient and TSS removal...|$|R
