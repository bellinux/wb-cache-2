Philip Yeo countered his critics {{by pointing out that}} Biomedical manufacturing output had quadrupled from S$6billion in 2000 to S$23billion in the 5 years that the country had been investing in the sector. In that short period, the Biomedical industry grew to account for over 5% of Singapore's GDP and 10,600 <b>high</b> <b>value</b> <b>added</b> jobs. In addition, Yeo also pointed out that during the 5 years of investment, more than 25 companies started research centres in Singapore, including three corporate R laboratories run by Eli Lilly and Company, GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{development}} {{entails a}} modern infrastructure (both physical and institutional), and a {{move away from}} low value added sectors such as agriculture and natural resource extraction. Developed countries, in comparison, usually have economic systems based on continuous, self-sustaining {{economic growth in the}} tertiary sector of the economy and quaternary sector of the economy and high material standards of living. However, there are notable exceptions, as some countries considered developed have a significant component of primary industries in their national economies, e.g., Norway, Canada, Australia. The USA and Western Europe have a very important agricultural sector, and are major players in international agricultural markets. Also, natural resource extraction can be a very profitable industry (<b>high</b> <b>value</b> <b>added),</b> e.g., oil extraction.|$|E

40|$|This paper uses panel data {{to assess}} the {{relative}} importance of social networks and geographic proximity to micro, small, and medium enterprises in Viet Nam. The results suggest that a larger social network, and hiring employees mainly through social networks, are both correlated with <b>higher</b> <b>value</b> <b>added</b> per worker. The number of government officials and civil servants in a firm's network emerges as particularly important. When the quality of contacts is controlled for, firms with tighter social networks have, on average, <b>higher</b> <b>value</b> <b>added</b> per worker. The analysis of spatial networks reveals that firms with a lower percentage of customers and suppliers in the same district actually have <b>higher</b> <b>value</b> <b>added</b> per worker. The results suggest that for micro, small, and medium firms in Viet Nam, strong social networks are much more important than geographic proximity...|$|R

40|$|The Maritime provinces {{have been}} {{historically}} characterized as primarily low <b>value</b> <b>added</b> resource producing economies. One of the sectors identified most with this economy is food processing, {{which accounts for}} a quarter of the region's manufacturing output. Among the problems facing the Maritime economy has been an inability to <b>add</b> <b>value</b> to the region's natural resource output. This has left the economy reliant on commodity production which, in the long run, is vulnerable to outside competition. The region has also been economically depressed compared to other parts of Canada. Many initiatives have been undertaken to reduce disparities of income and employment, but by and large they have been unsuccessful. Some have argued for a shift in regional development policy away from incentives to attract new industry and towards the development of local industry.
