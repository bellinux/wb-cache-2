5|$|Years pass, and Tjioeng Wanara {{grows to}} {{be a strong}} young man. Aria Banga, meanwhile, has taken over the throne and rules with an iron fist, hated and feared by his people.

5|$|After the Battle of Edington in 878, Alfred {{established}} {{a network of}} fortified settlements, called burhs, in Wessex to protect <b>his</b> <b>people</b> <b>and</b> territory against Viking attacks, and when Æthelred accepted Alfred's lordship the burhs were extended into Mercia. One of the burhs was Worcester, where Æthelred worked with its bishop and used the standing Roman walls in the town's defences. Over the next two generations Worcester was transformed from an ecclesiastical settlement to a town with a diverse population of craftsmen.|$|E

Permana Dikoesoemah warns Aria Kebonan to respect him always {{and not to}} bother his wife. He then abdicates to meditate, ultimately ascending to a higher plane of existence.

5|$|The {{first of}} these four territories to be {{incorporated}} into Imerina was Fanongoavana, then a principality ruled by Andriampanarivofomanjaka. Continual threats to his kingdom's security led Andriampanarivofomanjaka to secretly travel to the Rova of Antananarivo to pledge submission to Andriamasinavalona. He was accompanied by seven advisers who eloquently communicated their master's willingness to acknowledge Andriamasinavalona as his king. Andriamasinavalona accepted this offer and sealed the union of their territories by marrying Andriampanarivofomanjaka to his sister, Ranavalontsimitovy. Andriampanarivofomanjaka then returned to his realm, announced the union to <b>his</b> <b>people,</b> <b>and</b> then spoke {{with the leaders of}} the neighboring Bezanozano people to successfully persuade them to join the kingdom and benefit from Andriamasinavalona's protection.|$|E
5|$|The {{mainstream}} media depicted Diệm as a friendly and charismatic leader who related {{well to the}} populace. The Herald showed photographs of the president eating cheese, and inspecting the foliage at the Botanic Gardens. Diệm was depicted making friends with a young boy from a Collingwood public housing estate and having tea with South Vietnamese students studying abroad at the University of Melbourne, with the females wearing the traditional ao dai. In contrast, Diệm was generally regarded as aloof and distant from the population, rarely heading outside the presidential palace to mingle with <b>his</b> <b>people,</b> <b>and</b> holding military processions in honour of his ascension to power in front of empty grandstands.|$|E
5|$|The {{second part}} of the poem {{parallels}} the Iliad and follows the events in America after the first part. Madoc returns to America from Wales and finds that Caermadoc, the colony, is doing well. However, there are struggles with <b>his</b> <b>people</b> <b>and</b> the Aztecs because the Aztecs have turned back to their pagan gods. As such, the peace between the two groups ends while a shaman of the Hoamen people starts to convince the people to also worship pagan gods. The Hoamen begin to sacrifice children for their god by feeding them to a large snake. Madoc, angry, accuses a priest leading the sacrifices of being a traitor before killing both the priest and the snake. This feat brings the Hoamen back to Christianity.|$|E

5|$|To his supporters, Quisling was {{regarded}} as a conscientious administrator of the highest order, knowledgeable and with an eye for detail. Balanced and gentle to a fault, they believed he cared deeply about <b>his</b> <b>people</b> <b>and</b> maintained high moral standards throughout. To his opponents, Quisling was unstable and undisciplined, abrupt, even threatening. Quite possibly he was both, at ease among friends and under pressure when confronted with his political opponents, and generally shy and retiring with both. During formal dinners he often said nothing at all except for the occasional cascade of dramatic rhetoric. Indeed, he did not react well to pressure and would often let slip over-dramatic sentiments when put on the spot. Normally open to criticism, he was prone to assuming larger groups were conspiratorial.|$|E
5|$|At {{the urging}} of both Yeesha and Esher, the player travels across four Ages, {{collecting}} four slates that unlock the tablet's power. Esher occasionally appears in the Ages to offer his counsel, or reveal the histories of <b>his</b> <b>people</b> <b>and</b> the worlds the player explores. Once all four slates are collected, Esher requests that the player bring the tablet {{to him in the}} now-unlocked Age of Myst. The player is then returned to K'veer, where they have four possible choices. Travelling to Myst without the tablet will cause Esher to angrily abandon the player with no way out. If Esher is given the tablet, he will explain he wishes to use the tablet for domination, and will also leave the player trapped. If the player gives the tablet to Yeesha, the tablet simply slips through her hands and disappears into the ground; she walks away, disappointed, leaving the player trapped in D'ni. The only good ending involves giving the Bahro the tablet, ending their enslavement. Arriving at Releeshahn, the new home Age of the D'ni, Yeesha and Atrus thank the player and speak of a new chapter for the D'ni people; Esher is handed over to the Bahro to be punished for his crimes. The game ends on a visit to Releeshahn.|$|E
5|$|Constantine {{remained}} aloof {{from the}} Italian conflict, however. Over {{the spring and}} summer of 307AD, he had left Gaul for Britain to avoid any involvement in the Italian turmoil; now, instead of giving Maxentius military aid, he sent his troops against Germanic tribes along the Rhine. In 308AD, he raided the territory of the Bructeri, and made a bridge across the Rhine at Colonia Agrippinensium (Cologne). In 310AD, he marched to the northern Rhine and fought the Franks. When not campaigning, he toured his lands advertising his benevolence, and supporting the economy and the arts. His refusal to participate in the war increased his popularity among <b>his</b> <b>people,</b> <b>and</b> strengthened his power base in the West. Maximian returned to Rome in the winter of 307–308AD, but soon fell out with his son. In early 308AD, after a failed attempt to usurp Maxentius' title, Maximian returned to Constantine's court.|$|E

5|$|Irataba (Mohave: eecheeyara tav , {{also known}} as Yara tav, Yarate:va, Arateve; – 1874) was {{a leader of the}} Mohave Nation, known for his role as a {{mediator}} between <b>his</b> <b>people</b> <b>and</b> the United States. He was born near the Colorado River in present-day Arizona. Irataba was a renowned orator {{and one of the first}} Mohave to speak English, a skill he used to develop relations with the United States. Early records mention his large physical size and gentle demeanor. Irataba first encountered European Americans in 1851, when he assisted the Sitgreaves Expedition. In 1854, he met Amiel Whipple, then leading an expedition crossing the Colorado. Several Mohave aided the group, and Irataba agreed to escort them through the territory of the Paiute to the Old Spanish Trail, which would take them to southern California. He later helped and protected other expeditions, earning him a reputation among whites as the most important native leader in the region.|$|E
5|$|Mellitus {{attended}} a council of bishops held in Italy in February 610, convened by Pope Boniface IV. The historian N. J. Higham speculates {{that one reason}} for his attendance may have been to assert the English Church's independence from the Frankish Church. Boniface had Mellitus take two papal letters back to England, one to Æthelbert and <b>his</b> <b>people,</b> <b>and</b> another to Laurence, the Archbishop of Canterbury. He also brought back the synod's decrees to England. No authentic letters or documents from this synod remain, although some were forged in the 1060s and 1070s at Canterbury. During his time as a bishop, Mellitus joined with Justus, the Bishop of Rochester, in signing a letter that Laurence wrote to the Celtic bishops urging the Celtic Church to adopt the Roman method of calculating the date of Easter. This letter also mentioned the fact that Irish missionary bishops, such as Dagan, refused to eat with the Roman missionaries.|$|E
