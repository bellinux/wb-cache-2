5|$|Father McCue (Arnie Walters) {{contacts}} Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{and asks}} for her help in the case. Scully visits the Kernofs, and learns that Dara was adopted six years earlier. Due to her severe spinal deformities, there is no explanation as to how Dara {{walked out of the}} house. Lance is convinced that it was the Devil that stood over her in the street. Scully examines Dara's body with a pathologist Vicki Belon (Lorraine Landry), who notes her surgically removed extra fingers. Belon reluctantly proposes that the girl was struck down by God, as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> mistake.|$|E

They both perceived each other in negative ways: Woodall looked upon Constantine as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> stuck-up English aristocrat and Constantine saw Woodall as 'Eurotrash'.|$|E

25|$|King {{notes that}} the {{eighteenth-century}} definition for “publisher” could also mean “bookseller.” King is uncertain whether Haywood produced the books and pamphlets that she sold (as Spedding indicates) or <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> bookseller, especially for Haywood’s early productions. Haywood sometimes collaborated on publishing matters in order to share the costs, as she did when she collaborated with Cogan on the publication of The Virtuous Villager. In any case, Haywood was most certainly a bookseller {{due to the fact}} that there were a great number and variety of works “to be had” at the Sign of Fame that did not bare her imprint.|$|E

Feldman declared that he wanted to explore this theme further in the script, as it discussed mankind's place in the universe and how other civilizations would perceive and relate to humanity, considering that [...] "maybe [...] not a potential threat, maybe a competitor, maybe a resource." [...] He also declared that more could be said about Sil's existentialist doubts, as she does not know her origin or purpose, and only follows her instinct to mate and perpetuate the species.|$|E
500|$|At {{the height}} of his {{popularity}} in Kung Fu, in 1974, Carradine was arrested again, this time for attempted burglary and malicious mischief. While under the influence of peyote, Carradine, nude, began wandering around his Laurel Canyon neighborhood. [...] He broke into a neighbor's home, breaking a window and cutting his arm. [...] He then bled all over the homeowner's piano. At some time during this episode he accosted two young women, allegedly assaulting one while asking, or demanding of her, <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> witch. The police literally followed a trail of blood to his home. The burglary charges were dropped, as nothing was found to be missing, while Carradine pleaded no contest to the mischief charge and was given probation. He was never charged with assault, but the young woman sued him for $1.1 million and was awarded $20,000.|$|E

500|$|At {{the time}} of her birth, it was unknown <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> male or female, as it was {{considered}} too dangerous to approach her and her parents. [...] Her handlers assumed she was a male and originally named her [...] "Sonny Jim". When it was established that Pattycake was a female, a contest was held by the New York Daily News to find her a name. [...] "Patty Cake", the winning entry, was submitted by New York fireman John O'Connor, who named the gorilla after his wife and a proposed daughter. [...] "It just so happens that we have three boys and I told my wife that if we ever have a girl, we should name her Patty, which happens to be her name. I thought we'd let the baby gorilla use the name in the meantime," [...] O'Connor told reporters.|$|E
500|$|O'Brien {{said that}} the songs on I'm Breathless had a [...] "coquettish" [...] and [...] "pandering nature", and was the polar {{opposite}} to Madonna's previous release, Like a Prayer, which had an introspective composition. I'm Breathless opens {{with the sound of}} an intercom and a shuffle, and power ballad [...] "He's a Man" [...] starts, a song which Madonna sings as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> [...] "hooker stalking the boulevard". Also, Madonna's [...] "haunting" [...] vocals continue after the music has faded. One of the Sondheim songs, [...] "Sooner or Later", is a 1930s jazz ballad with comping piano, brushed drum sounds, double bass and horns. Conjuring the atmosphere of a smoky nightclub, the song finds Madonna in her lowest range as the melody shifts continuously. [...] "Hanky Panky", the third song and second single, deals with sadomasochistic themes and is centered around a girl who celebrates the pleasures of a [...] "good spanking". It is performed in an almost comical style, and stemmed from a line in the film, where Breathless says to Tracy, [...] "You don't know whether to hit me or kiss me".|$|E
500|$|During [...] "Off The Wall", {{the first}} episode of the fourth season, Natalie Nunn told Annie Andersen that Chris Brown was at a night club {{that she wanted to}} attend, and asked Anderson <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> fan. Anderson said not, because of the {{domestic}} violence case that Brown was involved in. Nunn defended Brown, saying [...] "Who cares, Rihanna was a punk bitch, and she got her ass beat for a reason". Nunn called Rihanna a [...] "crazy bitch" [...] and claimed to know her, unlike Anderson. After the episode aired, Brown reportedly stated {{that he did not know}} who Nunn was. Nunn questioned this during the reunion show, claiming that Brown had said it because the cast of the show had not yet been revealed. Perez Hilton, the host of the reunion, asked Nunn if Rihanna had confronted her about her comments. Nunn answered yes, stating that the two had argued during a dinner party in New York City. During the reunion, Nunn claimed to have had a [...] "fling" [...] with Brown before the show. Shortly before the end of the reunion, Nunn said that she did not condone domestic violence and apologized if her comment had enraged fans and people who had been victims of it.|$|E

500|$|Weiss {{additionally}} {{spoke about}} the introduction of Lyanna Mormont in the series, with Weiss saying, [...] "We were excited {{about the prospect of}} the character because she's mentioned in passing in the previous season," [...] referring to her letter to Stannis denying him men, and swearing fealty to House Stark. Weiss added, [...] "The more we thought about it, Jon is going to come up against so many old guys with beards in the North that like 'What <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> tougher audience?' It seemed like an inherently fun scene to watch, it also is terrifying because it's putting a lot of dramatic weight on the shoulders of somebody who needs to be very young." [...] David Benioff concluded the featurette speaking about the Ironborn story, noting [...] "Yara's not a therapist, in our kind of sense of the word, she's not there to tell him to 'buck up' and 'everything's going to be okay,' it's a pretty brutal kind of therapy, but that's who they are, I mean they're essentially a Viking people. There's not {{a lot of room for}} sort of soft, and gentle psychology. I think it's the kind of tough love Theon needed at this point, and when he finally raises his eyes, and looks into her eyes, we see a glimpse of the old Theon that had been lost for so long." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reading {{the report}} of Tamar in [...] "She sat in the gate of Enaim," [...] Rabbi Alexander taught that Tamar went {{and sat at the}} {{entrance}} of the place of Abraham, the place to which all eyes ( [...] , einaim) look. Alternatively, Rav Hanin said in the name of Rav that there is a place called Enaim, and it is the same place mentioned in [...] when it speaks of [...] "Tappuah and Enam." [...] Alternatively, Rabbi Samuel bar Nahmani taught that the place is called Enaim because Tamar gave eyes ( [...] , einaim) to her words; that is, Tamar gave convincing replies to Judah's questions. When Judah solicited her, he asked her <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> Gentile, and she replied that she was a convert. When Judah asked her <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> married woman, she replied that she was unmarried. When Judah asked her if perhaps her father had accepted marriage proposals on her behalf betrothals (making her forbidden to Judah), she replied that she was an orphan. When Judah asked her if perhaps she was ritually unclean (because she was a menstruant, or niddah, and thus forbidden to Judah), she replied that she was clean..|$|E

On June 14, 1968, Dohrn was elected the Inter-organizational Secretary of SDS, and, once elected, was asked <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> socialist.

[...] On the silver screen, however, she found consolation; [...] "For {{the first time in my}} life I knew there was beauty in the world.

I knew I would have done it differently. I couldn't analyze it, but I could always feel it.". [...] "I'd go home and be a one girl circus, taking the parts of everyone I'd seen, living them before the glass."
