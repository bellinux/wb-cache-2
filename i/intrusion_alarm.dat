Administrators and security analysts are overwhelmed by constant outside threats, complexity of security measures, and network growth. Today’s status quo for network defense is often reduced to mere triage and after-the-fact remediation. This chapter examines proactive methods of attack risk reduction and response through attack graphs. Our attack graphs map potential paths of vulnerability through a network, showing exactly how attackers may penetrate a network. Attack graph analysis identifies critical vulnerabilities and provides strategies for protection of critical network assets. But because of operational realities, vulnerability paths often remain. In such cases attack graphs provide an ideal methodology for planning appropriate attack responses.

40|$|Abstract. Intrusion {{detection}} {{for computer}} systems {{is a key}} problem in today’s networked society. Current distributed intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are not fully distributed as most of them centrally analyze data collected from distributed nodes resulting in a single point of failure. Increasingly, researchers are focusing on distributed IDSs to circumvent the problems of centralized approaches. A major concern of fully distributed IDSs is the high false positive rates of <b>intrusion</b> <b>alarms</b> which undermine the usability of such systems. We believe that effective distributed IDSs can be designed based on principles of coordinated multiagent systems. We propose an Agent-Based Distributed Intrusion Alert System (ABDIAS) which is fully distributed and provides two capabilities {{in addition to other}} functionalities of an IDS: (a) early warning when pre-attack activities are detected, (b) detecting and isolating compromised nodes by trust mechanisms and voting-based peer-level protocols. ...|$|R
40|$|Road traffic {{accidents}} {{are one of}} the main causes of death and disability worldwide. Workers responsible for maintaining and repairing roadways are especially prone to suffer these events, given their exceptional exposure to traffic. Since these actuations usually coexist with regular traffic, an errant driver can easily intrude the work area and provoke a collision. Some authors have proposed mechanisms aimed at detecting breaches in the work zone perimeter and alerting workers, which are collectively called <b>intrusion</b> <b>alarm</b> systems. However, they have several limitations and have not yet fulfilled the necessities of these scenarios. In this paper, we propose a new <b>intrusion</b> <b>alarm</b> system based on a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). Our system is comprised of two main elements: vehicle detectors that form a virtual barrier and detect perimeter breaches by means of an ultrasonic beam and individual warning devices that transmit alerts to the workers. All these elements have a wireless communication interface and form a network that covers the whole work area. This network is in charge of transmitting and routing the alarms and coordinates the behavior of the system. We have tested our solution under real conditions with satisfactory results...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Intrusion Detection {{has been}} {{investigated}} {{for many years and}} the field has matured. Nevertheless, there are still important challenges, e. g., how an IDS can detect new and complex distributed attacks. To tackle these problems, we propose a distributed Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach in a hierarchical architecture of network sensor agents. Each network sensor agent learns to interpret local state observations, and communicates them to a central agent higher up in the agent hierarchy. These central agents, in turn, learn to send signals up the hierarchy, based on the signals that they receive. Finally, the agent {{at the top of the}} hierarchy learns when to signal an <b>intrusion</b> <b>alarm.</b> We evaluate our approach in an abstract network domain. ...|$|E

However, little is known about how to best integrate the sensory channels for analyzing <b>intrusion</b> detection <b>alarms.</b> In the past, we proposed a set of ideas outlining the benefits of enhancing <b>intrusion</b> detection <b>alarms</b> with multimodal interfaces.

Indeed, this would require to define a measure of the tradeoff among objectives, which are, by definition, incommensurable quantities. These tradeoffs should be tuned according to contingencies Which is, in general, a very difficult task. We present in this paper, an approach to address such issues. We define a multi-robot multi-objective surveillance problem and show how this can be solved by a particular type of heuristic graph search used in the field of multi-objective optimization.

40|$|Keywords:leaky cable, {{perimeter}} intrusion detection, feature extraction, similarity matching Abstract. With {{the growing}} demand for security products, <b>intrusion</b> <b>alarm</b> system, based on leaky cables, is favored by majority of enterprises, with advantages of system stability, high concealment and installation location unlimited. Traditional intrusion detection method relies on signal amplitude threshold. However, this method is prone to produce false positives with complex environment interference and false negatives when the leaked electromagnetic field is weak. To solve this problem, this paper, by analyzing time and frequency domain features of the intrusion and interference signals, attempts to use a time-domain analysis method to recognize the intrusion signal. Then we research on how to establish the feature model of intrusion signal, and finally we propose an intrusion signal recognition algorithm based on similarity matching. Through identifying and verifying {{a large number of}} actual sample signals, results show that the similarity matching method can effectively reduce the false positives and false negatives, and improve the accuracy of alarm system...|$|E
40|$|The Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) {{protocol}} is {{a proactive}} Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET) routing pro-tocol. Security aspects {{have not been}} designed into the OLSR protocol and therefore make it vulnerable to various kinds of attacks.

Conflict checking based on se-mantic properties is applied in every MANET node.
