This time, Varrick's CEO Rueben Massey feels {{sure that there is}} nothing wrong with Krayoxx. The drug works as advertised, it has no ill effects and is unjustly maligned; Varrick has first-rate experts with impeccable records willing to so testify. The Varrick CEO flies to Chicago and engages Nadine Karros, the Rogan Rothberg ace litigator, who asks for a $5 million non-refundable retainer and bills at $1,000 per hour - and those who can afford it consider her worth <b>every</b> <b>penny.</b> With Karros' help, Varrick sets a trap for the mass tort lawyers. This time Varrick will only pretend to negotiate – their true aim would be to have a jury completely vindicate Krayoxx and deny any kind of tort.|$|E

500|$|Chosen {{to provide}} the score for Quatermass and the Pit was Tristram Cary. He {{developed}} an interest in electronic music while serving in the Royal Navy as an electronics expert working on radar during the Second World War. He became a professional composer in 1954, working in film, theatre, radio and television, with credits including The Ladykillers (1955). He said of his assignment, “I was not mad about doing the film because Hammer wanted masses of electronic material {{and a great deal}} of orchestral music. But I had three kids, all of which were at fee-paying schools, so I needed <b>every</b> <b>penny</b> I could get!”. Cary also recalled that, “The main use of electronics in Quatermass, I think, was the violent shaking, vibrating sound that the [...] "thing in the tunnel" [...] gave off [...] It was not a terribly challenging sound to do, though I never played it very loud because I didn't want to destroy my speakers – I did have hopes of destroying a few cinema loudspeaker systems, though it never happened”. Carey went on to write the score for another Hammer film, Blood from the Mummy's Tomb, in 1971. Several orchestral and electronic cues from the film were released by GDI Records on a compilation titled The Quatermass Film Music Collection.|$|E

However, according to Bhandarkar the film was [...] "not about [...] fashion industry as such. It only has fashion as a backdrop. The film is more about the story of models, designers and people.
