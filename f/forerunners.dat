5|$|Halo 4 {{takes place}} in a futuristic science fiction setting in the year 2557, four years after the events of Halo 3. Backstory details that {{hundreds}} of thousands of years before the modern era, humans were one of several interstellar civilizations. Following a war with the parasitic Flood, the humans came into conflict with the <b>Forerunners,</b> a powerful race that upheld a policy of benevolent shepherding of other races known as the Mantle of Responsibility. Humanity had begun an aggressive campaign of destroying any Flood infestations on a planet, which was misinterpreted as a desire for conquest. After centuries of war the <b>Forerunners</b> defeated the humans, ancestors of the contemporary human race, and stripped them of their technology and empire. The <b>Forerunners</b> soon fought the Flood themselves; after exhausting every other strategic option available to them, the <b>Forerunners</b> activated weapons of mass destruction known as the Halo Array. The Array's firing killed all sentient life in the galaxy to deprive the Flood of their food. Life that the <b>Forerunners</b> cataloged was then reseeded throughout the galaxy.|$|E
5|$|Cryptum {{takes place}} {{approximately}} 100,000 {{years before the}} present day in the Halo universe, {{telling the story of}} the <b>Forerunners</b> before their disappearance. It revolves around the journey of a young Forerunner, Bornstellar, and two humans, Chakas and Morning Riser, and how their lives change when they meet a Forerunner warrior, the Didact. The <b>Forerunners</b> are a type-three civilization on the Kardashev scale; they can build artificial planets and control stars. <b>Forerunners</b> are divided into classes by occupation, they are (in order of rank): Builders, the architects of the Forerunners' megastructures, Miners, Lifeworkers, experts in medicine and biology, and Warriors. Bornstellar's family are politically important Builders and particularly wealthy, enabling them to own an entire planet. Warriors introduced in this book called Prometheans were later featured as antagonists in the video game Halo 4.|$|E
5|$|In the Halo universe, {{humans had}} {{advanced}} to a comparable level {{of technology to}} the <b>Forerunners</b> but, after losing a war with them, all human technology was destroyed and their intelligence reduced, leaving them in a subsistence economy with measures to prevent redevelopment of electronics. Humans {{are aware of the}} other, space-faring races, but their interactions are limited to visits from <b>Forerunners</b> as {{they do not have the}} technology to make contact themselves, they live in wooden buildings and have only primitive steam engines. The San'Shyuum (or Prophets as they are referred to in the Halo games) were also defeated by the <b>Forerunners</b> but their technology was not destroyed; they were instead confined to their home solar system and forbidden to manufacture weapons.|$|E

He is therefore our <b>forerunner</b> {{by virtue of his}} priesthood, his blood giving worth to all he does.|$|R

ASL was influenced by its <b>forerunners</b> but distinct from all of them.|$|E
5|$|Cotillo's early law {{practice}} included {{a lot of}} uncompensated charity for the neighborhood. Apart from a genuine social compassion, Cotillo was also building political alliances {{that would make it}} possible for him to use the Italian-American voter power as his Irish-American <b>forerunners</b> in New York were using the power of other immigrant groups.|$|E
2500|$|Paul Russel is {{considered}} {{the architect of the}} <b>Forerunner's</b> design. In an interview, Russel stated that creating the <b>Forerunner's</b> [...] "visual language" [...] was a tough process which only came together [...] "like five months away" [...] from the game's completion; much of the design was finalized on a single level, [...] "The Silent Cartographer", which features both exterior <b>Forerunner</b> structures as well as deep interior chasms. Concept artist Eddie Smith is also credited with helping hone the <b>Forerunner's</b> direction, and said that he started work by reading the game's mission synopsis. [...] "I knew what human and Covenant architecture looked like, so I tried to make the <b>Forerunner</b> concepts different," [...] Smith said. The result was a sleek angular design which was distinct from the curves of the Covenant's architecture and the functional human designs. For Halo 2, designers wanted to refine and elaborate on the <b>Forerunner</b> design, without abandoning the style set by Russel; environment artist Frank Capezzuto found that looking at the <b>Forerunner</b> structures as sculptures rather than buildings helped to drive the designs for Halo 2.|$|R
50|$|In 2009, Garmin {{produced}} {{three new}} models: the <b>Forerunner</b> 60 (an {{evolution of the}} <b>Forerunner</b> 50), the <b>Forerunner</b> 405CX (405 chassis), and the <b>Forerunner</b> 310XT (an evolution of the 305 chassis). New features included additional battery life and vibration alerts on the 310XT and advanced calorie consumption modeling on all watches. The new calorie consumption modeling in these devices {{was the result of}} Garmin's first collaboration with Finnish physiological analytics firm Firstbeat. The 310XT was also the first watch of the <b>Forerunner</b> series to be waterproof, thus allowing its use for swimming and on all legs of a Triathlon, also thanks to an extended battery life. In 2010 a firmware update added vastly improved open-water swimming metrics.|$|R
5000|$|In the Halo universe, more {{particularly}} in Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary and the <b>Forerunner</b> Saga novels, the <b>Forerunner</b> Ecumene spanned the galaxy more than 100,000 years ago. [...] <b>Forerunner</b> society {{was divided into}} five main social classes, called [...] "rates" [...] (in ascending order of social standing/power): [...] "Engineers", [...] "Warrior-Servants", [...] "Lifeworkers", [...] "Miners", and [...] "Builders".|$|R

5|$|Prior to the 1930s, Barbadian calypso {{was called}} banja, and was {{performed}} by laborers in village-tenantry areas. Itinerant minstrels like Mighty Jerry, Shilling Agard and Slammer were well-known <b>forerunners</b> of modern Barbadian calypso. Their song tradition embraced sentimentality, humor, and opinionated lyrics that continued to the 1960s, often by then accompanied by guitar or banjo.|$|E
5|$|Battling the Flood, Covenant, {{and human}} forces are the Sentinels: robotic drones {{designed}} by an extinct race called the <b>Forerunners</b> {{to protect their}} structures and prevent Flood outbreaks. Sentinels are able to hover around in enclosed spaces and produce an energy shield when under attack. They lack durability, but use powerful laser beam weapons and are immune to infection by the Flood.|$|E

5|$|Much of {{the story}} takes place on Erde-Tyrene, the <b>Forerunner</b> name for Earth, {{although}} characters also visit the San'Shyuum homeworld, Bornstellar's family's planet and the <b>Forerunner</b> political centre, a planet-sized space station.|$|R
5|$|In stamp {{collecting}} circles, the word forerunner usually describes {{a postage stamp}} used during the time period before a region or territory issues stamps of its own. However, in Irish reference books, such as Handbook of Irish Philately, the term <b>forerunners</b> usually refers to political and propaganda labels. These often resemble stamps, but few of them were used on Irish mail {{and they had no}} legal standing for mail in Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Living asteroids, the Neoasteroidea, are morphologically {{distinct}} from their <b>forerunners</b> in the Paleozoic. The taxonomy {{of the group}} is relatively stable but there is ongoing debate {{about the status of}} the Paxillosida, and the deep-water sea daisies, though clearly Asteroidea and currently included in Velatida, do not fit easily in any accepted lineage. Phylogenetic data suggests that they may be a sister group, the Concentricycloidea, to the Neoasteroidea, or that the Velatida themselves may be a sister group.|$|E
5|$|The Lockheed XF-104 was a single-engine, high-performance, {{supersonic}} interceptor {{prototype for}} a United States Air Force (USAF) series of lightweight and simple fighters. Only two aircraft were built; one aircraft was used primarily for aerodynamic {{research and the}} other served as an armament testbed, both aircraft being destroyed in accidents during testing. The XF-104s were <b>forerunners</b> of over 2,500 production Lockheed F-104 Starfighters.|$|E
2500|$|After Duela Dent's murder, {{one of the}} Monitors consults the Source Wall {{to learn}} {{the cause of the}} rising tension in the Multiverse. The Wall reveals that the [...] "Great Disaster" [...] is the cause of the rising tension and that Ray Palmer is the {{solution}} to stopping it. At their headquarters, the Monitors discuss their goal of protecting the Multiverse from individuals who cross between worlds. They vote to decide the fates of Donna Troy, Jason Todd, and Kyle Rayner, and the decision is made to purge them as anomalies. The Monitors dispatch a <b>Forerunner</b> named Viza Aziv to kill Jason Todd and Donna Troy. After beating Jason, <b>Forerunner</b> fights Donna. The encounter is interrupted by one of the Monitors. Created by the Monitors, <b>Forerunner</b> cannot harm them. Having failed in her mission, <b>Forerunner</b> goes into self-imposed exile. Monarch (Nathaniel Adam) witnesses the defeat of the <b>Forerunner.</b> Monarch takes the <b>Forerunner</b> to the Bleed, and recruits her into his army after revealing to her that her people on Earth-34 have been exterminated by Dark Angel at the Monitors' behest.|$|R

5|$|The {{settlement}} that grew to become Banagher, originated at a ford {{on the east}} bank of the River Shannon. The river banks and surrounding countryside were flood-free all year round. Travellers intending to cross the Shannon converged on this point along tracks which were the <b>forerunners</b> of the modern roads, and a community grew at this crossing point.|$|E
5|$|Until the mid-15th century, organs had no stop controls. Each manual {{controlled}} ranks {{at multiple}} pitches, {{known as the}} Blockwerk. Around 1450, controls were designed that allowed {{the ranks of the}} Blockwerk to be played individually. These devices were the <b>forerunners</b> of modern stop actions. The higher-pitched ranks of the Blockwerk remained grouped together under a single stop control; these stops developed into mixtures.|$|E
5|$|Among US-built battleships, Texas {{is notable}} for her {{sizeable}} number of firsts: the first US Navy vessel to house a permanently assigned contingent of US Marines, the first US battleship to mount anti-aircraft guns, the first US ship to control gunfire with directors and range-keepers (analog <b>forerunners</b> of today's computers), the first US battleship {{to launch an}} aircraft, from a platform on Turret 2, {{one of the first}} to receive the CXAM-1 version of CXAM production radar in the US Navy, the first US battleship to become a permanent museum ship, and the first battleship declared to be a US National Historic Landmark.|$|E

The Didact is married to the Librarian, one of the most powerful and influential Lifeworkers to have lived. She is a Lifeshaper, the highest rank a Lifeworker can achieve, and is responsible for indexing every species in the galaxy in the Ark.|$|E
5|$|Botany {{originated}} in prehistory as herbalism with {{the efforts of}} early humans to identify – and later cultivate – edible, medicinal and poisonous plants, {{making it one of}} the oldest branches of science. Medieval physic gardens, often attached to monasteries, contained plants of medical importance. They were <b>forerunners</b> of the first botanical gardens attached to universities, founded from the 1540s onwards. One of the earliest was the Padua botanical garden. These gardens facilitated the academic study of plants. Efforts to catalogue and describe their collections were the beginnings of plant taxonomy, and led in 1753 to the binomial system of Carl Linnaeus that remains in use to this day.|$|E
5|$|Dramatic {{poetry is}} drama written in verse to be spoken or sung, and appears in varying, {{sometimes}} related forms in many cultures. Greek tragedy in verse {{dates to the}} 6th century B.C., {{and may have been}} an influence on the development of Sanskrit drama, just as Indian drama in turn appears to have influenced the development of the bianwen verse dramas in China, <b>forerunners</b> of Chinese Opera. East Asian verse dramas also include Japanese Noh. Examples of dramatic poetry in Persian literature include Nizami's two famous dramatic works, Layla and Majnun and Khosrow and Shirin, Ferdowsi's tragedies such as Rostam and Sohrab, Rumi's Masnavi, Gorgani's tragedy of Vis and Ramin, and Vahshi's tragedy of Farhad.|$|E
