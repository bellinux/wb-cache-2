5|$|Meanwhile, {{back in the}} restaurant, the {{waitress}} returns to find the woman missing. Believing that the woman has left without paying the bill, she angrily crumples and throws the woman's comic book into a bin. This makes the hero's two opposing racers reappear, armed with a large pipe wrench. The racers smash the looking glass with the pipe wrench, trapping {{the woman in the}} comic book. The hero punches one of the thugs and retreats with the woman into a maze of paper. Arriving at a dead end, he tears a hole in the paper wall so that the woman can escape as the menacing opposing racers close in on him. The woman, now back in the real world and found lying beside the bin to the surprise of restaurant guests and staff, retrieves the comic from the bin and runs home, where she attempts to smooth out the creases to learn what <b>happens</b> <b>next.</b>|$|E
5|$|The next day, a Nazi U-boat appears and {{intercepts}} the ship. Belloq and Dietrich {{seize the}} Ark and Marion but cannot locate Jones, who stows away aboard the U-boat and travels {{with them to}} {{an island in the}} Aegean Sea. Once there, Belloq plans to test the power of the Ark before presenting it to Hitler. Jones reveals himself and threatens to destroy the Ark with a panzerfaust, but Belloq calls his bluff and Jones surrenders rather than destroy such an important historical artifact. The Nazis take Indy and Marion to an area where the Ark will be opened and tie them to a post to observe. Belloq performs a ceremonial opening of the Ark, which appears to contain nothing but sand, all that remains of the Ten Commandments. Suddenly, angelic ghost-like beings emerge from the Ark. Indy cautions Marion to keep her eyes closed and not to observe what <b>happens</b> <b>next.</b> Belloq and the others look on in astonishment as the apparitions are suddenly revealed to be angels of death. A vortex of flame forms above the Ark and shoots bolts of fiery energy into the gathered Nazi soldiers, killing them all. As Belloq, Toht and Dietrich all scream in terror, the Ark turns its fury on them: Dietrich's head shrivels up, Toht's face is melted off his skull and Belloq's head explodes. Flames then engulf the remains of the doomed assembly, save for Indy and Marion, and the pillar of fire rises into the sky. The Ark's lid is blasted high into the air before dropping back down onto the Ark and sealing it. Jones and Marion find their ropes burned off and embrace.|$|E

25|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 1990s, bands such as Born Against, Rorschach, Burn and Drive Like Jehu took the 1980s styles of hardcore and pushed them into more contemporary sounds. Many of the bands from this era were strongly influenced by other genres, such as heavy metal, alternative, pop, and even rap. Hardcore subsequently became a broad term, as a variety of different genres arose, such as melodic hardcore (Avail, Lifetime, Kid Dynamite), emo (Endpoint, Saves the Day), D-beat (Avskum, Aus Rotten, Skitsystem), powerviolence (Spazz, Dropdead, Charles Bronson), thrashcore (What <b>Happens</b> <b>Next?,</b> Voorhees, Vivisick), mathcore (The Dillinger Escape Plan, Botch, Converge), screamo (Heroin, Antioch Arrow, Portraits of Past, Swing Kids) and rapcore (Biohazard).|$|E

500|$|Aside {{from the}} {{criticism}} of Werehog levels, further aspects of the game were criticised, contributing to the mixed review scores.

The story and overall tone of the game, including the new character Chip, were criticised, some remarking that it was too juvenile, or comparable to that of a Saturday morning cartoon.|$|E

500|$|Den of Geek {{viewed the}} episode positively, observing that in {{contrast}} to the previous installment, [...] "Ability" [...] "progresses the main plot arc in a substantial way... I’m now really interested to see what <b>happens</b> <b>next,</b> whereas last week I wasn’t that bothered." [...] IGN's Ramsey Isler was a little more critical and rated the episode 7.8/10. He noted that though the ending with Walter [...] "was as good as you could ask for" [...] and enjoyed David Robert Jones as a villain, the episode had a [...] "number of rough patches," [...] as the middle was [...] "paced slowly" [...] and lacking in suspense, Peter's [...] "handiness was again reduced to ...'that guy with connections'", and the audience was [...] "once again subjected to the torture that is Sanford Harris". After describing the Olivia-Peter scene near the end as [...] "tense and cleverly written," [...] Isler concluded his review by noting references to The X-Files and hoping Jones would appear again soon.|$|E
500|$|Robbins ranked {{seventh in}} a top ten list of gay {{characters}} on TV compiled by Jane Boursaw of TV Squad. Boursaw wrote: [...] "She's {{a mix of}} ironies - a pediatrician who glides around the hospital on wheelies, impulsively kisses Callie, then tells her she doesn't have time to teach a newbie how to be gay. Still, she's {{more interesting than the}} other gays on this show, which are dwindling in numbers since Erica left for parts unknown." [...] Commenting on Hahn's abrupt departure from the show, Dorothy Snarker, writing for LGBT website AfterEllen.com observed of Robbins and Torres' relationship: [...] "I [...] can't help but be wary of how the Grey's writers will handle this relationship.

500|$|With {{no water}} to {{lubricate}} them, plate tectonics would very likely stop {{and the most}} visible signs of geological activity would be shield volcanoes located above mantle hotspots. In these arid conditions the planet may retain some microbial and possibly even multi-cellular life. Most of these microbes will be halophiles and life could find too refuge in the atmosphere as has been proposed {{that could have happened}} on Venus. However, the increasingly extreme conditions will likely lead to the extinction of the prokaryotes between 1.6 billion years and 2.8 billion years from now, with the last of them living in residual ponds of water at high latitudes and heights or in caverns with trapped ice; underground life, however, could last longer. What <b>happens</b> <b>next</b> depends on the level of tectonic activity. A steady release of carbon dioxide by volcanic eruption could cause the atmosphere to enter a [...] "supergreenhouse" [...] state like that of the planet Venus. But as stated above without surface water, plate tectonics would probably come to a halt and most of the carbonates would remain securely buried until the Sun became a red giant and its increased luminosity heated the rock to the point of releasing the carbon dioxide.|$|E
500|$|Absolute Garbage {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Slant Magazine's Sal Cinqumani gave a positive {{overview of the}} compilation, writing that the album [...] "serves as an anthropological study of the musical relics of a bygone era", while Laila Hassani of Heat summed up her five-star review by writing, [...] "Few modern female-fronted rock bands {{stand the test of}} time, but this reminds you why, along with Gwen Stefani's No Doubt, Garbage are one of them." [...] A reviewer for Instinct wrote [...] "this hits collection is loaded with songs best described as massive... you'll find something to love here". Jaime Gill, in a review for BBC Music, felt that [...] "Absolute Garbage is a fine legacy, the sound of a briefly brilliant and always interesting band" [...] and that overall the album [...] "sounds like no other greatest hits you own." [...] Digital Spy's Nick Levine wrote, [...] "By wrapping their nut-grabbing hooks and transcendent melodies in layers of gutsy guitars, Garbage managed to make pop music for people who thought they didn't like pop music. For that reason, whatever <b>happens</b> <b>next,</b> they deserve to be remembered fondly." [...] A reviewer for the Daily Mail described it as [...] "a slick blend of grunge-rock power and sultry girl-group harmonies" [...] and added, [...] " [...] already sounds dated, but the songs stand up well." ...|$|E
500|$|Australian naval historians David Stevens and Tom Frame {{disagree}} on what <b>happens</b> <b>next.</b> Stevens states that Cumberledge assembled the ship's {{company in the}} early afternoon, read the Articles of War, lectured them on the seriousness of refusing duty, then ordered the stokers {{to go to their}} stations, which they did meekly. Frame claims that the stokers returned to duty freely once the battlecruiser was underway, before Cumberledge cleared lower deck and spoke to the sailors. After addressing the sailors, Cumberledge gathered the ship's senior officers for an inquiry. Five men, including the Victoria Cross nominee from the Zeebrugge raid, were charged with inciting a mutiny and arrested pending a court-martial, which was held aboard [...] on 20 June, after Australia arrived in Sydney. The ruling was that the five men had [...] "joined a mutiny, not accompanied by violence", and they were sentenced to imprisonment in Goulburn Gaol: two for a year, one for eighteen months, and two for two years with hard labour. A number of other sailors were charged with participating in a mutiny, but again, Stevens and Frame {{disagree on}} details: the former claims 7 men were successfully charged, while the latter says 32 sailors were subsequently acquitted of mutiny, but then successfully charged with refusing duty. Both authors agree that these men were tried by the captain while Australia was still at sea, and punished with 90 days each in cells.|$|E

2500|$|A Markov {{chain is}} a {{stochastic}} process with the Markov property.

The show ends with the {{discovery}} that Victor Lord, Jr. is still alive and has been kidnapped by Perkins. Perkins closes the 43-year-old soap opera by throwing the script of One Life to Live at Victor saying to him: [...] "But why spoil what <b>happens</b> <b>next.</b> You of all people should know things are rarely what they appear". The decision to conclude One Life to Live with an open-ended story is because the serial was supposed to continue on another network at the time the last scenes were taped (see section below).|$|E
