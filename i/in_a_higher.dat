5|$|A {{hypothesis}} for {{the high}} metal content in SMR dwarf stars is that material enriched in heavy elements fell into the atmosphere from a protoplanetary disk. This would pollute the star's external layers, resulting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> than normal metallicity. The lack of a deep convection zone {{would mean that the}} outer layers would retain higher abundance ratios of these heavy elements.|$|E

5|$|In {{nearly all}} species of birds, an individual's sex is {{determined}} at fertilisation. However, {{one recent study}} demonstrated temperature-dependent sex determination among the Australian brushturkey, for which higher temperatures during incubation resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> female-to-male sex ratio. This, however, was later proven to not be the case. These birds do not exhibit temperature-dependent sex determination, but temperature-dependent sex mortality.|$|E
5|$|Repetitive group {{selection}} {{tables for}} repetitive dives were modified.

5|$|A team {{typically}} {{consists of}} nine competitors: three honors, three scholastic and three varsity. However, since {{only the top}} two scores from each category count towards the team's total score, a team can compete with as few as six students without any point deduction. Students may compete <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> category than the one they are assigned to, but generally {{it is to the}} students' advantage to compete in the lowest category they can. Scores in Varsity are typically lower than those in Scholastic, and those in Scholastic are typically lower than those in Honors.|$|E

5|$|Americium {{has been}} {{produced}} in small quantities in nuclear reactors for decades, and kilograms of its 241Am and 243Am isotopes have been accumulated by now. Nevertheless, {{since it was}} first offered for sale in 1962, its price, about 1,500 USD per gram of 241Am, remains almost unchanged owing to the very complex separation procedure. The heavier isotope 243Am is produced in much smaller amounts; it is thus more difficult to separate, resulting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> cost of the order 100,000–160,000 USD/g.|$|E

5|$|Each atomic orbital {{corresponds}} to a particular energy level of the electron. The electron can change its state to a higher energy level by absorbing a photon with sufficient energy to boost it into the new quantum state. Likewise, through spontaneous emission, an electron <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> energy state can drop to a lower energy state while radiating the excess energy as a photon. These characteristic energy values, defined by {{the differences in the}} energies of the quantum states, are responsible for atomic spectral lines.|$|E

5|$|Having exactly three pitch {{classes for}} its open notes (for example {C,E,G}), each major-thirds tuning repeats every note <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> octave, because guitars have six strings. Being regular, M3 tunings repeat each note after two strings: this {{repetition}} simplifies {{the learning of}} chords and improvisation. Chord inversion is especially simple in major-thirds tuning. Chords are inverted simply by raising one or two notes three strings. The raised notes are played with the same finger as the original notes.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{evidence}} that the effect has implications for real-life decisions. One lab study revealed an increase in a favourable attitude towards prices when they were secretly manipulated to match subjects’ birthday dates, thus resulting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> chance of purchase. However a second study using birth year as price did not lead to the same result. A study of the liking of products found that participants with high self-esteem liked products better if the product names unknowingly involved their birthday number and letters of their name. Some field research into the impact of the birthday-number effect on bigger life decisions (e.g. where to live) is controversial.|$|E
5|$|Dhaka has {{the largest}} number of schools, colleges and {{universities}} of any Bangladeshi city. The education system is divided into 5 levels: Primary (from grades 1 to 6), Junior (from grades 6 to 8), Secondary (from grades 9 to 10), Higher Secondary (from grades 11 to 12) and tertiary. The five years of Primary education concludes with a Primary School Completion (PSC) Examination, the three years of Junior education concludes with Junior School Certificate (JSC) Examination, and next two years of Secondary education concludes with a Secondary School Certificate (SSC) Examination. Students who pass this examination proceed to two years of Higher Secondary or intermediate training, which culminate <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Higher</b> Secondary School Certificate (HSC) Examination. Education is mainly offered in Bengali, but English is also widely taught and used. Many Muslim families send their children to attend part-time courses or even to pursue full-time religious education alongside other subjects, which is imparted in Bengali and Arabic in schools, colleges and madrasas.|$|E

5|$|Irvine {{added to}} his tally with home and away goals against Halifax Town, where he {{would go on to}} play the next season, and a strike against Aston Villa that was named as runner-up in a Goal of the Season {{competition}} by television programme Match of the Day. With the forward partnership of Irvine and Kit Napier, Brighton performed better than expected in the 1971–72 season. At the end of the campaign, following a 1–1 draw with Rochdale the team was promoted to the Second Division, after finishing as runners-up behind Aston Villa. Irvine continued to score <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> division, netting five times in the first eleven matches of the season. However, he was then dropped from the team and never regained his place in the starting line-up. Several clubs became interested in his services, including West Ham United, a number of American teams, and Scottish side Heart of Midlothian, where Bobby Seith was the manager. Irvine played his last match for Brighton on 18 November 1972, when the team lost 0–1 at home to his former club Burnley.|$|E
5|$|On October 7, a large {{elongated}} extratropical cyclone extended {{across the}} Atlantic Ocean with a pressure of at most 1015 mbar (hPa; 29.98 inHg). The following day, the low-pressure area became more narrow and well-defined, with its central pressure deepening to 1000 mph (hPa; 29.53 inHg). On October 9, the extratropical system was analyzed {{to have become}} a tropical depression. The low moved slowly to the northeast and gradually weakened before dissipating on October 10. On October 14, offshore observations indicated that a tropical depression had developed north of The Bahamas. The following day, however, the depression became less defined and degenerated into a trough of low pressure. On October 16, two ships listed in the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set reported winds of 40 mph (65 km/h) {{off the coast of}} North Carolina. However, since these reports occurred <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> pressure gradient, the system was not included in HURDAT.|$|E
5|$|Smith was {{released}} by Chesterfield after he was not offered a new contract {{at the end of}} 2007–08. He trialled with Darlington of League Two, but was told by manager Dave Penney he was not what they were looking for. He then had a trial with newly relegated Conference Premier club Wrexham and eventually signed a contract with Gainsborough Trinity of the Conference North in late August. Smith made a goalscoring debut for Gainsborough with the team's goal in a 1–1 draw at home to Vauxhall Motors on 30 August. He joined York City in the Conference Premier on loan on 27 November, becoming Martin Foyle's first signing as manager, in a deal that would expire on 6 January 2009. Smith made his debut after coming on as a 63rd-minute substitute for Craig Farrell in a 1–1 draw with Salisbury City. His first goal came after scoring the opener for York with a close range finish in a 3–1 victory over Ebbsfleet United. Following this, Foyle stated his intention of extending Smith's loan at York. Smith said he was looking to join the club on a permanent contract and that Gainsborough manager Steve Charles would allow him to leave for a club <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> division on a free transfer. However, a move to York stalled in January as Gainsborough were holding out for a fee, although Foyle refused to pay this. York eventually made an offer of a quarter of Gainsborough's asking price, which was rejected.|$|E
