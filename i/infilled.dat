Between the entrance and two shops is the entrance to South London House, an office block above the station. The BS station building remains much as originally constructed and is a typical Leslie Green structure. The main alteration is a modern glass-sided and glass-topped flat-roofed extension abutting the original western elevation, giving access to three of the six arches. These arches, in a classic deep-red faience style, formed the original perimeter: two are <b>infilled</b> with street-facing shops. As the station also functions as a drivers' depot, London Underground uses the offices above the station for administration and drivers' accommodation.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Infilling</b> rock joints widely {{exist in}} natural rock masses, and the shear failure of <b>infilling</b> rock joints plays an {{important}} role in the instability of rock masses. In order to study the shear failure mechanism of <b>infilling</b> rock joints, Particle Flow Code is used to simulate the direct shear test of <b>infilling</b> rock joints. The PFC models with different <b>infilling</b> thickness are established firstly, and then the procedures of PFC simulation are described. In the end, the shear failure process of <b>infilling</b> rock joints with different <b>infilling</b> thickness is simulated. Based on the PFC simulation results, it can be concluded that the shear failure mode changes with increasing <b>infilling</b> thickness, and the shearing of the <b>infilling</b> rock joint rarely gives birth to microcracks in rock due to the existence of the <b>infilling</b> material...|$|R

40|$|Smart growth policies, {{in order}} to curtail low-density sprawl, seek to {{increase}} development in existing communities. These policies promote <b>infill</b> development, projects built on underutilized parcels in and surrounded by developed areas. While smart growth advocates view reduced sprawl as a benefit, local residents often fear <b>infill</b> will increase traffic congestion, eliminate open space, and result in other costs. Unfortunately, we know little about <b>infill</b> development overall and its impacts specifically. This dissertation addresses this gap by exploring residential <b>infill</b> development in Montgomery County, MD during the l 990 s and early 2000 s. This highly developed suburban jurisdiction experienced growing pains due to increased development during this time. The county also saw smart growth policies enacted, making it an excellent case study. The research first describes county residential <b>infill</b> trends from 1990 to 2006 and identifies <b>infill</b> sites. This section defines and offers a measure for <b>infill</b> development and identifies trends and patterns, focusing on changes in <b>infill</b> levels or characteristics. Next, the research uses hedonic pricing models to explore changes in nearby home values pre- and post-infill. A difference-in-difference design provides a comparison group analysis. Twenty-six <b>infill</b> sites were selected because they were built in relatively undisturbed residential neighborhoods, making such analysis possible. This research found <b>infill</b> to be a common occurrence throughout the study period, regularly comprising 70 % of all residential units built. The study did not find changes in <b>infill</b> development coinciding with a particular smart growth policy. Instead, <b>infill</b> mimicked overall development trends. <b>Infill</b> did have considerably smaller lot and structure sizes than non-infill. The hedonic pricing models found negative impacts on home values associated with some <b>infill</b> projects, with price declines ranging from 2 to 5 %. The impact varied by development type, with large projects causing the greatest price declines. Additionally, wealthier neighborhoods experienced a negative <b>infill</b> home price effect, while poorer areas experienced a positive effect [...] although not significant. Overall, positive outcomes were not the rule, and <b>infill</b> appears to generate costs. Planners and policymakers need to take this in to consideration when promoting <b>infill...</b>|$|R

5|$|However, by {{the turn}} of the 20th century, the {{quarries}} slowly fell into disuse and by the 1960s all of the remaining industrial areas had closed and the quarries <b>infilled,</b> though the sandstone properties at St Alban's Place and Co-Operative Terrace stand as a reminder to Windy Nook's industrial history. The decrease in employment opportunities led to a steady decline in population and although some housing developed along Stone Street and Coldwell Lane, the urban sprawl that enveloped most of the outlying settlements of Gateshead during the early 20th century never reached Windy Nook, so that in 1945 it remained largely unchanged in location and size. Despite some terraced housing being built in at Crossfield Park and Coltsfoot Gardens in the 197080's, the character of the suburb today remains suburban; the land is split 50/50 between residential properties and open green space and only 11.3% of the residential properties today are council housing. The result is that Windy Nook is a high-demand area for privately owned and social housing.|$|E
5|$|Although a court roll of 1389 {{mentions}} two gardens, {{there is}} no record of where these were sited, nor is there any record of when the terraces were constructed. The basic layout as known today was certainly in place by about 1730, {{as can be seen in}} a portrait of the house from that period. Later in the 18th century, the space behind the great pilastered wall was <b>infilled</b> to make the top terrace, which has wide views across the valley to the Mendip Hills beyond. The Octagon, a garden pavilion, was built about the same time, as was the more rustic summer house which faces it down the long grassy walk of the Pretty Terrace. Further modifications involved facing the lower retaining wall with rosy pink bricks, which were also used to build a double flight of steps below the Octagon. The garden is still largely in its 18th-century form, though small ponds and fountains were added in the 19th century and the once open hillside behind is now thickly wooded. A single rose arbour remained from the Edwardian garden but was on the verge of collapse when it was replaced with a new one in 2009, marking 300 years of the Elton family's presence at Clevedon Court.|$|E

To characterize the performance of masonry <b>infills,</b> commonly classified as non-structural elements, an extensive set of experimental test data is collected and examined in this work in order to develop fragility functions for the in-plane performance of masonry <b>infills.</b> The collected data stems from testing conducted in Europe, the Middle East and the United States and includes solid and hollow clay brick or concrete block <b>infills,</b> constructed to be in contact within either reinforced concrete or steel framing. The results indicate that <b>infill</b> masonry can exhibit first signs of damage at drifts as low as 0. 2 % but may not suffer complete failure until drifts as high as 2. 0 %.

40|$|Thesis (M. P. P. A., Public Policy and Administration) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2015. Although {{a recent}} survey of cities and {{counties}} ranks the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) environmental review process well below other barriers to implementing <b>infill</b> projects, many developers still feel CEQA is vexatious, creating uncertainty that hinders investment and drives up costs, especially when hampered by frivolous lawsuits. Developers believe CEQA adds time, cost, and uncertainty to <b>infill</b> and mixed-use development projects. This perception may deter needed development and inhibit the building industry???s shift to more <b>infill</b> development projects. While <b>infill</b> development will not satisfy all market demands, <b>infill</b> helps California meet the AB 32 ???s requirement to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Further, <b>infill</b> development creates a more sustainable development, a healthier environment, and a more vibrant quality of life. To boost <b>infill</b> development, the California Legislature adopted several CEQA reforms to streamline [...] or in some cases exempt [...] certain <b>infill</b> projects. No mechanism comprehensively tracks the use of specific <b>infill</b> streamlining provisions. Further, there is almost no empirical research that analyzes these streamlining provisions for either their effectiveness or promoting <b>infill</b> development. I conducted nine interviews {{to find out more about}} the CEQA reforms in SB 375 and SB 226, plus the exemption for residential <b>infill</b> development in SB 1925. I wanted to solicit information about individual experiences and perceptions within the real estate development industry. I also wanted to know about the challenges of using those CEQA streamlining provisions and exemptions. Most importantly, I wanted to know if the recent CEQA streamlining legislation supports <b>infill</b> development by making the environmental review process for these projects quicker, easier, and cheaper. My research revealed multiple barriers to <b>infill</b> development, but interview respondents agreed that <b>infill</b> development is harder than greenfield development. I also discovered several projects that used (or are using) recent CEQA reforms to streamline the environment review process. I believe that the recent streamlining provisions can reduce time and costs. While streamlining provisions help <b>infill</b> development, the process could be still faster, easier, and less expensive. I conclude that challenges still remain before CEQA streamlining reforms can really work. Public Policy and Administratio...|$|R

25|$|Geocells (also {{known as}} Cellular Confinement Systems) are {{three-dimensional}} honeycombed cellular structures that form a confinement system when <b>infilled</b> with compacted soil.

Traditionally used in slope protection and earth retention applications, geocells made from advanced polymers are being increasingly adopted for long-term road and rail load support.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the out-of-plane behaviour of masonry <b>infill</b> walls, quasi-static testing was performed on a masonry <b>infill</b> walls built inside a reinforced concrete frame {{by means of an}} airbag system to apply the uniform out-of-plane load to each component of the <b>infill.</b> The main advantage of this testing setup is that the out-of-plane loading can be applied more uniformly in the walls, contrarily to point load configuration. The test was performed under displacement control by selecting the mid-point of the <b>infill</b> as control point. Input and output air in the airbag was controlled by using a software to apply a specific displacement in the control point of the <b>infill</b> wall. The effect of the distance between the reaction frame of the airbag and the masonry <b>infill</b> on the effective contact area was previously analysed. Four load cells were attached to the reaction frame to measure the out-of-plane force. The effective contact area of the airbag was calculated by dividing the load measured in load cells by the pressure inside the airbag. When the distance between the reaction walls and the masonry <b>infill</b> wall is smaller, the effective area is closer to the nominal area of the airbag. Deformation and crack patterns of the <b>infill</b> confirm the formation of arching mechanism and two-way bending of the masonry <b>infill.</b> Until collapse of the horizontal interface between <b>infill</b> and upper beam in RC frame, the <b>infill</b> bends in two directions but the failure of that interface which is known as weakest interface due to difficulties in filling the mortar between bricks of last row and upper beam results in the crack opening trough a well-defined path and the consequent collapse of the <b>infill...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of halloysite and/or kaolinitein clay-rich, vein-like zones in saprolites in Hong Kong {{has provided the}} opportunity to examine the conditions determining the formation of one kaolin mineral or the other and also {{the nature of their}} particles. Clay-rich zones within tuffaceous or granitic saprolites from six different hillside sites have been examined in replicate samples by optical and scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and thermal analysis. Kaolin minerals, sometimes together with Mn oxides and Fe oxides/oxyhydroxides, have formed within discontinuities within the altered host rocks. The fabrics of kaolin <b>infills</b> generally indicated several generations of kaolin formation and that shear and deformation have commonly occurred within the <b>infills.</b> The <b>infills</b> were either light or dark in color. Light-colored <b>infills</b> often comprised pure, or nearly pure, halloysite or kaolinite. Dark Mn- and Fe-rich <b>infills</b> all contained kaolinite, while including some halloysite. The very halloysitic, light-colored <b>infills</b> occurred in saprolites in both granite and tuff as long tubular shapes in parallel bunches. The light-colored, very kaolinitic <b>infills</b> occurred in tuff only, in large platy or near-platy shapes within vermiform packets. In dark-colored <b>infills,</b> early kaolin mineral crystallization was limited by impurities from the breakdown of primary minerals leaving dissolved and re-precipitated compounds of Mn and Fe within the <b>infill.</b> Kaolin minerals in <b>infill</b> at all the sites except one are considered to have formed as a result of weathering. The exception comprises white <b>infills</b> in tuff that are composed of extremely small, closely packed particles, suggesting formation by hydrothermal action.

Drying, with the formation of Mn and/or Fe oxides/oxyhydroxides, had occurred several times, indicating enhanced drainage. Where drying had occurred, kaolinite had formed.
