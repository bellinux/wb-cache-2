40|$|The paper {{provides}} some background {{information about the}} developments in the prawn fishing technique. The important indigenous gear for prawns are the filtering type nets like the stake nets, boat seines and beach seines with bag. The only indigenous net, which can be compared in design with the modern bottom trawling gear, is the "Thuri Valai" of the Madras Coast. Prawns have also been reported from the catches of gill nets and cast nets. Dredges and beam trawls are simplest among the <b>dragged</b> <b>gear.</b> Even though several earlier attempts were made with the beam trawl, in 1959 season a detailed experiment was made to study the fishing features of this gear. The subsequent experiments conducted were for comparison with otter trawl, towing of 2 beam trawls one behind the other {{and the use of}} tickler chain. The initial experiments with otter trawls were mainly directed towards operational aspects. The experiments were {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} fully mechanised and partially mechanised operation, the effect of extra buoyancy of floats and the use of tickler chain. Subsequent developments had been on the structure and design of prawn trawling gear. Effect of long wings and sweeps were tested. Catches of nylon and cotton nets were compared. The sizes of meshes of the cod-end have also been increased...|$|E

40|$|Lethal and {{sublethal}} {{fishing gear}} entanglement is pervasive in North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis). Entanglement {{can lead to}} direct injury {{and is likely to}} incur substantial energetic costs. This study (1) evaluates drag characteristics of entangled right whales, (2) contextualizes <b>gear</b> <b>drag</b> measurements for individual whales, and (3) quantifies the benefits of partial disentanglement. A load cell measured drag forces on 15 sets of fishing gear removed from entangled right whales, a towed satellite telemetry buoy, and 200 m of polypropylene line as it was shortened to 25 m, as they were towed behind a vessel at ~ 0. 77, 1. 3, and 2. 1 m/s (~ 1. 5, 2. 5, and 4 knots) and ~ 0, 3, and 6 m depth. Mean drag ranges from 8. 5 N to 315 N, and can be predicted from the dry weight or length of the <b>gear.</b> Combining <b>gear</b> <b>drag</b> measurements with theoretical estimates of drag on whales’ bodies suggests that on average, entanglement increases drag and propulsive power by 1. 47 fold.

However in the controlled environment of a laboratory it is difficult to test the robustness of the order-tracking procedure. The need thus exists to adjust the order tracking procedure so that it will be effective in the mining environment. The procedure needs to be adjusted to function with a two pulse per revolution speed input. The <b>drag</b> <b>gear</b> aboard a dragline rotates in two directions. This gives the unique opportunity to observe the performance of the order tracking method in a bi-directional rotating environment allowing relationships between the results of each operating direction to be investigated. A monitoring station was set up aboard a dragline and data was captured twice daily for a period spanning one year. The data captured consisted of accelerometer and proximity sensor data. The key on the shaft triggers the proximity sensors allowing speed and direction to be measured. The rudimentary measured speed is interpolated using various documented speed interpolation techniques and by a newly developed speed interpolation technique. The interpolated speed is then used to complete the order tracking procedure that re-samples the vibration data with reference to the speed. The results indicate that computed order tracking can be successfully implemented in typical mining environments. Furthermore there is a distinct relationship between vibration data taken in both rotational directions: one direction provides a better indication of incipient failure. It is thus important not to choose a direction randomly when monitoring rotating machinery of this kind. Dissertation (MEng) [...] University of Pretoria, 2008.

40|$|Gearbox {{efficiency}} is reduced at high rotational speeds due to windage drag and viscous effects on rotating, meshed gear components. A goal of NASA aeronautics rotorcraft research {{is aimed at}} propulsion technologies that improve efficiency while minimizing vehicle weight. Specifically, reducing power losses to rotorcraft gearboxes would allow gains {{in areas such as}} vehicle payload, range, mission type, and fuel consumption. To that end, a gear windage rig has been commissioned at NASA Glenn Research Center to measure windage <b>drag</b> on <b>gears</b> and to test methodologies to mitigate windage power losses. One method used in rotorcraft gearbox design attempts to reduce gear windage power loss by utilizing close clearance walls to enclose the gears in both the axial and radial directions. The close clearance shrouds result in reduced <b>drag</b> on the <b>gear</b> teeth and reduced power loss. For meshed spur gears, the shrouding takes the form of metal side plates and circumferential metal sectors. Variably positioned axial and radial shrouds are incorporated in the NASA rig to study the effect of shroud clearance on gearbox power loss. A number of researchers have given experimental and analytical results for single spur gears, with and without shrouding. Shrouded meshed spur gear test results are sparse in the literature. Windage tests were run at NASA Glenn using meshed spur gears at four shroud configurations: unshrouded, shrouded (max. axial, max. radial), and two intermediate shrouding conditions. Results are compared to available meshed spur gear power loss data analyses as well as single spur gear data analyses...|$|R

50|$|The Mk.1 and Mk.1A {{computers}} were electromechanical, {{and many of}} their mechanical calculations required drive movements of precise speeds. They used reversible two-phase capacitor-run induction motors with tungsten contacts. These were stabilized primarily by rotary magnetic drag (eddy-current) slip clutches, similar to classical rotating-magnet speedometers, but with a much higher torque. One part of the <b>drag</b> was <b>geared</b> to the motor, and the other was constrained by a fairly stiff spring. This spring offset the null position of the contacts by an amount proportional to motor speed, thus providing velocity feedback. Flywheels mounted on the motor shafts, but coupled by magnetic drags, prevented contact chatter when the motor was at rest. Unfortunately, the flywheels must also have slowed down the servos somewhat.A more elaborate scheme, which placed a rather large flywheel and differential between the motor and the magnetic drag, eliminated velocity error for critical data, such as gun orders.|$|R
