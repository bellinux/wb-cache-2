50|$|Temperature inversions occur most {{frequently}} along coastal areas bordering large bodies of water. This {{is the result}} of natural onshore movement of <b>cool,</b> humid <b>air</b> shortly after sunset when the <b>ground</b> <b>air</b> <b>cools</b> more quickly than the upper air layers. The same action may take place in the morning when the rising sun warms the upper layers.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{very common}} to have {{temperature}} inversions forming near the <b>ground,</b> for instance <b>air</b> <b>cooling</b> at night while remaining warm aloft. This happens equally aloft when a warm and dry airmass overrides a cooler one, like in the subsidence aloft cause by a high pressure intensifying. The index of refraction of air increases in both cases and the EM wave bends toward the ground instead of continuing upward.|$|R
50|$|City Hall was {{designed}} and built with a non-powered air-conditioning system, taking advantage of strong prevailing winds from Lake Erie. Large vents {{were placed on the}} west side of the building to catch wind, which would then travel down ducts to beneath the basement, to be cooled by the <b>ground.</b> This <b>cooled</b> <b>air</b> was then vented throughout the building. Winds off the lake were usually strong enough to power air through this system.|$|R
25|$|Temperature {{variations}} {{are closely}} correlated with direct sunlight. The sun quickly warms {{the ground by}} a few degrees, which in turn warms the air close to the <b>ground.</b> This <b>air</b> <b>cools</b> to reach equilibrium with the mean air temperature very quickly when the sky becomes overcast. The layer of air within half a metre of {{the ground in the}} valleys also exhibit different temperatures at night to the air layer above it. During the clear nights of the dry season, the ground cools quickly <b>cooling</b> the <b>air</b> next to it. This leads to katabatic winds from the ridges into the valleys resulting in the valley bottoms being colder than the higher ridges flanking them. Baker found that the Teleki valley was regularly 2°C colder at night than the surrounding ridges. This has forced plants such as the senecios and lobellias to be tall to avoid key parts freezing, as freezing is lethal for plants.|$|R

In this paper, we simulate the solidification of 60 t Q 235 huge rectangular ingot with ProCAST in different cooling conditions such as <b>air</b> <b>cooling,</b> forced <b>air</b> <b>cooling</b> and water cooling.

40|$|Abstract: In high {{temperature}} coal mine, the surface <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> heat exchange efficiency decreases greatly {{because of high}} humidity and dust. In order to improve the heat exchange efficiency, {{the surface of the}} <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> needs to be designed to reduce the dust adhesion, and improve the heat exchange efficiency. Based on the self-cleaning effect of lotus leaf, the surface of <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> is designed and fin and tube are processed into the constructure of lotus leaf surface. With Ansys, the <b>cooling</b> effect of <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> is simulated, and the experiment is done to test the heat exchange effect of the common <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> and bionic <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> in lab. By analysis, it can be concluded that the surface of bionic <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> has the function of self-cleaning, and the structure can increase the heat exchange efficiency, which is higher above 30 % than that of common <b>air</b> <b>cooler...</b>|$|R

40|$|Solar XXI {{building}} is a low energy office building where passive and active solar strategies have been applied to reduce the use of energy for heating,cooling and lighting, combining also an extensive photovoltaic façade for electricity production. Solar XXI opened in 2006 and is considered a high efficient building, close to a {{net zero energy building}} (NZEB), where the difference between the energy consumed and that produced is 1 / 10 th of the energy consumed by a Portuguese standard new office building. Its design includes many energy efficiency concepts, such as a high insulated envelope,south sun exposure, windows external shading, photovoltaic panels heat recovery,ground-cooling system, daylighting, stack effect and cross ventilation.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this study}} a cold {{production}} process was proposed for inlet <b>air</b> <b>cooling</b> in which cryogenic energy from {{liquefied natural gas}} (LNG) was sufficiently converted to cold energy. The effect of using the cold production process for inlet <b>air</b> <b>cooling</b> on the off-design performance of a gas turbine combined cycle was analyzed under different ambient conditions. The cold output of the proposed process was increased by about 38. 1 % to 42. 5 % {{compared to that of}} the conventional cold production process that involves direct LNG evaporation. Furthermore for the inlet <b>air</b> <b>cooling,</b> the proposed method increased the relative power increment from 2. 2 % to 14. 4 % and the relative efficiency increment from 0. 7 % to 2. 2 %, mainly depending on the variations in the relative humidity, compared to cold production without <b>air</b> <b>cooling.</b> The relative power and relative efficiency of the proposed <b>air</b> <b>cooling</b> were increased by 0. 6 % to 3. 1 % and 0. 3 % to 0. 5 %, respectively, above those of the traditional <b>air</b> <b>cooling...</b>|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the spatial variation of temperature, relative humidity and black globe humidity temperature (BGHT) index in growing-finishing swine facilities, with and without evaporative <b>air</b> <b>cooler.</b> The experiment was conducted in a 60 x 9 m facility containing 32 pens of 3. 20 x 4. 00 m each, divided into two sectors. The treatments were without evaporative <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> (control) and with evaporative <b>air</b> <b>cooler.</b> Temperature and relative humidity data were collected weekly in two periods (morning and afternoon) at 32 different sampling points, encompassing the center of each pen and the outer perimeter of the facility. Animal performance variables were: feed intake, feed conversion, weight out of the nursery, slaughter weight, weight gain and daily weight gain. According to the results, the analyzed variables showed spatial dependence, with lower temperature and higher relative humidity in the evaporative <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> environment. However, evaporative <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> system provided better environment thermal conditions inside the facilities, lowering BGHT values, which were lower in the adiabatic cooling sector.

40|$|To {{reduce the}} chiller energy {{consumption}} {{in a central}} air-conditioning system, a heat exchanger, acting as an <b>air</b> <b>cooler,</b> can be installed before an air handling unit to pre-cool the fresh <b>air</b> by recovering <b>cooling</b> capacity from exhaust air. However, studies on evaluating the performances of <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> under condensation condition are limited. Therefore, an experimental {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the plate type <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> performance under four operating modes (dry/wet mode, low/high air humidity). Under dry operating mode, the <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> serves as a traditional air cooler; while under wet operating mode, it works as an indirect evaporative cooler (IEC). The cooler dynamic performances during different operating mode transition were investigated. The steady performances under different parameter influence were also comparatively studied. The results show that wet operating improves the sensible and latent <b>cooling</b> capacities of <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> significantly. Condensation takes place under high humidity inlet air, results in decreasing of sensible efficiency but increasing of latent efficiency and total heat transfer rate. The coefficient of performance (COP) of IEC is higher than that of traditional <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> under the same testing configuration. The highest COP can reach 9. 0 and achieved under wet operating mode with condensation. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R
