5|$|Finn and Rachel {{reveal their}} {{marriage}} plans to New Directions, {{most of whom}} are less than enthused. Rachel's two fathers Hiram and LeRoy Berry (Jeff Goldblum and Brian Stokes Mitchell), along with Finn's mother Carole (Romy Rosemont) and his step-father Burt Hummel (Mike O'Malley), act very supportive and arrange <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>couple</b> to spend the night together in Rachel's room, expecting that the reality of having to live together will encourage the teens to postpone their wedding. The ruse backfires, and the engaged pair announce that they will be getting married even sooner than planned.|$|E
5|$|In 1827, Mary Shelley was {{party to}} a scheme that enabled her friend Isabel Robinson and Isabel's lover, Mary Diana Dods, who wrote {{under the name}} David Lyndsay, {{to embark on a}} life {{together}} in France as man and wife. With the help of Payne, whom she kept in the dark about the details, Mary Shelley obtained false passports <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>couple.</b> In 1828, she fell ill with smallpox while visiting them in Paris. Weeks later she recovered, unscarred but without her youthful beauty.|$|E

Unusually, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>couple,</b> the film was based on a true story, that of Crystal Lee Jordan. It was arguably their best received film, winning numerous awards, including two Academy Awards.|$|E

30|$|Fletcher [2] {{proposed}} the analytic solution of two-dimensional coupled Burgers equations using the Hopf-Cole transformation. And the numerical solutions of coupled Burgers equations have attracted considerable attention of many researchers [1, 3 – 8]. Srivastava et al. [1, 5 – 7] gave the implicit finite-difference scheme, the Crank-Nicolson scheme, the semi-implicit finite-difference scheme, and the Crank-Nicolson semi-implicit scheme <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>coupled</b> Burgers equations. Bahadir [3] obtained a fully implicit finite-difference scheme to solve <b>the</b> <b>coupled</b> Burgers equations. Jain and Holla [4] developed two algorithms based on cubic spline method <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>coupled</b> Burgers equations. Kweyu et al. [8] gave an explicit scheme <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>coupled</b> Burgers equations under varied initial and boundary conditions.|$|R
5|$|After the reclusive and bookish scholar Vasily Ordynov is {{compelled}} {{to leave his}} apartment he wanders aimlessly through Saint Petersburg, contemplating his despair over a loveless life, his childhood and his future. Through this distraction he finds himself within a church, where he notices an old man, Ilia Murin, with his young wife, Katerina. His fascination <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>couple,</b> particularly Katerina, causes him to contrive further encounters, {{with the intention of}} securing a lodging at their home. He becomes their house guest. The gloomy Murin is a perceived Old Believer, with powers of clairvoyance that have perturbed his neighbours and the local police, and which appear to control his wife. Katerina implies that Murin was her mother's lover, that she might be Murin's biological daughter, and that the pair ran-off together after he killed her father. There is an unresolved suggestion that Murin caused the death of Katerina's fiancé during their escape.|$|E

Elvis had also been seeing other women on and off, often leaving Priscilla at home with Lisa Marie. Due to Elvis' being away so often, the marriage soured.|$|E
25|$|In 1933 Gamow was {{suddenly}} granted permission {{to attend the}} 7th Solvay Conference on physics, in Brussels.

Marlynn's father subsequently purchased three Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants in Waterloo, Iowa, and Gacy and his wife moved to Waterloo so he could manage the restaurants, with the understanding that they would move into Marlynn's parents' home (which was vacated <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>couple).</b>|$|E

After the European theatre of war ended in May 1945 it took six months <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>couple</b> to find each other.

Alexander I was allowed to join her in the French capital six months later. Officially, the monarch made a state visit to the Allies' heads of state gathered at the Peace Conference.
