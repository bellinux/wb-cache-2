5000|$|<b>Isobenzan</b> (telodrin) is {{a highly}} toxic {{organochloride}} insecticide. It was produced only in the period from 1958 to 1965 and its use has been since discontinued. [...] It is a persistent organic pollutant that can remain in soil for 2 to 7 years, and the biological half-life of <b>isobenzan</b> in human blood {{is estimated to be}} about 2.8 years.|$|E
40|$|The crystal {{structure}} of <b>isobenzan</b> {{was determined by}} direct methods. The crystals are monoclinic, (C 2 /c) with Z = 16, in a cell of dimensions a = 2571 (1), b = 1735 (2), c = 1361 (1) pm; β = 100. 65 (1) °. The structure was refined by least squares to R 0. 073 with 1650 unique reflections collected on an automated equi-inclination diffractometer. The two molecules (A, B) of <b>isobenzan</b> in the asymmetric unit are similar and possess the exo- 1, exo- 3 -chlorine arrangement and the endo tetrahydrofuran configuration, previously proposed {{on the basis of}} chemical evidence. This results in the molecules possessing approximate C(m) point symmetry with the bridgehead carbon and its attached chlorines, and the epoxide oxygen lying in the mirror plane. There is no evidence of intermolecular association involving oxygen or chlorine...|$|E
