40|$|Abstract. The paper {{presents}} {{general aspects}} regarding {{the impact that}} the activities of producing electrical and thermic energy at S. E. Craiova II, have upon the environment. It was taken into consideration only the pollution caused by the evacuation of the emissions of solid and gaseous pollutants contained in the <b>burning</b> <b>gasses.</b> The <b>burning</b> <b>gasses</b> resulted from the technological process are evacuated in the atmosphere through different installations such as <b>gas</b> canals, <b>burning</b> <b>gasses</b> ventilators and dispersion stacks. The main purpose of the dispersions stacks is to ensure the dispersion and to maintain the pollutants level in {{the limits of the}} admitted values. For establishing the model of transport and dispersion of pollutants in atmosphere, there were taken into account the meteorological, topographical factors and also those factors that are related with the pollution source. The results, presented as pollutions maps, were obtained through processing, interpretation and by comparing the experimental data from year 2007 with the European and national environment standards and normative. The mathematical modelling of pollutants dispersion revealed a small level of imissions, and that is mainly because of the height of the <b>burning</b> <b>gasses</b> emissions stacks...|$|R
25|$|Heaters that burn {{natural gas}} {{drastically}} {{reduce the amount}} of creosote buildup due to natural <b>gas</b> <b>burning</b> much cleaner and more efficiently than traditional solid fuels. While in most cases {{there is no need to}} clean a gas chimney on an annual basis that does not mean that other parts of the chimney cannot fall into disrepair. Disconnected or loose chimney fittings caused by corrosion over time can pose serious dangers for residents due to leakage of carbon monoxide into the home. Thus, it is recommended—and in some countries even mandatory—that chimneys be inspected annually and cleaned on a regular basis to prevent these problems. The workers who perform this task are called chimney sweeps or steeplejacks. This work used to be done largely by child labour, and as such features in Victorian literature. In the Middle Ages in some parts of Europe, a crow-stepped gable design was developed, partly to provide access to chimneys without use of ladders.|$|E

2500|$|With the {{discovery}} of oil in Lima in 1885, Ohio began {{what came to be}} called the [...] "Oil Boom of Northwest Ohio." [...] Discovery actually began in Findlay, Ohio, a city forty miles north of Lima. The discovery of natural gas deposits there in 1884 led to national marketing efforts advertising free gas, as Findlay's business leaders tried to [...] "boom" [...] the town. In 1885, Benjamin C. Faurot of Lima was one of hundreds of businessmen who visited Findlay to see the seemingly unlimited supply of natural <b>gas</b> <b>burning</b> day and night. Faurot owned the Lima Paper Mill. He spent $2,500 on energy consumption annually. Water for his operation was also a problem. So Faurot decided to drill in Lima – for gas or water. Faurot's first oil, found along the Ottawa River on May 19, 1885, was more accidental discovery than deliberate scientific experiment.|$|E

The PDE system momentum is equal in absolute value to the exhausted gas momentum, but in the opposite direction.

60|$|We went to sleep, and at {{a quarter}} before eight in the morning I was out, and hurrying, for I {{was to take the}} 8.29 train for New York. I found the <b>gas</b> <b>burning</b> brightly--full head--all over the first floor. My new {{overcoat}} was gone; my old umbrella was gone; my new patent-leather shoes, which I had never worn, were gone. The large window which opened into the ombra {{at the rear of the}} house was standing wide. I passed out through it and tracked the burglar down the hill through the trees; tracked him without difficulty, because he had blazed his progress with imitation silver napkin-rings, and my umbrella, and various other things which he had disapproved of; and I went back in triumph and proved to my wife that he was a disappointed burglar. I had suspected he would be, from the start, and from his not coming up to our floor to get human beings.|$|E
60|$|He {{left the}} <b>gas</b> <b>burning,</b> {{and with the}} lamp {{in his left hand}} and the pistol in his right slowly ascended the stairs. The first landing was clear. He opened the doors of each room, and, holding the lamp aloft, peered in. Then he mounted higher, and looked in the rooms, crammed from floor to ceiling with pledges, ticketed and placed on shelves. In one room he thought he saw {{something}} crouching in a corner. He entered boldly, and as he passed along one side of a row of shelves could have sworn that he heard a stealthy footfall on the other. He rushed back to the door, and hung listening over the shaky balusters. Nothing stirred, and, satisfied that he must have been mistaken, he gave up the search and went to his bedroom. He set the lamp down on the drawers, and turned to close the door, when he distinctly heard a noise in the shop below. He snatched up the lamp again and ran hastily downstairs, pausing halfway on the lowest flight as he saw a dark figure spreadeagled against the side door, standing on tiptoe to draw back the bolt.|$|E

60|$|Pausing in his {{intention}} {{to turn off the}} <b>gas</b> <b>burning</b> {{in the middle of the}} shop, Mr Verloc descended into the abyss of moral reflections. With the insight of a kindred temperament he pronounced his verdict. A lazy lot—this Karl Yundt, nursed by a blear-eyed old woman, a woman he had years ago enticed away from a friend, and afterwards had tried more than once to shake off into the gutter. Jolly lucky for Yundt that she had persisted in coming up time after time, or else there would have been no one now to help him out of the ’bus by the Green Park railings, where that spectre took its constitutional crawl every fine morning. When that indomitable snarling old witch died the swaggering spectre would have to vanish too—there would be an end to fiery Karl Yundt. And Mr Verloc’s morality was offended also by the optimism of Michaelis, annexed by his wealthy old lady, who had taken lately to sending him to a cottage she had in the country. The ex-prisoner could moon about the shady lanes for days together in a delicious and humanitarian idleness. As to Ossipon, that beggar was sure to want for nothing as long as there were silly girls with savings-bank books in the world. And Mr Verloc, temperamentally identical with his associates, drew fine distinctions in his mind on the strength of insignificant differences. He drew them with a certain complacency, because the instinct of conventional respectability was strong within him, being only overcome by his dislike of all kinds of recognised labour—a temperamental defect which he shared with a large proportion of revolutionary reformers of a given social state. For obviously one does not revolt against the advantages and opportunities of that state, but against the price which must be paid for the same in the coin of accepted morality, self-restraint, and toil. The majority of revolutionists are the enemies of discipline and fatigue mostly. There are natures too, to whose sense of justice the price exacted looms up monstrously enormous, odious, oppressive, worrying, humiliating, extortionate, intolerable. Those are the fanatics. The remaining portion of social rebels is accounted for by vanity, the mother of all noble and vile illusions, the companion of poets, reformers, charlatans, prophets, and incendiaries.|$|E

50|$|The chief {{advantage}} of a ram accelerator over a conventional gun is its scalability. In a normal gun, maximum pressure is exerted {{at the time of}} the initial charge detonation. As the projectile moves further down the barrel, the amount of acceleration upon the projectile decreases as the gas behind it expands, eventually reaching amounts trivial enough that a longer barrel is no longer justified (see internal ballistics). With a ram accelerator, the projectile is propelled primarily by the pressure generated by the reaction of the propellant <b>gases</b> <b>burning</b> just behind the projectile. This leads to constant pressure being put both on the gun and the projectile itself. Consequently, far longer barrels are possible than conventional guns, while still delivering a strong constant acceleration to the projectile.|$|R
