50|$|Prior to Infinite Crisis, Grundy is {{manipulated}} by Gorilla Grodd via mind control into attacking Batman and Superman for President Luthor for {{the bounty of}} one billion dollars in Superman/Batman. Batman is able to stop Grundy. While no specifics are given, Solomon Grundy is also coerced into joining the Secret Society of Super Villains. He participates in the final strike against the Secret Six. Ragdoll II encounters Grundy in a doorway. Ragdoll's scarred face relates to Grundy, and Grundy goes on to turn against the Secret Society. The aftermath of that battle is inconclusive, but Grundy evidently survives, as he was last seen in a murky swamp in JSA Classified. In it, he is convinced by Icicle to <b>help</b> <b>Wizard,</b> who is in trouble.|$|E

50|$|On April 16, Wall {{scored a}} playoff career-high 32 {{points in a}} 114-107 win over the Atlanta Hawks in Game 1 of their first-round series. In Game 6 of the series on April 28, Wall set a new playoff career with 42 points to <b>help</b> the <b>Wizards</b> {{eliminate}} the Hawks with a 115-99 victory, capturing the opening-round series 4-2. On May 12, he <b>helped</b> the <b>Wizards</b> avoid elimination and force a Game 7 in their second-round series against the Boston Celtics after hitting the game-winning 3-pointer with 3.5 seconds left in Game 6, lifting the Wizards to a 92-91 win. He finished the game with 26 points. The Wizards went on to lose Game 7 despite Wall's 18 points and 11 assists, as they bowed out of the playoffs with a 4-3 defeat.|$|R

50|$|Connwaer, a pickpocket on {{the streets}} of the Twilight, one day picks the pocket of a {{powerful}} wizard named Nevery and steals his locus magicalicus, a special stone that <b>helps</b> <b>wizards</b> connect to the magical power of the city. It should kill Conn, but Nevery stops the process by saying a spell using Conn's name. It turns out that Nevery has just returned (or rather, snuck in) after a 20-year exile, to try to save the town from the leaching of its magic, upon which so much, including its economy, depends. Curious about the boy, Nevery takes him on as a servant and then later an apprentice. Although it is the wizard's job to stem the tide of the disappearing magic, he seems unable to do so. Conn believes he knows the answer, but his enemies are closing in.|$|R
50|$|On November 14, 2015, Humphries made 5-of-8 three-pointers {{on his way}} to a game-high 23 points, <b>helping</b> the <b>Wizards</b> {{defeat the}} Orlando Magic 108-99. Prior to the 2015-16 season, Humphries had gone more than a decade since making a three-pointer. He hit two in his 2004-05 rookie season, and none after that, until this game.|$|R
40|$|Modeling the {{functions}} of a teacher in a computer interface {{is not a new}} practice; most computer applications employ electronic performance support systems (EPSS) such as online <b>help,</b> <b>wizards,</b> coaches, and even some forms of artificial intelligence. This paper presents easy-to-implement strategies for increasing learner autonomy by embedding teacher functions within the World Wide Web-based graphical user interface (GUI). The embedded teacher (ET) model proposed in this paper is similar to the butler model, which describes a good interface as performing many of the roles of a good butler (e. g., helping a person enter, exit, and move from room to room). The ET model combines the butler model with core and complementary information zones by recommending that four overall teacher functions be embedded into a GUI: (1) orienting the learner; (2) providing navigational assistance; (3) providing instructional strategies; and (4) providing interactive feedback. Altogether these four elements work t...|$|R
5000|$|Player {{characters}} typically {{alternate between}} {{the role of}} a magus (plural magi; female maga/magae), and a companion (Consors). Companions are select skilled non-magi who <b>help</b> <b>wizards</b> conduct their affairs (as magi tend to be distanced from [...] "mundanes" [...] due to the effects of their magical [...] "Gift"). Additionally, {{there are a number of}} Grogs (usually skilled peasants, often bodyguards or watchmen) who can be controlled by any player. (As of the Third Edition, Grogs are also a viable player 'class'; the Fifth Edition has added an entire supplement dedicated to 'fleshing out' Grogs.) The wizards generally gather in specialized strongholds called covenants, which are often built in places of power. A covenant is typically a 'home base' where the magi are in charge (though they may travel Mythic Europe for reasons of politics, resources, study or even leisure). Some consider the covenant to be the central character of the game.|$|R

50|$|The Tower of Art is the 800 ft tower {{that forms}} the University's core. It has a total of 8,888 {{steps up to the}} top (on the Disc the number 8 has great mystical significance). Originally the Tower was the only {{building}} on campus, but teaching has long since moved on to other buildings. The Tower itself is usually only used for astronomical and other observations requiring altitude and the traditional May Morning chorus song from its top (inaudible to anyone but the chorus, but traditionally applauded by all below). While historical wizards were known to build towers for themselves, the builders are unknown. It is certainly older than both the city and the University around it, and some have speculated that it is older than the Disc itself, although evidence for this is scarce. In the novel Sourcery it survives many magical attacks; other, newer towers do not. In the same novel it became important for the heroic wizard Rincewind, as towers <b>help</b> <b>wizards</b> fulfill their potential.|$|R
50|$|The Wizard {{is among}} the {{characters}} recruited in The Hood's syndicate of villains. He is then seen in a blue uniform reminiscent of his original outfit. <b>Wizard</b> <b>helped</b> them fight the New Avengers but was taken down by Doctor Strange.|$|R

50|$|Dan, Amy, and Nellie {{arrive in}} the Hotel Excelsior, a stronghold built by Bae Oh, Alistair's uncle. Bae finds them in the hotel's stronghold and traps them. They find the fourth clue, half a gram of myrrh, through a Sakhet statue Grace left them. They barely escape with Nellie and their cat Saladin's <b>help.</b> Jonah <b>Wizard</b> later traps them in a deserted island on the Nile. Some local {{fisherman}} save them and return them to Egypt.|$|R
50|$|Artemis later {{changed her}} codename to Tigress {{and became the}} on-again, off-again lovers with the second Icicle. He invited {{her back into the}} reformation of the Injustice Society. She <b>helped</b> him, <b>Wizard,</b> Solomon Grundy, Gentleman Ghost, Rag Doll and Thinker break into JSA {{headquarters}} and steal the Prometheus Key, a key that is used to open doors between reality and magic. This allowed Johnny Sorrow who had asked the Wizard to bring him back, to re-enter the earth.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the summer}} of 2006, Baker {{underwent}} ankle surgery, and was deemed [...] "about 80 percent of the player he was before" [...] the surgery. For the 2006-07 season, Baker returned to the Dakota Wizards, with the team now playing in the NBA Development League. In their first D-League season, Baker <b>helped</b> the <b>Wizards</b> win the championship. He again played for Dakota in 2007-08, departing the team in January 2008 to join Paris-Levallois of the LNB Pro A.|$|R
50|$|On May 12, 2017, Beal <b>helped</b> the <b>Wizards</b> avoid {{elimination}} {{and force}} a Game 7 in their second-round playoff {{series against the}} Boston Celtics with a game-high 33 points in a 92-91 Game 6 win. In Game 7 three days later, Beal led the Wizardsâ€”a team playing in its first Game 7 since 1979â€”with 38 points, including 24 in the second half, but he couldn't lead them to victory as they fell 115-105 to bow out of the playoffs with a 4-3 defeat.|$|R
5000|$|First through {{threat of}} force, then through violence, the Chief Duffer said all they wanted was Lucy's <b>help.</b> The <b>wizard</b> who ruled the island, Coriakin, had cast a spell on the Duffers, making them [...] "uglified". To combat this, the Duffers stole {{away to the}} wizard's chamber and read a spell from the wizard's book to make them invisible. Now, they were tired {{of not being able}} to see one another, and Lucy was the only one who could help them.|$|R
5000|$|Halfling Rogue-Orphaned {{at the age}} of 5, this rogue {{was left}} in the care of the Seven Stars Crew, a feared gang of rogues. She was trained, and then <b>helped</b> a <b>wizard</b> of some renown to attain some amulets. 10 years later she found out that the same wizard had {{destroyed}} her village. Kaedin was his name, and she left for Baele to exact revenge. 150 years later, her conviction to kill the wizard is still as strong as ever.|$|R
5000|$|Natasatch: A green female dragon who is enslaved {{and sold}} to the Wyrmmaster. Along with other females she was kept captive and forced to <b>help</b> the <b>wizard</b> breed his army for years, later helping to stage an {{uprising}} and evicting the humans from the isle. She becomes AuRon's mate {{at the end of}} Dragon Champion. In [...] "Dragon Rule" [...] she develops a keen interest in the newly emergent Empire society that leads to her separation from AuRon during his exile.|$|R

50|$|On February 27, 2014, Gortat {{recorded}} a career-high 31 points and 12 rebounds in a 134-129 triple overtime {{win over the}} Toronto Raptors. On May 13, he recorded 31 points (his playoff career high) and 16 rebounds to <b>help</b> the <b>Wizards</b> avoid elimination in Game 5 of their second round series with the Indiana Pacers. He became the first Wizards player with at least 30 points and 15 rebounds in a playoff game since Moses Malone in 1987. The Wizards went on to lose Game 6 of the series, falling 4-2 to the Pacers.|$|R

50|$|In 2003, Conrad {{was traded}} to the Wizards for a second-round draft pick, which the 'Quakes used to select Arturo Alvarez. Conrad's stock rose while with Kansas City; never a big scorer, he tallied four goals during his first season (he has ten in his MLS career). In 2004, he <b>helped</b> the <b>Wizards</b> to the US Open Cup and the MLS Cup Final {{as the leader of the}} league's stingiest defense and was named to the league's Best XI and was a finalist for MLS Defender of the Year Award. He won the award a year later.|$|R
