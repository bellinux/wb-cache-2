40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effects of N-(m-bromoanilinomethyl) - p-isopropoxyphenylsuccinimide (BAM-IPPS - a new succinimide derivative) on the protective action of four classical antiepileptic drugs (AEDs: carbamazepine [CBZ], phenobarbital [PB], phenytoin [PHT] and valproate [VPA]) in the mouse maximal electroshock (MES) -induced tonic seizure model. Tonic hind limb extension (seizure activity) was evoked in adult male albino Swiss mice by a current (sine-wave, 25 mA, 500 V, 50 Hz, 0. 2 s stimulus duration) delivered via <b>ear-clip</b> electrodes. BAM-IPPS administered (i. p.) at a dose of 150 mg/kg significantly elevated the threshold for electroconvulsions in mice (P< 0. 05). Lower doses of BAM-IPPS (50 and 100 mg/kg) had no significant impact on the threshold for electroconvulsions in mice. Moreover, BAM-IPPS (100 mg/kg) did not significantly affect the anticonvulsant potency of CBZ, PB, PHT and VPA in the mouse MES model. BAM-IPPS elevated the threshold for electroconvulsions in mice in a dosedependent manner. However, BAM-IPPS (100 mg/kg) did not affect the anticonvulsant action of various classical AEDs in the mouse MES model, making the combinations of BAM-IPPS with CBZ, PB, PHT and VPA neutral, from a preclinical point of view...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of SYM 2206 (a potent non-competitive AMPA receptor antagonist) on the threshold for maximal electroshock (MEST) -induced seizures in mice. Electroconvulsions were produced in mice by means of a current (sinewave, 50 Hz, maximum 500 V, strength from 4 to 14 mA, 0. 2 -s stimulus duration, tonic hind limb extension taken as the endpoint) delivered via <b>ear-clip</b> electrodes. SYM 2206 administered systemically (i. p.), 30 min before the MEST test, at doses of 2. 5 and 5 mg/kg, did not alter the threshold for maximal electroconvulsions in mice. In contrast, SYM 2206 at doses of 10 and 20 mg/kg significantly elevated the threshold for maximal electroconvulsions in mice (P< 0. 01 and P< 0. 001). Linear regression analysis of SYM 2206 doses and their corresponding threshold increases allowed for the determination of threshold increasing doses by 20 % and 50 % (TID 20 and TID 50 values) that elevate the threshold in drug-treated animals over the threshold in control animals. The experimentally derived TID 20 and TID 50 values for SYM 2206 were 4. 25 and 10. 56 mg/kg, respectively. SYM 2206 dose-dependently increased the threshold for MEST-induced seizures, suggesting the anticonvulsant action of the compound in this seizure model in mice...|$|E
40|$|We {{discuss a}} {{triangulation}} algorithm {{that is based}} on repeatedly clipping ears of a polygon. The main focus of our work was on designing and engineering an algorithm that is (1) completely reliable, (2) easy to implement, and (3) fast in practice. The algorithm was implemented in ANSI C, based on floating-point arithmetic. Due to a series of heuristics that get applied as a back-up for the standard <b>ear-clipping</b> process if the code detects deficiencies in the input polygon, our triangulation code can handle any type of polygonal input data, be it simple or not. Based on our implementation we report on different strategies (geometric hashing, bounding-volume trees) for speeding up the <b>ear-clipping</b> process in practice. The code has been tuned accordingly, and cpu-time statistics document that it tends to be faster than other popular triangulation codes. All engineering details that ensure the reliability and efficiency of the triangulation code are described in full detail. We also report experimental data on how different strategies for avoiding sliver triangles effect the cpu-time consumption of the algorithm. Our code, named FIST as an acronym for fast industrial-strength triangulation, forms the core of a package for triangulating the faces of 3 D polyhedra, and it has been successfully incorporated into several industrial graphics packages, including an implementation for Java 3 D by Sun Microsystems...|$|R

Data describing movement activity of researched species were collected using capture-mark-recapture (CMR) As expected the data differ - Greater mobility was found in A. sylvaticus, the M. glaerolus preffered to stay inside patches with larger vegetation cover. The raids into surrounding patches differed even in those two researched forest sites. In site "Samota" A. sylvaticus showed greater movement distance, however in "Hejtman" it were M. glaerolus expressing greater movement ability. Theirs movement were directed inside clover field. Both species of Samota site ventured into patches with dense plant cover, perhaps to minimise the risk of predation. The best method of marking proved to be the clipping the rodents ears with tags.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundCardiac {{dysfunction}} {{is one of}} {{the possible}} causes of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Therefore, it was the objective of this study to evaluate the cardiac and electrocardiographic parameters after seizures induced by maximal electroshock (MES) in Wistar rats. MethodsElectroshock seizures were induced in Wistar rats through a pair of <b>ear-clip</b> electrodes (10 mA at a frequency of 60 Hz applied for one second). In vivo electrocardiography (ECG) was performed in awake animals for analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) and cardiac rhythm. Ex vivo the Langendorff technique was used to analyze cardiac function and observe the incidence and severity of reperfusion arrhythmias. ResultsConvulsive seizures triggered by MES induced profound abnormalities in cardiac rhythm with serious electrocardiographic changes including ST-elevation, bundle branch block, atrioventricular nodal escape rhythm and premature ventricular contractions. ECG analysis demonstrated a consistent period of postictal bradyarrhythmia resulting in a transiently irregular cardiac rhythm with highly variable and prolonged QRS complexes and RR, PR, QT and QTc intervals. HRV evaluation revealed an increase in the high-frequency range of the power, suggesting an imbalance in the autonomic control of the heart with a postictal enhancement of parasympathetic tone. In addition, we observed in isolated heart a decrease in systolic tone and an increase in the coronary flow, heart rate and incidence/duration of ischemia–reperfusion arrhythmias. ConclusionThe present study supports a relationship betweem seizures, cardiac dysfunction and cardiac arrhythmias. This relationship may partially account for the occurrence of SUDEP...|$|E
40|$|Acute hypoxia exerts strong {{effects on}} the {{cardiovascular}} system. Heart-generated pulsatile cerebrospinal fluid motion is recognised as a key factor ensuring brain homeostasis. We aimed to assess changes in heart-generated coupling between blood pressure (BP) and subarachnoid space width (SAS) oscillations during hypoxic exposure. Twenty participants were subjected to a controlled decrease in oxygen saturation (SaO 2 = 80 %) for five minutes. BP and heart rate (HR) were measured using continuous finger-pulse photoplethysmography, oxyhaemoglobin saturation with an <b>ear-clip</b> sensor, end-tidal CO 2 with a gas analyser, and cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV), pulsatility and resistive indices with Doppler ultrasound. Changes in SAS were recorded with a recently-developed method called near-infrared transillumination/backscattering sounding. Wavelet transform {{analysis was used to}} assess the relationship between BP and SAS oscillations. Gradual increases in systolic, diastolic BP and HR were observed immediately after the initiation of hypoxic challenge (at fifth minute + 20. 1 %, + 10. 2 %, + 16. 5 % vs. baseline, respectively; all P< 0. 01), whereas SAS remained intact (P = NS). Concurrently, the CBFV was stable throughout the procedure, with the only increase observed in the last two minutes of deoxygenation (at the fifth minute + 6. 8 % vs. baseline, P< 0. 05). The cardiac contribution to the relationship between BP and SAS oscillations diminished immediately after exposure to hypoxia (at the fifth minute, right hemisphere - 27. 7 % and left hemisphere - 26. 3 % vs. baseline; both P< 0. 05). Wavelet phase coherence did not change throughout the experiment (P = NS). Cerebral haemodynamics seem to be relatively stable during short exposure to normobaric hypoxia. Hypoxia attenuates heart-generated BP SAS coupling...|$|E
40|$|Cochlear {{implantation}} {{is becoming}} a routine rehabili tation process for profoundly deaf adults and children. Often children are implanted at just {{two or three years}} of age and therefore the subsequent tuning of the device is challenging. Although some children demonstrate quick and reliable responses to electrical stimulation, there are others who do not respond consistently thus causing concern about the functioning of the device. It is therefore desirable to have an objective test of the integrity of the implanted electrodes. The principle of the integrity test is the measurement of voltages generated by the biphasic current pulses at the electrode array; this is accomplished using surface electrodes placed around the implanted ear, in conjunction with recording and averaging equipment typically used for evoked response testing. Traditional integrity testing usually requires a general anaesthetic in young children, however this study demonstrated a simple, quick and reliable method of obtaining results in the normally active child using <b>ear-clip</b> electrodes. Results are presented from 12 children tested in this way, and compared with results from 20 children who were tested in theatre using a different electrode configuration. The tests were performed in common ground stimulation mode, but some measurements were also made in bipolar + 1 and pseudo-monopolar modes. The three stimulation modes were compared, with the conclusion that common ground mode provides an efficient check of implant function in the awake child, while pseudo-monopolar mode may be preferable for anaesthetized patients. In addition, measurements were made in vitro using a functioning cochlear implant in a saline tank in order to investigate the current flow during stimulation, The standard procedure in this department is to perform a full intra-operative integrity test on all implanted children. The simplified technique is used to repeat the measurements post-operatively if required...|$|E
40|$|Repeated electroconvulsive shock is an {{effective}} treatment for affective disorders. Striatum, hippocampus and brainstem are involved in affective disorders. Sodium-potassium/ATPase {{is of paramount importance}} for the proper functioning of the brain and its involvement in the affective disorders has been claimed for a long time. Sodium-potassium/ATPase has an extracellular regulatory binding site to which cardiotonic glycosides, such as ouabain, bind to, thus regulating the activity of the enzyme. Endogenous ouabain-like substances exist in the brain and their actions on the sodium-potassium/ATPase resemble ouabain biological properties. the aim of this work was to determine if electroconvulsive shock (ECS) would induce changes in the high-affinity binding of ouabain to the sodium-potassium/ATPase from rat brain regions. Adult, male Wistar rats received one (ECSx 1 group) or seven electroshocks (ECSx 7 group) delivered daily through <b>ear-clips</b> electrodes. Control rats received the same manipulations; however, no current was delivered through the electrodes (SHAMx 1 and SHAMx 7 groups). All groups were sacrificed 24 h after the last ECS session. the B-max and K-D of high-affinity [3 H]-ouabain binding were determined in crude membrane preparations from the striatum, hippocampus and brainstem. the results obtained showed a statistically significant increase in the affinity of [H- 3]-ouabain (lower K (D)) to striatal membranes in those rats receiving seven ECS. in the striatum there was no change in the K (D) after one ECS; as well as there was no change in the B-max after a single or seven ECS. High-affinity [H- 3]-ouabain binding to hippocampus and brainstem did not reveal any significant differences either in K (D) or B-max after one or seven ECS. the increased affinity of ouabain to the striatal sodium-potassium/ATPase induced by repeated ECS suggests an increased interaction in vivo of the endogenous ouabain-like substances with the enzyme and the involvement of the extracellular regulatory allosteric ouabain binding site in the striatal sodium-potassium/ATPase in the effects of electroconvulsive shock.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigated}} a pulse oximetry-based method for mobile devices. This method obtains bio-signals related to blood pulsation in transparent parts of body. The {{most widely accepted}} field for use of this method is hospital care. In these cases a pulse oximeter is the best solution for the monitoring of emergency patients. A promising field for pulse oximetry is physical exercise. It only requires simple clips such as <b>ear-clips,</b> finger-clips, headbands etc. However this method presents some difficulties: weak signal, noise ratio, motion artefacts, low perfusion. We used a MAX 30100 Oximeter and Heart Rate Sensor integrated circuit to obtain signals of blood pulse waves from red and infrared light emission diodes (LED). This device measures the oxygen saturation of a person’s blood by placing an LED and a photodetector against the thin skin of a person’s body, such as a fingertip, wrist or earlobe. The MAX 30100 is a 14 -pin surface mount integrated circuit that contains sensors for measuring a person’s heart rate. It can also indirectly determine the oxygen saturation of a person’s blood. The MAX 30100 provides a complete pulse oximetry and heart rate measurement solution for medical monitors and wearable fitness devices. As each LED emits light into a person’s finger, the integrated photodetector measures variations in light caused by changes in blood volume. An integrated 16 -bit {{analog to digital converter}} (ADC) with programmable sample rate converts the photodetector output to a digital value. The MAX 30100 filters out ambient light that can interfere with an accurate reading. Data are read through a serial I 2 C interface to computer for further processing. The LED current can be programmed from 0 to 50 mA with proper supply voltage. The LED pulse width can be programmed from 200 µs to 1. 6 ms to optimize measurement accuracy and power consumption based on use cases. The SpO 2 algorithm is relatively insensitive to the wavelength of the infrared LED, but the red LED’s wavelength is critical to correct interpretation of the data. The temperature sensor data can be used to compensate errors with ambient temperature changes. During the experiments we registered oxygen concentration values under different conditions. With low muscular activity we observed high stability and repeatability of measuring values under various exterior conditions. However, with high muscular activity there were various artefacts in the gauged signals that led to contortion of effects. We identified the boundaries of the validity of measuring and propose the use of an adapted filter in order to distinguish pulse waves from optical signals more reliably. These devices can be applied in fitness training, medical monitoring and used as wearable devices...|$|R
40|$|Respiration {{is known}} to affect {{cerebrospinal}} fluid (CSF) movement. We hypothesised that increased inspiratory resistance would affect the dynamic relationship between blood pressure (BP) changes and subarachnoid space width (SAS) oscillations. Experiments were performed {{in a group of}} 20 healthy volunteers undergoing controlled intermittent Mueller Manoeuvres (the key characteristic of the procedure is that a studied person is subjected to a controlled, increased inspiratory resistance which results in marked potentiation of the intrathoracic negative pressure). BP and heart rate (HR) were measured using continuous finger-pulse photoplethysmography; oxyhaemoglobin saturation with an <b>ear-clip</b> sensor; end-tidal CO 2 with a gas analyser; cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV), pulsatility and resistive indices with Doppler ultrasound. Changes in SAS were recorded with a new method i. e. near-infrared transillumination/backscattering sounding. Wavelet transform analysis was used to assess the BP and SAS oscillations coupling. Initiating Mueller manoeuvres evoked cardiac SAS component decline (- 17. 8 %, P< 0. 001), systolic BP, diastolic BP and HR increase (+ 6. 3 %, P< 0. 001; 6. 7 %, P< 0. 001 and + 2. 3 %, P< 0. 05, respectively). By the end of Mueller manoeuvres, cardiac SAS component and HR did not change (+ 2. 3 % and 0. 0 %, respectively; both not statistically significant), but systolic and diastolic BP was elevated (+ 12. 6 % and + 8. 9 %, respectively; both P< 0. 001). With reference to baseline values there was an evident decrease in wavelet coherence between BP and SAS oscillations at cardiac frequency {{in the first half of}} the Mueller manoeuvres (- 32. 3 %, P< 0. 05 for left hemisphere and - 46. 0 %, P< 0. 01 for right hemisphere) which was followed by subsequent normalization at end of the procedure (+ 3. 1 % for left hemisphere and + 23. 1 % for right hemisphere; both not statistically significant). Increased inspiratory resistance is associated with swings in the cardiac contribution to the dynamic relationship between BP and SAS oscillations. Impaired cardiac performance reported in Mueller manoeuvres may influence the pattern of cerebrospinal fluid pulsatility...|$|E
40|$|Introduction The ocular surface {{provides}} {{a unique opportunity}} to study hemodynamics since the vessels can be visualized directly, without treatment and non-invasively. The availability of instruments to measure various hemodynamic parameters on the ocular surface in an objective manner are lacking. The quantification of red blood cell velocity, blood oxygen saturation and conjunctival redness on the ocular surface using novel, validated techniques has the potential of providing useful information about vascular physiology. The specific aims of each chapter are as follows: Chapter 3 : The objective was to design, develop and validate a system that would non-invasively quantify the red blood cell velocity in the conjunctival vessels. A tool was developed to automatically analyze video sequences of conjunctival vessels, digitally imaged with high enough magnification to resolve movement of the blood within the vessel. Chapter 4 : The objective was to: a) design and develop a method in order to non-invasively quantify the changes in blood oxygen saturation (SO 2) in the conjunctival vessels and demonstrate reliability of the measures and, b) demonstrate the application of the method by showing a response to an isocapnic hyperoxic provocation and compare those values to the results from a valid instrument. Chapter 5 : The aim of this experiment was to examine variations in ocular redness levels, red blood cell velocities and oxygen saturation levels over time in clinically healthy participants and also to compare differences between two age groups. Chapter 6 : The aim of this experiment was to examine the ocular redness levels, red blood cell velocities and oxygen saturation levels in clinically healthy participants when a topical ophthalmic decongestant was instilled onto the eye and to demonstrate the validity of the use of two novel techniques. Chapter 7 : The aim of this experiment was to examine ocular redness, red blood cell velocity and oxygen saturation in participants who were habitual soft contact lens wearers (study) compared to those that did not (control) and also to compare differences in silicone (SH) and non-silicone hydrogel wearers. Methods Chapter 3 : Simulations representing moving RBCs within a vessel and the random variation of each cell in terms of speed, shape and intensity were created in order to evaluate the performance of the algorithm. For each vessel, a signal that correlated to blood cell position was extracted from each frame, and the inter-frame displacement was estimated through a modified dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm. This provided the red blood cell velocity over time in each point of the vessels. Thus, from these estimates, the mean red blood cell velocity for each vessel was easily evaluated. The true mean velocity from the simulation with the one estimated by the algorithm was compared and the system accuracy was determined. Chapter 4 : a) Conjunctival vessels were imaged with two narrow-band interference filters with O 2 -sensitive and O 2 -insensitive peak transmissions using a Zeiss slit lamp at 32 x magnification. Optical densities were calculated from vascular segments using the average reflected intensities inside and outside the vessels. Optical density ratios were used to calculate relative oxygen saturation values. Video images of the bulbar conjunctiva were recorded at three times of the day. Measurement repeatability was assessed over location at each time and across consecutive frames. b) Subjects initially breathed air for 10 minutes followed by pure oxygen (O 2) for 20 minutes, and then air for a final 10 minute period using a sequential re-breathing circuit. Simultaneously, SO 2 values measured with a pulse oximeter ear clip and finger clip were recorded. The validity of the dual wavelength method was demonstrated by comparing the values to those from the ear clip pulse oximeter. Chapter 5 : Participants attended eight separate visits {{over the course of a}} day. Levels of bulbar conjunctival redness, red blood cell velocity and blood oxygen saturation were measured on a vessel of interest. Chapter 6 : Participants attended three separate visits during an allotted 60 minute session. Bulbar conjunctival redness, red blood cell velocity and blood oxygen saturation were measured on a vessel of interest, pre-insertion, just after insertion and, 10 minutes after insertion of a topical ocular decongestant. Significant differences between the three measures were assessed and correlations between the three parameters were reported. Chapter 7 : Participants were measured 8 times over the course of a day with their contact lenses in place. Bulbar conjunctival redness, red blood cell velocity and blood oxygen saturation were measured. Results Chapter 3 : Results for the simulated videos demonstrated a very good concordance between the estimated and actual velocities supporting its validity. The mean relative error for the modified Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) method is 6 %. Chapter 4 : The intraclass correlations (ICCs) between the three locations at each time point were 0. 93, 0. 56 and 0. 86 respectively. Measurements across 5 consecutive frames showed no significant difference for all subjects (ICC = 0. 96). The ICCs between the two methods at each time point were 0. 45, 0. 10 and 0. 11 respectively. a) There was no significant difference in SO 2 between the three locations measured using the dual wavelength method for all subjects. There was also no significant difference between the three locations at any of the time points for the dual wavelength method. b) In response to isocapnic hyperoxic provocation using the dual wavelength method, blood oxygen saturation was increased from control values and subsequently recovered after withdrawal of hyperoxia. Blood oxygen saturation values recorded from the ear clip and finger clip of the pulse oximeter also showed an increase from control values and subsequently recovered after withdrawal of hyperoxia. SO 2 comparison between the dual wavelength method and the <b>ear-clip</b> pulse oximeter method did not show a significant difference. The interaction between the two methods and time on SO 2 was not significant. Chapter 5 : From baseline, the group mean redness and oxygen saturation did not change significantly over time. There was a significant difference in the group mean red blood cell velocity values over time. There was no significant difference between age strata for all three measures. Chapter 6 : After drop instillation redness values decreased significantly. There was no change in red blood cell velocity and oxygen saturation over time. There was a moderate significant correlation between SO 2 and red blood cell velocity just after drop insertion. Chapter 7 : When comparing the study and control groups, no significant difference in redness or SO 2 over time was found. RBC velocity over time was found to be significantly different between groups. When comparing the two study groups (SH vs. hydrogel) no significant difference across either measure over time was found. Conclusions Chapter 3 : Signal displacement estimation through the DTW algorithm can be used to estimate mean red blood cell velocity. Successful application of the algorithm in the estimation of RBC velocity in conjunctival vessels was demonstrated. Chapter 4 : The application of the dual wavelength method was demonstrated and optical density ratios can be used in a reliable manner for relative oxygen saturation measurements. This valid method promises to enable the study of conjunctival O 2 saturation under various experimental and physiological conditions. Chapter 5 : The results of this study support the theory of metabolic regulation. The lack of any significant change across time for redness and oxygen saturation along with significant changes in red blood cell velocity substantiates this notion. Chapter 6 : This study supports the literature regarding metabolic regulation of the microvasculature during the use of various stimuli. The results demonstrated that oxygen saturation levels remain stable even when a significant decrease in ocular redness is measured. The novel techniques used in this experiment demonstrated the expected action of the decongestant further contributing to their application and validity. Chapter 7 : In summary, the participants in the study group were habitual contact lens wearers that had lower RBC velocities when compared to the control group supporting the notion that contact lenses initiate a hypoxic response. The lack of change in SO 2 in either group supports the theory of metabolic regulation...|$|E
