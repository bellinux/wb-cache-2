40|$|Aims: Home glucose {{testing and}} {{reflection}} on patterns are {{important elements of}} type 1 diabetes self-management. We hypothesised that patients who demonstrated evidence of self-testing by bringing a <b>record</b> <b>book</b> (capillary blood glucose monitoring diary) to clinic would have better glycaemic control than patients with a glucometer alone, or neither <b>record</b> <b>book</b> nor glucometer. Methods: This was a prospective observational study of 233 consecutive type 1 diabetes patients using basal-bolus insulin. Exclusion criteria were diagnosis of type 1 diabetes within the previous year, current pregnancy, or prior inclusion in this study. We recorded {{the presence or absence}} of a <b>record</b> <b>book</b> or glucometer at the clinic, glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1 c), and previous structured education attendance. Results: Of 233 patients, 90 brought a <b>record</b> <b>book,</b> 61 brought a glucometer and 82 brought neither. Mean HbA 1 c did not differ between patients with a <b>record</b> <b>book</b> (63 ± 2 mmol/mol [7. 9 ± 0. 2 %]) or glucometer (63 ± 2 mmol/mol [7. 9 ± 0. 2 %]), but was higher in those with neither (77 ± 2 mmol/mol [9. 2 ± 0. 2 %]; p< 0. 001). Patients bringing a <b>record</b> <b>book</b> were older on average than those with a glucometer or neither (49. 6 ± 1. 7 vs. 41. 2 ± 1. 7 vs. 40. 6 ± 1. 4 years; p< 0. 001) and had longer mean duration of diabetes (27. 9 ± 2. 0 vs. 19. 2 ± 1. 7 vs. 18. 7 ± 1. 6 years; p< 0. 001). Prior structured education did not predict the presence of a <b>record</b> <b>book</b> or glucometer in the clinic. Conclusions: Evidence of self-testing at clinic review, either as a <b>record</b> <b>book</b> or glucometer, was associated with improved control compared with those with neither. HbA 1 c did not differ between patients bringing a <b>record</b> <b>book</b> or glucometer. Self-reflection on glucose results is important for type 1 diabetes self-management, irrespective of the recording method used...|$|R

50|$|The {{emergence}} of the Central Archives of the Old <b>Record</b> <b>Books</b> in Vilnius marks a totally new period {{in the history of}} Lithuanian archives. Vilnius Central Archives of the Old <b>Record</b> <b>Books</b> (later on referred to as the Archives) were established on 2 April 1852 (O.S.) {{on the grounds of the}} imperial decree of Nicholas I, Emperor of Russia. The Tsar Administration was willing to store documents in one place, to safeguard them against forgery or destruction in order to meet the needs of state institutions as well as private persons, especially the nobility. In 1853, by choice of the authorities, the closed Vilnius University building was fitted to accommodate the Archives. The direct supervision of the Archives was assigned to the Educational Board of Vilnius District. However, the activities of the Archives were also under control of Vilnius military governor (Governor-General), i.e. the actual governor of the state. According to the above-mentioned decree of 1852, old <b>record</b> <b>books</b> dating back to ancient times and up to 1799 were to be transferred from various offices in Vilnius, Minsk, Grodno, and Kaunas governorates (guberniyas) to the Vilnius Central Archives of the Old <b>Record</b> <b>Books.</b> Essentially, the Archives were completed as late as 1862 - at that time, the old <b>record</b> <b>books</b> kept there totalled 17,388. They were mainly documents produced by various institutions of GDL. In fact, the accumulation of documents continued: in 1887, documents of the liquidated Lublin Old <b>Record</b> <b>Books</b> Archives were transferred to the Vilnius Archives; documents of the cancelled Vitebsk Central Archives of the Old <b>Record</b> <b>Books</b> were also transferred to the Vilnius Archives in 1903.|$|R
