2500|$|A {{review of}} the {{literature}} found that long-term use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, is associated with drug tolerance, drug dependence, rebound insomnia, and CNS related adverse effects. It recommended that benzodiazepine hypnotics are used at their lowest possible dose and {{for a short period of}} time. Non-pharmacological treatment options were found to yield sustained improvements in sleep quality. [...] A worsening of <b>insomnia</b> (<b>rebound</b> insomnia) compared to baseline may occur after discontinuation of triazolam, even following short-term single-nightly-dose therapy.|$|E
50|$|Withdrawal symptoms, {{including}} <b>rebound</b> <b>insomnia</b> and <b>rebound</b> anxiety, {{may occur}} after seven days' use of lorazepam.|$|R
40|$|This {{randomised}} controlled {{trial was}} conducted to compare zolpidem to an equivalent dose of temazepam with respect to subjective <b>rebound</b> <b>insomnia</b> after cessation of 4 weeks of treatment in chronic insomnia (zolpidem 10 mg, n= 79; temazepam 20 mg, n= 84). Both agents improved total sleep time (TST) as well as sleep onset latency (SOL) significantly during the 4 treatment weeks. Prevalence rates for <b>rebound</b> <b>insomnia,</b> defined as a worsening of TST or SOL of more than 40 % compared to baseline, were 27 % for TST and 53 % for SOL in the Zolpidem condition and 26 % and 58 %, respectively, in the temazepam condition. No {{significant differences were found}} between both agents with respect to <b>rebound</b> <b>insomnia,</b> nor with respect to their efficacy or safety. We conclude that in clinical practice zolpidem has no advantages over temazepam with respect to <b>rebound</b> <b>insomnia...</b>|$|R
50|$|Flunitrazepam as {{with other}} benzodiazepines can lead to drug {{dependence}} and benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. Discontinuation may result in the appearance of withdrawal symptoms when the drug is discontinued. Abrupt withdrawal {{may lead to a}} benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome characterised by seizures, psychosis, <b>insomnia,</b> and anxiety. <b>Rebound</b> <b>insomnia,</b> worse than baseline insomnia, typically occur after discontinuation of flunitrazepam even after short-term single nightly dose therapy.|$|R
25|$|Abuse of over-the counter or {{prescription}} sleep aids (sedative or depressant drugs) {{can produce}} <b>rebound</b> <b>insomnia.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Daytime reemergence and rebound {{withdrawal}} symptoms, {{sometimes called}} interdose withdrawal, may occur once dependence has set in. Reemergence is {{the return of}} symptoms for which the drug was initially prescribed, in contrast, rebound symptoms are a return of the symptoms for which the benzodiazepine was initially taken for, but at a more intense level than before. Withdrawal symptoms, on the other hand, may appear {{for the first time}} during dose reduction, and include insomnia, anxiety, distress, weight loss, panic, depression, derealization, and paranoia, and are more commonly associated with short-acting benzodiazepines discontinuation, like triazolam. [...] Daytime symptoms can occur after a few days to a few weeks of administration of nightly benzodiazepine use or z-drugs such as zopiclone; withdrawal-related <b>insomnia</b> <b>rebounds</b> worse than baseline even when benzodiazepines are used intermittently.|$|R
2500|$|While benzodiazepines induce sleep, {{they tend}} to reduce the quality of sleep by suppressing or disrupting REM sleep. After regular use, <b>rebound</b> <b>insomnia</b> may occur when discontinuing clonazepam.|$|R
50|$|Other {{drawbacks}} of hypnotics, including benzodiazepines, {{are possible}} tolerance to their effects, <b>rebound</b> <b>insomnia,</b> and reduced slow-wave sleep and a withdrawal period typified by <b>rebound</b> <b>insomnia</b> and {{a prolonged period}} of anxiety and agitation. The list of benzodiazepines approved {{for the treatment of}} insomnia is fairly similar among most countries, but which benzodiazepines are officially designated as first-line hypnotics prescribed for the treatment of insomnia can vary distinctly between countries. Longer-acting benzodiazepines such as nitrazepam and diazepam have residual effects that may persist into the next day and are, in general, not recommended.|$|R
50|$|Ramelteon has {{not been}} shown to produce {{dependence}} and has shown no potential for abuse, and the withdrawal and <b>rebound</b> <b>insomnia</b> that is typical with GABA modulators is not present in ramelteon.|$|R
5|$|Benzodiazepines can {{be useful}} for {{short-term}} treatment of insomnia. Their use beyond 2 to 4 weeks is not recommended due {{to the risk of}} dependence. It is preferred that benzodiazepines be taken intermittently and at the lowest effective dose. They improve sleep-related problems by shortening the time spent in bed before falling asleep, prolonging the sleep time, and, in general, reducing wakefulness. However, they worsen sleep quality by increasing light sleep and decreasing deep sleep. Other drawbacks of hypnotics, including benzodiazepines, are possible tolerance to their effects, <b>rebound</b> <b>insomnia,</b> and reduced slow-wave sleep and a withdrawal period typified by <b>rebound</b> <b>insomnia</b> and a prolonged period of anxiety and agitation.|$|R
40|$|A polysomnographic {{assessment}} in healthy normal sleepers of possible dose relations for <b>rebound</b> <b>insomnia</b> was conducted. As an additional measure of rebound the study included a direct test of sleep/wake tendency {{during the night}} of drug discontinuation. Twelve, healthy men (21 - 30 years) each received placebo, 0. 25 mg and 0. 50 mg triazolam for 6 consecutive nights followed by a discontinuation night and 14 nights of recovery at home. The three conditions were presented, double-blind, in a latin square design. On night 6 of drug administration both doses increased total sleep time compared to placebo, but 0. 50 mg did not improve sleep beyond 0. 25 mg. On drug discontinuation (night 7) wake time over the 8 h recording and sleep latency after an experimental awakening (02. 30 h) were increased with 0. 50 mg compared to placebo and 0. 25 mg. On these measures of rebound 0. 25 mg {{did not differ from}} placebo. Thus <b>rebound</b> <b>insomnia</b> occurred only at a dose (0. 50 mg) which produced no additional hypnotic efficacy in these normal sleepers. Whether tests of sleep/wake tendency make a useful measure of <b>rebound</b> <b>insomnia</b> needs further clarification...|$|R
25|$|The {{committee}} {{recommended that}} withdrawal from benzodiazepines be gradual, as abrupt withdrawal from {{high doses of}} benzodiazepines may cause confusion, toxic psychosis, convulsions, or a condition resembling delirium tremens. Abrupt withdrawal from lower doses may cause depression, nervousness, <b>rebound</b> <b>insomnia,</b> irritability, sweating, and diarrhea.|$|R
5|$|Short-acting {{compounds}} have {{a median}} half-life of 1–12 hours. They have few residual effects if taken before bedtime, <b>rebound</b> <b>insomnia</b> may occur upon discontinuation, {{and they might}} cause daytime withdrawal symptoms such as next day rebound anxiety with prolonged usage. Examples are brotizolam, midazolam, and triazolam.|$|R
25|$|Nitrazepam {{can cause}} dependence, addiction, and {{benzodiazepine}} withdrawal syndrome. Withdrawal from nitrazepam {{may lead to}} withdrawal symptoms which {{are similar to those}} seen with alcohol and barbiturates. Common withdrawal symptoms include anxiety, insomnia, concentration problems, and fatigue. Discontinuation of nitrazepam produced <b>rebound</b> <b>insomnia</b> after short-term single nightly dose therapy.|$|R
50|$|A {{meta-analysis}} of the randomised, controlled, clinical trials that compared benzodiazepines against nonbenzodiazepines such as zolpidem has shown few consistent differences between zolpidem and benzodiazepines {{in terms of}} sleep onset latency, total sleep duration, number of awakenings, quality of sleep, adverse events, tolerance, <b>rebound</b> <b>insomnia,</b> and daytime alertness.|$|R
5000|$|Nitrazepam {{can cause}} dependence, addiction, and {{benzodiazepine}} withdrawal syndrome.

Discontinuation of nitrazepam produced <b>rebound</b> <b>insomnia</b> after short-term single nightly dose therapy.|$|R
5|$|Intermediate-acting {{compounds}} have {{a median}} half-life of 12–40 hours. They {{may have some}} residual effects {{in the first half}} of the day if used as a hypnotic. <b>Rebound</b> <b>insomnia,</b> however, is more common upon discontinuation of intermediate-acting benzodiazepines than longer-acting benzodiazepines. Examples are alprazolam, estazolam, flunitrazepam, clonazepam, lormetazepam, lorazepam, nitrazepam, and temazepam.|$|R
25|$|A {{meta-analysis}} of randomised controlled clinical trials that compared benzodiazepines to zopiclone or other Z {{drugs such as}} zolpidem and zaleplon has found few clear and consistent differences between zopiclone and the benzodiazepines in sleep onset latency, total sleep duration, number of awakenings, quality of sleep, adverse events, tolerance, <b>rebound</b> <b>insomnia,</b> and daytime alertness.|$|R
25|$|More {{common side}} effects may include: Central nervous system depression, {{including}} somnolence, dizziness, depressed mood, fatigue, ataxia, headache, vertigo, impairment of memory, impairment of motor functions, hangover {{feeling in the}} morning, slurred speech, decreased physical performance, numbed emotions, reduced alertness, muscle weakness, double vision, and inattention have been reported. Unpleasant dreams and <b>rebound</b> <b>insomnia</b> have also been reported.|$|R
50|$|A {{meta-analysis}} of randomized, controlled clinical trials which compared benzodiazepines against zaleplon or other Z-drugs such as zolpidem, zopiclone, and eszopiclone has found few clear and consistent differences between zaleplon and the benzodiazepines {{in terms of}} sleep onset latency, total sleep duration, number of awakenings, quality of sleep, adverse events, tolerance, <b>rebound</b> <b>insomnia,</b> and daytime alertness.|$|R

Unpleasant dreams and <b>rebound</b> <b>insomnia</b> have also been reported.|$|R
40|$|Appearances of {{alpha waves}} in the sleep electrencephalogram {{indicate}} physiological, brief states of awakening that lie in between wakefulness and sleep. These microstates may also cause the loss in sleep quality experienced by individuals suffering from insomnia. To distinguish such pathological awakenings from physiological ones, differences in alpha-wave characteristics between transient awakening and wakefulness observed {{before the onset of}} sleep were studied. In polysomnographic datasets of sleep-healthy participants (n = 18) and patients with insomnia (n = 10), alpha waves were extracted from the relaxed, wake state before sleep onset, wake after sleep-onset periods and arousals of sleep. In these, alpha frequency and variability were determined as the median and standard deviation of inverse peak-to-peak intervals. Before sleep onset, patients with insomnia showed a decreased alpha variability compared with healthy participants (P < 0. 05). After sleep onset, both groups showed patterns of decreased alpha frequency that was lower for wake after sleep-onset periods of shorter duration. For patients with insomnia, alpha variability increased for short wake after sleep-onset periods. Major {{differences between the two groups}} were encountered during arousal. In particular, the alpha frequency in patients with <b>insomnia</b> <b>rebounded</b> to wake levels, while the frequency in healthy participants remained at the reduced level of short wake after sleep-onset periods. Reductions in alpha frequency during wake after sleep-onset periods may be related to the microstate between sleep and wakefulness that was described for such brief awakenings. Reduced alpha variability before sleep may indicate a dysfunction of the alpha generation mechanism in insomnia. Alpha characteristics may also prove valuable in the study of other sleep and attention disorders...|$|R
50|$|Fosazepam is of {{relatively}} low potency {{compared to other}} benzodiazepine derivatives, with a 100 mg dose of fosazepam equivalent to 10 mg of nitrazepam. 60 mg of fosazepam has also been estimated to be equivalent to about 5-10 mg of diazepam. Fosazepam has similar effects to nitrazepam, but with a shorter duration of action and less tendency to cause over sedation, motor-impairment, amnesia, <b>rebound</b> <b>insomnia,</b> and morning grogginess.|$|R
50|$|Abrupt or rapid {{discontinuation}} from etizolam, as with benzodiazepines, {{may result}} in {{the appearance of the}} benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, including <b>rebound</b> <b>insomnia.</b> Neuroleptic malignant syndrome, a rare event in benzodiazepine withdrawal, has been documented in a case of abrupt withdrawal from etizolam. This is particularly relevant given etizolam's short half life relative to benzodiazepines such as diazepam resulting in a more rapid drug level decrease in blood plasma levels.|$|R
50|$|<b>Rebound</b> <b>{{insomnia}}</b> is insomnia {{that occurs}} following discontinuation of sedative substances taken to relieve primary insomnia. Regular {{use of these}} substances can cause a person to become dependent on its effects in order to fall asleep. Therefore, when a person has stopped taking the medication and is 'rebounding' from its effects, {{he or she may}} experience insomnia as a symptom of withdrawal. Occasionally, this insomnia may be worse than the insomnia the drug was intended to treat.|$|R
25|$|Tolerance {{may occur}} to {{quazepam}} but {{more slowly than}} seen with other benzodiazepines such as triazolam. However, quazepam causes significantly less drug tolerance and less withdrawal symptoms including less <b>rebound</b> <b>insomnia</b> upon discontinuation compared to other benzodiazepines. Quazepam may cause less rebound effects than other type1 benzodiazepine receptor selective nonbenzodiazepine drugs due to its longer half-life. Short-acting hypnotics often cause next day rebound anxiety. Quazepam due to its pharmacological profile does not cause next day rebound withdrawal effects during treatment.|$|R
50|$|A review medical {{publication}} found {{long-term use}} of zolpidem {{is associated with}} drug tolerance, substance dependence, <b>rebound</b> <b>insomnia,</b> and CNS-related adverse effects. It was recommended that zolpidem be used for {{short periods of time}} using the lowest effective dose. Zolpidem 10 mg is effective in treating insomnia when used intermittently no fewer than three and no more than five pills per week for a period of 12 weeks. The 15-mg zolpidem dosage provided no clinical advantage over the 10-mg zolpidem dosage.|$|R
40|$|Psychotropic drugs {{appear to}} produce {{significant}} biochemical {{changes in the}} physiological system during their long term administration, that often become manifest only after their withdrawal. Various clinical states described are: <b>rebound</b> <b>insomnia</b> following discontinuation of benzodiazepines (Kale et al 1980) and mania after antidepressant withdrawal (Mirin et al 1981). Such a switch process may be result of shifts in the balance between intracellular production, synaptic reuptake and metabolic degradation of monoamines (Schildkrautt et al 1976).

50|$|In {{clinical}} studies, trimipramine {{has been}} found in doses of 50 to 200 mg/day to significantly increase sleep efficiency and total sleep time and to decrease waking time for up to 3 weeks in patients with insomnia. It also improved subjectively perceived sleep quality and well-being during daytime. Monitoring of patients upon discontinuation of trimipramine found that it did not cause <b>rebound</b> <b>insomnia</b> or worsening of sleep quality in subjective evaluations of sleep, although objective measurements found total sleep time below baseline in a subset of patients during trimipramine withdrawal.|$|R
50|$|It {{should be}} noted that the risks of tolerance, dependence, and {{withdrawal}} are very low when the drug is used for 2-4 weeks only and that lormetazepam is generally a safe and effective drug when used for no longer than 2-4 weeks. Some sleep disturbance in the form of <b>rebound</b> <b>insomnia</b> can, however, occur even after short-term usage of 7 days. Those with a history of addiction may be at increased risk of problems of tolerance and dependence especially those with a past history of dependency on sedative hypnotic drugs.|$|R
50|$|A {{review paper}} found that {{long-term}} use of flurazepam {{is associated with}} drug tolerance, drug dependence, <b>rebound</b> <b>insomnia</b> and CNS related adverse effects. Flurazepam is best used {{for a short time}} period and at the lowest possible dose to avoid complications associated with long-term use. Non-pharmacological treatment options however, were found to have sustained improvements in sleep quality. Flurazepam and other benzodiazepines such as fosazepam, and nitrazepam lost some of their effect after seven days administration in psychogeriatric patients. Flurazepam shares cross tolerance with barbiturates and barbiturates can easily be substituted by flurazepam in those who are habituated to barbiturate sedative hypnotics.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Despite the {{proliferation}} of safe, effective, and cost-effective behavioral treat-ments of insomnia, hypnotic medication remains the most common treatment of insom-nia by primary care providers. Such treatment inmany cases leads to a pattern of tolerance and dependence on sleep medication, as well as difficulty discontinuing treatment and subsequent <b>rebound</b> <b>insomnia.</b> Recent research suggests promise for behavioral interven-tions {{in the treatment of}} hypnotic dependent insomnia. In this article, the authors report on the treatment of a particularly challenging case: an older adult with a history of addic-tive behavior nowdependent onhypnotics. The authors demonstrate the best possible out-come: elimination of sleep medication combined with sleep improvement...|$|R
50|$|In {{clinical}} trials brotizolam 0.125 to 0.5 mg improved sleep in insomniacs similarly to nitrazepam 2.5 and 5 mg, flunitrazepam 2 mg and triazolam 0.25 mg, whilst brotizolam 0.5 mg {{was shown to}} be superior to flurazepam 30 mg, but inferior to temazepam 30 mg in some studies. Brotizolam at dosages below 0.5 mg at night usually produced minimal morning drowsiness; no residual impairment of psychomotor performance occurs following dosages within the recommended range of 0.125 to 0.25 mg. No serious side effects {{have been reported to}} date and the most frequently observed adverse experiences are drowsiness, headache and dizziness. Mild <b>rebound</b> <b>insomnia</b> may occur in some patients when treatment is stopped.|$|R
50|$|The main {{safety concern}} of benzodiazepines such as {{estazolam}} is a benzodiazepine dependence {{and the subsequent}} benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome which can occur upon discontinuation of the estazolam. A {{review of the literature}} found that long-term use of benzodiazepines such as estazolam is associated with drug tolerance, drug dependence, <b>rebound</b> <b>insomnia</b> and CNS related adverse effects. Estazolam should only be used short term and at the lowest effective dose to avoid complications related to long-term use. Non-pharmacological treatment options however, were found to have sustained improvements in sleep quality. The short-term benefits of benzodiazepines on sleep begin to reduce after a few days due to tolerance to the hypnotic effects of benzodiazepines in the elderly.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate long-term (24 -week) safety of eszopiclone in elderly and nonelderly Japanese patients with chronic insomnia. The secondary objectives were to evaluate short-term (4 -week) efficacy and to assess for <b>rebound</b> <b>insomnia</b> or dependence after long-term treatment. Methods Patients (n[*]=[*] 164 elderly; n[*]=[*] 161 nonelderly), with or without psychiatric comorbidities, were randomized to receive low-dose (1 [*]mg, elderly; 2 [*]mg, nonelderly) or high-dose (2 [*]mg, elderly; 3 [*]mg, nonelderly) eszopiclone. The safety evaluation included adverse events, vital signs, clinical laboratory parameters, and electrocardiogram. Efficacy was assessed using patient reports of sleep latency (SL), total sleep time (TST), wake time after sleep onset (WASO), number of awakenings (NA), quality of sleep, depth of sleep, daytime sleepiness, daytime ability to function, and the 36 -item Short Form (SF- 36) Health Survey. Results The rate of adverse events was 81. 5 % in the 1 -mg elderly group, 79. 5 % in the 2 -mg elderly group, 82. 1 % in the 2 -mg nonelderly group, and 87. 0 % in the 3 -mg nonelderly group. Dysgeusia was the most common adverse event and was dose-related. Of 12 serious adverse events, none were considered by the investigator to be related to study medication. No <b>rebound</b> <b>insomnia</b> was observed. Eszopiclone significantly improved SL, TST, WASO, NA, and daytime sleepiness and function from baseline to Week 4, irrespective of age and psychiatric comorbidity. Improvements were also observed in SF- 36 Mental Health Component scores in elderly and nonelderly patients with psychiatric comorbidities. Conclusions Irrespective of age, eszopiclone appeared safe as administered in this study for 24 [*]weeks. Eszopiclone improved sleep variables in insomnia patients with and without psychiatric disorders and health-related quality of life in those with psychiatric disorders.
