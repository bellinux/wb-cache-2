500|$|Scott {{was married}} to Kimberly Scott from 1993 to 2007. They had two daughters together, Taelor and Sydni. Scott lived in Avon, Connecticut. At {{the time of his}} death, Scott was in a {{relationship}} with Kristin Spodobalski. During his Jimmy V Award speech, he told his teenage daughters: [...] "Taelor and Sydni, I love you guys more than I {{will ever be able to}} express. You two are my heartbeat. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>standing</b> on this stage here tonight because of you." ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike his provocative written language, Wills {{spoke in}} a breezy and laconic manner. In one of his {{borderline}} [...] "thought disordered" [...] letters, {{it is evident that}} at times he entered a state of depersonalisation: [...] "I do not know what <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>standing</b> on ... when anyone speaks to me I cannot {{for the life of me}} make out what they are talking about—everything seems so curious." [...] In 1884, Hammersley compared Wills' incipient madness and fiery glare to that of Adam Lindsay Gordon, the Australian bush poet. Wills' mental instability is a source for speculation: epilepsy has been suggested as a possible cause of his perplexed mental state, and a variant of bipolar illness may account for his disjointed thinking and flowery, confused writings.|$|E
500|$|Aguilera also {{supported}} Stripped by embarking {{on two different}} tours. In summer 2003, Justin Timberlake and Aguilera embarked on the Justified and Stripped Tour, {{which took place in}} North America. Talking about the tour, Timberlake revealed that [...] "She's got one of the most amazing voices I've ever heard. That homegirl can sing... this is why <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>standing</b> here". Several tour dates were cancelled and rescheduled due to the collapse of lightning systems. An extended play entitled Justin & Christina was released exclusively at Target Stores in July 2003 to promote the tour. The CD contains four remixes of Aguilera and Timberlake's songs from their two albums, and two new tracks. In late 2003, The Stripped Tour, the former's extension, happened without Timberlake's acts. The tour took place in Europe, Japan and Australia. The former grossed total US$30,261,670, becoming the sixteenth highest-grossing tour of 2003. In summer 2004, Aguilera was expected to return to North American during the second leg of the tour. However, the 29 tour dates were cancelled in the last minute due to the singer's vocal strain. On November 15, 2008, an accompanying video release of the tour, Stripped Live in the U.K., was released worldwide. On December 8, 2004, a compilation album which includes Stripped and the DVD was released in the United Kingdom.|$|E

2500|$|... "Three {{organizations}} {{are involved in}} trying to force me off land I legally own — Stephenville Town Council: Stephenville Chamber of Commerce: and Stephenville Lions Club. It was the Chamber of Commerce in 1957 that called for the setting up of a civic park at Long Gull Pond. It is a whisper campaign, to make people believe <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>standing</b> in the way of progress, that I am stubbornly refusing to sell my land thus robbing the people of the west coast their own born-right to boil the kettle on their chosen spot of summer scenery. This argument is full of holes. Firstly, I have stated publicly that a first rate section of my land including frontage along the beach of the pond has been reserved and placed solely at the disposal of all comers without cost. I have offered to make such an arrangement permanent by entering into a proper contract with the appropriate authority. This fact, plus the fact that land is still available elsewhere on the pond, shows that more than just a park is involved.|$|E
2500|$|Following the Labour Party's {{defeat at}} the general {{election}} on 7 May 2015, Ed Miliband resigned as its party leader, triggering a leadership election. On 2 June, it was reported in media sources that Corbyn was considering standing as a candidate, having been disillusioned {{by the lack of}} a left-wing voice. The next day, Corbyn confirmed to his local newspaper, The Islington Tribune, that he would stand in the election on a [...] "clear anti-austerity platform". He added: [...] "This decision is in response to an overwhelming call by Labour Party members who want to see a broader range of candidates and a thorough debate {{about the future of the}} party. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>standing</b> to give Labour Party members a voice in this debate". The other candidates were Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham and Shadow Care Minister Liz Kendall. Corbyn had the lowest number of nominations from fellow MPs of any Labour Party Leader, and several who nominated him later claimed to have cleared him to run more to widen the political debate within the party than because of a desire or expectation that he would win. Nonetheless, he rapidly became the frontrunner among the candidates.|$|E
2500|$|... "That it [...] can be forgiven, if {{not here}} then {{nevertheless}} in an eternity. Is there anything dubious about this forgiveness? Yes, there is – that I {{do not have}} her forgiveness; and she is and remains an intermediate court, a legitimate court, that must not be bypassed. Her forgiveness certainly cannot justify me eternally, {{no more than a}} person’s implacability can harm anyone but himself, but her forgiveness is a part of a divine procedure. Why, then, do you not have it? Because I could not make myself understandable to her. ... Suppose she had forgiven me. Then, of course, she would not have forgotten me. But can we see each other then? Suppose she stood beside someone else. When she stands that way within time, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>standing</b> in her path and therefore shall go away. But if I stood in her path in eternity, where should I go. Compared with eternity, is time the stronger? Has time the power to separate us eternally?" [...] Søren Kierkegaard, Stages on Life's Way (1845), Hong p. 380-382, 390-391What would indeed be as disconsolate, yes, {{almost to the point of}} despair, as this-if, at the moment when the misunderstanding one returned and sought understanding, when the unfriendly one returned and sought friendship, when the one who had hated returned and sought reconciliation-what would be as disconsolate as this: if the one who loves has then wasted away, so that neither understanding nor the restoration of friendship nor the renewal of reconciliation in love could really take place with the blessed joy of eternity! On the other hand, what can make [...] the moment of forgiveness, the transition of agreement so natural, so easy as this: that the one who loves by abiding, has continually cleared away the past. Works of Love, 1847 Hong 1995 p. 313-314"You must have God’s help to believe that you are saved by Baptism; you must have God’s help to believe that in the Lord’s Supper you receive the gracious forgiveness of your sins. Be it done for you as you believe. But everything in you that is flesh and blood and is timorousness and attachment to things of this earth must despair, so that you cannot acquire external certainty. If this like for like holds true even in relation to what most definitely must be called Gospel, how much more, then, when Christianity is itself the Law. “Forgive, then you will be forgiven" [...] Works of Love, Sep 29, 1847, Hong 378-380 ...|$|E
