Mast crane <b>integral</b> <b>installation</b> {{technology}} {{is one of}} the ten new technologies in the construction field, which are put forward by the ministry of construction and are in key application. It is widely applied in the field of construction engineering. However, at present, the design of the mast crane hoisting is generally based on traditional mechanical model and adopts manual calculation, which is lack of safety and reliability, and the model needs to be perfect. As a result, this paper studies the lattice mast crane hoisting system, explores and improves the traditional mechanical model, and develops the lattice mast hoisting aided design system (WGCAD 1. 0), {{in order to meet the}} design requirements. Main content includes: introduction to the development in engineering of the lattice mast hoisting crane and the application status in hoisting engineering of computer technology; introduction of the development environment of ViusalBasi 6. 0 and Access database which are used in cad system development of the lattice mast hoisting. By using the reasonable lattice mast lifting design mechanics model, from the lattice mast hoisting system designer's perspective, the software adopts Visual Basic 6. 0 development environment and Microsoft Access database as development tools, the design idea of engineering design are simulated...|$|E
50|$|Idea for {{the script}} {{appeared}} in 2004, inspired by Doctor Janos Sanockyâ€™s {{account of a}} case from his medical practice. The dialogue was co-written by the Lithuanian-Russian writer Andrey Levkin.Shooting of the film took place between September 15 and October 24, 2006 in Kyiv. Most of the film was shot through the mirrors, which caused serious difficulties for the director of photography, since there was a permanent challenge for the crew to avoid getting into the shot.Editing, effects, color correction and rendering of the film took 14 months. All post-production work except for rendering was done by Ihor Podolchak himself. Las Meninas was the first feature film in Ukraine created entirely with the Digital intermediate process.Most of the music in the film was written for cello and piano by composer Alexander Shchetynsky. Director and composer {{paid attention to the}} central role of music as a semantic counterpoint to the dialogue and visual imagery, so the sound level of the film can be viewed as an <b>integral</b> sound <b>installation.</b> American video clip director Dean Karr co-directed the music part of the film.|$|R
40|$|During {{end-of-life}} {{production from}} an oil well {{it is often}} impossible to sustain continuous production. Gas coning is a common cause of production problems, especially in thin oil reservoirs. This study compares three production strategies {{that can be used}} to deal with this problem for a specific field case. The strategies will be evaluated on the basis of two criteria: Total number of barrels produced and Net Present Value (NPV). The three strategies considered are (i) intermittent production, (ii) Well Head Control (WHC), (iii) Inflow Control Devices, (ICD). The first two are currently common practice, while the latter is an emerging technology which is not applied on a large scale yet, because of the larger expense incurred by ICD installation. The onset of gas breakthrough occurs in a much shorter timescale than many other production upsets, such as water flooding, making it a very challenging situation for a control strategy. A coupled dynamic reservoir-well model has been used in order to describe the breakthrough accurately. A simulation environment has been constructed and validated in which different well and reservoir models can be coupled. Since correct prediction of flow and pressure drop over ICDs is essential, special care was taken to accurately model these devices. For the WHC control strategies a Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) algorithm was used. Despite the higher initial completion costs associated with ICDs, they can provide a cost-effective way to reduce long-term operating costs and increase yield. Production targets are achieved with longer, but fewer wells, maintenance and overhead. From a reservoir management point of view, ICDs can improve the productivity index (PI) by maximizing reservoir contact, minimizing gas coning by operating at lower drawdown, and increasing overall efficiency. In this study we evaluate a field case, which suffers from gas coning, to verify whether the implementation and usage of ICDs are cost-effective alternatives, and quantify the relative merits for each technology. The comparison is based on both the total barrels produced and the NPV, taking into account the <b>integral</b> cost, including <b>installation,</b> operating, and maintenance costs...|$|R
