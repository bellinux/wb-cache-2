Results: The mean (SD) peak concentration of <b>dalbavancin</b> in plasma and blister fluid was 285 (31. 1) and 67. 3 (18. 2) mg/L, respectively; the corresponding AUCDay 7 values were 10 806 (1926) and 6438 (1238) mg. h/L, respectively.

Additionally, <b>dalbavancin</b> possesses unique pharmacokinetic properties, the most significant of which is a long terminal half-life that allows for once weekly dosing. This attribute may prove to yield clinical and cost benefit. Overall, clinical trials indicate that <b>dalbavancin</b> is a safe, well-tolerated, and effective antimicrobial agent. In the largest investigation evaluating <b>dalbavancin</b> for the treatment of cSSTIs, it appeared to be as effective as linezolid. <b>Dalbavancin,</b> which is expected to receive FDA approval in 2008, appears to be a promising new antimicrobial agent for the treatment of cSSTIs...|$|E
40|$|The {{immediate}} lack of market-dominating commercial products (Vitek or MicroScan) for susceptibility {{testing of}} the new glycolipopeptide, <b>dalbavancin,</b> requires a surrogate marker agent to assist microbiologists in the correct categorization of potentially indicated species (staphylococci and streptococci). Error-rate analyses for 16, 749 isolates using vancomycin or teicoplanin results to categorize <b>dalbavancin</b> susceptibilities demonstrated that both glycopeptide agents were highly predictive of dalbavancin-susceptible results (nearly 100 %) with only a rare minor error. Vancomycin test results most reliably predict <b>dalbavancin</b> susceptibility until validated commercial reagents become available for direct testing in clinical practice...|$|E
