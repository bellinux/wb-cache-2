The experiment consisted of placing a heated aluminum billet (to represent heat-generating nuclear material) inside curved- and flat-bottom canisters with and without <b>holding</b> <b>plate</b> fixtures and/or extended fin surfaces. Surface temperatures were measured at several locations on the aluminum billet, inner and outer canisters, and the <b>holding</b> <b>plate</b> fixture to assess the effectiveness of the various configurations in removing and distributing the heat from the aluminum billet. Results indicated that the curved-bottom canisters, with or without holding fixtures, were extremely ineffective in extracting heat from the aluminum billet. The larger thermal contact area provided by the flat-bottom canisters compared with the curved-bottom design, greatly enhanced the heat removal process and lowered the temperature of the aluminum billet considerably. The addition of the fixture plates to the flat-bottom canister geometry greatly enhances the heat removal rates and lowers the canister operating temperatures considerably. The addition of the fixture plates to the flat-bottom canister geometry greatly enhances the heat removal rates and lowers the canister operating temperatures considerably. Finally, the addition of extended fin surfaces to the outer flat-bottom canister positioned on a fixture plate, reduced the canister temperatures still further...|$|E

Flow within this image is from right to left, with the shock wave <b>holding</b> <b>plate</b> evident within the left-hand side of the image. As such, the present experimental arrangement and resulting flow structure are similar to the ones described by Ogawa and Babinsky [16]. Flow visualization data are captured at an acquisition rate of 10.0 [*]kHz during the test on 05 April 2018. A total of 21, 619 images are collected, as steady flow conditions are maintained during this test. The frequency resolution is 0.4625 [*]Hz. Each image size is 1024 [*]×[*] 512 pixels. To achieve the instantaneous result presented in Fig.  1, flow at the test section inlet must be uniform and steady, with relatively low freestream turbulence intensity, and no significant flow disturbances or non-uniformities. Note that a few oblique lines are evident within Fig. 1 on the right-hand side of the image, which are located just downstream of the test section inlet. These lines are due to the presence of Mach waves. According to Ogawa and Babinsky [16], “faint oblique lines represent Mach waves stemming from joints of parts or small disturbances on the tunnel walls, which have negligible effects on the flow.” Also evident in Fig. 1 are a few dark spots, which are due to imperfections on the outside surfaces of the side walls of the wind tunnel. These spots have no effect on the flow.|$|E

40|$|Automobiles {{have become}} an {{integral}} part of our daily life as more and more mopeds, motor cycles, cars, trucks, busses and trains are being used for transport. The main parts of an automotive engine are cylinder, piston assembly, connecting rod and crank shaft. The piston assembly consists of Piston, Piston rings and Piston Pin. Piston rings are important parts of a piston assembly. Any non-conformance in any quality characteristic of the piston ring leads to deterioration of engine performance. M/S Goetze (India) Limited a medium scale industry and a sister concern of engineering giant M/S Escorts Limited is manufacturing "GOETZE PISTON RINGS" and is producing about 800 varieties of piston rings ranging from 35. 00 mm to 228. 5 mm nominal diameter. The management was facing serious problem due to high scrap rate in certain types of their manufactured piston rings. Hence instead of trying to handle all of them at the same time, it seemed reasonable to tackle and find a suitable approach to solve the quality problem by taking the most notorious ring first, so that once the methodology is understood, documented and applied to the quality problem of this ring, the same can also be invoked for other rings to improve upon their quality, and thus reducing the scrap rate. One particular ring of 83. 0 mm diameter which is delicate and costly, having an average scrap rate of 36. 2 % in past three years is selected for the study. No systematic effort was made in the past to identify the quality characteristics and the processes which were responsible for this high scrap rate and thus no immediate measure could be recommended. As a matter of fact at the beginning of the study it was not even clear which quality characteristics were mainly responsible for such high rejection. So in July' 1999 a pareto analysis was done for the first time to identify the culpability of each quality characteristic for the rejection of the ring. From the Pareto analysis it was observed that maximum proportion of rejection was due to nonconformity in axial thickness. The scrap rate due to nonconformity in axial thickness were collected for each month from Jul’ 999 to Jan' 2000 which averaged at 8. 7 %. Since in every month the major malefactor for rejection was the nonconformity of axial thickness it was decided to first try to improve the quality of axial thickness, before trying to tackle other quality issues associated with this particular piston ring under study. Once the most problematic quality characteristic namely the axial thickness was identified, as a first step towards the goal of improving the quality of axial thickness, it was necessary to pay attention and isolate the manufacturing processes or operations affecting the axial thickness and study them in detail. So first, the entire manufacturing process flow diagram of the piston ring was studied. From the process flow diagram it appeared that there are 4 operations affecting axial thickness viz. Rough Grinding,Medium Grinding, First Lapping and Finish Lapping. So each of these processes was critically observed to assess whether they were under statistical control or not. Studies were conducted at each of these 4 operations by collecting samples using the rational subgroup method and control charts were plotted. From the control charts, it was observed that the Rough Grinding and Medium Grinding operations were in statistical control with acceptable Cp, Cpk values. But First Lapping and Finish Lapping operations were not in statistical control. Thus we finally identified the two critical processes namely the First Lapping and Finish Lapping operations which were not in statistical control but were crucially affecting the quality of axial thickness. Since the First and Finish Lapping operations were identified as the major source of the quality problem, an in-depth study was undertaken to analyze these two processes. A brain storming session was conducted with all concerned personnel from production, maintenance, design, quality assurance and tool room to get all possible causes which might be affecting the axial thickness variation at these two processes. During the brain storming session the team suggested that the First Lapping process can be processed in medium grinding machine (DFS machine) instead of Lapping machine. The reasons behind this were two fold. First since the aim of the First Lapping is just to remove excess material which was deposited during chrome plating, the same operation can be performed in DFS machine. Since the required surface finish on axial surface was any way being aimed at the Finish Lapping operation, a similar precursory First Lapping'operation in a Lapping machine was really felt not necessary. Secondly since the performance of the DFS machine was found to be under control, albeit for the grinding operation, it was hoped that the Lapping operation in the same machine would also exhibit a similar performance. For this purpose a study was conducted on the First Lapping operation with the DFS machine. It was found that the process was well within the control limit with decent Cp and Cpk values. Thus this procedure of performing the First Lapping operation in a DFS machine took care of the first one of the two problematic processes affecting the quality of axial thickness. Next for tackling the problem with the other critical process, viz. the Finish Lapping operation, various causes were suggested by the team for axial thickness variation in the Finish Lapping operation. Based on these causes, an Ishikawa diagram (cause and effect diagram) was prepared. This Ishikawa diagram had thrown light into number of possible deficiencies in Man, Machine, Method and Material which were responsible for axial thickness variation at finish Lapping. The Ishikawa diagram was carefully analyzed. The causes were narrowed down to 6 factors. These are Grinding wheel rotating speed, Grinding Time, Grinding pressure, <b>Holding</b> <b>plate,</b> Holes (fixtures) within the <b>holding</b> <b>plate</b> and Positions within a ring. The 3 factors namely grinding wheel speed, time and pressure were identified as the control factors. <b>Holding</b> <b>plate,</b> Hole position within a plate and Checking position within a ring on the other hand were the noise factors whose different levels might exhibit a variability of axial thickness. Since there were only 3 control factors, it was decided to conduct a full factorial experiment with each control factor at 3 levels. Hence altogether there were 27 experiments at a fixed given combination of speed, time and pressure. There were 4 holding plates with each plate having 6 slotted holes leading to machining 24 rings at a time during the finish lapping operation. Next 3 measurements were taken for each one of these 24 rings. Thus altogether there were 72 observations for one of these experiments. Each experiment was replicated twice by taking measurements for 2 consecutive batches of rings. From the analysis of variance of the results of these experiments for both S/N ratio and mean it was observed that all the three main factors and their interactions were significant. The Normality assumption of standardized residuals for the S/N ratio and mean was validated by normal probability plot and Kolmonogorov-Smirnoff test. The homoscedasticity assumption was validated through Bartlett’s test and residual plots. It was found that the experiment no. 23 (Speed 84 RPM, Time 10 sees and Pressure 300 daN) yielded highest S/N ratio (η) with mean within the specification limit. That the mean and S/N ratio for the experiment no. 23 were significantly different from others was established by means of Tukey's multiple comparison test. Next control charts for experiment no. 23 were plotted and was found to be well within control with acceptable Cp and Cpk values. Hence we concluded that the non-conformance in axial thickness can be substantially reduced by using the following optimal setting of factors i. e. grinding speed with 84 RPM, grinding pressure with 300 daN and grinding time with 10 seconds. Using this optimal setting the earlier average rejection rate of 8. 7 % due to non-conformance in axial thickness was reduced to 0. 05 %. Under this optimal setting, the process capability index (Cpk) of finish Lapping operation was estimated to be 2. 5, which is well above acceptable standard. Due to this reduction in rejection rate in one quality characteristics of one particular ring out of 800 types, the net savings to the organization is approximately Rs. 10, 44, 000 per year...|$|E
40|$|This study {{applies the}} RFID and {{information}} transmission equipment for establishing {{a set of}} goods supply and assortment system, together with introducing the existing purchase, sales and inventory system in the auction market. The supplier delivers potted plants to the collecting station (or self-delivery to the flower auction market) together with assortment; the purchase statement is then handed to the operator for entering data into the “Original Supply System”. The system will send the purchase data to the designated flower auction market via internet and, at the same time, the Original Supply System will print out RFID Tags, which contain the flower purchase data, via the RFID barcode printer. The operating personnel will then stick the RFID Tags (the tags' surface contains Code 128 barcode) to the <b>holding</b> <b>plate</b> and the truck will deliver the flowers to the auction market. After off-loading, the assorting personnel in the auction market will retrieve the data in the RFID Tags via a palm RFID Reader with non-touch sensor. The data is then transmitted into the “Server of market-end assortment system” via the wireless access point (AP) and compared with the flower purchase data uploaded by the original supplier. Through this system, accuracy of the supplier's flower delivery can be effectively ascertained; such method can speed up the purchase and assortment operation in the flower auction market, as well as improve the accuracy of supply data. This will effectively increase the economic benefits of the flower auction market, and improve problems such as delayed operation rising from long collection time and late delivery of suppliers of the auction market. 本研究應用RFID與資訊傳輸設備建立一套供貨、理貨系統，並導入拍賣市場既有的進、銷、存系統。供應人將盆花送至集貨站（亦可自行運送至花卉拍賣市場），並同時做好理貨工作，將進貨明細表資料交由作業人員輸入『產地供貨系統』中，此系統將進貨資料藉由網際網路傳送至指定花卉拍賣市場，同時間產地供貨系統透過RFID標籤編碼/列印機輸出具有花卉進貨資料之RFID Tag，作業人員並將此標籤（標籤表面含印製Code 128 條碼）黏貼至端盤，再由貨車將花卉運送至拍賣市場；在卸貨後，市場理貨人員透過掌上型資料收集器（RFID Reader），以非接觸式感應RFID Tag內資訊，並藉由無線基地台（AP）傳輸至『市場端理貨系統伺服器』內，與由產地上傳之花卉進貨資料進行比對，藉此能有效獲知供應人是否有誤送進貨花卉之情況，此種方式，可加速花卉拍賣市場進貨、理貨作業速度及提高供貨資料正確性。透過此系統之建置，可大幅縮減拍賣市場的進貨、理貨作業時間、減少作業錯誤以及加速作業流程；將有效提高花卉拍賣市場之經濟效益、改善拍賣市場集貨作業時間冗長與供應人遲到貨車所造成理貨作業延誤等問題。摘要I AbstractII 目錄III 圖目錄VIII 表目錄XIV 第一章 緒論 1 1. 1 研究背景 1 1. 2 研究動機 2 1. 3 研究目的 3 第二章 文獻探討 7 2. 1 台灣花卉產業之簡介 7 2. 1. 1 台灣盆花之生產分佈與產值 7 2. 1. 2 花卉供應鏈與花卉拍賣市場的關係 10 2. 1. 3 台灣花卉批發市場作業流程之介紹 13 2. 2 網際網路之概述 23 2. 2. 1 網際網路起源歷史 23 2. 2. 2 網路通訊協定 24 2. 2. 2. 1 開放系統互連 24 2. 2. 2. 2 OSI Model與TCP/IP規約的關係 26 2. 2. 2. 3 TCP/IP通訊協定 27 2. 2. 2. 4 NetBEUI協定 29 2. 2. 2. 5 IPX/SPX協定 29 2. 2. 3 Socket介紹 29 2. 2. 4 IP概述 30 2. 3 無線網路之介紹 33 2. 3. 1 無線網路概述 33 2. 3. 2 IEEE 802. 11 b無線網路簡介 35 2. 3. 3 IEEE 802. 11 無線網路架構 36 2. 4 條碼之概述 39 2. 4. 1 條碼歷史背景 39 2. 4. 2 條碼識別原理 39 2. 4. 3 一維條碼 41 2. 4. 4 二維條碼 51 2. 5 RFID的介紹 55 2. 5. 1 解釋RFID 55 2. 5. 2 RFID系統架構 56 2. 5. 3 RFID系統應用實例 62 2. 5. 4 RFID系統與個人數位助理(PDA) 之整合應用 63 2. 5. 5 條碼與RFID之比較 64 第三章 系統相關技術簡介 66 3. 1 系統相關技術 66 3. 1. 1 串列通訊 66 3. 1. 2 Web Services技術 69 3. 1. 3 資料庫 69 3. 1. 3. 1 資料庫存取方式 70 3. 1. 3. 2 MySQL資料庫 72 3. 2 設備通訊介面 72 3. 2. 1 字元集 72 3. 2. 2 RS 232 通訊參數 73 3. 3 無線掌上型資料收集器之程式作業架構 74 3. 3. 1 Client端 74 3. 3. 2 Server端 76 3. 4 Socket通訊程式建立 77 3. 4. 1 伺服器端程式 77 3. 4. 2 用戶端程式 78 第四章 實驗設備、方法與系統操作說明 79 4. 1 實驗設備 79 4. 1. 1 硬體部分 79 4. 1. 2 軟體部分 83 4. 2 研究流程 86 4. 3 實驗方法 89 4. 3. 1 產地供貨系統 89 4. 3. 2 市場端理貨系統 90 4. 3. 3 整體系統作業說明 92 4. 3. 4 具RFID Tag之條碼標籤欄位說明 96 4. 3. 5 資訊安全建置內容及方法 98 4. 3. 6 市場端導入RFID前後理貨作業所需時間及成本 99 4. 3. 7 身分辨識 100 4. 4 系統操作說明 100 4. 4. 1 產地供應系統操作說明 101 4. 4. 2 花市端理貨系統之使用及安裝說明 109 第五章 結果與討論 115 5. 1 產地端供貨系統 115 5. 2 花市端理貨系統 119 5. 3 RFID系統導入花市端進、銷、存系統之效益 125 5. 4 RFID系統導入花市端後之成本計算 130 5. 5 RFID 掌上型資料收集器之身分辨識性能測試 133 第六章 結論與建議 135 6. 1 結論 135 6. 2 建議 137 參考文獻 139 附錄A：EAN國際條碼會員國 145 附錄B：宜蘭忠順花卉園藝現行使用之花卉代碼 146 附錄C：台灣盆花品名代碼 147 附錄D：專業與非專業理貨員之人工登錄 80 筆資料準確性紀錄 155 附錄E： 2007 年高雄花市之進貨量、交易量、交易金額 15...|$|E
