25|$|When {{international}} {{measure was}} introduced in the English-speaking countries, the basic <b>geodetic</b> <b>datum</b> in North America was the North American Datum of 1927 (NAD27), which had been constructed by triangulation based on the definition of the foot in the Mendenhall Order of 1893, that is 1foot= meters: this definition was retained for data derived from NAD27, but renamed the US survey foot to distinguish it from the international foot. For most applications, {{the difference between the two}} definitions is insignificant– one international foot is exactly 0.999998 of a US survey foot, for a difference of about inch (3mm) per mile– but it affects the definition of the State Plane Coordinate Systems (SPCSs), which can stretch over hundreds of miles.|$|E

40|$|Dynamical orbital {{techniques}} {{were employed to}} estimate the center-of-mass station coordinates of six C-band radars located in the designated primary GEOS-C radar altimeter calibration area. This work was performed {{in support of the}} planned GEOS-C mission (December, 1974 launch). The sites included Bermuda, Grand Turk, Antigua, Wallops Island (Virginia), and Merritt Island (Florida). Two sites were estimated independently at Wallops Island yielding better than 40 cm relative height recovery, with better than 10 cm and 1 m (relative) recovery for phi and gamma respectively. Error analysis and comparisons with other investigators indicate that better than 2 m relative recovery was achieved at all sites. The data used were exclusively that from the estimated sites and included 18 orbital arcs which were less than two orbital revolutions in length, having successive tracks over the area. The techniques employed here, given their independence of global tracking support, can be effectively employed to improve various <b>geodetic</b> <b>datums</b> by providing very long and accurate baselines. The C-band data taken on GEOS-C should be employed to improve such <b>geodetic</b> <b>datums</b> as the European- 1950 using similar techniques...|$|R

40|$|Copyright © by the paper's authors. Dynamic datums, {{which account}} for crustal dynamics, are widely used in Australia and New Zealand, {{although}} in many cases users {{may not be aware}} that they are using such a datum. The most widely-used global dynamic datums in Australia and New Zealand are the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF) and the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84). The use of WGS 84 presents particular challenges, as it cannot be directly accessed at the sub-metre level by most spatial professionals. The relationship between WGS 84 and ITRF is explored in detail, leading to recommendations on how users should deal with WGS 84 datasets. New Zealand and Australia have taken different approaches to modelling the relationship between global dynamic datums and their local <b>geodetic</b> <b>datums.</b> Australia has calculated a set of local transformation parameters, which incorporate tectonic movements. New Zealand has adopted a set of global parameters, and uses a deformation model to account for crustal dynamics. As both countries seek to modernise their <b>geodetic</b> <b>datums,</b> the availability of simple yet accurate transformations will be {{critical to the success of}} the modernisation process. This paper outlines the options for dynamic datum transformations within a modernised datum, discussing the strengths and weaknesses of each approach...|$|R
