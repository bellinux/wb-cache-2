25|$|The <b>inchworm,</b> or looper {{caterpillars}} {{from the}} family Geometridae are so named {{because of the way}} they move, appearing to measure the earth (the word geometrid means earth-measurer in Greek); the primary reason for this unusual locomotion is the elimination of nearly all the prolegs except the clasper on the terminal segment.|$|E
25|$|Some limbless animals, such as leeches, have {{suction cups}} on {{either end of}} their body, which allow them to move by {{anchoring}} the rear end and then moving forward the front end, which is then anchored and then the back end is pulled in, and so on. This is known as two-anchor movement. A legged animal, the <b>inchworm,</b> also moves like this, clasping with appendages {{at either end of}} its body.|$|E
25|$|In walking, and {{for many}} animals running, the motion of legs {{on either side of}} the body {{alternate}}s, i.e. is out of phase. Other animals, such as a horse when galloping, or an <b>inchworm,</b> alternate between their front and back legs. An alternative to a gait that alternates between legs is hopping or saltation, where all legs move together. As a main means of locomotion, this is usually found in bipeds or semi-bipeds. Among the mammals saltation is commonly used among macropods (kangaroos and their relatives), jerboas, springhares, kangaroo rats, hopping mice, gerbils, and sportive lemurs. Certain tendons in kangaroo hind legs are very elastic, allowing kangaroos to effectively bounce along conserving energy from hop to hop, making hopping a very energy efficient way to move around in their nutrient poor environment. Saltation is also used by many small birds. Frogs and fleas also hop.|$|E

2500|$|The name [...] "Geometridae" [...] {{ultimately}} {{derives from}} Latin [...] from Greek [...] ("geometer, earth-measurer"). This {{refers to the}} means of locomotion of the larvae or caterpillars, which lack the full complement of prolegs seen in other lepidopteran caterpillars, with {{only two or three}} pairs at the posterior end instead of the usual five pairs. Equipped with appendages {{at both ends of the}} body, a caterpillar [...] clasps with its front legs and draws up the hind end, then clasps with the hind end (prolegs) and reaches out for a new front attachment - creating the impression that it is measuring its journey. The caterpillars are accordingly called loopers, spanworms, or <b>inchworms</b> after their characteristic looping gait. The cabbage looper and soybean looper are not <b>inchworms,</b> but [...] caterpillars of a different family. In many species of geometer moths, the <b>inchworms</b> are about [...] long. They tend to be green, grey, or brownish and hide from predators by fading into the background or resembling twigs. Many <b>inchworms,</b> when disturbed, stand erect and motionless on their prolegs, increasing the resemblance. Some have humps or filaments. They are gregarious and are generally smooth. Some eat lichen, flowers, or pollen, while some, such as the Hawaiian species of the genus Eupithecia, are even carnivorous. Certain destructive <b>inchworms</b> are called cankerworms.|$|R

25|$|User-generated {{content is}} a major feature of Spore; there are {{eighteen}} different editors (some unique to a phase). All have the same general UI and controls for positioning, scaling and coloring parts, whether {{for the creation of}} a creature, or for a building or vehicle. The Creature editor, for example, allows the player to take what looks like a lump of clay with a spine and mold it into a creature. Once the torso is shaped, the player can add parts such as legs, arms, feet, hands, noses, eyes, and mouths. Many of these parts affect the creature's abilities (speed, strength, diet, etc.), while some parts are purely decorative. Once the creature is formed, it can be painted using a large number of textures, overlays, colors, and patterns, which are procedurally applied depending on the topology of the creature. The only required feature is the mouth. All other parts are optional; for example, creatures without legs will slither on the ground like a slug or an <b>inchworm,</b> and creatures without arms will be unable to pick up objects.|$|E
2500|$|Familiar worms {{include the}} earthworms, members of phylum Annelida. Other {{invertebrate}} groups {{may be called}} worms, especially colloquially. In particular, many unrelated insect larvae are called [...] "worms", such as the railroad worm, woodworm, glowworm, bloodworm, <b>inchworm,</b> mealworm, silkworm, and wooly bear worm.|$|E

5|$|Hydras {{and some}} sea anemones can move slowly over rocks and sea or stream beds by various means: {{creeping}} like snails, crawling like <b>inchworms,</b> or by somersaulting. A few can swim clumsily by waggling their bases.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAdvancement of RNA {{polymerase}} of E. coli {{occurs in}} alternating laps of monotonic and inchworm-like movement. Cycles of <b>inchworming</b> are encoded in DNA and involve straining and relaxation of the ternary complex accompanied by characteristic leaping of DNA and RNA footprints. We {{demonstrate that the}} oligo(T) tract that constitutes {{a normal part of}} transcription terminators acts as an <b>inchworming</b> signal so that the leap coincides with the termination event. Prevention of leaping with a roadblock of cleavage-defective EcoRI protein results in suppression of RNA chain release at a termination site. The results indicate that straining and relaxation of RNA polymerase are steps in the termination mechanism...|$|R

2500|$|The Integrated Truss Structure {{serves as}} a base for the station's primary remote {{manipulator}} system, called the Mobile Servicing System (MSS), which is composed of three main components. Canadarm2, the largest robotic arm on the ISS, has a mass of [...] and is used to dock and manipulate spacecraft and modules on the USOS, hold crew members and equipment in place during EVAs and move Dextre around to perform tasks. Dextre is a [...] robotic manipulator with two arms, a rotating torso and has power tools, lights and video for replacing orbital replacement units (ORUs) and performing other tasks requiring fine control. The Mobile Base System (MBS) is a platform which rides on rails {{along the length of the}} station's main truss. It {{serves as a}} mobile base for Canadarm2 and Dextre, allowing the robotic arms to reach all parts of the USOS. To gain access to the Russian Segment a grapple fixture was added to Zarya on STS-134, so that Canadarm2 can <b>inchworm</b> itself onto the ROS. Also installed during STS-134 was the [...] Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS), which had been used to inspect heat shield tiles on Space Shuttle missions and can be used on station to increase the reach of the MSS. Staff on Earth or the station can operate the MSS components via remote control, performing work outside the station without space walks.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Inchworm</b> is a wheeled ride-on toy {{propelled}} by the bouncing {{motion of the}} rider. It is styled as a Geometer caterpillar, or <b>inchworm.</b> It was initially produced by Hasbro in the 1970s.|$|E
50|$|The <b>inchworm</b> motor is {{commonly}} used in scanning tunneling microscopes (STM's). An STM requires nanometer scale control of its scanning tip near the material it is observing. This control {{can be accomplished by}} connecting the scanning tip to the shaft of the <b>inchworm</b> motor. The <b>inchworm</b> motor, in turn, allows control in a direction normal to the plane of the observed material's surface. Movement across the surface {{is commonly}} referred to as movement in the x-y plane, whereas movement normal to the surface is commonly referred to as movement in the z-direction. Movement of the scanning tip by the <b>inchworm</b> motor is either manually controlled or automatically controlled by connecting the motor to a feedback system.|$|E
50|$|The larvae, called loopers or <b>inchworms,</b> are {{considered}} a serious pest of many tree species because they can cause major defoliation in the new spring growth. If defoliation occurs {{two years in a}} row, the tree can die, especially if it has been stressed by drought.|$|R

5000|$|A few {{species of}} Lepidoptera are {{secondary}} consumers, or predators. These species typically prey upon the eggs of other insects, aphids, scale insects, or ant larvae. Some caterpillars are cannibals, and others prey on caterpillars {{of other species}} (e. g. Hawaiian Eupithecia [...] ). Those of the 15 species in Eupithecia that mirror <b>inchworms,</b> are the only known species of butterflies and moths that are ambush predators. Four species are known to eat snails. For example, the Hawaiian caterpillar, (H. molluscivora), uses silk traps, {{in a manner similar}} to that of spiders, to capture certain species of snails (typically Tornatellides).|$|R
40|$|Inspired by the {{locomotion}} {{of terrestrial}} limbless animals, we study {{the motion of}} a lubricated rod of a hydrogel on a soft substrate. We show {{that it is possible}} to mimic observed biological gaits by vibrating the substrate and by using a variety of mechanisms to break longitudinal and lateral symmetry. Our simple theory and experiments provide a unified view of the creeping, undulating, and <b>inchworming</b> gaits observed in limbless locomotion on land, all of which originate as symmetry-breaking bifurcations of a simple base state associated with periodic longitudinal oscillations of a slender gel. These ideas are therefore also applicable to technological situations that involve moving small, soft solids on substrates...|$|R

5000|$|The {{geometer}} moths are moths {{belonging to}} the family Geometridae of the insect order Lepidoptera, the moths and butterflies. Their scientific name derives from the Ancient Greek geo γη or γαια 'the earth' and metron μέτρων 'measure' {{in reference to the}} way their larvae, or <b>inchworms,</b> appear to [...] "measure the earth" [...] as they move along in a looping fashion. A very large family, it has around 23,000 species of moths described , and over 1400 species from six subfamilies indigenous to North America alone. A well-known member is the peppered moth, Biston betularia, which has been subject of numerous studies in population genetics. Several other geometer moths are notorious pests.|$|R
50|$|Some rotifers {{are free}} {{swimming}} and truly planktonic, others move by <b>inchworming</b> along a substrate, {{and some are}} sessile, living inside tubes or gelatinous holdfasts that are attached to a substrate. About 25 species are colonial (e.g., Sinantherina semibullata), either sessile or planktonic. Rotifers {{are an important part}} of the freshwater zooplankton, being a major foodsource and with many species also contributing to the decomposition of soil organic matter. Most species of the rotifers are cosmopolitan, but there are also some endemic species, like Cephalodella vittata to Lake Baikal. Recent barcoding evidence, however, suggests that some 'cosmopolitan' species, such as Brachionus plicatilis, B. calyciflorus, Lecane bulla, among others, are actually species complexes.|$|R
50|$|However, leeches {{and their}} closest {{relatives}} {{have a body}} structure that is very uniform within the group but significantly {{different from that of}} other annelids, including other members of the Clitellata. In leeches there are no septa, the connective tissue layer of the body wall is so thick that it occupies much of the body, and the two coelomata are widely separated and run the length of the body. They function as the main blood vessels, although they are side-by-side rather than upper and lower. However, they are lined with mesothelium, like the coelomata and unlike the blood vessels of other annelids. Leeches generally use suckers at their front and rear ends to move like <b>inchworms.</b> The anus is on the upper surface of the pygidium.|$|R

Felton's crop of corn is displayed in the left side of the screen and the bugs approach from the right. These bugs include <b>inchworms,</b> moths, caterpillars and slugs. If the bugs get past Felton, they will eat part of his corn crop. Players progress to the next level by getting rid of all of the bugs. In each level, the bugs become faster and there are more of them.|$|R
40|$|This paper derives {{controllability}} {{tests for}} a large class of mechanical systems characterized by nonholonomic constraints and symmetries. Recent research in geometric mechanics {{has led to a}} single, simplified framework that describes this class of systems, which includes examples such as wheeled mobile robots; undulatory robotic and biological locomotion systems, such as paramecia, <b>inchworms,</b> and snakes; and the reorientation of satellites and underwater vehicles. This geometric framework has also been applied to more unusual examples, such as the snakeboard robot, the wobblestone, and the reorientation of a falling cat. Using modern results from nonlinear control theory, we develop accessibility and controllability tests based on this reduced geometric structure. We also discuss parallels between these tests and the construction of open-loop control algorithms, with analogies to the generation of locomotive gaits for robotic systems. 1 Introduction M ECHANICAL systems provide a f [...] ...|$|R
