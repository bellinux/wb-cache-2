40|$|Capítulos en librosA {{method has}} been {{developed}} to support Flight Operations Quality Assurance (FOQA) by identifying anomalous flights based on onboard-recorded flight data using cluster analysis techniques. Unlike current techniques, the method does not require pre-defined thresholds of particular parameters, but detects data patterns which differ from the majority of flights by considering all the available flight parameters. The method converts time series data from multiple flight parameters into a high dimensional data vector. Each vector captures all the available information for a single flight. Cluster analysis of the vectors is performed to identify nominal flights which are associated with large clusters and anomalous flights that {{do not belong to}} a specific cluster. The method was applied to a representative Digital Flight Fata Recorder (DFDR) dataset from an international airline. Detailed analysis was performed on takeoff and approach for 365 B 777 flights. Abnormal flights were detected using the cluster technique which was able to identify anomalous behaviors including: high and low energy states, unusual pitch excursions, abnormal flap settings, high wind conditions. In addition, data clusters representing nominal conditions were also detected. Three distinct takeoff clusters were identified in the B 777 data: one represented a majority of the takeoff cases, one correlated with a specific <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> <b>airport,</b> one correlated with reduced power takeoffs. This initial evaluation indicates that cluster analysis is a promising approach for the identification of anomalous flights from onboard-recorded flight data. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E

Braniff began Douglas DC-3 flights on January 8, 1949, from Lima to La Paz' El Alto International Airport which, with an elevation of 13,400 feet above mean sea level, was and is still today the highest international airport in the world. Larger Douglas DC-4s were substituted on the route when loads required additional capacity. The DC-4s that flew to La Paz were JATO (Jet Assisted Takeoff) equipped aircraft to aid the four engined airliners in the event that an engine was lost on takeoff. Carleton directed pre-service testing of JATO at La Paz, Bolivia, for aircraft operations at <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> <b>airports</b> in the region, in early January 1949. Braniff became the first airline to be certificated by the Civil Aeronautics Authority, as a result of the successful completion of the Carleton-led tests, to operate JATO aircraft at La Paz. Carleton also flew the carrier's first proving flight over the Andean mountain range between Lima and Rio de Janeiro which led to the first non stop flights between the two opposite coastal points. He also oversaw the development of terminals at Campo Grande, Brazil; Guayaquil, Ecuador; and La Paz and Santa Cruz, Bolivia.|$|R

The sample included: (1) 37 <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> rural natives (all male), (2) 125 <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> urban natives (69 male, 58 female), (3) 85 Bolivians of foreign ancestry acclimatized to <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> since birth (40 male, 45 female), (4) 63 Bolivians of foreign ancestry acclimatized to <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> during growth (30 male, 33 female), and (5) 47 non-Bolivians of either European or North American ancestry acclimatized to <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> during adulthood (24 male, 23 female). Results indicate that (1) all samples studied, irrespective of origin or acclimatization status, have larger lung volumes than those predicted from sea level norms; (2) the <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> rural natives have significantly greater lung volumes (vital {{capacity and}} residual lung volume) than the <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> urban natives {{and all the}} non-native <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> samples; (3) males acclimatized to <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> since birth or during growth attain similar lung volumes as <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> urban natives and higher residual lung volumes than subjects acclimatized to <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> during adulthood but lower than the <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> rural natives; (4) females acclimatized to <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> since birth or during growth attain similar lung volumes as subjects acclimatized to <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> during adulthood; (5) age at arrival to <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> is inversely related to residual lung volume but not vital capacity; (6) among subjects acclimatized to <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> during growth, approximately 20 – 25 % of the variability in residual lung volume {{can be explained by}} developmental factors; (7) among <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> rural and urban natives, it appears that approximately 20 – 25 % of the variability in residual lung volume at <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> can be explained by genetic traits associated with skin reflectance and genetic traits shared by siblings; and (8) vital capacity, but not the residual lung volume, is inversely related to occupational activity level. Together these data suggest that the attainment of vital capacity at <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> is influenced more by environmental factors, such as occupational activity level, and body composition than developmental acclimatization. On the other hand, the attainment of an enlarged residual volume is related to both developmental acclimatization and genetic factors. Am. J. Hum.

40|$|The {{continuous}} {{growth of}} air transport has {{raised concerns about}} global aircraft fuel consumption, emissions and noise. Industry’s efforts have identified that to reduce future emissions {{and the impact of}} aircraft operations on the environment will require contribution from: a) New technologies with better efficiency b) Improved asset management and c) Greener manufacturing and recycling processes. This research falls under asset management and involves aircraft trajectory optimisation. Most aircraft trajectory optimisation studies concentrate on optimising fuel burn, emissions and noise. Fuel burn is the dominant contributor to operating costs. During the course of this work, no work was found to better understand from an operator’s perspective how the optimal solutions for minimising fuel burn and protecting the environment will impact on engine useful life and the engine operating costs. Also no work was found to understand how engine component degradation will impact on the optimised solutions for fuel burn and engine life. The contribution to knowledge from this research is a) the assessment of the impact of airport severity factors on engine life consumption and aircraft performance and b) the assessment and quantification of the change in engine life usage when optimising for flight mission fuel burn and the change in flight mission fuel burn when optimising for engine life usage; in both cases the effects of engine component degradation are considered and assessed. The trade-offs between mission fuel burn and engine life optimised trajectories are presented here for a clean (new) engine for three routes (London–Madrid, London–Ankara and London–Abu Dhabi). The engine life calculated was the HPT blade life and HPT disc life due to creep, fatigue and oxidation failure modes independent of each other. Mission fuel burn and engine life trajectory optimisation assessments were conducted to incorporate the effects of degradation after 3000, 4500 and 5250 cycles of operation. Further assessments were made linking aircraft performance to airport severity factors for the clean engine, after 3000 cycles and after 5250 cycles. A techno-economic environmental risk assessment approach was used. The results indicate that <b>airports</b> at <b>higher</b> <b>altitudes</b> e. g. Cairo, suffer more severity due to higher operating temperatures, but benefit from less climb fuel burn and lower operating costs. The severity and fuel burn for take-off at airports with higher ambient temperatures was found to be more due to the higher operating temperatures required. The operating cost at these airports was thus higher. The fuel burn optimised trajectories were found to be achieved at higher operating temperatures with reduced blade life (due to creep, fatigue and oxidation). In particular, for London–Madrid, the blade creep and blade oxidation lives were found to reduce by - 3. 4 % and - 2. 1 % respectively. The blade oxidation life optimised trajectories showed increase in fuel burn of + 3. 6 % and + 4. 9 % for London–Madrid and London–Ankara respectively. The blade creep life optimised trajectories for London–Abu Dhabi were found to benefit from less fuel burn during climb. The disc creep life optimised trajectories showed benefit in fuel burn for London–Ankara and London–Abu Dhabi. The conclusions from the study are: High OAT and <b>high</b> <b>altitude</b> <b>airports</b> such as Abu Dhabi require higher operating temperatures which have severe consequences on the engine component life, fuel burn and emissions. Fuel burn optimised trajectories {{have a negative effect on}} the blade life due to creep, fatigue and oxidation due to higher maximum operating temperatures. However, the reduction in fuel burn outweighs the drop in life, thus benefitting to the operating costs. Optimising for blade creep life benefits the fuel burn for London–Abu Dhabi due to less fuel burn at climb The blade oxidation life optimised trajectories are detrimental to the fuel burn due to slower cruise speeds and more time spent at cruise and descent The disc creep life optimised trajectories benefit the fuel burn for London – Ankara and London–Abu Dhabi due to flying at <b>higher</b> cruise <b>altitudes</b> and burning less fuel. The recommendations from this research include making improvements to the framework such as a) Integrating the lifing methodologies because in reality the failure modes are not entirely independent of each other but do interact b) Develop and incorporate a diagnostics and prognostics tool to predict levels of degradation c) Using actual waypoints and incorporate horizontal trajectory profiles d) Future studies can include noise as an objective, which though mentioned has not been within the scope of this work. e) A key driver to lower operating costs is a considerable reduction in fuel burn. Maintenance costs will inevitably rise with engine life consumption. Further study of the trade-offs between fuel burn and engine life is therefore recommended...|$|R
