25|$|Today I have {{withdrawn}} my {{candidacy for}} President of the United States. I <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> country and my party {{have benefited from}} our having made this effort. Jeri and I will always be grateful for the encouragement and friendship of so many wonderful people.|$|E
500|$|The Don Dunstan Foundation was {{established}} at the University of Adelaide {{shortly before his death}} to push for progressive change and to honour Dunstan's memory. Dunstan had spent his last months helping to lay the platform for its establishment. At the inauguration of the body, Dunstan had said [...] "What we need is a concentration on the kind of agenda which I followed and I <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> death will be useful in this". The foundation's primary work is the giving of scholarships; an additional aim is to promote causes championed by Dunstan such as human rights, social equality, multiculturalism and aboriginal rights.|$|E
500|$|The {{environment}} in Lody's boarding-house was becoming increasingly hostile; his hosts were growing suspicious of him. Their doubts grew as the ongoing espionage scare progressed. He had {{stayed there for}} more than three weeks and his evasive answers when questioned about when he expected to leave did not satisfy them. When they said that his accent appeared to be [...] "more German than American", he knew it was time to go. He wrote in his letter of 27 September that [...] "the fear of espionage is very great and every day I see some Germans going to Redford Barracks under the escort of a soldier... It is advisable for me to vanish for a few days, and to change my place of abode. I can only <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> telegraphic and letter information have duly arrived." [...] He told his controllers that he would go to Ireland, disembarking at Dublin as it was the only Irish port not closed to foreigners. Despite his hopes, his letter was intercepted by the British; this time it was retained as the information therein was of genuine military value.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{gives me}} <b>hopes</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> father is still alive," [...] Ronald said. [...] "Had he been dead {{they might have}} forced her into some other marriage." ...|$|R
60|$|I had <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> {{words would}} madden him, {{and he would}} lose his self-control. To my surprise, they had but little effect. He seemed {{scarcely}} to have heard.|$|R
60|$|Indeed, I {{was now a}} rich man, more by luck than by valour; {{and though}} I said nought of it, I <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> long wooing might now come to a happy end.|$|R
500|$|Thorne-Begland {{commented that}} he was [...] "looking forward to {{continuing}} to serve {{the citizens of the}} city of Richmond and the great commonwealth of Virginia" [...] in his role as a prosecutor. A month later, on June 14, the Richmond Circuit Court judges appointed him to the position for which he was rejected by the legislature. The temporary appointment began July 1, 2012, to expire 30 days after the date the next legislative session began. Governor McDonnell's spokesman congratulated Thorne-Begland on the appointment, stating, [...] "the Governor believes Mr. Thorne-Begland is well-qualified to serve on the bench". Marshall called the move [...] "highly imprudent and arrogant" [...] of the judges: [...] "They're contesting the authority of the General Assembly[...] . . This is an act of defiance on their part. When appointed officials get in fights with elected officials, they invariably lose." [...] Thorne-Begland stated that [...] "I look forward to serving the citizens of the City of Richmond as a jurist, and over the coming months, I <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> service provides comfort to all Virginians that I remain committed to the faithful application of the laws and Constitutions of Virginia and the United States of America." ...|$|E
2500|$|At his {{confirmation}} hearing on February 14, 2006, Warsh touted his experience on Wall Street: [...] "I <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> prior experience on Wall Street, particularly my nearly 7 years at Morgan Stanley, would prove {{beneficial to the}} deliberations and communications of the Federal Reserve." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, The Walt Disney Company {{hired her}} to do a series of {{photographs}} with celebrities in various roles and scenes for the Walt Disney Parks and Resorts [...] "Year of a Million Dreams" [...] campaign. Leibovitz claims she never liked the word [...] "celebrity". [...] "I've always been more interested in what they do than who they are, I <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> photographs reflect that." [...] She tries to receive {{a little piece of}} each subject's personality in the photos.|$|E
5000|$|I {{have chosen}} to take my life. It's an {{appropriate}} end to the present situation. I had <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> decision {{to withdraw from the}} election and leave public life would have closed the matter. Apparently these steps are not satisfactory to those who feel more is required.|$|R
40|$|My very aim {{in writing}} this book, however, {{has been to}} show that the major {{characters}} of Nostromo cannot be fully understood without detailed analysis of the minor characters. I am in some <b>hopes</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> critical notes on the attempts of others to interpret the book will demonstrate that I have been right. [...] . Zie: Preface...|$|R
60|$|I {{went home}} with him at once in high glee, for I have been a {{collector}} of old English gold and silver coinage for several years, and I was in <b>hopes</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> friendly ploughman's find might contain something good {{in the way of}} Anglo-Saxon pennies or shillings, considering the very promising place in which he had unearthed it.|$|R
2500|$|In {{particular}} I {{express my}} highest {{regard for the}} followers of Buddhism, the majority religion in Sri Lanka, with its … four great values of … loving kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy and equanimity; with its ten transcendental virtues and the joys of the Sangha expressed so beautifully in the Theragathas. I ardently <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> visit will serve to strengthen the goodwill between us, {{and that it will}} reassure everyone of the Catholic Church's desire for interreligious dialogue and cooperation in building a more just and fraternal world. To everyone I extend the hand of friendship, recalling the splendid words of the Dhammapada: [...] "Better than a thousand useless words is one single word that gives peace...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Aye!" [...] sneered Gaston, still writhing with pain, [...] "at my service now, {{when you}} <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> broken wrist will ensure your impunity." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must take}} more care of yourself," [...] she said gravely. [...] "I <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> father has {{expressed}} himself properly about the lecture." ...|$|E
60|$|THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [turning sharply on her] Good afternoon, madam. I {{am sorry}} to have had to put your friend in his place; but I find that here as {{elsewhere}} {{it is necessary to}} assert myself if I am to be treated with proper consideration. I had <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> position as a guest would protect me from insult.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{go for a}} moment," [...] Tom cried, desperately detaining his {{companion}} by {{the sleeve of her}} jacket. [...] "We are alone here and can talk. Don't you think--don't you think you could like me a little bit if you were to try? I love you so, Kate, that I cannot help <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> love is not all lost." ...|$|R
50|$|I was lucky. The flight {{behind me}} saw the MiGs {{and tried to}} divert its attention. I broke to the left, sharply enough to get away of his line of fire, <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> wingman {{would take care of}} him. Meanwhile another MiG came out of the clouds, turning widely about my ’11 o’clock’ at a {{distance}} of 2,000 yards. He went into the clouds again and I tried to follow.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Harrison {{looked at}} me very {{steadily}} indeed. Then he looked at Eve. I can only <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> own expression was as guileless as Eve's.|$|E
60|$|I cannot {{tell you}} how much obliged I am to you for {{altering}} the child, or how much I <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> wish in that respect didn't go greatly against the grain.|$|E
6000|$|... 82. I <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> {{saying so}} {{will make you}} eager to {{interrupt}} me. 'What! Rembrandt's etchings, and Lupton's mezzotints, and Le Keux's line-work,--do {{you mean to tell}} us that these ignore light and shade?' ...|$|E
5000|$|In July 2009, while {{undergoing}} radiation therapy, he {{was interviewed}} by the Washington Post: [...] "I recovered very quickly after my surgery, and I've been <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> better-than-average constitution will keep the worst effects of radiation at bay. My voice and energy still {{seem to be in}} decent shape, so maybe I can pull these gigs off after all." [...] He continued to tour and perform while receiving his treatments.|$|R
2500|$|I was lucky. [...] The flight {{behind me}} saw the MiGs {{and tried to}} divert its attention. I broke to the left, sharply enough to get away of his line of fire, <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> wingman {{would take care of}} him. [...] Meanwhile another MiG came out of the clouds, turning widely about my ’11 o’clock’ at a {{distance}} of 2,000 yards. [...] He went into the clouds again and I tried to follow.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very few," [...] {{said the}} foreman; and I <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> face was as expressionless as I {{tried to make}} it when I heard the count. [...] "Some of those near the fence got clear, and some didn't. Steel had grubbed up a post, and when the wires slacked part of the rest got tangled up and went down, choking the gap. It was worse than a Chicago {{slaughter-house}} when the fire rolled up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have decided," [...] I answered. [...] "I <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> {{son would}} never forgive me either; {{but if it}} is otherwise, why, so it must be. Also Barung has made no {{promises}} about him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I trust, madame," [...] Hector said bluntly, [...] "that {{there will}} be little {{opportunity}} {{for me to take}} lessons as to the manners of the court, for I <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> stay here will be short indeed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was afraid}} to disturb you while you were resting," [...] Mrs. Linley said. [...] "Let me <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> {{housekeeper}} has done what I might have done myself, if I had seen you when you arrived." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Glowing at {{my heart}} I feel this <b>hope,</b> <b>that</b> to <b>my</b> father, dear And dear to thee, my mother, dear to thee, My brother, I shall go.' [...] POTTER.|$|R
6000|$|... “I {{was afraid}} {{it would be}} so,” he continued. “Very few boys can be taught to work industriously, without being compelled; though I <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> little Rollo could have been. But as it is, as I find that persuasion will not do, I must do {{something}} more decided. I should do very wrong to let you grow up an idle boy; {{and it is time}} for you to begin to learn to do something besides play.” ...|$|R
60|$|Such, after a not immoderate delay, was {{the opinion}} {{expressed}} to Dr Thorne by his law advisers; and such, in fact, {{turned out to}} be the case. I will leave the matter so, <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> very absence of defence may serve to protect me from severe attack. If under such a will as that described as having been made by Sir Roger, Mary would not have been the heiress, that will must have been described wrongly.|$|R
6000|$|... "We can easily," [...] Lord Ashleigh declared, [...] "find a {{temporary}} butler. Macdougal {{has lived in}} New York for some years, and you will doubtless find this a great advantage, Ella. I <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> suggestion pleases you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So please you," [...] {{said the}} man, [...] "my instant {{business}} {{was not with}} your reverend lordship, but with my lord the Constable, to whom I will <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> good news may atone for my evil apparel." ...|$|E
6000|$|Later.--The {{letter was}} to express an earnest <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> father had set out. My poor mother is sinking, they fear. What {{will become of}} Caroline? O, how I wish I could see mother; why could not both have gone? ...|$|E
60|$|This much hope, however, can be {{extracted}} from {{the present state of}} things. It is so fantastic, so mad, so apparently impossible, that no scheme of reform need ever henceforth be discredited on the ground that it is fantastic or mad or apparently impossible. It is the sensible schemes, unfortunately, that are hopeless in England. Therefore I have great <b>hopes</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> own views, though fundamentally sensible, can be made to appear fantastic enough to have a chance.|$|R
40|$|My work {{is about}} the inevitability of change and the {{concomitant}} longing for stability. It explores various manifestations of loss – death, physical distance, erasure – {{and the desire to}} hold tight to something that is already passing. The videos in this body of work convey intensely personal narratives about cultural assimilation, sexual orientation, and departure, in <b>hopes</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> own vulnerability can reveal something that is not identity-specific but human.

5000|$|... “My {{career is}} {{approaching}} its sunset, and in Caruncho I see someone who {{may well be}} the only landscape architect who is guided by the same principles and ideals that I have tried to realize over the course of my work. I have been <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> way of thinking, which is purely a method of recognizing and solving a problem and is not necessarily unique to me, would be projected, and I believe he is the ideal one to carry it forward.” ...|$|R
