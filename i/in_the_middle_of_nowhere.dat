He tells them that he let Lisa ride the bus alone. Lenny and Carl point out the error of his judgment, and Homer leaves work to go look for her. He heads to the museum and ends up in downtown Springfield. He uses a cherrypicker to get up higher. Homer and Lisa spot each other, but the vehicle's wheels creak backwards and it rolls down a hill. It slides off the edge of a pier at the harbor into a river. Lisa tells the drawbridge operator to close the bridge so Homer can grab on. His head is caught between the two closing halves and he survives with nothing more than a few tire marks across his forehead.|$|E

25|$|After the tour's {{last show}} {{concluded}} in San Francisco, Shi secretly left his {{hotel in the}} middle of the night and escaped in order to defect from China to the United States. Speaking no English, Shi directed a cab driver with hand signals to an unknown destination, but the frustrated driver dropped him off <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>nowhere</b> and called the police. Shi showed the police his passport and some newspaper clippings featuring him, so the police requested the driver take him to a Chinese restaurant in order to find someone who could communicate with him. However, since the staff at the restaurant spoke only Cantonese, and not Shi's Mandarin, the monk wrote down his communications, since both dialects employ the same characters. The restaurant staff helped Shi phone a friend in New York City, who had someone pick up Shi, who hid in a basement for a week, eating only bread and cereal, while the news media were reporting his escape. After a week, he traveled to New York.|$|E
25|$|Since Korellian law forbids Foundation missionaries {{to be on}} {{the planet}} under penalty of death, the crew determines that the Reverend Jord Parma of Anacreon (as he calls himself) had been {{captured}} by the Korellians but managed to escape before being killed. Rev. Parma is injured, apparently mentally confused, and in need of hospitalization. A short time after Parma has been aboard the ship, an angry mob appears, surrounding the Far Star, and demanding that the missionary be turned over to them as an escaped criminal. This rapid response by the Korellians in what is an extremely remote location arouses Mallow's suspicions: Where did Parma actually escape from? Why was there a mob seemingly already gathered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>nowhere?</b> And how were they able to pinpoint the location of the Far Star and surround it so promptly after Parma boarded the ship? Suspecting a set-up, rather than fight the mob, Mallow decides to turn the missionary over to them (and to certain death), despite Twer's frantic attempt to intervene. Soon afterwards, Mallow is invited to meet with Korell's authoritarian ruler, Commdor ("First Citizen Of The State") Asper Argo, indicating that Mallow had apparently passed a test by the Korellians by showing respect for their laws. Argo appears friendly and welcomes Foundation technological gifts; however, he refuses to allow Scientism on Korell, and Mallow agrees not to encourage missionary work in the Republic.|$|E
