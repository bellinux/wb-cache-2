This bench was mainly composed of inertial <b>flywheels,</b> brake, <b>clutch,</b> dynameters, and controller. When testing the power train, the engine, power train, inertial <b>flywheels,</b> brake, <b>clutch</b> and dynameters are connected in series. One end of inertial flywheels is connected with output end of power train; the other end is connected with a clutch. Between the inertial <b>flywheels</b> and <b>clutch,</b> there is a brake for braking of <b>flywheels.</b> The <b>clutch</b> is for connection and disconnection of inertial flywheels and dynameters. This new test bench can perform different power modes with corresponding operation modes set in the main controller...|$|R

50|$|The World of Outlaws (WoO) is a {{division}} of winged sprint cars that run all over the United States and have a few events in Canada. The cars have 15 in wide right rear tire and a 410 cubic inch engine with mechanical fuel injection. These sprint cars have no battery or a starter in them, necessitating a push start by a quad or truck. They also do not have <b>flywheels,</b> <b>clutches</b> or transmissions, but the direct drive system can be engaged or disengaged from the cockpit. This is done both for weight reasons and tradition. Another tradition the WoO has for their A-main (the last race of the event) {{is to have the}} cars line up four wide just before starting the race.|$|R
50|$|The Ford {{flathead}} V8 {{drove the}} rear wheels via a custom Stout-built three-speed manual transaxle. The engine was reversed from its normal position, mounted directly over the rear axle and with the <b>flywheel</b> and <b>clutch</b> facing forwards.

Clutch plate assembly has three principal components i. e. <b>Flywheel,</b> <b>Clutch</b> plate and Pressure Plate. The device used is the Clutch which transmits the rotary motion of the engine to the transmission, which required by the driver and located between the engine and the gear box and which it connects and disconnects the two units smoothly without shock. As per the theory of the Clutch, first assumption is used in case of problems involving power absorption by friction.

40|$|The {{study of}} the dynamic {{behavior}} of annular discs is important, as several machine components such as <b>flywheels,</b> <b>clutch</b> plates, circular saw plates etc. {{can be considered as}} annular discs for the purpose of analysis. The work presented in this paper is a modal analysis of annular disc structure by using finite element analysis software (ANSYS). Natural frequencies and maximum deformation of structure of three different materials are used for comparative {{study of the}} variation in characteristics of the structure for various ratios of inner to outer radius conditions. It is found that as aspect ratio approaches to unity (one) natural frequency approaches to its maximum value. Also the natural frequencies and deformation increases with increasing number of nodal diameters. Based on the results of finite element analysis of the three materials it is compared and concluded that the Nimonic 90 disc exhibits good behavior in case of natural frequencies and MP 35 N disc exhibits good behavior in case of deformation as the deformation is less in this compared to the other two materials...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Clutch {{system is}} among the main systems inside a vehicle. Clutch is a {{mechanical}} device located between a vehicle engine and its transmission and provides mechanical coupling between the engine and transmission input shaft. Clutch system comprise of <b>flywheel,</b> <b>clutch</b> disc plate and friction material, pressure plate, clutch cover, diaphragm spring and the linkage necessary to operate the clutch. The clutch engages the transmission gradually by allowing {{a certain amount of}} slippage between the flywheel and the transmission input shaft. However, the slipping mechanism of the clutch generates heat energy due to friction between the clutch disc and the flywheel. At high sliding velocity, excessive frictional heat is generated which lead to high temperature rise at the clutch disc surface, and this causes thermo-mechanical problems such as thermal deformations and thermo-elastic instability which can lead to thermal cracking, wear and other mode of failure of the clutch disc component. In this project, the modeling of clutch is done in detailed using modeling software. After that the FEM analysis is done for sintered iron friction material. The stresses & deformation obtained for this friction material is then compared to analysis software result. The analysis is done for worn out friction disc.

50|$|In motor vehicles, the {{transmission}} generally {{is connected to}} the engine crankshaft via a <b>flywheel</b> or <b>clutch</b> or fluid coupling, partly because internal combustion engines cannot run below a particular speed. The output of {{the transmission}} is transmitted via the driveshaft to one or more differentials, which drives the wheels. While a differential may also provide gear reduction, its primary purpose is to permit the wheels at either end of an axle to rotate at different speeds (essential to avoid wheel slippage on turns) as it changes the direction of rotation.|$|R

While John Davenport was correct that, in 1975, this list included alternative cylinder heads with different numbers of valves, it also did include alternative gearboxes with overdrives, <b>flywheels,</b> <b>clutches</b> and their housing, and many other engine, transmission, and suspension components.

But when the 16-valve TR7 was homologated for Group 4 in October 1975, the 100-off rule did not require the production of any 16-valve engined road cars, only the kits needed to equip them.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} an optimal Energy Management Strategy (EMS) for a low-cost mechanical-hybrid powertrain. It uses mechanical components only a <b>flywheel,</b> <b>clutches,</b> gears, and a continuously variable transmission for its hybrid functionalities of brake energy recuperation, reduction of inefficient part-load operation of the engine, and engine shutoff during vehicle standstill. This powertrain has mechanical characteristics, such as a relatively small energy storage capacity {{in the form of}} the compact flywheel and multiple driving modes to operate the powertrain because of the use of clutches. The optimization problem is complex because it is twofold: (i) to find the optimal sequence of driving modes and (ii) to find the optimal power distribution between the engine, flywheel, and vehicle. Dynamic programming is used to compute the globally optimal EMS for six representative driving cycles. The main design criterion is the minimization of the overall fuel consumption, subject to the systems kinematics, dynamics, and constraints. The results provide a benchmark of the fuel saving potential of this powertrain design and give insight in the optimal utilization of the flywheel system. In addition, the complexity (and computation time) of the problem is reduced by a priori (static) optimization of the power distribution for each driving mode. Static optimization of a dynamic optimization problem yields a sub-optimal solution; however, the results show that the consequences on the fuel saving are small with respect to the optimal one (the difference is 2 ̆ 6 lt; 0. 8...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{irregularity}} of the I. C. engine torque, {{the impacts}} between the tooth of the unloaded gear pairs of {{a gear box}} produce vibrations originating an acoustic phenomenon, known as “gear rattle noise”. The paper presents a theoretical study on the dynamic behaviour of automotive transmissions focusing {{on the presence of}} oil between the impacting tooth of the meshing gears. This rattle phenomenon is particularly audible at low regimes and regards all the gear pairs different from the gear inserted to transmit the power. Another operating condition that manifests the gear rattle phenomenon is typically the “idle condition”, when all the gear pairs are meshing but without loading. The presence of oil between the impacting tooth of the gear pairs can play a positive role to decrease the vibrations and than the rattle noise level. In the paper some driveline complete models comprising many components as <b>flywheel,</b> <b>clutch,</b> primary and secondary shafts, are described accounting for the presence of oil lubricant between the teeth of the unloaded gear pairs. The described models consider an oil film lubrication between the tooth of the gear pairs, starting from the Reynolds equation and adopting some hypotheses regarding in particular the oil squeeze effect and also hypotheses about the teeth shape. Moreover some dissipative terms as friction and hysteresis in the clutch springs together with the oil drag torque in the gear box elements have been considered and modelled in the article...|$|R

In passenger car equipped with automatic transmissions the electronic management of the coupling between engine and transmission couldn’t provide sensible improvement of comfort and overall vehicle performance during gearshifts without the availability of dependable models of the <b>flywheel,</b> <b>clutch</b> and driveline as powerful tools for vehicle design engineers. In this paper, simulations of driveline vibrational behaviour have been performed by implementing a high-order multi-body model for the dry clutch mechanism {{with the purpose of}} studying the excitation of torsional vibration caused by frictional actions during the slip phase of the clutch engagement in manual or automated manual transmissions. The analysis aims at deepen about the coupling between pressure plate wobbling and torsional motions in order to improve the current understanding of the excitation mechanisms in the frequency region of the so-called “eek noise”, 250 - 500 Hz. The results of this work substantiate that enhancing of torsional motion in the characteristic frequency range of the eek effect occurs in vehicle launch and gear shifting operations regardless of the rigid wobbling motion of the pressure plate. Such outcomes underline the need to include the non-linear characteristic of the clutch cushion spring in the simulation frictional induced vibration originated at clutch level.

This housing is bolted to the engine block and derives its name from the bell-like shape that its internal components necessitate. The starter motor is usually mounted here, and engages with a ring gear on the flywheel. On the opposite end to the engine is usually bolted to the gearbox. The use of different bellhousings on a transmission allows the same transmission to be used on multiple engines in multiple applications.

50|$|In {{a manual}} transmission, the {{flywheel}} {{is attached to}} the engine's crankshaft and spins along with it.

As the clutch pedal is depressed, the throw out bearing is activated, which causes the pressure plate to stop applying pressure to the clutch disk. This makes the clutch plate stop receiving power from the engine, so that the gear can be shifted without damaging the transmission. When the clutch pedal is released, the throw out bearing is deactivated, and the clutch disk is again held against the flywheel, allowing it to start receiving power from the engine.|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} project is to determine a passenger vehicles' acceleration and top speed change {{in response to the}} change in the ratio of the final drive gearing coefficient. To accomplish this, the following tasks had to be completed: analysis of the transmission types, their construction and the operation of the final drive assembly, performing a numerical analysis and comparing it to dynamic real world test results using a “BMW (E 36) 318 is” as the test subject. The car chosen for {{this research}} is a “BMW (E 36) 318 is” due to its classical arrangement comprised of a front mounted four cylinder petrol engine and rear wheel drive. The analysis of the final drive gearing in such arrangement is easier, due to the transmission being separate from the rear mounted differential assembly. By changing the differential housings which have different internal gearing, their effect on the vehicle's acceleration and top speed could be observed and compared to the calculations of expected values. The research was started by gathering and analyzing material about the power delivery chain in the manual transmission vehicle model to develop a familiarity with the components: <b>flywheel,</b> <b>clutch,</b> transmission and integrated subframe final drive assembly. In regards to the available final drive assemblies, four differential housings were chosen with the following internal gearing configurations to conduct this study: 2. 79 : 1 – the lowest one, available from the factory in the diesel powered vehicles known for their high torque. 3. 15 : 1 – the gear set mostly found in the high powered petrol engine cars. 3. 45 : 1 – the gear set that came standard with the chosen test vehicle. 4. 10 : 1 – the gear set used for the least powerful petrol engines, usually coupled with automatic transmissions. Changing the differential therefore changes the gearing of the final drive assembly and provides a change in vehicle dynamics. After conducting the gathering and analysis of the available information from the data-sheets and literal documentation, practical tests were conducted using a “DL 1 ” data collection tool to capture the information about the response of the car with all four aforementioned differentials. Using the “Analysis V 8 ” software with the said tool, the top speed and acceleration for each gear and all four differentials were determined, alongside the engine RPM for 50 km/h and 90 km/h for different gears. Finally the theoretical calculations for the top speed at max engine in every gear were calculated. They were correlated with the observed values for our measurements, including the top RPM for each gear and the engine RPM for 50 km/h in 3 'rd gear, 50 km/h and 90 km/h in 4 th gear, 90 km/h in 5 th gear. The observations conclude that increasing the ratio of the gear set in the differential leads to a quicker accelerating vehicle, but it negatively affects the comfort and fuel consumption. The best gear set ratio for fuel economy and acceleration for our test vehicle was determined to be the factory 3. 45 : 1 although with increased driving speed (above 90 km/h) fuel economy and comfort are reduced. For users who spend most of their commute at highway speeds, it would be recommended to switch their final drive assembly to the one with the ratio of 2. 79 : 1 for increased comfort and decreased fuel consumption. The conducted research is unique in terms of applicability. A user could tailor their car to their needs in regard to the expected driving conditions based on this research. Also- the calculated and observed data have a very close correlation, therefore a calculated final drive ratio selection could be trusted to have the expected result on the vehicle...|$|R

40|$|Flywheel {{systems are}} {{attractive}} in hybrid and electric vehicles {{due to their}} ability to handle power during acceleration and braking. The combination of a flywheel device with a battery source has several advantages such as high peak power capacity, high energy density and {{reduction in the number of}} charge/discharge cycles of the battery. A flywheel based all-electric driveline is investigated in this thesis. The novelty of the system consists in the use of a <b>double</b> wound <b>flywheel</b> machine, which divides the system in two different power levels. Due to this configuration, the system becomes efficient and can handle the power developed during fast dynamical processes. The complete driveline consists of three main components: the battery, the flywheel machine and the wheel motor. The High-Power (HP) side of the driveline connects the flywheel machine to the wheel motor, whereas the Low-Power (LP) side connects the flywheel machine to the battery. The connections of different components of the system are made electrically through power converter devices. The present thesis focuses on the electrical converters and control strategies used in the flywheel based all-electric driveline. The control of power converters is responsible for the logic and functionality of the driveline, being a challenging step within this project. Different power converter topologies have been investigated: a DC/DC plus a DC/AC converter on the LP side, and an AC/DC/AC converter on the HP side. The design and assembly of the power electronics and their control scheme have been successfully implemented. Different control strategies have been suggested and a complete scaled driveline has been assembled and tested based on previous simulation results. Results have confirmed the functionality of the driveline, where smoothed output power has been obtained from the battery, whereas the flywheel handles power transients on the traction side. An average efficiency of about 87 % (battery to wheels) has been obtained. The power converter systems have been shown to be efficient and robust, with control strategies able to handle the peak energy flow in the system. A regenerative braking strategy has been simulated and a wheel-to-wheel efficiency of about 80 % has been estimated...|$|R

Some say it was produced {{to compete with the}} Messerschmitt KR175 which also appeared that year. This is not surprising as both cars were built by aircraft companies and shared a similar cockpit and tandem seating layout. The Inter was produced by SNCAN in their aircraft factory at Villeurbanne in the region of Lyon; Just over 300 units were built between 1954 and 1956. Early advertising literature reveals that two models were offered, one with a cockpit cover that hinged open from the side and named the Berline, the other an open bodied version called the Torpedo. Both cars were powered by a small Ydral 175cc two-stroke engine driving the single rear wheel. The Inter had some unusual features not least being its ability to fold together its two front half axles so as to facilitate easy storage, however this feature only appears on the first few cars made as it proved to be impractical and was soon discontinued. The Inter also featured a device called a gyrostarter, this was in effect a kind of electric kick start made by the American electromechanical giant WestinghouseThe device consists of a built in electric 6 volt motor with a <b>clutched</b> <b>flywheel,</b> the momentum of the rotating flywheel is transferred to the engine by means of its clutch once it has built up sufficient speed, it sounds much like a helicopter preparing for take off!

25|$|To {{adapt the}} BMW M52 engine to the Defender chassis, the {{engineers}} {{were able to}} utilize some of the parts from the recently developed BMW M51 diesel powered Range Rover 2.5 DSE.

The unique clutch housing adaptor was necessary because the petrol M52 engine is tilted 10 degrees compared to the diesel M51 engine and it needed to be longer to match the input shaft of the R380 gearbox borrowed from the 300Tdi Defender. Due to the large diameter gearbox input shaft, the standard BMW pilot bearing could not be fitted, so a unique pilot bushing made of Oilite bronze was developed. It had an inside diameter of 7/8 inch with an outside diameter of 32mm. A mixture of non-metric and metric specifications are common on Land Rovers. Other unique parts that were developed for the 2.8i were the air intake ducts {{both before and after the}} Donaldson FPG RadialSeal™ air cleaner, engine mounts, radiator cowl, cooling hoses, fuel lines, clutch lines, air conditioning system, engine wiring, tachometer gauge, exhaust system, and a specially tuned Siemens MS41.0 DME with a Lucas 10AS alarm in place of the Drive Away Protection system (EWS) used on BMWs. There were also major changes for the 1999 model year, which included updated instrumentation, different chassis and engine wiring, an updated cooling system with aluminum radiator, and an updated fuel system with new fuel tank. The 1.667:1 gear ratio LT230 transfer box gave the vehicle a “rev happy” nature which delighted many off-road enthusiasts and made the vehicle particularly well suited for traversing a wide range of grueling terrain such as sand dunes. The high gear ratio also helped the 2.8i sprint from 0–100km/h in 9.3 seconds, making it the fastest production Defender ever made.|$|R
