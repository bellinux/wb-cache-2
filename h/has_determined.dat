5|$|Aarhus is {{the seat}} of Aarhus Municipality and Aarhus City Council (Aarhus Byråd) is also the {{municipal}} government. The Mayor of Aarhus until 2017 is Jacob Bundsgaard of the Social Democrats. Municipal elections are held every fourth year on the third Tuesday of November. The city council consists of 31 members elected for four-year terms. When an election <b>has</b> <b>determined</b> {{the composition of the}} council, it elects a mayor, two deputy mayors and five aldermen from their ranks. Anyone who is eligible to vote and who resides within the municipality can run for a seat on the city council provided they can secure endorsements and signatures from 50 inhabitants of the municipality.|$|E
5|$|Chira Endress, {{a student}} of Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, United States, focused on a section of glaciogenic sediments {{immediately}} beneath the same Ice Peak trachyte lava flow sampled and described by Jeff Hungerford during his 2006 studies. Endress ettempted {{to determine if the}} sediments were deposited immediately before the lava flow was emplaced, or if {{they are likely to be}} much older. Endress has quantified the mineralogy of clasts and sand-sized particles from samples in the sediment, and <b>has</b> <b>determined</b> that the mineralogy of several of the trachytic clasts is very similar to that in the overlying lava flow, including the minerals clinopyroxene, magnetite, alkali feldspar, and aenigmatite. Endress has also found small lenses of pristine basaltic glass, which could have derived from the Pillow Ridge subglacial mound near Mount Edziza.|$|E
5|$|Consensus <b>has</b> <b>determined</b> sea turtles, {{including}} E. imbricata to be, at {{the very}} least, threatened species because of their slow growth and maturity, and slow reproductive rates. Many adult turtles {{have been killed by}} humans, both accidentally and deliberately. Their existence is threatened due to pollution and loss of nesting areas because of coastal development. Biologist guess that the hawkbill population has declined 80 percent in the past hundred years. Human and animal encroachment threatens nesting sites, and small mammals dig up the eggs to eat. In the US Virgin Islands, mongooses raid hawksbill nests (along with those of other sea turtles, such as Dermochelys coriacea) right after they are laid.|$|E

5|$|Several Scottish clans {{that were}} {{historically}} seated on Lewis {{have traditionally been}} ascribed a descent from Óláfr. The MacLeods claim a descent from Leod (Old Norse Ljótr), who is popularly {{said to have been}} a son of Óláfr. Clan traditions dating to the late 18th century link Leod with Óláfr, and heraldic evidence dating to the late 17th century may be the earliest indication of such a claim; however, recent research into the MacLeods' traditional ancestry <b>has</b> <b>determined</b> such claims of descent from Óláfr are unsupportable. Other Lewis clans have been linked with Óláfr in various traditions, such as the Morrisons of Ness and their adversaries the Macaulays of Uig, although there is no supporting evidence that Óláfr left any descendants on the island.|$|E

5|$|Using Dexter Morgan's (Michael C. Hall) {{satellite}} navigation system, Lila Tournay (Jaime Murray) {{arrives at the}} cabin in the Everglades. She breaks in to find an imprisoned Sgt. James Doakes (Erik King), who tells her that Dexter is the Bay Harbor Butcher. She can only sympathize with Dexter, however, for having to hide such an enormous secret, and refuses to unlock Doakes's cage. Convinced that Dexter is her soul mate, Lila tries to help him by blowing up the cabin with Doakes inside. Meanwhile, FBI Special Agent Frank Lundy's (Keith Carradine) task force <b>has</b> <b>determined</b> Doakes's location, and Dexter must race his colleagues to reach the cabin first. When he arrives at the cabin, he discovers {{that it has been}} destroyed in a fire and at first believes it to be a miracle. The next morning, the police find Doakes's body in the water, while Dexter embraces his freedom. He visits his girlfriend Rita Bennett's (Julie Benz) house, where they reconcile after having sex.|$|E
