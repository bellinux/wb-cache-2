40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{performance}} of a novel View-Oriented Parallel Programming style for parallel programming on cluster computers. View-Oriented Parallel Programming is based on Distributed Shared Memory which is friendly and easy for programmers to use. It requires the programmer to <b>divide</b> <b>shared</b> data into views according to the memory access pattern of the parallel algorithm. One of the advantages of this programming style is that it offers the performance potential for the underlying Distributed Shared Memory system to optimize consistency maintenance. Also it allows the programmer to participate in performance optimization of a program through wise partitioning of the shared data into views. Experimental results demonstrate a significant performance gain of the programs based on the View-Oriented Parallel Programming style...|$|R

The men rarely partook in the dismemberment and consumption of the corpse.

A series of purification rituals meant to cleanse the body of kwela then took place over several weeks. Finally, there were feasts and rituals that simultaneously compensated the women for housing the kwela, acted as the final step in cleansing the body of kwela, and sent all remaining parts of the soul {{to the land of the}} dead.|$|R

40|$|This edited volume {{examines}} the continued viability of {{international human rights}} law {{in the context of}} growing transnational law enforcement. With states increasingly making use of global governance modes, core exercises of public authority such as migration control, surveillance, detention and policing, are increasingly conducted extraterritorially, outsourced to foreign governments or delegated to non-state actors. New forms of cooperation raise difficult questions about <b>divided,</b> <b>shared</b> and joint responsibility under international human rights law. At the same time, some governments engage in transnational law enforcement exactly to avoid such responsibilities, creatively seeking to navigate the complex, overlapping and sometimes unclear bodies of international law. As such, this volume argues that this area represents a particular dark side of globalisation, requiring both scholars and practitioners to revisit basic assumptions and legal strategies...|$|R
40|$|Visual Cryptography is {{a special}} type of {{encryption}} technique to obscure image-based secret information which can be decrypted by Human Visual System (HVS). This cryptographic system encrypts the secret image by dividing it into n number of shares and decryption is done by superimposing {{a certain number of}} shares(k) or more. Simple visual cryptography is insecure because of the decryption process done by human visual system. The secret information can be retrieved by anyone if the person gets at least k number of shares. Watermarking is a technique to put a signature of the owner within the creation. In this current work we have proposed Visual Cryptographic Scheme for color images where the <b>divided</b> <b>shares</b> are enveloped in other images using invisible digital watermarking. The shares are generated using Random Number...|$|R
