5|$|An {{enthusiastic}} {{reader and}} independent thinker as a child, Balzac had trouble {{adapting to the}} teaching style of his grammar school. His willful nature caused trouble throughout his life and frustrated his ambitions {{to succeed in the}} world of business. When he finished school, Balzac was apprenticed in a law office, but <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> on the study of law after wearying of its inhumanity and banal routine. Before and during his career as a writer, he attempted to be a publisher, printer, businessman, critic, and politician; he failed in all of these efforts. La Comédie Humaine reflects his real-life difficulties, and includes scenes from his own experience.|$|E

25|$|In 1993, Foreman {{received}} another title shot, {{although this}} was for the vacant WBO title. Foreman's opponent was Tommy Morrison, a young prospect known for his punching power. Morrison retreated throughout the fight, refusing to trade toe-to-toe, and sometimes <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> on Foreman. The strategy paid off and he outboxed Foreman from long range. After 12 rounds, Morrison won a unanimous decision.|$|E

By his 16th birthday, he was the Ajax youth team's highest scorer and best player, and Ajax duly offered Benayoun a {{four-year}} professional contract. However, Benayoun {{and his family had}} not settled very well in Amsterdam, and so <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> on the contract and returned to Israel after just eight months.|$|E

Amongst other things, the company was involved in building steam locomotives and colliery winding engines. The company built a number of locomotives for the Stockton and Darlington Railway.|$|E

500|$|The Brazilian {{government}} {{secured the}} hand of Princess Teresa Cristina of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. She and PedroII were married by proxy in Naples on 30 May 1843. Upon seeing her in person, the Emperor was noticeably disappointed. Teresa Cristina was short, a bit overweight and though not ugly, neither was she pretty. He did little to hide his disillusionment. One observer stated that <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> to Teresa Cristina, another depicted him as being so shocked {{that he needed to}} sit, and it is possible that both occurred. That evening, PedroII wept and complained to Mariana de Verna, [...] "They have deceived me, Dadama!" [...] It took several hours to convince him that duty demanded that he proceed. The Nuptial Mass, with the ratification of the vows previously taken by proxy and the conferral of the nuptial blessing, occurred on the following day, 4 September.|$|E
500|$|McCay {{originally}} used {{a version}} of the film as part of his vaudeville act. [...] The first performance was on February8, 1914, in Chicago at the Palace Theater. [...] McCay began the show making his customary live sketches, which he followed with How a Mosquito Operates. [...] He then appeared on stage with a whip and lectured the audience on the making of animation. [...] Standing {{to the right of the}} film screen, he introduced [...] "the only dinosaur in captivity". [...] As the film started Gertie poked her head out of a cave, and McCay encouraged her to come forward. [...] He reinforced the illusion with tricks such as tossing a cardboard apple at the screen, at which point <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> to the audience and pocketed the apple as it appeared in the film for Gertie to eat. [...] For the finale, McCay walked offstage from where he [...] "reappeared" [...] in the film; Gertie lifted up the animated McCay, placed him on her back, and walked away as McCay bowed to the audience.|$|E

[...] Morrell [...] "paced the beach to and fro like a maniac, with a brace of pistols in his hands, threatening to blow out the brains of the first man who broke open a box.

2500|$|Darius sends {{a secret}} message in ancient runes to MacLeod in Seacouver, Washington {{asking him to}} protect Victor Paulus, another protégé of his, from Grayson. MacLeod tells Richie Ryan (Stan Kirsch) Darius' legend: two {{thousand}} [...] years old, an ancient general and Grayson was his second-in-command. Fifteen hundred years ago, Darius could have led his armies across Europe and ruled for a thousand years, but he turned his armies back to become a peacemaker and Grayson felt betrayed. MacLeod then recounts, [...] "The legend has it Darius killed a holy man {{at the gates of}} Paris. The oldest living Immortal at that time. And suddenly he changed. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> on war." [...] Richie rationalizes that the holy man's Quickening went to Darius and made him benevolent, the only known example of a Light Quickening. However, a deleted line from the script has MacLeod say: [...] "Maybe what the Old One told him finally made sense to Darius", suggesting an intellectual realization of the horrors of war rather than the overwhelming positive power of the holy man's Quickening.|$|E
2500|$|José María Jesús Carbajal (1809–1874) (also spelled Carvajal, Caravajal, Carabajal and Carbahal) was a Mexican freedom fighter, {{who opposed}} the Centralist {{government}} installed by Antonio López de Santa Anna. Carbajal was a direct descendant of Canary Islands settlers who immigrated to San Antonio, Texas in the 18th Century. As a teenager in San Antonio, he was mentored by Stephen F. Austin, and came under the spiritual guidance of Alexander Campbell while attending school in Virginia. He was a surveyor by trade, and a politician {{as a result of}} historical events. Carbajal married into the influential De Leon family of Victoria, Texas. He called himself [...] "a true Mexican" [...] whose allegiance lay with the people of Mexico. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> on the Republic of Texas and moved to Mexico, where he conducted guerrilla warfare against its military forces. Carbajal was active in the establishment of the Republic of the Rio Grande, and made an unsuccessful attempt at establishing the break-away Republic of Sierra Madre. [...] Indicted twice in the United States for his activities, Carbajal was never convicted in a court of law. He was an early supporter of Benito Juárez, and was appointed military governor of Tamaulipas.|$|E
2500|$|According to Long, Akan or [...] "Coromantee" [...] culture obliterated {{any other}} African customs and {{incoming}} non-Akan Africans had {{to submit to}} the culture of the majority Akan population in Jamaica. Akan deities referred to as Abosom in the Twi language were documented, and enslaved Akans would praise Nyankopong (erroneously written by the British as Accompong); libations would be poured to Asase Yaa (erroneously written as [...] "Assarci") and Epo the sea god. Bonsam was referred to as the god of evil. The John Canoe festival was created in Jamaica and the Caribbean by enslaved Akan that sided with the man known as John Canoe. John Canoe was a man from Axim, Ghana he was an Akan from the Ahanta. He was a soldier for the Germans, until one day <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> on them for his Ahanta people and sided with Nzima and Asante troops, in order to take the area from the Germans and other Europeans. The news of his victory reached Jamaica and he was celebrated ever since that Christmas of 1708 he had first defeated German forces for Axim. Twenty years later his stronghold was broken by neighbouring Fante forces aided by the military might of the British. This resulted in the Ahanta, Nzima and Asante warriors becoming captives and being taken to Jamaica as prisoners of war, numbering some 20,000 men.|$|E

2500|$|After having {{reduced the}} lead to a slow margin, Australia were faced with a pitch which had {{deteriorated}} and made batting increasingly difficult. So as to ensure a healthy first-innings lead, the Australian batsmen switched gears quickly from aggressive to defensive. The Indian bowlers were rewarded with Martyn's wicket in the fourth ball of the 92nd over, by which time Australia had already gained a lead of 13. At {{the end of the}} first session, Australia added 79 runs for the loss of Martyn's wicket. The second session saw some more circumspect batting, as Australia added 84 runs from the 28 overs [...] bowled in that period, but for the loss of Simon Katich's wicket. The highlight of the second session was Ponting's double hundred, which was crafted from 368 with a neat single off Ashish Nehra's bowling. His double hundred was described as being [...] "magnificent" [...] by S Rajesh, noted Cricinfo statistician, [...] "for its complete mastery over the Indian bowlers". Ponting was also dominant as he neared his double century, singling out Kumble for some punishment. His knock also continued his excellent form in the year 2003, in which he had already notched up an average excess of 100, in tests. Another incident, a setback for Australia briefly, was Steve Waugh's decision to retire after being hurt. Waugh came out to bat with a standing ovation, but the second ball he faced, from Agarkar, was a short one to which <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> <b>back,</b> turning his head towards third slip. The ball hit him on his elbow, and after a quick examination from the physio, he decided to go off. The last session, though, made the difference, as Australia added 88 runs for 6 wickets, of which, Anil Kumble took three. After Waugh retired hurt, Simon Katich came in and hung around, adding 64 runs for the fifth wicket with Ponting. But he was soon out to Kumble(437/5). Steve Waugh returned at this stage, wearing an arm-guard over his hand, but he looked far from comfortable in his 19-run knock. He padded up once too many times to Kumble, which turned out to be his downfall, as he lost his wicket that way(502/6). Then Ponting lost the tail as India steadily worked their way through the match, with some perseverance from Kumble. Ponting was soon dismissed off Kumble, at 555/9, after missing an attempted heave down the track, and being stumped. Ponting's 468-ball innings was termed as [...] "restrained" [...] and [...] "mature", and had less aggression or flamboyance compared to his double century at Adelaide. His approach towards batting was similar to that of Rahul Dravid's in Adelaide: he was in command of his shots and the bowlers, so he had to occupy the crease for a long time. An important aspect of Ponting's knock which stood out was his footwork: he scored at a rate of 1.5 off the front-foot, but scored at a pace of 5.4 from the back-foot. He remarkably remained in control for 87% of the balls he faced from other Indian bowlers, except Kumble, against whom he had a relatively low in-control percentage of 81%. Sambit Bal noted that despite being uncomfortable against Ashish Nehra and Ajit Agarkar early on, Ponting played an innings of ambition. He added, ...|$|E
