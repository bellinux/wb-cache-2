60|$|My right honourable {{friend the}} Chancellor of the Exchequer {{has told the}} Conference with perfect truth--in fact {{it may have been}} even an under-estimate--that if he were to propose the {{principle}} of preference in the present House of Commons, it would be rejected by a majority of three to one. But even if the present Government could command a majority for the system, they would have no intention whatever of proposing it. It is not because we are not ready to run electoral risks that we decline to be parties to a system of preference; still less is it because the present Government is unwilling to make sacrifices, in money or otherwise, in order to weave the Empire more closely together. I think a very hopeful deflection has been given to our discussion when it is suggested that we may find a more convenient line of advance by <b>improving</b> <b>communications,</b> rather than by erecting tariffs--by making roads, as it were, across the Empire, rather than by building walls. It is because we believe the principle of preference is positively injurious to the British Empire, and would create, not union, but discord, that we have resisted the proposal.|$|E
