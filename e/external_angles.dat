40|$|Abstract. A point z in the Julia set of a {{polynomial}} p {{is called}} biaccessible if two dynamic rays land at z; a point z in the Mandelbrot set is called biaccessible if two parameter rays land at z. In both cases, {{we say that}} the <b>external</b> <b>angles</b> of these two rays are biaccessible as well. In this paper we give {{upper and lower bounds}} for the Hausdorff dimension of biac-cessible <b>external</b> <b>angles</b> of quadratic polynomials, both in the dynamical and param-eter space. We explicitly describe those quadratic polynomials where this dimension equals 1 (if and only if the Julia set is an interval), and when it equals 0, namely, at finite direct bifurcations from the polynomial z 2, as well as limit points thereof. We also show that the Hausdorff dimension of biaccessible dynamical angles de-pends in a Hölder sense on the parameter angle, and that this dimension, up to a factor log 2, equals the core entropy, i. e., the topological entropy of the dynamics of the Hubbard tree. 1...|$|E
