25|$|White {{phosphorus}} {{was first}} made commercially in the 19th century for the match industry. This used bone ash for a phosphate source, as described above. The bone-ash process became obsolete when the submerged-arc furnace for phosphorus production {{was introduced to}} reduce phosphate rock. The electric furnace method allowed production to increase {{to the point where}} phosphorus could be used in weapons of war. In World War I it was used in incendiaries, smoke screens and tracer bullets. A special <b>incendiary</b> <b>bullet</b> was developed to shoot at hydrogen-filled Zeppelins over Britain (hydrogen being highly flammable). During World War II, Molotov cocktails made of phosphorus dissolved in petrol were distributed in Britain to specially selected civilians within the British resistance operation, for defence; and phosphorus incendiary bombs were used in war on a large scale. Burning phosphorus is difficult to extinguish and if it splashes onto human skin it has horrific effects.|$|E

50|$|On {{his last}} mission, 14 October, Coppens downed a balloon over Praatbos and was attacking one over Torhout {{when he was}} {{severely}} wounded by an <b>incendiary</b> <b>bullet,</b> smashing the tibia of his left leg and severing the artery. Coppens crash landed near Diksmuide and was taken to hospital, where his leg was amputated.|$|E
5000|$|Exploding: Similar to the <b>incendiary</b> <b>bullet,</b> {{this type}} of {{projectile}} is designed to explode upon hitting a hard surface, preferably the bone of the intended target. Not to be mistaken for cannon shells or grenades with fuse devices, these bullets have only a cavity filled {{with a small amount}} of low explosive depending on the velocity and deformation upon impact to detonate. Exploding bullets have been used on various aircraft machine guns and on anti materiel rifles.|$|E

50|$|Aerial defences against Zeppelins were haphazard, {{and divided}} between the RNAS and the Royal Flying Corps (RFC), with the Navy {{engaging}} enemy airships approaching the coast while the RFC took responsibility once the enemy had crossed the coastline. Initially the War Office believed that the Zeppelins used a layer of inert gas {{to protect themselves from}} <b>incendiary</b> <b>bullets,</b> and discouraged the use of such ammunition in favour of bombs. The initial trials of <b>incendiary</b> <b>bullets</b> in mid-1915 were unimpressive, and the explosive round developed by John Pomeroy attracted little official interest. However experiments undertaken in 1916 using a mixture of explosive and incendiary rounds were promising, and the use of this mixture brought the defending aircraft their first victories, using the technique of firing upwards at 45 degrees into the airship.|$|R
50|$|When the {{building}} was occupied by Soviet forces during the Apocalypse War of 2104, Judge Dredd used the tunnel to enter and exit {{the building}} on a covert mission. During his escape he was detected by the enemy {{and was forced to}} use <b>incendiary</b> <b>bullets</b> to cover his retreat. The fire took hold and spread, consuming the whole building.|$|R
50|$|Traill scored eight aerial victories. In the process, he {{had three}} other aces serve as his gunner/{{observer}} at various times. While in combat on 2 July 1918, Percy Griffith Jones called out a warning from the plane's rear seat and Traill ducked. The German fighter behind them killed Jones and put a bullet through the cockpit and out the windscreen, missing Traill. Traill's next observer took an <b>incendiary</b> <b>bullet</b> in his leg. Leslie William Burbidge then became Traill's observer.|$|E
5000|$|One {{fighter pilot}} {{who was shot}} down by {{incendiary}} ammunition while flying in the Battle of Britain describes his experience: [...] "I could smell powder smoke, hot and strong, but it didn't make me feel tough this time. It was from the cannon shells and incendiary bullets that had hit my machine...Bullets were going between my legs, and I remember seeing a bright flash of an <b>incendiary</b> <b>bullet</b> going past my leg into the gas tank...Then a little red tongue licked out inquiringly from under the gas tank {{in front of my}} feet and became a hot little bonfire {{in one corner of the}} cockpit." ...|$|E
50|$|Lewis {{was posted}} to No. 20 Squadron RFC, flying the F.E.2d {{two-seater}} fighter. He gained his first aerial victory on 29 April 1917, by destroying an Albatros D.III over Kortrijk-Ypres, piloted by Second Lieutenant E. J. Smart.For his next two victories he flew with Captain Hugh G. White, driving down another D.III over Zandvoorde on 23 May, and an Albatros D.V over Comines-Quesnoy on the 26th. On 5 June, piloted by Lieutenant Harold L. Satchell, Lewis shot down an Albatros D.V over Becelaère-Zandvoorde. The pilot, Karl Emil Schäfer, commander of Jagdstaffel 28, was killed. On {{the afternoon of}} 27 July, with pilot Second Lieutenant G. T. Burkett, Lewis destroyed two more D.Vs over Menen, but was severely wounded by an <b>incendiary</b> <b>bullet.</b> His leg was later amputated.|$|E
50|$|During World War II, <b>incendiary</b> <b>bullets</b> {{found a new}} use: {{they became}} one of the {{preferred}} types of ammunition for use in interceptor fighters. They were not nearly as effective at puncturing enemy bomber aircraft as armor-piercing bullets, but were far more effective than standard bullets because they could also ignite fuel if they came into contact with a fuel tank or pipeline.|$|R

50|$|On 15 July, an {{unexpected}} hazard {{caught up with}} Friedrichs. His aircraft caught fire in midair. It seems most probable that the <b>incendiary</b> <b>bullets</b> loaded on his airplane spontaneously ignited and set his Fokker D.VII on fire. Friedrichs parachuted out of the conflagration, but the parachute's harness and lines entangled in the plane's tail and Friedrichs fell to his death.|$|R

5000|$|Belgian {{inventor}} de Wilde, who {{was living}} in Switzerland, invented a new bullet in 1938. In December of that year the British Air Ministry purchased the design. However, as the bullet {{had to be made}} by hand rather than mass-produced, Major C. Aubrey Dixon of the British Royal Arsenal at Woolwich developed a greatly improved bullet with similar incendiary capabilities. This was adopted by British forces as the 0.303 Incendiary B Mark VI. For security reasons, and to confuse the enemy, it was initially called 'de Wilde' ammunition, even though the design was almost entirely different from the original version. The B Mark VI <b>incendiary</b> <b>bullet</b> was packed with nitrocellulose, and a small steel ball was placed in the tip of the bullet to ensure that the chemical exploded on impact. As opposed to earlier designs, the B Mark VI was a true incendiary rather than tracer ammunition. The B Mark VI incendiary bullets were first issued in June 1940 and tested operationally in the Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire in the air battles over Dunkirk. The explosive power, coupled with the flash on impact which guided their aim, was much appreciated by pilots. The bullets were at first scarce, and as a result, a mix of ball, AP, Mk IV incendiary tracer and Mk VI incendiary were used until production increased to sufficient levels. By 1942 the standard loading for fixed [...]303s was half loaded with AP and half with incendiary bullets.|$|E
5000|$|... ("observation") — The German Luftwaffe 10.85 g B (Beobachtung—"observation") high-explosive {{incendiary}} ball bullets contained phosphorus and [...] "had a pellet in it which {{exploded on}} contact with any target, however frail". The projectile featured an internal floating firing pin mechanism that automatically armed during firing and detonates a small capsule of tetryl {{which in turn}} ignites the white phosphorus in {{the nose of the}} projectile during sudden deceleration producing a clearly observable amount of flash and smoke. It had a muzzle velocity of 800 m/s and an operating pressure of [...] The B bullet was like any other high-explosive or <b>incendiary</b> <b>bullet,</b> illegal for anti-personnel use according to the Hague Conventions. [...] "The Germans maintained that it was used mainly for observation and range-finding, but observers report having seen them in rifle clips and machine gun belts". The regular German infantry units were not allowed to use this round; however German snipers on the Eastern Front were permitted by Adolf Hilter in February 1945 to use these rounds that caused horrendous wounds as the projectiles tended to detonate after 100 to 130 mm penetration in human tissue. Karabiner 98k service rifles handled these cartridges without issues. This cartridge can be recognised by the black primer sealant, yellow bullet. This ammunition was also produced in a B-v high-velocity or [...] "v" [...] ammunition variant that added 110 m/s muzzle velocity to the normal B variant.|$|E
50|$|Hydrogen-filled {{balloons}} {{were widely}} used during World War I (1914-1918) to detect enemy troop movements and to direct artillery fire. Observers phoned their reports to {{officers on the}} ground who then relayed the information to those who needed it. Balloons were frequently targets of opposing aircraft. Planes assigned to attack enemy balloons were often equipped with <b>incendiary</b> <b>bullets,</b> {{for the purpose of}} igniting the hydrogen.|$|R
25|$|Anti-aircraft {{artillery}} defenses {{were increasingly}} used around observation balloons, which became frequent targets of enemy fighters equipped with special <b>incendiary</b> <b>bullets.</b> Because balloons were so flammable, {{due to the}} hydrogen used to inflate them, observers were given parachutes, enabling them to jump to safety. Ironically, only a few aircrew had this option, {{due in part to}} a mistaken belief they inhibited aggressiveness, and in part to their significant weight.|$|R

50|$|Amongst {{users of}} the rockets were France, United Kingdom, Belgium, and Germany. After planes became {{equipped}} with tracer rounds and <b>incendiary</b> <b>bullets</b> which were highly effective against hydrogen filled aerostats, the rockets were gradually abandoned through 1918. Aircraft that were armed with the rockets included the Nieuport 11/16/17, SPAD 7/13, Sopwith Baby/Pup/Camel, Farman HF.20/21, and the B.E.2/B.E.12. They were usually armed with eight rockets but the SPAD 7 carried six and the B.E.12 had ten.|$|R

5000|$|The {{first time}} {{incendiary}} ammunition was widely used was in World War I. At the time, phosphorus {{was the primary}} ingredient in the incendiary charge and ignited upon firing, {{leaving a trail of}} blue smoke. These early forms were also known as [...] "smoke tracers" [...] because of this. Though deadly, the effective range of these bullets was only 350 yards (320 m), as the phosphorus charge burned quickly. <b>Incendiary</b> <b>bullets</b> called [...] "Buckingham" [...] ammunition were supplied to early British night fighters for use against military zeppelins threatening the British Isles. The flammable hydrogen gas of the zeppelins made <b>incendiary</b> <b>bullets</b> much more deadly than standard ones which would pass through the outer skin without igniting the gas. Similarly, incendiary ammunition was used against non-rigid observation balloons. The British Royal Flying Corps forbade the use of incendiary ammunition for air-to-air combat with another airplane, as their use against personnel was at first considered to be a violation of the St. Petersburg Declaration. Pilots were permitted to deploy them against only zeppelins and balloons, and they were additionally restricted to shooting the gas chamber itself rather than the crew. Furthermore, they were required to carry written orders on their person when engaging these targets.|$|R
25|$|These rounds were {{extensively}} {{developed over}} the years and saw several Mark numbers. The last tracer round introduced into British service was the G Mark 8 in 1945, the last armour-piercing round was the W Mark 1Z in 1945 and the last incendiary round was the B Mark 7 in 1942. Explosive bullets were not produced in the UK after 1933 due to the relatively small amount of explosive that could be contained in the bullet, limiting their effectiveness, their role being taken by the use of Mark 6 and 7 <b>incendiary</b> <b>bullets.</b>|$|R

A wide range of ammunition types were used for the machine pistols, including <b>incendiary</b> <b>bullets</b> that smash on contact, coating the target with a high-temperature paste-fed fire, high explosive bullets able to uproot trees, ordinary lead bullets, and the sleep-inducing [...] "mercy bullets".|$|R
