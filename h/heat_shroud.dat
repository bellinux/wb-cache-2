5000|$|M240B is a modernized {{derivative}} of the M240G, {{which features a}} perforated hand-guard and <b>heat</b> <b>shroud,</b> a MIL-STD-1913 rail integral with the receiver top cover, which {{enables the use of}} optical day and night sights, a new synthetic stock and a new ammunition container. It was selected to be the U.S. Army's new medium machine gun on December 1, 1995, replacing the M60 machine gun - it defeated the M60E4 during trials. M240Bs are also replacing M240Gs in USMC service. The M240B weighs 12.5 kg and has a length of 1245 mm. The rate of fire is 650-750 rounds/min.|$|E
50|$|The Ameli is {{fitted with}} a molded polymer stock, bipod and iron sights that consist of a forward post and a rear {{aperture}} sight contained in the carry handle assembly with 300, 600, 800 and 1,000 m range settings. The weapon's design makes extensive use of sheet metal stampings; both the receiver, barrel shroud and trigger housing are fabricated from steel pressings and then welded. The quick-detach bipod has a height adjustment feature and is mounted to the perforated barrel <b>heat</b> <b>shroud</b> at the muzzle end. The light machine gun can be deployed with the bipod, on a vehicle mount or on a static tripod mount.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{is to focus on}} an {{application}} of mixed flow turbine wheel for charging diesel powered combustion engine in a van and to give a summary about current technologies used for charging internal combustion engines. Output of this thesis should be a package study with a few design layouts for the application mentioned above, including models prepared for rapid prototyping.

5000|$|Decoys: Decoys {{consist of}} {{balloons}} {{that can be}} inflated in space and are designed {{to have the same}} radar characteristics as the warhead. Because the warhead and the decoy balloons may be at different temperatures, the warhead and the balloons may both be surrounded by <b>heated</b> <b>shrouds</b> that put them all at the same temperature. This defeats attempts to discriminate between decoys and warheads on the basis of temperature, which can confuse an enemy's missile defense systems.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of the {{presence}} of unheated and <b>heated</b> <b>shrouds</b> on the thermal performance of longitudinal finned heat sinks. A comprehensive numerical study was conducted to determine the impact of the shroud clearance from the tip of the fins and <b>shroud</b> <b>heating.</b> The first part of the study deals with {{the effects of}} an unheated <b>shroud</b> on finned <b>heat</b> sinks of different fin height, fin pitch and length in an attempt to cover a wide range of geometry. The numerical results reveal an optimum clearance for maximum heat transfer. For all heat sinks studied the unheated shroud improved the performance by as much as 15 % until the shroud was very close when the performance decreased by as much as 10 %. In {{the second part of the}} paper, the effects of <b>heating</b> of the <b>shroud</b> were considered. In these numerical runs, an isothermal boundary condition was imposed on the <b>shroud.</b> For the <b>heating</b> levels considered, it was found that <b>heating</b> of the <b>shrouds</b> can increase or lower the thermal performance of the heat sink depending on the heat sink geometry and shroud clearance. Finally, the numerical results also revealed a systematic dependence of the normalized Nusselt number on the Rayleigh number for a given heat sink geometry...|$|R

The storage device consists of an insulated cylinder containing Thermkeep in which coiled tubular heat exchangers are immersed. A one-tenth scale model of the design contains 25 heat-exchanger tubes and 1500 kg of Thermkeep. Its instrumentation includes thermocouples to measure internal Thermkeep temperatures, vessel surface, <b>heated</b> <b>shroud</b> surface, and pressure gauges to indicate heat-exchanger pressure drops.

Areas of large heat transfer rates are identified and physical reasoning for the phenomena presented...|$|R
40|$|The {{second in}} a planned series of heated {{jettison}} tests on the Centaur Standard Shroud was conducted on January 16, 1974. The first 250 -second portion of the test sequence involved <b>heating</b> the <b>shroud</b> with a specially-built fixture {{designed to provide a}} simulation of the heating environment encountered by the shroud during its ascent through the earth's atmosphere. The two heater halves, which were mounted on a rail system, were then retracted. This was followed by the jettison of the two shroud halves into catch nets positioned at 90 deg to the heater rails. The condition which made this test unique compared to the others in the test series was the alignment of the maximum thermal line with the shroud separation plane. Information on the test hardware, configuration, and sequence is presented. Shroud thermal and deflection data encountered during the heating portion of the test sequence are compared with free-skin design temperatures in various graphical formats...|$|R

40|$|Convective <b>heat</b> {{transfer}} to <b>shrouded</b> cylinders in transverse flow {{has been studied}} over the Reynolds number range 2000 - 20, 000. The influence of shroud ventilation, relative shroud diameters, and orientation of the ventilation holes was studied. In some cases, average inner-cylinder Nusselt numbers were found to exceed the comparable bare-cylinder values {{by as much as}} 50 percent. Cylinder heat convection was influenced more by the degree of ventilation and shroud diameter than by hole orientation. An equivalent inner bare cylinder diameter, based on degree of shroud ventilation and shroud diameter, was developed which can be useful in shroud design studies...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} apparatus for {{the investigation}} of the flow-assisted dissolution and precipitation (corrosion) of potential fuel cladding and structural materials to be used in liquid lead alloy cooled reactors has been designed. This experimental project {{is part of a larger}} research effort between Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) and Massachusetts Institute of Technology to investigate the suitability of lead, lead-bismuth, and other lead alloys for cooling fast reactors designed to produce low-cost electricity as well as for actinide burning. The INEEL forced convection corrosion cell consists of a small heated vessel with a shroud and gas flow system. The gas flow rates, <b>heat</b> input, and <b>shroud</b> and vessel dimensions have been adjusted so that a controlled coolant flow rate, temperature, and oxygen potential are created within the downcomer located between the shroud and vessel wall.

S. to temperatures above 650 oC...|$|R
40|$|Technological {{developments}} {{in the area of}} high power LED light sources have enabled their utilization in general illumination applications. Along with this advancement comes the need for progressive thermal management strategies in order to ensure device performance and reliability. 		 Minimizing an LED's junction temperature is done by minimizing the total system's thermal resistance. For actively cooled systems, this may essentially be achieved by simultaneously engineering the conduction through the heat sink and creating a well-designed flow pattern over suitable convective surface area. While such systems are routinely used in cooling microelectronics, their use in LED lighting systems encounter additional constraints which must be accounted for {{in the design of the}} cooling system. These are typically driven by the size, shape, and building codes involved with the lighting industry, and thus influence the design of drop-in replacement LED fixtures. Employing LED systems for customary down-lighting applications may require <b>shrouded</b> radial fin <b>heat</b> sinks to increase the heat transfer while reducing the space requirement for active cooling. 		 Most lighting is already in some form of housing, and the ability to concurrently optimize these housings for thermal and optical performance could accelerate the widespread implementation of cost-efficient, environmentally-friendly solid-state lighting. In response, this research investigated the use of conical, cylindrical, square, and pyramidal shrouds with pin/radial fin heat sink designs for the thermal management of high power LED sources. Numerical simulations using FLUENT were executed in order to account for details of the air flow, pressure drop, and pumping power, as well as the heat transfer and temperature distributions throughout the system. The LEDs were modeled as a distributed heat source of 25 - 75 W on a central portion of the various heat sinks. Combinations of device junction temperature and pumping power were used to assess the performance of <b>shrouded</b> <b>heat</b> sink designs for their use in air-cooled, down-lighting LED fixtures.

40|$|The present work {{reports on}} the {{recently}} completed infrared thermal balance/thermal vacuum testing of a MSAT satellite, the first satellite to provide mobile communications service for all of continental North America. MSAT is a two spacecraft program, using a three-axis stabilized Hughes HS- 601 series Bus as the vehicle for the Canadian designed Payload. The thermal tests which were performed at the Canadian Space Agency's David Florida Laboratory in Ottawa, Canada, lasted approximately 35 days. The infrared (IR) heating rig was designed to provide radiant heat inputs into seven spacecraft zones during Thermal Vacuum (TV) testing. The TV test was divided into multiple phases. It began with a thermal balance cold phase, followed by a thermal cold cycle and a hot balance phase, complemented by a thermal hot cycle to finish with a thermal cycle with continuous monitoring of the Bus and Payload. The spacecraft's external heat fluxes were provided by IR lamp sources. To ensure flux uniformity, highly reflective baffles and IR East and West faces; the Earth facing (Nadir); and {{the inside of the}} thrust cylinder. The aft-end panel heat fluxes were provided by a <b>heated</b> LN 2 <b>shroud.</b> The radiation flux intensity on the spacecraft zones from the various rig elements was measured using Monitored Background Radiometers (MBR's) and compared with direct calculations and with pretest predictions. The temperature measurement system was based on Uniform Temperature References (UTR's) located inside the chamber such that all feedthroughs were copper-copper. This system was devised to achieve a temperature measurement accuracy of plus/minus 0. 5 C for over 850 thermocouples used in the test. A PC-(QNX-based) based real-time data acquisition system was utilized to provide continuous monitoring of all channels based on a 30 -second time scan. In addition, the data acquisition system was able to retrieve telemetry stream from the Satellite Test Equipments (STE) station for real-time data manipulation. Preliminary results showed the test to be successful from both the thermal balance side and the electrical testing side...|$|R
