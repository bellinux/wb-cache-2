Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their book}} Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode five stars out of five, calling it [...] "extremely well-performed by all concerned." [...] Shearman and Pearson felt that the episode {{was similar to the}} earlier [...] "Per Manum" [...] and was somewhat formulaic; however, they noted that this was a necessary and positive step towards redefining the series after the changes made in its last two seasons explaining [...] "the point of all this is only to emphasise how different The X-Files universe now feels, the familiarity of the ingredients only making us more aware that the mix <b>is</b> <b>never</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be the same again". Writing for Television Without Pity, Jessica Morgan rated the episode a [...] "B", although she felt that by this stage the series' mythology was moving [...] "in concentric circles of pain and confusion".|$|E
500|$|... "Nunca Voy a Olvidarte" [...] {{was written}} by Mexican {{songwriter}} Roberto Belester for Bronco's album Salvaje y Tierno (1991). Belester composed songs for several well-known Mexican bands such as Los Yonic's and Los Bukis. The song tells of a protagonist who is leaving his lover and tells her that he <b>is</b> <b>never</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> forget her. In 1993, Mexican singer-songwriter Cristian Castro covered the song on his second studio album, Un Segundo en el Tiempo, which was produced by Alex Zepeda and released as the lead single from the album. According to Castro, he bought Salvaje y Tierno after hearing [...] "Que No Quede Huella" [...] {{on the radio and}} wanted to cover [...] "Nunca Voy a Olvidarte" [...] when he listened to it on the CD. [...] The music video for Castro's cover was produced by Jorge Guerrero Fox Garza and filmed in Cuernavaca which features shots of Castro alone in an old country house near the fireplace and outside on the field remembering a woman he loved.|$|E

[...] Scott said, [...] "I got the crew together and said, 'Okay guys, here we go. This {{is going to be}} a lot more vampy and fun,' and cranked up the ghetto blaster with rock music and away we went." [...] Because of the subject, Scott was able to increase the episode's level of sexual content. [...] Scott said, [...] "we did two takes that were on the edge of tasteful vampire sexuality, and we did a third take where Lucy really let loose. Of course, we all died laughing and said, 'Okay, that one <b>is</b> <b>never</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> make it to the screen'; we definitely pushed it too far!"

2500|$|The first quatrain of the sonnet {{lets the}} reader know the poet has been [...] "infected", in a sense, by his mistress. Though {{the idea of}} being [...] "love-sick" [...] has been often {{idealized}} and romanticized in modern culture, the way the poet describes his lustfulness and want leads to a more dark reading, almost as if he is a host to some sort of sickly desired parasite feeding on his sense and reason. The poet begins the sonnet by linking and treating love and disease as parallel and intricately linked concepts. The poet's mistress has planted a sickly fever within the poet, being a type of bodily love and desire, which is causing an illness within him. His love/lust and wantonness is weakening him to the point where his lust has perhaps taken on its own sort of force and being, much as a fever does, and is now occupying a space in his body. There also appears a never ending cycle, within the first two lines. Carl Atkins points out that , [...] "In this author longing still For that which longer nurseth the disease' is not idle wordplay, but suggests the patient's sense that this condition <b>is</b> <b>never</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> end". It is also {{important to note that the}} idea that the poet would [...] "feed" [...] his fever would have been quite contrary in Elizabethan England, as the going knowledge at the time was to never feed a fever, based on the Four Humours medical belief. The common idiom and medical belief of the times was to [...] "feed a cold, starve a fever".|$|E
2500|$|Puciato later {{commented on}} the act saying; “It was {{early in the day}} and as most people, you kind of get that out of the way early in the day but I never did.

There was no way in hell that I thought that we were ever going make a living doing this or that in fourteen years I would still be having a conversation as Greg from Dillinger Escape Plan. I just thought this was a ball of fire that’s gonna implode or it’s got a shelf life, there’s no way this can continue. So when we would get asked to play something like that in my head I was like ‘well, this <b>is</b> <b>never</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen again, when am I ever going to play a festival with bands I don’t like. That was kind of the other thing, {{that was the first time}} we ever played with bands we don’t like. Up until then it was like you go on tour with bands you feel a kinship with and we had never been exposed to some like mass thing where you’re playing with a band like Puddle of Mudd or whoever it was at the time who made me feel like [...] "Oh I got to make some kind of a statement." [...] So it was kind of a combo of kind of wanting to cause the biggest ruckus imaginable, since we’re obviously never going to do this again anyway, I might as well make sure that we’re never allowed to do this again anyway. And then just kind of making a statement in a way that I felt would be unavoidable for people to pay attention to.” ...|$|E

That is, and always has been, their career; and, what is more, they know it; and even at college, while they are {{studying}} algebra and political economy, they have their eye on it sideways all the time. The plain fact is that, after a girl has spent four years of her time {{and a great deal of}} her parents' money in equipping herself for a career that she <b>is</b> <b>never</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have, the wretched creature goes and gets married, and in a few years she has forgotten which is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle, and she doesn't care.

6000|$|At {{this point}} some one will shriek: [...] "But surely, even for marriage, isn't it right {{that a girl}} should have a college education?"

But the point is this: Does the higher education that fits a man to be a lawyer also fit a person to be a wife and mother? Or, in other words, is a lawyer a wife and mother? I say he is not. Granted that a girl is to spend four years in time and four thousand dollars in money in going to college, why train her for a career that she <b>is</b> <b>never</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> adopt?

If you even {{go so far as to}} say that the very existence of this super-genteel society among us, from the slavish respect that we pay to it, from the dastardly manner in which we attempt to imitate its airs and ape its vices, goes far to destroy honesty of intercourse, to make us meanly ashamed of our natural affections and honest, harmless usages, and so does a great deal more harm than it is possible it can do good by its example--perhaps, Madam, you speak with some sort of reason.
