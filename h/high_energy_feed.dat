We have investigated the potential use of cellulases and xylanases for enhancing the nutritive value of alfalfa for broiler chicks. In the first experiment, a commercial enzyme mixture and 2 recombinant cellulases and xylanases did not improve daily weight gains and feed efficiency of broilers between 35 and 56 d old, although animal performance was significantly depressed in animals supplemented with a recombinant xylanase.

Twenty-four samples of breast muscle, without skin or subcutaneous fat, from two groups of ducks, control and overfed respectively, were collected at 14 weeks of age. We assayed different chemical (water content, crude proteins, total lipid ashes, total and thermosoluble collagen), biochemical (activities of the CS, LDH and β-HAD enzymes), histological (muscle fibre typing and intramuscular adipocyte measurements) and technological (drip and cooking losses, texture) determinations. At the force-feeding period, the overfed ducks weighed 6366 g and the control ducks 4606 g of body weight. In the PM muscle, some modifications of the biochemichal parameters and enzyme activities were observed but neither the shear force nor the histological characteristics of the breast muscle were affected by the fattening treatment. The overfed birds had an increased total lipids content (correlated {{to an increase in}} the intramuscular area occupied by the adipocyte) and a different fatty acid profile {{as the result of a}} <b>higher</b> <b>energy</b> <b>feed</b> intake.

40|$|N,N-{{dimethyl}}glycine (DMG), the dimethyl {{derivative of}} the amino acid glycine, is a naturally occurring intermediary metabolite in the choline to glycine metabolism. The molecule was first reported in 1943 {{and is currently}} used {{for a variety of}} applications, including the enhancement of athletic performances in both man and racing animals. With respect to its biological activities, DMG is for instance suggested to enhance oxygen utilisation and to posses non-enzymatic anti-oxidant properties. The studies described in this thesis aimed to evaluate DMG as a feed additive in chickens for fattening.   In a pilot study, broilers were challenged with both cold stress and a <b>high</b> <b>energy</b> <b>feed</b> in order to incite broiler ascites syndrome. This metabolic disease results from an imbalance between oxygen requirement and supply, and is an important cause of financial losses and a major welfare issue in the modern broiler industry. A low dosage of dietary DMG effectively attenuated progression towards ascites. We hypothesize that this effect results from reduction in endothelial damage and dysfunction caused by plasma free fatty acids, which were substantially lowered by DMG supplementation. Furthermore, DMG improved nutrient digestibility and reduced nitrogen emission, which can be attributed to an emulsifying effect of DMG at the gut level. A subsequent trial revealed dose-dependent effects of dietary DMG on technical performance, carcass yield, oxidative stress parameters and broiler ascites syndrome. However, the nature and magnitude of the effects depended on fatty acid profile of the basal ration. Herein, effects were most pronounced when fed a diet rich in poly-unsaturated fatty acids. Generally, effects showed a linear relationship with dose, except for progression towards broiler ascites syndrome, which showed a quadratic relationship with dietary DMG content. Next, a series of efficacy trials were performed on farms at different European locations, using broiler strains and rearing conditions common to each region. Basal flock efficiency showed a wide range between trials; still, DMG systematically improved broiler performance. Finally, a safety and tolerance trial demonstrated a wide safety range of DMG in the target species. Moreover, DMG did not accumulate in consumer parts of broilers when included in diets at the recommended dosage, and bioaccumulation in meat at tenfold dosage did not exceed DMG content in for instance spinach.   In conclusion, current investigations clearly demonstrate a wide applicability of DMG as a new feed additive in broiler production, in which both economic efficiency and environmental load as well as animal welfare is enhanced without compromising consumer safety.  ...|$|E

40|$|Background- The beef {{industry}} in Australia {{is subject to}} variable pasture availability and quality. This results in numerous growth path possibilities that may influence growth potential and body and carcass composition of cattle and eating quality of beef. Studies of cattle within pasture-based nutritional systems have failed to demonstrate substantial long-term differences in body or carcass characteristics due to prenatal nutrition and growth 1 or nutrition and growth from birth to weaning. 1 - 3 However, severe nutritional restriction from birth to weaning followed by concentrate (<b>high</b> <b>energy)</b> <b>feeding</b> from weaning resulted in increased fatness at the same live and carcass weights compared to cattle well-nourished to weaning. 1 Furthermore, {{the extent to which}} growth early in life interacts with genotype to influence long-term outcomes for growth, carcass and beef quality characteristics of cattle has not been investigated.

40|$|The {{goals of}} a heifer-feeding program are {{to reach a}} target {{freshening}} weight by 24 months of age or less, to improve feed efficiency and reduce costs, and to do this while allowing the animals to express their full genetic potential for milk production. Feed costs remain the single largest expense in raising dairy heifers; therefore, a feed cost reduction that does not sacrifice production improves net income. Feed costs may be reduced {{by the use of}} locally available by-product feeds. Nutritional composition of by-product feeds, however, may vary from the animal’s nutritional requirements, making the incorporation of such feeds into the diets challenging. Growth and nutrient requirements of growing heifers When rearing dairy heifers, one must be cautious of excessive weight gains, which result in over-condition. The National Research Council’s Nutrient Requirement for Dairy Cattle (NRC, 2001) recommends that heifers gain on average 1. 9 lbs per day to attain recommended size at calving at 23 to 24 months of age. Excessive weight gains result in fat deposits in the udder. This reduces milk production in subsequent lactations, and it increases calving difficulty and metabolic disorders. Energy fed in excess of requirements has the greatest impact on body condition. Monitoring growth is thus very important when establishing a feeding program for replacement heifers (Table 1). Varying the nutrient density of the diet regulates growth and weight gain. The inclusion of highly digestible feeds in balanced diets results in more energy available to accelerate growth. A diet that seems adequately balanced “on paper ” may result in decreased weight gains if bunk space is limited. <b>High</b> <b>energy</b> <b>feeds</b> need to be balanced with low-energy feeds. In over-conditioned heifers, dietary energy needs to be limited, either by restricting the amount of feed offered or by adding low-energy feeds such as crop residues (straw and corn stalks) to the diet.

40|$|To {{determine}} {{effects of}} different nutritional regimens on beef palatability and collagen characteristics, we randomly assigned 18 Hereford steers of similar age and nutritional background to three treatment groups: group 1 was slaughtered directly off pasture at about 19 to 20 months of age; group 2, composed of animals {{the same age}} as those in group 1, was slaughtered after being fed a <b>high</b> <b>energy</b> diet for 120 days, and group 3, 23 to 24 months of age, was slaughtered after 126 days on a <b>high</b> <b>energy</b> diet. <b>Feeding</b> the <b>high</b> <b>energy</b> diet increased USDA quality and yield grades. Longissimus (LD) steaks from the three groups did not differ in total collagen content, sarcomere length, Warner-Bratzler shear force, cooking loss or sensory panel ratings for tenderness, juiciness and flavor intensity. However, LD samples from group 3 animals had a higher (P<. 05) percentage of salt plus acid soluble collagen and less organoleptically detectable connective tissue than LD samples from group 1. LD samples from group 2 animals had a higher (P<. 05) percentage of salt soluble collagen than those from group 1. Biceps fernoris (BF) steaks from group 1 steers were juicier than those from groups 2 and 3. Feeding regimen did not consistently affect BF collagen solubility, taste panel tenderness or shear force. Beef from grass-finished cattle received acceptable taste panel scores. The effects of the <b>high</b> <b>energy</b> diet on plasma nonprotein hydroxyproline content and live animal weight were monitored in group 3. Plasma nonprotein hydroxyproline content (an indicator of collagen degradation) was highest at approximately 42 days on feed and corresponded well with weight gain. These results suggest that collagen turnover is accelerated during the rapid growth phase of cattle fed a <b>high</b> <b>energy</b> diet...|$|R
40|$|Insects play a {{significant}} role in recycling many forms of waste and other accumulated nutrients in the environment. Attempts to harness the power of insects for manure management have not been particularly successful or widely adopted. Although additional research is needed, the current state of the technology for utilizing the black soldier fly (Hermatia) for processing hen and swine manure appears to make it commercially feasible. Hermetia consume manure and convert the nutrients into larval insect mass, which contains 40 + % protein and 30 + % fat; thus a potential <b>high</b> protein, <b>high</b> <b>energy</b> animal <b>feed.</b> In the process, manure mass is reduced about 50 %, with even greater reductions in N and P mass. Additional environmental benefits occur, and a recent analysis suggests that Hermetia manure management could increase net revenue by $ 25, 000 ! per year per layer house. For all applications, needed improved technology is associated with the adult life cycle and providing eggs throughout the year, and providing a warm environment for the larvae during winter. For conventional swine barn applications, economical methods for removal of excess liquid (urine) are also needed...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this trial}} was to {{evaluate}} the influence of two protein sources and the energy levels of the diet on growth performance and carcass quality of young Marchigiana bulls. Eighteen weaned young bulls (129 d of age) were equally divided into three groups. Until the slaughter weight (620 kg) was achieved two groups were fed diets with the same protein and energy concentrations, but differing in protein sources (faba bean-FB vs soya bean meal s. e. -SB), and the last group was fed high-energy diets (HE) with both protein sources in the concentrates. Body weight, daily weight gain and biological efficiency of growth at different ages and periods, and feed conversion indexes, were calculated from individual growth curves. Beginning at 180 d of age Group HE showed always significantly (P< 0. 01) higher body weight and daily weight gain than groups FB and SB. Moreover, group HE reached the slaughter weight and conformation earlier {{than the other two}} groups (500 vs 540 d, respectively). The protein sources affected the growth only in the first phase after weaning (body weight at 180 d: 173 vs 186 kg for groups FB and SB, respectively; P< 0. 01). The <b>highest</b> <b>energy</b> diets appreciably improved growing rate, but worsened feed conversion indexes. Animal and carcass measurements were not influenced either by energy intake or by dietary protein source. Group HE showed the lowest incidence of long bones (6. 2 vs 6. 7 vs 5. 8 % of cold carcass for FB, SB and HE groups respectively; P< 0. 01) and the highest percentage of fat (5. 1 vs 4. 7 vs 7. 1 % of cold carcass, for FB, SB and HE groups respectively; P< 0. 01). As respects the protein sources, only the incidence of long bones resulted significantly different between FB and SB groups (6. 2 vs 6. 7 % of cold carcass, respectively; P< 0. 05). These data demonstrate that faba beans could be used as alternative sources to soya bean meal s. e., as it did not influence growth rate and feed conversion indexes in the entire experimental period. Nevertheless, immediately after weaning, the association of faba beans with another protein source richer in rumen undegradable protein would be preferable. Moreover the utilisation of <b>high</b> <b>energy</b> <b>feeding</b> planes could improve the growth dynamics of young Marchigiana bulls, although in the final phase it may be suitable to reduce the energy intake in order to decrease fat deposition...|$|R
40|$|IN RECENT years, fats {{have become}} a surplus commodity. Research, di-rected toward finding new uses for fats, has shown that fat is a {{desirable}} ingredi-ent in livestock and poultry rations and as a result, increasing amounts of fats are be-ing used in feeds. Through the use of <b>high</b> <b>energy</b> fats, lower cost rations which give satisfactory growth response and which have better physical characteristics have been de-veloped. It was reported by Scott el al. (1947) that <b>high</b> <b>energy</b> poultry <b>feeds</b> out-perform low <b>energy</b> rations. Siedler and Schweigert (1953) observed that the growth response in New Hampshire chicks on 2, 4 or 8 percent fat (choice white grease) with or without supple-ments of choline or choline plus antibiotics and vitamin B i 2 did not increase rate of gain over that of chicks on the basal ra-tion {{for a period of}} 9 weeks. An increase in rate of gain was noted, however, in White Rock male chicks on these same rations. Rice et al. (1954) reported that growth rate and efficiency of feed utiliza-tion of chicks were improved by including various fats in the ration. Sunde (1954) found that the addition of fats in poultry rations improved the efficiency of feed utilization. In addition to the work cited showing that fats improved growth and feed effici-ency, {{it has been reported that}} the feeding of fats and/or oils has an effect on the stability of the deposited fat, Admundsen et al.

40|$|Adipose tissues disserted from camel, {{lamb and}} beef {{carcasses}} were analysed for total lipids and cholesterol contents {{in order to}} provide information to consumers and health care professionals. Differences were observed between the adipose tissues in term of lipids and cholesterol contents. The adipose tissues contained an average of 80. 22 % of lipids with individual samples ranging from 71. 25 % to 92. 17 %, while cholesterol values ranged from about 135 mg up to 184 mg per 100 g adipose tissues. This range of values, therefore, reflects natural levels. Camel adipose tissues tended to have lower levels of cholesterol than beef and lamb adipose tissues.

40|$|ABSTRACT Three {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} study early growth, feed and water intake, feed efficiency, abdominal fat, and feathering in commercial broilers (C) and unselected (AC) chickens fed high-protein (P) or high-energy (E) diets. Commercial birds were heavier, consumed more feed and water, had better feed efficiency, higher abdominal fat levels, and poorer feather scores than AC birds. Body weights of C birds fed the E diet were, in general, greater than BW of contemporaries fed the P diet. However, AC body weights did not respond in a similar manner. Feed intake patterns {{were similar to those}} for BW. Water intake and water to feed ratio values were consistently greater in both AC and C birds fed the P diet. The C birds had higher percentages of abdominal fat than AC birds, and C birds fed the E diet had higher abdominal fat (89 %) than those fed the P diet; the difference was only 33 % in the AC stock and this resulted in significant (P<. 05) stock by diet interactions. Diet had little influence on feathering in AC birds, whereas C birds that received the E diet had significantly (P<OS) poorer feathering than those that received the P diet.

A previous communica-tion from this laboratory (Waldroup et al., 1970) noted that this material was ac ceptable in <b>high</b> <b>energy</b> broiler <b>feeds</b> at levels up to 15 percent of the diet. A typical analysis of this feedstuff indicates that it contains 31. 5 % crude protein, 2750 M. E.

40|$|The partial {{selection}} of high milk yield in dairy breeding {{led to an}} enormous increase of milk yield {{but a series of}} sanitaryproblems within the dairy cattle stocks, too. Cows with high milk yield show a low level of insulin. Insulin occupies a central position in the metabolic arrangement for milk yield, fertility and metabolism by regulating metabolic arrangements. To counteract this trend in dairy cattle selection, the glucose-tolerance-test ought to determine the individual copability of metabolism regulation and with that to mark the breeding animal´s typ of metabolism. Thereby important additional information for breeding valuation could be determine {{but it is clear that}} the results of the glucose-tolerance-test are influenced by several factors. It exists a need for standartisation of the tests to get to reproducable results for a single animal and a whole group of animals. This experimaental study examines the influences of of feeding, body condition and acute stress on the results of the glucose-tolerance-test under consideration of gender and age. 23 GTT´s have been carried out in a period of six months with six bulls, six oxen and six heifers. The animals were on average age of 9. 2 months in the beginning and 14. 8 months in the end of the tests. The whole period of six months was divided into three perservative phases. Each phase showed a rotation of feeding between food of high energetic potential (4 - 6 kg concentrated feed stuff plus 4 kg hay) and food with a low energy and protein (4 kg hay ad libitum). Addtionally a ratio with <b>high</b> protein and <b>energy</b> content rotated with a ratio of low energy and protein. Hunger, jealousy of food and accustical stress were used to create stress. A weekly determination of back fat thickness, live weight and a GTT was placed. The bull´s glucose half-life is significantly more constant than the glucose half-life of oxen and heifers. The is no significant difference of glucose half-life between oxen and heifers but heifers showed the affinity of shortest glucose half-life. The glucose expanse-equivalent showed no difference between the genders and is therefore not usable for comparison of GTT-results between bulls and heifers. As expected heifers are significantly fatter than bulls and oxen. There are no existing differences of the back fat thickness between bulls and oxen. The energy-supply-level influences the GTT-result significantly. The influence of feeding acts indipendently rectified from gender. Low <b>energy</b> <b>feeding</b> shows significant shorter glucose half-life in comparison to a <b>high</b> <b>energy</b> <b>feeding.</b> The aprupt change of ratio from <b>high</b> to less <b>energy</b> lowered the glucose half-life significantly. With a change from low to to <b>high</b> <b>energy</b> ratios showed a decrease of glucose half-life after a few weeks. Along with this effect goes an excursive increase of the back fat thickness. The way of feeding influences the results of GTT significantly by using the data of body condition. The influence of the body condition on the GTT-results rises with the increase of overconditioning. In this interrelation it is necessary to differ between overconditioning and age-caused adiposis. A high content of protein in the ratio influences the GTT-results, too. Especially a simultanious lack of energy in the ratio leads to a decrease of the basal glucose concentration and an increase of the glucose half-life. An impact on the GTT-results by using acute stress turns out to be different and addicted to the moment of occurence. Thereby an untypical developing of the glucose concentration in GTT can be caused. With bulls the acute stress significantly extent the glucose half-life but with oxen and heifers it significantly decreases. To get reproductable results the animals should be fed well balanced over at least four weeks before starting the test. Withal the body condition of the animals should range between mark 2. 5 and mark 3. 5 of the body-condition-score. Partial ratios and radical change of the ratio need to be avoided...|$|R
