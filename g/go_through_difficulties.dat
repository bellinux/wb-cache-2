40|$|The {{importance}} of passion increases with {{the extent of}} sorrow.

40|$|The {{constructs}} {{of gender and}} culture have been neglected {{in our understanding of}} marital relationships. With the recent upsurge of postmodernism, the two constructs have come into focus as essential to furthering our understanding of these relationships. My doctoral dissertation research is a cross-cultural comparative study of five Hong Kong Chinese immigrant couples in Canada and five Euro Canadian couples who were born in Canada I used a social construction perspective to examine the gender and cultural processes that evolve in the long-term satisfactorily married couples. Couples who have been married for thirty to thirty-six years were under study. I used the Dyadic Adjustment Scale which measured married couples 2 ̆ 7 marital adjustment and satisfaction as a screening instrument to identify the ten couples for in-depth interviews. I adopted an inductive narrative approach to analyse the gender and cultural factors that contribute to long-term marital satisfaction. The narratives of the couples 2 ̆ 7 evolution of their gender relationships reflect the evolving culture embedded in a particular group 2 ̆ 7 s socio-historical context. Through comparison of the two cultural groups, I made the cultural elements more transparent, and in turn, problematised certain gender issues in their socio-historical context. Building upon the existing knowledge of long-term marriages, I conducted an empirical research grounded in a theoretical model which illuminated how cultural contexts and gender role expectations interweave with interpersonal life to create meaning of a satisfactory long-term marital relationship. With the cross-cultural comparisons, I explored the different meanings of marital expectations, marital satisfaction, gender role expectations, and the qualities of sharing, acceptance, and commitment in marriage among the two cultural groups under study. Cultural-specific factors and cross-cultural factors that contributed to satisfactory long-term marriages were discovered from the couples 2 ̆ 7 narratives. Compatibility between the partners in a marital relationship was found to be important for a couple to achieve marital satisfaction. Perceived fairness in the couple 2 ̆ 7 s gender division of labour, efforts to accommodate changes and <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>difficulties,</b> the distribution of decision-making power, willingness to compromise, shared values and activities, and good communication contributed to long-term marital satisfaction. Care and concern, as most of the long-term marriage studies suggest, were more important than satisfaction in sex. A distinctive factor, gender mutuality [...] the reciprocity of each spouse in understanding the other 2 ̆ 7 s gender characteristics [...] was found to contribute to the couples 2 ̆ 7 high level of marital satisfaction. Couples who had high gender mutuality also had a more positive sense of self. My cross-cultural comparative study articulated the complex processes of socio-cultural construction of male and female in each cultural group under study and examined how such forces affected long-term marital satisfaction. My theoretical endeavour was to dislodge the oppositional dichotomy of the dominant Western gender discourses and deconstruct the Western notion as the norm for understanding human behaviours. I explored the different meanings co-constructed by the husband and wife in a marital relationship, under their own socio-cultural contexts, in achieving the couple 2 ̆ 7 s long-term marital satisfaction...|$|E
