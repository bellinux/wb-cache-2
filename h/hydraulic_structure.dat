40|$|Abstract: In this paper, flow around river <b>hydraulic</b> <b>structures</b> {{has been}} {{simulated}} numerically using an efficient coupled 2 DH- 3 D hydrodynamic model. In practical studies, 2 DH numerical models are broadly employed {{to simulate the}} free surface flows; however, application of 3 D models is unavoidable in some cases such as flow around river <b>hydraulic</b> <b>structures,</b> due to the variation of flow characteristics in depth. In this research, a reach of a wide river channel containing some <b>hydraulic</b> <b>structures</b> has been considered. This reach has been simulated by a coupled 2 DH- 3 D system that models the area surrounding the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>structures</b> three dimensionally {{and the rest of}} reach, two dimensionally. The proposed coupled system is a combination of a 2 DH model and a full 3 D one. Solution domains in the 2 DH and 3 D spaces are covered using triangular and prismatic elements, respectively. Both models implement the finite volume fractional step method to discretize the main equations. Comparison of the results of flow modeling around a bridge pier and a spur dike (typical river <b>hydraulic</b> <b>structures),</b> using the 3 D and the coupled models in the same computational domain, with the experimental data shows good precision and considerable efficiency of the proposed coupled model.

40|$|The {{state of}} the art of design of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>structures</b> is {{changing}} rapidly. Although <b>hydraulic</b> <b>structures</b> include a broad spectrum of applications, there is an increasing need for specialization in planning, design, materials, construction, risk and hazard assessment, aging infrastructure, and lifecycle maintenance. Today’s role of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>structures</b> involves improving water management practices, water quality, and environmental restoration and protection. Hydraulic design has expanded to include water planning as well as improvements in the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of locks, dams, spillways, and outlet works. The challenges affecting planning and design involve understanding the role of government policies, economics, optimization, and risk analysis {{for a wide range of}} uses that include flood control, irrigation, power generation, navigation, domestic and municipal supply, environmental, and recreation. Given the enormous problems in water engineering, design of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>structures</b> will remain relevant in the future. Hydraulic structural design is complex. It requires significant coordination of multiple disciplines, three-dimensional analysis, a complex and time-consuming contractual process, and extensive plans and specifications packages. For existing <b>hydraulic</b> <b>structures,</b> the concern for safety and risk evaluation of existing structures is becoming a growing area of need as materials age, hydrologic methods improve, and the technology for evaluations improve. In order for hydraulic design to meet the needs of the future, there needs to be discussion on how to bridge the gap between research and practice, identification of knowledge gaps, providing experience, encouraging continuing education, development of competent data bases, and promoting collaboration with other organizations in the advancement and understanding of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>structures.</b> To accomplish these goals, engineers need to step up as leaders to turn ideas into solutions, to adapt innovation, to influence governments and societies in a meaningful way, to solve the problems of an aging infrastructure through sustainability and resilience, and to meet current environmental needs.

The Parshall flume accelerates flow though a contraction of both the parallel sidewalls and a drop in the floor at the flume throat.

40|$|Gas {{transfer}} at <b>hydraulic</b> <b>structures</b> {{has been}} a topic of interest for many years. Navigation dams on rivers can add {{a large amount of}} atmospheric gases to the water due to the high velocities and the turbulence generated as the water passes through these structures. The increase in air-water gas transfer is due to air entrainment and the formation of bubbles in the flow. Hence, gas transfer at <b>hydraulic</b> <b>structures</b> {{plays an important role in}} the water quality of a river-reservoir system. Measurement of air-water gas transfer at <b>hydraulic</b> <b>structures</b> is a complicated process. Oxygen has, historically, been the measured gas, but concentration levels close to saturation and significant vertical stratification in oxygen concentration in the upstream pool often hinder accurate transfer measurements. The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, The u. s. Geological Survey, and th~ University of Minnesota have been involved in this project to measure gas transfer at <b>hydraulic</b> <b>structures</b> in the Ohio River basin, using in~ situ methane as a tracer in addition to measuring dissolved oxygen. The use of the two volatile chemicals increases the possibility of worthwhile field measurements. This project is conducted in order to evaluate gas transfer characteristics at various <b>hydraulic</b> <b>structures</b> on the Ohio River so that spills through the gates can be optimized. The hydropower producers on the Ohio River may also benefit from this information, as wastage of water from the reservoir to meet water quality requirements will be minimized. The results show that gas transfer increases significantly when a hydraulic jump forms in the stilling basin at gated sill structures, which is the type most commonly seen on the Ohio River. It is also clear that gas transfer at <b>hydraulic</b> <b>structures</b> is significantly affected by the structural characteristics and the hydraulic action at each site.

The rate of construction of new water projects in Europe and North America has dropped {{during the last few}} decades, and many of the original water harvesting system mega projects are now near, or even past, their original intended design lives. The question therefore arises whether the existing systems are redundant relics from the past that have reached their sell-by date, or do they still have an important role to play in modern society? The high level of activity, even at a junior engineer and researcher level, in scientific meetings on <b>hydraulic</b> <b>structures</b> demonstrates that water harvesting systems are highly relevant to modern day needs. In these proceedings, the topics presented are driven by an urgent demand for practical solutions to real-world problems involving design, construction, maintenance and operation of systems for water management and water harvesting. It is clear that the demands on <b>hydraulic</b> <b>structures</b> are now imposed by a wide range of stakeholders, and the papers contained herein cover applications including flood protection, stormwater management, navigation, industrial water consumption, infrastructure, and energy dissipation. The IJREWHS 2 ̆ 710 workshop addressed both conventional and innovative aspects of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>structures,</b> their design, operation, rehabilitation and interactions with the environment. The workshop provided an opportunity for young researchers and engineers, typically post-graduate students, but also young researchers and engineers in both public and private sectors, to present ideas, plans, and preliminary results of their own research in an inspiring, friendly, co-operative, and non-competitive environment. The proceedings contain 15 papers including a keynote lecture paper involving 37 authors from 6 countries and 2 continents, plus 6 session reports and 9 pages of photographs of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>structures</b> from around the world, in addition to the photographs of the workshop and of the technical visit. Each paper was peer-reviewed by a minimum of two experts. The proceedings regroup a keynote lecture paper on the hydraulic jump flow phenomenon, 8 technical papers dealing with the design of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>structures</b> and their physical modelling, 3 papers discussing the interactions between sediment processes and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>structures,</b> and 3 papers related to the numerical modelling of open channel flows. These are followed by 6 discussions reports. Innovative designs for overflow weirs are presented in two papers. An improved understanding of performance of existing <b>hydraulic</b> <b>structures</b> is discussed in several papers on flow characteristics and hydrodynamics along and downstream of spillways. The requirement for water in industrial applications is addressed by papers on optimization of applied designs for navigation, hydropower and cooling water intakes.

All of a groyne may be under water, in which case it is a submerged groyne. The areas between groups of groynes are groyne fields. Groynes are generally placed in groups.
