50|$|Tank {{container}} chassis, {{also referred}} to as tank chassis, <b>drop</b> <b>frame</b> chassis or tank trailers, are a form of intermodal transportation for portable bulk liquid containers or ISO tank containers. They are characteristically longer and have lower deck height ideal for transporting constantly shifting payloads. The invention of the tank container revolutionized the way bulk liquids were transported, stored, and handled worldwide. It has improved safety, reduced costs and brought with it the benefits of convenience and efficiency associated with a multi-modal transport system. Invariably the invention of the <b>drop</b> <b>frame</b> chassis followed soon after to accommodate this new type of intermodal container.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the growth}} in network {{capacity}} of wireless in-home networks, these networks often have insufficient capacity to support multiple simultaneous Audio/Video streams. Unpredictable behavior of these networks results in a drop of video quality for the end-user. A method for reducing the claim of an individual A/V stream on the network capacity is controlled <b>frame</b> <b>dropping.</b> However, controlled <b>frame</b> <b>dropping</b> will only be accepted if {{its effect on the}} quality that endusers experience is minimized. In this paper, we define an objective quality metric for <b>frame</b> <b>dropping</b> methods, to determine when <b>frame</b> <b>dropping</b> is not effective any more. The quality metric, a fraction between 0 and 1, is related to the characteristics of <b>frame</b> <b>dropping.</b> A quality level below 0, 9 indicates that a detectable amount of <b>frames</b> has been <b>dropped.</b> A quality level above 0. 98 indicates that no significant <b>frame</b> <b>drops</b> occurred recently.

40|$|Abstract—We {{study the}} impact of a novel {{prioritized}} <b>frame</b> <b>dropping</b> scheme in buffer-constrained multiprocessor system-on-chip (MPSoC) platforms. Accurate buffer dimensioning has attracted lot of research interest as large on-chip buffers result in increased silicon area and higher costs. Multimedia applications present the flexibility of trading off quality for buffer space without any noticeable deterioration in video quality. The <b>frame</b> <b>dropping</b> scheme is crucial here to <b>drop</b> <b>frames</b> appropriately such that the required buffer size is reduced and target quality requirement is satisfied. Towards this, we propose a simple pri-oritized <b>frame</b> <b>dropping</b> mechanism which reduces the required buffer space more than existing <b>frame</b> <b>dropping</b> policies. We also provide a fast iterative procedure to find the minimum buffer size for a video clip with O(log(Ndrop)) number of iterations, where Ndrop is the maximum number of frames that can be dropped for a video clip so that a prespecified quality in terms of peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) value is satisfied...|$|R

5000|$|To correct this, <b>drop</b> <b>frame</b> SMPTE {{timecode}} was invented. In {{spite of}} what the name implies, no video frames are dropped (skipped) using drop-frame timecode. Rather, some of the timecodes are dropped. In order to make an hour of timecode match {{an hour on the}} clock, drop-frame timecode skips frame numbers 0 and 1 of the first second of every minute, except when the number of minutes is divisible by ten (i.e. when minutes mod 10 equals zero). (Because editors making cuts must be aware of the difference in color subcarrier phase between even and odd frames, it is helpful to skip pairs of frame numbers.) This achieves an [...] "easy-to-track" [...] <b>drop</b> <b>frame</b> rate of 18 frames each ten minutes (18,000 frames @ 30 frame/s) and almost perfectly compensates for the difference in rate, leaving a residual timing error of only 1.0 ppm, roughly 2.6 frames (86.4 milliseconds) per day.|$|E

40|$|Interconnects for {{clusters}} and bladed systems must deliver efficient throughput, low latency, low delay variations and minimal <b>frame</b> <b>drops.</b> The primary technical issues hindering Ethernet adoption for cluster and blade system interconnects are the current methods Ethernet switches use {{for dealing with}} congestion, which can happen frequently under cluster and blade system workloads. The common response to congestion is to <b>drop</b> <b>frames</b> and the common method of avoiding the need to <b>drop</b> <b>frames</b> is to utilize very large switch buffers. In this paper, we propose the insertion of a simple self-managing congestion control protocol into existing communication stacks {{at the edges of}} layer 2 switched interconnects. We assert that control of the traffic flow into the layer 2 subnet is key to controlling the characteristics of cluster and blade system interconnects. We show simulation results demonstrating how the proposed protocol, coupled with a layer 2 ingress rate control function, can dynamically control traffic flow so as to maximize the throughput efficiency while minimizing the loss, delay, and delay variations. 1...|$|R

50|$|<b>Drop</b> <b>frame</b> {{timecode}} originates from {{a compromise}} invented when color NTSC video was invented. The NTSC designers wanted to retain compatibility with existing monochrome televisions. To minimise subcarrier visibility on a monochrome receiver {{it was necessary}} to make the color subcarrier an odd multiple of half the line scan frequency; the multiple originally chosen was 495. With a 30 Hz frame rate the line scan frequency is (30 × 525) = 15750 Hz. So the subcarrier frequency would have been (495/2 × 15750) = 3.898125 MHz. This was the subcarrier frequency originally chosen, but tests showed that on some monochrome receivers an interference pattern caused by the beat between the color subcarrier and the 4.5 MHz sound intercarrier could be seen. The visibility of this pattern could be greatly reduced by lowering the subcarrier frequency multiple to 455 (thus increasing the beat frequency from approx 600 kHz to approx 920 kHz) and by making the beat frequency also equal to an odd multiple of half the line scan frequency. This latter change could have been achieved by raising the sound intercarrier by 0.1% to 4.5045 MHz, but the designers, concerned that this might cause problems with some existing receivers, decided instead to reduce the color subcarrier frequency, and thus both the line scan frequency and the frame rate, by 0.1% instead. Thus the NTSC color subcarrier ended up as 3.57954545 MHz (exactly 315/88 MHz), the line scan frequency as 15734.27 Hz (exactly 9/572 MHz) and the frame rate 29.97 Hz (exactly 30/1.001 Hz).|$|E

Clearly high levels of compression are desireable as long as video quality remains satisfactory, and our research addresses this key issue with a novel learning based approach. We propose the use of neural networks as post-processors for any existing video compression scheme. The approach is to interpolate video sequences and compensate for frames which may have been lost or deliberately dropped.

40|$|At low bit rates, most video coders <b>drop</b> <b>frames</b> {{from the}} {{original}} video. Motion-compensated interpolation (MCI) requires no additional bandwidth and can interpolate the missing frames. Existing MCI methods were developed for uncompressed video, are computationally demanding, and require additional motion estimation (ME). By exploiting the motion field already present in the coded video, the MCI algorithms proposed in this paper eliminate or reduce extra ME with negligible performance loss. The algorithms are applied to original and coded video to verify their usefulness. 1.

Unlike X.25, whose designers expected analog signals with a relatively high chance of transmission errors, Frame Relay is a fast packet switching technology operating over links with a low chance of transmission errors (usually practically lossless like PDH), {{which means that the}} protocol does not attempt to correct errors. When a Frame Relay network detects an error in a <b>frame,</b> it simply <b>drops</b> that <b>frame.</b> The end points have the responsibility for detecting and retransmitting <b>dropped</b> <b>frames.</b> (However, digital networks offer an incidence of error extraordinarily small relative to that of analog networks.) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Redundant Traffic Elimination (RTE) detects {{and removes}} {{repeated}} chunks of data across network flows, protocols, and applications, {{with the purpose}} of reducing bandwidth usage. In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of RTE in WLAN, compare it to RTE in Ethernet, and investigate specific issues affecting RTE in WLAN. Our results show that applying RTE to WLAN links is promising and can potentially yield high bandwidth savings, although RTE is not as effective in WLAN as in wired networks. However, to exploit the full potential of RTE, it is necessary to deal with specific challenges, such as longer headers, control and management <b>frames,</b> retransmissions, and <b>dropped</b> <b>frames.</b> We find that including parts of MAC headers in RTE can increase overall bandwidth savings by up to 53 % in a public WLAN. To handle <b>dropped</b> <b>frames,</b> which can severely compromise the effectiveness of RTE, we make a case for MAClayer RTE, which detects frame loss at the sender. This preserves 23 % more savings than a previous approach. However, frame retransmissions generate additional traffic at MAC layer, which reduces the effectiveness of RTE in general case...|$|R
