500|$|Gaiman {{suggested}} they make an episode which centres on the TARDIS itself, {{which was not}} done before for the entire series since it began in 1963. The original plan focused {{on the idea of}} the Doctor being pursued by an enemy inside the TARDIS, but went through several subsequent changes; Gaiman changed the plan to focus on the companion due to the Doctor's knowledge of his ship making it too easy for him to escape his enemy, made the TARDIS the threat rather than just a specific alien to avoid making it a simple 'cat-and-mouse' game, and then included the idea of Idris to account for what happened to the TARDIS's mind during this attack. The central idea was a [...] "what if" [...] scenario {{to see what would happen}} if the Doctor and the TARDIS <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> together. Head writer Steven Moffat liked the idea of featuring the TARDIS as a woman, believing this to be the [...] "ultimate love story" [...] for the Doctor.|$|E
500|$|The move to {{the sixth}} series also meant Gaiman had to include Rory, who had ceased {{to exist in the}} {{original}} slot in the fifth series. With Rory included, Gaiman had to [...] "reshape" [...] much of {{the second half of the}} episode, featuring Amy being on the run in the TARDIS. In the original draft where Amy was the only companion, Gaiman added a [...] "heartbreaking monologue" [...] by the character, further stating [...] "you get to see what it's like to be the companion from the companion's point of view, and she <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about essentially in that version how sad it is, in some ways. One day something will happen to her, she'll get married, she'll get eaten by monsters, she'll die, she'll get sick of this, but he'll go on forever." [...] At a certain point, Gaiman became tired of rewriting drafts and asked Steven Moffat for help. Moffat wrote in what Gaiman called [...] "several of [...] best lines" [...] and rapidly rewrote several scenes when budget problems harmed filming locations.|$|E
2500|$|Piper is {{considered}} one of the greatest talkers and heels in wrestling history. Piper's Pit interview segments were considered innovative, especially in an atmosphere where only the people like the world champion <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk,</b> and the wrestlers were the interviewees—never the interviewers. Many of the people on Piper's Pit never got to be world champion, but were main eventers. According to Bobby [...] "The Brain" [...] Heenan, he could just leave Piper in a room and return twenty minutes later with Piper having done a class-A promo. WWE named him the greatest villain in wrestling history.|$|E
60|$|Then we <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>talking</b> {{about my}} brother Samuel, {{and he told}} me my {{explanations}} were confusing.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{must have}} been very weird," [...] said Kendricks; and I thought, [...] "Oh, good heavens! Has he <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>talking</b> of weird things?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do mean it, but I don't {{expect you}} to do it; and I don't ask it. I {{suggested}} it to Cynthy, when we <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>talking</b> it over, and she saw it wouldn't do." ...|$|R
2500|$|Stokowski {{appeared}} as {{himself in the}} motion picture The Big Broadcast of 1937, conducting two of his Bach transcriptions. That same year he also conducted and acted in One Hundred Men and a Girl, with Deanna Durbin and Adolphe Menjou. In 1939, Stokowski collaborated with Walt Disney to create the motion picture {{for which he is}} best known: Fantasia. He conducted all the music (with the exception of a [...] "jam session" [...] {{in the middle of the}} film) and included his own orchestrations for the Toccata and Fugue in D minor and Night on Bald Mountain/Ave Maria segments. Stokowski even <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to (and shake hands with) Mickey Mouse on screen, although he would later say with a smile that Mickey Mouse got to shake hands with him. This footage of Stokowski was incorporated into Fantasia 2000.|$|E
2500|$|On 9 March 2005, Crowe {{revealed}} to GQ magazine that Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents had approached him {{prior to the}} 73rd Academy Awards in March 2001, {{and told him that}} the terrorist group al-Qaeda wanted to kidnap him. Crowe told the magazine that {{it was the first time}} he had ever heard of al-Qaeda and was quoted as saying: [...] "You get this late-night call from the FBI when you arrive in Los Angeles, and they're, like, absolutely full-on. 'We've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to you now before you do anything. We have to have a discussion with you, Mr. Crowe.'" [...] Crowe recalled that: [...] "It was something to do with some recording picked up by a French policewoman, I think, in either Libya or Algiers...it was about taking iconographic Americans out of the picture as a sort of cultural destabilisation plan." ...|$|E
2500|$|Alexis Bledel {{was cast}} in the key role of Rory despite having no {{previous}} acting experience. Sherman-Palladino was drawn to her shyness and innocence, which she said was essential for the character, and felt she photographed well. Lauren Graham was pursued by the casting directors {{from the start of}} the process, but she was committed to another show on NBC. A week before shooting, they had still failed to cast Lorelai so they asked Graham to audition anyway. Sherman-Palladino cast her that day, on the hope that Graham's other show (M.Y.O.B.) would be cancelled, which it soon was. She later explained how Graham met all the criteria she had been looking for: [...] "Lorelai’s a hard fucking part. You’ve got to be funny, you’ve <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> really fucking fast, you’ve got to be able to act, you’ve got to be sexy, but not scary sexy. You’ve got to be strong, but not like ‘I hate men,'". Graham and Bledel only met the night before they started filming the pilot.|$|E
60|$|In {{describing}} the incident {{to his wife}} Ewbert stopped at this point, and then passed {{on to say that}} after they <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>talking</b> Hilbrook seemed more and more gratified, and even glad, to see him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, you see, {{when you}} <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>talking</b> about the funeral, I just got all {{full of the}} idea of our coming and hiding in the church, and I couldn't somehow bear to spoil it. So I just put the bark back in my pocket and kept mum." ...|$|R

6000|$|Duveen nodded. [...] "A happy thought! I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to some {{business}} {{people who make}} Ruth tired. If you come along, I needn't bother about her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is, indeed. You may imagine his {{surprise}} and joy, when I told him who I was. Now we have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> over the best plan of getting him out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{want to talk}} to {{you about}} her, Trowse," [...] he said. [...] "I can't expect your sympathy, and you can't help me--you nor any other man. But I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to some one--or go mad." ...|$|E
25|$|In July 2007, Hunt <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>talking</b> {{about her}} breast removal with a twelve-year-old boy {{and told the}} boy that now she is like the Amazons of old who would have a breast removed {{so that when they}} went into battle they could use their bow without their breast getting in the way when they let their arrows fly.|$|R
50|$|A.W. Gryphon {{also wrote}} the supernatural novel Blood Moon. Allison Hebble, Zed Starkovich and Starlotte Dawn Smith were all neighbors in West Hollywood. They <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>talking</b> one day over {{a glass of}} wine and decided to make a movie. They called some friends and {{less than a year later}} went into {{production}} on La Cucina.|$|R
6000|$|... "In course," [...] {{said the}} captain, rising. [...] "Ye see," [...] he said, apologetically, [...] "we <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>talking</b> o' Roger and ole times, and I {{got a little}} out o' my course. It's a matter of--" [...] he began to fumble in his pockets, and finally {{produced}} a small memorandum-book, which he glanced over--"it's a matter of $250." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{going over}} to Ingleside to {{have a talk with}} Mrs. Blythe," [...] she sobbed. [...] "SHE won't laugh at me, as {{everybody}} else does. I've just <b>GOT</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to somebody who understands how bad I feel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "With {{everybody}} {{coming in}} and out, just as they pleased. I don't believe in private rooms in London clubs. What I've got to say can be said better sub dio. I suppose {{you know what it}} is that I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The public'll be sick!" [...] {{cried the}} distressed reporter. [...] "If she's sick, why doesn't she send for a doctor? All Boston is packed into this house, {{and she has}} <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to it. I {{want to go in}} and see." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They'll {{be getting}} fairly dry {{in half an}} hour or so and then we'll pull out for home," [...] he added. [...] "It's {{breezing}} up quite smart now and I'd lie here until morning only aunt would get badly scared. She wouldn't say anything, but if Jake <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>talking</b> it would probably make trouble when dad comes home." ...|$|R
6000|$|Well, {{everything}} was so awful still that we <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>talking</b> {{in a very}} low voice, and kept on getting creepier and lonesomer and less and less talky, till at last the talk ran dry altogether, and we just set there and [...] "thunk," [...] as Jim calls it, and {{never said a word}} the longest time.|$|R
5000|$|Maude: [...] "L-I-V-E! Live! Otherwise, you <b>got</b> nothing <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> {{about in}} the locker room." [...] - Nominated ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Stranger,' he said, 'I {{want you}} to {{understand}} that any one who speaks to that young woman has <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> with me. I am Wyoming Bill, I am. I have set my mind on her, and it will be safer to tread in a nest of rattlesnakes than to get my dander up.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, thank you, {{not very}} well. There isn't {{anything}} really the matter; but we didn't {{either of us}} sleep very well last night; we were excited. I don't know as I ought to tell you," [...] she began. [...] "I don't suppose it's a thing you would know about, any way; but I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to somebody--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Look here, old boy, if {{you don't}} {{want me to}} read, you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk,</b> and {{tell me all about}} Kansas, and the farms, and that part. The Montana {{business}} I know, but you seem to forget what went before. Brace up, and let's have it,' he began, with an abruptness which roused Dan from a brown study most effectually.|$|E
6000|$|... "`But I {{believe in}} 'em,' {{said the boy}} Jeff, who was seated {{on the other side}} of the table, and looked at us so earnestly that we could scarce help smiling--though we didn't feel in a smiling humour at the time, for it was getting dark, and we had <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>talking</b> in low tones and looking anxiously over our shoulders, you know-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{just what}} I {{was telling the}} boys last night. There were {{two or three of}} them from Traverse staying at the hotel, and when we <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>talking</b> about the hail they allowed that he'd have to cut the creamery plan out. I said that when Elcot Hunter took a thing up he stayed with it until he put it through." ...|$|R
6000|$|Well, {{the man was}} astonished, of course; {{and first}} off {{he looked like he}} didn't know whether to be scared, or glad, or both, or which, but finally he settled down to being glad; and then his color come back, though at first his face had turned pretty white. So we <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>talking</b> {{together}} while he et his breakfast. And he says: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I will" [...] {{said the}} woman, as she {{supported}} herself on one palm {{and raised the}} other. [...] "I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> that way." [...] She was ripe for an explosion like this. She seized upon it with eagerness. [...] "They ain't no use o' livin' this way, anyway. I'd take poison if it wa'n't f'r the young ones." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The very hares grow brave. I suppose {{because it}} IS the chief thing in life." [...] He stopped and said earnestly: [...] "It {{is the chief}} thing in life, and {{everything}} else goes down before it. Everything, my dear, everything!... But we have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> upon indifferent themes until we have done with this blond young gentleman from Bavaria...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And we've got to {{get them}} open. ''Tis them that looks that finds.' There's lots of time to learn things. We don't care if it takes months and months. We're footloose. A good start {{is better than a}} dozen bad ones. We've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> and find out. We'll talk with {{everybody}} we meet. Ask questions. Ask everybody. It's the only way to find out." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "It {{came about}} {{by just a}} lot of people saying, 'how come the Sprints and Midgets have a Hall of Fame and the dirt Late Models, which {{obviously}} have ten times more cars, doesn't have one?'" [...] explained Bill Holder. [...] "I <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>talking</b> with CJ (Rayburn) and them and everyone was standing there and looked at me and said, 'why don't you do it?' (laughs)." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That {{reminds me}} of some one else,' said yet another voice, 'His wife's at home, too. Whew!' and he whistled drearily. So did the tide of voices run on till men <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>talking</b> over {{the chances of a}} dividend, 'They went to the Bank of England,' drawled an American, 'and the Bank of England let them down; said their {{securities}} weren't good enough.' ...|$|R
60|$|Much elated {{with her}} success, Jo did 'tell on', all about their plays and plans, their {{hopes and fears}} for Father, and the most {{interesting}} events of the little {{world in which the}} sisters lived. Then they <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>talking</b> about books, and to Jo's delight, she found that Laurie loved them as well as she did, and had read even more than herself.|$|R
