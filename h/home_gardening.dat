40|$|ABSTRACT Among the {{agricultural}} environments of traditional communities, <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> are frequently cited as high agrobiodiversity sites. However, the agrobiodiversity of <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> along a rural-urban gradient demands study {{in order to}} identify possible influences of urbanization and to support mitigation of impacts. The present work investigated the role <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> play in the in situ agrobiodiversity conservation of plants in quilombola communities with different degrees of urbanization. The study found that more urbanized communities have larger <b>home</b> <b>gardens,</b> but the average richness of plant species in these areas was not statistically different among the communities. Furthermore, the abundance of plant species was similar. Medicinal and food plants were mainly found in <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> of the communities with high to intermediate levels of urbanization, while ornamental plants were more common in rural community <b>home</b> <b>gardens.</b> It is believed that crop exclusivity in <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> of the more urbanized communities highly influenced the results, increasing the role <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> play in maintaining traditional practices. The elevated and statistically equal species richness in <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> suggests that, despite the factors generated by urbanization, all of the communities are very important for in situ conservation of native and introduced species...|$|R

Sometimes in the long, tender afternoons, we see far up on some pasture slope, groups of girls scattered about on the grass, with their sewing, or listening to some one reading. Other times they are giving a little play, usually a comedy, for life is so happy here that tragedy would not be true to it, with the characters coming and going in a grove of small pines, for the coulisses, and using a level of grass for the stage. If we stop, one of the audience comes down to us and invites us to come up and see the play, which keeps on in spite of the sensation that I can feel I make among them.|$|E

The {{aim of this}} thesis was to explore how rural households with HIV and AIDS in Ghana are employing <b>home</b> <b>garden</b> management strategies to enhance food and nutrition security and also to examine the seasonal dimension of coping with food insecurity in these rural households through documentation of the frequency and severity of the food–related coping behaviours adopted during periods of peak seasonal food shortages. In Sub-Saharan Africa, <b>home</b> <b>garden</b> cultivation {{is considered to be}} a potential strategy for rural households with HIV and AIDS to cope with labour constraints and to improve food and nutrition security. However, existing research that has addressed the relationship between HIV and AIDS, <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> and food security focused on predictions; there is severe dearth of empirical evidence. Qualitative and quantitative research methodologies were used in this study. Data collection methods included focus group discussions, interviews with key informants, a questionnaire-based survey, in-depth interviews in case studies and participant observations. A 24 -hour qualitative dietary recall was used to assess dietary intake of households studied and the Coping Strategy Index was used to assess the severity of household food-related coping behaviours. Data on biophysical aspects of the <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> was obtained through a <b>home</b> <b>garden</b> survey. The results showed that when labour constraint reduced field cultivation in rural households with HIV and AIDS, labour input in <b>home</b> <b>garden</b> significantly increased; rural households did not cultivate a greater diversity of plant species in <b>home</b> <b>gardens,</b> but rather relatively more food items of the essential food groups were consumed from <b>home</b> <b>gardens.</b> This contributed significantly to dietary diversity. Uncovering the effect of the interaction between household HIV status and gender of the household head on <b>home</b> <b>garden</b> biodiversity indicated that female-headed households with HIV and AIDS depended more on <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> than their counterparts without HIV and AIDS in producing crops for sustenance and dietary diversity. Exploring the biodiversity in <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> of rural households with HIV and AIDS when <b>home</b> <b>garden</b> cultivation is also meant to generate cash income revealed that rural households experiencing HIV and AIDS illness in cultivating commerce-oriented <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> cultivated a dual purpose <b>home</b> <b>garden</b> that provided cash income and also supplied subsistence food. Assessing the frequency and severity of the food-related coping behaviours adopted by farm households with HIV and AIDS during the post-harvest period and in the lean season showed that farm households with HIV and AIDS were more vulnerable to food insecurity in both the post-harvest and lean season; this vulnerability was also reflected in their poverty, family care burdens (larger number of dependents and ill persons), lower education level and meagre income earning opportunity. It is essential that concerted efforts are made to improve the general well-being of farm households with HIV and AIDS by empowering rural households with HIV and AIDS in terms of capacity building, access to livelihood assets and access to finance.    ...|$|R

Most of these <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> rely on rain for survival, i. e., rainfed systems. At present <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> are being neglected due to social and environmental problems. Among these issues, the scarcity of water during cropping seasons is the most important issue that adversely affects crop production from <b>home</b> <b>gardens.</b> This is mainly due to the occurrence of unexpected dry periods during the cropping seasons, and the requirement to have a water source at the farmer’s residence to irrigate the <b>home</b> <b>garden</b> during the dry spells (to capture and conserve roof runoff in the <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> for subsequent use) is an appropriate green option to mitigate this situation. Microlevel rainwater tanks are promoted to be used to collect roof runoff water during wet periods enabling the farmer to irrigate his <b>home</b> <b>garden</b> crops during dry periods. Field experiments were carried out at Mapalana Research Farm in Sri Lanka to obtain the roof runoff coefficients from commonly used roof types; namely: asbestos, tiles, and thatched (either straw or woven coconut leaves).

Information on household characteristics and labour allocation to <b>home</b> <b>garden</b> management was obtained through a cross-sectional survey and in-depth interviews. Dietary diversity score was estimated for each household based on a 24 -hour qualitative dietary recall. Plant species in each <b>home</b> <b>garden</b> were recorded. HIV/ AIDS affliction did not affect <b>home</b> <b>garden</b> diversity but afflicted households had more on-farm sources of income and a higher dietary diversity and allocated more adult labour to <b>home</b> <b>garden</b> activities than non-afflicted households. Dual-headed households had more diversity in the <b>home</b> <b>garden</b> and allocated more adult male labour to the <b>home</b> <b>garden</b> than female-headed households.

We registered the cultivated trees and herbs in samples of twelve <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> of poorer and wealthier families that had similar assets in the 1980 s, and classified them by principal use and geographic origin. Total species richness of cultivated herbs was highest in <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> of the more prosperous families, whereas total species richness of trees was highest in <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> of the poorer families.
