To overcome these security problems many security mechanisms for mobile communications havebeen introduced in the literature.

In this paper, we come up with a novel certification mechanism, called the nested one-time secret mechanism, tailored for mobile interaction environments. Through maintaining inner and outer synchronously changeable common secrets, respectively, every mobile user can be rapidly authenticated by visited location register (VLR) and home location register (HLR), respectively, in the proposed scheme. Not only does the proposed solution achieve mutual certification, but it also greatly reduces the computation and interaction cost <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mobile users as compared to the existing certification schemes.
