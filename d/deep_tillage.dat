40|$|When field {{pollution}} is heterogeneous due to localized pesticide application, {{as is the}} case of chlordecone (CLD), the mean level of {{pollution is}} difficult to assess. Our objective was to design a decision support tool to optimize soil sampling. We analyzed the CLD heterogeneity of soil content at 0 - 30 - and 30 - 60 -cm depth. This was done within and between nine plots (0. 4 to 1. 8 ha) on andosol and ferralsol. We determined that 20 pooled subsamples per plot were a satisfactory compromise with respect to both cost and accuracy. Globally, CLD content was greater for andosols and the upper soil horizon (0 - 30 cm). Soil organic carbon cannot account for CLD intra-field variability. Cropping systems and tillage practices influence the CLD content and distribution; that is CLD pollution was higher under intensive banana cropping systems and, while upper soil horizon was more polluted than the lower one with shallow tillage (< 40 cm), <b>deeper</b> <b>tillage</b> led to a homogenization and a dilution of the pollution in the soil profile. The decision tool we proposed compiles and organizes these results to better assess CLD soil pollution in terms of sampling depth, distance, and unit at field scale.

This decision support tool is also adaptable to other types of heterogeneous agricultural pollution at field level. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

We found that (1) division of reduced tillage practices into different classes {{with varying degrees of}} intensity allowed us to assess the trade-offs between reductions in tillage intensity, crop yields, weed incidence, and soil C stocks.

Two methods to accomplish this include <b>deep</b> <b>tillage,</b> and rotating to a non-host crop the year following an onion crop. Controlling volunteer onion sprouting (or the emergence of the previous year's onion plants) will also assist in prevention of the pathogen from carrying-over from one year to the next. Irrigation practices can also be used to limit the development of OPM. Moisture stress has been noted to increase the susceptibility of host species to L. taurica. Onions with adequate moisture will be more resistant to the pathogen, and onion crops with overhead irrigation rarely see powdery mildew development in the field. The fungicide Cabrio (produced by BASF Chemical) is labeled for the control of L. taurica on onions, but the disease rarely progresses enough to justify the use of a fungicide. Considerations of economic benefit should be made before the fungicide is applied, and all labeling directions followed. Resistant varieties have been found in some studies, Jahn et al. found powdery mildew resistance to be extremely beneficial in cucurbits, reducing the need for fungicide, and reducing agricultural losses due to powdery mildew pathogens. Although a truly resistant variety has not been found for onion plants, some onion genotypes with glossy leaves had selective susceptibility to L. taurica. Onions with the glossiest leaves were found to be most susceptible, while onions with less glossy leaves showed limited susceptibility. However, the study was unable to come to a conclusion on which variety was best suited for L. taurica resistance.|$|E

However, current tillage practice is often implemented without full understanding of machine design and capability leading to lowered efficiency and further potential damage to the soil structure. By modifying the physical properties of soil only where the tillage is needed for optimum crop growth, variable depth tillage (VDT) has been shown to reduce costs, labour, fuel consumption and energy requirements. To implement VDT it is necessary to determine and map soil physical properties, spatially and with depth through the soil profile. Up until now the measurement of soil compaction for VDT has been soil penetration resistance, expressed as Cone Index (CI). In this research a multi-sensor and data fusion approach was developed that allowed augmenting data collected with an electromagnetic sensor, a standard penetrometer, and conventional methods for the measurement of bulk density (BD) and moisture content (MC). Packing density values were recorded for eight soil layers of 0 - 5, 5 - 10, 10 - 15, 15 - 20, 20 - 25, 25 - 30 30 - 35 and 35 - 40 cm.
