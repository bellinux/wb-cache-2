50|$|Maintenance {{primarily}} {{consists of}} visual inspection of all structural components, wiring, and moving parts outside the powerplant, and lubrication of bearings every 100 <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> operation. The time between <b>overhauls</b> (TBO) <b>of</b> the aircraft {{is estimated to}} be 1,500-2,000 hours. The track record of the Solar T-62 gas turbine power plant in military applications (Sikorsky CH-53E Super Stallion and Boeing CH-47 Chinook auxiliary power units) is reported to be excellent — so much so, that the maintenance schedule essentially consists of inspection of the powerplant interior at 1,000 <b>hours</b> and <b>overhaul</b> <b>of</b> the powerplant when wear is measured beyond established tolerances.|$|R

40|$|Abstract A {{combined}} overhaul/replacement {{policy is}} developed {{for a class}} of deteriorating equipment, where operating costs increase with age. It is assumed that the effect <b>of</b> an <b>overhaul</b> is to reduce these costs by a fIxed amount, from the time <b>of</b> <b>overhaul</b> onwalds. Two possible assumptions as to the dependence <b>of</b> <b>overhauling</b> effects on equipment age and two functional forms of this dependence are explored. Discounting considerations are omitted from the analysis and the possible effect of this omission on outcomes is investgated. 1...|$|R

40|$|A {{preventive}} maintenance policy with minimal repair at failure, periodic overhaul and replacement is considered. A model describing the effect <b>of</b> <b>overhaul</b> is proposed and the expected cost rate is obtained under negligible or non-negligible maintenance time. Based on this model, the optimal number <b>of</b> <b>overhauls</b> and optimal interval between overhauls for minimizing the expected cost rate over infinite time horizon are determined. Under some mild conditions, a unique optimal maintenance policy exists and a closed form expression for the optimal interval between overhauls is derived when {{the lifetime of}} the system follows Weibull distribution. Numerical studies are made...|$|R
