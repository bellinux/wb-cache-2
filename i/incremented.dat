5|$|In 1962, Arafat and {{his closest}} companions {{migrated}} to Syria—a country sharing a border with Israel—which had recently seceded from its union with Egypt. Fatah had approximately three hundred members by this time, but none were fighters. In Syria, {{he managed to}} recruit members by offering them higher incomes to enable his armed attacks against Israel. Fatah's manpower was <b>incremented</b> further after Arafat decided to offer new recruits much higher salaries than members of the Palestine Liberation Army (PLA), the regular military force of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which {{was created by the}} Arab League in 1964. On 31 December, a squad from al-Assifa, Fatah's armed wing, attempted to infiltrate Israel, but they were intercepted and detained by Lebanese security forces. Several other raids with Fatah's poorly trained and badly-equipped fighters followed this incident. Some were successful, others failed in their missions. Arafat often led these incursions personally.|$|E

The top drums were all driven in synchrony by an electric motor. For each full rotation of the top drums, the middle drums were <b>incremented</b> by one position, and likewise for the middle and bottom drums, giving the total of 26 × 26 × 26 = 17,576 positions of the 3-rotor Enigma scrambler.|$|E
25|$|X# {{can work}} with three {{low-level}} data structures: the registers, the stack and the memory, on different ports. The registers are the base of all normal operations for X#. A register can be copied to another by writing DST = SRC as opposed to mov or load/store instructions. Registers can be <b>incremented</b> or decremented just as easily. Arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) are written as dest op src where src is a constant, variable, or register, and dest is both an operand and the location where the result is stored.|$|E

A lock flag and locked physical address register are used by the load-locked and store-conditional instructions for multiprocessor support.

25|$|The Correcting Selectric II used a new ribbon {{cartridge}} mechanism. The cartridge contained both supply and take-up spools, permitting both easy ribbon {{changes and the}} use of several types of ribbon on one machine. The ribbons were wider than had been used previously, giving more typed characters per inch of ribbon. Successive characters were staggered vertically on the ribbon, which <b>incremented</b> less than a full character position each time. Different types of ribbons had different-depth holes {{in the bottom of the}} cartridge, which set the mechanism to advance the ribbon by the amount appropriate for the type of ribbon.|$|E
25|$|Sequence number: (16 bits) The {{sequence}} number is <b>incremented</b> by {{one for each}} RTP data packet sent and {{is to be used}} by the receiver to detect packet loss and to restore packet sequence. The RTP does not specify any action on packet loss; it is left to the application to take appropriate action. For example, video applications may play the last known frame in place of the missing frame. According to , the initial value of the {{sequence number}} should be random to make known-plaintext attacks on encryption more difficult. RTP provides no guarantee of delivery, but the presence of sequence numbers makes it possible to detect missing packets.|$|E
25|$|Branch {{instructions}} have a 6-bit opcode field, a 5-bit Ra {{field and}} a 21-bit displacement field. The Ra field specifies a register {{to be tested}} by a conditional branch instruction, and if the condition is met, the program counter is updated by adding {{the contents of the}} displacement field with the program counter. The displacement field contains a signed integer and if the value of the integer is positive, if the branch is taken then the program counter is <b>incremented.</b> If the value of the integer is negative, then program counter is decremented if the branch is taken. The range of a branch thus is ±1 Mi instructions, or ±4 MiB. The Alpha Architecture was designed with a large range as part of the architecture's forward-looking goal.|$|E

30|$|The {{applicability}} {{of a new}} inversion method to the Japanese Islands is examined. This method can compute a self-equilibrating stress <b>increment</b> from a strain <b>increment,</b> and {{the validity of the}} method is verified for metal-like-materials. Some modifications will be needed in applying the new inversion method to the Japanese Islands when a strain <b>increment</b> measured by the GPS array is used as input data. In this paper, we try to compute the stress <b>increment</b> associated with a measured displacement <b>increment.</b> It is shown that the inversion works and the stress <b>increment</b> is computed.

40|$|Marginal <b>increment</b> {{analysis}} was used to validate the periodicity of opaque <b>increment</b> formation in red throat emperor (Lethrinus miniatus) otoliths and to test for variation in the periodicity and timing of <b>increment</b> formation across age classes, years and regions of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Marginal <b>increment</b> analysis demonstrated that opaque <b>increments</b> were deposited on an annual basis, a result supported by a preliminary experiment on a chemically tagged captive fish, although significant regional and temporal variation in the timing of <b>increment</b> formation was observed. Marginal <b>increment</b> analysis revealed a clear annual periodicity in <b>increment</b> formation for all age classes in the southern region but a more ambiguous pattern for most age classes in the northern region of the species distribution on the GBR. Opaque <b>increments</b> appeared to form 1 month earlier in the southern region than in the northern region and, in the southern region, formed 2 months earlier in 1999 than in 2000. No significant variation was observed in the timing of <b>increment</b> formation between age classes.

25|$|In these machines, {{addition}} and subtraction {{were performed}} in a single operation, as on a conventional adding machine, but multiplication and division were accomplished by repeated mechanical additions and subtractions. Friden made a calculator that also provided square roots, basically by doing division, but with added mechanism that automatically <b>incremented</b> the number in the keyboard in a systematic fashion. The last of the mechanical calculators were likely to have short-cut multiplication, and some ten-key, serial-entry types had decimal-point keys. However, decimal-point keys required significant internal added complexity, and were offered {{only in the last}} designs to be made. Handheld mechanical calculators such as the 1948 Curta continued to be used until they were displaced by electronic calculators in the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|In economics, {{marginal}} cost {{is the change}} in the opportunity cost that arises when the quantity produced is <b>incremented</b> by one unit, that is, it is the cost of producing one more unit of a good. Intuitively, {{marginal cost}} at each level of production includes the cost of any additional inputs required to produce the next unit. At each level of production and time period being considered, marginal costs include all costs that vary with the level of production, whereas other costs that do not vary with production are considered fixed. For example, the marginal cost of producing an automobile will generally include the costs of labor and parts needed for the additional automobile and not the fixed costs of the factory that have already been incurred. In practice, marginal analysis is segregated into short and long-run cases, so that, over the long run, all costs (including fixed costs) become marginal.|$|E
25|$|The {{seriousness}} of the spring equinox drift is widely discounted {{on the grounds that}} Passover will remain in the spring season for many millennia, and the text of the Torah is generally not interpreted as having specified tight calendrical limits. Of course, the Hebrew calendar also drifts with respect to the autumn equinox, and {{at least part of the}} harvest festival of Sukkot is already more than a month after the equinox in years 1, 9, and 12 of each 19-year cycle; beginning in AM 5818 (2057 CE), this will also be the case in year 4. (These are the same year numbers as were mentioned for the spring season in the previous paragraph, except that they get <b>incremented</b> at Rosh Hashanah.) This progressively increases the probability that Sukkot will be cold and wet, making it uncomfortable or impractical to dwell in the traditional succah during Sukkot. The first winter seasonal prayer for rain is not recited until Shemini Atzeret, after the end of Sukkot, yet it is becoming increasingly likely that the rainy season in Israel will start before the end of Sukkot.|$|E
40|$|The {{detection}} of a brief <b>increment</b> in {{the intensity of}} a longer duration pedestal is commonly used {{as a measure of}} intensity-resolution. <b>Increment</b> detection is known to improve with increasing duration of the <b>increment</b> and also with increasing duration of the pedestal, but the relative effects of these two parameters have not been explored in the same study. In several past studies of the effects of <b>increment</b> duration, pedestal duration was increased as <b>increment</b> duration increased. In the present study, <b>increment</b> and pedestal duration were independently manipulated. Increment-detection thresholds were determined for four subjects with normal-hearing using a 500 - or 4000 -Hz pedestal presented at 60 dB sound pressure level (SPL). <b>Increment</b> durations were 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, and 320 ms. Pedestal durations were 20, 40, 80, 160, and 320 ms. Each <b>increment</b> duration was combined with all pedestals of equal or greater duration. Multiple-regression analyses indicate that <b>increment</b> detection under these conditions is determined primarily by pedestal duration. Follow-up experiments ruled out effects of off-frequency listening or overshoot. The results suggest that effects of <b>increment</b> duration have been confounded by effects of pedestal duration in studies that co-varied <b>increment</b> and pedestal duration. Implications for models of temporal integration are discussed...|$|R
