2500|$|In February 2011, {{the airline}} painted eight of its {{aircraft}} with a lightweight, thin [...] "revolutionary nano technology coating" [...] polymer. It works by reducing build-up of debris and reduces drag {{across the surface}} of the aircraft, thus reducing the <b>fuel</b> <b>bill.</b> It was estimated the airline could save 1–2% annually, equating to a £14million reduction in fuel costs. The coating has already been used on US military aircraft and if successful easyJet would apply the paint to its whole fleet.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} warmth interventions on self-reported difficulties affording <b>fuel</b> <b>bills</b> {{against a backdrop of}} rising mental health problems, using a longitudinal sample in Glasgow, UK. Following a period of rising fuel prices and stagnating wages, fuel poverty is high on the political agenda and is a particular issue for those living in deprived communities who may be most affected by rising <b>fuel</b> <b>bills</b> and reductions in employment, wages and incomes in the recent period of recession and austerity. Since 2006, the reporting of difficulties paying for <b>fuel</b> <b>bills</b> has been rising in the study population. Alongside fuel prices and income, energy efficiency is the third key driver of fuel poverty. As such the research seeks to establish whether warmth interventions, designed to improve the energy efficiency of homes can provide protection against worsening financial difficulties and lead to better mental health outcomes for residents. Results suggest that those who report greater frequency of financial difficulty also report worsening mental health. There is limited impact of energy efficiency improvements on perceived fuel affordability difficulties, and where there is an effect, central heating is related to more frequent financial hardships...|$|R

40|$|Energy {{costs have}} a major impact on {{production}} costs in agriculture. Irrigated agricultural has additional energy sensitivity due to the cost of pumping irrigation water. As pumping energy costs increase, irrigators have been exploring energy options. While changing energy sources can sometimes be economical option, it can require large up-front investment costs with little guarantee that the alternative energy source will remain cost competitive. Before changing energy sources, irrigators should evaluate the performance of their current pumping plants, as wear and changes in pumping conditions over time can cause substantial loss in pumping plant efficiency. This results in the increased use of fuel for the same or less amount of water pumped. The irrigation fuel or energy bill is composed of two parts. The first is related to pumping plant performance and the second is related to crop irrigation management. Total <b>fuel</b> <b>bill</b> = Pumping cost/Unit Volume of Water x Volume Applied The pumping cost per unit volume of water depends on well efficiency, pumping plant efficiency and fuel cost. The major influences on the total volume applied are related to management issues, such as irrigation schedule for the crop selected and the irrigation system efficiency. Reducing the total volume applied reduces the <b>fuel</b> <b>bill</b> proportionately, so if the amount of water applied is minimized with good irrigation scheduling and high application efficiency, the <b>fuel</b> <b>bill</b> will be minimized based on pumping volume. Good irrigation management practices and high system efficiency are the subject of other presentations. The focus of this discussion will be on the pumping cost per unit volume of water...|$|E
