50|$|CBI {{accounts}} for {{a large proportion of}} spherical pressure vessels in the world. They are used extensively for LPG, as well as for other volatile gasses. CBI identifies the following uses: gasoline, anhydrous ammonia, vinyl chloride monomer (VCM), naphtha, propane, propylene, ethane, butane, NGL and butadien. Cryogenic storage is also possible for LNG, methane, ethylene, hydrogen and oxygen. Gases that may be stored include hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, helium and argon. Other uses have been applied to the <b>Hortonsphere</b> including space chambers, hyperbaric chambers, environmental chambers, vacuum vessels, process vessels, test vessels, containment vessels and surge vessels.|$|E
50|$|Initially, <b>Hortonspheres</b> were {{constructed}} by riveting together separate wrought iron or steel plates, {{but from the}} 1940s, were of welded construction. The plates are formed in roller plants and cut to patterns.|$|R

40|$|Photograph of the {{exterior}} of the Shell Chemical Corporation synthetic rubber plant, in August 1955. Fourteen round butadiene storage tanks, called <b>hortonspheres,</b> sit atop elevated metal structures. Each has a winding stair connected to it, which leads to the ground below. A complex series of pipes streams from the right and connects to the tanks from their respective bases. In the background, at right, the tops of several tall vessels appear, alongside several stacks. Rows of cylindrical tanks line the far distance...|$|R
