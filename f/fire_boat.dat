5|$|This {{fire had}} more {{troubles}} {{due to the}} age and condition of the bridge; the wood trusses on the bridge were unsafe for firefighters to scale, due to the fire on the bridge ten years before. Louisville Fire & Rescue chief Greg Frederick decided that firefighters {{were not to be}} sent onto the bridge; a boat from the Harrods Creek Fire Department was used to put out the fire, as Louisville's <b>fire</b> <b>boat</b> did not have a hose that could reach the blaze on the bridge.|$|E
25|$|On September 15, 1998, {{the wooden}} {{footbridge}} {{from the western}} shore to Kingman Island was set afire by vandals around 9:00p.m., and burned for {{about two and a}} half hours.

25|$|Firefighting in {{the town}} of Trumbull is served by three {{independent}} and all-volunteer fire departments. Each fire department handles its own tax structure and fund raising, but receives no funding from the town. There are a total of seven fire stations, equipped with and an apparatus fleet of nine engines, three trucks (including one ladder tender/air truck), one quint, three rescues, one squad engine, one satellite maxi-water unit, one <b>fire</b> <b>boat,</b> one town-wide command trailer, five utility units, and numerous support units.

25|$|Between 17:45 and 18:00 on 9 February 1942, {{authorities}} {{considered the}} fire under control, and began winding down operations until 20:00. Water entering the ship through submerged openings and flowing {{to the lower}} decks negated efforts to counter-flood, and Lafayettes list gradually increased to port. Shortly after midnight, Rear Adm. Andrews ordered Lafayette abandoned, and the ship continued to list, a process hastened by the 6,000 tons of water that had been played on her. New York fire officials were concerned that the fire could spread to the nearby city buildings. Lafayette eventually capsized during the mid watch (02:45) on 10 February, nearly crushing a <b>fire</b> <b>boat,</b> and {{came to rest on}} her port side at an angle of approximately 80 degrees. Recognising that his incompetence had caused the disaster, Admiral Andrews ordered all pressmen barred from viewing the moment of capsize in an effort to lower the level of publicity.|$|E
500|$|Warren also {{observed}} that the radsafe procedures were not being followed correctly. Fire boats got {{too close to the}} target ships they were hosing and drenched their crews with radioactive spray. One <b>fire</b> <b>boat</b> had to be taken out of service. Film badges showed 67 overdoses between August 6 and 9. More than half of the 320 Geiger counters available shorted out and became unavailable. [...] The crews of two target ships, [...] and , moored far from the detonation site, had moved back on board and become overexposed. [...] They were immediately evacuated back to the United States.|$|E
500|$|On October 7, 1960 Edward M. Cotter {{came to the}} aid of {{firefighting}} {{authorities in}} Port Colborne, Ontario, Canada. Two days previously, on October 5, 1960, a set of grain elevators caught fire at the eight-story Maple Leaf Milling Company. The Port Colborne Fire Department did not have its own fireboat and they were unable to bring the fire under control. The Buffalo Fire Department was asked to send Edward M. Cotter to lend assistance. Escorted by a United States Coast Guard cutter, because she had never needed navigational equipment of her own, Edward M. Cotter proceeded across the international border. [...] The voyage to Port Colborne took two hours with an additional four hours needed to bring the fire under control. This mission {{is said to have been}} the first instance that a United States <b>fire</b> <b>boat</b> had crossed an international border to help authorities in another country.|$|E
50|$|Fighting {{continued}} for four days, {{after which the}} Koreans resorted to <b>fire</b> <b>boats,</b> filled with wood, sulphur and saltpeter. The first two failed to inflict any damage, but the third set General Sherman afire. Unable to stem the flames, the crew jumped into the water.|$|R

50|$|On July 8, 2015, two barges hit {{the safety}} fender of the toll bridge at about 2:15 am. Approximately 60 ft of the fender was removed. The bridge was {{inspected}} at about 11:00 am, while police and <b>fire</b> <b>boats</b> helped {{to maintain the}} area while divers were underwater.

500|$|At 10:18p.m., {{witnesses}} reported {{hearing a}} noise described as [...] "a metallic sound and rending timbers, such as {{made by a}} falling boom." [...] Immediately afterward, an explosion occurred on the pier and a fire started. Five to seven seconds later a more powerful explosion took place as {{the majority of the}} ordnance within and near the SS E. A. Bryan detonated in a fireball seen for miles. An Army Air Forces pilot flying in the area reported that the fireball was [...] in diameter. Chunks of glowing hot metal and burning ordnance were flung over [...] into the air. The E. A. Bryan was completely destroyed and the Quinault was blown out of the water, torn into sections and thrown in several directions; the stern landed upside down in the water [...] away. The Coast Guard <b>fire</b> <b>boat</b> CG-60014-F was thrown [...] upriver, where it sank. The pier, along with its boxcars, locomotive, rails, cargo, and men, was blasted into pieces. Nearby boxcarswaiting within their revetments to be unloaded at midnightwere bent inward and crumpled by the force of the shock. The port's barracks and other buildings and much of the surrounding town were severely damaged. Shattering glass and a rain of jagged metal and undetonated munitions caused many more injuries among military personnel and civilians, although no one outside the immediate pier area was killed. Nearly $9.9million worth of damage ($million in [...] ) was caused to U.S. government property. Seismographs at the University of California, Berkeley sensed the two shock waves traveling through the ground, determining the second, larger event to be equivalent to an earthquake measuring 3.4 on the Richter magnitude scale.|$|E
2500|$|The steam tug El Toro {{was built}} at Newport News, Virginia by Newport News Shipbuilding for the Southern Pacific Railroad Company owned Morgan Line with {{delivery}} 20 May 1891. The tug {{was designed by}} naval architect Horace See with a quadruple expansion steam engine, then an unusual feature. El Toro was built principally as a <b>fire</b> <b>boat</b> with towing capability to tow the Morgan Line ships arriving or departing New York between the passenger terminal at North River Pier 37 and the cargo terminal at Pier 25. El Toro was the second ship, hull number 2, constructed by the then small shipyard, and its success led to building the line's cargo and passenger ships El Sud (hull #3), El Norte (#4), [...] and El Rio (#5) and El Cid (#6) as its next four ships.|$|E
2500|$|Waterfront Red Car [...] was a {{streetcar}} line {{connecting the}} World Cruise Center south to Ports O' Call and the 22nd St. terminal, where a shuttle bus connected other attractions along the San Pedro waterfront. Two newly constructed Red Car replicas, #500 & #501, provided service {{along the line}} on cruise ship arrival/departure days as well as weekends – Friday, Saturday and Sunday. In addition, a restored 1907-vintage Pacific Electric car, No. #1508 originally rebuilt from two wrecks as a unique motor coach, was available for special rail excursions. It began operation as a tourist attraction on July 19, 2003. The last day of service was on September 27, 2015. [...] The Port of Los Angeles financed, constructed and operated the replica equipment on heritage PE track, one of many of its waterfront revival projects. A new pedestrian esplanade featuring public art and fountains, sculpture and fountains was built alongside the track from the World Cruise Center to the Maritime Museum and <b>Fire</b> <b>Boat</b> Station. It connected to the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium and other San Pedro attractions when using the Waterfront Red Car trolley/shuttle. There were plans to extend the Waterfront Red Car line approximately two more miles south to the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium and the tidepools of Cabrillo Beach, which never came to pass. [...] Plans for {{an extension of the}} line north into Wilmington to Avalon Blvd. along existing trackage were discussed {{as a part of the}} waterfront improvement plan. These same plans led to this line being discontinued in favor of redevelopment. [...] Some transit advocates proposed linking this line to the Metro Blue Line Long Beach terminus, a very intensive and expensive expansion.|$|E
