30|$|Under {{scenario}} 1, mode changing cost (cost {{of providing}} mode changing facilities at multimodal terminals) {{is much lower}} than DC <b>establishment</b> <b>cost</b> (about one hundredth). Furthermore, transportation cost on road and railway networks, compare to seaway network, are triple and twice, respectively; and considered capacity for each DC is adequate to satisfy all retailers’ demands. Result show that under this scenario, only DC 1 (with lower <b>establishment</b> <b>cost)</b> established. Because of high DC <b>establishment</b> <b>cost,</b> when one DC can answer to all the retailers demand (high vehicle capacity), just one DC establishes. In this scenario, seaway has the lowest cost and mode changing cost is negligible. So multimodal route is consists of four seaway and one railway links and multimodal terminal established at node 2. Under scenario 2, mode changing cost is raised to 10, 000 (close to that of DC <b>establishment</b> <b>cost).</b> However, no change {{is seen in the}} results, i.e., seaway transportation still presents a costly justifiable approach, and similar to scenario 1, a multimodal terminal established at node 2. In scenario 3, mode changing cost is about five times larger than DC <b>establishment</b> <b>cost.</b> The results show that change in transportation mode is no longer economic, and multimodal route products transported from supplier to potential DC 1 along the railway network. With sufficient vehicle capacity for all the demands, only one DC is established. Under scenario 4, mode changing cost set to 10, 000 and vehicle capacity decreased to 70, so that a single DC cannot answer all the demands. In this scenario, both of DCs established with a different multimodal route and delivery tour for each DC. In scenario 5, differences between transportation costs for three modes are lower than previous scenarios. Again, mode changing cost and vehicle capacity are set to 10, 000 and 70, respectively. Results show that in the multimodal network, products are transport along road (due to lower distance) and seaway (due to lower cost) networks. Since DC capacity has not changed, retailer routes are the same. Sixth scenario is similar to previous scenario with raise in mode changing cost. In this scenario model, choose a multimodal route with no changing in modes, so railway network (due to its continuity from the supplier to DCs) is preferred over road network (with lower transportation distances) and seaway network (with lower costs). The results show that a change in vehicle capacity can change the number of established DCs and affect routs to retailers.|$|R

40|$|Due to low {{availability}} of coking coal and huge <b>establishment</b> <b>cost</b> of Blast Furnace plants, the predominant route of Iron making has meandered {{away from this}} conventional route to a modern route of Iron making. This route involves production of Directly Reduced Iron (DRI) using non-coking coal and gases as the reducing agent.

Since DRI can work with low quality non-coking coal, it makes the best possible usage of cheap coal available in India. High {{availability of}} low- quality and iron-ore and coal, the low <b>establishment</b> <b>cost</b> of DRI plants has over the years attracted multitude of opportunist to earn a fortune in this sector.

The roadside prices were 60 €/m 3 for pine and spruce saw log, 50 €/m 3 for birch saw log, and 30 €/m 3 for pulpwood.

According to these models the harvesting cost per removed cubic meter decreases with increasing mean size of harvested trees and increasing volume (m 3 /ha) of the harvest. Thinnings have a higher harvesting cost per cubic meter than clear-felling if the removed volume and mean size of removed trees are the same.
