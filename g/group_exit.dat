After the Maze, the group enter The Muffin Man's shop. Here, they prepare the recipe and however they are missing the final ingredient, The Essence of Ogre.

40|$|This phenomenological inquiry {{looked at}} 28 preservice {{teachers}} as {{they participated in}} a field-based curricula restructuring initiative that connected the disciplines of creative arts, science, and reading. The preservice teachers offered weekly interdisciplinary lessons to kindergarten and first grade students. A survey, teaching cases, and a <b>group</b> <b>exit</b> interview informed the study. Throughout most of the semester, the preservice teachers struggled with procedural and pedagogical content knowledge, concerns directly related to effective teaching. By {{the end of the}} semester, they felt comfortable teaching interdisciplinary lessons. Results suggest that preservice teacher curricular restructuring efforts are complex and that teacher educators need to consider the perspectives preservice teachers bring to the change process...|$|E
