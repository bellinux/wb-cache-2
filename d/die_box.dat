5000|$|The Box (<b>Die</b> <b>Box)</b> is a 2008 fictionalised {{autobiography}} by the German writer Günter Grass. It has {{the subtitle}} [...] "Tales from the Darkroom" [...] ("Dunkelkammergeschichten"). In the narrative, the 80-year-old Grass' eight children, at their father's request, record conversations {{where they say}} {{what they think of}} him. The Box follows the writer's previous memoir book, Peeling the Onion from 2006, which ended in 1959 with the literary success of The Tin Drum. It was followed by Grimm's Words in 2010.|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} {{an approach to}} Günter Grass’ biography based on the so-called "memory trilogy" consisting of the books Beim Häuten der Zwiebel (Peeling the Onion, 2006), <b>Die</b> <b>Box.</b> Dunkelkammergeschichten (The Box. Tales from the Darkroom, 2008) and Grimms Wörter. Eine Liebeserklärung (Grimms‘ Words. A Declaration of Love, 2010). On the one hand, Grass’s arguments for the need to write about one’s own life are presented together with the means which he used {{in order to do}} it, the metaphorical catalysts of memory: the onion, amber and literature. On the other hand, the words of the famous literary critic Marcel Reich-Ranicki, a Polish Jew by origin, about the controversial poem Was gesagt werden muss (What must be said, 2012) inspire the following attempt to work out and put in objective terms the biggest scandal in which Grass was involved ever, that is, the one that arised out of the publishing of Peeeling the Onion as the past of the Nobel laureate {{as a member of the}} Waffen-SS became public. This affair is specially studied in the article, as well as Günter Grass’s references to it until his passing in 2015. L’article presenta una aproximació a la biografia de Günter Grass a partir de l’anomenada “trilogia de la memòria” que conformen els volums Beim Häuten der Zwiebel (Tot pelant la ceba, 2006), <b>Die</b> <b>Box.</b> Dunkelkammergeschichten (La caixa dels desitjos. Històries d’una cambra fosca, 2008) i Grimms Wörter. Eine Liebeserklärung (Les paraules dels Grimm. Una declaració d’amor, 2010). D’una banda, se segueix l’argumentació de Grass de la necessitat d’escriure sobre la pròpia vida i dels mitjans que conjura per fer-ho, els catalitzadors metafòrics de la memòria: la ceba, l’ambre i la literatura. De l’altra, i recollint les paraules de l’insigne crític literari d’origen jueu polonès Marcel Reich-Ranicki sobre el controvertit poema Was gesagt werden muss (El que s’ha de dir, 2012), s’intenta desentrellar i objectivar l’escàndol més gran en què Grass es veié involucrat. La guspira que encengué aquell foc fou la publicació de Tot pelant la ceba, arran del descobriment del passat del premi Nobel a les Waffen-SS. A l’article se segueix especialment aquest assumpte i les diferents referències que hi fa Günter Grass fins a la seva mort el proppassat 2015...|$|E

40|$|With the {{competitive}} challenge facing business today, {{the need to}} keep cost down and quality up is a matter of survival. One way in which wire manufacturers can meet this challenge is to possess a thorough understanding of deformation, friction and lubrication during the wire drawing process, and therefore to make good decisions regarding the selection and application of lubricants as well as the die design. Friction, lubrication and die design during wire drawing thus become the subject of this study. Although theoretical and experimental investigations have been being carried out ever since the establishment of wire drawing technology, many problems remain unsolved. It is therefore necessary to conduct further research on traditional and fundamental subjects such as the mechanics of deformation, friction, lubrication and die design in wire drawing. Drawing experiments were carried out on an existing bull-block under different cross-sectional area reductions, different speeds and different lubricants. The instrumentation to measure drawing load and drawing speed was set up and connected to the wire drawing machine, together with a data acquisition system. A <b>die</b> <b>box</b> connected to the existing die holder for using dry soap lubricant was designed and tested. The experimental results in terms of drawing stress vs percentage area reduction curves under different drawing conditions were analysed and compared. The effects on drawing stress of friction, lubrication, drawing speed and pressure die nozzle are discussed. In order to determine the flow stress of the material during deformation, tensile tests were performed on an Instron universal test machine, using the wires drawn under different area reductions. A polynomial function is used to correlate the flow stress of the material with the plastic strain, on which a general computer program has been written to find out the coefficients of the stress-strain function. The residual lubricant film on the steel wire after drawing was examined both radially and longitudinally using an SEM and optical microscope. The lubricant film on the drawn wire was clearly observed. Therefore, the micro-analysis by SEM provides a way of friction and lubrication assessment in wire drawing...|$|E

The Mini Cooper in this larger size was made in 1:16 scale. As with most model makers, Solido also offered models in different promotional editions, like the Renault van decorated with [...] "Vote for Coluche" [...] markings.
