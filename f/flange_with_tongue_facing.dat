40|$|Effective and {{accurate}} diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus (DM), {{as well as}} its early stage Impaired Glucose Regulation (IGR), has attracted much attention recently. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) [3], [5] etc. has proved that <b>tongue,</b> <b>face</b> and sublingual diagnosis as a noninvasive method is a reasonable way for disease detection. However, most previous works only focus on a single modality (<b>tongue,</b> <b>face</b> or sublingual) for diagnosis, although different modalities may provide complementary information for the diagnosis of DM and IGR. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal classification method to discriminate between DM (or IGR) and healthy controls. Specially, the tongue, facial and sublingual images are first collected by using a non-invasive capture device. The color, texture and geometry features of these three types of images are then extracted, respectively. Finally, our so-called multi-modal similar and specific learning (MMSSL) approach is proposed to combine features of <b>tongue,</b> <b>face</b> and sublingual, which not only exploits the correlation but also extracts individual components among them. Experimental results on a dataset consisting of 192 Healthy, 198 DM and 114 IGR samples (all samples were obtained from Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine) substantiate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method for the diagnosis of DM and IGR, compared to the case of using a single modality.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} use of {{synthetic}} talking heads, <b>with</b> lip, <b>tongue</b> and <b>face</b> movements synchronized with synthesized or natural speech, in technology-enhanced learning. This work applies talking heads in a speech tutoring application for teaching English as a second language. Previous {{studies have shown that}} speech perception is aided by visual information, but {{more research is needed to}} determine the effectiveness of visualization of articulators in pronunciation training. This thesis explores whether or not visual speech technology can give an improvement in learning pronunciation. This thesis investigates techniques for audiovisual speech synthesis, using both viseme-based and data-driven approaches to implement multiple talking heads. Intelligibility studies found the audiovisual heads to be more intelligible than audio alone, and the data-driven head was found to be more intelligible than the viseme-driven implementation. The talking heads are applied in a pronunciation-training application, which is evaluated by second-language learners to investigate the benefit of visual speech in technology-enhanced learning. User trials explored the efficacy of the software in demonstrating the /b/–/p/ contrast in English. The results indicate that learners showed an improvement in listening and pronunciation after using the software, while the benefit of visualization compared to auditory training alone varied between individuals. User evaluations found that the talking heads were perceived to be helpful in learning pronunciation, and the positive feedback on the tutoring system suggests that {{the use of}} talking heads in technology-enhanced learning could be useful in addition to traditional methods. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{involved}} the parametric analysis of bolted flange connections of eighteen different circular monopoles. The parameters considered were {{the number of}} bolts (8, 6, and 4) and thickness of flange plate [25. 4 mm (1. 0 in.), 19. 05 mm (0. 75 in.) and 12. 7 mm (0. 50 in.) ]. These were analyzed under stiffened and unstiffened conditions. Four, two and four stiffeners, 12. 7 mm (0. 50 in.) thick, were used with 8 -, 6 - and 4 -bolt arrangements. Each finite element model {{is made up of}} a small diameter (171. 5 mm) circular pipe and a large diameter (327 mm) circular pipe both welded to circular flanges. The outer and inner diameters of the flange plates were 327 mm and 171. 5 mm respectively. Each bolt was 25. 4 mm (1 in.) diameter and was pretensioned to 227 kN (51 kips); and an external load of 45 kN (10 kips) was applied at the free end of the monopole, 1804 mm (71 in.) from the bolted joint, in the Riks analysis load step of ABAQUS (version 6. 3) computer program. From the finite element analysis, it was found that monopoles (8 bolts, 6 bolts and 4 bolts) with unstiffened 12. 7 mm (0. 50 in.) thick flange plates experienced a large deformation because of the thin flange plate. Optimum solutions to stiffened and unstiffened connections were found to be among those monopoles with minimal gap, deflection and deformation, i. e., 25. 4 mm (1 in.) thick <b>flanges</b> <b>with</b> 4 bolts or 19. 05 mm (0. 75 in.) thick <b>flanges</b> <b>with</b> 6 bolts for unstiffened case; and 12. 7 mm (0. 50 in.) thick <b>flanges</b> <b>with</b> 8 bolts, 25. 4 mm (1 in.) thick <b>flanges</b> <b>with</b> 4 bolts or 19. 05 mm (0. 75 in.) thick <b>flanges</b> <b>with</b> 6 bolts for stiffened case. In addition to the parametric study, T-Stub and yield line analytical procedures were also presented with examples; and {{it was found that the}} analytical methods provide good preliminary guidance regarding connection parameters when designing bolted flange connections for circular monopoles.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a new metal forming process for producing two-step external flanges on hollow parts. With this method, the flange is extruded by a movable sleeve, which {{moves in the}} opposite direction to the punch. This reduces the phenomenon of buckling of the tube wall, which allows extruding <b>flanges</b> <b>with</b> relatively large volumes. The new method was applied to produce a two-step flange {{on the end of a}} tubular billet made of 6060 aluminum alloy. This cold metal forming process was designed based on numerical simulations and experimental tests. The effect of the basic technological parameters on metal flow was investigated and limitations of the process were identified. The experimental results confirmed the possibility of forming a two-step <b>flange</b> <b>with</b> a diameter that is approximately twice as big as the external diameter of the tubular billet...|$|R

30|$|The entire {{setup is}} housed in a four-fold {{differentially}} pumped vacuum chamber. The four chambers, {{described in more detail}} in the next sections, are a source chamber, a chamber housing the guides, a chamber where the collisions are detected, and a chamber to characterise the two molecular beams. Source and guide chamber are constructed using ISO-F and ISO-K type <b>flanges</b> <b>with</b> Viton or other rubber gaskets. The last two use CF <b>flanges</b> <b>with</b> copper gaskets. The adapter tube to make the transition between these standards is also the one that provides the kink, which is necessary because of the bend in the guides. A commercial half-nipple <b>with</b> an ISO-F <b>flange</b> was welded to a CF <b>flange</b> <b>with</b> a 10 -degree tilt between the flange faces. This separation in two standards was chosen for simplicity (and cost), and because other than continuity {{there is no reason to}} use the CF standard on a source chamber where the pressure during operation usually lies above 10 − 5 mbar. Our target pressure for the guide and collision chambers was in the range of 10 − 8 mbar. Even in that range no significant losses are to be expected from collisions of guided molecules with background gas. Bake-out of the apparatus is not only not required, it also is not possible because the permanent magnets must be expected to start demagnetising at temperatures above ≈ 60 °C.|$|R
