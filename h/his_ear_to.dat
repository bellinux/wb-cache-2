5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) later {{encounters}} {{the stranger}} {{as she walks}} into an elevator. Both ride in silence up to the fourth floor, with Scully somewhat unsettled by the experience. At Fox Mulder's (David Duchovny) apartment, Mulder and Scully begin discussing a case the pair are working on, wherein {{the heart of the}} victim had been removed with the absence of any significant physical evidence. Mulder believes the heart was removed with a technique known as psychic surgery. Meanwhile, Padgett, who is Mulder's neighbor, stands on a chair with <b>his</b> <b>ear</b> <b>to</b> an air vent, listening to the conversation.|$|E
25|$|While Sykes and Haytham {{watch the}} {{entrance}} to the complex, al-Ghazi, Fleury, and Mayes follow a blood trail and kill many gunmen inside. Mayes, separated from the others, finds Leavitt and his attackers, preparing an execution video of Leavitt. She kills the remaining insurgents, and al-Ghazi and the team start to leave. Fleury then realizes there is a trail of blood leading {{to the back of the}} apartment, and al-Ghazi sees the grandfather and inspects his hand. When the old man gives him his hand, al-Ghazi sees that the man is missing the same fingers as Abu Hamza al-Masri in the terrorist group's many videos and confirms his suspicion that the grandfather is the terrorist leader. Abu Hamza's teenage grandson walks out of the bedroom and shoots al-Ghazi in the neck, then he starts to point his gun at Mayes, prompting Fleury to kill him. Abu Hamza then pulls out an assault rifle and Haytham kills him. As Abu Hamza dies, another grandchild hugs him and Abu Hamza whispers something into <b>his</b> <b>ear</b> <b>to</b> calm the child down. Al-Ghazi dies in Fleury's arms.|$|E
500|$|Loup is a left-handed pitcher, or southpaw. He {{struggled}} {{at first}} with pitching until minor league pitching instructor Dane Johnson and Dunedin pitching coach Darold Knowles {{told him to}} lower his arm and {{become more of a}} sidearm pitcher. Now, as he pitches, he tracks a plane from <b>his</b> <b>ear</b> <b>to</b> his shoulder, which also helped his effectiveness against left-handed batters. His slider and fastball improved drastically, but his changeup continued to struggle, and Loup says that he is still a little inconsistent with it. He can throw a low-90s [...] "breaking" [...] fastball that is just as effective against right-handed batters as left-handed batters. John Farrell, a previous Toronto Blue Jays manager, said that it was [...] " [...] poise and his presence that allows him to maintain not only composure, but the ability to execute." [...] Blue Jays' bullpen coach Pat Hentgen says that Loup [...] "keeps things simple, he doesn't over-think. He stays aggressive. He's got a lot of guts, goes right after hitters and you combine all those things and you're going to have the success that he's had." [...] One reporter compared Loup to Bran Flakes, stating that [...] "ou know exactly what you're going to get from him every time he takes the mound and he's not going to add any excitement to any situation." ...|$|E

500|$|While Sinatra never {{formally}} {{learned how}} to read music, he had a fine, natural understanding of it, and he worked very hard from a young age to improve his abilities {{in all aspects of}} music. He did, however, learn to follow a lead sheet during a performance by [...] "carefully following the patterns and groupings of notes arranged on the page" [...] and made his own notations to the music, using <b>his</b> <b>ear</b> <b>to</b> detect semi-tonal differences. Granata states that some of the most accomplished classically trained musicians soon noticed his musical understanding, and remarked that Sinatra had a [...] "sixth sense", which [...] "demonstrated unusual proficiency when it came to detecting incorrect notes and sounds within the orchestra". Sinatra was an aficionado of classical music, and would often request classical strains in his music, inspired by composers such as Puccini and Impressionist masters. His personal favorite was Ralph Vaughan Williams. [...] He would insist on always recording live with the band because it gave him a [...] "certain feeling" [...] to perform live surrounded by musicians. By the mid 1940s, such was his understanding of music that after hearing an air check of some compositions by Alec Wilder which were for strings and woodwinds, he became the conductor at Columbia Records for six of Wilder's compositions: [...] "Air for Oboe", [...] "Air for English Horn", [...] "Air for Flute", [...] "Air for Bassoon", [...] "Slow Dance" [...] and [...] "Theme and Variations". The works, which combine elements of jazz and classical music, were considered by Wilder to have been among the finest renditions and recordings of his compositions, past or present. At one recording session with arranger Claus Ogerman and an orchestra, Sinatra heard [...] "a couple of little strangers" [...] in the string section, prompting Ogerman to make corrections to what were thought to be copyist's errors. Critic Gene Lees, a lyricist {{and the author of the}} words to the Jobim melody [...] "This Happy Madness", expressed amazement when he heard Sinatra's recording of it on Sinatra & Company (1971), considering him to have delivered the lyrics to perfection.|$|E

2500|$|... 'Wind Tunnel Waldo' had slicked back {{hair that}} {{appeared}} to be constantly wind blown.

2500|$|During the Taste of Chaos tour in March of that year, guitarist Curtis Ward {{left the}} band. Ward's {{relationship}} deteriorated {{with the band}} as his stage performances were poor and he was abusive to the audience during Taste of Chaos, and he contributed little to the writing of Suicide Season. Other reasons included Ward's worsening tinnitus in his one functioning ear. Ward was born deaf in one ear and admitted playing in the band worsened the ringing in <b>his</b> <b>ear</b> <b>to</b> {{such a degree that}} he couldn't sleep at night. Regardless, Ward offered to perform the rest of the tour dates to which the band rejected and instead asked their guitar technician, Dean Rowbotham, to substitute for him {{over the course of the}} remaining performances. Lee Malia noted that Ward's departure helped improve everyone else's mood as he was very negative. Within a week of the tour, finishing Sykes started talking to Jona Weinhofen, at the time the guitarist of Bleeding Through and former member of I Killed the Prom Queen, which the band knew him through. He then was asked to join on a permanent basis. Ward has since worked on the TV show Top Gear and has occasionally performed on stage with Bring Me The Horizon, playing [...] "Pray For Plagues", most notably at Wembley Arena in 2015. In 2016, it was announced that Ward had joined the band Counting Days.|$|E
2500|$|The album's {{opening track}} [...] "War Pigs" [...] was {{originally}} intended to be called [...] "Walpurgis". It was then changed to [...] "War Pigs", which the band intended to name the album until it was changed to Paranoid after the record company became convinced that {{the song of the}} same name had potential as a single. [...] Butler explained his intentions to Classic Albums: [...] "I wanted to write a song called 'Walpurgis' you know, the Satanic version of Christmas write it about that Satan isn't a spiritual thing, it's warmongers. That's who the real Satanists are, all these people who are running the banks and the world and trying to get the working class to fight the wars for them. We sent it off to the record company and they said, 'No, we're not going to call it that. Too Satanic!' So I changed it to 'War Pigs'." [...] In his autobiography I Am Ozzy, vocalist Ozzy Osbourne recalls, [...] "It was originally going to be called 'Walpurgis'... which was a term for a black magic wedding or something. Then we changed it to 'War Pigs', and Geezer came up with these heavy duty lyrics about death and destruction. No wonder we never got any chicks at our gigs. Geezer just wasn't interested in your average 'I love you' pop song... Geezer also liked {{to put a lot of}} topical stuff, like Vietnam references, into our songs. He had <b>his</b> <b>ear</b> <b>to</b> the ground, Geezer did." ...|$|E

60|$|At {{this point}} Mr. Rabbit ceased {{speaking}} abruptly, moving <b>his</b> <b>ears</b> <b>to</b> and fro nervously {{as if he}} had heard something disagreeable, and common courtesy demanded that the silence should not be broken save by himself.|$|R

60|$|His words {{seemed to}} rouse Walker, for {{he opened his}} eyes once more, and now they were all misty. He wanted to speak, but he was so weak that Mackintosh had <b>to</b> strain <b>his</b> <b>ears</b> <b>to</b> catch what he said.|$|R
