5|$|In {{addition}} to taking the written exam, {{all of the}} applicants {{had to take a}} horse-riding test as well. Having grown up riding horses on his family's plantation, Middleton scored very well on this exam, and the officer in charge thought that he would want to <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> cavalry. Middleton, however, wanted to <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> infantry, leaving the officer stunned that anyone with such horsemanship skills would even consider spending his time walking instead of riding a fine horse.|$|E

Among Borislow's first acquisitions was broodmare Beautiful Bid, who gave birth to Breeders' Cup Distaff winner and Eclipse champion Beautiful Pleasure. In 2000, he sold Beautiful Bid for $2.6 million.|$|E

5|$|The siting of noxious industries, such as tanning and fulling {{downwind}} {{outside the}} boundaries of the City, and therefore beyond complaints and official controls.

Another family connection to cricket was his first cousin, Mary Duggan, who was a women's Test player for England from 1948 to 1963.|$|E

5|$|If the ionic {{compound}} is soluble in a solvent, it can {{be obtained}} as a solid compound by evaporating the solvent from this electrolyte solution. As the solvent is evaporated, the ions do not <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> vapour, but stay in the remaining solution, and when they become sufficiently concentrated, nucleation occurs, and they crystallize into an ionic compound. This process occurs widely in nature, and is the means of formation of the evaporite minerals. Another method of recovering the compound from solution involves saturating a solution at high temperature and then reducing the solubility by reducing the temperature until the solution is supersaturated and the solid compound nucleates.|$|E
