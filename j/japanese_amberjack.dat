5|$|S. iniae {{is highly}} {{pathogenic}} in freshwater, marine, and euryhaline fish, and is highly lethal: outbreaks {{may be associated}} with 30–50% mortality. It is, therefore, one of the foremost economically important pathogens in intensive aquaculture. In 1997, the global economic impact of S.iniae infection to the aquaculture industry was estimated at US$100million (one-tenth of which in the United States). As of 2007, infection had been reported in 27 species of fish, including tilapia (genus Oreochromis and Tilapia), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), <b>Japanese</b> <b>amberjack</b> (Seriola quinqueradiata), red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), and barramundi (Lates calcarifer, which can be an asymptomatic carrier). Common carp (Cyprinus carpio), channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), and goldfish (Carassius auratus) appear to be resistant. Fish raised in intensive aquaculture operations and subject to environmental stressors (i.e. suboptimal temperature, poor water quality, crowding, handling, etc.) are most prone to S.iniae infection. Wild fish populations located both near and far from aquaculture operations have also proven susceptible to S.iniae infection.|$|E

40|$|A {{method was}} {{developed}} and applied for monitoring two types of fast-start locomotion (feeding and escape) of a cruiser fish, <b>Japanese</b> <b>amberjacks</b> Seriola quinqueradiata. A data logger, which incorporated a 3 -axis gyroscope, a 3 -axis accelerometer and a 3 -axis magnetometer, {{was attached to the}} five fish. The escape, feeding and routine movements of the fish, which were triggered in tank experiments, were then recorded by the data logger and video cameras. The locomotor variables, calculated based on the high resolution measurements by the data logger (500 Hz), were investigated to accurately detect and classify the types of fast-track behaviour. The results show that fast-start locomotion can be detected with a high precision (0. 97) and recall rate (0. 96) from the routine movements. Two types of fast-start movements were classified with high accuracy (0. 84). Accuracy was greater if the data were obtained from the data logger, which combined an accelerometer, a gyroscope and a magnetometer, than if only an accelerometer (0. 80) or a gyroscope (0. 66) was used...|$|R

5000|$|John Archibald Bole, Jr. (born in Elmhurst, New York, 28 March 1906, died near New Britain, Territory of New Guinea, 16 February 1943), was a United States Navy officer. He {{graduated}} from the United States Naval Academy in 1928. After serving in Tennessee (BB-43), he underwent submarine training. Bole subsequently served in a succession of submarines, taking command of S-21 in June 1940.

5000|$|Inosine {{has also}} {{been found to be}} an {{important}} feed stimulant by itself or in combination with certain amino acids in some species of farmed fish. For example, inosine and inosine-5-monophosphate have been reported as specific feeding stimulants for turbot fry, (Scophthalmus maximus) [...] and <b>Japanese</b> <b>amberjack,</b> (Seriola quinqueradiata). The main problem of using inosine and/or inosine-5-monophosphate as feeding attractants is their high cost. However, their use may be economically justified within larval feeds for marine fish larvae during the early weaning period, since the total quantity of feed consumed is relatively low.|$|E
50|$|Coastal fishing {{by small}} boats, set nets, or {{breeding}} techniques {{accounts for about}} {{one third of the}} industry's total production, while offshore fishing by medium-sized boats makes up for more than half the total production. Deep-sea fishing from larger vessels makes up the rest. Among the many species of seafood caught are sardines, skipjack tuna, crab, shrimp, salmon, pollock, squid, clams, mackerel, sea bream, sauries, tuna and <b>Japanese</b> <b>amberjack.</b> Freshwater fishing, including salmon, trout and eel hatcheries and fish farms, takes up about 30% of Japan's fishing industry. Among the nearly 300 fish species in the rivers of Japan are native varieties of catfish, chub, herring and goby, as well as such freshwater crustaceans as crabs and crayfish. Marine and freshwater aquaculture is conducted in all 47 prefectures in Japan.|$|E
5000|$|For culinary, sanitary, and {{aesthetic}} reasons, the minimum quality and freshness of fish {{to be eaten}} raw must be superior to that of fish {{which is to be}} cooked. Sushi chefs are trained to recognize important attributes, including smell, color, firmness, and freedom from parasites that may go undetected in commercial inspection. Commonly used fish are tuna (maguro, shiro-maguro), <b>Japanese</b> <b>amberjack,</b> yellowtail (hamachi), snapper (kurodai), mackerel (saba), and salmon (sake). The most valued sushi ingredient is toro, the fatty cut of the fish. This comes in a variety of ōtoro (often from the bluefin species of tuna) and chūtoro, meaning [...] "middle toro", implying that it is halfway into the fattiness between toro and the regular cut. Aburi style refers to nigiri sushi where the fish is partially grilled (topside) and partially raw. Most nigiri sushi will have completely raw neta.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A winter {{outbreak}} of ascites in cultured <b>Japanese</b> <b>amberjack</b> Seriola quinqueradiata was examined. Affected fish displayed bloody ascitic fluid in the peritoneal cavity, their hearts {{were covered with}} a white membrane, their livers were congested and their kidneys were swollen. Renal tubular epithelia displayed extensive necrosis and often contained hyaline droplets, while some glomeruli showed atrophy and necrosis. Hematopoietic tissue in the kidney contained some swollen reticular cells. In the heart, an inflammatory reaction accompanied by edema, hemorrhage and fibrin deposition occurred in the epicardium of the atrium and ventricle and in the pericardial cavity. The epicardium and pericardium were partially adhered to each other. Hepatic lesions included dilatation of sinusoids accompanied by severe edema and congestion. Edema and fibrin deposition were often observed in the hepatic serosa and perivascular tissue. Splenic tissues with atrophied pulp showed definite increases in trabecula thickness.

40|$|In a {{world where}} the global {{population}} is expected to grow by another 2 billion to reach 9. 6 billion people by 2050 and where more than 800 million continue to suffer from chronic hunger we must meet the huge challenge of feeding our planet while safeguarding its natural resources for future generations. (SOFIA, 2014). Global fish production has grown steadily in the last five decades, with food fish supply increasing at an average annual rate of 3. 2 percent, outpacing world population growth at 1. 6 percent. Cage culture systems employed by farmers are currently as diverse as the number of species currently being raised, varying from traditional family-owned and operated cage farming operations (typical of most Asian countries) to modern commercial large-scale salmon and trout cage farming operations in northern Europe and the America. Commercial cage culture has beenmainly restricted to the culture of higher-value (in marketing terms) compound-feed-fed finfish species, including salmon (Atlantic salmon, cohosalmon and Chinook salmon), most major marineand freshwater carnivorous fish species (including <b>Japanese</b> <b>amberjack,</b> red seabream, yellow croaker, European seabass, gilthead seabream, cobia, Rainbow trout, Mandarin fish, snakehead) and an ever increasing proportion of omnivorous freshwater fish species (including Chinese carps, tilapia, Colossoma, and catfish).
