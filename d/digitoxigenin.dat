50|$|Digitalis ciliata is used {{to isolate}} cardenolide glycolosides and is {{abundant}} in basically all of the glycosides that the Digitalis genus is known for. These common glycosides include <b>digitoxigenin,</b> gitoxigenin, digoxigenin, gitaloxigenin, and diginatigenin.|$|E
50|$|The {{literature}} on cerberin toxicity, per se, remains sparse; unless otherwise specifically indicated, {{the following is}} general information regarding cardiac glycoside toxicity, {{with an emphasis on}} information from cardenolides (i.e., steroid natural products bearing the same <b>digitoxigenin</b> substructure).|$|E
50|$|Many {{types of}} sugars can be {{attached}} to cardiac glycosides; {{in the case of}} cerberin, it is an O-acetylated derivative of α-L-thevetose, which is itself a derivative of L-glucose (6-deoxy-3-O-methyl-α-L-glucopyranose). The cardenolide substructure to which the sugar is attached has also been independently characterised, and can be referred to as <b>digitoxigenin</b> (see image), hence, cerberin is, synonymously, (L-2'-O-acetylthevetosyl)digitoxigenin. As well, the non-acetylated structure was independently discovered and named neriifolin, and so cerberin is, synonymously, 2'-acetylneriifolin.|$|E
50|$|Digitoxin {{and related}} cardenolides display potent anticancer {{activity}} against {{a range of}} human cancer cell lines in vitro but the clinical use of digitoxin to treat cancer has been restricted by its narrow therapeutic index.

It showed by X-ray diffraction an axial orientation of the angular methyl group and an equatorial orientation of the hydroxyl group in the chair conformer of the six-membered ring. This is in good agreement with the crystal structure of the CD-ring of <b>digitoxigenin.</b> The structure of this ketol and its ethyl homologue are shown as follows.|$|E
50|$|Neoglycorandomization is a chemoselective glycodiversification method {{inspired}} by the alkoxyamine-based ‘neoglycosylation’ reaction first described Peri and Dumy. This reaction proceeds via an oxy-iminium intermediate to ultimately provide the more thermodynamically-favored closed ring neoglycoside. The neoglycosylation reaction is compatible {{with a wide range}} of saccharide and aglycon functionality where neoglycoside anomeric stereospecificity is a thermodynamically-driven. Importantly, structural and functional studies reveal neoglycosides to serve as good mimics of their O-glycosidic comparators. The first neoglycorandomization proof of concept focused upon digitoxin where the rapid generation and cancer cell line cytotoxicity screening of 78 <b>digitoxigenin</b> neoglycosides revealed unique analogs with improved anticancer activity and reduced potential for cardiotoxicity. This platform has since been automated and used as an effective medicinal chemistry tool to modulate the properties of a range of natural products and pharmaceutical drugs.|$|E
50|$|The {{species is}} adapted to sunny and warm sites on dry, mostly on sandy and stony loamy soil. During the first {{vegetation}} period, only the leaf rosette is developed, flowering follows during the second vegetation period. Therefore, especially during the first year, {{there is a high}} resistance against water stress (drought stress). Indeed, the leaves remain turgescent even under very low leaf water potential, due to osmotic adaptation by synthesis of non-ionic substances in the leaves. The drought induced diminishing of photosynthesis is reversible after a few hours following watering of the plants. Drought stress also reduces the quantum yield of photosystem 2. More than 70 bitter glycosides with cardiac activity, with five different aglyconees <b>digitoxigenin,</b> gitoxigenin, digoxigenin, diginatigenin and gitaloxigenin in the leaves act as a protection against herbivores. Yield and concentration of these cardiac glycosides are enhanced by greenhouse cultivation through enhanced temperature and enhanced carbon dioxide concentration.|$|E

Chemical work has now been extended to <b>digitoxigenin,</b> digoxigenin, and periplogenin at the Depart-ment of Chemistry, Columbia University (3). By the reaction of one molecule of glucose with the secondary OH group on carbon atom S of each aglycone, glucosides of <b>digitoxigenin,</b> digoxigenin, and periplogenin were successfully synthesized.

40|$|AbstractThe {{expression}} of the canine α 2 and 3 subunit isoenzymes of NA,K-ATPase has been investigated in plasma membranes isolated from dog heart, brain and kidney by immunoblotting, employing polyclonal anti rat fusion protein, and enzymological techniques. Western blot analysis revealed with purified dog membrane Na,K-ATPase preparations, one immunoreactive signal with rat specific α 3 antisera in cardiac tissues, and two immunoreactive signals with rat α 3 and α 3 antisera in cerebral tissues. These findings suggested the specific {{expression of}} α 3 polypeptide in dog heart (99 kDa), whereas dog brain expressed the α 2 and 3 polypeptides. The stained bands were superimposed. The antibody to rat brain α 1 fusion protein did not cross-react with dog antigens whatever the three tissues tested.
