5|$|A {{distinctive}} bird, the blue-faced honeyeater differs in coloration {{from the}} duller-plumaged friarbirds, miners and wattlebirds, and it <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>larger</b> than the similarly coloured Melithreptus honeyeaters. Subspecies albipennis with its white wing patch has been likened to a khaki-backed butcherbird in flight.|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} {{have very}} large aspect ratio, i.e., their length <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>larger</b> than their diameter. Consequently, as {{expected from the}} classical electromagnetic theory, elastic light scattering (or Rayleigh scattering) by straight CNTs has anisotropic angular dependence, and from its spectrum, the band gaps of individual nanotubes can be deduced.|$|E

Nowadays the canals are mainly used for leisure purposes, and canalside regeneration schemes such as Brindleyplace have turned the canals into tourist attractions.|$|E
5|$|Display of British and Singapore ensigns on island. Ensigns, {{associated}} with maritime matters, are marks of nationality and not sovereignty. Singapore had also not demonstrated any sovereign intent in the flying of the British and Singapore ensigns from Horsburgh Lighthouse. The Pulau Pisang incident {{was not an}} acknowledgement by Malaysia of Singapore's sovereignty over Pedra Branca; {{it had been a}} matter of domestic political sensibility – Pulau Pisang <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>larger</b> than Pedra Branca and has a small local population.|$|E
5|$|For giant stars, the {{atmospheric}} microturbulence {{can result in}} line broadening that <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>larger</b> than effects of rotational, effectively drowning out the signal. However, an alternate approach can be employed that makes use of gravitational microlensing events. These occur when a massive object passes {{in front of the}} more distant star and functions like a lens, briefly magnifying the image. The more detailed information gathered by this means allows the effects of microturbulence to be distinguished from rotation.|$|E

5|$|Grand Theft Auto V is an action-adventure {{game played}} from either a first-person or third-person perspective. Players {{complete}} missions—linear scenarios with set objectives—to {{progress through the}} story. Outside the missions, players may freely roam the open world. Composed of the San Andreas open countryside area and the fictional city of Los Santos, the world <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>larger</b> in area than earlier entries in the series. It may be fully explored after the game's beginning without restriction, although story progress unlocks more gameplay content.|$|E
5|$|Immature American {{white and}} scarlet ibises are very {{difficult}} to tell apart, although scarlet ibises tend to have darker legs and bare skin around the face. An immature American white ibis could be mistaken for an immature glossy ibis, but the latter is wholly dark brown and lacks the white belly and rump. The adult is distinguishable from the wood stork, which <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>larger</b> and its wings have more black on them.|$|E
5|$|The most similar European thrush {{species is}} the redwing (T. iliacus), but that bird {{has a strong}} white supercilium, red flanks, and shows a red underwing in flight. The mistle thrush (T. viscivorus) <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>larger</b> and has white tail corners, and the Chinese thrush (T. mupinensis), {{although}} much more similar in plumage, has black face markings and does not overlap in range.|$|E

5|$|This {{is because}} land birds in high {{northern}} latitudes, where food becomes scarce in winter, leave for areas further south (including the Southern Hemisphere) to overwinter, {{and because the}} continental landmass <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>larger</b> in the Northern Hemisphere. In contrast, among (pelagic) seabirds, species of the Southern Hemisphere {{are more likely to}} migrate. This is because there is a large area of ocean in the Southern Hemisphere, and more islands suitable for seabirds to nest.|$|E

The high school has 123 classrooms {{with the capacity}} of holding approximately 2,100 students. The building also has a 750-seat auditorium with {{a large amount of}} natural light. The football stadium seats 4,000 people and the gymnasium seats 2,500.|$|E
5|$|Australia's defence {{expenditure}} <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>larger</b> in dollar terms {{to that of}} most countries in Australia's region. The share of GDP Australia spends on defence is also larger than that in most developed economies and major South-East Asian countries. China spends somewhat more on defence {{as a proportion of}} GDP than Australia does, and has been rapidly increasing its expenditure. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute has estimated that Australia's defence spending in 2015 was the 13th highest of any country in real terms. As a proportion of GDP Australia's defence spending ranks as 49th of the countries for which data is available.|$|E

5|$|Grand Theft Auto: Vice City is an action-adventure {{game played}} from a third-person perspective. The player {{controls}} the criminal Tommy Vercetti and completes missions—linear scenarios with set objectives—to {{progress through the}} story. It is possible to have several active missions running at one time, as some missions require the player to wait for further instructions or events. Outside of missions, the player can freely roam the game's open world and {{has the ability to}} complete optional side missions. Composed of two main islands and several smaller areas, the world <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>larger</b> in area than earlier entries in the series. The islands are unlocked for the player as the story progresses.|$|E
5|$|Males, {{females and}} juveniles each form {{separate}} social groups. The male groups are the smallest; the members stay together {{and search for}} food or water sources. The female group <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>larger</b> and covers greater areas. They travel the grassy plains in wet periods and prefer bushy areas in dry periods. Females have a complex linear hierarchy. The nursery and juvenile group is naturally formed when females give birth to calves. After about 24 hours of the delivery, the mother and calf join this group. The calves start befriending each other and stay back in the nursery group while the mother returns to the female group. The calves leave the nursery group when they {{are at least two}} years old and join a male or female group.|$|E
5|$|On an {{ordinary}} day at Springfield Elementary, Lisa {{attempts to make}} friends with a new girl, Francine (who <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>larger</b> and tougher than Lisa), but Francine beats up Lisa severely. Even attempting to share an interest in Malibu Stacy does not work since the doll that Francine has turns out to be Lisa's, which she then ruins. Lisa attempts to hire the school bullies (Nelson, Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney) to protect her, but they decline since girls fight dirtier than boys (and boys tend to be more vulnerable to falling in love). It is up to Lisa to investigate by herself the reason why Francine is targeting her.|$|E

5|$|The {{mistle thrush}} <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>larger,</b> paler and longer-tailed than the {{sympatric}} song thrush. In the western Himalayas {{it could be}} confused with both the plain-backed and the long-tailed thrushes. These {{are similar to the}} mistle thrush, but the plain–backed thrush lacks obvious wing bars, is more rufous above than its relative, and is barred rather than spotted below. The long-tailed thrush has olive-toned upperparts, bars on its breast and two wing bars. Juvenile mistle thrushes are superficially similar to White's thrush, but that species has golden-yellow plumage, scalloped underparts and a distinctive underwing pattern.|$|E
5|$|A {{nitrogen}} atom {{has seven}} electrons. In the ground state, they {{are arranged in}} the electron configuration 1s2s2p2p2p. It therefore has five valence electrons in the 2s and 2p orbitals, three of which (the p-electrons) are unpaired. It {{has one of the}} highest electronegativities among the elements (3.04 on the Pauling scale), exceeded only by chlorine (3.16), oxygen (3.44), and fluorine (3.98). Following periodic trends, its single-bond covalent radius of 71pm is smaller than those of boron (84pm) and carbon (76pm), while it is larger than those of oxygen (66pm) and fluorine (57pm). The nitride anion, N3−, <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>larger</b> at 146pm, similar to that of the oxide (O2−: 140pm) and fluoride (F−: 133pm) anions. The first three ionisation energies of nitrogen are 1.402, 2.856, and 4.577MJ·mol−1, and the sum of the fourth and fifth is 16.920MJ·mol−1. Due to these very high figures, nitrogen has no simple cationic chemistry.|$|E
5|$|The deep nuclei of the {{cerebellum}} are {{clusters of}} gray matter lying {{within the white}} matter {{at the core of}} the cerebellum. They are, with the minor exception of the nearby vestibular nuclei, the sole sources of output from the cerebellum. These nuclei receive collateral projections from mossy fibers and climbing fibers as well as inhibitory input from the Purkinje cells of the cerebellar cortex. The four nuclei (dentate, globose, emboliform, and fastigial) each communicate with different parts of the brain and cerebellar cortex. (The globose and the emboliform nuclei are also referred to as combined in the interposed nucleus). The fastigial and interposed nuclei belong to the spinocerebellum. The dentate nucleus, which in mammals <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>larger</b> than the others, is formed as a thin, convoluted layer of gray matter, and communicates exclusively with the lateral parts of the cerebellar cortex. The flocculonodular lobe is the only part of the cerebellar cortex that does not project to the deep nuclei—its output goes to the vestibular nuclei instead.|$|E
