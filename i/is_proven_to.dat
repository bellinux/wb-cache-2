5|$|Evidence {{found in}} Chinese literature, and archaeological evidence, show that {{cartography}} existed in China before the Han. Some {{of the earliest}} Han maps discovered were ink-penned silk maps found amongst the Mawangdui Silk Texts in a 2nd-century-BC tomb. The general Ma Yuan created the world's first known raised-relief map from rice in the 1st century AD. This date could be revised if the tomb of Emperor Qin Shi Huang is excavated and the account in the Records of the Grand Historian concerning a model map of the empire <b>is</b> <b>proven</b> <b>to</b> be true.|$|E

Later, a large quantity of suspicious ash found in a nearby park <b>is</b> <b>proven</b> <b>to</b> be from human remains. A private investigative organisation, the Millennium Group, dispatches offender profiler Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) and colleague Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) to investigate the multiple homicide that led to this. Black believes that the victims were burnt alive; while chemical analysis of the ash leads the Group to the same factory.|$|E

25|$|Current {{biological}} {{research has}} suggested that testosterone differences can affect sexual orientation, gender identity, and personality. For example, girls with increased prenatal testosterone levels, due to congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), show more male-typed behaviors than the average female. This may cause a decrease in empathy levels, which <b>is</b> <b>proven</b> <b>to</b> be higher in the average women than men, and an increase in physical aggression, typically higher in men than women. Furthermore, multiple twin studies have also shown that homosexual traits displayed greater congruence in monozygotic (MZ) twins than dizygotic (DZ) twins displaying genetic contributions. Further studies reveal that {{this is especially true for}} girls' gender-typed values. Similarly, other studies have summarized that the prevalence of cross-gender behavior a highly heritable trait where MZ twins display the same cross-gender behaviors more so than DZ twins.|$|E
25|$|When {{a serial}} killer dubbed The Salem Stalker starts wreaking havoc around town, killing many friends, {{including}} Roman, John and Marlena are worried about what could happen to them. The killer, though, is later revealed to be Marlena, though John believes {{she was forced to}} by someone else. Marlena is arrested, and sent to prison, while John tries to clear her name. Marlena tries to escape, and is killed by police fire. However, she's later found alive with all of her victims on Melaswen Island, and it's revealed she was brainwashed by Andre DiMera into committing the murders. She reunites with John, but soon after, Marlena finds out she's pregnant with Roman's child, conceived when they were stranded on the island. During an argument between John and Roman, Marlena falls down the stairs and miscarries. She wakes up with amnesia, {{as a result of the}} miscarriage. Amnesiac specialist Alex North is brought in to care for Marlena, and she appears to fall in love with him. Alex later reveals that he is Marlena's first husband, and was presumed dead in Vietnam. Since Alex and Marlena's marriage has never been dissolved, Marlena's subsequent marriages are all invalid. Suspicious, John investigates, and finds out that Alex is an abusive husband. John uncovers that Alex is planning to kill Marlena. By the time that Alex <b>is</b> <b>proven</b> <b>to</b> be a fraud, he and Marlena have renewed their vows, and left on a honeymoon. Alex takes Marlena to Morgan Island, but John soon finds them and, after a shootout and scuffle, Alex falls over a cliff and is presumed dead.|$|E

Viki recovers and later donates a kidney to daughter Megan suffering terminal lupus, but Megan dies, leaving Viki devastated. Growing ever-distant from Clint, Viki engages an extramarital affair with Sloan Carpenter (Roy Thinnes); she and Clint divorce in 1994, and she marries Sloan. Sloan dies soon after from Hodgkin's lymphoma, just as {{the existence of a}} second child of Victor and Irene's is revealed. Viki's stress reaches a critical point when Dorian (Robin Strasser onward) tells Viki a secret of which she thought Viki had been aware: the fact that Victor had sexually abused his daughter as a child. With this trauma being what had actually initiated Viki's dissociative identity disorder, she subsequently splinters into several personalities, one of which imprisons Dorian in a secret room below Llanfair. Dorian is eventually freed from her confinement, and Viki recovers after realizing she herself (more specifically, one of her alternate personalities) {{was the one who had}} smothered Victor to death in 1976. In 1995, reviled town outcast Todd Manning (Roger Howarth) <b>is</b> <b>proven</b> <b>to</b> be Victor and Irene's illegitimate son; Viki and Todd eventually become close. After a failed reconciliation attempt with Clint, Viki meets and falls in love with Ben Davidson (Mark Derwin), who is eventually revealed to be the long-lost son of Asa Buchanan (Philip Carey) and Renée Divine Buchanan (Patricia Elliott). Ben's first wife, Skye Chandler (Robin Christopher), comes to town and tries in vain to keep Ben and Viki apart.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Fuzzy {{objective}} function–based clustering methods <b>are</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fast {{tools for}} classification and segmentation purposes. Unfortunately, {{most of the}} available fuzzy clustering methods are using the spherical or ellipsoidal distances, which <b>are</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> result in spurious clusters, when working on color data. In this paper, a general case of clustering is discussed and a general method is proposed and its convergence <b>is</b> <b>proved.</b> Also, it <b>is</b> <b>proved</b> that the FCM and the FCV methods are special cases of the proposed method. Based on the general method, a special case for color image processing is proposed. The clustering method {{is based on a}} likelihood measure, and <b>is</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> outperform the Euclidean and the Mahalanobis distances, in color fields. Based on the proposed color clustering method, a new fast fuzzy segmentation method is proposed and <b>is</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> highly efficient. Comparison of the results with the FCM, proves the superiority of the proposed segmentation method. I...|$|R
