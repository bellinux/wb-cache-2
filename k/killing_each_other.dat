5|$|By 6:30a.m. {{the battle}} for the Alamo was over. Mexican {{soldiers}} inspected each corpse, bayoneting any body that moved. Even with all of the Texians dead, Mexican soldiers continued to shoot, some <b>killing</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> in the confusion. Mexican generals were unable to stop the bloodlust and appealed to Santa Anna for help. Although the general showed himself, the violence continued and the buglers were finally ordered to sound a retreat. For 15minutes after that, soldiers continued to fire into dead bodies.|$|E
5|$|Howard Stark (portrayed by Dominic Cooper) is {{a weapons}} {{developer}} who is framed for selling weapons to America's enemies. One {{of the weapons}} he created during the war was Midnight Oil, designed to give soldiers extra stamina during war, but instead it caused psychosis and led to them <b>killing</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> The U.S. military stole Midnight Oil and used it on the Russians, and Fennhoff blames Stark for the ensuing massacre. Fennhoff hypnotises Stark into bombing New York, but Carter is able to convince Stark to stop. He moves on to set up his own film studio in Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|Koushun Takami {{completed}} Battle Royale when {{he stopped}} working as a journalist in 1996. The story was rejected {{in the final round}} of the 1997 , which took place in March 1998, because of its controversial content. Masao Higashi, {{who took part in the}} award's preliminary selection committee, later suspected this was due to its backdrop of students <b>killing</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> being too reminiscent of the Kobe child murders committed the previous year. Battle Royale was first published in April 1999 by Ohta Publishing. In August 2002, it was released in a revised, two-part pocket edition by Gentosha.|$|E
50|$|Team Deathmatch is a gamemode {{where two}} teams of trovians (Matches consist of 5v5 or 3v3) battle against <b>each</b> <b>other</b> {{with the main}} {{objective}} of <b>killing</b> <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> team members. <b>Each</b> team must must kill off the enemy team, and {{the team with the}} most kills wins the game.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to this, not all PvP games feature a players avatar experiencing death. An {{example of this}} type of PvP element can be found on MMOs such as Audition Online (2004) where while players are not directly <b>killing</b> <b>each</b> <b>others</b> avatars as traditionally found in MMOs, they are still competing against <b>each</b> <b>other</b> during certain game modes in a Player versus Player setting.|$|R
50|$|Ajay (Manoj Manchu) and {{his parents}} are estranged from their joint family in Rayalaseema. Ajay belongs {{to the family of}} Mahendra Naidu (Ahuti Prasad). Seshadri Naidu (Jaya Prakash Reddy) is the enemy of Mahendra Naidu. They keep <b>killing</b> <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> family members. The story is about how the free-spirited Ajay puts an end to this and unites both families.|$|R
5|$|While {{clearing}} his equipment from the craft the drill operator triggers more poltergeist activity, {{and runs through}} the streets in a panic until he finds sanctuary in a church. Quatermass and Roney find him there, and he describes visions of the insect aliens <b>killing</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> As Quatermass investigates {{the history of the}} area, he finds accounts dating back to medieval times about devils and ghosts, all centred on incidents where the ground was disturbed. He suspects a psychic projection of these beings has remained on the alien ship and is being seen by those who come into contact with it.|$|E
5|$|Meat ants {{are highly}} {{territorial}} and aggressive ants which establish firm borders between neighbouring colonies. While the boundaries are not physical, worker ants maintain them {{by engaging in}} ritualised fighting with opponent ants, an interaction most colonies engage in. Fatalities are rare on both sides, but fights may cause injuries to several workers. This fighting enables territory to be contested between opposing colonies without them <b>killing</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> and costing many casualties on both sides. Due of this, it is a method of avoiding casualties and promotes intercolony communication and assessment. A drainage {{of the work force}} would occur if these boundaries acted as a conflict zone if ritualised fighting did not take place. Lethal fighting only occurs if the colony is under attack.|$|E
5|$|The Heirs of Fate saga, {{released}} after {{the rest of}} the DLC, focuses around the game's Child units. Two separate versions of the Avatar's child Kana, one male and one female, each journey with members of each version's cast to discover why a group of mysterious soldiers attacked their homes. It is revealed that they were never truly in their homes, as Anankos had transported them to Valla and attempted to trick them into <b>killing</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> However, Azura's son, Shigure, broke the illusion and banded the two Kanas' armies together, only to leave them to face Anankos alone with the hidden verse of his mother's song. However, the army finds a way back, and helps to take down Anankos for one final time.|$|E
50|$|It {{is worth}} noting, however, that through this period (1987-89) both Massoud and Hekmatyar had been {{frequently}} fighting <b>each</b> <b>other</b> and <b>killing</b> <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> officers, and Massoud's rhetoric was rarely matched by action. In 1988, for instance, Massoud's forces attacked Hekmatyar loyalists in Badakhshan Province. In 1989 Massoud arrested and executed one of Hekmatyar's local officers, Jamal Agha, whom he {{accused of having}} murdered a number of Jamaat-e-Islami commandants: Mohammad Izzatullah, Mohammad Islamuddin, Mulla Abdul-Wadoud, and Payinda Mohammad.|$|R
50|$|The {{novel was}} written, usually for Simenon, {{within a short}} period of two weeks between September and October 1966. It was {{published}} in France in 1967 by Presses de la Cité, after Simenon had already released around 200 other books. The work bears elements of psychological novel and black comedy. It tells a story of an elderly married couple in their early 70s, who have been loathing <b>each</b> <b>other</b> for years for <b>killing</b> <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> pets. They have not been talking, their only form of communication being occasional notes on scraps of paper. However, they are soon to understand that they cannot live without <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> The storyline of the The Cat is speculated to have originated from the author's difficult relationship with his mother.|$|R
50|$|Although Ma Teng was {{initially}} {{on good terms}} with Han Sui, the two went to war against <b>each</b> <b>other</b> over control of Liang Province. The fighting escalated {{to a point where}} they were <b>killing</b> <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> wives and children. Cao Cao, who at this point had decisively defeated Yuan Shao at the Battle of Guandu, brokered peace between Ma and Han, who then pledged allegiance to the Han dynasty and sent troops to assist Cao Cao in defeating Yuan Shao's successors and remnants. After this, Ma Teng was summoned to Ye city with most of his family, and was appointed Minister of the Guards (衛尉). His eldest son, Ma Chao, remained behind in Liang Province with Han Sui.|$|R

25|$|The popular British {{comic strip}} Charley's War by Pat Mills which was {{published}} in Battle Picture Weekly 1979-1985 and portrayed the experiences of young British soldier Charley Bourne in the trenches of the Great War. The strip included a sequence of episodes in which the story's hero Charley and his unit are stationed opposite the regiment of young Lance Corporal Adolf Hitler in December 1917. Charley and Hitler fight hand-to-hand in one scene, nearly <b>killing</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> Hitler is portrayed as a somewhat eccentric and scruffy soldier, ill-tempered but brave, albeit selfishly so.|$|E
25|$|Isabella {{lived to}} see what was {{essentially}} two of her family's enemies <b>killing</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> off. Her family's executioner James I of Scotland died a violent death in February 1437, in a failed coup by his kinsman and former ally Walter Stewart, Earl of Atholl. Walter Stewart, who had himself conspired with James against Isabella's dead husband, Murdoch Duke of Albany, also suffered a gruesome end soon afterwards. He and his co-conspirators against the King were attainted and put to death in Edinburgh by a series of tortures.|$|E
50|$|Not long afterward, however, Han Sui and Ma Teng's {{relationship}} soured {{and the two}} of them battled <b>each</b> <b>other</b> {{for control}} of Liang province. Their battle escalated to the point where both were <b>killing</b> <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> wives and children. Cao Cao, having achieved victory at the Battle of Guandu, sent Zhong Yao to broker a peace between the two warring sides and to place Liang Province under Cao Cao's authority. After the terms were agreed to, Han Sui and Ma Teng would give assistance to Cao Cao in the remainder of his battles against Yuan Shao. After this, Ma Teng was forcibly summoned to Ye and Han Sui placed Ma Teng's son Ma Chao in charge of the region.|$|R
60|$|Not quite that; {{though they}} do beat <b>each</b> <b>other</b> with their boughs, {{fiercely}} enough, in a gale of wind; and then the trees who have strong and stiff boughs wound those who have brittle and limp boughs, and so hurt them, and if the storms come often enough, kill them. But among these trees in a sheltered valley the larger and stronger would kill the weaker and smaller by simply overshadowing their tops, and starving their roots; starving them, indeed, so much when they grow very thick, that the poor little acorns, and beech mast, and alder seeds {{would not be able}} to sprout at all. So they would fight, <b>killing</b> <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> children, till the war ended--I think I can guess how.|$|R
50|$|The game's main theme—gods <b>killing</b> off <b>each</b> <b>other’s</b> {{believers in}} {{religious}} warfare—has caused some controversy. The game comes with six pawns, including ones depicting Jesus swinging a cross {{as a weapon}} and the Buddha firing a machine gun. Several stores have refused to carry the game because of its potential to offend religious people.|$|R
25|$|Famous poets, such as Fazyl bin Tahir Enderuni, wrote poems, and {{classical}} composers, {{such as the}} court musician Hammamizade İsmail Dede Efendi (1778–1846), composed köçekces for celebrated köçeks. Many Istanbul meyhanes (nighttime taverns serving meze, raki or wine) hired köçeks. Before starting their performance, the köçek danced among the spectators, {{to make them more}} excited. In the audience, competition for their attention often caused commotions and altercations. Men would go wild, breaking their glasses, shouting themselves voiceless, or fighting and sometimes <b>killing</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> vying for the boys' sexual favors. This resulted in suppression of the practice under Sultan Abd-ul-Mejid I.|$|E
25|$|The {{geographical}} formations of {{the region}} are frequently mentioned in local folklore. According to legend, Tomorr personified a giant who fought his brother Shpirag, personified by a nearby mountain, {{for the love of}} a young woman. The two brothers fought bitterly for her affections and ended up <b>killing</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> Deep in sorrow, the legend states, the grieving woman for whom they had contested wept over their deaths; her tears created the Osum river. She was then said to have turned to stone, becoming the foundation on which Berat Castle is now built. Both Tomorr and Shpirag are visible from the city of Berat.|$|E
25|$|Cougars {{generally}} {{give the}} bears a wide berth. Grizzlies have less competition with cougars than with other predators, such as coyotes, wolves, and other bears. When a grizzly descends on a cougar feeding on its kill, the cougar usually {{gives way to}} the bear. When a cougar does stand its ground, it will use its superior agility and its claws to harass the bear, yet stay out of its reach until one of them gives up. Grizzly bears occasionally kill cougars in disputes over kills. There have been several accounts, primarily from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, of cougars and grizzly bears <b>killing</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> in fights to the death.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, loyalist and republican paramilitaries {{in the city}} stepped up their <b>killings</b> of <b>each</b> <b>other</b> and [...] "enemy" [...] civilians. A cycle of killing {{continued}} {{right up to the}} PIRA ceasefire in August 1994 and the Combined Loyalist Military Command cessation six weeks later. The most horrific single attack of this period came in October 1993, when the PIRA bombed a fish shop on the Shankill Road in an attempt to kill the UDA leadership. The Shankill Road bombing instead killed nine Protestant shoppers as well as one of the bombers.|$|R
25|$|The anime series, , {{serves as}} a {{conclusion}} (and prelude) to the Hope's Peak Academy storyline featured in the above games.

25|$|The monsters of {{the week}} in the series, Ghosts are twisted aberrations born from the regrets or {{suffering}} {{of people who have}} died and become lost in limbo. Panty and Stocking are tasked with their destruction, which allows them to pass on to Heaven, leaving behind Heaven Coins. Although most Ghosts are savage or destructive, some are relatively harmless annoyances or even oppose their true nature and try to live peacefully. Ghosts are usually slain with angelic weapons, but there are other means of destroying them, such as Ghosts <b>killing</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> or peacefully accomplishing what they wanted to achieve in life. As a recurring joke, whenever Panty and Stocking defeat a Ghost with their angelic weapons, a paper-mache model of the Ghost is filmed being blown-up.|$|E

But {{as long as they were}} <b>killing</b> only <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> the city's feathers didn't get ruffled. The department knew the precise coordinates of where that mess began and ended. Stillwater, Main, West Broad, and West Avenue. The rectangle of refuse and at the center was Vidal Court. They kept it contained.

500|$|... "Motorbreath" [...] {{was written}} by Hetfield during his time in Leather Charm and tells about life on the road. The song {{is based on a}} four-chord verse and a stop-and-start chorus. The most {{recognizable}} parts are Ulrich's drum rolls in each chorus and the riff that accompanies Hammett's solos. Because of its speed, the song requires fast picking by the bassist. [...] "Jump in the Fire" [...] was originally written by Mustaine, with lyrics about teenage sexual experience. Hetfield's revised lyrics for the album were written from Satan's point of view, describing how the devil watches people <b>killing</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> and is sure they will go to hell for their actions. [...] "Jump in the Fire" [...] was released as a single in the UK in February 1984 to promote a UK tour with Venom.

50|$|He {{believes}} that the Afghan and US government {{were not able to}} define their relationship during more than a decade. Hamdam wrote in his opinion editorial, A Decade of Relations Without Definition, that the Afghan-U.S. relationship should not be only based on dying and <b>killing</b> for <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> but it should be based on social, economic and political interests as well. Numerous opportunities already exist to build that long-term and stable relationship. At the moment, some Afghans see the presence of the U.S. in Afghanistan as a world policing and a force against Al-Qaeda and Taliban. What if there are no more Taliban and war in Afghanistan? How will the U.S. and Afghan government justify their relations? Should this relationship remain merely a donor-recipient exchange, a relationship only to finance, train and advise Afghan National Security Forces? These questions are urgent. The two countries must, through inclusive dialogue, define their relationship and must reach for a vision beyond a militarized association.|$|R

Although the war never got to a point of massive shooting in the streets, the two factions were close to <b>killing</b> and destroying <b>each</b> <b>other</b> completely in late 1988.
