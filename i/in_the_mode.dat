5|$|By late June , Donkey Kongs success had {{prompted}} {{more than}} 50 {{parties in the}} U.S. and Japan to license the game's characters. Mario and his simian nemesis appeared on cereal boxes, board games, pajamas, and manga. In 1983, the animation studio Ruby-Spears produced a Donkey Kong cartoon (as well as Donkey Kong Jr.) for the Saturday Supercade program on CBS. In the show, mystery crime-solving plots <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mode</b> of Scooby-Doo are framed around the premise of Mario and Pauline chasing Donkey Kong (voiced by Soupy Sales), who has escaped from the circus. The show lasted two seasons.|$|E
5|$|Hot Potato {{features}} seven {{missions and}} seven score challenges. Mission mode requires the player {{to clear out}} a set number of an alien species. There are multiple alien species <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mode</b> and the mission does not finish until the player gets rid of enough of a certain species chosen by the game from the road. Score challenge mode tasks the player with clearing away {{a certain number of}} aliens in order to reach a pre-determined score. The game contains bonus levels which are longer than normal levels if the player is able to complete missions under a certain time period.|$|E
5|$|The game {{does not}} have a {{competitive}} multiplayer mode, but it has a cooperative multiplayer mode that pits four players together to complete a nine-mission campaign based on the campaign of the original Syndicate games. Players face enemies that become increasingly difficult to deal with as the game progresses. They can choose from four character classes: Medic, Spec Ops, Assault and Generic, each with different abilities. The breaching mechanic is also present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mode</b> for defensive and offensive purposes. For instance, they can hack into a turret to disable its armor or heal team-mates using this mechanic. Players receive points as they progress through the game's levels; these points can be used to research new weapons.|$|E

5|$|There are {{no known}} {{morphological}} {{differences between the}} three island populations, but Turvey and colleagues found that animals from Nevis were slightly smaller than those from the two other islands. Such a difference in size {{might be related to}} the fact that Saint Kitts is larger than Nevis, in accordance with the trend that animals become larger on larger islands. However, Turvey and colleagues also observed that their Saint Kitts material consisted of older individuals than those from Nevis; thus, the size difference may result from differences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mode</b> of exploitation by Amerindians.|$|E
5|$|In the 1940s, RKO {{stood out}} among the industry's Big Five for its focus on B pictures. From a latter-day perspective, {{the most famous of}} the major studios' Golden Age B units is Val Lewton's horror unit at RKO. Lewton {{produced}} such moody, mysterious films as Cat People (1942), I Walked with a Zombie (1943), and The Body Snatcher (1945), directed by Jacques Tourneur, Robert Wise, and others who would become renowned only later in their careers or entirely in retrospect. The movie now widely described as the first classic film noir—Stranger on the Third Floor (1940), a 64-minute B—was produced at RKO, which would release many additional melodramatic thrillers in a similarly stylish vein. The other major studios also turned out a considerable number of movies now identified as noir during the 1940s. Though many of the best-known film noirs were A-level productions, most 1940s pictures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mode</b> were either of the ambiguous programmer type or destined straight for the bottom of the bill. In the decades since, these cheap entertainments, generally dismissed at the time, have become some of the most treasured products of Hollywood's Golden Age.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an experiment {{on the effects}} of learning, mode of interaction (written vs. spoken) and transfer mode on user performance and discourse organization during interaction with a natural language dialogue system. Forty-eight participants took part in a series of twelve dialogues with an information retrieval system presented either <b>in</b> <b>the</b> written or <b>the</b> spoken <b>mode</b> during <b>the</b> first six dialogues. The next six dialogues were then presented either <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same interaction <b>mode</b> or <b>in</b> another <b>mode.</b> <b>The</b> analysis of the results showed that performance (time, number of effective turns) improved throughout the dialogues whatever <b>the</b> <b>mode</b> of interaction. Nevertheless, performance was higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> written <b>mode.</b> Moreover, mode-specific characteristics were observed. These consisted in greater use of subject pronouns and articles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spoken <b>mode.</b> Similarly, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spoken <b>mode,</b> <b>the</b> users found it easier to re-use <b>the</b> formulations presented <b>in</b> <b>the</b> system speech than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> written <b>mode.</b> Furthermore, <b>the</b> analysis also revealed a positive transfer effect on performance and discourse organization when the individuals first interacted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spoken <b>mode</b> and then <b>in</b> <b>the</b> written <b>mode.</b> Both positive and negative transfer effects were observed when the individuals interacted first <b>in</b> <b>the</b> written <b>mode</b> followed by <b>the</b> spoken <b>mode.</b> <b>The</b> implications of the results are discussed in terms of direct and indirect consequences of modality effects on natural language dialogue interaction...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn small cell-attached patches {{containing}} one {{and only}} one Na+ channel, inactivation was studied in three different gating <b>modes,</b> namely, <b>the</b> fast-inactivating F <b>mode</b> and <b>the</b> more slowly inactivating S mode and P mode with similar inactivation kinetics. In each of these modes, ensemble-averaged currents could be fitted with a Hodgkin-Huxley-type model with a single exponential for inactivation (τh). τh declined from 1. 0 ms at − 60 mV to 0. 1 ms at 0 mV <b>in</b> <b>the</b> F <b>mode,</b> from 4. 6 ms at − 40 mV to 1. 1 ms at 0 mV <b>in</b> <b>the</b> S <b>mode,</b> and from 4. 5 ms at − 40 mV to 0. 8 ms at + 20 mV <b>in</b> <b>the</b> P <b>mode,</b> respectively. <b>The</b> probability of non-empty traces (net), {{the mean number of}} openings per non-empty trace (op/tr), and the mean open probability per trace (popen) were evaluated at 4 -ms test pulses. net inclined from 30 % at − 60 mV to 63 % at 0 mV <b>in</b> <b>the</b> F <b>mode,</b> from 4 % at − 90 mV to 90 % at 0 mV <b>in</b> <b>the</b> S <b>mode,</b> and from 2 % at − 60 mV to 79 % at + 20 mV <b>in</b> <b>the</b> P <b>mode.</b> op/tr declined from 1. 4 at − 60 mV to 1. 1 at 0 mV <b>in</b> <b>the</b> F <b>mode,</b> from 4. 0 at − 60 mV to 1. 2 at 0 mV <b>in</b> <b>the</b> S <b>mode,</b> and from 2. 9 at − 40 mV to 1. 6 at + 20 mV <b>in</b> <b>the</b> P <b>mode.</b> popen was bell-shaped with a maximum of 5 % at − 30 mV <b>in</b> <b>the</b> F <b>mode,</b> 48 % at − 50 mV <b>in</b> <b>the</b> S <b>mode,</b> and 16 % at 0 mV <b>in</b> <b>the</b> P <b>mode.</b> It is concluded that 1) a switch between F and S modes may reflect a functional change of inactivation, 2) a switch between S and P modes may reflect a functional change of activation, 3) τh is mainly determined by the latency until the first channel opening <b>in</b> <b>the</b> F <b>mode</b> and by <b>the</b> number of reopenings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> S and P modes, 4) at least <b>in</b> <b>the</b> S and P modes, inactivation is independent of pore opening, and 5) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> S <b>mode,</b> mainly open channels inactivate, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> P <b>mode,</b> mainly closed channels inactivate...|$|R
25|$|Within the Notostraca, {{and even}} within species, there is {{variation}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mode</b> of reproduction, with some populations reproducing sexually, some showing self-fertilisation of females, and some showing {{a mix of}} the two. The frequency of males in populations is therefore highly variable. In sexual populations, the sperm leave the male's body through simple pores, there being no penis. The eggs are released by the female and then held in the cup-like brood pouch. The eggs are retained by the female only {{for a short time}} before being laid, and the larvae develop directly, without passing through a metamorphosis.|$|E

25|$|On the whole, the {{development}} of poetry in the American colonies mirrors {{the development}} of the colonies themselves. The early poetry is dominated by the need to preserve the integrity of the Puritan ideals that created the settlement in the first place. As the colonists grew in confidence, the poetry they wrote increasingly reflected their drive towards independence. This shift in subject matter was not reflected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mode</b> of writing which tended to be conservative, to say the least.

In any event, neither pincer did much toward its goal of distracting the People's Army of Vietnam from its attempts to overrun the strategic guerrilla base at Long Tieng and end the war.|$|E
25|$|The order Notostraca {{comprises}} the single family Triopsidae, containing the tadpole shrimp or shield shrimp. The two genera, Triops and Lepidurus, are considered living fossils, having not changed significantly in outward form since the Triassic. They have a broad, flat carapace, which conceals {{the head and}} bears {{a single pair of}} compound eyes. The abdomen is long, appears to be segmented and bears numerous pairs of flattened legs. The telson is flanked by a pair of long, thin caudal rami. Phenotypic plasticity within taxa makes species-level identification difficult, and is further compounded by variation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mode</b> of reproduction. Notostracans are omnivores living on the bottom of temporary pools and shallow lakes.|$|E
