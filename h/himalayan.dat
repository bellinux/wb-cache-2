5|$|Darjeeling {{is a part}} of the Eastern <b>Himalayan</b> zoo-geographic zone. Flora around Darjeeling {{comprises}} sal, oak, semi-evergreen, temperate and alpine forests. Dense evergreen {{forests of}} sal and oak lie around the town, where a wide variety of rare orchids are found. The Lloyd's Botanical Garden preserves common and rare species of plants, while the Padmaja Naidu <b>Himalayan</b> Zoological Park specialises in conserving and breeding endangered <b>Himalayan</b> species. The town of Darjeeling and surrounding region face deforestation due to increasing demand for wood fuel and timber, as well as air pollution from increasing vehicular traffic.|$|E
5|$|Further {{dividing}} {{the varieties of}} fancy rats are the many different markings. Pet rats can appear in any combination of colors and markings. The markings are typically {{in reference to the}} patterns and ratios of colored hair versus white hair. Two extremes would be a self (completely solid, non-white color) and a <b>Himalayan</b> (completely white except blending into colored areas at the nose and feet, called points, as in a <b>Himalayan</b> cat's markings).|$|E
5|$|Leopards {{are found}} in hilly areas but may also venture into the low land jungles. Small cats in the park include the jungle cat, fishing cat and leopard cat. Other mammals include barking deer, sambar deer, hog deer and chital, sloth and <b>Himalayan</b> black bears, Indian grey mongoose, otters, yellow-throated martens, <b>Himalayan</b> goral, Indian pangolins, and langur and rhesus macaques. Owls and nightjars can be heard during the night.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Himalayan</b> Zoological Park {{exhibits}} the fauna of the Himalayas {{in their}} natural habitats. The zoo features the <b>Himalayan</b> black bear, red pandas, the barking deer, the snow leopard, the leopard cat, Tibetan wolf, masked palm civet and the spotted deer, amongst the others. Jawaharlal Nehru Botanical Gardens, near Rumtek, houses many species of orchid {{and as many as}} fifty different species of tree, including many oaks.|$|E
5|$|The Padmaja Naidu <b>Himalayan</b> Zoological Park in Darjeeling, India, {{successfully}} released four captive-bred red pandas to {{the wild}} in August and November 2003.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{prominent}} wildflowers are Hooker's fairy bells, vanilla leaf, evergreen violet, and trillium. Invasive species include English ivy, European holly, clematis, morning glory, and <b>Himalayan</b> blackberry. Citizen {{groups such as}} the No Ivy League. and The Forest Park Conservancy engage in projects to remove ivy, maintain trails, and plant native species.|$|E
5|$|For instance, in India, {{the biggest}} threat seems to be habitat loss {{followed}} by poaching, while in China, {{the biggest threat}} seems to be hunting and poaching. A 40% decrease in red panda populations {{has been reported in}} China over the last 50 years, and populations in western <b>Himalayan</b> areas are considered to be lower.|$|E
5|$|In 1847, Hodgson {{described}} a red panda {{under the name}} Ailurus ochraceus, of which Pocock concluded it represents the same type as Ailurus fulgens, since {{the description of the}} two agree very closely. He subordinated both types to the <b>Himalayan</b> red panda subspecies Ailurus fulgens fulgens.|$|E
5|$|Moravian {{palaeontologist}} Ferdinand Stoliczka {{separated the}} <b>Himalayan</b> {{population as a}} third subspecies, P.g.forsythi, but {{this has not been}} widely accepted and is usually treated as synonymous with digitatus. A Pleistocene form from Europe was similar to the extant subspecies, and is sometimes categorised as P.g.vetus.|$|E
5|$|The Red panda, Clouded leopard, Siberian weasel, Asiatic black bear, barking deer, <b>Himalayan</b> tahr, goral, gaur and {{pangolin}} {{are some}} of the fauna found near Kalimpong. Avifauna of the region include the pheasants, cuckoos, minivets, flycatchers, bulbuls, orioles, owls, partridges, sunbirds, warblers, swallows, swifts and woodpeckers.|$|E
5|$|The common {{blackbird}} occurs up to 1000metres (3300ft) in Europe, 2300metres (7590ft) in North Africa, and at 900–1820metres (3000–6000ft) in peninsular India and Sri Lanka, but {{the large}} <b>Himalayan</b> subspecies range much higher, with T. m. maximus breeding at 3200–4800metres (10560–16000ft) and remaining above 2100metres (6930ft) even in winter.|$|E
5|$|The {{story was}} {{inspired}} by the ten-year-long Maoist insurgency in Nepal. The game follows Ajay Ghale, a young Kyrati-American who returns to his native country of Kyrat (a fictional <b>Himalayan</b> country derived from Kirati, a collection of <b>Himalayan</b> people originating from Tibet) to spread his deceased mother's ashes. Kyrat was once an autonomous state in the Himalayas ruled by a royal family before being engulfed in a series of civil wars. Ajay finds the country in a state of conflict between Kyrat's Royal Army, led by the country's eccentric and tyrannical King Pagan Min, and the Golden Path, a rebel movement fighting to free Kyrat from Min's oppressive rule. The choices Ajay makes will determine the fate of Kyrat.|$|E
5|$|While {{returning}} to Kolkata after completing a floral survey, Joseph Dalton Hooker (1817–1911) {{carried out the}} first survey of Sitakunda's local flora, as recorded in his <b>Himalayan</b> Journals, in January 1851 (published by the Calcutta Trigonometrical Survey Office and Minerva Library of Famous Books; Ward, Lock, Bowden & Co., 1891).|$|E
5|$|Bull thistle (Cirsium vulgare), {{common mullein}} (Verbascum thapsus), and Klamath weed (Hypericum perforatum) have been {{identified}} as noxious pests in Yosemite since the 1940s. Additional species that have been recognized more recently as aggressive and requiring control are yellow star thistle (Centaurea solstitialis), sweet clover (Melilot spp.), <b>Himalayan</b> blackberry (Rubus armeniacus), cut-leaved blackberry (Rubus laciniatus) and large periwinkle (Vinca major).|$|E
5|$|Creek {{restoration}} projects {{since the}} 1990s {{have reduced the}} amount of <b>Himalayan</b> blackberry, an invasive species {{that had come to}} dominate much of the landscape near the creek. New plantings include native shrubs and trees such as red-osier dogwood, elderberry, Indian plum, and willow. City parks adjacent to Johnson Creek have areas devoted to marsh with shrubs, cattails, and smartweed, forested wetland, riparian woodland, open meadow, and orchard trees.|$|E
5|$|Current park {{managers}} {{focus on}} controlling nine high-priority invasive plant species of noxious weeds: yellow star-thistle (Centaurea solstitialis); spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa); <b>Himalayan</b> blackberry (Rubus armeniacus); bull thistle (Cirsium vulgare); velvet grass (Holcus lanatus); cheat grass (Bromus tectorum); French broom (Genista monspessulana); Italian thistle (Carduus pycnocephalus); and perennial pepperweed (Lepidium latifolium). In 2008, the park {{began to use}} the herbicides glyphosate and aminopyralid to augment manual methods to manage the most threatening plants.|$|E
5|$|Falsified records {{identified}} by Rasmussen and Prys-Jones included high-altitude occurrences of coral-billed scimitar-babbler Pomatorhinus ferruginosus, out-of-range Kashmir flycatcher Ficedula subrubra and <b>Himalayan</b> winter records of ferruginous flycatcher Muscicapa ferruginea and large blue flycatcher Cyornis magnirostris (now hill blue-flycatcher C. banyumas). However, some records {{such as those}} for Afghan snowfinch Montifringilla theresae, a species Meinertzhagen described, appear to be genuine.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th and 20th centuries, some taxonomists {{inspected}} serval {{skins and}} identified two {{species on the}} basis of coat pattern: Felis serval (serval), with large, pronounced spots, and F. servalina or F. ornata (servaline cat), marked by freckle-sized dots. F. servalina was first described in 1839 by Irish naturalist William Ogilby from Sierra Leone; in 1867, British zoologist John Edward Gray described F. herschelii from an Indian skin, which was probably the same as the servaline cat. In 1907, British zoologist Reginald Innes Pocock commented that the two forms should be considered independent species, but reverted from this in 1917. Eventually, the two forms came to be recognised as the same species. Another form, F. himalayanus (<b>Himalayan</b> serval), was described from a skin procured from the <b>Himalayan</b> region; however, Scottish naturalist William Jardine noted in The Naturalist's Library (1843) that no such specimen had been identified by him or his colleagues, and that it differed considerably from the common serval. In 1944, Pocock identified three races of the serval from northern Africa.|$|E
5|$|Measurements for the russet sparrow vary geographically, {{between the}} three {{subspecies}}, and also within the <b>Himalayan</b> subspecies cinnamomeus. The subspecies cinnamomeus is generally larger than the others, and within this form {{there is a tendency}} for birds at higher altitudes to be larger, and a clinal variation in size with the smallest birds in the west of the range and the largest in the east.|$|E
5|$|Prominent {{bird species}} {{seen in the}} park are both migratory and {{resident}} avifauna species. Some of the avifauna are the East <b>Himalayan</b> pied kingfisher, black kite, lesser sky-lark, northern hill myna, Burmese pied myna, North Indian black drongos, lesser eastern jungle crow, yellow headed wagtail, spotbill duck, blue-winged teal, ruddy shell duck, hooded crane, Burmese sarus crane, Indian white-breasted waterhen and crimson-breasted pied woodpecker.|$|E
5|$|Some Shaktism-related festivals revere Shiva {{along with}} the goddess {{considered}} primary and Supreme. These include festivals dedicated to Annapurna such as Annakuta and those related to Durga. In <b>Himalayan</b> regions such as Nepal, {{as well as in}} northern, central and western India, the festival of Teej is celebrated by girls and women in the monsoon season, in honor of goddess Parvati, with group singing, dancing and by offering prayers in Parvati-Shiva temples.|$|E
5|$|The GLC was {{formally}} abolished at midnight on 31 March 1986, with Livingstone marking the occasion by holding a free concert at Festival Hall. In his capacity as former {{leader of the}} GLC, Livingstone was invited to visit Australia, Israel, and Zimbabwe in the following months by leftist groups in those countries, before he and Allen undertook a 5-week <b>Himalayan</b> trek to the base camp of Mount Everest.|$|E
5|$|The {{decline in}} C. graminis {{is likely to}} be due to habitat loss {{resulting}} from land improvement and arable conversion, over-grazing, development, drainage and lowering of water-tables due to over-abstraction. Neglect may also lead to loss or degradation of habitat such as through over-shading or competition of food-plants with invasive species such as <b>Himalayan</b> balsam (Impatiens glandulifera). Flood-bank works may deplete or destroy local sub-populations.|$|E
5|$|The {{district}} of Faisalabad {{is part of}} the alluvial plains between the <b>Himalayan</b> foothills and the central core of the Indian subcontinent. The alluvial deposits are typically over a thousand feet thick. The interfluves are believed to have been formed during the Late Pleistocene and feature river terraces. These were later identified as old and young floodplains of the Ravi River on the Kamalia and Chenab Plains. The old floodplains consist of Holocene deposits from the Ravi and Chenab rivers.|$|E
5|$|The {{effort to}} {{construct}} a hill passenger railway system throughout the mountainous regions of India commenced in 1878 with the Darjeeling <b>Himalayan</b> Railway project. Franklin Prestage of the Eastern Bengal Railway initiated plans for {{the building of a}} hill tramway parallel to the hill cart road between Siliguri and Darjeeling. By 1881, the line was completed up to Darjeeling.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationships}} of the flamecrest or Taiwan firecrest (Regulus goodfellowi) of Taiwan {{have also been}} a source of much debate. It is sometimes viewed as a race of firecrest, but its territorial song resembles those of the <b>Himalayan</b> races of goldcrest, and genetic data show that it is the closest relative of that species, and, despite its alternative name, only distantly related to the firecrest. The flamecrest diverged from the goldcrest 3.0–3.1mya (million years ago).|$|E
5|$|The role of Mr. Jinx the cat {{was played}} by two five-year-old <b>Himalayan</b> cats named Bailey and Misha (sometimes written as Meesha). The American Humane Association oversaw the filming of all scenes where the cats were used and ensured the animals' {{obedience}} and well-being by keeping two trainers and a veterinarian on set at all times.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene is}} further embellished around the Guru Rinpoche (Padmashambahava) image {{and also in}} the palace, with gods and goddesses in the heavens, with gate keepers at the four gates with an army of {{messengers}} and servants; all trying to crush the demons to dust. The supporting staff shown are said to represent the <b>Himalayan</b> tribes of pre-Buddhist periods.|$|E
5|$|The {{woodpeckers}} are {{an ancient}} bird family consisting of three subfamilies, the wrynecks, the piculets {{and the true}} woodpeckers, Picinae. The largest of the six tribes within the Picinae is the pied woodpeckers, a group which includes the great spotted woodpecker. Within the large genus Dendrocopus the great spotted woodpecker's closest relatives are the <b>Himalayan,</b> Sind, Syrian and white-winged woodpeckers and possibly the Darjeeling woodpecker. The great spotted woodpecker has been recorded as hybridising with the Syrian woodpecker.|$|E
5|$|Among other languages, Nepali, Hindi and Bengali are {{prominent}} vernacular languages {{used in this}} region. Newspapers in all these four languages {{are available in the}} Darjeeling Hills region. Of the largely circulated Nepali newspapers Himalay Darpan, Swarnabhumi and some Sikkim-based Nepali newspapers like Hamro Prajashakti and Samay Dainik are read most. The Tibet Mirror was the first Tibetan-language newspaper published in Kalimpong in 1925. while <b>Himalayan</b> Times was the first English to have come out from Kalimpong in the year 1947, it was closed down in the year 1962 after the Chinese aggression but was started once again and is now in regular print. It is known for its bold and aggressive stand on all local issues.|$|E
5|$|Current {{sea level}} rise, {{increased}} cyclonic activity, increased ambient temperatures, and increasingly fickle precipitation patterns are {{effects of global}} warming that have affected or are projected to impact India. Thousands {{of people have been}} displaced by ongoing sea level rises that have submerged low-lying islands in the Sundarbans. Temperature rises on the Tibetan Plateau are causing <b>Himalayan</b> glaciers to retreat, threatening the flow rate of the Ganges, Brahmaputra, Yamuna, and other major rivers; the livelihoods {{of hundreds of thousands of}} farmers depend on these rivers. A 2007 World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) report states that the Indus River may run dry for the same reason.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{sequences}} can be {{mapped to}} reveal a phylogenetic tree that represents evolutionary relationships, with each branch point representing the divergence of two lineages from a common ancestor. On this tree the term basal is used to describe a lineage that forms a branch diverging nearest to the common ancestor. Wolf genetic sequencing has found the Beringian wolf to be basal to all other gray wolves except for the modern Indian gray wolf and <b>Himalayan</b> wolf, and the extinct Belgian clade of Pleistocene wolves.|$|E
