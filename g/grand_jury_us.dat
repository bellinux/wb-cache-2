In 2008, a US former navy seaman, Abu Jihad, was indicted and convicted of disclosing the classified information on the battlegroup but he was cleared of terrorism charges. However, when sentencing Ahmad on 16 July 2014, federal district Judge Janet Hall ruled that [...] "nothing was done with the information" [...] found in Ahmad's possession so, [...] "And that is that the Battle Group Document, besides showing that the Navy enlisted man was a traitor to his country, it also shows that Mr. Ahmad and Mr. Ahsan had absolutely no interest in operational terrorist actions that would harm the United States." ...|$|R

In some instances, defendants charged individuals a reduced rate for fuel purchased using the city’s credit card and then pocketed the cash.

5000|$|The FBI {{arrested him}} around June 1961.

The law had been created {{as part of the}} McCarran Internal Security Act / Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950 during the Red Scare of the 1950s by Senator Karl Earl Mundt. Mundt claimed it was a reaction to the Alger Hiss, Elizabeth Bentley, and similar cases. It {{is one of the few}} Federal statutes that criminalizes delivering classified information. He was found guilty of the Title 50 counts but not guilty of the Title 18 count. In November 1961 he was sentenced to three consecutive terms of 10 years in prison, the maximum penalty the law allowed. His wife said she would [...] "stick by him".|$|R
500|$|The <b>Grand</b> <b>Jury</b> Clause does very little, if anything, to {{regulate}} the procedures of the <b>grand</b> <b>jury.</b> For example, the Clause does not prohibit a <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> indictment based solely on hearsay evidence. Non-fundamental flaws with the <b>grand</b> <b>jury,</b> such {{as a violation of}} the defendant's self-incrimination rights or a violation of <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> secrecy do not trigger a right not to be tried. In United States v. Williams (1992), where the Court rejected a rule that would have required [...] "substantial exculpatory evidence" [...] to be presented to the <b>grand</b> <b>jury,</b> the defendant did not even argue a Fifth Amendment violation. The lack of a <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> does not deprive the court of jurisdiction, and the defendant may waive the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> right.|$|R
5000|$|Occasionally, <b>grand</b> <b>juries</b> go aggressively {{beyond the}} control of the prosecuting attorney. When the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> does so the {{situation}} is called a [...] "runaway" [...] <b>grand</b> <b>jury.</b> Runaway <b>grand</b> <b>juries</b> sometimes happen in government corruption or organized crime cases if the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> comes to believe that the prosecutor himself has been improperly influenced. Such cases were common in the 19th century but have become infrequent since the 1930s.|$|R
50|$|These county-level <b>grand</b> <b>juries</b> {{primarily}} {{focus on}} oversight of government institutions {{at the county}} level or lower. This is why California's <b>grand</b> <b>juries</b> are often called civil <b>grand</b> <b>juries.</b> Almost any entity that receives public money can be examined by the <b>grand</b> <b>jury,</b> including county governments, cities, and special districts.|$|R
50|$|Multicounty <b>Grand</b> <b>Jury</b> Unit - The Multicounty <b>Grand</b> <b>Jury</b> Unit investigates and prosecutes cases {{ranging from}} {{homicide}} to narcotics violations. The unit also administers {{all aspects of}} the Multicounty <b>Grand</b> <b>Jury.</b>|$|R
50|$|Court {{records from}} the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> {{proceeding}} on Rocky Flats have been sealed {{for a number of}} years. The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which govern federal <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> proceedings, explicitly require <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> proceedings to be kept secret unless otherwise provided by the Rules. Rocky Flats' secret <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> proceedings were not unique.|$|R
5000|$|In {{criminal}} law in federal courts and {{a minority of}} state court systems of the United States, a <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> is convened to hear only testimony and evidence {{to determine whether there}} is a sufficient basis for deciding to indict the defendant and proceed toward trial. In each court district where a <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> is required, a group of 16-23 citizens holds an inquiry on criminal complaints brought by the prosecutor to decide whether a trial is warranted (based on the standard that probable cause exists that a crime was committed), in which case an indictment is issued. In jurisdictions where the size of a jury varies, in general the size of juries tends to be larger if the crime alleged is more serious. If a <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> rejects a proposed indictment the <b>grand</b> <b>jury's</b> action is known as a [...] "no bill." [...] If they accept a proposed indictment, the <b>grand</b> <b>jury's</b> action is known as a [...] "true bill." [...] <b>Grand</b> <b>jury</b> proceedings are ex parte: only the prosecutor and witnesses who the prosecutor calls may present evidence to the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> and defendants are not allowed to present mitigating evidence or even to know the testimony that was presented to the <b>grand</b> <b>jury,</b> and hearsay evidence is permitted. This is so because a <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> cannot convict a defendant. It can only decide to indict the defendant and proceed forward toward trial. <b>Grand</b> <b>juries</b> vote to indict in the overwhelming majority of cases, and prosecutors are not prohibited from presenting the same case to a new <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> if a [...] "no bill" [...] was returned by a previous <b>grand</b> <b>jury.</b> A typical <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> considers a new criminal case every fifteen minutes. In some jurisdictions, in addition to indicting persons for crimes, a <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> may also issue reports on matters that they investigate apart from the criminal indictments, particularly when the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> investigation involves a public scandal. Historically, <b>grand</b> <b>juries</b> were sometimes used in American law to serve a purpose similar to an investigatory commission.|$|R
25|$|The <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> {{indictment}} {{clause of}} the Fifth Amendment has not been incorporated under the Fourteenth Amendment. This means that the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> requirement applies only to felony charges in the federal court system. While many states do employ <b>grand</b> <b>juries,</b> no defendant has a Fifth Amendment right to a <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> for criminal charges in state court. States are free to abolish <b>grand</b> <b>juries,</b> and many (though not all) have replaced them with preliminary hearing.|$|R
50|$|In South Australia and Western Australia, <b>grand</b> <b>juries</b> {{existed for}} longer periods of time. In South Australia, the first <b>Grand</b> <b>Jury</b> sat on 13 May 1837, but it was {{abolished}} in 1852. In Western Australia, by the <b>Grand</b> <b>Jury</b> Abolition Act Amendment Act 1883 (WA), the <b>Grand</b> <b>Jury</b> was abolished (section 4: A <b>Grand</b> <b>Jury</b> shall not be summoned for the Supreme Court of Western Australia, nor for any General Quarter Sessions for the said Colony).|$|R
