5|$|The codex, {{although}} displaying Mixtec stylistic features, {{is judged}} to be Maya (if genuine) based upon the use of bark paper instead of the deerhide preferred for Mixtec codices {{and because of the}} presence of Maya day signs and numbering. The Mixtec interpretation of the <b>iconography</b> may simply be due to incomplete knowledge of highland Maya <b>iconography</b> during the Postclassic period.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} Ardhanarishvara {{images are}} dated to the Kushan period, {{starting from the}} first century CE. Its <b>iconography</b> evolved and was perfected in the Gupta era. The Puranas and various iconographic treatises write about the mythology and <b>iconography</b> of Ardhanarishvara. While Ardhanarishvara remains a popular iconographic form found in most Shiva temples throughout India, very few temples are dedicated to this deity.|$|E
5|$|Bhikshatana {{is often}} pictured with four arms in South Indian <b>iconography.</b> The front right arm is {{stretched}} out downwards {{and the hand}} holds a bit of grass or another plant in the kataka gesture, {{near the mouth of}} his pet deer or antelope, who leaps playfully by his side. The back right arm is raised and holds a damaru (drum). The front left hand holds a kapala (skull-cup), used as a begging bowl. The back left hand holds a trishula decorated with peacock feathers. The left leg is firmly rooted in the ground while the right one is slightly bent, suggesting walking. He often wears paduka (wooden sandals) but sometimes may be barefoot. The sandals are unique and identifying feature of Bhikshatana's <b>iconography</b> and distinguish him from other forms of Shiva and all other deities, who are always depicted barefoot. Sometimes Bhikshatana's <b>iconography</b> is amalgamated with that of Bhairava, in which case he displays Bhairava's attributes in addition to his own.|$|E
40|$|In this chapter, {{the authors}} propose a {{theoretical}} lens to critically examine the <b>iconographies</b> of contemporary organizations. In doing so, {{they seek to}} understand how <b>iconographies</b> {{can be used to}} legitimize organizations. They distinguish between two <b>iconographies</b> – ‘image-object’ and ‘screen-object’ – and examine how they are intricately related to organizational legitimation practices. They then go on to illustrate these <b>iconographies</b> and their relationships in the case study of a French university that has faced intense and changing legitimacy demands. The authors investigate the relationships between these <b>iconographies</b> in the extreme case of the command room of the former North American Treaty Organization (NATO), as the university in question occupies the former NATO headquarters. The case study reveals how university members shifted between <b>iconographies</b> of ‘image-object’ and ‘screen-objects’ to legitimize their organizing practices. As a conclusion, implications for debates about sociomateriality and its relationship with organizational legitimacy are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The 1585 Relación Geográfica Map of Santiago Atitlán, Guatemala gives {{scholars}} a rare {{glimpse of}} sixteenth- century southern Guatemala. The map displays {{the use of}} Spanish, Nahua, and Maya perspectives. The coexistence of indigenous Nahua versus Spanish or European <b>iconographies</b> and narratives is a theme constantly explored in the studies of the Relaciones Geográficas maps. However, the opposition of two different indigenous narratives and <b>iconographies,</b> as well as Spanish, is not. This project examines the convergences and conflicts among these narratives and <b>iconographies</b> as evidenced on the map and in the accompanying text. The individual discussion of each narrative {{is followed by a}} critical discussion to provide theoretical and authorial contexts for the map. In effect, this study complicates the view of sixteenth-century Mesoamerican Relaciones Geográficas maps...|$|R

5|$|The {{earliest}} <b>iconography</b> for Mahavira is from {{archaeological sites}} in the north Indian city of Mathura. These are variously dated from the 1stcentury BC to the 2ndcentury AD. The use of the srivatsa mark on Mahavira's chest, along with his dhyana-mudra posture, appears in Kushana Empire-era artwork. The differences in the Mahavira artwork between the Digambara and Svetambara traditions appear in the late 5thcentury AD and thereafter. According to John Cort, the earliest archaeological evidence of Jina <b>iconography</b> with inscriptions precedes its datable texts by more than 250 years.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the volume}} is to study in detail the {{relationship}} between “Iconologia” of Cesare Ripa (editio princeps 1593) and ancient world, the use of coins, of classical literary sources, of greek and latin masterpieces and to catch a strange paradox: the work contains more references to ancient masterpieces than it seems at a first reading. By investigating among Ripa’ s sources, {{it is clear that}} behind anonymous <b>iconographies</b> many very famous classical masterpieces hide that Ripa does not mention. The analysis, made on the sources shows that Ripa was neither a scholar of ancient objects neither a collector of antiques, but an encyclopaedist coder of <b>iconographies</b> and a man of XVI century interested in the strenght of symbols...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{consists of}} {{a different approach to}} the investigation of the elevated beds at Deir el-Medina. It identifies the underlining factors considered during their construction, where they were positioned, how they were orientated and what the surviving <b>iconographies</b> suggested about their original usage. It concludes with identifying the front rooms at Deir el-Medina as gardens. The frontal room is where the elevated beds were positioned and therefore link to the gardens symbolic meaning of resurrection and the afterlife. The elevated beds were orientated to symbolize the deceases’ connection with Re and Osiris. It also signifies a change after the Amarna period with an influx in Osiris worship. The <b>iconographies</b> surviving upon the elevated beds convey the deceased being reborn within the field of reeds signifying that the elevated beds were possibly used for altar purposes...|$|R

5|$|The <b>iconography</b> of Vaikuntha Chaturmurti was {{influenced}} by Gandhara architectural tradition, which impacted the iconographic depictions of sculptures of Northwest India, particularly those made in Kashmir. Keeping with the Gandhara style, the body and legs are depicted as strong and sturdy. The muscular body {{is considered to be}} inflated with prana (life-breath), an Indian concept. The bow arched eyebrows and lotus shaped eyes are also characteristic of the Indian school of sculpture. The presence of the earth goddess at the feet also reflects Central Asian influence. The ayudhapurushas in the icon may be inspired by those in the Vishnu <b>iconography</b> of Gupta art. They and the earth goddess are also part of traditional Vishnu <b>iconography,</b> even when he is depicted as one-headed.|$|E

William's coat of arms traditionally depicts seven mascles or lozenges. St William's College, which was named for him is next to York Minster. It was established between 1465 and 1467 with the permission of King Edward IV as the home for chantry priests of the Cathedral.

5|$|Mesopotamian {{religion}} recognizes {{literally thousands}} of deities, and distinct <b>iconographies</b> have been identified for about a dozen. Less frequently, gods are identified by a written label or dedication; such labels would only have been intended for the literate elites. In creating a religious object, the sculptor was not free to create novel images: the representation of deities, their attributes and context were as much part of the religion as the rituals and the mythology. Indeed, innovation and deviation from an accepted canon {{could be considered a}} cultic offense. The large degree of similarity that is found in plaques and seals suggests that detailed <b>iconographies</b> could have been based on famous cult statues; they established the visual tradition for such derivative works but have now been lost. It appears, though, that the Burney Relief was the product of such a tradition, not its source, since its composition is unique.|$|R
