5|$|After welding, {{a number}} of {{distinct}} regions can be identified in the weld area. The weld itself is called the fusion zone—more specifically, it is where the filler metal was laid during the welding process. The properties of the fusion zone depend primarily on the filler metal used, and its compatibility with the base materials. It is surrounded by the <b>heat-affected</b> <b>zone,</b> the area that had its microstructure and properties altered by the weld. These properties depend on the base material's behavior when subjected to heat. The metal {{in this area is}} often weaker than both the base material and the fusion zone, and is also where residual stresses are found.|$|E
5|$|Many {{distinct}} factors {{influence the}} strength of welds and the material around them, including the welding method, the amount and concentration of energy input, the weldability of the base material, filler material, and flux material, {{the design of the}} joint, and the interactions between all these factors. To test the quality of a weld, either destructive or nondestructive testing methods are commonly used to verify that welds are free of defects, have acceptable levels of residual stresses and distortion, and have acceptable <b>heat-affected</b> <b>zone</b> (HAZ) properties. Types of welding defects include cracks, distortion, gas inclusions (porosity), non-metallic inclusions, lack of fusion, incomplete penetration, lamellar tearing, and undercutting.|$|E
5|$|A {{variation}} of the spray transfer mode, pulse-spray {{is based on the}} principles of spray transfer but uses a pulsing current to melt the filler wire and allow one small molten droplet to fall with each pulse. The pulses allow the average current to be lower, decreasing the overall heat input and thereby decreasing the size of the weld pool and <b>heat-affected</b> <b>zone</b> while making it possible to weld thin workpieces. The pulse provides a stable arc and no spatter, since no short-circuiting takes place. This also makes the process suitable for nearly all metals, and thicker electrode wire can be used as well. The smaller weld pool gives the variation greater versatility, making it possible to weld in all positions. In comparison with short arc GMAW, this method has a somewhat slower maximum speed (85mm/s or 200in/min) and the process also requires that the shielding gas be primarily argon with a low carbon dioxide concentration. Additionally, it requires a special power source capable of providing current pulses with a frequency between 30 and 400 pulses per second. However, the method has gained popularity, since it requires lower heat input and can be used to weld thin workpieces, as well as nonferrous materials.|$|E
30|$|In some cases, however, {{a notable}} {{difference}} in thermal conductivity has a beneficial {{effect on the}} joint: for example, no <b>heat-affected</b> <b>zones</b> were produced in a study using friction stir welding, due to the high sink rate resulting from the high thermal conductivity of Cu (Sarvghad-Moghaddam, et al., 2014).|$|R

25|$|The <b>heat-affected</b> <b>zone</b> (HAZ) {{is common}} to all welding processes. As {{indicated}} by the name, this region is subjected to a thermal cycle but is not deformed during welding.

In fact, in age-hardened aluminium alloys this region commonly exhibits the poorest mechanical properties.|$|E
25|$|The AWS {{states that}} for an {{equivalent}} carbon content above 0.40% {{there is a}} potential for cracking in the <b>heat-affected</b> <b>zone</b> (HAZ) on flame cut edges and welds. However, structural engineering standards rarely use CE, but rather limit the maximum percentage of certain alloying elements. This practice started before the CE concept existed, so just continues to be used. This has led to issues because certain high strength steels are now being used that have a CE higher than 0.50% that have brittle failures.|$|E

40|$|Microstructural {{analyses}} by advanced metallographic {{techniques were}} conducted on mockup welds and a cracked BWR core shroud weld fabricated from Type 304 L stainless steel. <b>heat-affected</b> <b>zones</b> of the shroud weld and mockup shielded-metal-arc welds were free of grain-boundary carbide, martensite, delta ferrite, or Cr depletion near grain boundaries. However, {{as a result of}} exposure to welding fumes, the <b>heat-affected</b> <b>zones</b> of the welds were significantly contaminated by fluorine and oxygen which migrate to grain boundaries. Significant oxygen contamination promotes fluorine contamination and suppresses classical thermal sensitization, even in Type 304 steels. Results of slow-strain-rate tensile tests indicate that fluorine exacerbates the susceptibility of irradiated steels to intergranular stress corrosion cracking. These observations, combined with previous reports on the strong influence of weld flux, indicate that oxygen and fluorine contamination and fluorine-catalyzed stress corrosion {{play a major role in}} cracking of Type 304 L stainless steel core shroud welds...|$|R
50|$|Weld {{integrity}} {{is a crucial}} component of pipeline safety, especially girth welds (or the circumferential welds that join each section of pipe together). However, unlike the consistent molecular structure of milled steel, welds and their <b>heat-affected</b> <b>zones</b> (HAZs) have an anisotropic grain structure that attenuates ultrasonic signals and creates wave velocity variances that are difficult for ILI tools to analyze.|$|R
500|$|For GTAW {{of carbon}} and {{stainless}} steels, {{the selection of}} a filler material is important to prevent excessive porosity. Oxides on the filler material and workpieces must be removed before welding to prevent contamination, and immediately prior to welding, alcohol or acetone should be used to clean the surface. Preheating is generally not necessary for mild steels less than one inch thick, but low alloy steels may require preheating to slow the cooling process and prevent the formation of martensite in the <b>heat-affected</b> <b>zone.</b> [...] Tool steels should also be preheated to prevent cracking in the <b>heat-affected</b> <b>zone.</b> Austenitic stainless steels do not require preheating, but martensitic and ferritic chromium stainless steels do. A DCEN power source is normally used, and thoriated electrodes, tapered to a sharp point, are recommended. Pure argon is used for thin workpieces, but helium can be introduced as thickness increases.|$|E
500|$|The <b>heat-affected</b> <b>zone</b> (HAZ) is a ring {{surrounding}} the weld {{in which the}} temperature of the welding process, combined with the stresses of uneven heating and cooling, alter the heat-treatment properties of the alloy. The effects of welding on the material {{surrounding the}} weld can be detrimental—depending on the materials used and the heat input of the welding process used, the HAZ can be of varying size and strength. The thermal diffusivity of the base material plays a large role—if the diffusivity is high, the material cooling rate is high and the HAZ is relatively small. Conversely, a low diffusivity leads to slower cooling and a larger HAZ. The amount of heat injected by the welding process plays an important role as well, as processes like oxyacetylene welding have an unconcentrated heat input and increase the size of the HAZ. Processes like laser beam welding give a highly concentrated, limited amount of heat, resulting in a small HAZ. Arc welding falls between these two extremes, with the individual processes varying somewhat in heat input. To calculate the heat input for arc welding procedures, the following formula can be used: ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{increasing}} {{requirements of}} car body manufacturers concerning formability and load of sheet metal structures necessitate new approaches in forming technology.

In the current investigation the use of a laser beam allows for creating very small heat-affected areas of a width from 0. 5 mm up to 5 mm. These areas are characterised by a significantly higher hardness and strength. Depending on the sheet metal material, areas of higher and lower hardness can be produced.

50|$|This {{process is}} often used for knife making, by heating only {{the edge of a}} {{previously}} quenched and tempered blade. When edge turns the proper color temperature, it is quenched, hardening only the edge, but leaving {{most of the rest of}} the blade at the lower hardness.

However, unlike a blade that has been evenly heated and differentially quenched, flame hardening creates a <b>heat-affected</b> <b>zone.</b> Unlike the nioi, the boundary between the hot and cold metal formed by this <b>heat-affected</b> <b>zone</b> causes extremely rapid cooling when quenched.
