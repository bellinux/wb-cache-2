5|$|Mishmar HaEmek's {{cemetery}} {{is located}} in the outskirts of the kibbutz, next to the Palmach Cave. Members of the kibbutz from its past are buried in the cemetery, including five members of the Knesset, many known personalities <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> of culture and society and a few high ranked military officers. Some of the people buried in the cemetery are not from the kibbutz but have some connection to it.|$|E
5|$|Modern historians, doubting that a Persian {{commander}} {{would have}} sabotaged his own invasion, have suggested several other possible scenarios. It is, however, {{impossible to know}} exactly how the Naxians {{became aware of the}} invasion, but undoubtedly they were aware, and began to make preparations. Herodotus tells us that the Naxians had previously had no inkling of the expedition, but that when news arrived they brought everything in <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields,</b> gathered enough food with which to survive a siege and reinforced their walls.|$|E

5|$|An eagle’s {{appearance}} in the sky when thunderclouds threatened was greeted with joy and hope by people who trusted {{in their power to}} defeat an ala; after defeating the ala, the eagle led the clouds away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields.</b> An explanation for this, recorded in eastern Serbia, is that the eagles which nest in the vicinity of a village want thunderstorms and hail as far as possible from their nestlings, so coincidentally protect the village’s fields as well. The role of eagles, however, was controversial, because in the same region there was a belief that an eagle flying in front of thunderstorm clouds was a manifestation of an ala, leading the clouds toward the crops, rather than driving them away.|$|E
5|$|Khubeza, a {{local variety}} of the mallow plant, became an {{important}} food source during the War of Independence. During the siege of Jerusalem, when convoys of food could not reach the city, Jerusalemites {{went out to the}} fields to pick khubeza leaves, which are high in iron and vitamins. The Jerusalem radio station, Kol Hamagen, broadcast instructions for cooking it that were picked up in Jordan convinced the Arabs that the Jews were dying of starvation and victory was at hand. In the past decade, food writers in Israel have encouraged the population to prepare khubeza on Israel Independence Day. Local chefs have begun to serve khubeza and other wild plants gathered <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> in upscale restaurants.|$|E
5|$|On 26 August 1929, {{during the}} 1929 Palestine riots the kibbutz was {{attacked}} by an Arab mob equipped with firearms. The villagers and Arab policemen managed to fend away the rioters. British policemen told the kibbutz to evacuate and promised to take care for their property and the kibbutz left the following day. On 28 August, Arab rioters burned the kibbutz's barn, uprooted trees, stole corn <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> and vandalized two gravestones in the kibbutz's cemetery. It {{was the only time}} in the history of the kibbutz it was abandoned and during the riots 16 other Jewish communities were evacuated.|$|E

The 2:1 ratio of Qatar's cumulative gas production <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> to Iran's is forecasted to continue at least for the short term: by the end of 2011, Qatar's total cumulative production <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> will reach [...] of natural gas, while Iran's will stand at [...] of natural gas in the same year. The ratio is maintained mainly because Qatar's annual production is almost twice the Iranian production level.|$|R

5|$|The poorer {{people were}} also {{alarmed by the}} {{contagion}} and some left the city, {{but it was not}} easy for them to abandon their accommodation and livelihoods for an uncertain future elsewhere. Before exiting through the city gates, they were required to possess a certificate of good health signed by the Lord Mayor and these became increasingly difficult to obtain. As time went by and the numbers of plague victims rose, people living in the villages outside London began to resent this exodus and were no longer prepared to accept townsfolk from London, with or without a certificate. The refugees were turned back, were not allowed to pass through towns and had to travel across country, and were forced to live rough on what they could steal or scavenge <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields.</b> Many died in wretched circumstances of starvation and thirst in the hot summer that was to follow.|$|E
5|$|During {{the worst}} of the storm, 5,800people were {{evacuated}} from shoreline areas of Kauai to temporary shelters. Strong waves sank or grounded several small vessels on the southwestern coast of Kauai, with 44 of the 45 boats at Port Allen being sunk. The worst of the damage from the hurricane occurred in Poipu, where the rough surf destroyed or severely damaged several exposed luxury hotels and condominiums. Elsewhere on the island, damage was greatest in areas where there was no protective barrier reef offshore. Several small aircraft were damaged at Lihue airport from the winds, including many overturned small planes. The winds destroyed several buildings across the island, including one of Kauai's oldest churches and a warehouse. Additionally, the winds destroyed the roof of a bank. Strong winds initially left the entire island of Kauai without power. Highway 56 {{on the east side of}} the island was obstructed by fallen telephone poles, forcing residents to drive on the unpaved, red dirt cane roads usually reserved for hauling sugar cane <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields.</b> Rising waters washed out multiple roads near the coastline. The strong winds destroyed nearly all papaya and banyan trees on the island. The hurricane destroyed or greatly damaged 1,907 homes on the island and caused minor damage to 2,983 others, leaving one-eighth of the island's homes unlivable.|$|E

25|$|Toilet {{facilities}} were grossly insufficient {{for such a}} large workforce. They were often unspeakably filthy, overflowing with human waste and covered with flies. Drinking water was a mile <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> and Durst refused to supply any to the pickers under his employ, instead allowing his cousin to operate a commercial lemonade wagon. Furthermore, the lemonade was an inferior synthetic brew, sold for five cents a glass.|$|E
25|$|The new strain grew {{easily and}} abundantly, {{producing}} a surplus {{that could be}} sold cheaply abroad. Ayutthaya, situated at the southern extremity of the floodplain, thus became the hub of economic activity. Under royal patronage, corvée labour dug canals on which rice was brought <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> to the king's ships for export to China. In the process, the Chao Phraya Delta—-mud flats between the sea and firm land hitherto considered unsuitable for habitation—-was reclaimed and placed under cultivation. Traditionally the king had a duty to perform a religious ceremony blessing the rice plantation.|$|E
25|$|The {{ownership}} of land, animals, and resources takes several forms. Within an oasis or settled zone {{belonging to a}} particular clan, land, trees (usually date palms), and nearby wells may have different owners. Each family's rights {{to the use of}} particular plots of land are recognized by other clan members. Families also may have privileged access to certain wells and the right to a part of the harvest <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> irrigated by their water. Within the clan and family contexts, individuals also may have personal claims to palm trees and animals.|$|E

25|$|These {{ornamental}} gardens {{were probably}} {{laid out in}} the early 19th century as a peaceful retreat for the family. The gardens have recently been returned to their original design with pools, summerhouses and plants appropriate to the period. A tunnel leads from the flowergarden to the dell and carries a causeway at high level across the gardens to allow the cattle, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> to the south of the garden, to be taken to the farm for milking without entering the gardens. The tunnel entrance is faced with large stones to give it the appearance of a natural cave.|$|E
