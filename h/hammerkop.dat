25|$|Due to a nomenclatorial dispute, {{the generic}} name Scops {{is not used}} by either the scops or the screech owls (which when only a few species were known were placed together), nor by any other animal. In 1760, Mathurin Jacques Brisson had {{established}} the genus Scopus for the <b>hammerkop,</b> a peculiar African bird. Paul Möhring in 1758 had already used the name Scops for this bird however, and believing this name to be valid Morten Thrane Brünnich replaced Scopus with it in 1772. The scops and screech owls, which were placed in Otus by Thomas Pennant in 1769 (as he too believed that Moehring's Scops was valid) were moved to Scops by Marie Jules César Savigny in 1809. Lorenz Oken in 1817 changed this to Scopus, also {{under the impression that}} Scops was the older name for the <b>hammerkop,</b> and valid.|$|E

Hence, Scopus as established by Brisson is indeed the valid generic name of the <b>hammerkop,</b> and the first valid use of Scops was in 1772 by Brünnich – which according to modern rules of zoological nomenclature was unjustified however, as the name he believed to be reinstating had never been technically valid in the first place.|$|E
2500|$|Nothing {{is known}} for sure about the {{colouration}} of these birds, as they have not left living descendants. But some inferences can be made based on their phylogeny: {{if they were a}} member of the [...] "higher waterbird" [...] group (see below), they most probably had a plumage similar to that depicted in the reconstruction of Osteodontornis orri – Procellariiformes and Pelecaniformes in the modern sense (or Ciconiiformes, if Pelecaniformes are merged there) have hardly any carotenoid or structural colors at all in their plumage, and generally lack even phaeomelanins. Thus, the only colours commonly found in these birds are black, white and various shades of grey. Some have patches of iridescent feathers, or brownish or reddish hues, but these are rare and limited in extent, and those species in which they are found (e.g. bitterns, ibises or the <b>hammerkop)</b> are generally only found in freshwater habitat.|$|E

The local people are mainly Maasai, but people {{from other parts of the}} country have settled there attracted by the successful tourist-driven economy and intensive agriculture along the system of swamps that makes this low-rainfall area (average 350 mm) one of the best wildlife-viewing experiences in the world with 400 species of birds including water birds, pelicans, kingfishers, crakes, <b>hammerkops</b> and 47 types of raptor.|$|R

5000|$|On 1 May 1903 {{she faced}} 12 rivals in the 1000 Guineas at Newmarket and was ridden by Herbert Randall. Baroness La Fleche started the race as the 15/8 favourite. Also {{near the front}} of the betting was Skyscraper at 9/4, Quintessence at 4/1 and <b>Hammerkop</b> at 100/7. At the start three fillies - Sun Rose, Guigne and <b>Hammerkop</b> - got tangled in the webbing. In the early stages Skyscraper, Quintessence and Baroness La Fleche led the race on the left of the track, with another group of three just behind them racing down the centre of the track. With about two furlongs left to run Quintessence just headed Skyscraper. Sun Rose made {{progress}} through the field in the latter stages of the race, recovering from her poor start, but was unable to catch Quintessence. Quintessence won by one and a half lengths from Sun Rose, with Skyscraper in third place. Dazzling finished fourth, with favourite Baroness La Fleche finishing back in sixth place. After the race a protest was put in against the poor start, by Prince Soltykoff, the owner of Sun Rose. However, the protest was lodged a minute after the 15 minutes allowed for objections so could not be entered. She was not entered for most of the major summer and early autumn stakes races due to her chronic problems with rheumatism. The cause of this malady was thought to be due to her habit of [...] "tearing all the clothing off in her box." [...] In September she won the Park Hill Stakes at Doncaster and the following month she beat three rivals to easily win the Newmarket Oaks, which was worth £450. She was retired to stud {{at the end of the}} 1903 season, finishing her career unbeaten in her six races.|$|E
5000|$|Among certain African tribes the <b>hammerkop</b> is {{believed}} to be the lightning bird. Among others the lightning bird {{is believed}} to manifest itself only through lightning, except to women, to whom it reveals itself as a bird. In these instances the bird is of imaginary nature and may take several forms. In one instance a village girl described a black rooster-like bird that ran up her hoe and left claw marks on her body before it flew back to the clouds. In other instances it is described as having iridescent feathers like a peacock's or a fiery red tail, bill and legs. Most supposed sightings describe the lightning bird as a winged creature the size of a man, when needed it can indeed masquerade as a human, but usually it's a huge black and white bird of prey.|$|E
5000|$|Spearmint {{made good}} {{progress}} over the winter, and Gilpin planned {{to prepare the}} colt to challenge for the Grand Prix de Paris at Longchamp in June, a race which had not been won by a British horse since the victory of Spearmint's maternal grandsire Minting in 1886. By spring, however, Admirable Crichton {{failed to make the}} expected progress between two and three, while Flair sustained a serious injury after winning the 1000 Guineas, leaving Spearmint as the stable's only viable Derby contender. He did not race in public before the Derby but beat Pretty Polly in a private trial race. and the Cesarewitch winner <b>Hammerkop.</b> When the results of this [...] "private" [...] trial became public, Spearmint began to attract serious support in the betting markets, and his odds fell from 20/1 on 15 May to 11/2 a week later.|$|E

5000|$|If {{it was a}} {{terrestrial}} animal, {{it might}} have been fairly short-necked; if it inhabited wetlands, its neck was probably not short and quite possibly rather long. The bill of Eremopezus was of unknown shape, but must in some way have been adapted to its feeding. Even if not a predator, being as it seems a member of the Neoaves its not-too-distant ancestors probably fed on animals. If it fed on terrestrial prey, it might have had the hooked bill of a bird of prey, but this is very specialized. Among the [...] "higher waterbirds" [...] that variously consume aquatic and/or terrestrial large invertebrates and small vertebrates, a spear-like pointed bill seems to have proven most apt for the task. The Pelecaniformes in particular have a distinct hook or [...] "nail" [...] on the billtip, which is even present in the otherwise plesiomorphic bill of the <b>hammerkop</b> (Scopus umbretta). If E. eocaenus was a pelecaniform, it probably also possessed this [...] "nail", but apart from that its bill might just as well have evolved autapomorphies as bizarre as those of the pelicans.|$|E
