5|$|The keep {{is unusual}} {{both for the}} period and for Devon as a whole, being a very strong {{defensive}} structure, albeit without any independent source of water or facilities to support a garrison {{in the event of}} a siege. Other rectangular 11th century keeps in Devon existed, including at <b>Exter</b> and Lydford, and were typically associated with the king or major nobles. Few were built on top of fresh mottes, as at Okehampton, and this may have been made possible in this case because the motte was largely natural and therefore able to support the heavy weight.|$|E
25|$|Many of the {{abstract}} artists in Russia became Constructivists believing that art {{was no longer}} something remote, but life itself. The artist must become a technician, learning to use the tools and materials of modern production. Art into life! was Vladimir Tatlin's slogan, and {{that of all the}} future Constructivists. Varvara Stepanova and Alexandre <b>Exter</b> and others abandoned easel painting and diverted their energies to theatre design and graphic works.|$|E
25|$|In 1909 Agnes and Helen {{returned}} to Berlin and traveled {{from there to}} Munich, where Agnes studied briefly under Julius <b>Exter,</b> and on to Rome, Florence, and Venice before returning to Chicago. They traveled to Europe for the third, and last, time in 1913, spending a year in Paris. There, they made friends with American artists and musicians who had gathered there around the local art scene. Throughout this period, the work Agnes produced was skillful but unoriginal—drawings, etching, and paintings in the dominant academic and impressionist styles.|$|E
50|$|Having {{figured out}} {{the identities of the}} <b>Exters,</b> Sayaka hopes to be rid of them once and for all. She had the {{principal}} of St. Ignacio's force the Etiquette Club to disband within 24 hours or face expulsion. Reika knows this is all a Makuhari plot and heads towards their main building. Upon arrival, she is held captive. At night, the remaining <b>Exters</b> hold off Sayaka's Four Divas (leaders of the sports clubs who do Sayaka's dirty work). Kanami easily disposes of the Four Divas and join Rie, Saori and Shihoko in Josephine Rose to rescue Reika. Suddenly, a large fortress appears with Sayaka and Todou at the helm hoping to bring down the <b>Exters</b> forever, but Josephine Rose held its own and unleashes its own power to knock out the flying fortress. As if things weren't bad for Sayaka, her mother overheard everything happening at school. She informs Sayaka that she's reinstated the Etiquette Club in order to teach her humility and modesty, and should a cowardly act be repeated, there would be consequences. Sayaka swallows her pride and accepts her loss and calls a retreat. The show ends with the <b>Exters</b> proud of defending their club, their honor {{and the rest of the}} world.|$|R

5000|$|On March 8, 2003, <b>Exter</b> and Boston College forward Patrick Eaves were racing {{for an open}} puck {{with about}} six {{minutes left in the}} game. <b>Exter</b> and Eaves collided, with Eaves' left hip {{striking}} <b>Exter</b> in the head. The resulting hit knocked Exter's helmet from his head. As Exter's head hit the ice, he was knocked unconscious and blood began to pour from both of his ears. Paramedics on standby for the game and trainers from both Merrimack and Boston college treated <b>Exter</b> and immobilized him before removing him from the ice and transporting him to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Upon admission, <b>Exter</b> was in a critical condition and was put in a medically induced coma for ten days, and doctors suggested that he retire from hockey. After ten days, <b>Exter</b> was taken off sedatives and started to acknowledge questions by a series of blinks. In less than three weeks, <b>Exter</b> was moved to Spaulding Rehabilitation Center, where he re-learned to speak and to swallow. A week later, <b>Exter</b> was released to his Cranston home. <b>Exter</b> would later say that he did not blame Eaves for the hit, and that the incident was [...] "a hockey play." ...|$|E

5000|$|With the Mitsuido Bank robbery a bust, Sayaka {{takes her}} anger out on Todou for his cowardice. In {{order to get}} back in her good graces, Todou hatches a plan to lure of the new members of <b>Exters</b> to deliver the AIES to Makuhari. Sayaka accepts his offer and warns him not to {{disappoint}} her again. Back at school in the Etiquette Club, Rie rides Saori, Shihoko and Kanami like a drill sergeant to make them stronger and powerful pilots. Nearby, the robbers from the Mitsuido heist are joined by another man and Todou steps out in a priest's outfit. The next day, Saori heads off to school alone and is confronted by Todo's gang who try to rape her until Todou assaults them and knocks them down. Saori is immediately awe-struck with Todo who introduces himself as [...] "Brother Gilbert". At school, Todou becomes the substitute teacher and easily gains Saori's trust. She hoped to kiss him to repay him for saving her life, but instead Todou slips a drug into her mouth which has hypnotic effects. Soon, Saori was ordered under hypnosis to retrieve the AIES from her Battle Skipper and bring it to him and to make sure to dispose of anyone who interferes. However, the remaining <b>Exters</b> snap Saori out of her trance and explain Todou's deceit. Infuriated that she was used, Saori unleashes her anger on Todou, but not before his men destroy the base and rescue him. The <b>Exters</b> chase the Makuhari Battle Skippers all over Tokyo and Saori decides to use the AIES combat software to pay back Todou. However, Todou has tricks up his sleeve as well as his Battle Skipper and 3 other Makuhari Battle Skippers form a giant robot. Reika and Rie use their own Battle Skippers to form a powerful ring of energy to destroy the giant robot and force Todou and his men to retreat. Back at their ruined base, Reika reveals to the <b>Exters</b> the true base known as [...] "Josephine Rose".|$|R
5000|$|Todou (藤堂 Todō (藤堂 Todō)) is Sayaka's {{personal}} assistant and whipping boy. He is a bishōnen {{who would do}} anything for Sayaka, since he has a crush on her.

50|$|<b>Exter</b> {{completed}} {{a series of}} rehabilitation tests {{within a week of}} therapy and decided that he was still could play hockey. By August, he was training on Merrimack's ice. Despite the numerous weeks of training and therapy, <b>Exter</b> received minimal interest from scouts. He would receive an offer from Pittsburgh Penguins scout Greg Malone, who had been scouting <b>Exter</b> prior to his accident. <b>Exter</b> eventually signed with the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, the Penguins' AHL affiliate, on December 24, 2003, and was immediately assigned to the Penguins' ECHL affiliate in Wheeling.|$|E

40|$|The {{subject of}} my thesis is Russian artist Alexandra <b>Exter’s</b> {{work in the}} {{performing}} arts, {{with a focus on}} her theatrical set and costume designs in the Kamerny Theater, her creations for Iakov Protazanov’s 1924 science fiction film, Aelita, and finally her exquisitely fabricated set of approximately forty marionettes. Within these colorful wooden figures are reconciled conflicting notions of stasis and dynamism, sculpture and performer, human and object. Drawing upon Victor Shklovskiĭ’s formalist definition of “enstrangement,” I examine her introduction of the object in place of the human performer as a means of exposing the creative process, forcing the viewer to actively engage with the production. Thus, her manipulation and eventual replacement of the human performer not only exemplifies the interconnectivity and mutability of Russian avant-garde art, but impels the viewer to reconsider the familiar in terms of the strange, ultimately calling attention to the humanity of the dehumanized performer...|$|R

40|$|In {{the first}} part of this paper we study the {{relaxation}} behaviour of a viscoelastic fluid in a rigid sphere, with the aim of understanding the dynamics of the vitreous humour within the vitreous chamber. The assumption of small displacements and velocities of fluid particles allows us to linearise the equations of motion. Expanding the velocity and pressure fields as a superposition of spherical harmonic functions and demanding the solution to be non-trivial leads to the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the system, which depend on the rheological model we use to describe the stress in the fluid. We consider two different models, and for both we find the existence of complex eigenvalues, the imaginary parts of which represent natural frequencies of oscillation of the system. Next, we consider the fluid motion driven by small-amplitude azimuthal torsional oscillations of the domain, which represent saccades of the eyeball. We compute the time-averaged total kinetic energy of the system and show that it assumes large values when the system is forced at resonant frequencies, at which the velocity away from the boundary becomes larger than at the boundary. Finally, we study the effect of a weak departure of the shape of the domain from a sphere, focussing on myopic eyes, which are enlarged in all directions, but mostly along the antero-posterior axis. We find that myopia significantly influences the distribution as well as the magnitude of the stress that is <b>extered</b> on the retina...|$|R
40|$|Using fused-silica {{capillary}} gas chromatography, {{we investigated}} sebum samples from 55 healthy individuals {{to discover the}} effects of aging on the sebaceous gland activity and on the fatty acid composition of wax <b>exters.</b> The sebaceous gland activity, which was expressed by the ratio of wax esters/[cholesterol + cholesterol esters] (WE/[C + CE]), showed a distinct change from infancy through maturity to senescence; {{the curve of the}} ratio made a peak in our subjects's 20 s. Using the fatty acid analyses, we found an interesting relationship between C 16 : 1 straight and C 16 : 1 iso-branched chains, each of which occupied a large proportion in the fatty acids of wax esters; the former increased in proportion from infancy toward the 20 s, with a correlation with aging (r = 0. 788, p < 0. 01), and decreased thereafter until our subjects's 50 s (r = - 0. 611, p < 0. 01). In contrast, the proportion of the latter followed an entirely reversed course with advancing age. The percentages of C 16 : 1 straight chain components were correlated positively with the WE/[C+CE] ratio (r = 0. 642, p < 0. 01), while there was found to be a negative correlation between the proportion of C 16 : 1 iso-branched chain components and the WE/[C+CE] ratio (r = - 0. 556, p < 0. 01). The results suggest that more active sebaceous glands in lipid production excrete lipids with a higher proportion of C 16 : 1 straight chain fatty acid and a lower proportion of C 16 : 1 iso-branched chain fatty acid. As well as the sebaceous gland activity, the fatty acid composition in sebum wax esters is affected by advancing age in Japanese...|$|R
50|$|The story opens as Sayaka Kitaouji {{takes off}} from space and head towards Earth in her private shuttle where Todou briefs her on Uruyasu's stocks. On Earth, at St. Ignacio's School for Girls, two freshmen Saori Tachibana and Shihoko Sakaki head towards Orientation Day in the school's auditorium. Sayaka makes a {{powerful}} speech {{in order to}} receive more members for the already popular Debutante Club. Etiquette Club VP Rie Shibusawa tries her best to make a speech herself but ends up failing as president Reika Ayanokoji looks on in disbelief. The failed speech inspires Shihoko to join the Etiquette Club and brings Saori and their newfound friend Kanami Ezaki to the clubhouse. Once inside, arrows came flying out. Saori ducks under one, Kanami chops another in midair, but Shihoko was hit with the arrow. Luckily, it was a prop arrow. Reika and Rie explain everything about the Etiquette Club in detail to the new girls in hopes of improving their skills. At the end of the day, Sayaka heads off campus and informs Todou to take some men and rob the Mitsuido Bank, a bank that finances most of Uruyasu. Later that night, Saori, Shihoko and Kanami each sneak into the Etiquette Clubhouse and try to uncover its secret. They soon discover an underground base with Battle Skippers. Each of the girls pilot the Battle Skippers to where Reika and Rie are: the Mitsuido Bank. To the shock of Reika and Rie and even Todou's men, the new girls arrived and stopped the robbery. Todou decided to cut his losses and run, but his associates were soon captured by Reika and Rie and handed them over to the authorities. Back at base, Rie scolded Kanami, Saori and Shihoko for their reckless and foolish act, but Reika calmed her down and decided to welcome the girls as official members of <b>Exters.</b>|$|R
