40|$|A device (1) {{serves to}} detect the {{blocking}} of an electric motor connected to an a. c. power supply (Ph, Mp), said device having a measuring instrument (4) for measuring the e. m. f. voltage of the motor (10), a control device (2), a synchronizing device (3) and an <b>off</b> <b>button</b> (5). The <b>off</b> <b>button</b> (5) has an actuator (9) switched in series with the motor (10). With {{the help of the}} control device, the <b>off</b> <b>button</b> is controlled so that the flow of current to the motor (10) is interrupted for one a. c. voltage period, following which current is allowed to flow again during a voltage half-wave which is of opposite pole to the last voltage half-wave of the current-flowing phase. In this last current-flowing phase, there is an increased current drain and, as a result, there is a greater e. m. p. signal when the e. m. p. voltage is measured. As a result of this large e. m. p signal, the difference of the e. m. p. voltages between the blocked and non-blocked operating states of the motor is much greater and c an thus be evaluated more easily and more reliably (Fig. 1) ...|$|R

40|$|Some {{actions are}} more sensative {{than others to}} the number of times they are {{performed}}. The action of putting a coin in a piggy bank, for example, will produce the effect of n coins in the bank if it is performed n times. Consider, however, a TV set with dedicated on and <b>off</b> <b>buttons.</b> The action of pressing the <b>off</b> <b>button</b> will produce the effect of turning the TV off if it is performed n times, so long as n> 0. In the case of the piggy bank, n is a variable which {{must be taken into account}} when calculating the effect, while in the case of the TV set, once the threshold n = 1 has been reached, n can be discounted in calculating the effect. There are even situations where n plays a more complex role in producing an effect. Consider the case of a light switch which toggles between on and off. If the act of flipping the light switch has been performed n times and we wish to calculate the net effect, we must know both i) the initial state of the switch, and ii) whether n is odd or even. Of course, usually we can simply observe the effects of our actions, and we do not need to explicitly calculate them (and thus we can avoid wasting energy pushing the <b>off</b> <b>button</b> on the TV repeatedly...|$|R

50|$|Though the {{traditional}} FSMs {{are an excellent}} tool for tackling smaller problems, it's also generally known {{that they tend to}} become unmanageable, even for moderately involved systems. Due to the phenomenon known as state and transition explosion, the complexity of a traditional FSM tends to grow much faster than the complexity of the system it describes. This happens because {{the traditional}} state machine formalism inflicts repetitions. For example, if you try to represent the behavior of a simple pocket calculator with a traditional FSM, you'll immediately notice that many events (e.g., the Clear or <b>Off</b> <b>button</b> presses) are handled identically in many states. A conventional FSM shown in the figure below, has no means of capturing such a commonality and requires repeating the same actions and transitions in many states. What's missing in the traditional state machines is the mechanism for factoring out the common behavior in order to share it across many states.|$|R
