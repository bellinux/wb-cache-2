40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} {{a way to}} build a natural language interface (NLI) over semantically rich data. Speciﬁcally we show this over the MusicBrainz domain, inspired by the second shared task of the QALD- 1 workshop. Our approach uses the tool C-Phrase [4] to build an NLI over a set of views deﬁned over the original MusicBrainz relational database. C-Phrase uses a limited variant of X-Bar theory [3] for syntax and tuple calculus for semantics. The C-Phrase authoring tool works over any domain and only the end conﬁguration has to be redone for each new database covered – a task that does not require deep <b>knowledge</b> <b>about</b> <b>linguistics</b> and system internals. Working over the MusicBrainz domain was a challenge due {{to the size of}} the database – quite a lot of eﬀort went into optimizing computation times and memory usage to manageable levels. This paper reports on this work and anticipates a live demonstration for querying by the publi...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} discusses {{about an}} analysis of the directive speech acts used in english speaking class at the third semester of english speaking class of english study program of IAIN STS Jambi. The aims of this research are to describe the types of directive speech acts and politeness strategies that found in English speaking class. This research used descriptive qualitative method. This method used to describe clearly about the types and politeness strategies of directive speech acts based on the data in English speaking class. The result showed that in English speaking class that there are some types and politeness strategies of directive speech acts, such as: requestives, questions, requirements, prohibitives, permissives, and advisores as types, as well as on-record indirect strategies (prediction statement, strong obligation statement, possibility statement, weaker obligation statement, volitional statement), direct strategies (imperative, performative), and nonsentential strategies as politeness strategies. The achievement of this research are hoped can be additional <b>knowledge</b> <b>about</b> <b>linguistics</b> study, especially in directive speech acts and can be developed for future researches.

40|$|We {{present a}} user-centered model for porting natural {{language}} interfaces (NLIs) between domains efficiently. The model assumes that domain experts without any background <b>knowledge</b> <b>about</b> computational <b>linguistics</b> will perform the customization of the NLI {{to a specific}} domain. In fact, it merely requires familiarity with the underlying knowledge base {{as well as with}} a few basic subcategorization types. Our model is iterative {{in the sense that the}} adaption of the NLI is performed in several cycles on the basis of the questions which the NLI failed to answer, thus iteratively increasing the coverage of the system. We provide experimental evidence in form of a user study as well as a case study involving a real-world application corroborating that our model is indeed a feasible way of customizing the interface to a certain domain.

40|$|This is {{an upper}} {{division}} course {{that has been}} certified as a General Education Course {{in the area of}} “Lifelong Learning”. The course also is part of a “Social Justice” GE Path, which encourages students to select their GE courses around a particular theme. The course draws students from a variety of undergraduate majors, including Psychology, Business Law, Political Science, History and Sociology. The course investigates the role that language and linguistics play in the legal written and oral discourse. In doing so, it hopes to serve two purposes: (1) to illustrate and explicate essential qualities of natural languages and language use, most notably in the areas of semantics, pragmatics, discourse analysis and sociolinguistics with the help of examples from the legal discourse and (2) to examine the functioning of the legal system where it interacts with language, taking into account what is known about language form and use from the field of linguistics. The course emphasizes active student participation and an explicit connection between theory and practice. Students apply their acquired <b>knowledge</b> <b>about</b> <b>linguistics</b> and the law to practical and current societal issues in the form of class presentations, weekly electronic postings, a term paper {{and a variety of other}} activities. Some of the questions and topics that are addressed in this course are: - How does legal language differ from other registers in terms of sentence structure, vocabulary and pronunciation? Why is it used? Does it work (for legal and lay audiences) and is it necessary? Challenges and successes of the Plain English Movement. - What determines the meaning of an expression? Distinguishing word meaning, sentence meaning and speaker intent. To what extent can the meaning of a text be determined by just looking at the text itself? Textualism, Originalism and the issue of “Activist Judges. ” - The language of police cautions, requests to search property, requests to speak to a lawyer: how consensual are consensual searches? The role and interpretation of indirectness in discourse. - Bribery, threats and perjury. How can one establish that someone has attempted to bribe someone else? How do we know that the bribe has been accepted? When does a threat “count”? Characteristics of conversations that signal cooperation, specific intent or lack thereof. - Conversational turn taking rules in the courtroom and their effects: for example, the relative powers of attorneys and witnesses in creating a narrative; questioning techniques. - Code switching and dialects in the court room: Stylistic and dialectal code switches by attorneys and their possible effect on jurors; the effects of non-standard language use by witnesses on the perceived veracity of the testimony. - Interpreters and the law: The challenges of interpreting testimony and language rights. - How unique are human voices and pronunciations? Can one determine authorship based on orthographic, grammatical and lexical characteristics of a text?

40|$|M. Ed. (Education) This study {{focuses on}} the {{teaching}} of linguistic rules and structures in rural informal Settlement Schools. The inquiry was undertaken {{with the aim of}} determining what the nature of instruction of grammar, specifically tense, is and what teachers' conceptions of the pedagogy of grammar are. The rationale for the study was that there is virtually no research on the language pedagogy knowledge of practice of unqualified teachers in community schools. Teachers in this type of setting needed to be exposed to contemporary theory of Second Language instruction with the view of improving their pedagogy. This also needed to be researched in order to contribute to the body of knowledge [...] The rural settlement schools where semi-qualified teachers are still found in increasing numbers, need competent teachers who can teach students to function socially as well as linguistically. For relevant teacher education curricula research is needed to inform policy. Literature review was done and field investigation was conducted to determine teachers' conceptions of grammar and tenses. Data were collected through interviews and observations. These data were consolidated and clustered across five sources of different methods. The categories of data indicated that teachers' knowledge of rules was limited. The research was concluded with suggestions pertaining to the researcher's experience of semi-qualified teachers. It was suggested that teachers should not only concentrate on grammar knowledge but also on the <b>knowledge</b> <b>about</b> pedagogy and <b>linguistics.</b> The involvement of INSET programmes in this respect was strongly recommended...|$|R
