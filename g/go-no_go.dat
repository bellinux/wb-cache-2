40|$|BACKGROUND: Emotional {{impairments}} {{are important}} determinants of functional outcome in psychosis, and current treatments {{are not particularly}} effective. Modafinil is a wake-promoting drug that {{has been shown to}} improve emotion discrimination in healthy individuals and attention and executive function in schizophrenia. We aimed to establish whether modafinil might have a role in the adjuvant treatment of emotional impairments in the first episode of psychosis, when therapeutic endeavor is arguably most vital. METHODS: Forty patients with a first episode of psychosis participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design study testing the effects of a single dose of 200 mg modafinil on neuropsychological performance. Emotional functions were evaluated with the emotional face recognition test, the affective <b>go-no</b> <b>go</b> task, and the reward and punishment learning test. Visual analogue scales were used throughout the study to assess subjective mood changes. RESULTS: Modafinil significantly improved the recognition of sad facial expressions (z = 2. 98, p =. 003). In contrast, there was no effect of modafinil on subjective mood ratings, on tasks measuring emotional sensitivity to reward or punishment, or on interference of emotional valence on cognitive function, as measured by the affective <b>go-no</b> <b>go</b> task. CONCLUSIONS: Modafinil improves the analysis of emotional face expressions. This might enhance social function in people with a first episode of psychosis...|$|E

In order {{to investigate the}} role of different stimulus attributes in discriminative performance, two short musical excerpts differing in their melodic pattern, but maintaining the number, pitch, and duration of notes constant were provided in two different timbres, to obtain four different complex auditory stimuli. According to the experimental condition, the discriminative stimuli were, therefore, different in structure, in timbre or in both aspects. The animals were able to discriminate efficiently among the musical sequences only when cues furnished by timbre were available, whereas melodic differences made no difference. In the experimental setting used, the rat's discrimination of complex auditory stimuli appears, therefore, to be based neither on the melody nor on a compound of melody and timbre,but simply on {{the properties of the}} timbre of the stimuli...|$|E

The study of inhibi-tory control in both normal adults and persons with ADHD is leading to prog-ress in this area, {{thanks in large part to}} advances in functional magnetic reso-nance imaging (fMRI). Increasingly, in-vestigators perform event-related fMRI, in which the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal (a mea-sure of blood flow to a brain region) is measured after each presentation of stimuli of a task during the fMRI acqui-sition.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to determine whether sequential (i. e., serial) ablation of the monkey's orbital prefrontal cortex would lead to a reduction in the severity of the behavioral impairment usually associated with one-stage bilateral removal of this tissue. The lateral orbital cortex was ablated in four operations spaced 3 weeks apart or in a one-stage procedure. The monkeys were examined on a visual <b>go-no</b> <b>go</b> differentiation task, spatial delayed-alternation, and object reversal learning. The results reveal no differences between the effects of sequential and one-stage ablations. These findings differ from previous experiments that demonstrated a degree of functional recovery after the sequential removal of a sector of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Since lesion studies with infant monkeys have also demonstrated that functional recovery occurs after early ablation of dorsolateral cortex but not after early removal of orbital frontal cortex, recovery of behavioral functions after infant and sequential lesions may involve similar neural mechanisms...|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{observation}} of graspable objects recruits the same motor representations involved in their actual manipulation. Recent evidence suggests that the presentation of nouns referring to graspable objects may exert similar effects. So far, however, it is not clear to what extent the modulation of the motor system during object observation overlaps with that related to noun processing. To address this issue, 2 behavioral experiments were carried out using a <b>go-no</b> <b>go</b> paradigm. Healthy participants were presented with photos and nouns of graspable and non-graspable natural objects. Also scrambled images and pseudowords obtained from the original stimuli were used. At a go-signal onset (150 ms after stimulus presentation) participants had to press a key when the stimulus referred to a real object, using their right (Experiment 1) or left (Experiment 2) hand, and refrain from responding when a scrambled image or a pseudoword was presented. Slower responses were found for both photos and nouns of graspable objects as compared to non-graspable objects, independent of the responding hand. These findings suggest that processing seen graspable objects and written nouns referring to graspable objects similarly modulates the motor system...|$|E

In Experiment 1, after 20 days of overtraining, a whole reversal, in which both discrimination tasks were reversed, produced more rapid reversal than a partial condition, in {{which one of the}} two discriminations was reversed whereas the other was maintained as in original learning. Conversely, after 2 days of overtraining rats in the partial condition reversed faster than did those in the whole condition. Experiment 2 essentially replicated results of Experiment 1. Experiments 1 and 2 show that a stimulus function transfer and stimulus substitutability, respectively, are most clearly evident after 20 days of overtraining.

40|$|In {{this talk}} we will present an {{overview}} of experimental paradigms originating in social psychology that might be useful for revivificating indirect linguistic attitude research (a field that has seen only minor methodological innovations {{since its inception in}} the 1960 s). In particular, we will suggest that the AMP paradigm offers an interesting perspective. Despite the abundance of new methods to explore implicit attitudes in social psychology in recent decades (Wittenbrink & Swarz 2007), the application of these techniques in linguistics has been limited. The first steps in the direction of adapting implicit techniques from social psychology for linguistic research have been taken by Pantos (2010), Redinger (2010) and Campbell-Kibler (2012, 2013) for the Implicit Association Test (IAT) and by Speelman et al. (2013) for the affective priming paradigm (AP), both obtaining promising results. However, {{when it comes to the}} potential these implicit measures hold for linguistic research, only the surface has been scratched. Moreover, many more implicit techniques are used in various fields of social psychology. Just a few examples are the <b>Go-No</b> <b>Go</b> Association Task (Nosek and Banaji 2001), the Single Category IAT (Teige-Mocigemba et al. 2010), the semantic priming paradigm (Wentura & Degner 2010), the Identification Extrinsic Affective Simon Task (De Houwer &...|$|E

The discriminations were based on colour in Experiment 1, and on shape in Experiment 2. The stimuli were presented in one or other visual field, and the subjects responded with the fingers of one or other hand, allowing the dierences in reaction time between crossed and uncrossed responses (CUD) to be calculated. For the normal subjects the CUD tended to diminish with the complexity of the tasks, suggesting that both hemispheres were increasingly involved. Unlike R.

He was better able to transfer information from the right to the left hemisphere than vice versa, but an analysis of his accuracy under the crossed conditions showed that the amount transferred was always well under one bit.

Therefore, this study aimed to compare executive function and behavioral inhibition within patients suffering from schizophrenia, bipolar type I as well as a normal group. Methods: In this descriptive-comparative study, out of all patients hospitalized in daily psychiatric clinic in Najafabad in 2014 due to these disorders, 20 schizophrenia and 20 bipolar type I as well as 20 normal individuals were selected via the convinience sampling. All the study participants completed the computerizing tests including Tower of London and <b>Go-No</b> <b>Go.</b> The study data were analyzed utilizing SPSS software (ver 22) via MANOVA. Results: The study findings revealed {{a significant difference between the}} two patient groups and the normal group in regard with executive function and behavioral inhibition (p< 0. 05), whereas no differences were detected between schizophrenics and bipolar patient groups. Furthermore, patients suffering from schizophrenia and bipolar I mood disorder demonstrated significantly poor {{performance in}} cognitive function and behavioral inhibition compared to the normal group.

Cognition and mood are important determinants of quality of life in PD patients and must be assessed for safety control. Methods: Seventeen consecutive patients (8 women) who underwent STN DBS for PD have been assessed before and 4 months after surgery.

40|$|International audienceRecent neurophysiological {{and brain}} imaging {{studies have shown}} that the motor system is {{involved}} in language processing. However, it is an open question whether this involvement is a necessary requisite to understand language or rather a side effect of distinct cognitive processes underlying it. In order to clarify this issue we carried out three behavioral experiments, using a <b>go-no</b> <b>go</b> paradigm. Italian verbs expressing hand actions, foot actions or an abstract content served as stimuli. Participants used their right hands to respond. In Experiment 1, in which a semantics decision task with an early delivery of the go signal (during processing language material) was used, slower responses were found for hand action-related verbs than for foot action-related verbs. In Experiment 2, using the same task with either an early or a delayed delivery of the go signal (when language material had been already processed), no difference was found between responses to the two verb categories in the delayed delivery condition. In Experiment 3, in which a lexical decision task with an early delivery of the go signal was used, again no difference between the two verb categories was found. The present findings demonstrate that during language processing the modulation of the motor system crucially occurs while performing a semantics decision task, thus supporting the notion that this involvement is a necessary step to understand language rather than a side effect of upstream cognitive processes...|$|E
40|$|Eight pigeons {{were trained}} on a <b>go-no</b> <b>go</b> visual {{discrimination}} involving 1 S + and 15 S s. The 16 discriminative stimuli were black-and-white line drawings {{created by the}} factorial combination of 4 different geometric shapes (wedge, cylinder, cone, handle) in 4 different spatial locations (right, left, above, below) {{in relation to a}} common shape (cube). All of the pigeons readily learned this complex visual discrimination. Each bird's pecking behavior was controlled by both attributes of the line drawings, but somewhat stronger stimulus control was exerted by the location of the added component than by its shape. Across all 8 pigeons, there was an inverse relation between stimulus control by component shape and component location. These results document pigeons ' joint processing of &quot;what &quot; and &quot;where &quot; informa-tion in visual discrimination learning.

40|$|Quality {{control on}} fruits {{requires}} reliable methods, able to assess with reasonable accuracy and possibly in a non-destructive way their {{physical and chemical}} characteristics. More specifically, a decreased firmness indicates the presence of damage or defects in the fruit or else that the fruit has exceeded its “best before date”, becoming unsuitable for consumption. In high-value exotic fruits, such as mangoes, where firmness cannot be easily measured from a simple observation of texture, colour changes and unevenness of fruits surface, the use of non-destructive techniques is highly recommendable. In particular, the application of Laser vibrometry, based on the Doppler effect, a non-contact technique sensitive to differences in displacements inferior to the nanometre, appears ideal for a possible on-line control on food. Previous results indicated that a phase shift can be in a repeatable way associated {{with the presence of}} damage on the fruit, whilst a decreased firmness results in significant differences in the displacement of the fruits under the same excitation signal. In this work, frequency ranges for quality control via the application of a sound chirp are suggested, based on the measurement of the signal coherence. The variations of the average vibration spectrum of a grid of points, or of pointby-point signal velocity allows the <b>go-no</b> <b>go</b> recognition of “firm ” and “over-ripe ” fruits, with notable success in the particular case of mangoes.

30|$|In {{the present}} study, a {{significant}} contribution of the SES and parental education (especially maternal) to the latent variable executive functions was detected. The inhibitory control (assessed by <b>go-no</b> <b>go</b> tasks for example) occurs late in childhood. At 10 years of age, the ability to inhibit attention to irrelevant stimuli and motor responses is fairly complete, being usually mastered {{at the age of}} 12 (Romine and Reynolds 2005). In agreement with this assumption, in this study, it was found that only between 10 and 12 years, the difference in the go- no go task regarding SES was significant, and low SES children performing poorer in this task compared to those from higher SES. Models that include environmental, biological and cognitive factors try to explain the development of executive functions (Blair and Ursache 2011; Stuss 1992). They integrate the results of empirical research on the physiology of stress, neurocognitive functions and self-regulation and consider the adaptive processes response to adversity of the environment as an aspect of development of the child (Blair and Raver 2012). For example, Stuss (1992) propose a model with three hierarchical levels of processing: sensory-perceptual, executive control and self-reflexivity (metacognition), that interacting with the external environment and are mediated by the frontal lobes. The levels are interrelated and depend on the maturity of primary to higher processes functioning. Also, they are related to the demands of external and internal environment, seeking to maintain the body’s adaptation in different situations. So, living in an adverse environment could impair the development of primaries levels and it would impact in the development of superior levels (Stuss 1992).|$|E
40|$|A {{processing}} {{advantage for}} emotional words relative to neutral words {{has been widely}} demonstrated in the monolingual domain (e. g., Kuperman et al., 2014). It is also well-known that, in bilingual speakers who have {{a certain degree of}} proficiency in their second language, the effects of the affective content of words on cognition are not restricted to the native language (e. g., Ferré et al., 2010). The aim {{of the present study was}} to test whether this facilitatory effect can also be obtained during the very early stages of word acquisition. In the context of a novel word learning paradigm, participants were trained on a set of Basque words by associating them to their Spanish translations. Words’ concreteness and affective valence were orthogonally manipulated. Immediately after the learning phase and 1 week later, participants were tested in a Basque <b>go-no</b> <b>go</b> lexical decision task as well as in a translation task in which they had to provide the Spanish translation of the Basque words. A similar pattern of results was found across tasks and sessions, revealing main effects of concreteness and emotional content as well as an interaction between both factors. Thus, the emotional content facilitated the acquisition of abstract, but not concrete words, in the new language, with a more reliable effect for negative words than for positive ones. The results are discussed in light of the embodied theoretical view of semantic representation proposed by Kousta et al.

40|$|That {{all events}} are equally associable and obey common laws {{is a central}} {{assumption}} of general process learning theory. A continuum of preparedness is denned which holds that organisms are prepared to associate certain events, unprepared for some, and contraprepared for others. A review of data from the traditional learning paradigms shows that the assumption of equivalent associability is false: in classical conditioning, rats are prepared to associate tastes with illness even over very long delays of reinforcement, but are contraprepared to associate tastes with footshock. In instrumental training, pigeons acquire key pecking {{in the absence of}} a contingency between pecking and grain (prepared), while cats, on the other hand, have trouble learning to lick themselves to escape, and dogs do not yawn for food (contra-prepared). In discrimination, dogs are contraprepared to learn that different locations of discriminative stimuli control <b>go-no</b> <b>go</b> responding, and to learn that different qualities control directional responding. In avoidance, re-sponses from the natural defensive repertoire are prepared for avoiding shock, while those from the appetitive repertoire are contraprepared. Language acquisition and the functional autonomy of motives are also viewed using the preparedness continuum. Finally, it is speculated that the laws of learning themselves may vary with the preparedness of the organism for the associa-tion and that different physiological and cognitive mechanisms may covary with the dimension. Sometimes we forget why psychologists ever trained white rats to press bars for lit-tle pellets of flour or sounded metronomes followed by meat powder for domestic dogs. After all, when in the real world do rats encounter levers which they learn to press in order to eat, and when do our pet dogs ever come across metronomes whose clicking signals meat powder? It may be useful now to remind ourselves about a basic premise which gave rise to such bizarre endeavors, and to see if we still have reason to believe this premise...|$|E
40|$|During normal {{assembly}} and disassembly of bolted-joint components, thread damage and/or deformation may occur. If threads are overloaded, thread damage/deformation {{can also be}} anticipated. Typical inspection techniques (e. g. using <b>GO-NO</b> <b>GO</b> gages) may not provide adequate visibility {{of the extent of}} thread damage. More detailed inspection techniques have provided actual pitch-diameter profiles of damaged-hardware holes. A method to predict the reduction in thread shear-out capacity of damaged threaded holes has been developed. This method was based on testing and analytical modeling. Test samples were machined to simulate damaged holes in the hardware of interest. Test samples containing pristine parent-holes were also manufactured from the same bar-stock material to provide baseline results for comparison purposes. After the particular parent-hole thread profile was machined into each sample a helical insert was installed into the threaded hole. These samples were tested in a specially designed fixture to determine the maximum load required to shear out the parent threads. It was determined from the pristine-hole samples that, for the specific material tested, each individual thread could resist an average load of 3980 pounds. The shear-out loads of the holes having modified pitch diameters were compared to the ultimate loads of the specimens with pristine holes. An equivalent number of missing helical coil threads was then determined based on the ratio of shear-out loads for each thread configuration. These data were compared with the results from a finite element model (FEM). The model gave insights into the ability of the thread loads to redistribute for both pristine and simulated damage configurations. In this case, it was determined that the overall potential reduction in thread load-carrying capability in the hardware of interest was equal to having up to three fewer threads in the hole that bolt threads could engage. One- half of this potential reduction was due to local pitch-diameter variations and the other half was due to overall pitch-diameter enlargement beyond Class 2 fit. This result was important in that the thread shear capacity for this particular hardware design was the limiting structural capability. The details of the method development, including the supporting testing, data reduction and analytical model results comparison will be discussed hereafter...|$|E
40|$|The {{stress field}} {{that results from}} two bodies in contact is an {{important}} aspect that governs the fretting fatigue behavior of materials. Applied loads as well as contact geometries influence the contact stresses. The profile of an indenter and the boundary conditions provide sufficient information from which the surface tractions and the corresponding subsurface stresses have been calculated in a semi-infinite halfspace using singular integral equations. In this investigation, a semi-analytical, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) based numerical subroutine is developed to calculate the surface tractions and the corresponding surface and subsurface stresses of an arbitrary finite thickness infinite plate subjected to loading through a random indenter. The numerical subroutine is verified with existing halfspace solutions and with Finite Element Methods (FEM). A fretting fatigue fixture is designed and built to conduct fatigue experiments on relatively thin specimens in contact with arbitrary pad geometries. The numerical subroutine {{is used to calculate}} the stress field of each experiment. The results from the detailed stress analysis of the contact region are required by both an initiation and fracture mechanics approach. While initiation criteria involving stress gradient fields, such as sharp notches and edges of contact in fretting fatigue, are not well established or agreed upon, stress intensity factor calculations using tools such as weight functions are more reliable. The stress intensity analysis, which is used to determine whether an initiated crack will continue to grow if it is above the threshold, depends on many variables in the stress analysis such as pad and specimen geometry, loading configuration and friction coefficient. The contact stress analysis has been used to determine equivalent stress parameters that are related to the initiation of a crack. Similarly the numerical subroutine for the contact stresses is used in conjunction with the stress intensity analysis to determine the influence of the geometry, loading configuration and friction coefficient on the stress intensity factor. Results from high-cycle fretting fatigue experiments are used to determine the threshold stress intensity factor for a given configuration. The combination of the numerical and experimental analysis is then used to develop a tool for high-cycle fretting fatigue based on a threshold approach involving a <b>go-no</b> <b>go</b> criterion. ...|$|E

Neither experiment succeeded in training a purity or a wavelength discrimination. The other two experiments yielded spectral sensitivities under several conditions for the dolphin, the first obtaining intensity difference thresholds to the three monochromatic lights in air and in water under low light intensity conditions, the second obtaining absolute thresholds to the three monochromatic lights in water under low and high intensity conditions. The three sets of sensitivity values obtained under low intensity light conditions were fitted by a Dartnall function peaking at 495 nm. The one set of sensitivity values obtained under high intensity light conditions was fitted by a Dartnall function at 500 nm. Human spectral sensitivity functions obtained in the same underwater conditions indicated a predominantly photopic spectral sensitivity function under high intensity light conditions, and also with the difference thresholds under low intensity light conditions. The absolute thresholds in the low intensity condition were best fitted by a mesopic-shaped spectral sensitivity function, but still peaking at 507 nm. The dolphin function was 0. 5 log units more sensitive than the human function in low intensity light, and 0. 2 log units less sensitive in high intensity light, probably because of the higher density of rods and the lower density of cones in the dolphin eye relative to the human eye. It was concluded that the spectral sensitivity functions obtained for the dolphin represented predominantly cone function at high light intensities and predominantly rod function at low light intensities. The rod and cone functions were so similar that the cones were considered to be means of extending the intensity range over which the dolphin's eye could function, rather than a source of color vision...|$|E
