Entanglement of fibres is more at higher concentrations, increasing the resistance for the <b>ball</b> to <b>fall</b> through.

40|$|A {{new method}} of {{accurate}} {{calculation of the}} coefficient of viscosity of a test liquid from experimentally measured terminal velocity of a <b>ball</b> <b>falling</b> in the test liquid contained in a narrow tube is described. The calculation requires {{the value of a}} multiplicative correction factor to the apparent coefficient of viscosity calculated by substitution of terminal velocity of the <b>falling</b> <b>ball</b> in Stokes formula. This correction factor, the so-called viscosity ratio, a measure of deviation from Stokes limit, arises from non-vanishing values of the Reynolds number and the ball/tube radius ratio. The method, valid over a very wide range of Reynolds number, is based on the recognition of a relationship between two measures of wall effect, the more widely investigated velocity ratio, defined as the ratio of terminal velocity in a confined medium to that in a boundless medium and viscosity ratio. The calculation uses two recently published correlation formulae based on extensive experimental results on terminal velocity of a <b>falling</b> <b>ball.</b> The first formula relates velocity ratio to Reynolds number and ball-tube radius ratio. The second formula gives an expression of the ratio of the drag force actually sensed by the <b>ball</b> <b>falling</b> in an infinite medium to that in the Stokes limit as a function of Reynolds number alone. It is shown that appropriate use of this correction factor extends the utility of the technique of <b>falling</b> <b>ball</b> viscometry beyond the very low Reynolds number 'creepy flow' regime, to which its application is presently restricted. Issues related to accuracy are examined by use of our own measurements of the terminal velocity of a <b>falling</b> <b>ball</b> in a narrow tube and that of published literature reports, on liquids of known viscosity coefficient...|$|R

Clusters are modelled by spherical balls with a given size distribution function, which fall to the substrate and stick to the growing structure. The mobility of clusters along the film surface is modelled by introduction of a critical angle at which a <b>falling</b> <b>ball</b> meets a ball that belongs to the structure. When the <b>falling</b> <b>ball</b> touches one of the balls in the structure at an angle smaller than the critical one, it sticks to the film; otherwise the ball rolls along the surface till it meets other balls.

Accepting, in accordance with Saint-Venant’s principle that at distances far enough from the region the load is applied, it doesn’t matter the manner of applying the load, under the hypothesis of the linear elastic behaviour of material and using a FEA software, the phenomenon is modelled.

Deformed shape of the paper cup in finite element model matched closely with experimental results with ignorable small discrepancies. The paper cup was able to absorb all the kinetic energy of the <b>falling</b> steel <b>ball</b> for the above mentioned falling speed and the ball did not bounce out of the cavity generated by the impact. In LSDYNA a similar size steel cup was also subjected to a freely <b>falling</b> <b>ball</b> with same speed and the energy absorbed was compared to the energy absorbed by the paper cup.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{explored}} adaptation to prism-displaced dynamic and static events {{under conditions of}} minimal information. Many of our interactions with the world are dynamic and involve reaching for or intercepting moving objects. The consequences (or feedback) of those interactions entail {{the presence or absence}} of physical contact with the moving objects. In this study, humans learned, with only haptic feedback, to intercept optically displaced <b>falling</b> <b>balls.</b> To eliminate visual feedback, the <b>falling</b> <b>balls</b> disappeared behind an occluder (which systematically varied in size across groups) prior to either striking or missing a subject’s hand. As occluder size decreased, adaptation increased. With minimum occluder sizes, the greatest adaptation occurred around the training position, and adaptation decreased as distance between training and testing positions increased. The results can best be described in terms of a generalization gradient centered around the training position. This generalization gradient was not present when subjects were trained with ecologically similar static arrays. Implications for models of adaptation are discussed...|$|R

The molecular structures of Paratherm NF heat tmnsfer fluid and other oganic liquid (e. g, mineral oil and F-T wax) are complex.

40|$|The {{ergodicity}} hypothesis for {{the system}} of three (or more) <b>falling</b> <b>balls,</b> with upward decreasing masses, is known for almost three decades. For three <b>falling</b> <b>balls,</b> the model has non-zero Lyapunov exponents for every point in phase space. The usual approach for proving ergodicity for such systems is to verify the five conditions of the local ergodic theorem and then use a transitivity argument to obtain the existence of only one ergodic component. In this paper, we will prove {{two of the five}} conditions, namely, the Chernov-Sinai ansatz and the non-contraction property. For the first it is sufficient to show, that every orbit is strictly unbounded. By strict unboundedness we refer to a term originating from the Liverani-Wojtkowski version of the local ergodic theorem, which requires the rate of expansion, with respect to a suitable quadratic form, for every vector in the contracting cone field to go to infinity. The validity of the non-contraction property is a byproduct from the proof of the strict unboundedness. Comment: 55 pages, 36 figure...|$|R
