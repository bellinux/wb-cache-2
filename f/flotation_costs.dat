40|$|This paper {{extends the}} {{literature}} on the determinants of debt maturity and debt type choice by specifying and estimating a model that incorporates the interrelationship between maturity and debt type decisions. The potential interrelationship stems from agency <b>cost</b> and <b>flotation</b> <b>cost</b> hypotheses. In the agency cost framework, issuing private debt and shortening debt maturity are substitutes for resolving agency conflicts, whereas under the <b>flotation</b> <b>cost</b> hypothesis, increasing the size of public debt issues and lengthening debt maturity are alternative mechanisms for mitigating the large fixed transaction costs associated with public issues. Using a sample of incremental financing decisions made by Australian firms in international bond and syndicated loan markets, the results suggest a uni-directional relationship rather than a two-way relationship, with maturity preferences having a strong influence on the choice of public versus private debt, but little evidence of the choice of debt type affecting maturity. The other determinants of debt type provide support for the renegotiation and liquidation hypothesis, reputation and hold-up costs hypotheses. For debt maturity choice, relatively high and low liquidity risk firms prefer short term debt while intermediate risk firms and firms with high marginal tax rates borrow at longer maturities.

We expect SOX to increase the direct cost of going public, but decrease the underpricing because of reduced asymmetric information. Our main results corroborate these hypotheses. First, we find an increase in the cost of going public of 90 bp of gross proceeds. Second, we record a reduction in underpricing of 6 pp, which is related to a reduced offer price adjustment.

This paper examines the impact of SOX {{on the cost of}} going public. First, we find a statistically significant increase in non-underwriting expenses of 0. 8 percentage points. This is almost entirely due to an increase in accounting and legal fees. Moreover, as this cost item turned out to have a fixed-cost character, smaller issues are much more heavily affected than larger ones. Second, we find corroborating evidence for the hypothesis that SOX should cause a decrease in indirect <b>flotation</b> <b>costs</b> because of its mitigating impact on adverse selection costs of equity financing. Actually we find total direct and indirect <b>flotation</b> <b>costs</b> to decrease by about 3 percentage points in the aftermath of SOX. This result is stable even after controlling for selection bias via a Heckman two-step estimation procedure. Although the reduction of adverse selection costs turns out to be independent of issue size, the positive impact of SOX on total <b>flotation</b> <b>costs</b> decreases with offering size due to higher fixed costs associated with the offering. 3 1...|$|E

40|$|Raw coal is {{typically}} subjected to beneficiation processes to remove mineral matter before being sold to market. The coal industry wants to improve combustible recovery, reduce beneficiation unit costs, and attain efficiency optimization, especially for fines and ultrafines. A key beneficiation method for fine and ultrafine coals is froth flotation, where frothing reagent {{is used to}} generate and stabilize air bubbles that capture and carry hydrophobic particles. Use of frothing reagent constitutes {{the main part of}} the <b>flotation</b> operation <b>cost.</b> A widely used frothing reagent is an aliphatic alcohol, methyl isobutyl carbinol (MIBC), but it has safety concern owing to its low flash point (approximately 40 degreesC). There is a pressing need for seeking a safer and cheaper frother. In the present work, we studied a cyclic alcohol, methyl cyclohexamethanol (MCHM) with a high flash point and compared its flotation performance with that of MIBC. The flotation tests were carried out using simulated process water. The results showed that MCHM was a more effective coal flotation frother than MIBC. Comparative studies of froth, foam, and thin foam film stabilities with these two frothers were undertaken to understand the observed difference in coal flotation performance. The results showed that MCHM generated more stable froth than MIBC. However, at a given concentration, both frothers gave almost equal foam stability and foam film stability. The results suggest the importance of understanding particle-surfactant interactions for controlling froth stability, which significantly affects the kinetic viability of the flotation process and its separation efficiency...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} few years the {{potential}} value of Northern Saskatchewan's low grade uraninite ores has increased greatly. In April of 1950 the value of acceptable uranium concentrates was raised from $ 2. 75 per pound of U 3 O 8 to a maximum of $ 6. 00 per pound of U 3 O 8 (1). With the present emphasis on the development of nuclear energy as a source of commercial power, the value of these ores may be expected to increase still further. In the present work an attempt has been made to apply froth flotations as a means of beneficiating one of these low grade ores. From a consideration of the literature, it appears that at the present time, leaching is the most effective method of extracting uranium from its ores. However, leaching methods would probably become uneconomical if the grade of the ore were much below 0. 10 % U 3 O 8. Since the discovery of major deposits of uranium ores in Northern Saskatchewan attempts have been made at the University of Saskatchewan to beneficiate low grade uraninite ores by notation (1, 2, 3, 4). These attempts met with little success except under conditions where the cost would probably be prohibitive. Flotation is today the most popular method for beneficiating ores. The cost of notation of sulfide ores based on 1940 prices ranges from 6. 5 cents to 75 cents per ton of ore treated (5, p. 12,- 101). The popularity of notation {{is due in part to}} its low cost relative to many ore dressing procedures. However, in plants where tabling is used as a step prior to <b>flotation,</b> tabling <b>costs</b> seem to range from one third to one-half of the flotation cost(5). While successful tabling is dependent on a large difference in the densities of the minerals fed, separation by flotation is independent of density (6). In conducting the flotation research at the University of Saskatchewan, flotation has been regarded as a preliminary step to leaching. The emphasis has been on the achievement of high recoveries at the expense of concentrate grade. Much of the previous work at this university consisted of attempts to find a suitable collector for the uraninite in these ores. In the present work considerable attention has been directed towards the method of carrying out the flotation tests as well as to the search for a suitable collector. Several reagents have been found which seem to exhibit some degree of selectivity towards uraninite in the flotation process. In the present work the effect of variables such as pH, as well as the effect of the type of reagent used, have been investigated. As in the previous work, this investigation has been carried out with a view to obtaining high recoveries of uraninite in the concentrate. High concentrate grades have been of secondary interest.

40|$|Underwriting is a {{key factor}} in equity offerings and many {{scholars}} have sought to shed light on the role that underwriters play in the investment banking industry. My thesis extends existing studies by investigating how underwriters affect the <b>flotation</b> <b>costs</b> of SEOs and the likelihood of investor participation in equity offerings. With the repeal of the US Glass-Steagall Act in 1999, the barrier between commercial banking and investment banking was broken down and commercial banks could also participate in securities underwriting. Given that <b>flotation</b> <b>costs</b> reflect the market perception of a share issue, it is crucial to understand the perceptions that commercial bank co-managers convey to the market. However, most previous studies did not consider that the effects of commercial bank underwriters on SEO <b>flotation</b> <b>costs</b> may vary in the different situation. The first empirical chapter of my thesis will fill this gap. The empirical results support my hypothesis that the market perception of SEOs underwritten by a commercial bank varies in different circumstances. Commercial bank co-managers can increase SEO <b>flotation</b> <b>costs</b> if their behaviour and motivation convey the impression of opportunism to the market. It is widely accepted that investment banking is a relationship-based rather than transaction-based business. Nevertheless, due to technical difficulties, few studies have investigated how the underwriter-investor relationship affects investor participation. Therefore, the research reported in my second empirical chapter (Chapter 5) will fill the gap. The results suggest that: firstly, underwriter–investor networks increase the likelihood of investor participation and such influence is separate from the market function of underwriters; secondly, the underwriter–investor networks are effective not only in pure IPOs and pure SEOs but also interactively; and finally, the relationships built by lead managers are effective, as are those built by co-managers...|$|E

Our main hypothesis is that poor accounting information quality raises uncertainty about a firm's financial condition for outside investors, though not necessarily for insiders. This accounting effect lowers demand for a firm's new equity, thereby raising underwriting costs and risk. Using a large sample of seasoned equity offerings (SEOs), we show that poor accounting information quality is associated with higher <b>flotation</b> <b>costs</b> in terms of larger underwriting fees, larger negative SEO announcement effects, and a higher probability of SEO withdrawals.

The team uniquely combines mineral processing, chemical engineering, and geochemical expertise. This project meets more than 11 goals of the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE), the National Energy Strategy, and the 1993 Climate Change Action Plan. During this project: (1) Equations were developed to predict the concentration of trace elements in as-mined and cleaned coals. These equations, which address both conventional and advanced cleaning processes, {{can be used to}} increase the removal of hazardous air pollutant precursors (HAPs) by existing cleaning plants and to improve the design of new cleaning plants. (2) A promising chemical method of removing mercury and other HAPs was developed. At bench-scale, mercury reductions of over 50 percent were achieved on coal that had already been cleaned by froth <b>flotation.</b> The processing <b>cost</b> of this technology is projected to be less than $ 3. 00 per ton ($ 3. 30 per tonne). (3) Projections were made of the average trace element concentration in cleaning plant solid waste streams from individual states. Average concentrations were found to be highly variable. (4) A significantly improved understanding of how trace elements occur in coal was gained, primarily through work at the USGS during the first systematic development of semiquantitative data for mode of occurrence. In addition, significant improvement was made in the laboratory protocol for mode of occurrence determination. (5) Team members developed a high-quality trace element washability database. For example, the poorest mass balance closure for the uncrushed size and washability data for mercury on all four coals is 8. 44 percent and the best is 0. 46 percent. This indicates an extremely high level of reproducibility of the data. In addition, a series of ''round-robin'' tests involving various laboratories was performed to assure analytical accuracy. (6) A comparison of the cost of lowering mercury emissions through the use of coal cleaning technologies versus the use of post-combustion control methods such as activated carbon injection indicates that, in many cases, coal cleaning may prove to be the lower-cost option. The most significant disadvantage for using coal cleaning for control of mercury emissions is that a reduction of 90 percent or greater from as-fired coal has not yet been demonstrated, even at laboratory-scale...|$|R

We test if <b>flotation</b> <b>costs,</b> asymmetries of information, and renegotiation and liquidation costs influence the choice of debt in line with former studies {{in the context of}} regulatory interference in the bond market. We check the role of central state ownership on debt choice in order to assess to what extent corporate debt choices are politically or economically driven. We test these hypotheses on a dataset of 220 listed Chinese firms over the period 2006 – 2010. We find evidence in favour of the influence of central government ownership on the financing choices of firms it owns, as central state-owned firms are more likely to issue bonds. We also observe limited support for the premise that this influence is stronger for central state-owned firms located closer to the capital. Furthermore, we identify that these companies tend to borrow uniquely on the bond market rather than tapping both debt markets. We provide evidence in favour of the <b>flotation</b> <b>costs</b> hypothesis, but provide mixed evidence for the information asymmetry hypothesis and rather reject the renegotiation and liquidation hypothesis.

First, we document a statistically significant increase in non-underwriting expenses of 0. 8 percentage points after the introduction of SOX, which is mostly due {{to an increase in}} accounting and legal fees. Because of the fixed-cost character of this component cost, smaller issues show a much greater percentage increase than larger ones.

This leads to reduced efforts in minimizing information asymmetry between the issuer, underwriter and investors. My results show that financial issuers have a higher tendency to accelerate the SEO process after controlling for other firm-level offering characteristics.

Using a sample of financial and non-financial SEOs, I test the equity offering agency model by examining issuers’ decision to accelerate and the accompanying floatation costs. My tests show that only financial issuers can save costs in accelerated SEOs, while non-financial issuers incur higher <b>flotation</b> <b>costs</b> when shortening the bookbuilding process.

40|$|This article {{presents}} a theoretical model {{based on the}} Myers-Majluf framework that attempts to explain the choice of public companies among alternative methods for issuing seasoned equity primarily in terms of differences in "information-asymmetry" and "adverse selection" costs. The key insight is that a "pure" (or uninsured) rights offering {{is likely to be}} the lowest-cost flotation method only in cases where a large fraction of current shareholders are expected to subscribe to the offering (i. e., only when expected shareholder takeup is high). In such cases, direct <b>flotation</b> <b>costs</b> are much lower than those associated with book-built underwritten offerings to (mainly) new investors. Even more important, because heavily subscribed rights offerings also involve minimal potential for transfer of wealth between existing and new shareholders (since they are mostly the same people), adverse selection costs are not a concern. But as the expected shareholder takeup falls-say, because increases in corporate size cause risk-averse, wealth-constrained shareholders to diversify their investments-the potential for costly wealth transfers from issuing mis-priced equity leads companies to consider underwriter certification of the new issue. This is evidenced in the data by a systematic move from pure rights offerings first towards rights with standby underwriting as shareholder takeup falls and-for sufficiently low shareholder takeup-to fully marketed firm commitment offerings.

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] This dissertation examines the determinants of the corporate debt choice between different forms of debt financing and different countries. By examining the most extensive sample of U. S. debt issues to date, Essay 1 shows that firms that issue 144 A debt are significantly different from firms that privately place non-bank debt without using the 144 A rule. I also find that traditional private placements rather than bank loans are the favorite debt source for firms with good credit quality that cannot access the public market because of <b>flotation</b> <b>costs</b> and information asymmetry. Essay 2 examines how governance provisions that affect the cost of debt are related to the corporate debt choice. I find that firms with fewer takeover defenses and larger blockholder ownership are more likely to issue private debt. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that private debt claimants can reduce the expected negative impact of takeovers on debtholder value by enforcing stricter covenants or by renegotiating debt in case of takeover. Essay 3 examines the external debt financing choices of multinational firms by using a unique international dataset of firm-level debt offerings. I show that tax-based incentives, country-specific investor preferences, and difference in legal regimes across countries influence multinational firms in their debt location choice...|$|E

Typically, new primary equity is publicly sourced via an initial public offer (IPO). In Australia, however, a direct placement to private and institutional shareholders may also be undertaken prior to flotation. This dissertation begins with a review of the Australian institutional issuance environment. The empirical analysis uses a sample of 1, 351 Australian primary equity raisings that listed between January 1983 and June 1995. In aggregate, these equity raisings totalled A$ 30 B (in 1997 constant dollars), having an average issue size of A$ 24. 4 M and average <b>flotation</b> <b>costs</b> of 7. 88 %. Two formation decisions, relating to the demand for underwriter services and choice of distribution method, are investigated. In each study, a theoretical model is developed and tested using logit regression analysis. In the context of the demand for underwriting services, transaction costs, information asymmetry, risk transfer/avoidance and self-marketing hypotheses from the financial intermediation literature are examined. Empirical results support the transaction costs, liquidity and risk transfer/avoidance hypotheses, but not the information asymmetry explanations. The choice of primary equity distribution method is analogous to the public versus private funding choice reported in the debt market literature, in which the source of funding is related to transaction costs and information asymmetry hypotheses. This framework is augmented by marketing risk and channel structure considerations, and by corporate governance based research in the IPO literature that suggest the maintenance of private control rights and preferences for a particular initial ownership structure, motivate distribution choice. Support for transaction costs and marketing risk explanations is identified in a reduced form model. Moreover, corporate governance considerations are found to be important for small equity raisings...|$|E
