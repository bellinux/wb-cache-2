40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{assessment}} of potential damage on coastlines due to tsunami requires prediction of the likely <b>flow</b> <b>depths</b> and impact forces on structures. Since tsunami {{have a long}} wavelength relative to the water depth, models that solve the non-linear shallow water equations (NLSWE) are appropriate. Carrier et al (2003) presented solutions for tsunami that do not break. However, where the leading front of the tsunami breaks, the wave front is more similar to a bore approaching the shoreline. An analytical treatment for the run-up driven by an incident bore was developed by Shen & Meyer (1963). However, the Shen & Meyer result is only unique close to the shoreline, and the <b>flow</b> <b>depths</b> and velocities depend on the seaward boundary condition. Here, a new numerical model is presented that solves the NLSWE for {{the case of a}} broken tsunami front arriving at the shoreline. It is a simple model that allows specification of either the <b>flow</b> <b>depths</b> or velocities at the seaward boundary, and the solution method allows the effects of friction to be incorporated. The model is able to reproduce the Shen & Meyer analytical solution for the initial motion of the shoreline. The potential damage to coastal structures and other infrastructure may be assessed by calculation of impact and drag forces due to the predicted <b>flow</b> <b>depths</b> and velocities...|$|R

ANFIS uses neural network algorithms and fuzzy reasoning to map an input space to an output space. In the present study, ANFIS models are used to forecast common downstream flow rates and <b>flow</b> <b>depths</b> in a river system having multiple inflows. Three different ANFIS model forms: (i) depth-depth (H-H) model, (ii) depth-discharge (H-Q) model and (iii) discharge-discharge (Q-Q) models are considered in this study. The models are used for forecasting one-hour ahead common downstream flow rates and <b>flow</b> <b>depths</b> in a river system based on past upstream flows. The <b>flow</b> and <b>flow</b> <b>depths</b> data are divided arbitrarily into different categories (2, 3, 4, 6) and different number of membership functions (Triangular, Gaussian, Trapezoidal and Bell) selecting two categories with Gaussian input and constant output membership functions based on trial and error.

40|$|Vegetation roughness, {{and more}} {{specifically}} forest roughness, is a necessary component in better defining flood dynamics both {{in the sense of}} changes in river catchment characteristics and the dynamics of forest changes and management. Extracting roughness parameters from riparian forests can be a complicated process involving different components for different required scales and <b>flow</b> <b>depths.</b> For <b>flow</b> <b>depths</b> that enter a forest canopy, roughness at both the woody branch and foliage level is necessary. This study attempts to extract roughness for this leafy component using a relatively new remote sensing technique in the form of terrestrial laser scanning. Terrestrial laser scanning is used in this study due to its ability to obtain millions of points within relatively small forest stands. This form of lidar can be used to determine the gaps present in foliaged canopies {{in order to determine the}} leaf area index.
