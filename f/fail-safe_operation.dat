40|$|Recent {{experimental}} {{studies have demonstrated}} that sinoatrial node cells (SANC) generate spontaneous, rhythmic, local subsarcolemmal Ca 2 + releases (Ca 2 + clock), which occur during late diastolic depolarization (DD) and interact with the classic sarcolemmal voltage oscillator (membrane clock) by activating Na+-Ca 2 + exchanger current (INCX). This and other interactions between clocks, however, are not captured by existing essentially membrane-delimited cardiac pacemaker cell numerical models. Using wide-scale parametric analysis of classic formulations of membrane clock and Ca 2 + cycling, we have constructed and initially explored a prototype rabbit SANC model featuring both clocks. Our coupled oscillator system exhibits greater robustness and flexibility than membrane clock operating alone. Rhythmic spontaneous Ca 2 + releases of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) -based Ca 2 + clock ignite rhythmic action potentials via late DD INCX over much broader ranges of membrane clock parameters [e. g., L-type Ca 2 + current (ICaL) and/or hyperpolarization-activated (“funny”) current (If) conductances]. The system Ca 2 + clock includes SR and sarcolemmal Ca 2 + fluxes, which optimize cell Ca 2 + balance to increase amplitudes of both SR Ca 2 + release and late DD INCX as SR Ca 2 + pumping rate increases, resulting in a broad pacemaker rate modulation (1. 8 – 4. 6 Hz). In contrast, the rate modulation range via membrane clock parameters is substantially smaller when Ca 2 + clock is unchanged or lacking. When Ca 2 + clock is disabled, the system parametric space for <b>fail-safe</b> SANC <b>operation</b> considerably shrinks: without rhythmic late DD INCX ignition signals membrane clock substantially slows, becomes dysrhythmic, or halts. In conclusion, the Ca 2 + clock is a new critical dimension in SANC function.

40|$|Abstract:- Substation Automation Systems (SAS) {{are widely}} used {{for the purpose of}} control, protection, monitoring, {{communication}} etc. in substations to improve the reliability of the power supply. SASs adopting IT based solutions such as Ethernet LAN have recently become more common although hardwired control has been used in the past in earlier versions of SAS utilising simple communication methods. Moreover, IEC 61850 which is the international standard for communications within substations has been published, and the application of SAS based on IEC 61850 is increasing. It is necessary to select each component and the configuration of the SAS from the viewpoint of dependability so that the dependability of the SAS, i. e. reliability, availability, and serviceability may have a very big impact in the stability of the power supply in the electric power transmission and distribution systems. In this paper, we will describe the configuration policy of an IEC 61850 based SAS, its actual system configuration and the redundant configuration to improve dependability. In addition, we will explain some of the new functions not currently covered by IEC 61850 that we have developed to improve usability and availability. Following which we will present an evaluation of the dependability for MTTF (Mean Time To Failure), Availability, and FMEA (Failure Mode and Effects Analysis) for these configurations of SAS based on the dependability requirements for SAS.

40|$|Intracellular Local Ca {{releases}} (LCRs) from sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) regulate {{cardiac pacemaker}} cell function by activation of electrogenic Na/Ca exchanger (NCX) during diastole. Prior studies demonstrated {{the existence of}} powerful compensatory mechanisms of LCR regulation via a complex local cross-talk of Ca pump, release and NCX. One major obstacle to study these mechanisms is that LCR exhibit complex Ca release propagation patterns (including merges and separations) {{that have not been}} characterized. Here we developed new terminology, classification, and computer algorithms for automatic detection of numerically simulated LCRs and examined LCR regulation by SR Ca pumping rate (Pup) that provides a major contribution to fight-or-flight response. In our simulations the faster SR Ca pumping accelerates action potential-induced Ca transient decay and quickly clears Ca under the cell membrane in diastole, preventing premature releases. Then the SR generates an earlier, more synchronized, and stronger diastolic LCR signal activating an earlier and larger inward NCX current. LCRs at higher Pup exhibit larger amplitudes and faster propagation with more collisions to each other. The LCRs overlap with Ca transient decay, causing an elevation of the average diastolic [Ca] nadir to ~ 200 nM (at Pup = 24 mM/s). Background Ca (in locations lacking LCRs) quickly decays to resting Ca levels (< 100 nM) at high Pup, but remained elevated during slower decay at low Pup. Release propagation is facilitated at higher Pup by a larger LCR amplitude, whereas at low Pup by higher background Ca. While at low Pup LCRs show smaller amplitudes, their larger durations and sizes combined with longer transient decay stabilize integrals of diastolic Ca and NCX current signals. Thus, the local interplay of SR Ca pump and release channels regulates LCRs and Ca transient decay to insure <b>fail-safe</b> pacemaker cell <b>operation</b> within a wide range of rates...|$|R
