5|$|Demosthenes {{relied heavily}} on the {{difference}} aspects of ethos, especially phronesis. When presenting himself to the Assembly, he had to depict himself as a credible and wise statesman and adviser {{in order to be}} persuasive. One tactic that Demosthenes used during his philippics was foresight. He pleaded with <b>his</b> <b>audience</b> to predict the potential of being defeated, and to prepare. He appealed to pathos through patriotism and introducing the atrocities that would befall Athens if it was taken over by Philip. He was a master at “self-fashioning” by referring to his previous accomplishments, and renewing his credibility. He would also slyly undermine <b>his</b> <b>audience</b> by claiming that they had been wrong to not listen before, however they could redeem themselves if they listened and acted with him presently.|$|E
5|$|The {{experience}} reinforced Drake's {{decision to}} retreat from live appearances; the few concerts he did play around this time were usually brief, awkward, and poorly attended. Drake seemed reluctant to perform and rarely addressed <b>his</b> <b>audience.</b> As many of his songs were played in different tunings, he frequently paused to retune between numbers.|$|E
5|$|The {{subject matter}} of the third letter {{is similar to that of}} the second letter, and some {{scholars}} have explained this as a result of Swift being forced to respond so quickly to the Privy-council's report. The Drapier emphasises his humble nature and simple understanding when appealing to the pride of <b>his</b> <b>audience,</b> the nobility.|$|E

5|$|Accum {{held his}} first lecture on {{chemistry}} and mineralogy {{in a small}} room in his house on Old Compton Street. <b>His</b> <b>audience</b> grew so rapidly that he soon had to rent the Medical Theatre on Cork Street. After resigning from the Royal Institution and taking a new position with the Surrey Institution, he continued with his popular lectures. An advertisement in The Times on January 6, 1809 indicates that Accum offered a course on mineralogy and the chemical analysis of metals every Wednesday evening.|$|E
5|$|After US President Richard Nixon {{made his}} famous 1972 visit to China, {{a wave of}} exchanges took place between the two countries. One of these was a {{delegation}} of the American Institute of Architects in 1974, which Pei joined. It was his first trip back to China since leaving in 1935. He was favorably received, returned the welcome with positive comments, {{and a series of}} lectures ensued. Pei noted in one lecture that since the 1950s Chinese architects had been content to imitate Western styles; he urged <b>his</b> <b>audience</b> in one lecture to search China's native traditions for inspiration.|$|E
5|$|Because the feats the Baron {{describes}} are overtly implausible, {{they are}} easily recognizable as fiction, {{with a strong}} implication that the Baron is a liar. Whether he expects <b>his</b> <b>audience</b> to believe him varies from version to version; in Raspe's original 1785 text, he simply narrates his stories without further comment, but in the later extended versions he is insistent that he is telling the truth. In any case, the Baron appears to believe every word of his own stories, no matter how internally inconsistent they become, and he usually appears tolerantly indifferent to any disbelief he encounters in others.|$|E

5|$|During {{the latter}} part of 1970, Townshend plotted a follow up Tommy: Lifehouse, which was to be a {{multi-media}} project symbolising the relationship between an artist and <b>his</b> <b>audience.</b> He developed ideas in his home studio, creating layers of synthesizers, and the Young Vic theatre in London was booked for a series of experimental concerts. Townshend approached the gigs with optimism; the rest of the band were just happy to be gigging again. Eventually, the others complained to Townshend that the project was too complicated and they should simply record another album. Things deteriorated until Townshend had a nervous breakdown and abandoned Lifehouse.|$|E
5|$|Like Hitler, Goebbels practiced {{his public}} {{speaking}} skills {{in front of}} a mirror. Meetings were preceded by ceremonial marches and singing, and the venues were decorated with party banners. His entrance (almost always late) was timed for maximum emotional impact. He usually meticulously planned his speeches ahead of time, using pre-planned and choreographed inflection and gestures, but he was also able to improvise and adapt his presentation to make a good connection with <b>his</b> <b>audience.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ochs went on tour {{wearing the}} gold suit, {{backed by a}} rock band, singing his own {{material}} along with medleys of songs by Buddy Holly, Elvis, and Merle Haggard.

This concerned Dyke, who on the weekend before the vote arranged an urgent meeting with East. They both telephoned the ITV companies to convince them to raise their collective bid. It came {{to a total of}} £262 million – £155 million of which spread out over five years, for 30 live games per season. East presented their new offer to the chairmen and Parry.|$|E

5|$|Hanna M. Roisman compares Kint to Odysseus, {{capable of}} {{adapting}} both his personality and his tales {{to his current}} audience. Throughout his tale, Kint adapts his confession to Kujan's revealed biases. Roisman draws direct parallels to Odysseus' tales to the Phaeacians: like Odysseus, Kint allows <b>his</b> <b>audience</b> to define him and his narrative. Appealing to Kujan's arrogance, Kint allows himself to be outwitted, humiliated, and broken by his interrogator; Kint further invents a mythical villain that he credulously believes in and gives Kujan the privileged perspective of the skeptic. Kint thus creates a neo-noir thriller inside of a neo-noir thriller and demonstrates the artificiality of storytelling. Benjamin Widiss identifies post-structural elements to the film, such as {{the lack of a}} clear protagonist throughout much of the film. This extends to ambiguity over Kint's role as author or reader, and whether he is Kint pretending to be Söze or the reverse.|$|E
5|$|In 1885, Sitting Bull {{was allowed}} to leave the {{reservation}} to go Wild Westing with Buffalo Bill Cody’s Buffalo Bill's Wild West. He earned about $50 a week for riding once around the arena, {{where he was a}} popular attraction. Although it is rumored that he cursed his audiences in his native tongue during the show, the historian Utley contends that he did not. Historians have reported that Sitting Bull gave speeches about his desire for education for the young, and reconciling relations between the Sioux and whites. The historian Edward Lazarus wrote that Sitting Bull reportedly cursed <b>his</b> <b>audience</b> in Lakota in 1884, during an opening address celebrating the completion of the Northern Pacific Railway.|$|E
5|$|Narayan's {{greatest}} {{achievement was}} making India {{accessible to the}} outside world through his literature. He is {{regarded as one of the}} three leading English language Indian fiction writers, along with Raja Rao and Mulk Raj Anand. He gave his readers something to look forward to with Malgudi and its residents and is considered to be one of the best novelists India has ever produced. He brought small-town India to <b>his</b> <b>audience</b> in a manner that was both believable and experiential. Malgudi was not just a fictional town in India, but one teeming with characters, each with their own idiosyncrasies and attitudes, making the situation as familiar to the reader as if it were their own backyard. In 2014, Google commemorated Narayan's 108th birthday by featuring a doodle showing him behind a copy of Malgudi Days.|$|E

5|$|Regarding A Song of Ice and Fire as his magnum opus, Martin {{is certain}} never to write {{anything}} {{on this scale}} again and would only return to this fictional universe {{in the context of}} stand-alone novels. He prefers to write stories about characters from other Ice and Fire periods of history such as his Tales of Dunk and Egg project, instead of continuing the series directly. A possible future side project is a prequel set during Aegon's conquest of Westeros. Martin said he would love to return to writing short stories, novellas, novelettes, and stand-alone novels from diverse genres such as science fiction, horror, fantasy, or even a murder mystery. However, he will see if <b>his</b> <b>audience</b> follows him after publishing his next project.|$|E
5|$|Tin Machine's {{first world}} tour was a {{commercial}} success, {{but there was}} growing reluctance—among fans and critics alike—to accept Bowie's presentation as merely a band member. A series of Tin Machine singles failed to chart, and Bowie, after a disagreement with EMI, left the label. Like <b>his</b> <b>audience</b> and his critics, Bowie himself became increasingly disaffected with his role as just one member of a band. Tin Machine began work on a second album, but Bowie put the venture on hold and made a return to solo work. Performing his early hits during the seven-month Sound+Vision Tour, he found commercial success and acclaim once again.|$|E
5|$|Although Scotland {{increasingly}} {{adopted the}} English language and wider cultural norms, its literature developed a distinct {{national identity and}} began to enjoy an international reputation. Allan Ramsay (1686–1758) laid the foundations of a reawakening of interest in older Scottish literature, as well as leading the trend for pastoral poetry, helping to develop the Habbie stanza as a poetic form. James Macpherson was the first Scottish poet to gain an international reputation, claiming to have found poetry written by Ossian, he published translations that acquired international popularity, being proclaimed as a Celtic equivalent of the Classical epics. Fingal written in 1762 was speedily translated into many European languages, and its deep appreciation of natural beauty and the melancholy tenderness of its treatment of the ancient legend did more than any single work {{to bring about the}} Romantic movement in European, and especially in German, literature, influencing Herder and Goethe. Eventually {{it became clear that the}} poems were not direct translations from the Gaelic, but flowery adaptations made to suit the aesthetic expectations of <b>his</b> <b>audience.</b>|$|E
