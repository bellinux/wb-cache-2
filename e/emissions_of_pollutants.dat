I can't prove that, but I believe based on what I read {{that the world is}} getting warmer. And number two, I believe that humans contribute to that. I don't know how much our contribution is to that, because I know that there have been periods of greater heat and warmth in the past but I believe we contribute to that. And so I think it's important for us to reduce our <b>emissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollutants</b> and greenhouse gases that may well be significant contributors to the climate change and the global warming that you're seeing." [...] Four months later, in October 2011, he said, [...] "My view is that we don't know what's causing climate change on this planet. And the idea of spending trillions and trillions of dollars to try to reduce CO2 emissions is not the right course for us." [...] He expressed his opposition to cap and trade plans and to regulation of carbon emissions. In June 2012, Romney's domestic policy advisor Oren Cass told the Los Angeles Times, [...] "He's a supporter of renewable energy, as long as it's anything that would be economically competitive.

50|$|Emissions trading or cap {{and trade}} is a government-mandated, market-based {{approach}} to controlling pollution by providing economic incentives for achieving reductions in the <b>emissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollutants.</b> In contrast to command-and-control environmental regulations such as best available technology (BAT) standards and government subsidies, {{cap and trade}} (CAT) schemes are a type of flexible environmental regulation that allows organizations to decide how best to meet policy targets.

50|$|Co-firing is the {{combustion}} {{of two different}} types of materials at the same time. One of the advantages of co-firing is that an existing plant can be used to burn a new fuel, which may be cheaper or more environmentally friendly. For example, biomass is sometimes co-fired in existing coal plants instead of new biomass plants. Co-firing {{can also be used to}} improve {{the combustion}} of fuels with low energy content. For example, landfill gas contains a large amount of carbon dioxide, which is non-combustible. If the landfill gas is burned without removing the carbon dioxide, the equipment may not perform properly or <b>emissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollutants</b> may increase. Co-firing it with natural gas increases the heat content of the fuel and improves combustion and equipment performance. As long as the electricity or heat produced with the biomass and landfill gas was otherwise going to be produced with non-renewable fuels, the benefits are essentially equivalent whether they are cofired or combusted alone. Also, co-firing can be used to lower the emission of some pollutants. For example, co-firing biomass with coal results in less sulfur emissions than burning coal by itself.|$|E
