50|$|The <b>germanies</b> {{began to}} take power in Valencia in 1519 after an {{outbreak}} of the plague, and the situation degenerated to open warfare between the <b>Germanies</b> and the Crown by 1520. The previous king, Ferdinand of Aragon, had granted permission for the <b>Germanies</b> {{to take up arms}} shortly before his death, but the Valencian nobles had mostly quashed this possibility, fearing the <b>Germanies</b> would gain political power if they could back their demands with force. King Charles I, however, issued an edict legalizing the <b>Germanies</b> to take up arms in 1519, which allowed the <b>Germanies</b> to strike back at the royal government after the new Viceroy of Valencia refused to seat elected representatives friendly to the <b>Germanies.</b>|$|R

5|$|Adolf Hitler's rise {{to power}} in <b>Germany</b> and his regime's anti-Semitic {{policies}} significantly affected American pre-Code filmmaking. Although Hitler had become unpopular {{in many parts of}} the United States, <b>Germany</b> was still a voluminous importer of American films and the studios wanted to appease the German government. The ban on Jews and negative portrayals of <b>Germany</b> in the Fatherland even led to a significant reduction in work for Jews in Hollywood until after the end of World War II. As a result, only two social problem films released by independent film companies addressed the mania in <b>Germany</b> during the pre-Code era (Are We Civilized? and Hitler's Reign of Terror).|$|E
5|$|After <b>Germany</b> surrendered, the Allies {{partitioned}} Berlin and Germany's remaining territory {{into four}} military occupation zones.

They were informally known as West <b>Germany</b> and East <b>Germany.</b> East <b>Germany</b> selected East Berlin as its capital, while West <b>Germany</b> chose Bonn as a provisional capital, to emphasize its stance that the two-state solution was an artificial and temporary status quo.|$|E

5|$|Despite the parties' ostensibly cordial relations, {{each side}} was highly {{suspicious}} of the other's intentions. For instance, the Soviet invasion of Bukovina in June 1940 went beyond their sphere of influence as agreed with <b>Germany.</b> After <b>Germany</b> entered the Axis Pact with Japan and Italy, it began negotiations about a potential Soviet entry into the pact. After two days of negotiations in Berlin from 12 to 14 November 1940, <b>Germany</b> presented a written proposal for a Soviet entry into the Axis. On 25 November 1940, the Soviet Union offered a written counter-proposal to join the Axis if <b>Germany</b> would agree to refrain from interference in the Soviet Union's sphere of influence, but <b>Germany</b> did not respond. As both sides began colliding {{with each other in}} Eastern Europe, conflict appeared more likely, although they did sign a border and commercial agreement addressing several open issues in January 1941. Historian Robert Service avows that Soviet leader Joseph Stalin was convinced that the overall military strength of the USSR was such that he had nothing to fear and anticipated an easy victory should <b>Germany</b> attack; moreover, Stalin believed that since the Germans were still fighting the British in the west, Hitler would be unlikely to open up a two front war and subsequently delayed the reconstruction of defensive fortifications in the border regions. When German soldiers swam across the Bug River to warn the Red Army of an impending attack, they were treated like enemy agents and shot. Some historians believe that Stalin, despite providing an amicable front to Hitler, did not wish to remain allies with <b>Germany.</b> Rather, Stalin might have had intentions to break off from <b>Germany</b> and proceed with his own campaign against <b>Germany</b> to be followed by one against the rest of Europe.|$|E
5|$|During 1942, Allied {{officials}} debated on {{the appropriate}} grand strategy to pursue. All agreed that defeating <b>Germany</b> {{was the primary}} objective. The Americans favoured a straightforward, large-scale attack on <b>Germany</b> through France. The Soviets were also demanding a second front. The British, on the other hand, argued that military operations should target peripheral areas to wear out German strength, leading to increasing demoralisation, and bolster resistance forces. <b>Germany</b> itself {{would be subject to}} a heavy bombing campaign. An offensive against <b>Germany</b> would then be launched primarily by Allied armour without using large-scale armies. Eventually, the British persuaded the Americans that a landing in France was infeasible in 1942 and they should instead focus on driving the Axis out of North Africa.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{argues that}} German {{unification}} in October 1990, the Soviet Empire's disintegration in 1991, {{and the end}} of the Cold War had profound implications for the conduct of <b>Germany's</b> foreign and security policy behaviour. Its aim is to compare and contrast German foreign policy towards Czechoslovakia (Czech Republic) and Poland between 1990 and 1998. <b>Germany's</b> foreign policy towards both states was guided by three crucial components; political reconciliation, economic, and security interests. By discussing the interplay between agential and structural sources of <b>Germany's</b> foreign and security policy behaviour, this thesis provides an exhaustive description of how German influence manifested itself in these states, and how it was channelled and constrained. <b>Germany's</b> foreign and security policy behaviour towards both states helps to explain three problems: the manifold implications of <b>Germany's</b> return to the European Mittellage (centre); <b>Germany's</b> ability to manage complex bilateral relationships despite being burdened by history, and the multi-level nature of its foreign and security policy apparatus...|$|R
