40|$|Solution of the {{momentum}} space Schrödinger equation {{in the case}} of deformed fields is being addressed. In particular it is shown that a complete set of single particle states which includes bound, resonant and complex continuum states may be obtained by the Contour Deformation Method. This generalized basis in the complex energy plane is known as a Berggren basis. The momentum space Schrödinger equation <b>is</b> an <b>integral</b> equation which <b>is</b> <b>easily</b> <b>solved</b> by matrix diagonalization routines even for the case of deformed fields. The method is demonstrated for axial symmetry and a fictitious "deformed ^ 5 He", but may be extended to more general deformation and applied to truly deformed halo nuclei.

40|$|This paper derives a {{complete}} analytical {{solution for the}} probability distribution of the configuration of a non-holonomic mobile robot that moves in two spatial dimensions by satisfying the unicycle kinematic constraints. The proposed solution differs from previous solutions since it is obtained by deriving the analytical expression of any-order moment of the probability distribution. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, an analytical expression for any-order moment that holds even in the case of arbitrary linear and angular speed, has never been derived before. To compute these moments, a direct integration of the Langevin equation is carried out and each moment is expressed as a multiple integral of the deterministic motion (i. e., the known motion that would result in absence of noise). For the special case when the ratio between the linear and angular speed is constant, the multiple <b>integrals</b> can <b>be</b> <b>easily</b> <b>solved</b> and expressed as the real or the imaginary part of suitable analytic functions. As an application of the derived analytical results, the paper investigates the diffusivity of the considered Brownian motion for constant and for arbitrary time-dependent linear and angular speed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{provides}} a complete analytical {{solution to the}} Brownianmotion of a self-propelled particle that moves in two spatial dimensions in theoverdamped limit by satisfying kinematic constraints. The analytical expression ofany-order moment of the probability distribution is obtained by a direct integration ofthe Langevin equation. Each moment is expressed as a multiple integral of the activemotion performed by the particle. This allows obtaining any order moment for anyactive motion, i. e., when the particle is propelled by arbitrary time-dependent forceand torque. For the special case when the ratio between the force and the torqueis constant, the multiple <b>integrals</b> can <b>be</b> <b>easily</b> analytically <b>solved</b> and expressed asthe real or the imaginary part of suitable analytic functions.
