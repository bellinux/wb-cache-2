5|$|In adults, {{the initial}} {{treatment}} for paracetamol overdose is gastrointestinal decontamination. Paracetamol absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is complete {{within two hours}} under normal circumstances, so decontamination is most <b>helpful</b> <b>if</b> performed within this timeframe. Gastric lavage, better known as stomach pumping, may be considered if the amount ingested is potentially life-threatening and the procedure can be performed within 60 minutes of ingestion. Activated charcoal {{is the most common}} gastrointestinal decontamination procedure as it adsorbs paracetamol, reducing its gastrointestinal absorption. Administering activated charcoal also poses less risk of aspiration than gastric lavage.|$|E

The British had intelligence reports indicating that {{he had gone to}} Germany, and the British High Commissioner pressured Damad Ferit Pasha and the Sublime Porte to demand from Germany to return him to the Ottoman Empire. As a result of efforts pursued personally by (Sir) Andrew Ryan, a former Dragoman and now a member of the British intelligence service, Germany responded to the Ottoman Empire stating that it was willing to be <b>helpful</b> <b>if</b> official papers could be produced showing these persons had been found guilty, and added that the presence of these persons in Germany could not as yet be ascertained.|$|E
25|$|Numerous Danish folktales {{contain a}} range of mythical figures such as trolls, elves, goblins and wights as well as figures from Nordic mythology like giants and lygtemænd (hobby lanterns). The nisse is a {{particularly}} well known legendary figure in Danish folklore, apparently dating back to pre-Christian times when it was believed there were household gods. Traditionally each farm had its own nisse living on the loft or in a stable. Dressed in grey with a pointed red cap, he was no taller than a 10-year-old boy. The nisse would be <b>helpful</b> <b>if</b> treated well, for instance by offering him a bowl of porridge with a clump of butter at night, but, failing good treatment, he could become quite troublesome and mean.|$|E
500|$|Secretary of State James F. Byrnes, who a {{year earlier}} had told {{physicist}} Leo Szilard that a public demonstration of the bomb might make the Soviet Union [...] "more manageable" [...] in Europe, now argued the opposite: that further display of U.S. nuclear power could harden the Soviet Union's position against acceptance of the Acheson–Lilienthal Plan, which discussed possible methods for the international control {{of nuclear weapons and}} the avoidance of future nuclear warfare. At a March 22 cabinet meeting he said, [...] "from the standpoint of international relations it would be very <b>helpful</b> <b>if</b> the test could be postponed or never held at all." [...] He prevailed on Truman to postpone the first test for six weeks, from May 15 to July 1. For public consumption, the postponement was explained as an opportunity for more Congressional observers to attend during their summer recess.|$|E

500|$|After {{securing}} the Republican nomination in 1980, Ronald Reagan considered his former rival Ford {{as a potential}} vice-presidential runningmate, but negotiations between the Reagan and Ford camps at the Republican National Convention were unsuccessful. Ford conditioned his acceptance on Reagan's agreement to an unprecedented [...] "co-presidency", giving Ford the power to control key executive branch appointments (such as Kissinger as Secretary of State and Alan Greenspan as Treasury Secretary). After rejecting these terms, Reagan offered the vice-presidential nomination instead to George H. W. Bush. Ford did appear in a campaign commercial for the Reagan-Bush ticket, in which he declared that {{the country would be}} [...] "better served by a Reagan presidency rather than a continuation of the weak and politically expedient policies of Jimmy Carter". On October 8, 1980, Ford said President Nixon's involvement in the general election potentially could negatively impact the Reagan campaign: [...] "I {{think it would have been}} much more <b>helpful</b> <b>if</b> Mr. Nixon had stayed in the background during this campaign. It would have been much more beneficial to Ronald Reagan." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{cornerstone}} of successful periodontal treatment starts with establishing excellent oral hygiene. [...] This includes twice-daily brushing with daily flossing.

For smaller spaces, products such as narrow picks with soft rubber bristles provide excellent manual cleaning. [...] Persons with dexterity problems, such as arthritis, may find oral hygiene to be difficult and may require more frequent professional care and/or the use of a powered toothbrush. [...] Persons with periodontitis must realize it is a chronic inflammatory disease and a lifelong regimen of excellent hygiene and professional maintenance care with a dentist/hygienist or periodontist is required to maintain affected teeth.|$|E

2500|$|On April 1, 2011, the Associated Press {{reported}} on Erik Prince's seven-hour testimony about what allegedly transpired. Prince strongly criticized {{the way in}} which federal authorities had handled the investigation and disputed the claims that U.S. or Blackwater personnel were to blame for the shootings. In his testimony, Prince noted that, [...] "It seems the ballistics analysis was done to prove the guilt of the Americans, not to just try to identify what happened there." [...] Erik Prince said that he didn't believe the FBI had fully investigated the sources of all the used bullets in Nisour Square, arguing {{that it would have been}} <b>helpful</b> <b>if</b> the defense had been in possession of a complete ballistics report. FBI scientists couldn't match bullets from the square to guns carried by the Blackwater guards and FBI investigators found foreign cartridge cases of a kind not used by U.S. or Blackwater personnel.

60|$|Three gentlemen came, {{before a}} month was out, to Beatrice's establishment. She hoped shortly {{to get a}} fourth or a fifth. Her plan was to play hostess, and thus bestow on her {{boarders}} the inestimable blessing of family life. Breakfast was at eight-thirty, and everyone attended. Vera sat opposite Beatrice, Frank sat on the maternal right hand; Mr MacWhirter, who was superior, sat on the left hand; next him sat Mr Allport, whose opposite was Mr Holiday. All were young men of less than thirty years. Mr MacWhirter was tall, fair, and stoutish; he was very quietly spoken, was humorous and amiable, yet extraordinarily learned. He never, by any chance, gave himself away, maintaining always an absolute reserve amid all his amiability. Therefore Frank {{would have done anything}} to win his esteem, while Beatrice was deferential to him. Mr Allport was tall and broad, and thin as a door; he had also a remarkably small chin. He was naïve, inclined to suffer in the first pangs of disillusionment; nevertheless, he was waywardly humorous, sometimes wistful, sometimes petulant, always gallant. Therefore Vera liked him, whilst Beatrice mothered him. Mr Holiday was short, very stout, very ruddy, with black hair. He had a disagreeable voice, was vulgar in the grain, but officiously <b>helpful</b> <b>if</b> appeal were made to him. Therefore Frank hated him. Vera liked his handsome, lusty appearance, but resented bitterly his behaviour. Beatrice was proud of the superior and skilful way in which she handled him, clipping him into shape without hurting him.|$|E
