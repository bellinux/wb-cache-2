500|$|Meyerbeer's {{relationship}} with Heine displays the awkwardness and prickliness {{of the social}} personae of both parties. Meyerbeer, apart from any of his personal feelings, needed Heine onside as an influential personality and writer on music. He genuinely admired Heine's verse, and {{made a number of}} settings from it. Heine, living in Paris from 1830, always equivocal about his loyalties between Judaism and Christianity, and always short of money, asked Meyerbeer to intervene with Heine's own family for financial support and frequently took loans and money from Meyerbeer himself. He was not above threatening Meyerbeer with blackmail by writing satirical pieces about him (and indeed Meyerbeer paid Heine's widow to suppress such writings). And yet, at Heine's death in 1856, Meyerbeer wrote in his diary 'Peace be to his ashes. <b>I</b> <b>forgive</b> him from my heart for his ingratitude and many wickednesses against me.' ...|$|E
500|$|By February 1671, John Churchill {{was back}} in London and duelling with Sir John Fenwick. Churchill's {{handsome}} features and manner – described by Lord Chesterfield as [...] "irresistible to either man or woman" [...] – had soon attracted the ravenous attentions {{of one of the}} King's most noteworthy mistresses, Barbara Villiers, Duchess of Cleveland. But his liaisons with the insatiable temptress were indeed dangerous. One account has it that upon the King's appearance Churchill leapt out of his lover's bed and hid in the cupboard, but the King, himself wily in such matters, soon discovered young Churchill, who promptly fell to his knees. [...] "You are a rascal", said Charles, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>forgive</b> you because you do it to get your bread". The story may be apocryphal – another version has Churchill jumping out of the window – but it is widely accepted that he was the father of Cleveland's daughter, Barbara, born on 16 July 1672 (O.S.). However, Churchill never formally acknowledged her.|$|E

500|$|The character's {{accidental}} pregnancy storyline received {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Tim Stack for Entertainment Weekly deemed it [...] "a good dramatic twist", but hoped {{that it would}} not be a long-lasting storyline. Reviews of her storyline became increasingly negative, though Agron was praised for her dramatic acting during the confrontation scene with Quinn's parents in [...] "Ballad". Gerrick D. Kennedy, writing for the Los Angeles Times, was critical of the ongoing pregnancy plot in the episode [...] "Hairography", and noted that he cringed whenever Quinn appeared on screen. Conversely, Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle enjoyed Quinn in the episode, and wrote: [...] "I love that she can keep her Mean Girls edge while being heartbreakingly sad or as joyful as she was singing [...] "Papa Don't Preach". Reviewing the episode [...] "Journey to Regionals", Entertainment Weekly's Darren Franich called Quinn's birthing scenes—interspersed with Vocal Adrenaline performing Queen's [...] "Bohemian Rhapsody"—both [...] "brilliant" [...] and [...] "terrible". He wrote, [...] "If nothing else, it was definitely the most visually arresting way to represent the birthing process I've ever seen outside of The Miracle of Life. But I kind of liked it. Somewhere, Freddie Mercury is nodding proudly, and saying, 'World, <b>I</b> <b>forgive</b> you for We Will Rock You.'" ...|$|E
500|$|At around 9:30 on {{the night}} of September 27, 1868, Hindman was assassinated by one or more unknown assailants who fired through his parlor window while he was reading his {{newspaper}} with his children. The musket shots hit Hindman in the jaw, throat, and hands, and he died eight hours later due to significant blood loss. Before his death, Hindman gave a farewell speech to his neighbors and political supporters from the porch of his house. With [...] "perfect composure", Hindman told listeners to [...] "unite their courage and determination to bring peace to the people". Hindman hinted at the recent political debate with Powell Clayton as a possible motivation for the shooting and said, [...] "I do not know who killed me; but I can say, whoever it was, <b>I</b> <b>forgive</b> him." [...] He asked James H. O'Connor, the husband of Mollie's stepmother, to [...] "take care of my family and be a protector to my wife and dear little ones". After O'Connor accepted, Hindman stated, [...] "I forgive everybody, and hope they will forgive me." [...] Afterwards, he was too weak to continue speaking, and he sat down on a lounge. He remained there until he died early next morning. The assassination was announced in all major newspapers throughout the state. William Woodruff of the Gazette said Hindman died as an [...] "able and distinguished man" [...] whose [...] "short but splendid career" [...] {{had a profound impact on}} Arkansan state politics.|$|E
500|$|To Playford's {{advantage}} {{there was}} usually {{a disproportionate number}} of South Australians in federal cabinets, both Liberal and Labor. This clout, combined with his own intensive and unconventional negotiating tactics, made sure that South Australia regularly received more federal funds {{than it would have been}} allocated otherwise. This was to Robert Menzies' chagrin, who said: [...] "Tom [...] wouldn't know intellectual honesty if he met it on the end of a pitch fork but he does it all for South Australia, not for himself, so <b>I</b> <b>forgive</b> him." [...] By the time of his departure from power, Playford gained the reputation of being [...] "a good South Australian but a very bad Australian", and for using [...] "threats to bully recalcitrant Prime Ministers". For his part, Playford remained unrepentant, claiming that federal authorities had infringed the constitution of Australia and had consistent exercised powers over the states that were not rightfully theirs. Playford accused the High Court of Australia of helping the federal parliament under Curtin to legislate to give itself a monopoly on the acquisition of income tax, which he claimed was contrary to the intention of the constitution to prevent excessive centralisation of power in the federal government. In 1958, he threatened to take the federal government to the High Court, which led to South Australia being given more compensation under the River Murray Waters Agreement for the loss of water from the Snowy River. Three years later he went to the High Court in an attempt to have Canberra pay for the standardisation of the gauge on the Broken Hill-Port Pirie railway.|$|E

500|$|Since its release, Mulholland Drive has, {{according}} to film scholars Jay R. Letzner and Donald R. Ross, [...] "garnered both {{some of the}} harshest epithets {{and some of the}} most lavish praise in recent cinematic history". It received acclaim from many critics; even Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, who had up til that point been primarily dismissive of Lynch's work, awarded the film four stars and commented, [...] "David Lynch has been working toward Mulholland Drive all of his career, and now that he's arrived there <b>I</b> <b>forgive</b> him for Wild at Heart (1990) and even Lost Highway (1997). At last his experiment doesn't shatter the test tubes. The movie is a surrealist dreamscape {{in the form of a}} Hollywood film noir, and the less sense it makes, the more we can't stop watching it." [...] Ebert subsequently added Mulholland Drive to his [...] "Great Films" [...] list in November 2012. In The New York Times, Stephen Holden wrote that the film [...] "ranks alongside Fellini's 8½ and other auteurist fantasias as a monumental self-reflection" [...] and added, [...] "Looked at lightly, it is the grandest and silliest cinematic carnival to come along in quite some time: a lurching journey through one filmmaker's personal fun house. On a more serious level, its investigation into the power of movies pierces a void from which you can hear the screams of a ravenous demon whose appetites can never be slaked." [...] Edward Guthmann of the San Francisco Chronicle called it [...] "exhilarating... for its dreamlike images and fierce, frequently reckless imagination" [...] and added, [...] "there's a mesmerizing quality to its languid pace, its sense of foreboding and its lost-in-time atmosphere... it holds us, spellbound and amused, for all of its loony and luscious, exasperating 146minutes [...] proves that Lynch is in solid form—and still an expert at pricking our nerves." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lutherans {{differ from}} other Protestants as they {{practice}} [...] "confession and absolution" [...] (in two forms). They, like Roman Catholics and many Anglicans, see [...] and [...] as biblical evidence for confession. The first form of confession and absolution is {{done at the}} Divine Service with the assembled congregation (similar to the Anglican tradition). Here, the entire congregation pauses {{for a moment of}} silent confession, recites the confiteor, and receives God's forgiveness through the pastor as he says the following (or similar): [...] "Upon this your confession and in the stead and by the command of my Lord Jesus Christ, <b>I</b> <b>forgive</b> you all your sins {{in the name of the}} Father and of [...] the Son and of the Holy Spirit." ...|$|E

His final statement: [...] "I go forward now on wings built by the love and support of my family and friends. I go with {{a peace of mind}} that comes from never having taken a human life. <b>I</b> <b>forgive</b> those who have hardened their hearts to the truth and I pray they ask forgiveness, for they know not what they do.

2500|$|The second form of {{confession}} and absolution {{is known as}} [...] "Holy Absolution", which is done privately to the pastor (commonly only upon request).

[...] In the Lutheran Church, the pastor is bound by the Seal of the Confessional (similar to the Roman Catholic tradition).
