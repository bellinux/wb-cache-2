5|$|According to Hinduism, {{the souls}} of three {{preceding}} generations of one's ancestor reside in Pitru–loka, a realm between <b>heaven</b> <b>and</b> earth. This realm is governed by Yama, the god of death, who takes {{the soul of a}} dying man from earth to Pitru–loka. When a person of the next generation dies, the first generation shifts to <b>heaven</b> <b>and</b> unites with God, so Shraddha offerings are not given. Thus, only the three generations in Pitru–loka are given Shraddha rites, in which Yama plays a significant role. According to the sacred Hindu epics, at the beginning of Pitru Paksha, the sun enters the zodiac sign of Libra (Tula). Coinciding with this moment, it is believed that the spirits leave Pitru–loka and reside in their descendants' homes for a month until the sun enters the next zodiacScorpio (Vrichchhika)and there is a full moon. Hindus are expected to propitiate the ancestors in the first half, during the dark fortnight.|$|E

5|$|During the Qin dynasty, {{the first}} Qin emperor's {{legitimacy}} to rule was ultimately decided by {{his ability to}} conquer others. However, {{by the time of}} Wang Mang's (r. 9–23 AD) reign, the Mandate of Heaven was considered the only legitimate source of imperial authority. This concept was given greater prominence after the state officially sponsored the worship of Heaven over that of the Five Powers in 31 BC. Moreover, the philosophy of the scholar Dong Zhongshu (179–104 BC), which held that a dynasty's rule on earth was bound to greater cosmological cycles in the universe, was officially sponsored by the Han court from Emperor Wu's (r. 141–87 BC) reign onward. The emperor was expected to behave according to proper ritual, ethics, and morals, lest he incur the wrath of <b>Heaven</b> <b>and</b> bring an end to his reign. He became the highest priest in the land. By performing certain religious rites and rituals, the emperor acted as a sacred link between <b>Heaven</b> <b>and</b> Earth.|$|E

5|$|The Catholic Church teaches that, {{immediately}} after death, {{the soul of}} each person will receive a particular judgement from God, based on their sins {{and their relationship to}} Christ. This teaching also attests to another day when Christ will sit in universal judgement of all mankind. This final judgement, according to the church's teaching, will bring an end to human history and mark the beginning of both a new and better <b>heaven</b> <b>and</b> earth ruled by God in righteousness.|$|E

5|$|Bart {{attempts}} to reinspire Krusty by showing him old episodes of the show, but {{he picks up}} on the repetitive nature of his own jokes, and binge drinks in anger. He passes out and has a vision of himself in Jewish Heaven, where he meets Rodney Dangerfield. Rabbi Krustofski then appears and tells Krusty that Jews {{do not believe in}} <b>Heaven,</b> <b>and</b> thus he should do more to help others. An act of kindness does not seem to make him happier, but Bart takes Krusty to the synagogue, where Rabbi Krustofski's favorite Rabbi recites Krusty's jokes on religion. Krusty therefore deduces that his father did find him funny, and sees him again in Jewish Heaven, where Jesus turns Dangerfield's water into a Bloody Mary.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{traditional}} Daoist {{ideas were}} retained in Lingbao cosmology, {{such as the}} idea that the world originated from a type of primordial qi known as yuanqi, and then was divided into <b>heaven</b> <b>and</b> earth. Furthermore, the yuanqi is subdivided into three types of qi that correspond to three deities: the lords of the Celestial Treasure, of the Sacred Treasure and of the Divine Treasure. These three deities later introduced the teachings of the Dongzhen (Perfect Grotto), the Dongxuan (Mysterious Grotto), and of the Dongshen (Divine Grotto). These three teachings form the basis for the later classification of texts in the Daozang.|$|E

This pattern is continued in Mr. Nobody, where two deaths open the film and a unique twist on death {{at the end of}} the film conveys a wistful sense of happiness.|$|E
