As Isabel becomes more assertive and outgoing, Charlie becomes suspicious of how quickly his sister has formed new friendships and worries {{that she is}} distancing herself from him. His concerns culminate in an accidental Stravagation to Classe with Isabel's talisman and a near disastrous failed attempt for them both {{to return to their}} own world. However, the incident leaves Charlie impressed with Isabel's resolve and ability and he chooses to support her, though his own stravagation has left him with little interest in returning to Talia.|$|E
5000|$|As to {{the giving}} of goodbye gifts, this was {{customary}} in ancient India. We find an {{example in the}} Book of Pausya (Pausyaparvan, Mbh.1,3) of the Vedic epic Mahábháratha. Here the teacher sends his disciple Uttanka away after Uttanka has proven himself worthy of being trustworthy and {{in the possession of}} all the Vedic and Dharmashastric teachings. Uttanka says to his teacher: [...] "What can I do for you that pleases you (kim te priyam karaváni), because thus it is said: Whoever answers without (being in agreement with) the Dharma, and whoever asks without (being in agreement with) the Dharma (the Law in the literal sense of the word), either occurs: one dies or one attracts animosity."Friedrich Wilhelm (Prüfung und Initiation im Buche Pausya und in der Biographie des Náropa, Wiesbaden 1965, p. 11) maintains that similar phraseology already occurs in the [...] "Book of Manu" [...] (II,111) and in the [...] "Institutes of Vishnu". I.e., taking leave of one's teacher and promising to do whatever this teacher asks of you brings, according to the Vedic teachings, enlightenment or similar attainment. It is therefore not unusual that Angulimála did his teacher's horrible bidding, although being a <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>kind</b> <b>person</b> at heart, in the knowledge that in the end he would reap the highest attainment.|$|E

This favoritism which goes so sweetly and pleasantly down with so many pious people is the chief of all stumbling-blocks to me. I must pray for everybody or nobody, and can't get into any conceptions of relation between Heaven and me, if not also between Heaven and earth, (and why Heaven should allow hairs in pens I can't think).|$|R

6000|$|... 71. Now, {{this being}} one of the most {{complete}} and special ways of wasting money,--no money being less productive of good, or of any percentage whatever, than that which we shake away from the ends of undertakers' plumes,--it is of course the duty of all <b>good</b> economists, <b>and</b> <b>kind</b> <b>persons,</b> to prove <b>and</b> proclaim continually, to the poor as well as the rich, that respect for the dead is not really shown by laying great stones on them to tell us where they are laid; but by remembering where they are laid, without a stone to help us; trusting them to the sacred grass and saddened flowers; and still more, that respect and love are shown to them, not by great monuments to them which we build with our hands, but by letting the monuments stand, which they built with their own. And this is the point now in question.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{dedicated}} to the cultural specificities of three typical collective groups with respect to the representation of love. The research subject focuses on the cross-cultural similarities and differences in how love is conceptualized among highly educated citizens of Brazil (50), Russia (50), and Central Africa (50) (age range 21 – 60; M = 34). We used “The Classical ideas of love: acceptance and distancing” questionnaire (I. A. Djidaryan, E. V. Belovol, & O. V. Maslova) and the “Directed associations with ‘love’ as the wordstimulus” technique (on the basis of C. G. Jung’s associative experiment and P. Vergès’s methodology). The results show similarities and differences in how love is represented among the groups. The following similarities were found: Love is seen as all that is <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>kind</b> about a <b>person,</b> a way to become better. At the peripheral level, the social representation of love includes friendship, patience, and passion. At the point of cross-cultural differences, it was found that: a) The main emotion reflecting how love is represented for Brazilians is honesty, for Russians — suffering, for Central Africans — tenderness; b) Brazilians understand love as a sensual, personal moral choice; Russians perceive love as an obstacle, a problem in itself; Central Africans conceptualize love as God-given and ennobling of the person; c) love is conceptualized as something inherent and family-oriented among Russians, intrapersonal and intimate among Brazilians, and divine among Central Africans. The results mean that within peripheral confines, the notion of love among the groups matches to a certain extent R. Sternberg’s triangle of love, while its core zone is culturally specific...|$|R
