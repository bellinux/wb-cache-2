40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} whether the sleeping position {{and the use of}} duvets in infants in 1994 had changed in comparison with earlier years. Design: Questionnaire survey. Setting: Nationwide investigation in <b>infant</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>centres.</b> Method: 194 <b>infant</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>centres</b> participated in the investigation. In November a questionnaire was completed regarding 25 preferably consecutive infants younger than 10 months, featuring: age in completed months, sex, parity of the mother, birth weight and subsequently: the position in which the infant was laid to sleep, and its cover during the last night. Results: The prone sleeping position decreased roughly from more than 55 % in 1985 - 1987 to 24 % in 1988 and 9 % in 1994. In these surveys prone sleeping was significantly associated with masculine gender, low birthweight and higher parity of the mother. These associations explain at least partly the increased risk of cot death in each of these three conditions. In the Netherlands in November 1994 duvets were still widely used Conclusion: A further reduction of the cot death incidence (in 1993 0, 30 per 1000 live births) may be expected from further implementation of preventive measures...|$|R

60|$|On {{the general}} {{question}} {{of improving the}} health of mothers and babies I would remind readers {{that there is no}} great country where effort is half so much needed as here; we are nearly twice as town and slum ridden as any other people; have grown to be further from nature and more feckless about food; we have damper air to breathe, and less sun to disinfect us. In New Zealand, with a climate somewhat similar to ours, the infant mortality rate has, {{as a result of a}} widespread educational campaign, been reduced within the last few years to 50 per 1,000 from 110 per 1,000 a few years ago. It is perhaps too sanguine to expect that we, so much more town-ridden, can do as well here, but we ought to be able to make a vast improvement. We have begun to. Since 1904, when this matter was first seriously taken in hand, our infant mortality rate has declined from 145 per 1,000 to 91 per 1,000 in 1916. This reduction has been mainly due to the institution of <b>infant</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>centres</b> and whole-time health visitors. Of centres there are now nearly 1,200. We want 5,000 more. Of visitors there are now hardly 1,500. We want, I am told, 2,000 more. It is estimated that the yearly crop of babies, 700,000, if those of the well-to-do be excepted, can be provided with <b>infant</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>centres</b> and whole-time health visitors by expenditure at the rate of £1 a head per year. The Government, which is benevolently disposed towards the movement, gives half of the annual expenditure; the other half falls on the municipalities. But these 5,000 new <b>infant</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>centres</b> and these extra 2,000 health visitors must be started by voluntary effort and subscription. Once started, the Government and the municipalities will have to keep them up; but unless we start them, the babies will go on dying or growing up diseased. The object of the Jewel Fund, therefore, is to secure the necessary money to get the work into train.|$|R

40|$|The infant welfare {{movement}} in Britain has received considerable scholarly attention but continues to generate controversy and debate. Many {{of the services}} began with nineteenth-century voluntary initiative but were later developed by local authorities. Critics have drawn attention to the limitations of such provision; arguing that it was predicated on unattractive assumptions about class and gender roles. Under this interpretation working-class mothers were viewed with suspicion and targeted for advice aimed at inculcating middle-class standards of childcare and housekeeping. This paper accepts {{that there was an}} authoritarian character to much of the early welfare work but suggests that over time this gave way to more inclusive approaches that sought to provide clients with the services that met their real rather than assumed needs.

40|$|Background: We {{aimed to}} {{describe}} {{the natural history of}} heavy episodic drinking (HED) and associated harms from adolescence to young adulthood in a large Australian population cohort study. Method: The Australian Temperament Project consists of mothers and babies (4 – 8 months) recruited from <b>Infant</b> <b>Welfare</b> <b>Centres</b> and followed every 2 to 4 years until age 28 years. Analyses were based on data from 1156 young people (497 male; 659 female) surveyed repeatedly at ages 16, 18, 20, 24 and 28 years. We used dual processes latent class growth analysis to estimate trajectories of HED and associated harms, employing a piecewise approach to model the hypothesized rise and subsequent fall across adolescence and the late twenties, respectively. Results: We identified four sex-specific trajectories and observed little evidence of maturing-out across the twenties. In males, a normative pattern of increasing HED across the twenties with little related harm was observed (40 % of the male sample). Early and late starter groups that peaked in harms at age 20 years with only minor attenuation in binging thereafter were also observed (6. 1 % and 35 %, respectively). In females, a normative pattern of increasing, but moderate, HED with little related harm was observed (44 % of the female sample).

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} current {{prevalence}} {{of risk factors}} for {{sudden infant death syndrome}} (SIDS) in Sweden with a decade earlier, and assess factors associated with prone sleeping. Methods: The results of a cohort study (Infants of Western Sweden) and a population based case-control study (Nordic Epidemiological SIDS Study) were examined. Subjects were 5600 healthy 6 month old infants born in 2003 in the Western Sweden region and 430 healthy Swedish infants born between 1991 and 1995. Results: Prone sleeping decreased from 31. 8 % to 5. 6 % and supine sleeping increased from 35. 3 % to 47. 3 %. Side or side/supine sleeping increased from 25. 2 % to 43. 8 %. Maternal smoking during pregnancy decreased from 23. 5 % to 9. 5 %. The risk for prone sleeping increased if the mother was unemployed (OR 2. 4, 95 % CI 1. 5 to 4. 0), if she was a heavy smoker in the third trimester (OR 44. 1, 95 % CI 1. 6 to 1199. 6), and if the child was irritable (OR 2. 5, 95 % CI 1. 3 to 5. 1), shared a bedroom with siblings (OR 2. 6, 95 % CI 1. 0 to 6. 6), or never used a dummy (OR 3. 2, 95 % CI 1. 9 to 5. 4).

40|$|The {{preparation}} of this submission has provided the opportunity to review the history of children's services provided in the Melbourne City Council. Most of the information in {{this section of the}} submission has been obtained from reports to the Melbourne City Council Health Committee from 1913 to 1980. A study of these reports show that there were four distinct periods: 1. From 1914 until the mid 1930 's when the main concern was with physical hygiene and the main children's service council was the <b>Infant</b> <b>Welfare</b> <b>Centre</b> (Baby Health Centre). The history of this period is reviewed under the heading "Keep the Well Baby Well". This was the slogan chosen by Dr. Vera Scantlebury (Brown) who was the first Maternal and Infant Welfare Visiting Medical Officer for the Council. She was appointed to this position in 1920; 2. From the mid thirties {{to the end of the}} 1940 's when the main concern was with mental hygiene and Melbourne City Council was the leading municipality in establishing kindergartens. The history of this period is reviewed under the heading of "A Child Life That is Magical". These were the words used by Dr. John Dale who was the Medical Officer for the Melbourne City Council from the early 1930 's to the end of the forties; 3. From 1950 to the beginning of the seventies was a period that can best be described with the heading "We Gather Strength as we go" (The motto of the Melbourne City Council). This was a period of consolidation of services but the Melbourne City Council relinquished its pioneering role; 4. During the 1970 's the Council has been seeking social solutions. The Melbourne City Council is once again asserting its capacity to pioneer new types of human services and new forms of community support for services. The words from the Melbourne City Council Strategy Plan are appropriate as a heading for this section. They are "The opportunity to have a Full Life"...|$|E
6000|$|What {{are these}} <b>Infant</b> <b>Welfare</b> <b>Centres,</b> and have they really all this magic? They {{are places where}} mothers to be, or in being, can come for {{instruction}} and help in all that concerns birth and the care of their babies and children up to school age. [...] "Prevention is better than cure," [...] is the motto of these Centres. I {{went to one of}} the largest in London. It has about 600 entries in the year. There were perhaps 40 babies and children and perhaps 30 mothers there. About 20 of these mothers were learning sewing or knitting. Five of them were sitting round a nurse who was bathing a three-weeks-old baby. The young mother who can wash a baby to the taste and benefit of the baby by the light of nature must clearly be something of a phenomenon. In a room downstairs were certain little stoics whose health was poor; they were brought there daily to be watched. One was an air-raid baby, the thinnest little critter ever seen; an ashen bit of a thing through which the wind could blow; very silent, and asking [...] "Why?" [...] with its eyes. They showed me a mother who had just lost her first baby. The Centre was rescuing it from a pauper's funeral. I can see her now, coming in and sitting on the edge of a chair; the sudden puckering of her dried-up little face, the tears rolling down. I shall always remember the tone of her voice--"It's my baby." [...] Her husband is [...] "doing time"; and want of food and knowledge while she was [...] "carrying it" [...] caused the baby's death. Several mothers from her street come to the Centre; but, [...] "keeping herself to herself," [...] she never heard of it till too late. In a hundred little ways these Centres give help and instruction. They, and the Health Visitors who go along with them, are doing a great work; but there are many districts all over the country where there are no Centres to come to; no help and instruction to be got, however desperately wanted. Verily this land of ours still goes like Rachel mourning for her children. Disease, hunger, deformity, and death still hound our babes, and most of that hounding is avoidable. We must and shall revolt against the evil lot, which preventible ignorance, ill health, and poverty bring on hundreds of thousands of children.|$|R

40|$|Is post-natal growth {{during the}} first 2 years of life in IVF singletons {{affected}} by type of medium used for culturing human embryos during an IVF treatment? The in vitro culture of human embryos in medium from Cook resulted in singletons with a lower weight {{during the first}} 2 years of life compared with singletons born after embryo culture in medium from Vitrolife. In a previous study, we reported that type of medium used for culturing human IVF embryos {{during the first few}} days after fertilization until fresh embryo transfer significantly affects fetal growth and consequently birthweight of the resulting singletons. From July 2003 to December 2006, a total of 1432 IVF treatment cycles with fresh embryo transfer were randomly allocated to have all embryos cultured in medium from Vitrolife AB (n = 715) or from Cook (n = 717). Two years after delivery, questionnaires were sent to the parents of all children requesting data about weight, height and head circumference around 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7. 5, 9, 11, 14, 18 and 24 months of age. These measurements were collected as part of the children's health programme at municipal <b>infant</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>centres</b> in the Netherlands by health professionals unaware of this study. Patients requiring donor oocytes or applying for PGD were excluded from the study. From the 294 live born singletons that fulfilled our inclusion criteria, 29 were lost to follow-up. The remaining 265 singletons (Cook group: 117, Vitrolife group: 148) were included in the analysis. Data analysis included linear regression, to compare cross-sectionally weight standard deviation score (SDS), height SDS and head circumference, and the first order Berkey-Reed model for a longitudinal analysis of the growth data. Singletons in the Vitrolife group were heavier during the first 2 years of life compared with singletons in the Cook group. Cross-sectional analyses showed that adjusted weight SDS differed between groups at 1 (0. 35 ± 0. 14, P = 0. 010), 2 (0. 39 ± 0. 14, P = 0. 006), 3 (0. 35 ± 0. 14, P = 0. 011), 4 (0. 30 ± 0. 13, P = 0. 020), 11 (0. 28 ± 0. 13, P = 0. 036), 14 (0. 32 ± 0. 13, P = 0. 014) and 24 (0. 39 ± 0. 15, P = 0. 011) months of age, while adjusted height SDS was only significantly different at 1 (0. 21 ± 0. 11, P = 0. 048) month of age. Head circumference was similar between the two groups at all ages. Longitudinal analyses showed that both post-natal weight (P = 0. 005) and height (P = 0. 031) differed between the groups throughout the first 2 years of life, while the growth velocity was not significantly different between the two groups. Factors that might influence post-natal growth were included in the analysis; however, {{it was not possible to}} include all such factors, for example childhood diseases or nutrition, as this information was not available. The effect of culture medium during the first few days after fertilization on prenatal growth and birthweight persists during the first 2 years of life. This suggests that the human embryo is sensitive to its very early environment, and that the culture medium used in IVF may have lasting consequences. Further monitoring of the long-term growth, development and health of IVF children is therefore warranted. W.
