500|$|In {{order to}} spread his costs over more magazines, Silberkleit soon decided to launch two {{additional}} titles. [...] When {{he had worked}} for Gernsback, Silberkleit had suggested [...] "Future Fiction" [...] as a possible title for the magazine Gernsback was planning to launch. [...] Gernsback eventually chose [...] "Amazing Stories" [...] instead, and Silberkleit now decided to use his original suggestion {{for one of the}} new magazines. [...] In November 1939 the first issue of Future Fiction appeared; it was followed in July 1940 by Science Fiction Quarterly. [...] Hornig was editor for all three magazines. [...] In October 1940, Hornig received his military draft notice; he was a pacifist, and decided to move to California and register as a conscientious objector. [...] He continued to edit the magazines from the west coast, but Silberkleit was unhappy with the arrangement. [...] Silberkleit allowed Hornig to retain his post as editor of Science Fiction, and offered the editorship of the other two titles to Sam Moskowitz. [...] Moskowitz declined, saying afterwards [...] "I would never strike at a man's job", but Donald Wollheim heard of the offer and prompted Robert W. Lowndes to write to Silberkleit. [...] Lowndes later recalled Wollheim's idea: [...] "In the letter, I'd suggest that {{it might be a good}} idea to add a science fiction title to the list, offering my services as editor at a slightly lower price than Hornig was being paid, and also find fault with all the other sf titles presently out, but particularly with Hornig's". [...] Lowndes relates that Silberkleit took the bait and hired him in November 1940; Hornig recalls the separation as being by mutual consent because of his move to California. [...] Lowndes subsequently agreed that this was likely to be the real reason Silberkleit replaced Hornig. [...] The first issues Lowndes was responsible for were the Spring 1941 issue of Science Fiction Quarterly and the April 1941 issue of Future Fiction. [...] He completed the preparations for the last issue of Science Fiction, dated September 1941, but he used material that Hornig had already selected for the article, with minor exceptions. [...] The changes included the replacement of Fantasy Times, a fan department by James Taurasi, with Futurian Times, a similar department from a rival group of fans, the Futurians, to which Lowndes belonged. [...] Initially Silberkleit kept tighter control on Lowndes' editorial selections than he had on Hornig's, vetoing five of the seven stories Lowndes proposed for the April 1941 Future, but by the August 1941 issue, Lowndes later recalled, Silberkleit [...] "was satisfied that <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was doing, and... didn't need to oversee any story I had accepted".|$|E
