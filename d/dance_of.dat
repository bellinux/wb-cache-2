5|$|Ethiopia has a long, {{historical}} {{reputation as}} a place where the weapon dance plays an important cultural role. According to Lucian, a Greek writer from the 2nd century, “The Ethiopians dance also during the battle. The Ethiopian never shoots his arrow without dancing and making a menacing gesture beforehand. He wants to frighten the enemy by his dance beforehand.” The broad range of weapon dances includes the hota jumping <b>dance</b> <b>of</b> Amharic males; the attack <b>dance</b> <b>of</b> the Hailefo; the stick-dance of the Kullo; the Beroronsi Hama Haban, a dramatic dagger <b>dance</b> <b>of</b> the Esa; and the shire, the saber <b>dance</b> <b>of</b> the Tigrean nomadic shepherds.|$|E

5|$|Related to weapon {{dances and}} war dances is the <b>dance</b> <b>of</b> the hunt. A very early {{reference}} to a weapon <b>dance</b> <b>of</b> the hunt {{comes in the form}} of a rock engraving at Çatal Höyük, the large neolithic settlement in south-central Anatolia. It depicts a hunting ritual involving dancers holding their bows; one figure has a bow in each hand, two perform artistic leaps and another holds a horn-shaped stick and is striking a frame drum.|$|E

40|$|Objectives Between 1400 and 1800, <b>Dances</b> <b>of</b> Death were {{a popular}} art form {{depicting}} a metaphorical encounter between Death {{and representatives of}} a stratified human society. We review the thematic development <b>of</b> <b>Dances</b> <b>of</b> Death and study the development of social critique. Methods We first assembled a full catalogue <b>of</b> all <b>Dances</b> <b>of</b> Death created between 1400 and 1800. We then analyzed patterns of spatiotemporal diffusion and made an in-depth hermeneutic study of the combined texts and images of a carefully selected set <b>of</b> 20 <b>Dances</b> <b>of</b> Death, comparing four distinct periods (1425 - 1525, 1525 - 1600, 1600 - 1650, and 1650 - 1800). Results We identified more than 500 <b>Dances</b> <b>of</b> Death. It was only in its first stage of development, coinciding with the Pre-Reformation (1425 - 1525), that social critique was very prominent. This was represented in four forms: explicit references to social (in) equality, to failures of the authorities, and to emancipated farmers, and a general social realism. In later phases social critique largely disappeared {{and was replaced by}} religious themes. Conclusions <b>Dances</b> <b>of</b> Death provide historical context to current analyses and debates of social inequalities in health. They remind us of the stubbornness of these inequalities, which despite progress in material well-being are still very much with us today...|$|R
5|$|All organisms can exhibit behaviours. Even plants express complex behaviour, {{including}} {{memory and}} communication. Behavioural ecology {{is the study}} of an organism's behaviour in its environment and its ecological and evolutionary implications. Ethology {{is the study of}} observable movement or behaviour in animals. This could include investigations of motile sperm of plants, mobile phytoplankton, zooplankton swimming toward the female egg, the cultivation of fungi by weevils, the mating <b>dance</b> <b>of</b> a salamander, or social gatherings of amoeba.|$|E

5|$|The quadrille {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} <b>dance</b> <b>of</b> the Dominican folk tradition, which also includes the lancer and distinctive forms of several dances, many of them derived from European styles. The bidjin (biguine), mereng (méringue), sotis (schottische), polka pil (pure polka), vals o vyenn (Viennese waltz) and mazouk (mazurka) are particularly widespread.|$|E
5|$|Tripura {{is noted}} for bamboo and cane handicrafts. Bamboo, wood and cane {{are used to}} create an array of furniture, utensils, {{hand-held}} fans, replicas, mats, baskets, idols and interior decoration materials. Music and dance are integral {{to the culture of}} the state. Some local musical instruments are the sarinda, chongpreng (both string instruments), and sumui (a type of flute). Each indigenous community has its own repertoire of songs and dances performed during weddings, religious occasions, and other festivities. The Tripuri and Jamatia people perform goria dance during the Goria puja. Jhum dance (also called tangbiti dance), lebang dance, mamita dance, and mosak sulmani dance are other Tripuri dance forms. Reang community, the second largest scheduled tribe of the state, is noted for its hojagiri dance that is performed by young girls balanced on earthen pitchers. Bizhu dance is performed by the Chakmas during the Bizhu festival (the last day of the month of Chaitra in Hindu calendar). Other dance forms include wangala <b>dance</b> <b>of</b> the Garo people, hai-hak <b>dance</b> <b>of</b> the Halam branch of Kuki people, and sangrai dance and owa <b>dance</b> <b>of</b> the Mog. Alongside such traditional music, mainstream Indian musical elements such as Indian classical music and dance, Rabindra Sangeet are also practised. Sachin Dev Burman, a member of the royal family, was a maestro in the filmi genre of Indian music.|$|E
5|$|According to legend, Shiva's wife Sati immolated {{herself in}} the yajna-fire of her father Daksha, as a protest against Shiva's dishonor. The God became furious and started to dance the Tāndava with Sati's body on his shoulders. Knowing that the <b>dance</b> <b>of</b> {{destruction}} was about to annihilate the world, Vishnu cut the body of Sati to pieces with Sudarshana Chakram, his celestial weapon, thereby appeasing Shiva. Each of 51 pieces of the body fell to earth, and the place where each piece fell became a holy center of pilgrimage or Shakti Peetha. The legend goes that Sati's right arm fell near a now-extinct hot spring at the Chandranth peak in Sitakunda. The site is marked by the temple of Sambhunath just below the Chandranath temple {{on top of the}} peak, and it is a major tirtha for Hindus in Bangladesh.|$|E

5|$|Ahmedabad observes a {{wide range}} of festivals. Popular {{celebrations}} and observances include Uttarayan, an annual kite-flying day on 14 and 15 January. Nine nights of Navratri are celebrated with people performing Garba, the most popular folk <b>dance</b> <b>of</b> Gujarat, at venues across the city. The festival of lights, Deepavali, is celebrated with the lighting of lamps in every house, decorating the floors with rangoli, and the lighting of firecrackers. The annual Rath Yatra procession on the Ashadh-sud-bij date of the Hindu calendar at the Jagannath Temple and the procession of Tajia during the Muslim holy month of Muharram are important events.|$|E
5|$|In 1967 Olivier {{was caught}} in the middle of a {{confrontation}} between Chandos and Tynan over the latter's proposal to stage Rolf Hochhuth's Soldiers. As the play speculatively depicted Churchill as complicit in the assassination of the Polish prime minister Władysław Sikorski, Chandos regarded it as indefensible. At his urging the board unanimously vetoed the production. Tynan considered resigning over this interference with the management's artistic freedom, but Olivier himself stayed firmly in place, and Tynan also remained. At about this time Olivier began a long struggle against a succession of illnesses. He was treated for prostate cancer and, during rehearsals for his production of Chekhov's Three Sisters he was hospitalised with pneumonia. He recovered enough to take the heavy role of Edgar in Strindberg's The <b>Dance</b> <b>of</b> Death, the finest of all his performances other than in Shakespeare, in Gielgud's view.|$|E
5|$|Indira Parthasarathy's Nandan Kathai (1978) {{builds the}} tale of Nandanar (referred in the work as Nandan) further, {{introducing}} two non-Brahmin upper caste landholders, who are as ruthless as Bharati's Vediyar. Nandanar is portrayed as a lover of art, rather than God. He {{wants to see the}} cosmic <b>dance</b> <b>of</b> Nataraja. A Devadasi called Abhirami also appears; no significant female characters are found in earlier narratives. Indira is blunt in reprimanding the Dalits for not understanding Nandanar. Nandan Kathai is a quest for liberation of Dalits and women alike. Unlike earlier narratives, Indira's tale is devoid of miracles and is a story of how Nandanar falls prey to a conspiracy. The Vediyar-priest, the Vediyar-landlord and the two non-Brahmin upper caste landholders, hatch a plot to end Nandan. They make Nandanar believe that God harvested crop from the field, an allusion to the miracle of Vediyar's impossible task in Bharati's work. Then, they persuade him to organize a dance contest between Bharatnatyam, the high-caste elites' dance and the folk <b>dance</b> <b>of</b> the Dalits. Finally, in the climax, Nandanar agrees to undergo a fire-trial, reassured by the earlier miracle, but he and Abhirami burn in the flames. The upper castes succeed in sending a warning to Dalits how trespassers of the caste code, longing for salvation, would be punished.|$|E

5|$|Matsya Purana tells a {{different}} story of Chamunda's origins. She with other matrikas was created by Shiva to help him kill the demon Andhakasura, who has an ability - like Raktabija - to generate from his dripping blood. Chamunda with the other matrikas drinks {{the blood of the}} demon ultimately helping Shiva kill him. Ratnakara, in his text Haravijaya, also describes this feat of Chamunda, but solely credits Chamunda, not the other matrikas of sipping the blood of Andhaka. Having drunk the blood, Chamunda's complexion changed to blood-red. The text further says that Chamunda does a <b>dance</b> <b>of</b> destruction, playing a musical instrument whose shaft is Mount Meru, the spring is the cosmic snake Shesha and gourd is the crescent moon. She plays the instrument during the deluge that drowns the world.|$|E
5|$|The Carnival of the Animals, Finale was {{directed}} by Goldberg; his wife Susan was its art director. The idea originated from animator Joe Grant, {{one of the two}} story directors on Fantasia who loved the ostriches in <b>Dance</b> <b>of</b> the Hours. When development for Fantasia 2000 began, Grant suggested the idea of having one of the ostriches play with a yo-yo to the last movement of The Carnival of the Animals. The ostriches were later changed to flamingos as Disney wished to avoid reintroducing characters from the original film and thought flamingos would look more colorful on the screen. Goldberg was partly inspired by co-director Mike Gabriel, who would play with a yo-yo as he took a break from working on Pocahontas (1995). The segment was produced with CGI and 6,000 watercolor paintings on heavy bond paper.|$|E
5|$|The Hindu {{caste system}} was present and devadasis were {{recognised}} by the government. Some kings had concubines (ganikas) {{who were given}} much respect, and Sati was perhaps absent since widows like Vinayavathi and Vijayanka are mentioned in records. Devadasis were however present in temples. Sage Bharata's Natyashastra, the precursor to Bharatanatyam, the classical <b>dance</b> <b>of</b> South India, was popular and is seen in many sculptures and is mentioned in inscriptions. Some women from the royal family enjoyed political power in administration. Queen Vijayanka was a noted Sanskrit poet, Kumkumadevi, the younger sister of Vijayaditya (and queen of Alupa King Chitravahana) made several grants and had a Jain basadi called Anesajjebasadi constructed at Puligere, and the queens of VikramadityaII, Lokamahadevi and Trailokyamahadevi made grants and possibly consecrated the Lokesvara Temple (now called Virupaksha temple) but also and the Mallikarjuna temple respectively at Pattadakal.|$|E
