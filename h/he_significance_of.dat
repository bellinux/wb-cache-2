50|$|As a young {{professor}} at UC Davis, Deamer {{continued to work}} with electron microscopy, revealing {{for the first time}} particles related to functional ATPase enzymes within the membranes of sarcoplasmic reticulum. After spending sabbaticals in England at the University of Bristol in 1971 and with Alec Bangham in 1975, Deamer became interested in liposomes. Conversations with Bangham inspired his research on the role of membranes in the origin of life, and in 1985 Deamer demonstrated that the Murchison carbonaceous meteorite contained lipid-like compounds that could assemble into membranous vesicles. Deamer described <b>he</b> <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> self-assembly processes in his 2011 book First Life. In collaborative work with Mark Akeson, a post-doctoral student at the time, the two established methods for monitoring proton permeation through ion channels such as gramicidin. In 1989, while returning from a scientific meeting in Oregon, Deamer conceived that {{it might be possible to}} sequence single molecules of DNA by using an imposed voltage to pull them individually through a nanoscopic channel. The DNA sequence could be distinguished by the specific modulating effect of the four bases on the ionic current through the channel. In 1993, he and Dan Branton initiated a research collaboration with John Kasianowitz at NIST to explore this possibility with the hemolysin channel, and in 1996 published the first paper demonstrating that nanopore sequencing may be feasible. George Church at Harvard had independently proposed a similar idea, and Church, Branton and Deamer decided to initiate a patent application which was awarded in 1998. Mark Akeson joined the research effort in 1997, and in 1999 published a paper showing that the hemolysin channel, now referred to as a nanopore, could distinguish between purine and pyrimidine bases in single RNA molecules. In 2007, Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) licensed the patents describing the technology and in 2014 released the MinION nanopore sequencing device to selected researchers. The first publications appeared in 2015, one of which used the MinION to sequence E. coli DNA with 99.4% accuracy relative to the established 5.4 million base pair genome. Despite earlier skepticism, nanopore sequencing is now accepted as a viable third generation sequencing method. The original 1996 paper has been cited over 2000 times in the scientific literature, and in 2017, twenty one years later, a Google search for nanopore sequencing returned 226,000 results.|$|E

40|$|In situ {{rates of}} {{methanogenesis}} and methane oxidation were measured in meromictic Big Soda Lake. Methane production {{was measured by}} the accumulation of methane in the headspaces of anaerobically sealed water samples; radiotracer was used to follow methane oxidation. Nearly all the methane oxidation occurred in the anoxic zones of the lake. Rates of anaerobic oxidation exceeded production at all depths studied in both the mixolimnion (2 - 6 vs. 0. 1 - 1 nmol liter- ' d-I) and monimolimnion (49 - 85 vs. 1. 6 - 12 nmol liter- ' d-I) of the lake. Thus, a net consumption of methane equivalent to 1. 36 mmol m- ' d ' occurred in the anoxic water column. Anaerobic methane oxidation had a first-order rate constant of 8. 1 k 0. 5 x 10 -"-', and activity was eliminated by filter sterilization. However, in situ methane oxidation was of insuficient magnitude to cause a noticeable decrease of ambient dissolved methane levels over an incubation period of 97 h. 7 <b>he</b> <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> and the organisms re-sponsible for methane oxidation within an-oxic waters and sediments are current sub-jects of debate.

40|$|Attempted {{practical}} applications of existing classifications of sedimentary ocks commonly encounter diiaculties and inconsistencies: (1) sediments normally unassociated during dep-osition are artificially grouped together; (2) inferences about environment, degree of tectonic influence, {{and other factors}} not everywhere l gible in the rocks are required in differentiating major categories; (3) rocks of rare and common occurrence are given equal treatment; and (4) important rock types, such as shales and carbonates, are inadequately subdivided in contrast to attention accorded sandstone. The proposed classilication is designed for rapid determination of sedimentary rocks using lhe binocular microscope. The system of identitication proceeds in regular order from charac-teristics which are most readily recognized to those which require more critical examination. Examples of specitic conglomerate, sandstone, shale, and limestone varieties are listed and are arranged in groups m indicate their associations. THE PROBLEM OF ORtiANIZATION The presumed randmn petrographic character and simple aspect of sedimen-tar 3 • rocks as compared to igneous or metamorphic types has delayed recogni-tion of the complex, inter-related char-acteristics of sediments. The ease with which a sandstone or shale can be identi-fied {{as opposed to the}} difficulty in recog-nizing, for example, a quartz diorite has masked the subtle complexity of sand-stones and shales. Hence, despite Gra-bau's early proposal of an elaborate sub-division of sedimentary rocks, there has been little tendency to distinguish, and interpret <b>he</b> <b>significance</b> <b>of,</b> varieties of limestones, shales and sandstones. Except in the use of such adjectives as "argil-laceous, " "siliceous, " or "calcareous," few descriptive petrographic terms have been used as refinements in characteriz-ing a given sedimentary layer or a hand specimen; and little inquiry " has been made into the repeated occurrences of certain rocks of surprisingly similar prop...|$|E
40|$|Drawing on {{multiple}} data sources in St. Louis, {{this article examines}} how gendered situational dynamics hape gang violence, including participation in violent offending and experiences ofviolent victimization. Combining an analysis of in-depth interviews with young women in St. Louis gangs with an examination ofhomicide reports from the same city, we find that young women, even regular offenders, highlight <b>he</b> <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> gender in shap-ing and limiting their involvement in serious violence. They use gender both to accomplish their criminal activities and to temper their involvement in gang crime. Consequently their risk for serious physical victimization i gangs is considerably tess than young men's. St. Louis homicide data col-laborate these qualitative findings. Not only are young women {{much less likely to}} be the victims of gang homicide, {{but the vast majority of}} female gang homicide victims were not the intended targets of the attack. In con-trast, homicide reports suggest that the majority of male gang homicide vic-t. ims were the intended targets. We suggest that gendered group processes and stratification within gangs are key factors explaining both violent of-fending and victimization risk in gangs. * The authors thank Cheryl Maxson, Rick Rosenfeld, Rick Rabe, Natalie Vo-ris, and the anonymous reviewers at JQ for feedback and assistance.

40|$|Die voorkoms van verteenwoordigers van die Ancylidae in Suid-Afrika is reeds in 1848 gerapporteer. Die eerste omvattende studie van hierdie familie in Suid-Afrika is egter eers in 1923 gepubliseer. Alhoewel verskeie bydraes sedertdien gepubliseer is, is verskeie outeurs van mening dat bestaande kennis oor die Ancylidae steeds gebrekkig is en dat hersiening nie net op spesievlak nie maar ook op genus-vlak nodig is. Tans is daar 14 Burnupia spesies op rekord in die databasis van die Nasionale Varswaterslakversameling (NVWSV). Hierdie bydrae handel oor die geograﬁ ese verspreiding en {{habitats}} van B. capensis en B. stenochorias die twee Ancylidae spesies waarvan die meeste versamelpunte in die databasis van die NVWSV op rekord is en wat ook die mees wydverspreide geograﬁ ese verspreiding van hierdie familie vertoon. Alhoewel beide spesies in die meerderheid van die verskeidenheid van waterliggame wat in die databasis vermeld word, aangetref is, is die grootste getal monsters van albei in standhoudende riviere en spruite en op ’n klipperige substraat versamel. Albei spesies is nie gerapporteer uit die droër streke van Suid-Afrika nie waarskynlik as gevolg van ’n beperkte vermoë om desikkasie te kan oorleef in gebiede waar standhoudende habitats ’n uitsondering is. Resultate dui daarop dat hoogte bo seevlak en aard van die substraat ’n belangrike rol gespeel het in die daarstelling van hul gedokumenteerde geograﬁ ese verspreiding soos weerspieël deur die rekords in die NVWSV. Min is oor die bewaringstatus van die Ancylidae van Suid-Afrika bekend, maar die karige inligting wat wel tot ons beskikking is, dui op rede tot kommer. Om sinvolle uitsprake oor die bewaringstatus en spesiediversiteit van die Mollusca van Suid-Afrika te kan maak, word aanbeveel dat van die versamelpunte op rekord weer besoek behoort te word waarna die resultate met die bestaande rekords in die databasis van die NVWSV vergelyk kan word.   AbstractDistribution of Burnupia capensis (Walker, 1912) and Burnupia stenochorias (Melvill &amp; Ponsonby, 1903) (Gastropoda: Ancylidae) in South Africa The {{presence of}} Ancylidae in South Africa was established {{as early as}} 1848 but the ﬁrst comprehensive study on this family was reported in 1923. This author {{came to the conclusion}} that extensive work still had to be done before it could be declared that knowledge pertaining to the South African representatives of this family could be considered as satisfactory. Another important contribution on South African Ancylidae was published in 1939. After a detailed morphological and histological study on Burnupia mooiensis three decades later the authors stated that the axonomy of the Ancylidae still remained unsatisfactory, a view that was supported by authors as recently as 2002. The National Freshwater Snail Collection (NFSC) was established in 1956 but he oldest sample of Ancylidae on record dates back to 1954 and at present 14 species of Burnupia are represented in the database of the NFSC. This contribution deals with the geographical distribution and speciﬁc characteristics of the habitats of B. capensis and B. stenochorias the two most widespread species of this genus in South Africa. Very little is known of the conservation status of the Ancylidae of this country but some results pertaining to this subject are brieﬂy discussed. Burnupia species are relatively inconspicuous organisms that are usually attached to solid objects on the substratum or aquatic vegetation and need to be speciﬁ cally looked for during surveys. Personnel of government authorities and municipalities who made substantial contributions to the number of samples in the NFSC therefore received special training in sampling echniques during workshops. Identiﬁcation of the specimens was largely based on shell and radula characteristics and on he location of the site of collection. Only samples of which the sampling sites could be located on the 1 : 250 000 topo cadastral map series of South Africa were considered for further analysis. Respectively 702 and 435 samples of B. capensis and B. stenochorias met this requirement. The loci (1 / 16 th square degrees) in which the collection sites of these species were located, were distributed in pre-selected intervals of mean annual air temperature and rainfall, as well as ntervals of mean altitude, to illustrate the frequency of occurrence within speciﬁc intervals. A temperature index was calculated for all mollusc species in the database from their frequencies of occurrence within the selected intervals and the results used to rank them in order of their association with low to high climatic temperatures. Chi-square values were calculated to evaluate <b>he</b> <b>signiﬁcance</b> <b>of</b> the difference between frequencies of occurrence in, on, or at the various options or each parameter investigated and furthermore an effect size value was calculated to determine he contribution of each parameter towards establishing the geographical distribution of this species based on the data in the database. A multivariate analysis in the form of a decision tree was also constructed from the data which enabled the selection and ranking of those variables hat maximally discriminated between the frequency of occurrence of these two species in, on, or at the various options for each parameter as compared to all other mollusc species in the database. The majority of samples of both species were collected in rivers and streams and in habitats described as perennial with slow running and clear water. The presence of associated vegetation and a predominantly stony substratum was mentioned for the majority of sampling sites. The geographical distribution of these two species overlapped to a large extent and they were recorded together in 55 loci. However, the 257 loci from which B. capensis were collected covered a more extensive geographical area than the 108 loci from which B. stenochorias was recorded. Both species were poorly represented in the Limpopo, North West and Northern Cape province, a phenomenon that could probably be attributed to a paucity of perennial habitats and the fact that both species in question have poor abilities to overcome conditions of desiccation prevalent in seasonal habitats. Due to the fact that the majority of samples were collected in rivers and streams and on a stony substratum and also because of their largely sessile mode of existence, it is suggested that the feasibility to exploit these two species as indicators of heavy metal pollution should be investigated. It is a known fact that molluscs can accumulate heavy metals in their soft tissue and can also deposit organic substances in their shells. Large scale surveys for freshwater molluscs was terminated in the 1980 ’s and most of the collection sites recorded in the NFSC were not revisited since, therefore little is known of the conservation status of the freshwater molluscs of South Africa. A comparison of results of several surveys conducted in the Kruger National Park over a period of nearly four decades revealed a marked decline in the number of positive sites with regard to several mollusc species including representatives of the Ancylidae. The well documented geographical distribution of several species of Burnupia in the database of the NFSC could serve as a base of reference for an investigation of the conservation status of this genus of the Ancylidae in South Africa. The fact that these species are well represented in rivers and streams and on stony substratums could facilitate such an investigation in the sense that surveys could be focused on these types of water body. A comparison of the results of such surveys with the documented geographical distribution of all freshwater molluscs in the database of the NFSC could contribute substantially towards the knowledge currently available on the conservation status and species diversity of our indigenous molluscs. ...|$|E
