40|$|SummaryAim: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to propose a procedure to measure the vertical larynx position in the neck at rest in young adults without vocal complaint. Study Design: Transversal cohort study. Material and method: There were 68 subjects, aged between 18 to 44 years, 33 female and 35 male. The anatomical landmarks used for this research study were the right and left jaw angle (RJA and LJA), the centre of the cricoid arch cartilage (CC) and the centre of the sternal furculum (SF). In order to obtain the measures, the subjects were asked to be sitting still with their heads stretched up to the highest possible position. The devices used were a <b>drawing</b> <b>compass</b> and a 20 -centimeter ruler. Results: The measurement procedure proved to be easy and it did not show any discomfort to the participants. There was no statistically significant difference between genders related to the vertical larynx position in the neck; however the women presented higher larynx position than men. The vertical larynx position was easily obtained {{and it seems to be}} a very interesting parameter to intra-subject clinical follow-up...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{two-point}} discrimination (TPD) test {{is one of}} the most commonly used neurosensory tests to assess mechanoperception in the clinical settings. While there have been numerous studies of functional sensibility of the hand using TPD test, there have been relatively not enough reports on TPD in the orofacial region. Objective The aims of the present study were to determine the normal values of TPD in the six trigeminal sites (the forehead, cheek, mentum, upper lip, lower lip, and the tongue tip) and to investigate the effect of the site, sex, and test modality on the TPD perception. Material and Methods Forty healthy volunteers consisting of age-matched men (20) and women (20) with a mean age of 27. 1 years were recruited. One examiner performed the TPD test using a simple hand-operated device, i. e., by <b>drawing</b> <b>compass</b> with a blunt or sharp-pointed tip. The static TPD with a blunt-pointed tip (STPDB), moving TPD with a blunt-pointed tip (MTPDB), and static TPD with a sharp-pointed tip (STPDS) were measured. The predictors were the site, sex, and test modality, and the outcome variable was the TPD value. Three-way ANOVA was used for statistics. Results The analysis showed a significant effect of the site, sex and test modality on the TPD values. Significant differences between the test sites were observed with the descending order from the forehead and cheek>mentum>upper lip and lower lip>tongue tip and index finger. Women showed lower TPD values than those of men. The STPDS measurements were consistently lower than those of the STPDB and MTPDB. Conclusions The normal values of TPD in this study suggest that the cheek and forehead were less sensitive than other regions evaluated and women were more sensitive than men. The STPDS was the most sensitive test modality...|$|E

50|$|French curves {{are made}} of wood, plastic or celluloid. Some set squares also have these curves cut in the middle. French curves are used for drawing curves which cannot be <b>drawn</b> with <b>compasses.</b> A faint {{freehand}} curve is first drawn through the known points; the longest possible curve that coincides exactly with the freehand curve is then found out from the French curves.

60|$|A. There is, first, {{a steady}} change {{through the whole}} line from less to more curvature, or more to less, so that {{no part of the}} line is a segment of a circle, or can be <b>drawn</b> by <b>compasses</b> in any way whatever.

5|$|Similar {{methods can}} be used to enclose an {{arbitrary}} simple polygon within a curve of constant width, whose width equals the diameter of the given polygon. The resulting shape consists of circular arcs (at most as many as sides of the polygon), can be constructed algorithmically in linear time, and can be <b>drawn</b> with <b>compass</b> and straightedge. Although the regular-polygon based Reuleaux polygons all have an odd number of circular-arc sides, it is possible to construct constant-width shapes based on irregular polygons that have an even number of sides.|$|R
50|$|The first girih {{patterns}} {{were made by}} copying a pattern template along a regular grid; the pattern was <b>drawn</b> with <b>compass</b> and straightedge. Today, artisans using traditional techniques use a pair of dividers to leave an incision mark on a paper sheet that has been left in the sun to become brittle. Straight lines are drawn with a pencil and an unmarked straightedge. Girih patterns made this way are like a two-dimensional crystal, tiling the plane with a unit cell. Because the tiling was done by translation or rotation operations, the unit cells had 2-, 3-, 4- or 6-fold rotational symmetry.|$|R

50|$|From {{around the}} year 1200, girih {{patterns}} were made with stars and polygon patterns having 5- and 10-fold rotational symmetry. Such figures can be <b>drawn</b> by <b>compass</b> and straightedge. However, by the 15th century some girih patterns were no longer periodic, but were constructed {{by the use of}} girih tiles. These are a set of five tiles with lines drawn on them; when used to tile the plane with no gaps, the lines on the tiles form a girih pattern. It is not yet known when girih tiles were first used instead of compass and straightedge construction. It is considered likely that girih tiles were used on some buildings built around 1200.|$|R

As Guert now fancied he was well entered on the right course, he disdained to turn to renew his observation, but called out for us to 'come on;' as he had a new tree for his guide, and that in the true direction. We may have proceeded in this manner for half a mile, and I began to think that Guert was about to triumph--for, to me, it did really seem that our course was as straight as it had been at any time that day.

5000|$|The {{implication}} of reading Thrascias and Meses as half-winds, {{and the others}} as principal winds, is that this implies Aristotle's construction is asymmetric.

However, an alternative hypothesis is that they will be more equally spaced around 30° from each other. By way of guidance, Aristotle mentions that the easterly and westerly positions are that of the sun as seen on the horizon at dawn and at dusk at different times of the year. Using his alphabetical notation, Aristotle notes that during the summer solstice the sun rises at Z (Caecis) and sets at E (Argestes); during the equinox, it rises at B (Apeliotes) and sets at A (Zephyrus), and finally during the winter solstice it rises at Δ (Eurus) and sets at Γ (Lips).
