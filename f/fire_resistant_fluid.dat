40|$|This is a {{case study}} {{regarding}} frequent forced outages in an oil-fired power generating station due to failure of <b>fire</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>fluid</b> (FRF) piping of material ASTM A- 304. This analysis was done {{to find out the}} most probable cause of failure and to rectify the problem. Methods for finding and analyzing the cracks include nondestructive testing techniques such as visual testing (VT) and dye penetrant testing (PT) along with that periodic monitoring after rectification of problem. The study revealed that pitting and pit to crack transitions were formed in stainless steel piping containing high pressure (system pressure 115 bars) <b>fire</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>fluid.</b> However, after replacement of piping the pitting and cracking reoccurred. It was observed that due to possible exposure to chlorinated moisture in surrounding environment pitting was formed which then transformed into cracks. The research work discussed in this paper illustrates the procedure used in detection of the problem and measures taken to solve the problem...|$|E

5000|$|Nearly 12,000 M48s {{were built}} from 1952 to 1959. The early designs, {{up to the}} M48A2C, were powered by a {{gasoline}} 12-cylinder engine and a 1-cylinder auxiliary generator (called the [...] "Little Joe"). The gasoline engine versions gave the tank a shorter operating range and were more prone to catching fire when hit. Although considered less reliable than diesel-powered versions, numerous examples saw combat use in various Arab-Israeli conflicts. The low flashpoint of MIL-PRF-6083 hydraulic fluid used in the recoil mechanisms and hydraulic systems for rotating weapons or aiming devices was less than 212 F and {{could result in a}} fireball in the crew compartment when the lines were ruptured. MIL-PRF-6083 fluid was not peculiar to the M48 and is no longer used in combat armored vehicles, having been replaced by <b>fire</b> <b>resistant</b> hydraulic <b>fluid.</b> Beginning in 1959, most American M48s were upgraded to the M48A3 model, which featured a more reliable and longer-range diesel power plant. M48s with gasoline engines, however, were still in use in the US Army through 1968, and through 1975 by many West German Army units.|$|R

40|$|Hydraulics is an {{efficient}} and a generally {{good way of}} transferring energy, but the technology does not come without its drawbacks. One in particular is when it is used in hot environments. Oil fires are devastating and hard to extinguish, the catastrophe in Bois du Cazier 1956 tells us this with its 262 casualties of which most were coal mining workers. The tragedy started with a simple short circuit. In Outotecs plants hydraulics is commonly used. With background in Outotecs customer demands this thesis investigates fire-resistant, non-mineral oil based, hydraulic fluids and implements them in an existent plant, Outotecs kaldo furnace TBRC. The components in the hydraulic system have been modeled using Solidworks and assembled as a hydraulic unit, Power Pack, that has been placed within a 20 feet shipping container. A Life Cycle Cost-analysis has been made for the furnace with the hydraulics and lance systems. A hydraulic fluid analysis has been made using industrial standards, hydraulic- and tribologic theory and contact with leading hydraulic suppliers. The modeling of the system has been made using Solidworks with basis in performance demands, service and reliability, study visits and mechanical hydraulic theory. The LCC-analysis is based on Outotec experience and economic reports delivered by one of Outotecs operational organisations which contains operational characteristics from a similar TBRC in service. The primary choice of <b>fire</b> <b>resistant</b> hydraulic <b>fluid</b> is the polyol ester {{which is the result}} of a fatyt acid and an alcohol. The fluid can be used in the current system without any modifications. The alternative is a water and glycol based hydraulic fluid, if this liquid is used the pumps and motors have to be downrated in the current hydraulic system in the TBRC. The component layout is evolved around the tank. On it the filters are placed, beside it the pumps. Accessibility and service operation controls the placement of the other components. For example the accumulator rack also acts as a valve support. Validerat; 20150824 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R
