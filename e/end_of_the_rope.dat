5|$|Oba Chandler (October 11, 1946November 15, 2011) was an American man {{convicted and}} {{executed}} for the June 1989 triple murders of Joan Rogers {{and her two}} daughters, whose bodies were found, with their hands and feet bound, floating in Tampa Bay, Florida. Autopsies showed the victims had been thrown into the water while still alive, with ropes around their necks with a concrete block tied at the other <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rope.</b> The case became high-profile in 1992 when local police posted, on billboards, enlarged copies of the suspect's handwriting recovered on a pamphlet in the victims' car. Chandler was identified as the killer when his neighbor recognized the handwriting. This was the first such use of billboards by law enforcement in the U.S.; billboards became useful tools in searches for missing people.|$|E
5|$|The {{weather had}} begun to deteriorate, and {{it was decided that}} the schuit was not strong enough to bring the {{remaining}} Malagasy ashore. One end of a rope was anchored to the shore, and at low tide volunteers from the Dutch group on shore swam out to Meermin, bringing the other <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> with them and handing it up to the crew on the ship. The crew then helped the remaining fifty-three Malagasy climb down to the Dutch volunteers, who helped them to shore, some carrying children on their backs. The Dutch built a fire to warm the Malagasy after their immersion in the water, and fed them; three wagons took them to Cape Town on 12March. Of the 140 or so Malagasy who had been shipped, 112 reached the Cape Colony as slaves.|$|E
25|$|In Indonesia, Tarik Tambang is {{a popular}} sport held in many events, such as the Indonesian Independence Day celebration, school events, and scout events. The rope used is called dadung, made from fibers of lar between two jousters. Two cinder blocks are placed a {{distance}} apart and the two jousters stand upon the blocks with a rope stretched between them. The objective for each jouster is to either a) cause their opponent to fall off their block, or b) to take their opponent's <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> from them.|$|E

25|$|Abseiling can be dangerous, and {{presents}} risks, especially to unsupervised or inexperienced abseilers. According to German mountaineer Pit Schubert, about 25% of climbing deaths occur during abseiling, most commonly due to failing anchors. Another frequent cause of accidents is abseiling beyond the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rope.</b> Backing up the rope set-up with a friction knot (autoblock, Kleimheist, or prusik) {{such that the}} slipping of the rope is stopped even if the climber lets go of the control rope provides a measure of safety {{with regard to the}} control of the rate of descent.|$|E
25|$|Surratt and {{the others}} stood on the drop for about 10 seconds, and then Captain Rath clapped his hands. Four {{soldiers}} of Company F of the 14th Veteran Reserves knocked out the supports holding the drops in place, and the condemned fell. Surratt, who had moved forward enough to barely step onto the drop, lurched forward and slid partway down the drop, her body snapping tight at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rope,</b> swinging back and forth. Surratt's death {{appeared to be the}} easiest. Atzerodt's stomach heaved once and his legs quivered; then, he was still. Herold and Powell struggled for nearly five minutes, strangling to death.|$|E
25|$|After {{five days}} of {{climbing}} on a vertical rock offering very limited protection, Bonatti found himself stalled and faced with an impassable overhanging section. On the left and on the right the rock was absolutely smooth. Bonatti put together all the slings and small sections of ropes he had on him, attached one <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> in a crack and swinging {{on the other end}} managed to negotiate the difficulty. This route, known afterwards as the Bonatti Pillar, is considered still today {{as one of the greatest}} achievements in alpinism. In order to overcome long vertical sections and several overhangs, Bonatti had to adapt the techniques of aid climbing to the granitic rock formations of the Dru.|$|E
5000|$|The {{phrase in}} the bight (or on a bight) means a bight of line is itself {{being used to}} make a knot. Specifically this means that the knot can be formed without access to <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rope.</b> [...] This can be an {{important}} property for knots to be used in situations where <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> are inaccessible, such as forming a fixed loop in <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> a long climbing rope.|$|R

25|$|Inside Fort Caroline, La Vigne {{was keeping}} watch with his company, but taking pity on his sentinels, wet and {{fatigued}} {{with the heavy}} rain, he let them leave their stations with the approach of day, and finally he himself retired to his own quarters. With the break of day on September 20, the feast of St. Matthew, Menéndez was already alert. Before dawn he held a consultation with his captains, after which the entire party knelt down and prayed for a victory over their enemies. Then he {{set out for the}} fort over the narrow path which led to it from the woods. A French prisoner, Jean Francois, led the way, his hands bound behind him, and the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> held by Menéndez himself.|$|E
500|$|Eighth Fleet {{personnel}} {{devised a}} plan to help reduce the exposure of destroyers delivering supplies to Guadalcanal. [...] Large oil or gas drums were cleaned and filled with medical supplies and food, with enough air space to provide buoyancy, and strung together with rope. [...] When the destroyers arrived at Guadalcanal they would make a sharp turn, the drums would be cut loose, and a swimmer or boat from the shore could pick up the buoyed <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> {{and return it to}} the beach, where the soldiers could haul in the supplies.|$|E

[...] He said the United States must now pull back its troops from village areas and allow Afghan security forces {{to take the}} lead in an effort to reduce civilian deaths. On 16 March Karzai said the U.S. was not fully co-operating with a probe into the killings. He also said the problem of civilian casualties at the hands of NATO forces [...] "has been going on for too long ... It is by all means the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> here". A spokesperson for the Afghan Interior Ministry condemned the act [...] "in the strongest possible terms." ...|$|E

500|$|Calcraft was [...] "in great demand" [...] as an executioner {{elsewhere}} in the country as well, such as at Reading Gaol. During his tenure of office the Capital Punishment Amendment Act 1868 was passed, requiring that all executions must be conducted in private. Calcraft carried out the last public execution in Britain on 26 May 1868, when he hanged the Fenian Michael Barrett in front of Newgate Prison for his part in the Clerkenwell Outrage. Calcraft also carried out the first private execution in Britain under the new law. Eighteen-year-old Thomas Wells, who had been convicted of the murder of his superior Edward Walshe, the stationmaster at Dover Priory railway station, was hanged on 13 August 1868 in a former timber yard inside Maidstone Gaol. Members of the press were allowed to attend and reported that Wells, who wore his railway porter's uniform, did not die quickly, [...] "struggling on the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> for several minutes". Calcraft's final official duty was the hanging of James Godwin, on 25 May 1874.|$|E
500|$|For the {{convenience}} of other witnesses the commission moved to Hereford, where it resumed on 18 August 1307. The other six testifying to Cragh's execution included the hanged man himself, despite William de Briouze's stated belief that he had {{died of natural causes}} about two years earlier. The official language of the proceedings was ecclesiastical Latin, but Cragh spoke only Welsh, therefore two Franciscan friars from Hereford– John Young and Maurice of Pencoyd– were recruited as translators. Cragh is identified in the commission's records by his Welsh name, William ap Rhys, [...] "of the parish of Swansea in the diocese of Saint Davids". Of the eight other witnesses called, five testified in French and three in English. In his evidence Cragh stated that he believed himself to have been about 28 {{at the time of his}} hanging, and that his last conscious memory as he was dangling at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> was of the noise made by the crowd when Trahaern was hanged beside him. He denied his earlier story of having seen a vision of a white-clad bishop while he was hanging from the gallows, and instead claimed that the Virgin Mary had appeared to him on the morning of his execution, accompanied by [...] "a lordly figure" [...] she introduced as [...] "St Thomas", who she said would save him from the gallows. Under questioning Cragh said that he presumed the figure to be Cantilupe because he had been on pilgrimage to Cantilupe's shrine in Hereford, and because on the day of his imprisonment he had [...] "bent a penny ... to the honour of Saint Thomas so that he should liberate him". After hearing his testimony the commissioners physically examined Cragh, to confirm that he was indeed the man who had been hanged 18 years earlier. Although they found no marks around his neck they did discover some scarring on his tongue, according to Cragh caused by him having bitten it while hanging.|$|E

2500|$|Popular {{since the}} 16th century, the [...] "touradas à corda" [...] (literally bullfights-by-rope) {{are held by}} local Terceiran villagers from April/May to late September. In these events, similar to the Running of the Bulls, a bull is let loose from the town’s square (or other open space) with a very long rope around its neck. The other <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> are held by eight [...] "pastores", men dressed in {{traditional}} garb (white shirts, grey pants and a black hat), who control the animal from a distance (providing some sense of security). Courageous people then attempt to provoke the animal and get as close to it while avoiding being gored (resulting in the occasional injury or mayhem). Some [...] "touradas à [...] corda" [...] also {{do away with the}} rope entirely or become semi-aquatic (when the bulls chase the participants off a dock). Following these [...] "games" [...] the animal is eventually retrieved and a festival will begin.|$|E

2500|$|When allowed {{outside its}} pen, the bull {{typically}} {{was kept in}} a halter connected by a strap snapped into the ring in his nose for ease of control. In the bull pen, {{the use of a}} ring connected by a cable to a fixed point was recommended as a means of controlling and securing the bull while allowing a degree of movement by the subject bull. [...] If the pen was strong enough, the bull could be turned loose, and if needed, placed in a stanchion. Farmers who lacked an assistant, or a bull staff, {{had no choice but to}} adopt other means. [...] Some farmers elected to move their bulls by tying a rope to the ring and tying the other <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> to a farm tractor, providing both motive power and a degree of protection from the angry bull. [...] The efficacy of this technique is doubtful, and may depend on the size of the tractor and of the bull; one authority has [...] "seen a bull lift the front end of a tractor like a toy". [...] Others used dogs and horses. [...] Not all farmers could afford specially designed and manufactured bull handling products, which were not readily available until the 1980s. [...] The experimental improvisation of techniques for bull handling, as in many aspects of family farming, was a common practice.|$|E
