It tells {{whether a particular}} data set (say GDP, oil prices or stock prices) have increased or decreased over the period of time. A trend line could simply be drawn by eye {{through a set of}} data points, but more properly their position and slope is calculated using statistical techniques like linear regression.

25|$|The {{building}} {{was constructed in}} three sections to fulfill the established criteria. The first section, projecting outwards, had various workshops, cloakrooms and the foyer {{on the ground floor}} while upstairs it had a restaurant and a scenography studio. The second section housed the theatre proper. The boxes contained separate dressing rooms while the audience area was flat so that the hall could also be used as a ballroom. The third section, the stage, was designed in three sweeps with two lateral compartments large enough for backstage requirements. In his design for the horseshoe-shaped auditorium, Piermarini was inspired by the architecture of the Teatro di San Carlo in Naples but changed the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>curvature</b> so as to improve visibility and the acoustics. The acoustics were further enhanced by a number of subsequent modifications. For the ceiling, a finely decorated wooden facing served as a natural sounding board, ensuring almost perfect sound in every part of the hall. It was considered to be among the best of the times. Another little trick was to reduce significantly the size of the usually huge columns separating the various stages. For the hall's decor, Piermarini worked with prominent artists such as Giuseppe Levati and Giocondo Albertolli while also consulting the poet Giuseppe Parini. The theatre underwent many alterations during the Napoleonic period after which it lost its Neoclassical interiors as a result of work carried out by artists such as Francesco Hayez.|$|E

2500|$|The Inner Detector {{begins a}} few {{centimetres}} from the proton beam axis, extends to a radius of 1.2metres, and is 6.2 metres in length along the beam pipe.

[...] The magnetic field surrounding the entire inner detector causes charged particles to curve; {{the direction of the}} curve reveals a particle's charge and the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>curvature</b> reveals its momentum. [...] The starting points of the tracks yield useful information for identifying particles; for example, if a group of tracks seem to originate from a point other than the original proton–proton collision, this may be a sign that the particles came from the decay of a hadron with a bottom quark (see b-tagging). [...] The Inner Detector has three parts, which are explained below.|$|E

50|$|In the United States, the {{measurement}} of curvature is expressed in <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>curvature.</b> This is done by having a chord of 100 ft connecting to two points on an arc of the reference rail, then drawing radii from the center {{to each of the}} chord end points. The angle between the radii lines is the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>curvature.</b> The <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>curvature</b> is inverse of radius. The larger the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>curvature,</b> the sharper the curve is. Expressing the curve in this way allows surveyors to use estimation and simpler tools in curve measurement. This can be done by using a 62 ft string line to be a chord to connect the arc at the gauge side of the reference rail. Then at the midpoint of the string line (at the 31st foot), a measurement is taken from the string line to the gauge of the reference rail. The number of inches in that measurement is approximated to be the number of degrees of curvature.|$|E

It was conducted at the dental clinics of the Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, A log of file deformation or fracture during root canal preparation was kept. The location of fracture was noted along with {{the identity of the}} canal in which fracture took place. The fracture in the two rotary systems was compared. SPSS 20 was used for data analysis. Of the 172 (80. 4 %) teeth possessing more than 15 <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>curvature,</b> fracture occurred in 7 (4. 1 %) cases and deformation in 10 (5. 8 %). Of the 42 (19. 6 %) teeth possessing less than 15 <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>curvature,</b> fracture occurred in none of them while deformation was seen in 1 (2. 4 %). There was no difference in K- 3 and Protaper files with respect to file deformation and fracture. Most of the fractures occurred in mesiobuccal canals of maxillary molars, n= 3 (21. 4 %). The likelihood of file fracture increased 5. 65 -fold when the same file was used more than 3 times. Irrespective of the rotary system, apical third of the root canal space was the most common site for file fracture...|$|R
