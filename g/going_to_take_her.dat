500|$|In 1962, the Nixons {{embarked}} on another campaign, {{this time for}} Governor of California. Prior to Richard Nixon's announcement of his candidacy, Pat's brother Tom Ryan said, [...] "Pat {{told me that if}} Dick ran for governor she was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>her</b> shoe to him."

By then, she thought she was too old for basketball, although she would take it up again after she transferred to Buffalo Seminary, an all-girls college preparatory school, in her junior year. She ended up earning a place in the Buffalo Seminary's Athletic Hall of Fame.|$|E

50|$|Later Anna {{tries to}} {{have a talk with}} Giliap about {{feelings}}. She thinks he is mysterious, but Giliap claims that his secret is that he doesn't have any secrets.

6000|$|... 'Mrs. Merrifield was a {{wonderful}} old lady, brisk of mind and body, though of great age.

60|$|His veins fused {{with extreme}} voluptuousness. For {{a moment he}} almost lost control of himself, and {{continued}} automatically. But {{there was a moment}} of inaction, of cold suspension. He was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>her.</b> He drew her to him and soothed her, and caressed her. But the pure zest had gone. She struggled to herself and realized he was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>her.</b> And then, at the very last moment, when his fondling had come near again, his hot living desire despising her, against his cold sensual desire, she broke violently away from him.|$|E

60|$|Pierston retreated {{as quickly}} as he could.
