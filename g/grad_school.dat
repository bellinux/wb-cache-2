His unorthodox approach to applying for <b>grad</b> <b>school</b> included [...] "trying to get accepted at different graduate schools just by showing up on their doorstep." [...] Having unsuccessfully approached both the University of Oxford and Harvard University, Morris was able to talk his way into Princeton University, where he began studying the history of science, a topic in which he had [...] "absolutely no background." [...] His concentration was in the history of physics, and he was bored and unsuccessful in the prerequisite physics classes he had to take. This, together with his antagonistic relationship with his advisor Thomas Kuhn ('You won't even look through my telescope.' And his response was 'Errol, it's not a telescope, it's a kaleidoscope.') ensured that his stay at Princeton would be short.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} administrators’ and teachers’ perceptions regarding {{the impact of}} Project <b>GRAD</b> on <b>school</b> success in the Atlanta Public School systems Cohort I of <b>GRAD</b> <b>schools.</b> The major focus of the study addresses the perceptions of administrators and teachers in K- 8 schools Cohort I, which is comprised of 11 schools. These schools were identified to implement Project <b>GRAD,</b> a comprehensive <b>school</b> reform initiative, (Graduation Really Achieves Dreams) based on historical data reflecting poor academic achievement {{in each of the}} schools. The Comprehensive School Reform Teacher Questionnaire (CSRTZ), developed by Dr. S. M. Ross of the University of Memphis, was used to survey 57 administrators and 416 teachers. The survey questionnaire contained 28 items that were divided into six school success factors. Respondents used a 5 -point Likert scale to indicate their level of agreement to each item. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) was used to summarize the data collected in this study. The following statistical procedures were used: Frequency, Anova, Factor Analysis, and Multiple Regression. The findings were that administrators had a more positive perception of Project GRAD’S impact on school success than did teachers. Teachers were generally more neutral in their perceptions. An analysis of the findings led to the following conclusions that when the dependent variable of effective teaching strategies, professional learning communities, shared decision making, professional development, parental involvement, and shared vision interacted simultaneously with the moderating variable, gender, age, years of experience, and group membership, the administrator has a significant influence on predicting school success. Additionally, the data further indicates that there is some significant relationship between school success, group membership, and age...|$|R
