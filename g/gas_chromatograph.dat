25|$|Brazil burns {{significant}} amounts of ethanol biofuel. <b>Gas</b> <b>chromatograph</b> studies were performed of ambient air in São Paulo, Brazil, and compared to Osaka, Japan, which does not burn ethanol fuel. Atmospheric Formaldehyde was 160% higher in Brazil, and Acetaldehyde was 260% higher.|$|E
25|$|A common {{combination}} is gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS or GC-MS). In this technique, a <b>gas</b> <b>chromatograph</b> {{is used to}} separate different compounds. This stream of separated compounds is fed online into the ion source, a metallic filament to which voltage is applied. This filament emits electrons which ionize the compounds. The ions can then further fragment, yielding predictable patterns. Intact ions and fragments pass into the mass spectrometer's analyzer and are eventually detected.|$|E

50|$|The {{institute}} {{is equipped}} with well-equipped laboratories having facilities. The institute currently operates 60Co irradiation sources, <b>gas</b> <b>chromatographs,</b> Photo-documentation system, and atomic absorption.|$|R
5000|$|PEAK-11 {{provided}} further customization for {{use with}} <b>gas</b> <b>chromatographs</b> (analyzing the peaks produced by the GC); data collection ran in RT11's foreground process while the user's data analysis programs ran in the background.|$|R
25|$|Biofuels are {{different}} from fossil fuels in regard to greenhouse gases but are similar to fossil fuels in that biofuels contribute to air pollution. Burning produces airborne carbon particulates, carbon monoxide and nitrous oxides. The WHO estimates 3.7 million premature deaths worldwide in 2012 due to air pollution. Brazil burns significant amounts of ethanol biofuel. <b>Gas</b> <b>chromatograph</b> studies were performed of ambient air in São Paulo, Brazil, and compared to Osaka, Japan, which does not burn ethanol fuel. Atmospheric Formaldehyde was 160% higher in Brazil, and Acetaldehyde was 260% higher.|$|E
25|$|In a {{hydrogen}} breath test, {{the most accurate}} lactose intolerance test, after an overnight fast, 25 grams of lactose (in a solution with water) are swallowed. If the lactose cannot be digested, enteric bacteria metabolize it and produce hydrogen, which, along with methane, if produced, can be detected on the patient's breath by a clinical <b>gas</b> <b>chromatograph</b> or compact solid-state detector. The test takes about 2.5 hours to complete. If the hydrogen levels in the patient's breath are high, they may have lactose intolerance. This test is not usually done on babies and very young children, because it can cause severe diarrhea.|$|E
25|$|Antique or badly {{preserved}} perfumes undergoing {{this analysis}} {{can also be}} difficult due to the numerous degradation by-products and impurities that may have resulted from breakdown of the odorous compounds. Ingredients and compounds can usually be ruled out or identified using <b>gas</b> <b>chromatograph</b> (GC) smellers, which allow individual chemical components to be identified both through their physical properties and their scent. Reverse engineering of best-selling perfumes in the market is a very common practice in the fragrance industry due to the relative simplicity of operating GC equipment, the pressure to produce marketable fragrances, and the highly lucrative nature of the perfume market.|$|E
50|$|Optical isomers {{can have}} {{different}} detection thresholds because their conformations may {{cause them to}} be less perceivable for the human nose. It is only {{in recent years that}} such compounds were separated on <b>gas</b> <b>chromatographs.</b>|$|R
50|$|Agilent {{celebrates its}} 50th anniversary in the {{analytical}} instruments market. Hewlett-Packard Co., Agilent’s predecessor, acquired F&M Scientific Corp., maker of <b>gas</b> <b>chromatographs,</b> on Aug. 8, 1965. In September, {{the company announced}} it would acquire Seahorse Bioscience for $235 million.|$|R
50|$|The lab and its {{specialized}} equipment are independently accredited by international organizations to ISO 9001 and ISO Guide 25/17025. Primary {{facilities in the}} Forensic Analytical Center include <b>gas</b> <b>chromatographs,</b> Fourier transform spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, ion chromatograph, capillary zone electrophoresis, nuclear magnetic resonance and bio identification.|$|R
25|$|The {{number of}} various {{molecules}} in an oil sample {{can be determined}} by laboratory analysis. The molecules are typically extracted in a solvent, then separated in a <b>gas</b> <b>chromatograph,</b> and finally determined with a suitable detector, such as a flame ionization detector or a mass spectrometer. Due to {{the large number of}} co-eluted hydrocarbons within oil, many cannot be resolved by traditional gas chromatography and typically appear as a hump in the chromatogram. This unresolved complex mixture (UCM) of hydrocarbons is particularly apparent when analysing weathered oils and extracts from tissues of organisms exposed to oil. Some of the component of oil will mix with water: the water associated fraction of the oil.|$|E
25|$|British {{military}} helicopters {{flew over}} the crash site, pointing out large pieces of wreckage to the search parties. Private helicopters, equipped with thermographic cameras, were drafted in to survey the heavily wooded areas surrounding Lockerbie. Within hours of the crash, photographs of the area taken by a French satellite were delivered to the investigators. High-resolution photographs from spy satellites were also provided by the United States Department of Defense and National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Every item picked up was tagged, placed in a clear plastic bag, labelled and taken to the gymnasium of a local school, where everything was X-rayed and checked for explosive residue with a <b>gas</b> <b>chromatograph,</b> after which the information was entered into the Home Office Large Major Enquiry System.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{molecule}} has a hydroxyl (-OH) group, it is frequently bound to other lipids including fatty acids; most analytical methods, therefore, utilise a strong alkali (KOH or NaOH) to saponify the ester linkages. Typical extraction solvents include 6% KOH in methanol. The free sterols and stanols (saturated sterols) are then {{separated from the}} polar lipids by partitioning into a less polar solvent (e.g. hexane). Prior to analysis, the hydroxyl group is frequently derivatised with BSTFA (bis-trimethyl silyl trifluoroacetamide) to replace the hydrogen with the less exchangeable trimethylsilyl (TMS) group. Instrumental analysis is frequently conducted on <b>gas</b> <b>chromatograph</b> (GC) with either a flame ionisation detector (FID) or mass spectrometer (MS). The mass spectrum for 5β-coprostanol - TMS ether {{can be seen in}} the figure.|$|E
40|$|Use of {{vortex tube}} for cooling and {{concentric}} shielding have produced {{smaller and more}} compact unit than was previously available. Future uses of device could include installation in <b>gas</b> <b>chromatographs</b> and mass spectrometers. Additional uses would include measurements and controls in magnetohydrodynamic power generators and fusion reactors...|$|R
5000|$|Others {{recommend}} that the skill of dogs in detecting cancer would be more appropriately confined to labs, where <b>gas</b> <b>chromatographs</b> {{could be used to}} isolate which specific compounds the dogs identified. Recent developments include a simple breathalyser which changes colour according to the compounds in the breath, indicating the presence of cancer.|$|R
5000|$|Though {{its small}} in size, it easily fits into {{portable}} units, such as transferable <b>gas</b> <b>chromatographs</b> or drug/explosives sensors. For instance, it was incorporated by Varian in its CP-4900 DMD MicroGC, and by Thermo Fisher in its EGIS Defender system, designed to detect narcotics and explosives in transportation or other security applications.|$|R
25|$|This {{instrument}} is a versatile gas chemical analyzer {{that was designed}} to identify and measure chemicals in Titan's atmosphere. It was equipped with samplers that were filled at high altitude for analysis. The mass spectrometer, a high-voltage quadrupole, collected data to build a model of the molecular masses of each gas, and a more powerful separation of molecular and isotopic species was accomplished by the <b>gas</b> <b>chromatograph.</b> During descent, the GC/MS also analyzed pyrolysis products (i.e., samples altered by heating) passed to it from the Aerosol Collector Pyrolyser. Finally, the GC/MS measured the composition of Titan's surface. This investigation was made possible by heating the GC/MS instrument just prior to impact in order to vaporize the surface material upon contact. The GC/MS was developed by the Goddard Space Flight Center and University of Michigan's Space Physics Research Lab.|$|E
25|$|According to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) (2007), benzene {{is both an}} anthropogenically {{produced}} and naturally occurring chemical from processes that include: volcanic eruptions, wild fires, synthesis of chemicals such as phenol, production of synthetic fibers, and fabrication of rubbers, lubricants, pesticides, medications, and dyes. The major sources of benzene exposure are tobacco smoke, automobile service stations, exhaust from motor vehicles, and industrial emissions; however, ingestion and dermal absorption of benzene can also occur through contact with contaminated water. Benzene is hepatically metabolized and excreted in the urine. Measurement of air and water levels of benzene is accomplished through collection via activated charcoal tubes, which are then analyzed with a <b>gas</b> <b>chromatograph.</b> The measurement of benzene in humans can be accomplished via urine, blood, and breath tests; however, all of these have their limitations because benzene is rapidly metabolized in the human body.|$|E
25|$|These two components, used together, allow a much finer {{degree of}} {{substance}} identification than either unit used separately. It {{is not possible}} to make an accurate identification of a particular molecule by gas chromatography or mass spectrometry alone. The mass spectrometry process normally requires a very pure sample while gas chromatography using a traditional detector (e.g. Flame ionization detector) cannot differentiate between multiple molecules that happen to take {{the same amount of time}} to travel through the column (i.e. have the same retention time), which results in two or more molecules that co-elute. Sometimes two different molecules can also have a similar pattern of ionized fragments in a mass spectrometer (mass spectrum). Combining the two processes reduces the possibility of error, as it is extremely unlikely that two different molecules will behave in the same way in both a <b>gas</b> <b>chromatograph</b> and a mass spectrometer. Therefore, when an identifying mass spectrum appears at a characteristic retention time in a GC-MS analysis, it typically increases certainty that the analyte of interest is in the sample.|$|E
50|$|Flow {{computers}} are available as completely programmable devices {{using a variety}} of software tools or as configurable devices using manufacturer's specific configuration software packages to set up interfaces to <b>gas</b> <b>chromatographs,</b> <b>gas</b> ultrasonic meters, liquid provers, flow control valves, PLC, DCS, SCADA and industry-recognized HMI supervisory systems. Modbus/TCP is a standard offering via Ethernet interfaces from some flow computers, although other communications protocols, such as OLE are supported by some flow computers. Security issues are very significant in SCADA system development using flow computers.|$|R
30|$|In {{the case}} of amines (especially TMA), it should be {{considered}} that high-concentration TMA liquefies at room temperature and this transition {{makes it difficult to}} be sensed using existing sensors or <b>gas</b> <b>chromatographs.</b> Moreover and as revealed in chromatograms, the TMA peak may overlap with a wide peak of humidity. This requires effective removal of humidity before injection.|$|R
40|$|Gas-chromatographic {{apparatus}} measures small {{concentrations of}} water in specimens of Freon PCA. Testing by use of apparatus faster and provides greater protection against accidental contamination of specimens by water in testing environment. Automated for unattended operation. Also used to measure water contents of materials, other than Freon PCA. Innovation extended to development of purgeable sampling accessory for <b>gas</b> <b>chromatographs...</b>|$|R
500|$|Advancements in {{the field}} of {{chromatography}} arrived in 1953 with the invention of the <b>gas</b> <b>chromatograph</b> by Anthony T. James and Archer John Porter Martin, allowing for the separation of volatile liquid mixtures with components which have similar boiling points. [...] Nonvolatile liquid mixtures could be separated with liquid chromatography, but substances with similar retention times could not be resolved until the invention of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) by Csaba Horváth in 1970. [...] Modern HPLC instruments are capable of detecting and resolving substances whose concentrations are as low as parts per trillion.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} advancements in forensic chemistry came in 1955 with the invention of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) by Fred McLafferty and Roland Gohlke. [...] The coupling of a <b>gas</b> <b>chromatograph</b> with a mass spectrometer allowed for the identification {{of a wide range of}} substances. [...] GC-MS analysis is widely considered the [...] "gold standard" [...] for forensic analysis due to its sensitivity and versatility along with its ability to quantify the amount of substance present. The increase in the sensitivity of instrumentation has advanced to the point that minute impurities within compounds can be detected potentially allowing investigators to trace chemicals to a specific batch and lot from a manufacturer.|$|E
2500|$|The GC-MS is {{composed}} of two major building blocks: the <b>gas</b> <b>chromatograph</b> and the mass spectrometer. The <b>gas</b> <b>chromatograph</b> utilizes a capillary column which depends on the column's dimensions (length, diameter, film thickness) {{as well as the}} phase properties (e.g. 5% phenyl polysiloxane). [...] The difference in the chemical properties between different molecules in a mixture and their relative affinity for the stationary phase of the column will promote separation of the molecules as the sample travels the length of the column. The molecules are retained by the column and then elute (come off) from the column at different times (called the retention time), and this allows the mass spectrometer downstream to capture, ionize, accelerate, deflect, and detect the ionized molecules separately. The mass spectrometer does this by breaking each molecule into ionized fragments and detecting these fragments using their mass-to-charge ratio.|$|E
40|$|The {{review of}} new models of {{scientific}} instruments manufactured by Japanese corporation SHIMADZU has been made. Lliquid and <b>gas</b> <b>chromatographs,</b> mass spectrometers, LCMS and GCMS, IR range spectrophotometer, energy dispersive X-ray spectrometers, particle size analyzer, micro hardness tester have been considered.

40|$|Programmed Temperature Vaporizers (PTVs) {{provide new}} sample {{introduction}} techniques for <b>gas</b> <b>chromatographs</b> such as solvent split injection and cold split injection. Solvent split injection allows injection of larger sample volumes {{than the standard}} injection techniques. 1 µl cold splitless injection and 100 µl solvent split injection using the OPTIC PTV are evaluated for linearity, thermal degradation and sensitivity...|$|R
40|$|The Gas Analysis and Testing Laboratory is an {{integral}} part of the testing performed at the NASA Johnson Space Center. The Gas Analysis and Testing Laboratory is a high performance laboratory providing real time analytical instruments to support manned and unmanned testing. The lab utilizes precision <b>gas</b> <b>chromatographs,</b> <b>gas</b> analyzers and spectrophotometers to support the technology development programs within the NASA community. The Gas Analysis and Testing Laboratory works with a wide variety of customers and provides engineering support for user-specified applications in compressed gas, chemical analysis, general and research laborator...|$|R
2500|$|The {{most common}} type of mass {{spectrometer}} (MS) associated with a <b>gas</b> <b>chromatograph</b> (GC) is the quadrupole mass spectrometer, sometimes referred to by the Hewlett-Packard (now Agilent) trade name [...] "Mass Selective Detector" [...] (MSD). [...] Another relatively common detector is the ion trap mass spectrometer. [...] Additionally one may find a magnetic sector mass spectrometer, however these particular instruments are expensive and bulky and not typically found in high-throughput service laboratories. [...] Other detectors may be encountered such as time of flight (TOF), tandem quadrupoles (MS-MS) (see below), {{or in the case of}} an ion trap MSn where n indicates the number mass spectrometry stages.|$|E
2500|$|NASA is also {{assessing}} {{the release of}} an additional [...] probe called Biosignature Explorer for Europa (BEE), that would be equipped with a basic bi-propellant engine and cold gas thrusters to be more agile and responsive to the episodic activity on Europa and sample and analyze the water plumes for biosignatures and life evidence before they are destroyed by radiation. The BEE plume probe would be equipped with a proven mass spectrometer combined with <b>gas</b> <b>chromatograph</b> separation. It would also carry a UV plume targeting camera as well as visible and IR cameras to image the active region with better resolution than the Clipper mother ship instruments. The BEE probe would fly through at 2–10km altitude, then make a quick exit and perform its analysis far from the radiation belts.|$|E
2500|$|The lander carried {{instruments}} {{to achieve the}} primary scientific objectives of the lander mission: to study the biology, chemical composition (organic and inorganic), meteorology, seismology, magnetic properties, appearance, and physical properties of the Martian surface and atmosphere. Two 360-degree cylindrical scan cameras were mounted near one long side of the base. From {{the center of this}} side extended the sampler arm, with a collector head, temperature sensor, and magnet on the end. A meteorology boom, holding temperature, wind direction, and wind velocity sensors extended out and up from the top of one of the lander legs.

50|$|Matheson Gas Products {{was founded}} in 1927 in North Bergen, New Jersey, by Adam Matheson. By virtue of the {{founding}} of his company, Adam Matheson created the specialty gas business. Among Matheson's more notable accomplishments are the development of the lecture bottle, now used by virtually every major college and university in the world; and the supply of ultra pure gases that served as standards for the first <b>gas</b> <b>chromatographs.</b>|$|R
50|$|HP Jetdirect {{was first}} {{introduced}} in March 1991 (code named QuickSilver) with the LaserJet IIIsi network printer (code named Eli). Jetdirect is based on HP's MIO (Modular Input/Output) interface, which was designed {{from the ground up}} with the IIIsi to create a mainstream full function high performance networked printer. The initial MIO interface card had Ethernet and Token Ring physical layer variants and used various networking protocols over an AUI/BNC connection. Initially, a printer needed a separate card for each protocol, such as TCP/IP, IPX/SPX, AppleTalk, or DLC/LLC. The following year the team applied the technology to the legacy accessory slot on the LaserJetIIs and IIIs XIO (Extended Input/Output). MIO type Jetdirect cards were also used for network connectivity on some HP/Agilent laboratory equipment such as the 6890A and 6890 Plus series of <b>gas</b> <b>chromatographs.</b> These included unusual network connection types such as HPs I-Net which was used as an interconnect between various pieces of hardware that controlled the 58xx and 68xx series <b>gas</b> <b>chromatographs.</b> Not until 1994 would MIO interface cards be released that could support more than one protocol per card.|$|R
