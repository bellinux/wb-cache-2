Not just sexual, I just mean whatever—open your mouth. That's empowering to me. That's what the song is about." [...] In an interview with Perez Hilton, Hilson said that she cannot allow other people or the media to dictate what she can and what cannot do. She also dismissed the negative reviews, because she knew some women were [...] "empowered" [...] by its message. She added that listeners have to be fearless and stand for what they believe in and concluded by saying that [...] "The Way You Love Me" [...] is not meant for children.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, {{producer}} David Heyman asked Radcliffe {{to audition}} {{for the role of}} Harry Potter for the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, the best-selling book by British author J.

Eight months later, and after several auditions, Radcliffe was selected to play the part. Rowling also endorsed the selection saying, [...] "I don't think Chris Columbus could have found a better Harry." [...] Radcliffe's parents originally turned down the offer, as they had been told that it would involve six films shot in Los Angeles. Warner Bros. instead offered Radcliffe a two-movie contract with shooting in the UK; Radcliffe was unsure at the time if he would do any more than that.|$|E

The single was a hard-hitting, streetwise b-boy song with spare beats and ballistic rhymes. Smith later discussed his search for a label, stating [...] "I sent my demo to many different companies, but it was Def Jam where I found my home." [...] That same year, Smith made his professional debut concert performance at Manhattan Center High School. In a later interview, LL Cool J recalled the experience, stating [...] "They pushed the lunch room tables together and me and my DJ, Cut Creator, started playing.... As soon as it was over there were girls screaming and asking for autographs. Right then and there I said 'This <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to do'." [...] LL's debut single sold over 100,000 copies and helped establish both Def Jam as a label and Smith as a rapper. The commercial success of [...] "I Need a Beat", along with the Beastie Boys' single [...] "Rock Hard" [...] (1984), helped lead Def Jam to a distribution deal with Columbia Records the following year.|$|E
500|$|Endorsed by meat {{production}} company Oscar Mayer, [...] "Sisters at Heart" [...] is a half-hour, color episode that aired on December 24, 1970, as the 213th episode of Bewitched to be aired. As an introduction and conclusion to the episode, Montgomery briefly {{spoke to the}} camera about the episode, saying that it [...] "was created in the true spirit of Christmas ... conceived {{in the image of}} innocence and filled with truth." [...] ABC aired the episode only once more, in December 1971. Unlike many of the other episodes in the season, it was neither a remake of an episode from a previous season nor part of the Salem, Massachusetts, story arc that was filmed in the area where the 17th-century Salem witch trials took place. Don Marshall, who made a guest appearance in [...] "Sisters at Heart" [...] as Keith Wilson, was known for his role in Land of the Giants, while Janee Michelle, who portrayed Dorothy Wilson in [...] "Sisters at Heart", later became best known for her role in the 1974 horror film The House on Skull Mountain.

Reflecting on the episode in 1989, she said, [...] "Yeah, this <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> Bewitched to be all about." [...] Sony Pictures Home Entertainment eventually released the episode on a VHS collection called A Bewitched Christmas 2.

[...] Isabella adds, [...] "Now that was interesting to Mother." [...] She was also persuaded that Golda was a [...] "grand-scale person," [...] one that people would assume was much taller than she actually was.

[...] NME commented on Slade's legacy in a review of a greatest hits album, [...] "They embodied the glorious absurdity of the greatest pop, in the sideburns, the mirrored top hat and Dave Hill's pudding bowl haircut.

Fenty said he would take his uncompromising style to the mayor's office, and cited with approval, Margaret Thatcher's saying that, [...] "Consensus is the absence of leadership". Cropp stressed her 25 years of experience in city government and her desire to continue the progress made by Anthony Williams, who endorsed her candidacy.
