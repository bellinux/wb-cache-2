5|$|Danny K. Davis {{running for}} Chicago mayor in the Democratic primary {{scheduled}} for February 26, 1991, made police brutality and <b>excessive</b> <b>force</b> {{an issue in}} the campaign. He sought an independent citizens' review of the police department. On January 28, 1991, Amnesty International called for an investigation into police torture in Chicago. After Mayor of Chicago Richard M. Daley seemed reluctant to initiate an investigation, his opponent Davis questioned whether there was a police and city coverup. Eventually, after pressure by citizens' organizations and anti-brutality organizations, the police department resumed an internal investigation.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Preckwinkle pursued {{disclosure}} of Chicago Police Department officers who used <b>excessive</b> <b>force.</b> The United States District Court had {{ruled that the}} records be unsealed and {{made available to the}} public. However, on July 13, 2007, the city filed an emergency motion to stay the judge's order. When the city argued in the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals to against disclosure, it made the point that aldermen would have access to the information. Preckwinkle's August 23, 2007, request for disclosure was denied.|$|E
5|$|Nigeria's {{human rights}} record remains poor; {{according}} to the US Department of State, the most significant human rights problems are: use of <b>excessive</b> <b>force</b> by security forces; impunity for abuses by security forces; arbitrary arrests; prolonged pretrial detention; judicial corruption and executive influence on the judiciary; rape, torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment of prisoners, detainees and suspects; harsh and life‑threatening prison and detention centre conditions; human trafficking {{for the purpose of}} prostitution and forced labour; societal violence and vigilante killings; child labour, child abuse and child sexual exploitation; domestic violence; discrimination based on ethnicity, region and religion.|$|E

5|$|Preckwinkle {{had been}} an {{occasional}} critic of former Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley. In her first four terms in office she emerged as the council's prominent defender of affordable housing. Among other issues, she is known for championing the controversial sweetened beverage tax, her sponsorship of living wage ordinances, her expressed concerns regarding {{the costs and benefits}} of the city's Olympic bid, and her strong stance against police brutality and <b>excessive</b> <b>force.</b>|$|E
5|$|Spokane and the Spokane Police Department (SPD) have {{received}} national publicity and scrutiny in the 2000s and 2010s due to many officer-involved shootings and allegations of <b>excessive</b> <b>force.</b> The most high-profile of these incidents was the 2006 death of Otto Zehm, a mentally challenged {{man who was}} initially suspected of theft at a convenience store. Zehm was later found to have committed no crime, but was struck with batons by several officers and tasered. The increased pressure on the SPD prompted an independent review by a commission of the organization's use-of-force policies, an internal culture audit, and the purchase of body cameras.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we study}} <b>excessive</b> {{internal}} <b>forces</b> applied to manipulated objects in robotic contact tasks. Such internal forces may cause serious {{damage to the}} objects and/or robots; thus, prior assessment {{of the possibility of}} <b>excessive</b> internal <b>forces</b> is very important. We propose a method to judge the possibility of <b>excessive</b> internal <b>forces</b> on manipulated objects. The judgment is based on rigid-body mechanics with Coulomb friction and given by solving a series of linear programming problems. We show some numerical examples of the judgment by our proposed method...|$|R
50|$|Regardless of the cause, astronauts {{may be at}} an {{increased}} risk of intervertebral disc injury or damage when the swollen discs are subjected to <b>excessive</b> <b>forces</b> or torques while working on planetary surfaces. Exploration missions on planetary surfaces may also introduce habitability issues that could induce excessive torsional stress, an established risk factor for herniation of anulus fibrosus.|$|R
5|$|The dies are {{designed}} so that the finished casting will slide off the cover half of the die {{and stay in the}} ejector half as the dies are opened. This assures that the casting will be ejected every cycle because the ejector half contains the ejector pins to push the casting out of that die half. The ejector pins are driven by an ejector pin plate, which accurately drives all of the pins {{at the same time and}} with the same force, so that the casting is not damaged. The ejector pin plate also retracts the pins after ejecting the casting to prepare for the next shot. There must be enough ejector pins to keep the overall force on each pin low, because the casting is still hot and can be damaged by <b>excessive</b> <b>force.</b> The pins still leave a mark, so they must be located in places where these marks will not hamper the casting's purpose.|$|E
5|$|Tooth {{destruction}} from processes {{other than}} dental caries {{is considered a}} normal physiologic process but may become severe enough to become a pathologic condition. Attrition {{is the loss of}} tooth structure by mechanical forces from opposing teeth. Attrition initially affects the enamel and, if unchecked, may proceed to the underlying dentin. Abrasion is the loss of tooth structure by mechanical forces from a foreign element. If this force begins at the cementoenamel junction, then progression of tooth loss can be rapid since enamel is very thin in this region of the tooth. A common source of this type of tooth wear is <b>excessive</b> <b>force</b> when using a toothbrush. Erosion is the loss of tooth structure due to chemical dissolution by acids not of bacterial origin. Signs of tooth destruction from erosion is a common characteristic in the mouths of people with bulimia since vomiting results in exposure of the teeth to gastric acids. Another important source of erosive acids are from frequent sucking of lemon juice. Abfraction is the loss of tooth structure from flexural forces. As teeth flex under pressure, the arrangement of teeth touching each other, known as occlusion, causes tension {{on one side of the}} tooth and compression on the other side of the tooth. This is believed to cause V-shaped depressions on the side under tension and C-shaped depressions on the side under compression. When tooth destruction occurs at the roots of teeth, the process is referred to as internal resorption, when caused by cells within the pulp, or external resorption, when caused by cells in the periodontal ligament.|$|E

50|$|These menisci act to {{distribute}} body weight across the knee joint. Without the menisci, {{the weight of}} the body would be unevenly applied to the bones in the legs (the femur and tibia). This uneven weight distribution would cause the development of abnormal <b>excessive</b> <b>forces</b> leading to early damage of the knee joint. The menisci also contribute to the stability of the joint.|$|R

25|$|Dry socket is {{more likely}} to occur {{following}} a difficult tooth extraction. It is thought that <b>excessive</b> <b>force</b> applied to the tooth, or excessive movement of the tooth burnishes the bony walls of the socket and crushes blood vessels, impairing the repair process. It has also been shown that dry socket {{is more likely}} to occur when an inexperienced surgeon performed the extraction, possibly because <b>excessive</b> <b>force</b> or excessive tooth movements are used.|$|E
25|$|In July 2011, the UN investigative {{committee}} {{said that the}} Israeli naval blockade of Gaza was legal, but that Israel used <b>excessive</b> <b>force</b> and should have waited to enforce the blockade closer to the shoreline.

In September 2011, the UN stated that Israel used <b>excessive</b> <b>force</b> and boarded the flotilla when it was far away from the blockade zone.|$|E
50|$|Vertical root {{fracture}} is {{more likely}} where teeth have undergone extensive prior treatment. It is thought that excessive removal of dentine during procedures such as root canal treatment weakens the tooth. For this reason excessive canal shaping should be avoided. Fracturing {{may be caused by}} <b>excessive</b> <b>forces</b> placed on the tooth, such as during compaction of gutta-percha during the obturation phase of endodontics. Trauma can also cause crack formation.|$|R

40|$|A multifacted {{approach}} to the imaging of biological structures by scanning force microscopy is described. The major problems addressed are the distortion of biological samples by <b>excessive</b> <b>forces</b> applied by the cantilever stylus and sample motion relative to the imaging substrate. The first two chapters discuss the design of digital signal processor based scanning force microscope control electronics and a novel microscope head that eliminates the application of <b>excessive</b> <b>forces</b> to the sample caused by electronic or vibrational noise. The third chapter presents a novel use of chemical vapor deposition for application of heterofunctional alkoxysilanes to scanning force microscopy imaging subsrates. This technique provides imaging substrates which have chemical groups {{that can be used}} for sample immobilization without compromising substrate smoothness. The use of the chemically derivatized substrates for scanning force microscopy is also explored. The final chapter presents high resolution images of bovine liver catalase micro-crystals. The images of the protein micro-crystals show resolution on the order of 2 to 3 nanometers allowing the visualization of individual catalase tetramers. To our knowledge this is the first report of images of protein micro-crystals taken by scanning force microscopy which have resolution comparable to that of electron microscopy. ...|$|R
