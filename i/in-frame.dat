5|$|The genome of HBV {{is made of}} {{circular}} DNA, but it {{is unusual}} because the DNA is not fully double-stranded. One end of the full length strand {{is linked to the}} viral DNA polymerase. The genome is 3020–3320 nucleotides long (for the full-length strand) and 1700–2800 nucleotides long (for the short length-strand). The negative-sense (non-coding) is complementary to the viral mRNA. The viral DNA is found in the nucleus soon after infection of the cell. The partially double-stranded DNA is rendered fully double-stranded by completion of the (+) sense strand and removal of a protein molecule from the (−) sense strand and a short sequence of RNA from the (+) sense strand. Non-coding bases are removed from the ends of the (−) sense strand and the ends are rejoined. There are four known genes encoded by the genome, called C, X, P, and S. The core protein is coded for by gene C (HBcAg), and its start codon is preceded by an upstream <b>in-frame</b> AUG start codon from which the pre-core protein is produced. HBeAg is produced by proteolytic processing of the pre-core protein. In some rare strains of the virus known as Hepatitis B virus precore mutants, no HBeAg is present.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} mainly shot on Kodak Vision3 250D film stock. Scenes where Oscar is alive were {{shot in the}} super 35 format with Arricam LT cameras, and the rest in super 16 with an Aaton XTR Prod. The cinematographer was Benoît Debie, who also shot Irréversible. As in Irréversible, Noé was {{reluctant}} to use artificial lighting that would destroy the illusion if the camera was turned around. Thanks to Tokyo's many neon signs, very little additional lighting was required for the exterior scenes, {{despite the fact that}} many were shot late at night. For the interior scenes Debie mainly used practical, <b>in-frame</b> light sources. Some exceptions were made. One was that the moods of the characters were meant to be indicated by different colours, ranging from orange to purple with occasional greens. For this, Debie used a set of red, green, and blue programmable disco lights, which allowed for all different hues. The disco lights were easy to hide. They were also used for simulation of neon flashes, and to add a tint of red to the dressing-room scenes. Another exception was the use of strobe lights, which were programmed together with the coloured lights. Blue colour was avoided throughout, since the filmmakers did not associate it with dreams. Noé was the film's camera operator, except for a few shots of Oscar running in the streets, as they required a taller cameraman. In those scenes, the camera was held by Debie.|$|E
25|$|As {{engine power}} increased, frame {{ruptures}} became increasingly common, and by 1903 Minerva had developed an <b>in-frame</b> design {{with the engine}} mounted above the bottom bracket, while still also offering the clip-on kit. From 1904 Minerva began focusing more on car production, and while development and production of the Minerva motorized bicycles continued through to about 1909, they became increasing a less {{significant part of the}} company.|$|E
25|$|While {{details of}} the trans-translation {{mechanism}} are under investigation it is generally agreed that tmRNA first occupies the empty A site of the stalled ribosome. Subsequently, the ribosome moves from the 3' end of the truncated messenger RNA onto the resume codon of the MLR, followed by a slippage-prone stage from where translation continues normally until the <b>in-frame</b> tmRNA stop codon is encountered. Trans-translation is essential in some bacterial species, whereas other bacteria require tmRNA to survive when subjected to stressful growth conditions. Depending on the organism, the tag peptide may be recognized {{by a variety of}} proteases or protease adapters.|$|E
2500|$|In contrast, any {{insertion}} or deletion that is evenly divisible {{by three}} is termed an <b>in-frame</b> mutation.|$|E
2500|$|The primary {{translation}} {{product of}} SFRP1 contains an atypical signaling sequence, where {{a chain of}} 15 hydrophilic amino acids precede the hydrophobic domain. [...] Looking at 7 tumors without the truncating mutation, the retained SFRP1 allele contained an <b>in-frame</b> three-base insertion after nucleotide 37. [...] This is thought to lead to an extra alanine in the protein after codon 13. [...] However, no significant association {{was found between the}} development of colorectal cancer and the presence of the 3-bp insertion.|$|E
2500|$|Three out of 10 {{advanced}} colorectal tumors had mutations {{leading to}} premature {{termination of the}} SFRP1 translation product. [...] The mutations were two single-base deletions (26delG and 67delG) and a single-base change (G450A), which generates an <b>in-frame</b> stop codon. [...] These three mutations were found within the first exon, which was shown previously to be sufficient for Wnt antagonist activity by itself [...] [...] Of the 10 tumors analyzed, no truncating mutations {{were found in the}} second or third exons of SFRP1.|$|E
2500|$|While the {{structure}} of oxytocin is highly conserved in placental mammals, a novel structure of oxytocin was recently reported in marmosets, tamarins, and other new world primates. Genomic sequencing of the gene for oxytocin revealed a single <b>in-frame</b> mutation (thymine for cytosine) which results in a single amino acid substitution at the 8-position (proline for leucine). Since this original Lee et al. paper, two other laboratories have confirmed Pro8-OT and documented additional oxytocin structural variants in this primate taxon. Vargas-Pinilla et al. sequenced the coding regions of the OXT gene in other genera in new world primates and identified the following variants in addition to Leu8- and Pro8-OT: Ala8-OT, Thr8-OT, and Val3/Pro8-OT. Ren et al. identified a [...] variant further, Phe2-OT in howler monkeys.|$|E
2500|$|Males with an ABCD1 {{mutation}} are hemizygous, as {{they only}} have a single X chromosome. Female carriers will typically avoid the most severe manifestations of the disease, but often become symptomatic later in life. Although, the detection of an ABCD1 mutation identifies an individual who is affected with a form of ALD, there is no genotype - phenotype correlation. Within a family, there will often be several different phenotypes, {{despite the presence of}} the same causative mutation. In one case, a family with six affected members displayed five different phenotypes. There are no common mutations that cause ALD, most are private or familial. [...] Almost 600 different mutations have been identified, approximately half are missense mutations, one quarter are frameshifts, with <b>in-frame</b> deletions and splicing defects making up the remainder. The incidence of new mutations in ALD (those occurring spontaneously, rather than being inherited from a carrier parent) is estimated at approximately 4.1%, with the possibility that these are due to germline mosaicism.|$|E
50|$|The goal of exon {{skipping}} is {{to manipulate}} the splicing pattern so that an out-of-frame mutation becomes an <b>in-frame</b> mutation, thus changing a severe DMD mutation into a less harmful <b>in-frame</b> BMD mutation.|$|E
50|$|Three {{transcript}} variants {{have been}} identified. Isoform 1 {{is the longest}} transcript and encodes the longest isoform. Isoform 2 uses an alternate <b>in-frame</b> splice site and is shorter than isoform 1. Isoform 3 lacks an alternate <b>in-frame</b> exon and is shorter compared to isoform 1.There are six stem loops in the 5' untranslated region and five stem loops in the 3' untranslated region.|$|E
5000|$|In contrast, any {{insertion}} or deletion that is evenly divisible {{by three}} is termed an <b>in-frame</b> mutation ...|$|E
50|$|EVI5L has two isoforms {{produced}} by alternative splicing. Isoform 2 is missing <b>in-frame</b> exon 11, making it shorter (794 amino acids).|$|E
50|$|An {{upstream}} <b>in-frame</b> {{stop codon}} is {{found within the}} 5' UTR. RNF113A is an intronless gene with one isoform in humans.|$|E
50|$|There is one known isoform of TMEM156. This {{particular}} isoform uses {{an alternate}} <b>in-frame</b> splice {{site in the}} 3' coding region. The resulting isoform is shorter than the original.|$|E
50|$|In some cancer cell lines, this protein {{has been}} found to be fused with {{estrogen}} receptor alpha (ER-alpha), in which the N-terminus of FAS is fused <b>in-frame</b> with the C-terminus of ER-alpha.|$|E
50|$|There {{are five}} {{different}} transcript variants for the TTC39B gene. Isoform 1 {{is the longest}} transcript and encodes the longest isoform. Isoform 2 uses an alternate <b>in-frame</b> splice site in the central coding region, compared to variant 1, which results in a shorter protein. Isoform 3 and 4 have multiple differences in the central coding region but maintain the reading frame compared to isoform 1. Isoform 5 differs in the 5' UTR and has multiple coding region differences, compared to variant 1. These differences cause translation initiation at an <b>in-frame</b> downstream AUG and results in isoform 5 having a shorter N-terminus compared to isoform 1.|$|E
50|$|The EVI1 gene {{is located}} in the human genome on {{chromosome}} 3 (3q26.2). The gene spans 60 kilobases and encodes 16 exons, 10 of which are protein-coding. The first <b>in-frame</b> ATG start codon is in exon 3.|$|E
50|$|In humans, {{there are}} five {{transcript}} variants encoded by TMEM143 gene (1-5). Variant 1 is the longest mRNA transcript, with a coding region of 2577 nucleotides (nt) {{and a total of}} 8 exons, and possibly most indicative of function. Compared to variant 1, variant 2 (2472 nt, 424 amino acid protein) and variant 3 (2382nt, 394 amino acid protein) lack an <b>in-frame</b> exon in the 5' coding region while variant 4 (2277 nt, 359 amino acid protein) lacks two <b>in-frame</b> exons in the 5’ coding region, all leading to an N-terminally truncated protein. Transcript variant 5 is a non-coding RNA, approximately 2231 nt long, resulting in a transcript candidate for nonsense-mediated mRNA.|$|E
50|$|The {{promotor}} {{region is}} predicted to be 1101 base pairs in length. The transcriptional start site found in this region is located 119 bp upstream of the start codon {{as well as an}} <b>in-frame</b> stop codon at 1087 bp to 1089 bp.|$|E
5000|$|C1orf74 is {{transcribed}} into an mRNA that is 1642 nucleotides long in humans. [...] The transcript {{contains two}} exons and one upstream <b>in-frame</b> stop codon. The 5' UTR of this transcript is 343 nucleotides {{long and the}} 3' UTR is 570 nucleotides long.|$|E
50|$|Four {{alternatively}} spliced transcript variants encoding {{two distinct}} isoforms have been observed. There is also evidence for alternative translation initiation from non-AUG (CUG and GUG) start sites, <b>in-frame</b> and downstream of the initiator AUG codon, to {{give rise to}} nuclear forms of this hormone.|$|E
50|$|Senapathy {{conducted}} genomics and bioinformatics studies {{based on}} the idea that prebiotic genetic sequences must have had random characteristics. He had observed that the reading-frame lengths in a random nucleotide sequence follow an exponential distribution, which is exactly found in eukaryotic genome sequences, and suggested the split-gene model. In this model, a selective pressure existed in the most primitive unicellular eukaryotes to generate longer coding sequences from random DNA sequences that were populated with <b>in-frame</b> nonsense codons, and intervened between short reading frames, started to be excised by an already existing spliceosome. This model proposes not only that the sequences excised contained random clusters of <b>in-frame</b> nonsense codons but also that the splice junction signal sequences and the branch point sequence originate from nonsense codons.|$|E
50|$|Two coding variants, G1 and G2, {{have been}} {{recently}} identified with relevance to human phenotypes. The G1 {{is a pair}} of two non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in almost complete linkage disequilibrium. G2 is an <b>in-frame</b> deletion of the two amino acid residues, N388 and Y389.|$|E
50|$|CCDC113 {{is located}} on {{chromosome}} 16q21 and encodes two distinct isoforms with isoform 2 containing one less alternate <b>in-frame</b> exon compared to the full length protein, isoform 1. Isoform 1 is composed of 5304 base pairs of mRNA which form the 9 exons {{that make up the}} coding sequence.|$|E
50|$|This gene is 48,880 {{bases in}} length and is 3,360 base pairs in length after {{transcription}} to mRNA. PROSER2 has 5 splice variants, 3 of which are alternatively spliced and 2 of which are unspliced forms. It contains an upstream <b>in-frame</b> stop codon and a 2,000 bp promoter.|$|E
50|$|The notable {{features}} of the mRNA sequence include two polyadenylation signals in the 3' untranslated region (UTR), {{and it is the}} target of several RNA-binding proteins (RBP) including RBP-MBNL1 in the 5' UTR. A single intron splice site exists in the primary transcript, as does an upstream <b>in-frame</b> stop codon.|$|E
50|$|The {{mammalian}} DNA {{does not}} come with these restriction sites, so they are built in by overlap extension PCR. The primers are designed to put the restriction sites carefully, so that the coding of the protein is <b>in-frame,</b> and a minimum of extra amino acids is implanted {{on either side of}} the protein.|$|E
50|$|The untranslated regions (UTR) {{flanking}} the coding sequence of BEND2 at the 5' and 3' {{end of the}} mature mRNA molecule contain sites for RNA-binding proteins, including RBMX, pum2, and EIF4B as well as microRNA binding sites. The 5'UTR also contains an upstream <b>in-frame</b> stop codon and the 3'UTR contains a polyadenylation signal sequence.|$|E
50|$|The filter itself uses {{augmented}} reality (AR) technology {{to display a}} 3-D rendering of an anthropomorphic hot dog. The hot dog is shown in a bun, wearing headphones and enjoying music. Due to the filter's usage of AR technology, the hot dog will affix itself to <b>in-frame</b> real world objects and move along with them.|$|E
50|$|Synovial sarcomas occur most {{frequently}} in the extremities around large joints. More than 90% of cases have a recurrent and specific chromosomal translocation, t(X;18)(p11.2;q11.2), in which the 5-prime end of the SS18 gene is fused <b>in-frame</b> to the 3-prime end of the SSX1, SSX2, or SSX4 gene. The SS18L1 gene is homologous to SS18.|$|E
5000|$|RNF113B is the primate-specific retrogene of RNF113A. The gene {{is a rare}} {{example of}} intron gain into a gene. In humans, RNF113B is found on Chromosome 13. [...] RNF113B mRNA {{transcript}} contains a upstream <b>in-frame</b> stop codon. The protein has both a RING finger domain (really interesting new gene) and a zinc finger motif.|$|E
50|$|Deletion of {{a number}} of pairs that is not evenly {{divisible}} by three will lead to a frameshift mutation, causing all of the codons occurring after the deletion to be read incorrectly during translation, producing a severely altered and potentially nonfunctional protein. In contrast, a deletion that is evenly divisible by three is called an <b>in-frame</b> deletion.|$|E
50|$|In humans, D5 {{receptor}} is encoded on the chromosome 4p15.1-p15.3. The gene lacks introns and encodes {{a product}} of 477 amino acids. Two pseudogenes for D5 receptor exist that share 98% sequence {{with each other and}} 95% sequence with the functional DRD5 gene. These genes contain several <b>in-frame</b> stop codons that prevent these genes from transcribing a functional protein.|$|E
50|$|PSI+ {{appears more}} {{frequently}} in response to environmental stress. In yeast, more stop codon disappearances are <b>in-frame,</b> mimicking the effects of PSI+, than would be expected from mutation bias or than are observed in other taxa that do not form the PSI+ prion. These observations are compatible with PSI+ acting as an evolutionary capacitor in the wild.|$|E
50|$|Missense, <b>in-frame</b> and {{frameshift}} mutations of NR5A1 {{have been}} found in families with 46,XY disorders of sex development, 46,XX gonadal dysgenesis and 46,XX primary ovarian insufficiency. 46,XY individuals may have ambiguous or female genitals. Individuals of either karyotype may not enter puberty, although expression of the phenotype, penetrance, fertility, and modes of inheritance can vary. Some mutations are dominant, some are recessive.|$|E
