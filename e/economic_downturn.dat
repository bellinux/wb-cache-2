As the United States went through an <b>economic</b> <b>downturn</b> from 1985 to 1989 there was a shortage of touring shows for venues like the 5th. Consequently, many of the country's Broadway houses went unused for extended periods of time.

5|$|Like other Rust Belt cities, Utica had an <b>economic</b> <b>downturn</b> {{beginning}} in the mid-20thcentury. The downturn consisted of industrial decline due to globalization and the closure of textile mills, population loss caused by the relocation of jobs and businesses to suburbs and to Syracuse, and poverty associated with socioeconomic stress and a decreased tax base. With its low cost of living, the city has become a melting pot for refugees from war-torn countries around the world, encouraging growth for its colleges and universities, cultural institutions and economy.|$|E

40|$|Do <b>economic</b> <b>downturns</b> in the Global North {{undermine}} worker {{safety in}} the Global South? Literature suggests that bilateral trade linkages lead to the diffusion of “good” labor standards from importing countries of the Global North to exporting countries of the Global South. The crucial mechanism is the ability and willingness of importing firms to deploy their market leverage and ask for improved labor standards from their overseas suppliers. Yet, cost-cutting pressures emanating from <b>economic</b> <b>downturns</b> might lead the same importing firms to give lower priority to worker {{safety in the}}ir overseas supply chains. When importing firms demand price reductions, overseas suppliers might respond by reducing wages, ignoring safety regulations, and working their labor force for longer hours. The observable implication is that worker safety in the Global South may deteriorate during <b>economic</b> <b>downturns</b> in their export markets located in the Global North. We evaluate our hypothesis using a panel of 83 developing countries for the period during 1980 – 2009, and find that <b>economic</b> <b>downturns</b> in developed country markets are associated with significant increases in non-fatal occupational injury rates in developing countries. The injury-increasing effect is more pronounced in developing countries with weak workers' rights protection...|$|R

5|$|The Great Depression in Canada {{during the}} early 1930s saw an <b>economic</b> <b>downturn,</b> leading to {{hardship}} across the country. In response to the downturn, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in Saskatchewan introduced many elements of a welfare state (as pioneered by Tommy Douglas) in the 1940s and 1950s. On the advice of Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, war with Germany was declared effective September 10, 1939, by King George VI, seven days after the United Kingdom. The delay underscored Canada's independence.|$|E
5|$|The {{first years}} of the 14th century were marked by famines, {{culminating}} in the Great Famine of 1315–17. The causes of the Great Famine included the slow transition from the Medieval Warm Period to the Little Ice Age, which left the population vulnerable when bad weather caused crop failures. The years 1313–14 and 1317–21 were excessively rainy throughout Europe, resulting in widespread crop failures. The climate change—which resulted in a declining average annual temperature for Europe during the 14th century—was accompanied by an <b>economic</b> <b>downturn.</b>|$|E
5|$|The trust {{was hurt}} by the <b>economic</b> <b>downturn</b> {{following}} 2007 and has reduced its annual budget by 14%. In 2007, the trust had $6.4 billion in endowment, but this amount dropped to $4.5 billion in 2009. In 2009, the trust had $300 million in expenses down from $349 million in 2008.

50|$|Contrary to some {{critical}} characterizations of it, Keynesianism does not consist solely of deficit spending. Keynesianism recommends counter-cyclical policies. An {{example of a}} counter-cyclical policy is raising taxes to cool the economy and to prevent inflation when there is abundant demand-side growth, and engaging in deficit spending on labour-intensive infrastructure projects to stimulate employment and stabilize wages during <b>economic</b> <b>downturns.</b> Classical economics, on the other hand, argues that one should cut taxes when there are budget surpluses, and cut spending - or, less likely, increase taxes - during <b>economic</b> <b>downturns.</b>|$|R

5|$|Although Roanoke {{has never}} had {{international}} passenger service, in 2001, the Airport Commission was prepared to change the airport's name to Roanoke International Airport. This was the case as the U.S. Customs Service increased the radius covered by the inland port in Dublin to include Roanoke. This expansion allowed for the airport to add customs officials to accommodate both international travel and cargo to pass through Roanoke's facilities. However, the renaming did not occur {{as a result of}} the <b>economic</b> <b>downturn</b> in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks. In 2007, the prospect of changing the airport's name was again mentioned as a possibility by the Airport Commission.|$|E

In March 2009, even before international co-operation reached its peak with the 2009 G-20 London Summit , economist Ted Truman {{became one of the first}} to warn of the dangers of competitive devaluation.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{evidence that}} property tax limits have detrimental effects {{on state and}} local revenues during recessions. Property tax limits cause states to rely on income–elastic revenue sources, such as the income tax or charges and fees. Greater reliance on these revenue sources results in greater revenue declines during <b>economic</b> <b>downturns.</b> We present analysis of time–series, cross–sectional data for the U.

Our results suggest that states would have fewer and more modest financial problems during <b>economic</b> <b>downturns</b> if they did not enact property tax limitations...|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{models of}} the labor market {{typically}} assume that wages are set by the market, not the firm. However, over the last 15 years, a growing body of empirical research has provided evidence against this assumption. Recent studies suggest that a monopsonistic model, where individual firms and not the market set wages, may be more appropriate. This model attributes more wage-setting power to firms, particularly during <b>economic</b> <b>downturns,</b> which helps explain why wages decrease during recessions. This holds important implications for policymakers attempting to combat lost worker income during <b>economic</b> <b>downturns...</b>|$|R
