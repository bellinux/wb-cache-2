50|$|CHDK is a {{firmware}} add-on {{for many}} Canon PowerShot cameras that among other features {{can provide an}} <b>intervalometer.</b> The Magic Lantern add-on firmware adds many functions including an <b>intervalometer</b> to Canon 5D Mark II, 550D, 60D, 600D, 50D and 500D cameras.|$|E
50|$|An <b>intervalometer</b> is {{a device}} which counts {{intervals}} of time. Such devices commonly {{are used to}} signal, in accurate time intervals, the operation of some other device. For instance, an <b>intervalometer</b> might activate something every 30 seconds. Other names include interval meter and interval timer.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the more}} common types of <b>intervalometers</b> is the timer {{that is used to}} turn lights on and off at set times, or that of an {{automatic}} sprinkler system. These are commonly used by people when they leave their home {{for an extended period of}} time to make it appear the home is occupied. There are also a large number of commercial and industrial applications for even such basic <b>intervalometers.</b>|$|R
50|$|In photography, <b>intervalometers</b> {{are used}} to trigger exposures. This is often done for a {{time-lapse}} series. It may {{also be used to}} take, or begin taking, picture(s) after a set delay.|$|R
50|$|Nikon and Pentax DSLRs (Nikon D2H, D2X, D2Xs, D3, D3s, D4, D4s, D800, D800E, D810, D750, D700, D600, D610, D200, D300, D300s, D7000, D7100, D5000, D5100, D5200, D5300, Pentax K-5, K-r, K-30, K-50, K-5 II, K-5 IIs and K3), Panasonic GH3 {{as well as}} Nikon and Pentax mirrorless interchangeable-lens cameras (Nikon 1 J1, V1, J2, V2, Pentax Q, K-01, Q10, Q7) have {{built-in}} <b>intervalometers.</b>|$|R

50|$|Pentax Optio W-series compact cameras (Optio W10,W20,W60,W90,WG-1) {{as well as}} Optio 555 have a {{built-in}} basic <b>intervalometer.</b> The camera is put in standby mode between shots to reduce power. The <b>intervalometer</b> can be set to take up to 1000 pictures, at a user settable interval of 10 seconds to 99 minutes.|$|E

5000|$|Suddenly {{the drone}} turned back towards Los Angeles. Einstein and Hurliman {{were forced to}} switch from the faulty {{automatic}} mode to manual fire. The D-model Scorpions had been delivered with gun sights, but when the E-6 fire-control system was later added, the sights were removed. Now, with the radar-guided system inoperative and no gun sight, the attackers were forced to manually aim the unguided rockets. The F-89D was capable of firing all 104 of it rockets at once, all leaving their tubes in only 0.4 s. The rockets could also be set to [...] "ripple fire" [...] in two different patterns: two ripples (64 and 42 rockets) or three ripples (42, 32, and 30 rockets). A single hit was sufficient to bring down an aircraft. Murray and Hale set their <b>intervalometers</b> to [...] "ripple fire" [...] in three salvos.|$|R
50|$|The {{built-in}} <b>intervalometer</b> (timer) can be {{used for}} time-lapse low-lit movies.|$|E
5000|$|What {{is meant}} when someone {{refers to an}} [...] "intervalometer" [...] must be {{determined}} from context. Some possibilities are: time-lapse capability (strictly an <b>intervalometer</b> function), sensing of a remote event, a time delay longer than what most consider the [...] "self-timer" [...] range, etc. Strictly speaking, an <b>intervalometer</b> only measures, and/or signals, time intervals.|$|E

50|$|Often {{the purpose}} of a {{photographic}} <b>intervalometer</b> is to reduce the resources required either to take the pictures or post-process them as similar images could be obtained by having the camera continuously take pictures as rapidly as possible. Using an <b>intervalometer</b> permits restricting the pictures taken to only those with the desired content. This reduces the requirements for resources such as power and storage media (e.g. film or memory card space).|$|E
5000|$|... 400plus is a {{firmware}} add-on {{which offers}} additional functionality for Canon 400D, such as <b>intervalometer</b> and custom autofocus patterns.|$|E
50|$|The Nikon MT-1 <b>intervalometer</b> allowed {{completely}} untended {{time lapse}} photography. It could fire the F2 {{for a specific}} number of frames at a particular shutter speed at set time intervals.|$|E
5000|$|Most modern cameras {{include the}} most basic <b>intervalometer</b> functionality, the [...] "self-timer". This delays the shutter release for a short time, {{allowing}} the photographer {{to get into the}} picture, for example.|$|E
50|$|Exposures {{typically}} {{required the}} use of a cockpit-mounted <b>intervalometer,</b> set by reference to speed, altitude, and interval so that the pilot or observer could obtain the correct exposures by keying a switch. Great flight precision was needed especially for exposures for stereography and cartography in general.|$|E
50|$|Bomber {{aircraft}} can {{release all}} of their bombs at one time ("salvo") or drop individual bombs at intervals. If the bombardier selects the latter, he can program an <b>intervalometer</b> to control the pace at which the bombs are released. This, of course, determines how far apart they will land in the target area.|$|E
50|$|Time-lapse can be {{achieved}} with some normal movie cameras by simply shooting individual frames manually. But greater accuracy in time-increments and consistency in exposure rates of successive frames are better achieved through a device that connects to the camera's shutter system (camera design permitting) called an <b>intervalometer.</b> The <b>intervalometer</b> regulates {{the motion of the}} camera according to a specific interval of time between frames. Today, many consumer grade digital cameras, including even some point-and-shoot cameras have hardware or software intervalometers available. Some intervalometers can be connected to motion control systems that move the camera on any number of axes as the time-lapse photography is achieved, creating tilts, pans, tracks, and trucking shots when the movie is played at normal frame rate. Ron Fricke is the primary developer of such systems, which can be seen in his short film Chronos (1985) and his feature films Baraka (1992, released to video in 2001) and Samsara (2011).|$|E
50|$|Almost all {{digital cameras}} have the basic {{hardware}} capability required for <b>intervalometer</b> functions: knowing {{the current and}} elapsed times. The implementation of more advanced functions {{is a matter of}} what the manufacturer chooses to implement in the camera's firmware. Functions beyond the self-timer are beginning to be seen in some digital cameras, and are used in some cases to distinguish models within a camera line.|$|E
50|$|At {{the time}} of announcement, Nikon claimed that it {{features}} the world's fastest autofocus, with 10 fps—even during videos—based on hybrid autofocus (phase detection/contrast-detect AF with AF-assist illuminator), {{as well as the}} world's fastest continuous shooting speed (60 fps) among all cameras with interchangeable lenses. Slow-motion movies can be captured in up to 1200 fps with reduced resolution. Its inbuilt <b>intervalometer</b> enables time-lapse photography.|$|E
5000|$|Most Digital Single Lens Reflex (DSLR) {{cameras are}} limited to 30 second or shorter {{exposures}}. An <b>intervalometer</b> {{can be used to}} take long (>30 seconds) or very long exposures (minutes or hours) using the [...] "Bulb" [...] setting. Long and very long exposures taken at night can be combined to create timelapse animations, star trails, or using astrophotography processing techniques to create images of objects in the night sky like nebulae and galaxies.|$|E
50|$|The shutter of {{the camera}} can be {{released}} in several ways, {{depending on the type}} of camera and complexity of the rig electronics, if used. Shutter release mechanisms include using a radio controlled servo to press the shutter release button, using an infrared signal or wired connection to instruct the camera to release the shutter, or by using the camera's inbuilt <b>intervalometer.</b> Ideally the camera is allowed to reach its final altitude before the shutter is released to avoid taking photos during launch.|$|E
50|$|Examples of <b>intervalometer</b> use in aerial {{photography}} include {{delaying the}} start of picture taking by an unattended camera until some time after takeoff and separating multiple exposures in time, and thus distance as the vehicle containing the camera travels, to obtain the 3D effect (stereoscopy). To obtain the 3D effect each image should have about 60% of the surface in common with either the preceding or following image. The interval is calculated {{as a function of}} the altitude and speed of the vehicle; shorter intervals for low altitude and high speed.|$|E
5000|$|In 2016, Johnson {{worked with}} Jess Wolfe and Holly Laessig {{of the popular}} indie pop band Lucius to direct their music video for [...] "Gone Insane". This video was created using an <b>intervalometer</b> and over 3,000 still photographs. Johnson enlisted special effects makeup artist Jim Ojala to create a series of {{prosthetics}} which {{would be used to}} create the effect of Wolfe's face stretching like silly putty. The video received notable mainstream recognition, with Rolling Stone describing the effects as [...] "strange and striking" [...] and the Village Voice calling them [...] "exceptional".|$|E
5000|$|Remote Control R8/R9: an {{electronic}} unit that attaches {{to either the}} Motor Winder or the Motor Drive; it cannot {{be connected to the}} bare camera. In addition to triggering the shutter, the Remote Control can turn the camera on or off, control mode and exposure, control auto-bracketing, and can function as an <b>intervalometer</b> triggering at rates between one per second and one every 24 hours. It comes with a 5-metre cord and can be fitted with up to 4 25 metre extension cords for a maximum length of 105 metres.|$|E
50|$|Measuring {{devices and}} {{instruments}} are categorized {{according to the}} physical quantities {{they are designed to}} measure. These vary internationally, e.g., NIST 150-2G in the U.S. and NABL-141 in India. Together, these standards cover instruments that measure various physical quantities such as electromagnetic radiation (RF probes), time and frequency (<b>intervalometer),</b> ionizing radiation (Geiger counter), light (light meter), mechanical quantities (limit switch, pressure gauge, pressure switch), and, thermodynamic or thermal properties (thermometer, temperature controller). The standard instrument for each test device varies accordingly, e.g., a dead weight tester for pressure gauge calibration and a dry block temperature tester for temperature gauge calibration.|$|E
5000|$|The {{originally}} available Motor Drive {{was named}} the [...] "Motor Drive Unit". It was {{commonly referred to as}} the Motor Drive MD - because all of the accessories had MD in their suffix, {{but that was not the}} official designation. The Motor Drive Unit originally required a corded battery pack (10 AAs) making it unwieldy for field or sports action use. A later battery pack that direct connected to the unit became available. The unit also contained a built <b>intervalometer</b> for delays up to 1 frame per minute. The maximum speed was 3 frames per second.|$|E
50|$|The ALE-39 {{countermeasures}} {{system uses}} intervalometers manufactured by Ledex Inc. (now part of Johnson Electric) of Dayton, Ohio. The ALE-39 can fire flares in a synchronized pattern, very rapidly {{and with great}} reliability. The <b>intervalometer</b> used in the ALE-39 is essentially a solenoid-actuated rotary switch driven by a separate programmer which gives timing intervals and channel enabling to either {{of one or two}} channels. Intervalometers that contain internal interval clocks include the Lau-68, Suu-13 and similar electromechanically sequenced switches. Safety is provided to unfired outputs by maintaining a ground connection to all except the output being selected for firing; i.e., providing an electrical pulse to the firing squib.|$|E
50|$|In the past, intervalometers were {{external}} devices which interfaced to {{a camera}} to trigger taking a picture, or series of pictures, at a set time. These sometimes used existing remote shutter features on cameras. Later, standalone products {{commonly referred to}} as intervalometers have added capabilities far beyond the basics of just measuring, and signaling, a time interval. One of the first features that was added to intervalometers was the ability to use an external event to signal the start of the time interval(s). The ability to sense an external event is such a common feature of <b>intervalometer</b> products that many people do not distinguish between the sensing of the event and the measuring of time intervals.|$|E
50|$|While {{the drone}} flew over Castaic, the first crew lined up and fired 42 rockets, {{completely}} missing their target. The second interceptor moved into position and unleashed another salvo of 42, the rockets passing {{just beneath the}} bright red drone, a few glancing off the fuselage underside, but none detonating. Close {{to the town of}} Newhall the pair of jets made a second pass, launching a total of 64 rockets; again none found the mark. The two Scorpion crews adjusted their <b>intervalometer</b> settings and, as the wayward drone headed northeast toward Palmdale, each fired a last salvo of 30 at the target with no hits, dispensing their last rockets. In all, the Air Force element fired 208 rockets and were unable to shoot the Hellcat down.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} type of autobracketing is {{exposure}} autobracketing (often abbreviated to AEB for Automatic Exposure Bracketing or BR for Bracketing), where the camera is set to capture the same image several times with different exposure settings, both over-exposed and under-exposed (lighter and darker) compared to the current setting on the camera, which may already include exposure compensation. Depending on the camera, the difference between each of the autobracketed shots could be anywhere from one-quarter up to three full stops in each direction, in full, half, third or quarter stop increments, ranging from two up to nine shots in series. Sometimes it is possible to either define the order, in which the shots will be taken, or to give an offset as a start-point of the bracketing series. More sophisticated equipment allows auto-exposure bracketing to be combined with timer and <b>intervalometer</b> functions as well.|$|E
5000|$|In 1973, Canon {{introduced}} the Motor Drive MF. The Motor Drive MF had its batteries (10 AAs) in a vertical grip that mounted {{to the front}} left (looking from the front). It had a maximum rate of 3.5 frame/sec and was much better suited to action / sports photography, especially when paired with the Speed Finder or Servo EE finder. A special cord allowed the Servo EE finder to draw its power from the Motor drive MF - thus making a much more compact setup than the original Motor Drive unit. The Motor Drive MF {{did not have a}} built in <b>intervalometer,</b> but the Interval Timer L (and later the Interval Timer TM-1 (Quartz) could be plugged into the remote control socket as could remote switches and a wireless control unit, the Wireless Controller LC-1. These all allowed either remote and / or unattended use of the camera.|$|E
5000|$|Reggio and Fricke {{came across}} {{time-lapse}} footage in [...] "some low-visibility commercial work". They felt such footage was [...] "the language they were missing", and collectively decided to implement time-lapse {{as a major}} part of the film to create [...] "an experience of acceleration". For the time-lapse footage, Fricke purchased a Mitchell camera, and built a motor with an <b>intervalometer,</b> which was used to precisely move the camera between frames. The system was powered by a gel cell battery that lasted for twelve hours, which enabled Fricke to shoot without the use of a generator. Most time-lapse shots were filmed at a frame rate of 1½ frames per second. Fricke wanted the footage to [...] "look normal" [...] and not contain any [...] "gimmicky" [...] special effects. The time-lapse shot overlooking the freeway in Los Angeles was filmed from the top of a building in through a double exposure, with ten-second delay between frames. The first take was shot throughout the day for twelve hours, then the film was rewound and the same scene was shot at night for twenty minutes.|$|E
40|$|<b>Intervalometer</b> or {{time lapse}} {{photography}} is not very widely used because it requires good planning {{and a lot of}} time. Photos are then often put together into a video file which is not a simple procedure. One can buy a wired remote for the camera with time lapse function. But we haven't found one that can be controlled with a mobile phone. In this thesis we are focusing on building an application for Symbian smartphone, rather than the {{time lapse photography}} itself. A photographic <b>intervalometer</b> that can be connected to a camera was designed and constructed. The mobile phone and the <b>intervalometer</b> communicate wirelessly via Bluetooth. Mobile phone is used to remotely control the <b>intervalometer.</b> It can also use SMS messages for this purpose. The <b>intervalometer</b> can also be used as a stand-alone device and the user operates it with the built-in keyboard and LCD screen. The aim of this thesis was to explore the possibility of wireless communication and control. This goal was achieved using mobile phone and the Arduino development board which communicate wirelessly via Bluetooth. In the end we got a fully functional <b>intervalometer</b> prototype which can be used to demonstrate how the device works and how it can be used. ...|$|E
