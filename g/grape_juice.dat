5|$|Since almost its {{inception}} in 1914, Grapico was associated with real <b>grape</b> <b>juice</b> by J. Grossman's Sons through its advertisements and business stationery. Publicly associating Grapico with genuine <b>grape</b> <b>juice</b> allowed J. Grossman's Sons to compete directly with real <b>grape</b> <b>juice</b> producers such as Welch <b>Grape</b> <b>Juice</b> Co. and have an advantage over other imitation grape flavored beverage producers. A problem with this approach was that Grapico was an artificial grape drink that included neither real <b>grape</b> <b>juice</b> nor fruit from the grape.|$|E
5|$|J. Grossman's Sons began {{manufacturing}} Grapico in 1914. At that time, Grapico {{consisted of}} a syrup that, when mixed with soda water, had the taste, smell, and color of a genuine grape drink. The product was artificially colored and flavored with only an infinitesimal amount of <b>grape</b> <b>juice</b> or fruit of the grape.|$|E
5|$|The juice {{forms the}} basis for various popular cordials, juice drinks, juices and smoothies. Typically blended with apple or other red fruits, it is also mixed with {{pomegranate}} and <b>grape</b> <b>juice.</b> Macerated blackcurrants are also the primary ingredient in the apéritif liqueur crème de cassis, {{which in turn is}} added to white wine to produce a Kir or to champagne to make a Kir Royale.|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to characterize organic, biodynamic, and conventional purple <b>grape</b> <b>juices</b> (n = 31) produced in Europe based on instrumental taste profile, antioxidant activity, and some chemical markers and to propose a multivariate statistical model to analyze their quality and try to classify the samples from the 3 different crop systems. Results were subjected to ANOVA, correlation, and regression analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA), and partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA). No statistical significant differences (P > 0. 05) were observed among juices from the 3 crop systems. Using PCA and HCA, no clear separation among crop systems was observed, corroborating the ANOVA data. However, PCA showed that the producing region highly affects the chemical composition, electronic tongue parameters, and bioactivity of <b>grape</b> <b>juices.</b> In this sense, when organic and biodynamic were grouped as “nonconventional” juices, SIMCA model was able to discriminate 12 out of 13 organic/biodynamic juices and 17 out of 18 conventional juices, presenting an efficiency of 93. 5 %, while 11 out of 13 non-conventional and 100 % conventional <b>grape</b> <b>juices</b> were correctly classified using PLSDA. The use of electronic tongue and the determination of antioxidant properties and major phenolic compounds have shown to be a quick and accurate analytical approach to assess the quality of <b>grape</b> <b>juices...</b>|$|R

5|$|On 12 January 2009, {{at least}} three people, {{including}} two Mexicans and one American, entered the Parque-Museo La Venta in Villahermosa and damaged just under 30 archaeological pieces, including the four La Venta colossal heads. The vandals were all members of an evangelical church and {{appeared to have been}} carrying out a supposed pre-Columbian ritual, during which salts, <b>grape</b> <b>juice,</b> and oil were thrown on the heads. It was estimated that 300,000 pesos (US$21,900) would be needed to repair the damage, and the restoration process would last four months. The three vandals were released soon after their arrest after paying 330,000 pesos each.|$|E
5|$|Thomcord grape is {{a hybrid}} of Thompson Seedless grape (Vitis vinifera, or Sultanina), which is popular in {{supermarkets}} during the summer, and seeded Concord grape (Vitis labrusca), commonly used to make <b>grape</b> <b>juice</b> and jelly. It is a plump, juicy, seedless table grape and is slightly firmer than Concord. Thomcord has a blue-black skin with medium thickness and a whitish bloom. Unlike Concord, whose tough skin separates easily from the fruit, Thomcord has a more edible skin that clings to the flesh, much like Thompson Seedless. It has an aromatic flavor, similar to the Concord in taste ("labrusca"), though lighter due to the sweet, mild taste from Thompson Seedless.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1916, J. Grossman's Sons {{contacted}} American jazz composers Peter DeRose and Ivan Reid {{to write}} a song about Grapico. DeRose, who would later {{be inducted into the}} Songwriters Hall of Fame, produced the piano accompanied song, Meet Me in the Land of Grapico. Meet Me in the Land of Grapico is a sentimental ballad from Tin Pan Alley that imagined a faraway Land of Grapico where love lives forever. The song (see below) and its cover sheet alluded to a grape vine-covered arbor in the Land of Grapico, even though Grapico contained no <b>grape</b> <b>juice.</b> Dedicating the song to all the drinkers of Grapico, J. Grossman's Sons published the song in 1916 and provided it free on request.|$|E

25|$|The Methodist Church {{has long}} used non-alcoholic wine (<b>grape</b> <b>juice)</b> in {{the sacrament of}} Holy Communion. In 1869, an American Methodist dentist named Thomas Welch {{developed}} a method of pasteurising <b>grape</b> <b>juice</b> {{in order to produce}} an unfermented communion wine for his church. He later founded Welch's <b>grape</b> <b>juice</b> company. By the 1880s, this non-alcoholic wine had become commonplace in Methodist churches worldwide.|$|E

40|$|Background and Aim: Regarding the multi-dimensional {{activity}} of medicinal herbs in complex disorders like diabetes, {{the present study}} was undertaken to evaluate the effect of freezed and dried extract of black <b>grapes</b> <b>juice</b> on serum glucose and lipid profile of alloxan induced diabetic rats. Materials and Methods: The present study was performed on 48 male Wistar rats which included 6 groups, i. e. the control group and five alloxan-induced diabetics. The other five groups were the following: 1. The control diabetic group, which only received normal saline, 2. The diabetic group, which received glibenclamide and lovastatin, 3. 4., and 5 At first, diabetes was induced in 40 cases through intraperitoneally injection of alloxan. After 2 days, fasting blood sugar (FBS) greater than 200 mg/dl was considered as diabetic condition. Diabetic rats were divided into 5 groups (group 2 to 6) randomly. Groups 1 was included nondiabetic control. Group 1 and 2 (diabetic control) gavaged by normal saline. Group 3 by glibenclamide and lovastatin, group's 4, 5 and 6 received 100, 200, 300 mg/kg black <b>grapes</b> <b>juice</b> extract, respectively for four weeks. Then, blood samples of the anesthetized rats were collected and blood glucose, cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL-C and LDL-C levels were measured, using standard kits and by of Shimatzu Autanalyzer. Results: Black <b>grapes</b> <b>juice</b> extract at higher doses decreased weight loss of diabetic rats. Moreover, this extract reduced blood glucose level and the effect was dose-dependent.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Organic, biodynamic and {{conventional}} purple <b>grape</b> <b>juices</b> (PGJ; n = 79) produced in Brazil and Europe {{were characterized by}} volatile organic compounds (m/z 20 - 160) measured by proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS), and classification models were built using supervised statistical techniques. RESULTS: k-Nearest neighbours and soft independent modelling of class analogy (SIMCA) models discriminated adequately the Brazilian from European PGJ (overall efficiency of 81 % and 87 %, respectively). Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA) classified 100 % European and 96 % Brazilian PGJ. Similarly, when samples were grouped as either conventional or organic/biodynamic, the PLSDA model classified 81 % conventional and 83 % organic/biodynamic juices. Intraregional PLSDA models (juices produced in the same region - either Europe or Brazil) were developed and were deemed accurate in discriminating Brazilian organic from conventional PGJ (81 % efficiency), as well as European conventional from organic/biodynamic PGJ (94 % efficiency). CONCLUSIONS: PGJ from Brazil and Europe, as well as conventional and organic/biodynamic PGJ, were distinguished with high efficiency, but no statistical model was able to differentiate organic and biodynamic <b>grape</b> <b>juices.</b> These data {{support the hypothesis that}} no clear distinction between organic and biodynamic <b>grape</b> <b>juices</b> can be made with respect to volatile organic compounds. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} farming system, {{geographical}} origin, and grape variety on the in vitro antioxidant capacity, some physicochemical properties and chemical composition were investigated. Major and minor phenolic compounds, reducing and antioxidant assays using {{chemical and biological}} systems were determined in n = 62 100 % purple <b>grape</b> Brazilian <b>juices</b> (Vitis labrusca L.) from organic and conventional systems from the three largest producing regions. Results were subjected to ANOVA, MANOVA, and principal component analysis. No distinction was observed between organic and conventional <b>grape</b> <b>juices</b> regarding the in vitro antioxidant/reducing capacities, but only through the analysis of individual phenolic acids. The geographical origin and grape variety played a more important role in distinguishing Brazilian <b>grape</b> <b>juices</b> according to the antioxidant activity and some chemical markers. MANOVA was applied and the combined effect of farming system and geographical origin was only significant for tonality (p = 0. 044) and protocatechuic acid content (p = 0. 030). Correlation analysis was performed and results showed that total phenolic content, total flavonoids, flavonols, anthocyanins, and condensed tannins were statistically associated (p < 0. 05) with FRAP, ABTS, and reducing potential of the hydrophilic phenolic compounds (RPHPC). Ascorbic acid {{did not seem to}} be involved in the antioxidant potential of the selected purple <b>grape</b> <b>juices.</b> Protocatechuic acid was statistically correlated to FRAP (r = 0. 4636, p < 0. 001), ABTS (r = 0. 3298, p = 0. 010), and RPHPC (r = 0. 3623, p = 0. 004), while ferulic acid correlated with FRAP (r = 0. 3410, p = 0. 008) and RPHPC (r = 0. 2662, p = 0. 040). The inhibition of lipid peroxidation conducted at 37 °C in a biological system buffered at pH 7. 4 was significantly (p < 0. 05) correlated to RPHPC (r = 0. 533, p = 0. 013) and to the scavenging activity toward ABTS radical (r = 0. 505, p = 0. 020). In addition, principal component analysis revealed that the inhibition of lipid peroxidation was associated with higher contents of total phenolic content, flavonoids, anthocyanins, flavonols, condensed tannins, and protocatechuic acid. Additionally, both spectrophotometric and chromatographic data regarding the phenolic composition seemed to be suitable approaches to differentiate Brazilian organic and conventionally-produced purple <b>grape</b> <b>juices</b> using PLS-DA as the classification efficiency in the calibration and validation steps were 78 % and 75 %, respectively. </p...|$|R
