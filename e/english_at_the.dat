5|$|Christian Renoux, {{a history}} {{professor}} at the University of Orléans, published in French in 2001 a book-length study of the prayer and its origins, clearing up much of the confusion that had accumulated previously. The Franciscan journal Frate Francesco and the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano published articles in Italian summarizing the book's findings, and Renoux published an online abstract in <b>English</b> <b>at</b> <b>The</b> Franciscan Archive.|$|E
5|$|After Britain {{declared}} war on Germany in September 1939, Auden told the British embassy in Washington that {{he would return to}} the UK if needed. He was told that, among those his age (32), only qualified personnel were needed. In 1941–42 he taught <b>English</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Michigan. He was called for the draft in the United States Army in August 1942, but was rejected on medical grounds. He had been awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for 1942–43 but did not use it, choosing instead to teach at Swarthmore College in 1942–45.|$|E
50|$|He was an <b>English</b> {{lecturer}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Manchester in 1933, then Professor of <b>English</b> Literature <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Sheffield in 1947 and the Winterstoke Professor of <b>English</b> <b>at</b> University of Bristol in 1953.

5|$|After William the Conqueror {{defeated}} Harold Godwinson and the <b>English</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Hastings on 14 October 1066, {{he continued}} to face resistance to his rule {{in the north of}} England. For a number of years, William's position was very insecure. In order to project his influence northwards to control the people of the Danelaw (an area that had for a time been under the control of Scandinavian settlers), he constructed a number of major castles in the North and Midlands of England: including those at Warwick, Nottingham and York. After gaining control of York, the Conqueror turned southwards and arrived at the Roman and Viking city of Lincoln.|$|E
5|$|During the 193233 {{season that}} saw England tour Australia under Douglas Jardine with their Bodyline tactics, which {{involved}} bowling high speed deliveries at the batsmen's body, rumours circulated that Halcombe could be {{selected for the}} Tests. Halcombe's pace saw him touted as a possible retaliatory outlet against the <b>English.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> beginning of the season, Halcombe played for Western Australia in a tour match against England. He took 3/48 and 1/38 in a drawn match, including the Bodyline mastermind and captain Douglas Jardine, Bob Wyatt, Les Ames and the Nawab of Pataudi. He was then called into the Australian XI in a subsequent tour match. He was less successful on this occasion, taking 1/81 as England scored 7/583. Halcombe was not selected for any other first-class matches during the season.|$|E
5|$|Godwin {{was born}} in Birmingham, Alabama, but raised mostly in Asheville, North Carolina by her mother and grandmother. She adopted her mother's {{interest}} in writing {{at an early age}} and obtained a Bachelor's degree in journalism from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC). After graduating, she worked briefly as a reporter for The Miami Herald, then traveled to Europe and worked for the U.S. Travel Service run by the U.S. Embassy in London. She returned to the U.S. after six years. Godwin taught <b>English</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Iowa, while earning her M.A. (1968) and PhD (1971) in English Literature.|$|E

5|$|M. Daphne Kutzer, Professor of <b>English</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> State University of New York at Plattsburgh {{and author}} of Beatrix Potter: Writing in Code (2003), detects some {{similarities}} to The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin (1903). Both tales have touches of the pourquoi story in their explanations of why squirrels collect nuts, and both incorporate rhymes and riddles in their narratives. However, there is a crucial difference that diminishes the artistry of Timmy Tiptoes: the rhymes and riddles in Squirrel Nutkin shed light on Nutkin's character and create a guessing game for the reader while those in Timmy Tiptoes are bland devices that simply move the characters to reunions with their wives and the tale to its conclusion.|$|E
5|$|Millett taught <b>English</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of North Carolina {{after graduating}} from Oxford University, but she left mid-semester to study art. In New York City {{she worked as a}} {{kindergarten}} teacher and learned to sculpt and paint from 1959 to 1961. She then moved to Japan and studied sculpture. Millett met fellow sculptor Fumio Yoshimura, had her first one-woman show at Tokyo's Minami Gallery, and taught English at Waseda University. She left Japan in 1963 and moved to New York's Lower East Side.|$|E

Jennings was awarded the only mathematics degree in her class.

Later in her life, she earned a master's degree in <b>English</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Pennsylvania in 1967 and was awarded an honorary doctorate degree from Northwest Missouri State University in 2002.|$|E
5|$|The {{rectangular}} west {{tower was}} a relatively short defensive structure, {{designed to protect the}} more vulnerable western slope of the ridge. A similar tower in the south overlooks the entrance to the castle. At {{the north end of the}} castle is the hall, stretching across the courtyard; in the east corner is an additional building, probably built by the <b>English</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the 13th century. Although the hall is relatively large, 50 by 27feet (15 by 8m), these buildings follow a simpler design to those current in England at the time, where a combination of a hall, chamber and a service block in castles was becoming more common.|$|E
5|$|Baith Israel hired Marcus Friedlander as rabbi in 1887. Born in Congress Poland in 1862, he left Russia for England {{before he}} was twenty. Though {{speaking}} little <b>English</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, he graduated there from the London Theological Seminary, before emigrating to the United States. He was 24 {{years old when he}} assumed the post at Baith Israel, at the time the youngest man in New York state to be appointed to so significant a position of Jewish leadership. Friedlander served until 1893, when he resigned to take a more lucrative position in California at the First Hebrew Congregation of Oakland. After Friedlander left, his name was, for reasons unknown, deleted from the synagogue histories, and the financial records and minute books dating from his tenure were removed from Baith Israel's archives. He was succeeded by Joseph Taubenhaus, the brother of Dr. Gottheil/Godfrey Taubenhaus, the rabbi of Congregation Beth Elohim; another brother, Jacob/Jean Taubenhaus was a famous French chess master.|$|E

5|$|In 1513, King James IV led an {{invasion}} of northern England {{in support of the}} French and the Auld Alliance. On 9 September, the Scots met the <b>English</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Flodden, and were heavily defeated, with King James killed on the field. An English invasion was widely expected, and in Edinburgh it was resolved to build a new town wall. However, the new wall was also an opportunity to control smuggling into the burgh, and the town council accordingly decided to extend the wall south to take in the Grassmarket and Cowgate areas of the burgh. Construction began the following year, but was not completed until 1560. Work started at the western end, and the final section was the stretch from Leith Wynd to the Nor Loch, incorporating the New Port. The cost of this last work was £4/10s Scots per rood (one rood = six ells or 5.6metres) for the wall, plus 40s per rood for the battlements.|$|E
5|$|Joyce and Nora {{went into}} self-imposed exile, moving first to Zurich in Switzerland, where he ostensibly taught <b>English</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Berlitz Language School through an agent in England. It later came to {{fact that the}} agent had been swindled; the {{director}} of the school sent Joyce on to Trieste, which was then part of Austria-Hungary (until the First World War), and is today part of Italy. Once again, he found there was no position for him, but with the help of Almidano Artifoni, director of the Trieste Berlitz School, he finally secured a teaching position in Pola, then also part of Austria-Hungary (today part of Croatia). He stayed there, teaching English mainly to Austro-Hungarian naval officers stationed at the Pola base, from October 1904 until March 1905, when the Austrians—having discovered an espionage ring in the city—expelled all aliens. With Artifoni's help, he moved back to Trieste and began teaching English there. He remained in Trieste for most of the next ten years.|$|E
5|$|Qadir {{made his}} Test debut in 1977 against England at the Gaddafi Stadium, Lahore. His first Test five-wicket haul came the {{following}} year against the same team in a match at the Niaz Stadium, Hyderabad. In March 1984 against the <b>English</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Gaddafi Stadium, he took a five-wicket haul in both innings of a Test match for the first time. He repeated this feat only once more in his career, at the National Stadium, Karachi, against the same team, in December 1987. His career-best figures for an innings were 9wickets for 56runs against England at the Gaddafi Stadium, in November 1987. In Tests, Qadir was most successful against the English taking eight of his five-wicket hauls against them. He took ten or more wickets in a match on five occasions. Qadir claimed 15 five-wicket hauls in his Test career, and Pakistan never lost any of the games on such instances.|$|E

5|$|The Spanish vanguard {{was driven}} {{off by the}} <b>English</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> first charge, but the Spanish pikemen under Captains Pedro Manrique and Manuel de Vega, from Francisco Arias de Bobadilla's and Juan del Águila's tercios, formed the {{defenders}} into squadron formation and kept the way open for the wagons. As the carters fled {{at the beginning of}} the fight, the Spanish arquebusiers had to take their places and brought the wagons towards Zutphen. Stanley's pikemen charged upon the Spanish squadron, but they were repelled at the push of pike. As the fight approached Zutphen and Francisco Verdugo noticed the musketry fire, he ordered a wagon to be loaded with powder and bullets and sent it to the Spanish arquebusiers. The English cavalry, in the meantime, charged over the Spanish pikes on one of its flanks. Though they succeeded in breaking the two or three foremost ranks, Essex's men could not penetrate further. Twice more the English charged upon the squadron, but they were as well repelled.|$|E
5|$|This {{reinforcement}} of the aristocracy {{must be seen}} {{in conjunction with the}} war in France, as must the emerging sense of national identity. Just as the war with Scotland had done, the fear of a French invasion helped strengthen a sense of national unity, and nationalise the aristocracy that had been largely Anglo-Norman since the Norman conquest. Since the time of Edward I, popular myth suggested that the French planned to extinguish the English language, and as his grandfather had done, Edward III made the most of this scare. As a result, the English language experienced a strong revival; in 1362, a Statute of Pleading ordered the English language to be used in law courts, and the year after, Parliament was for the first time opened in <b>English.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> same time, the vernacular saw a revival as a literary language, through the works of William Langland, John Gower and especially The Canterbury Tales by Geoffrey Chaucer. Yet the extent of this Anglicisation must not be exaggerated. The statute of 1362 was in fact written in the French language and had little immediate effect, and parliament was opened in that language as late as 1377. The Order of the Garter, though a distinctly English institution, included also foreign members such as John IV, Duke of Brittany and Sir Robert of Namur. Edward III – himself bilingual – viewed himself as legitimate king of both England and France, and could not show preferential treatment for one part of his domains over another.|$|E
