An important problem {{associated with the use}} of iopanoic acid for oral cholecystography is the frequent failure to produce diagnostically suitable gallbladder opacification with the initial dose [1]. This failure necessitates repeating the examination to avoid false-positive diagnoses since many of these patients subsequently are shown not to have cholecystopathology or hepatic disorders [2]. lopanoic acid also suffers from the disadvantage of producing an appreciable incidence of side-effects such as diarrhea, nausea, and transitory impairment of hepatic and renal functio...|$|E
