500|$|Lauren has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. Canning praised Fink's {{performance in the}} episode [...] "Silly Love Songs", as well as Lauren's dialog. Lisa Respers France of CNN commented that she is beginning to really like Lauren, noting: [...] "for me Lauren represents how Ryan Murphy is {{able to take the}} concept of the outcast, flip it on its ear and shove it back <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>faces</b> with a side order of fabulousness." [...] Reiter felt that in [...] "Comeback", new characters Lauren and Sam [...] "managed to shine".|$|E
500|$|Because of her tour of North Vietnam {{during wartime}} and the {{subsequent}} rumors circulated about her visit, resentment against her among some veterans and currently serving U.S. military still exists. For example, when U.S. Naval Academy cadets, {{who had not yet}} been born when Fonda protested against the Vietnam war, shouted out [...] "Goodnight, Jane Fonda!", the company replied [...] "Goodnight, bitch!" [...] This practice has since been prohibited by the academy's Plebe Summer Standard Operating Procedures. In 2005, Michael A. Smith, a U.S. Navy veteran, was arrested for disorderly conduct in Kansas City, Missouri, after he spat chewing tobacco in Fonda's face during a book-signing event for her autobiography, My Life So Far. He told reporters that he [...] "consider it a debt of honor", adding [...] "she spit <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>faces</b> for 37 years. It was absolutely worth it. There are a lot of veterans who would love to do what I did." [...] Fonda refused to press charges.|$|E
2500|$|Wilson {{seemed to}} have won over the middle classes, but had little impact on the largely ethnic working classes and the deeply isolationist farmers. Congress still refused to budge, so Wilson {{replaced}} Garrison as Secretary of War with Newton Baker, the Democratic mayor of Cleveland and an outspoken opponent of preparedness. The upshot was a compromise passed in May 1916, as the war raged on and Berlin was debating whether America was so weak it could be ignored. The Army was to double in size to 11,300 officers and 208,000 men, with no reserves, and a National Guard that would be enlarged in five years to 440,000 men. Summer camps on the Plattsburg model were authorized for new officers, and the government was given $20 million to build a nitrate plant of its own. Preparedness supporters were downcast, the antiwar people were jubilant. The United States would now be too weak to go to war. Colonel Robert L. Bullard privately complained that [...] "Both sides [...] treat us with scorn and contempt; our fool, smug conceit of superiority has been exploded <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>faces</b> and deservedly.". The House gutted the naval plans as well, defeating a [...] "big navy" [...] plan by 189 to 183, and scuttling the battleships. The battle of Jutland (May 31/June 1, 1916) saw the main German High Seas Fleet engage in a monumental yet inconclusive clash with the far stronger Grand Fleet of the Royal Navy. Arguing this battle proved the validity of Mahanian doctrine, the navalists took control in the Senate, broke the House coalition, and authorized a rapid three-year buildup of all classes of warships. A new weapons system, naval aviation, received $3.5 million, and the government was authorized to build its own armour-plate factory. The very weakness of American military power encouraged Berlin to start its unrestricted submarine attacks in 1917. It knew this meant war with America, but it could discount the immediate risk because the US Army was negligible and the new warships would not be at sea until 1919 by which time the war would be over, Germany thought, with Germany victorious. The notion that armaments led to war was turned on its head: refusal to arm in 1916 led to war in 1917.|$|E

6000|$|There {{were three}} friends that {{spoke of the}} dead-- The strong man fights but the sick man dies-- 'And would he were here with us now,' they said, 'The sun <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>face</b> and the wind <b>in</b> <b>our</b> eyes.' ...|$|R
60|$|Soft <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>face,</b> {{blew the}} blessed breezes of Omi, {{stirring}} the leaves overhead; while, here and there, through the trees, showed the idol-bearers {{of the royal}} retreat, hand in hand, linked with festoons of flowers. Still beyond, on a level, sparkled the nodding crowns of the kings, like the constellation Corona-Borealis, the horizon just gained.|$|R

60|$|We shook our heads. No doubt <b>our</b> {{disappointment}} showed <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>face.</b> It often does. We {{felt that}} it was altogether right and wholesome that our great novels of to-day should be written in this fashion with the help of goats, dogs, hogs and young bulls. But we felt, too, that it was not for us.|$|R
60|$|This evening, {{however, they}} had evidently made a mistake, and {{had put the}} wind round at our back instead of <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>face.</b> We kept very quiet about it, and got the sail up quickly before they found it out, and then we spread {{ourselves}} about the boat in thoughtful attitudes, and the sail bellied out, and strained, and grumbled at the mast, and the boat flew.|$|R

60|$|Again {{the wind}} began to blow <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>faces,</b> {{and the snow}} fell faster, but the {{violence}} of the storm seemed to encourage our horse, for his pace was now greatly increased.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Chipperton jumped {{right up}} {{and opened the}} door. When he saw Rectus and me {{standing}} there, he must have seen <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>faces</b> that something was the matter, for he instantly asked: ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the silent}} country, when {{the trees and}} hedges loom dim and blurred against the rising night, and the bat's wing flutters <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>face,</b> and the land-rail's cry sounds drearily across the fields, the spell sinks deeper still into our hearts. We seem in that hour to be {{standing}} by some unseen death-bed, and in the swaying of the elms we hear the sigh of the dying day.|$|R
60|$|Full <b>in</b> <b>our</b> flushed <b>faces,</b> {{before the}} last tinkle of falling {{fragments}} had died away, there came the wholesome breath of the wind, blowing strong and sweet.|$|R
30|$|It is also {{interesting}} {{for us to}} implement MS-EGM into a digital hardware circuit. This is because the EGM <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>face</b> detection algorithm is developed by modifying the EGM for face recognition improved into the digital hardware [41]. It can also expect that the EGM-specific integrated circuit will be developed for parallel processing for detection and recognition of a face. Such a system must be definitely compact and simplified, compared to the system integrated with several individual functions.|$|R

60|$|Drummle laughed outright, and sat {{laughing}} <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>faces,</b> {{with his}} hands in his pockets and his round shoulders raised; plainly signifying that it was quite true, and that he despised us as asses all.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now I am afeared," [...] said Eric to Skallagrim, as {{they stood}} in {{darkness}} upon the ship: [...] "the gale blows from behind us, and yet the mist drives fast <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>faces.</b> What comes now?" ...|$|E
5000|$|During {{a concert}} in Palermo, Italy in 1982, a riot {{occurred}} during [...] "Cocaine Decisions" [...] in which the police shot teargas into the crowd. Zappa was reported stating [...] "We played {{for an hour and}} a half with tear-gas <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>face</b> and everything else, and when it was all over we went off stage and we were trapped inside this place". The riot inspired the back cover of the album The Man From Utopia.|$|R

60|$|I {{bought a}} special edition, which a newsboy was brandishing <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>faces,</b> and, turning down the leading article, {{passed it on}} to my father. He glanced down at it and then looked up at me in blank amazement.|$|E
6000|$|... "I confess, it puzzles me. What {{if he has}} {{out only}} fifty feet? He could never get it in if we once started for him. And why does he come here anyway, flaunting his law-breaking <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>faces?</b> Right in our home town, too." ...|$|E

60|$|THE mild blue weather {{we enjoyed}} {{after leaving the}} Marquesas {{gradually}} changed as we ran farther south and approached Tahiti. In these generally tranquil seas, the wind sometimes blows with great violence; though, as every sailor knows, a spicy gale in the tropic latitudes of the Pacific is far different from a tempest in the howling North Atlantic. We soon found ourselves battling with the waves, while the before mild Trades, like a woman roused, blew fiercely, but still warmly, <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>face.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1910, Maria Konopnicka {{responded to}} the {{increasing}} persecution of Polish people by Germans by writing her famous song called Rota that instantly became a national symbol for Poles, with its sentence known to many Poles: The German will not spit <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>face,</b> nor will he Germanise our children. Thus, the German efforts to eradicate Polish culture, language, and people met not only with failure, but managed to reinforce the Polish national identity and strengthened efforts of Poles to re-establish a Polish state.|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{optimization}} method for the features used in face recognition. The particle swarm algorithm {{is used to}} select the optimum parameters for the Gabor filter which is employed <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>face</b> recognition algorithm. We generate 40 Gabor filters and determine one optimum filter parameter set from those by using the particle swarm optimization. The face recognition is performed by using only {{the output of the}} Gabor filter with optimum parameter set as well as the all 40 filter output feature set. The performance of the proposed method is presented by means of simulations...|$|R

60|$|Closed indeed. But {{so sharp}} were her tones I hadn't {{the courage to}} warn her that even Susan had read most of it.

60|$|The {{poor thing}} was mortally wounded; {{so much so}} that it could not even cry. It looked up with a very piteous {{expression}} <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>faces.</b> Placing its hand on its side, it coughed once or twice, then lying down on its back and stretching itself out quite straight, it closed its eyes and died.|$|E
60|$|When {{they were}} gone we looked {{out of the window}} again. Sir Henry had flung it open, and the cold night wind beat <b>in</b> upon <b>our</b> <b>faces.</b> Far away <b>in</b> the black {{distance}} there still glowed that one tiny point of yellow light.|$|R
50|$|As far as I'm concerned, {{this was}} the turning point {{of the civil rights}} movement. I'm {{absolutely}} convinced of that. Until then, despite every setback and disappointment and obstacle we had faced over the years, the belief still prevailed that the system would work, the system would listen, the system would respond. Now, for the first time, we had made our way to {{the very center of the}} system. We had played by the rules, done everything we were supposed to do, had played the game exactly as required, had arrived at the doorstep and found the door slammed <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>face.</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} image resolution on the error rates of a face verification system. We do not restrict ourselves to the face recognition algorithm only, but we also consider the <b>face</b> registration. <b>In</b> <b>our</b> <b>face</b> recognition system, the face registration is done by finding landmarks in a face image and subsequent alignment based on these landmarks. To investigate the effect of image resolution we performed experiments where we varied the resolution. We investigate {{the effect of the}} resolution on the face recognition part, the registration part and the entire system. This research also confirms that accurate registration is of vital importance to the performance of the face recognition algorithm. The results of <b>our</b> <b>face</b> recognition system are optimal on face images with a resolution of 32 × 32 pixels...|$|R
