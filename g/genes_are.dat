5|$|About 20,000 protein coding <b>genes</b> <b>are</b> {{expressed}} in human cells and 70% of these <b>genes</b> <b>are</b> {{expressed in}} the normal thyroid. Some 250 of these <b>genes</b> <b>are</b> more specifically {{expressed in the}} thyroid with about 20 genes being highly thyroid specific. The corresponding specific proteins are mainly involved in thyroid hormone synthesis, such as thyroglobulin, TPO and IYD, and expressed in follicular cells. Other proteins elevated in the thyroid are calcitonin related proteins such as CALCA and CALCB, expressed in the parafollicular c-cells.|$|E
5|$|About 20,000 protein-coding <b>genes</b> <b>are</b> {{expressed}} in human cells and nearly 70% of these <b>genes</b> <b>are</b> {{expressed in}} the normal esophagus. Some 250 of these <b>genes</b> <b>are</b> more specifically {{expressed in the}} esophagus with less than 50 genes being highly specific. The corresponding esophagus-specific proteins are mainly involved in squamous differentiation such as keratins KRT13, KRT4 and KRT6C. Other specific proteins that help lubricate the inner surface of esophagus are mucins such as MUC21 and MUC22. Many genes with elevated expression are also shared with skin and other organs that are composed of squamous epithelia.|$|E
5|$|Essential <b>genes</b> <b>are</b> the set {{of genes}} thought to be {{critical}} for an organism's survival. This definition assumes the abundant availability of all relevant nutrients {{and the absence of}} environmental stress. Only a small portion of an organism's <b>genes</b> <b>are</b> essential. In bacteria, an estimated 250–400 <b>genes</b> <b>are</b> essential for Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, which is less than 10% of their genes. Half of these <b>genes</b> <b>are</b> orthologs in both organisms and are largely involved in protein synthesis. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae the number of essential genes is slightly higher, at 1000 genes (~20% of their genes). Although the number is more difficult to measure in higher eukaryotes, mice and humans are estimated to have around 2000 essential genes (~10% of their genes). The synthetic organism, Syn 3, has a minimal genome of 473 essential genes and quasi-essential genes (necessary for fast growth), although 149 have unknown function.|$|E
30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  6 c, the {{comparison}} of RP and GP revealed that 794 <b>genes</b> <b>were</b> significantly up regulated and 555 <b>genes</b> <b>were</b> down regulated. The number of up regulated <b>genes</b> <b>was</b> more than down regulated genes. In these 1349 DEGs, 1285 <b>genes</b> <b>were</b> annotated at least in one database.|$|R
50|$|The human TERF1 <b>gene</b> <b>is</b> {{located in}} the {{chromosome}} 8 at 73,921,097-73,960,357 bp. Two transcripts of this <b>gene</b> <b>are</b> alternatively spliced products. The TERF1 <b>gene</b> <b>is</b> also known as TRF, PIN2 (Proteinase Inhibitor 2), TRF1, t-TRF1 and h-TRF1-AS.|$|R
40|$|Results: Analysis of immune-related gene {{expression}} profiles showed that 24 h after SARS-CoV infection, (i) IFN-alpha/beta-inducible and cathepsin/proteosome <b>genes</b> <b>were</b> down-regulated; (ii) the hypoxia/hyperoxia-related <b>genes</b> <b>were</b> up-regulated; and (iii) the TLR/TLR-signaling, cytokine/cytokine receptor-related, chemokine/chemokine receptor-related, the lysosome-related, MHC/chaperon-related, and fibrosis-related <b>genes</b> <b>were</b> differentially regulated. |$|R
5|$|A small {{fraction}} of the genes in an organism's genome control the organism's development. These <b>genes</b> <b>are</b> called the developmental-genetic toolkit. They are highly conserved among phyla, meaning that they are ancient and very similar in widely separated groups of animals. Differences in deployment of toolkit genes affect the body plan and the number, identity, and pattern of body parts. Most toolkit <b>genes</b> <b>are</b> parts of signalling pathways: they encode transcription factors, cell adhesion proteins, cell surface receptor proteins and signalling ligands that bind to them, and secreted morphogens that diffuse through the embryo. All of these help to define the fate of undifferentiated cells in the embryo. Together, they generate the patterns in time and space which shape the embryo, and ultimately form the body plan of the organism. Among the most important toolkit <b>genes</b> <b>are</b> the Hox genes. These transcription factors contain the homeobox protein-binding DNA motif, also found in other toolkit genes, and create the basic pattern of the body along its front-to-back axis.|$|E
5|$|About 1500 <b>genes</b> <b>are</b> {{linked to}} {{outcomes}} in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. These include both unfavorable genes, where high expression {{is related to}} poor outcome, for example C-Met and MUC-1, and favorable genes where high expression is associated with better survival, for example the transcription factor PELP1.|$|E
5|$|As of 2017, {{just under}} 20,000 protein-coding <b>genes</b> <b>are</b> {{seen to be}} {{expressed}} in the human, and some 400 of these <b>genes</b> <b>are</b> brain-specific. The data that has been provided on gene expression in the brain has fuelled further research {{into a number of}} disorders. The long term use of alcohol for example, has shown altered gene expression in the brain, and cell-type specific changes that may relate to alcohol use disorder. These changes have been noted in the synaptic transcriptome in the prefrontal cortex, and are seen as a factor causing the drive to alcohol dependence, and also to other substance abuses.|$|E
25|$|An {{expressed}} <b>gene</b> <b>is</b> preferentially located {{outside of}} its chromosome territory, but a closely linked, inactive <b>gene</b> <b>is</b> located inside.|$|R
50|$|In Homo sapiens, the NPRL3 <b>gene</b> <b>is</b> {{located at}} C16orf35. The <b>gene</b> <b>is</b> {{composed}} of 14 exons at 53 kbp in length. This <b>gene</b> <b>is</b> highly conserved in vertebrates which is upstream from the alpha globin gene cluster. Within the fifth intron of the <b>gene</b> there <b>is</b> a regulatory section of DNA HS-40 which regulates {{the expression of}} the alpha globin. This means that the <b>gene</b> C16orf35 <b>is</b> expressed in early erythrocytes accompanying hemoglobin production.|$|R
3000|$|... 805 and 198 <b>genes</b> <b>were</b> {{identified}} that were differentially expressed in leaves and roots, respectively. Another 71 <b>genes</b> <b>were</b> differentially expressed in both organs, {{in which more}} <b>genes</b> <b>were</b> up-regulated than down-regulated. In agreement with results obtained for other crops or from previous sunflower studies, we also observed that nine <b>genes</b> may <b>be</b> associated with the response of sunflower to drought.|$|R
5|$|Classic {{genome-wide}} {{linkage analysis}} has identified nine loci on different chromosomes associated with psoriasis. They are called psoriasis susceptibility 1 through 9 (PSORS1 through PSORS9). Within those loci are genes on pathways {{that lead to}} inflammation. Certain variations (mutations) of those <b>genes</b> <b>are</b> commonly found in psoriasis. Genome-wide association scans have identified other genes that are altered to characteristic variants in psoriasis. Some of these genes express inflammatory signal proteins, which affect cells in the immune system that are also involved in psoriasis. Some of these <b>genes</b> <b>are</b> also involved in other autoimmune diseases.|$|E
5|$|Essential genes include Housekeeping genes (critical {{for basic}} cell functions) {{as well as}} genes that are {{expressed}} at different times in the organisms development or life cycle. Housekeeping <b>genes</b> <b>are</b> used as experimental controls when analysing gene expression, since they are constitutively expressed at a relatively constant level.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{engineering}} {{is now a}} routine research tool with model organisms. For example, <b>genes</b> <b>are</b> easily added to bacteria and lineages of knockout mice with a specific gene's function disrupted are used to investigate that gene's function. Many organisms have been genetically modified for applications in agriculture, industrial biotechnology, and medicine.|$|E
5000|$|Another related <b>gene</b> <b>is</b> MKL1, {{which is}} also known as [...] "MAL". This <b>gene</b> <b>is</b> a {{cofactor}} of serum response factor.|$|R
50|$|An individual's own child, {{who carries}} {{one half of}} the individual's <b>genes,</b> <b>is</b> defined as one {{offspring}} equivalent. A sibling's child, who will carry one-quarter of the individual's <b>genes,</b> <b>is</b> 1/2 offspring equivalent. Similarly, a cousin's child, who has 1/16 of the individual's <b>genes,</b> <b>is</b> 1/8 offspring equivalent.|$|R
40|$|Xenopus laevis tadpole {{and adult}} beta-globin <b>genes</b> <b>were</b> {{injected}} into fertilized X. laevis eggs. Both injected <b>genes</b> replicated and <b>were</b> {{retained in the}} developing embryos with equal efficiency. Transcripts of the injected adult <b>gene</b> <b>were</b> detectable at gastrulation and reached a maximum level shortly thereafter. In contrast, transcripts of the injected tadpole <b>gene</b> <b>were</b> not detected until much later stages of development. The level of expression of both the injected <b>genes</b> <b>was</b> low compared {{with the level of}} expression of the chromosomal genes during erythropoiesis...|$|R
5|$|Hox genes {{determine}} where repeating parts, {{such as the}} many vertebrae of snakes, will grow in a developing embryo or larva. Pax-6, already mentioned, is a classic toolkit gene. Homeobox <b>genes</b> <b>are</b> also found in plants, implying they are common to all eukaryotes.|$|E
5|$|Reports {{show that}} both the nickel-induced {{activation}} of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1) and the up-regulation of hypoxia-inducible <b>genes</b> <b>are</b> caused by depletion of intracellular ascorbate. The addition of ascorbate to the culture medium increased the intracellular ascorbate level and reversed both the metal-induced stabilization of HIF-1- and HIF-1α-dependent gene expression.|$|E
5|$|Several Parkinson-related <b>genes</b> <b>are</b> {{involved}} in the function of lysosomes, organelles that digest cellular waste products. It {{has been suggested that}} some cases of PD may be caused by lysosome dysfunctions that reduce the ability of cells to break down alpha-synuclein.|$|E
25|$|A {{constitutive}} <b>gene</b> <b>is</b> a <b>gene</b> that <b>is</b> transcribed continually {{as opposed}} to a facultative <b>gene,</b> which <b>is</b> only transcribed when needed.|$|R
50|$|In melanocytic cells the EDNRB <b>gene</b> <b>is</b> {{regulated}} by the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor. Mutations in either <b>gene</b> <b>are</b> links to Waardenburg syndrome.|$|R

5|$|The chapter {{describes}} how <b>genes</b> <b>are</b> switched {{on and off}} in a precisely choreographed time sequence and 3-dimensional pattern in the developing embryo, and how the logic can be modified by evolution to create different animal bodies.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinct}} {{populations of}} loggerheads have unique characteristics and genetic differences. For example, Mediterranean loggerheads are smaller, on average, than Atlantic Ocean loggerheads. North Atlantic and Mediterranean loggerhead sea turtles are descendants of colonizing loggerheads from Tongaland, South Africa. South African loggerhead <b>genes</b> <b>are</b> still present in these populations today.|$|E
5|$|The {{field is}} characterised by some key concepts, which took {{biologists}} by surprise. One is deep homology, {{the finding that}} dissimilar organs such as the eyes of insects, vertebrates and cephalopod molluscs, long thought to have evolved separately, are controlled by similar genes such as pax-6, from the evo-devo gene toolkit. These <b>genes</b> <b>are</b> ancient, being highly conserved among phyla; they generate the patterns {{in time and space}} which shape the embryo, and ultimately form the body plan of the organism. Another is that species do not differ much in their structural genes, such as those coding for enzymes; what does differ is the way that gene expression is regulated by the toolkit genes. These <b>genes</b> <b>are</b> reused, unchanged, many times {{in different parts of the}} embryo and at different stages of development, forming a complex cascade of control, switching other regulatory genes as well as structural genes on and off in a precise pattern. This multiple pleiotropic reuse explains why these <b>genes</b> <b>are</b> highly conserved, as any change would have many adverse consequences which natural selection would oppose.|$|E
40|$|Upon {{exposure}} of Nitrosomonas europaea to chloroform (7 �M, 1 h), transcripts for 175 of 2, 460 <b>genes</b> <b>were</b> found {{at higher levels}} in treated cells than in untreated cells and transcripts for 501 <b>genes</b> <b>were</b> found at lower levels. With chloromethane (3. 2 mM, 1 h), transcripts for 67 <b>genes</b> <b>were</b> at higher levels and transcripts for 148 <b>genes</b> <b>were</b> at lower levels. Transcripts for 37 <b>genes</b> <b>were</b> at higher levels following both treatments and included genes for heat shock proteins, �-factors of the extracytoplasmic function subfamily, and toxinantitoxin loci.

50|$|Mutations in the RPGRIP1L <b>gene</b> <b>are</b> {{associated}} with Joubert syndrome and Meckel syndrome which {{belong to a}} group of developmental autosomal recessive disorders that are {{associated with}} cilium dysfunction. Mutations in this <b>gene</b> <b>are</b> also associated with nephronophthisis. Copy number variation affecting the <b>gene</b> <b>was</b> associated with schizophrenia in one study.|$|R
5|$|Although the {{structures}} of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 <b>genes</b> <b>are</b> very different, at least some functions are interrelated. The proteins made by both <b>genes</b> <b>are</b> essential for repairing damaged DNA (see Figure of recombinational repair steps). BRCA2 binds the single strand DNA and directly interacts with the recombinase RAD51 to stimulate strand invasion a vital step of homologous recombination. The localization of RAD51 to the DNA double-strand break requires the formation of BRCA1-PALB2-BRCA2 complex. PALB2 (Partner and localizer of BRCA2) can function synergistically with a BRCA2 chimera (termed piccolo, or piBRCA2) to further promote strand invasion. These breaks {{can be caused by}} natural and medical radiation or other environmental exposures, but also occur when chromosomes exchange genetic material during a special type of cell division that creates sperm and eggs (meiosis). Double strand breaks are also generated during repair of DNA cross links. By repairing DNA, these proteins play a role in maintaining the stability of the human genome and prevent dangerous gene rearrangements that can lead to hematologic and other cancers.|$|E
5|$|Cells cannot {{function}} if DNA damage corrupts {{the integrity}} and accessibility of essential information in the genome (but cells remain superficially functional when non-essential <b>genes</b> <b>are</b> missing or damaged). Depending {{on the type of}} damage inflicted on the DNA's double helical structure, a variety of repair strategies have evolved to restore lost information. If possible, cells use the unmodified complementary strand of the DNA or the sister chromatid as a template to recover the original information. Without access to a template, cells use an error-prone recovery mechanism known as translesion synthesis as a last resort.|$|E
5|$|During the 1940s and 1950s, McClintock {{discovered}} transposition {{and used}} it to demonstrate that <b>genes</b> <b>are</b> responsible for turning physical characteristics on and off. She developed theories to explain the suppression and expression of genetic information from one generation of maize plants to the next. Due to skepticism of her research and its implications, she stopped publishing her data in 1953.|$|E
