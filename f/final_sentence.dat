He then lowered them, descended from the podium, and began to head back to his seat as the stillness held.|$|E

25|$|The passage makes {{reference}} to Dante's Commedia, which {{can serve to}} confuse readers not familiar with that work.

25|$|The {{final act}} of the novel {{describes}} the defense against the Soviet Vyborg–Petrozavodsk Offensive, {{the withdrawal of the}} Finnish Army and the numerous losses that the company suffers in the summer of 1944, such as Koskela falling while disabling an attacking Soviet tank with a satchel charge and Hietanen losing his eyesight to a grenade strike and later dying when his ambulance is strafed by enemy aircraft. The War ends in the Moscow Armistice in September 1944. To immortalize the attitude and bonds the soldiers shared, the novel's <b>final</b> <b>sentence</b> describes the characters of the unit as dear brothers.|$|E
25|$|He evaded the <b>final</b> <b>sentence</b> {{and further}} {{criminal}} prosecution by relocating to London, where he occupied himself with schemes for exploiting parts of Rhodesia and Portuguese East Africa. In {{the interests of}} a gold mining company he formed, Peters explored the Fura district and Macombes country on the Zambezi river, where during 1899 he discovered ruins of cities and deserted gold mines of the medieval Kingdom of Mutapa, which he identified as the legendary ancient lands of Ophir. He returned during 1901 and gave an account of his explorations in Im Goldland des Altertums (The Eldorado of the Ancients) (1902). During 1905 he again visited the region between the rivers Zambezi and Save.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of the prosecutor's closing argument, Judge Akubzhanov invited Chikatilo back into the courtroom, before formally asking him whether he would like to make a final statement on his own behalf. In response, Chikatilo simply sat mute. Judge Akubzhanov then announced an initial date of 15 September for himself and the two official jurors to review the evidence and pass <b>final</b> <b>sentence</b> upon Chikatilo. (This date was later postponed until 14 October.) As court announced recess, the brother of Lyudmila Alekseyeva, a 17-year-old girl killed by Chikatilo in August 1984, threw a heavy chunk of metal at Chikatilo, hitting him in the chest. When security tried to arrest the young man, other victims' relatives shielded him.|$|E

25|$|One of the ‘B’ {{variants}} (Hill ‘6’) has a copyist’s gloss which {{proposes a}} meaning of ‘27,000 and 70 hides’ {{to make sense}} of the “27 and 70” reference: the “belong to it” refers to the entire list enumerated, a grand total. However, none of the ‘B’ lists can give us that total as they miss out between three and five burh. Therefore, the archetype of ‘B’ must have included these, as did that of ‘A’. However, by recalculating the mistranscriptions and supplying the missing burh figures from ‘A’ then the ‘restored’ total would be 28,671. Hill then turns to the second part of the <b>final</b> <b>sentence</b> “and 30 to the West Saxons”, this too is glossed as ‘30,000’ by the copyist ‘6’ so that it seems to refer to hides; but Hill proposes that it refers to the 30 burh; there are in fact 31 of these in the combined lists, but he then proposes that Buckingham (at 1600 hides) is in fact Mercian, that is not of “the West Saxons”, so is not included in the grand total. The adjusted total of 27,071 then concurs with the final ‘B’ sentence/statement.|$|E

The <b>final</b> <b>sentence</b> in the case was handed down in Rome in 1534, the same year the English Parliament passed the First Act of Supremacy. Henry VIII was particularly displeased by Campeggio's [...] "constant company with the emperor" [...] in the years prior to his verdict and Campeggio's rapidly growing income, having been granted the bishopric of Huesca and Jaca in 1530, and the bishopric of Mallorca in 1532, both by Charles V.|$|E
500|$|Although much of Gibson's {{reputation}} {{has remained}} rooted in Neuromancer, his work continued to evolve conceptually and stylistically. Despite adding the <b>final</b> <b>sentence</b> of Neuromancer, [...] "He never saw Molly again", {{at the last}} minute in a deliberate attempt to prevent himself from ever writing a sequel, he did precisely that with Count Zero (1986), a character-focused work set in the Sprawl alluded to in its predecessor. He next intended to write an unrelated postmodern space opera, titled The Log of the Mustang Sally, but reneged on the contract with Arbor House after a falling out over the dustjacket art of their hardcover of Count Zero. Abandoning The Log of the Mustang Sally, Gibson instead wrote Mona Lisa Overdrive (1988), which in the words of Larry McCaffery [...] "turned off the lights" [...] on cyberpunk literature. It was a culmination of his previous two novels, set in the same universe with shared characters, thereby completing the Sprawl trilogy. The trilogy solidified Gibson's reputation, with both later novels also earning Nebula and Hugo Award and Locus SF Award nominations.|$|E

500|$|Another {{difficult}} problem facing translators {{is how to}} deal with the author's intentional use of ambiguous idioms and words that have several meanings which results in phrasing that is difficult to translate precisely. One such instance is found in the first sentence of [...] "The Metamorphosis". English translators often render the word [...] as [...] "insect"; in Middle German, however, [...] literally means [...] "an animal unclean for sacrifice"; in today's German it means vermin. [...] It is sometimes used colloquially to mean [...] "bug"—a very general term, unlike the scientific [...] "insect". Kafka had no intention of labeling Gregor, the protagonist of the story, as any specific thing, but instead wanted to convey Gregor's disgust at his transformation. Another example is Kafka's use of the German noun [...] in the <b>final</b> <b>sentence</b> of [...] "Das Urteil". Literally, [...] means intercourse and, as in English, can have either a sexual or non-sexual meaning; in addition, it is used to mean transport or traffic. The sentence can be translated as: [...] "At that moment an unending stream of traffic crossed over the bridge". The double meaning of Verkehr is given added weight by Kafka's confession to Brod that when he wrote that final line, he was thinking of [...] "a violent ejaculation".|$|E
500|$|Bede {{died on the}} Feast of the Ascension, Thursday, 26 May 735, on {{the floor}} of his cell, singing [...] "Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit" [...] and was buried at Jarrow. Cuthbert, a disciple of Bede's, wrote a letter to a Cuthwin (of whom nothing else is known), {{describing}} Bede's last days and his death. According to Cuthbert, Bede fell ill, [...] "with frequent attacks of breathlessness but almost without pain", before Easter. On the Tuesday, two days before Bede died, his breathing became worse and his feet swelled. He continued to dictate to a scribe, however, and despite spending the night awake in prayer he dictated again the following day. At three o'clock, according to Cuthbert, he asked for a box of his to be brought, and distributed among the priests of the monastery [...] "a few treasures" [...] of his: [...] "some pepper, and napkins, and some incense". That night he dictated a <b>final</b> <b>sentence</b> to the scribe, a boy named Wilberht, and died soon afterwards. The account of Cuthbert does not make entirely clear whether Bede died before midnight or after. However, by the reckoning of Bede's time, passage from the old day to the new occurred at sunset, not midnight, and Cuthbert is clear that he died after sunset. Thus, while his box was brought at three o'clock Wednesday afternoon the 25th, {{by the time of the}} final dictation it might be considered already Thursday in that ecclesiastical sense, although the 25th in the ordinary sense.|$|E
