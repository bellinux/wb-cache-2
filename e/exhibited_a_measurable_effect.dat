40|$|We {{have been}} {{developing}} the cellulases of Thermobifida fusca {{as a model}} to explore the conversion from a free cellulase system to the cellulosomal mode. Three of the six T. fusca cellulases (endoglucanase Cel 6 A and exoglucanases Cel 6 B and Cel 48 A) have been converted in previous work by replacing their cellulose-binding modules (CBMs) with a dockerin, and the resultant recombinant “cellulosomized ” enzymes were incorporated into chimeric scaffolding proteins that contained cohesin(s) together with a CBM. The activities of the resultant designer cellulosomes were compared with an equivalent mixture of wild-type enzymes. In the present work, a fourth T. fusca cellulase, Cel 5 A, was equipped with a dockerin and intervening linker segments of different lengths to assess their contribution to the overall activity of simple one- and two-enzyme designer cellulosome complexes. The results demonstrated that cellulose binding {{played a major role}} in the degradation of crystalline cellulosic substrates. The combination of the converted Cel 5 A endoglucanase with the converted Cel 48 <b>A</b> exoglucanase also <b>exhibited</b> <b>a</b> <b>measurable</b> proximity <b>effect</b> for the most recalcitrant cellulosic substrate (Avicel). The length of the linker between the catalytic module and the dockerin had little, if any, effect on the activity. However, positioning of the dockerin on the opposite (C-terminal) side of the enzyme, consistent with the usual position of dockerins on most cellulosomal enzymes, resulted in an enhanced synergistic response. These results promote th...|$|R
40|$|As a {{model of}} flavin-dependent {{biological}} dehydrogenation, flavin-sensitized photodehydrogenation and photodecarboxylation were studied by variation of substrate, flavin, pH and solvent. Evidence for the following rules is given. (1) When the reactive site of a photosubstrate is an alpha-carbon atom of the type CH-CO 2 -, decarboxylation is preferred over dehydrogenation, whereas {{the reverse is true}} for the neutral CH-CO 2 H. (2) Consequently these reactions do not <b>exhibit</b> <b>a</b> <b>measurable</b> isotope <b>effect</b> with C 2 H-CO 2 -, in contrast with the findings by Penzer, Radda, Taylor & Taylor [(1970) Vitam. Horm. (N. Y.) 28, 441 [...] 466], which could not be reproduced. When the substate does not contain a carboxylate group, isotope effects occur, in verification of previous reports, e. g. for benzyl alcohol C 6 H 5 -C 2 H 20 H. (3) The mechanism of flavin-sensitized substrate photodecarboxylation is assumed to consist in a primary carbanion fixation at the flavin nucleus (position 4 a, 5 or 8) with concomitant liberation of CO 2. This step is followed by rapid fragmentation of the adduct CH-Fl-red., provided that the substrate contains a functional and electron-donating group X, e. g. X = OH, OCH 3 or NH 2 (but not NH 3 + !) in X CH-CO 2 -. (4) The minimal requirement for flavin-sensitized C-H dehydrogenation is the presence of a hydroxyl group. For example, methanol as substrate and solvent is dehydrogenated at pH sufficiently alkaline for detection of the presence of the active species CH 3 O-, whereas at more acidic pH substrate dehydrogenation is competing with flavin autophotolysis, which depends on the substituents in the flavin nucleus...|$|R
