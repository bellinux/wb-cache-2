When I think of the psychology behind what makes me purchase an artists album, it’s always a form of reciprocation. Almost like a token of appreciation after I experience the product. The reason I chose to charge $100 dollars each copy and only start with 1000 units is because I tailor making my music {{for those who are}} listening. it's not about stepping outside of what I’m known for in hopes of new discovery.
