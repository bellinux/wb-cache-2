500|$|To {{promote the}} album in Europe, Kiedis and Frusciante both agreed {{they would make}} the trip. However, it proved {{difficult}} for Frusciante to adapt to life outside of the mansion, after being in near-seclusion for almost 30 days. Kiedis recalled of the situation: [...] "He had such an outpouring of creativity while we were making that album that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> didn't know how to live life in tandem with that creativity." [...] It was also during this period when Frusciante began to experiment with heroin, which further compromised his mental stability. The European promotional trek took its toll on Frusciante, {{and he decided to}} return home when he and Kiedis reached London.|$|E
500|$|Renwick {{has stated}} that the {{production}} of any further Jonathan Creek specials will depend on reception to [...] "The Grinning Man", {{as well as his}} own schedule. Davies is amenable to reprising the lead role in future, stating: [...] "If David writes more, I'm happy to do them. Unless they turned up and they were awful - but it hasn't happened so far. And he wouldn't send me an awful one anyway. But I don't know if he will come up with another one. He always says that the writing is so difficult, I'm not sure it gives him any pleasure. But I think the shooting gave him a lot of pleasure this time. He was directing {{for the first time and}} <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> enjoyed it. So, we'll see." ...|$|E
500|$|Kyle Busch, who {{finished}} second, said, [...] "He {{was on a}} mission today, that's for sure. When Jeff Gordon has a good car {{and he has the}} opportunity to beat you, he's going to beat you. He's my hero. I've always watched him and what he's been able to accomplish over the years." [...] In the subsequent press conference, pole position winner, Edwards, stated his frustration at his accident, [...] "I’m not exactly sure what happened. I’ll have to talk to Kyle about it. I thought at first he was just frustrated and he turned left to get back in line and he didn’t know I was there, but I watched the tape and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> did get loose. He hit me hard and I was left with nothing. I got rammed to the infield." [...] Rick Hendrick, the owner of Hendrick Motorsports, expressed his enjoyment of winning the race, stating, [...] "When you're a champion like Jeff Gordon, you know you can still do it, (even) when people overlook you. He's been right there but he hasn't had that edge. I think we're {{going to see a lot}} of momentum out of that team right now." ...|$|E
5000|$|Olu Dara's cornet {{work was}} the first on-wax {{collaboration}} with his son.

According to Nas: [...] "I asked my dad {{to play on the}} end of it — I told him to play whatever comes to mind when <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> of me as a kid. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> <b>really</b> proud to see me coming up and really taking my life serious and doing what I want." ...|$|R

All those things that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> make people <b>really</b> appealing, and <b>he</b> tells it like it is. The money things, he doesn’t tend to pay you back, but I have a lot of friends like that. So I don’t find it that much of a mystery. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> House is a very attractive character. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> most people would want to be friends with him. Robert Sean Leonard ...|$|R
500|$|Lynsey {{was found}} dead by Brendan Brady (Emmett J. Scanlan). The death sparked a [...] "whodunit storyline" [...] with Mercedes in the frame for her murder. Digital Spy {{explained}} her motives stating, [...] "Mercedes has also become increasingly deranged in recent weeks and wanted to keep Lynsey quiet after she discovered the truth about her stalking of Mitzeee". A promotional image featuring Mercedes was later released by Hollyoaks which confirmed Mercedes as an official suspect in the mystery. Mercedes entered a relationship with Doctor Browning, who had previously paid her for sex, {{in an attempt to}} make Riley jealous. Smithwick told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that she [...] "was nervous about the union of the dark soul mates, Mercy and Browning, but their chemistry is so watchable - that story is pretty dark". Mercedes began to [...] "fall for the charms" [...] of Doctor Browning, believing she had [...] "landed on her feet" [...] when he invited her to a charity ball. Metcalfe commented that Mercedes began to think he could provide her with the WAG life style that she had always wanted. She added that Mercedes still had feelings for Riley and was [...] "being very sneaky" [...] in her attempts to win him back. She explained that Mercedes [...] "still wants Riley back but, as we know, when she has everything she desires, she still craves a bit of danger". Thompson elaborated on this, saying Mercedes [...] "thinks she wants the quiet life with Riley, but Dr Browning offers an exciting alternative for her, he knows what makes her tick, {{and the two of them}} are excited by how dangerous the other is". On Doctor Browning's feelings for Mercedes, Thompson said: [...] "he's fallen for her and will do whatever it takes to be with her. He thinks if he spends enough time with Mercy, he'll win her around". When Doctor Browning witnessed Riley kiss Mercedes [...] "it becomes a question of how much he can take" [...] and he decided he must [...] "make a quick move" [...] to prevent them reuniting. To do this he takes Mercedes to a shooting range, Thompson explained that there she [...] "realises there's an undeniable connection between them". He added that the couple are [...] "kindred spirits" [...] and Mercedes spending time with him made her rethink their relationship. Thompson said [...] "it seemed to be written in the stars that Mercedes and Riley will get back together - but Dr Browning won't let that happen" [...] and to do this he threatened Riley. Thompson claimed that due to Doctor Browning having incriminating evidence showing that Mercedes discharged herself at the time Lynsey was murdered it gives him [...] "real power, she thinks she's in control, but she might just be underestimating Dr Browning..." [...] Metcalfe said that she feels Doctor Browning is Mercedes soul mate, explaining that [...] "he gives as good as he gets and I think that's really good for my character". On who Mercedes loves more out of Doctor Browning and Riley, Metcalfe said [...] "it's Doctor Browning all the way for her, <b>i</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> took her by storm and she absolutely adores him". On 17 August 2012 during E4's first look episode it was revealed Doctor Browning had killed Lynsey. Hollyoaks official website said Doctor Browning's motives in killing Lynsey were [...] "presumably to protect Mercedes".|$|E
2500|$|Son Robert James Tatangelo (born ca. 1951) {{said that}} his father was [...] "always ... honest and {{straight}} forward with people, and that's what people counted on. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> did make a difference." [...] Daughter Linda T. McKinney remembered her father for his equal treatment of people: [...] "It didn't matter where you came from.

2500|$|Harrison Ford {{considers}} Deckard to be human. [...] "That was {{the main}} area of contention between Ridley and myself at the time," [...] Ford told an interviewer during a BBC One Hollywood Greats segment. [...] "I thought the audience deserved one human being on screen that they could establish an emotional relationship with. I thought I had won Ridley's agreement to that, but in fact I {{think he had a}} little reservation about that. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> wanted to have it both ways." [...] Scott suggests that Ford may have since changed his view, although Blade Runner 2049 director Denis Villeneuve claimed that Ford and Scott argue about the issue to this day. Other people involved in the movie's production who have expressed the view that Deckard is human include: David Snyder (art director), M. Emmet Walsh (who portrayed Bryant) and Rutger Hauer (who portrayed Roy Batty).|$|E

2500|$|Shortly afterwards, Tony begins dating Jeanne Benoit (Scottie Thompson) and {{is shown}} {{to be on the}} verge of a serious {{commitment}} for the first time within the series. His romance with Jeanne continues to progress throughout the year, and he remains tight-lipped about it when his colleagues notice the change in his behavior. When questioned about the effects this would have on Tony and Ziva's relationship, de Pablo commented, [...] "Am I just being jealous? I don't know. I still love him very much, but I've sort of thrown away that possibility because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> <b>really</b> struggling with some immense feelings for somebody else." [...] In an interview with Chicago Tribune, she clarified that Ziva [...] "does have feelings for DiNozzo," [...] but that she was uncertain that this would be addressed.|$|R

2500|$|Arrowverse {{executive}} producer Marc Guggenheim has stated, [...] "I {{would love to}} tackle [...] at some point. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> would fit <b>really</b> well in our little universe. So we talk about him a lot." ...|$|R
5000|$|Before {{the album}} was {{released}} frontman Travie McCoy stated [...] "It's just gonna be a real, real solid record. The demos we have now are just bananas, ...(Guitarist) Disashi is just a monster on the new stuff.

6000|$|... "He is {{the worst}} of them, anyhow," [...] Victor said. [...] "There is {{something}} straightforward about Danton. No doubt he is ambitious, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> his hatred of us all is real. He is a terrible enemy, and will certainly stick at nothing. He is ruthless and pitiless, but <b>I</b> do not <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is double-faced. Robespierre is ambitious too, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is <b>really</b> acting according to his principles, such as they are. He would be pitiless too, but he would murder on principle.|$|R
6000|$|But {{for these}} trifles {{he had every}} reason to be {{satisfied}} with the progress of his plans. [...] "It's all right," [...] said Mrs. Hopkinson merrily; [...] "while you and Gashwiler have been working with your 'stock,' and treating the whole world as if it could be bribed, I've done more with that earnest, self-believing, self-deceiving, and perfectly pathetic Roscommon than all you fellows put together. Why, I've told his pitiful story, and drawn tears from the eyes of Senators and Cabinet Ministers. More than that, I've introduced him into society, put him in a dress coat,--such a figure!--and you know how the best folk worship everything that is outre as the sincere thing. I've made him a complete success. Why, only the other night, when Senator Misnancy and Judge Fitzdawdle were here, after making him tell his story,--which you know <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> believes,--I sang 'There came to the beach a poor Exile of Erin,' and my husband told me afterwards it was worth at least a dozen votes." ...|$|E
6000|$|This {{is a very}} savage {{piece of}} child-life, and Arick, for all his good-nature, {{is still a very}} savage person. I have told you how the black boys {{sometimes}} run away from the plantations, and live behind alone in the forest, building little sheds to protect them from the rain, and sometimes planting little gardens of food, {{but for the most part}} living the best they can upon the nuts of the trees and yams that they dig with their hands out of the earth. I do not think there can be anywhere in the world people more wretched than these runaways. They cannot return, for they would only return to be punished. They can never hope to see again their own land or their own people--indeed, I do not know what they can hope, but just to find enough yams every day to keep them from starvation. And in the wet season of the year, which is our summer and your winter, and the rain falls day after day far harder and louder than the loudest thunder-plump that ever fell in England, and the noon is sometimes so dark that the lean man is glad to light his lamp to write by, I can think of nothing so dreary as the state of these poor runaway slaves in the houseless bush. You are to remember, besides, that the people of this island hate and fear them because they are cannibals, sit and tell tales of them about their lamps at night in their own comfortable houses, and are sometimes afraid to lie down to sleep if they think there is a lurking black boy in the neighbourhood. Well now, Arick is of their own race and language, only he is a little more lucky because he has not run away; and how do you think that he proposed to help them? He asked if he might not have a gun. [...] "What do you want with a gun, Arick?" [...] was asked. And he said quite simply, and with his nice good-natured smile, that if he had a gun he would go up into the high bush and shoot black boys as men shoot pigeons. He said nothing about eating them, nor do <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> meant to. I think all he wanted was to clear the property of vermin as gamekeepers at home kill weasels, or housewives mice.|$|E

Dwight D. Eisenhower, 1968. 10. 1 The Economy as a Public Issue Although former President Eisenhower's {{forecast}} turned out to be wrong, numerous empirical studies show that macroeconomic perform-ance has an important impact on mass political support for elected officials. 1 Moreover, during recent years economic issues (principally inflation, the energy crisis, and unemployment) have overshadowed other problem areas as sources of public concern. Indeed, not since the Great Depression of the 1930 s and the immediate post-World War II reconversion scare has {{the state of the economy}} occupied such a salient place on the public agenda. As the Gallup Poll time-series data in figure 10. 1 show, in every year since completion of the American withdrawal from Vietnam more than 70 % of the public identified an economic issue as "the most important problem facing the country today.
