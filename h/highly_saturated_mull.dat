40|$|INTRODUCTION This {{working paper}} {{is the third}} {{in a series of}} three on the control of {{congestion}} at <b>highly</b> <b>saturated</b> signalised intersections. The other papers in the series are: WP 220 Control of Congestion at <b>Highly</b> <b>Saturated</b> Signalised Intersections: 1 - Survey Methods WP 221 Control of Congestion at <b>Highly</b> <b>Saturated</b> Signalised Intersections: 2 - Experiments at an Isolated Junction. After a brief explanation of the purpose of the study, and the part played by the Rama 4 experiments, this paper describes how the input data for the experiments was collected, updated and prepared for use in standard signal setting programs. The conduct of the actual experiment is then described followed by results and conclusions thereof...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a function which describes SiPM response in both small signal and <b>highly</b> <b>saturated</b> regimes. The function includes the reactivation of SiPM pixels during a single input light pulse, and results in an approximately linear increase of SiPM response in the <b>highly</b> <b>saturated</b> regime, as observed in real SiPMs. This article shows that the function can accurately describe the measured response of real SiPM devices {{over a wide range}} of signal intensities.

40|$|A recent paper {{suggests}} that Deep Neural Networks can {{be protected from}} gradient-based adversarial perturbations by driving the network activations into a <b>highly</b> <b>saturated</b> regime. Here we analyse such saturated networks and show that the attacks fail due to numerical limitations in the gradient computations. A simple stabilisation of the gradient estimates enables successful and efficient attacks. Thus, {{it has yet to}} be shown that the robustness observed in <b>highly</b> <b>saturated</b> networks is not simply due to numerical limitations. Comment: 4 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

30|$|The {{saturation}} attack, {{like the}} other attacks, has dependency on {{the contents of the}} image and the robustness measure applied to protect the watermark. The BER increase in Figure 13 a for high saturation values is due to the image Leaf and image Monkey (Figure 8) as shown in Figure 13 b and it is not attributed entirely to the incapability of list decoding of Reed-Solomon codes to decode the watermark for <b>highly</b> <b>saturated</b> images. For example, the original image Leaf is <b>highly</b> <b>saturated</b> and the modification of the saturation is quickly associated with R, G, and B values exceeding the bound.|$|R

40|$|Sugarcane bagasse was {{partially}} acetylated to enhance its oil-wicking ability in saturated environments while holding moisture for hydrocarbon biodegradation. The water sorption capacity of raw bagasse was reduced fourfold after treatment, which indicated considerably increased hydrophobicity {{but not a}} limited capability to hold moisture for hydrocarbon biodegradation. Characterization results by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and surface area analyzer suggested that treated bagasse exhibited enhanced hydrophobicity and surface area. Oil wicking test results indicate that treated bagasse is more effective in wicking oil from <b>highly</b> <b>saturated</b> environments than raw bagasse and suggest that application of this material in remediation of oil spills in <b>highly</b> <b>saturated</b> wetlands is promising...|$|R
