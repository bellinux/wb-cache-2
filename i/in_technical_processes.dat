The results are compared to available data of the structurally related S-HNL from Hevea brasiliensis (HbHNL), which is frequently applied <b>in</b> <b>technical</b> <b>processes.</b> Whereas substrate ranges are highly similar for all three enzymes, the stability of MeHNL with respect to higher temperature and low pH-values is superior to the other HNLs with alpha/beta-hydrolase fold.

The different inactivation pathways, deduced by means of circular dichroism, tryptophan fluorescence and static light scattering further support these results. Our data suggest different possibilities to stabilize MeHNL and AtHNL for technical applications: whereas the application of crude cell extracts is appropriate for MeHNL, AtHNL is stabilized by addition of polyols.

Therefore, modelling of freckle formation {{is an important}} task for optimizing industrial remelting processes. Practically all present freckle models {{are based on a}} critical Rayleigh number. They are inspired by the “classical” assumption that freckles are caused by an inversion of the liquid density in the semisolid region. Plumes of the lighter segregated liquid evolve through perturbation of the metastable layering of the melt in the mushy zone, a mechanism which motivates its description via Rayleigh criteria. But these models are not suitable for materials like Alloy 718 which do not show a liquid density inversion, but nevertheless are prone to freckle formation <b>in</b> <b>technical</b> remelting <b>processes.</b> <b>In</b> this paper, a criterion is developed which – instead of using a Rayleigh number – is based on the evaluation of the non-isothermal component of an instantaneous down-hill flow of heavy segregated melt in a melt pool with axial symmetry. With knowledge of the exact pool geometry and the shape and properties of the mushy zone, the occurrence of freckles can be predicted. The model is applied to a technical ESR casting for which temperature fields and microstructural parameters have been obtained using CFD and 3 D phase-field modelling, respectively.

40|$|Abstract—Supervision systems play an {{important}} role in industry mainly due to the increasing demand for product quality and high efficiency, and to the growing integration of automatic control systems <b>in</b> <b>technical</b> <b>processes.</b> In fact, the supervision system has a great number of components and interconnections, and it is difficult to describe and understand its behavior. Furthermore, the supervision system in industrial plants, implemented in supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) software, must undertake, at least, the following three main tasks: monitoring, control and fault tolerance. So it can be classified as a complex system. The objective of this paper is to show interests of the use of functional analysis techniques such as SADT (Structured Analysis and Design Technique) and SA-RT (Structured Analysis Real Time) for the design of supervisory systems. This is why we present a general model of analysis and supervision of production systems.

Reconstructing how iron was managed is an important way to understand political and socioeconomic issues in pre-modern state-level societies.

40|$|The {{contamination}} of wastewater with toxic heavy metal compounds {{is a complex}} problem. The removal of these contaminants has received much attention in recent years. Heavy metal contamination should be removed at source {{in order to avoid}} pollution of natural waters and subsequent metal accumulation in the environment. Process wastewaters contaminated with heavy metals result from various industrial activities, mainly the metallurgical industry, breweries, production of viscose fibres and coal-fired power stations. Practically all metallurgical activities, but also many other industrial processes are point sources of emission. The maximum permissible concentrations of pollutants in wastewaters for discharges into surface waters or sewage systems are laid down in national, European, and international guidelines. It is reasonable to expect that these discharge limits will be lowered in future. For this reason, the further development of existing processes and the investigation of new processes for the reduction of heavy metals in wastewaters are of special importance. At present, chemical precipitation is the main process for the removal of heavy metal contaminations from wastewater, followed by other conventional methods such as chemical oxidation or reduction, ion exchange, filtration or electrochemical treatment. A recent approach is the use of biomasses as adsorbents for the removal of heavy metals from the aqueous phase. For more than ten years, international efforts have been made to investigate the basic principles of the biosorption of heavy metals and to apply such biosorbents <b>in</b> <b>technical</b> <b>processes</b> of wastewater treatment.

This {{research project}} {{is the result of}} an ¡nterest in methods that help measure the environmental sustainability of construction works and in particular tools that assess a building's environmental sustainability, considering that "what is not measured cannot be improved", William Thomson. In the current building industry sector, based on the systematic use of materials in open cycles, these tools should play an important role as they recognise the environmental characteristics of buildings through numerical assessments. They can serve 10 increase the efficiency of the use of resources in building works and consequently promote a reduction of their impact. Moreover, they may move the world of construction 10 wards the implementation of new technical models that are in greater harmony with the biosphere. After an initial analysis of the various types of measurement tools, a selection of the most important options is presented. Subsequently. information on the theory of indicator systems is provided. This information has been the basis for developing an overall theoretical framework for the analysis of these tools, based on criteria and sub-criteria, organised in two parts: a. The first part intends to discover the principies of sustainability upon which the existing tools are based. Subsequently, these principies are compared to the need to close material cycles used <b>in</b> <b>technical</b> <b>processes</b> to achieve habilability. b. The second part aims to discover how efficiently these tools are in guiding their users towards sustainable behaviour and how they contribute to moving the sector in this direction. The paper states that for a tool to be efficient it needs possess various characteristics grouped into five areas with related objectives, termed "criteria", which are as follows: 1. Modelling: this criteria specifies that the tool must include all the key areas for the sustainability of a building, but with the minimum number of indicators required. 2. Representativeness of the valuation: this criteria includes the features required for a tool to be able to offer a correct assessment that is representative of the level of sustainability for the building under assessment. 3. Use and economic viability: this criteria requires that these tools, with the purpose of dissemination and good reception, are economically accessible and easy to undersland. 4. Clarity about the the of user, scope and objectives: this criteria requires that the structure and content of the tool are adjusted to the level of knowledge of the user; to the local climate; to the geographical. social and technological context where the building is located. 5. Ability to guide the improvement of the environmental quality of the building: this criteria emphasises the potential of the tools as means of support in project development. These criteria have been applied to analyse the following widely used tools : CASBEE. GBTOOL. ITACA and LEED with the intention of checking the capacity of the proposed analysis system to detect {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the above tools. This investigation process has given rise to a number of proposals on the structure and content of the above tools in the form of recommendations, aimed primarily at the technicians in charge of drafting them, to assist them in the task of guiding the building sector toward practices that close material cycles.
