Shiva has many benevolent and fearsome depictions. In benevolent aspects, he {{is depicted as}} an omniscient Yogi who lives an ascetic life on Mount Kailash {{as well as a}} householder with wife Parvati and his two children, Ganesha and Kartikeya.

Although <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> listed as a saint, this is not confirmed by Bede and it has recently been argued that such assertions are incorrect.|$|E

5|$|In terukkuttu performances, at {{the time}} of Aravan's sacrifice, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> {{compared}} to Puru and Bhishma, characters in the Mahabharata who gave up their youth and sexual fulfilment for the sake of their respective fathers, Yayati and Santanu. In the drama, after acquiring Aravan's approval, Krishna approaches Aravan's mother, Ulupi—Nagakanni or Nakakanni ("Serpent maiden") in Tamil, for her consent. At first she strongly opposes her son's proposed sacrifice but finally relents when Aravan appeals to her, explaining that he belongs to Kali alone.|$|E

The Ice King is a {{recurring}} antagonist of the series, and frequently steals princesses throughout Ooo; although <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> at odds with Finn and Jake, he is generally not a serious threat. He was formerly a human archaeologist named Simon Petrikov who discovered a magic crown that gives him magical ice powers but eroded his memory and made him go insane.

The icon {{represents}} Vishnu as the Supreme Being. He has a human head, a lion head, a boar head and a demonic head.

Generally, Vaikuntha Chaturmurti is shown standing but sometimes he is depicted seated on his vahana (mount) Garuda.|$|E

5|$|Wyatt Berry Stapp Earp (March 19, 1848– January 13, 1929) was an American Old West gambler, {{a deputy}} sheriff in Pima County, and deputy town marshal in Tombstone, Arizona Territory, {{who took part}} in the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, during which lawmen killed three outlaw cowboys. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> mistakenly {{regarded}} as the central figure in the shootout in Tombstone, although his brother Virgil was Tombstone city marshal and deputy U.S. marshal that day, and had far more experience as a sheriff, constable, marshal, and soldier in combat.|$|E
5|$|After Pierce died, he mostly {{passed from}} the American consciousness, except {{as one of a}} series of presidents whose {{disastrous}} tenures led to civil war. Pierce's presidency is widely regarded as a failure; <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> described as one of the worst presidents in American history. The public placed him third-to-last among his peers in C-SPAN surveys (2000 and 2009). Part of his failure was in allowing a divided Congress to take the initiative, most disastrously with the Kansas–Nebraska Act. Although he did not lead that fight—Senator Douglas did—Pierce paid the cost in damage to his reputation. The failure of Pierce, as president, to secure sectional conciliation helped bring an end to the dominance of the Democratic Party that had started with Jackson, and led to a period of over seventy years when the Republicans mostly controlled national politics.|$|E

5|$|Alexander's legacy {{includes}} the cultural diffusion and syncretism which his conquests engendered, such as Greco-Buddhism. He founded some twenty cities that bore his name, most notably Alexandria in Egypt. Alexander's settlement of Greek colonists {{and the resulting}} spread of Greek culture in the east resulted in a new Hellenistic civilization, aspects of which were still evident in {{the traditions of the}} Byzantine Empire in the mid-15th century AD and the presence of Greek speakers in central and far eastern Anatolia until the 1920s. Alexander became legendary as a classical hero in the mold of Achilles, and he features prominently in the history and mythic traditions of both Greek and non-Greek cultures. He became the measure against which military leaders compared themselves, and military academies throughout the world still teach his tactics. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> ranked among the most influential people in history.|$|E

Because of his diminutive stature, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> compared to another undersized Dallas basketball player, Spud Webb.|$|E
5|$|Bulgarian {{historians have}} had mostly {{negative}} assessments of Ivan Shishman. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> viewed as having intruded onto the throne {{due to the}} intrigues {{of his mother and}} thus taking the place of the rightful successor, his elder brother Ivan Sratsimir. This eventually resulted in the division of the country {{on the eve of the}} Ottoman invasion. There are no direct historical sources to suggest any significant attempts by Ivan Shishman to fight off the Turks. The inconsistent policy of Ivan Shishman has been described as revealing his weakness and inability to cope with the situation. His rule, however, was still remembered in the 16th century. In a treaty signed in 1519 between the Ottoman sultan Selim I and Louis II of Hungary, some of the lands in question were referred to as terra cesaris Sysman, “the land of emperor Shishman”.|$|E
