This reduces the computational cost but, for very small filter kernels, point sampling the Gaussian function with very few samples leads to a large error.

25|$|Smoothing, or spatial filtering, is {{the idea}} of {{averaging}} the intensities of nearby voxels to produce a smooth spatial map of intensity change across the brain or region of interest. The averaging is often done by convolution with a <b>Gaussian</b> <b>filter,</b> which, at every spatial point, weights neighboring voxels by their distance, with the weights falling exponentially following the bell curve. If the true spatial extent of activation, that is the spread of the cluster of voxels simultaneously active, matches the width of the filter used, this process improves the signal-to-noise ratio. It also makes the total noise for each voxel follow a bell-curve distribution, since adding together a large number of independent, identical distributions of any kind produces the bell curve as the limit case. But if the presumed spatial extent of activation does not match the filter, signal is reduced.|$|E

This paper introduces a new <b>filter</b> called the <b>Gaussian</b> particle <b>filter</b> 1. It {{is based on}} the particle filtering concept, and it approximates the posterior distributions by single Gaussians, similar to <b>Gaussian</b> <b>filters</b> like the extended Kalman filter and its variants. It is shown that under the Gaussianity assumption, the <b>Gaussian</b> particle <b>filter</b> is asymptotically optimal in the number of particles and, hence, has much-improved performance and versatility over other <b>Gaussian</b> <b>filters,</b> especially when nontrivial nonlinearities are present. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the versatility and improved performance of the <b>Gaussian</b> particle <b>filter</b> over conventional <b>Gaussian</b> <b>filters</b> and the lower complexity than known particle filters.

For instance, the bilateral filter, cross bilateral filter and non-local means filter fall under the broad umbrella of high-dimensional <b>Gaussian</b> <b>filters.</b> Recent algorithmic advances therein have demonstrated that by relying on a sampled representation of the underlying space, one can obtain speed-ups of orders of magnitude over the naïve approach.

The bilateral filter introduces spurious detail on the road at color edges—e. g. the center divider and the shadows on the road. High-dimensional <b>Gaussian</b> <b>filters,</b> most notably the bilateral filter, are important tools for many computer graphics and vision tasks. In recent years, a number of techniques for accelerating their evaluation have been developed by exploiting the separability of these Gaussians.
