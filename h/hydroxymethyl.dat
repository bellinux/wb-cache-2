5|$|This {{does not}} appear to be the entire story. Four {{modifications}} to the cytosine residues in human DNA have been reported. These modifications are the addition of methyl (CH3)-, <b>hydroxymethyl</b> (CH2OH)-, formyl (CHO)- and carboxyl (COOH)- groups. These modifications are through to have regulatory functions.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that imidazoles that have <b>hydroxymethyl</b> and carboxy groups at the 4- and 5 position, possessed potent antagonistic activity, caused by the hydrogen bonding and hydrophilicity of the <b>hydroxymethyl</b> group.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} pathway, glycine is {{degraded}} in two steps. The {{first step is}} the reverse of glycine biosynthesis from serine with serine <b>hydroxymethyl</b> transferase. Serine is then converted to pyruvate by serine dehydratase.|$|E
25|$|Zirconium-catalyzed carboalumination of alkynes by trimethylalane is a {{convenient}} method for accessing substituted alkenylalanes stereoselectively. Upon exposure to aldehydes and ketones, alkenylalanes form secondary or tertiary allylic alcohols. Formaldehyde {{is a useful}} reagent in this context for {{the introduction of a}} <b>hydroxymethyl</b> unit.|$|E
25|$|Irbesartan was {{developed}} by Sanofi Research and is longer acting than valsartan and losartan and it has an imidazolinone ring where a carbonyl group functions as a hydrogen bond acceptor instead of the <b>hydroxymethyl</b> group in losartan. Irbesartan is a non-competitive inhibitor.|$|E
25|$|Two {{molecules}} of dALA are then combined by porphobilinogen synthase to give porphobilinogen (PBG), which contains a pyrrole ring. Four PBGs are then combined through deamination into <b>hydroxymethyl</b> bilane (HMB), which is hydrolysed {{to form the}} circular tetrapyrrole uroporphyrinogen III. This molecule undergoes a number of further modifications. Intermediates are used in different species to form particular substances, but, in humans, the main end-product protoporphyrin IX is combined with iron to form heme. Bile pigments are the breakdown products of heme.|$|E
25|$|The {{conversion}} of CO to alkanes involves hydrogenation of CO, the hydrogenolysis (cleavage with H2) of C–O bonds, {{and the formation}} of C–C bonds. Such reactions are assumed to proceed via initial formation of surface-bound metal carbonyls. The CO ligand is speculated to undergo dissociation, possibly into oxide and carbide ligands. Other potential intermediates are various C1 fragments including formyl (CHO), hydroxycarbene (HCOH), <b>hydroxymethyl</b> (CH2OH), methyl (CH3), methylene (CH2), methylidyne (CH), and hydroxymethylidyne (COH). Furthermore, and critical to the production of liquid fuels, are reactions that form C–C bonds, such as migratory insertion. Many related stoichiometric reactions have been simulated on discrete metal clusters, but homogeneous Fischer–Tropsch catalysts are poorly developed and of no commercial importance.|$|E
2500|$|Several substituents {{have been}} tried at the 4- and 5- {{positions}} on the imidazole ring. The chloro and <b>hydroxymethyl</b> groups connected to these positions in losartan are probably not of much importance in receptor binding since the other ARBs do not possess these functional groups and have comparable or better binding affinities than losartan. Irbesartan has a carbonyl group at the 5-position, functioning as a hydrogen bond acceptor {{in place of the}} <b>hydroxymethyl</b> group of losartan, resulting in a longer binding to the receptor.|$|E
2500|$|Formaldehyde {{is a good}} electrophile. With good nucleophiles such as thiols, amines, {{and even}} amides, no acid {{catalyst}} is required. [...] The resulting <b>hydroxymethyl</b> derivatives typically react further. [...] Thus amines give hexahydro-1,3,5-triazines. [...] Similarly, when combined with hydrogen sulfide, it forms trithiane.|$|E
2500|$|The second {{involves}} the use of dimethyl phosphite in a one-pot synthesis. [...] Glycine and paraformaldehyde are reacted in a suitable organic solvent (typically triethylamine and methanol) to produce bishydroxymethylglycine, (HOCH2)2NCH2COOH. [...] Dimethyl phosphite is then introduced and work-up with hydrochloric acid cleaves the <b>hydroxymethyl</b> group from the nitrogen atom whilst heating speeds the hydrolysis of both phosphate ester linkages.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hydroxymethyl</b> in {{the field}} of chemistry, {{particularly}} in organic chemistry, is the name for a substituent with the structural formula -CH2-OH. The <b>hydroxymethyl</b> group consists of a methylene bridge (-CH2- unit) bonded to a hydroxy (-OH) group. This makes the <b>hydroxymethyl</b> group an alcohol. The <b>hydroxymethyl</b> group has the identical chemical formula with the methoxy group (-O-CH3) that differs only in the attachment site and orientation {{to the rest of the}} molecule. However, their chemical properties are different.|$|E

50|$|Similar {{reactions}} {{occur when}} THPC is treated with acrylic acid; only one <b>hydroxymethyl</b> group is displaced, however.|$|E
5000|$|Tris(hydroxymethyl)phosphine {{can also}} be used to {{synthesize}} the heterocycle, N-boc-3-pyrroline by ring-closing metathesis using Grubbs' catalyst (bis(tricyclohexylphosphine)benzylidineruthenium dichloride [...] ). N-Boc-diallylamine is treated with Grubbs' catalyst, followed by tris(hydroxymethyl)phosphine. The carbon-carbon double bonds undergo ring closure, releasing ethylene gas, resulting in N-boc-3-pyrroline.The <b>hydroxymethyl</b> groups on THPC undergo replacement reactions when THPC is treated with α,β-unsaturated nitrile, acid, amide, and epoxides. For example, base induces condensation between THPC and acrylamide with displacement of the <b>hydroxymethyl</b> groups. (Z = CONH2) ...|$|E
50|$|It is {{generated}} from aminolevulinate (ALA) by the enzyme ALA dehydratase. PBG is then converted into <b>hydroxymethyl</b> bilane by the enzyme porphobilinogen deaminase, {{also known as}} hydroxymethylbilane synthase.|$|E

50|$|In {{chemical}} terms, bilins are linear {{arrangements of}} four pyrrole rings (tetrapyrroles). In human metabolism, bilirubin is a breakdown product of heme. <b>Hydroxymethyl</b> bilane {{is a major}} anabolic product, from the biosynthetic reaction of porphobilinogen (PBG) and uroporphyrinogen I synthase (known as porphobilinogen deaminase).|$|E
50|$|Phenolic, amino and furan resins all cure by {{polycondensation}} {{involving the}} release of water and heat, with cure initiation and polymerisation exotherm control influenced by curing temperature, catalyst selection/loading and processing method/pressure - the degree of pre-polymerisation and level of residual <b>hydroxymethyl</b> content in the resins determine the crosslink density.|$|E
5000|$|Imidazolidinyl urea was poorly {{characterized}} {{until recently}} {{and the single}} Chemical Abstracts Service structure assigned to it is probably not the major one in the commercial material.

5000|$|EC 2.1 {{includes}} {{enzymes that}} transfer single-carbon groups. This category consists of transfers of methyl, <b>hydroxymethyl,</b> formyl, carboxy, carbamoyl, and amido groups. Carbamoyltransferases, as an example, transfer a carbamoyl group from one molecule to another. Carbamoyl groups follow the formula NH2CO.

50|$|Base-catalysed phenol-{{formaldehyde}} resins {{are made}} with a formaldehyde to phenol ratio of greater than one (usually around 1.5). These resins are called resoles.
