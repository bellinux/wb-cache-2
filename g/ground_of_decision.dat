60|$|The {{simplest}} expedient {{which can}} be imagined for keeping the wages of labor up to the desirable point would be to fix them by law; and this is virtually the object aimed at {{in a variety of}} plans which have at different times been, or still are, current, for remodeling the relation between laborers and employers. No one, probably, ever suggested that wages should be absolutely fixed, since the interests of all concerned often require that they should be variable; but some have proposed to fix a minimum of wages, leaving the variations above that point to be adjusted by competition. Another plan, which has found many advocates among the leaders of the operatives, is that councils should be formed, which in England have been called local boards of trade, in France “conseils de prud’hommes,” and other names; consisting of delegates from the work-people and from the employers, who, meeting in conference, should agree upon a rate of wages, and promulgate it from authority, to be binding generally on employers and workmen; the <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> being, not the state of the labor market, but natural equity; to provide that the workmen shall have reasonable wages, and the capitalist reasonable profits.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{the paper}} is {{to solve the problem}} of {{customer}} reduction due to the difficulty of parts sourcing which impacts production delay and delivery delay in SC networks. Furthermore, this paper is to suggest the new inventory policy of MTS in order {{to solve the problem of}} current inventory policy. In order to compare two policies, a LCD maker is selected as a case study and the real data for 2007 years is used for simulation input. The maker uses MTO policy for parts sourcing which has the problem of lead time even if it has some advantage of inventory cost. Based on current process. The simulation program of AS-IS model and TO-BE model using ARENA 10 version is developed for evaluation. In a result, the order number of two policies shows that MTO is 52 and MTS is 53. However the quantity of order shows big difference such that MTO is 168, 460 and MTS is 225, 106. Particularly, the lead time of new inventory policy shows much shorter that that of MTO such that MTO 100 is days and MTS is 16 days. In spite of short lead time by MTS policy, new policy has to take burden of inventory cost per year. Total inventory cost per year by MTS policy is US $ 11, 254 and each part inventory cost is that POL is US $ 1, 807, LDI is US $ 2, 166 and Panel is US $ 7, 281. The implication of the research is that the company has to consider the cost and the service simultaneously in deciding the inventory policy. In the paper, even if the optimal point of deciding is put into tactical area, the <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> is suggested in order to improve the problem in SC networks...|$|E

Many stakeholders are affected by the outcome <b>of</b> such <b>decisions.</b> Codes <b>of</b> conduct, board and school policies, and discipline meetings are often shrouded under secrecy, making the discipline process mysterious..; In this study I examined the process of moral reasoning. I sought to determine the extent to which school leaders were aware that they were involved in a process of moral reasoning, and ftirthermore, what kind of moral reasoning they practiced. As well, I investigated the ethical grounds and foundations underlying moral reasoning. Thus, in this study I probed the awareness of the process of moral reasoning and sought to find the ethical <b>grounding</b> <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> making. This qualitative study featured short field research. The process involved individual interviews with three different participants: school leaders of a public. Catholic, and an independent school. It found that each school leader practiced moral reasoning to varying degrees through the discipline process. It also explored the possible democratization of moral reasoning by linking to concepts such as fairness, due process, public accountability, and greater participation in the administering of discipline. This study has implications for practice, theory, and future research. The examination of school leaders as the primary focus for discipline matters opens the door to future research that could explore differences between the school systems and possibly other parties affected by moral reasoning in discipline cases...|$|R

40|$|Precedent poses a {{notoriously}} difficult problem for originalists. Some decisions – so-called super precedents – are so well baked into government that reversing them would wreak havoc. Originalists have been pressed to either acknowledge that their theory could generate major disruption or identify a principled exception to their insistence that judges {{are bound to}} enforce the Constitution’s original public meaning. The problem is especially acute for an originalist member of Congress. While the stylized process of adjudication narrows the questions presented to the Court, in Congress {{the question of a}} measure’s constitutionality is always on the table. And because framing constraints do not narrow the relevant and permissible <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> as they do in litigation, evaluating a bill’s constitutionality arguably requires analysis of every possible constitutional flaw. We argue that Congress may employ a working presumption that super precedents are constitutional and thereby refrain from re-examining them. Presuming that a super precedent is correct is different from endorsing its correctness. If the precedent is erroneous, the latter course gives priority to precedent rather than text. The former course, however, is a technique for avoiding the question whether the precedent is right or wrong. Congress may assume arguendo that well settled precedents are correct and focus its attention on questions that are politically salient. If the Court reconsiders super precedent in response to litigants, Congress does so in response to constituents. The responsibility for initiating a correction of constitutional error lies with the People. If the People want Congress to examine the soundness of constitutional precedent, they must convince it to do so...|$|R
