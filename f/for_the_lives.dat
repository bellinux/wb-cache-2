5|$|Before the 20th century, and in {{some cases}} as late as the 1940s, historians largely took ancient {{literary}} sources at face value as evidence <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> of women in the ancient world. In the middle of the 20th century this began to change. Early innovations in the study of women in ancient history began in France, as the Annales School began to take a greater interest in underrepresented groups. Robert Flacelière was an influential early author on women in Greece. Around the same time, feminist philosophy, such as Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex also examined the lives of women in the classical world.|$|E
5|$|His {{behaviour}} {{on campaign}} {{can only be}} described as perfectly honourable and at times humane, a trait which was illustrated during the French Revolutionary Wars, when he spared no effort to protect captured émigrés from the wrath of the Revolutionary radicals in the army. He also showed respect for occupied populations and never tolerated pillaging nor violence from his men. As a sign a gratitude, he was offered gifts several times but he was often seen refusing and sending them back. While on campaign in Tyrol, he was recorded to have accepted a large sum of money but he immediately distributed it to the local hospitals. Further evidence of his humanity was the care that he displayed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> and well-being of his men, whom he was always reluctant to sacrifice for the sake of glory.|$|E
5|$|Later {{that spring}} Bryant and Reed heeded Vorse's call {{to spend the}} warm season in Provincetown, Massachusetts, {{at the tip of}} Cape Cod, and {{to take part in the}} {{communal}} theater productions of the Provincetown Players. Others from the Village went as well and joined the group, organized in 1915 by George Cram Cook and his wife, Susan Glaspell, who hoped to produce plays that were both political and artistic. Among the works the group staged in 1916 were Bryant's The Game, in which characters named Life and Death play dice <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> of Youth (a poet) and Girl (a dancer). It appeared on the same bill as Not Smart by Wilbur Steele and Bound East for Cardiff by O'Neill.|$|E

5|$|Many congregations {{gathered}} in their churches upon hearing {{news of the}} attacks, volunteering {{to spend the night}} there to protect them from further attacks. The local Catholic leaders demanded a peaceful bandh on 15 September in and around the city of Mangalore, and as a response Catholic traders and transport owners closed their shops and stopped their vehicles. A memorandum was submitted to the district council at 10.30 am, seeking protection <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> and property of Christians. Prayers were to be held in all the 48 churches of the district on Wednesday, 17 September. On 6 October 2008, some 10,000 people from civil society and religious organisations organised a march to protest against the anti-Christian perpetrators of the attacks.|$|E
5|$|Norman Osborn has {{consistently}} been depicted with several unusual weaknesses {{related to his}} psychosis and to his personality. He suffers from manic depression, has a pronounced narcissistic personality disorder co-morbid with severe anti-social psychopathic traits, and in some depictions, a multiple-personality disorder. For some of his early appearances he and the Goblin were separate personalities; his Goblin side disdaining his human weaknesses, while his Norman Osborn persona was primarily motivated by his concern for Harry. Although his anger over his son's failing health as Norman helped to provoke his transformation back into the Goblin, this supposedly separate and more compassionate side of him never reappeared after he was believed dead. Norman is also highly sadistic, showing a complete lack of empathy <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> of innocent people who stand {{between him and his}} objectives. These weaknesses have often been referenced in stories featuring him and exploited by his enemies.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, {{employers}} {{in the service}} industry have justified unstable, part-time employment and low wages by playing down the importance of service jobs <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> of the wage laborers (e.g. just temporary before finding something better, student summer jobs etc.).|$|E

25|$|From the {{perspective}} of the PLO, Israel responded to the disturbances with excessive and illegal use of deadly force against demonstrators; behavior which, in the PLO's view, reflected Israel's contempt <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> and safety of Palestinians. For Palestinians, the widely seen images of Muhammad al-Durrah in Gaza on September 30, shot as he huddled behind his father, reinforced that perception.|$|E

25|$|John Paston (10 October 1421 – 21 or 22 May 1466), {{was the son}} of William Paston, Justice of the Common Pleas, and Agnes Berry. After {{he succeeded}} his father in 1444, his life was marked by {{conflict}} occasioned by a power struggle in East Anglia between William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk, and John Mowbray, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, and by his involvement in the affairs of his wife's kinsman, Sir John Fastolf. A number of his letters survive among the Paston Letters, a rich source of historical information <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> of the English gentry of the period.|$|E

All residents of this village were evacuated after the government designated it a no-entry zone. According to a Japanese government panel, authorities had shown no respect <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> and dignity of village people. One NISA official apologized for the failure and added that the panel had stressed the importance of disclosure; however, the mayor said that the information would have prevented the evacuation into highly polluted areas, and that apologies a year too late had no meaning.|$|E
25|$|Barbary corsairs led attacks upon American {{merchant}} shipping {{in an attempt}} to extort ransom <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> of captured sailors, and ultimately tribute from the United States to avoid further attacks, as they did with the various European states. Before the Treaty of Paris, which formalized the United States' independence from Great Britain, U.S. shipping was protected by France during the revolutionary years under the Treaty of Alliance (1778–83). Although the treaty does not mention the Barbary States in name, it refers to common enemies between both the U.S. and France. As such, piracy against U.S. shipping only began to occur {{after the end of the}} American Revolution, when the U.S. government lost its protection under the Treaty of Alliance.|$|E
25|$|For {{the life}} of Julius Caesar, the letters edited by his son, those {{subsequently}} published in 1620 by the President de Maussac, the Scaligerana, and his own writings are full of autobiographical matter, are the chief authorities. Jules de Bourousse de Laffore's Etude sur Jules César de Lescale (Agen, 1860) and Adolphe Magen's Documents sur Julius Caesar Scaliger et sa famille (Agen, 1873) add important details <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> of both father and son. The lives by Charles Nisard—that of Julius et Les Gladiateurs de la république des lettres, and that of Joseph Le Triumvirat littéraire au seizième siècle—are equally unworthy of their author and their subjects. Julius is simply held up to ridicule, while {{the life of}} Joseph is almost wholly {{based on the book}} of Scioppius and the Scaligerana.|$|E

25|$|Ben Ami's {{assessment}} was correct. On July 27 an official radio announcement said the High Commissioner, Alan Cunningham {{had given the}} order {{to carry out the}} executions, which were scheduled for July 29. The superintendent of Acre Prison, Major G.E.G. Charlton, refused to preside over the executions {{due to the fact that}} they were to be carried out in secret, rather than in the traditional way, with the execution date announced well in advance and the families of the condemned allowed to visit them prior to the event. He was subsequently relieved of his position. The Inspector of Prisons, Mr. Hackett, was appointed superintendent in his place, and he along with Andrew Clow, the superintendent of Nablus jail, would serve as the chief hangmen. On July 28, it was announced that the three would die the following day. The announcement cast a pall over the Yishuv. The Jewish Agency and Palestine's Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi Yitzhak Herzog made last-ditch appeals <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> of the men to be spared, but to no avail. The Irgun immediately reiterated its warning that the hostages would also die in response. British forces carried out unsuccessful, last-ditch searches in Jerusalem, Kfar Saba, and Ness Ziona for the two sergeants.|$|E
25|$|In {{a number}} of cases, Mackworth was closely {{involved}} in moves to move aside opponents of the régime, who came from diverse standpoints and were treated in often very different ways. On 8 March {{he was one of}} a committee of three deputed to examine the case of the Levellers' leader John Lilburne, detained by the government the previous year, although acquitted of all charges. Eight days later they recommended he be sent to Mount Orgueil Castle on Jersey. On 23 March he was put on a committee to investigate the dispute between Elizabeth, Countess Dirletoun, and a group of improvers concerned {{in the construction of the}} River Wey Navigation, headed by James Pitson. Lady Elizabeth was the widow of William Hamilton, 2nd Duke of Hamilton, who was killed at the Battle of Worcester. She had refused the compensation offered by the developers for building on her land and had been breaking down the banks of the river, finally demolishing a building that had been in use as a government powder magazine, claiming that she feared <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> of her family. As the scheme had been approved by Parliament and was clearly in the interests of trade, there was little chance that objectors would prevail, but the committee's recommendations were moderate. Pitson was granted an order protecting his investment and requesting the county authorities take more care to keep the peace. However, as Lady Dirlestoun would not accept £200, he was to pay her £10 10s. a year and then buy the land off her heirs. More generally, Mackworth was deputed to {{a number of}} committees dealing with censorship.|$|E
500|$|The {{major sources}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> {{of women in}} {{classical}} Athens are literary, political and legal, and artistic. [...] As women play {{a prominent role in}} much Athenian literature, it initially seems as though {{there is a great deal}} of evidence <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> and experiences of Athenian women. However, the surviving literary evidence is written solely by men: ancient historians have no direct access to the beliefs and experiences of Classical Athenian women. [...] It is because of this that John J. Winkler writes in The Constraints of Desire that [...] "most of our surviving documents simply cannot be taken at face value when they speak of women".|$|E
