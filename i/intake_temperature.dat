40|$|In a port fuel {{injection}} engine, Optimized kinetic process (OKP) technology is implemented to realize HCCI combustion with dual-{{fuel injection}}. The effects of <b>intake</b> air <b>temperature</b> on HCCI combustion and emissions are investigated. The results show that dual-fuel control prolongs HCCI combustion duration and improves combustion stability. Dual-fuel HCCI combustion needs lower <b>intake</b> air <b>temperature</b> than gasoline HCCI combustion, which reduces the requirements on heat management system. As <b>intake</b> air <b>temperature</b> decreases, air charge increases and maximum pressure rising rate decreases. When <b>intake</b> air <b>temperature</b> is about 55 ºC, HCCI combustion becomes worse and misfire happens. In fixed dual fuel content condition, HC and CO emission decreases as <b>intake</b> air <b>temperature</b> increases. The combination of dual-fuel injection and <b>intake</b> air <b>temperature</b> control can expand operation range of HCCI combustion...|$|R
40|$|Syngas, from biomass gasification, {{needs to}} be {{purified}} of condensible tars before {{being used as a}} fuel for spark ignition engines. A novel tar tolerant system is being developed, wherein a (Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition) HCCI engine is fueled by impure syngas at <b>intake</b> <b>temperatures</b> above the tar dew point, thus avoiding the condensation of tars and its consequent problems. This paper introduces the novel concept and studies the sensitivities of HCCI combustion to key context relevant issues such as the variations in the combustible composition (H 2 :CO ratio from 30 : 70 to 55 : 45 %), moisture (upto 12 % by volume) and tars (from 3 to 17 g/Nm 3) at the <b>intake</b> <b>temperatures</b> of around 250 °C. The effects of <b>intake</b> <b>temperatures</b> (230 – 270 °C) and pressures (1. 0 – 1. 2 bar) are also studied. The experiments are carried out with artificial syngas on a 435 cc mono-cylinder HCCI engine with a compression ratio of 12 and operated at 1500 RPM. Indicated efficiencies about 34 % and Indicated Mean Effective Pressures about 2. 5 bar were achieved at equivalence ratios between 0. 3 and 0. 34. In the tested ranges, moisture delayed the combustion while the effect of tars were insignificant...|$|R

50|$|Above this speed, given {{sufficient}} initial flight velocity, a ramjet will be self-sustaining. Indeed, {{unless the}} vehicle drag is extremely high, the engine/airframe combination {{will tend to}} accelerate to higher and higher flight speeds, substantially increasing the air <b>intake</b> <b>temperature.</b> As this could have a detrimental effect on {{the integrity of the}} engine and/or airframe, the fuel control system must reduce engine fuel flow to stabilize the flight Mach number and, thereby, air <b>intake</b> <b>temperature</b> to reasonable levels.|$|E

40|$|Sea surface {{temperature}} (SST) has been {{obtained from a}} variety of different platforms, instruments and depths over the past 150 yr. Modern-day platforms include ships, moored and drifting buoys and satellites. Shipboard methods include temperature measurement of seawater sampled by bucket and flowing through engine cooling water intakes. Here I review SST measurement methods, studies analysing shipboard methods by field or lab experiment and adjustments applied to historical SST datasets to account for variable methods. In general, bucket temperatures have been found to average a few tenths of a °C cooler than simultaneous engine <b>intake</b> <b>temperatures.</b> Field and lab experiments demonstrate that cooling of bucket samples prior to measurement provides a plausible explanation for negative average bucket-intake differences. These can also be credibly attributed to systematic errors in <b>intake</b> <b>temperatures,</b> which have been found to average overly-warm by > 0. 5 °C on some vessels. However, the precise origin of non-zero average bucket-intake differences reported in field studies is often unclear, given that additional temperatures to those from the buckets and intakes have rarely been obtained. Supplementary accurate in situ temperatures are required to reveal individual errors in bucket and <b>intake</b> <b>temperatures,</b> and the role of near-{{surface temperature}} gradients. There is a need for further field experiments of the type reported in Part 2 to address this and other limitations of previous studies...|$|R

50|$|At low intake temperatures, {{the engine}} tends {{to operate at}} maximum {{corrected}} speed or corrected flow. As <b>intake</b> <b>temperature</b> rises, a limit on (HP) turbine rotor inlet temperature (SOT) takes effect, progressively reducing corrected flow.

50|$|A big {{advantage}} of the air-to-liquid setup is the lower overall pipe and intercooler length, which offers faster response (lowers turbo lag) , giving peak boost faster than most front-mount intercooler setups.

Alternative fuels like jet fuels can be substitute to them for improved efficiencies. The Department Of Defense uses JP 8 for their combat vehicles under their Single Fuel Concept for a better logistic supply chain. However, due to the projected age of depletion of crude oil reservoirs, synthetic blends are being considered for their abundant availability. One such blend, SASOL IPK, a Coal to Liquid based fuel prepared by the Fisher- Tropsch process is considered in this study. This thesis shows results from experiments conducted on single cylinder PNGV engine to study the effect of <b>intake</b> charge <b>temperature</b> and injection timing on ignition delay of SASOL IPK. Speed, fuel injection pressure, swirl ratio and charge density were kept constant for all data points.

The {{finite element}} {{software}} ADINA was employed {{in this paper}} to study the ventilation effect of a large cross-section cable tunnel by using a computational fluid dynamics method. The temperature and ventilation zoning inside a cable tunnel were determined according to {{the characteristics of the}} large cross-section cable tunnel. With the ambient tunnel characteristics and tunnel cross-section layout being taken into consideration, a three-dimensional model for large cross-section cable tunnels was established; the computations indicate that the main influential factors of ventilation effect of large cross-section cable tunnels are intake airflow rate, <b>intake</b> air <b>temperature,</b> exhaust airflow rate, ventilation duration, tunnel length, fire door layout, and so on. The average air velocity in the tunnel was about 60 % of the intake airflow rate.

The last correction is made with the lambda correction, this results in a stoichiometric combustion (Lambda=1). The lambda correction is allowed to adjust the calculated injection duration by ±25%. The ECU can change the correction factors in the main fuel matrix on basis of the lambda correction, this ensures good driveability, fuel consumption and emissions when lambda correction isn’t activated.

50|$|Exhausts emit a {{large amount}} of heat into the engine bay, which can have a {{negative}} effect on engine performance by raising the underhood temperatures. As a result, high temperature insulation is used, more commonly known as heat barriers, for exhaust heat management. Thermal barrier ceramic-coatings are specifically designed to reduce heat loss from engine exhaust system components including exhaust manifolds, turbocharger casings, exhaust headers, downpipes and tailpipes. When used under-bonnet, these have the positive effect of reducing engine bay temperatures, therefore lessening the <b>intake</b> <b>temperature.</b> As well as providing thermal protection, these coatings are also used to prevent physical degradation of the composite due to frictional processes. This is possible because when applied, the ceramic material bonds with the composite (instead of merely sticking on the surface with paint), therefore forming a tough coating that doesn't chip or flake easily.|$|E
50|$|The {{efficiency}} of the compressor and the power which it absorbs depend on the quantity of air handled per unit time. It therefore becomes necessary to discuss the variation of the volumetric {{efficiency of}} the engine with the <b>intake</b> <b>temperature</b> and the exhaust back pressure. It is presumed that the compressor is designed for operation at a certain normal altitude and normal speed. The calculation of the net horsepower available at the propeller under these normal conditions is particularly simple. In a numerical example {{it is assumed that}} the Liberty engine is fitted with a gear-driven compressor designed to furnish sea-level carburetor pressure at I8,000 feet altitude and an engine speed of 1,700 revolutions per minute. The shaft {{efficiency of the}}compressor is assumed to be 64%. The computed horsepower is 371. In calculating the power of an engine equipped with a turbine-driven compressor, it is assumed that the back pressure created by the turbine is equal to the increase in the carburetor pressureproduced by the blower.
