40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The {{focus of}} this project is on the {{deformation}} behaviour of thermoplastic composites. The materials used were polypropylene and polyamide resins with glass fibres and talc as fillers. These materials were provided by PLASTAMID (pty) ltd. The injection moulded specimens of polypropylene, polyamide 6 - 6, 30 % talc filled polypropylene, 30 % short glass fibre reinforced polypropylene and 30 % short glass fibre reinforced polyamide 6 - 6 were tested in tension, flexure and impact (lzod, Charpy and drop-weight). Two different <b>injection-moulding</b> <b>machines</b> were used for specimen manufacture. These were an automated injection moulding machine simulating good control of processing conditions and a simple hand operated injection moulding machine simulating different processing and cooling (crystallisation) conditions. The mechanical tests were performed at different rates of strain and temperatures. The mechanical results show higher ductility of the unfilled polypropylene material. The strength and the elastic modulus of the materials are different for different materials. Addition of short glass fibres enhances the mechanical properties of polypropylene and polyamide 6 - 6. Talc fillers reduce the tensile, Izod and Charpy impact properties of polypropylene while the flexural and dropweight impact strength is increased. Optical and scanning electron microscopy were used to observe the microstructural features and deformation behaviour such as matrix plastic deformation, matrix crazing and tearing, fibre-matrix debonding, fibre fracture, fibre orientation and crack propagation. These deformation behaviours {{are influenced by the}} test conditions such as strain rate, temperature and the type of the test conducted. The deformation behaviour is also dependent on the constituents of the material. The mechanical test response together with the macro- and microscopic features observed on the fracture surfaces of tested specimens are evidence of the various mechanisms of failure that take place in different thermoplastic composites. The understanding of the mechanical response and the failure mechanisms of thermoplastic matrix composites is important in the design and processing stages...|$|E

Only with a very low volume fraction of inorganic nanoparticles, the creep resistance of thermoplastic could be significantly improved. 21 nm-TiO 2 /PA 6, 6 nanocomposites were compounded using a twin-screw-extruder.

40|$|The {{influence}} of temperature and powder loading on the Metal Injection Moulding (MIM) green compact is presented. The feedstock used {{is a mixture}} of stainless steel (SS 316 L) powder and a composite binder system consisting of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). The bimodal particle size distribution powder has a composition of 30 and 70 % by weight of fine and coarse SS 316 L powder respectively with a powder loading of 64 and 65 % by volume. The Battenfeld BA 250 CDC <b>injection-moulding</b> <b>machine</b> was used to produce a MIMA tensile specimen.

40|$|The {{injection}} moulding process {{is well known}} as an economical production process {{for the production of}} technical parts in large quantities at low cost. The smaller the parts, the shorter the specific cycle time must be in order to maintain an economical production. To increase the economical viability either the amount of cavities must be increased or the process cycle time must be reduced. When moulding micro parts or micro structured parts in conjunction with a variothermal process, special measures are essential for the implementation of this objective due to the required large heat turnover in the mould during the cycle. With conventional methods of mould temperature control only comparatively long cycle times are possible. The increase of cavities is limited because of the filigreed structures. The principle of inductive heating as a method of variothermal mould heating is one possibility to achieve shorter cycle times despite of the high cavity temperatures. With the aim to mould micro structured parts with a variothermal mould heating process at short cycle times an experimental plant was built {{on the basis of a}} standard <b>injection-moulding</b> <b>machine.</b> (orig.)

40|$|ABSTRACT Powder {{injection}} moulding (PIM) {{is an important}} and accepted industrial technique for producing net-shaped components which combines the advantages of {{injection moulding}} and powder metallurgy. The properties of the feedstock, a mixture of powder and binder system (often based on a thermoplastic polymer), strongly influence the process. An accurate characterisation of the feedstock properties are then of great significance in many situations, e. g. when simulating moulding of PIM-components. Here {{it is important to}} perform the measurements at conditions similar to those experienced during the injection moulding. In the present work, a model system, consisting of steel powder, poly(ethylene glycol) and wax, is used in order to illustrate how the rheological properties as well as thermal properties, such as the conductivity and the specific heat, of the system can be related to the corresponding properties of the polymeric binder system. In a similar way, the pvT (pressure-volume-temperature) -behaviour of the model system is analysed and discussed. With the model system described above and a medium-pressure <b>injection-moulding</b> <b>machine,</b> the mould filling phase was studied in situ with a special mould equipped with a sight glass using a high speed camera. Effects of features such as the mould temperature, the melt temperature, the surface roughness of the mould cavity, the gate dimensions, the mould design and the flow rate on the filling behaviour were demonstrated. In particular it was noted that a rougher mould surface facilitated to some extent the filling of the mould. The mould temperature, the nominal melt temperature and the flow rate affected the position of weld lines via the cooling of the feedstock and the corresponding change of the melt viscosity. The experimentally determined weld-line positions were compared with predictions from numerical simulations performed with a commercial software. The physical properties of the model feedstock, as measured {{in the first part of}} this study, were used as input data for the simulation. The agreement between the experiments and the predictions was in most cases quite fair or good. The in situ observation of the mould filling also provided the possibility to study how the gate dimensions and the flow rate influenced the jetting behaviour. In summary, this work combines feedstock characterization, in situ visualization of practical mould filling experiments and computer simulations in order to get a better understanding of the properties courses of events influencing the mould filling Key words: powder injection moulding, rheology, thermal properties, mould filling, processing conditions, jetting, computer simulation...|$|R
40|$|The {{physical}} properties are changed if fillers {{are added to}} a polymeric material. In this work a highly filled model system for power injection moulding (PIM) and graphite nanoplatelet (GNP) based nanocomposites have been manufactured and characterized. Powder injection moulding is an important and accepted industrial technique for producing net-shaped components which combines the advantages of injection moulding and powder metallurgy.

The experimentally determined mould filling behavior was compared with predictions from numerical simulations. The agreement between the experiments and the predictions was in most cases quite fair or good. The manufacturing strategy is of prime importance for the appropriate incorporation of fillers into a polymeric material, and this particular refers to nanofillers. In this work graphite based nanoplatelets have been incorporated in both polystyrene and ethylene-butyl acrylate copolymer using different mixing methods. The as-received filler material contained microscopic size agglomerates formed by nanoscopic size graphite nanoplatelets. Refining of the agglomerates and dispersion of the nanoplatelets during the production of the composites are the key factors for achieving high quality nanocomposites. The nanocomposites manufactured have been studied by microscopical techniques in order to evaluate the efficiency of the different mixing methods. Also electrical and rheological properties of the composites have been assessed and used to further investigate the dispersion and deagglomeration of the filler particles. The effects of carbon black on the electrical and rheological properties of the GNP/ethylene-butyl acrylate composite have also been studied and positive synergistic effect on the electrical percolation threshold was observed...|$|R
40|$|Many {{processes}} such as <b>machining,</b> <b>injection-moulding</b> and metal-forming {{are usually}} operated by hydraulic servo-systems. The dynamic characteristics of these systems are complex and highly non-linear and are often subjected to the uncertain external dis-turbances associated with the processes. Consequently, the conventional approach to the controller design for these systems may not guarantee accurate tracking-control performance. Taking into account the repetitive nature of the operations in those processes, a discrete iterative learning control algorithm is proposed to realize an accurate hydraulic servesystem regardless of the uncertainties and the external disturbances. In the algorithm, the control input sequence for the next operation is determined by utilizing the tracking error, {{as well as information}} on the dynamic characteristics obtainedfrom the past operations, so that the output trajectory tracks the given the desired trajectory as closely as possible. To investigate a gradual improvement of tracking performance in consecutive operations, the proposed algorithm was implemented on a hydraulic servo-system. A series of experiments was M o m d for the position-tracking control of the system subjected to external disturbances. The experimental results show that, regardless of inherent non-linearities and disturbances, an accurate tracking-control performance is obtained using the proposed learning control algorithm characterized by recursive operations...|$|R
