50|$|Hoses or tubing connect {{an oxygen}} mask to the oxygen <b>supply.</b> <b>Hoses</b> are larger in {{diameter}} than tubing and can allow greater oxygen flow. When a hose is used {{it may have}} a ribbed or corrugated design to allow bending of the hose while preventing twisting and cutting off the oxygen flow. The quantity of oxygen delivered from the storage tank to the oxygen mask is controlled by a valve called a regulator. Some types of oxygen masks have a breathing bag made of plastic or rubber attached to the mask or oxygen <b>supply</b> <b>hose</b> to store a supply of oxygen to allow deep breathing without waste of oxygen with use of simple fixed flow regulators.|$|R

The results showed that, in this working condition, the <b>fluid</b> <b>supply</b> system of ejector is 14 % shorter than the thermodynamic expansion valve in freezing time, which reducing the power consumption by shortening the working time of compressor, condenser and other equipment. Meanwhile, Ejector can act like isentropy and recycle some expansion work, which could increase the refrigerant capacity of evaporator to save about 6. 3 % power consumption compared with the isoenthalpy throttling of thermodynamic expansion valve. The system can reducing 10 °C temperature difference by avoiding two-phase flow <b>fluid</b> <b>supply</b> of the evaporator and reduce the flow resistance of refrigerant in evaporator.

40|$|CONTEXT: Central {{diabetes}} insipidus (CDI) {{is a rare}} cause of hypernatremia during the neonatal period. The diagnosis is particularly difficult in very low birth weight (VLBW) newborns. CASE REPORT: We report on a preterm newborn who presented CDI soon after birth. On {{the third day of}} life, signs of dehydration were present despite normal <b>fluid</b> <b>supply.</b> The diuresis rate was 4. 4 ml/kg/h. Although the <b>fluid</b> <b>supply</b> was then increased, the dehydration continued, with hypernatremia, normal glycemia, diuresis of 7. 4 ml/kg/h and urine density of 1005 mOsmol/l. Thus, a diagnostic hypothesis of {{diabetes insipidus}} was raised. A test with a nasal vasopressin analogue (dDAVP) was performed and CDI was confirmed. Reduction of the <b>fluid</b> <b>supply</b> became possible through appropriate treatment. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of CDI is rarely made during the neonatal period, especially in VLBW newborns, because of the difficulty in detecting elevated diuresis. Persistent hypernatremia, usually accompanied by hyperthermia despite abundant <b>fluid</b> <b>supply,</b> weight loss and low urine osmolality are important signs of alert...|$|R

In addition, grinding temperature in the internal grinding <b>fluid</b> <b>supply</b> was lower than in the external grinding <b>fluid</b> <b>supply,</b> as measured by infrared thermograph camera.

40|$|Keywords-dry turning; flood turning; minimum {{quantity}} lubrication (MQL); Pareto ANOVA analysis; Taguchi methods Abstract—This paper {{presents the}} experimental and analytical results of different cutting <b>fluid</b> <b>supply</b> strategies—dry, minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) and flood turning {{in terms of}} the surface finish of turned parts. Subsequently, the influence of independent input parameters on surface finish is investigated in order to optimize their effects. Three techniques—traditional analysis, Pareto ANOVA analysis, and the Taguchi method—are employed. Initially mild steel AISI 1030 has been selected as the work material. The results indicate that the cutting <b>fluid</b> <b>supply</b> strategy has insignificant influence on the surface finish of turned parts. However, the amount of cutting fluid in MQL showed some influence. Further research on two additional materials, aluminum 6061 and alloy steel AISI 4340, reveals that the surface roughness for different work materials is influenced differently by the cutting <b>fluid</b> <b>supply</b> strategies and there is a scope for optimizing the cutting <b>fluid</b> <b>supply</b> strategy in terms of both method and the amount of cutting fluid. This will reduce the amount of cutting fluids used and consequently, their negative impact on the environment, by avoiding unnecessary applications...|$|R
