500|$|Arabella Weir {{previously}} {{appeared as}} an alternate {{incarnation of the}} Third Doctor in the Doctor Who Unbound audio drama Exile. Weir was [...] "genuinely surprised and completely thrilled" [...] to be offered the part. Bill Bailey was pleased {{to be given a}} comedic human character, explaining, [...] "The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> almost playing a human means the expressions are easier to do. If I was an Ood, with a face full of tentacles, that would have been harder to bring the funny".|$|E
500|$|The {{anthropologist}} Paul van der Grijp believes Oviri {{was intended}} [...] as an epithet to reinforce Gauguin's persona as a [...] "civilised savage". [...] The artist {{wrote in his}} final letter to Morice that [...] "You were wrong that day when you said I was wrong to say I was a savage. It's true enough: I am a savage. And civilised people sense the fact. In my work {{there is nothing that}} can surprise or disconcert, except the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a savage in spite of myself. That's also why my work is inimitable." ...|$|E
500|$|The final debates were nasty, and Holtzman in {{particular}} constantly attacked Ferraro's integrity and finances. In an unusual election-eve television broadcast, Ferraro talked about [...] "the ethnic slur that I am {{somehow or other}} connected to organized crime. There's lots of innuendo but no proof. However, it is made plausible because of the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> an Italian-American. This tactic comes from the poisoned well of fear and stereotype..." [...] On the , 1992, primary, Abrams edged out Ferraro by less than a percentage point, winning 37percent of the vote to 36percent, with Sharpton and Holtzman well behind. Ferraro did not concede she had lost for two weeks.|$|E

60|$|I {{must have}} betrayed the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a little startled, for the remark {{came as a}} {{confirmation}} of what I had dimly felt.|$|R

2500|$|Tam Dalyell, an MP {{who was at}} {{the time}} the Father of the House of Commons, {{attacked}} Mandelson by claiming he was part of a group known as Blair's 'Jewish cabal' in May 2003, leading to some outrage. In response Mandelson said: [...] "Apart from the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not actually Jewish, I wear my father's parentage with pride." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mrs. Richards' {{interests}} {{also included}} applying scientific principles to domestic situations, such as nutrition, clothing, physical fitness, sanitation, and efficient home management, creating {{the field of}} home economics. [...] "Perhaps the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not a radical and that I do not scorn womanly duties but claim it as a privilege to clean up and sort of supervise the room and sew things is winning me stronger allies than anything else," [...] she wrote to her parents. She published The Chemistry of Cooking and Cleaning: A Manual for House-keepers in 1881, designed and demonstrated model kitchens, devised curricula, and organized conferences.|$|E
60|$|No; <b>I</b> don't mean <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> mean more. They didn't charge. They {{accepted}} it as a proven <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> guilty. <b>That</b> you were my--lover.|$|R
30|$|The {{implications}} (iv)  (i) (v) {{were established}} in [20]. In the case of matrix Schur multipliers the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> (<b>i)</b> implies (ii) <b>was</b> proved in [15]. We refer the reader to [51] for the proof of the equivalence of (i), (ii), and (iv) and to [60] for the proof of the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> (<b>i)</b> <b>is</b> equivalent to (iii).|$|R
60|$|This {{was evidently}} the captain's or Lowell's work, {{and it was}} on the {{strength}} of it that the two hoped to clear themselves. The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a minor had not entered into their calculations.|$|R
2500|$|When {{asked about}} his {{motivation}}s, Ringer responded [...] "Honestly, my number-one motivation is my family". While talking about his attitude and upbringing, Ringer mentioned, [...] "A lot of that just comes from my upbringing. I have a tremendous mother and father, I {{grew up in the}} church, I have a very religious family. I’m not all about myself just because I know if it wasn’t for God, I wouldn’t be able {{to go out there and}} compete anyway. So I never look at it as a selfish thing—I never want all the attention or want it to be about me, because I never want to get in to a situation where God has to humble me. I know for a <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not doing it by myself; it is because of Him that I can compete over and over again. That’s basically how I grew up. I was blessed and fortunate to have a family like I have." ...|$|E
2500|$|His {{achievements}} {{in the navy}} were well-known, but himself much less. He did not discuss his private life, feelings, prejudices, hopes or fears, except {{with his family and}} his closest friends. He was modest and candid about himself. [...] "When I look at myself objectively," [...] he wrote in retirement, [...] "I think that what success I may have achieved through life is largely due to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a good judge of men. I am lazy, and I never have done things myself that I could get someone to do for me. I can thank heredity for a sound constitution, and myself for taking care of that constitution." [...] About his intellect he was equally unpretentious: [...] "Some people believe that when I am quiet that I am thinking some deep and important thoughts, when the fact is that I am thinking of nothing at all. My mind is blank." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 13 January 2012, Chris Evans began {{negotiations}} {{to star in}} the film adaptation, and was later confirmed as the film's male lead. On 17 January 2012, Tilda Swinton and Jamie Bell were confirmed to be in talks to join the project. Swinton first met Bong at the Cannes Film Festival, where she was of the mind {{that she did not}} want to make any other films, a decision she takes after each film: [...] "And that one (and only) condition in which I will make another film is that I will have some fun. So we started to play with the idea of what would amuse us about this." [...] Bong and Swinton experimented with voices, mannerisms and the general appearance of the character of Mason. On 18 January 2012, John Hurt was confirmed to have been cast, with Hurt stating, [...] "All the film crew refer to , with great reverence, as 'Director Bong'. I love the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> working for Director Bong." [...] On 2 February 2012, Octavia Spencer had joined the cast of Bong's project in the role of a [...] "passenger on the train who joins the revolt in order to save her son." [...] Ed Harris spoke of his love of Bong Joon-ho's films and wanted to work with him, [...] "I want to do this. I don't care what he's asking me to do because he's a really great filmmaker." [...] On 27 February 2012, Ewen Bremner had joined the cast of Bong's film. On 3 April 2012, Luke Pasqualino was confirmed to have joined the cast.|$|E
6000|$|... “I owe {{no small}} portion of it, Dimchurch, to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> able to take an {{observation}} so soon after I had joined, and that {{was due to the}} kindness of my good friend Miss Warden.” ...|$|R
60|$|On {{the evening}} before I had written him a letter and posted it. Gus had seen me do so, and had made a mean remark {{concerning}} the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{to stay at home}} while he was to have a good time.|$|R
2500|$|Campese later confessed that, [...] "The chief talking-point <b>was</b> the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{awarded a}} try which I never touched down properly. It {{was not a}} score. It you study the video, it <b>is</b> obvious <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{not happy with the}} {{decision}} the referee made..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Continue--always, however, keeping {{before you}} the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a sick man. Last {{night was a}} wild night on the moors, dad." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You judge {{everyone}} by yourself, count," [...] Fergus said slowly. [...] "You overrate my qualities, {{and forget the}} <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> after all, but a soldier of fortune." ...|$|E
6000|$|All {{this time}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> blessedly forgetting one thing--the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> an inveterate talker in my sleep. But one night I awoke and found my bed-mate--my younger brother--sitting {{up in bed}} and contemplating me {{by the light of the}} moon. I said-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>am</b> afraid <b>I</b> don't {{understand}} you," [...] I said. [...] "If {{you refer}} to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> watching you with some interest at <b>that</b> moment, <b>I</b> suppose I must plead guilty. On the other hand, I object altogether to the term 'impertinence.'" ...|$|R
500|$|Aurobindo {{said he was}} [...] "visited" [...] by Vivekananda in the Alipore Jail: [...] "It <b>is</b> a <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> hearing {{constantly}} {{the voice}} of Vivekananda speaking {{to me for a}} fortnight in the jail in my solitary meditation and felt his presence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So beautiful, my dear lord," [...] {{she replied}} with gentle earnestness, [...] "so perfect, in <b>fact,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> almost afraid {{something}} must happen presently to upset it all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know very}} little about them at present, beyond the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> bound by my feudal {{obligations}} to put fifty men in the field when called upon to do so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Urbain," [...] said young Madame de Bellegarde, who had {{apparently}} been waiting for her husband {{to take her to}} her ball, [...] "I call your attention to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> dressed." ...|$|E
60|$|He fell silent, adding {{no comment}} of any sort, {{as if he}} waited to hear what of my own accord I might have to urge. But my mind was {{incapable}} of travelling beyond the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{to go out into}} the world to-morrow.|$|R
60|$|Waiting for {{the horses}} to <b>be</b> put to, <b>I</b> {{became aware of}} the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{standing}} some distance from the others in company with a tall, thin, somewhat oldish-looking man. He spoke in low, hurried tones, fearful evidently of being overheard and interrupted.|$|R
60|$|After this {{consultation}} I {{felt much}} better. The reëstablishing {{in my mind}} of the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> hopelessly ill gave me so much satisfaction <b>that</b> <b>I</b> almost became gloomy again. There is nothing more alarming to a neurasthenic than to feel himself growing well and cheerful.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; on what ground I stand. Who I am {{before the}} world, and what {{interest}} I represent. Is it the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> the junior {{partner in the}} house of Brown, Jones, and Robinson?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "True, my boy," [...] {{replied the}} other, [...] "I ought indeed to be ashamed, but I spoke in {{reference}} to money matters. What say you to the <b>fact,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> as much a beggar as yourself?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{probably}} {{arose from}} the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> no one in particular, while, on the contrary, you are {{to become one of}} the particularly bright and shining lights in the medical world. I am only Bob Hubbard." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{she could}} not understand. Nor could I get her to grasp the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> of another world. She was quite as {{positive}} that creation was originated solely to produce her own kind and the world she lived in as are many of the outer world.|$|R
60|$|GEORGE. And {{then came}} that sudden, unexpected, {{disastrous}} change in all Harry's plans. And {{this house and}} all the sordid horror of an intrigue. And then {{there was nothing to}} do but face the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a cur. <b>I</b> wouldn't wish my worst enemy the torture that I've undergone.|$|R
5000|$|... "If I {{ever have}} to re-create it, I would not make any changes to the original.
