40|$|International audienceIn this study, we {{have applied}} Surface Enhanced Resonance Raman Scattering (SERRS) {{technology}} to the specific detection of DNA. We present an innovative SERRS sandwich-hybridization assay that allows specific DNA detection without any enzymatic amplification, such {{as is the case}} with Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). In some substrates, such as ancient or processed remains, enzymatic amplification fails due to DNA alteration (degradation, chemical modification) or to the presence of inhibitors. Consequently, the development of a non-enzymatic method, allowing specific DNA detection, could avoid long, expensive and inconclusive amplification trials. Here, we report the proof of concept of a SERRS sandwich-hybridization assay that leads to the detection of a specific chamois DNA. This SERRS assay reveals its potential as a nonenzymatic alternative technology to DNA amplification methods (particularly the PCR method) with several applications for species detection. As the amount and type of damage highly depend on the preservation conditions, the present SERRS assay would enlarge the range of samples suitable for DNA analysis and ultimately would provide exciting new opportunities for the investigation of ancient DNA in the fields of evolutionary biology and molecular ecology, and of altered DNA in <b>food</b> <b>frauds</b> detection and forensics...|$|R

40|$|Accurate {{diagnosis}} {{of the components of}} our food and a standard lexicon for clear communication is essential for regulating global food trade and identifying <b>food</b> <b>frauds.</b> Reliable identification of wild collected foods can be particularly difficult, especially when they originate in under-documented regions or belong to poorly known groups such as Fungi. Porcini, {{one of the most widely}} traded wild edible mushrooms in the world, are large and conspicuous and they are used as a food both on their own and in processed food products. China is a major exporter of porcini, most of it ending up in Europe. We used DNA-sequencing to identify three species of mushroom contained within a commercial packet of dried Chinese porcini purchased in London. Surprisingly, all three have never been formally described by science and required new scientific names. This demonstrates the ubiquity of unknown fungal diversity even in widely traded commercial food products from one of the most charismatic and least overlooked groups of mushrooms. Our rapid analysis and description makes it possible to reliably identify these species, allowing their harvest to be monitored and their presence tracked in the food chain...|$|R
40|$|The DNA {{analyses}} {{based on}} molecular {{techniques such as}} AFLP, RFLP, microsatellites, and especially DNA barcoding by direct sequencing of mitochondrial genes, are actually considered helpful tools {{for a wide range}} of applications. Molecular markers could provide informations about food quality, traceability, safety and authenticity. The identification of species by DNA barcoding is useful to reveal <b>food</b> <b>frauds</b> and mislabbelling of food products and it is also essential to characterize reproductive stocks for aquaculture purpose. In particular, our research is aiming to obtain the genetic profiles of the reproductive stocks of different shellfish species, that represent important sources for the economy of Italian aquaculture. The DNA barcoding uses a direct sequencing method based on diagnostic sequences derived from species-specific mitochondrial DNA cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) and 16 S rDNA (16 S). This technique revealed a high capacity to discriminate commercial shellfish species such as the manila clam Tapes philippinarum, the native Italian clam Tapes decussatus, and the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. Results referred to the three species collected in the North Adriatic sea are also compared with data available for other geographic areas to assess genetic diversity of Italian seafood products. Therefore, the molecular techniques represent a powerful tool not only for the authentication of shellfish products, but also for protection of wildlife fauna, and the sustainable yield of natural resources...|$|R

40|$|The {{productivity}} in Swedish food sector has significantly increased {{during the last}} decades as has the capacity in distribution networks. Food company mergers combined with reductions in relative price on input resources has created a food production system that is economically more efficient. On the other hand, with some businesses growing disproportionately in comparison to others, a few big players dominate nearly the entire Swedish market. This is especially relevant in the retailing sector and raises concerns on distribution of bargaining power. This could potentially affect economic viability and innovation opportunities of smaller producers and businesses, although the direction of these effects is ambiguous. There are newer trends like private labelling, <b>food</b> <b>frauds</b> and presence of inefficient practices in the chain which need to be understood. There are also concerns such as low Swedish competitiveness, inefficient price pass through and food waste which need to be addressed. This way the sector is confronted with challenges whose interplay is unknown territory. In {{the face of a}} dynamic food sector and evolving consumer behavior, the previous successes of the Swedish food industry may have unintendedly become threats to its future sustainability. This report, therefore, scopes the need and potential for greater scientific investigation on challenges in Swedish food sector with the objective of augmenting the sustainability of the overall sector. In doing so, it describes the research front on sustainable food production from a value chain perspective with a focus on the retailer-supplier interface.

40|$|Background <b>Food</b> <b>fraud</b> {{prevention}} and fraud vulnerability reduction {{are the first}} steps to combat <b>food</b> <b>fraud</b> and require a recurrent effort throughout the food supply chain. Due to the intentional nature of fraud, it requires different tactics than the common food safety approaches. However, knowledge on what determines <b>food</b> <b>fraud</b> vulnerability is limited. Scope and approach In {{the current study a}} new <b>food</b> <b>fraud</b> vulnerability concept is explored. The concept is based on the criminological routine activity theory and key <b>food</b> <b>fraud</b> vulnerability factors are subsequently extracted and identified. Key findings and conclusions Opportunities, motivations and control measures are defined in this concept as the three main elements of <b>food</b> <b>fraud</b> vulnerability. They can be subdivided into technical opportunities, opportunities in time and place, economic drivers, culture and behavior, as well as technical and managerial control measures. They are further detailed in 31 fraud vulnerability factors. <b>Food</b> <b>fraud</b> vulnerability threats may originate from both the external and the internal environment of a business which means that several vulnerability factors need to be considered at multiple environmental levels, i. e. the level of the business itself, its suppliers, its customers, the wider chain and at the (inter) national level. The concept was further developed into a practical <b>food</b> <b>fraud</b> vulnerability self-assessment tool with 50 questions and answering grids.

40|$|Food allergens are a {{real threat}} to {{sensitized}} individuals. Although food labeling is crucial to provide information to consumers with food allergies, accidental exposure to allergenic proteins may result from undeclared allergenic substances by means of <b>food</b> adulteration, <b>fraud</b> or uncontrolled cross-contamination. Allergens detection in foodstuffs {{can be a very}} hard task, due to their presence usually in trace amounts, together with the natural interference of the matrix. Methods for allergens analysis can be mainly divided in two large groups: the immunological assays and the DNA-based ones. Mass spectrometry has also been used as a confirmatory tool. Recently, biosensors appeared as innovative, sensitive, selective, environmentally friendly, cheaper and fast techniques (especially when automated and/or miniaturized), able to effectively replace the classical methodologies. In this review, we present the advances in the field of food allergens detection toward the biosensing strategies and discuss the challenges and future perspectives of this technology. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
