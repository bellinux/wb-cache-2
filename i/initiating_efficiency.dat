It was shown by real time IR (RTIR) spectroscopy, photocalorimetry, bulk polymerization studies and the curing of thin films that IPM acts as a physical quencher for the triplet state of 1 and that it is a very poor hydrogen donor. Thus any interaction of the ground state of 1 with its triplet state is likely to lead to physical quenching, thereby reducing the <b>initiating</b> <b>efficiency</b> of 1. Evidence is also presented that the use of high concentrations of N-methyldiethanolamine can lead to reduction of the triplet state of 1, thereby enhancing the <b>initiating</b> <b>efficiency</b> of 1.

40|$|Tumour {{recurrence}} in {{head and}} neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) occurs in 50 % of patients and is {{a leading cause of}} mortality in these patients. To understand the biological determinants of tumour recurrence, tumour initiation in a xenotransplant NOD/SCID mouse was used. The investigation of tumour initiation for 6 HNSCC cell lines found tumour initiation was highly inefficient, requiring 1 x 104 to 3 x 105 cells to form a tumour. To understand the observed inefficiency in tumour initiation, the major biological determinants of tumour initiation were investigated. The major biological determinants include i) the inherent tumour initiating activity of the tumour cells and ii) the influence of the tumour microenvironment. By using the NOD/SCID mouse the immune system was excluded as a microenvironmental constraint in tumour initiation. Moreover, no effect on tumour initiation was observed with the addition of normal stromal cells such as human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) and normal epithelial cells, human epidermal keratinocytes (HEK). These findings indicated that factors other than the immune system or the presence of human fibroblasts or keratinocytes were responsible for the poor tumour <b>initiating</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the HNSCC cells. Therefore, cell based models of tumour initiation were investigated to determine whether the inherent tumour initiating activity of the cells was responsible for inefficient tumour initiation. To examine the inherent tumour initiating activity of the cells, the cancer stem cell (CSC) model and the clonal evolution (Stochastic) model were used. It was found that the HNSCC cell lines all expressed putative CSC markers however, the expression of these markers did not relate to the tumour initiating activity of the cell lines. To determine whether a rare population or most cells could form a tumour, clonal populations were isolated from 3 HNSCC cell lines. These clonal populations of cells were all able to form a tumour in a cell number dependent manner. However, the Detroit 562 and SCC 15 clones varied in their ability to form tumours, being both more and less tumourigenic than the parental cell line. Further investigation of the Detroit 562 clones demonstrated the functionally distinct clones were genetically distinct and able to interact with one another. The clonal populations were found to interact with one another to enhance the inherent tumour initiating activity of the clones. Moreover, the differently tumourigenic clones had a unique genetic profile. The most tumourigenic of the clones was found to up-regulate GPx 2 and Ceacam 6 and down-regulate interferon (IFN) responsive genes when compared to the least tumourigenic of the clones. Investigation of the differential expression of these genes indicated only Ceacam 6 expression was able to modulate tumour growth in vivo. Moreover, Ceacam 6 expression was detected in HNSCC patient samples indicating the expression of Ceacam 6 in the HNSCC cell lines was representative of patient HNSCC. Therefore, tumour initiation in the HNSCC cell lines is a complex interplay between the clonal populations present within the cell line and the expression of Ceacam 6 also {{plays an important role in}} the behaviour of the cells...|$|E

The initiator of DCP caused the degradation of PP chains during the aging processing. After aged for 24 h, the yield strength decreased from 28 MPa to 15 MPa and the elongation at break reduced by 795 %. The CAPP possessed outstanding anti-aging performance owing to the cross-linking and entanglement of the side chains of cardanol grafted onto PP. The yield strength, tensile strength and the elongation at break of CAPP-DCP changed lightly even when it was in long-term irradiation for 480 h...|$|R

We now demonstrate that B-cell progenitors, {{up to and including}} the pro-B cell, efficiently initiate Ph+ B-ALL. However, cells at the pre-B-cell stage of development did not initiate disease. We show that this difference in leukemia initiating potential is due to the level at which the Arf tumor suppressor gene is induced in specific stages of B lymphopoiesis. Whereas immature B-cell progenitors survive the relatively low levels of Arf that are induced after oncogene expression, pre-B cells express the tumor suppressor gene at high levels and undergo massive apoptosis. These data demonstrate that the molecular events that control Ph+ B-ALL initiation and tumor suppression in the B-cell lineage are developmentally regulated...|$|R

Die an den firmenindividuellen Gueteroutputs bemessene Partialrueckverteilung des sektoralen Emissionssteueraufkommens fuehrt zu einer Produktionsverlagerung von nettosteuerzahlenden Starkverschmutzern zu (netto) subventionierten Oeko-Vorreiter-Unternehmen. Angewendet auf den Elektrizitaetserzeugungssektor ermoeglicht der Fiskalmechanismus den Uebergang zu einer CO_ 2 -armen bzw. -freien Stromproduktion.

(orig.) The {{concept of}} an ecologic {{taxation}} approach and its capabilities in terms of emission control policy are presented. The system of a ''sectoral emission tax with output-determined partial redistribution'', (SEOP), is explained {{as well as its}} implementation. It is an instrument that may contribute to <b>initiating</b> an <b>efficiency</b> revolution, as it creates the suitable incentives and mechanisms for lowering the intensity of emissions of production processes of branches of industry producing homogeneous goods. The receipts from the sectoral pollution tax are redistributed to the companies, redistribution being determined by a company's output of goods. This will usher in a shift in production, away from net tax paying strong polluters to (net) subsidized companies, as ecologic pioneers. Implementation of this fiscal approach in the electricity generation sector will create an incentive for a transition to low-CO_ 2 or even zero-CO_ 2 electricity production processes. This SEOP concept targeting a change on the supply-side, or production-side, respectively, can well be combined with an electricity tax designed for the demand side, i. e. a goods controlling (GC) tax, to form a ''SEOP+GC'' system.

40|$|Tumor {{initiation}} (TI) in xenotransplantation {{models of}} {{head and neck}} squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is an inefficient process. Poor TI {{could be due to}} (1) posttransplant cell loss, (2) a rare sub-population of cancer stem cells or (3) a requirement for specific cellular interactions, which rely on cell number. By tracking GFP-expressing HNSCC cells, we conclude that the posttransplant loss of cancer cells is minimal in the xenotransplant model. Furthermore, an examination of putative cancer stem cell markers (such as CD 133, CD 44, SP and label retention) in HNSCC cell lines revealed no correlation between marker expression and tumorigenicity. In addition, single-cell clones randomly isolated from HNSCC cell lines and then transplanted into mice were all capable of <b>initiating</b> tumors with <b>efficiencies</b> varying almost 34 -fold. As the observed variation in the clones was both more and less tumorigenic than the parental cells, a combination of two clones, at suboptimal cell numbers for TI, was implanted into mice and was found to modulate the tumor-initiating activity, thus indicating that TI is dependent on a critical number of cells and, for the first time, that interactions between clonal variants within tumors can modulate the overall tumor-initiating activity. Put in context with previous literature on tumorigenic activity, we believe that interactions between clonal variants within a tumor as well as (1) stromal interactions, (2) angiogenic activity, (3) immunocompetence and (4) cancer stem cells may all contribute to tumorigenic potential and the propensity for tumor growth and recurrence...|$|R

Efficiencies which do not fulfill this condition, call for further inspection. An observation of a total efficiency larger than the Carnot <b>efficiency</b> <b>initiated</b> the following study.

40|$|Cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) are {{bio-based}} nanoparticles, which display {{an array}} of interesting properties related to their renewability, biocompatibility, high tensile strength and elastic modulus, high aspect ratio, low density, low coefficient of thermal expansion, and liquid crystal behavior. As a result, CNC can be exploited {{in a wide variety}} of applications, which include the fields of composites, catalysts, emulsions or colloidosomes. However, the engineering of innovative nanomaterials from CNC generally requires a fine control of their surface properties by chemical modification, to tailor their dispersive, interfacial and self-assembling properties, or to introduce novel functionalities. In this context, the surface functionalization of cellulose nanocrystals by esterification and Surface-Initiated Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization (SI-ATRP) reactions was envisaged, with the objective to develop novel advanced materials. The first chapter describes the state-of-the-art of the field in which the cellulose nanocrystals are presented, with their properties, methods of functionalization and potential applications. A brief overview of the SI-ATRP reaction is also given. In the second chapter, a convenient method is proposed to directly characterize the polymer grafted by SI-ATRP on the CNC surface, without cleaving the polymer from the nanoparticle. The SI-ATRP grafting of polystyrene (PS) at the CNC surface was performed from brominated CNC initiators, in the presence of a sacrificial initiator. With this work, we show that Dynamic light scattering (DLS) is a convenient tool to monitor the polymerization process, while differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) can be used to verify if the polymerization rates of the grafted and free polymers coincide. Finally, we demonstrate that thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) can be used to directly estimate the molecular weight of the PS grafted at the surface of the CNC without cleaving the polymer from the nanoparticle. In the third chapter, both SI-ATRP and Surface-Initiated Activator Re-Generated by Electron Transfer ATRP (SI-ARGET ATRP) were conducted to graft PS and P 4 VP on the surface of CNC. The SI-ATRP and SI-ARGET ATRP approaches were systematically compared to evaluate the potential benefit of each method. The surface <b>initiating</b> <b>efficiencies</b> (SIE) of the CNC-Br macroinitiators with regards to styrene or P 4 VP were evaluated by TGA and EA, respectively. The combination of analytical methods such as FT-IR, DLS, DSC, TGA, and EA demontrated that the SI-ARGET ATRP reaction favored the grafting of longer polymer chains with lower grafting densities compared with the classical SI-ATRP method. The impact of catalyst concentration and propagation rate on the differences noted was particularly discussed. In the fourth chapter, pH-responsive P 4 VP-g-CNC nanohybrids were prepared by SI-ATRP and subsequently used to stabilize gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) and produce recyclable catalysts. The presence of P 4 VP brushes at the CNC surface led to the growing of Au NPs of lower averaged diameter compared with the diameter of the Au NPs deposited on pristine CNC. The catalytic performance of pristine Au NPs, Au NPs stabilized by CNC (Au@CNC) and Au NPs stabilized by P 4 VP-g-CNC (Au@P 4 VP-g-CNC) were then compared, through the measurement of the turnover frequency (TOF) obtained after catalytic reduction of 4 -nitrophenol (4 NP), used as a model reaction. Compared with pristine Au NPs, the catalytic activity of Au@CNC and Au@P 4 VP-g-CNC were about 10 and 24 times better, respectively. Moreover, the Au@P 4 VP-g-CNC material could be conveniently recovered by flocculation at basic pH, and the recycled catalyst remained highly active. In the fifth chapter, Ultraviolet (UV) -responsive poly(cinnamoyloxy ethyl methacrylate) (PCEM) was grafted on CNC using SI-ATRP. The resultant PCEM-grafted CNC (PCEM-g-CNC) exhibits high UV absorption properties and undergoes crosslinking under UV irradiation. When the PCEM-g-CNC nanohybrids were incorporated in poly(vinyl chloride), transparent composite films with UV-blocking properties were obtained. The comparison of the optical and mechanical properties of the films before and after UV-irradiation allowed it to be demonstrated that the PCEM-g-CNC nanoparticles also acted as thermal and UV-stabilizers for PVC. Meanwhile, the tensile mechanical properties of the PVC film were significantly improved, and further increased after UV-irradiation. In the sixth chapter, a facile method to prepare colloidosomes at room temperature is proposed from w/o inverse Pickering emulsions containing silica precursors and stabilized by cinnamate modified CNC (Cin-CNC). Cin-CNC Pickering surfactants were prepared by acylation with an excess of cinnamoyl chloride. The Cin-CNC surface displayed partial wettability with both toluene and water, which allowed stabilization w/o inverse Pickering emulsions. The Cin-CNC particles around the droplets were subsequently locked by cross-linking TEOS or TBOS silica precursors at the water/toluene interface, leading to an intricate network of polysiloxane within the Cin-CNC shell. In optimized conditions, the Cin-CNC/silica colloidosomes obtained displayed a robust shell and slow releasing capacity with regards to encapsulated molecules such as rhodamine B or fluorescent deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). In the last chapter, we summarized the general conclusions of the thesis and proposed some recommendations for the future work. The cellulose nanocrystals were modified by esterification and surface initiated Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization. The characterization, mechanism and advanced applications of the functionalized CNC were envisaged. Based on the research and results in this project, we also proposed some recommendations for the future work on the modification of CNC and the other advanced applications...|$|R

Further studies are in progress on chamber lifetimes with a variety of gas fillings. For our specific application this is of particular importance as the vertex chamber is expected to run in regions of high radiation backgrounds. As was expected for a chamber with extended cathodes, lifetimes were good. Actual lifetimes observed to date with our tube configurations have ranged from 0. 05 coul/cm integrated current on the anode for SO: 50 argon-isobutane to- 1 coul/cm for a mix of 49 % A: 50 % CO 2 : 1 % CHJ. The results of these tests show our design goals to be achievable. Additionally they provide a basis on which to design high precision tracking devices particularly in applications where the device is to be operated in regions of difficult physical access or high ambient radiation levels...|$|R
40|$|Horizontal gene {{transfer}} has been implicated as {{a contributing factor}} towards the diversity and adaptation of pathogens, {{and the emergence of}} new diseases. For naturally competent bacteria, DNA acquired through transformation and recombined into the genome could provide a means for this genetic transfer to occur. The work presented here illustrates that Xylella fastidiosa, a bacterial pathogen responsible for several important plant diseases, is naturally competent and able to homologously recombine acquired DNA into its genome. Xylella fastidiosa is vector-transmitted and often exists in natural environments as an endophyte, but causes disease when it multiplies to high levels inside the xylem vessels of its host plants, causing symptoms such as leaf scorching and stunted growth. Several factors were identified that affect the competence of X. fastidiosa, including nutrient availability, growth stage, and methylation state and size of transforming DNA. Recombination efficiencies for X. fastidiosa were at least 1000 -fold higher when cells were grown in a defined nutrient medium compared to cells grown in a rich medium. In addition, surface-attached cells transformed and recombined DNA at efficiencies approximately two orders of magnitude higher than their planktonic counterparts. Maximum recombination efficiencies, defined as the number of recombinant cells recovered divided {{by the total number of}} cells, were approximately 10 - 3 when high concentrations of exogenous plasmid DNA were added to cells, and 10 - 5 when strains harboring different antibiotic markers were co-cultured on solid medium. For planktonic cells, maximum recombination efficiencies were only approximately 10 - 5 when DNA was added and 10 - 7 when different strains were co-cultured. Cells appeared most competent while undergoing exponential growth. For planktonic cells, competence peaked after two days of growth and then rapidly declined, with no recombination observed after 8 days. In biofilms, however, cells remained highly competent for at least five days, with recombination events observed even after 21 days of growth. The transformation mechanism in X. fastidiosa is likely similar to that of other naturally competent bacteria, with mutations in type IV pili, competence-related genes (com genes), and cell-cell signaling genes impacting competence. It was also experimentally determined that flanking homologous sequences as short as 96 bp in transforming DNA is sufficient to <b>initiate</b> recombination, with <b>efficiencies</b> increasing exponentially with length of the homologous region up to 1 kb. In addition, recombination efficiencies decreased exponentially with the size of non-homologous insert. Integration of up to 4 kb of non-homologous DNA was observed experimentally. An in silico analysis of genomic sequences confirmed that the experimental data was consistent with events detected in natural populations, with an estimated mean size of recombination events of 1, 906 bp. Each recombination event also modified, on average, 1. 79 % of the nucleotides in the recombined region. Based on sequence similarity of shared coding regions, it appears that recombination between different subspecies of X. fastidiosa could frequently occur. Originally, it was thought that X. fastidiosa was primarily clonal, but recent studies have suggested that recombination plays a significant role in generating genetic diversity in this bacterium. The work presented here illustrates that X. fastidiosa is naturally competent and that DNA acquired through natural transformation could be a substantial source of donor DNA for recombination. Understanding how this process is regulated and what factors affect its efficiency could provide insight into the genetic diversity of this organism and how new diseases emerge...|$|R
