5|$|In early 1869, Johnson {{identified}} {{the need for}} a school for the blind in the new state of West Virginia; with statehood, <b>deaf</b> <b>and</b> blind West Virginia children attended schools for the <b>deaf</b> <b>and</b> blind in neighboring states (with West Virginia paying their tuition). Johnson began corresponding with West Virginia Governor William E. Stevenson, canvassing across the state to arouse public sentiment in support of a school for the blind. Despite rebukes from prominent West Virginian politicians, Johnson became the leading advocate for a state institution for the blind. He and other educated blind people staged an exhibition in the legislative chamber of the West Virginia House of Delegates, which was praised by the legislators.|$|E

5|$|The {{institute}} {{and the society}} experienced a hiatus {{during the course of}} the war. The school held sessions under Reverend Nelson, and subsequently William C. Clayton in 1866. Clayton later served in the West Virginia Senate. The Romney Literary Society was revived in 1869, and following the passage of a bill which established the West Virginia Schools for the <b>Deaf</b> <b>and</b> Blind in March 1870, the society offered the institute's building and grounds to the state of West Virginia for the new school. The institute's property was transferred to the state and the West Virginia Schools for the <b>Deaf</b> <b>and</b> Blind opened for its first term on September 29, 1870. Following the schools' subsequent expansions, the institute's former building became the center portion of the administration building of the West Virginia Schools for the <b>Deaf</b> <b>and</b> Blind, in which capacity it serves at the present day. In addition to Jacob and Clayton, Robert White, Attorney General of West Virginia, was also an alumnus of the institute.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the personal experiences of hearing people in their interactions with <b>Deaf</b> persons <b>and</b> their knowledge about Deaf culture. The research involved questioning hearing people about their perceptions <b>and</b> interactions with <b>Deaf</b> people <b>and</b> <b>Deaf</b> culture {{in an effort to}} gain insight as to how the lives of Deaf people can be improved in mainstream culture. It was predicted that a majority of hearing participants would describe a lack of knowledge about Deaf culture, discomfort interacting with a <b>Deaf</b> person, <b>and</b> an agreement that a need exists for better understanding of Deaf culture. A survey was conducted with 582 undergraduates at the University of Mississippi. Of the original six hypotheses, the results supported the predictions that a majority of hearing participants would report a lack of knowledge about <b>Deaf</b> culture <b>and</b> how to interact with a <b>Deaf</b> person <b>and</b> that hearing participants would agree {{that there is a need}} for better understanding of Deaf culture. The results indicate positive attitudes about <b>Deaf</b> people <b>and</b> further show the need for improvement of public knowledge about <b>Deaf</b> culture <b>and</b> people, which fits within the existing body of research...|$|R

5|$|Beginning {{with the}} arrival of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's South Branch line to Romney in the 1880s, a {{passenger}} train conducted three trips daily (morning, noon, and evening) from the Romney Depot at Valley to Green Spring on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's main line. During the 1930s, passenger ridership on the South Branch line began to decline, and passenger service was finally discontinued shortly thereafter. A special passenger train carried students of the West Virginia Schools for the <b>Deaf</b> <b>and</b> Blind, arriving at Romney Depot in Valley in the fall, and departing in the spring to take the students home. The last special train to transport the students of the West Virginia Schools for the <b>Deaf</b> <b>and</b> Blind departed Romney Depot in the spring of 1941.

40|$|This article qualitatively {{analyzes}} {{the ways that}} the discourse of "deaf universalism" circulates within two common <b>deaf</b> practices: tourism <b>and</b> engaging in interventions.

Similarly, this article examines how <b>deaf</b> individuals <b>and</b> groups deploy the concepts of <b>deaf</b> "heavens" <b>and</b> "hells" to analyze their travel experiences and justify interventions.
