5|$|England experimented {{briefly with}} milled coinage, but it wasn't until Peter Blondeau brought his method of minting coins {{there in the}} mid-seventeenth century that such coinage began in earnest in that country. Blondeau also invented a {{different}} method of marking the edge, which was, according to him, faster and less costly than the method pioneered by Olivier. Though Blondeau's <b>exact</b> <b>method</b> was secretive, numismatists have asserted that it likely resembled the later device invented by Jean Castaing. Castaing's machine marked the edges by means of two steel rulers, which, when a coinage blank was forced between them, imprinted legends or designs on its edge. Castaing's device found favour in France, and it was eventually adopted in other nations, including Britain and the United States, but it was eventually phased out by mechanised minting techniques.|$|E
5|$|Several {{designs for}} the <b>exact</b> <b>method</b> of {{destroying}} the target were suggested. One of these {{was to have the}} satellite carry out a kamikaze attack on the target, while another was to coat it with black paint, blocking its ability to see or transmit, rendering it inoperable. Yet another was for it to use a laser to disable reconnaissance or optical sensors of the target. Another suggestion was for the satellite to carry a nuclear missile, of up to one megaton yield, and launch it at the satellite. However, in July 1959, Joseph V. Charyk directed that all technical efforts were to be focused on developing the inspection function, rather than the kill function, effectively ending its role as a satellite interceptor, and shifting the project {{to the development of a}} satellite inspector.|$|E
5|$|Oswald {{supported}} Dunstan and Æthelwold, Bishop of Winchester, {{in their}} efforts to purify the Church from secularism. Aided by King Edgar, he took a prominent part in the revival of monastic discipline along the precepts of the Rule of Saint Benedict. His methods differed from Æthelwold's, who often violently ejected secular clergy from churches and replaced them with monks. Oswald also organised the estates of his see into administrative hundreds known as the Oswaldslow, which helped stabilise the ecclesiastical revenues. He constantly visited the monasteries he founded, and was long remembered as father of his people both as bishop and archbishop. It was Oswald who changed the cathedral chapter of Worcester from priests to monks, although the <b>exact</b> <b>method</b> that he employed is unclear. One tradition says that Oswald used a slow approach in building up a new church of monks next to the cathedral, allowing the cathedral's priests to continue performing services in the cathedral until the monastic foundation was strong enough to take over the cathedral. Another tradition claims that, instead, Oswald expelled any of the clergy in the cathedral that would not give up their wives and replaced them with monks immediately. Oswald also reformed Winchcombe Abbey, along with the monasteries of Westbury Priory, Pershore Abbey, and Evesham Abbey. It is also possible that monasteries were established in Gloucester and Deerhurst, but evidence is lacking for their exact foundation dates.|$|E

500|$|The {{boulders}} {{were transported}} over [...] {{from the source}} of the stone. The <b>exact</b> <b>method</b> of transportation of such large masses of rock are unknown, especially since the Olmecs lacked beasts of burden and functional wheels, and they were likely to have used water transport whenever possible. Coastal currents of the Gulf of Mexico and in river estuaries might have made the waterborne transport of monuments weighing 20 tons or more impractical. Two badly damaged Olmec sculptures depict rectangular stone blocks bound with ropes. A largely destroyed human figure rides upon each block, with their legs hanging over the side. These sculptures may well depict Olmec rulers overseeing the transport of the stone that would be fashioned into their monuments. When transport over land was necessary, the Olmecs are likely to have used causeways, ramps and roads to facilitate moving the heads. The regional terrain offers significant obstacles such as swamps and floodplains; avoiding these would have necessitated crossing undulating hill country. The construction of temporary causeways using the suitable and plentiful floodplain soils would have allowed a direct route across the floodplains to the San Lorenzo Plateau. Earth structures such as mounds, platforms and causeways upon the plateau demonstrate that the Olmec possessed the necessary knowledge and could commit the resources to build large-scale earthworks.|$|E

40|$|Solutions for {{analytical}} {{models of}} systems with nonlinear constraints {{have focused on}} <b>exact</b> <b>methods</b> for satisfying the con-straint conditions. <b>Exact</b> <b>methods</b> often require that the con-straint can be expressed in a piecewise-linear manner, and re-sult {{in a series of}} mapping equations from one linear regime of the constraint to the next. Due to the complexity of these meth-ods, <b>exact</b> <b>methods</b> are often limited to analyzing a small number of constraints for practical reasons. This paper proposes a new method for analyzing continuous systems with arbitrary nonlin-ear constraints by approximately satisfying the constraint con-ditions. Instead of dividing the constraints into multiple linear regimes, a discontinuous basis function is used to supplement the system’s linear basis functions. As a result, precise contact times are not needed, enabling this method to be more compu-tationally efficient than <b>exact</b> <b>methods.</b> While the discontinuous basis functions are continuous in displacement, their derivatives contain discontinuities that allow for the nonlinear forces to be accounted for with the assumption that the nonlinear constraints are able to be modeled in a discrete manner. Since each nonlinear constraint requires only one associated discontinuous basis func-tion, this method is easily expanded to handle large numbers of constraints. In order to illustrate the application of this method, an example with a pinned-pinned beam is presented...|$|R
40|$|Core test {{wrappers}} {{and test}} access mechanisms (TAMs) are important {{components of a}} system-on-chip (SOC) test architecture. Wrapper/TAM co-optimization is necessary to minimize the SOC testing time. Most prior research in wrapper/TAM design has addressed wrapper design and TAM optimization as separate problems, thereby leading to results that are sub-optimal. We present a fast heuristic technique for wrapper/TAM co-optimization, and demonstrate its scalability for several industrial SOCs. This extends recent work on <b>exact</b> <b>methods</b> for wrapper/TAM co-optimization based on integer linear programming and exhaustive enumeration. We show that the SOC testing times obtained using the new heuristic algorithm are comparable to the testing times obtained using <b>exact</b> <b>methods.</b> Moreover, more than two orders of magnitude reduction can be obtained in the CPU time compared to <b>exact</b> <b>methods.</b> Furthermore, we {{are now able to}} design efficient test access architectures with a larger number of TAMs...|$|R
