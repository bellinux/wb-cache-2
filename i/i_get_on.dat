500|$|In 2006, Scott {{was asked}} [...] "Who's the biggest {{pain in the}} arse you've ever worked with?", he replied: [...] "It's got to be Harrison... he'll forgive me because now <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> with him. Now he's become charming. But he knows a lot, that's the problem. When we worked {{together}} {{it was my first}} film up and I was the new kid on the block. But we made a good movie." [...] Ford said of Scott in 2000: [...] "I admire his work. We had a bad patch there, and I'm over it." [...] In 2006 Ford reflected on the production of the film saying: [...] "What I remember more than anything else when I see Blade Runner is not the 50 nights of shooting in the rain, but the voiceover... I was still obliged to work for these clowns that came in writing one bad voiceover after another." [...] Ridley Scott confirmed in the summer 2007 issue of Total Film that Harrison Ford contributed to the Blade Runner Special Edition DVD, and had already recorded his interviews. [...] "Harrison's fully on board", said Scott.|$|E
500|$|System Shock {{was first}} {{conceived}} {{during the final}} stages of [...] development, between December 1992 and January 1993. Designer and programmer Doug Church spent this period at the Texas headquarters of publisher Origin Systems, and discussions about Looking Glass Technologies' next project occurred between him and producer Warren Spector, with input from designer Austin Grossman and company head Paul Neurath in Massachusetts. According to Church, the team believed that they had made [...] "too many dungeon games"; and Neurath later explained that they were experiencing burnout after the rushed development of Ultima Underworld II. As a result, they decided to create another [...] "immersive simulation game", but without a fantasy setting. They briefly considered placing the game in modern day, but Church said that the idea was rejected because [...] "it [...] just beg so many questions: why can't I pick up the phone, why can't <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> the train, and so on". Church returned to Looking Glass in Massachusetts, where he, Neurath and Grossman brainstormed possible science fiction settings for the game. According to Spector, the game was initially titled [...] "Alien Commander" [...] and was a spin-off of the Wing Commander series; however, this idea was soon replaced entirely. Spector said that they enjoyed not being attached to an existing franchise, because it meant that they [...] "could basically do whatever [...] liked".|$|E
2500|$|In {{his next}} start on April 16, Holy Bull was the odds on {{favorite}} in the Blue Grass Stakes. He went to the early lead and set a moderate pace, then responded to a brief challenge by pulling away under a hand ride. The win earned Holy Bull a Beyer of 113. After the race, Smith was confident in the colt's ability to go an extra furlong in the upcoming Kentucky Derby. [...] "He would have gone around again today," [...] he said. [...] "I think he'll {{go as far as}} you want him. I'm not going to say no one can ever beat him, but when he runs his race, they've got to have their running shoes on. Every time <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> his back, I realize he's incredible." ...|$|E

2500|$|During the album's {{recording}} Rihanna {{aimed to}} create a record that was both [...] "soulful" [...] and [...] "aggressive" [...] in the musical, lyrical and vocal context. During {{a press conference in}} early 2014, Rihanna told MTV News that she aimed to depart from the musical style of her previous releases, which she described as being [...] "big songs". Rihanna continued to state that with Anti she wanted to focus on music that [...] "felt real" [...] and soulful and would be timeless. She also stated that she wanted to record songs that are [...] "timeless" [...] and that she could perform 15 years later. [...] "Not any songs that were burnt out. I find that when <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> stage now, I don't want to perform a lot of my songs. They don't feel like me." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2006, {{during an}} {{interview}} with MTV News, Knowles spoke about her more aggressive stage persona, Sasha Fierce. She said: [...] "I absolutely get scared every time <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> the stage. I get nervous. I'm actually really scared when I'm not nervous because then I don't transform into that person that {{people are used to}} seeing." [...] She added that in real life, she was nothing like the person people see in her videos and performances: [...] "I'm really more quiet, reserved. I speak when spoken to and polite. When I'm onstage, I'm aggressive, I'm strong, I'm fearless." [...] Knowles' third album I Am... Sasha Fierce formally introduced Sasha Fierce as her alter ego; she revealed that Sasha was born during the making of her single [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] (2003). In an interview with People magazine, Knowles affirmed that her alter ego is strictly for the stage and Sasha Fierce was further described as the singer's sensual, aggressive alter ego. In October 2008, Billboard magazine reported that Knowles would go on tour in the spring of 2009 to support her third studio album. Beyoncé's father and manager Mathew Knowles revealed that it would visit different countries worldwide. The tour dates for the European leg were announced in December 2008. During an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Knowles confirmed that she was excited about the tour and that she would be backed by her all-female band which also accompanied her during her previous tour The Beyoncé Experience (2007). She also stated that she worked on the tour for eight months, rehearsing and trying to put the set list together. Knowles further revealed that the twelve-hour rehearsals for the tour included dancing the choreography in heels for two months before it commenced. She also added that she learnt to make transition from herself to Sasha Fierce really fast for the performances. Knowles further acknowledged that I Am... World Tour was a huge production and that she was proud of the theatrical show she created. She said that it was a mixture of everything she loved: [...] "I tried to bring jazz and hip-hop, and ballet and fashion, and everything together... It is the best thing I've done as far as my tours go." ...|$|E
