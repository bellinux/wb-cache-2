40|$|A {{method to}} {{estimate}} the full-scale noise suppression from a scale model <b>distributed</b> exhaust <b>nozzle</b> (DEN) is presented. For a conventional scale model exhaust nozzle, Strouhal number scaling using a scale factor related to the nozzle exit area is typically applied that shifts model scale frequency {{in proportion to the}} geometric scale factor. However, model scale DEN designs have two inherent length scales. One is associated with the mini-nozzles, whose size do not change in going from model scale to full scale. The other is associated with the overall nozzle exit area which is much smaller than full size. Consequently, lower frequency energy that is generated by the coalesced jet plume should scale to lower frequency, but higher frequency energy generated by individual mini-jets does not shift frequency. In addition, jet-jet acoustic shielding by the array of mini-nozzles is a significant noise reduction effect that may change with DEN model size. A technique has been developed to scale laboratory model spectral data {{based on the premise that}} high and low frequency content must be treated differently during the scaling process. The model-scale distributed exhaust spectra are divided into low and high frequency regions that are then adjusted to full scale separately based on different physics-based scaling laws. The regions are then recombined to create an estimate of the full-scale acoustic spectra. These spectra can then be converted to perceived noise levels (PNL). The paper presents the details of this methodology and provides an example of the estimated noise suppression by a <b>distributed</b> exhaust <b>nozzle</b> compared to a round conic nozzle. Nomenclature A = nozzle area DEN = <b>distributed</b> exhaust <b>nozzle</b> EPNL = effective perceived noise level NPR = nozzle pressure ratio OASPL = overall sound pressure level PNL = perceived noise level SPL = sound pressure level T = Thrust θ = sideline directivity angle relative to nozzle inlet φ = azimuthal angle orientation I...|$|R

Up to 20 dB of noise reduction on a spectral basis and 10 dB on an overall sound pressure level basis are demonstrated from the DEN designs compared to a round reference nozzle.

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} studies undertaken to investigate revolutionary propulsion-airframe configurations that {{have the potential to}} achieve significant noise reductions over present-day commercial transport aircraft. Using a 300 passenger Blended-Wing-Body (BWB) as a baseline, several alternative low-noise propulsion-airframe-aeroacoustic (PAA) technologies and design concepts were investigated both for their potential to reduce the overall BWB noise levels, and for their impact on the weight, performance, and cost of the vehicle. Two evaluation frameworks were implemented for the assessments. The first was a Multi-Attribute Decision Making (MADM) process that used a Pugh Evaluation Matrix coupled with the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). This process provided a qualitative evaluation of the PAA technologies and design concepts and ranked them based on how well they satisfied chosen design requirements. From the results of the evaluation, it was observed that almost all of the PAA concepts gave the BWB a noise benefit, but degraded its performance. The second evaluation framework involved both deterministic and probabilistic systems analyses that were performed on a down-selected number of BWB propulsion configurations incorporating the PAA technologies and design concepts. These configurations included embedded engines with Boundary Layer Ingesting Inlets, <b>Distributed</b> Exhaust <b>Nozzles</b> installed on podded engines, a High Aspect Ratio Rectangular <b>Nozzle,</b> <b>Distributed</b> Propulsion, and a fixed and retractable aft airframe extension. The systems analyses focused on the BWB performance impacts of each concept using the mission range as a measure of merit. Noise effects were also investigated when enough information was available for a tractable analysis. Some tentative conclusions were drawn from the results. One was that the Boundary Layer Ingesting Inlets provided improvements to the BWB's mission range, by increasing the propulsive efficiency at cruise, and therefore offered a means to offset performance penalties imposed by some of the advanced PAA configurations. It was also found that the podded <b>Distributed</b> Exhaust <b>Nozzle</b> configuration imposed high penalties on the mission range and the need for substantial synergistic performance enhancements from an advanced integration scheme was identified. The High Aspect Ratio Nozzle showed inconclusive noise results and posed significant integration difficulties. Distributed Propulsion, in general, imposed performance penalties but may offer some promise for noise reduction from jet-to-jet shielding effects. Finally, a retractable aft airframe extension provided excellent noise reduction for a modest decrease in range...|$|R

The control of western corn rootworm is difficult due to {{the height of the}} corn crop in July-August. The current paper presents the exploitation characteristics of mistblower with cannon and field sprayer with high-mounted spraying boom and vertical tube extension with <b>distributing</b> <b>nozzles</b> on pesticide distribution over the corn plant. Design/methodology/approach: Two field experiments with different air adjustments and driving speed (mistblower with cannon) and nozzle flow and driving speed (field sprayer with high-mounted spraying boom) were reserachFindings: The ventilator of the mistblower spread the pesticide over the wider band of the field as the field sprayer, however the pesticide distribution measured as coefficient of variation did not fulfil the legislative requirements. Research limitations/implications: The experiment results presented herein can be applied under similar equipment adjustment, working speed and growing conditions of the corn plant (78. 000 / ha and the height of 2. 70 m). Practical implications: The field sprayer with high-mounted spraying boom and vertical tube extension was proved as an efficient machine for controlling of western corn rootworm adults in the developed corn growing over 2. 70 m. With the presented technical procedure the damage caused by the western corn rootworm can be almost completely prevented.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to validate the jet noise reduction potential of a concept associated with <b>distributed</b> exhaust <b>nozzles.</b> Under this concept the propulsive thrust is generated by a larger number of discrete plumes issuing from an array of small or mini-nozzles. The potential of noise reduction of this concept stems from the fact that a large number of small jets will produce very high frequency noise and also, if spaced suitably, they will coalesce at a smaller velocity to produce low amplitude, low frequency noise. This is accomplished through detailed acoustic and fluid measurements along with a Computational Fluidic Dynamic (CFD) solution of the mean (DE) <b>Distributed</b> Exhaust <b>nozzle</b> flowfield performed by Northrop-Grumman. The acoustic performance is quantified in an anechoic chamber. Farfield acoustic data is acquired for a DE nozzle as well as a round nozzle of the same area. Both these types of nozzles are assessed numerically using Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) techniques. The CFD analysis ensures that both nozzles issued the same amount of airflow for a given nozzle pressure ratio. Data at a variety of nozzle pressure ratios are acquired at a range of polar and azimuthal angles. Flow visualization of the DE nozzle is used to assess the fluid dynamics of the small jet interactions. Results show that at high subsonic jet velocities, the DE nozzle shifts its frequency of peak amplitude to a higher frequency relative to a round nozzle of equivalent area (from a S(sub tD) = 0. 24 to 1. 3). Furthermore, the DE nozzle shows reduced sound pressure levels (as much as 4 - 8 dB) in the low frequency part of the spectrum (less than S(sub tD) = 0. 24) compared to the round nozzle. At supersonic jet velocities, the DE nozzle does not exhibit the jet screech and the shock-associated broadband noise is reduced by as much as 12 dB...|$|R

40|$|Remediation {{process of}} region, {{formally}} exploited for chemical leaching of uranium, {{is based on}} pumping water contaminated mostly by residuals of sulfuric acid from the relevant geological horizons. The contaminated water is then treated in a chemical plant. In the treatment process evaporators play the key role. Presently operating evaporators – three units – are of falling film type. Heating service is provided by compressed vapor that is generated by evaporators. For driving the compressors and associated circulating pumps of each unit electric power of 3, 4 MW is required. In the evaporators treated solution is distributed into individual tubes by nozzles of cyclone type that are mounted at the top end of tubes. In the evaporators feed solution contains calcium sulfide of low concentration. Once the calcium sulfide concentration in the evaporating process reaches the state of saturation, even locally, fouling is initiated. Thus the solids start to grow on the inner surface of the tube wall and the nozzle’s openings become restricted. The evaporator performance – evaporating rate – gradually declines and when it reaches the bottom limit the evaporator has to be shut down. This is followed by carrying out the cleaning procedure. At {{the time when the}} evaporators started operating (1996) the period between shut downs lasted around a half a year. However, gradually, this period has become substantially shorter – presently it may even last one week only. The thesis proposes two ways of approaching the present hardly acceptable state. First, replacement of <b>distributing</b> <b>nozzles</b> by a set of properly perforated sieve trays secures the uniform distribution of solution into each individual tube. Second, evaporators’ duty will be taken over by newly build multi-flash concentrator that will substitute the presently operating evaporators.

The microjet control {{has been found to}} be very effective in suppressing both the emergence {{of the dynamic}} stall vortex and the associated massive flow separation at the entire operating range of angles of attack. At the high Mach number case (M= 0. 4), the use of microjets appears to eliminate the shock structures that are responsible for triggering the shock-induced separation, establishing the fact that the use of microjets is effective even in controlling dynamic stall with a strong compressibility effect.

Flapping jet injection was shown to minimize the creation of the pressure pulses, except for high-amplitude flapping angles and high injection mass flows, where the injections divert out of the shear layer and introduce periodic superposition of the double shock-cell structure. Furthermore, the flapping injection did not show improved noise reduction compared with the steady injection, which is essentially promising because steady injection proves to be a more practical solution for implementation in real jet engine applications...|$|R
40|$|Meeting future {{goals for}} {{aircraft}} and air traffic system performance will require new airframes with more highly integrated propulsion. Previous studies have evaluated hybrid wing body (HWB) configurations with various numbers of engines and with increasing degrees of propulsion-airframe integration. A recently published configuration with 12 small engines partially {{embedded in a}} HWB aircraft, reviewed herein, serves as the airframe baseline for the new concept aircraft {{that is the subject}} of this paper. To achieve high cruise efficiency, a high lift-to-drag ratio HWB was adopted as the baseline airframe along with boundary layer ingestion inlets and <b>distributed</b> thrust <b>nozzles</b> to fill in the wakes generated by the vehicle. The distributed powered-lift propulsion concept for the baseline vehicle used a simple, high-lift-capable internally blown flap or jet flap system with a number of small high bypass ratio turbofan engines in the airframe. In that concept, the engine flow path from the inlet to the nozzle is direct and does not involve complicated internal ducts through the airframe to redistribute the engine flow. In addition, partially embedded engines, distributed along the upper surface of the HWB airframe, provide noise reduction through airframe shielding and promote jet flow mixing with the ambient airflow. To improve performance and to reduce noise and environmental impact even further, a drastic change in the propulsion system is proposed in this paper. The new concept adopts the previous baseline cruise-efficient short take-off and landing (CESTOL) airframe but employs a number of superconducting motors to drive the distributed fans rather than using many small conventional engines. The power to drive these electric fans is generated by two remotely located gas-turbine-driven superconducting generators. This arrangement allows many small partially embedded fans while retaining the superior efficiency of large core engines, which are physically separated but connected through electric power lines to the fans. This paper presents a brief description of the earlier CESTOL vehicle concept and the newly proposed electrically driven fan concept vehicle, using the previous CESTOL vehicle as a baseline.

40|$|Waste {{combustion}} on a grate {{with energy}} recovery {{is an important}} pillar of municipal solid waste (MSW) management in the Netherlands. In MSW incinerators fresh waste stacked on a grate enters the combustion chamber, heats up by radiation from the flame above the layer and ignition occurs. Typically, the reaction zone starts {{at the top of}} the waste layer and propagates downwards, producing heat for drying and devolatilization of the fresh waste below it until the ignition front reaches the grate. The control of this process is mainly based on empiricism. MSW is a highly inhomogeneous fuel with continuous fluctuating moisture content, heating value and chemical composition. The resulting process fluctuations may cause process control difficulties, fouling and corrosion issues, extra maintenance, and unplanned stops. In the new concept the fuel layer is ignited by means of preheated air (T > 220 °C) from below without any external ignition source. As a result a combustion front will be formed close to the grate and will propagate upwards. That is why this approach is denoted by upward combustion. Experimental research has been carried out in a batch reactor with height of 4. 55 m, an inner diameter of 200 mm and a fuel layer height up to 1 m. Due to a high quality two-layer insulation adiabatic conditions can be assumed. The primary air can be preheated up to 350 °C, and the secondary air is <b>distributed</b> via <b>nozzles</b> above the waste layer. During the experiments, temperatures along the height of the reactor, gas composition and total weight decrease are continuously monitored. The influence of the primary air speed, fuel moisture and inert content on the combustion characteristics (ignition rate, combustion rate, ignition front speed and temperature of the reaction zone) is evaluated. The upward combustion concept decouples the drying, devolatilization and burnout phase. In this way the moisture and inert content of the waste have almost no influence on the combustion process. In this paper an experimental comparison between conventional and reversed combustion is presente...|$|R
40|$|The TRW Pulsed Inductive Thruster (PIT) is an {{electromagnetic}} propulsion {{system that can}} provide high thrust efficiency {{over a wide range}} of specific impulse values. In its basic form, the PIT consists of a flat spiral coil covered by a thin dielectric plate. A pulsed gas injection <b>nozzle</b> <b>distributes</b> a thin layer of gas propellant across the plate surface {{at the same time that}} a pulsed high current discharge is sent through the coil. The rising current creates a time varying magnetic field, which in turn induces a strong azimuthal electric field above the coil. The electric field ionizes the gas propellant and generates an azimuthal current flow in the resulting plasma. The current in the plasma and the current in the coil flow in opposite directions, providing a mutual repulsion that rapidly blows the ionized propellant away from the plate to provide thrust. The thrust and specific impulse can be tailored by adjusting the discharge power, pulse repetition rate, and propellant mass flow, and there is minimal if any erosion due to the electrodeless nature of the discharge. Prior single-shot experiment,; performed with a Diameter diameter version of the PIT at TRW demonstrated specific impulse values between 2, 000 seconds and 8, 000 seconds, with thruster efficiencies of about 52 % for ammonia.

40|$|Supersonic {{jet noise}} {{reduction}} {{is important for}} high speed military aircraft. Lower acoustic levels would reduce structural fatigue leading to longer lifetime of the jet aircraft. It is not solely structural aspects which are of importance, health issues of the pilot and the airfield per- sonnel are also very important, as high acoustic levels may result in severe hearing damage. It remains a major challenge to reduce the overall noise levels of the aircraft, where the supersonic exhaust is the main noise source for near ground operation. Fluidic injection into the supersonic jet at the nozzle exhaust has been shown as a promising method for noise reduction. It {{has been shown to}} speed up the mix- ing process of the main jet, hence reducing the kinetic energy level of the jet {{and the power of the}} total acoustic radiation. Furthermore, the interaction mechanism between the fluidic injection and the shock structure in the jet exhaust plays a crucial role in the total noise radia- tion. In this study, LES is used to investigate the change in flow struc- tures of a supersonic (M= 1. 56) jet from a converging-diverging nozzle.

40|$|Parameters {{governing}} separation {{control with}} sweeping jet actuators over a deflected flap are investigated experimentally on a generic "Multiple Flap Airfoil" (MFA). The model enables an extensive variation of geometric and aerodynamic parameters {{to aid the}} scaling of this novel flow control method to full-size applications. Sweeping jets exit from discrete, millimeter-scale <b>nozzles</b> <b>distributed</b> along the span and oscillate from side-to-side. The sweeping frequency is almost linearly dependent on the supplied flowrate per actuator. The measured thrust exerted by a row of actuators agrees well with vectored momentum calculations. Frequency and thrust measurements suggest that the jet velocity is limited to subsonic speeds and that any additional increase in flowrate causes internal choking of the flow. Neither the flowrate nor the momentum input {{is found to be}} a sole parameter governing the lift for varying distance between adjacent actuators. However, the product of the mass flow coefficient and the square root of the momentum coefficient collapses the lift onto a single curve regardless of the actuator spacing. Contrary to other actuation methods, separation control with sweeping jets does not exhibit any hysteresis with either momentum input or flap deflection. A comparison between sweeping and non-sweeping jets illustrates the superior control authority provided by sweeping jets. Surface flow visualization on the flap suggests the formation of counter-rotating pairs of streamwise vortices caused by the interaction of neighboring jets. The actuation intensity required to attach the flow increases with increasing downstream distance from the main element's trailing edge and increasing flap deflection. No obvious dependence of the ideal actuation location on actuator spacing, flap deflection, angle of attack, or actuation intensity is found within the tested range. Comparisons between experimental and numerical results reveal that the inviscid flow solution appears to be a suitable predictor for the effectively and efficiently obtainable lift of a given airfoil configuration. The flap size affects the achievable lift, the accompanying drag, and the required flap deflection and actuation intensity. By controlling separation, the range of achievable lift coefficients is doubled without significant penalty in drag even when considering a safety margin for the maximum applicable incidence...|$|R
40|$|Multiphase flows {{are common}} in many {{applications}} in chemical, mineral, biochemical and several other process industries. Examples of equipment in which multiphase flows are encountered are stirred vessels and multiphase jets, in which suspensions are agitated by an impeller in the former case and <b>distributed</b> through a <b>nozzle</b> in the latter. To understand the hydrodynamics of multiphase flows, measurements and theoretical models are needed to form a base on which conclusions about several aspects of the properties of such flows can be drawn. However, performing measurements and numerical simulations on multiphase systems is a delicate procedure and entail several difficulties that must be overcome before reliable data can be acquired and conclusions can be drawn. This thesis concerns measurements as well as numerical simulations of multiphase flows in a stirred vessel and a confined jet. The measurements are performed using Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), and the numerical simulations are performed using the granular Eulerian/Eulerian multiphase methodology. To {{be able to access}} and perform measurements of each phase in multiphase systems, a method using refractive index matching is developed. In the measurements performed using PIV, image analysis is used to separate the two phases while, in the case of LDV, features inherently present in the LDV technique are used to accomplish the separation. In the experimental studies, the maximum volume fractions of solids at which measurements can be performed differs between the setups and measurement techniques. In the case of a stirred vessel, the maximum mean solid content is 1. 5 % when using PIV while 9 % when measuring the continuous phase using LDV. In the confined jet the maximum volume fraction is 1. 9 % when using PIV. The method of using image analysis in combination with refractive index matching, used in the experiments performed with PIV, works well but is sensitive to the quality of mixture composition and surface quality/material homogeneity of the secondary phase. The phase separation is also accompanied by several parameters and settings that have to be determined with frame-to-frame examination. The technique used in the LDV measurements similarly works well and allows for measurements at higher concentrations at the cost of measurement time. From the measurements of stirred vessels it is found that the mean velocities of both phases decrease while the RMS velocities increase with increasing solid content. It is also found that the RMS velocities increase with increasing particle size. The numerical evaluations of the stirred vessel, performed using the Sliding Mesh methodology, reveal good general agreement with experimental data, but discrepancies, increasing in magnitude with increasing solid content, are found regarding various aspects of the flow field. Examples are the impeller jet, where the predicted jet is wider than the measured counterpart and the wall region where the predicted axial velocities are generally lower in magnitude compared to experimental data. The predictions of the mean axial slip velocities are in accordance with measurements but the ones acquired from simulations are generally larger in magnitude than their measured counterparts. The experimental and numerical evaluations of the confined jet show that the differences in axial velocity between the two phases are small and that the axial RMS velocities generally increase with increasing volume fraction. Additionally, the RMS velocities for the dispersed phase are generally larger than those of the continuous. The numerical simulations captures the hydrodynamics fairly well, but the continuous phase centreline velocities are underpredicted close to the inlet and overpredicted further away, except at high concentrations where they are underpredicted throughout the region. No conclusion can be made regarding the accuracy of the two drag models used, as each performs better than the other at different volume fractions and locations...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Aerospace EngineeringAircraft icing is a {{recurrent}} aviation safety concern. In {{the past eight}} years alone, eight icing accidents involving business jets and other aircraft have occurred. The accumulation of ice on critical aerodynamic surfaces, the primary cause of these accidents, leads to considerable performance degradation that compromises the safety of the passengers, the crew, and the vehicle. A variety of surface-deformation and thermal systems provide icing protection for aircraft. Hot air anti-icing systems are the most common for airplanes with aluminum leading edges on wing and tail surfaces, and engine inlets. These surfaces are heated using bleed air redirected from the jet engine compressor and channeled through a piccolo tube located inside the leading edge. A series of hot air jets emanate from small holes on the piccolo tube (piccolo holes) and impinge on the internal surface of the leading edge skin, transferring heat, and increasing the skin temperature to prevent ice accumulation. The design and optimization of hot air anti-icing systems involve both experimental and numerical studies. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is a cost-effective analysis tool for bleed air ice protection system design and evaluation. CFD analysis tools, however, require validation against experimental data to determine the accuracy of the numerical schemes, turbulence models, boundary conditions, and results obtained. The present thesis details a CFD methodology developed to simulate the performance of a wing hot air anti-icing system under dry air conditions (no water impingement). Computational simulations were conducted with the commercial CFD code FLUENT to investigate the performance of a hot air anti-icing system installed in the leading edge of a 72 -inch span, 60 -inch chord business jet wing model. The analysis was performed with a full-span model (FSM) and a partial-span model (PSM). The FSM was used to model {{the entire length of the}} piccolo tube to investigate the development of spanwise flow inside the piccolo tube. The PSM was used to model a 2. 44 -in spanwise section of the wing in order to investigate the internal and external flow properties about the wing with the bleed air system in operation. Computational results obtained with the PSM model were compared with experimental data obtained from icing tests performed at the NASA Glenn Icing Research Tunnel (IRT) facility. The work presented in this thesis includes extensive 2 D axisymmetric computational studies performed with a subsonic, heated, turbulent jet impinging on a flat plate to evaluate the performance of five eddy-viscosity turbulence models available in the FLUENT code. The turbulence model studies showed that the Shear Stress Transport (SST) ? -? formulation provided the most consistent prediction of recovery temperatures at the impingement wall. Grid resolution and spatial discretization studies were completed with a three-dimensional version of the jet impingement scenario employed in the turbulence study, and first- and second-order upwind schemes. Three grid resolution levels were considered based on the number of nodes <b>distributed</b> around the <b>nozzle</b> exit circumference in order to apply the same distribution around the piccolo holes circumferences in the anti-icing system PSM. A boundary condition study was performed with the anti-icing models (FSM and PSM). The PSM did not model the piccolo tube internal flow and, consequently, required inflow boundary conditions to be specified at the piccolo holes' exits. The FSM was employed to analyze the flow inside the piccolo tube and to obtain the inflow boundary conditions for the PSM. The approaches applied to extract the boundary conditions were centerline and cell-averaged. Skin temperature results from the PSM were compared with available experimental data and showed that the cell-averaged approach provided the most accurate simulation. Finally, a parametric study was conducted with the anti-icing models (FSM and PSM) to validate the computational methodology with a broad range of cases with variable internal and external flow parameters for which experimental data was available. The results for leading-edge skin temperature as well as piccolo flow properties demonstrated in all cases high-fidelity agreement with experimental data...|$|R
