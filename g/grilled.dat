5|$|In 2017, Burger King {{once again}} reformulated its <b>grilled</b> chicken sandwich, simply {{calling it the}} <b>Grilled</b> Chicken Sandwich. The new {{formulation}} changes out the brioche bun for a potato roll and a new seasoned chicken fillet.|$|E
5|$|<b>Grilled</b> Portobello {{mushroom}} may {{be called}} mushroom steak, and similarly for other vegetarian dishes. Imitation steak is a food product that is formed into a steak shape from various pieces of meat. <b>Grilled</b> fruits, such as watermelon {{have been used as}} vegetarian steak alternatives.|$|E
5|$|Steaks {{are usually}} <b>grilled,</b> {{but they can}} be pan-fried, or broiled. Steak is often <b>grilled</b> in an attempt to {{replicate}} the flavor of steak cooked over the glowing coals of an open fire. Steak can also be cooked in sauce, such as in steak and kidney pie, or minced and formed into patties, such as hamburgers.|$|E
50|$|Another way {{in which}} pellet <b>grill</b> {{manufacturers}} have distinguished themselves from similar brands is by continuing to evolve and add technology. In a constantly wired world, it's no surprise that pellet <b>grills</b> would develop the WiFi compatibility available on Traeger Wood Fired <b>Grills,</b> Memphis Wood Fire <b>Grills,</b> and Boneless <b>Grills.</b> However, the technology isn't exclusive to premium models. Green Mountain <b>Grills</b> began offering each of their pellet <b>grills</b> with a WiFi-enabled control panel {{that allows you to}} monitor and control your cooks through a smartphone or tablet. This is not something offered from all manufacturers, Rec Tec <b>Grills</b> produce WiFi <b>grills</b> while Black Olive <b>Grills</b> has differentiated itself by applying pellet <b>grill</b> technology to a traditional ceramic Kamado <b>grill.</b> Uuni sells a pizza oven that integrates pellet <b>grill</b> technology. It's a trend that seems likely to continue as some manufacturers add new technology to pellet <b>grills</b> and others attempt to add pellet <b>grill</b> technology to traditional <b>grills.</b>|$|R

50|$|Commercial {{barbecue}} <b>grills</b> can be stationary or transportable. An {{example of}} a stationary <b>grill</b> is a built-in pit <b>grill,</b> for indoor or outdoor use. Construction materials include bricks, mortar, concrete, tile and cast iron. Most commercial barbecue <b>grills,</b> however, are mobile, allowing the operator to take the <b>grill</b> wherever the job is. Transportable commercial barbecue <b>grills</b> can be units with removable legs, <b>grills</b> that fold, and <b>grills</b> mounted entirely on trailers.|$|R
5|$|Cranor spent $42 million {{restructuring}} the company's operations worldwide. He invested an additional $50 million to refurbish outlets and $20 {{million on a}} new computer system to link outlet cash registers to the kitchen, drive-through window, manager's office and company headquarters. Cranor also expanded the chain into non-traditional locations, beginning with a 150 sq ft limited menu kiosk at a General Motors assembly plant in Dayton, Ohio. Between 1986 and 1991, the chain built a further 2,000 outlets to bring its total number to 8,500, and sales grew from $3.5 to $6.2 billion. The chain {{had to contend with}} the rise of <b>grilled</b> chicken as Americans became increasingly health conscious. KFC found itself competing against the growing El Pollo Loco restaurant chain, as well as with Burger King, which had just introduced the BK Broiler, a <b>grilled</b> chicken burger. Delays in product development, cramped kitchens and the ongoing franchisee contract dispute prevented the chain from rolling out a <b>grilled</b> product of its own.|$|E

5000|$|During the 1990s, {{double-sided}} <b>grilling</b> {{was popular}} in the USA using consumer electrical <b>grills</b> (e.g., the popular George Foreman <b>Grill).</b> US marketers of electric double-sided <b>grilling</b> appliances opted for the global term 'grilling' rather than the geographically isolated term [...] "broiler." [...] Hinged double-sided <b>grills</b> are generically known as contact <b>grills.</b>|$|R

5|$|A <b>grilled</b> Italian sausage {{sandwich}} {{was sold}} in 1992 and was served with onions and peppers or parmigiana style with mozzarella cheese and marinara sauce. As part of the company's BK Dinner Baskets promotion in 1993, the chain introduced a <b>grilled</b> meatloaf sandwich with ketchup and onions in the United States. In 2013, Burger King sold a bratwurst sandwich in a regional limited time offering in the US states of Wisconsin and Illinois. The sandwich featured a bratwurst manufactured by Johnsonville Foods, raw onion and yellow mustard. Despite being discontinued, versions of the steak sandwich have been re-released several times since the 1970s. The BK Dinner baskets featured a steak sandwich, and in 2003 Burger King New Zealand introduced the Big Bloke Steak Sandwich which was almost identical to the 1979 sandwich.|$|E
5|$|Another failed product, {{this time}} under Grand Metropolitan's {{successor}} Diageo, was the BK Back Porch Grillers line of burgers that featured a spiced and flavored patty {{served on a}} bakery-style roll. There were two varieties: The Regular served with mayonnaise, whole leaf iceberg lettuce, tomato and <b>grilled</b> onions, and the Bacon Cheddar, with bacon and smoked cheddar cheese. There was one LTO variety, the Black Stack Griller, made with Black Strap Barbecue sauce (a strong molasses-flavored sauce), Swiss cheese, bacon, and onions, to promote Men in Black II. The Griller patty was flavored so {{that it had a}} taste similar to a hamburger that had been <b>grilled</b> over a charcoal-fired grill.|$|E
50|$|Like most {{traditional}} smokers, early pellet <b>grills</b> {{were limited to}} indirect cooking methods such as smoking, roasting, and baking. However, thanks to improvements in construction and advancements in digital controllers, modern pellet <b>grills</b> can produce higher temperatures. Whereas early units struggled to reach 450 °F, some pellet <b>grills</b> can now easily achieve temperatures in excess of 550 °F. Louisiana <b>Grills,</b> Fast Eddy's by Cookshack, and Yoder Smokers YS Series have pellet <b>grills</b> with an upper limit of 600 °F. Some pellet <b>grills</b> can reach 600-700 °F, depending on the model. The ability to achieve high temperatures has enabled some manufacturers to design pellet <b>grills</b> that can handle both indirect and direct cooking. Brands such as Memphis Wood Fire <b>Grills,</b> Fast Eddy’s by Cookshack, Louisiana <b>Grills,</b> Yoder Smokers, and FireCraft make pellet <b>grills</b> that offer the option of open fire grilling.31 This is usually accomplished through a removable or adjustable plate that allows flames through {{a portion of the}} pellet <b>grill's</b> deflector plate.|$|R
50|$|The square {{charcoal}} <b>grill</b> is {{a hybrid}} of the brazier and the kettle <b>grill.</b> It has a shallow pan like the brazier and normally a simple method of adjusting the heat, if any. However, it has a lid like a kettle <b>grill</b> and basic adjustable vents. The square charcoal grille is, as expected, priced between the brazier and kettle <b>grill,</b> with the most basic models priced around {{the same as the}} most expensive braziers and the most expensive models competing with basic kettle <b>grills.</b> These <b>grills</b> are available at discount stores and have largely displaced most larger braziers. Square charcoal <b>grills</b> almost exclusively have four legs with two wheels on the back so the <b>grill</b> can be tilted back using the handles for the lid to roll the <b>grill.</b> More expensive examples have baskets and shelves mounted on the <b>grill.</b>|$|R
50|$|Due to {{increased}} demand for home <b>grills,</b> Char-Broil began to mass-produce gas <b>grills</b> in the 1960s. In 1961, Char-Broil patented the first grease-handling system for an outdoor <b>grill</b> to make <b>grilling</b> safer and easier. In the 1970s, {{they were the first}} to package the LP tank and <b>grill</b> in one box, which revolutionized the backyard <b>grill</b> industry. Char-Broil introduced the first electric <b>grills,</b> portable gas <b>grills</b> and table-top <b>grills</b> in the 1970s. In 1973, the Manufacturing Division moved from the Iron Works to a more modern plant in the Bradley Industrial Park and becomes known as W.C. Bradley Enterprises. Then in 1977, W.C. Bradley Enterprises became known as Char-Broil. In 1989, Char-Broil became a separate business division of the W.C. Bradley Company.|$|R
5|$|Beef steaks are {{commonly}} <b>grilled,</b> broiled or occasionally fried. <b>Grilled</b> beef steaks can be cooked at different temperatures, or for different lengths of time; the resulting cooked steak ranges from blue (very rare) to overdone. The most common {{characteristics of a}} rare steak is a soft, cold, red center. The outside is seared for flavor, while the inside is cooked to suit the diner's preference. Steaks cooked well-done are typically cooked throughout the entire cut of meat. For example, a beefsteak cooked well-done will not have any pinkness in the middle when sliced. Uncooked beef steak can be served raw, such as in steak tartare.|$|E
5|$|Chili-based hot sauces are {{prominent}} in Israeli food, and {{are based on}} green or red chili peppers. They are served with appetizers, felafel, casseroles and <b>grilled</b> meats, and are blended with hummus and tahina. Although originating primarily from North African and Yemenite immigrants, these hot sauces are now widely consumed.|$|E
5|$|Fresh fish {{is readily}} available, caught off Israel's coastal {{areas of the}} Mediterranean and the Red Sea, or in the Sea of Galilee, or raised in ponds {{in the wake of}} {{advances}} in fish farming in Israel. Fresh fish is served whole, in the Mediterranean style, <b>grilled,</b> or fried, dressed only with freshly squeezed lemon juice. Trout (called forel), gilthead seabream (called denisse), St. Peter's fish (known as 'musht') and other fresh fish are prepared this way. Fish are also eaten baked, with or without vegetables, or fried whole or in slices, or <b>grilled</b> over coals, and served with different sauces.|$|E
50|$|The {{charcoal}} cart <b>grill</b> {{is quite}} similar in appearance to a typical gas <b>grill.</b> The cart <b>grill</b> can be rectangular or kettle in design, has a hinged lid, cooking grid, charcoal grid, and is mounted to a cart with wheels and side tables. Most cart <b>grills</b> {{have a way}} to adjust heat, either through moving the cooking surface up, the charcoal pan down, through venting, or a combination of the three. Cart <b>grills</b> often have an ash collection drawer for easy removal of ashes while cooking. Their rectangular design makes them usable for indirect cooking as well. Charcoal cart <b>grills,</b> with all their features, can make charcoal <b>grilling</b> nearly as convenient as gas <b>grilling.</b> Cart <b>grills</b> can also be quite expensive.|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} {{and most}} inexpensive of charcoal <b>grills,</b> the brazier <b>grill</b> {{is made of}} wire and sheet metal and composed of a cooking grid placed over a charcoal pan. Usually the <b>grill</b> is supported by legs attached to the charcoal pan. The brazier <b>grill</b> {{does not have a}} lid or venting system. Heat is adjusted by moving the cooking grid up or down over the charcoal pan. Even after George Stephen invented the kettle <b>grill</b> in the early 1950s, the brazier <b>grill</b> remained a dominant charcoal <b>grill</b> type for a number of years. Brazier <b>grills</b> are available at most discount department stores during the summer.|$|R
50|$|Gas-fueled <b>grills</b> {{typically}} use propane (LP) {{or natural}} gas (NG) as their fuel source, with gas-flame either cooking food directly or heating <b>grilling</b> elements {{which in turn}} radiate the heat necessary to cook food. Gas <b>grills</b> are available in sizes ranging from small, single steak <b>grills</b> up to large, industrial sized restaurant <b>grills</b> which are able to cook enough meat to feed a hundred or more people. Gas <b>grills</b> are designed for either LP or NG, although it's possible to convert a <b>grill</b> from one gas source to another.|$|R
5|$|International {{fast-food}} restaurant chain Burger King and its Australian franchise Hungry Jack's {{have had a}} variety of <b>grilled</b> chicken sandwiches in their product portfolio since 1990. The BK Broiler was the first iteration, {{and was one of}} the most successful product introductions in the fast food industry to that point in time. However sales dropped in the following two years, and the product was reformulated and renamed to the Chicken Whopper to align the product with the company's Whopper Sandwich. A change of ownership of Burger King in 2004 prompted another reformulation of the product into the BK Baguette product line that focused on a more health-oriented product. This new formulation proved unpopular and was replaced in 2005 with the TenderGrill chicken sandwich. The TenderGrill sandwich was introduced as part of a series of sandwiches designed to expand Burger King's menu with both more sophisticated, adult oriented fare and present a larger, meatier product that appealed to 24- to 36-year-old males. Burger King was the first major fast food chain to introduce a <b>grilled</b> chicken sandwich to the marketplace, beating rivals Wendy's by six months and McDonald's by four years. These two chains also went through a series of reformulations and naming schemes for their <b>grilled</b> chicken products.|$|E
5|$|The company sells {{slightly}} {{different versions of}} the sandwich between international markets, using white meat chicken breast in some regions while using dark meat chicken thighs in others. To promote continuing interest in the product, Burger King occasionally releases limited-time (LTO) variants on its <b>grilled</b> chicken sandwiches that have different ingredients from the standard sandwich recipe. Being one of the company's major offerings, the <b>grilled</b> chicken sandwich is sometimes the center of product advertising for the company. Additionally, as a major product in the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered many global trademarks to protect its investment in the product.|$|E

As noted in its mottos and advertisements, BK cooks its burgers and <b>grilled</b> chicken on an {{automated}} grill, while its other chicken products, fish, sides, and breakfast sausage are deep-fried in vegetable oil. BK prepares its biscuits, cinnamon rolls, and cookies by baking in a convection oven and microwaves its BK Veggie burger patty.|$|E
5|$|Chicken {{hearts are}} {{considered}} to be giblets, and are often <b>grilled</b> on skewers: Japanese hāto yakitori, Brazilian churrasco de coração, Indonesian chicken heart satay. They can also be pan-fried, as in Jerusalem mixed grill. In Egyptian cuisine, they can be used, finely chopped, as part of stuffing for chicken. Many recipes combined them with other giblets, such as the Mexican pollo en menudencias and the Russian ragu iz kurinyikh potrokhov.|$|E
5|$|Commercially {{produced}} bottled sauces for {{steak and}} pre-mixed spices are also popular. In 2012 in the U.S., A1 Steak Sauce had slightly over 50% {{of the market}} share for all meat sauce products, and was the category leader. Montreal steak seasoning is a spice mix used to flavor steak and <b>grilled</b> meats {{that was based on}} the pickling dry-rub mix used in preparing Montreal smoked meat.|$|E
5000|$|... "Pellet grills", {{sometimes}} referred to as pellet smokers, are backyard cookers that combine elements of charcoal smokers, gas <b>grills,</b> and kitchen ovens. Fueled by wood pellets, pellet <b>grills</b> infuse food with smoky flavor associated with charcoal <b>grills</b> and smokers, but offer the convenience of gas <b>grills</b> and the temperature control of an indoor oven. They have the ability to smoke as well as <b>grill</b> and bake using an electronic control panel to automatically feed fuel to the fire, regulate the <b>grill’s</b> airflow, and maintain consistent cooking temperatures. The best pellet <b>grills</b> also utilize sophisticated sensors and advanced algorithms for precision temperature control.|$|R
