Sequential hashing corresponds to a hop tree with a single message node, which means that 11 is appended to the message before RawSHAKE is applied.

40|$|Abstract. Recent domain {{adaptation}} methods successfully learn crossdomain transforms to map points between {{source and}} target domains. Yet, these methods are either restricted {{to a single}} training domain, or assume that the <b>separation</b> into source <b>domains</b> is known a priori. However, most available training data contains multiple unknown domains. In this paper, we present both a novel domain transform mixture model which outperforms a single transform model when multiple domains are present, and a novel constrained clustering method that successfully discovers latent domains. Our discovery method {{is based on a}} novel hierarchical clustering technique that uses available object category information to constrain the set of feasible <b>domain</b> <b>separations.</b> To illustrate the effectiveness of our approach we present experiments on two commonly available image datasets with and without known domain labels: in both cases our method outperforms baseline techniques which use no domain adaptation or domain adaptation methods that presume a single underlying domain shift. ...|$|R
40|$|In this study, the {{polyurethane}} {{were prepared}} from 4, 4 ’-diphenyl methane diisocyanate (MDI) and various molecular weights of polyols. The physical properties {{were determined by}} fourier transformation infrared spectrophotometer (FTIR), stress-strain test, swelling ratio, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer (NMR), gel permeation chromatographer (GPC). The thermal properties were investigated by thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning colorimeter (DSC), and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). The blood compatibility is determined by relative index of platelet adhesion (RIPA). <b>Domain</b> <b>separation</b> of the resulting polyurethanes occurs during polymerization because of the immiscibility of polyols. In this study, the <b>domain</b> <b>separation</b> during polyurethane polymerization was made due to the immiscibility of hydrophilic and hydrophobic polyols. The hydrophilic/hydrophobic domain-separated structure changes surface tension and constitutes the hydrophilic domains and hydrophobic domains of the polyurethane. It reduces the adhesion of blood platelet on the materials.

40|$|Integrins play an {{essential}} role in hemostasis, thrombosis, and cell migration, and they transmit bidirectional signals. Transmembrane/cytoplasmic domains are hypothesized to associate in the resting integrins; whereas, ligand binding and intracellular activating signals induce transmembrane <b>domain</b> <b>separation.</b> However, how this conformational change affects integrin outside-in signaling and whether the α subunit cytoplasmic domain is important for this signaling remain elusive. Using Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells that stably expressed different integrin αIIbβ 3 constructs, we discovered that an αIIb cytoplasmic domain truncation led to integrin activation but not defective outside-in signaling. In contrast, preventing transmembrane <b>domain</b> <b>separation</b> abolished both inside-out and outside-in signaling regardless of removing the αIIb cytoplasmic tail. Truncation of the αIIb cytoplasmic tail did not obviously affect adhesion-induced outside-in signaling. Our research revealed that transmembrane <b>domain</b> <b>separation</b> is a downstream conformational change after the cytoplasmic domain dissociation in inside-out activation and indispensable for ligand-induced outside-in signaling. The result implicates that the β TM helix rearrangement after dissociation is essential for integrin transmembrane signaling.

40|$|The {{structure}} of many secure systems {{has been based}} on the idea of a security kernel—an operating system nucleus that performs all trusted functions. The difficulty with this approach is that the security kernel tends to be rather large, complex, and unstructured. This paper proposes an alternative structure for secure embedded systems. The structure comprises three layers. At the bottom is a <b>Domain</b> <b>Separation</b> Mechanism which is responsible for maintaining isolated “domains ” (also known as “processes ” or “virtual machines”) and for providing controlled channels for their intercommunication. The other resources of the system (for example, devices and the more abstract entities, such as file systems, built upon them) are each controlled by independent resource managers which comprise the second layer of the system. The applications code provides the third layer. Components in both the resource management and applications layers are protected from each other by the <b>domain</b> <b>separation</b> mechanism. The Trusted Computing Base is composed of the <b>domain</b> <b>separation</b> mechanism and a reference validation mechanism associated with each resource. The benefit of this approach is that it leads to a separation of concerns: each component of the embedded system performs a single, well-defined activity and can be understood (and verified) in relative isolation from all other components. Implementation and language issues are also discussed. ...|$|E

Thus living cells may utilize membrane line tension energies as a control mechanism of exocytic events...|$|E

The desired low-cost, low-power and fully integrated implementation of MIMO OFDM systems leads to the application of direct (up/down) conversion architec-ture, whose performance can be seriously limited by the RF impairment I/Q imbalance. Thus, the compensation of I/Q imbalance is a crucial issue {{in the implementation of}} MI-MO OFDM systems, which requires reliable parameter estimation. In this paper, we first present an overview of I/Q-imbalance compensation in MIMO OFDM systems. After-wards, we propose three preamble assisted schemes for efficient joint estimation of the MIMO channel and frequency-selective transmiter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) I/Q imbalance. Correspondingly, three advanced preamble designs are presented, incl. a preamble based on Time <b>Domain</b> <b>Separation</b> (TDS), a preamble based on Frequency <b>Domain</b> <b>Separation</b> (FDS) and a multi-functional preamble. All preamble designs allow low overhead and low Crest-Factor (CF). Based on these preamble designs, low complexity estimators are developed, which can achieve performance close to the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRL-B). Numerical simulation results and complexity analysis have verified the advantages of the proposed schemes over the existing schemes. Finally, we discuss how to select the most appropriate scheme- out of the proposed three- by considering a tradeoff between performance, complexity and overhead...|$|E
