5|$|In {{order to}} compare {{individual}} striations, examiners must obtain a known sample using the seized weapon. For slower-traveling bullets, such as pistols or revolvers, known bullet exemplars {{are created by}} firing the weapon into a water tank. The spent bullet can be recovered, intact, as the water slows down the bullet before it can reach the tank walls, allowing {{for it to be}} recovered. For faster traveling bullets, such as those fired from high-powered rifles and military style weapons, water tanks cannot be used as the tank will not provide enough stopping power for the projectiles. To <b>examine</b> <b>these</b> weapons, investigators must fire them at a target at a controlled range with enough backing to stop the bullet and collect the spent round after it has been fired.|$|E
5|$|The most {{frequently}} used argument in favour of dualism appeals to the common-sense intuition that conscious experience is distinct from inanimate matter. If asked what the mind is, the average person would usually respond by identifying it with their self, their personality, their soul, or some other such entity. They would almost certainly deny that the mind simply is the brain, or vice versa, finding {{the idea that there}} is just one ontological entity at play to be too mechanistic, or simply unintelligible. Many modern philosophers of mind think that these intuitions are misleading and that we should use our critical faculties, along with empirical evidence from the sciences, to <b>examine</b> <b>these</b> assumptions to determine whether there is any real basis to them.|$|E

25|$|In physics one {{separates}} {{the laws of}} motion, called kinematics, from the laws of force, called dynamics. Following the classical kinematics of Newton's laws of motion, the kinematics of quantum mechanics is built {{in such a way}} that it presupposes nothing about the time reversal symmetry of the dynamics. In other words, if the dynamics are invariant, then the kinematics will allow it to remain invariant; if the dynamics is not, then the kinematics will also show this. The structure of the quantum laws of motion are richer, and we <b>examine</b> <b>these</b> next.|$|E
25|$|Today, it is {{becoming}} increasingly popular to analyze the environmental impacts of natural resource utilization, especially for energy usage. To understand the ramifications of these practices, exergy is utilized as a tool for determining the impact potential of emissions, fuels, and other sources of energy. Combustion of fossil fuels, for example, is examined with respect to assessing the environmental impacts of burning coal, oil, and natural gas. The current methods for analyzing the emissions from these three products can be compared to the process of determining the exergy of the systems affected; specifically, it is useful to <b>examine</b> <b>these</b> with regard to the reference state environment of gases within the atmosphere. In this way, it is easier to determine how human action is affecting the natural environment.|$|E

Therefore, knowledge of the temporally varying absorptive effects of photopolymer materials becomes an important factor. In this paper, the time varying absorptive effects of an acrylamide/polyvinylalcohol photopolymer material are <b>examined.</b> <b>These</b> effects are divided into three main photochemical processes, which following identification, are theoretically and experimentally <b>examined.</b> <b>These</b> processes are (i) photon absorption, (ii) photosensitizer recovery, and (iii) photosensitizer bleaching...|$|R

[...] They went on to recommend that a commission of inquiry be sent to Lord Bellomont to <b>examine</b> <b>these</b> matters with the view to issuing a quo warranto against Rhode Island's charter.
