5|$|Steven Soderbergh {{had been}} {{interested}} in making a film about the drug wars for some time but {{did not want to}} make one about addicts. Producer Laura Bickford obtained the rights to the United Kingdom mini-series Traffik (1989) and liked its structure. Soderbergh, who had seen the mini-series in 1990, started looking for a screenwriter to adapt it into a film. They read a script by Stephen Gaghan called Havoc, about upper-class white kids in Palisades High School doing drugs and <b>getting</b> <b>involved</b> <b>with</b> gangs. Soderbergh approached Gaghan to work on his film, but found he was already working for producer/director Edward Zwick. Bickford and Soderbergh approached Zwick, who agreed to merge the two projects and come aboard as a producer.|$|E
5|$|During {{the time}} that Benchley was filming various short films, he also began working at The New Yorker, which had started in February 1925 {{under the control of}} Benchley's friend Harold Ross. While Benchley, along with many of his Algonquin acquaintances, was wary of <b>getting</b> <b>involved</b> <b>with</b> another {{publication}} for various reasons, he completed some freelance work for The New Yorker over the first few years, and was later invited to be newspaper critic. Benchley initially wrote the column under the pseudonym Guy Fawkes (the lead conspirator in the English Gunpowder Plot), and the column was well received. Benchley tackled issues ranging from careless reporting to European fascism, and the publication flourished. He was invited to be theatre critic for The New Yorker in 1929, leaving Life, and contributions from Woollcott and Parker became regular features in the magazine. The New Yorker published an average of forty-eight Benchley columns per year during the early 1930s.|$|E
5|$|Mark's early storylines often {{revolved}} around {{his relationship with}} Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer). He was initially wary of <b>getting</b> <b>involved</b> <b>with</b> Kate because of her ex-boyfriend, Declan Napier (Erin Mullally), and the age gap between them. Mark's focus on his work eventually forced him to choose between Kate and Paul's case. Following {{the end of his}} relationship with Kate, Mark had a one-night stand with her best friend Jade Mitchell (Gemma Pranita). He also faced problems at work after reporting a fellow officer for corruption, which led to his life being threatened. Mark left for witness protection during a special real-time episode. Mark later returned during an eclipse and tried to win Kate back. Following her death, he embarked on a relationship with Paige Smith (Olympia Valance) and three members of his family were introduced. The character has been mostly well received by critics and viewers during his time on the show.|$|E

25|$|Mother Courage {{is among}} Brecht's most famous plays. Some {{directors}} consider {{it to be}} the greatest play of the 20th century.

Epic plays are a distinct genre typical of Brecht. Some critics believe that he created the form.|$|E

25|$|Though the duo never stated so outright, their {{additional}} {{motivation in}} <b>getting</b> <b>involved</b> <b>with</b> KK Partizan again was {{perceived to be}} gaining the upper hand on the club's eventual privatisation process once the new Law on Sports gets passed in the Serbian parliament. Since the exact ownership structure of a publicly owned KK Partizan wasn't and still isn't really clear, potential investors decided to stay away, {{at least until the}} law appears. Divac and Danilović appeared pretty much out of nowhere in this regard but enjoyed plenty of fan and public support because most preferred to see their beloved club owned and operated by its former stars rather than a faceless corporation or a group of politicians, managers or businessmen close to the ruling coalition. However, after a few years the duo ran out of patience and pulled out of the venture in late 2004 because it became too much of a financial burden with no end-goal in sight. While he stopped performing any official functions at the club, Divac continues to be involved with it in a lesser capacity.|$|E
