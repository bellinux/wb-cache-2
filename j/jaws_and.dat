50|$|Cartilaginous fishes, such as {{sharks and}} rays, have {{one set of}} oral jaws made mainly of cartilage. They do not have {{pharyngeal}} jaws. Generally <b>jaws</b> are articulated <b>and</b> oppose vertically, comprising an upper <b>jaw</b> <b>and</b> a lower <b>jaw</b> <b>and</b> can bear numerous ordered teeth. Bony fishes usually develop only one set of teeth (monophyodont). Cartilaginous fishes grow multiple sets (polyphyodont) and replace teeth as they wear.|$|R
5000|$|Jaws (teeth): Strong jaws. 42 teeth - 20 in {{the upper}} <b>jaw</b> <b>and</b> 22 in the lower <b>jaw.</b> Large <b>and</b> white teeth, well adapted to each other. Scissor bite or pincer bite.|$|R
5|$|The viper dogfish feeds {{primarily}} on bony fishes, notably lanternfishes in the genera Benthosema and Diaphus, and also takes crustaceans. Its long <b>jaws</b> <b>and</b> slender teeth are adapted for grasping rather than cutting, {{in contrast to}} the short <b>jaws</b> <b>and</b> saw-like lower teeth of other dogfish sharks that are suited for excising chunks of meat. Prey is seized by a rapid extension of the <b>jaws</b> <b>and</b> swallowed whole; the shark can consume fish close to 40% as long as itself. The viper dogfish is the only dogfish species that lacks a suborbital muscle, which is normally responsible for pulling the jaws forward when biting. Jaw protrusion is instead effected by the hyomandibular bone, which is articulated to the skull in a manner that allows it to swing down and forward. This unique arrangement serves to increase the distance the shark can protrude its jaws, as well as the size of its gape both vertically and horizontally.|$|E
5|$|Jaws: The Revenge is a 1987 American horror thriller film. It was {{the final}} {{theatrical}} film to be directed by Joseph Sargent. It is the third sequel to Steven Spielberg's <b>Jaws</b> <b>and</b> the fourth and final installment in the Jaws franchise.|$|E
5|$|Lamniformes: They are {{commonly}} known as the mackerel sharks. They include the goblin shark, basking shark, megamouth shark, the thresher sharks, shortfin and longfin mako sharks, and great white shark.

5|$|Blacknose {{sharks are}} preyed upon by larger sharks, and captives have been {{observed}} to perform an apparent threat display towards encroaching divers or newly introduced members of their species. The display consists of the shark hunching its back, lowering its pectoral fins, gaping its <b>jaws,</b> <b>and</b> swimming with an exaggerated side-to-side motion. Known parasites of this species include the copepods Nesippus orientalis, Perissopus dentatus, Pandarus sinuatus, Kroyeria sphyrnae, Nemesis atlantica, and Eudactylina spinifera, as well as tapeworms in the genera Paraorygmatobothrium and Platybothrium.|$|E
5|$|Early species had long, fully toothed <b>jaws</b> <b>and</b> long tails, {{while later}} forms had a highly reduced tail, and some lacked teeth. Many sported furry coats {{made up of}} hair-like {{filaments}} known as pycnofibers, which covered their bodies and parts of their wings. Pterosaurs spanned {{a wide range of}} adult sizes, from the very small anurognathids to the largest known flying creatures of all time, including Quetzalcoatlus and Hatzegopteryx.|$|E

5|$|The Texas {{pocket gopher}} avoids {{emerging}} {{onto the surface}} to feed by seizing the roots of plants with its <b>jaws</b> <b>and</b> pulling them downwards into its burrow. It also practices coprophagy. The African pouched rat forages on the surface, gathering anything that might be edible into its capacious cheek pouches until its face bulges out sideways. It then returns to its burrow to sort through the material it has gathered and eats the nutritious items.|$|E
5|$|The {{first ever}} LaserDisc title marketed in North America was the MCA DiscoVision release of Jaws in 1978. A second LaserDisc was {{released}} in 1992, before a third and final version came out under MCA/Universal Home Video's Signature Collection imprint in 1995. This release was an elaborate boxset that included deleted scenes and outtakes, a new two-hour documentary on {{the making of the}} film directed and produced by Laurent Bouzereau, a copy of the novel <b>Jaws,</b> <b>and</b> a CD of John Williams's soundtrack.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis study aims to quantitatively {{clarify the}} {{physiological}} features in rhythmically coordinated <b>jaw</b> <b>and</b> neck muscle EMG activities while chewing gum using EMG-EMG transfer function and EMG-EMG coherence function analyses in 20 healthy subjects. The chewing side masseter muscle EMG signal {{was used as}} the reference signal, while the other jaw (non-chewing side masseter muscle, bilateral anterior temporal muscles, and bilateral anterior digastric muscles) and neck muscle (bilateral sternocleidomastoid muscles) EMG signals were used as the examined signals in EMG-EMG transfer function and EMG-EMG coherence function analyses. Chewing-related <b>jaw</b> <b>and</b> neck muscle activities were aggregated in the first peak of the power spectrum in rhythmic chewing. The gain in the peak frequency represented the power relationships between <b>jaw</b> <b>and</b> neck muscle activities during rhythmic chewing. The phase in the peak frequency represented the temporal relationships between the <b>jaw</b> <b>and</b> neck muscle activities, while the non-chewing side neck muscle presented a broad range of distributions across <b>jaw</b> closing <b>and</b> opening phases. Coherence in the peak frequency represented the synergistic features in bilateral <b>jaw</b> closing muscles <b>and</b> chewing side neck muscle activities. The coherence and phase in non-chewing side neck muscle activities exhibited a significant negative correlation. From above, the bilateral coordination between the <b>jaw</b> <b>and</b> neck muscle activities is estimated while chewing when the non-chewing side neck muscle is synchronously activated with the jaw closing muscles, while the unilateral coordination is estimated when the non-chewing side neck muscle is irregularly activated in the jaw opening phase. Thus, the occurrence of bilateral or unilateral coordinated features in the <b>jaw</b> <b>and</b> neck muscle activities may correspond to the phase characteristics in the non-chewing side neck muscle activities during rhythmical chewing. Considering these novel findings in healthy subjects, EMG-EMG transfer function and EMG-EMG coherence function analyses may also be useful to diagnose the pathologically in-coordinated features in <b>jaw</b> <b>and</b> neck muscle activities in temporomandibular disorders and whiplash-associated disorders during critical chewing performance...|$|R

5|$|The first {{scientific}} {{description of}} the night shark was published by Cuban zoologist Felipe Poey in 1868, {{as part of a}} series of papers entitled Repertorio fisico-natural de la isla de Cuba. He based his description on a single set of <b>jaws</b> <b>and</b> gave it the name Hypoprion signatus. In 1973, Leonard Compagno synonymized the genus Hypoprion with Carcharhinus. No type specimen has been designated for this species. Its common name {{comes from the fact that}} it is mostly captured at night.|$|E
5|$|The sand whiting's {{distinctive}} {{body shape}} and mouth placement is an adaptation to bottom feeding, {{which is the}} predominant method of feeding for all whiting species. All larger whiting feed by using their protrusile <b>jaws</b> <b>and</b> tube-like mouths to suck up various types of prey from in, on or above the ocean substrate, as well as using their nose as a 'plough' to dig through the substrate.|$|E
5|$|The taxonomic affinities of the broad-billed parrot are un{{determine}}d. Considering {{its large}} <b>jaws</b> <b>and</b> other osteological features, the ornithologists Edward Newton and Hans Gadow thought {{it to be}} {{closely related to the}} Rodrigues parrot (Necropsittacus rodricanus) in 1893, but were unable to determine whether they both belonged in the same genus, since a crest was only known from the latter. The British ornithologist Graham S. Cowles instead found their skulls too dissimilar for them to be close relatives in 1987.|$|E

5|$|An aggressive, {{powerful}} apex predator, the {{silvertip shark}} feeds {{on a wide}} variety of bony fishes, as well as eagle rays, smaller sharks, and cephalopods. This species dominates other requiem sharks of equal size when competing for food, and larger individuals are often heavily scarred from conflicts with others of its species. As with other members of its family, the silvertip shark is viviparous, with females giving birth to one to 11 pups in the summer. Silvertip sharks are regarded as potentially dangerous to humans, as they often approach divers quite closely. This slow-reproducing species is taken by commercial fisheries for its meat, fins, skin, cartilage, and <b>jaws</b> <b>and</b> teeth, which has apparently led to local population declines or extirpations.|$|E
5|$|Apeomyoides savagei is {{a fossil}} rodent from the Miocene of the United States, the only {{species in the}} genus Apeomyoides. It is known from fragmentary <b>jaws</b> <b>and</b> {{isolated}} teeth from a site in the early Barstovian, around 15–16 million years ago, of Nevada. Together with other species from scattered localities in the United States, Japan, and Europe, Apeomyoides is classified in the subfamily Apeomyinae of the extinct rodent family Eomyidae. Apeomyines are a rare but widespread group {{that may have been}} adapted to a relatively dry habitat.|$|E
5|$|Compared to {{the nurse}} shark, the tawny nurse shark has a more placid {{disposition}} and will often allow divers to touch and play with it. However, it should be accorded respect due to its powerful <b>jaws</b> <b>and</b> sharp teeth. This species is caught by commercial fisheries across most of its range for meat, fins, liver oil, leather, and fishmeal. It is also esteemed as a game fish off Queensland, Australia, and {{is known for its}} habit of spitting water in the faces of its captors. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the tawny nurse shark as Vulnerable, with subpopulations in several areas already diminished or extirpated.|$|E
