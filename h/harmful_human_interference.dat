40|$|Intercropping, {{or the use}} of {{different}} aspects of the interaction between organisms in ecosystems, can be classified as an ecological method that limits <b>harmful</b> <b>human</b> <b>interference</b> in the environment, especially the consumption of chemicals. The impact of intercropping carrot with coriander Coriandrum sativum L. and summer savory Satureja hortensis L. on the occurrence of select carrot pests was estimated in the years 2010 - 2011. Intercropping had a significant effect on the decrease of the number of roots damaged by carrot rust fly Psila rosae. During harvest, the least number of damaged roots was observed in combination with summer savory S. hortensis L. The number of carrot psyllid Trioza viridula Zett. and aphids on carrot leaves and roots damaged by nematodes was significantly lower on plots where carrot was intercropped. Intercropping both herbs had a positive influence on the number of beneficial insects. In all of the years of the study, the highest number of Coccinellidae and Syrphidae were observed on plots where carrot was intercropped with coriander...|$|E
40|$|Intercropping {{combines}} {{different aspects}} of the interaction between organisms in ecosystems and may be classified as a pro-ecological method of plant cultivation limiting the <b>harmful</b> <b>human</b> <b>interference</b> in the environment, especially the use of chemicals. It also allows high yield, good quality, and economic productivity to be achieved. The aim of the present study, conducted in the years 2003 – 2004 in Mydlniki near Kraków, was to determine the effect of intercropping carrot Nardin F 1 with French marigold (Tagetes patula nana L.) 'Kolombina' and pot marigold (Calendula officinalis L.) 'Promyk' on carrot yield, its quality, and the occurrence of pests. On average in both years of the study, intercropping did not reduce total or marketable carrot yield. In 2003 intercropping contributed to a significant increase in marketable yield compared with yield from sole cropping. In 2004 the dry matter content was higher in the roots of carrots grown with pot marigold. The treatments intercropped with both French and pot marigold were characterized by an increased content of sugars in carrot roots and in 2004 year – of carotenoids. Intercropping had a significant effect on the number of roots damaged by the carrot rust fly, Psila rosae, (the best in this respect was the combination with Tagetes) and by nematodes (the best in this respect was the combination with Calendula). The number of larvae of carrot psyllid, Trioza viridula, was significantly lower in the plots where carrot was intercropped. The study did not find intercropping to {{have a positive effect on}} reducing the occurrence of the root aphid...|$|E
50|$|Though {{the species}} {{has not been}} {{specifically}} evaluated to {{determine the amount of}} threat of extinction, it is known that the species is neither commonly seen nor very widespread in its habitat distribution.

40|$|Cracking in {{concrete}} {{is very common}} owing to drying shrinkage, freeze-thaw cycles, alkali-silica reaction, delayed ettringite formation, reinforcement corrosion, creep and fatigue, etc. Since inspection and maintenance techniques for concrete infrastructure require onerous labor and high costs, self-healing of <b>harmful</b> cracks without <b>human</b> <b>interference</b> or intervention could be of great attraction. The goal {{of this study is}} to explore a new self-healing concept in which fungi are used as self-healing agent to promote calcium carbonate precipitation to fill the cracks {{in concrete}} infrastructure. Recent studies in the field of geomycology have shown that many species of fungi could play an important role in promoting calcium carbonate mineralization, but their application in self-healing concrete has not been reported. Therefore, a screening of different species of fungi has been conducted in this study. Our results showed that, despite the drastic pH increase due to the leaching of Ca(OH) 2 from concrete, the spores of Aspergillus nidulans (MAD 1445), a pH regulatory mutant, germinated into hyphal mycelium on concrete plates with growth only slightly weaker. Material characterization techniques have been employed, which confirmed that the crystals precipitated on the fungal hyphae were composed of calcite.
