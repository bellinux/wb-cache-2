25|$|Lenticular {{galaxies are}} {{unique in that}} they have a visible disk {{component}} as well as a prominent bulge component. They have much higher bulge-to-disk ratios than typical spirals and do not have the canonical spiral arm structure of late-type galaxies, yet may exhibit a central bar. This bulge dominance {{can be seen in the}} axis ratio (i.e. the ratio between the observed minor and major axial of a disk <b>galaxy)</b> <b>distribution</b> of a lenticular galaxy sample. The distribution for lenticular galaxies rises steadily in the range 0.25 to 0.85 whereas the distribution for spirals is essentially flat in that same range. Larger axial ratios can be explained by observing face-on disk galaxies or by having a sample of spheroidal (bulge-dominated) galaxies. Imagine looking at two disk galaxies edge-on, one with a bulge and one without a bulge. The galaxy with a prominent bulge will have a larger edge-on axial ratio compared to the galaxy without a bulge based on the definition of axial ratio. Thus a sample of disk galaxies with prominent spheroidal components will have more galaxies at larger axial ratios. The fact that the lenticular <b>galaxy</b> <b>distribution</b> rises with increasing observed axial ratio implies that lenticulars are dominated by a central bulge component.|$|E
25|$|Baryon {{acoustic}} oscillations (BAO) are regular, {{periodic fluctuations}} in {{the density of the}} visible baryonic matter (normal matter) of the universe. These are predicted to arise in the Lambda-CDM model due to the early universe's acoustic oscillations in the photon-baryon fluid and can be observed in the cosmic microwave background angular power spectrum. BAOs set up a preferred length scale for baryons. As the dark matter and baryons clumped together after recombination, the effect is much weaker in the <b>galaxy</b> <b>distribution</b> in the nearby universe, but is detectable as a subtle (~ 1 percent) preference for pairs of galaxies to be separated by 147 Mpc, compared to those separated by 130 or 160 Mpc. This feature was predicted theoretically in the 1990s and then discovered in 2005, in two large galaxy redshift surveys, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey. Combining the CMB observations with BAO measurements from galaxy redshift surveys provides a precise estimate of the Hubble constant and the average matter density in the Universe. The results support the Lambda-CDM model.|$|E

Another analysis of luminous red galaxies (LRGs) in the SDSS data calculated the fractal dimension of <b>galaxy</b> <b>distribution</b> (on a scales from 70 to 100 Mpc/h) at 3, consistent with homogeneity; but that the fractal dimension is 2 [...] "out to roughly 20 Mpc/h".|$|E
40|$|We analyze a set {{of volume}} limited samples from SDSS DR 12 to {{quantify}} the degree of inhomogeneity at different length scales using Shannon entropy. We find that the <b>galaxy</b> <b>distributions</b> exhibit {{a higher degree of}} inhomogeneity as compared to a Poisson point process at all length scales. Our analysis indicates that signatures of inhomogeneities in the <b>galaxy</b> <b>distributions</b> persist at least upto a length scale of 120 h^- 1 Mpc. The <b>galaxy</b> <b>distributions</b> appear to be homogeneous on a scale of 140 h^- 1 Mpc and beyond.

40|$|We {{examine the}} spatial <b>distribution</b> of <b>galaxies</b> in the Numerical Galaxy Catalog, {{which is based}} on a {{hierarchical}} clustering framework. This catalog is constructed from a semianalytic model of galaxy formation combined with high-resolution N-body simulations in a A-dominated flat cold dark-matter cosmological model. To quantify the spatial <b>distribution</b> of <b>galaxies,</b> we use a graph-theoretical approach, because {{it is one of the}} most powerful statistical ways of estimating spatial data. In particular, three types of graphs are adopted: the Delaunay graph, the minimal spanning tree, and the constellation graph. To quantify the <b>galaxy</b> <b>distributions,</b> we apply statistical measures suitable for each type. The mass distributions in the cold dark-matter universe are also examined to clarify differences in the spatial distribution of dark matter and <b>galaxies.</b> The spatial <b>distribution</b> of <b>galaxies</b> in the two-degree field (2 dF) galaxy redshift survey is finally compared with that in the Numerical Galaxy Catalog. From our analysis, we definitely show that <b>galaxy</b> <b>distributions</b> in the Numerical Galaxy Catalog are different from the dark-matter distributions. We also find that the Numerical Galaxy Catalog considerably improves the theoretical prediction of spatial <b>galaxy</b> <b>distributions,</b> although it does not do enough to reproduce the 2 dF galaxy redshift survey. Finally, we show that the constellation graph and the minimal spanning tree are convenient for quantifing the <b>galaxy</b> <b>distributions</b> in an objective manner...|$|R
40|$|We use {{information}} entropy {{to analyze the}} anisotropy in the mock galaxy catalogues from dark matter distribution and simulated biased <b>galaxy</b> <b>distributions</b> from ΛCDM N-body simulation. We show that one can recover the linear bias parameter of the simulated <b>galaxy</b> <b>distributions</b> by comparing the radial, polar and azimuthal anisotropies in the simulated <b>galaxy</b> <b>distributions</b> with that from the dark matter distribution. This method for determination of the linear bias requires only O(N) operations as compared to O(N^ 2) or at least O(N N) operations required for the methods based on the two-point correlation function and the power spectrum. We apply this method to determine the linear bias parameter for the galaxies in the 2 MASS Redshift Survey (2 MRS) and find that the 2 MRS galaxies in the K_s band have a linear bias of ∼ 1. 3.

2500|$|Large galaxy {{redshift}} surveys {{may be used}} to make {{a three-dimensional}} map of the <b>galaxy</b> <b>distribution.</b> These maps are slightly distorted because distances are estimated from observed redshifts; the redshift contains a contribution from the galaxy's so-called peculiar velocity in addition to the dominant Hubble expansion term. On average, superclusters are expanding but more slowly than the cosmic mean due to their gravity, while voids are expanding faster than average. In a redshift map, galaxies in front of a supercluster have excess radial velocities towards it and have redshifts slightly higher than their distance would imply, while galaxies behind the supercluster have redshifts slightly low for their distance. [...] This effect causes superclusters to appear [...] "squashed" [...] in the radial direction, and likewise voids are [...] "stretched"; angular positions are unaffected.|$|E

The evolution of the scalar field is akin to that of tracker quintessence fields. We expand the theory to linear order to find the evolution of perturbations on large scales.

40|$|The {{standard}} structure formation model {{based on}} a LCDM cosmology predicts that the galaxy clusters have triaxial shapes and that the cluster galaxies have a strong tendency to be located preferentially along the major axes of host cluster's dark matter distributions due to the gravitational tidal effect. The predicted correlations between dark matter and <b>galaxy</b> <b>distributions</b> in triaxial clusters are insensitive to the initial cosmological parameters and to the galaxy bias, and thus can provide a unique test-bed for the nonlinear structure formation of the LCDM cosmology. Recently, Oguri et al. determined robustly the dark matter <b>distributions</b> in the <b>galaxy</b> clusters using the two dimensional weak lensing shear fitting and showed that the orientations of the cluster <b>galaxy</b> <b>distributions</b> are only very weakly correlated {{with those of the}} underlying dark matter distributions determined robustly, which is in contrast to with the LCDM-based prediction. We reanalyze and compare quantitatively the observational result with the LCDM-based prediction from the Millennium Run simulation {{with the help of the}} bootstrap resampling and generalized chi^{ 2 }-statistics. The hypothesis that the observational result is consistent with the LCDM-based prediction is ruled out at the 99 % confidence level. A local fifth force induced by a non-minimal coupling between dark energy and dark matter might be responsible for the observed misalignments between dark matter and <b>galaxy</b> <b>distributions</b> in triaxial clusters.
