5|$|An {{alternate}} pathway of endocytic processing {{had also}} been demonstrated wherein certain proteins like fibrinogen and myoglobin can bind as a whole to MHC-II molecules after they are <b>denatured</b> and their disulfide bonds are reduced (breaking the bond by adding hydrogen atoms across it). The proteases then degrade the exposed regions of the protein-MHC II-complex.|$|E
5|$|The human {{innovation}} {{of cooking}} {{may have been}} particularly helpful in overcoming many of the defensive chemicals of plants. Many enzyme inhibitors in cereal grains and pulses, such as trypsin inhibitors prevalent in pulse crops, are <b>denatured</b> by cooking, making them digestible.|$|E
5|$|Andersen {{was accused}} of crimes on several {{occasions}} in the post-war years, but was most often acquitted in court. Amongst the crimes {{of which he was}} charged but acquitted in court was the theft of building materials in 1954. Another time he was tricked into lending his car to two people who broke into a goldsmith's shop in Tønsberg. Strongly intoxicated {{at the time of the}} crime, he was charged but fully acquitted. In 1955 he was, however, convicted and sentenced to 36days in prison for selling 30bottles of <b>denatured</b> alcohol, alcohol that was supposed to have been used at his factory.|$|E
5|$|Infectious {{particles}} possessing {{nucleic acid}} are dependent upon it to direct their continued replication. Prions, however, are infectious by {{their effect on}} normal versions of the protein. Sterilizing prions, therefore, requires the denaturation of the protein to a state in which the molecule is {{no longer able to}} induce the abnormal folding of normal proteins. In general, prions are quite resistant to proteases, heat, ionizing radiation, and formaldehyde treatments, although their infectivity can be reduced by such treatments. Effective prion decontamination relies upon protein hydrolysis or reduction or destruction of protein tertiary structure. Examples include sodium hypochlorite, sodium hydroxide, and strongly acidic detergents such as LpH. 134°C (274°F) for 18 minutes in a pressurized steam autoclave {{has been found to be}} somewhat effective in deactivating the agent of disease. Ozone sterilization is currently being studied as a potential method for prion denaturation and deactivation. Renaturation of a completely <b>denatured</b> prion to infectious status has not yet been achieved; however, partially <b>denatured</b> prions can be renatured to an infective status under certain artificial conditions.|$|E
5|$|Processed {{pizza cheese}} is {{manufactured}} to produce optimal qualities in browning, melting, stretchiness and fat and moisture content. Several studies and experiments have analyzed {{the impact of}} vegetable oil, manufacturing and culture processes, <b>denatured</b> whey proteins and other changes to create ideal and economical pizza cheeses. In 1997, {{it was estimated that}} annual production of pizza cheese products was 2 billion pounds in the United States and 200 million pounds in Europe, and in 2000 demand for the product in Europe was increasing by 8% per year. The trend of steadily-increasing production and consumption of mozzarella and pizza cheese continued into {{the first decade of the}} 21st century in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Manufacturers aim for a {{moisture}} content of 50-to-52 percent and a fat-in-dry-matter content of 35-to-40 percent. A {{study published in}} the International Journal of Food & Science Technology found that a 12.5:87.5 blend of vetch milk and bovine milk improved stretchiness and melting characteristics. Vetch is a legume that has seeds which are similar to lentils. An experiment published in the International Journal of Dairy Technology suggested that the level of galactose, a monosaccharide sugar that is less sweet than glucose and fructose, can be reduced using different culture techniques. An article in the International Journal of Food Engineering found that trisodium citrate, a food additive used to preserve and add flavor to foods, slightly improved the preferred qualities of pizza cheese. Research published in Dairy Industries International suggested that <b>denatured</b> whey proteins increased moisture retention, but that the improvements were very slight and not economically worthwhile relative to the minor improvements.|$|E
5|$|The {{simulations}} run on Folding@home {{are used}} in conjunction with laboratory experiments, but researchers can use them to study how folding in vitro differs from folding in native cellular environments. This is advantageous in studying aspects of folding, misfolding, and their relationships to disease that are difficult to observe experimentally. For example, in 2011 Folding@home simulated protein folding inside a ribosomal exit tunnel, to help scientists better understand how natural confinement and crowding might influence the folding process. Furthermore, scientists typically employ chemical denaturants to unfold proteins from their stable native state. It is not generally known how the denaturant affects the protein's refolding, {{and it is difficult to}} experimentally determine if these <b>denatured</b> states contain residual structures which may influence folding behavior. In 2010, Folding@home used GPUs to simulate the unfolded states of ProteinL, and predicted its collapse rate in strong agreement with experimental results.|$|E

25|$|Proteins, unlike nucleic acids, {{can have}} varying charges and complex shapes, {{therefore}} {{they may not}} migrate into the polyacrylamide gel at similar rates, or at all, when placing a negative to positive EMF on the sample. Proteins therefore, are usually <b>denatured</b> {{in the presence of}} a detergent such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) that coats the proteins with a negative charge. Generally, the amount of SDS bound is relative to the size of the protein (usually 1.4g SDS per gram of protein), so that the resulting <b>denatured</b> proteins have an overall negative charge, and all the proteins have a similar charge-to-mass ratio. Since <b>denatured</b> proteins act like long rods instead of having a complex tertiary shape, the rate at which the resulting SDS coated proteins migrate in the gel is relative only to its size and not its charge or shape.|$|E

25|$|Thin layer {{chromatography}} (TLC) {{is a type}} of chromatography {{technique that}} is used characterized or separate lipids. The lipids are separated based on the polarity of the head groups or hydrophilic region not the hydrophobic region. Certain stains like iodine can be used to label the lipids but will sometimes destroy the lipids. This process {{can also be used to}} determine whether or not lipids have <b>denatured.</b> For example, originally a TLC analysis shows the presence of two lipids. One week later the same sample is reanalyzed but shows the presence of more lipids, which indicates the lipid has <b>denatured.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some diseases, such as tetanus, cause disease not by {{bacterial}} growth but by bacterial {{production of a}} toxin. Tetanus toxin is so lethal that humans cannot develop immunity to a natural infection, {{as the amount of}} toxin and time required to kill a person is much less than is required by the immune system to recognize the toxin and produce antibodies against it. However the tetanus toxin is easily <b>denatured</b> losing its ability to produce disease, but leaving it able to induce immunity to tetanus when injected into subjects. The <b>denatured</b> toxin is called a toxoid.|$|E
25|$|Cooked {{or canned}} {{pineapple}} {{does not have}} a tenderizing effect, as the enzymes are heat-labile and <b>denatured</b> in the cooking process.

25|$|Molecules {{other than}} {{proteins}} can be separated by 2D electrophoresis. In supercoiling assays, coiled DNA is separated {{in the first}} dimension and <b>denatured</b> by a DNA intercalator (such as ethidium bromide or the less carcinogenic chloroquine) in the second. This {{is comparable to the}} combination of native PAGE /SDS-PAGE in protein separation.|$|E
25|$|Other natural {{protease}} inhibitors {{are used}} as defense mechanisms. Common examples are the trypsin inhibitors found in the seeds of some plants, most notable for humans being soybeans, a major food crop, where they act to discourage predators. Raw soybeans are toxic to many animals, including humans, until the protease inhibitors they contain have been <b>denatured.</b>|$|E
25|$|Shellac {{should be}} {{considered}} in two different ways. It is used thinned with <b>denatured</b> alcohol as a finish and as a way to manipulate the wood's ability to absorb other finishes. The alcohol evaporates almost immediately to yield a finish that will attach to virtually any surface, even glass, and virtually any other finish can be used over it.|$|E
25|$|In around 2006, {{two teams}} {{attempted}} to extract DNA from a tooth discovered in 2003, but both teams were unsuccessful. It {{has been suggested}} that this happened because the dentine was targeted; new research suggests that the cementum has higher concentrations of DNA. Moreover, the heat generated by the high speed of the drill bit may have <b>denatured</b> the DNA.|$|E
25|$|Alloderm is donor tissue {{taken from}} cadavers and then <b>denatured,</b> {{purified}} and treated to remove viable cells that could pass along disease. Under a local anesthesia, Alloderm is placed into the mucosa, or body, of the lips in small rolls {{to make them}} larger. Alloderm can also be placed into the vermilion, the pink area of the lip, to provide definition and a sharper border.|$|E
25|$|Soil {{biology and}} {{chemistry}} can be seriously damaged by acid rain. Some microbes {{are unable to}} tolerate changes to low pH and are killed. The enzymes of these microbes are <b>denatured</b> (changed in shape so they no longer function) by the acid. The hydronium ions of acid rain also mobilize toxins such as aluminium, and leach away essential nutrients and minerals such as magnesium.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the unsuitability of {{microbiological}} techniques, milk pasteurization efficacy is typically monitored by checking for the presence of alkaline phosphatase, which is <b>denatured</b> by pasteurization. B. tuberculosis, the bacterium that requires the highest temperature to be killed of all milk pathogens is killed at ranges of temperature and time similar to those that denature alkaline phosphatase. For this reason, presence of alkaline phosphatase is an ideal indicator of pasteurization efficacy.|$|E
25|$|Gel {{electrophoresis}} is {{a common}} laboratory technique {{that can be used}} both as preparative and analytical method. The principle of electrophoresis relies on the movement of a charged ion in an electric field. In practice, the proteins are <b>denatured</b> in a solution containing a detergent (SDS). In these conditions, the proteins are unfolded and coated with negatively charged detergent molecules. The proteins in SDS-PAGE are separated on the sole basis of their size.|$|E
25|$|Pure ethanol and {{alcoholic}} beverages are heavily taxed as psychoactive drugs, but ethanol has many uses {{that do not}} involve its consumption. To relieve the tax burden on these uses, most jurisdictions waive the tax when an agent {{has been added to}} the ethanol to render it unfit to drink. These include bittering agents such as denatonium benzoate and toxins such as methanol, naphtha, and pyridine. Products of this kind are called <b>denatured</b> alcohol.|$|E
25|$|Annealing, in genetics, {{means for}} {{complementary}} sequences of single-stranded DNA or RNA to pair by hydrogen bonds {{to form a}} double-stranded polynucleotide. The term {{is often used to}} describe the binding of a DNA probe, or the binding of a primer to a DNA strand during a polymerase chain reaction. The term is also often used to describe the reformation (renaturation) of reverse-complementary strands that were separated by heat (thermally <b>denatured).</b> Proteins such as RAD52 can help DNA anneal.|$|E
25|$|In the {{original}} 1971 Molten Salt Breeder Reactor proposal, uranium reprocessing was scheduled every ten days {{as part of}} reactor operation. Subsequently, a once-through fueling design was proposed that limited uranium reprocessing to every thirty years {{at the end of}} useful salt life. A mixture of uranium-238 was called for to make sure recovered uranium would not be weapons grade. This design is referred to as <b>denatured</b> molten salt reactor. If reprocessing were to be prohibited then the uranium would be disposed with other fission products.|$|E
25|$|EIA (enzyme immunoassay) detects {{antibodies}} using a DNA-coated polystyrene microtitre plate. The DNA used {{in these}} assays is often recombinant dsDNA or from calf thymus extract. Upon incubation with serum containing anti-dsDNA antibodies, the antibodies will bind to the DNA and can then be visualised using enzyme-linked secondary antibodies. This assay can be quantitative or semi-quantitative, allowing for estimations of the levels of anti-dsDNA antibodies. This test can produce false positives due to contamination of ssDNA from <b>denatured</b> dsDNA. EIA detects low and high avidity anti-dsDNA antibodies, increasing its sensitivity and reducing its specificity.|$|E
25|$|Nucleic acid {{thermodynamics}} is {{the study}} of how temperature affects the nucleic acid structure of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). The melting temperature (Tm) is defined as the temperature at which half of the DNA strands are in the random coil or single-stranded (ssDNA) state. Tm depends on the length of the DNA molecule and its specific nucleotide sequence. DNA, when in a state where its two strands are dissociated (i.e., the dsDNA molecule exists as two independent strands), is referred to as having been <b>denatured</b> by the high temperature.|$|E
25|$|Mechanical {{removal of}} overpaint include {{physical}} techniques {{to remove the}} coating from the surface. On a glazed surface a sharp needle or scalpel can be used. If mechanical removal is not possible without damaging the surface then solvents can be used instead. The archetype solvents typically used are water, white spirit, industrial methylated spirits (<b>denatured</b> alcohol), acetone, and Dichloromethane which is usually found {{in the form of}} a commercial paint stripper. The appropriate solvent works by being applied to the ceramic surface by a cotton wool swab and is rolled on the surface rather than being wiped. Wiping the solvent on the surface will push the paint into the surface rather than lift it off.|$|E
25|$|The {{separated}} fragments {{are then}} transferred to a nitrocellulose or nylon filter; this procedure is called a Southern blot. The DNA fragments within the blot are permanently fixed to the filter, and the DNA strands are <b>denatured.</b> Radiolabeled probe molecules are then added that are complementary to sequences in the genome that contain repeat sequences. These repeat sequences tend to vary in length among different individuals and are called variable number tandem repeat sequences or VNTRs. The probe molecules hybridize to DNA fragments containing the repeat sequences and excess probe molecules are washed away. The blot is then exposed to an X-ray film. Fragments of DNA that have bound to the probe molecules appear as fluoresent bands on the film.|$|E
25|$|Pyridine {{is used as}} a {{precursor}} to agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals and is also an important solvent and reagent. Pyridine is added to ethanol to make it unsuitable for drinking (see <b>denatured</b> alcohol).

Some chemical compounds, although not synthesized from pyridine, contain its ring structure. They include B vitamins niacin and pyridoxine, the anti-tuberculosis drug isoniazid, nicotine and other nitrogen-containing plant products. Historically, pyridine was produced from coal tar and as a byproduct of coal gasification. However, increased demand for pyridine resulted in the development of more economical methods of synthesis from acetaldehyde and ammonia, and more than 20,000 tonnes per year are manufactured worldwide.|$|E
25|$|PCR greatly amplifies {{the amounts}} of a {{specific}} region of DNA. In the PCR process, the DNA sample is <b>denatured</b> into the separate individual polynucleotide strands through heating. Two oligonucleotide DNA primers are used to hybridize to two corresponding nearby sites on opposite DNA strands in such a fashion that the normal enzymatic extension of the active terminal of each primer (that is, the 3’ end) leads toward the other primer. PCR uses replication enzymes that are tolerant of high temperatures, such as the thermostable Taq polymerase. In this fashion, two new copies of the sequence of interest are generated. Repeated denaturation, hybridization, and extension in this fashion produce an exponentially growing number of copies of the DNA of interest. Instruments that perform thermal cycling are readily available from commercial sources. This process can produce a million-fold or greater amplification of the desired region in 2 hours or less.|$|E
25|$|To {{create a}} western blot, gel {{electrophoresis}} {{is used to}} separate native proteins by 3-D structure or <b>denatured</b> proteins by {{the length of the}} polypeptide. Polyacrylamide gel is generally used for the electrophoretic separation of proteins, and SDS is generally used as a buffer (as well as in the gel) in order to give all proteins present a uniform negative charge, since proteins can be positively, negatively, or neutrally charged. This type of electrophoresis is known as SDS-PAGE (SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). Prior to electrophoresis, protein samples are often boiled to denature the proteins present. This ensures that proteins are separated based on size and prevents proteases (enzymes that break down proteins) from degrading samples. Following electrophoretic separation, the proteins are transferred to a membrane (typically nitrocellulose or PVDF), where they are blocked with milk (or other blocking agents) to prevent non-specific antibody binding, and then stained with antibodies specific to the target protein. Lastly, the membrane will be stained with a secondary antibody that recognizes the first antibody staining, which can then be used for detection by a variety of methods. The gel electrophoresis step is included in western blot analysis to resolve the issue of the cross-reactivity of antibodies.|$|E
25|$|For nucleic acids, urea is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used denaturant. For proteins, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) is an anionic detergent applied to protein samples to coat proteins in order to impart two negative charges (from every SDS molecule) to every two amino acids of the <b>denatured</b> protein. 2-Mercaptoethanol may also be used to disrupt the disulfide bonds found between the protein complexes, which helps further denature the protein. In most proteins, the binding of SDS to the polypeptide chain imparts an even distribution of charge per unit mass, thereby resulting in a fractionation by approximate size during electrophoresis. Proteins that have a greater hydrophobic content – for instance, many membrane proteins, and those that interact with surfactants in their native environment – are intrinsically harder to treat accurately using this method, due to the greater variability in the ratio of bound SDS. Procedurally, using both Native and SDS-PAGE together can be used to purify and to separate the various subunits of the protein. Native-PAGE keeps the oligomeric form intact and will show a band on the gel that is representative of the level of activity. SDS-PAGE will denature and separate the oligomeric form into its monomers, showing bands that are representative of their molecular weights. These bands can be used to assess the purity of and identify the protein.|$|E
25|$|HbS {{has a lower}} {{negative}} charge at physiological pH than does normal adult hemoglobin. The consequences of the simple replacement of a charged amino acid with a hydrophobic, neutral amino acid are far ranging, Recent studies in West Africa suggest that the greatest impact of Hb S {{seems to be to}} protect against either death or severe disease—that is, profound anemia or cerebral malaria—while having less effect on infection per se. Children who are heterozygous for the sickle cell gene have only one- tenth the risk of death from falciparum as do those who are homozygous for the normal hemoglobin gene. Binding of parasitized sickle erythrocytes to endothelial cells and blood monocytes is significantly reduced due to an altered display of Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP-1), the parasite’s major cytoadherence ligand and virulence factor on the erythrocyte surface. Protection also derives from the instability of sickle hemoglobin, which clusters the predominant integral red cell membrane protein (called band 3) and triggers accelerated removal by phagocytic cells. Natural antibodies recognize these clusters on senescent erythrocytes. Protection by HbAS involves the enhancement of not only innate but also of acquired immunity to the parasite. Prematurely <b>denatured</b> sickle hemoglobin results in an up regulation of natural antibodies which control erythrocyte adhesion in both malaria and sickle cell disease. Targeting the stimuli that lead to endothelial activation will constitute a promising therapeutic strategy to inhibit sickle red cell adhesion and vasco-occlusion.|$|E
500|$|The {{lability}} of the cyclol bond {{was seen}} as an advantage of the model, since it provided a natural explanation for the properties of denaturation; reversion of cyclol bonds to their more stable amide form would open up the structure and allows those bonds to be attacked by proteases, consistent with experiment. [...] Early studies showed that proteins <b>denatured</b> by pressure are often in a different state than the same proteins <b>denatured</b> by high temperature, which was interpreted as possibly supporting the cyclol model of denaturation.|$|E
