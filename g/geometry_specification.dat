40|$|The {{specification}} of locational attributes in hedonic houseprice models {{has traditionally been}} problematic. Whilst many studies use similar sets of structural attributes the range of locational attributes can be diverse and inconsistent both in their identification and in their measurement. To address this problem, researchers have adopted concepts related to urban configuration such as the monocentric city and the access – space trade-off model, and later multicentric and multiple accessibility models, to structure their enquiry. This has led to issues related to a priori variable specification using geometrically defined accessibility measures that {{can also lead to}} problems such as spatial autocorrelation. In this research, we investigate the use of network accessibility metrics in hedonic house price research using Cardiff, Wales as a case study. We hypothesize that a network-modelling approach to measuring accessibility will improve performance compared with conventional planar <b>geometry</b> <b>specifications.</b> We find that estimating centrality variables across a variety of spatial scales allows the impact on property prices of urban configurations to be modelled more accurately.

40|$|This thesis {{introduces}} {{the design and}} analysis of a new hybrid hysteresis motor with combined axial and radial flux rotors aiming to improve the poor performance characteristics of the conventional hysteresis motors such as the output torque and efficiency. The proposed hybrid design incorporates the advantageous features of both the conventional axial and radial flux hysteresis motors in a unique structure. The design aspects and constraints of the proposed machine {{are based on a}} sample single-sided axial flux hysteresis motor. In order to analyze the electromagnetic performance of the proposed structure and investigate the <b>geometry</b> <b>specifications</b> of the designed machine, a 3 -D Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is conducted. The hysteresis loop modeling is done based on the elliptical approximation of the hysteresis loop by considering the saturation during the FEA with an iterative method. Also, two analytical models are proposed to analyze the performance of the new hybrid hysteresis motor. At the first method, in order to analyze the electromagnetic performance of the proposed machine and investigate the <b>geometry</b> <b>specifications</b> of the designed machine, the structure is divided into two axial and radial planes and the Laplace's equation are solved in 2 -D Cartesian and cylindrical coordinates for the field in the air-gap, the stator and the rotor disc subject to appropriate boundary conditions. The field equation is modified by the hyperbolic approximation of the hysteresis loop to investigate the effects of the minor loops described by the harmonic components of the field and then, the impact of the Magneto Motive Force (MMF) harmonics on the machine performance is estimated by an iterative approach. Afterward, the closed-form expressions for the developed torque are obtained in both planes and the results are stacked-up linearly by considering the basic of the superposition theorem. At the second method, the analysis of an axial flux hysteresis motor is investigated based on the parallelogram approximation of the hysteresis loop. This model is widely used in the analysis of the conventional hysteresis motor when the magnetic equivalent circuit method is employed. Because of the lack of analysis for the slotted stator, the magnetic analysis of a sample single-sided type is presented and the results of the analysis are extended to the hybrid structure. Then the yielded results are compared with the tests on a prototype. In this study, the effect of stator slotting, slot opening, and parasitic loss on the machine performance are investigated. Also, the sensitivity analysis of the magnetic and geometric parameters of the machine is evaluated. Finally, in order to investigate the electromagnetic performance of the proposed device and the accuracy of the design and analysis approach, a prototype is built. The test results validate the good performance of the proposed machin...|$|R
40|$|A poloidal tilting {{symmetry}} {{of the local}} nonlinear δ f gyrokinetic model is demonstrated analytically and verified numerically. This symmetry shows that poloidally rotating all the flux surface shaping effects with large poloidal mode number by a single tilt angle has an exponentially small effect on the transport properties of a tokamak. This is shown using a generalization of the Miller local equilibrium model to specify an arbitrary flux surface geometry. With this <b>geometry</b> <b>specification</b> we find that, when performing an expansion in large flux surface shaping mode number, the governing equations of gyrokinetics are symmetric in the poloidal tilt of the high order shaping effects. This allows us to take the fluxes from a single configuration and calculate the fluxes in any configuration that can be produced by tilting the large mode number shaping effects. This creates a distinction between tokamaks with mirror symmetric flux surfaces and tokamaks without mirror symmetry, {{which is expected to}} have important consequences for generating toroidal rotation using up-down asymmetry.
