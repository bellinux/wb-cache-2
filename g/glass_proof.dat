40|$|In this work, the {{feasibility}} of a light force accelerometer was experimentally demonstrated. The light force accelerometer is an optical inertial sensor which uses focused laser light to levitate and trap <b>glass</b> microspheres as <b>proof</b> masses. Acceleration is measured by force rebalancing, which is exerted by radiation pressure from two counter-propagating laser beams. Proof mass displacements are measured by focusing light scattered by the proof mass on a position-sensitive photodetector. A simple model including laser relative intensity noise and shot noise from the measurement of the trapping beam powers estimates that the light force accelerometer could be capable of achieving a sensitivity of < 100 ng/Hz 1 / 2. Essential components of this optical accelerometer, including the levitation of 10 pm glass microspheres in high vacuum and optical force rebalancing, were demonstrated with a single laser beam levitating a microsphere against gravity. Levitated particles are unstable in vacuum because of low viscous forces, so feedback stabilization is necessary for long term trapping. Preliminary performance diagnostics tested the short term sensitivity and bias stability of the apparatus for a constant 1 g acceleration. The factors currently limiting these performance parameters were determined to be bias instabilities associated with measurement of proof mass position and long term biases due to pressure-dependent radiometric effects. Proposed modifications to the current apparatus include {{the implementation of a}} two-beam light force accelerometer and a more precise particle position detection method which is less sensitive to proof mass irregularities. This two-beam configuration enables operation in any orientation and permits complete characterization of accelerometer performance. Steps to develop a compact light force sensor in the future are also suggested. by David LaGrange Butts. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Thermite {{reactions}} were well {{studied in the}} past few decades; however, implementation of these reactions with nanoscale components is a new interest for today’s researchers both for military and civil industries. Nanothermites are mixtures of a metal fuel and a metal oxide, undergoing a redox reaction while heated, and generating a large amount of energy (heat/thrust) which can reach combustion temperatures above 3000 K. Aluminum is commonly used as the fuel because of its abundance, easy handling, high reactivity and benign products. By using nano-sized components, the surface energy, contact area, and mixing homogeneity increase. These properties result in greatly improved reactivity and propagation rate as well as easier ignition compared to traditional thermites, which make them attractive as advanced propellants, pyrotechnics, and heat and thrust generators. They also find civil applications such as joining. Here, the application of nanothermites for joining metal to ceramic/glass is investigated. To approach this goal, composites of nanothermite modified by Copper powder were developed {{for the first time and}} their related properties were studied to find the best composition for joining. These energetic composites can be applied where a localized heat source is required. The advantage of using nanothermite for joining is its fast reaction, high energy density and liquid products that can wet surfaces. In this research, the reaction products were studied by X-Ray Diffraction spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy and Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The overall thermite reaction corresponding to the Al-NiO nanothermite was found producing the AlNi phase in a fuel-rich mixture. The microstructures of these reaction products showed the formation of a composite made from copper, AlNi and AlNi/Al 2 O 3 spheres in an Al 2 O 3 matrix. On the other hand, the influences of the fuel (Al) to oxidizer (NiO or CuO) mass ratio and the amount of Cu additive, on the ignition temperature and energy release were characterized using Differential Scanning Calorimetry. It was found that both parameters do not affect the ignition temperature significantly but change the energy release dramatically. Furthermore, according to these results, (Al- 33 %NiO) - 50 %Cu was selected and applied to join dissimilar materials such as copper, alumina-silica and <b>glass.</b> As a <b>proof</b> of concept, joint cross-sections were studied by SEM-EDAX revealing that the alumina phase produced by this reaction was joined to the glass/ceramic, while the metal phase wetted the metallic surfaces. Therefore, this composite was introduced as a good interlayer for dissimilar metal/ceramic surfaces. 1 yea...|$|R
40|$|The fiber {{manufacturing}} {{has traditionally}} had three different process phases: Preform Manufacturing, Fiber Draw and Proof Testing. This thesis focuses on combining draw process and proof testing, which requires catching the fiber end after break at full production speed without disturbing the draw process. Proof testing means applying a specified tensile load to continuous lengths of optical fiber. The tensile load is applied for as short time as possible, yet sufficiently long {{to ensure the}} <b>glass</b> experiences the <b>proof</b> stress. The proof test cycle {{is divided into three}} steps: load, dwell and unload. Nowadays the industry commonly accepts that the dwell time has minor effect on the final minimum strength of fiber, but the strength decreases during the proof testing cycle. The unload time {{is considered to be a}} machine property by capstan design, but new approach is suggested in this thesis, where the unload time is a material property. The two-region crack growth theory states that depending on the unload rate the crack growth may happen in two region. The effect of the coating was also studied. It was found that at high load rates the coating carries a substantially higher part of the load. Additionally theories suggest that the strength of the fiber is significantly higher just after draw than approx. 1 hour later, because of water penetration. An approach for modeling tension behavior in combined draw and proof testing process mathematically was introduced and a universal simulating tool was generated. Experiments were carried out to verify the theory. The first was the draw tension experiment. The second part was the comparison of the conventional proof tension measurement and the new method needed for the combined processes. After this the effect of the different process elements were evaluated. Two different methods to survive proof testing break were introduced and tested. A combination of tubes and belts turned to be the most reliable. Since the winding quality is important, a new winding algorithm was developed. Several trials focused on preventing whipping phenomenon. An optimal whipping guard and auxiliary blade minimized the whipping. The transfer reliability was tested with a separate take-up module. The result was that the transfer reliability is at satisfactory level at the existing production speeds. The future work will include more experimental testing, which will combine the critical components into one machine. The overall reliability depends on how well these critical components are integrated to each other. reviewe...|$|R
40|$|This project {{focused on}} {{advancing}} radio-frequency (RF) lamination technology closer to commercial implementation, {{in order to}} reduce the energy intensity of glass lamination by up to 90 %. Lamination comprises a wide range of products including autoglass, architectural safety and innovative design glass, transparent armor (e. g. bullet <b>proof</b> <b>glass),</b> smart glass, mirrors, and encapsulation of photovoltaics. Lamination is also the fastest growing segment of glass manufacturing, with photovoltaics, architectural needs, and an anticipated transition to laminated side windows in vehicles. The state-of-the-art for glass lamination is to use autoclaves, which apply heat and uniform gas pressure to bond the laminates over the course of 1 to 18 hours. Laminates consist of layers of glass or other materials bonded with vinyl or urethane interlayers. In autoclaving, significant heat energy is lost heating the chamber, pressurized air, glass racks, and the glass. In RF lamination, the heat is generated directly in the vinyl interlayer, causing it to heat and melt quickly, in just 1 to 10 minutes, without significantly heating the glass or the equipment. The main purpose of this project was to provide evidence that low energy, rapid RF lamination quality met the same standards as conventionally autoclaved windows. The development of concepts for laminating curved glass with RF lamination was a major goal. Other primary goals included developing a stronger understanding of the lamination product markets described above, and to refine the potential benefits of commercial implementation. The scope of the project was to complete implementation concept studies in preparation for continuation into advanced development, pilot studies, and commercial implementation. The project consisted of 6 main tasks. The first dealt with lamination with poly-vinyl butyral (PVB) interlayers, which prior work had shown difficulties in achieving good quality laminates, working with Pilkington North America. The second task dealt with a study of current lamination processes in the various laminate industries, and development of concepts for integrating RF lamination into new or existing processes. The third task explored the use of a non-destructive technique for analyzing laminate adhesion with the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The fourth task focused on developing concepts for curved glass lamination using RF lamination. The fifth and sixth tasks together comprised an analysis of laminate product markets, ranking for applicability and commercialization potential, and the development of commercialization strategies for those products. In addition, throughout the project as new experimental data and conventional process data were obtained, the benefits analysis of RF lamination was refined. The goals of the project described above were achieved, positioning RF lamination for the next stage growth envisioned in the original Industrial Grand Challenge proposal. Working with Pilkington North America, lamination of flat autoglass with PVB was achieved, meeting all 16 stringent industry tests. In particular, PVB laminates made with RF lamination passed environmental tests including the high temperature, 120 ÃÂÃÂ°C bake test, without significant formation of bubbles (defects). The adhesion of PVB to glass was measured using the pummel method. Adhesion values ranging from 1 to 7 out of 10 were obtained. The significant process parameters affecting the environmental and adhesion performance were identified through a designed experiment. Pre-lamination process variables including PVB storage humidity and the de-airing process (vacuum or nip rolling) were significant, as well as the level of pressure applied to the laminate during the RF process. Analysis of manufacturing with RF lamination equipment, based on the processes developed indicated that 3 RF presses could replace a typical auto-industry autoclave to achieve equal or greater throughput with possibly less capital cost and smaller footprint. Concepts for curved lamination identifying castable molds for prototyping were developed, which allowed Ceralink to obtain commitment to begin curved tooling development. The project significantly helped to advance RF lamination past the feasibility and novelty stage and into the realm of commercial acceptance as a viable alternative to autoclaves. The demonstration of autoclave-quality autoglass produced in just 1 minute with RF lamination, with validation by Pilkington, has fueled industry motivation to seriously consider RF lamination. The industry and other contacts and outreach made in the study of laminate markets (including 3 technical publications and 5 conference presentations), has resulted in a recent surge in RF lamination activity...|$|R
