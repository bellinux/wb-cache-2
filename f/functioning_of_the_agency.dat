5000|$|The Economic Division was a {{critical}} one for the NLRB. Cause-and-effect {{was one of the}} fundamental assumptions of the National Labor Relations Act, and for the causes of labor unrest to be understood economic analysis was needed. From the start, the Economic Division undertook three important tasks: 1) Gather economic data in support of cases before the courts; 2) Conduct general studies of labor relations to guide the board in formulating decisions and policies; and 3) Research the history of labor relations (the history of written agreements, whether certain issues were historically part of collective bargaining, how unions functioned internally, trends in employer activities, trends in collective bargaining, whether certain employer actions led to labor disputes, etc.) so that the board could educate itself, the courts, Congress, and the public about labor relations. The first function proved critical to the survival of the NLRB. It was the Economic Division's data and analysis, more than then NLRB's legal reasoning, which proved critical in persuading the Supreme Court to sustain the Wagner Act in NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel. The Court even cited several Economic Division studies in its decision. In the wake of Jones & Laughlin Steel, many labor relations experts outside the agency concluded that economic analysis was [...] "an accepted fact" [...] essential to the proper <b>functioning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>agency.</b> The Economic Division did, too. It asked Madden to pair an economist with an attorney in every important case, and prepared outline of the economic data needed to support each case in case it went before the courts.|$|E

Difficulties in acquiring the signed consent of all the relevant nations, and guaranteeing satisfactory compliance with the terms of such an agreement are noted. Additional problems to be solved comprise {{the construction of the}} ground based facilities and the satellites, the funding for the venture, and the reconciliation of the functions of the proposed agency with the sovereignty of individual states. The agency would gather, treat, and format data for signatories of arms control agreements and provide technical assistance in crisis conditions.

40|$|Stress {{and burnout}} have {{received}} {{a great deal of}} attention in the child welfare field. This has been due to such issues as the high workload, the complexity of the cases, working with resistant and at times violent clients and the negative work environment of the youth protection agency. These factors have a detrimental effect on the worker's personal and professional resources and undermine the healthy <b>functioning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>agency,</b> all of which ultimately affects best practice with clients. One way in which child welfare organizations could make an effort towards reclaiming clinical practice is to engage in training for its workforce. Training can benefit practitioners by improving their skills and knowledge and this can lead to greater job satisfaction. Agency functioning is improved by having a trained workforce as well as social workers who are knowledgeable regarding agency policies, values and models of intervention. Children and families ultimately benefit by working with practitioners who are equipped with the appropriate skills. These benefits for workers, clients and the agency cannot materialize unless barriers are removed and changes within the agency take place in order to support the effective transfer of knowledge and training...|$|E

40|$|The agency {{model has}} always been the most popular mode of selling insurance. The agency concept {{involves}} the recruitment of retired persons, housewives, self employed individuals or even students. The life insurance company provides professional training and gets them to target their acquaintances, friends and relatives and sell life insurance products. This strategy {{has always been}} used by life insurance companies {{because of the fact that}} in India, life insurance is still sold and not bought. The <b>functioning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> model is always the biggest challenge to an insurance company since this group of people leaves the company without hesitation. Agents have by far been the most disloyal to the company especially in the case of private companies. In the recent past Bankassurance has gained a lot of popularity where in a person is forced to buy an insurance policy when he approaches the bank for a loan. However the success of a life insurance company is directly dependent on the training and development and maintaining of its agents. Insurance companies now have both individual and corporate agents selling policies on their behalf. India’s private life insurance companies had examined the well-entrenched LIC’s model of tied agents in detail and found it easy to replicate. They tweaked the overall branch-led operating model but retained the basic structure of brick and mortar branches and agency managers (or development officer in LIC parlance) on their payrolls i. e., the agency manager was an employee on fixed costs with some variable component. This made the agency in times where it is important to conserve capital and allocate capital to resources that will deliver sustainable returns; no insurer can remain rigid in their distribution or operating model. This study evaluates the performance of private and public sector agents and analyses the need for insurance companies to move to other models for marketing life insurance...|$|E

Dramatic recent increases in youth crime and delinquency have stimulated numerous programmatic efforts by units of government to devise techniques for the control or diminution of those phenomena. Youth services bureaus are one of the kinds of organizations that were created under the provisions of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to combat juvenile delinquency. They are community-based agencies whose purpose [...] treatment of delinquents [...] as an alternative to involvement in the juvenile justice system is in accord with the so-called "medical model. " The youth services bureau model has as a goal the identification of the needs of youths who are involved in anti-social activities and the utilization of community resources in the service of rehabilitation for such youths. In order to accomplish that goal youth services bureaus might utilize the help of existing youth-serving agencies, or, where needed services are not available, the bureaus might provide them. This field study was concerned with the initiation, the growth and the development of Omni-House, a youth services bureau that is located in Wheeling, Illinois. That organization provides services for six communities in the north-west suburban area of Chicago. The conceptual framework that was developed for this case study consisted of a cubistic model that was based upon the literature of sociology, political science and systems analysis. Using the five subsystems of an organizational systems model, and analysis of each of the stages of organizational growth was completed. Five subsystems, interacting with two measures of the investment of energy within the organization, yielded a matrix for each of three stages of organizational growth and development. The measures of energy expended by the organization included the amount in dollars allocated to each subsystem and the number of staff-day equivalents allocated to each subsystem. Those ten characteristics of organizational growth and development (i. e., five organizational subsystems, two specifications of the internal allocation of organizational energy, and three stages of growth) were combined into a cubistic model for use in this field study research in the description of the growth and development of Omni-House: Youth Services Bureau. The three growth stages include an initiation stage, an operational stage and an organizational maturity stage. The five subsystems are as follows: a production subsystem which produces the services that are the reason for the existence of the agency; the boundary-spanning subsystem, which described activities that are performed within the boundaries of the organization but which serve to link it with the outside world; the maintenance subsystem, which consists of organizational activities which attempt to smooth out the operation of the other subsystems and to conduct the support functions for agency operations; the managerial subsystem, which includes the use of authority to control, to coordinate and to direct the activities of the organization; and the adaptive subsystem, which monitors the environment with regard to the <b>functioning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> and provides information for the agency with regard to the need for changes. Eight conclusions were reported, based upon the study of Omni-House. In addition, a number of statements of additional research questions were presented in connection with six of the conclusions. Several suggestions were also made for the modification of the cubistic model. Those suggestions included the following: that an additional subsystem, concerned with the activities of the agency's board of directors, be added; that the name of the production subsystem be changed for studies of organizations of this type to services subsystem; that two additional stages of growth and development (a stage of dissonance, and a stage of decline and disorganization) be added...|$|E
