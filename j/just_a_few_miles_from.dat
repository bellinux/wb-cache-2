5|$|To {{fill the}} void left by {{the demise of the}} Susquehannocks, the Iroquois {{encouraged}} displaced tribes from the east to settle in the West Branch watershed, including the Shawnee and Lenape (or Delaware). The valleys of Pine Creek and its tributaries in Cummings Township were used by the Iroquois and Algonkian tribes as a hunting ground. Historians believe {{that there may have been}} a Shawnee village and burial ground just to the north of Little Pine State Park on Little Pine Creek, <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>miles</b> <b>from</b> what became Upper Pine Bottom State Park.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{spirited}} {{resistance from}} the largest British merchant ship, Windham, {{the failure of the}} other Indiamen to support their leader and the size and power of the French ships forced the British to withdraw: all the HEIC ships were subsequently captured by the larger, faster French warships. A month later, Hamelin's raiding campaign skirted disaster when a winter hurricane on the voyage back to Île de France almost wrecked his flagship Vénus. Vénus only survived with the co-operation of the British prisoners aboard, who brought the ship safely to port. Only two of the captured Indiamen were successfully brought to Ile de France: the same storm that nearly destroyed Vénus scattered the squadron and its prizes, allowing a patrolling British frigate to recapture Windham <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>miles</b> <b>from</b> the French island.|$|E
5|$|The delay {{caused by}} the pursuit of Bompart by the frigates under George Countess allowed the British to {{dispatch}} a more substantial squadron under Warren to the Donegal coast. Thus when Bompart arrived {{in the lee of}} Tory Island, he soon found himself threatened on all sides by a superior British force. Despite the damage his ships had suffered in the heavy weather conditions, Bompart attempted to escape but was swiftly run down and defeated in battle, his flagship and four frigates being captured and towed into Lough Swilly. Among the prisoners seized on board the flagship was Theobald Wolfe Tone, leader of the United Irishmen, whose capture and subsequent death signified the end of the rebellion. Over the next week, the scattered French survivors desperately attempted to reach the safety of French harbours {{in the face of a}} dozens of British warships cruising along their homeward route. Only three made it, three others being hunted down and captured, one <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>miles</b> <b>from</b> the entrance to Brest. The French never again attempted an invasion of Ireland.|$|E

25|$|Staying in Palestine until August 1945, Koestler {{collected}} {{material for}} his next novel, Thieves in the Night. When he returned to England Mamaine Paget, whom he had started to see before going out to Palestine, was waiting for him. In 1945 August the couple moved to the cottage of Bwlch Ocyn, a secluded farmhouse that belonged to Clough Williams-Ellis, in the Vale of Ffestiniog. Over {{the next three years}} Koestler would become a close friend of George Orwell. The region had its own intellectual circle, which would have been sympathetic to Koestler: Williams-Ellis' wife, Amabel, a niece of Lytton Strachey was also a former communist; other associates included Rupert Crawshay-Williams, Michael Polanyi, Storm Jameson and, most significantly, Bertrand Russell, who lived <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>miles</b> <b>from</b> the Koestler cottage.|$|E

Meigs' unit fell back on Fairfax, Virginia. Without orders to do so, John left the unit and returned to the capital. He reached his parents' home at about 8 A.M., and let them know he was uninjured. He said he left Company M to report to Lieutenant General Winfield Scott, commander-in-chief of all Union armed forces. Although John wished to return to his unit, his father ordered him to depart for West Point after reporting to General Scott.|$|E
25|$|McLain's oldest daughter, Kristin, 26, {{was killed}} on March 20, 1992, in a car {{accident}} caused by a drunk driver. She had been living in Florida and was moving back home to Michigan when she was killed <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>miles</b> <b>from</b> her parents' home. In part to escape his grief, McLain and several partners bought the Peet Packing Company (Farmer Peet's) located {{in the small town of}} Chesaning, Michigan in 1994. McLain was also a partner in the Michigan Radio Network. Both companies went bankrupt two years later. In 1996, he was convicted on charges of embezzlement, mail fraud, and conspiracy in connection with the theft of $2.5 million from the Peet employees' pension fund. McLain spent six years in prison; to this day, he insists he knew nothing about the shady financial deals alleged by the government. McLain claims he paid restitution for this incident.|$|E
25|$|Originally {{intending}} {{to rejoin the}} Eighth Army in Italy, the 5th Division, after landing there briefly in February, was instead diverted to Northwestern Europe to reinforce the British Second Army, commanded by Lieutenant General Sir Miles Dempsey, for the final Allied offensive on the Western Front, the invasion of Germany itself. The Second Army formed part of Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery's 21st Army Group. The division arrived in Belgium in early March, and on 17 April was assigned to Lieutenant General Evelyn Barker's VIII Corps, then <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>miles</b> <b>from</b> the western bank of the Elbe river. The division crossed the river after facing light resistance and {{was not involved in}} much fighting thereafter and managed to enter the city of Lübeck in Northern Germany on 3 May, just {{a few days before the}} end of World War II in Europe. Having been promoted to the substantive rank of major on 7 May 1945, Hull was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 5 July 1945.|$|E

500|$|Brett {{therefore}} sent {{four of the}} 19th Bombardment Group's old planes. Two {{were forced}} to turn back with engine trouble. One of the others accidentally dumped [...] of its fuel. The pilot flew on, and nearly made it to Del Monte Field, but, <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>miles</b> <b>from</b> his destination, the fuel tanks ran dry and the engines stopped. The B-17 crash landed in the sea. Two of the crew were killed, but the rest made it to shore, and thence to Del Monte Field. Only one B-17, piloted by Lieutenant Harl Pease, reached Del Monte, and this B-17 was in poor condition, with no brakes and a faulty supercharger. Sharp ordered it back to Australia before MacArthur arrived. Despite the lack of brakes, Pease made the return trip, carrying sixteen passengers.|$|E
