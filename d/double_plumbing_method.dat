Given a closed smooth 4 -manifold $X$ and a suitable pair of classes in $H_{ 2 }(X) $, we investigate when this pair of classes may be represented by a configuration of surfaces in $X$ whose regular neighbourhood is a <b>double</b> <b>plumbing</b> of disk bundles over spheres. Using similar methods we study single plumbings of two disk bundles over spheres inside $X$. Comment: 40 pages, 9 figure...|$|R
50|$|Maddock {{improved}} the old fashion {{early nineteenth century}} <b>plumbing</b> <b>method</b> of connecting lead pipe to a toilet by inventing a brass coupling replacement. His 1880 invention allowed the plumbing to be directly connected to the earthenware china toilet. The old school method involved a porcelain horn extending from the flushing rim connecting to the sewer lead pipe and the whole contraption held together by strips of muslin and putty. His invention made a direct solid connection and was the state-of-the-art technology {{that went into the}} twentieth century.|$|R

Once the distortion has been corrected by a <b>plumb</b> line <b>method,</b> the camera is ensured to transform, up to the distortion precision, 3 D straight lines into 2 D straight lines, and therefore becomes a pinhole camera. This paper introduces a <b>plumb</b> line <b>method</b> for correcting and evaluating camera {{lens distortion}} with high precision. The evaluation criterion {{is defined as the}} average standard deviation from straightness of a set of approximately equally spaced straight strings photographed uniformly in all directions by the camera, so that their image crosses the whole camera field. The method uses an easily built "calibration harp," namely a frame on which good quality strings have been tightly stretched to ensure a very high physical straightness. Real experiments confirm that our method produces high precision corrections (less than 0. 05 pixel), approximating the distortion with a large number of degrees of freedom given by polynomial model of order eleven...|$|R

A theory to accomplish this is developed along with practical method for calibrating radial and decentering distortion of close-range cameras.

40|$|Tests were {{conducted}} to investigate possibilities of electroforming low-stress nickel microwave <b>plumbing.</b> Two <b>methods</b> were studied: use of saccharin as an addition agent in a standard Watts bath, and superimposition of alternating current on direct current. Saccharin reduces stress in nickel deposited from the Watts bath; however, it is un-stable, provides erratic results, and is difficult to control. Superimposing alternating current on direct current reduces tress considerably in nickel deposited from the Watts bath. Results verify and extend findings of previous investigations showing that stresses as low as 2, 000 psi {{can be obtained by}} superimposing 60 -cycle alternating current on direct current in Watts bath...|$|R

5000|$|After {{data has}} been {{physically}} overwritten {{on a hard}} disk drive, it is generally assumed that the previous data are {{no longer possible to}} recover. In 1996, Peter Gutmann, a computer scientist, presented a paper that suggested overwritten data could be recovered through the use of magnetic force microscope. In 2001, he presented another paper on a similar topic. [...] To guard against this type of data recovery, Gutmann and Colin <b>Plumb</b> designed a <b>method</b> of irreversibly scrubbing data, known as the Gutmann method and used by several disk-scrubbing software packages.|$|R
40|$|The {{ongoing process}} of {{industrialization}} of construction sites encourages {{the use of}} new building systems that conflict with traditional techniques associated with the risks of incompatibilities and continuance of control fixed ideas with a significant variability. A practical example is the cement mortar for plastering, commonly used as a corrective factor for facade flatness failures caused by the inaccuracy of the <b>plumb</b> line, rudimentary <b>method</b> used in geometric control of concrete structures and facade of mapping during {{the execution of the}} work, favoring the accumulation of errors that reflect the mortar thickness, increasing consumption, losses and defects. Alternatively for improvement, this study analyzed through a case study, the innovative application of 3 D laser scanning technology consolidated on the facade of a building to map the surface flatness of the façade and, in an unprecedented manner, to quantify the volume of mortar. The results showed the feasibility of the technique as a solution to accurately identify the critical areas of the facade on the peripheral concrete structure and masonry and calculate, based on the volumes, the financial impact associated with mortar overthicknesses in critical areas compared with the reductions thickness after treatment of these areas...|$|R
40|$|The {{configuration}} of subvolcanic magma storage regions exercises a fundamental control on eruptive style and hazard. Such regions can be imaged remotely, using seismic, geodetic, or magnetotelluric methods, although these {{are far from}} routine and rarely unambiguous. The textures of erupted volcanic rocks, as quantified through crystal size distributions (CSD), provide space- and time-integrated information on subvolcanic plumbing systems, although these data cannot be used readily for reconstruction of key parameters such as conduit geometry or magma chamber depth. Here we develop a numerical approach to interpretation of CSD in products of steady eruptions, based on crystallization kinetics and hydrodynamic flow simulation, to image subvolcanic <b>plumbing</b> systems. The <b>method</b> requires knowledge of magma properties, crystal growth kinetics (measured experimentally), and discharge rate (measured observationally). The method is applicable to steady-state eruptive regimes. Distributions of pressure, temperature, crystal content, and conduit cross-section area with depth are obtained from a CSD from a sample erupted from Mount St. Helens volcano, USA. Values of average conduit diameter (∼ 30 m) and magma chamber depth (∼ 14 km below the summit) are in good agreement with independent estimates...|$|R
40|$|The {{classical}} calibration {{or space}} resection {{is the fundamental}} task in photogrammetry. The lack of sufficient knowledge of interior and exterior orientation parameters lead to unreliable results in the photogrammetric process. One of the earliest in approaches using in photogrammetry was the <b>plumb</b> line calibration <b>method.</b> This method is suitable to recover the radial and decentering lens distortion coefficients, while the remaining interior(focal length and principal point coordinates) and exterior orientation parameters have {{to be determined by}} a complimentary method. As the lens distortion remains very less it not considered as the interior orientation parameters, in the present rigorous sensor model. There are several other available methods based on the photogrammetric collinearity equations, which consider the determination of exterior orientation parameters, with no mention to the simultaneous determination of inner orientation parameters. Normal space resection methods solve the problem using control points, whose coordinates are known both in image and object reference systems. The non-linearity of the model and the problems, in point location in digital images and identifying the maximum GPS measured control points are the main drawbacks of the classical approaches. This paper addresses mathematical model based on the fundamental assumption of collineariy of three points of two Along-Track Stereo imagery sensors and independent object point. Assuming this condition it is possible to extract the exterior orientation (EO) parameters for a long strip and single image together, without and with using the control points. Moreover, after extracting the EO parameters the accuracy for satellite data products are compared in with using single and with no control points. ...|$|R
