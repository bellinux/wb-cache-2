5|$|<b>Dynamic</b> DNA {{nanotechnology}} {{focuses on}} forming nucleic acid systems with designed <b>dynamic</b> functionalities {{related to their}} overall structures, such as computation and mechanical motion. There is some overlap between structural and <b>dynamic</b> DNA nanotechnology, as structures can be formed through annealing and then reconfigured dynamically, or {{can be made to}} form dynamically in the first place.|$|E
5|$|On {{compatible}} systems, the Microsoft Windows version uses nVidia's PhysX software {{engine to}} produce realistic, <b>dynamic</b> {{interactions with the}} game world. With PhysX enabled, some areas contain smoke or fog which reacts to Batman moving through it, while with PhysX disabled the fog will not appear at all. Other effects include <b>dynamic</b> interaction with paper and leaves, surfaces which can be scratched and chipped, and <b>dynamic,</b> destructible cloth elements such as banners and cobwebs. The Game of the Year version features the ability {{to play the game}} in 3D on any 2D television using anaglyph 3D glasses.|$|E
5|$|Python uses <b>dynamic</b> typing and {{a mix of}} {{reference}} counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management. An important feature of Python is <b>dynamic</b> name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution.|$|E
25|$|Structural dynamics, therefore, {{is a type}} of {{structural}} analysis which covers the behavior of structures subjected to <b>dynamic</b> (actions having high acceleration) loading. <b>Dynamic</b> loads include people, wind, waves, traffic, earthquakes, and blasts. Any structure can be subjected to <b>dynamic</b> loading. <b>Dynamic</b> analysis can be used to find <b>dynamic</b> displacements, time history, and modal analysis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dynamic</b> Attractions was {{a sister}} company to <b>Dynamic</b> Structures {{that was created}} in 2011 to serve the primary {{function}} of soliciting sales for rides systems that would be manufactured by <b>Dynamic</b> Structures.|$|E
25|$|Today, most LCD screens {{are being}} {{designed}} with an LED backlight {{instead of the}} traditional CCFL backlight, while that backlight is dynamically controlled with the video information (<b>dynamic</b> backlight control). The combination with the <b>dynamic</b> backlight control, invented by Philips researchers Douglas Stanton, Martinus Stroomer and Adrianus de Vaan, simultaneously increases the <b>dynamic</b> range of the display system (also marketed as HDR, high <b>dynamic</b> range television.|$|E
25|$|The <b>dynamic</b> viscosities of liquids are {{typically}} several {{orders of magnitude}} higher than <b>dynamic</b> viscosities of gases.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dynamic</b> Structures' history {{dates back}} to 1926, when Vancouver Art Metal was founded. The firm was renamed Coast Steel Fabricators Limited in 1952. In 1976, the firm was {{purchased}} by AGRA Inc., before being renamed AGRA Coast Limited in 1994. AGRA Inc. and its subsidiaries were acquired by British firm AMEC in 2001, with the company changing its name to AMEC <b>Dynamic</b> Structures. In 2007, AMEC sold the company to Empire Industries, who operate it as <b>Dynamic</b> Structures. In 2011, <b>Dynamic</b> Structures' amusement ride manufacturing was spun off into a sister company named <b>Dynamic</b> Attractions.|$|E
25|$|Electrical {{characteristics}} of <b>dynamic</b> loudspeakers may be readily applied to headphones, because most headphones are small <b>dynamic</b> loudspeakers.|$|E
25|$|At about 80 seconds, {{the rocket}} {{experienced}} maximum <b>dynamic</b> pressure (max Q). The <b>dynamic</b> pressure on a rocket varies with air density and {{the square of}} relative velocity. Although velocity continues to increase, air density decreases so quickly with altitude that <b>dynamic</b> pressure falls below max Q.|$|E
25|$|The Lisp family splits {{over the}} use of <b>dynamic</b> or static (a.k.a. lexical) scope. Clojure, Common Lisp and Scheme make use of static scoping by default, while newLISP, Picolisp and the {{embedded}} languages in Emacs and AutoCAD use <b>dynamic</b> scoping. Since version 24.1, Emacs uses both <b>dynamic</b> and lexical scoping.|$|E
25|$|On some CRTs, {{additional}} fixed adjustable magnets {{are added}} for <b>dynamic</b> convergence or <b>dynamic</b> purity at specific {{points on the}} screen, typically near the corners or edges. Further adjustment of <b>dynamic</b> convergence and purity typically cannot be done passively, but requires active compensation circuits.|$|E
25|$|Modern CMOS image sensors {{can often}} capture a high <b>dynamic</b> {{range from a}} single exposure. The wide <b>dynamic</b> range of the {{captured}} image is non-linearly compressed into a smaller <b>dynamic</b> range electronic representation. However, with proper processing, the information from a single exposure {{can be used to}} create an HDR image.|$|E
25|$|Using JavaScript on the Document Object Model (DOM) {{leads to}} the method of <b>Dynamic</b> HTML that allows <b>dynamic</b> {{creation}} and modification of a web page within the browser.|$|E
25|$|When {{a problem}} shows optimal {{substructures}} – meaning the optimal {{solution to a}} problem can be constructed from optimal solutions to subproblems – and overlapping subproblems, meaning the same subproblems are used to solve many different problem instances, a quicker approach called <b>dynamic</b> programming avoids recomputing solutions that have already been computed. For example, Floyd–Warshall algorithm, the shortest path to a goal from a vertex in a weighted graph can be found by using the shortest path to the goal from all adjacent vertices. <b>Dynamic</b> programming and memoization go together. The main difference between <b>dynamic</b> programming and divide and conquer is that subproblems are more or less independent in divide and conquer, whereas subproblems overlap in <b>dynamic</b> programming. The difference between <b>dynamic</b> programming and straightforward recursion is in caching or memoization of recursive calls. When subproblems are independent and there is no repetition, memoization does not help; hence <b>dynamic</b> programming is not a solution for all complex problems. By using memoization or maintaining a table of subproblems already solved, <b>dynamic</b> programming reduces the exponential nature of many problems to polynomial complexity.|$|E

25|$|<b>Dynamic</b> {{pressure}} is the kinetic energy per unit volume of a fluid particle. <b>Dynamic</b> {{pressure is}} in fact one {{of the terms of}} Bernoulli's equation, which can be derived from the conservation of energy for a fluid in motion. In simplified cases, the <b>dynamic</b> pressure is equal to the difference between the stagnation pressure and the static pressure.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dynamic</b> {{function}} stage, where {{motion is}} an underlying idea. The {{idea of a}} function began emerging with Sharaf al-Dīn al-Tūsī, but algebra did not decisively move to the <b>dynamic</b> function stage until Gottfried Leibniz.|$|E
25|$|In computing, DDR4 SDRAM, an {{abbreviation}} for double data rate fourth-generation synchronous <b>dynamic</b> random-access memory, {{is a type}} of synchronous <b>dynamic</b> random-access memory (SDRAM) with a high bandwidth ("double data rate") interface.|$|E
25|$|A <b>dynamic</b> {{analysis}} is {{also related to}} the inertia forces developed by a structure when it is excited by means of <b>dynamic</b> loads applied suddenly (e.g., wind blasts, explosion, earthquake).|$|E
25|$|ASP.NET is an {{open-source}} server-side {{web application}} framework designed for web development to produce <b>dynamic</b> web pages. It {{was developed by}} Microsoft to allow programmers to build <b>dynamic</b> web sites, web applications and web services.|$|E

25|$|Seizing {{an entry}} from a pre-allocated array is faster than using <b>dynamic</b> memory {{allocation}} for each node, since <b>dynamic</b> memory allocation typically requires {{a search for}} a free memory block of the desired size.|$|E
25|$|To {{prevent a}} runaway due to loss of brake pressure, <b>dynamic</b> (rheostatic) braking can be {{utilized}} so the locomotive(s) will assist in retarding the train. Often, blended braking, the simultaneous application of <b>dynamic</b> and train brakes, {{will be used}} to maintain a safe speed and keep the slack bunched on descending grades. Care would then be given when releasing the service and <b>dynamic</b> brakes to prevent draw-gear damage caused by a sudden run out of the train's slack.|$|E
25|$|With the {{introduction}} of the Jetstar 88, the <b>Dynamic</b> 88 models were elevated up the rung for the 1964 model year. <b>Dynamic</b> 88s could be had in four door-sedan and hardtop bodies, two-door hardtop, convertible and station wagon models.|$|E
25|$|The {{drawback}} of the mechanical-electrical {{analogy is}} that electronics {{are limited by}} the range over which the variables may vary. This is called <b>dynamic</b> range. They are also limited by noise levels. Floating-point digital calculations have a comparatively huge <b>dynamic</b> range.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} useful and common {{programming}} language features cannot be checked statically, such as downcasting. Thus, many languages will have both static and <b>dynamic</b> type checking; the static type checker verifies what it can, and <b>dynamic</b> checks verify the rest.|$|E
25|$|A simple {{harmonic}} oscillator 'vibration' {{is only an}} oversimplified <b>dynamic</b> {{representation of}} the longitudinal vibrations of the DNA intertwined helices which {{were found to be}} anharmonic rather than harmonic as often assumed in quantum <b>dynamic</b> simulations of DNA.|$|E
25|$|At this point, we {{have several}} choices, {{one of which is}} to design a <b>dynamic</b> {{programming}} algorithm that will split the problem into overlapping problems and calculate the optimal arrangement of parenthesis. The <b>dynamic</b> programming solution is presented below.|$|E
25|$|Some {{languages}} allow both {{static and}} <b>dynamic</b> typing (type checking), sometimes called soft typing. For example, Java {{and some other}} ostensibly statically typed languages support downcasting types to their subtypes, querying an object to discover its <b>dynamic</b> type, and other type operations that depend on runtime type information. More generally, most programming languages include mechanisms for dispatching over different 'kinds' of data, such as disjoint unions, subtype polymorphism, and variant types. Even when not interacting with type annotations or type checking, such mechanisms are materially similar to <b>dynamic</b> typing implementations. See programming language for more discussion of the interactions between static and <b>dynamic</b> typing.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, MTs are {{metastable}} polymers made of α- and β-tubulin, alternating between growing and shrinking phases, a {{phenomenon known as}} <b>dynamic</b> instability. MTs are highly <b>dynamic</b> structures, whose behavior is integrated with kinetochore function to control chromosome movement and segregation.|$|E
25|$|Late {{static binding}} is {{a variant of}} binding somewhere between static and <b>dynamic</b> binding. The binding of names before the program is run is called static (early); {{bindings}} performed as the program runs are <b>dynamic</b> (late or virtual).|$|E
