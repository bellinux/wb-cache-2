500|$|Celine Dion {{performed}} the song {{as part of}} her A New Day... concert at Caesars Palace. The song appeared on her 2002 studio album, A New Day Has Come, and on her 2004 live album, A New Day... Live in Las Vegas. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic said that the decision to include [...] "Nature Boy" [...] in A New Day Has Come was inspired by the song's appearance in Baz Luhrmann's musical, Moulin Rouge! (2001). With Billboard, Dion expressed her feelings while recording the track: [...] "This is the one I had the most kick out of in the studio. I could hear the pedal of the piano and the touch of the keys while I was singing. We were following each other, this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>thing.</b> This was such my pleasure." [...] Initially strings and other instrumentation were added in post-production, but were later removed to maintain the simplicity of Cole's version.|$|E

40|$|There is a {{widespread}} delusion that in theoretical nuclear physics protons and neutrons <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>thing,</b> and nucleons <b>are</b> not more than a mathematically equivalent formality. It is shown that, on <b>the</b> contrary, nucleons <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>thing,</b> because {{only a part of}} <b>the</b> theory <b>is</b> essentially identical to proton-and-neutron theory, whereas <b>the</b> remaining part <b>is</b> physically relevant. <b>The</b> approach <b>is</b> general. Thus, this is a paradigm of relation of a wider and a more narrow theory, so that the wider theory describes reality better.

6000|$|You see my kind {{of loyalty}} was loyalty to one's country, not to its {{institutions}} or its office-holders. The country <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>thing,</b> the substantial thing, the eternal thing; it is the thing to watch over, and care for, and be loyal to; institutions are extraneous, they are its mere clothing, and clothing can wear out, become ragged, cease to be comfortable, cease to protect the body from winter, disease, and death. To be loyal to rags, to shout for rags, to worship rags, to die for rags--that is a loyalty of unreason, it is pure animal; it belongs to monarchy, was invented by monarchy; let monarchy keep it. I was from Connecticut, whose Constitution declares [...] "that all political power {{is inherent in the}} people, and all free governments are founded on their authority and instituted for their benefit; and that they have at all times an undeniable and indefeasible right to alter their form of government in such a manner as they may think expedient." ...|$|E

For that <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>thing</b> you seek to do today, to give yourselves to God. This is your spiritual coming of age, in which you set aside your childish dependence upon teachers and upon taught phrases, upon rote and direction, and stand up to look your Master in the face. You profess a great brotherhood when you do that, a brotherhood that goes round the earth, that numbers men of every race and nation and country, that aims to bring God into all the affairs of this world and make him not only the king of your individual lives but the king--in place of all the upstarts, usurpers, accidents, and absurdities who bear crowns and sceptres today--of an united mankind." ...|$|E

6000|$|In {{no part of}} {{the world}} is {{starvation}} an agreeable business; but I believe it is admitted there is no worse place to starve in than this city of Paris. The appearances of life are there so especially gay, it is so much a magnified beer-garden, the houses are so ornate, the theatres so numerous, the very pace of the vehicles is so brisk, that a man in any deep concern of mind or pain of body is constantly driven in upon himself. In his own eyes, he seems the one serious creature moving in a world of horrible unreality; voluble people issuing from a café, the queue at theatre-doors, Sunday cabfuls of second-rate pleasure-seekers, the bedizened ladies of the pavement, the show in the jewellers' windows--all the familiar sights contributing to flout his own unhappiness, want, and isolation. At the same time, if he be at all after my pattern, he is perhaps supported by a childish satisfaction. [...] "This is life at last," [...] he may tell himself; [...] "this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>thing.</b> The bladders on which I was set swimming are now empty; my own weight depends upon the ocean; by my own exertions I must perish or succeed; and I am now enduring, in the vivid fact, what I so much delighted to read of in the case of Lousteau or Lucien, Rodolphe or Schaunard." ...|$|E
60|$|Though {{nobody was}} ever {{much less of}} {{a man of the}} world in one sense, yet Pattison's mind was always in the world. In company he often looked as if he were {{thinking}} of the futility of dinner-party dialectics, where all goes too fast for truth, where people miss one another's points and their own, where nobody convinces or is convinced, and where there is much surface excitement with little real stimulation. That so shrewd a man should have seen so obvious a fact as all this was certain. But he knew that the world <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>thing,</b> that the proper study of mankind is man, and that if books must be counted more instructive and nourishing than affairs, as he thought them to be, it is still only because they are the most complete record of what is permanent, elevated, and eternal in the mind and act of man. Study with him did not mean the compilation of careful abstracts of books, nor did it even mean the historic filiation of thoughts and beliefs. It was the building up before the mind's eye of definite conceptions as to what manner of men had been bred by the diversified agencies of human history, and how given thoughts had shaped the progress of the race. This is what, among other things, led him to spend so much time (p. 116) on the circle of Pope and Addison and Swift.|$|E
6000|$|Thus challenged, the {{prominent}} author pulled himself together. [...] "Oh," [...] he said, sadly, [...] "which of us knows {{whether he has}} natural ability or not, and what is education, and what is life as one sees it, and what is technical training? Do these poor young fellows think that one is tall or short by taking thought? It {{is the same as}} that, it seems to me; or if you prefer a mystical solution, I should say, if you have a longing, from your earliest consciousness, to write poetry or fiction, and cannot keep from doing it for any long time together, you are possibly born with a gift for it. But this may be altogether a mistake; it may be the effect of your early and incessant scribblings on the minds of spectators wholly incompetent to judge of your abilities, such as your fond parents. This must rather often happen if we can judge from what nine-tenths of what is called literature is composed of. If your longing to write <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>thing,</b> or is not, still education will not help or hinder you in doing it. No man was ever yet taught any art. He may be taught a trade, and that is what most of the versing and prosing is, I suppose. If you have the gift, you will technically train yourself: that is, you will learn how to be simple and clear and honest. Charm you will have got from your great-grandfather or great-grandmother; and life, which is only another sort of school, will not qualify you to depict life; but if {{you do not want to}} depict life, you will perhaps be able to meet the demands of what our friend calls the current editors." ...|$|E
