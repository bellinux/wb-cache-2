50|$|Stripboard is {{available}} from many vendors. All versions have copper strips on one side. Some are made using printed circuit board etching and drilling techniques, although some have milled strips and punched holes. The original Veroboard used FR-2 synthetic-resin-bonded paper (SRBP) (also known as phenolic board) as the base board material. Some versions of stripboard now use higher quality FR-4 (fiberglass-reinforced <b>epoxy</b> <b>laminate)</b> material.|$|E
50|$|Perfboard is a {{material}} for prototyping electronic circuits (also called DOT PCB). It is a thin, rigid sheet with holes pre-drilled at standard intervals across a grid, usually a square grid of 2.54 mm (0.1 in) spacing. These holes are ringed by round or square copper pads, though bare boards are also available. Inexpensive perfboard may have pads {{on only one}} side of the board, while better quality perfboard can have pads on both sides (plate-through holes). Since each pad is electrically isolated, the builder makes all connections with either wire wrap or miniature point to point wiring techniques. Discrete components are soldered to the prototype board such as resistors, capacitors, and integrated circuits. The substrate is typically made of paper laminated with phenolic resin (such as FR-2) or a fiberglass-reinforced <b>epoxy</b> <b>laminate</b> (FR-4).|$|E

40|$|This {{study focused}} on characterizing matrix {{cracking}} and delamination behavior in multidirectional laminates. Static tension and tension-tension fatigue tests were conducted on two different layups. Damage onset, accumulation, and residual properties were measured. Matrix cracking was shown to have a considerable influence on residual stiffness of glass <b>epoxy</b> <b>laminates,</b> and could be predicted reasonably well for cracks in 90 deg piles using a simple shear lag analysis. A fracture mechanics analysis for the strain energy release rate associated with 90 deg ply-matrix crack formation was developed and was shown to correlate the onset of 90 deg ply cracks in different laminates. The linear degradation of laminate modulus with delamination area, previously observed for graphite <b>epoxy</b> <b>laminates,</b> was predicted for glass <b>epoxy</b> <b>laminates</b> using a simple rule of mixtures analysis. The strain energy release rate associated with edge delamination formation under static and cyclic loading was difficult to analyze {{because of the presence}} of several contemporary damage phenomena...|$|R

Aircraft designers began to incorporate composite {{materials in the}} form of bonded aluminum honeycomb structural elements and graphite <b>epoxy</b> <b>laminate</b> skins to reduce weight. Infrared search-and-track (IRST) sensors became widespread for air-to-ground weapons delivery, and appeared for air-to-air combat as well. [...] "All-aspect" [...] IR AAM became standard air superiority weapons, which permitted engagement of enemy aircraft from any angle (although the field of view remained relatively limited). The first long-range active-radar-homing RF AAM entered service with the AIM-54 Phoenix, which solely equipped the Grumman F-14 Tomcat, one of the few variable-sweep-wing fighter designs to enter production. Even with the tremendous advancement of air-to-air missiles in this era, internal guns were standard equipment.|$|E

In this work, the various ratio of graphite particles in weigh were reinforced in glass fiber epoxy resin composite laminates were prepared, and then evaluated at different impact angles from 300 to 900 keeping the erodent impact velocity as constant. The erodent used is silica sand with the size varies from 100 – 150 microns of irregular shape. The results were compared with plain <b>epoxy</b> <b>laminate</b> composites.

40|$|Boron nitride-filled <b>epoxy</b> <b>laminate</b> with {{excellent}} thermal conductivity was prepared. Its thermal conductivity was enhanced through sliane surface treatment prior to mixing the epoxy. The lamination enhanced thermal conductivity of the boron nitride filled epoxy by 20 % {{by reducing the}} voids in the structure. The heat conduction mechanism in laminated board, i. e.

This study provides evidence of the importance of temperature and pressure after surface engineering of boron nitride for fabricating high thermal conductivity laminates, establishing the prerequisites for maximizing thermal conductivity of BN-epoxy laminate. The infrared thermogram showed that the BN-laminate can effectively lower the temperature of a surface mounted LED by 12. 5 C compared to the traditional FR 4.

40|$|Electroless copper {{deposition}} was investigated on <b>epoxy</b> <b>laminate</b> substrates (Isola 185 HR) using a silver-based catalyst, and a non-roughening surface treatment method based on sulfuric acid. The current challenges in electroless {{copper deposition}} include (i) {{high cost of}} Pd-based catalysts, (ii) deterioration of electrical performance of deposited metal at high frequency due to electron scattering at the roughened surface, and (iii) limited adhesion strength of electroless layers to substrates. We investigated an electroless copper deposition procedure composed of a H 2 SO 4 surface pretreatment, two-step Sn/Ag nano-colloidal catalyst seeding, and immersion in a traditional formaldehyde-containing electroless copper bath. The H 2 SO 4 pretreatment activated the epoxy surface for electroless deposition. Other strong acids {{did not lead to}} deposition. The H 2 SO 4 treatment cleaned the substrate and provided the adhesion of the catalyst and electroless copper without increasing the surface roughness. XPS results showed a decrease in the carbonyl groups (C=O), and acid/ester functionalities (O-C=O) at the surface. Adsorbed sulfate on the substrate from the H 2 SO 4 treatment led to Sn(II) sensitization. The tin-silver activation step resulted in Sn(IV) and Ag(0) products {{in the form of a}} Sn/Ag nano-colloidal catalyst.

The approach proposed involves the coupling of the classical continuum mechanics formalism to the Eshelby-Kroner self-consistent scale transition model. An inverse scale transition model is used to describe the evolution of local hygroelastic properties of the epoxy matrix as the process of moisture diffusion proceeds. The scale transition relations allow one to determine the local distribution of stresses in the constituents (fiber and matrix) of each ply of the laminates considered from the distribution of macroscopic stresses.
