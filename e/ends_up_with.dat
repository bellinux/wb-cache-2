5|$|Cell {{division}} {{is essential for}} an organism to grow, but, when a cell divides, it must replicate the DNA in its genome so that the two daughter cells have the same genetic information as their parent. The double-stranded structure of DNA provides a simple mechanism for DNA replication. Here, the two strands are separated and then each strand's complementary DNA sequence is recreated by an enzyme called DNA polymerase. This enzyme makes the complementary strand by finding the correct base through complementary base pairing and bonding it onto the original strand. As DNA polymerases can only extend a DNA strand in a 5′ to 3′ direction, different mechanisms are used to copy the antiparallel strands of the double helix. In this way, the base on the old strand dictates which base appears on the new strand, and the cell <b>ends</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a perfect copy of its DNA.|$|E
5|$|Stevie {{is one of}} four {{characters}} who has an official profile on social networking site Twitter, where it is revealed that the character is living in Albert Square before the series starts, staying with her boyfriend Olly.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the video, Katy and her boyfriend (played by actor and model Brian Nagel) have crashed their plane {{in the middle of the}} jungle. Katy shows signs of worry, while her boyfriend takes pictures of himself and dumps his bags on her to explore. As it turns to night, they wander through the jungle as he throws things back at her. Suddenly, he is attacked by a tiger and Katy dumps her bags and runs off screaming. She approaches a lake and is almost bitten by a crocodile when she tries to take a drink. She sits on a rock and <b>ends</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a tarantula crawling on her. As she looks into the lake while singing the chorus, she sees a reflection of a tiger instead of herself. Behind her in the darkness there are dozens of pairs of blinking eyes, but they are revealed to be fireflies which fly around her before forming an image of a roaring tiger in the sky.|$|E
5|$|Naz {{is one of}} four {{characters}} from series 2 who has an official profile on social networking site Twitter, along with Stevie, Stevie's boyfriend Olly Manthrope-Hall (Joshua McGuire) and Fatboy, where it is revealed that the character works in a kebab shop during the summer holiday. Further posts on Twitter allude to the storyline running up {{to the start of the}} series, such as Naz buying the fake ID from Fatboy. Naz also appears in extra video content on the E20 website. In one video, she attempts to take a photo of herself to use on her fake ID. In another, Stevie and Naz have a picnic in the park, and Naz makes a video of Stevie, hoping to make Olly jealous, but Stevie <b>ends</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> cake on her face. In another video, the four friends play a drinking game in the café.

30|$|Of the 239 patients, 27 <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a final {{clinical}} diagnosis of definitive PCD.

Forty percent of patients with an abnormal PRMC test <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> PCD as final clinical diagnosis. Furthermore, the PRMC test had {{a high rate of}} conclusive results (90  %).

30|$|The highest {{percentage}} of patients <b>ending</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> verified PCD as final clinical diagnosis were seen amongst children 4 – 14  years old (67  % of patients having an abnormal PRMC test) while no patients ≥ 55  years <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the final clinical diagnosis of PCD (Table  1). All four patients with an inconclusive PRMC test that <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> PCD as final clinical diagnosis were ≤ 14  years. The reason for their PRMC tests being inconclusive was pronounced coughing resulting in LR 1 and LR 2 values within the normal range while bolus transport and 24 -h static acquisition were abnormal.|$|R

25|$|Scholar Ian Copland {{tries to}} {{estimate}} how many Muslims might {{have been killed in}} the Jammu violence based on demographic data. If the headcount figure of 333,964 refugees from the Indian-held parts of the state is used to calculate an estimate, one <b>ends</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a surplus rather than a deficit. However, Justice Yusuf Saraf estimates that 100,000 Jammu refugees returned to their homes in 1949–1950. If we deduct this 100,000 from the original headcount figure, the estimate of Muslims killed would be a few tens of thousands.|$|E

25|$|The {{effects of}} this mixing depend on the types (the alleles) of the gene. If the father has two copies of an allele for red hair, and the mother has two copies for brown hair, all their {{children}} get the two alleles that give different instructions, one for red hair and one for brown. The hair color of these children depends on how these alleles work together. If one allele dominates the instructions from another, {{it is called the}} dominant allele, and the allele that is overridden is called the recessive allele. In the case of a daughter with alleles for both red and brown hair, brown is dominant and she <b>ends</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> brown hair.|$|E
25|$|Therefore, {{the first}} past the post system {{means that the}} number of MPs elected may not reflect the overall popular vote share across the parties. Thus, it is not {{necessarily}} the party with the largest share of the popular vote that <b>ends</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the largest number of MPs. (See details of the elections in 1951 and February 1974) Since 1935 no party has achieved more than 50% of the popular vote in a British general election. The voting system favours parties with relatively concentrated support: a widely distributed vote leaves a party at risk of getting a large vote share but doing poorly in terms of numbers of seats (as the SDP-Liberal Alliance did in the 1980s), whereas parties with localised votes can win seats with a relatively small share of the vote.|$|E
25|$|Tomari is very {{athletic}} and competitive, so {{in high school}} she joined the track and field club. In contrast to Hazumu and Yasuna who are not athletes and rather feminine, Tomari is a tomboy who does not often partake in traditionally feminine things such as clothing, shopping, or cosmetics. In her entire life, Tomari never wore a yukata during the annual summer festival, and has to borrow on old one from her mother when she finally does wear one during the summer festival shortly after Hazumu's transformation. At least two of Tomari's female friends on the track team consider her very masculine, and like her cool character; one of these friends even says that if Tomari were a boy {{that she would have}} a huge crush on her. Unlike Yasuna, Tomari has a lot of difficulty when it comes to her affection towards Hazumu, but still <b>ends</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> her.|$|E

25|$|Kalân Mosque (Masjid-i Kalân), arguably {{completed}} in 1514, {{is equal to}} the Bibi-Khanym Mosque in Samarkand in size. The mosque is able to accommodate 12 thousand people. Although Kalyan Mosque and Bibi-Khanym Mosque of Samarkand are of the same type of building, they are different in terms of art of building. 288 monumental pylons serve as a support for the multidomed roofing of the galleries encircling the courtyard of Kalyan Mosque. The longitudinal axis of the courtyard <b>ends</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a portal to the main chamber (maksura) with a cruciform hall, topped with a massive blue cupola on a mosaic drum.

25|$|At {{the end of}} the summer, {{the various}} kids are {{preparing}} to move on with their lives. Liam comes back from his job on the fishing boat and asks Annie twice to marry him; she says no both times. Liam drunkenly buys a beach bar and starts to develop feelings for a widow he met over the summer. Silver and Navid are living together as Navid manages his business, but are forced to take in his rebellious teenage sister, Leila (Summer Bishil), when she refuses to go to boarding school. His life is complicated by Leila's rebellious nature and by the discovery that his uncle has been running a stolen car ring out of Shirazi Studios. Not only is this tough on Navid, but also on Silver who is doing most of the babysitting of Leila. Ivy finds herself dealing with the emotional toll from Raj's deteriorating health. Naomi, attempting to make a big impression at CU buys a large house, coming into conflict with the owner's son Austin (Justin Deeley), who had been growing marijuana on the property. Austin is a very rich, down-to-earth country man. He is very different than Naomi's ex-boyfriend Max, who was the complete opposite. Naomi throws a big elaborate beginning of school party for CU students, but this backfires when the party is raided by the police and Naomi disposes of Austin's marijuana plants by tossing them on a bonfire, causing CU's star quarterback to later test positive for drug use. The disastrous party causes Naomi to enter CU as the most unpopular girl in school, a situation she attempts to rectify by pledging a popular sorority. Initially, things appear to be going well as Naomi is taken under the wing of the sorority President, Holly (Megalyn Echikunwoke). But after performing a series of humiliating hazing rituals, Naomi discovers that Holly never intended to let her into the sorority and that this was all done to humiliate Naomi. Vowing revenge, Naomi buys her way into the only sorority that will have her: one made up of nerds and social rejects, and becomes their president. Naomi has sex with Austin after he agrees to help her new sorority humiliate Holly. However, she later learns that Austin was using her to break up with Holly, whom he had been dating. When Holly invites Max to a campus event to unsettle Naomi, she rekindles her romance with him, but still finds herself attracted to Austin. Naomi later <b>ends</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> Austin and she and Holly become short-lived friends. After Naomi gets the internship that Holly wanted, Holly retaliates by attempting to sleep with Austin. Ironically the internship that Naomi received was given to her by Holly's mom, which causes family tension between Holly and her mom. Naomi hits Holly where it really hurts; she wins over Holly's mom.|$|E
