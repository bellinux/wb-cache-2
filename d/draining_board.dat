A. auricula-judae growing in wet evergreen and shola forests shows remarkable variation in size, shape and colour. In Australia, it is found in Eucalyptus woodland and rainforests; in the rainforests, it can grow in very large colonies on fallen logs. It favours older branches, where it feeds as a saprophyte (on dead wood) or a weak parasite (on living wood), and it causes white rot.|$|E

Series art {{director}} Lia Kramer, who had helped create The 1900 House, identified the property and oversaw its restoration. The Tudorbethan house, originally built in 1932 by Bradfield Bros & Murphy, was retrofitted to reflect the technology and fashions of a middle-class English home of the late 1930s. It is a gable-ended, three-bedroom, semi-detached home. A boiler fueled by coke provided hot water, {{and there was no}} telephone or refrigerator. Sold for 875 pounds in 1932, the producers purchased the house for ₤187,000 in 1999. The house was in excellent structural condition, and no major renovations had occurred. Restoration included the removal of central heating and radiators, the custom-fitted kitchen cabinets and appliances, and the carpeting. Removal of the carpeting revealed checkerboard floor tiles. Several fireplaces were restored to working condition, and the original French doors which led outside to the patio were reinstalled. The producers discovered that the house had incurred bomb damage during World War II, and that the owner of the home had suffered a fatal heart attack putting out a fire caused by a bomb in the backyard garden in 1942. The home's original paint was uncovered, and discovered to be bright blues, pinks, and greens. 1940s-era floral wallpaper was purchased and reinstalled in some areas of the home (including the entryway). The house was decorated in a style typical of the 1930s, which included some used Victorian furniture and a small number of Art Deco pieces. The existing beds were replaced by iron bedsteads (including twin beds for Michael and Lyn). When neighbours learned of the project, many donated period home furnishings for free. A 1930s-style gas-fired cooking stove, Belfast sink, <b>draining</b> <b>board,</b> metal-topped table, and fold-down work shelf were installed in the kitchen.

Introduction: The subject of home building is important to every American. The modern home should have a distinct character particularly its own. It should have architectural beauty and attractiveness {{as well as all}} the modern requisites for utility. It is the work of the architect to consider carefully the needs of the housekeeper {{in order to make a}} convenient arrangement which will afford economy and ease, thus there is a distinct relation between the, work of the architect and that of the housekeeper. The housekeeping requirements depend upon the floor plan of the house and economy of work to the housekeeper depends upon its good construction. Interior construction and decoration are greatly related to the economy of work of the housekeeper. While it is well to consider the artistic qualities, these should not be elaborate. The term household conveniences is a somewhat modern one. "Those arrangements and appliances which make it possible for people to live more comfortable and in larger houses without seriously increasing the cares which they had in smaller ones" and making them more easily accomplished, "are called modern conveniences", or anything which saves labor may be regarded as a modern convenience. In the modern kitchen and laundry may be found the conveniences which are most appreciated by the housekeeper.

40|$|Electroplating {{has been}} {{introduced}} to Sri Lanka {{more than a hundred}} years ago and there are more than 80 electroplating units in Sri Lanka, including household units. However, it has been found that the electroplating technology in Sri Lanka is lagging behind the world level and several problems of electroplating facilities with regard to plating technology and wastewater treatment had been identified. The objective of this study was to investigate the possibilities of waste minimization and optimization of wastewater treatment in the electroplating industry using readily available resources and technologies in the country, focusing on the nickel and chromium-plating process and treatment of wastewater generated in that process. Methodology of this study consisted of making observations of the existing process estimating water and energy consumption, analysis of process solutions and treated wastewater, studying process parameters used in the production process and wastewater treatment, and carrying out a designed experiment to study optimum pH for heavy metal precipitation. It was found that quality control of the product is poor and the industry lacks technical know-how to carry out the electroplating process and wastewater treatment efficiently. However, the industry has already implemented a few quality control and waste minimization activities such as quality control of intermediate product within the process, two stage rinsing, and dragout recovery. Possibilities to reduce electricity and water consumption without affecting the quality of the product through introduction of temperature control units for heaters, removal of unnecessary unit operations employed in the production process etc. and the necessity of proper stripping of rejects before recycling them into the production process in order to avoid unnecessary contaminations of bath solutions were identified. With regard to the wastewater treatment, it was found that the optimum pH for hydroxide precipitation of nickel and chromium in a mixture is pH 8. 0. It is recommended to introduce <b>drain</b> <b>boards,</b> stripping for rejects, temperature feed back control system for heaters and improved process control in nickel-plating activity immediately and, to study the possibility of working longer hours a day than the normal 8 hr shift, which would increase the savings on electricity used for bath heating. It is also recommended to omit unnecessary unit operations and to change over to Cr 3 + chromium plating solution instead of Cr 6 + solutions, while proper quality control procedures such as corrosion resistance test & Adhesion tests are carried out to increase the value of the product and reduce wastage. Measures recommended to improve the wastewater treatment system include carrying out chromium reduction at pH 3 for a minimum period of 30 minutes, strict control of Cr 6 + discharge into the Heavy Metal Precipitation Tank, carrying out nickel and chromium precipitation at a pH value between 8 - 8. 5 and filtering supernatant of the sedimentation tank to avoid escape of suspended material with the supernatant...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Discharge {{capacity}} {{is the most}} important factor to evaluate the well resistance of prefabricated vertical (PV) drains. In this study, large-scale test apparatus were devised to investigate the accurate discharge capacity of plastic <b>board</b> <b>drain</b> (PBD) and fiber drain (FD). A series of laboratory flow test of PBD and FD has been carried out to evaluate those discharge capacities with same condition in the field. Drain sample length tested ranging from 0. 7 m to 30 m by confining the drain in clay. It is found that discharge capacity qw of PV drains decreases with increasing the confining pressure, the hydraulic gradient, and drain length. It is strongly recommended that for determining the design value of qw and kw the discharge capacity test should be performed using a half sample length of real field depth.

40|$|In the {{northern}} {{section of the}} Shoalhaven River floodplain, flood mitigation drains have worsened the impacts of acid sulphate soils. Such impacts include levels of pH and aluminium in the drains and estuary that are potentially fatal to flora and fauna, especially after heavy rains. This study concentrates on four properties {{to the south of}} Berry on 251 hectares of improved pastoral land. Water quality was monitored in wells, drainsites and in Broughton Creek over a 15 week period from June to September 1994 that was drier than average. Soils were also sampled and analysed. Actual and potential acid sulphate soils, including jarositic clay layers seem to be confined to unripe soil below 0. 2 m elevation in low backswamp areas. Water quality was worst in the drains and in backswamp wells with pH as low as 3. 1 and aluminium concentration as high as 58 mg/L in the drains. Main drains cut into actual acid sulphate soils and poor quality water from the soils flows into them. Water level dropped in all wells and main drainsites over the monitoring period and had dropped below the top of jarositic clay in some backswamp wells. pH dropped with water level in the main drains but not in wells. Raising the water level in the <b>drains</b> with stop <b>boards</b> or temporary weirs in order to raise the water table above the top of jarositic clay seems the most promising option that might be trialed.

40|$|AbstractRecently, the {{disposal}} of dredged soil has become a worldwide problem. In order to utilize high water content soil material, {{it is essential to}} dewater and increase the soil strength. There are urgent demands for developing an alternative new method to dewater the dredged soils in more economical and environment friendly standpoint. Furthermore, by using adsorption effect of porous material such as granular blast furnace slag, there is possibility to establish purification technology of contaminated soil. In this paper, the siphon method is proposed to dewater the high water content dredged soil with horizontally installed plastic <b>board</b> <b>drain</b> and filter material. In order to investigate the availability and effectiveness of this method, series of tests were conducted to investigate the dewatering behaviour and strength of dredged soil with vacuum and siphon methods by using different materials as filter, such as Toyoura sand, zeolite, granular blast furnace slag. High water content dredged soil can be consolidated by using siphon method with saturated filter material such as Toyoura sand. However, it was impossible to dewater dredged soil by using siphon method with unsaturated porous filter material. The water retention tests of soil by using centrifuge method was performed to clarify the mechanism of preventing consolidation dredged soil. The test cannot find an accurate soil-water retention curve of dredged soil because of volume change. The water retention test by suction method was performed and clarify the mechanism that prevents consolidation dredged soil. The cause that prevents consolidation of dredged soil has been presumes by clarifying the air entry value. In addition, degree of saturation and suction in dredged soil and filter material has been clarified by using aquameters. The examination whether consolidation of dredged soil on various conditions focused on height of dredged soil and filter material is performed based on the revealed mechanism...|$|R
