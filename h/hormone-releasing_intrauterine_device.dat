40|$|PURPOSE: Main {{aim was to}} {{estimate}} the association between use of exogenous hormones and breast cancer (BC) risk in a large population-based survey, and to assess the representativeness and overall validity of the data. METHODS: The survey 'Women's Health and Use of Hormones' was conducted in Finland in 2009, including 7, 000 BC cases and 20, 000 matched population controls. Conditional logistic regression was used {{to estimate}} odds ratios and their 95 % confidence interval. For validation, exposure prevalences were compared with population data from Statistics Finland and two large population-based surveys. RESULTS: We found positive associations with BC risk and exclusive use of <b>hormone-releasing</b> <b>intrauterine</b> <b>device</b> (HR IUD) in postmenopausal women (1. 48, 95 % CI 1. 10 - 1. 99), when compared to never-users of any hormonal contraceptive and considering only prediagnostic use in cases. Regarding use of other hormonal contraceptives (HC), a positive association between long HC use (≥ 2 years) and BC was observed in both groups, OR being 1. 37 (95 % CI 1. 12 - 1. 68) for premenopausal and 1. 11 (95 % CI 1. 03 - 1. 20) for postmenopausal women, when compared to never-users of other HC. CONCLUSIONS: Observed association between HR IUD use and risk of BC in postmenopausal women is worrying and deserves further attention. Selection bias seemed not to explain this result. Considering the increasing popularity of HR IUD use in, e. g., USA, impact of possible adverse effects in public health could be significant...|$|E

40|$|Background: Pelvic {{inflammatory}} {{disease is a}} community-acquired infection accounting for approximately 1. 2 million hospital visits and $ 1. 88 billion in cost annually in the United States. Few interventions are available {{for the prevention of}} pelvic {{inflammatory disease}}. <b>Intrauterine</b> <b>devices</b> are a well established method of contraception, in addition, levonorgestrel-releasing <b>intrauterine</b> <b>devices</b> may provide a protective advantage against pelvic inflammatory disease. This review aims to evaluate the available evidence to determine if levonorgestrel <b>intrauterine</b> <b>devices,</b> in addition to contraception, provide a protective benefit against pelvic inflammatory disease when compared to other <b>intrauterine</b> <b>devices.</b> Method: An extensive literature search was performed using the databases MEDLINE, Web of Science, and CINAHL. Duplicate results and non-English articles were excluded. Articles meeting inclusion criteria were analyzed using the GRADE system. Results: The literature search identified three articles that met inclusion criteria. All studies were randomized comparison trials involving a levonorgestrel <b>intrauterine</b> <b>device</b> compared to one or more forms of copper <b>intrauterine</b> <b>device.</b> Studies showed conflicting evidence supporting the benefit of levonorgestrel <b>intrauterine</b> <b>devices</b> for the prevention of pelvic inflammatory disease. All studies were of very low quality. Conclusion: Limited very low quality evidence is available to support the potential benefit of levonorgestrel <b>intrauterine</b> <b>devices</b> for the prevention of pelvic inflammatory disease. Research results are conflicting and there is a small amount of very low quality evidence to support this theory. Based on the current research levonorgestrel <b>intrauterine</b> <b>devices</b> for the prevention of pelvic inflammatory disease are not recommended. Further well designed prognostic studies are needed to determine the protective potential of levonorgestrel <b>intrauterine</b> <b>devices...</b>|$|R
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the study}} was to provide an {{overview}} to infectious and reactive cytological effects of <b>intrauterine</b> <b>devices,</b> which are one of the most widely used methods of contraception, with the results we obtained in the Mardin region. Material and Method: We evaluated together the pap smears of the 300 <b>intrauterine</b> <b>device</b> (+) and 300 <b>intrauterine</b> <b>device</b> (-) patients sent to the pathology department in the period of 2010 - 2011. Genital infection rates and frequency of reactive-dysplastic cellular changes were statistically compared between the groups together with the literature data. Results: In the <b>intrauterine</b> <b>device</b> (+) group, 2 (+) and more severe inflammation was observed in 66. 3 % of cases. Bacterial vaginosis (26 %), candida (12 %) and trichomonas vaginalis (8 %) were recorded as the most common infectious agents, followed by actinomyces (4 %). Between the groups of <b>intrauterine</b> <b>device</b> (+) and (-), no significant difference was observed in terms of the incidence of squamous cell abnormalities, except ASC-US (p= 0. 02). In the <b>intrauterine</b> <b>device</b> (+) group, the presence of atypical glandular cells and reactive findings was significantly higher than the control group. After the removal of the <b>intrauterine</b> <b>device,</b> 61 cases that had control smears showed regression, with a rate of % 75. 4 (n= 46). Conclusion: The local irritative and inflammatory effect of <b>intrauterine</b> <b>devices</b> basically causes reactive and regenerative changes mostly in glandular cells. <b>Intrauterine</b> <b>devices</b> disrupt the genital flora and significantly increase the frequency of genital infection by creating a foreign body reaction...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Intrauterine</b> <b>device</b> (IUD) {{migration}} and colon perforation {{is a rare}} but serious complication occurring sometimes years after insertion. Laparoscopic removal of a colon-perforating device is a seldom-used approach. Case: A 35 -year-old presented with right upper quadrant (RUQ) abdominal pain one year following <b>intrauterine</b> <b>device</b> (IUD) insertion. Upon vaginal examination, no IUD string was detected. An abdominal X-ray depicted the IUD in a position below the hepatic flexure. Abdominal computerized tomography (CT) scan suggested an IUDlike foreign object posterior and medial to the hepatic flexure. Colon perforation by an <b>intrauterine</b> <b>device</b> was diagnosed, the device was identified and removed, and the intestinal damage was repaired with a laparoscopic approach. Conclusion: Clinical diagnosis and surgical removal of a perforating <b>intrauterine</b> <b>device</b> reduces the possible risks of abdominal complications this condition presents.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Complications {{of copper}} load <b>intrauterine</b> <b>devices,</b> {{including}} ectopic pregnancies are well reported. Rates of ectopic pregnancy are 0. 6 to 1. 1 % per year. However, the levonorgestrel <b>intrauterine</b> <b>device</b> {{has been described}} as more protective against ectopic pregnancies due to the addition of the hormone levonorgestrel. The hormone released from the <b>intrauterine</b> <b>device</b> causes some systemic effects, but local effects such as glandular atrophy and stromal decidualization, in addition to foreign body reaction, are dominant. Few case reports have described ampullary ectopic pregnancies. However, we report, for the first time, a major complication of levonorgestrel intrauterine device: a cornual pregnancy. Case presentation A 36 -year-old Caucasian nulliparous woman presented with complaints of progressive nausea, abdominal pain and irregular vaginal bleeding for 2 months. For 3 years, she had been using a levonorgestrel <b>intrauterine</b> <b>device.</b> A two-dimensional transvaginal sonogram noted a sac situated external to the endometrial cavity in the right cornua of the uterus with an empty uterus. She was successfully treated with chemotherapy. Conclusion Many complications have been described, including ectopic pregnancies, using copper <b>intrauterine</b> <b>devices.</b> The levonorgestrel-releasing <b>intrauterine</b> system is a particularly good choice for adolescents because of associated non-contraceptive benefits such as decreased menstrual bleeding, dysmenorrhea and pain associated with endometriosis 1. Yet a cornual pregnancy following the use of a levonorgestrel <b>intrauterine</b> <b>device</b> is a complication which, to our knowledge, has not been described before. Physicians prescribing this type of <b>intrauterine</b> <b>device</b> should be aware of this rare event. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Intrauterine</b> {{contraceptive}} <b>device</b> is {{the most}} common method of reversible contraception in women. The <b>intrauterine</b> contraceptive <b>device</b> can perforate the uterus and can also migrate into pelvic or abdominal organs. Perforation of the urinary bladder by an <b>intrauterine</b> contraceptive <b>device</b> is not common. In West Africa, intravesi‑ cal migration of an <b>intrauterine</b> contraceptive <b>device</b> has been rarely reported. In this report, we present a case of an <b>intrauterine</b> contraceptive <b>device</b> migration into the urinary bladder of a 33 year old African woman at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital, Kumasi, Ghana. Case report: A 33 year old African woman presented with persistent urinary tract infection of 7 months duration despite appropriate antibiotic treatments. An abdominal ultrasonography revealed a urinary bladder calculus which was found to be an <b>intrauterine</b> contraceptive <b>device</b> on removal at cystoscopy. She got pregnant whilst having the <b>intrauterine</b> contraceptive <b>device</b> in place and delivered at term.

40|$|Background: <b>Intrauterine</b> {{contraceptive}} <b>devices</b> (IUCDs) {{comprise the}} most popular form of reversible contracep-tion. Uterine perforation is a rare but potentially serious complication associated with their use. We examined all reported cases of elective surgical removal of peritoneally migrated IUCDs, to compare laparoscopic and open ap-proaches, and to identify beneficial surgical techniques. Database: MEDLINE and Embase were searched using the following medical subject heading terms: (IUCD or IUD or IUS or <b>intrauterine</b> <b>device</b> or <b>intrauterine</b> <b>devices,</b> copper or <b>intrauterine</b> <b>devices,</b> medicated) AND (migrated or displaced or foreign-body migration or <b>intrauterine</b> <b>device</b> migration) AND (peritoneal or peritoneal cavity). The Cochrane Library was searched using the terms IUCD, IUD, IUS, and <b>intrauterine</b> <b>device.</b> Additional studies were identified by manually searching the reference lists of the studies found through database search. Studies were in-cluded irrespective of language or publication type. Discussion:We identified 129 cases, reported in 30 stud-ies. In {{the majority of cases}} (93. 0 % [120 / 129]), surgery was attempted laparoscopically; however 22. 5 % (27 / 120) of surgeries were converted to open operations, giving an overall rate of open surgery of 27. 9 % (36 / 129). This sys-tematic review supports the use of laparoscopic surgery for elective removal of migrated IUCDs from the perito-neal cavity. With complications rarely reported, it is also likely the procedure could be undertaken in an outpatient setting. The use of intraoperative adjuncts (ie, cystoscopy) and the rate of conversion to open surgery are influenced by the site of the IUCD. Therefore, accurate preoperative localization of the device is advised...|$|R
