40|$|Mixed cryoglobulinemia (MC) includes:MC type II, {{composed}} by polyclonal IgGmonoclonal IgM, and MC type III, {{composed by}} polyclonal IgG-polyclonal IgM immune-complexes. MC may be secondary to various immunological,hematological, and infectiousd <b>iseases,</b> <b>or</b> it can represent a distinct disorder, the ‘essential’ MC. Following {{the discovery of}} a causative role of HCV, the term ‘essential’ is now referred to {{only a small percentage of}} patients. MC classification criteria include: serum mixed cryoglobulins, hypocomplementemia (low C 4), leukocytoclastic vasculitis, typical clinical triad - purpura, weakness, arthralgias-, and multiple organ involvement. MC may share various clinico-serological features with different immunological/ neoplastic diseases; differential diagnosis should take in account other systemic vasculitides, Sjogren’s syndrome, autoimmune hepatitis, and B-cell lymphomas. MC syndrome is an immune-complex mediated systemic vasculitis (leukocytoclastic vasculitis) involving the small vessels, clinically characterized by cutaneous manifestations (orthostatic purpura, and ulcers), liver, renal, peripheral nerves, widespread vasculitis, and possible development of neoplastic disorders, mainly B-cell lymphomas. MC cumulative survival is significantly lower if compared to general population. Treatment of MC syndrome is particularly challenging because of its complex etiopathogenesis, including HCV infection, autoimmune, and lymphoproliferative alterations; it may include etiological, pathogenetic, and/or symptomatic therapies. An attempt to eradicate the HCV (interferon ribavirin) should be done in all HCV-related MC, particularly in those with active hepatitis. The immunosuppressors (cyclophosphamide or rituximab), alone or in combination with high dosage steroids and/or plasma exchange, can be usefully employed in MC patients with severe/active complications (glomerulonephritis, widespread vasculitis, sensory-motor neuropathy) ...|$|E
40|$|Background There is {{evidence}} from observational studies that whole grai ns {{can have a}} beneficial effect on risk for cardiovascular disease (C VD). Earlier versions of this review found mainly short-term inte rvention studies. There are now longer-term randomised contr olled trials (RCTs) available. This is an update and expansion of the origi nal review conducted in 2007. Objectives The aim of this systematic review {{was to assess the}} effect of wh ole grain foods or diets on total mortality, cardiovascular ev ents, and cardiovascular risk factors (blood lipids, blood pressure) in h ealthy people or people who have established cardiovascular d <b>isease</b> <b>or</b> related risk factors, using all eligible RCTs. Search methods We searched CENTRAL (Issue 8, 2016) in the Cochrane Library, MED LINE (1946 to 31 August 2016), Embase (1980 to week 35 2016), and CINAHL Plus (1937 to 31 August 2016) on 31 August 2016. We also searched ClinicalTrials. gov on 5 July 2017 and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Re gistry Platform (WHO ICTRP) on 6 July 2017. We checked reference l ists of relevant articles and applied no language restrictions. Selection criteria We selected RCTs assessing the effects of whole grain foods or d iets containing whole grains compared to foods or diets with a s imilar composition, over a minimum of 12 weeks, on cardiovascular dise ase and related risk factors. Eligible for inclusion were heal thy adults, those at increased risk of CVD, or those previously diagnosed with CVD. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected studies. Data wer e extracted and quality-checked by one review author and checked by a second review author. A second review author checked the analys es. We assessed treatment effect using mean difference in a fixe d- effect model and heterogeneity using the I 2 statistic and the Chi 2 test of heterogeneity. We assessed the overall quality of ev idence using GRADE with GRADEpro software...|$|R
