40|$|Abstract: This {{article has}} carried out {{systematic}} {{research on the}} multi-tooth meshing problem of involute <b>internal</b> <b>gear</b> <b>pairs</b> with small tooth number difference of normal gear. It firstly establishes the entity assembly model of <b>internal</b> <b>gear</b> <b>pairs</b> with precise tooth profile, then determines the number of multi-tooth meshing teeth pairs with finite element software and finally analyzes the main factors and reason affecting the number of meshing teeth pairs. In the range of tooth number of <b>internal</b> <b>gear</b> equal to 40 - 200, the conclusion is that when tooth number difference equal to 1 the number of effective meshing teeth pairs is 3 - 15,when tooth number difference equal to 5 the number of effective meshing teeth pairs is 3 - 11. The main factors affecting the number of meshing teeth pairs are tooth number and tooth number difference. The fewer tooth number is and the greater tooth number difference is, the fewer the number of meshing teeth pairs is. The reason is that when tooth number is obviously reduced or tooth number difference is obviously increased, the clearance of adjacent gear surface will be greatly increased, which will cause the decrease {{of the number of}} meshing teeth pairs. Within the normal value scope of modification coefficient difference of involute <b>internal</b> <b>gear</b> <b>pairs</b> with small tooth number difference, the influence of modification coefficient difference and modification coefficient is very small. When the torque increases, the number of effective contacting teech pairs will keep unchanged. The research in this article provides reference for the calculation of loading capacity of multi-tooth meshing of <b>internal</b> <b>gear</b> <b>pairs</b> with small tooth number difference of normal gear...|$|R
40|$|This {{work is a}} {{contribution}} to the contact analysis of excentric gears, dealing with the increased load capacity due to multi teeth contact. A contact model has been developed for the determination of the load distribution between the teeth. This model allows also the calculation of the stresses {{at the root of the}} teeth in <b>internal</b> <b>gear</b> <b>pairs</b> without manufacturing errors. The model is based on the flexibility method, which allows the contact analysis for every meshing position of the gears. The integration of finite element calculation as well as the gear calculation leads to a program system for contact analysis for any <b>internal</b> <b>gear</b> <b>pairs.</b> With the respect to the numerical analysis, an extended analytical approach according to DIN 3990, methode B, is developed. This approach results in a more exact estimation of the root load capacity of <b>internal</b> <b>gears.</b> The maximum stresses in the root and the number of contacting teeth are dependend on the specifical driving moment and the number of teeth of the <b>gear</b> <b>pair.</b> These dependencies are given in diagrams.
