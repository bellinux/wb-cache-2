5|$|Angel {{returns to}} his hotel and finds Epiphany on his doorstep. He invites her into his room, where they have {{aggressive}} sexual intercourse, during which Angel has visions of blood dripping from the ceiling and splashing around the room. He later confronts Krusemark in a gumbo hut, where the latter reveals that he and Margaret {{were the ones who}} helped Favorite leave the hospital. He also explains that <b>Favorite</b> <b>was</b> actually a powerful magician who sold his soul to Satan in exchange for stardom, but then sought to renege on the bargain. In 1943, Favorite kidnapped a young soldier and performed a Satanic ritual on the boy, murdering him and eating his still-beating heart in order to assume his identity and hide from the Devil. <b>Favorite</b> <b>was</b> supposed to drop out and resurface as the soldier he murdered, but was unexpectedly drafted into the war, injured, then sent home with amnesia. Hoping to jar his memory, the Krusemarks took Favorite from the hospital and released him into Times Square, never to be seen again. Angel has a panic attack and runs into the bathroom. He returns to find Krusemark drowned in a cauldron of boiling gumbo.|$|E
5|$|Patrick Stewart {{sought a}} {{change to the}} script to have the crew defend the Ba'ku village {{in the manner of}} the Battle of the Alamo instead of fleeing into the mountains. Piller could not find a {{feasible}} way to include this in the script, and the budget ruled out the creation of Alamo-like structures in the mountains. Several titles were considered for the film as shooting approached. Star Trek: Where Time Stands Still, Star Trek: Forever and Star Trek: Beyond Paradise were all considered but were rejected. Piller's <b>favorite</b> <b>was</b> Star Trek: Sacred Honor, but the studio rejected this because they were concerned that it sounded too religious. When shooting began, the film was still called Star Trek IX.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>Favorite</b> <b>was</b> wrecked, over 200 of {{her crew}} and soldier-passengers {{had reached the}} land and, having set fire to their ship, {{prepared}} to march on Port St. George {{under the leadership of}} Colonel Gifflenga. Two British midshipmen left in command of the town organised the British and indigenous population into a defensive force and marched to meet Gifflenga. The junior British officers informed Gifflenga that the return of the British squadron would bring overwhelming numbers of sailors, marines and naval artillery to bear on his small force and that if he surrendered immediately he could expect better terms. Gifflenga recognised that his position was untenable and capitulated. At Port St. George, the Venetian gunboat Lodola sneaked unnoticed into the harbour and almost captured a Sicilian privateer, Vincitore. The raider was driven off by the remaining garrison of the town without the prize, while attempting to manoeuvre her out of the bay.|$|E

5|$|While the Giro had in its peloton many notable riders, {{including}} six former Grand Tour winners, the odds-on <b>favorite</b> <b>was</b> always 's Alberto Contador. The 2008 Giro champion, who had likewise won the 2008 Vuelta a España and three {{editions of the}} Tour de France, announced in April 2010 that he would contest the Giro in 2011. Though his status was put in doubt after a positive test for clenbuterol at the 2010 Tour de France, he was cleared by his national federation in February 2011 and {{able to return to}} racing, though the case still pended a final appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport later in 2011. Contador was the overwhelming favorite for overall victory. Reigning Giro champion Ivan Basso chose not to return, preferring to focus on the Tour de France later in the season. He briefly considered riding as a domestique for Vincenzo Nibali, but opted against it because of his physical condition at the time and the feeling that doing so would be disrespectful to the race. The 2011 Giro was thus the third successive edition, and fourth in the last five, in which the reigning champion did not return to defend his championship.|$|E
25|$|Vysotsky {{used his}} fingers {{instead of a}} pick to pluck and strum, as was the {{tradition}} with Russian guitar playing. He {{used a variety of}} finger picking and strumming techniques.

25|$|HMS Favourite (or <b>Favorite)</b> <b>was</b> a 16-gun Cormorant-class sloop of the Royal Navy, {{launched}} in 1794 at Rotherhithe. The French captured her in 1806 and renamed her Favorite. However, the British recaptured her in 1807 and renamed her HMS Goree. She became a prison ship in 1810 and was broken up in Bermuda in 1817.|$|E

He maintained a penthouse at the Embajador Hotel in the capital.|$|E
25|$|In 1959, James T. Aubrey Jr. {{became the}} {{president}} of CBS. Under Aubrey, the network became the most popular on television with shows like The Beverly Hillbillies and Gilligan's Island. However, Paley's personal <b>favorite</b> <b>was</b> Gunsmoke; in fact, {{he was such a}} fan of Gunsmoke that, upon its threatened cancellation in 1967, he demanded that it be reinstated, a dictum that led to the abrupt demise of Gilligan's Island, which had already been renewed for a fourth season.|$|E
25|$|In retirement, Arnold stayed {{active in}} {{aviation}}, joining the Cubic Corporation Board of Directors, the Golden Eagles, the San Diego Aerospace Museum {{and various other}} naval aviation oriented groups. Ever the artist, he continued drawing and working in his garden. Occasionally, he would put an entry into the Rancho Santa Fe Garden Club show, almost always gaining a ribbon or two.

25|$|My {{favorite}} {{king was}} King Melchior, {{because he was}} the oldest and had a long white beard. My brother's <b>favorite</b> <b>was</b> King Kaspar. He insisted that this king was a little crazy and quite deaf. I don't know why he was so positive about his being deaf. I suspect it was because dear King Kaspar never brought him all the gifts he requested. He was also rather puzzled by the fact that King Kaspar carried the myrrh, which appeared to him as a rather eccentric gift, for he never quite understood what the word meant.|$|E
25|$|Ralea's {{literary}} columns {{very often}} promoted modernist writers, or modernist interpretations of classical ones, {{such as when}} he used Janet's psychology to explain the genesis of works by Thomas Hardy. More famous was his reading of Proust through Henri Bergson's classification of memory. Ralea offered much praise to rationalist modernists such as Alexandru A. Philippide, and hailed Tudor Arghezi, the eclectic modernizer of poetic language, as Romania's greatest poet of the day. Ralea (and, before him, Ibrăileanu) campaigned for social realism in prose. His natural <b>favorite</b> <b>was</b> Sadoveanu, {{but he was also}} enthusiastic about modernist novels with a flavor of social radicalism, including those by Sburătoruls Hortensia Papadat-Bengescu.|$|E
25|$|While <b>Favorite</b> <b>was</b> sailing under Commander John Davie, L'Hermite's {{squadron}} captured her on 6 January 1806. During {{the night}} before she had been sailing off Cape Verde, towing a prize, when the watch spotted some vessels. Favourite cast off her tow and attempted to move to windward of the strangers but lost track of them. Next morning Favourite saw {{what appeared to be}} three large East Indiamen with a brig as escort, sailing towards her. As they closed, Davie realized that the strange vessels were a ship of the line, two frigates and a sloop. He tried to sail away, but eventually had to surrender when he found himself trapped between Régulus and Président. The French brought their prize into service as Favorite.|$|E

In 1993, Martin Communications Publications named Coach Wood Co-Coach of the Century along with Coach Paul Tyson in their Tops in Texas. In 1999, the Dallas Morning News named Wood Coach of the Century. Wood liked the name so much, {{it became the}} title of his 2001 autobiography, Coach of the Century: an Autobiography by Gordon Wood. Of all the honors Coach Wood has received, his personal <b>favorite</b> <b>was</b> having Brownwood's football stadium named for him in 1980. Wood had been deeply involved in building the stadium.|$|E
25|$|In the decathlon the 1928 Penn Relays were {{originally}} advertised as an Olympic qualifying event; Tony Plansky, the 1924 AAU champion, won the Penn Relays decathlon ahead of Doherty and Churchill with 7142 points. In the end, though, decathlon selections were {{based solely on}} the Philadelphia meet; Plansky was unprepared for having to qualify a second time and only placed 11th. Defending AAU champion Fait Elkins, who entered the Trials as a clear <b>favorite,</b> <b>was</b> also left out of the Olympic team; he injured himself in the first event (100 meters) and had to withdraw. An appeal by Elkins to be selected in spite of his injury was not upheld; he performed poorly in a test two weeks after the Trials, and the selectors felt he had not recovered sufficiently.|$|E
25|$|Eager to {{establish}} his own legitimacy, Zhu Di voided the Jianwen Emperor's reign and established a wide-ranging effort to destroy or falsify records concerning his childhood and rebellion. This included a massive purge of the Confucian scholars in Nanjing and grants of extraordinary extralegal authority to the eunuch secret police. One <b>favorite</b> <b>was</b> Zheng He, who employed his authority to launch major voyages of exploration into the South Pacific and Indian Oceans. The difficulties in Nanjing also led the Yongle Emperor to re-establish Beiping (present-day Beijing) as the new imperial capital. He repaired and reopened the Grand Canal and, between 1406 and 1420, directed {{the construction of the}} Forbidden City. He was also responsible for the Porcelain Tower of Nanjing, considered one of the wonders of the world before its destruction by the Taiping rebels in 1856. As part of his continuing attempt to control the Confucian scholar-bureaucrats, the Yongle Emperor also greatly expanded the imperial examination system in place of his father's use of personal recommendation and appointment. These scholars completed the monumental Yongle Encyclopedia during his reign.|$|E

25|$|Dwight D. Eisenhower {{was elected}} {{president}} in November 1952, and in August 1953 his advisors began strategizing ways to force Bott's resignation so that a new General Counsel could be confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate prior to the November 1954 mid-term elections. When White House Chief of Staff Sherman Adams let Bott know in March 1954 that the administration wanted him out, Bott refused to resign and threatened to sue if he was fired. The administration did not force the issue at that time, since it had not settled on a replacement. The early <b>favorite</b> <b>was</b> NLRB member Philip Ray Rodgers, and his candidacy was pushed by Secretary of Commerce Sinclair Weeks and Senator William F. Knowland (R-CA). The New York Times reported on June 24, 1954, that Rodgers was the administration's choice to replace Bott. But liberal Republicans within the administration opposed Rodgers, and fought for their own candidate. Two months later, Eisenhower announced that his choice for General Counsel was, instead, Theopil C. Kammholz. The administration actually nominated Kammholz in August 1954, but opposition from Senators James E. Murray (D-MT) and Herbert H. Lehman (D-NY) opposed him and the Senate Labor Committee did not act on the nomination.|$|E
