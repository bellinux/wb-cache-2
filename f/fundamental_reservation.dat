50|$|The {{international}} workers' sports {{organizations of}} the socialist and communist movements did not necessarily object {{to some of the}} most noble goals of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), but they did each share <b>fundamental</b> <b>reservations</b> about the modern Olympic games that were the inspiration of Baron Pierre de Coubertin, a hereditary French nobleman. First and foremost, the Olympics of the IOC stressed competition between nations — regarded by the radicals as a manifestation of national chauvinism. Rather than the accentuation of national rivalry and patriotic feeling, international competition should focus on the actual athletic effort in a setting designed to build the ethic of internationalism, both the socialists and communists agreed.|$|R
40|$|Maciej Urbanowski has {{published}} here hitherto unknown letters to Kazimierz Wyka by Stanisław Piasecki and Włodzimierz Pietrzak, written in 1935 - 1938. Their correspondence adds a new {{insight into what}} we know {{of the life of}} Kazimierz Wyka, one of the most outstanding 20 thcentury Polish critics and literary scholars. The letters take us right behind the scenes of the failed attempts to recruit Wyka's pen for "Prosto z mostu", the leading periodical of the literary right in interwar Poland. The generational literary and political sensitivities which Wyka and the writers gathered round Piasecki’s weekly had in common were not enough, as Urbanowski argues, to overcome his more <b>fundamental</b> <b>reservations.</b> Wyka thought highly of some of the contributors of Prosto z mostu", but was put off by the paper’s nationalist ideological line. Nonetheless, Piasecki's and Pietrzak's letters {{give us a sense of}} the complex pattern of inner differences and divisions that characterized the new literary generation of the 1930 s...|$|R
40|$|I {{rather like}} Andy Clark’s book, Supersizing the Mind: Embodiment, Action, and Cognitive Extension, but it {{certainly}} hasn’t put my mind at rest. As always Clark’s writing is uncomplicated and energetic, managing to make everything, from the physiology of the moving body, through {{an analysis of the}} scaffolding role, he maintains is, played by language, to the strategic use of representation, computation and control by the biological brain, both intelligible and interesting. And I {{have a great deal of}} sympathy with his main thesis: that we must consider the whole body, rather than merely the brain, as the locus where sensing and acting are synthesized and through which cognitive systems can engage with their world. But still I find that I have a couple of rather <b>fundamental</b> <b>reservations,</b> alongside a number of ancillary comments that arise from my own puzzlement with some – of what can at first glance seem – disarmingly simple claims...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a preliminary report}} of an audit of {{the current state of}} research methods teaching in UK qualifying social work education. The audit is part of a wider ESRC funded study to provide baseline data for setting progress objectives towards building research capacity in the discipline and profession. The place and purpose of research teaching in social work education is strongly contested. Less contestable, however, is the lack of attention to research in qualifying social work curricula in all four UK countries, despite their differing prescribed curricula but common adherence to the QAA Benchmark Statement and the National Occupational Standards. The marginalisation of research teaching is underlined by the paucity of UK literature on the topic, compared with American and other writing. Reasons for this range from lack of time, staff skill and resource, to more <b>fundamental</b> <b>reservations</b> and resistance on the part of educators, students and practitioners towards engaging with research. At the heart of such ambivalence lies fundamental debate {{about the nature of the}} social work discipline, and the relationship between research and practice. Before we may tackle the task of building research capacity, we must better understand existing education practices and the challenges for research teaching faced. This paper offers preliminary observations from the audit, based on a survey of undergraduate and masters qualifying social work programmes across all four countries, with in-depth enquiry into a smaller sample from each. The survey examines what research methods are taught, how, where, when and by whom. Most importantly, it considers why these choices are made, and the challenges and possibilities presented for building research capacity and research mindedness at qualifying level...|$|R
40|$|In grid networks, {{distributed}} {{resources are}} interconnected by {{wide area network}} to support compute and data-intensive applications, which require reliable and efficient transfer of gigabits (even terabits) of data. Different from best-effort traffic in Internet, bulk data transfer in grid requires bandwidth <b>reservation</b> as a <b>fundamental</b> service. Existing <b>reservation</b> schemes such as RSVP are designed for real-time traffic specified by reservation rate, transfer start time but with unknown lifetime. In comparison, bulk data transfer requests are {{defined in terms of}} volume and deadline, which provide more information, and allow more flexibility in reservation schemes, i. e., transfer start time can be flexibly chosen, and reservation for a single request can be divided into multiple intervals with different reservation rates. We define a flexible reservation framework using time-rate function algebra, and identify a series of practical reservation scheme families with increasing generality and potential performance, namely, FixTime-FixRate, FixTime-FlexRate, FlexTime-FlexRate, and Multi-Interval. Simple heuristics are used to select representative scheme from each family for performance comparison. Simulation results show that the increasing flexibility can potentially improve system performance, minimizing both blocking probability and mean flow time. We also discuss the distributed implementation of proposed framework...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{examines}} wage {{requirements of}} recipients of Unemployment Benefit II (ALG II), taking up former evaluations by Christensen on wage {{demands of the}} unemployed in Germany. Unlike Christensen, we did not base our analyses on the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP). Instead, we used the cross-sectional data provided by the Institute for Employment Research (IAB) in a survey focused on the living conditions and social security aspects ('Lebenssituation und soziale Sicherung') of recipients of ALG II, carried out {{at an early stage}} after the reform of unemployment benefit and social assistance in Germany. We were especially interested in finding out whether the unemployed have become more prepared to reduce their wage demands since the introduction of the German Social Code II (SGB II) compared to the period up to 2000 (cf. Christensen). To do so, we particularly investigated the ratio between wages paid before unemployment and reservation wages, the dependency of this ratio on the duration of unemployment as well as the factors determining the reservation wage level. Analyses of the most recent IAB survey of ALG II recipients demonstrate that the preparedness to accept lower wages has not (yet) increased significantly since the introduction of SGB II. Descriptive results show that the reservation wage level tends to be independent of the recipient's current employment status. Instead, the wage level demanded is rather determined by whether the recipient lives on his or her own or in a multiparty household. The indicated reservation wage level increases with the number of children in the household. Taking the Reservation Wage Ratio (RWR) as a basis as in Christensen's study, it emerges that respondents state they are prepared to accept employment only on provision of a net hourly wage rate increase of 13 % on average compared to that previous to unemployment. Another outcome is that the RWR does not decrease in line with the duration of unemployment. Recipients' personal circumstances are also <b>fundamental</b> to the <b>reservation</b> wage level in the multivariate estimations, the wage received before unemployment being the most significant indicator. The present results must be considered preliminary for two reasons: firstly, there is still potential for more detail in the multivariate analyses. Secondly, due to initial difficulties in implementing the new SGB II-based legislation {{on the part of the}} responsible bodies, it is unlikely that the available data as yet fully reflect the impacts of the reform, in particular with respect to indications on reservation wages. Ultimately, we will only be in a position to learn more about the preparedness of ALG II recipients to reduce wage requirements when we have access to data on the issues in focus over a sequence of several years, which is planned by the IAB.
