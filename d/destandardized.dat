40|$|Reliable {{estimation}} of rainfall distribution in mountainous regions poses {{a great challenge}} not only due to highly undulating surface terrain and complex relationships between land elevation and precipitation, but also due to non-availability of abundant rainfall measurement points. Prediction of rainfall variability over mountainous islands is a logical step towards meaningful land use planning and water resources zoning. In this context, geostatistical techniques were developed for mapping the rainfall variability over the island of St. Lucia in the Caribbean, using the elevation information extracted from a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and long-term mean monthly rainfall (MMR) data of 40 raingauge stations spread over 616 km 2. The ordinary co-kriging (OCK) and collocated co-kriging (CCK) methods of interpolation were applied for the standardized rainfall depths associated with elevation, as the primary variate, and the surface elevation values as the secondary variate. The best semivariogram model algorithm generated, using either of the above co-kriging (CK) methods, was used to predict standardized values for the elevation points extracted from the DEM for which the rainfall depths were not known. The predicted values were further <b>destandardized</b> to generate the rainfall depth at the unmeasured locations. Ordinary kriging (OK) was then performed for the <b>destandardized</b> and observed rainfall depths to generate the prediction map of MMR over the entire island. These sequential steps were repeated for the MMR data of all twelve months to generate rainfall prediction maps over the island. The spherical semivariogram model fit well (0. 84 < R 2 < 0. 98) for both the OCK and OK methods. The cross-validation error statistics of OCK presented in terms of coefficient of determination (R 2), kriged {{root mean square error}} (KRMSE), and kriged average error (KAE) were within the ++acceptable limits (KAE close to zero, R 2 close to one, and KRMSE from 0. 55 to 1. 45 for 40 raingauge locations) for most of the months. The exploratory data analysis, variogram model fitting, and generation of MMR prediction map through kriging were accomplished through use of ArcGIS and GS+ software...|$|E
40|$|Customs is one domain {{which has}} faced {{the need for}} {{information}} systems in a globalizing world. In customs {{there is a need}} for close collaboration between business and government in order to build robust technological infrastructures supporting processes related to export and import of goods. This has led to a move towards eCustoms. This case study reports from a longitudinal study of a Danish exporter which has faced the challenges of implementing eCustoms in its daily operations. The introduction of eCustoms to replace the existing customs infrastructure based on the Single Administrative Document (SAD) has led to new challenges for the Danish exporter such as <b>destandardized</b> procedures and increased reporting. The particular contribution of the study is the observed longing to the “good old paper-based days ” where things were more standardized than after the digitalization of the processes. The study is interpreted through the lens of “double infrastructures”. The underlying assumption guiding the study is that eCustoms represents one infrastructure on top of another well established infrastructure of global trade...|$|E
40|$|One key {{debate within}} the {{sociology}} of aging and the life course {{over the past decade}} has been focused on understanding the extent to which there has been a shift from a reliance on chronological age to segment the life course and ascertain age-specific norms, values, and expectations toward a <b>destandardized</b> life course in advanced economies. In this, little attention has been devoted to the infrastructural processes that would support such a transition: the technologies, standards, and conventions that would, in practice, equip a personalized, individualized management of the life course. This article focuses on one of such standards, “biological age” (BA), and the 40 -year controversy around the method and purpose of its measurement. Drawing on published research and archival and interview data collected in Europe and North America, the article suggests that the persistent uncertainty surrounding BA measurements is structured by differing interlocking relationships between normative ideals of the life course and methodological approaches to knowledge making to understand and manage the relationship among aging, health, and illness. Understanding this controversy and the configuration of normative and epistemic conventions that underpin its dynamic provides a unique lens on the complex interweaving relationship between expertise, scientific and technological standards, and social, normatively embedded age identities in contemporary societies...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} research studies the housing behavior {{of young adults}} within a post-Fordist society. More specifically, it discusses the way young adults build up their housing career within the current society and how the post-Fordist context influences their housing behavior. Therefore, the research takes place on two different levels, namely the macro-social or societal level {{on the one hand}} and the level of the households on the other hand. Nevertheless, both levels interact constantly. Individual activities are always influenced by the society in which they take place, but conversely, a society can only exist when individual activities take place within a certain time and space. The purpose of this research is thus twofold. First of all, it investigates in what way the current societal developments shape the housing careers of young adults. Besides, it also examines the way in which the housing careers of young adults influence the society in which they take place and in what way they design the urban space. To reach these goals, the research starts by investigating in what way the Belgian society evolved from a Fordist to a post-Fordist society. Next, it continues by looking into detail to the developments that took place during the last decennia of post-Fordism. Specific attention is given to the evolution of migration dynamics and housing preferences since the beginning of the 1990 s. In general, one can conclude that since the end of the Second World War, a shift took place from a standardized and stable society which was characterized by a period of economic growth in which the family took a central position to a <b>destandardized,</b> flexible, diverse and individualistic society. Besides, the results show that until the first half of the 1990 s, housing choices were strongly related to the economical status of a certain period. Phases of economical growth went hand in hand with a reinforced suburbanization movement while this last process weakens during periods of economical recession. Nevertheless, from the second half of the 1990 s, this relationship doesnt coincide any more. Since then, suburbanization and urban interest seem to go hand in hand. But there where the city centre is especially attractive by the youngest young adults and non-Belgian population groups, the opposite is true for the suburban zones. Especially native (middle class) persons of 35 years and older opt for an suburban living environment. Remarkable to this last process is the increasing interest in the urban fringe and the commuter catchment zone instead of the classical suburbs as place of arrival. Empirical research to the individual housing behavior of middle class young adults show that the preferences concerning the housing type are very similar to that of their parents. The final goal is still the purchase of a single family dwelling with a private garden wich keeps on being encouraged by the government. As far as the preferred region concerns, the longer the more young adults seem to appreciate an urban living environment. But as the pursuit of the desired housing type is esteemed more important than the region where one will end up, lots of young adults exchange the city for the suburbs because of the lack (and thus the very high prices) of their preferred housing type within the city. This way, even today, suburbanization processes keep on going constantly. Nevertheless, even middle class young adults cannot afford a house in the oldest, classical but residential suburban areas anymore. Therefore, they are forced to go and look for alternative living environments or ways of living. This results in the rise of several housing strategies like second-hand suburbanization and suburbanization on a longer distance of town. Yet, the increased attractiveness of the city centre on young adults and non-Belgians, leads also to the shooting up of prices in these areas, especially in the very popular gentrification neighborhoods. Therefore, the latter region is spatially expanding in the direction of the cheaper urban working class areas which results in the rise of a so-called tension zones where middle class young adults start taking in the houses of the original but generally poorer inhabitants. As a consequence, the latter population group gets more and more excluded from its original home base and is forced to move to cheaper but often rather problematic neighborhoods. Looking to the social-economic profile of the young adults, the research shows that especially those groups which are typical for and clearly rising in number during the post-Fordist period, experience most difficulties. In general, we have to conclude that the mentality of young adults as well as the urban policies and the offer on the housing markets are still very Fordist of nature. At the same time, on the demographical, economical and socio-cultural level, society clearly evolves in a post-Fordist way. Building up an independent housing career in such an unbalanced society is not obvious. Nevertheless, the tensions resulting from this imbalance will finally force both the young adults as the policy makers and the housing market to adjust their behavior and offer according to the current needs. status: publishe...|$|E
