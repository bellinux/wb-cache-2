5|$|The Joker has {{undergone}} many revisions since his 1940 debut. The most common {{interpretation of the}} character {{is that he is}} disguised as the criminal Red <b>Hood,</b> <b>and</b> pursued by Batman. The Joker falls into a vat of chemicals which bleaches his skin, colors his hair green and his lips red, and drives him insane. The reasons why the Joker was disguised as the Red <b>Hood,</b> <b>and</b> his identity before his transformation have changed over time.|$|E

Common folkloric beings include pixies, giants, elves, bogeymen, trolls, goblins and dwarves.

5|$|In 1793, {{the church}} was rebuilt with a west tower, 3-bay nave and south porch, in squared and coursed lias with red brick and Hamstone dressings. The attempt at total {{rebuilding}} ended in failure to collect enough money, despite donations from William Pitt the Younger and Admiral <b>Hood,</b> <b>and</b> a church for the community was built instead {{at the foot of}} the hill (Burrowbridge) in 1838. In the mid 20th century the ruin on Burrow Mump underwent some repairs to the north west corner.|$|E
5|$|Leaders' ideological {{power was}} based on {{apparent}} access to deities and the supernatural. Evidence regarding Norte Chico religion is limited: {{an image of the}} Staff God, a leering figure with a <b>hood</b> <b>and</b> fangs, has been found on a gourd dated to 2250 BC. The Staff God is a major deity of later Andean cultures, and Winifred Creamer suggests the find points to worship of common symbols of gods. As with much other research at Norte Chico, the nature and significance of the find has been disputed by other researchers.|$|E
5|$|Mrs. Tittlemouse {{actually}} made her debut in 1909 in Potter's The Tale of The Flopsy Bunnies where she rescued the six children of Benjamin and Flopsy Bunny from Mr. McGregor's grasp and was rewarded for her heroism with {{a quantity of}} rabbit wool at Christmas. In the last illustration, {{she is wearing a}} cloak and <b>hood,</b> <b>and</b> a muff and mittens fashioned from the wool. Mrs. Tittlemouse is a key (not a central) character in the tale, but a character incompletely personified, and one whose story Potter chose to develop in 1910.|$|E

5|$|The Joker {{was one of}} the few popular villains {{continuing}} to appear regularly in Batman comics from the Golden Age into the Silver Age, as the series continued during the rise in popularity of mystery and romance comics. In 1951, Finger wrote an origin story for the Joker in Detective Comics #168, which introduced the characteristic of him formerly being the criminal Red <b>Hood,</b> <b>and</b> his disfigurement the result of a fall into a chemical vat.|$|E
5|$|The {{amount of}} time it {{typically}} takes a piercing to heal varies widely according to the placement of the piercing. Genital piercings can be among the quicker to heal, with piercings of the clitoral <b>hood</b> <b>and</b> Prince Albert piercings healing in as little as a month, though some may take longer. Navel piercings can be the slowest to heal, with one source reporting a range of six months to two full years. The prolonged healing of navel piercings may be connected to clothing friction.|$|E

5|$|The {{clitoral}} hood {{projects at}} the front of the labia commissure, where the edges of the labia majora (outer lips) meet at the base of the pubic mound; it forms as part of the external folds of the labia minora (inner lips) and covers the glans and external shaft. There is considerable variation in how much of the glans protrudes from the <b>hood</b> <b>and</b> how much is covered by it, ranging from completely covered to fully exposed, and tissue of the labia minora also encircles the base of the glans.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} mostly shot in Australia and New Zealand, with Canada also {{serving as a}} location. Filming took place from January to May 2008. Production and {{post-production}} were troubled, with delays due to the weather and Jackman's other commitments, an incomplete screenplay that was still being written in Los Angeles while principal photography rolled in Australia, conflicts arising between director <b>Hood</b> <b>and</b> Fox's executives, and an unfinished workprint being leaked on the Internet one month before the film's debut.|$|E

5|$|Adrienne {{visits the}} nearly 110-year-old Malcolm Wyrmshadow (Douglas Seale), {{who had been}} Carno's {{apprentice}} as a young boy. Malcolm reveals that Carno met his demise after his last wife, Marie (Traci Clauson), discovered he was a murderer. Marie conspired with her lover, Gaston (Jeff Rector), to kill Carno by sabotaging the equipment for his most infamous and dangerous escapology trick, in which Carno dons a burning <b>hood</b> <b>and</b> escapes from bonds on a throne underneath a swinging axe. The sabotage leaves Carno horribly burned and disfigured, but he survives and viciously attacks Marie and Gaston. After killing Marie by beheading her, Carno is killed by Gaston, who then succumbs to his own wounds.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of Atlanta in September 1864, President Davis {{considered}} replacing John Bell Hood {{in command of the}} Army of Tennessee and he asked Robert E. Lee to find out if Beauregard would be interested. Beauregard was indeed interested, but it is unclear whether Davis seriously considered the appointment, and in the end decided to retain Hood. Davis met with Beauregard in Augusta, Georgia, on October 2 and offered him command of the newly created Department of the West, responsible for the five Southern states from Georgia to the Mississippi River, with the armies of <b>Hood</b> <b>and</b> Richard Taylor under his ostensible command. However, it was a thankless job that was limited to logistical and advisory responsibilities, without true operational control of the armies unless he should join them in person during an emergency. Nevertheless, anxious to return to the field, he accepted the assignment.|$|E
5|$|American Pharoah {{made his}} track debut in a maiden race over {{six and a}} half furlongs on the Polytrack surface at Del Mar Racetrack on August9. Ridden by Martin Garcia, he started as the 7–5 {{favorite}} against eight opponents. He became unsettled before the race and, after running in second place until the stretch, faded to finish fifth behind Om, Iron Fist, One Lucky Dane, and Calculator, more than nine lengths behind the winner. He ran in a blinker hood, which appeared to unnerve him, as did the commotion in the saddling paddock. Baffert addressed his anxiety issues by removing the <b>hood</b> <b>and</b> stuffing cotton in the horse's ears for subsequent races.|$|E
