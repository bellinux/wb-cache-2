"Well," [...] he said, [...] "Ray {{told me the}} old feller <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> as if {{he thought}} he'd done a damn silly thing {{to give him a}} waggon; and he nodded his old head, and said, laughin' in his beard: 'Wish you good luck, brother, with your stone.' You couldn't humbug that old Boer; he knew one stone was the same as another." ...|$|E

Some fellers, Rosey," [...] said Nott, with a cunning smile, [...] "would hev blurted out a big figger and been cotched. That ain't my style.

6000|$|He spoke so seriously, so earnestly, {{with such}} depth of {{personal}} feeling, that Trevennack, starting back, stood {{and gazed at}} him slowly with those terrible eyes, like one who awakens by degrees from a painful dream to some awful reality. Tyrrel winced before his scrutiny. For a moment the elder man <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> and stared. Then he took one step forward. [...] "Sir," [...] he said, in a very low voice, half broken with emotion, [...] "I had a dear son of my own once; a very dear, dear son. He was killed by such an ACCIDENT on this very spot. No wonder I remember it." ...|$|E

That is what I {{like in a}} woman. Such a courage! She never flinched in those horrid days, never. And when he called her--you know what--she only looked at him, <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> miserable object. Oh, it was beautiful!" [...] And Madame Gordeloup, rising in her energy from her seat for the purpose, strove to throw upon Harry such another glance as the injured, insulted wife had thrown upon her foul-tongued, dying lord.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Your Father <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> and said, 'I {{certainly}} shall {{do nothing}} of the sort. I don't like his politics,' he said. Well, the man--Captain Smith {{they used to call}} him, and heaven only knows why, because he hadn't the shadow or vestige of a right to be called 'Captain' or any other title--this Captain Smith said, 'We'll make it hot for you if you don't stick by your friends, Major.' Well, you know how Your Father was, and this Smith knew it too; he knew what a Real Man he was, and he knew Your Father knew the political situation from A to Z, and he ought to have seen that here was one man he couldn't impose on, but he went on trying to and hinting and trying till Your Father spoke up and said to him, 'Captain Smith,' he said, 'I have a reputation around these parts for being one who is amply qualified to mind his own business and let other folks mind theirs!' and with that he drove on and left the fellow standing there in the road like a bump on a log!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, he isn't frightened now, yet <b>just</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> go," [...] {{retorted}} Jimmy. [...] "Says {{he has got}} {{a beautiful}} voice, {{and that he has}} {{to take part in the}} spring chorus at the Smiling Pool and that he is late." ...|$|R

6000|$|She put {{her face}} close to his. Her eyes troubled him, but he drew back. He {{thought she would}} be {{offended}} or persistent, but she was neither; <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> fixedly with a curious inquiring stare; and {{he leaned against the}} window, deeply disturbed. It was as if all clear and simple enthusiasm had been suddenly knocked endways; as if a certain splendour of life that he had felt and seen of late had been dipped in cloud. Out there at the front, over here in hospital, life had been seeming so--as it were--heroic; and yet it held such mean and murky depths as well! The voices of his men, whom he had come to love like brothers, crude burring voices, cheery in trouble, making nothing of it; the voices of doctors and nurses, patient, quiet, reassuring voices; even his own voice, infected by it all, kept sounding in his ears. All wonderful somehow, and simple; and nothing mean about it anywhere! And now so suddenly to have lighted upon this, and all that was behind it--this scared girl, this base, dark, thoughtless use of her! And the thought came to him: [...] "I suppose my fellows wouldn't think twice about taking her on! Why! I'm not even certain of myself, if she insists!" [...] And he turned his face, and stared out at the moonlight. He heard her voice: ...|$|E
5000|$|Sinsel later commented {{about his}} writing session with Stanley, calling him, [...] "one {{of the biggest}} egomaniacs I have ever come across in my career. He was rude and disrespectful and at some point, I'm playing (TKO's) [...] "Kill the Pain" [...] while we're warming up. So, he says, [...] "I'm going to start playing some stuff and you just {{tell me if you}} hear anything". What came out of it was just [...] "Kill the Pain" [...] backwards. At some point he goes, [...] "how about in this part we do blah, blah, blah" [...] and it was off of Love Gun. By now I've had enough of his remarks and I <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> and said, [...] "look, it's not like I'm like Tommy (McMullin)" [...] and he says, [...] "what do you mean?" [...] and I said, [...] "it's not like I own a KISS doll, or something." ...|$|E
5000|$|I {{was called}} to Vietnam 1968 from the Middle East…While I as in Spain route, I bought some Joan Baez records. I went to my room in the Bachelor Officer’s Quarters to listen to them…There {{was a knock on}} the door. It was an {{individual}} in civilian clothes. He asked me my name and rank. I <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> I was then a major Army.He asked, “Are those Joan Baez records?”I said, “Yeah”.He said, “She’s like anti-military…”He then identified himself. He was a one-star brigadier general. He outranked me by far.He said, “You a fan Joan Baez?”I said, “How many records do you have to have to be a fan?”He said, “I guess three.”I said, “I guess I’m a fan. I’ve got five.”He said, “You have to get rid of the records or leave the building.”I couldn’t believe it.I said, “I can’t play the music I want, music that was made in the USA?”He said, “No, you’ll have to leave the building. That’s anti-military music.” She was singing “With God on Our Side”, I think, at the time.I said, “I think I agree with lyrics. I’m not anti-military, and I agree with what she’s singing in her songs.”He said, “You’ll have to leave the building.”I said, “Hey, it’s okay with me.”So he gave me a transfer…I went down to the Hilton Castille in Madrid and I stayed in one of the best rooms they had, and the government had to pick up the tab.|$|E

"Ay, slowly, but I'd {{get on a}} deal faster if that lazy brown-skin Ohoo {{would work}} harder. <b>Just</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> He digs up that bit o' ground {{as if he was}} paid by the number o' minutes he took to do it.

[...] {{cried the}} Major, [...] "he's a man after my own heart. <b>Just</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> running about {{with his hair}} flying in the wind, and the papers bulging from his pockets.

6000|$|... "Of course, I know that," [...] {{returned}} the perplexed husband, [...] "still, I can't help {{thinking about what}} is to be done after he has had the good education. You know I have no relation in the world except brother Richard, who is as poor as myself.

6000|$|... "Say, that fellow's some sport!" [...] {{he remarked}} admiringly. [...] "You wouldn't believe it <b>just</b> to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> That {{staircase}} this afternoon, though, kind of teaches one not to trust to appearances.

6000|$|Jenny Wren <b>looked</b> over <b>at</b> Mr. Wren fondly. [...] "Isn't he a dear to sing {{to me like}} that? And isn't it a {{perfectly}} beautiful spring song?" [...] said she. Then, without waiting for Peter to reply, her tongue rattled on. [...] "I do wish he would be careful. Sometimes I am afraid he will overdo. <b>Just</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> now! He is singing so hard that he is shaking all over. He always is that way. There is one thing true about us Wrens, and this {{is that when we}} do things we do them with all our might.

"Depend on it," [...] {{said the}} top-man, [...] "he must somehow have thought I was making sport of him a while ago, when I was only taking off old Priming, the gunner's mate. <b>Just</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> once, White-Jacket, while I make believe coil this here rope; if there arn't a dozen in that 'ere Captain's top-lights, {{my name is}} horse-marine. If I could only touch my tile to him now, and take my Bible oath on it, that I was only taking off Priming, and not him, he wouldn't have such hard {{thoughts}} of me. But that can't be done; he'd think I meant to insult him. Well, it can't be helped; I suppose I must look out for a baker's dozen afore long." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] said Mrs. Cliff, [...] "I see {{no reason}} why we should not live here in peace and comfort until Mr. Rynders chooses to come back for us. And I have been thinking, captain, that if somebody--and I am sure Ralph would be very good at it--could catch some fish, it would help out very much. We are getting a little short of meat, but as for the other things, we have enough to last for days and days. But we won't talk of that now. We want to hear where that other colored man came from. <b>Just</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> as he sits there with Maka by those embers. One might think he would shiver himself to pieces.

5000|$|The book blends social satire with self-mockery. In a {{classroom}} scene, for example, Enderby {{is unable to}} remember his planned lecture on minor Elizabethan dramatists and so {{on the spur of}} the moment invents a playwright called 'Gervase Whitelady'. He discourses learnedly on this personage for some time, helped on by a student who begins as a know-it-all but ends as a collaborator, earnestly prompting him with the details of Whitelady's life. Enderby abruptly concludes the lecture by dismissing his imaginary playwright as a failure - [...] at which point he recognises his creation as a mirror image of himself. Later, at his poetry-writing class, Enderby finds little to admire in his students' undisciplined effusions and tries to impress on them that poetry arises from craftsmanlike effort, not emotional self-indulgence. The students, however, <b>just</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> pityingly and ask him when he plans to leave.|$|R

I will probably be alone in this, but I did not think we played too rough in Leeuwarden. Before the break we played even soft. They shouldn't be affected so easily up here in the north. They're trying to be more devout than the pope here. Football is a rough game. Cambuur made 36 fouls against PEC Zwolle, we commit 34 against them and they blame us for being rough? Bullshit, football is like war, I said that before and I stand by that. This is a professional sport. Beenhakker can say what he wants, I don't care. He coaches the way he talks: very stupid.

5000|$|Jason Stare and Scott Barber {{are part}} of the touring band. (As an inside joke, John has said that when the Subs play live with some {{computer}} tracks, the band is called The Robots). The Submarines have toured the country and world, sometimes as a duo, and sometimes as a full band. Many shows in the beginning, for the band's first tour, consisted of just Blake and John. For the band's second release, Honeysuckle Weeks, Jason joined to play drums for their live shows. Jason has been the band's live set drummer since the release of Honeysuckle Weeks, and is featured in Apple commercials for the iPhone 3G and iPhone 3GS. He is an artist, a college graduate and is from Long Island, New York. On bringing him on tour, John has stated, [...] "I saw him live and I liked his playing.
