50|$|In {{the sixteenth}} century, the Dutch and the British trading {{companies}} established their trading ships in West Java after the <b>falldown</b> of Sultanate of Banten. For {{the next three}} hundred years, West Java fell under the Dutch East Indies' administration. West Java was officially declared as a province of Indonesia in 1950, referring to a statement from Staatblad number 378. On October 17, 2000, as part of nationwide political decentralization, Banten was separated from West Java and made into a new province. There have been recent proposals to rename the province Pasundan ("Land of the Sundanese") after the historical name for West Java.|$|E
50|$|Many fans then {{questioned}} his management's judgment by letting Reid defend his title against a veteran like Trinidad in only his fifteenth professional bout, {{a fact that}} reminded many of {{the case of the}} second Davey Moore 17 years before, when he defended the same WBA title, in only his thirteenth bout, against the far more experienced, boxing hall of famer Roberto Durán. Many critics say that the reason for Reid's <b>falldown</b> after his defeat to Trinidad could be due to a psychological break-down, {{but the fact is that}} his detached retina affected him for the rest of his short career.|$|E
50|$|According to {{newspaper}} historian (and former NZ Truth journalist) Redmer Yska, English-born Norton was 'a combustible mix of tycoon, journalist, do-gooder and chronic, <b>falldown</b> pisshead.' Norton {{was on hand}} on 24 June 1905 {{when the}} first copies of the 'Maoriland' edition rolled off the presses in Luke's Lane, an alley that still runs {{at right angles to}} Wellington's Courtenay Place. Inaugural editor, Australian Robert Merrick, claimed 40,000 readers by 1907, with circulation in 'every Miners', Gum Diggers' and Timber-Getter's camp'. Three years later Frederick Dawson, a former editor of Norton's Queensland and West Australia editions of Truth took over. He would remain in the job until 1920. Norton meanwhile died of alcoholism, in 1916.|$|E
50|$|The biggest {{professional}} domino show {{company in}} the world is Weijers Domino Productions which was later renamed Weijers DominoDomain.com, the creators of Domino Day. Beside domino builders they employ professional designers, developers and engineers. Their domino shows are used for product introductions, campaign launches, commercial advertisements and team building events.They also invented the so-called Builder's Challenge (BC). It is included in many shows now as an additional attraction (and risk). During the <b>falldown</b> of the dominoes, a builder - or several ones - has to fill in a gap in a line. A certain project (or, rarely, the whole chain) depends on that line, meaning that if the builder fails to complete the challenge in time, the project will not be triggered. BC's have become a very popular discipline among domino-builders.|$|E
50|$|Playing {{at first}} clay court tournament in Stuttgart, Ivanovic reached quarterfinals {{for a second}} {{straight}} year, after two wins against Germans, an easy one over No. 14 Sabine Lisicki and hard-fought against wildcard Julia Görges, rallying from first set blowout where she won just one game. Ivanovic continued to show why is clay her best surface, as she beat two-time Slam champion Svetlana Kuznetsova and former No. 1 and current top 10 player at the moment, compatriot Jelena Janković. Being just one step far from winning blue Porsche prize, Ivanovic started very strong against two-time defending champion Maria Sharapova, as she cruised to 5-0 lead with three breaks. Despite having 40-30, she lost three games before eventually winning first set with 6-3. Breaking first again in second set, she was close to a big lead when having a game point on 3-1, but double fault on that point looked as the key for the <b>falldown</b> which followed it, as she won just two more games to Sharapova's 11. If Ivanovic had won it, {{it would have been}} the first time in her career that she won back-to-back titles, as she won Monterrey Open previously, but however these were even Ivanovic's first back-to-back finals.|$|E

40|$|Press in {{this country}} is joying optimal freedom since the <b>falldown</b> of Soeharto regime. But western-style freedom of the press is echoing {{numerous}} negative impacts. Prominent among those impacts are reports or news that considered defamation. Several libel cases have been brought to the court. Defendants (publishers or chiefeditors) are frequently lost the cases, being nished by imprisonment and/or huge emount of fine, resulting in the outcry of some journalists. The judges are accused of obstructing press freedom, or no apprehension whatsoever on the vital role of the press in democracy...|$|E
40|$|Summary. This {{paper is}} {{addressed}} to methods for {{early detection of}} classifier <b>falldown</b> phenomenon, what gives a possibility to react in advance and avoid making incorrect decisions. For many applications it is very essential that decisions made by machine learning algorithms were as accurate as it is possible. The proposed approach consists in applying a monitoring mechanism only to results of classification, what not cause an additional computational overhead. The empirical evaluation of monitoring method is presented based on data extracted from simulated robotic soccer {{as an example of}} autonomous agent domain and synthetic data that stands for standard industrial application. 1. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} non linear Langevin {{equation}} {{as a model}} for stock market fluctuations and crashes. This equation is based on an identification of the di#erent processes influencing the demand and supply, and their mathematical transcription. We emphasize the importance of feedback e#ects of price variations onto themselves. Risk aversion, in particular, leads to an "up-down" symmetry breaking term which is responsible for crashes, where "panic" is self reinforcing. It is also responsible for the sudden collapse of speculative bubbles. Interestingly, these crashes appear as rare, "activated" events, and have an exponentially small probability of occurence. The model leads to a specific "shape" of the <b>falldown</b> of the price during a crash, which we compare with the October 1987 data. The normal regime, where the stock price exhibits behavior similar to that of a random walk, however reveals non trivial correlations on different time scales, in particular on the time scale over which operato [...] ...|$|E
40|$|A disease {{presumed to}} be caused by Fusarium was {{observed}} in cocoa open fields with few or without shade trees. Within the population of cocoa trees in the field, some trees had died, some had yellowing leaves and dieback, and the others were apparently healthy. In order to demonstrate Fusarium species as the causal pathogen and to obtain information concerning the incidence of the disease, its distribution and its impact on sustainability of cocoa, isolation of the pathogen, inoculation of cocoa seedlings with isolates and a survey of disease has been conducted. Fusarium was isolated from roots and branches, and inoculated onto cocoa seedlings (one month old) via soil. Symptoms appeared within 3 - 4 weeks after infection. These symptoms consisted of yellowing of leaves beginning from the bottom until the leaves <b>falldown,</b> and browning internal of vascular tissue. Darkened vascular traces in the petiole characteristic of vascularstreak dieback infection were absent. The occurrence of Fusarium in the field was characterized by the absence of obvious signs of fungal infestation on root of infected trees, yellowing of leaves on twigs, dieback, and tree mortality in severe infestations. Disease incidence could reach 77 % and in this situation it was difficult for trees recover from heavy infections or to be regenerated in the farm. The study proves that Fusarium is a pathogen causing dieback and the disease is called as Fusarium vascular dieback (FVD). Its development is apparently enhanced by dry conditions in the field.
