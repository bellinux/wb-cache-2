40|$|Steel {{structures}} {{take the}} advantages of good stability, good ductility, low construction cost, fast construction and hence high flexibility in shape with high utilization rate. With the rapid economic growth, steel structures are popularly used in modern architecture, particularly in supertall buildings of height over 300 m in China. However, the fire behaviour of steel structures should be watched because the mechanical strength of steel reduces when temperature increases. In this paper, <b>fire</b> <b>protective</b> coatings commonly used in China for steel structures were studied by full-scale fire tests. Three types of ultra-thin, one type of thin and one type of thick coatings were evaluated. Test samples were prepared by applying the coatings on the typical H-type steel load bearing beams following standard fire resistance test. Different sets of <b>fire</b> <b>protective</b> coatings were applied {{on the surface of}} the sample as in the actual construction process. The coating thickness for the steel structural members met the Chinese regulation with ultra-thin <b>fire</b> <b>protective</b> coating of 2. 00 mm ± 0. 02 mm, thin <b>fire</b> <b>protective</b> coating of 5. 0 mm ± 0. 5 mm and thick <b>fire</b> <b>protective</b> coating of 25 mm ± 2 mm. Experiments were carried out in the large-scale testing facilities at Sichuan Fire Research Institute, Dujiangyan, Sichuan, China. The transient temperatures at different positions inside and outside the steel structure, and structural distortion of the steel structural members with different <b>fire</b> <b>protective</b> coatings under the testing condition were measured. Results on the measured temperatures, middle flexibility change values and corresponding time parameters on related parts of the test samples were then studied. A mathematical model was used for analyzing the result. The associated variables and correlation expressions among different variables were studied. Results can be taken as a reference for drafting new standards on evaluating the <b>fire</b> <b>protective</b> coatings for load bearing steel structures. For example, for the fire test of ultra-thin <b>fire</b> <b>protective</b> coating, it is possible to analyze and generalize the acquired data on temperature-time curve. For the thick-type steel structure <b>fire</b> <b>protective</b> coating, when the maximum temperature of the steel structure approaches 500 oC and there is a high rate of temperature change, the fire resistance period of the structural members with protective coating can be predicted...|$|R

The southern gateway into the Bastille became the principal entrance to the castle in 1553, the other three gateways being closed. A bastion, a large earthwork projecting eastwards from the Bastille, was built to provide additional <b>protective</b> <b>fire</b> for the Bastille and the Arsenal; the bastion was reached from the fortress across a stone abutment using a connecting drawbridge that was installed in the Bastille's Comté tower. In 1573 the Porte Saint-Antoine was also altered – the drawbridges were replaced with a fixed bridge, and the medieval gatehouse was replaced with a triumphal arch.|$|R

40|$|A new {{approach}} to quantify the thermal shrinkage of <b>fire</b> <b>protective</b> clothing after flash fire exposure Min Wang 1, 2, 3, Xiaohui Li 1, 2, 3, Jun Li 1, 2, 3 and Bugao Xu 4 <b>Fire</b> <b>protective</b> clothing made of inherent flame resistant materials shrinks easily when exposed to flash fire. This thermally induced shrinkage affects the thermal protective performance. Methods to evaluate the thermal shrinkage of <b>fire</b> <b>protective</b> garments are under development and there are currently no documentary standards available. The aim {{of this paper is}} to provide an effective method to accurately determine the shrinkage magnitude of <b>fire</b> <b>protective</b> clothing after flash fire exposure. This method involved a portable three-dimensional (3 D) body scanner that could be mounted into the flame chamber to capture the 3 D images of the nude and clothed manikin immediately before and after exposure. Based on the advanced post-processing techniques, the 3 D images of the clothed manikin pre- and post-exposure were compared, and thermal shrinkage of the garment was characterized by three parameters, namely garment surface area change and volume and thickness change of the air layers entrapped between the manikin and garment. This method was supposed to provide basic knowledge for the quantitative research into the effect of thermal shrinkage o...|$|R
