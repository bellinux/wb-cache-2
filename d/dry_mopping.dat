40|$|Acute {{otitis media}} (AOM) is {{diagnosed}} {{on the basis}} of acute onset of pain and fever; a red, bulging tympanic membrane; and middle ear effusion. AOM is managed with analgesia (paracetamol or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). Antibiotic therapy is minimally effective for most patients; it is most effective for children 3 ̆c 2 years with bilateral otitis media and for children with discharging ears. National guidelines recommend antibiotic therapy for Indigenous children with AOM. Evidence for corticosteroids, topical analgesia and xylitol are scant. Otitis media with effusion (OME) is diagnosed as the presence of middle ear effusion (type B tympanogram or immobile tympanic membrane on pneumatic otoscopy) without AOM criteria. Well children with OME with no speech and language delays can be observed for the first 3 months; perform audiological evaluation and refer to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist if they have bilateral hearing impairment 3 ̆e 30 dB or persistent effusion. Children with effusions persisting longer than 3 months can benefit from a 2 – 4 -week course of amoxycillin. Chronic suppurative otitis media is a chronic discharge through a tympanic membrane perforation. It is managed with regular ear cleaning (<b>dry</b> <b>mopping</b> or povidone–iodine [Betadine] washouts) until discharge resolves; topical ear drops (eg, ciprofloxacin); audiological evaluation; and ENT review...|$|E
50|$|Single-use <b>dry</b> <b>mops</b> {{are also}} {{available}} and widely sold.|$|R
50|$|The <b>dry</b> <b>mop</b> can in many {{instances}} replace a broom and {{has the ability to}} hold a limited amount of dust or sand within itself. The heads of <b>dry</b> <b>mops</b> are often removable and can be washed and replaced when saturated with dust. Another option is using a vacuum cleaner to suck surface dust away from the mop; however, this is much more limited in its effectiveness.|$|R
50|$|A <b>dry</b> <b>mop</b> or dust mop is {{designed}} to pick up dry, loose contamination such as dust, earth, and sand {{from the surface of}} the floor. It consists of yarn and/or microfiber and is used as a first step in cleaning a floor.Professional <b>dry</b> <b>mops</b> consist of a flat sheet of microfiber textile or sheets with a surface of looped yarn, usually about 15 cm wide, and comes in variable lengths (usually 30 - 100 cm).|$|R
5000|$|Professional flat mops {{are made}} for pre-moisting. Mops are pre-impregnated with an ideal amount of water mixed with an {{appropriate}} amount of detergent. This means that the cleaner {{does not need to}} bring any additional water on the cleaning trolley. This ideal amount is often recommended by the manufacturer in terms of weight percent of water per weight of the <b>dry</b> <b>mop,</b> for example [...] "175% water per weight of the dry mop".|$|R
40|$|A {{new system}} for {{sanitizing}} floors in hospital patient rooms has been developed. The method consists of dry dusting with a cotton-blend, chemically treated (10 % by <b>dry</b> <b>mop</b> weight) dust mop. This method was {{compared with a}} conventional cleaning protocol consisting of an initial predusting with the same nongermicidal chemical (3 % by <b>dry</b> <b>mop</b> weight) followed by wet mopping with a fresh solution of a quaternary ammonium disinfectant-detergent. Each of six rooms was sampled by using RODAC plates (Becton Dickinson Labware, Oxnard, Calif.) on 10 consecutive days {{for each of the}} two methods. The study was initially performed during the summer and then repeated during the winter. Results imply that there is {{no significant difference between the}} new dry method (81. 9 % CFU reduction) and the conventional method (83. 1 % CFU reduction). Furthermore, the initial dry dusting step in the conventional method accounted for virtually all of the reduction by that method. Thus, wet mopping with a germicidal chemical produced no additional significant reduction of natural microbial populations on environmental surfaces beyond that achieved by dry dusting with dust-suppressant chemicals...|$|R
40|$|We have {{evaluated}} {{the need for}} daily disinfection of environmental surfaces not contaminated by biological fluids, in patient areas of a medical unit with two wings [North (N) and South (S) ] at the University Hospitals of Geneva, Switzerland. Weekly bacteriological monitoring of surfaces was carried out at random (N = 1356 samples). In the S wing (control), we used detergent/disinfectant for daily cleaning of the floors and furniture. In the N wing we began by using a detergent for floors and furniture; after four weeks the results suggested changing to a rotation of detergent, dust attracting disposable <b>dry</b> <b>mops</b> and disinfectant. During this period the furniture was cleaned with an active oxygen-based compound. The average differences in contamination before and after cleaning floors were (mean reduction in bacterial counts and 95 % confidence intervals; CI 95) : disposable mops: 92. 7 cfu/ 24 cm 2 (CI 95; 74 - 112), active oxygen based compound 111. 1 (90 - 133), and quaternary ammonium compound - 0. 6 (- 27 - 26). Use of detergent alone {{was associated with a}} significant increase in bacterial colony counts: on average by 103. 6 cfu (CI 95 73 - 134). The quaternary ammonium compound was inadequate for disinfecting bathrooms and toilets but the active oxygen based compound was satisfactory. For furniture, there was a significant reduction in bacterial counts with both the methods using disinfectants. As the detergent was contaminated, by using it alone for cleaning, we were actually seeding surfaces with bacteria. A total of 1117 patients was studied and we observed no change in the incidence of nosocomial infections during the four months of the trial. In conclusion, uncontrolled routine disinfection of environmental surfaces does not necessarily make it safe for the patient and could seed the environment with potential pathogens...|$|R
40|$|High indoor {{humidity}} {{not only}} causes degradation of building materials but also thermal discomfort, increased energy use for air-conditioning and it promotes mould growth. Mitigation of indoor moisture problems requires {{the ability to}} predict the humidity levels that may prevail in indoor spaces, which in turn requires knowledge about the moisture generation rates of indoor sources. There was, however, a lack of such data for various moisture generating activities in Chinese households. This paper {{presents the results of}} surveys and experiments conducted recently to obtain data on the intensities of moisture generation for various household activities, including cooking, bathing, washing clothes and drying, dishwashing and <b>drying,</b> floor <b>mopping</b> and indoor planting. On the basis of the survey and measurement results, moisture generation profiles for typical kitchens, bathrooms, living and dining rooms, and bedrooms have been established for use in inter-zone moisture movement and indoor humidity level predictions for typical residential units in Hong Kong. The models derived for predicting moisture release rates from drying clothes and bathroom air moisture content during shower baths are presented. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R
