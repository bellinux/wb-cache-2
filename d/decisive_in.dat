5|$|Both {{teams were}} evenly matched, with the West Indies not the force they had been, and England on the rise. The key players for the West Indies were Lara, Walsh and Bishop while England {{had a strong}} opening pair of Atherton and Graham Thorpe plus the young Dominic Cork who would be <b>decisive</b> <b>in</b> England's two Test {{victories}} in this series.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the heavy}} losses Tigranes suffered, {{the battle was}} not <b>decisive</b> <b>in</b> ending the war. In {{retreating}} northwards, Tigranes and Mithridates were able to elude Lucullus' forces, though losing again against the Romans {{during the battle of}} Artashat. In 68, Lucullus' forces' began to mutiny, longing to return home, and he withdrew his forces from Armenia the following year.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of the Chesapeake, {{also known}} as the Battle of the Virginia Capes or simply the Battle of the Capes, was a crucial naval battle in the American Revolutionary War that took place near the mouth of Chesapeake Bay on 5 September 1781. The combatants were a British fleet led by Rear Admiral Sir Thomas Graves and a French fleet led by Rear Admiral Francois Joseph Paul, the Comte de Grasse. The battle was {{strategically}} <b>decisive,</b> <b>in</b> that it prevented the Royal Navy from reinforcing or evacuating the forces of Lieutenant General Lord Cornwallis at Yorktown, Virginia. The French were able to achieve control of the sea lanes against the British, allowing them to provide the Franco-American army with siege artillery and French reinforcements—all of which proved <b>decisive</b> <b>in</b> the Siege of Yorktown, effectively securing independence for the Thirteen Colonies.|$|E
5|$|The Petén Basin covers an {{area that}} is now part of Guatemala; in colonial times it {{originally}} fell {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Governor of Yucatán, before being transferred to the jurisdiction of the Audiencia Real of Guatemala in 1703. The Contact Period in the Petén lowlands lasted from 1525 through to 1700. Superior Spanish weaponry and the use of cavalry, although <b>decisive</b> <b>in</b> the northern Yucatán, were ill-suited to warfare in the dense forests of lowland Petén.|$|E

5|$|The three ironclad ships {{selected}} differed {{substantially in}} design and degree of risk. Monitor was the most innovative design {{by virtue of its}} low freeboard, shallow-draft iron hull, and total dependence on steam power. The riskiest element of its design was its rotating gun turret, something that had not previously been tested by any navy. Ericsson's guarantee of delivery in 100 days proved to be <b>decisive</b> <b>in</b> choosing his design despite the risk involved.|$|E
5|$|A lack of {{knowledge}} about the capability of radar to create an effective centralized early warning system also contributed to the over-reliance on the self-defense capabilities of bombers. However Hansell also argued that ignorance of radar was fortuitous in the long run. He surmised that had radar been a factor in making doctrine, many theorists would have reasoned that massed defenses would make all strategic air attacks too costly, inhibiting if not entirely suppressing the concepts that proved <b>decisive</b> <b>in</b> World War II and essential {{to the creation of the}} United States Air Force.|$|E
5|$|After Euro 2004, Juventus manager Marcello Lippi was {{replaced}} by Fabio Capello. Capello was not convinced of Del Piero's fitness levels, and frequently benched him in favour of the younger, new offensive signing Zlatan Ibrahimović. Despite his limited playing time, Del Piero still managed to score 14 goals as Juventus won their 28th league title, due to his overhead assist to teammate David Trezeguet, which proved <b>decisive</b> <b>in</b> a match against Milan at the San Siro. Del Piero also helped Juventus to reach the quarter finals of the UEFA Champions League that season, only losing out to eventual champions Liverpool.|$|E

5|$|Its primary {{task was}} to protect convoys from the German Kriegsmarines U-boat force. It also {{protected}} Allied shipping from the aerial threat posed by the Luftwaffe. The main operations of Coastal Command were defensive, defending supplies lines in the various theatres of war, most notably the Mediterranean, Middle East and African theatres and {{the battle of the}} Atlantic. It also served in an offensive capacity. In the Mediterranean theatre and the Baltic sea it carried out attacks on German shipping moving war materials from Italy to North Africa and from Scandinavia to Germany. By 1943 Coastal Command finally received the recognition it needed and its operations proved <b>decisive</b> <b>in</b> the victory over the U-boats.|$|E
5|$|The Ipsos Pulse of the People survey {{undertaken}} in October and November 2013 {{showed that a}} number of provinces would be closely contested. The ANC will continue to dominate in the Eastern Cape, Limpopo, North West, Mpumalanga, KwaZulu-Natal and Free State. The DA will keep the Western Cape while control of the Northern Cape and Gauteng will be contested between the ANC and DA, with other parties holding the balance of power, so coalitions may be <b>decisive.</b> <b>In</b> Limpopo and North West the EFF could become the official opposition.|$|E
5|$|The result {{confirmed}} the worries of some, including Spaak, {{that the vote}} would not be sufficiently <b>decisive</b> <b>in</b> either direction and could divide the country along regional and linguistic lines. On 13 March, Eyskens traveled to Pregny to attempt to encourage Leopold to abdicate. Paul Van Zeeland and Spaak attempted to broker a new agreement by which Leopold would abdicate in favour of his son. On 15 April 1950, Leopold {{announced that he was}} willing to temporarily delegate his authority. Many within the PSC–CVP realised that, despite the referendum's result, their party's lack of a parliamentary majority would undermine their ability to build a national reconciliation around the King as long as their Liberal coalition partners and Socialist opponents were unwilling to accept the King's return.|$|E

5|$|World War I was {{the most}} devastating in British {{military}} history, with nearly 800,000 men killed and over twomillion wounded. Early in the war, the BEF was virtually destroyed and was replaced first by volunteers and then a conscript force. Major battles included those at the Somme and Passchendaele. Advances in technology saw {{the advent of the}} tank (and the creation of the Royal Tank Regiment) and advances in aircraft design (including the creation of the Royal Flying Corps) which would be <b>decisive</b> <b>in</b> future battles. Trench warfare dominated Western Front strategy for most of the war, and the use of chemical weapons (disabling and poison gases) added to the devastation.|$|E
5|$|Aware of his {{physical}} limitations, Messi employed {{a personal trainer}} to increase his muscle mass, returning to the squad in improved condition {{in time for the}} World Youth Championship, hosted by the Netherlands in June 2005. After he was left out of the starting line-up in their first match against the United States, a 1–0 defeat, the squad's senior players asked manager Francisco Ferraro to let Messi start, as they considered him their best player. After helping the team defeat Egypt and Germany to progress past the group stage, Messi proved <b>decisive</b> <b>in</b> the knockout phase as he scored their equaliser against Colombia, provided a goal and an assist against title favourites Spain, and scored their opening goal against reigning champions Brazil. Ahead of the final, he was awarded the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament. He scored two penalties in their 2–1 victory over Nigeria, clinching Argentina's fifth championship and finishing the tournament as top scorer with 6 goals. His performances drew comparisons with compatriot Diego Maradona, who had led Argentina to the title in 1979.|$|E
5|$|Bruce missed {{several weeks}} of the 1991–92 season when he {{underwent}} an operation on a longstanding hernia problem, in which Leeds United, after a season-long tussle, beat Manchester United to the championship by four points. Bruce helped United win their first-ever League Cup in April 1992, captaining the team in the final {{in place of the}} injured Bryan Robson. Injuries continued to take their toll upon Robson during the 1992–93 season, leading to Bruce captaining the team in the majority of United's matches during the first season of the new Premier League. Bruce scored two late goals in a win over Sheffield Wednesday which proved <b>decisive</b> <b>in</b> United winning the inaugural Premier League title, the first time the club had won the championship of English football since 1967, and he and Robson received the trophy jointly after the home victory over Blackburn Rovers on 3 May.|$|E

5|$|During the American Civil War (18611865), cavalry {{held the}} most {{important}} and respected role it would ever hold in the American military. Field artillery in the American Civil War was also highly mobile. Both horses and mules pulled the guns, though only horses were used on the battlefield. At the beginning of the war, most of the experienced cavalry officers were from the South and thus joined the Confederacy, leading to the Confederate Army's initial battlefield superiority. The tide turned at the 1863 Battle of Brandy Station, part of the Gettysburg campaign, where the Union cavalry, in the largest cavalry battle ever fought on the American continent, ended the dominance of the South. By 1865, Union cavalry were <b>decisive</b> <b>in</b> achieving victory. So important were horses to individual soldiers that the surrender terms at Appomattox allowed every Confederate cavalryman to take his horse home with him. This was because, unlike their Union counterparts, Confederate cavalrymen provided their own horses for service instead of drawing them from the government.|$|E
5|$|In Guatemala the Spanish {{routinely}} fielded indigenous allies; {{at first}} these were Nahua {{brought from the}} recently conquered Mexico, later they also included Maya. It is estimated that for every Spaniard {{on the field of}} battle, there were at least 10 native auxiliaries. Sometimes there were as many as 30 indigenous warriors for every Spaniard, and it was the participation of these Mesoamerican allies that was particularly <b>decisive.</b> <b>In</b> at least one case, encomienda rights were granted to one of the Tlaxcalan leaders who came as allies, and land grants and exemption from being given in encomienda were given to the Mexican allies as rewards for their participation in the conquest. In practice, such privileges were easily removed or sidestepped by the Spanish and the indigenous conquistadors were treated in a similar manner to the conquered natives.|$|E
5|$|Janáček {{came from}} a region {{characterized}} by its deeply rooted folk culture, which he explored as a young student under Pavel Křížkovský. His meeting with the folklorist and dialectologist František Bartoš (1837–1906) was <b>decisive</b> <b>in</b> his own development as a folklorist and composer, and led to their collaborative and systematic collections of folk songs. Janáček became an important collector in his own right, especially of Lachian, Moravian Slovakian, Moravian Wallachian and Slovakian songs. From 1879, his collections included transcribed speech intonations. He {{was one of the}} organizers of the Czech-Slavic Folklore Exhibition, an important event in Czech culture at the end of 19th century. From 1905 he was President of the newly instituted Working Committee for Czech National Folksong in Moravia and Silesia, a branch of the Austrian institute Das Volkslied in Österreich (Folksong in Austria), which was established in 1902 by the Viennese publishing house Universal Edition. Janáček was a pioneer and propagator of ethnographic photography in Moravia and Silesia. In October 1909 he acquired an Edison phonograph and {{became one of the first}} to use phonographic recording as a folklore research tool. Several of these recording sessions have been preserved, and were reissued in 1998.|$|E
