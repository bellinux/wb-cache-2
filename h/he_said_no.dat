5|$|Later on {{the evening}} of 7 August, she asked Bamber whether he had done it. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>no,</b> but that a friend of his had, whom he named; the man was a plumber the family had used in the past. Bamber {{allegedly}} said he had told this friend how he could enter and leave the farmhouse undetected, and that one of his instructions had been for the friend to telephone him from the farm on one of the phones in the house that had a memory redial facility, so that if the police checked it, it would give him an alibi. Everything had gone as planned, he said, except that Nevill had put up a fight, and the friend had become angry and shot him seven times. The friend had allegedly told Sheila to lie down and shoot herself last, Bamber said. The friend then placed the Bible on her chest so she appeared to have killed herself in a religious frenzy. The children were shot in their sleep, he said. Mugford said Bamber claimed to have paid the friend £2,000.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of his governorship, Romney opposed same-sex marriage and civil unions, but advocated tolerance and supported some domestic partnership benefits. A November 2003 Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court decision required the state to recognize same-sex marriages (Goodridge v. Department of Public Health). Romney reluctantly backed a state constitutional amendment in February 2004 that would have banned those marriages but still allowed civil unions, viewing it as the only feasible way to accomplish the former. In May 2004, in compliance with the court decision, the governor instructed town clerks to begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. However, citing a 1913 law that barred out-of-state residents from getting married in Massachusetts if their union would be illegal in their home state, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>no</b> marriage licenses were to be issued to those people not planning to move to Massachusetts. In June 2005, Romney abandoned his support for the compromise amendment, stating that it confused voters who opposed both same-sex marriage and civil unions. Instead, he endorsed a ballot initiative led by the Coalition for Marriage and Family (an alliance of socially conservative organizations) that would have banned same-sex marriage and made no provisions for civil unions. In 2004 and 2006, he urged the U.S. Senate to vote in favor of the Federal Marriage Amendment.|$|E

[...] In response, Timberlake said, [...] "It is similar. You go back to Aaliyah's biggest record, 'Are You That Somebody' – it's similar to that too because it's that percussive ballad." [...] When asked about the lyrics, [...] "There's just one thing I need from you: say I do", being autobiographical, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>no,</b> adding that the line before that, [...] "this ring here {{represents}} my heart", is about marriage and love. Timberlake stated, [...] "It's not specifically about marriage, but about a humble approach to love. None of it is autobiographical, though obviously I have experience to draw from." ...|$|E

500|$|Some writers {{consider}} Mr. Hankey one of {{the most}} easily recognizable and popular of the non-regular South Park characters. His high-pitched greeting, [...] "Howdy-ho", was equally recognizable and became {{one of the}} most quoted lines from the show's first season. Several fan websites were made about the character within months of the episode's broadcast. In January 1998, Entertainment Weekly reported that Comedy Central executives had plans to produce a Mr. Hankey chocolate bar. Larry Lieberman, the channel's vice president of strategic planning and new business development, said a sketch of a Mr. Hankey candy bar was drawn and circulated, but mainly as a joke; <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>no</b> serious discussions were held about producing such an item. A stuffed Mr. Hankey became {{one of the most}} popular South Park tie-in products of the 1998 Christmas season.|$|E
500|$|From its beginning, the Sunday Expresss {{campaign}} {{drew the}} attention of other papers. Some backed Douglas, including the Sunday Chronicle, The People and Truth. The Daily News and Westminster Gazette ran a review that, without commenting on Douglas's action, said the novel [...] "present as a martyr {{a woman in the}} grip of a vice". Most of the British press defended The Well. The Nation suggested that the Sunday Express had only started its campaign because it was August, the journalistic silly season when good stories are scarce. Country Life and Lady's Pictorial both ran positive reviews. Arnold Dawson of the Daily Herald, a Labour newspaper, called Douglas a [...] "stunt journalist"; <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>no</b> one would give the book to a child, no child would want to read it, and any who did would find nothing harmful. Dawson also printed a scathing condemnation of the Home Office by H. G. Wells and George Bernard Shaw and started a counter-campaign that helped Hall obtain statements of support from the National Union of Railwaymen and the South Wales Miners' Federation.|$|E
500|$|In the meantime, Henry asks Emma {{about his}} father. Emma tells Henry that {{his dad was}} a trainee fireman who used to {{frequent}} the diner where she worked. The two of them [...] "hung out" [...] a few times, resulting in Emma being pregnant with Henry {{before she went to}} jail. Once there, she tried to tell him about Henry, only to discover that he had died while saving a family from a burning building. However, she later admits to Mary the story she gave Henry was a lie and he should never know the truth about his father. After Emma's reunion of the children with Michael that evening, Henry arrived with pumpkin pie to give Emma in order to thank her for explaining about his birth father. They are interrupted by a stranger (Eion Bailey) on a motorcycle with a unique box. Without giving his name, he asks Emma about finding a place to stay. After referring him to Granny's Bed & Breakfast, she reminds Henry that <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>no</b> one else ever comes to or leaves Storybrooke and Henry replies that they don't.|$|E

500|$|David Denby {{described}} Smith's {{performance as}} contrasting with his performances {{in his other}} films. He said, [...] "For {{the first time in}} his life, Will Smith doesn’t flirt with the audience... he stays in character as a self-hating lonely guy." [...] Stephen Hunter argued that Smith and his co-stars had misunderstood the material in the same manner as Berg. He added that the examination of Smith's character came across at first as an examination of [...] "phenomenally gifted" [...] black sporting superstars who were [...] "marginalized", [...] "dehumanized" [...] and exploited as a product by society. Manohla Dargis was struck by Theron's performance, saying that she enabled Smith to deepen the film's emotional complexity. Todd McCarthy said that Smith's [...] "attitude-laden quips" [...] helped to carry the film's superior first half, and that all three leads performed capably, but <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>no</b> opportunity was offered for the supporting characters to register. Roger Ebert writing in the Chicago Sun Times praised the three leads, saying that Smith avoided playing Hancock [...] "as a goofball" [...] and instead portrayed him as a more subtle and serious character. Stephen Farber said that Hancock was a good showcase for the leads, affirming that Smith shone in a film that was only sporadically worthy of his performance, while Colm Andrew of the Manx Independent said that despite the mix of themes [...] "the laughs are frequent and genuine (no forced slapstick), the fight scenes exciting and the emotional stuff quite moving [...] ".|$|E

2500|$|Bridget Erin [...] "Beach" [...] Hennessy, {{portrayed by}} Kaley Cuoco, is the beautiful, ditzy oldest child. She is {{depicted}} as a stereotypical blonde, a popular bombshell who is preoccupied with her looks, teenaged boys, and little else. She sometimes displays intelligence or profundity, but these are initially few and far between, yet often poignant. Her favorite book is J. D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye. After her father dies, she begins to steadily mature. Bridget initially felt guilty about Paul's death because the last words she ever spoke to him were [...] "I hate you" [...] after arguing with him earlier that morning, because <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>no</b> to her using the car. In season two, Bridget was revealed to have been conceived on a beach.|$|E

2500|$|Smith started {{arguing that}} Hutchison had {{approved}} {{to make the}} $50,000 expenditure, but {{wanted to talk to}} Hewitt first in July 1928. Hewitt also went and stated that the entire parkway would cost $50million (1928USD) to be constructed. Smith rebuffed that saying the parkway would be spread out over a period of a minimum of six years from the beginning of construction. The first piece would only be $5million spent. Smith called the opposition reasons by Hutchinson and Hewitt as [...] "absurd", though Smith admitted <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>no</b> funds for construction would be asked on until completion of the Southern State and the causeway to Jones Beach State Park. Smith said that they would have asked for the money this year if the legislature had not cut money that made it harder to get construction to Wantagh.|$|E
2500|$|On October 23, 1971, Rîmaru {{was taken}} to Jilava prison in a van. He had to be dragged {{to the place of}} {{execution}} from the moment he left the van. Until he was dead, he was in a rage and vigorously tried to escape. The three officers charged with shooting him tied him to a post in the prison yard. Asked, in accordance with the law, if he had any last wishes, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>no.</b> The men noticed him become more agitated, trying to bite off his clothes and twisting around the post. He yelled, [...] "Call my father, so he can see what's happening to me! Make him come! He's the only guilty one!" [...] and [...] "I want to live!" [...] Because of his constant movement, it was difficult to aim accurately and in the end, his backside was riddled with bullets (as he had turned all the way round). He was buried in the town cemetery; his grave remains unmarked.|$|E
2500|$|The Twelfth Doctor is, {{according}} to Capaldi, [...] "more alien than he's {{been in a}} while." [...] Whilst still defining himself as someone who [...] "saves people," [...] the Twelfth Doctor cares little about being seen as a hero or even being liked {{by the people who}} he is trying to save. Unlike his previous two incarnations who cared about humans and tried to understand them, Capaldi has confirmed that, this incarnation [...] "doesn't quite understand human beings or really care very much about their approval." [...] Clara is put on the back-foot by him post-regeneration initially not seeing through his 'Tough Exterior'. Playing Clara, Jenna Coleman says of this Doctor, [...] "He's more removed, you can't quite access him in the same way", in comparison to his more friendly and accessible predecessor. Initially it was reported that Capaldi specifically requested that the Doctor will not flirt with his companion the way his previous incarnation did, but the actor stated that <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>no</b> such thing and that it was inflated by the media. Steven Moffat has teased that Capaldi's Doctor may perhaps be more in love with Clara than he'd like to believe. He has also been described as a [...] "total adrenaline junkie" [...] and, {{according to}} Moffat, [...] "much fiercer, madder [...] less reliable". [...] "He's not as immediately approachable and he's not necessarily looking for your approval, when he says 'Wait here, I'll be back', you're not absolutely convinced... what he's not doing is reassuring you very much." ...|$|E
