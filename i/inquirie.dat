At the age of 30, being acquainted with [...] "the chiefest captaines at sea, the {{greatest}} merchants, and the best mariners of our nation", he was selected as chaplain and secretary to accompany Stafford, now English ambassador at the French court, to Paris in 1583. In accordance with the instructions of Secretary Francis Walsingham, he occupied himself chiefly in collecting information of the Spanish and French movements, and [...] "making diligent <b>inquirie</b> of such things as might yield any light unto our westerne discoveries in America". Although this was his only visit to Continental Europe in his life, he was angered to hear the limitations of the English in terms of travel being discussed in Paris.The first fruits of Hakluyt's labours in Paris were embodied in his important work entitled A Particuler Discourse Concerninge the Greate Necessitie and Manifolde Commodyties That Are Like to Growe to This Realme of Englande by the Westerne Discoueries Lately Attempted, Written in the Yere 1584, which Sir Walter Raleigh commissioned him to prepare. The manuscript, lost for almost 300 years, was published {{for the first time in}} 1877. Hakluyt revisited England in 1584, and laid a copy of the Discourse before Elizabeth I (to whom it had been dedicated) together with his analysis in Latin of Aristotle's Politicks. His objective was to recommend the enterprise of planting the English race in the unsettled parts of North America, and thus gain the Queen's support for Raleigh's expedition. In May 1585 when Hakluyt was in Paris with the English Embassy, the Queen granted to him the next prebendary at Bristol Cathedral that should become vacant, to which he was admitted in 1585 or 1586 and held with other preferments till his death.|$|E

These studies were developed in the ambit a PhD project in progress which seeks to emphasize theimportance of using the field work in research and teaching of geology and, somehow, the connectionbetween geological research and pedagogical intervention (didactic transposition). The application of the scale resulted from the performance of six field trips, with 8 high school classesBiology / Geology, having been obtained from a sample of 171 <b>inquirie...</b>|$|E

40|$|This {{paper offers}} some {{insights}} into {{the ways in which}} networks of schools can work together in order to bring about school improvement. These activities are based on the Unesco teacher education strategies and the use of The Index for Inclusion (2002) as a vehicle for school inquiry purposes. These inquiries lead to a focus on classroom practice development and school policies and cultures that aim to reduce barriers to participation for all students. It focuses on key themes that have been seen as important in successful developments and more inclusive practices. It also offers 'school stories' illustrating how individual schools undertook their <b>inquirie...</b>|$|E

40|$|Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are {{tools for}} acquiring, managing, {{analyzing}} and presenting {{in different ways}} spatially related information. Because the racy hardware development, especially the technical advances in automatic data acquirement, it becomes possible to acquire 3 D geometrical data. There are many application areas where spatially related information is very useful, like archeology, telecommunication, environmental protection, and tourism. In the context of such a 3 D-GIS in contrast of pure visualization systems, {{the analysis of the}} three-dimensional data plays a decisive role, in the special in connection with semantic information. An essential deficit of previous solutions is the absent support of typical functional demands on a 3 D-GIS through the underlying onceptual data model. Such a data model must duplicate information on the 3 D geometry and semantic of space-oriented objects, but also the topological relations of the objects among one another Goal of the work is the realization topological and space-oriented queries within a 3 D-GIS. Thereby it will be mounted on an existing 3 D-GIS. In the frame of this work, a 3 D-Geo data server is supposed to be realized on basis of a databank system, that typical GIS functionality supports. In addition are an object-relational and an object-oriented databank system to compare. In single, following points are to be worked: - State of the art - Conception of a logical data model to the administration of 3 D Geometries - Prototypical implementation of the data model and typical inquiries (Egenhofer-Operators, Region-Query) on the databases Oracle and Cloudscape - Critical comparison both solutions through analysis of data volume and performance of the <b>inquirie...</b>|$|E
