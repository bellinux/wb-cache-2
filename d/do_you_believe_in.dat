500|$|... "Express Yourself" [...] {{begins with}} the sound of brass tinkling along, as Madonna chimes the opening line: [...] "Come on girls, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> love? 'Cause I got {{something}} to say about it, And it goes something like this." [...] Handclaps and drum beats start as Madonna moves into the chorus of the song, with a thick vocal texture and high-pitched background singing. The chorus is aided by instrumentation from a saxophone and percussion. Madonna then sings the first verse of the song, as a violin sound is added after she finishes the bridge, [...] "Make you feel like a queen on the throne, make you love it till you never come down", a male voice repeating the last line. A synthesizer is played after the second verse as Madonna continues chanting the words [...] "Express yourself" [...] with background vocals singing [...] "Hey, hey, hey, hey" [...] alongside her.|$|E

500|$|Rather Ripped is the {{follow-up}} to Sonic Youth's 2004 album Sonic Nurse and the band's first record after {{the departure of}} multi-instrumentalist Jim O'Rourke, who joined {{the group as a}} fifth member in 1999. According to guitarist Lee Ranaldo, O'Rourke left the band to pursue film work and other recording projects. His departure affected the sound of Rather Ripped, with singer and guitarist Thurston Moore stating that the new record [...] "is just a far more straight up rock and roll album", in contrast to the [...] "darker, twisted, complex quality" [...] of O'Rourke's contributions. Moore also explained that he decided to write simpler songs [...] "for everybody to plug into immediately". The album's working titles were Sonic Life and <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Believe</b> <b>in</b> Rapture? The name [...] "Rather Ripped" [...] came from a Berkeley, California record store that later moved to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.|$|E
500|$|The video {{opens with}} the view of a city {{populated}} with skyscrapers, intermingling railway lines and aero-crafts. Steam blows out of the funnels of a factory as big machines are shown. Madonna, wearing black lingerie, appears {{on the back of}} a statue of an angry looking swan, and utters the line: [...] "Come on girls, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> love?" [...] This is followed by the chorus, showing the interiors of the factory where the workers slave at the machines, as rain pour incessantly on them. Amidst the smoke filled environment, the chiseled torso of the male workers are shown, as they strip off their shirts, with water splashing all around. Madonna is then shown in a light-green gown, holding a black cat in her lap, looking across the factory from her sitting room of her penthouse office. As she sings the first verse, the workers perform choreographed dance routine inside the factory. Madonna lies down on a sofa and the cat escapes from her lap, as her singing reaches the owner of the factory, through a series of speakers. He becomes nervous hearing her voice and looks down to find one of the workers staring up and looking for the source of the voice.|$|E
500|$|Professor Maury Dean {{wrote in}} his book Rock 'n' Roll Gold Rush: A Singles Un-Cyclopedia, that the main appeal of [...] "Express Yourself" [...] lay in its teen appeal, {{although}} he understood that at its core, it was addressing {{a very important issue}} of female liberation. Kevin Phinney from Austin American-Statesman commented that with [...] "Express Yourself", Madonna struck out her [...] "Material Girl" [...] persona, there by demonstrating once more that no image of hers is concrete. Based on the lyrics of the song, Ken Blakely of Philadelphia Daily News declared the song as a rare example of good taste and good advice from Like a Prayer. Andy Goldberg from The Jerusalem Post was impressed with Madonna's vocals on the song, complimenting the soul inlfluences. Rolling Stones J. D. Considine called [...] "Express Yourself" [...] an unabashed groove tune and felt that it seemed [...] "smart and sassy, right down to Madonna's soul-style testimony on the intro: 'Come on, girls, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> love?" [...] Don McCleese from Chicago Sun-Times declared the song as {{one of the highlights of}} the album, feeling that it would become anthemic. Sal Cinquemani from Slant magazine, while reviewing Like a Prayer, announced [...] "Express Yourself" [...] as the most soulful performance of Madonna's career. He added that the song [...] "turned Madonna's 'Material Girl' image on its head, denouncing material things for a little r-e-s-p-e-c-t." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic felt that the song consisted of [...] "deep funk" [...] music.|$|E

He has said he believes in God, though not necessarily in a traditional manner: [...] "I think everyone believes in God in their own ways," [...] he said. [...] "To me, it means {{that all of us}} are connected, all of life is connected, and that we are all tied together."

2500|$|On January 10, 2007, Bush {{announced}} {{his plans for}} the Iraq War troop surge of 2007. The gist of this announcement had been known around the Capitol for over a week, and when the Associated Press asked Ellison for his reaction to the idea on January 8, 2007, he stated that it was [...] "way too late, way too little.... So rather than do something small and ineffective, why not get about the business of what we're {{going to have to do}} eventually, which is to begin to end the occupation?" [...] Ellison called for an immediate withdrawal in Iraq: [...] "We could describe it as a redeployment or withdrawal, but I think we have run the course in terms of our ability to resolve this conflict militarily. I think we need to have a political and economic and diplomatic engagement, and we need to encourage the forces that are in Iraq to begin to resolve the violence in Iraq." [...] When asked if he would support Bush's call for an additional $100 billion to fund the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Ellison said, [...] "I want to see [...] first, I want to actually look at it, but I'm not inclined to continue to support a war or an occupation that he has no plans to get us out of, and which is so costly in terms of dollars and lives of American soldiers but also Iraqis." [...] The White House, when asked for a reaction to the comments, referred to a previous statement by press secretary Tony Snow: [...] "Democrats will have to decide where they stand on two issues: 'No. 1, do you want Iraq to succeed, and, if so, what does that mean? And, No. 2, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> supporting the troops as you say, and how do you express that support?'" ...|$|E
