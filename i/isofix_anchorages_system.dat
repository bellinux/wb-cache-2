40|$|Australia is {{considering}} allowing {{the use of}} lower <b>anchorage</b> <b>systems</b> for child restraints in motor vehicles. However, care {{needs to be taken}} to ensure that the mix of existing Australian child restraint systems and any proposed lower <b>anchorage</b> <b>system</b> does not pose safety risks for children. In addition, it is desirable to avoid unique requirements for an Australian lower <b>anchorage</b> <b>system</b> and hence an assessment of UNECE ISOFIX and US FMVSS LATCH requirements was undertaken. A series of 28 frontal impact sled tests were conducted based on the Australian Standard AS/NZS 3629 child restraint dynamic test method. A further series of 15 tests were conducted in a vehicle body mounted on an impact sled with an acceleration-time history representative of a 56 km/h full frontal rigid barrier crash. Three different models of forward-facing child restraint were tested, with varying anchorage configurations including rigid ISOFIX, flexible LATCH strap and 3 -point seatbelt. Top tethers were evaluated with anchorages directly behind the child restraint (0 °) and offset at an angle of 20 °. P 3 and Hybrid III 3 year old dummies were used. Anchorage loads and safety performance of the restraint system were assessed. In tests in the vehicle body, maximum dynamic top tether loads were in the range of 7 - 8 kN and maximum dynamic lower anchorage loads are estimated to be in the range 13 - 14 kN. Tests using rigid <b>ISOFIX</b> <b>anchorages</b> generally produced lower head acceleration and forward excursion than other tested anchorage types. However, this was accompanied by increased chest deflections and neck flexion moments. These data suggest that lower <b>anchorage</b> <b>systems</b> may be acceptable in Australia, but that modifications to the UNECE and LATCH requirements may be required to ensure compatibility with existing Australian child restraint systems without a degradation of child safety...|$|R

40|$|Fiber {{reinforced}} polymer (FRP) composite rods appear {{very promising}} {{to be used}} as an alternative to steel in prestressed concrete structures and ground anchors, especially for applications exposed to corrosive environments. The objectives of this study are to investigate the bond behavior of FRP rods to grout filled in steel tubes and hence to develop a competent bond-type <b>anchorage</b> <b>system</b> for post-tensioning applications with FRP multirod tendons. The research program includes pullout tests of grouted FRP rods and proving tests of the developed <b>anchorage</b> <b>system</b> for post-tensioning applications. Modeling the bond behavior and predicting the load bearing capacity of bond-type <b>anchorage</b> <b>systems</b> are also involved. Numerous (over 50) pullout tests were conducted and discussed to better understand bond mechanisms and the influence of type of fiber, outer surface, and other significant parameters (i. e., confining stiffness, grout type and curing condition) on bond performance. Modeling of bond-slip behavior of grouted FRP rods is examined to assess its adequacy to reproduce the experimental bond behavior. Based on the monitoring results of strain distribution along the bonded length, the working mechanism of bond-type anchorages for FRP tendons is discussed. A conceptual model for calculating the bond stress at the tendon-grout interface and the tensile capacity of bond-type anchorages for FRP tendons is established. A new bond-type <b>anchorage</b> <b>system</b> has been developed for post-tensioning applications with FRP tendons. Evaluations of the developed <b>anchorage</b> <b>system</b> have been conducted in anchorage models with CFRP mono- and 9 - rod tendons under tensile and sustained loading conditions. Furthermore, the developed <b>anchorage</b> <b>system</b> has also been used as an anchor head for post-tensioning of a full-scale FRP anchor model. Primary test results have indicated that the developed bond-type anchorage performs well for post-tensioning applications with FRP tendons. Conclusions and recommendations are made on the design of bond-type anchorages and post-tensioning applications of FRP tendons.

Corrosion distress and complete tendon failure has been identified in horizontally oriented tendons that support pre-cast bridge superstructure box segments.

40|$|Many {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} on the behaviour of beams shearstrengthened with FRP sheets. The studies show that FRP materials can produce good performance when used to carry some portion of shear force in the shear-strengthened beam. However, the performance of FRP sheets is found limited by bond capacity between FRP sheets and concrete surface. In certain case, <b>anchorage</b> <b>system</b> can be introduced to the FRP strengthening scheme to improve the bond performance. This paper presents experimental and analytical studies conducted to evaluate the contribution and behaviour of FRP sheets with anchored ends in strengthening the shear behaviour of reinforced concrete beams. In the study, nine reinforced concrete beam specimens were fabricated and tested. Test parameters of the study include thickness of FRP sheet used, types of wrap applied, type of anchors and diameter of anchor head used.

To delay or prevent de-bonding and therefore enhancing the load carrying capacity of strengthened beams, several <b>anchorage</b> <b>systems</b> were developed and used. This paper investigates the use of CFRP mechanical anchorage of CFRP sheets and plates used to externally strengthen reinforced concrete beams under flexure. The pin-and-fan shape CFRP anchor, which is custom-made from typical rolled fiber sheets and bundles of loose fiber is used. Several reinforced concrete beams were casted and tested in standard four-point bending scheme to study the effectiveness of this <b>anchorage</b> <b>system.</b> The beams were externally strengthened in flexure with bonded CFRP sheets and plates and then fastened to the soffit of the beams’ using various patterns of CFRP anchors. It is observed that the CFRP plates begins to separate from the beams as soon as de-bonding occurs in specimens without CFRP anchors, while in beams with CFRP anchors de-bonding was delayed leading to increase in the load carrying capacity over the un-anchored strengthened beams...|$|R

It has been demonstrated that failure of concrete structures retrofitted with CFRP usually occurs by de-lamination of the CFRP from the concrete substrate. As a result, the introduction of CFRP <b>anchorage</b> <b>systems</b> to increase the efficiency of CFRP solutions remains an area of great potential.

The benefits of the bi-directional CFRP <b>anchorage</b> <b>system</b> has resulted in significantly improved: fibre utilisation levels and increased ductility, which in some cases has resulted in laminate rupture.

The U-strips were bonded around the beam section and further anchored by two tufts of glass fibres, each of them embedded at the opposite beam face and specifically {{in the region of}} compression zone of the beam web. Experimental evaluations in simply supported lightly re-inforced concrete (RC) beams strengthened with one GFRP or a CFRP sheet anchored at its ends by the composite an-chorage have shown that their bending capacity has increased by 8 % and 17 %, respectively, in relation to the capacity at-tained in similar RC strengthened beams without anchorage.
