5|$|Construction {{began in}} 1998 {{to improve the}} bridge over the Schuylkill River in Montgomery County. The work {{involved}} building a new bridge adjacent to the existing bridge; the new bridge was wide <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> a future widening to six lanes. This project was completed in 2000.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening of}} the Saddledome allowed Calgary to play host to major musical acts that were {{bypassing}} {{the city in the}} early 1980s, because the city's existing facilities were not large <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> the industry's top performers.|$|E
5|$|Along the Metrorail system, {{the tracks}} are mostly elevated. The three {{sections}} {{that are not}} are under I-95 between Vizcaya and Brickell stations, under I-95 just east of Culmer station, and {{the northern end of}} the line from just east of the Palmetto Expressway heading west into the Palmetto station and tail track. In each of these cases, the tracks ride on ground level for a brief amount of time. The platform at each Metrorail station is long <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> six-car-long trains; the Dadeland North, Earlington Heights, and Government Center station platforms are long <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> eight-car-long trains. In-service trains are usually either four or six cars long; in the evening {{it is not uncommon for}} Miami-Dade Transit to link two out-of-service trains together before returning them to Lehman Yard. Trains are stored at the Lehman Yard just west of Okeechobee Station. There are extra tracks and a new test track, known as the Lehman Center Test Track, built at the Lehman Yard.|$|E

5|$|In 1628 he sailed {{again for}} Newfoundland, {{this time with}} his second wife Jane, most of his children, and 40 more settlers, to officially take over as Proprietary Governor of Avalon. He and his family moved into the house at Ferryland built by Wynne, a {{sizeable}} structure for the time, by colonial standards, {{and the only one}} in the settlement large <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> religious services for the community.|$|E
5|$|The Nagato {{class was}} {{equipped}} with a unique heptapodal (seven-legged) mast designed to maximize rigidity for range-finding purposes and survivability under shellfire. It consisted of a thick vertical leg in the center surrounded by six outer legs. The central leg was large <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> an electric elevator running between the foretop and main deck. In November 1944, the tops of Nagatos mainmast and funnel were removed to improve the arcs of fire for her anti-aircraft guns.|$|E
5|$|Temporarily {{transferred}} to Ziguinchor, the Carabane mission closed in 1888. Missionaries returned in 1890 and, although they immediately expanded the church building, {{it was still}} not large <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> all those who wished to attend. Thanks to subsidies by the bishop, Magloire-Désiré Barthet, and to donations by the parishioners, a new church was built and inaugurated on the Catholic feast day of Saint Anne in 1897. The mission also obtained two adjacent properties, lot #73 on the cadastral map. By the following year, the Christian community had performed 1,100 baptisms, {{as well as many}} catechumen.|$|E
50|$|Clerkships {{are great}} {{experiences}} {{for the new}} lawyers, and law schools encourage graduates {{to engage in a}} clerkship to broaden their professional experiences. However, there simply are not <b>enough</b> clerkships <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> all the academically eligible graduates.|$|R

5000|$|The only suriviving {{portion of}} the first verse is [...] "Namah shivaya", which means [...] "Obeisance to Shiva". The damaged portion has <b>enough</b> space <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> a verse in the Shardulavikridita metre. The damaged portion presumably {{contained}} a verse praising Shiva.|$|R
5|$|The company {{continued}} to leave Rosebery Avenue for summer tours to British cities and towns. The Arts Council (successor to CEMA) was {{sensitive to the}} charge that since 1945, far fewer opera performances had been given in the provinces. The small Carl Rosa Opera Company toured constantly, but the Covent Garden company visited only those few cities with theatres big <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> it. In the mid-1950s, renewed calls appeared for a reorganisation of Britain's opera companies. There were proposals for a new home for Sadler's Wells on the South Bank of the Thames near the Royal Festival Hall, which fell through because the government was unwilling to fund the building.|$|E
5|$|After an enquiry {{into the}} {{problems}} with the airborne missions in Sicily, the British Army and Royal Air Force submitted some recommendations. Aircrew had to be trained in parachute and glider operations, and pathfinders landing before the main force had to have enough time to set out their beacons. The landing plan was simplified, with complete brigades landing on one drop zone, instead of the smaller battalion landing areas used in Sicily. Gliders were no longer released at night while still over water, and their landing zones would be large <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> the aircraft with room to spare. Following the friendly fire incident over the convoy, more training was given to ships' crews in aircraft recognition, and Allied aircraft were painted with three large white stripes on their wings. Training for pilots belonging to the Glider Pilot Regiment was increased, and improvements to the gliders were implemented, including better inter-aircraft communication.|$|E
5|$|Although {{some of its}} {{stones were}} plundered for use elsewhere, the Pont du Gard {{remained}} largely intact. Its survival was due to its use as a toll bridge across the valley. In the 13th century the French king granted the seigneurs of Uzès the right to levy tolls on those using the bridge. The right later passed to the Bishops of Uzès. In return, they were responsible for maintaining the bridge in good repair. However, it suffered serious damage during the 1620s when Henri, Duke of Rohan made use of the bridge to transport his artillery during the wars between the French royalists and the Huguenots, whom he led. To make space for his artillery to cross the bridge, the duke had {{one side of the}} second row of arches cut away to a depth of about one-third of their original thickness. This left a gap on the lowest deck wide <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> carts and cannons, but severely weakened the bridge in the process.|$|E
50|$|While {{primarily}} a baseball venue, Minute Maid Park can adequately host {{sports such as}} soccer and both codes of rugby. The venue can also play host to large-scale music concerts. It is not large <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> comfortably <b>accommodate</b> American football.|$|R
50|$|The MA {{displayed}} many unusual automotive practices. It had {{the shape}} of a low slung two seat roadster with no top, but it was powered by an electric motor. The design was flexible <b>enough,</b> though, <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> a small internal combustion engine.|$|R
5000|$|Since the Division A winners {{received}} a bye in the quarter-finals, this meant {{one of the}} four quarter-final ties was to be void. The three other quarter-final matches only had <b>enough</b> spaces <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> six of the other seven teams qualified for Superfinal.|$|R
5|$|At the Pacific Military Conference in March 1943, the Joint Chiefs of Staff {{approved}} {{the latest version}} of General MacArthur's Elkton plan for an advance on Rabaul. Owing to a shortage of resources, particularly heavy bomber aircraft, the final stage of the plan, the capture of Rabaul itself, was postponed until 1944. By July 1943, the Joint Chiefs were considering the possibility of neutralising and bypassing Rabaul, but the navy would still need a forward fleet base. The Admiralty Islands, already a part of the Elkton plan, could serve this purpose, as they contained flat areas for airstrips, space for military installations, and Seeadler Harbour, which was large <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> a naval task force. On 6 August 1943, the Joint Chiefs of Staff adopted a plan that called for the neutralisation rather than the capture of Rabaul, and scheduled the invasion of the Admiralty Islands for 1 June 1944.|$|E
5|$|Attached to {{the dome}} is a three-storey {{rectangular}} building which houses the telescope control room, computer room, kitchen etc. Almost no human presence is required inside the dome, {{which means the}} environmental conditions can be kept very stable. As a result, the WHT obtains perfect dome seeing. This building also houses a detector laboratory and a realuminising plant. Because the WHT has the largest single mirror at the Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos, its realuminising plant has a vacuum vessel large <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> the mirrors from any other telescope on the mountain. As a result, {{all of the other}} telescopes at the observatory contract to use the WHT plant for their realuminising (with the exception of the Gran Telescopio Canarias, which has its own plant).|$|E
5|$|Frusciante, Kiedis, and Flea {{each had}} their own {{separate}} rooms {{at each end of}} the house. When not recording with the band, Frusciante would spend his time painting, listening to music, reading and recording songs he'd written. Due to the seclusion, Kiedis ended up recording all his vocals in his room, as it was large <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> the recording equipment. For over thirty days, the Chili Peppers worked inside the house; Kiedis felt it was an accommodating and resourceful environment which allowed him to complete the rest of the lyrics. During production, the band agreed to let Flea's brother-in-law document the creative process on film. When the album's recording was complete, the Chili Peppers released the film, titled Funky Monks.|$|E

5|$|In modern thought, {{the orbits}} of the planets are viewed as the paths of those planets through mostly empty space. Ancient and medieval thinkers, however, {{considered}} the celestial orbs to be thick spheres of rarefied matter nested one within the other, each one in complete contact with the sphere above it and the sphere below. When scholars applied Ptolemy's epicycles, they presumed that each planetary sphere was exactly thick <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> them. By combining this nested sphere model with astronomical observations, scholars calculated what became generally accepted values at {{the time for the}} distances to the Sun (about 4 million miles), to the other planets, and {{to the edge of the}} universe (about 73 million miles). The nested sphere model's distances to the Sun and planets differ significantly from modern measurements of the distances, and the size of the universe is now known to be inconceivably large and possibly infinite.|$|E
5|$|On December 15, 2015, Heyward {{signed an}} eight-year, $184 million {{contract}} with the Cubs. One of his first acts after signing his contract was to pay for hotel suites large <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> teammate David Ross, his wife, and their three young children {{on all of the}} Cubs' road trips during the 2016 season. Ross, set to retire after the 2016 season, had been Heyward's teammate during his first three seasons in Atlanta, and Heyward considered him a key mentor in his early MLB career. In an interview with the Bleacher Report website, Heyward said,I know how special it is to have teammates like he was my first three years in Atlanta. You don't take it for granted. I wanted to say thank you {{from the bottom of my}} heart, as a teammate and as a friend, for what he's done for me.|$|E
5|$|The Silver Reef {{area was}} first {{inhabited}} by Anasazi Native Americans between about 200AD and 1300AD. The Anasazi were nomads who followed {{the migration of}} the animals they hunted, typically deer, mountain sheep, elk, and jackrabbits. They were also farmers and gardeners, growing corn, wheat, rye, and barley. Many were potters, and pottery {{can be found in}} abandoned villages. The Anasazi usually constructed temporary dwellings out of sticks and leaves, often using bark for the roofs. Occasionally they built more permanent dwellings out of rocks, usually along the side of a mountain, often large <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> several families. Storage pits were often placed behind the rock dwellings. Settlements were typically small, as food was scarce. A group of Virgin Anasazi lived in what is now the Red Cliffs Anasazi Site in Red Cliffs Recreation Area.|$|E

5|$|The spacewalk {{scene on}} the Enterprise {{exterior}} {{was one of the}} most challenging sets to envision and construct for the film. The production had to design a space suit that looked practical rather than exaggerated. Fans were built into the helmets so that the actors would not get overheated, and neon lights built into the front so that the occupant's faces could be seen. When the actors first put the helmets on, the fully enclosed design made it hard to breathe; after a minute of wearing the suit Stewart became ill, and shooting was discontinued. The set for the ship's outer hull and deflector dish were built on gimbals at Paramount's largest sound stage, surrounded by bluescreen and rigged with wires for the zero gravity sequences. The stage was not large <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> a full-sized replica of the Enterprise dish, so Zimmerman had to scale down the plans by 15percent.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} methods of burial: the coffin may be laid {{in a cave}} or in a carved stone grave, or hung on a cliff. It {{contains}} any possessions that the deceased will need in the afterlife. The wealthy are often buried in a stone grave carved out of a rocky cliff. The grave is usually expensive and takes {{a few months to}} complete. In some areas, a stone cave may be found that is large <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> a whole family. A wood-carved effigy, called Tau tau, is usually placed in the cave looking out over the land. The coffin of a baby or child may be hung from ropes on a cliff face or from a tree. This hanging grave usually lasts for years, until the ropes rot and the coffin falls to the ground.|$|E
5|$|Edmund Sharpe {{started his}} {{practice}} {{at the end of}} 1835 in his mother's house in Penny Street, moving into premises in Sun Street in 1838. In October that year he took as his pupil Edward Graham Paley, then aged 15. Later in 1838 Sharpe took a house in StLeonard's Gate large <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> himself and Paley; the practice continued to use the premises in Sun Street until after Sharpe's retirement. In 1841 Thomas Austin also joined the practice as a pupil, staying until 1852 when he left to set up on his own as an architect in Newcastle upon Tyne. In 1845 Sharpe made Paley a partner, and in 1847 effectively handed the business over to him. At about this time also, John Douglas joined the firm as Paley's assistant, and stayed with the firm until about 1859, when he moved to Chester to establish his own practice. Sharpe retired completely from the practice in 1851, leaving Paley as sole principal. Also in 1851 Paley married Sharpe's sister, Frances.|$|E
