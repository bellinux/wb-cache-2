40|$|The {{impact of}} {{aircraft}} emissions and contrails {{on the environment}} adds an additional aspect to aircraft trajectory optimization. This study developed a three-dimensional trajectory optimization algorithm for trans-Atlantic flights in cruise to generate aircraft trajectories that minimize environmental impacts due to CO 2 emissions and contrails {{in the presence of}} winds. The climate-optimal trajectory is developed using dynamic programming that adjusts a wind-optimal aircraft heading while determining the optimal locations, altitudes and times for <b>en-route</b> step <b>climbs.</b> Flying wind-optimal routes minimize aircraft travel time, fuel burn and associated emissions during cruise while adjusting aircraft heading and <b>en-route</b> step <b>climbs</b> at the optimal locations and times minimize climate impact of contrails. This capability integrates an air traffic management simulation with aircraft fuel burn and emissions models, contrail formation and dispersion models, simplified climate response models, and a common climate metric. A study was conducted to evaluate the potential cost and benefits of flying climate-optimal routes in North Atlantic Airspace and their impacts to the Organized Track System design based on the trans-Atlantic air traffic during a day, July 12, 2012. Results show eastbound flights achieved a larger environmental benefit with less additional fuel burn than westbound flights that operated in strong headwinds that caused more additional fuel burn and aircraft emissions to avoid traversing contrails favorable regions.

40|$|Developing optimal {{aircraft}} trajectories that minimize flight times, fuel burn, {{and associated}} environmental emissions not only enhances air traffic flow but also helps the aviation industry cope with increasing fuel costs and reduce aviation-induced climate change. This study develops a trajectory optimization algorithm for minimizing aircraft travel time and fuel burn by combining {{a method for}} computing minimum-time routes in winds on multiple horizontal planes, and an aircraft fuel burn model for generating fuel-optimal vertical profiles. It is applied to assess {{the potential benefits of}} flying user-preferred routes for commercial cargo flights operating between Anchorage, Alaska and major airports in Asia and the contiguous United States. Flying wind optimal trajectories with a fuel-optimal vertical profile reduces average fuel burn of international flights cruising at a single altitude by 1 - 3 %. Long-haul flights not only gain fuel savings from <b>en-route</b> step <b>climbs</b> but also potentially benefit from high-speed winds at higher altitudes. The potential fuel savings of performing <b>en-route</b> step <b>climbs</b> are not significant for many shorter domestic cargo flights that have only one step climb. Wind-optimal trajectories reduce fuel burn and travel time relative to the flight plan route by up to 3 % for the domestic cargo flights. However, for trans-oceanic traffic, the fuel burn savings is up to about 10 %. In general, the savings are proportional to trip length, and depend on the en-route wind conditions and aircraft types...|$|R

However, for trans-oceanic traffic, the fuel burn savings could be as much as 10 %. The actual savings in operations will vary from the simulation results due to differences in the aircraft models and user defined cost indices. In general, the savings are proportional to trip length, and depend on the en-route wind conditions and aircraft types. I...|$|R
